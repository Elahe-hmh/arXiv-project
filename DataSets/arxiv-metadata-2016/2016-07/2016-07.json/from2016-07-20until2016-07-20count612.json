order\nsemi--linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven\nby additive space-time noise. We introduce a new modified scheme using a linear\nfunctional of the noise with a semi--implicit Euler--Maruyama method in time\nand in space we analyse a finite element method (although extension to finite\ndifferences or finite volumes would be possible). We prove convergence in the\nroot mean square $L^{2}$ norm for a diffusion reaction equation and diffusion\nadvection reaction equation. We present numerical results for a linear reaction\ndiffusion equation in two dimensions as well as a nonlinear example of\ntwo-dimensional stochastic advection diffusion reaction equation. We see from\nboth the analysis and numerics that the proposed scheme has better convergence\nproperties than the standard semi--implicit Euler--Maruyama method.\n", "  A boundary element method (BEM) simulation is used to compare the efficiency\nof numerical inverse Laplace transform strategies, considering general\nrequirements of Laplace-space numerical approaches. The two-dimensional BEM\nsolution is used to solve the Laplace-transformed diffusion equation, producing\na time-domain solution after a numerical Laplace transform inversion. Motivated\nby the needs of numerical methods posed in Laplace-transformed space, we\ncompare five inverse Laplace transform algorithms and discuss implementation\ntechniques to minimize the number of Laplace-space function evaluations. We\ninvestigate the ability to calculate a sequence of time domain values using the\nfewest Laplace-space model evaluations. We find Fourier-series based inversion\nalgorithms work for common time behaviors, are the most robust with respect to\nfree parameters, and allow for straightforward image function evaluation re-use\nacross at least a log cycle of time.\n", "  In this paper we take into account the effect of the magnetic moment on the\nYukawa and Coulomb interaction between particles. We find that the Yukawa's and\nCoulomb's laws are modified by a factor cosine, whose argument depends on the\nmagnetic moment of the particles and also, on the distance between the two\nparticles. The obtained results are applied to ferromagnetism and are in a good\nagreement with experimental data.\n", "  Whether the Dirac sea model is right is verifiable. Assuming the Dirac sea is\na physical reality, we have one imagination that a negative energy particle(s)\nin the sea and a usual positive energy particle(s) will form a neutral atom.\nThe features of the atom can be studied using the nonrelativistic reduction of\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation, especially for a two body system. This work is\ndedicated to discuss the bound state of spin-0 and spin-$\\frac{\\displaystyle\n1}{\\displaystyle 2}$ constituents. The study shows that an atom consisting of a\nnegative energy particle $(e^-$ or $hc)$ and a positive energy particle\n$(u\\overline{d}$ or $hc)$ has some features of a neutrino, such as spin, lepton\nnumber and oscillation. One deduction is that if the atom is a real particle,\nan atom $X$ consisting of two negative energy particles and a nucleus with\ndouble charges exists in nature, which can be observed in Strangeonium,\nCharmonium and Bottomonium decays $[s\\overline{s}]$, $[c\\overline{c}]$ and\n$[b\\overline{b}]\\rightarrow X \\pi^-\\pi^- e^+e^+~+~hc$ with $X$ invisible at\nKLOE, CLEOc, BESIII, Belle and BaBar.\n", "  We give asymptotic formulae for random matrix averages of derivatives of\ncharacteristic polynomials over the groups USp(2N), SO(2N) and O^-(2N). These\naverages are used to predict the asymptotic formulae for moments of derivatives\nof L-functions which arise in number theory. Each formula gives the leading\nconstant of the asymptotic in terms of determinants of hypergeometric\nfunctions. We find a differential recurrence relation between these\ndeterminants which allows the rapid computation of the (k+1)-st constant in\nterms of the k-th and (k-1)-st. This recurrence is reminiscent of a Toda\nlattice equation arising in the theory of \\tau-functions associated with\nPainlev\\'e differential equations.\n", "  We develop a closed-form three-parameter model for unsaturated hydraulic\nconductivity associated with the Kosugi three-parameter lognormal moisture\nretention model. The model derivation uses a slight modification to Mualem's\ntheory, which is nearly exact for non-clay soils. Kosugi's three-parameter\nlognormal moisture retention model uses physically meaningful parameters, but a\ncorresponding closed-form relative hydraulic conductivity model has never been\ndeveloped. The model is further extended to a four -parameter model by\ntruncating the underlying pore size distribution at physically permissible\nminimum and maximum pore radii. The proposed closed-form models are fitted to\nwell-known experimental data, to illustrate their utility. They have the same\nphysical basis as Kosugi's two-parameter model, but are more general.\n", "  Model applicability to core-scale solute transport is evaluated using\nbreakthrough data from column experiments conducted with conservative tracers\ntritium (H-3) and sodium-22, and the retarding solute uranium-232. The three\nmodels considered are single-porosity, double-porosity with single-rate\nmobile-immobile mass-exchange, and the multirate model, which is a\ndeterministic model that admits the statistics of a random mobile-immobile\nmass-exchange rate coefficient. The experiments were conducted on intact\nCulebra Dolomite core samples. Previously, data were analyzed using single- and\ndouble-porosity models although the Culebra Dolomite is known to possess\nmultiple types and scales of porosity, and to exhibit multirate\nmobile-immobile-domain mass transfer characteristics at field scale. The data\nare reanalyzed here and null-space Monte Carlo analysis is used to facilitate\nobjective model selection. Prediction (or residual) bias is adopted as a\nmeasure of the model structural error. The analysis clearly shows single- and\ndouble-porosity models are structurally deficient, yielding late-time residual\nbias that grows with time. On the other hand, the multirate model yields\nunbiased predictions consistent with the late-time -5/2 slope diagnostic of\nmultirate mass transfer. The analysis indicates the multirate model is better\nsuited to describing core-scale solute breakthrough in the Culebra Dolomite\nthan the other two models.\n", "  The paper deals with the calculation of the gravitational entropy in the\ncontext of teleparallel gravity for de Sitter space-time. In such a theory it\nis possible to define gravitational energy and pressure, thus we use those\nexpressions to construct the gravitational entropy. We interpret the\ncosmological constant as the temperature and write the first law of\nthermodynamics. In the limit $\\Lambda\\ll 1$ we find that the entropy is\nproportional to volume and $\\Delta S\\geq 0$.\n", "  A new rotation version of the Curzon-Chazy metric is found. This new metric\nwas obtained by means of a perturbation method, in order to include slow\nrotation. The solution is then proved to fulfill the Einstein field equations\nusing a REDUCE program. Furthermore, the applications of this new solution are\ndiscussed.\n", "  A REDUCE code for the Newman-Janis algorithm is described. This algorithm is\nintended to include rotation into nonrotating solutions of the Einstein field\nequations with spherically symmetry or perturbed spherically symmetry and has\nbeen successfully applied to many spacetimes. The applicability of the code is\nrestricted to metrics containing potentials of the form 1/r.\n", "  A large variety of rhythms are observed in nature. Rhythms such as\nelectroencephalogram signals in the brain can often be regarded as interacting.\nIn this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of rhythmic systems in\ntwo populations of phase oscillators with different frequency distributions. We\nassume that the average frequency ratio between two populations closely\napproximates some small integer. Most importantly, we adopt a specific coupling\nfunction derived from phase reduction theory. Under some additional\nassumptions, the system of two populations of coupled phase oscillators reduces\nto a low-dimensional system in the continuum limit. Consequently, we find\nchimera states in which clustering and incoherent states coexist. Finally, we\nconfirm consistent behaviors of the derived low-dimensional model and the\noriginal model.\n", "  The extremely useful method of Malliavin calculus has not yet gained adequate\npopularity because of the complicated analytic apparatus of this method. The\nauthor attempts here to propose a simplified algebraic formalism similar to\nMalliavin calculus, but based on the notion of creation-annihilation operators\ninstead of Malliavin derivative to replace analytic theorems with algebraic\ncomputations. Three test problems: the valuation of portfolio with stochastic\npayoff function, the expression of the terminal payoff through stochastic\nintegral and the approximate equation for the high-frequency market measure are\ndiscussed in Appendices.\n", "  Modern day studies of wind-driven sea waves are usually focused on wind\nforcing rather than on the effect of resonant nonlinear wave interactions. The\nauthors assume that these effects are dominating and propose a simple\nrelationship between instant wave steepness and time or fetch of wave\ndevelopment expressed in wave periods or lengths. This law does not contain\nwind speed explicitly and relies upon this asymptotic theory. The validity of\nthis law is illustrated by results of numerical simulations, in situ\nmeasurements of growing wind seas and wind wave tank experiments. The impact of\nthe new vision of sea wave physics is discussed in the context of conventional\napproaches to wave modeling and forecasting.\n", "  The IceCube evidence for cosmic neutrinos has inspired a large number of\nhypothesis on their origin, mainly due to the poor precision on the measurement\nof the direction of showering events. A North/South asymmetry in the present\ndata set suggests the presence of a possible Galactic component. This could be\noriginated either by single point-like sources or from an extended Galactic\nregion. Expected fluxes derived from these hypotheses are presented. Some\nvalues have been constrained from the present available upper limits from the\nANTARES neutrino telescope.\n", "  In this work we explain how to properly use mean-field methods to solve the\ninverse Ising problem when the phase space is clustered, that is many states\nare present. The clustering of the phase space can occur for many reasons, e.g.\nwhen a system undergoes a phase transition. Mean-field methods for the inverse\nIsing problem are typically used without taking into account the eventual\nclustered structure of the input configurations and may led to very bad\ninference (for instance in the low temperature phase of the Curie-Weiss model).\nIn the present work we explain how to modify mean-field approaches when the\nphase space is clustered and we illustrate the effectiveness of the new method\non different clustered structures (low temperature phases of Curie-Weiss and\nHopfield models).\n", "  Using the worldline SU(2|1) superfield approach, we construct N=4\nsuperconformally invariant actions for the d=1 multiplets (1, 4, 3) and (2, 4,\n2). The SU(2|1) superfield framework automatically implies the trigonometric\nrealization of the superconformal symmetry and the harmonic oscillator term in\nthe corresponding component actions. We deal with the general N=4\nsuperconformal algebra D(2,1;$\\alpha$) and its central-extended $\\alpha$=0 and\n$\\alpha$=-1 psu(1,1|2)$\\oplus$su(2) descendants. We capitalize on the\nobservation that D(2,1;$\\alpha$) at $\\alpha\\neq$0 can be treated as a closure\nof its two su(2|1) subalgebras, one of which defines the superisometry of the\nSU(2|1) superspace, while the other is related to the first one through the\nreflection of $\\mu$, the parameter of contraction to the flat N=4, d=1\nsuperspace. This closure property and its $\\alpha$=0 analog suggest a simple\ncriterion for the SU(2|1) invariant actions to be superconformal: they should\nbe even functions of $\\mu$. We find that the superconformal actions of the\nmultiplet (2, 4, 2) exist only at $\\alpha$=-1, 0 and are reduced to a sum of\nthe free sigma-model type action and the conformal superpotential yielding,\nrespectively, the oscillator potential $\\sim \\mu^2$ and the standard conformal\ninverse-square potential in the bosonic sector. The sigma-model action in this\ncase can be constructed only on account of non-zero central charge in the\nsuperalgebra su(1,1|2).\n", "  The debate on the nature of the gamma-ray emission from young supernova\nremnants is still open. Ascribing such emission to hadronic rather than\nleptonic processes would provide an evidence for the acceleration of protons\nand nuclei, and this fact would fit with the very popular (but not proven)\nparadigm that supernova remnants are the sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Here,\nwe discuss this issue with a particular focus on the best studied\ngamma-ray-bright supernova remnant: RX~J1713.7-3946.\n", "  We probe the transition between superfluid and Bose glass phases using\nquantum quenches of disorder in an ultracold atomic lattice gas that realizes\nthe disordered Bose-Hubbard model. Measurements of excitations generated by the\nquench exhibit threshold behavior in the disorder strength indicative of a\nphase transition. Ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the\nappearance of excitations coincides with the equilibrium superfluid--Bose-glass\nphase boundary at different lattice potential depths. By varying the quench\ntime, we demonstrate the disappearance of an adiabatic timescale compared with\nmicroscopic parameters in the BG regime.\n", "  The search for topological superconductors which support Majorana fermion\nexcitations has been an important topic in condensed matter physics. In this\nwork, we propose a new experimental scheme for engineering topological\nsuperconductors. In this scheme, by manipulating the superlattice structure of\norganic molecules placed on top of a superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling, topological superconducting phases can be achieved without\nfine-tuning the chemical potential. Moreover, superconductors with different\nChern numbers can be obtained by changing the superlattice structure of the\norganic molecules.\n", "  A multiporosity extension of classical double and triple porosity fractured\nrock flow models for slightly compressible fluids is presented. The\nmultiporosity model is an adaptation of the multirate solute transport model of\nHaggerty and Gorelick (1995) to viscous flow in fractured rock reservoirs. It\nis a generalization of both pseudo-steady-state and transient interporosity\nflow double porosity models. The model includes a fracture continuum and an\noverlapping distribution of multiple rock matrix continua, whose\nfracture-matrix exchange coefficients are specified through a discrete\nprobability mass function. Semi-analytical cylindrically symmetric solutions to\nthe multiporosity mathematical model are developed using the Laplace transform\nto illustrate its behavior. The multiporosity model presented here is\nconceptually simple, yet flexible enough to simulate common conceptualizations\nof double and triple porosity flow. This combination of generality and\nsimplicity makes the multiporosity model a good choice for flow in\nlow-permeability fractured rocks.\n", "  Vacuum energy changes during cosmological phase transitions and becomes\nrelatively important at epochs just before phase transitions. For a viable\ncosmology the vacuum energy just after a phase transition must be set by the\ncritical temperature of the next phase transition, which exposes the\ncosmological constant problem from a different angle. Here we propose to\nexperimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances\ndifferent from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the\neffect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have\ndifferent vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the\nnormal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron\nstars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield\ninformation about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can\nsignificantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic\nevolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase\ntransitions. While traditional cosmology predicts steps in the spectrum\ndetermined by the number of degrees of freedom both for the QCD and electroweak\nphase transitions, an adjustment mechanism for vacuum energy could\nsignificantly change this. In addition, there might be other phase transitions\nwhere the effect of vacuum energy could show up as a peak in the spectrum.\n", "  Relativistic spin-1/2 particles in curved spacetime are naturally described\nby Dirac theory, which is a dynamical and Lorentz-invariant field theory. In\nthis work, we propose a non-dynamical fermion theory in 3+1 dimensions dubbed\nspinor topological field theory, built in terms of a spinor field and a Cartan\nconnection related to de Sitter group. We show that our model gives rise to the\nDirac theory in curved spacetime when the local de Sitter gauge invariance of\nthe model breaks down to the Lorentz gauge invariance, providing also a\ngeometric origin to the fermion mass. Finally, we show that other gauge fields\nand suitable four-fermion interactions can be included in a straightforward\nway.\n", "  A program to generate codes in Fortran and C of the full Magnetohydrodynamic\nequations is shown. The program used the free computer algebra system software\nREDUCE. This software has a package called EXCALC, which is an exterior\ncalculus program. The advantage of this program is that it can be modified to\ninclude another complex metric or spacetime. The output of this program is\nmodified by means of a LINUX script which creates a new REDUCE program to\nmanipulate the MHD equations to obtain a code that can be used as a seed for a\nMHD code for numerical applications. As an example, we present part of output\nof our programs for Cartesian coordinates and how to do the discretization.\n", "  A theory of lepton decay constants based on the path-integral formalism is\ngiven for chiral and vector mesons. Decay constants of the pseudoscalar and\nvector mesons are calculated and compared to other existing results.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the simulation of the exact real-time dynamics of\nclassical many-body systems with discrete energy levels. In the same spirit of\nkinetic Monte Carlo methods, a stochastic solution of the master equation is\nfound, with no need to define any other phase-space construction. However,\nunlike existing methods, the present algorithm does not assume any particular\nstatistical distribution to perform moves or to advance the time, and thus is a\nunique tool for the numerical exploration of fast and ultra-fast dynamical\nregimes. By decomposing the problem in a set of two-level subsystems, we find a\nnatural variable step size, that is well defined from the normalization\ncondition of the transition probabilities between the levels. We successfully\ntest the algorithm with known exact solutions for non-equilibrium dynamics and\nequilibrium thermodynamical properties of Ising-spin models in one and two\ndimensions, and compare to standard implementations of kinetic Monte Carlo\nmethods. The present algorithm is directly applicable to the study of the real\ntime dynamics of a large class of classical markovian chains, and particularly\nto short-time situations where the exact evolution is relevant.\n", "  Despite large progresses in building new detectors and in the analysis\ntechniques, the key questions concerning the origin, acceleration and\npropagation of Galactic Cosmic Rays are still open. A number of new EAS arrays\nis in progress. The most ambitious and sensitive project between them is\nLHAASO, a new generation multi-component experiment to be installed at very\nhigh altitude in China (Daocheng, Sichuan province, 4400 m a.s.l.). The\nexperiment will face the open problems through a combined study of photon- and\ncharged particle-induced extensive air showers in the wide energy range\n10$^{11}$ - 10$^{18}$ eV. In this paper the status of the experiment will be\nsummarized, the science program presented and the outlook discussed in\ncomparison with leading new projects.\n", "  We investigate the long term behavior in terms of finite dimensional global\nand exponential attractors, as time goes to infinity, of solutions to a\nsemilinear reaction-diffusion equation on non-smooth domains subject to\nnonlocal Robin boundary conditions, characterized by the presence of fractional\ndiffusion on the boundary. Our results are of general character and apply to a\nlarge class of irregular domains, including domains whose boundary is Holder\ncontinuous and domains which have fractal-like geometry. In addition to\nrecovering most of the existing results on existence, regularity, uniqueness,\nstability, attractor existence, and dimension, for the well-known\nreaction-diffusion equation in smooth domains, the framework we develop also\nmakes possible a number of new results for all diffusion models in other\nnon-smooth settings.\n", "  Decay constants of the charged and neutral pions in magnetic field are\nconsidered in the framework of the effective quark-antiquark lagrangian\nrespecting Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner (GOR) relations at zero field. The\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{e_qB}{\\sigma}}$ dependence is found in strong fields $e_qB\\gg\n\\sigma$ for the neutral pion, while the charged pion constant decreases as\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{e_qB}}$.\n", "  We compute the momentum-transfer dependence of the proton Pauli form factor\n$F_{2}$ in the endpoint overlap model. We find the model correctly reproduces\nthe scaling of the ratio of $F_{2}$ with the Dirac Form factor $F_{1}$ observed\nat the Jefferson Laboratory. The calculation uses the leading-power, leading\ntwist Dirac structure of the quark light-cone wave function, and the same\nendpoint dependence previously determined from the Dirac form factor $F_{1}$.\nThere are no parameters and no adjustable functions in the endpoint model's\nprediction for $F_{2}$. The model's predicted ratio $F_{2}(Q^{2})/F_{1}(Q^{2})$\nis quite insensitive to the endpoint wave function, which explains why the\nobserved ratio scales like $1/Q$ down to rather low momentum transfers. The\nendpoint model appears to be the only comprehensive model consistent with all\nform factor information as well as reproducing fixed-angle proton-proton\nscattering at large momentum transfer. Any one of the processes is capable of\npredicting the others.\n", "  This paper investigates instability ranges of a cylindrically symmetric\ncollapsing stellar object in Brans-Dicke theory of gravity. For this purpose,\nwe use perturbation approach in the modified field equations as well as\ndynamical equations and construct a collapse equation. The collapse equation\nwith adiabatic index ($\\Gamma$) is used to explore the instability ranges of\nboth isotropic as well as anisotropic fluid in Newtonian and post-Newtonian\napproximations. It turns out that the instability ranges depend on the\ndynamical variables of collapsing fluid. We conclude that the system always\nremains unstable for $0<\\Gamma<1$ while $\\Gamma>1$ provides instability only\nfor the special case.\n", "  We present a systematical theoretical study on the transport properties of an\narchetypal family of Hund's metals, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$,Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, SrRuO$_3$\nand CaRuO$_3$, within the combination of first principles density functional\ntheory and dynamical mean field theory. The agreement between theory and\nexperiments for optical conductivity and resistivity is good, which indicates\nthat electron-electron scattering dominates the transport of ruthenates. We\ndemonstrate that in the single-site dynamical mean field approach the transport\nproperties of Hund's metals fall into the scenario of \"resilient\nquasiparticles\". We explains why the single layered compound Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has\na relative weak correlation with respect to its siblings, which corroborates\nits good metallicity.\n", "  In this presentation I report on the results of the paper we published\nrecently together with Kacper Zalewski. It exploits the consequences of the\nobservation that the hadrons, being the composite objects, cannot be produced\ntoo close to each other and thus must be correlated in space-time. One of these\nconsequences, which we discuss here, is that the correlation function need not\nbe larger than 1 (as is necessary if the space-time correlations are absent).\nSince the data from LEP and from LHC do show that the correlation function\nfalls below 1, the particles must be correlated and we show that our\nobservation does explain this unexpected effect.\n", "  We calculate the in-plane Seebeck coefficient of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ within a\nframework combining electronic structure and dynamical mean-field theory. We\nshow that its temperature-dependence is consistent with entropic considerations\nembodied in the Kelvin formula, and that it provides a meaningful probe of the\ncrossover out of the Fermi liquid regime into an incoherent metal. This\ncrossover proceeds in two stages: the entropy of spin degrees of freedom is\nreleased around room-temperature while orbital degrees of freedom remain\nquenched up to much higher temperatures. This is confirmed by a direct\ncalculation of the corresponding susceptibilities, and is a hallmark of `Hund's\nmetals'. We also calculate the c-axis thermopower, and predict that it exceeds\nsubstantially the in-plane one at high-temperature, a peculiar behaviour which\noriginates from an interlayer 'hole-filtering' mechanism.\n", "  We study the backwards-in-time stability of the Schwarzschild singularity\nfrom a dynamical PDE point of view. More precisely, considering a spacelike\nhypersurface $\\Sigma_0$ in the interior of the black hole region, tangent to\nthe singular hypersurface $\\{r=0\\}$ at a single sphere, we study the problem of\nperturbing the Schwarzschild data on $\\Sigma_0$ and solving the Einstein vacuum\nequations backwards in time. We obtain a local well-posedness result for small\nperturbations lying in certain weighted Sobolev spaces. No symmetry assumptions\nare imposed. The perturbed spacetimes all have a singularity at a \"collapsed\"\nsphere on $\\Sigma_0$, where the leading asymptotics of the curvature and the\nmetric match those of their Schwarzschild counterparts to a suitably high\norder. As in the Schwarzschild backward evolution, the pinched initial\nhypersurface $\\Sigma_0$ `opens up' instantly, becoming a smooth spacelike\n(cylindrical) hypersurface. This result thus yields classes of examples of\nnon-symmetric vacuum spacetimes, evolving forward-in-time from smooth initial\ndata, which form a Schwarzschild type singularity at a collapsed sphere. We\nrely on a precise asymptotic analysis of the Schwarzschild geometry near the\nsingularity which turns out to be at the threshold that our energy methods can\nhandle.\n", "  Insects use flight muscles attached at the base of the wings to produce\nimpressive wing flapping frequencies. The maximum power output of these flight\nmuscles is insufficient to maintain such wing oscillations unless there is good\nelastic storage of energy in the insect flight system. Here, we explore the\nintrinsic self-oscillatory behavior of an insectile wing model, consisting of\ntwo rigid wings connected at their base by an elastic torsional spring. We\nstudy the wings behavior as a function of the total energy and spring\nstiffness. Three types of behavior are identified: end-over-end rotation,\nchaotic motion, and periodic flapping. Interestingly, the region of periodic\nflapping decreases as energy increases but is favored as stiffness increases.\nThese findings are consistent with the fact that insect wings and flight\nmuscles are stiff. They further imply that, by adjusting their muscle stiffness\nto the desired energy level, insects can maintain periodic flapping\nmechanically for a range of operating conditions.\n", "  In this paper we describe a simple numerical approach which allows to study\nthe structure of steady-state axisymmetric relativistic jets using\none-dimensional time-dependent simulations. It is based on the fact that for\nnarrow jets with v~c the steady-state equations of relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics can be accurately approximated by the one-dimensional\ntime-dependent equations after the substitution z=ct. Since only the\ntime-dependent codes are now publicly available this is a valuable and\nefficient alternative to the development of a high-specialized code for the\ntime-independent equations. The approach is also much cheaper and more robust\ncompared to the relaxation method. We tested this technique against numerical\nand analytical solutions found in literature as well as solutions we obtained\nusing the relaxation method and found it sufficiently accurate. In the process,\nwe discovered the reason for the failure of the self-similar analytical model\nof the jet reconfinement in relatively flat atmospheres and elucidated the\nnature of radial oscillations of steady-state jets.\n", "  We propose a modified gravitational action containing besides the\nEinstein-Cartan term some quadratic contributions resembling the Yang-Mills\nlagrangian for the Lorentz spin connections. We outline how a propagating\ntorsion arises and we solve explicitly the linearised equations of motion on a\nMinkowski background. We identify among torsion components six degrees of\nfreedom: one is carried by a pseudo-scalar particle, five by a tachyon field.\nBy adding spinor fields and neglecting backreaction on the geometry, we point\nout how only the pseudo-scalar particle couples directly with fermions, but the\nresulting coupling constant is suppressed by the ratio between fermion and\nPlanck masses. Including backreaction, we demonstrate how the tachyon field\nprovides causality violation in the matter sector, via an interaction mediated\nby gravitational waves.\n", "  Three-dimensional linear spin-wave eigenmodes of a Permalloy disk having\nfinite thickness are studied by micromagnetic simulations based on the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The eigenmodes found in the simulations are\ninterpreted as linear superpositions (hybridizations) of 'approximate'\nthree-dimensional eigenmodes, which are the fundamental gyromode $G_0$, the\nspin-wave modes and the higher-order gyromodes $G_N$ (flexure modes), the\nthickness dependence of which is represented by perpendicular standing spin\nwaves. This hybridization leads to new and surprising dependencies of the mode\nfrequencies on the disk thickness. The three-dimensional character of the\neigenmodes is essential to explain the recent experimental results on\nvortex-core reversal observed in relatively thick Permalloy disks.\n", "  The nature of the cubic-like state in the lead-free piezoelectric ceramics\n0.5K0.5Na0.5NbO3-0.5Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (KNN-50BNT) has been examined in detail by\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction (SD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED),\nneutron diffraction (ND), and temperature dependent dielectric\ncharacterization. The SD pattern of KNN-50BNT presents a pure perovskite\nstructure with pseudocubic symmetry. However, superlattice reflections were\nobserved by SAED and completely indexed by tetragonal symmetry with P4bm space\ngroup in ND pattern. The relaxor behavior of KNN-50BNT is compared with\nPb-based and Ba-based relaxors and discussed in the framework of the\nVogel-Fulcher law and the new glass model. The KNN-50BNT ceramic exhibits the\nstrongest dielectric dispersion among them.\n", "  We examine the concept of black hole thermodynamic volume and its consistency\nwith thermodynamic mass in spacetimes that are not asymptotically flat but\ninstead have anisotropic Lifshitz scaling symmetry. We find that the\ngeneralized Smarr relation in anti de Sitter space -- extended to include a\npressure-volume term -- holds here as well, and that there exists a definition\nof thermodynamic mass and thermodynamic volume that satisfy both this relation\nand the $1^{st}$ law of thermodynamics. We compare the thermodynamic mass with\nother known quantities such as ADM, Brown-York and Hollands-Ishibashi-Marolf\nmasses. We also conjecture methods for obtaining a thermodynamic mass where\nthere is ambiguity due to the cosmological constant lengthscale depending on\nthe horizon radius lengthscale.\n", "  We present an open-source Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code\nthat calculates the abundances of gaseous molecular species. The code is based\non the methodology of White et al. (1958) and Eriksson (1971). It applies Gibbs\nfree-energy minimization using an iterative, Lagrangian optimization scheme.\nGiven elemental abundances, TEA calculates molecular abundances for a\nparticular temperature and pressure or a list of temperature-pressure pairs. We\ntested the code against the method of Burrows & Sharp (1999), the free\nthermochemical equilibrium code CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications),\nand the example given by White et al. (1958). Using their thermodynamic data,\nTEA reproduces their final abundances, but with higher precision. We also\napplied the TEA abundance calculations to models of several hot-Jupiter\nexoplanets, producing expected results. TEA is written in Python in a modular\nformat. There is a start guide, a user manual, and a code document in addition\nto this theory paper. TEA is available under a reproducible-research,\nopen-source license via https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA.\n", "  This paper presents a 3D mesh adaptivity strategy on unstructured tetrahedral\nmeshes by a posteriori error estimates based on metrics, studied on the case of\na nonlinear finite element minimization scheme for the Landau-de Gennes free\nenergy functional of nematic liquid crystals. Newton's iteration for tensor\nfields is employed with steepest descent method possibly stepping in.\n  Aspects relating the driving of mesh adaptivity within the nonlinear scheme\nare considered. The algorithmic performance is found to depend on at least two\nfactors: when to trigger each single mesh adaptation, and the precision of the\ncorrelated remeshing. Each factor is represented by a parameter, with its\nvalues possibly varying for every new mesh adaptation. We empirically show that\nthe time of the overall algorithm convergence can vary considerably when\ndifferent sequences of parameters are used, thus posing a question about\noptimality.\n  The extensive testings and debugging done within this work on the simulation\nof systems of nematic colloids substantially contributed to the upgrade of an\nopen source finite element-oriented programming language to its 3D meshing\npossibilities, as also to an outer 3D remeshing module.\n", "  We consider isotropic $XY$ spin chains whose magnetic potentials are\nquasiperiodic and the effective one-particle Hamiltonians have absolutely\ncontinuous spectra. For a wide class of such $XY$ spin chains, we obtain lower\nbounds on their Lieb--Robinson velocities in terms of group velocities of their\neffective Hamiltonians: $\\mathfrak v\\ge\\mathrm{ess\\,sup}_{[0,1]}\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\frac{dE}{dN},$ where $E$ is considered as a function of the\nintegrated density of states.\n", "  There is ample evidence from rotation curves that dark matter halos around\ndisk galaxies have nontrivial dynamics. Of particular significance are: a) the\ncored dark matter profile of disk galaxies, b) correlations of the shape of\nrotation curves with baryonic properties, and c) Tully-Fisher relations. Dark\nmatter halos around disk galaxies may have nontrivial dynamics if dark matter\nis strongly self interacting and dissipative. Multicomponent hidden sector dark\nmatter featuring a massless `dark photon' (from an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge\ninteraction) which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon provides a\nconcrete example of such dark matter. The kinetic mixing interaction\nfacilitates halo heating by enabling ordinary supernovae to be a source of\nthese `dark photons'. Dark matter halos can expand and contract in response to\nthe heating and cooling processes, but for a sufficiently isolated halo could\nhave evolved to a steady state or `equilibrium' configuration where heating and\ncooling rates locally balance. This dynamics allows the dark matter density\nprofile to be related to the distribution of ordinary supernovae in the disk of\na given galaxy. In a previous paper a simple and predictive formula was derived\nencoding this relation. Here we improve on previous work by modelling the\nsupernovae distribution via the measured UV and $H\\alpha$ fluxes, and compare\nthe resulting dark matter halo profiles with the rotation curve data for each\ndwarf galaxy in the LITTLE THINGS sample. The dissipative dark matter concept\nis further developed and some conclusions drawn.\n", "  This paper analyses the GW method for finite electronic systems. In a first\nstep, we provide a mathematical framework for the usual one-body operators that\nappear naturally in many-body perturbation theory. We then discuss the GW\nequations which construct an approximation of the one-body Green's function,\nand give a rigorous mathematical formulation of these equations. Finally, we\nstudy the well-posedness of the GW0 equations, proving the existence of a\nunique solution to these equations in a perturbative regime.\n", "  In this work we present 3D numerical relativity simulations of thick\naccretion disks around tilted Kerr BH. We investigate the evolution of three\ndifferent initial disk models with a range of initial black hole spin\nmagnitudes and tilt angles. For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,\nneglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background\nblack hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models\nare unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those\nPP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles\nconsidered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust\nfeature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile\nwe observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong\noscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk. This effect\nmight be connected to the development of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Our\nsimulations also confirm earlier findings that the development of the PP\ninstability causes the long-term emission of large amplitude gravitational\nwaves, predominantly for the l=m=2 multipole mode. The imprint of the BH\nprecession on the gravitational waves from tilted BH-torus systems remains an\ninteresting open issue that would require significantly longer simulations than\nthose presented in this work.\n", "  We develop the kinetic theory of dilute cohesive granular gases in which the\nattractive part is described by a square well potential. We derive the\nhydrodynamic equations from the kinetic theory with the microscopic expressions\nfor the dissipation rate and the transport coefficients. We check the validity\nof our theory by performing the direct simulation Monte Carlo.\n", "  We consider conformal field theories with slightly broken higher spin\nsymmetry in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. We analyze the crossing equation in\nthe double light-cone limit and solve for the anomalous dimensions of higher\nspin currents $\\gamma_s$ with large spin $s$. The result depends on the\nsymmetries and the spectrum of the unperturbed conformal field theory. We\nreproduce all known results and make further predictions. In particular we make\na prediction for the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in the 3d\nIsing model.\n", "  We apply the soft wall holographic model from hadron physics to a description\nof the high-$T_c$ superconductivity. In comparison with the existing bottom-up\nholographic superconductors, the proposed approach is more phenomenological. On\nthe other hand, it is much simpler and has more freedom for fitting the\nconductivity properties of the real high-$T_c$ materials. We demonstrate some\nexamples of emerging models and discuss a possible origin of the approach.\n", "  We study a certain family of finite-dimensional simple representations over\nquantum affine superalgebras associated to general linear Lie superalgebras,\nthe so-called fundamental representations: the denominators of rational\n$R$-matrices between two fundamental representations are computed; a cyclicity\n(and so simplicity) condition on tensor products of fundamental representations\nis proved.\n", "  We study the fundamental limits on learning latent community structure in\ndynamic networks. Specifically, we study dynamic stochastic block models where\nnodes change their community membership over time, but where edges are\ngenerated independently at each time step. In this setting (which is a special\ncase of several existing models), we are able to derive the detectability\nthreshold exactly, as a function of the rate of change and the strength of the\ncommunities. Below this threshold, we claim that no algorithm can identify the\ncommunities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal in\nthe sense that they succeed all the way down to this limit. The first uses\nbelief propagation (BP), which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and the\nsecond is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the BP\nequations. We verify our analytic and algorithmic results via numerical\nsimulation, and close with a brief discussion of extensions and open questions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the RG flow in the non-linear sigma models obtained\nfrom a 2d N=(0,2) supersymmetric QCD. The sigma model is parameterized by a\nsingle Kahler modulus. We determine its exact non-perturbative beta function\nusing holomorphy, triality and the knowledge of the infra-red fixed point.\n", "  We propose a mechanism for testing the theory of collapse models such as\ncontinuous spontaneous localization (CSL) by examining the parametric heating\nrate of a trapped nanosphere. The random localizations of the centre-of-mass\nfor a given particle predicted by the CSL model can be understood as a\nstochastic force embodying a source of heating for the nanosphere. We show that\nby utilising a Paul trap to levitate the particle and optical cooling, it is\npossible to reduce environmental decoherence to such a level that CSL dominates\nthe dynamics and contributes the main source of heating. We show that this\napproach allows measurements to be made on the timescale of seconds, and that\nthe free parameter $\\lambda_{\\rm CSL}$ which characterises the model ought to\nbe testable to values as low as $10^{-12}$ Hz.\n", "  A systematic study of fractional revival at two sites in $XX$ quantum spin\nchains is presented and analytic models with this phenomenon are exhibited. The\ngeneric models have two essential parameters and a revival time that does not\ndepend on the length of the chain. They are obtained by combining two basic\nways of realizing fractional revival in a spin chain each bringing one\nparameter. The first proceeds through isospectral deformations of spin chains\nwith perfect state transfer. The second arises from the recurrence coefficients\nof the para-Krawtchouk polynomials with a bi-lattice orthogonality grid. It\ncorresponds to an analytic model previously identified that can possess perfect\nstate transfer in addition to fractional revival.\n", "  We point out that in the early universe, for temperatures in the approximate\ninterval 175-80 MeV (after the quark-gluon plasma), pions carried a large share\nof the entropy and supported the largest inhomogeneities. Thus, we examine the\nproduction of entropy in a pion gas, particularizing to inhomogeneities of the\ntemperature, for which we benefit from the known thermal conductivity. We\nfinally put that entropy produced in relaxing such thermal inhomogeneities in\nthe broad context of this relatively unexplored phase of early-universe\ncosmology.\n", "  For a large class of scalar-tensor-like modified gravity whose action\ncontains nonminimal couplings between a scalar field $\\phi(x^\\alpha)$ and\ngeneric curvature invariants $\\mathcal{R}$ beyond the Ricci scalar\n$R=R^\\alpha_{\\;\\;\\alpha}$, we prove the covariant invariance of its field\nequation and confirm/prove the local energy-momentum conservation. These\n$\\phi(x^\\alpha)-\\mathcal{R}$ coupling terms break the symmetry of\ndiffeomorphism invariance under a particle transformation, which implies that\nthe solutions of the field equation should satisfy the consistency condition\n$\\mathcal{R}\\equiv 0$ when $\\phi(x^\\alpha)$ is nondynamical and massless.\nFollowing this fact and based on the accelerated expansion of the observable\nUniverse, we propose a primary test to check the viability of the modified\ngravity to be an effective dark energy, and a simplest example passing the test\nis the \"Weyl/conformal dark energy\".\n", "  Knotted and tangled structures frequently appear in physical fields, but so\ndo mechanisms for untying them. To understand how this untying works, we\nsimulate the behavior of 1,458 superfluid vortex knots of varying complexity\nand scale in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Without exception, we find that the\nknots untie efficiently and completely, and do so within a predictable time\nrange. We also observe that the centerline helicity -- a measure of knotting\nand writhing -- is partially preserved even as the knots untie. Moreover, we\nfind that the topological pathways of untying knots have simple descriptions in\nterms of minimal 2D knot diagrams, and tend to concentrate in states along\nspecific maximally chiral pathways.\n", "  The physics beyond the Standard Model with parameters of the compressed\nspectrum is well motivated both in a theory side and with phenomenological\nreasons, especially related to dark matter phenomenology. In this letter, we\npropose a method to tag soft final state particles from a decaying process of a\nnew particle in this parameter space. By taking a supersymmetric gluino search\nas an example, we demonstrate how the Large Hadron Collider experimental\ncollaborations can improve a sensitivity in these non-trivial search regions.\n", "  Using a data sample of 6.8 pb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMD-3 detector at the\nVEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider we select about 2700 events of the $e^+e^- \\to\np\\bar{p}$ process and measure its cross section at 12 energy ponts with about\n6\\% systematic uncertainty. From the angular distribution of produced nucleons\nwe obtain the ratio $|G_{E}/G_{M}| = 1.49 \\pm 0.23 \\pm 0.30$.\n", "  We have calculated the temperature dependence of shear $\\eta$ and bulk\n$\\zeta$ viscosities of quark matter due to quark-meson fluctuations. The quark\nthermal width originating from quantum fluctuations of quark-$\\pi$ and\nquark-$\\sigma$ loops at finite temperature is calculated with the formalism of\nreal-time thermal field theory. Temperature-dependent constituent-quark and\nmeson masses, and quark-meson couplings are obtained in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. We found a non-trivial influence of the temperature-dependent masses and\ncouplings on the Landau-cut structure of the quark self-energy. Our results for\nthe ratios $\\eta/s$ and $\\zeta/s$, where $s$ is the entropy density (also\ndetermined in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in the quasi-particle\napproximation), are in fair agreement with results of the literature obtained\nfrom different models and techniques. In particular, our result for $\\eta/s$\nhas a minimum very close to the conjectured AdS/CFT lower bound, $\\eta/s =\n1/4\\pi$.\n", "  Theoretical progress on the formulation and classification of the quark and\ngluon orbital angular momenta (OAM) is reviewed. Their relation to parton\ndistributions and open questions and puzzles are discussed. We give a status\nreport on the lattice calculation of the parton kinetic and canonical OAM and\npoint out several strategies to calculate the quark and gluon canonical OAM on\nthe lattice.\n", "  The possibility that the 125 GeV Higgs boson may decay into invisible\nnon-standard-model (non-SM) particles is theoretically and phenomenologically\nintriguing. In this letter we investigate the sensitivity of the Large Hadron\nElectron Collider (LHeC) to an invisibly decaying Higgs, in its proposed high\nluminosity running mode. We focus on the neutral current Higgs production\nchannel which offers more kinematical handles than its charged current\ncounterpart. The signal contains one electron, one jet and large missing\nenergy. With a cut-based parton level analysis, we estimate that if the $hZZ$\ncoupling is at its standard model (SM) value, then assuming an integrated\nluminosity of $1\\,\\mbox{ab}^{-1}$ the LHeC with the proposed 60 GeV electron\nbeam (with $-0.9$ polarization) and 7 TeV proton beam is capable of probing\n$\\mathrm{Br}(h\\rightarrow E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T)=6\\%$ at $2\\sigma$ level. Good lepton\nveto performance (especially hadronic $\\tau$ veto) in the forward region is\ncrucial to the suppression of the dominant $Wje$ background. We also explicitly\npoint out the important role that may be played by the LHeC in probing a wide\nclass of exotic Higgs decay processes and emphasize the general function of\nlepton-hadron colliders in precision study of new resonances after their\ndiscovery in hadron-hadron collisions.\n", "  Recently, the quantum spin Hall effect has been predicted in (111)-oriented\nthin films of SnSe and SnTe topological crystalline insulators. It was shown\nthat in these films the energy gaps in the two-dimensional band spectrum depend\nin an oscillatory fashion on the layer thickness -- the calculated topological\ninvariant indexes and edge state spin polarizations show that for films 20-40\nmonolayers thick a two-dimensional topological insulator phase appears. Edge\nstates with Dirac cones with opposite spin polarization in their two branches\nare obtained for both materials. However, for all but the (111)-oriented SnTe\nfilms with an even number of monolayers an overlapping of bands in\n$\\overline{\\Gamma}$ and $\\overline{\\mathrm{M}}$ diminishes the final band gap\nand the edge states appear either against the background of the bands or within\na very small energy gap. Here we show that this problem in SnSe films can be\nremoved by applying an appropriate strain. This should enable observation of\nthe Quantum Spin Hall effect also in SnSe layers.\n", "  A recently proposed model of social interaction in voting is investigated by\nsimplifying it down into a version that is more analytically tractable and\nwhich allows a mathematical analysis to be performed. This analysis clarifies\nthe interplay of the different elements present in the system --- social\ninfluence, heterogeneity and noise --- and leads to a better understanding of\nits properties. The origin of a regime of bistability is identified. The\ninsight gained in this way gives further intuition into the behaviour of the\noriginal model.\n", "  Simulated and parallel tempering are families of Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithms where a temperature parameter is varied during the simulation to\novercome bottlenecks to convergence due to multimodality.\n  In this work we introduce and analyze the convergence for a set of new\ntempering distributions which we call \\textit{entropy dampening}. For\nasymmetric exponential distributions and the mean field Ising model with and\nexternal field simulated tempering is known to converge slowly. We show that\ntempering with entropy dampening distributions mixes in polynomial time for\nthese models.\n  Examining slow mixing times of tempering more closely, we show that for the\nmean-field 3-state ferromagnetic Potts model, tempering converges slowly\nregardless of the temperature schedule chosen. On the other hand, tempering\nwith entropy dampening distributions converges in polynomial time to\nstationarity. Finally we show that the slow mixing can be very expensive\npractically. In particular, the mixing time of simulated tempering is an\nexponential factor longer than the mixing time at the fixed temperature.\n", "  We develop a classical microscopic model of a dielectric. The model features\nnonlinear interaction terms between polarizable dipoles and lattice vibrations.\nThe lattice vibrations are found to act as a pseudo-reservoir, giving broadband\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation without the addition of damping terms\nin the dynamics. The effective permittivity is calculated using a perturbative\niteration method and is found to have the form associated with real\ndielectrics. Spatial dispersion is naturally included in the model and we also\ncalculate the wavevector dependence of the permittivity.\n", "  Three-dimensional convex bodies can be classified in terms of the number and\nstability types of critical points on which they can balance at rest on a\nhorizontal plane. For typical bodies these are nondegenerate maxima, minima,\nand saddle-points, the numbers of which provide a primary classification.\nSecondary and tertiary classifications use graphs to describe orbits connecting\nthese critical points in the gradient vector field associated with each body.\nIn previous work it was shown that these classifications are complete in that\nno class is empty. Here we construct 1- and 2-parameter families of convex\nbodies connecting members of adjacent primary and secondary classes and show\nthat transitions between them can be realized by codimension 1 saddle-node and\nsaddle-saddle (heteroclinic) bifurcations in the gradient vector fields. Our\nresults indicate that all combinatorially possible transitions can be realized\nin physical shape evolution processes, e.g. by abrasion of sedimentary\nparticles.\n", "  Testable predictions of quantum mechanics are invariant under time reversal.\nBut the change of the quantum state in time is not so, neither in the collapse\nnor in the no-collapse interpretations of the theory. This fact challenges the\nrealistic interpretation of the quantum state. On the other hand, this fact\nfollows easily if we interpret the quantum state as a mere calculation device,\nbookkeeping past real quantum events. The same conclusion follows from the\nanalysis of the meaning of the wave function in the semiclassical regime.\n", "  We study the constraints of the generic two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM)\ntype-III and the impacts of the new Yukawa couplings. For comparisons, we\nrevisit the analysis in the 2HDM type-II. To understand the influence of all\ninvolving free parameters and to realize their correlations, we employ\n$\\chi$-square fitting approach by including theoretical and experimental\nconstraints, such as S, T, and U oblique parameters, the production of standard\nmodel Higgs and its decay to $\\gamma\\gamma$, $WW^*/ZZ^*$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, etc.\nThe errors of analysis are taken at $68\\%$, $95.5\\%$, and $99.7\\%$ confidence\nlevels. Due to the new Yukawa couplings being associated with\n$\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)$ and $\\sin(\\beta -\\alpha)$, we find that the allowed\nregions for $\\sin\\alpha$ and $\\tan\\beta$ in the type-III model can be broader\nwhen the dictated parameter $\\chi_F$ is positive; however, for negative\n$\\chi_F$, the limits are stricter than those in the type-II model. By using the\nconstrained parameters, we find that the deviation from the SM in the $h\\to\nZ\\gamma$ can be of ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$. Additionally, we also study the top-quark\nflavor-changing processes induced at the tree level in the type-III model and\nfind that when all current experimental data are considered, we get $Br(t\\to\nc(h, H) )< 10^{-3}$ for $m_h=125.36$ and $m_H=150$ GeV and $Br(t\\to cA)$\nslightly exceeds $10^{-3}$ for $m_A =130$ GeV.\n", "  We consider the problem of testing multiple quantum hypotheses\n$\\{\\rho_1^{\\otimes n},\\ldots,\\rho_r^{\\otimes n}\\}$, where an arbitrary prior\ndistribution is given and each of the $r$ hypotheses is $n$ copies of a quantum\nstate. It is known that the average error probability $P_e$ decays\nexponentially to zero, that is, $P_e=\\exp\\{-\\xi n+o(n)\\}$. However, this error\nexponent $\\xi$ is generally unknown, except for the case that $r=2$.\n  In this paper, we solve the long-standing open problem of identifying the\nabove error exponent, by proving Nussbaum and Szko\\l a's conjecture that\n$\\xi=\\min_{i\\neq j}C(\\rho_i,\\rho_j)$. The right-hand side of this equality is\ncalled the multiple quantum Chernoff distance, and\n$C(\\rho_i,\\rho_j):=\\max_{0\\leq s\\leq\n1}\\{-\\log\\operatorname{Tr}\\rho_i^s\\rho_j^{1-s}\\}$ has been previously\nidentified as the optimal error exponent for testing two hypotheses,\n$\\rho_i^{\\otimes n}$ versus $\\rho_j^{\\otimes n}$.\n  The main ingredient of our proof is a new upper bound for the average error\nprobability, for testing an ensemble of finite-dimensional, but otherwise\ngeneral, quantum states. This upper bound, up to a states-dependent factor,\nmatches the multiple-state generalization of Nussbaum and Szko\\l a's lower\nbound. Specialized to the case $r=2$, we give an alternative proof to the\nachievability of the binary-hypothesis Chernoff distance, which was originally\nproved by Audenaert et al.\n", "  We show that studying of low-frequency internal friction (LFIF) of solid\nsamples at low temperatures allows determining the presence of various gases\nabsorbed, for some reasons, in pores and caverns of the solids. The gases come\nover to a solid state (cryocrystals) and exist in the pores under corresponding\nthermodynamic conditions giving an additional contribution to the LFIF spectra.\nThe spectra reflect the special points of the gases (temperatures of melting or\nphase transitions). This information gives a real opportunity for\nidentification of gas in the matrix, i.e. the studied solids. This may be of\ngreat importance for investigations of cosmic or geological samples, for\ninstance, asteroids, meteorites, rock formations, etc. The LFIF method allows\nidentification of gas media surrounding the studied sample.\n", "  We study the associated production of a charged Higgs boson with a bottom\nquark and a light quark at the LHC via p p \\to H^\\pm\\,b\\,j in the Two Higgs\nDoublet Models (2HDMs). Using the effective W approximation, we show that there\nis exact cancellation among various Feynman diagrams in high energy limit. This\nmay imply that the production of charged Higgs can be significantly enhanced in\nthe presence of large mass differences among the neutral Higgs bosons via\nW^\\pm-Higgs fusion in the p p \\to H^\\pm\\,b\\,j process. Particularly, we\nemphasize the potential enhancement due to a light pseudoscalar boson $A$,\nwhich is still allowed by the current data by which we explicitly calculate the\nallowed regions in (M_A,\\,\\tan\\beta) plane, and show that the production cross\nsection can be as large as 0.1 pb for large $\\tan\\beta$. We also show that the\ntransverse momentum distribution of the b quark can potentially distinguish the\nW^\\pm-A fusion diagram from the top diagram. Finally, we point out further\nenhancement when we go beyond the 2HDMs.\n", "  We discuss with a rather critical eye the current situation of black hole\n(BH) solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and shed light about its geometrical and\nphysical significance. We also argue about the meaning, existence or lack\nthereof of a Birkhoff's theorem in this kind of modified gravity. We focus then\non the analysis and quest of $non-trivial$ (i.e. hairy)\n$asymptotically\\,\\,flat$ (AF) BH solutions in static and spherically symmetric\n(SSS) spacetimes in vacuum having the property that the Ricci scalar does $not$\nvanish identically in the domain of outer communication. To do so, we provide\nand enforce the $regularity\\,\\,conditions$ at the horizon in order to prevent\nthe presence of singular solutions there. Specifically, we consider several\nclasses of $f(R)$ models like those proposed recently for explaining the\naccelerated expansion in the universe and which have been thoroughly tested in\nseveral physical scenarios. Finally, we report analytical and numerical\nevidence about the $absence$ of $geometric\\,\\,hair$ in AFSSSBH solutions in\nthose $f(R)$ models. First, we submit the models to the available no-hair\ntheorems, and in the cases where the theorems apply, the absence of hair is\ndemonstrated analytically. In the cases where the theorems do not apply, we\nresort to a numerical analysis due to the complexity of the non-linear\ndifferential equations. Within that aim, a code to solve the equations\nnumerically was built and tested using well know exact solutions. In a future\ninvestigation we plan to analyze the problem of hair in De Sitter and Anti-De\nSitter backgrounds.\n", "  We extend the concepts of quantum complete synchronization and phase\nsynchronization, which are proposed firstly in [Phys. Rev. Lett, 111 103605\n(2013)], to more widespread quantum generalized synchronization. The\ngeneralized synchronization can be considered as a necessary condition or a\nmore flexible derivative of complete synchronization, and its criterion and\nsynchronization measurement are further proposed and analyzed in this paper. As\nan example, we consider two typical generalized synchronizations in a designed\noptomechanical system. Unlike the effort to construct a special coupling\nsynchronization system, we purposefully design extra control fields based on\nLyapunov control theory. We find that the Lyapunov function can adapt to more\nflexible control objectives, which is more suitable for generalized\nsynchronization control, and the control fields can be achieved simply with a\ntime-variant voltage. Finally, the existence of quantum entanglement in\ndifferent generalized synchronizations is also discussed.\n", "  We present the results of magnetization and magneto-transport measurements in\nthe superconducting state of an as-cast Nb$_{75}$Zr$_{25}$ alloy. We also\nreport the careful investigation of the microstructure of our sample at various\nlength scales by using optical, scanning electron and transmission electron\nmicroscopies. The information of microstructure is used to understand the flux\npinning properties in the superconducting state within the framework of\ncollective pinning. The magneto-transport measurements show a non-Arrhenius\nbehaviour of the temperature and field dependent resistivity in the flux flow\nregion. This non-Arrhenius behaviour is understood in terms of a model, which\nwas originally proposed for viscous flow of disordered solids and is popularly\nknown in the literature as the `shoving' model. The activation energy for flux\nflow is obtained from magneto-transport measurements and is assumed to be\nmainly the elastic energy stored in the flux-line lattice. The scaling of\npinning force density with respect to reduced field indicates the presence of\ntwo pinning mechanisms of different origins. The elastic constants of the\nflux-line lattice are estimated from magnetization measurements and are used to\nestimate the length scale of vortex lattice movement, or the volume displaced\nby the flux-line lattice, during flux flow. It appears that the vortex lattice\ndisplacement estimated from elastic energy considerations is of the same order\nof magnitude as that of the flux-bundle hopping length when a finite resistance\nappears during flux flow. Our results could provide possible directions for\nestablishing a framework where vortex matter and glass forming liquids or\namorphous solids can be treated in a similar manner for understanding the\nphenomenon of viscous flow in disordered solids or more generally the pinning\nand depinning properties of elastic manifolds in random media.\n", "  It is well known that a planar central configuration of the $n$-body problem\ngives rise to solutions where each particle moves on a specific Keplerian orbit\nwhile the totality of the particles move on a homographic motion. When the\neccentricity $e$ of the Keplerian orbit belongs in $[0,1)$, following Meyer and\nSchmidt, we call such solutions elliptic relative equilibria (shortly, ERE). In\norder to study the linear stability of ERE in the near-collision case, namely\nwhen $1-e$ is small enough, we introduce the collision index for planar central\nconfigurations. The collision index is a Maslov-type index for heteroclinic\norbits and orbits parametrised by half-lines that, according to the Definition\ngiven by authors in [16], we shall refer to as half-clinic orbits and whose\nDefinition in this context, is essentially based on a blow up technique in the\ncase $e=1$. We get the fundamental properties of collision index and\napproximation theorems. As applications, we give some new hyperbolic criteria\nand prove that, generically, the ERE of minimal central configurations are\nhyperbolic in the near-collision case, and we give detailed analysis of Euler\ncollinear orbits in the near-collision case.\n", "  We extend the standard model to a scalar-assisted vector-like fermion model\nto realize electroweak baryogenesis. The extended Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix, due to the mixing among the vector-like quark and the standard model\nquarks, provides additional sources of the CP violation. Together with the\nenhancement from large vector-like quark mass, a large enough baryon-to-photon\nratio could be obtained. The strongly first-order phase transition could be\nrealized via the potential barrier which separate the broken minimum and the\nsymmetric minimum in the scalar potential. We investigate in detail the\none-loop temperature-dependent effective potential, and perform a random\nparameter scan to study the allowed parameter region that satisfies the\nstrongly first order phase transition criteria $v_c \\ge T_c$. Several distinct\npatterns of phase transition are classified and discussed. Among these\npatterns, large trilinear mass term between the Higgs boson and the scalar is\npreferred, for it controls the width of the potential barrier. Our results\nindicate large quartic scalar couplings, and moderate mixing angle between the\nHiggs boson and the new scalar. This parameter region could be further explored\nat the Run 2 LHC.\n", "  We prove rapid mixing of the worm process for the zero-field ferromagnetic\nIsing model, on all finite connected graphs, and at all temperatures. As a\ncorollary, we obtain a fully-polynomial randomized approximation scheme for the\nIsing susceptibility, and for a certain restriction of the two-point\ncorrelation function\n", "  Flows of hard granular materials depend strongly on the interparticle\nfriction coefficient $\\mu_p$ and on the inertial number ${\\cal I}$, which\ncharacterizes proximity to the jamming transition where flow stops. Guided by\nnumerical simulations, we derive the phase diagram of dense inertial flow of\nspherical particles, finding three regimes for $10^{-4} \\lesssim {\\cal I}\n\\lesssim 10^{-1}$: \\textit{ frictionless, frictional sliding, } and {\\it\nrolling}. These are distinguished by the dominant means of energy dissipation,\nchanging from collisional to sliding friction, and back to collisional, as\n$\\mu_p$ increases from zero at constant ${\\cal I}$. The three regimes differ in\ntheir kinetics and rheology; in particular, the velocity fluctuations and the\nstress ratio both display non-monotonic behavior with $\\mu_p$, corresponding to\ntransitions between the three regimes of flow. We rationalize { the phase\nboundaries between these regimes}, show that energy balance yields scaling\nrelations { between microscopic properties} in each of them, and { derive the\nstrain scale at which particles lose memory of their velocity. For the\nfrictional sliding regime most relevant experimentally, we find for ${\\cal\nI}\\geq 10^{-2.5}$ that the growth of the macroscopic friction $\\mu({\\cal I})$\nwith ${\\cal I}$ is induced by an increase of collisional dissipation. This\nimplies in that range that $\\mu({\\cal I})-\\mu(0)\\sim {\\cal I}^{1-2b}$, where\n$b\\approx 0.2$ is an exponent that characterizes both the dimensionless\nvelocity fluctuations ${\\cal L}\\sim {\\cal I}^{-b}$ and the density of sliding\ncontacts $\\chi\\sim {\\cal I}^b$.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of a higher-order cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation is\nfound to include a wide range of scenarios due to the interplay of higher-order\nphysically relevant terms. We find that the competition between the third-order\ndispersion and stimulated Raman scattering effects, gives rise to rich\ndynamics: this extends from Poincar\\'{e}-Bendixson--type scenarios, in the\nsense that bounded solutions may converge either to distinct equilibria via\norbital connections, or space-time periodic solutions, to the emergence of\nalmost periodic and chaotic behavior. One of our main results is that the\nthird-order dispersion has a dominant role in the development of such complex\ndynamics, since it can be chiefly responsible (i.e., even in the absence of the\nother higher-order effects) for the existence of the periodic, quasi-periodic\nand chaotic spatiotemporal structures. Suitable low-dimensional phase space\ndiagnostics are devised and used to illustrate the different possibilities and\nidentify their respective parametric intervals over multiple parameters of the\nmodel.\n", "  In this note we consider ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM theories in 2+1 dimensions with\ngauge group $U(N)\\times U(M)$ and $k$ hypermultiplets charged under the $U(N)$.\nWhen $k > 2(N-M)$, the theory flows to a superconformal fixed point in the IR.\nTheories with $k <2(N-M)$, on the other hand, flows to strong coupling. We\nexplore these theories from the perspective of gravity dual. We find that the\ngravity duals of theories with $k < (N-M)$ contain enhancons even in situations\nwhere repulson singularities are absent. We argue that supergravity description\nis unreliable in the region near these enhancon points. Instead, we show how to\nconstruct reliable sugra duals to particular points on the Coulomb branch where\nthe enhancon is screened. We explore how these singularities reappear as one\nmoves around in Coulomb branch and comment on possible field theory\ninterpretation of this phenomenon. In analyzing gauge/gravity duality for these\nmodels, we encountered one unexpected surprise, that the condition for the\nsupergravity solution to be reliable and supersymmetric is somewhat weaker than\nthe expectation from field theory. We also discuss similar issues for theories\nwith $k=0$.\n", "  I review TMD factorization and evolution theorems, with an emphasis on the\ntreatment by Collins and originating in the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS)\nformalism. I summarize basic results while attempting to trace their\ndevelopment over that past several decades.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a notion of parallel transport for principal\nbundles with connections over differentiable stacks. We show that principal\nbundles with connections over stacks can be recovered from their parallel\ntransport thereby extending the results of Barrett, Caetano and Picken, and\nSchreiber and Waldof from manifolds to stacks.\n  In the process of proving our main result we simplify Schreiber and Waldorf's\ndefinition of a transport functor for principal bundles with connections over\nmanifolds and provide a more direct proof of the correspondence between\nprincipal bundles with connections and transport functors.\n", "  We propose renormalizable models of new physics that can explain various\nanomalies observed in decays of B-mesons to electron and muon pairs. The new\nphysics states couple to linear combinations of Standard Model fermions,\nyielding a pattern of flavour violation that gives a consistent fit to the\ngamut of flavour data. Accidental symmetries prevent contributions to baryon-\nand lepton-number-violating processes, as well as enforcing a loop suppression\nof new physics contributions to flavour violating processes. Data require that\nthe new flavour-breaking couplings are largely aligned with the Yukawa\ncouplings of the SM and so we also explore patterns of flavour symmetry\nbreaking giving rise to this structure.\n", "  There has been a growing interest in realizing topologically nontrivial\nstates of matter in band insulators, where a quantum Hall effect can appear as\nan intrinsic property of the band structure. While the on-going progress is\nunder way with a number of directions, the possibility of realizing novel\ninteraction-generated topological phases, without the requirement of a\nnontrivial invariant encoded in single-particle wavefunction or band structure,\ncan significantly extend the class of topological materials and is thus of\ngreat importance. Here, we show an interaction-driven topological phase\nemerging in an extended Bose-Hubbard model on kagome lattice, where the\nnon-interacting band structure is topological trivial with zero Berry curvature\nin the Brillouin zone. By means of an unbiased state-of-the-art density-matrix\nrenormalization group technique, we identify that the groundstate in a broad\nparameter region is equivalent to a bosonic fractional quantum Hall Laughlin\nstate, based on the characterization of universal properties including\ngroundstate degeneracy, edge excitations and anyonic quasiparticle statistics.\nOur work paves a way of finding interaction induced topological phase at the\nphase boundary of conventionally ordered solid phases.\n", "  In this paper, we study a new application of the positive Grassmanian to\nWilson loop diagrams (or MHV diagrams) for scattering amplitudes in N=4 Super\nYang-Mill theory ($N=4$ SYM). There has been much interest in studying this\ntheory via the positive Grassmanians using BCFW recursion. This is the first\nattempt to study MHV diagrams for planar Wilson loop calculations (or planar\namplitudes) in terms of positive Grassmannians. We codify Wilson loop diagrams\ncompletely in terms of matroids. This allows us to apply the combinatorial\ntools in matroid theory used to identify positroids, (non-negative\nGrassmannians), to Wilson loop diagrams. In doing so, we find that certain\nnon-planar Wilson loop diagrams define positive Grassmannians. While non-planar\ndiagrams do not have physical meaning, this finding suggests that they may have\nvalue as an algebraic tool, and deserve further investigation.\n", "  We present a novel lattice calculation of the equation of state of SU(2)\nYang-Mills theory in the confining phase. We show that a gas of massive,\nnon-interacting glueballs describes remarkably well the results, provided that\na bosonic closed-string model is used to derive an exponentially growing\nHagedorn spectrum for the heavy glueball states with no free parameters. This\neffective model can be applied to SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and the theoretical\nprediction agrees nicely with the lattice results reported by Bors\\'anyi et al.\nin JHEP 07 (2012) 056.\n", "  The effective chiral Lagrangian in both nonlocal form $L_{ECCL}$ and standard\nlocal form $L_{ECL}$ are derived in QCD using the confining kernel, obtained in\nthe vacuum correlator formalism.\n  As a result all coefficients of $L_{ECL}$ can be computed via $q\\bar q$\nGreen's functions.\n  In the $p^2$ order of $L_{ECL}$ one obtains GOR relations and quark decay\nconstants $f_a$ are calculated $a=1,...8$, while in the $p^4$ order the\ncoefficients $L_1, L_2, L_3,L_4, L_5, L_6$ are obtained in good agreement with\nthe values given by data. The chiral quark model is shown to be a simple\nconsequence of $L_{ECCL}$ with defined coefficients.\n  It is demonstrated that $L_{ECCL}$ gives an extension of the limiting\nlow-energy Lagrangian $L_{ECL}$ to arbitrary momenta.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the galaxies selected from the deepest\n850-micron survey undertaken to date with SCUBA-2 on the JCMT. This deep\n850-micron imaging was taken in parallel with deep 450-micron imaging in the\nvery best observing conditions as part of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey.\nA total of 106 sources were uncovered at 850 microns from ~150, sq. arcmin in\nthe centre of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA/CANDELS field, imaged to a typical rms\ndepth of ~0.25 mJy. We utilise the wealth of available deep multi-frequency\ndata to establish the complete redshift distribution for this sample, yielding\n<z> = 2.38 +- 0.09, a mean redshift comparable with that derived for all but\nthe brightest previous sub-mm samples. We have also been able to establish the\nstellar masses of the majority of the galaxy identifications, enabling us to\nexplore their location on the star-formation-rate:stellar-mass (SFR:M*) plane.\nCrucially, our new deep sample reaches flux densities equivalent to SFR ~ 100\nMsun/yr, enabling us to confirm that sub-mm galaxies form the high-mass end of\nthe `main sequence' (MS) of star-forming galaxies at z > 1.5 (with a mean\nspecific SFR of sSFR = 2.25 +- 0.19 /Gyr at z ~ 2.5). Our results are\nconsistent with no significant flattening of the MS towards high masses at\nthese redshifts, suggesting that reports of such flattening possibly arise from\nunder-estimates of dust-enshrouded star-formation activity in massive\nstar-forming galaxies. However, our findings add to the growing evidence that\naverage sSFR rises only slowly at high redshift, resulting in log(sSFR) being\nan apparently simple linear function of the age of the Universe.\n", "  We formulate axioms of conformal theory (CT) in dimensions $>2$ modifying\nSegal's axioms for two-dimensional CFT. (In the definition of\nhigher-dimensional CFT one includes also a condition of existence of\nenergy-momentum tensor.) We use these axioms to derive the AdS/CT\ncorrespondence for local theories on AdS . We introduce a notion of weakly\nlocal quantum field theory and construct a bijective correspondence between\nconformal theories on the sphere $S^d$ and weakly local quantum field theories\non $H^{d+1}$ that are invariant with respect to isometries. (Here $H^{d+1}$\ndenotes hyperbolic space= Euclidean AdS space.) We give an expression of AdS\ncorrelation functions in terms of CT correlation functions. The conformal\ntheory has conserved energy-momentum tensor iff the AdS theory has graviton in\nits spectrum.\n", "  Shot noise, intrinsic to the ensemble of nonisochronous\nelectrons-oscillators, is the cause of statistical fluctuations in cooperative\nradiation generated by single-pass cyclotron-resonance masers (CRMs).\nAutophasing time --- the time required for the cooperative radiation power to\npeak --- is the critical parameter characterizing the dynamics of\nelectrons-oscillators interacting via the radiation field. Shot-noise related\nfluctuations of the autophasing time imposes appreciable limitations on the\npossibility of coherent summation of electromagnetic oscillations from several\nsingle-pass CRMs.\n  Premodulation of charged particles leads to a considerable narrowing of the\nautophasing time distribution function. When the number of particles $N_e$\nexceeds a certain value that depends on the degree to which the particles have\nbeen premodulated, the relative root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the\nautophasing time $\\delta_T$ changes from a logarithmic dependence on $N_e$\n($\\delta_T\\sim1/\\ln N_e$) to square-root ($\\delta_T\\sim1/\\sqrt{N_e}$). As a\nresult, there is an increased probability of coherent summation of\nelectromagnetic oscillations from several single-pass generators.\n  A slight energy spread ~($\\sim$4\\%) results in a twofold drop of the maximum\nattainable power of cooperative radiation.\n", "  We derive formalism for determining $\\textbf{2} + \\mathcal J \\to \\textbf{2}$\ninfinite-volume transition amplitudes from finite-volume matrix elements.\nSpecifically, we present a relativistic, model-independent relation between\nfinite-volume matrix elements of external currents and the physically\nobservable infinite-volume matrix elements involving two-particle asymptotic\nstates. The result presented holds for states composed of two scalar bosons.\nThese can be identical or non-identical and, in the latter case, can be either\ndegenerate or non-degenerate. We further accommodate any number of\nstrongly-coupled two-scalar channels. This formalism will, for example, allow\nfuture lattice QCD calculations of the $\\rho$-meson form factor, in which the\nunstable nature of the $\\rho$ is rigorously accommodated.\n", "  We show possibility of the Plane Couette (PC) flow instability for Reynolds\nnumber Re>Reth=140. This new result of the linear hydrodynamic stability theory\nis obtained on the base of refusal from the traditionally used assumption on\nlongitudinal periodicity of the disturbances along the direction of the fluid\nflow. We found that earlier existing understanding on the linear stability of\nthis flow for any arbitrary large Reynolds number is directly related with an\nassumption on the separation of the variables of the spatial variability for\nthe disturbance field and their periodicity in linear theory of stability. By\nthe refusal from the pointed assumptions also for the Plane Poiseuille (PP)\nflow, we get a new threshold Reynolds value Reth=1040 that with 4% accuracy\nagrees with the experiment contrary to more than 500% discrepancy for the\nearlier known estimate Reth=5772 obtained in the frame of the linear theory but\nwhen using the \"normal\" disturbance form (S. A. Orszag, 1971).\n", "  The Fermi surface is an abstract object in the reciprocal space of a crystal\nlattice, enclosing the set of all those electronic band states that are filled\naccording to the Pauli principle. Its topology is dictated by the underlying\nlattice structure and its volume is the carrier density in the material. The\nFermi surface is central to predictions of thermal, electrical, magnetic,\noptical and superconducting properties in metallic systems. Density functional\ntheory is a first-principles method used to estimate the occupied-band energies\nand, in particular, the iso-energetic Fermi surface. In this review we survey\nseveral key facts about Fermi surfaces in complex systems, where a proper\ntheoretical understanding is still lacking. We address some critical\ndifficulties.\n", "  Recent experimental and theoretical ideas are laying the ground for a new era\nin the knowledge of the parton structure of nuclei. We report on two promising\ndirections beyond inclusive deep inelastic scattering experiments, aimed at,\namong other goals, unveiling the three dimensional structure of the bound\nnucleon. The 3D structure in coordinate space can be accessed through deep\nexclusive processes, whose non-perturbative content is parametrized in terms of\ngeneralized parton distributions. In this way the distribution of partons in\nthe transverse plane will be obtained, providing a pictorial view of the\nrealization of the European Muon Collaboration effect. In particular, we show\nhow, through the generalized parton distribution framework, non nucleonic\ndegrees of freedom in nuclei can be unveiled. Analogously, the momentum space\n3D structure can be accessed by studying transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistributions in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. The status\nof measurements is also summarized, in particular novel coincidence\nmeasurements at high luminosity facilities, such as Jefferson Laboratory.\nFinally the prospects for the next years at future facilities, such as the\n12~GeV Jefferson Laboratory and the Electron Ion Collider, are presented.\n", "  Ionization injection is attractive as a controllable injection scheme for\ngenerating high quality electron beams using plasma-based wakefield\nacceleration. Due to the phase dependent tunneling ionization rate and the\ntrapping dynamics within a nonlinear wake, the discrete injection of electrons\nwithin the wake is nonlinearly mapped to discrete final phase space structure\nof the beam at the location where the electrons are trapped. This phenomenon is\ntheoretically analyzed and examined by three-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations which show that three dimensional effects limit the wave number of\nthe modulation to between $> 2k_0$ and about $5k_0$, where $k_0$ is the\nwavenumber of the injection laser. Such a nano-scale bunched beam can be\ndiagnosed through coherent transition radiation upon its exit from the plasma\nand may find use in generating high-power ultraviolet radiation upon passage\nthrough a resonant undulator.\n", "  We explore the phase structure of nonlinear sigma models with target spaces\ncorresponding to compact quotients of hyperbolic space, focusing on the case of\na hyperbolic genus-2 Riemann surface. The continuum theory of these models can\nbe approximated by a lattice spin system which we simulate using Monte Carlo\nmethods. The target space possesses interesting geometric and topological\nproperties which are reflected in novel features of the sigma model. In\nparticular, we observe a topological phase transition at a critical\ntemperature, above which vortices proliferate, reminiscent of the\nKosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the $O(2)$ model. Unlike in the $O(2)$\ncase, there are many different types of vortices, suggesting a possible analogy\nto the Hagedorn treatment of statistical mechanics of a proliferating number of\nhadron species. Below the critical temperature the spins cluster around six\nspecial points in the target space known as Weierstrass points. The diversity\nof compact hyperbolic manifolds suggests that our model is only the simplest\nexample of a broad class of statistical mechanical models whose main features\ncan be understood essentially in geometric terms.\n", "  We present the first results on the production of pseudo-scalar through gluon\nfusion at the LHC to N$^3$LO in QCD taking into account only soft gluon\neffects. We have used the effective Lagrangian that describes the coupling of\npseudo-scalar with the gluons in the large top quark mass limit. We have used\nrecently available quantities namely the three loop pseudo-scalar form factor\nand the third order universal soft function in QCD to achieve this. Along with\nthe fixed order results, we also present the process dependent resummation\ncoefficient for threshold resummation to N$^3$LL in QCD. Phenomenological\nimpact of these threshold N$^3$LO corrections to pseudo-scalar production at\nthe LHC is presented and their role to reduce the renormalisation scale\ndependence is demonstrated.\n", "  We review the status of our understanding of nucleon structure based on the\nmodelling of different kinds of parton distributions. We use the concept of\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions and Wigner\ndistributions, which combine the features of transverse-momentum dependent\nparton distributions and generalized parton distributions. We revisit various\nquark models which account for different aspects of these parton distributions.\nWe then identify applications of these distributions to gain a simple\ninterpretation of key properties of the quark and gluon dynamics in the\nnucleon.\n", "  Current interaction of massless fields in four dimensions is shown to break\nsp (8) symmetry of free massless equations of all spins down to the conformal\nsymmetry su (2,2). This breaking is in agreement with the form of nonlinear\nhigher-spin field equations.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of the current theoretical and experimental\nsituation of the anomaly in the angular distribution of $B \\to K^*(\\to\nK\\pi)\\mu^+\\mu^-$, observed at LHCb in the $1~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ dataset and\nrecently confirmed by the $3~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ dataset. The impact of this data\nand other recent measurements on $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ transitions\n($\\ell=e,\\mu$) is considered. We review the observables of interest, focusing\non their theoretical uncertainties and their sensitivity to New Physics, based\non an analysis employing the QCD factorisation approach including several\nsources of hadronic uncertainties (form factors, power corrections, charm-loop\neffects). We perform fits to New Physics contributions including experimental\nand theoretical correlations. The solution that we proposed in 2013 to solve\nthe $B\\to K^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomaly, with a contribution ${\\mathcal C}_9^{\\rm\nNP}\\simeq -1$, is confirmed and reinforced. A wider range of New-Physics\nscenarios with high significances (between 4 and 5 $\\sigma$) emerges from the\nfit, some of them being particularly relevant for model building. More data is\nneeded to discriminate among them conclusively. The inclusion of $b\\to s e^+\ne^-$ observables increases the significance of the favoured scenarios under the\nhypothesis of New Physics breaking lepton flavour universality. Several tests\nillustrate the robustness of our conclusions.\n", "  The geometry of elliptic fibrations translates to the physics of gauge\ntheories in F-theory. We systematically develop the dictionary between\narithmetic structures on elliptic curves as well as desingularized elliptic\nfibrations and symmetries of gauge theories on a circle. We show that the\nMordell-Weil group law matches integral large gauge transformations around the\ncircle in Abelian gauge theories and explain the significance of Mordell-Weil\ntorsion in this context. We also use Higgs transitions and circle large gauge\ntransformations to introduce a group law for genus-one fibrations with\nmulti-sections. Finally, we introduce a novel arithmetic structure on elliptic\nfibrations with non-Abelian gauge groups in F-theory. It is defined on the set\nof exceptional divisors resolving the singularities and divisor classes of\nsections of the fibration. This group structure can be matched with certain\nintegral non-Abelian large gauge transformations around the circle when\nstudying the theory on the lower-dimensional Coulomb branch. Its existence is\nrequired by consistency with Higgs transitions from the non-Abelian theory to\nits Abelian phases in which it becomes the Mordell-Weil group. This hints\ntowards the existence of a new underlying geometric symmetry.\n", "  We prove the connection between the Nekrasov partition function of N=2\nsuper-symmetric U(2) gauge theory with adjoint matter and conformal blocks for\nthe Virasoro algebra, as predicted by the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa relations.\nMathematically, this is achieved by relating the Carlsson-Okounkov Ext vector\nbundle on the moduli space of rank 2 sheaves with Liouville vertex\noperators.Our approach is geometric in nature, and uses a new method for\nintersection-theoretic computations of the Ext operator.\n", "  We study the energy loss rate (ELR) of the accelerated quark in terms of the\nholographic models for the two different motions, linear acceleration and\nuniform rotation. They are examined by two different non-conformal models with\nconfinement. We found in both models that the value of ELR is bounded from\nbelow by the string tension of the linear confinement potential between quark\nand anti-quark. The lower bounds of ELR are independent of the types of the\nmotion of the quark. They are determined by the string tension at the world\nsheet horizon of the model. These results are obtained when the model has the\ndiagonal background metric.\n", "  Rotation dynamics of eigenvectors of modular network adjacency matrices under\nrandom perturbations are presented. In the presence of $q$ communities, the\nnumber of eigenvectors corresponding to the $q$ largest eigenvalues form a\n\"community\" eigenspace and rotate together, but separately from that of the\n\"bulk\" eigenspace spanned by all the other eigenvectors. Using this property,\nthe number of modules or clusters in a network can be estimated in an\nalgorithm-independent way. A general argument and derivation for the\ntheoretical detectability limit for sparse modular networks with $q$\ncommunities is presented, beyond which modularity persists in the system but\ncannot be detected. It is shown that for detecting the clusters or modules\nusing the adjacency matrix, there is a \"band\" in which it is hard to detect the\nclusters even before the theoretical detectability limit is reached, and for\nwhich the theoretically predicted detectability limit forms the sufficient\nupper bound. Analytic estimations of these bounds are presented, and\nempirically demonstrated.\n", "  We report on the temporal and spatial fluctuations in the atmospheric\nbrightness in the narrow band between Meinel emission lines at 1191.3 nm using\nan R=320 near-infrared instrument. We present the instrument design and\nimplementation, followed by a detailed analysis of data taken over the course\nof a night from Table Mountain Observatory. The absolute sky brightness at this\nwavelength is found to be 5330 +/- 30 nW m^-2 sr^-1, consistent with previous\nmeasurements of the inter-band airglow at these wavelengths. This amplitude is\nlarger than simple models of the continuum component of the airglow emission at\nthese wavelengths, confirming that an extra emissive or scattering component is\nrequired to explain the observations. We perform a detailed investigation of\nthe noise properties of the data and find no evidence for a noise component\nassociated with temporal instability in the inter-line continuum. This result\ndemonstrates that in several hours of ~100s integrations the noise performance\nof the instrument does not appear to significantly degrade from expectations,\ngiving a proof of concept that near-IR line intensity mapping may be feasible\nfrom ground-based sites.\n", "  We give a characterization of the class of gapped Hamiltonians introduced in\nPartI [O]. The Hamiltonians in this class are given as MPS (Matrix product\nstate) Hamiltonians. In [O], we list up properties of ground state structures\nof Hamiltonians in this class. In this Part II, we show the converse. Namely,\nif a (not necessarily MPS) Hamiltonian $H$ satisfies five of the listed\nproperties, there is a Hamiltonian $H'$ from the class in [O], satisfying the\nfollowings: The ground state spaces of the two Hamiltonians on the infinite\nintervals coincide. The spectral projections onto the ground state space of $H$\non each finite intervals are approximated by that of $H'$ exponentially well,\nwith respect to the interval size. The latter property has an application to\nthe classification problem.\n", "  We introduce a class of gapped Hamiltonians on quantum spin chains, which\nallows asymmetric edge ground states. This class is an asymmetric\ngeneralization of the class of Hamiltonians in [FNS]. It can be characterized\nby five qualitative physical properties of ground state structures. In this\nPart I, we introduce the models and investigate their properties.\n", "  The detection of the magnetic type $B$-mode polarization is the main goal of\nfuture cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. In the standard model,\nthe $B$-mode map is a strongly non-gaussian field due to the lensed component.\nBesides the two-point correlation function, the other statistics are also very\nimportant to dig the information of the polarization map. In this paper, we\nemploy the Minkowski functionals to study the morphological properties of the\nlensed $B$-mode maps. We find that the deviations from Gaussianity are very\nsignificant for both full and partial-sky surveys. As an application of the\nanalysis, we investigate the morphological imprints of the foreground residuals\nin the $B$-mode map. We find that even for very tiny foreground residuals, the\neffects on the map can be detected by the Minkowski functional analysis.\nTherefore, it provides a complementary way to investigate the foreground\ncontaminations in the CMB studies.\n", "  A many-body localized (MBL) state is a new state of matter emerging in a\ndisordered interacting system at high energy densities through a disorder\ndriven dynamic phase transition. The nature of the phase transition and the\nevolution of the MBL phase near the transition are the focus of intense\ntheoretical studies with open issues in the field. We develop an entanglement\ndensity matrix renormalization group (En-DMRG) algorithm to accurately target\nthe entanglement patterns of highly excited states for MBL systems. By studying\nthe one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain in a random field, we demonstrate the\nhigh accuracy of the method in obtaining statistical results of quantum states\nin the MBL phase. Based on large system simulations by En-DMRG for excited\nstates, we demonstrate some interesting features in the entanglement entropy\ndistribution function, which is characterized by two peaks; one at zero and\nanother one at the quantized entropy $S=ln2$ with an exponential decay tail on\nthe $S>ln2$ side. Combining En-DMRG with exact diagonalization simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the transition from the MBL phase to the delocalized ergodic\nphase is driven by rare events where the locally entangled spin pairs develop\nlong-range power-law correlations. The corresponding phase diagram contains an\nintermediate regime, which has power-law spin-z correlations resulting from\ncontributions of the rare events. We discuss the physical picture for the\nnumerical observations in the intermediate regime, where various distribution\nfunctions are distinctly different from results deep in the ergodic and MBL\nphases for finite-size systems. Our results may provide new insights for\nunderstanding the phase transition in such systems.\n", "  The channel loss incurred in long-distance transmission places a significant\nburden on quantum key distribution (QKD) systems: they must defeat a passive\neavesdropper who detects all the light lost in the quantum channel and does so\nwithout disturbing the light that reaches the intended destination. The current\nQKD implementation with the highest long-distance secret-key rate meets this\nchallenge by transmitting no more than one photon per bit [Opt. Express 21,\n24550-24565 (2013)]. As a result, it cannot achieve the Gbps secret-key rate\nneeded for one-time pad encryption of large data files unless an impractically\nlarge amount of multiplexing is employed. We introduce floodlight QKD (FL-QKD),\nwhich floods the quantum channel with a high number of photons per bit\ndistributed over a much greater number of optical modes. FL-QKD offers security\nagainst the optimum frequency-domain collective attack by transmitting less\nthan one photon per mode and using photon-coincidence channel monitoring, and\nit is completely immune to passive eavesdropping. More importantly, FL-QKD is\ncapable of a 2 Gbps secret-key rate over a 50 km fiber link, without any\nmultiplexing, using available equipment, i.e., no new technology need be\ndeveloped. FL-QKD achieves this extraordinary secret-key rate by virtue of its\nunprecedented secret-key efficiency, in bits per channel use, which exceeds\nthose of state-of-the-art systems by two orders of magnitude.\n", "  We analyze 2-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau vortices at critical coupling, and\nestablish asymptotic formulas for the tangent vectors of the vortex moduli\nspace using theorems of Taubes and Bradlow. We then compute the corresponding\nBerry curvature and holonomy in the large volume limit.\n", "  We identify and study a new security loophole in continuous-variable quantum\nkey distribution (CV-QKD) implementations, related to the imperfect linearity\nof the homodyne detector. By exploiting this loophole, we propose an active\nside-channel attack on the Gaussian-modulated coherent state CV-QKD protocol\ncombining an intercept-resend attack with an induced saturation of the homodyne\ndetection on the receiver side (Bob). We show that an attacker can bias the\nexcess noise estimation by displacing the quadratures of the coherent states\nreceived by Bob. We propose a saturation model that matches experimental\nmeasurements on the homodyne detection and use this model to study the impact\nof the saturation attack on parameter estimation in CV-QKD.We demonstrate that\nthis attack can bias the excess noise estimation beyond the null key threshold\nfor any system parameter, thus leading to a full security break. If we consider\nan additional criteria imposing that the channel transmission estimation should\nnot be affected by the attack, then the saturation attack can only be launched\nif the attenuation on the quantum channel is sufficient, corresponding to\nattenuations larger than approximately 6 dB. We moreover discuss the possible\ncounter-measures against the saturation attack and propose a new counter-\nmeasure based on Gaussian post-selection that can be implemented by classical\npost-processing and may allow to distill secret key when the raw measurement\ndata is partly saturated.\n", "  We proposed a calculational framework for describing induced fission that\navoids the Bohr-Wheeler assumption of well-defined fission channels. The\nbuilding blocks of our approach are configurations that form a discrete,\northogonal basis and can be characterized by both energy and shape. The\ndynamics is to be determined by interaction matrix elements between the states\nrather than by a Hill-Wheeler construction of a collective coordinate. Within\nour approach, several simple limits can be seen: diffusion; quantized\nconductance; and ordinary decay through channels. The specific proposal for the\ndiscrete basis is to use the $K^\\pi$ quantum numbers of the axially symmetric\nHartree-Fock approximation to generate the configurations. Fission paths would\nbe determined by hopping from configuration to configuration via the residual\ninteraction. We show as an example the configurations needed to describe a\nfictitious fission decay $^{32}{\\rm S} \\rightarrow ^{16}{\\rm O} + ^{16}{\\rm\nO}$. We also examine the geometry of the path for fission of $^{236}$U,\nmeasuring distances by the number of jumps needed to go to a new $K^\\pi$\npartition.\n", "  In this paper, I introduce a novel approach to modelling the individual\nrandom component (also called the intra-event uncertainty) of a ground-motion\nrelation (GMR), as well as a novel approach to estimating the corresponding\nparameters. In essence, I contend that the individual random component is\nreproduced adequately by a simple stochastic mechanism of random impulses\nacting in the horizontal plane, with random directions. The random number of\nimpulses was Poisson distributed. The parameters of the model were estimated\naccording to a proposal by Raschke (2013a), with the sample of random\ndifference xi=ln(Y1)-ln(Y2), in which Y1 and Y2 are the horizontal components\nof local ground-motion intensity. Any GMR element was eliminated by\nsubtraction, except the individual random components. In the estimation\nprocedure the distribution of difference xi was approximated by combining a\nlarge Monte Carlo simulated sample and Kernel smoothing. The estimated model\nsatisfactorily fitted the difference xi of the sample of peak ground\naccelerations, and the variance of the individual random components was\nconsiderably smaller than that of conventional GMRs. In addition, the\ndependence of variance on the epicentre distance was considered; however, a\ndependence of variance on the magnitude was not detected. Finally, the\ninfluence of the novel model and the corresponding approximations on PSHA was\nresearched. The applied approximations of distribution of the individual random\ncomponent were satisfactory for the researched example of PSHA.\n", "  We report the two typical models of normal heat conduction in one dimensional\nmomentum-conserving systems. They show the Arrhenius and the non-Arrhenius\ntemperature dependence. We construct the two corresponding phenomenologies,\ntransition-state theory of thermally activated dissociation and the\npressure-induced crossover between two fixed points in fluctuating\nhydrodynamics. Compressibility yields the ballistic fixed point, whose scaling\nis observed in FPU-\\beta lattices.\n", "  The fragmentation of a colored parton directly into a pair of colorless\nhadrons is a non-perturbative mechanism that offers important insights into the\nnucleon structure. Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from\nsemi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd\ndi-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly\nknown twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the\nmechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to\ndetails of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the\nlongitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation\nof the QCD vacuum. In this review, we outline the formalism of di-hadron\nfragmentation functions, we discuss different observables where they appear and\nwe present measurements and future worldwide plans.\n", "  We study a particular exact solution to the Born-Infeld determinantal gravity\nconsisting of a cosmological model which undergoes a brusque bounce. The latter\nconsists of an event characterized by a non-null (but finite) value of the\nsquared Hubble rate occurring at a minimum (non-null) scale factor. The energy\ndensity and pressure of the fluid covering the whole manifold are perfectly\nwell behaved in such an event, but the curvature invariants turn out to be\nundefined there because of the undefined character of the time derivative of H.\nIt is shown that the spacetime results geodesically complete and singularity\nfree, and that it corresponds to a picture of an eternal Universe in which a\n(somewhat unconventional) bounce replaces the standard Big Bang singularity.\nThis example tends to emphasize that, beyond Einstein's theory of General\nRelativity, and in the context of extended theories of gravity formulated by\npurely torsional means, the criterion of a singularity based on pathologies of\nscalars constructed upon the Riemann curvature tensor, becomes objectionable.\n", "  We review the status of the data and phenomenology in the Generalized Parton\nDistribution approach of Deep Virtual Meson Production.\n", "  The time evolution of electron waves in graphene superlattices is studied\nusing both microscopic and 'effective medium' formalisms. The numerical\nsimulations reveal that in a wide range of physical scenarios it is possible to\nneglect the granularity of the superlattice and characterize the electron\ntransport using a simple effective Hamiltonian. It is verified that as general\nrule the continuum approximation is rather accurate when the initial state is\nless localized than the characteristic spatial period of the superlattice. This\nproperty holds even when the microsocopic electric potential has a strong\nspatial modulation or in presence of interfaces between different\nsuperlattices. Detailed examples are given both of the time evolution of\ninitial electronic states and of the propagation of stationary states in the\ncontext of wave scattering. The theory also confirms that electrons propagating\nin tailored graphene superlattices with extreme anisotropy experience virtually\nno diffraction.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a variation of the notion of topological phase\nreflecting metric structure of the position space. This framework contains not\nonly periodic and non-periodic systems with symmetries in Kitaev's periodic\ntable but also topological crystalline insulators. We also define the bulk and\nedge indices as invariants taking values in the twisted equivariant\n$\\mathrm{K}$-groups of Roe algebras as generalizations of existing invariants\nsuch as the Hall conductance or the Kane--Mele $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant. As a\nconsequence, we obtain a new mathematical proof of the bulk-edge correspondence\nby using the coarse Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence.\n", "  Equations for cosmological evolution are formulated in a Weyl invariant\nformalism to take into account possible Weyl anomalies. Near two dimensions,\nthe renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal energy-momentum tensor\nand a slowly decaying vacuum energy. A natural generalization to four\ndimensions implies a quantum modification of Einstein field equations at long\ndistances. It offers a new perspective on time-dependence of couplings and\nnaturalness with potentially far-reaching consequences for the cosmological\nconstant problem, inflation, and dark energy.\n", "  The mechanical response, serviceability, and load bearing capacity of\nmaterials and structural components can be adversely affected due to external\nstimuli, which include exposure to a corrosive chemical species, high\ntemperatures, temperature fluctuations (i.e., freezing-thawing), cyclic\nmechanical loading, just to name a few. It is, therefore, of paramount\nimportance in several branches of engineering -- ranging from aerospace\nengineering, civil engineering to biomedical engineering -- to have a\nfundamental understanding of degradation of materials, as the materials in\nthese applications are often subjected to adverse environments. As a result of\nrecent advancements in material science, new materials like fiber-reinforced\npolymers and multi-functional materials that exhibit high ductility have been\ndeveloped and widely used; for example, as infrastructural materials or in\nmedical devices (e.g., stents). The traditional small-strain approaches of\nmodeling these materials will not be adequate. In this paper, we study\ndegradation of materials due to an exposure to chemical species and temperature\nunder large-strain and large-deformations. In the first part of our research\nwork, we present a consistent mathematical model with firm thermodynamic\nunderpinning. We then obtain semi-analytical solutions of several canonical\nproblems to illustrate the nature of the quasi-static and unsteady behaviors of\ndegrading hyperelastic solids.\n", "  We study, by rigorous Renormalization Group methods, the interacting\nAubry-Andre' model for fermions in the extended regime. We show that the\ninfinitely many gaps of the single particle spectrum persist in presence of\nweak many body interactions, despite the presence of Umklapp large momentum\nprocesses connecting the Fermi points. The width of the gaps is strongly\nrenormalized through critical exponents which verify exact scaling relations.\n", "  There is a proposal to search for a sterile neutrino in a few keV mass range\nby the \"Troitsk nu-mass\" facility. In order to estimate sterile neutrino mixing\none needs to make precision spectrum measurements well below the endpoint using\nthe existing electrostatic spectrometer with a magnetic adiabatic collimation,\nor MAC-E filter. The expected signature will be a kink in the electron energy\nspectrum in tritium beta-decay. In this article we consider the systematic\neffect of electron backscattering on the detector used in the spectrometer. For\nthis purpose we provide a set of Monte-Carlo simulation results of electron\nbackscattering on a silicon detector with a thin golden window with realistic\nelectric and magnetic fields in the spectrometer. We have found that the\nprobability of such an effect reaches up to 20-30\\%. The scattered electron\ncould be reflected backwards to the detector by electrostatic field or by\nmagnetic mirror. There is also a few percent probability to escape from the\nspectrometer through its entrance. A time delay between the scattering moment\non the detector and the return of the reflected electron can reach a couple of\nmicroseconds in the Troitsk spectrometer. Such estimations are critical for the\nplanning upgrades of the detector and the registration electronics.\n", "  The topological Kondo (TK) model has been proposed in solid-state quantum\ndevices as a way to realize non-Fermi liquid behaviors in a controllable\nsetting. Another motivation behind the TK model proposal is the demand to\ndemonstrate the quantum dynamical properties of Majorana fermions, which are at\nthe heart of their potential use in topological quantum computation. Here we\nconsider a junction of crossed Tonks-Girardeau gases arranged in a\nstar-geometry (forming a Y -junction), and we perform a theoretical analysis of\nthis system showing that it provides a physical realization of the topological\nKondo model in the realm of cold atom systems. Using computer-generated\nholography, we experimentally implement a Y-junction suitable for atom\ntrapping, with controllable and independent parameters. The junction and the\ntransverse size of the atom waveguides are of the order of 5 micrometers,\nleading to favorable estimates for the Kondo temperature and for the coupling\nacross the junction. Since our results show that all the required theoretical\nand experimental ingredients are available, this provides the demonstration of\nan ultracold atom device that may in principle exhibit the topological Kondo\neffect.\n", "  A simple formula for one-loop logarithmic divergences on the background of a\ntwo-dimensional curved space-time is derived for theories for which the second\nvariation of the action is a nonminimal second order operator with small\nnonminimal terms. In particular, this formula allows to calculate terms which\nare integrals of total derivatives. As an application of the result, one-loop\ndivergences for the higher spin fields on the constant curvature background are\nobtained in a nonminimal gauge, which depends on two parameters. By an explicit\ncalculation we demonstrate that with the considered accuracy the result is\ngauge independent. Moreover, the result appeared to be independent of the spin\n$s$ for $s\\ge 3$.\n", "  We summarize the most significant aspects in the study of transverse spin\nphenomena over the last few decades, focusing on Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic\nScattering processes and hadronic production in $e^+e^-$ annihilations. The\nphenomenology of transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation\nfunctions will be reviewed in an in-depth analysis of the most recent\ndevelopments and of the future perspectives.\n", "  We study the spectrum of the Helmholtz equation in a two-dimensional infinite\nwaveguide, containing a weak heterogeneity localized at an internal point, and\nobeying Dirichlet boundary conditions at its border. We prove that, when the\nheterogeneity corresponds to a locally denser material, the lowest eigenvalue\nof the spectrum falls below the continuum threshold and a bound state appears,\nlocalized at the heterogeneity. We devise a rigorous perturbation scheme and\nderive the exact expression for the energy to third order in the heterogeneity.\n", "  Commensurability is of paramount importance in numerous strongly interacting\nelectronic systems. In the Fractional Quantum Hall effect, a rich cascade of\nincreasingly narrow plateaux appear at larger denominator filling fractions.\nRich commensurate structures also emerge, at certain filling fractions, in high\ntemperature superconductors and other electronic systems. A natural question\nconcerns the character of these and other electronic systems at irrational\nfilling fractions. Here we demonstrate that quasicrystalline structures\nnaturally emerge in these situations, and trigger behaviors not typically\nexpected of periodic systems. We first show that irrationally filled quantum\nHall systems cross over into quasiperiodically ordered configuration in the\nthin-torus limit. Using known properties of quasicrystals, we argue that these\nstates are unstable against the effects of disorder, in agreement with the\nexistence of quantum Hall plateaux. We then study analogous physical situations\nin a system of cold Rydberg atoms placed on an optical lattice. Such an\nexperimental setup is generally disorder free, and can therefore be used to\ndetect the emergent quasicrystals we predict. We discuss similar situations in\nthe Falicov-Kimball model, where known exact results can be used to establish\nquasicrystalline structures in one and two dimensions. We briefly speculate on\npossible relations between our theoretical findings and the existence of glassy\ndynamics and other features of strongly correlated electronic systems.\n", "  We introduce a theoretical approach to study the quantum-dissipative dynamics\nof electronic excitations in macromolecules, which enables to perform\ncalculations in large systems and cover long time intervals. All the parameters\nof the underlying microscopic Hamiltonian are obtained from \\emph{ab-initio}\nelectronic structure calculations, ensuring chemical detail. In the short-time\nregime, the theory is solvable using a diagrammatic perturbation theory,\nenabling analytic insight. To compute the time evolution of the density matrix\nat intermediate times, typically $\\lesssim$~ps, we develop a Monte Carlo\nalgorithm free from any sign or phase problem, hence computationally efficient.\nFinally, the dynamics in the long-time and large-distance limit can be studied\ncombining the microscopic calculations with renormalization group techniques to\ndefine a rigorous low-resolution effective theory. We benchmark our Monte Carlo\nalgorithm against the results obtained in perturbation theory and using a\nsemi-classical non-perturbative scheme. Then we apply it to compute the\nintra-chain charge mobility in a realistic conjugate polymer.\n", "  Taking clues from the recent construction of the covariant action for type II\nand heterotic string field theories, we construct a manifestly Lorentz\ncovariant action for type IIB supergravity, and discuss its gauge fixing\nmaintaining manifest Lorentz invariance. The action contains a\n(non-gravitating) free 4-form field besides the usual fields of type IIB\nsupergravity. This free field, being completely decoupled from the interacting\nsector, has no physical consequence.\n", "  It is shown that in central collisions of $^{197}$Au nuclei with heavy\nemulsion nuclei at 11.6 $A$GeV/c two-particles pseudorapidity correlations for\nproduced particles in terms of correlation functions demonstate predominantly\nlong-range behaviour in contrast to nucleon-nucleon interactions. The\nexperimental data are compared with calculations based on the FRITIOF-M model\nand the model of independent emission of particles.\n", "  After a brief overview of the operator formalism for conventional string\ntheory, an operator formalism for ambitwistor string theory is presented. It is\nshown how tree level supergravity scattering amplitudes are recovered in this\nformalism. More general applications of this formalism to loop amplitudes and\nthe construction of an ambitwistor string field theory are briefly discussed.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of the Z3 scalar singlet model explaining the\nFermi galactic centre excess. We find a good fit to the measured spectral\nexcess in the region where the dark matter mass is comparable to the Higgs and\nthe Higgs portal coupling $\\lambda_{HS}\\sim 0.04$. This preferred region is\nconsistent with constraints from vacuum stability and current dark matter\nexperiments, and will be discovered or falsified soon by future dark matter\ndirect detection experiment.\n", "  We present a novel mechanism of supersymmetry breaking embeddable in string\ntheory and simultaneously sharing the main advantages of (sequestered) gravity\nand gauge mediation. It is driven by a Scherk-Schwarz deformation along a\ncompact extra dimension, transverse to a D-brane stack supporting the\nsupersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. This fixes the magnitude of the\ngravitino mass, together with that of the gauginos of a bulk gauge group, at a\nscale as high as $10^{10}$ GeV. Supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the\nobservable sector dominantly by gauge interactions using massive messengers\ntransforming non-trivially under the bulk and Standard Model gauge groups and\nleading to a neutralino LSP as dark matter candidate. The Higgsino mass $\\mu$\nand soft Higgs-bilinear B$\\mu$-term could be generated at the same order of\nmagnitude as the other soft terms by effective supergravity couplings as in the\nGiudice-Masiero mechanism.\n", "  Consequences of QCD current algebra formulated on a light-like hyperplane are\nderived for the forward scattering of vector and axial-vector currents on an\narbitrary hadronic target. It is shown that current algebra gives rise to a\nspecial class of sum rules that are direct consequences of the independent\nchiral symmetry that exists at every point on the two-dimensional transverse\nplane orthogonal to the lightlike direction. These sum rules are obtained by\nexploiting the closed, infinite-dimensional algebra satisfied by the transverse\nmoments of null-plane axial-vector and vector charge distributions. In the\nspecial case of a nucleon target, this procedure leads to the Adler-Weisberger,\nGerasimov-Drell-Hearn, Cabbibo-Radicatti and Fubini-Furlan-Rossetti sum rules.\nMatching to the dispersion-theoretic language which is usually invoked in\nderiving these sum rules, the moment sum rules are shown to be equivalent to\nalgebraic constraints on forward S-matrix elements in the Regge limit.\n", "  Using the CGC formalism, we calculate the two-gluon rapidity correlations of\nstrong colour fields in $pp$, $pA$ and $AA$ collisions, respectively. If one\ntrigger gluon is fixed at central rapidity, a ridge-like correlation pattern is\nobtained in symmetry $pp$ and $AA$ collisions, and a huge bump-like correlation\npattern is presented in asymmetry $pA$ collisions. It is demonstrated that the\nridge-like correlation patterns are caused by the stronger correlation with the\ngluon of colour source. The transverse momentum and incident energy dependence\nof the ridge-like correlation pattern is also systematically studied. The ridge\nis more likely observed at higher incident energy and lower transverse momentum\nof trigger gluon.\n", "  Two identical dipolar atoms moving in a harmonic trap without an external\nmagnetic field are investigated. Using the algebra of angular momentum a semi -\nanalytical solutions are found. We show that the internal spin - spin\ninteractions between the atoms couple to the orbital angular momentum causing\nan analogue of Einstein - de Haas effect. We show a possibility of\nadiabatically pumping our system from the s-wave to the d-wave relative motion.\nThe effective spin-orbit coupling occurs at anti-crossings of the energy\nlevels.\n", "  Here we present the first results of WATCHBOY, a water Cherenkov detector\ndesigned to measure the yield of $\\beta$-neutron emitting radionuclides\nproduced by cosmic ray muons in water. In addition to the $\\beta$-neutron\nmeasurement, we also provide a first look at isolating single-$\\beta$ producing\nradionuclides following muon-induced hadronic showers as a check of the\ndetection capabilities of WATCHBOY. The data taken over $207$ live days\nindicates a $^{9}$Li production yield upper limit of\n$1.9\\times10^{-7}\\mu^{-1}g^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^2$ at $\\sim400$ meters water\nequivalent (m.w.e.) overburden at the $90\\%$ confidence level. In this work the\n$^{9}$Li signal in WATCHBOY was used as a proxy for the combined search for\n$^{9}$Li and $^{8}$He production. This result will provide a constraint on\nestimates of antineutrino-like backgrounds in future water-based antineutrino\ndetectors.\n", "  We consider a general class of stochastic networks and ask which network\nnodes need to be controlled, and how, to stabilize and switch between desired\nmetastable (target) states in terms of the first and second statistical moments\nof the system. We first show that it is sufficient to directly interfere with a\nsubset of nodes which can be identified using information about the graph of\nthe network only. Then, we develop a suitable method for feedback control which\nacts on that subset of nodes and preserves the covariance structure of the\ndesired target state. Finally, we demonstrate our theoretical results using a\nstochastic Hopfield network and a global brain model. Our results are\napplicable to a variety of (model) networks, and further our understanding of\nthe relationship between network structure and collective dynamics for the\nbenefit of effective control.\n", "  We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and\nits vector representation in five and eleven dimensions and find the dynamical\nequations it predicts at low levels. Restricting these results to contain only\nthe usual fields of supergravity and the generalised space-time to be the usual\nspace-time we find the equations of motion of the five and eleven dimensional\nmaximal supergravity theories. Since this non-linear realisation contains\neffects that are beyond the supergravity approximation and are thought to be\npresent in an underlying theory we conclude that the low energy effective\naction of string and branes must possess an E11 symmetry.\n", "  In the context of data modeling and comparisons between different fit models,\nBayesian analysis calls that model best which has the largest evidence, the\nprior-weighted integral over model parameters of the likelihood function.\nEvidence calculations automatically take into account both the usual\nchi-squared measure and an Occam factor which quantifies the price for adding\nextra parameters. Applying Bayesian analysis to projections onto azimuth of 2D\nangular correlations from 200 GeV AuAu collisions, we consider typical model\nchoices including Fourier series and a Gaussian plus combinations of individual\ncosine components. We find that models including a Gaussian component are\nconsistently preferred over pure Fourier-series parametrizations, sometimes\nstrongly so. For 0-5% central collisions the Gaussian-plus-dipole model\nperforms better than Fourier Series models or any other combination of\nGaussian-plus-multipoles.\n", "  Recent observations of ridge-like structure in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ angular\ncorrelations at the RHIC and LHC have been interpreted to imply collective\nmotion in smaller collision systems. It is argued that if correlation\nstructures accepted as manifestations of flow in $A$-$A$ collisions appear in\nsmaller systems collectivity (flow) must extend to the smaller systems. But the\nargument could be reversed to conclude that such structures appearing in\n$A$-$A$ collisions may not imply hydrodynamic flow. I present spectrum,\ncorrelation and fluctuation data from RHIC $p$-$p$ and Au-Au collisions and\n$p$-$p$, $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb results from the LHC described accurately by a\ntwo-component (soft+dijet) model of hadron production. I also present evidence\nfor a significant $p$-$p$ nonjet (NJ) quadrupole ($v_2$) component with\n$n_{ch}$ systematics directly related to $A$-$A$ NJ quadrupole systematics. The\ncombination suggests that soft, dijet and NJ quadrupole components are distinct\nphenomena in all cases, inconsistent with hadron production from a common bulk\nmedium exhibiting collective motion (flow).\n", "  The recent results from ground based $\\gamma$-ray detectors (HESS, MAGIC,\nVERITAS) provide a population of TeV galactic $\\gamma$-ray sources which are\npotential sources of High Energy (HE) neutrinos. Since the $\\gamma$-rays and\n$\\nu$ -s are produced from decays of neutral and charged pions, the flux of TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays can be used to estimate the upper limit of $\\nu$ flux and vice\nversa; the detectability of $\\nu$ flux implies a minimum flux of the\naccompanying $\\gamma$-rays (assuming the internal and the external absorption\nof $\\gamma$-rays is negligible). Using this minimum flux, it is possible to\nfind the sources which can be detected with cubic-kilometer telescopes. I will\ndiscuss the possibility to detect HE neutrinos from powerful galactic\naccelerators, such as Supernova Remnants (SNRs) and Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe)\nand show that likely only RX J1713.7-3946 , RX J0852.0-4622 and Vela X can be\ndetected by current generation of instruments (IceCube and Km3Net). It will be\nshown also, that galactic binary systems could be promising sources of HE $\\nu$\n-s. In particular, $\\nu$-s and $\\gamma$-rays from Cygnus X-3 will be discussed\nduring recent gamma-ray activity, showing that in the future such kind of\nactivities could produce detectable flux of HE $\\nu$-s\n", "  We introduce a new prescription for quantising scalar field theories\nperturbatively around a true minimum of the full quantum effective action,\nwhich is to `complete normal order' the bare action of interest. When the true\nvacuum of the theory is located at zero field value, the key property of this\nprescription is the automatic cancellation, to any finite order in perturbation\ntheory, of all tadpole and, more generally, all `cephalopod' Feynman diagrams.\nThe latter are connected diagrams that can be disconnected into two pieces by\ncutting one internal vertex, with either one or both pieces free from external\nlines. In addition, this procedure of `complete normal ordering' (which is an\nextension of the standard field theory definition of normal ordering) reduces\nby a substantial factor the number of Feynman diagrams to be calculated at any\ngiven loop order. We illustrate explicitly the complete normal ordering\nprocedure and the cancellation of cephalopod diagrams in scalar field theories\nwith non-derivative interactions, and by using a point splitting `trick' we\nextend this result to theories with derivative interactions, such as those\nappearing as non-linear sigma-models in the world-sheet formulation of string\ntheory. We focus here on theories with trivial vacua, generalising the\ndiscussion to non-trivial vacua in a follow-up paper.\n", "  The long range dependence of the fractional Brownian motion (fBm), fractional\nGaussian noise (fGn), and differentiated fGn (DfGn) is described by the Hurst\nexponent $H$. Considering the realisations of these three processes as time\nseries, they might be described by their statistical features, such as half of\nthe ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance,\n$\\mathcal{A}$, and the number of turning points, $T$. This paper investigates\nthe relationships between $\\mathcal{A}$ and $H$, and between $T$ and $H$. It is\nfound numerically that the formulae $\\mathcal{A}(H)=a{\\rm e}^{bH}$ in case of\nfBm, and $\\mathcal{A}(H)=a+bH^c$ for fGn and DfGn, describe well the\n$\\mathcal{A}(H)$ relationship. When $T(H)$ is considered, no simple formula is\nfound, and it is empirically found that among polynomials, the fourth and\nsecond order description applies best. The most relevant finding is that when\nplotted in the space of $(\\mathcal{A},T)$, the three process types form\nseparate branches. Hence, it is examined whether $\\mathcal{A}$ and $T$ may\nserve as Hurst exponent indicators. Some real world data (stock market indices,\nsunspot numbers, chaotic time series) are analyzed for this purpose, and it is\nfound that the $H$'s estimated using the $H(\\mathcal{A})$ relations (expressed\nas inverted $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ functions) are consistent with the $H$'s extracted\nwith the well known wavelet approach. This allows to efficiently estimate the\nHurst exponent based on fast and easy to compute $\\mathcal{A}$ and $T$, given\nthat the process type: fBm, fGn or DfGn, is correctly classified beforehand.\nFinally, it is suggested that the $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ relation for fGn and DfGn\nmight be an exact (shifted) $3/2$ power-law.\n", "  The conventional oblique parameters analyses of precision electroweak data\ncan be consistently cast in the modern framework of the Standard Model\neffective field theory (SMEFT) when restrictions are imposed on the SMEFT\nparameter space so that it describes universal theories. However, the\nusefulness of such analyses is challenged by the fact that universal theories\nat the scale of new physics, where they are matched onto the SMEFT, can flow to\nnonuniversal theories with renormalization group (RG) evolution down to the\nelectroweak scale, where precision observables are measured. The departure from\nuniversal theories at the electroweak scale is not arbitrary, but dictated by\nthe universal parameters at the matching scale. But to define oblique\nparameters, and more generally universal parameters at the electroweak scale\nthat directly map onto observables, additional prescriptions are needed for the\ntreatment of RG-induced nonuniversal effects. We perform a RG analysis of the\nSMEFT description of universal theories, and discuss the impact of RG on\nsimplified, universal-theories-motivated approaches to fitting precision\nelectroweak and Higgs data.\n", "  Proton-lead and lead-proton data taking during 2013 has allowed LHCb to\nexpand its physics program to heavy ion physics. Results include the first\nforward measurement of Z production in proton-lead collisions as well as a\nmeasurement of the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production\nof prompt and displaced J/$\\psi$, $\\psi$(2S) and $\\Upsilon$. Angular particle\ncorrelations have also been measured for events of varying charged particle\nactivity.\n", "  Pair production of tau leptons in two photon collision ${\\gamma\\gamma \\to\n\\tau^{+}\\tau}^{-}$ is studied at CLIC to test CP violating QED couplings of tau\nleptons. CP violating effects are investigated using tau pair spin correlations\nwhich are observed through the hadronic decay of each $\\tau$ into $\\pi\\nu$.\nCompetitive bounds with previous works on the electric dipole moment from CP\nodd terms have been obtained.\n", "  In this work we study the statistical and thermodynamic properties of the\nhorizon fluid corresponding to the Boulware-Deser (BD) black hole of\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Using mean field theory, we show\nexplicitly that the BD fluid exhibits the coexistence of two phases, a BEC and\na non-condensed phase corresponding to the Einstein term and the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm in the gravity action, respectively. In the fluid description, the\nhigh-energy corrections associated to Gauss-Bonnet gravity are modeled as\nexcitations of the fluid medium. We provide statistical modeling of the excited\npart of the fluid and explicitly show that it is characterized by a generalized\ndispersion relation which in $D=6$ dimensions corresponds to a non-relativistic\nfluid. We also shed light on the ambiguity found in the literature regarding\nthe expression of the entropy of the horizon fluid. We provide a general\nprescription to obtain the entropy and show that it is indeed given by Wald\nentropy.\n", "  We present the main results of our recent analyses of exclusive production of\nvector charmonia ($J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$) in $k_t$-factorization approach and for\n$\\gamma \\gamma$ production of charged dilepton pairs in exclusive and\nsemiinclusive processes in a new approach, similar in spirit to\n$k_t$-factorization.\n  The results for charmonia are compared with recent results of the LHCb\ncollaboration. We include some helicity flip contributions and quantify the\neffect of absorption correction. The effect of $c \\bar c$ wave function is\nillustrated.\n  We present uncertainties related to $F_2$ structure function which are the\nmain ingredient of the approach. Our results are compared with recent CMS data\nfor dilepton production with lepton isolation cuts imposed.\n", "  With Run II of the LHC having started, the need for high precision theory\npredictions whose uncertainty matches that of the data to be taken necessitated\na range of new developments in Monte-Carlo Event Generators. This talk will\ngive an overview of the progress in recent years in the field and what can and\ncannot be expected from these newly written tools.\n", "  We examine possible low-temperature phases of a repulsively Rydberg-dressed\nFermi gas in a three-dimensional free space. It is shown that the collective\ndensity excitations develop a roton minimum, which is softened at a wavevector\nsmaller than the Fermi wavevector when the particle density is above a critical\nvalue. The mean field calculation shows that unlike the insulating charge\ndensity waves states often observed in conventional condensed matters, a\nself-assembled metallic density wave state emerges at low temperatures. In\nparticular, the density wave state supports a Fermi surface and a\nbody-center-cubic crystal order at the same time with the estimated critical\ntemperature being about one-tenth of the non-interacting Fermi energy. Our\nresults suggest the emergency of a fermionic quantum solid that should be\nobservable in current experimental setup.\n", "  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are extra-galactic and extremely energetic transient\nemissions of gamma rays, which are thought to be associated with the death of\nmassive stars or the merger of compact objects in binary systems. Their huge\nluminosities involve the presence a newborn stellar-mass black hole emitting a\nrelativistic collimated outflow, which accelerates particles and produces\nnon-thermal emissions from the radio domain to the highest energies. In this\narticle, I review recent progresses in the understanding of GRB jet physics\nabove 100 MeV, based on Fermi observations of bright GRBs. I discuss the\nphysical implications of these observations and their impact on GRB modeling,\nand I present some prospects for GRB observation at very high energies in the\nnear future.\n", "  Bose-Einstein correlations of pairs of identical charged pions produced in\nhadronic Z decays and in 7 TeV pp minimum bias interactions are investigated\nwithin the framework of the tau-model.\n", "  We study partition functions of low-energy effective theories of M2-branes,\nwhose type IIB brane constructions include orientifolds. We mainly focus on\ncircular quiver superconformal Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$, whose gauge group\nis $O(2N+1)\\times USp(2N)\\times \\cdots \\times O(2N+1)\\times USp(2N)$. This\ntheory is the natural generalization of the $\\mathcal{N}=5$ ABJM theory with\nthe gauge group $O(2N+1)_{2k} \\times USp(2N)_{-k}$. We find that the partition\nfunction of this type of theory has a simple relation to the one of the\nM2-brane theory without the orientifolds, whose gauge group is $U(N)\\times\n\\cdots \\times U(N)$. By using this relation, we determine an exact form of the\ngrand partition function of the $O(2N+1)_{2} \\times USp(2N)_{-1}$ ABJM theory,\nwhere its supersymmetry is expected to be enhanced to $\\mathcal{N}=6$. As\nanother interesting application, we discuss that our result gives a natural\nphysical interpretation of a relation between the grand partition functions of\nthe $U(N+1)_4 \\times U(N)_{-4}$ ABJ theory and $U(N)_2 \\times U(N)_{-2}$ ABJM\ntheory, recently conjectured by Grassi-Hatsuda-Mari\\~no. We also argue that\npartition functions of $\\hat{A}_3$ quiver theories have representations in\nterms of an ideal Fermi gas systems associated with $\\hat{D}$-type quiver\ntheories and this leads an interesting relation between certain $U(N)$ and\n$USp(2N)$ supersymmetric gauge theories.\n", "  We present an overview on the current experimental and phenomenological\nstatus of transverse single spin asymmetries (tSSAs) in proton-proton\ncollisions. In particular, we focus on large-$p_T$ inclusive pion, photon, jet,\npion-jet production and Drell-Yan processes. For all of them theoretical\nestimates are given in terms of a generalised parton model (GPM) based on a\ntransverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorisation scheme. Comparisons with the\ncorresponding results in a collinear twist-3 formalism and in a modified GPM\napproach are also made. On the experimental side, a selection of the most\ninteresting and recent results from RHIC is presented.\n", "  The particle-hole dispersive optical model, developed recently, is applied to\ndescribe properties of high-energy isoscalar monopole excitations in\nmedium-heavy mass spherical nuclei. We consider, in particular, the double\ntransition density averaged over the energy of the isoscalar monopole\nexcitations in $^{208}$Pb in a wide energy interval, which includes the\nisoscalar giant monopole resonance and its overtone. The energy-averaged\nstrength functions of these resonances are also analyzed. Possibilities for\nusing the mentioned transition density to description of inelastic\n$\\alpha$-scattering are discussed.\n", "  Disorder effects in the thermodynamic properties of a ideal Bose gas confined\nin a semi-infinite multi-layer structure %described by $M$ permeable barriers\nwithin a box of thickness $L$ and infinite lateral extent, are analyzed. The\nlayers are first modeled by a periodic array of $M$ Dirac delta-functions of\nequal intensity. Then, we introduce structural and compositional disorder, as\nwell as a random set of layer vacancies in the system to calculate the internal\nenergy, chemical potential and the specific heat for different configurations.\nWhereas structural and compositional disorder does not reveal a significant\nchange, a dramatic increase in the maximum of the specific heat is observed\nwhen the system is depleted a fraction of the order of $0.1$ to $0.2$ of random\nlayers compared to the original, fully periodic array. Furthermore, this\nmaximum, which is reminiscent of a Bose-Einstein condensation for an infinite\narray, occurs at higher temperatures.\n", "  We consider the immediate or near-term experimental opportunities offered by\nsome scenarios that could explain the new diphoton excess at the LHC. If the\nexcess is due to a new particle $X_s$ at 750 GeV, additional new particles are\nrequired, providing further signals. If connected with naturalness, the $X_s$\nmay be produced in top partner decays. Then a $t'\\bar t'$ signal, with $t'\\to t\nX_s$ and $X_s\\to gg$ dominantly, might be discovered by reinterpreting 13 TeV\nSUSY searches in multijet events with low MET and/or a lepton. If $X_s$ is a\nbound state of quirks, the signal events may be accompanied by an unusual\nnumber of soft tracks or soft jets. Other resonances including dilepton and\nphoton+jet as well as dijet may lie at or above this mass, and signatures of\nhidden glueballs might also be observable. If the \"photons\" in the excess are\nactually long-lived particles decaying to photon pairs or to electron pairs,\nthere are opportunities for detecting overlapping photons and/or unusual\npatterns of apparent photon-conversions in either $X_s$ or 125 GeV Higgs\ndecays. There is also the possibility of events with a hard \"photon\" recoiling\nagainst a narrow isolated HCAL-only \"jet\", which, after the jet's energy is\ncorrected for its electromagnetic origin, would show a peak at 750 GeV.\n", "  We investigate the parameter space of the Standard Model enhanced by a gauge\nsinglet real scalar $S$. Taking into account all the theoretical and\nexperimental constraints, we show the allowed parameter space for two different\ntypes of such singlet-enhanced Standard Model. For the first case, the scalar\npotential has an explicit $Z_2$-symmetry, and may lead to a dark matter\ncandidate under certain conditions. For the second case, the scalar potential\ndoes not respect any $Z_2$. This is again divided into two subcategories: one\nwhere the Standard Model vacuum is stable, and one where it is unstable and can\ndecay into a deeper minimum. We show how the parameters in the scalar potential\ncontrol the range of validity of all these models. Finally, we show the effect\nof one-loop correction on the positions and depths of the minima of the\npotential.\n", "  The origin and composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remain a\nmystery. The proton dip model describes their spectral shape in the energy\nrange above $10^9$ GeV by pair production and photohadronic interactions with\nthe cosmic microwave background. The photohadronic interactions also produce\ncosmogenic neutrinos peaking around $10^9$ GeV. We test whether this model is\nstill viable in light of recent UHECR spectrum measurements from the Telescope\nArray experiment, and upper limits on the cosmogenic neutrino flux from\nIceCube. While two-parameter fits have been already presented, we perform a\nfull scan of the three main physical model parameters: source redshift\nevolution, injected proton maximal energy, and spectral index. We find\nqualitatively different conclusions compared to earlier two-parameter fits in\nthe literature: a mild preference for a maximal energy cutoff at the sources\ninstead of the Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, hard injection spectra,\nand strong source evolution. The predicted cosmogenic neutrino flux exceeds the\nIceCube limit for any parameter combination. As a result, the proton dip model\nis challenged at more than 95\\% C.L. This is strong evidence against this model\nindependent of mass composition measurements.\n", "  We propose that the sbino, the scalar partner of a Dirac bino can explain the\n750 GeV diphoton excess observed by ATLAS and CMS . We analyze a model in which\nthe sbino couples to pairs of Standard Model (SM) gauge bosons. We analyze an\neffective operator model, as well as a completion in which the sbino couples to\npairs of gauge bosons through loops of heavy sfermions. We find that the sbino\nmay be given an appreciable decay width through tree level coupling in the\nHiggs or Higgsino sector and additionally fit the 750 GeV excess by considering\ngluon fusion processes with decay to diphotons.\n", "  We use holography to prove the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC) at\nleading order in large-$N$ for CFTs and relevant deformations of CFTs in\nMinkowski space which have Einstein gravity duals. Given any codimension-2\nsurface $\\Sigma$ which is locally stationary under a null deformation in the\ndirection $k$ at the point $p$, the QNEC is a lower bound on the\nenergy-momentum tensor at $p$ in terms of the second variation of the entropy\nto one side of $\\Sigma$: $\\langle T_{kk}\\rangle \\geq S\"/2\\pi \\sqrt{h}$. In a\nCFT, conformal transformations of this inequality give results which apply when\n$\\Sigma$ is not locally stationary. The QNEC was proven previously for free\ntheories, and taken together with our result this provides strong evidence that\nthe QNEC is a true statement about quantum field theory in general.\n", "  The nonequilibrium time evolution of a quantum dot is studied by means of\ndynamic equations for time-dependent Greens functions derived from a\ntwo-particle-irreducible (2PI) effective action for the Anderson impurity\nmodel. Coupling the dot between two leads at different voltages, the dynamics\nof the current through the dot is investigated. We show that the 2PI approach\nis capable to describe the dynamical build-up of the Kondo effect, which shows\nup as a sharp resonance in the spectral function, with a width exponentially\nsuppressed in the electron self coupling on the dot. An external voltage\napplied to the dot is found to deteriorate the Kondo effect at the\nhybridization scale. The dynamic equations are evaluated within different\nnonperturbative resummation schemes, within the direct, particle-particle, and\nparticle-hole channels, as well as their combination, and the results compared\nwith that from other methods.\n", "  We study holographic momentum relaxation in the limit of a large number of\nspacetime dimensions D. For an axion model we find that momentum conservation\nis restored as D becomes large. To compensate we scale the strength of the\nsources with D so that momentum is relaxed even at infinite D. We analytically\nobtain the quasi-normal modes which control electric and heat transport, and\ngive their frequencies in a 1/D expansion. We also obtain the AC thermal\nconductivity as an expansion in 1/D, which at leading order takes Drude form.\nTo order 1/D our analytical result provides a reasonable approximation to the\nAC conductivity even at D=4, establishing large D as a practical method in this\ncontext. As a further application, we discuss the signature of the transition\nfrom coherent to incoherent behaviour known to exist in the system for finite\nD.\n", "  We present results from the first large parameter study of neutron star\nmergers using fully general relativistic simulations with finite-temperature\nmicrophysical equations of state and neutrino cooling. We consider equal and\nunequal-mass binaries drawn from the galactic population and simulate each\nbinary with three different equations of state. Our focus is on the emission of\nenergy and angular momentum in gravitational waves in the postmerger phase. We\nfind that the emitted gravitational-wave energy in the first\n$\\sim$$10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ of the life of the resulting hypermassive neutron star\n(HMNS) is about twice the energy emitted over the entire inspiral history of\nthe binary. The total radiated energy per binary mass is comparable to or\nlarger than that of nonspinning black hole inspiral-mergers. About $0.8-2.5\\%$\nof the binary mass-energy is emitted at kHz frequencies in the early HMNS\nevolution. We find a clear dependence of the postmerger GW emission on binary\nconfiguration and equation of state and show that it can be encoded as a broad\nfunction of the binary tidal coupling constant $\\kappa^T_2$. Our results also\ndemonstrate that the dimensionless spin of black holes resulting from\nsubsequent HMNS collapse are limited to $\\lesssim0.7-0.8$. This may\nsignificantly impact the neutrino pair annihilation mechanism for powering\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRB).\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a quantum system coupled linearly to Gaussian\nwhite noise using functional methods. By performing the integration over the\nnoisy field in the evolution operator, we get an equivalent non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian, which evolves the quantum state with a dissipative dynamics. We\nalso show that if the integration over the noisy field is done for the time\nevolution of the density matrix, a gain contribution from the fluctuations, can\nbe accessed in addition to the loss one from the non-hermitian Hamiltonian\ndynamics. We illustrate our study by computing analytically the effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which we found to be the complex frequency harmonic\noscillator, with a known evolution operator. It leads to space and time\nlocalisation, a common feature of noisy quantum systems in general\napplications.\n", "  We perform a Hamiltonian analysis of a large class of scalar-tensor\nLagrangians which depend quadratically on the second derivatives of a scalar\nfield. By resorting to a convenient choice of dynamical variables, we show that\nthe Hamiltonian can be written in a very simple form, where the Hamiltonian and\nthe momentum constraints are easily identified. In the case of degenerate\nLagrangians, which include the Horndeski and beyond Horndeski quartic\nLagrangians, our analysis confirms that the dimension of the physical phase\nspace is reduced by the primary and secondary constraints due to the\ndegeneracy, thus leading to the elimination of the dangerous Ostrogradski\nghost. We also present the Hamiltonian formulation for nondegenerate theories\nand find that they contain four degrees of freedom, as expected. We finally\ndiscuss the status of the unitary gauge from the Hamiltonian perspective.\n", "  A review of the recent applications of the dispersive optical model (DOM) is\npresented. Emphasis is on the nonlocal implementation of the DOM that is\ncapable of describing ground-state properties accurately when data like the\nnuclear charge density are available. The DOM, conceived by Claude Mahaux,\nprovides a unified description of both elastic nucleon scattering and structure\ninformation related to single-particle properties below the Fermi energy. We\nhave recently introduced a nonlocal dispersive optical potential for both the\nreal and imaginary part. Nonlocal absorptive potentials yield equivalent\nelastic differential cross sections for ${}^{40}$Ca as compared to local ones\nbut change the $\\ell$-dependent absorption profile suggesting important\nconsequences for the analysis of nuclear reactions. Below the Fermi energy,\nnonlocality is essential for an accurate representation of particle number and\nthe nuclear charge density. Spectral properties implied by $(e,e'p)$ and\n$(p,2p)$ reactions are correctly described, including the energy distribution\nof about 10\\% high-momentum protons obtained at Jefferson Lab. The nonlocal DOM\nallows a complete description of experimental data both above (up to 200 MeV)\nand below the Fermi energy in $^{40}$Ca. It is further demonstrated that\nelastic nucleon-nucleus scattering data constrain the spectral strength in the\ncontinuum of orbits that are nominally bound in the independent-particle model.\nExtension of this analysis to $^{48}$Ca allows a prediction of the neutron skin\nof this nucleus that is larger than most predictions made so far.\n", "  We report on the short-time dynamics in colloidal mixtures made up of\nmonomers and dimers highly confined between two glass-plates. At low\nconcentrations, the experimental measurements of colloidal motion agree well\nwith the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation at low Reynolds numbers, which\ntakes into account the increase of the drag force on each particle due to\nwall-particle hydrodynamic forces. We find that the ratio of the short-time\ndiffusion coefficients of the monomer and that of the center of mass of the\ndimer remains independent of both the total packing fraction and the dimer\nmolar fraction up to concentrations near to the crystallization transition. The\nsame physical scenario is observed for the ratio between the parallel and\nperpendicular components of the short-time diffusion coefficients of the dimer.\nThis dynamical behavior is corroborated by means of Molecular Dynamics computer\nsimulations that explicitly include the particle-particle hydrodynamic forces\ninduced by the solvent. Thus, our results point out toward that the effects of\nthe particle-particle hydrodynamic interactions on the diffusion coefficients\nare identical and, thus, factorable in both species.\n", "  The coexistence and competition between superconductivity and electronic\norders, such as spin or charge density waves, have been a central issue in high\ntransition-temperature (${T_{\\rm c}}$) superconductors. Unlike other iron-based\nsuperconductors, FeSe exhibits nematic ordering without magnetism whose\nrelationship with its superconductivity remains unclear. More importantly, a\npressure-induced fourfold increase of ${T_{\\rm c}}$ has been reported, which\nposes a profound mystery. Here we report high-pressure magnetotransport\nmeasurements in FeSe up to $\\sim9$ GPa, which uncover a hidden magnetic dome\nsuperseding the nematic order. Above ${\\sim6}$ GPa the sudden enhancement of\nsuperconductivity (${T_{\\rm c}\\le38.3}$ K) accompanies a suppression of\nmagnetic order, demonstrating their competing nature with very similar energy\nscales. Above the magnetic dome we find anomalous transport properties\nsuggesting a possible pseudogap formation, whereas linear-in-temperature\nresistivity is observed above the high-${T_{\\rm c}}$ phase. The obtained phase\ndiagram highlights unique features among iron-based superconductors, but bears\nsome resemblance to that of high-${T_{\\rm c}}$ cuprates.\n", "  The nuclear fusion is a reaction to form a compound nucleus. It plays an\nimportant role in several circumstances in nuclear physics as well as in\nnuclear astrophysics, such as synthesis of superheavy elements and\nnucleosynthesis in stars. Here we discuss two recent theoretical developments\nin heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The first\ntopic is a generalization of the Wong formula for fusion cross sections in a\nsingle-channel problem. By introducing an energy dependence to the barrier\nparameters, we show that the generalized formula leads to results practically\nindistinguishable from a full quantal calculation, even for light symmetric\nsystems such as $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C, for which fusion cross sections show an\noscillatory behavior. We then discuss a semi-microscopic modeling of heavy-ion\nfusion reactions, which combine the coupled-channels approach to the\nstate-of-the-art nuclear structure calculations for low-lying collective\nmotions. We apply this method to subbarrier fusion reactions of\n$^{58}$Ni+$^{58}$Ni and $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni systems, and discuss the role of\nanharmonicity of the low-lying vibrational motions.\n", "  In four space-time dimensions General Relativity can be non-trivially\ndeformed. Deformed theories continue to describe two propagating degrees of\nfreedom, as GR. We study Euclidean black hole thermodynamics in these\ndeformations. We use the recently developed formulation that works with SO(3)\nconnections as well as certain matrices M of auxiliary fields. We show that the\nblack hole entropy is given by one quarter of the horizon area as measured by\nthe Lie algebra valued two-form MF, where F is the connection curvature. This\ncoincides with the horizon area as measured by the metric only for the case of\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  We consider charged black holes in four dimensional AdS space, in the\npresence of a Weyl correction. We obtain the solution including the effect of\nback-reaction, perturbatively up to first order in the Weyl coupling, and study\nits thermodynamic properties. This is complemented by a calculation of the\nholographic entanglement entropy of the boundary theory. The consistency of\nresults obtained from both computations is established.\n", "  We critically reassess the theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model\ncalculation of the $B \\to K^* \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ observables, focusing on the low\n$q^2$ region. We point out that even optimized observables are affected by\nsizable uncertainties, since hadronic contributions generated by\ncurrent-current operators with charm are difficult to estimate, especially for\n$q^2 \\sim 4 m_c^2\\simeq 6.8$ GeV$^2$. We perform a detailed numerical analysis\nand present both predictions and results from the fit obtained using most\nrecent data. We find that non-factorizable power corrections of the expected\norder of magnitude are sufficient to give a good description of current\nexperimental data within the Standard Model. We discuss in detail the $q^2$\ndependence of the corrections and their possible interpretation as shifts of\nthe Standard Model Wilson coefficients.\n", "  The recent explosive growth of small satellite operations driven primarily\nfrom an academic or pedagogical need, has demonstrated the viability of\ncommercial-off-the-shelf technologies in space. They have also leveraged and\nshown the need for development of compatible sensors primarily aimed for Earth\nobservation tasks including monitoring terrestrial domains, communications and\nengineering tests. However, one domain that these platforms have not yet made\nsubstantial inroads into, is in the ocean sciences. Remote sensing has long\nbeen within the repertoire of tools for oceanographers to study dynamic large\nscale physical phenomena, such as gyres and fronts, bio-geochemical process\ntransport, primary productivity and process studies in the coastal ocean. We\nargue that the time has come for micro and nano satellites (with mass smaller\nthan 100 kg and 2 to 3 year development times) designed, built, tested and\nflown by academic departments, for coordinated observations with robotic assets\nin situ. We do so primarily by surveying SmallSat missions oriented towards\nocean observations in the recent past, and in doing so, we update the current\nknowledge about what is feasible in the rapidly evolving field of platforms and\nsensors for this domain. We conclude by proposing a set of candidate ocean\nobserving missions with an emphasis on radar-based observations, with a focus\non Synthetic Aperture Radar.\n", "  Since general relativity is a consistent low energy effective field theory,\nit is possible to compute quantum corrections to classical forces. Here we\ncompute a quantum correction to the gravitational potential between a pair of\npolarizable objects. We study two distant bodies and compute a quantum force\nfrom their induced quadrupole moments due to two graviton exchange. The effect\nis in close analogy to the Casimir-Polder and London-van der Waals forces\nbetween a pair of atoms from their induced dipole moments due to two photon\nexchange. The new effect is computed from the shift in vacuum energy of metric\nfluctuations due to the polarizability of the objects. We compute the potential\nenergy at arbitrary distances compared to the wavelengths in the system,\nincluding the far and near regimes. In the far distance, or retarded, regime,\nthe potential energy takes on a particularly simple form:\n$V(r)=-3987\\,\\hbar\\,c\\,G^2\\alpha_{1S}\\,\\alpha_{2S}/(4\\,\\pi\\,r^{11})$, where\n$\\alpha_{1S},\\,\\alpha_{2S}$ are the static gravitational quadrupole\npolarizabilities of each object. We provide estimates of this effect.\n", "  In recent work, we demonstrated that the confined-phase spectrum of\nnon-supersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theory coincides with the spectrum of the\nchiral sector of a two-dimensional conformal field theory in the large-$N$\nlimit. This was done within the tractable setting in which the gauge theory is\ncompactified on a three-sphere whose radius is small compared to the strong\nlength scale. In this paper, we generalize these observations by demonstrating\nthat similar results continue to hold even when massless adjoint matter fields\nare introduced. These results hold for both thermal and $(-1)^F$-twisted\npartition functions, and collectively suggest that the spectra of large-$N$\nconfining gauge theories are organized by the symmetries of two-dimensional\nconformal field theories.\n", "  Recently it has been shown that the peak of the quarkonium entropy at the\ndeconfinement transition is related to the emergent entropic force which\ndestructs the quarkonium. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider\ndissociation of a moving heavy quarkonium by entropic force. We find that the\nentropic force destructs the moving quarkonium easier than the static case\nwhich is expected from perturbative weakly coupled plasma. By considering the\nMaxwell charge, we study the effect of medium on the destruction of heavy\nquarkonium. It is shown that the quarkonium dissociates easier in the medium.\n", "  A comparison between the semi-classical approximation and the full quantum\ncalculation with a complex absorbing potential is made with a model of the\nfission of 258Fm. The potential barrier is obtained with the constrained Skyrme\nHF+BCS theory. The life-time obtained by the two calculations agree with each\nother the difference being only by 25%.\n", "  Recently, ATLAS and CMS collaboration reported an excess in the diphoton\nevents, which can be explained by a new resonance with mass around 750 GeV. In\nthis work, we explored the possibility of identifying if the hypothetical new\nresonance is produced through gluon-gluon fusion or quark-antiquark\nannihilation, or tagging the beam. Three different observables for beam\ntagging, namely the rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of the\ndiphoton, and one tagged bottom-jet cross section, are proposed. Combining the\ninformation gained from these observables, a clear distinction of the\nproduction mechanism for the diphoton resonance is promising.\n", "  Recently, an excess of events in diphoton channel with invariant mass of\nabout 750 GeV has been reported by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations.\nConsidering it as a tantalizing hint for new physics beyond the Standard Model\n(SM), we propose a simple extension of the SM with an additional doublet Higgs\n$H^{'}$ and a singlet $s$. We consider the neutral component $H^{\\prime }_0$ of\n$H'$ as the 750 GeV resonance, and assume that $s$ is lighter than 2.6 GeV. In\nparticular, $H^{\\prime }_0$ can be produced at tree level via $q{\\bar q}$\nproduction, and decay into a pair of $s$ at tree level. And then $s$ can decay\ninto a pair of collimated photons, which cannot be distinguished at the LHC. We\nshow that the diphoton production cross section can be from 3 to 13 ${\\rm fb}$,\nthe decay width of $H^{\\prime }_0$ can be from 30 to 60 GeV, and all the\ncurrent experimental constraints including dijet constraint can be satisfied.\n", "  The scattering amplitudes of planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills exhibit a number\nof remarkable analytic structures, including dual conformal symmetry and\nlogarithmic singularities of integrands. The amplituhedron is a geometric\nconstruction of the integrand that incorporates these structures. This\ngeometric construction further implies the amplitude is fully specified by\nconstraining it to vanish on spurious residues. By writing the amplitude in a\ndlog basis, we provide nontrivial evidence that these analytic properties and\n\"zero conditions\" carry over into the nonplanar sector. This suggests that the\nconcept of the amplituhedron can be extended to the the nonplanar sector of N =\n4 super-Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  The dielectric properties of complex plasma containing either metal or\ndielectric spherical inclusions (macroparticles, dust) are investigated. We\nfocus on surface plasmon resonances on the macroparticle surfaces and their\neffect on electromagnetic wave propagation. It is demonstrated that the\npresence of surface plasmon oscillations significantly modifies plasma\nelectromagnetic properties by resonances and cutoffs in the effective\npermittivity. This leads to related branches of electromagnetic waves and to\nthe wave band gaps. The results are discussed in the context of dusty plasma\nexperiments.\n", "  We calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity $\\sigma_{xy}$ of the surface\nstates {in cubic topological Kondo insulators}. We consider a generic model for\nthe surface states with three Dirac cones on the (001) surface. The Fermi\nvelocity, the Fermi momentum and the Zeeman energy in different Dirac pockets\nmay be unequal. The microscopic impurity potential mediates mixed intra and\ninterband extrinsic scattering processes. Our calculation of $\\sigma_{xy}$ is\nbased on the Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. It includes diffractive skew\nscattering contributions originating from the rare two-impurity complexes.\nRemarkably, these contributions yield anomalous Hall conductivity that is\nindependent of impurity concentration, and thus is of the same order as other\nknown extrinsic side jump and skew scattering terms. We discuss various special\ncases of our results and the experimental relevance of our study in the context\nof the recent hysteretic magnetotransport data in SmB$_6$ samples.\n", "  We present analytical solutions to three qubits and a single-mode cavity\ncoupling system beyond the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). The zero-th order\napproximation gives correct solutions when the qubits are far detuned from the\ncavity. The first order approximation, called generalized rotating-wave\napproximation (GRWA), produces an effective solvable Hamiltonian with the same\nform as the ordinary RWA one and exhibits substantial improvements of energy\nlevels over the RWA even on resonance. Based on these analytical\neigen-solutions, we study both the bipartite entanglement and genuine\nmultipartite entanglement (GME). The dynamics of the concurrence and the GME\nusing the GRWA are in consistent with the numerical ones. Interestingly, the\nwell known sudden death of entanglement occurs in the bipartite entanglement\ndynamics but not in GME dynamics.\n", "  We demonstrate magic wavelengths, at which external electric field produces\nnull differential Stark shifts, for the $6s ~ {^2}S_{1/2}-6p ~ {^2}P_{1/2,3/2}$\ntransitions in the Cs atom due to circularly polarized light. In addition, we\nalso obtain magic wavelengths using linearly polarized light, in order to\nverify the previously reported values, and make a comparative study with the\nvalues obtained for circularly polarized light. A number of these wavelengths\nare found to be in the optical region and could be of immense interest to\nexperimentalists for carrying out high precision measurements. To obtain these\nwavelengths, we have calculated dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the ground,\n$6p ~{^2}P_{1/2}$ and $6p ~{^2}P_{3/2}$ states of Cs. We use the available\nprecise values of the electric dipole (E1) matrix elements of the transitions\nthat give the dominant contributions from the lifetime measurements of the\nexcited states. Other significantly contributing E1 matrix elements are\nobtained by employing a relativistic coupled-cluster singles and doubles\nmethod. The accuracies of the dynamic polarizabilities are substantiated by\ncomparing the static polarizability values with the corresponding experimental\nresults.\n", "  We study SU(N) Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in the presence of defects that\nshift the Chern-Simons level from a holographic point of view by embedding the\nsystem in string theory. The model is a D3-D7 system in Type IIB string theory,\nwhose gravity dual is given by the AdS soliton background with probe D7-branes\nattaching to the AdS boundary along the defects. We holographically renormalize\nthe free energy of the defect system with sources, from which we obtain the\ncorrelation functions for certain operators naturally associated to these\ndefects. We find interesting phase transitions when the separation of the\ndefects as well as the temperature are varied. We also discuss some\nimplications for the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect and for two-dimensional\nQCD.\n", "  In this paper we present a Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO) calculation\nof the production of a Higgs boson in association with a massive vector boson.\nWe include the decays of the unstable Higgs and vector bosons, resulting in a\nfully flexible parton-level Monte Carlo implementation. We also include all\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ contributions that occur in production for these\nprocesses: those mediated by the exchange of a single off-shell vector boson in\nthe $s$-channel, and those which arise from the coupling of the Higgs boson to\na closed loop of fermions. We study final states of interest for Run II\nphenomenology, namely $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$, $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $WW^*$. The\ntreatment of the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ decay includes QCD corrections at NLO.\nWe use the recently developed $N$-jettiness regularization procedure, and study\nits viability in the presence of a large final-state phase space by studying\n$pp\\rightarrow V(H\\rightarrow WW^*) \\rightarrow$ leptons.\n", "  Quantum correlations in a physical system are usually studied with respect to\na unique (fixed) decomposition of the system into subsystems, without fully\nexploiting the rich structure of the state-space. Here, we show several\nexamples in which the consideration of different ways to decompose a physical\nsystem enhances the quantum resources and accounts for a more flexible\ndefinition of quantumness-measures. Furthermore, we give a new perspective\nregarding how to reassess the fact that local operations play a key role in\ngeneral quantumness-measures that go beyond entanglement --as discord-like\nones. We propose a way to quantify the maximum quantumness of a given state.\nApplying our definition to low-dimensional bipartite states, we show that\ndifferent behaviours are reported for separable and entangled states than those\ncorresponding to the usual measures of quantum correlations. We show that there\nis a close link between our proposal and the criterion to witness quantum\ncorrelations based on the rank of the correlation matrix, proposed by Daki\\'c,\nVedral and Brukner.\n", "  Newtonian spherically symmetric transonic accretion has been studied by\nincluding the mass of the accreting matter, while considering the growth of the\naccretor itself to be negligibly small. A novel iterative method has been\nintroduced to accomplish that task. It has been demonstrated that the inclusion\nof the mass of the fluid changes the critical properties of the flow as well as\nthe topological phase portraits of the stationary integral solution.\n", "  In this work we study the de Haas van Alfhen (dHvA) effect for neutral atoms\nwith a nonvanishing magnetic moment interacting with an electric field.\nConsidering the particles confined in a two dimensional (2D) atomic cloud and\nusing the Landau-Aharonov-Casher (LAC) theory, we obtain the effective magnetic\nfield as well as the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the system.\nAssuming the neutral atoms as being $ ^{87}\\mathrm{Rb} $ ultracold Rydberg\natoms we calculate the degeneracy of the energy levels. Under a strong\neffective magnetic field regime we present the quantum oscillations in the\nenergy and effective magnetization of the atomic gas. From the dHvA period we\ndetermine the area of the Fermi circle of the atomic cloud.\n", "  We study the breaking of gauge symmetry for higher spin theory on AdS_4 dual\nto the 3d critical O(N) vector model. It was argued that the breaking is due to\nthe change of boundary condition for a scalar field through a loop effect and\nthe Goldstone modes are bound states of a scalar field and higher spin field.\nThe masses of higher spin fields were obtained from the anomalous dimensions of\ndual currents at the leading order in 1/N, and we reproduce them from the O(N)\nvector model in the conformal perturbation theory. The anomalous dimensions can\nbe computed from the bulk theory using Witten diagrams, and we show that the\nbulk computation reduces to the boundary one in the conformal perturbation\ntheory. With this fact our computation provides an additional support for the\nbulk interpretation.\n", "  We study the possibility of explaining the recently reported 750 GeV\ndi-photon excess at LHC within the framework of a left-right symmetric model.\nThe 750 GeV neutral scalar in the model is dominantly an admixture of neutral\ncomponents of scalar bidoublets with a tiny fraction of neutral scalar triplet.\nIncorporating $SU(2)$ septuplet scalar pairs into the model, we enhance the\npartial decay width of the 750 GeV neutral scalar into di-photons through\ncharged septuplet components in loop while keeping the neutral septuplet\ncomponents as subdominant dark matter candidates. The model also predicts the\ndecay width of the 750 GeV scalar to be around 36 GeV to be either confirmed or\nruled out by future LHC data. The requirement of producing the correct\ndi-photon signal automatically keeps the septuplet dark matter abundance\nsubdominant in agreement with bounds from direct and indirect detection\nexperiments. We then briefly discuss different possibilities to account for the\nremaining dark matter component of the Universe in terms of other particle\ncandidates whose stability arise either due to remnant discrete symmetry after\nspontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ or due to high $SU(2)$-dimension\nforbidding their decay into lighter particles.\n", "  We study the evolution of the rotation rate of a proto-neutron star, born in\na core-collapse supernova, in the first seconds of its life. During this phase,\nthe star evolution can be described as a sequence of stationary configurations,\nwhich we determine by solving the neutrino transport and the stellar structure\nequations in general relativity. We include in our model the angular momentum\nloss due to neutrino emission. We find that the requirement of a rotation rate\nnot exceeding the mass-shedding limit at the beginning of the evolution implies\na strict bound on the rotation rate at later times. Moreover, assuming that the\nproto-neutron star is born with a finite ellipticity, we determine the emitted\ngravitational wave signal, and estimate its detectability by present and future\nground-based interferometric detectors.\n", "  We investigate the inflaton decay and reheating period after the end of\ninflation in the non-minimal derivative coupling (NDC) model with chaotic\npotential. In general, this model is known to provide an enhanced slow-roll\ninflation caused by gravitationally enhanced friction. We find violent\noscillations of Hubble parameter which induces oscillations of the sound speed\nsquared, implying the Lagrangian instability of curvature perturbation $\\zeta$\nunder the comoving gauge $\\varphi=0$. Also, it is shown that the curvature\nperturbation blows up at $\\dot{\\phi}=0$, leading to the breakdown of the\ncomoving gauge at $\\dot{\\phi}=0$. Therefore, we use the Newtonian gauge to\nperform the perturbation analysis where the Newtonian potential is employed as\na physical variable. The curvature perturbation is not considered as a physical\nvariable which describes a relevant perturbation during reheating.\n", "  The Electroweak interactions of a strongly coupled gauge theory are discussed\nwith outlook beyond the Standard Model (BSM) under global and gauge anomaly\nconstraints. The theory is built on a minimal massless fermion doublet of the\nSU(2) BSM flavor group (bsm-flavor) with a confining gauge force at the TeV\nscale in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the BSM SU(3) color\ngauge group (bsm-color). The intriguing possibility of near-conformal sextet\ngauge dynamics could lead to the minimal realization of the composite Higgs\nmechanism with a light $0^{++}$ scalar, far separated from strongly coupled\nresonances of the confining gauge force in the 2-3 TeV range, distinct from\nHiggsless Technicolor. In previous publications we have presented results for\nthe meson spectrum of the theory, including the light composite scalar, perhaps\nthe emergent Higgs impostor. Here we discuss the critically important role of\nthe baryon spectrum in the sextet model investigating its compatibility with\nwhat we know about thermal evolution of the early Universe including its\ngalactic and terrestrial relics. For an important application, we report the\nfirst numerical results on the baryon spectrum of this theory from\nnon-perturbative lattice simulations with baryon correlators in the staggered\nfermion implementation of the strongly coupled gauge sector. The quantum\nnumbers of composite baryons and their spectroscopy from lattice simulations\nare required inputs for exploring dark matter contributions of the sextet BSM\nmodel, as outlined for future work.\n", "  We discuss BMS supertranslations both at null-infinity and on the horizon for\nthe case of the Schwarzschild black hole. We show that both kinds of\nsupertranslations lead to infinetly many gapless physical excitations. On this\nbasis we construct a quotient algebra using suited superpositions of both kinds\nof transformations which cannot be compensated by an ordinary\nBMS-supertranslation and therefore are intrinsically due to the presence of an\nevent horizon. We show that these quotient transformations are physical and\ngenerate gapless excitations on the horizon that can account for the\ngravitational hair as well as for the black hole entropy. We identify the\nphysics of these modes as associated with Bogolioubov-Goldstone modes due to\nquantum criticality. Classically the number of these gapless modes is infinite.\nHowever, we show that due to quantum criticality the actual amount of\ninformation-carriers becomes finite and consistent with Bekenstein entropy.\nAlthough we only consider the case of Schwarzschild geometry, the arguments are\nextendable to arbitrary space-times containing event horizons.\n", "  One of the major open questions in the neutrino sector is the issue of\nleptonic CP violation. Current global oscillation data shows a mild preference\nfor a large, potentially maximal value for the Dirac CP phase in the neutrino\nmixing matrix. In this letter, we point out that New Physics in the form of\nneutral-current like non-standard interactions with real couplings would likely\nyield a similar conclusion even if CP in the neutrino sector were conserved.\nTherefore, the claim for a discovery of leptonic CP violation will require a\nrobust ability to test New Physics scenarios.\n", "  We provide a novel action principle for nonrelativistic ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics in the Eulerian scheme exploiting a Clebsch-type\nparametrisation. Both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations have been\nconsidered. Within the Hamiltonian framework, two complementary approaches have\nbeen discussed using Dirac's constraint analysis. In one case the Hamiltonian\nis canonical involving only physical variables but the brackets have a\nnoncanonical structure, while the other retains the canonical structure of\nbrackets by enlarging the phase space. The special case of incompressible\nmagnetohydrodynamics is also considered where, again, both the approaches are\ndiscussed in the Hamiltonian framework. The conservation of the stress tensor\nreveals interesting aspects of the theory.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss new features of SecDec-3.0, a public program\nfor the evaluation of dimensionally-regulated parametric integrals using sector\ndecomposition. We will focus on two main aspects: the implementation of an\nimproved geometric decomposition algorithm and the recently added support for\ncomplex masses.\n", "  We investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of FeSe monolayer on\nthe anisotropic SrTiO$_3$ (110) surface. With compressive strain along\n$[1\\bar{1}0]$ direction from the substrate, the monolayer FeSe possesses a\nstaggered bipartite iron lattice with an height difference around 0.06\\AA~\nalong the out-plane direction. The staggering causes stronger magnetic\nfrustration between the collinear and checkerboard antiferromagnetic orders,\nand the strain elongates one electron and two hole pockets along the strain\ndirection and the remaining hole pocket along the orthogonal direction. The\nstrain-induced band splitting at $\\Gamma$ can also result in a band inversion\nto drive the system into a topologically nontrivial phase. The absence of\nstrong superconducting suppression on the staggered lattice suggests that the\nsuperconducting pairings may be insensitive to the modification of interactions\nand hopping parameters between two Fe sublattices.\n", "  Clamping loss limits the quality factor of mechanical mode in the\noptomechanical resonators supported with the supporting stem. Using the\nmechanical bound state in the continuum, we have found that the mechanical\nclamping loss can be avoided. The mechanical quality factor of microsphere\ncould be achieved up to 10^8 for a specific radius of the stem, where the\ndifferent coupling channels between the resonator and supporting stem are\northogonal to each other. Such mechanism is proved to be universal for\ndifferent geometries and materials, thus can also be generalized to design the\nhigh quality mechanical resonators.\n", "  The usual assumption in direct dark matter searches is to only consider the\nspin-dependent or spin-independent scattering of dark matter particles.\nHowever, especially in models with light dark matter particles\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{GeV/c^2})$, operators which carry additional powers of the\nmomentum transfer $q^2$ can become dominant. One such model based on asymmetric\ndark matter has been invoked to overcome discrepancies in helioseismology and\nan indication was found for a particle with preferred mass of 3\n$\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ and cross section of $10^{-37} \\mathrm{cm^2}$. Recent data\nfrom the CRESST-II experiment, which uses cryogenic detectors based on\n$\\mathrm{CaWO_4}$ to search for nuclear recoils induced by dark matter\nparticles, are used to constrain these momentum-dependent models. The low\nenergy threshold of 307 eV for nuclear recoils of the detector used, allows us\nto rule out the proposed best fit value above.\n", "  I perform a combined analysis of the ATLAS and CMS diphoton data, using both\nRun-I and Run-II results, including those released at the 2016 Moriond\nconference. I find combining the ATLAS and CMS results from Run-II increases\nthe statistical significance of the reported 750 GeV anomaly, assuming a spin-0\nmediator coupling to gluons or heavy quarks with a width much smaller than the\ndetector resolution. This significance does not decrease when the 8 TeV data is\nincluded. A spin-2 mediator is disfavored compared to the spin-0 case. The\ncross section required to fit the ATLAS anomaly is in tension with the\naggregate data, all of which prefers a smaller value. The best fit for all\nmodels I consider is a $4.0\\sigma$ local significance for a 750 GeV spin-0\nmediator coupling to gluons with a cross section of 4 fb at 13 TeV (assuming\nnarrow width) or 10~fb (assuming $\\Gamma=45$ GeV).\n", "  A large swath of strongly correlated electron systems can be associated with\nthe phenomena of preserved entropy and fragile magnetism. In this overview we\npresent our thoughts and plans for the discovery and development of lanthanide\nand transition metal based, strongly correlated systems that are revealed by\nsuppressed, fragile magnetism or grow out of preserved entropy. We will present\nand discuss current examples such as YbBiPt, YbAgGe, YbFe2Zn20, PrAg2In,\nBaFe2As2, CaFe2As2, LaCrSb3 and LaCrGe3 as part of our motivation and to\nprovide illustrative examples.\n", "  The possibility of fundamental theories with very many ground states, each\nwith different physical parameters, changes the way that we approach the major\nquestions of particle physics. Most importantly, it raises the possibility that\nthese different parameters could be realised in different domains in the larger\nuniverse. In this review, we survey the motivations for the multiverse and\nimpact of the idea of the multiverse on the search for new physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\n", "  The impact of a turbulent flow on wind-driven oceanic near-inertial waves is\nexamined using a linearised shallow-water model of the mixed layer. Modelling\nthe flow as a homogeneous and stationary random process with spatial scales\ncomparable to the wavelengths, we derive a transport (or kinetic) equation\ngoverning wave-energy transfers in both physical and spectral spaces. This\nequation describes the scattering of the waves by the flow which results in a\nredistribution of energy between waves with the same frequency (or,\nequivalently, with the same wavenumber) and, for isotropic flows, in the\nisotropisation of the wave field. The time scales for the scattering and\nisotropisation are obtained explicitly and found to be of the order of tens of\ndays for typical oceanic parameters. The predictions inferred from the\ntransport equation are confirmed by a series of numerical simulations.\n  Two situations in which near-inertial waves are strongly influenced by flow\nscattering are investigated through dedicated nonlinear shallow-water\nsimulations. In the first, a wavepacket propagating equatorwards as a result\nfrom the $\\beta$-effect is shown to be slowed down and dispersed both zonally\nand meridionally by scattering. In the second, waves generated by moving\ncyclones are shown to be strongly disturbed by scattering, leading again to an\nincreased dispersion.\n", "  Starburst galaxies have a highly increased star-formation rate compared to\nregular galaxies and inject huge amounts of kinetic power into the interstellar\nmedium via supersonic stellar winds, and supernova explosions. Supernova\nremnants, which are considered to be the main source of cosmic rays (CRs), form\nan additional, significant energy and pressure component and might influence\nthe star-formation process in a major way. Observations of starburst galaxies\nat \\gamma-ray energies gives us the unique opportunity to study non-thermal\nphenomena associated with hadronic CRs and their relation to the star-formation\nprocess. In this work, recent observations of starburst galaxies with space and\nground-based \\gamma-ray telescopes are being reviewed and the current state of\ntheoretical work on the \\gamma-ray emission is discussed. A special emphasis is\nput on the prospects of the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array for the\nstudy of starburst galaxies in particular and star-forming galaxies in general.\n", "  The quantum and classical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) alternative\nquantum walk (AQW) in the presence of decoherence have been discussed in\ndetail. For any kinds of decoherence, the analytic expressions for the moments\nof position distribution of AQW have been obtained. Taking the broken line\nnoise and coin-decoherence as examples of decoherence, we find that when the\ndecoherence only emerges in one direction, the anisotropic position\ndistribution pattern appears, and not all the motions of quantum walkers\nexhibit the transition from quantum to classical behaviors. The correlations\nbetween the walkers and the coin in 2D AQW have been discussed. The anisotropic\ncorrelations between walkers and coin have been revealed in the presence of\ndecoherence.\n", "  We prove a non-existence theorem for smooth AdS5 solutions with connected,\ncompact without boundary internal space that preserve strictly 24\nsupersymmetries. In particular, we show that D=11 supergravity does not admit\nsuch solutions, and that all such solutions of IIB supergravity are locally\nisometric to the AdS_5 * S^5 maximally supersymmetric background. Furthermore,\nwe prove that (massive) IIA supergravity also does not admit such solutions,\nprovided that the homogeneity conjecture for massive IIA supergravity is valid.\nIn the context of AdS/CFT these results imply that if strictly N=3\nsuperconformal theories in 4-dimensions exist, their gravitational dual\nbackgrounds are either singular or their internal spaces are not compact.\n", "  Graphene and carbon nanotubes have extraordinary mechanical and electronic\nproperties. Intrinsic line defects such as local non-hexagonal reconstructions\nor grain boundaries, however, significantly reduce the tensile strength, but\nfeature exciting electronic properties. Here, we address the properties of line\ndefects in graphene from first-principles on the level of full-potential\ndensity-functional theory, and assess doping as one strategy to strengthen such\nmaterials. We carefully disentangle the global and local effect of doping by\ncomparing results from the virtual crystal approximation with those from local\nsubstitution of chemical species, in order to gain a detailed understanding of\nthe breaking and stabilization mechanisms. We find that n-type doping or local\nsubstitution with nitrogen increases the ultimate tensile strength\nsignificantly. In particular, it can stabilize the defects beyond the ultimate\ntensile strength of the pristine material. We therefore propose this as a key\nstrategy to strengthen graphenic materials. Furthermore, we find that doping\nand/or applying external stress lead to tunable and technologically interesting\nmetal/semi-conductor transitions.\n", "  A sparse octree based parallel implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method\nfor non-uniform meshes is presented in this paper. To couple grids of different\nresolutions, a second order accurate compact interpolation is employed and\nfurther extended into three dimensions. This compact interpolation requires\nonly four source elements from the adjacent level for both two- and three\ndimensions. Thus, it reduces the computational and communication overhead in\nparallel executions. Moreover, the implementation of a weight based domain\ndecomposition algorithm and level-wise elements arrangement are explained in\ndetails. The second order convergence of both velocity and strain rate are\nvalidated numerically in the Taylor-Green vortex test case. Additionally, the\nlaminar flow around a cylinder at Re = 20, 100 and around a sphere at Re = 100\nis investigated. Good agreement between simulated results and those from\nliterature is observed, which provides further evidence for the accuracy of our\nmethod.\n", "  Several experiments search for \\mu - e flavour change, for instance in \\mu\n->e conversion, \\mu-> e \\gamma, and \\mu -> 3e. This paper studies how to\ntranslate these experimental constraints from low energy to a New Physics scale\nM >> mW. A basis of QCD and QED-invariant operators (as appropriate below mW)\nis constructed, then run to mW with one-loop RGEs of QCD and QED. At mW, these\noperators are matched onto SU(2)-invariant dimension-six operators, which can\ncontinue to run up with electroweak RGEs. As an example, the \\mu-> e \\gamma\nbound is translated to the scale M, where it constrains two sums of operators.\nThe constraints differ from those obtained in previous EFT analyses of \\mu -> e\n\\gamma, but reproduce the expected bounds on flavour-changing interactions of\nthe Z and the Higgs, because the matching at mW is pragmatically performed to\nthe loop order required to get the \"leading\" contribution.\n", "  As has been shown by Watanabe and Strogatz (WS) [Phys. Rev. Lett., 70, 2391\n(1993)], a population of identical phase oscillators, sine-coupled to a common\nfield, is a partially integrable system for any size: its dynamics reduces to\nequations for several collective variables. Here we develop a perturbation\napproach for weakly nonidentical ensembles. We calculate corrections to the WS\ndynamics for two types of perturbations: due to a distribution of natural\nfrequencies and of forcing terms, and due to small white noise. We demonstrate,\nthat in both cases the complex mean field for which the dynamical equations are\nwritten, is close up to the leading order in the perturbation to the Kuramoto\norder parameter. This supports validity of the dynamical reduction suggested by\nOtt and Antonsen [Chaos, 18, 037113 (2008)] for weakly inhomogeneous\npopulations.\n", "  We consider Langevin dynamics associated with a modified kinetic energy\nvanishing for small momenta. This allows us to freeze slow particles, and hence\navoid the re-computation of inter-particle forces, which leads to computational\ngains. On the other hand, the statistical error may increase since there are a\npriori more correlations in time. The aim of this work is first to prove the\nergodicity of the modified Langevin dynamics (which fails to be hypoelliptic),\nand next to analyze how the asymptotic variance on ergodic averages depends on\nthe parameters of the modified kinetic energy. Numerical results illustrate the\napproach, both for low-dimensional systems where we resort to a Galerkin\napproximation of the generator, and for more realistic systems using Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the temporal behavior of a quantum dot under\noff-resonant optical excitation targeted at fast acoustic phonon-assisted state\npreparation. We demonstrate that in a preparation process driven by short laser\npulses three processes can be identified: a dressing of the states during the\nswitch on of the laser pulse, a subsequent phonon-induced relaxation and an\nundressing at the end of the pulse. By analyzing excitation scenarios with\ndifferent pulse shapes we highlight the decisive impact of an adiabatic\nundressing on the final state in short pulse protocols. Furthermore, we show\nthat in exciton-biexciton systems the laser characteristics such as the pulse\ndetuning and the pulse length as well as the biexciton binding energy can be\nused to select the targeted quantum dot state.\n", "  A recent experiment [K. C. Lee et al., Science 334, 1253 (2011)] succeeded in\ndetecting entanglement between two macroscopic specks of diamonds, separated by\na macroscopic distance, at room temperature. This impressive results is a\nfurther confirmation of the validity of quantum theory in (at least parts of)\nthe mesoscopic and macroscopic domain, and poses a challenge to collapse\nmodels, which predict a violation of the quantum superposition principle, which\nis the bigger the larger the system. We analyze the experiment in the light of\nsuch models. We will show that the bounds placed by experimental data are\nweaker than those coming from matter-wave interferometry and\nnon-interferometric tests of collapse models.\n", "  We study the scope of the Large Hadron Collider in accessing a neutral Higgs\nboson of the $B-L$ Supersymmetric Standard Model. After assessing the surviving\nparameter space configurations following the Run 1 data taking, we investigate\nthe possibilities of detecting this object during Run 2. For the model\nconfigurations in which the mixing between such a state and the discovered\nStandard Model-like Higgs boson is non-negligible, there exist several channels\nenabling its discovery over a mass range spanning from $\\approx 140$ to\n$\\approx$ 500 GeV. For a lighter Higgs state, with mass of order 140 GeV, three\nchannels are accessible: $\\gamma\\gamma$, $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$, wherein the $Z$\nboson decays leptonically. For a heavier Higgs state, with mass above 250 GeV\n(i.e., twice the mass of the Higgs state discovered in 2012), the hallmark\nsignature is its decay in two such 125 GeV scalars, $h'\\to hh$, where $hh\\to\nb\\bar b \\gamma\\gamma$. In all such cases, significances above discovery can\noccur for already planned luminosities at the CERN machine.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the transmission of electrons through a pair of\n{\\delta}- function magnetic barriers in graphene in presence of external\nmonochromatic, linearly polarised and CW laser field. The transmission\ncoefficients are calculated in the framework of non-perturbative Floquet theory\nusing the transfer matrix method. It is noted that the usual Fabry-Perot\noscillations in transmission through the graphene magnetic barriers with larger\ninter barrier separation takes the shape of beating oscillations in presence of\nthe external laser field. The laser assisted transmission spectra are also\nfound to exhibit the characteristic Fano resonances (FR) for smaller values of\nthe inter barrier separation. The appearance of the perfect node in the beating\noscillation and the asymmetric Fano line shape can be controlled by varying the\nintensity of the laser field. The above features could provide some useful and\npotential information about the light - matter interactions and may be utilized\nin the graphene based optoelectronic device applications.\n", "  We calculate the zero-temperature impurity entropy of a junction of multiple\nquantum wires of interacting spinless fermions. Starting from a given\nsingle-particle S-matrix representing a fixed point of the renormalization\ngroup (RG) flows, we carry out fermionic perturbation theory in the bulk\ninteractions, with the perturbation series summed in the random phase\napproximation (RPA). The results agree completely with boundary conformal field\ntheory (BCFT) predictions of the ground state degeneracy, and also with known\nRG flows through the g-theorem.\n", "  We present an exploratory lattice study for the two-photon decay of $\\eta_c$\nusing $N_f=2$ twisted mass lattice QCD gauge configurations generated by the\nEuropean Twisted Mass Collaboration. Two different lattice spacings of\n$a=0.067$fm and $a=0.085$fm are used in the study, both of which are of\nphysical size of 2$fm$. The decay widths are found to be $1.025(5)$KeV for the\ncoarser lattice and $1.062(5)$KeV for the finer lattice respectively where the\nerrors are purely statistical. A naive extrapolation towards the continuum\nlimit yields $\\Gamma\\simeq 1.122(14)$KeV which is smaller than the previous\nquenched result and most of the current experimental results. Possible reasons\nare discussed.\n", "  Factorization of short- and long-distance interactions is severely broken in\nhard diffractive hadronic collisions. Interaction with the spectator partons\nleads to an interplay between soft and hard scales, which results in a leading\ntwist behavior of the cross section, on the contrary to the higher twist\npredicted by factorization. This feature is explicitly demonstrated for\ndiffractive radiation of abelian (Drell-Yan, gauge bosons, Higgs) and\nnon-abelian (heavy flavors) particles\n", "  We propose a unified approach to nonlinear modal analysis in dissipative\noscillatory systems. This approach eliminates conflicting definitions, covers\nboth autonomous and time-dependent systems, and provides exact mathematical\nexistence, uniqueness and robustness results. In this setting, a nonlinear\nnormal mode (NNM) is a set filled with small-amplitude recurrent motions: a\nfixed point, a periodic orbit or the closure of a quasiperiodic orbit. In\ncontrast, a spectral submanifold (SSM) is an invariant manifold asymptotic to a\nNNM, serving as the smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace of\nthe linearized system along the NNM. The existence and uniqueness of SSMs turns\nout to depend on a spectral quotient computed from the real part of the\nspectrum of the linearized system. This quotient may well be large even for\nsmall dissipation, thus the inclusion of damping is essential for firm\nconclusions about NNMs, SSMs and the reduced-order models they yield.\n", "  We theoretically investigate effect of a transverse electric field generated\nby side gates and a vertical electric field generated by top, back gates on\nenergy bands and transport properties of zigzag bilayer graphene ribbons\n(Bernal stacking). Using atomistic Tight Binding calculations and Green\nfunction formalism we demonstrate that bandgap is opened when either field is\napplied and even enlarged under simultaneous influence of the two fields.\nInterestingly, although vertical electric fields are widely used to control\nbandgap in bilayer graphene, here we show that transverse fields exhibit more\npositive effect in terms of modulating a larger range of bandgap and retaining\ngood electrical conductance. Seebeck effect is also demonstrated to be enhanced\nstrongly about 13 times for a zigzag bilayer graphene ribbons with 16 chain\nlines. These results may motivate new designs of devices made of bilayer\ngraphene ribbons using electric gates.\n", "  Coulomb drag between parallel quantum wells provides a uniquely sensitive\nmeasurement of electron correlations since the drag response depends on\ninteractions only. Recently it has been demonstrated that a new regime of\nstrong interactions can be accessed for devices consisting of two monlolayer\ngraphene (MLG) crystals, separated by few layer hexagonal boron-nitride. Here\nwe report measurement of Coulomb drag in a double bilayer graphene (BLG)\nstucture, where the interaction potential is anticipated to be yet further\nenhanced compared to MLG. At low temperatures and intermediate densities a new\ndrag response with inverse sign is observed, distinct from the momentum and\nenergy drag mechanisms previously reported in double MLG. We demonstrate that\nby varying the device aspect ratio the negative drag component can be\nsuppressed and a response showing excellent agreement with the density and\ntemperature dependance predicted for momentum drag in double BLG is found. Our\nresults pave the way for pursuit of emergent phases in strongly interacting\nbilayers, such as the exciton condensate.\n", "  We consider the propagation of several entangled photons through an\nelastically scattering medium and study statistical properties of their speckle\npatterns. We find the spatial correlations of multiphoton speckles and their\nsensitivity to changes of system parameters. Our analysis covers both the\ndirected-wave regime, where rays propagate almost ballistically while\nexperiencing small-angle diffusion, and the real-space diffusive regime. We\ndemonstrate that long-range correlations of the speckle patterns dominate\nexperimental signatures for large-aperture photon detectors. We also show that\nspeckle sensitivity depends strongly on the number of photons $N$ in the\nincoming beam, increasing as $\\sqrt{N}$ in the directed-wave regime and as $N$\nin the diffusive regime.\n", "  One of the main obstacles for extracting the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) from mm/submm observations is the pollution from the main Galactic\ncomponents: synchrotron, free-free and thermal dust emission. The feasibility\nof using simple neural networks to extract CMB has been demonstrated on both\ntemperature and polarization data obtained by the WMAP satellite. The main goal\nof this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of neural networks for\nextracting the CMB signal from the Planck polarization data with high\nprecision. Both auto-correlation and cross-correlation power spectra within a\nmask covering about 63 percent of the sky have been used together with a 'high\npass filter' in order to minimize the influence of the remaining systematic\nerrors in the Planck Q and U maps. Using the Planck 2015 released polarization\nmaps, a BB power spectrum have been extracted by \\textit{Multilayer Perceptron}\nneural networks. This spectrum contains a bright feature with signal to noise\nratios $\\simeq$ 4.5 within 200 $\\leq$ l $\\leq$ 250. The spectrum is\nsignificantly brighter than the BICEP2 2015 spectrum, with a spectral behaviour\nquite different from the 'canonical' models (weak lensing plus B-modes spectra\nwith different tensor to scalar ratios). The feasibility of the neural network\nto remove the residual systematics from the available Planck polarization data\nto a high level has been demonstrated.\n", "  Ever brighter light sources, fast parallel detectors, and advances in phase\nretrieval methods, have made ptychography a practical and popular imaging\ntechnique. Compared to previous techniques, ptychography provides superior\nrobustness and resolution at the expense of more advanced and time consuming\ndata analysis. By taking advantage of massively parallel architectures,\nhigh-throughput processing can expedite this analysis and provide microscopists\nwith immediate feedback. These advances allow real-time imaging at wavelength\nlimited resolution, coupled with a large field of view. Here, we introduce a\nset of algorithmic and computational methodologies used at the Advanced Light\nSource, and DOE light sources packaged as a CUDA based software environment\nnamed SHARP (http://camera.lbl.gov/sharp), aimed at providing state-of-the-art\nhigh-throughput ptychography reconstructions for the coming era of diffraction\nlimited light sources.\n", "  The low energy limit of the stress tensor, gauge current, and supercurrent\ntwo-point correlators are calculated in the background of the supersymmetric\nmagnetic brane solution to gauged five-dimensional supergravity constructed by\nAlmuhairi and Polchinski. The resulting correlators provide evidence for the\nemergence of an N=2 super-Virasoro algebra of right-movers, in addition to a\nbosonic Virasoro algebra and a $U(1) \\oplus U(1)$-current algebra of\nleft-movers (or the parity transform of left- and right-movers depending on the\nsign of the magnetic field), in the holographically dual strongly interacting\ntwo-dimensional effective field theory of the lowest Landau level.\n", "  In this article we investigate whether a theory based on a classical\nLagrangian for the minimal Standard-Model Extension (SME) can be quantized such\nthat the result is equal to the corresponding low-energy Hamilton operator\nobtained from the field-theory description. This analysis is carried out for\nthe whole collection of minimal Lagrangians found in the literature. The upshot\nis that first quantization can be performed consistently. The unexpected\nobservation is made that at first order in Lorentz violation and at second\norder in the velocity the Lagrangians are related to the Hamilton functions by\na simple transformation. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that this holds\nuniversally. This result is used successfully to obtain classical Lagrangians\nfor two complicated sectors of the minimal SME that have not been considered in\nthe literature so far. Therefore, it will not be an obstacle anymore to derive\nsuch Lagrangians even for involved sets of coefficients - at least to the level\nof approximation stated above.\n", "  We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons for the strongly\ncorrelated multi-component ion plasma expected in the outer layers of neutron\nstar's crust employing a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. This allows\nus to isolate the low energy response of the ions and use it to calculate the\nelectron scattering rate and the electron thermal conductivity. We find that\nthe scattering rate is enhanced by a factor 2-4 compared to earlier\ncalculations based on the simpler electron-impurity scattering formalism. This\nfindings directly impacts the interpretation of thermal relaxation observed in\ntransiently accreting neutron stars and has implications for the composition\nand nuclear reactions in the crust that occur during accretion.\n", "  An all-spherical catadioptic telescope with the angular field of view of\nseveral tens of degrees in diameter and spherical focal surface is proposed for\nthe monitoring of large sky areas. We provide a few examples of such a system\nwith the apertures up to 800 mm and the field of view $30^\\circ$ and $40^\\circ$\nin diameter. The curvature of the focal surface is repaid by high performance\nof the telescope. In particular, the diameter of a circle, that includes 80% of\nenergy in the polychromatic image of a star, is in the range $1.4'' - 1.9''$\nacross the field of $30^\\circ$ size and $2.2'' - 2.9''$ for the field of\n$40^\\circ$ size. Some ways of working with curved focal surfaces are discussed.\n", "  The field of gamma-ray astronomy has experienced impressive progress over the\nlast decade. Thanks to the advent of a new generation of imaging air Cherenkov\ntelescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS) and thanks to the launch of the Fermi-LAT\nsatellite, several thousand gamma-ray sources are known today, revealing an\nunexpected ubiquity of particle acceleration processes in the Universe. Major\nscientific challenges are still ahead, such as the identification of the nature\nof Dark Matter, the discovery and understanding of the sources of cosmic rays,\nor the comprehension of the particle acceleration processes that are at work in\nthe various objects. This paper presents some of the instruments and mission\nconcepts that will address these challenges over the next decades.\n", "  We numerically study the effect of short ranged potential disorder on\nmassless noninteracting three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl fermions, with a focus\non the question of the proposed quantum critical point separating the semimetal\nand diffusive metal phases. We determine the properties of the eigenstates of\nthe disordered Dirac Hamiltonian ($H$) and exactly calculate the density of\nstates (DOS) near zero energy, using a combination of Lanczos on $H^2$ and the\nkernel polynomial method on $H$. We establish the existence of two distinct\ntypes of low energy eigenstates contributing to the disordered density of\nstates in the weak disorder semimetal regime. These are (i) typical eigenstates\nthat are well described by linearly dispersing perturbatively dressed Dirac\nstates, and (ii) nonperturbative rare eigenstates that are weakly-dispersive\nand quasi-localized in the real space regions with the largest (and rarest)\nlocal random potential. Using twisted boundary conditions, we are able to\nsystematically find and study these two types of eigenstates. We find that the\nDirac states contribute low energy peaks in the finite-size DOS that arise from\nthe clean eigenstates which shift and broaden in the presence of disorder. On\nthe other hand, we establish that the rare quasi-localized eigenstates\ncontribute a nonzero background DOS which is only weakly energy-dependent near\nzero energy and is exponentially small at weak disorder. We find that the\nexpected semimetal to diffusive metal quantum critical point is converted to an\n{\\it avoided} quantum criticality that is \"rounded out\" by nonperturbative\neffects, with no signs of any singular behavior in the DOS near the Dirac\nenergy. We discuss the implications of our results for disordered Dirac and\nWeyl semimetals, and reconcile the large body of existing numerical work\nshowing quantum criticality with the existence of the rare region effects.\n", "  The Time-Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) is an SDSS-IV eBOSS subproject\nprimarily aimed at obtaining identification spectra of ~220,000\noptically-variable objects systematically selected from SDSS/Pan-STARRS1\nmulti-epoch imaging. We present a preview of the science enabled by TDSS, based\non TDSS spectra taken over ~320 deg^2 of sky as part of the SEQUELS survey in\nSDSS-III, which is in part a pilot survey for eBOSS in SDSS-IV. Using the\n15,746 TDSS-selected single-epoch spectra of photometrically variable objects\nin SEQUELS, we determine the demographics of our variability-selected sample,\nand investigate the unique spectral characteristics inherent in samples\nselected by variability. We show that variability-based selection of quasars\ncomplements color-based selection by selecting additional redder quasars, and\nmitigates redshift biases to produce a smooth quasar redshift distribution over\na wide range of redshifts. The resulting quasar sample contains systematically\nhigher fractions of blazars and broad absorption line quasars than from\ncolor-selected samples. Similarly, we show that M-dwarfs in the TDSS-selected\nstellar sample have systematically higher chromospheric active fractions than\nthe underlying M-dwarf population, based on their H-alpha emission. TDSS also\ncontains a large number of RR Lyrae and eclipsing binary stars with\nmain-sequence colors, including a few composite-spectrum binaries. Finally, our\nvisual inspection of TDSS spectra uncovers a significant number of peculiar\nspectra, and we highlight a few cases of these interesting objects. With a\nfactor of ~15 more spectra, the main TDSS survey in SDSS-IV will leverage the\nlessons learned from these early results for a variety of time-domain science\napplications.\n", "  We review the phenomenological framework for accessing Generalized Parton\nDistributions (GPDs) using measurements of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering\n(DVCS) from a proton target. We describe various GPD models and fitting\nprocedures, emphasizing specific challenges posed both by the internal\nstructure and properties of the GPD functions and by their relation to\nobservables. Bearing in mind forthcoming data of unprecedented accuracy, we\ngive a set of recommendations to better define the pathway for a precise\nextraction of GPDs from experiment.\n", "  We propose a method to holographically compute the conformal partial waves in\nany decomposition of correlation functions of primary operators in conformal\nfield theories using open Wilson network operators in the holographic\ngravitational dual. The Wilson operators are the gravitational ones where\ngravity is written as a gauge theory in the first order Hilbert-Palatini\nformalism. We apply this method to compute the global conformal blocks and\npartial waves in 2d CFTs reproducing many of the known results.\n", "  We elaborate on the idea that loop corrections to belief propagation could be\ndealt with in a systematic way on pairwise Markov random fields, by using the\nelements of a cycle basis to define region in a generalized belief propagation\nsetting. The region graph is specified in such a way as to avoid dual loops as\nmuch as possible, by discarding redundant Lagrange multipliers, in order to\nfacilitate the convergence, while avoiding instabilities associated to minimal\nfactor graph construction. We end up with a two-level algorithm, where a belief\npropagation algorithm is run alternatively at the level of each cycle and at\nthe inter-region level. The inverse problem of finding the couplings of a\nMarkov random field from empirical covariances can be addressed region wise. It\nturns out that this can be done efficiently in particular in the Ising context,\nwhere fixed point equations can be derived along with a one-parameter log\nlikelihood function to minimize. Numerical experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of these considerations both for the direct and inverse MRF\ninference.\n", "  This paper discusses the methods and the results used in an accompanying\npaper describing the matching of effective chiral Lagrangians in dimensional\nand lattice regularizations. We present methods to compute 2-loop massless\nsunset diagrams in finite asymmetric volumes in the framework of these\nregularizations. We also consider 1-loop sums in both regularizations,\nextending the results of Hasenfratz and Leutwyler for the case of dimensional\nregularization and we introduce a new method to calculate precisely the\nexpansion coefficients of the 1-loop lattice sums.\n", "  Large arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs), open at one end, could be\nused as target material for the directional detection of weakly interacting\ndark matter particles (WIMPs). As a result of a WIMP elastic scattering on a\nCNT, a carbon ion might be injected in the body of the array and propagate\nthrough multiple collisions within the lattice. The ion may eventually emerge\nfrom the surface with open end CNTs, provided that its longitudinal momentum is\nlarge enough to compensate energy losses and its transverse momentum approaches\nthe channeling conditions in a single CNT. Therefore, the angle formed between\nthe WIMP wind apparent orientation and the direction of parallel carbon\nnanotube axes must be properly chosen. We focus on very low ion recoil kinetic\nenergies, related to low mass WIMPs (~ 10 GeV) where most of the existing\nexperiments have low sensitivity. Relying on some exact results on\ntwo-dimensional lattices of circular obstacles, we study the low energy ion\nmotion in the transverse plane with respect to CNT directions. New constraints\nare obtained on how to devise the CNT arrays to maximize the detection\nefficiency.\n", "  We develop the theory of sparse multiplex networks with partially overlapping\nlinks based on their local tree-likeness. This theory enables us to find the\ngiant mutually connected component in a two-layer multiplex network with\narbitrary correlations between connections of different types. We find that\ncorrelations between the overlapping and non-overlapping links markedly change\nthe phase diagram of the system, leading to multiple hybrid phase transitions.\nFor assortative correlations we observe recurrent hybrid phase transitions.\n", "  We give a brief account of the Dyson-Schwinger and Faddeev-equation approach\nand its application to nucleon resonances and their transition form factors. We\ncompare the three-body with the quark-diquark approach and present a\nquark-diquark calculation for the low-lying nucleon resonances including\nscalar, axialvector, pseudoscalar and vector diquarks. We also discuss the\ntimelike structure of transition form factors and highlight the advantages of\nform factors over helicity amplitudes.\n", "  Among gauged dynamics motivated by string theory, we find many with gapless\nasymptotic directions. Although the natural boundary condition for ground\nstates is $L^2$, one often turns on chemical potentials or supersymmetric mass\nterms to regulate the infrared issues, instead, and computes the twisted\npartition function. We point out how this procedure generically fails to\ncapture physical $L^2$ Witten index with often misleading results. We also\nexplore how, nevertheless, the Witten index is sometimes intricately embedded\nin such twisted partition functions. For $d=1$ theories with gapless continuum\nsector from gauge multiplets, such as non-primitive quivers and pure\nYang-Mills, a further subtlety exists, leading to fractional expressions. Quite\nunexpectedly, however, the integral $L^2$ Witten index can be extracted\ndirectly and easily from the twisted partition function of such theories. This\nphenomenon is tied to the notion of the rational invariant that appears\nnaturally in the wall-crossing formulae, and offers a general mechanism of\nreading off Witten index directly from the twisted partition function. Along\nthe way, we correct early numerical results for some of $\\mathcal N=4,8,16$\npure Yang-Mills quantum mechanics, and count threshold bound states for general\ngauge groups beyond $SU(N)$.\n", "  We use numerical methods to exhaustively study a novel family of hairy black\nhole solutions in AdS$_5$. These solutions can be uplifted to solutions of type\nIIB supergravity with AdS$_5\\times S^5$ asymptotics and are thus expected to\nplay an important role in our understanding of AdS/CFT. We find an intricate\nphase diagram, with the aforementioned family of hairy black hole solutions\nbranching from the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole at the onset of the\nsuperradiance instability. We analyse black holes with spherical and planar\nhorizon topology and explain how they connect in the phase diagram. Finally, we\ndetail their global and local thermodynamic stability across several ensembles.\n", "  With an instantaneous view of 70% of the sky, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor (GBM) is an excellent partner in the search for electromagnetic\ncounterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events. GBM observations at the time of\nthe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914\nreveal the presence of a weak transient above 50 keV, 0.4~s after the GW event,\nwith a false alarm probability of 0.0022 (2.9$\\sigma$). This weak transient\nlasting 1 s was not detected by any other instrument and does not appear\nconnected with other previously known astrophysical, solar, terrestrial, or\nmagnetospheric activity. Its localization is ill-constrained but consistent\nwith the direction of GW150914. The duration and spectrum of the transient\nevent are consistent with a weak short Gamma-Ray Burst arriving at a large\nangle to the direction in which Fermi was pointing, where the GBM detector\nresponse is not optimal. If the GBM transient is associated with GW150914, this\nelectromagnetic signal from a stellar mass black hole binary merger is\nunexpected. We calculate a luminosity in hard X-ray emission between 1~keV and\n10~MeV of $1.8^{+1.5}_{-1.0} \\times 10^{49}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Future joint\nobservations of GW events by LIGO/Virgo and Fermi GBM could reveal whether the\nweak transient reported here is a plausible counterpart to GW150914 or a chance\ncoincidence, and will further probe the connection between compact binary\nmergers and short Gamma-Ray Bursts.\n", "  The recent results on $\\gamma_vpN^*$ electrocouplings from analyses of the\ndata on exclusive meson electroproduction off protons measured with the CLAS\ndetector at Jefferson Lab are presented. The impact of these results on the\nexploration of the excited nucleon state structure and non-perturbative strong\ninteraction dynamics behind its formation is outlined. The future extension of\nthese studies in the experiments with the CLAS12 detector in the upgraded\nHall-B at JLab will provide for the first time $\\gamma_vpN^*$ electrocouplings\nof all prominent resonances at the still unexplored distance scales that\ncorrespond to extremely low (0.05 GeV$^2 < Q^2 <$ 0.5 GeV$^2$) and the highest\nphoton virtualities (5.0 GeV$^2 < Q^2 <$ 12.0 GeV$^2$) ever achieved in the\nexclusive electroproduction measurements. The expected results will address the\nmost important open problems of the Standard Model: on the nature of more than\n98\\% of hadron mass, quark-gluon confinement and emergence of the excited\nnucleon state structure from the QCD Lagrangian, as well as allowing a search\nfor the new states of hadron matter predicted from the first principles of QCD,\nthe so-called hybrid baryons.\n", "  We present the general discussion on the inflection point inflation with\nsmall or large inflaton fields and show the effects of reheating dynamics on\nthe inflationary predictions. In order to compare the model predictions with\nprecisely measured CMB anisotropies and constrain the inflation models, the\nknowledge of the reheating dynamics is required. Inflection point inflation\nextended to the trans-Planckian regime can accommodate a sizable\ntensor-to-scalar ratio at the detectable level in the future CMB experiments.\n", "  The superconformal algebraic approach to hadronic physics is used to\nconstruct a semiclassical effective theory for nucleons which incorporates\nessential nonperturbative dynamical features, such as the emergence of a\nconfining scale and the Regge resonance spectrum. Relativistic bound-state\nequations for nucleons follow from the extension of superconformal quantum\nmechanics to the light front and its holographic embedding in a higher\ndimensional gravity theory. Superconformal algebra has been used elsewhere to\ndescribe the connections between the light mesons and baryons, but in the\npresent context it relates the fermion positive and negative chirality states\nand uniquely determines the confinement potential of nucleons. The holographic\nmapping of multi-quark bound states also leads to a light-front cluster\ndecomposition of form factors for an arbitrary number of constituents. The\nremarkable analytical structure which follows incorporates the correct scaling\nbehavior at high photon virtualities and also vector dominance at low energies.\n", "  This note is an extension of a recent work on the analytical bootstrapping of\n$O(N)$ models. An additonal feature of the $O(N)$ model is that the OPE\ncontains trace and antisymmetric operators apart from the symmetric-traceless\nobjects appearing in the OPE of the singlet sector. This in addition to the\nstress tensor $(T_{\\mu\\nu})$ and the $\\phi_i\\phi^i$ scalar, we also have other\nminimal twist operators as the spin-1 current $J_\\mu$ and the\nsymmetric-traceless scalar in the case of $O(N)$. We determine the effect of\nthese additional objects on the anomalous dimensions of the corresponding\ntrace, symmetric-traceless and antisymmetric operators in the large spin sector\nof the $O(N)$ model, in the limit when the spin is much larger than the twist.\nAs an observation, we also verified that the leading order results for the\nlarge spin sector from the $\\epsilon-$expansion are an exact match with our\n$n=0$ case. A plausible holographic setup for the special case when $N=2$ is\nalso mentioned which mimics the calculation in the CFT.\n", "  We analyse linear maps of operator algebras $\\mathcal{B}_H(\\mathcal{H})$\nmapping the set of rank-$k$ projectors onto the set of rank-$l$ projectors\nsurjectively. We give a complete characterisation of such maps for prime $n =\n\\dim\\mathcal{H}$. The solution is known for $k=l=1$ as the Wigner's theorem.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the phase noise, intensity and quadrature\nsqueezing power spectra of the transmitted field of a driven optical cavity\ncontaining an interacting one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. We show how\nthe pattern of the output power spectrum of the cavity changes due to the\nnonlinear effect of atomic collisions. Furthermore, it is shown that due to a\none-to-one correspondence between the splitting of the peaks in the phase noise\npower spectrum of the cavity output field and the \\textit{s}-wave scattering\nfrequency of the atom-atom interaction, one can measure the strength of\ninteratomic interaction. Besides, we show how the atomic collisions affect the\nsqueezing behavior of the output field.\n", "  The diagonal matrix elements\n$\\langle\\theta_1,\\theta_2|T_{2n}T_{-2n}|\\theta_1,\\theta_2\\rangle$ between\ntwo-particle states in the sinh-Gordon model are computed analytically for all\nintegers $n>0$. This confirms the proposal by F. Smirnov and A. Zamolodchikov\nfor these matrix elements and demonstrates effectiveness of the algebraic\napproach to form factors.\n", "  We obtain the effective theory for the non-linear dynamics of black\nbranes---both neutral and charged, in asymptotically flat or Anti-deSitter\nspacetimes---to leading order in the inverse-dimensional expansion. We find\nthat black branes evolve as viscous fluids, but when they settle down they are\nmore naturally viewed as solutions of an elastic soap-bubble theory. The two\nviews are complementary: the same variable is regarded in one case as the\nenergy density of the fluid, in the other as the deformation of the elastic\nmembrane. The large-D theory captures finite-wavelength phenomena beyond the\nconventional reach of hydrodynamics. For asymptotically flat charged black\nbranes (either Reissner-Nordstrom or p-brane-charged black branes) it yields\nthe non-linear evolution of the Gregory-Laflamme instability at large D and its\nendpoint at stable non-uniform black branes. For Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black\nbranes we find that sound perturbations do not propagate (have purely imaginary\nfrequency) when their wavelength is below a certain charge-dependent value. We\nalso study the polarization of black branes induced by an external electric\nfield.\n", "  In composite Higgs models the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Goldstone boson\nfrom a strongly-interacting sector. Fermion mass generation is possible through\npartial compositeness accompanied by the appearance of new heavy fermionic\nresonances. The Higgs couplings to the Standard Model (SM) particles and\nbetween the Higgs bosons themselves are modified with respect to the SM. Higgs\npair production is sensitive to the trilinear Higgs self-coupling but also to\nanomalous couplings like the novel 2-Higgs-2-fermion coupling emerging in\ncomposite Higgs models. The QCD corrections to SM Higgs boson pair production\nare known to be large. In this paper we compute, in the limit of heavy loop\nparticle masses, the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to Higgs pair\nproduction in composite Higgs models without and with new heavy fermions. The\nrelative QCD corrections are found to be almost insensitive both to the\ncompositeness of the Higgs boson and to the details of the heavy fermion\nspectrum, since the leading order cross section dominantly factorizes. With the\nobtained results we investigate the question if, taking into account Higgs\ncoupling constraints, new physics could first be seen in Higgs pair production.\nWe find this to be the case in the high-luminosity option of the LHC for\ncomposite Higgs models with heavy fermions. We also investigate the invariant\nmass distributions at NLO QCD. While they are sensitive to the Higgs\nnon-linearities and hence anomalous couplings, the influence of the heavy\nfermions is much less pronounced.\n", "  We analyze the lowest spectral moments of the left-right two-point\ncorrelation function, using all known short-distance constraints and the\nrecently updated ALEPH V-A spectral function from tau decays. This information\nis used to determine the low-energy couplings L10 and C87 of chiral\nperturbation theory and the lowest-dimensional contributions to the Operator\nProduct Expansion of the left-right correlator. A detailed statistical analysis\nis implemented to assess the theoretical uncertainties, including violations of\nquark-hadron duality.\n", "  Unlike most quantum systems which rapidly become incoherent as temperature is\nraised, strong correlations persist at elevated temperatures in $S=1/2$ dimer\nmagnets, as revealed by the unusual asymmetric lineshape of their excitations\nat finite temperatures. Here we quantitatively explore and parameterize the\nstrongly correlated magnetic excitations at finite temperatures using the high\nresolution inelastic neutron scattering on the model compound\nBaCu$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ which we show to be an alternating\nantiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic spin$-1/2$ chain. Comparison to state of the\nart computational techniques shows excellent agreement over a wide temperature\nrange. Our findings hence demonstrate the possibility to quantitatively predict\ncoherent behavior at elevated temperatures in quantum magnets.\n", "  A recently introduced one-dimensional three-orbital Hubbard model displays\norbital-selective Mott phases with exotic spin arrangements such as spin block\nstates [J. Rinc\\'on {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{112}, 106405\n(2014)]. In this publication we show that the Constrained-Path Quantum Monte\nCarlo (CPQMC) technique can accurately reproduce the phase diagram of this\nmultiorbital one-dimensional model, paving the way to future CPQMC studies in\nsystems with more challenging geometries, such as ladders and planes. The\nsuccess of this approach relies on using the Hartree-Fock technique to prepare\nthe trial states needed in CPQMC. We also study a simplified version of the\nmodel where the pair-hopping term is neglected and the Hund coupling is\nrestricted to its Ising component. The corresponding phase diagrams are shown\nto be only mildly affected by the absence of these technically\ndifficult-to-implement terms. This is confirmed by additional Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group and Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo calculations carried\nout for the same simplified model, with the latter displaying only mild Fermion\nsign problems. We conclude that these methods are able to capture\nquantitatively the rich physics of the several orbital-selective Mott phases\n(OSMP) displayed by this model, thus enabling computational studies of the OSMP\nregime in higher dimensions, beyond static or dynamic mean field\napproximations.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei can be copious extragalactic emitters of MeV-GeV-TeV\ngamma rays, a phenomenon linked to the presence of relativistic jets powered by\na super-massive black hole in the center of the host galaxy. Most of gamma-ray\nemitting active galactic nuclei, with more than 1500 known at GeV energies, and\nmore than 60 at TeV energies, are called \"blazars\". The standard blazar\nparadigm features a jet of relativistic magnetized plasma ejected from the\nneighborhood of a spinning and accreting super-massive black hole, close to the\nobserver direction. Two classes of blazars are distinguished from observations:\nthe flat-spectrum radio-quasar class (FSRQ) is characterized by strong external\nradiation fields, emission of broad optical lines, and dust tori. The BL Lac\nclass (from the name of one of its members, BL Lacertae) corresponds to weaker\nadvection-dominated flows with gamma-ray spectra dominated by the inverse\nCompton effect on synchrotron photons. This paradigm has been very successful\nfor modeling the broadband spectral energy distributions of blazars. However,\nmany fundamental issues remain, including the role of hadronic processes and\nthe rapid variability of those BL Lac objects whose synchrotron spectrum peaks\nat UV or X-ray frequencies. A class of gamma-ray--emitting radio galaxies,\nwhich are thought to be the misaligned counterparts of blazars, has emerged\nfrom the results of the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and of ground-based\nCherenkov telescopes. Blazars and their misaligned ounterparts make up most of\nthe >100 MeV extragalactic gamma ray background (EGB), and are uspected of\nbeing the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The future \"Cherenkov\nTelescope Array\", in synergy with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and a wide\nrange of telescopes in space and on he ground, will write the next chapter of\nblazar physics.\n", "  The nearly isotropic distribution of the TeV-PeV neutrinos recently detected\nby IceCube suggests that they come from sources at distance beyond our Galaxy,\nbut how far they are is largely unknown due to lack of any associations with\nknown sources. In this paper, we propose that the cumulative TeV gamma-ray\nemission accompanying the production of neutrinos can be used to constrain the\ndistance of these neutrino sources, since the opacity of TeV gamma rays due to\nabsorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) depends on the distance\nthat these TeV gamma rays have travelled. As the diffuse extragalactic TeV\nbackground measured by \\emph{Fermi} is much weaker than the expected cumulative\nflux associated with IceCube neutrinos, the majority of IceCube neutrinos, if\ntheir sources are transparent to TeV gamma rays, must come from distances\nlarger than the horizon of TeV gamma rays. We find that above 80\\% of the\nIceCube neutrinos should come from sources at redshift $z>0.5$. Thus, the\nchance for finding nearby sources correlated with IceCube neutrinos would be\nsmall. We also find that, to explain the flux of neutrinos under the TeV\ngamma-ray emission constraint, the redshift evolution of neutrino source\ndensity must be at least as fast as the the cosmic star-formation rate.\n", "  The Coulombic effect on the stability range of the photo-excited electron gas\non liquid helium is shown to favor formation of domains of different densities.\nDomains appear to eliminate or greatly reduce regions with negative\nconductivity. An analysis of the density domain structure allows explaining\nremarkable observations reported recently for the photo-excited electron gas.\n", "  The pressure evolution of the local structure of Fe2O3 hematite has been\ndetermined for the first time by extended x-ray absorption fine structure up to\n79 GPa. The comparison to the different high-pressure forms proposed in the\nliterature suggests that the orthorhombic structure with space group Aba2 is\nthe most probable. The crossover from Fe high-spin to low-spin states with\npressure increase has been monitored from the pre-edge region of the Fe K-edge\nabsorption spectra. The \"simultaneous\" comparison with the local structural\nchanges allows us to definitively conclude that it is the electronic transition\nthat drives the structural transition and not viceversa.\n", "  We highlight Hermiticity issues in bound-state equations whose kernels are\nsubject to a highly asymmetric mass and momentum distribution and whose\neigenvalue spectrum becomes complex for radially excited states. We trace back\nthe presence of imaginary components in the eigenvalues and wave functions to\ntruncation artifacts and suggest how they can be eliminated in the case of\ncharmed mesons. The solutions of the gap equation in the complex plane, which\nplay a crucial role in the analytic structure of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel, are\ndiscussed for several interaction models and qualitatively and quantitatively\ncompared to analytic continuations by means of complex-conjugate pole models\nfitted to real solutions.\n", "  The propagation of $\\gamma$ rays over very large distances provides new\ninsights on the intergalactic medium and on fundamental physics. On their path\nto the Earth, $\\gamma$ rays can annihilate with diffuse infrared or optical\nphotons of the intergalactic medium, producing $e^+ \\, e^-$ pairs. The density\nof these photons is poorly determined by direct measurements due to significant\ngalactic foregrounds. Studying the absorption of $\\gamma$ rays from\nextragalactic sources at different distances allows the density of low-energy\ndiffuse photons to be measured. Gamma-ray propagation may also be affected by\nnew phenomena predicted by extensions of the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. Lorentz Invariance is violated in some models of Quantum Gravity,\nleading to an energy-dependent speed of light in vacuum. From differential\ntime-of-flight measurements of the most distant $\\gamma$-ray bursts and of\nflaring active galactic nuclei, lower bounds have been set on the energy scale\nof Quantum Gravity. Another effect that may alter $\\gamma$-ray propagation is\npredicted by some models of String Theory, namely the mixing of the $\\gamma$\nray with a light fundamental boson called an \"axion-like particle\", which does\nnot interact with low-energy photons. Such a mixing would make the Universe\nmore transparent to $\\gamma$ rays than what would otherwise be, in a sense it\ndecreases the amount of modification to the spectrum that comes from the\nextragalactic background light. The present status of the search for all these\nphenomena in $\\gamma$-ray astronomy is reviewed.\n", "  We present a statistical study of the distribution and physical properties of\ncold dense material in and around the inner Galactic Plane near infrared\nbubbles as catalogued by the Milky Way Project citizen scientists. Using data\nfrom the ATLASGAL 870 um survey, we show that 48 +/- 2% of all cold clumps in\nthe studied survey region (|l| <= 65 degrees, |b| <= 1 degree) are found in\nclose proximity to a bubble, and 25 +/- 2% appear directly projected towards a\nbubble rim. A two-point correlation analysis confirms the strong correlation of\nmassive cold clumps with expanding bubbles. It shows an overdensity of clumps\nalong bubble rims that grows with increasing bubble size, which shows how\ninterstellar medium material is reordered on large scales by bubble expansion\naround regions of massive star formation. The highest column density clumps\nappear resistent to the expansion, remaining overdense towards the bubbles'\ninterior rather than being swept up by the expanding edge. Spectroscopic\nobservations in ammonia show that cold dust clumps near bubbles appear to be\ndenser, hotter and more turbulent than those in the field, offering\ncircumstantial evidence that bubble-associated clumps are more likely to be\nforming stars. These observed differences in physical conditions persist for\nbeyond the region of the bubble rims.\n", "  We study the phases of gravity coupled to a charged scalar and gauge field in\nan asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime ($AdS_4$) in the grand canonical\nensemble. For the conformally coupled scalar, an intricate phase diagram is\ncharted out between the four relevant solutions: global AdS, boson star,\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole and the hairy black hole. The nature of the phase\ndiagram undergoes qualitative changes as the charge of the scalar is changed,\nwhich we discuss. We also discuss the new features that arise in the extremal\nlimit.\n", "  We propose a new type of radiative neutrino model with a local hidden $U(1)$\nsymmetry, in which neutrino masses are induced at the three loop level, and\ndiscuss the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter candidates therein.\nBy allowing the hypercharges larger than 3/2 for new fields that contribute to\nthe neutrino masses and making them decay into the standard model fields\nappropriately, we introduce a lot of new particles with multiple electrical\ncharges in a natural manner. As a by-product, we can accommodate the 750 GeV\ndiphoton excess depending on the hypercharge quantum numbers of new fields\nresponsible for the neutrino masses at the three loop level.\n", "  We first make a Killing spinor analysis for a general three-dimensional\noff-shell $N=(2,0)$ supergravity and find conditions for a bosonic background\nto preserve some supersymmetry . We then consider a particular model, namely\n$N=(2,0)$ topologically massive supergravity and impose its field equations. By\nmaking a suitable ansatz on metric functions we find a large class of solutions\nthat include spacelike, timelike and null warped $AdS_3$ among others.\nIsometric quotients of spacelike and timelike squashed $AdS_3$ solutions yield\nextremal black holes without closed causal curves.\n", "  The paper determines the thermodynamic parameters of the superconducting\nstate in the metallic atomic hydrogen under the pressure at $1$ TPa, $1.5$ TPa,\nand $2.5$ TPa. The calculations were conducted in the framework of the\nEliashberg formalism. It has been shown that the critical temperature is very\nhigh (in the range from $301.2$ K to $437.3$ K), as well as high are the values\nof the electron effective mass (from $3.43$ $m_{e}$ to $6.88$ $m_{e}$), where\n$m_{e}$ denotes the electron band mass. The ratio of the low-temperature energy\ngap to the critical temperature explicitly violates the predictions of the BCS\ntheory: $2\\Delta\\left(0\\right)/k_{B}T_{C}\\in\\left<4.84,5.85\\right>$.\nAdditionally, the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal\nstate, the thermodynamic critical field, and the specific heat of the\nsuperconducting state have been determined. Due to the significant\nstrong-coupling and retardation effects those quantities cannot be correctly\ndescribed in the framework of the BCS theory.\n", "  Assuming four-quark structure for the $X$ resonances in low-lying region, we\ncalculate their masses using the color-spin interaction. In specific, the\nhyperfine masses of the color-spin interaction are calculated for the possible\nstates in spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 channels. The two states in spin-0 channel as\nwell as the two states in spin-1 channel are diagonalized in order to generate\nthe physical hyperfine masses. By matching the difference in hyperfine masses\nwith the splitting in corresponding hadron masses and using the $X(3872)$ mass\nas an input, we estimate the masses corresponding to the states $J^{PC}=0^{++},\n1^{+-},2^{++}$. We find the masses of two states in $1^{+-}$ are close to those\nof $X(3823)$, $X(3900)$, and the mass of the $2^{++}$ state is close to that of\n$X(3940)$. For them, the discrepancies are about $\\sim 10$ MeV. This may\nsuggest that the quantum numbers of the controversial states are\n$X(3823)=1^{+-}, X(3900)=1^{+-}, X(3940)=2^{++}$. In this work, we use the same\ninputs parameters, the constituent quark masses and the strength of the\ncolor-spin interaction, that have been adopted in the previous work on the $D$\nor $B$-meson excited states. There, it was shown that the four-quark structure\ncan be manifested in their excited states. Thus, our results in this work\nprovide a consistent treatment on open- and hidden-charm mesons as far as the\nfour-quark model is concerned.\n", "  Excitations of colliding nuclei during a nuclear reaction considerably affect\nfusion cross sections at energies around the Coulomb barrier. It has been\ndemonstrated that such channel coupling effects can be represented in terms of\na distribution of multiple fusion barriers. We here apply a Bayesian approach\nto analyze the so called fusion barrier distributions. This method determines\nsimultaneously the barrier parameters and the number of barriers. We\nparticularly investigate the $^{16}$O+$^{144}$Sm and $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm\nsystems in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The present\nanalysis indicates that the fusion barrier distribution for the former system\nis most consistent with three fusion barriers, even though the experimental\ndata show only two distinct peaks.\n", "  The enigmatic charged states $Z_c(3900)$, $Z_c(4020)$, $Z_c(4050)$,\n$Z_b(10610)$, and $Z_b(10650)$ are studied within a coupled-channel\nSchr\\\"odinger model, where radially excited quark-antiquark pairs, with the\nsame angular momenta and isospin as the $a_1(1260)$ and $b_1(1235)$, are\nstrongly coupled to their Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka - allowed decay channels\n$D\\bar{D}^*+\\bar{D}D^*$ and $D^*\\bar{D}^*$, or $B\\bar{B}^*+\\bar{B}B^*$ and\n$B^*\\bar{B}^*$, in $S$ and $D$-wave. Poles, matching the experimental mass and\nwidth of all the above states, are found by varying only two free parameters.\nFrom the wave-function analysis of each resonance, the probability of each of\nthe components contributing to the coupled system is estimated, and predictions\ncan be made for the relative decay fractions among the coupled open-charm or\nopen-bottom decay channels.\n", "  The Thermal Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation is combined with the\nSkyrme energy density functional method (Skyrme-TQRPA) to study the response of\na hot nucleus to an external perturbation. For the sample nuclei, $^{56}$Fe and\n$^{82}$Ge, the Skyrme-TQRPA is applied to analyze thermal effects on the\nstrength function of charge-neutral Gamow-Teller transitions which dominate\nneutrino-nucleus reactions at $E_\\nu \\lesssim 20$~MeV. For the relevant\nsupernova temperatures we calculate the cross sections for inelastic neutrino\nscattering. We also apply the method to examine the rate of\nneutrino-antineutrino pair emission by hot nuclei. The cross sections and rates\nare compared with those obtained earlier from the TQRPA calculations based on\nthe phenomenological Quasiparticle-Phonon Model Hamiltonian. For inelastic\nneutrino scattering on $^{56}$Fe we also compare the Skyrme-TQRPA results to\nthose obtained earlier from a hybrid approach that combines shell-model and RPA\ncalculations.\n", "  It is expected that the cosmological black holes are the closest realistic\nsolutions of gravitational theories and they evolve with time. Moreover, the\nnatural way of defining thermodynamic entities for the stationary ones is not\napplicable in the case of a time dependent spacetime. Here we confine our\ndiscussion within the Sultana-Dyer metric which is a cosmological black hole\nsolution of Einstein's gravity. In literature, there exists two expressions of\nhorizon temperature -- one is time dependent and the other does not depend on\ntime. To single out the correct one we find the temperature by studying the\nHawking effect in the tunnelling formalism. This leads to time dependent\nstructure. After identifying the correct one, the Einstein's equations are\nwritten on the horizon and we show that this leads to the first law of\nthermodynamics. In this process the expressions for horizon entropy and energy,\nobtained earlier by explicit calculations, are being used. This provides the\nevidence that Einstein's equations have thermodynamic structure even for a\ncosmological black hole spacetime. Moreover, this study further clarifies the\ncorrectness of the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities; like\ntemperature, entropy and internal energy.\n", "  In the previous work, we investigated the correlation-induced\nlocalization-delocalization transition (LDT) of the wavefunction at band center\n($E=0$) in the one-dimensional tight-binding model with fractal disorder\n[Yamada, EPJB (2015) 88, 264]. In the present work, we study the energy ($E\n\\neq 0$) dependence of the normalized localization length and the\ndelocalization of the wavefunction at the different energy in the same system.\nThe mobility edges in the LDT arise when the fractal dimension of the potential\nlandscape is larger than the critical value depending on the disorder strength,\nwhich is consistent with the previous result.In addition, we present the\ndistribution of individual NLL and Lyapunov exponent in the system with LDT.\n", "  High-energy neutrino (HEN) and gravitational wave (GW) can probe\nastrophysical sources in addition to electromagnetic observations.\nMultimessenger studies can reveal nature of the sources which may not be\ndiscerned from one type of signal alone. We discuss HEN emission in connection\nwith the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (ALIGO)\nevent GW150914 which could be associated with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB)\ndetected by the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 0.4 s after the GW event\nand within localization uncertainty of the GW event. We calculate HEN flux from\nthis short GRB, GW150914-GBM, and show that non-detection of a high-energy\nstarting event (HESE) by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory can constrain the\ntotal isotropic-equivalent jet energy of this short burst to be less than\n$3\\times 10^{52}$ erg.\n", "  Recent phenomenological analysis of experimental data on DIS processes\ninduced by charged leptons and neutrinos/antineutrinos beams on nuclear targets\nby CTEQ collaboration has confirmed the observation of CCFR and NuTeV\ncollaborations, that weak structure function $F_{2A}^{Weak} (x,Q^2)$ is\ndifferent from electromagnetic structure function $F_{2A}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$ in a\nnucleus like iron, specially in the region of low $x$ and $Q^2$. In view of\nthis observation we have made a study of nuclear medium effects on\n$F_{2A}^{Weak} (x,Q^2)$ and $F_{2A}^{EM} (x,Q^2)$ for a wide range of $x$ and\n$Q^2$ using a microscopic nuclear model. We have considered Fermi motion,\nbinding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic contributions from pion and rho\nmesons and shadowing effects to incorporate nuclear medium effects.\n  The calculations are performed in a local density approximation using a\nrelativistic nucleon spectral function which includes nucleon correlations. The\nnumerical results in the case of iron nucleus are compared with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  In this Letter we have derived the Jeans length in the context of the\nKaniadakis statistics. We have compared this result with the Jeans length\nobtained in the non-extensive Tsallis statistics and discussed the main\ndifferences between these two models. We have also obtained the kappa-sound\nvelocity. Finally, we have applied the results obtained here to analyze an\nastrophysical system.\n", "  We argue that the event horizon of a binary black hole merger, in the\nextreme-mass-ratio limit where one of the black holes is much smaller than the\nother, can be described in an exact analytic way. This is done by tracing in\nthe Schwarzschild geometry a congruence of null geodesics that approaches a\nnull plane at infinity. Its form can be given explicitly in terms of elliptic\nfunctions, and we use it to analyze and illustrate the time-evolution of the\nhorizon along the merger. We identify features such as the line of caustics at\nwhich light rays enter the horizon, and the critical point at which the\nhorizons touch. We also compute several quantities that characterize these\naspects of the merger.\n", "  We consider the NMSSM extended to include one vector-like family of quarks\nand leptons. If (some of) these vector-like matter particles, as the Higgs\ndoublets, have Yukawa couplings to the singlet S that exceed unity at about the\nsame scale $\\Lambda \\lesssim 10^3$ TeV, this gives the order 40 % enhancement\nof the tree level Higgs boson mass required in the MSSM to reach 125 GeV. It is\nconceivable that the Yukawa couplings to the singlet S, although naively\nblowing up close to $\\Lambda$, will not spoil gauge coupling unification. In\nsuch a case the unified coupling $\\alpha_X$ could be interestingly led to a\nvalue not far from unity, thus providing a possible explanation for the number\nof generations. The characteristic signal is an enhanced resonant production of\nneutral spin zero particles at LHC, that could even explain the putative\ndiphoton resonance hinted by the recent LHC data at 750 GeV.\n", "  Roughness parameters that characterize contacting surfaces with regard to\nfriction and wear are commonly stated without uncertainties, or with an\nuncertainty only taking into account a very limited amount of aspects such as\nrepeatability of reproducibility (homogeneity) of the specimen. This makes it\ndifficult to discriminate between different values of single roughness\nparameters.\n  Therefore uncertainty assessment methods are required that take all relevant\naspects into account. In the literature this is scarcely performed and examples\nspecific for parameters used in friction and wear are not yet given.\n  We propose a procedure to derive the uncertainty from a single profile\nemploying a statistical method that is based on the statistical moments of the\namplitude distribution and the autocorrelation length of the profile. To show\nthe possibilities and the limitations of this method we compare the uncertainty\nderived from a single profile with that derived from a high statistics\nexperiment.\n", "  We find that all measures of coherence are frozen for an initial state in a\nstrictly incoherent channel if and only if the relative entropy of coherence is\nfrozen for the state. Our finding reveals the existence of measure-independent\nfreezing of coherence, and provides an entropy-based dynamical condition in\nwhich the coherence of an open quantum system is totally unaffected by noise.\n", "  We present predictions for the inclusive production of bottom jets in\nproton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV and proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV.\nThe bottom quark is considered massless. In this scheme, we find that at small\ntransverse momentum (p_T) the ratio of the next-to-leading order to the\nleading-order cross section (K factor) is smaller than one. It increases with\nincreasing p_T and approaches one at larger p_T at a value depending\nessentially on the choice of the renormalization scale. Adding non-perturbative\ncorrections obtained from PYTHIA Monte Carlo calculations leads to reasonable\nagreement with experimental b-jet cross sections obtained by the CDF and the\nCMS collaborations.\n", "  We discuss the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the presence of hidden photons\nkinetically mixed with the ordinary electromagnetic photons. The hidden photon\nfield causes a slight phase shift in the observable interference pattern. It is\nthen shown how the limited sensitivity of this experiment can be largely\nimproved. The key observation is that the hidden photon field causes a leakage\nof the ordinary magnetic field into the supposedly field-free region. The\ndirect measurement of this magnetic field can provide a sensitive experiment\nwith a good discovery potential, particularly below the $\\sim$ meV mass range\nfor hidden photons.\n", "  We present a next-to-next-to-leading order accurate description of associated\nHW production consistently matched to a parton shower. The method is based on\nreweighting events obtained with the HW plus one jet NLO accurate calculation\nimplemented in POWHEG, extended with the MiNLO procedure, to reproduce NNLO\naccurate Born distributions. Since the Born kinematics is more complex than the\ncases treated before, we use a parametrization of the Collins-Soper angles to\nreduce the number of variables required for the reweighting. We present\nphenomenological results at 13 TeV, with cuts suggested by the Higgs Cross\nSection Working Group.\n", "  The two dimensional one component plasma 2dOCP is a classical system\nconsisting of $N$ identical particles with the same charge $q$ confined in a\ntwo dimensional surface with a neutralizing background. The Boltzmann factor at\ntemperature $T$ may be expressed as a Vandermonde determinant to the power\n$\\Gamma=q^2/(k_B T)$. Several statistical properties of the 2dOCP have been\nstudied by expanding the Boltzmann factor in the monomial basis for even values\nof $\\Gamma$. In this work, we use this formalism to compute the energy of the\n2dOCP on a sphere. Using the same approach the entropy is computed. The entropy\nas well as the free energy in the thermodynamic limit have a universal\nfinite-size correction term $\\frac{\\chi}{12}\\log N$, where $\\chi=2$ is the\nEuler characteristic of the sphere. A non-recursive formula for coefficients of\nmonomial functions expansion is used for exploring the energy as well as\nstructural properties for sufficiently large values of $\\Gamma$ to appreciate\nthe crystallization features for $N=2,3,\\ldots,9$ particles. Finally, we make a\nbrief comparison between the exact and numerical energies obtained with the\nMetropolis method for even values of $\\Gamma$.\n", "  Pulsars orbiting around the black hole at our galactic center provide us a\nunique testing site for gravity. In this work, we propose an approach to probe\nthe gravity around the black hole introducing two phenomenological parameters\nwhich characterize deviation from the vacuum Einstein theory. The two\nphenomenological parameters are associated with the energy momentum tensor in\nthe framework of the Einstein theory. Therefore, our approach can be regarded\nas the complement to the parametrized post-Newtonian framework in which\nphenomenological parameters are introduced for deviation of gravitational\ntheories from general relativity. In our formulation, we take the possibility\nof existence of a relativistic and exotic matter component into account. Since\nthe pulsars can be regarded as test particles, as the first step, we consider\ngeodesic motion in the system composed of a central black hole and a perfect\nfluid whose distribution is static and spherically symmetric. It is found that\nthe mass density of the fluid and a parameter of the equation of state can be\ndetermined with precision with $0.1\\%$ if the density on the pulsar orbit is\nlarger than $10^{-9}~{\\rm g/cm^3}$.\n", "  We show in this paper that the heat generated by the optical excitation of\nresonant plasmonic antennas and diffusing along a simple glass/air interface\ndisturbs the electron transport of a nearby conductive element. By probing the\ntemperature-dependent resistance of a gold nanowire $R_{\\rm nw}(T)$, we\nquantitatively analyze the impact of a resonant absorption of the laser by the\nantennas. We find that the temperature rise at the nanowire induced by the\nlaser absorption of a distant nanoparticle may exceed that of a direct\nillumination of the nanowire itself. We also find that a global temperature\ncalibration underestimates the heat generated locally by the laser. The\ntemperature deduced from resistance variations are verified by numerical\nsimulations with a very satisfactory agreement.\n", "  We perform density functional calculations to investigate the structure of\nthe inter-metallic alloy FeRh under epitaxial strain. Bulk FeRh exhibits a\nmetamagnetic transition from a low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase to\na ferromagnetic (FM) phase at 350K, and its strain dependence is of interest\nfor tuning the transition temperature to the room-temperature operating\nconditions of typical memory devices. We find an unusually strong dependence of\nthe structural energetics on the choice of exchange-correlation functional,\nwith the usual local density approximation (LDA) yielding the wrong\nground-state structure, and generalized gradient (GGA) extensions being in\nbetter agreement with the bulk experimental structure. Using the GGA we show\nthe existence of a metastable face-centered-cubic (fcc)-like AFM structure that\nis reached from the ground state body-centered-cubic (bcc) AFM structure by\nfollowing the epitaxial Bain path. We predict that this metastable fcc-like\nstructure has a significantly higher conductivity than the bcc AFM phase. We\nshow that the behavior is well described using non-linear elasticity theory,\nwhich captures the softening and eventual sign change of the orthorhombic shear\nmodulus under compressive strain, consistent with this structural instability.\nFinally, we predict the existence of an additional unit-cell-doubling lattice\ninstability, which should be observable at low temperature.\n", "  Given an accelerator-based neutrino experiment with the beam energy E\n\\lesssim 1 GeV, we expand the probabilities of \\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e and \\overline\n{\\nu}_\\mu \\to \\overline {\\nu}_e oscillations in matter in terms of two small\nquantities \\Delta_{21}/\\Delta_{31} and A/\\Delta_{31}, where \\Delta_{21} \\equiv\nm^2_2 - m^2_1 and \\Delta_{31} \\equiv m^2_3 - m^2_1 are the neutrino\nmass-squared differences, and A measures the strength of terrestrial matter\neffects. Our analytical approximations are numerically more accurate than those\nmade by Freund in this energy region, and thus they are particularly applicable\nfor the study of leptonic CP violation in the low-energy MOMENT, ESS\\nuSM and\nT2K oscillation experiments. As a by-product, the new analytical approximations\nhelp us to easily understand why the matter-corrected Jarlskog parameter\n\\widetilde{\\cal J} peaks at the resonance energy E_* \\simeq 0.14 GeV (or 0.12\nGeV) for the normal (or inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, and how the three\nDirac unitarity triangles are deformed due to the terrestrial matter\ncontamination. We also affirm that a medium-baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiment with the beam energy E lying in the E_* \\lesssim E \\lesssim 2 E_*\nrange is capable of exploring leptonic CP violation with little matter-induced\nsuppression.\n", "  A radial velocity (RV) survey for intermediate-mass giants has been operated\nfor over a decade at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO). The OAO survey\nhas revealed that some giants show long-term linear RV accelerations (RV\ntrends), indicating the presence of outer companions. Direct imaging\nobservations can help clarify what objects generate these RV trends. We present\nthe results of high-contrast imaging observations or six intermediate-mass\ngiants with long-term RV trends using the Subaru Telescope and HiCIAO camera.\nWe detected co-moving companions to $\\gamma$ Hya B ($0.61^{+0.12}_{-0.14}\nM_\\odot$), HD 5608 B ($0.10 \\pm 0.01 M_\\odot$), and HD 109272 B ($0.28 \\pm 0.06\nM_\\odot$). For the remaining targets($\\iota$ Dra, 18 Del, and HD 14067) we\nexclude companions more massive than 30-60 $M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ at projected\nseparations of 1arcsec-7arcsec. We examine whether these directly imaged\ncompanions or unidentified long-period companions can account for the RV trends\nobserved around the six giants. We find that the Kozai mechanism can explain\nthe high eccentricity of the inner planets $\\iota$ Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD\n14067 b.\n", "  It is well known that perturbative pressure calculations show poor\nconvergence. Calculations using a two particle irreducible (2PI) effective\naction show improved convergence at the 3 loop level, but no calculations have\nbeen done at 4 loops. We consider the 2PI effective theory for a symmetric\nscalar theory with quartic coupling in 4-dimensions. We calculate the pressure\nand two different non-perturbative vertices as functions of coupling and\ntemperature. Our results show that the 4 loop contribution can become larger\nthan the 3 loop term when the coupling is large. This indicates a breakdown of\nthe 2PI approach, and the need for higher order $n$PI approximations. In\naddition, our results demonstrate the renormalizability of 2PI calculations at\nthe 4 loop level. This is interesting because the counterterm structure of the\n2PI theory at 4 loops is different from the structure at $n\\le 3$ loops. Two\nvertex counterterms are required at the 4 loop level, but not at lower loop\norder. This unique feature of the 2PI theory has not previously been verified\nnumerically.\n", "  We show that the required high quality of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry can be\nnaturally explained in the aligned QCD axion models where the QCD axion arises\nfrom multiple axions with decay constants much smaller than the axion window,\ne.g., around the weak scale. Even in the presence of general Planck-suppressed\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry breaking operators, the effective strong CP phase remains\nsufficiently small in contrast to the standard axion models without the\nalignment. The QCD axion potential has small or large modulations due to the\nsymmetry breaking operators, which can significantly affect the axion\ncosmology. When the axions are trapped in different minima, domain walls appear\nand their scaling behavior suppresses the axion isocurvature perturbations at\nsuper-horizon scales. Our scenario predicts many axions and saxions coupled to\ngluons, and they may be searched for at collider experiments. In particular,\nthe recently found diphoton excess at 750 GeV could be due to one of such\n(s)axions.\n", "  The theory of phenomenological Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics is extended by\nincludimg stochastic processes in order to account for recently derived\nthermodynamical relations such as the Jarzynski equality. Four phenomenological\naxioms are postulated resulting in a phenomenological interpretation of\nJarzynski's equality. Especially, considering the class of Jarzynski processes\nJarzynski's equality follows from the axiom that the statistical average of the\nexponential work is protocol independent.\n", "  Using different types of embeddings of equations of motion we investigate the\nexistence of generalizations of the \"New Massive Gravity\" (NMG) model with the\nsame particle content (massive gravitons). By using the Weyl symmetry as a\nguiding principle for the embeddings we show that the Noether gauge embedding\napproach leads us to a sixth order model in derivatives with either a massive\nor a massless ghost. If the Weyl symmetry is implemented by means of a\nStueckelberg field we obtain a new scalar-tensor model for massive gravitons.\nIt is ghost free and Weyl invariant at linearized level. The model can be\nnonlinearly completed into a scalar field coupled to the NMG theory. The\nelimination of the scalar field leads to a nonlocal modification of the NMG.\n  We also prove to all orders in derivatives that there is no local, ghost free\nembedding of the linearized NMG equations of motion around Minkowski space when\nwritten in terms of one symmetric tensor. Regarding that point, NMG differs\nfrom the Fierz-Pauli theory, since in later case we can replace the\nEinstein-Hilbert action by specific $f(R,\\Box\\, R)$ generalizations and still\nkeep the theory ghost free at linearized level.\n", "  We present a first study of the field spectrum on a class of\nnegatively-curved compact spaces: nilmanifolds or twisted tori. This is a case\nwhere analytical results can be obtained, allowing to check numerical methods.\nWe focus on the Kaluza-Klein expansion of a scalar field. The results are then\napplied to a toy model where a natural Dark Matter candidate arises as a stable\nmassive state of the bulk scalar.\n", "  Many immersed boundary methods solve for surface stresses that impose the\nvelocity boundary conditions on an immersed body. These surface stresses may\ncontain spurious oscillations that make them ill-suited for representing the\nphysical surface stresses on the body. Moreover, these inaccurate stresses\noften lead to unphysical oscillations in the history of integrated surface\nforces such as the coefficient of lift. While the errors in the surface\nstresses and forces do not necessarily affect the convergence of the velocity\nfield, it is desirable, especially in fluid-structure interaction problems, to\nobtain smooth and convergent stress distributions on the surface. To this end,\nwe show that the equation for the surface stresses is an integral equation of\nthe first kind whose ill-posedness is the source of spurious oscillations in\nthe stresses. We also demonstrate that for sufficiently smooth delta functions,\nthe oscillations may be filtered out to obtain physically accurate surface\nstresses. The filtering is applied as a post-processing procedure, so that the\nconvergence of the velocity field is unaffected. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe method by computing stresses and forces that converge to the physical\nstresses and forces for several test problems.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the adiabatic projection method, a general framework\nfor scattering and reaction calculations on the lattice. We also introduce\nseveral new techniques developed to study nucleus-nucleus scattering and\nreactions on the lattice. We present technical details of the method for\nlarge-scale problems. To estimate the systematic errors of the calculations we\nconsider simple two-particle scattering on the lattice. Then we benchmark the\naccuracy and efficiency of the numerical methods by applying these to calculate\nfermion-dimer scattering in lattice effective field theory with and without a\nlong-range Coulomb potential. The fermion-dimer calculations correspond to\nneutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering in the spin-quartet channel at\nleading order in the pionless effective field theory.\n", "  We present and expand the simplest possible quantum cosmological bouncing\nmodel already discussed in previous works: the trajectory formulation of\nquantum mechanics applied to cosmology (through the Wheeler-De Witt equation)\nin the FLRW minisuper- space without spatial curvature. The initial conditions\nthat were previously assumed were such that the wave function would not change\nits functional form but instead provide a dynamics to its parameters. Here, we\nconsider a more general situation, in practice con- sisting of modified\nGaussian wave functions, aiming at obtaining a non singular bounce from a\ncontracting phase. Whereas previous works consistently obtain very symmetric\nbounces, we find that it is possible to produce highly non symmetric solutions,\nand even cases for which multiple bounces naturally occur. We also introduce a\nmeans of treating the shear in this category of models by quantizing in the\nBianchi I minisuperpace.\n", "  We study a holographic D3/probe-D5-brane model of a double monolayer Dirac\nsemimetal in a magnetic field and in the presence of a nonzero temperature.\nIntra- and inter-layer exciton condensates can form by varying the balanced\ncharge density on the layers, the spatial separation and the temperature.\nConstant temperature phase diagrams for a wide range of layer separations and\ncharge densities are found. The presence of a finite temperature makes the\nphase diagrams extremely rich and in particular leads to the appearance of a\nsymmetric phase which was missing at zero temperature.\n", "  We investigate the SU($N$) Hubbard model for the multi-component fermionic\noptical lattice system, combining dynamical mean-field theory with the\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. We obtain the finite temperature\nphase diagrams with $N\\le 6$ and find that low temperature properties depends\non the parity of the components. The magnetically ordered state competes with\nthe correlated metallic state in the system with the even number of components\n$(N\\ge 4)$, yielding the first-order phase transition. It is also clarified\nthat, in the odd-component system, the ordered state is realized at relatively\nlower temperatures and the critical temperature is constant in the strong\ncoupling limit.\n", "  Bekenstein proved that in Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to one (or\nmany) real, Abelian, Proca field, stationary black holes (BHs) cannot have\nProca hair. Dropping Bekenstein's assumption that matter inherits spacetime\nsymmetries, we show this model admits asymptotically flat, stationary,\naxi-symmetric, regular on and outside an event horizon BHs with Proca hair, for\nan even number of real (or an arbitrary number of complex) Proca fields. To\nestablish it, we start by showing that a test, complex Proca field can form\nbound states, with real frequency, around Kerr BHs: stationary Proca clouds.\nThese states exist at the threshold of superradiance. It was conjectured in\narXiv:1403.2757, that the existence of such clouds at the linear level implies\nthe existence of a new family of BH solutions at the non-linear level. We\nconfirm this expectation and explicitly construct examples of such Kerr black\nholes with Proca hair (KBHsPH). For a single complex Proca field, these BHs\nform a countable number of families with three continuous parameters (ADM mass,\nADM angular momentum and Noether charge). They branch off from the Kerr\nsolutions that can support stationary Proca clouds and reduce to Proca stars\nwhen the horizon size vanishes. We present the domain of existence of one\nfamily of KBHsPH, as well as its phase space in terms of ADM quantities. Some\nphysical properties of the solutions are discussed; in particular, and in\ncontrast with Kerr BHs with scalar hair, some spacetime regions can be\ncounter-rotating with respect to the horizon. We further establish a\nno-Proca-hair theorem for static, spherically symmetric BHs but allowing the\ncomplex Proca field to have a harmonic time dependence, which shows BHs with\nProca hair in this model require rotation and have no static limit. KBHsPH are\nalso disconnected from Kerr-Newman BHs with a real, massless vector field.\n", "  Optical properties of graphene are explored by using the generalized\ntight-binding model. The main features of spectral structures, the form,\nfrequency, number and intensity, are greatly enriched by the complex\nrelationship among the interlayer atomic interactions, the magnetic\nquantization and the Coulomb potential energy. Absorption spectra have the\nshoulders, asymmetric peaks and logarithmic peaks, coming from the band-edge\nstates of parabolic dispersions, the constant-energy loops and the saddle\npoints, respectively. The initial forbidden excitation region is only revealed\nin even-layer AA stacking systems. Optical gaps and special structures can be\ngenerated by an electric field. The delta-function-like structures in\nmagneto-optical spectra, which present the single, twin and double peaks, are\nassociated with the symmetric, asymmetric and splitting Landau-level energy\nspectra, respectively. The single peaks due to the non-tilted Dirac cones\nexhibit the nearly uniform intensity. The AAB stacking possesses more\nabsorption structures, compared to the other stackings. The diverse\nmagneto-optical selection rules are mainly determined by the well-behaved,\nperturbed and undefined Landau modes. The frequent anti-crossings in the\nmagnetic- and electric-field-dependent energy spectra lead to the increase of\nabsorption peaks and the reduced intensities. Part of theoretical calculations\nare consistent with the experimental measurements, and the others need further\ndetailed examinations.\n", "  Since the first suggestion of the Jarzynski equality many derivations of this\nequality have been presented in both, the classical and the quantum context.\nWhile the approaches and settings greatly differ from one to another, they all\nappear to rely on the initial state being a thermal Gibbs state. Here, we\npresent an investigation of work distributions in driven isolated quantum\nsystems, starting off from pure states that are close to energy eigenstates of\nthe initial Hamiltonian. We find that, for the nonintegrable system in quest,\nthe Jarzynski equality is fulfilled to good accuracy.\n", "  We use a top-down holographic model for strongly interacting quark matter to\nstudy the properties of neutron stars. When the corresponding Equation of State\n(EoS) is matched with state-of-the-art results for dense nuclear matter, we\nconsistently observe a first order phase transition at densities between two\nand seven times the nuclear saturation density. Solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations with the resulting hybrid EoSs, we find\nmaximal stellar masses in the excess of two solar masses, albeit somewhat\nsmaller than those obtained with simple extrapolations of the nuclear matter\nEoSs. Our calculation predicts that no quark matter exists inside neutron\nstars.\n", "  Magnetic field and momentum dissipation are key ingredients in describing\ncondensed matter systems. We include them in gauge/gravity and systematically\nexplore the bottom-up panorama of holographic IR effective field theories based\non bulk Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangians plus scalars. The class of solutions here\nexamined appear insufficient to capture the phenomenology of charge transport\nin the cuprates. We analyze in particular the temperature scaling of the\nresistivity and of the Hall angle. Keeping an open attitude, we illustrate weak\nand strong points of the approach.\n", "  We study the energy absorption in real time of a disordered quantum spin\nchain subjected to coherent monochromatic periodic driving. We determine\ncharacteristic fingerprints of the well-known ergodic (Floquet-ETH for slow\ndriving/weak disorder) and many-body localized (Floquet-MBL for fast\ndriving/strong disorder) phases. In addition, we identify an intermediate\nregime, where the energy density of the system -- unlike the entanglement\nentropy a local and bounded observable -- grows logarithmically slowly over a\nvery large time window.\n", "  We report on spin transport features which are unique to high quality bilayer\ngraphene, in absence of magnetic contaminants and strong intervalley mixing.\nThe time-dependent spin polarization of propagating wavepacket is computed\nusing an efficient quantum transport method. In the limit of vanishing effects\nof substrate and disorder, the energy-dependence of spin lifetime is similar to\nmonolayer graphene with a M-shape profile and minimum value at the charge\nneutrality point, but with an electron-hole asymmetry fingerprint. In sharp\ncontrast, the incorporation of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles\n(characteristics of supported graphene either on SiO2 orhBN) surprisingly\nresults in a large enhancement of the low-energy spin lifetime and a lowering\nof its high-energy values. Such feature, unique to bilayer, is explained in\nterms of a reinforced Dyakonov-Perel mechanism at the Dirac point, whereas spin\nrelaxation at higher energies is driven by pure dephasing effects. This\nsuggests further electrostatic control of the spin transport length scales in\ngraphene devices.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental and theoretical progresses of the magnetic\nproperties of iron-based superconductors, we provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic (BBQ) model on the square lattice. Using\nvariational approach in the mean-field level, we identify the existence of\nvarious magnetic phases, including conventional spin dipolar orderings (ferro-\nor antiferromagnet), novel quadrupolar (spin nematic) orderings and mixed\ndipolar-quadrupolar orderings. In contrast to the usual Heisenberg model, the\nelementary excitations of the spin-1 BBQ model are described by the flavor-wave\ntheory within the SU(3) representation. By fitting the experimental spin-wave\ndispersion, we determine the refined exchange couplings corresponding to the\ncollinear antiferromagnetic iron pnictides. We also present the dynamic\nstructure factors of both spin dipolar and quadrupolar components with\nconnections to the future experiments.\n", "  The Semi-Markov property of Continuous Time Random Walks (CTRWs) and their\nlimit processes is utilized, and the probability distributions of the bivariate\nMarkov process $(X(t),V(t))$ are calculated: $X(t)$ is a CTRW limit and $V(t)$\na process tracking the age, i.e. the time since the last jump. For a given CTRW\nlimit process $X(t)$, a sequence of discrete CTRWs in discrete time is given\nwhich converges to $X(t)$ (weakly in the Skorokhod topology). Master equations\nfor the discrete CTRWs are implemented numerically, thus approximating the\ndistribution of $X(t)$. A consequence of the derived algorithm is that any\ndistribution of initial age can be assumed as an initial condition for the CTRW\nlimit dynamics. Four examples with different temporal scaling are discussed:\nsubdiffusion, tempered subdiffusion, the fractal mobile/immobile model and the\ntempered fractal mobile/immobile model.\n", "  Energy levels and radiative rates (A-values) for transitions in Cr-like Cu~VI\nand Zn~VII are reported. These data are determined in the quasi-relativistic\napproach (QR), by employing a very large {\\em configuration interaction} (CI)\nexpansion which is highly important for these ions. No radiative rates are\navailable in the literature to compare with our results, but our calculated\nenergies are in close agreement with those compiled by NIST and other available\ntheoretical data, for a majority of the levels. The A-values (and resultant\nlifetimes) are listed for all significantly contributing E1, E2 and M1\nradiative transitions among the energetically lowest 322 levels of each ion.\n", "  New solution for two interpenetrating universes is found. Higher derivative\ngravity acting in 6-dimensional space is the basis of the study that allows to\nobtain stable solution without introducing matter of any sort. Stability of the\nsolution is maintained by a difference between asymptotic behavior at spacial\ninfinities. For an external observer such a funnel looks similar to a spherical\nwormhole.\n", "  Concentrating on zero temperature Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of\nelectronic systems, we give a general description of the theory of finite size\nextrapolations of energies to the thermodynamic limit based on one and two-body\ncorrelation functions. We introduce new effective procedures, such as using the\npotential and wavefunction split-up into long and short range functions to\nsimplify the method and we discuss how to treat backflow wavefunctions. Then we\nexplicitly test the accuracy of our method to correct finite size errors on\nexample hydrogen and helium many-body systems and show that the finite size\nbias can be drastically reduced for even small systems.\n", "  We explore Schwinger effect of spin 1/2 charged particles with static\nelectric field in 1+3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime. We analytically\ncalculate the vacuum expectation value of the spinor current which is induced\nby the produced particles in the electric field. The renormalization is\nperformed with the adiabatic subtraction scheme. We find that the current\nbecomes negative, namely it flows in the direction opposite to the electric\nfield, if the electric field is weaker than a certain threshold value depending\non the fermion mass, which is also known to happen in the case of scalar\ncharged particles in 1+3 de Sitter spacetime. Contrary to the scalar case,\nhowever, the IR hyperconductivity is absent in the spinor case.\n", "  A framework is proposed to describe resonant diphoton phenomenology at hadron\ncolliders in full generality. It can be employed for a comprehensive\nmodel-independent interpretation of the experimental data. Within the general\nframework, few benchmark scenarios are defined as representative of the various\nphenomenological options and/or of motivated new physics scenarios. Their usage\nis illustrated by performing a characterization of the 750 GeV excess, based on\na recast of available experimental results.\n  We also perform an assessment of which properties of the resonance could be\ninferred, after discovery, by a careful experimental study of the diphoton\ndistributions. These include the spin J of the new particle and its dominant\nproduction mode. Partial information on its CP-parity can also be obtained, but\nonly for $J\\geq2$. The complete determination of the resonance CP properties\nrequires studying the pattern of the initial state radiation that accompanies\nthe resonant diphoton production.\n", "  If the spacetime metric has anisotropic spatial curvature, one can afford to\nexpand the universe isotropically, provided that the energy-momentum tensor\nsatisfy a certain con- straint. This leads to the so-called shear-free metrics,\nwhich have the interesting property of violating the cosmological principle\nwhile still preserving the isotropy of the cosmic mi- crowave background (CMB)\nradiation. In this work we show that shear-free cosmologies correspond to an\nattractor solution in the space of models with anisotropic spatial curva- ture.\nThrough a rigorous definition of linear perturbation theory in these\nspacetimes, we show that shear-free models represent a viable alternative to\ndescribe the large-scale evo- lution of the universe, leading, in particular,\nto a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe effect. Alternatively, we discuss\nsome specific signatures that shear-free models would imprint on the\ntemperature spectrum of CMB.\n", "  We derive the four-dimensional low-energy effective field theory governing\nthe moduli space of strongly coupled superconformal quiver gauge theories\nassociated with D3-branes at Calabi-Yau conical singularities in the\nholographic regime of validity. We use the dual supergravity description\nprovided by warped resolved conical geometries with mobile D3-branes.\nInformation on the baryonic directions of the moduli space is also obtained by\nusing wrapped Euclidean D3-branes. We illustrate our general results by\ndiscussing in detail their application to the Klebanov-Witten model.\n", "  A geometry of superspace corresponding to double field theory is developed,\nwith type II supergravity in D=10 as the main example. The formalism is based\non an orthosymplectic extension OSp(d,d|2s) of the continuous T-duality group.\nCovariance under generalised super-diffeomorphisms is manifest. Ordinary\nsuperspace is obtained as a solution of the orthosymplectic section condition.\nA systematic study of curved superspace Bianchi identities is performed, and a\nrelation to a double pure spinor superfield cohomology is established. A\nRamond-Ramond superfield is constructed as an infinite-dimensional\northosymplectic spinor. Such objects in minimal orbits under the OSp supergroup\n(\"pure spinors\") define super-sections.\n", "  We report the dissemination of an ultrastable optical frequency signal to two\ndistant users simultaneously using a branching network. The ultrastable signal\nis extracted along a main fibre link; it is optically tracked with a\nnarrow-linewidth laser diode, which light is injected in a secondary link. The\npropagation noise of both links is actively compensated. We implement this\nscheme with two links of 50-km fibre spools, the extraction being setup at the\nmid-point of the main link. We show that the extracted signal at the end of the\nsecondary link exhibits fractional frequency instability of 1.4x10-15 at 1-s\nmeasurement time, almost equal to the 1.3x10-15 instability of the main link\noutput end. The long-term instabilities are also very similar, at a level of\n3-5x10-20 at 3x104-s integration time. We also show that the setting up of this\nextraction device, or a simpler one, at the main link input, can test the\nproper functioning of the noise rejection on this main link. This work is a\nsignificant step towards a robust and flexible ultra-stable network for\nmulti-users dissemination.\n", "  We implement a pseudolikelyhood approach with l2-regularization as well as\nthe recently introduced pseudolikelihood with decimation procedure to the\ninverse problem in continuous spin models on arbitrary networks, with\narbitrarily disordered couplings. Performances of the approaches are tested\nagainst data produced by Monte Carlo numerical simulations and compared also\nfrom previously studied fully-connected mean-field-based inference techniques.\nThe results clearly show that the best network reconstruction is obtained\nthrough the decimation scheme, that also allows to dwell the inference down to\nlower temperature regimes. Possible applications to phasor models for light\npropagation in random media are proposed and discussed.\n", "  We evaluate the fermion condensate and the expectation values of the charge\nand current densities for a massive fermionic field in (2+1)-dimensional\nconical spacetime with a magnetic flux located at the cone apex. The\nconsideration is done for both irreducible representations of the Clifford\nalgebra. The expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectation\nvalues and contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. All these\ncontributions are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal\nto the flux quantum. Related to the non-invariance of the model under the\nparity and time-reversal transformations, the fermion condensate and the charge\ndensity have indefinite parity with respect to the change of the signs of the\nmagnetic flux and chemical potential. The expectation value of the radial\ncurrent density vanishes. The azimuthal current density is the same for both\nthe irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra. It is an odd function\nof the magnetic flux and an even function of the chemical potential. The\nbehavior of the expectation values in various asymptotic regions of the\nparameters are discussed in detail. In particular, we show that for points near\nthe cone apex the vacuum parts dominate. For a massless field with zero\nchemical potential the fermion condensate and charge density vanish. Simple\nexpressions are derived for the part in the total charge induced by the planar\nangle deficit and magnetic flux. Combining the results for separate irreducible\nrepresentations, we also consider the fermion condensate, charge and current\ndensities in parity and time-reversal symmetric models. Possible applications\nto graphitic nanocones are discussed.\n", "  We present numerical studies of fermion and boson models with random\nall-to-all interactions (the SYK models). The high temperature expansion and\nexact diagonalization of the $N$-site fermion model are used to compute the\nentropy density: our results are consistent with the numerical solution of\n$N=\\infty$ saddle point equations, and the presence of a non-zero entropy\ndensity in the limit of vanishing temperature. The exact diagonalization\nresults for the fermion Green's function also appear to converge well to the\n$N=\\infty$ solution. For the hard-core boson model, the exact diagonalization\nstudy indicates spin glass order. Some results on the entanglement entropy and\nthe out-of-time-order correlators are also presented.\n", "  We investigated the gas properties of the galaxy group UGC03957 up to\n$1.4R_{200} \\approx 1.4$Mpc in four azimuthal directions with the Suzaku\nsatellit and performed a spectral analysis of five Suzaku observations of\nUGC03957 with 138ks good exposure time in total and five Chandra snapshot\nobservations for point source detection. We found a temperature drop of a\nfactor of ${\\sim} 3$ from the center to the outskirts that is consistent with\nprevious results for galaxy clusters. The metal abundance profile shows a flat\nbehavior towards large radii, which is a hint for galactic winds as the primary\nICM enrichment process. The entropy profile is consistent with numerical\nsimulations after applying a gas mass fraction correction. Previous analyses\nfor clusters and groups often showed an entropy flattening or even a drop\naround ${\\sim} R_{200}$, which can be an indication of clumping or\nnon-equilibrium states in the outskirts. Such entropy behavior is absent in\nUGC03957. The gas mass fraction is well below the cosmic mean but rises above\nthis value beyond $R_{200}$, which could be a hint for deviations from\nhydrostatic equilibrium at these large radii. We determined the relative number\nof different supernovae types and found that the abundance pattern can be\ndescribed by a relative contribution of 80% - 100% of core-collapse supernovae.\nThis result is in agreement with previous measurements for galaxy groups.\n", "  We present the first demonstration of two-photon double ionization of neon\nusing an intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulse train (APT) in a\nphoton energy regime where both direct and sequential mechanisms are allowed.\nFor an APT generated through high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in argon we\nachieve a total pulse energy close to 1 $\\mu$J, a central energy of 35 eV and a\ntotal bandwidth of $\\sim30$ eV. The APT is focused by broadband optics in a\nneon gas target to an intensity of $3\\cdot10^{12} $W$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}$. By tuning\nthe photon energy across the threshold for the sequential process the double\nionization signal can be turned on and off, indicating that the two-photon\ndouble ionization predominantly occurs through a sequential process. The\ndemonstrated performance opens up possibilities for future XUV-XUV pump-probe\nexperiments with attosecond temporal resolution in a photon energy range where\nit is possible to unravel the dynamics behind direct vs. sequential double\nionization and the associated electron correlation effects.\n", "  We study wave propagation in interacting Bose liquid, where the short range\npart of the interaction between atoms is of a hard core type, and its long\nrange part scales with a distance as a power law. The cases of Coulomb,\ndipole-dipole and Van der Waals interaction are considered. We employ a\nhydrodynamic approach, based on the exact solution of Lieb-Liniger model, and\nstudy the evolution of a density pulse instantly released from a potential\ntrap. We analyze semi-classical Euler and continuity equations and construct\nthe corresponding Riemann invariants. We supplement our analysis with numerical\ncalculations and discuss experimental applications for ultacold atom\nexperiments.\n", "  The nature of the bottomonium-like states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ is\nstudied by calculating the $B^{(*)}\\overline B^{*}$ compositeness ($X$) in\nthose resonances. We first consider uncoupled isovector $S$-wave scattering of\n$B^{(*)}\\overline B^{*}$ within the framework of effective-range expansion\n(ERE). Expressions for the scattering length ($a$) and effective range ($r$)\nare derived exclusively in terms of the masses and widths of the two $Z_b$\nstates. We then develop compositeness within ERE for the resonance case and\ndeduce the expression $X=1/\\sqrt{2r/a-1}$, which is then applied to the systems\nof interest. Finally, the actual compositeness parameters are calculated in\nterms of resonance pole positions and their experimental branching ratios into\n$B^{(*)}\\overline{B}^*$ by using the method of Ref.[1]. We find the values\n$X=0.66\\pm 0.11$ and $0.51\\pm 0.10$ for the $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$,\nrespectively. We also compare the ERE with Breit-Wigner and Flatt\\'e\nparameterizations to discuss the applicability of the last two ones for\nnear-threshold resonances with explicit examples.\n", "  We revisit the sgoldstino interpretation of the diphoton excess in the\ncontext of gauge mediation. While the bound on the gluino mass might seem to\nmake the sgoldstino contribution to the diphoton excess unobservable, we show\nthat the interpretation is viable in a thin, near critical region of the\nparameter space. This regime gives rise to drastic departures from the standard\ngauge mediation picture. While the fermion messengers lie in the (10-100) TeV\nrange, some scalar messengers are significantly lighter and are responsible for\nthe sgoldstino production and decay. Their effective coupling to the sgoldstino\nis correspondingly enhanced, and a non-perturbative regime is triggered when\nlight and heavy messenger masses differ by a factor $\\sim4\\pi$. We also comment\non the possible role of an R-axion and on the possibility to decouple the\nsfermions in this context.\n", "  The scotogenic scenario provides an attractive approach to both Dark Matter\nand neutrino mass generation, in which the same symmetry that stabilises Dark\nMatter also ensures the radiative seesaw origin of neutrino mass. However the\nsimplest scenario may suffer from inconsistencies arising from the spontaneous\nbreaking of the underlying $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Here we show that the\nsinglet-triplet extension of the simplest model naturally avoids this problem\ndue to the presence of scalar triplets neutral under the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ which\naffect the evolution of the couplings in the scalar sector. The scenario offers\ngood prospects for direct WIMP Dark Matter detection through the nuclear recoil\nmethod.\n", "  We present measurements of the spatial clustering statistics in redshift\nspace of various scalar field modified gravity simulations. We utilise the\ntwo-point and the three-point correlation functions to quantify the spatial\ndistribution of dark matter halos within these simulations and thus discern\nbetween the models. We compare $\\Lambda$CDM simulations to various modified\ngravity scenarios and find consistency with previous work in terms of 2-point\nstatistics in real and redshift-space. However using higher order statistics\nsuch as the three-point correlation function in redshift space we find\nsignificant deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM hinting that higher order statistics\nmay prove to be a useful tool in the hunt for deviations from General\nRelativity.\n", "  For a network formed by nodes and undirected links between pairs of nodes,\nthe network optimal attack problem aims at deleting a minimum number of target\nnodes to break the network down into many small components. This problem is\nintrinsically related to the feedback vertex set problem that was successfully\ntackled by spin glass theory and an associated belief propagation-guided\ndecimation (BPD) algorithm [H.-J. Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86 (2013) 455]. In the\npresent work we apply the BPD alrogithm (which has approximately linear time\ncomplexity) to the network optimal attack problem, and demonstrate that it has\nmuch better performance than a recently proposed Collective Information\nalgorithm [F. Morone and H. A. Makse, Nature 524 (2015) 63--68] for different\ntypes of random networks and real-world network instances. The BPD-guided\nattack scheme often induces an abrupt collapse of the whole network, which may\nmake it very difficult to defend.\n", "  The Fick--Jacobs equation has been widely studied, because of its\napplications in the diffusion and transport of non-interacting particles in\nnarrow channels. It is also known that a modified version of this equation can\nbe used to describe the same system with particles interacting through a\nhard-core potential. In this work we present a system that can be exactly\nsolved using the Fick--Jacobs equation. The exact results of the particle\nconcentration profile along the channel $n$, the current, $J$, and the\nmobility, $\\mu$, of particles as a function of an external force are contrasted\nwith Monte Carlo simulations results of non-interacting particles. For\ninteracting particles the behavior of $n$, $J$ and $\\mu$, obtained from the\nmodified Fick--Jacobs equation are in agreement with numerical simulations,\nwhere the hard-core interaction is taken into account. Even more, for\ninteracting particles the modified Fick--Jacobs equation gives comparatively\nmore accurate results of the current difference (when a force is applied in\nopposite directions) than the exact result for the non-interacting ones.\n", "  A linear polarization field on the sphere can be uniquely decomposed into an\nE-mode and a B-mode component. These two components are analytically defined in\nterms of spin-2 spherical harmonics. Maps that contain filtered modes on a\npartial sky can also be decomposed into E-mode and B-mode components. However,\nthe lack of full sky information prevents orthogonally separating these\ncomponents using spherical harmonics. In this paper, we present a technique for\ndecomposing an incomplete map into E and B-mode components using E and B\neigenmodes of the pixel covariance in the observed map. This method is found to\northogonally define E and B in the presence of both partial sky coverage and\nspatial filtering. This method has been applied to the BICEP2 and the Keck\nArray maps and results in reducing E to B leakage from LCDM E-modes to a level\ncorresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r<1\\times10^{-4}$.\n", "  We present the results of a precise near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV)\nsurvey of 32 low-mass stars with spectral types K2-M4 using CSHELL at the NASA\nIRTF in the $K$-band with an isotopologue methane gas cell to achieve\nwavelength calibration and a novel iterative RV extraction method. We surveyed\n14 members of young ($\\approx$ 25-150 Myr) moving groups, the young field star\n$\\varepsilon$ Eridani as well as 18 nearby ($<$ 25 pc) low-mass stars and\nachieved typical single-measurement precisions of 8-15 m s$^{-1}$ with a\nlong-term stability of 15-50 m s$^{-1}$. We obtain the best NIR RV constraints\nto date on 27 targets in our sample, 19 of which were never followed by\nhigh-precision RV surveys. Our results indicate that very active stars can\ndisplay long-term RV variations as low as $\\sim$ 25-50 m s$^{-1}$ at $\\approx$\n2.3125 $\\mu$m, thus constraining the effect of jitter at these wavelengths. We\nprovide the first multi-wavelength confirmation of GJ 876 bc and independently\nretrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV\nvariability for HD 160934 AB and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known\nbinary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV variables with a\nstatistical significance of 3-5$\\sigma$. Our method combined with the new\niSHELL spectrograph will yield long-term RV precisions of $\\lesssim$ 5 m\ns$^{-1}$ in the NIR, which will allow the detection of Super-Earths near the\nhabitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.\n", "  A major limitations for many heat engines is that their functioning demands\non-line control, and/or an external fitting between environmental parameters\n(e.g. temperatures of thermal baths) and internal parameters of the engine. We\nstudy a model for an adaptive heat engine, where---due to feedback from the\nfunctional part---the engine's structure adapts to given thermal baths. Hence\nno on-line control and no external fitting are needed. The engine can employ\nunknown resources, it can also adapt to results of its own functioning that\nmakes the bath temperatures closer. We determine thermodynamic costs of\nadaptation and relate them to the prior information available about the\nenvironment. We also discuss informational constraints on the\nstructure-function interaction that are necessary for adaptation.\n", "  We introduce a non-linear extension of Proca's field theory for massive\nvector (spin $1$) bosons. The associated relativistic nonlinear wave equation\nis related to recently advanced nonlinear extensions of the Schroedinger,\nDirac, and Klein-Gordon equations inspired on the non-extensive generalized\nthermostatistics. This is a theoretical framework that has been applied in\nrecent years to several problems in nuclear and particle physics, gravitational\nphysics, and quantum field theory. The nonlinear Proca equation investigated\nhere has a power-law nonlinearity characterized by a real parameter $q$\n(formally corresponding to the Tsallis entropic parameter) in such a way that\nthe standard linear Proca wave equation is recovered in the limit $q\n\\rightarrow 1$. We derive the nonlinear Proca equation from a Lagrangian that,\nbesides the usual vectorial field $\\Psi^{\\mu}(\\vec{x},t)$, involves an\nadditional field $\\Phi^{\\mu}(\\vec{x},t)$. We obtain exact time dependent\nsoliton-like solutions for these fields having the form of a $q$-plane wave,\nand show that both field equations lead to the relativistic energy-momentum\nrelation $E^{2} = p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$ for all values of $q$. This suggests\nthat the present nonlinear theory constitutes a new field theoretical\nrepresentation of particle dynamics. In the limit of massless particles the\npresent $q$-generalized Proca theory reduces to Maxwell electromagnetism, and\nthe $q$-plane waves yield localized, transverse solutions of Maxwell equations.\nPhysical consequences and possible applications are discussed.\n", "  The covariant and gauge invariant calculation of the current expectation\nvalue in the homogeneous electric field in 1+3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime\nis shown. The result accords with previous work obtained by using adiabatic\nsubtraction scheme. We therefore conclude the counterintuitive behaviors of the\ncurrent in the infrared (IR) regime such as IR hyperconductivity and negative\ncurrent are not artifacts of the renormalization scheme, but are real IR\neffects of the spacetime.\n", "  The concept of metasurface has recently opened new exciting directions to\nengineer the refraction properties in both optical and acoustic media.\nMetasurfaces are typically designed by assembling arrays of sub-wavelength\nanisotropic scatterers able to mold incoming wavefronts in rather\nunconventional ways. The concept of metasurface was pioneered in photonics and\nlater extended to acoustics while its application to the propagation of elastic\nwaves in solids is relatively unexplored. We investigate the design of acoustic\nmetasurfaces to control elastic guided waves in thin-walled structural\nelements. These engineered discontinuities enable anomalous refraction of\nguided wave modes consistently with the generalized Snell's law. The\nmetasurfaces are made out of locally-resonant torus-like tapers enabling\naccurate phase shift of the incoming wave which ultimately affects the\nrefraction properties. We show that anomalous refraction can be achieved on\ntransmitted antisymmetric modes ($A_0$) either when using a symmetric ($S_0$)\nor antisymmetric ($A_0$) incident wave, the former clearly involving mode\nconversion. The same metasurface design also allows achieving structure\nembedded planar focal lenses and phase masks for non-paraxial propagation.\n", "  The hyperfine splitting of the ground and low-energy $3/2^+(7.8 \\pm 0.5$ eV)\nlevels in the $^{229}$Th nucleus in muonic atom\n($\\mu^-_{1S_{1/2}}{}^{229}$Th$)^*$ has been calculated considering the\ndistribution of the nuclear magnetization in the framework of collective\nnuclear model with the wave functions of the Nilsson model for the unpaired\nneutron. It is shown that (a) the hyperfine splitting of the $3/2^+$ isomeric\nstate is anomalously weak, and the reduction of hyperfine structure in\ncomparison with the model of a point nuclear magnetic dipole is close to 100\\%,\n(b) partial inversion of levels of the $^{229}$Th ground-state doublet and\nspontaneous decay of the ground state with excitation of the isomeric state\ntake place, (c) the energy of the isomeric transition lies in the range of\n120--140 eV, which makes possible the direct observation of the transition,\nregistration of conversion electrons and measurement of the nuclear matrix\nelement.\n", "  On 2011 June 7 debris from a large filament eruption fell back to the Sun\ncausing bright ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) splashes across\nthe surface. These impacts may give clues on the process of stellar accretion.\nThe aim is to investigate how the impact emission is influenced by structures\nin the falling ejecta and at the solar surface. We determine the UV and EUV\nlight curves of a sample of impacts. The ballistic impact velocity is estimated\nfrom the ejection and landing times and, where possible, compared with the\nvelocity derived by tracking the downflows in SDO/AIA and STEREO/EUVI images.\nEstimates of the column density before impact are made from the darkness of the\nfalling plasma in the 193 A channel. The impact velocities were between 230 and\n450 km/s. All impacts produced bright EUV emission at the impact site but\nbright UV was only observed when the impacting fragments reached the\nchromosphere. There was no clear relation between EUV intensity and kinetic\nenergy. Low UV to EUV intensity ratios (I{UV}/I{EUV}) were seen (i) from\nimpacts of low column-density fragments, (ii) when splashes, produced by some\nimpacts, prevented subsequent fragments from reaching the chromosphere, and\n(iii) from an impact in an active region. The earliest impacts with the lowest\nvelocity (~250 km/s) had the highest I{UV}/I{EUV}. The I{UV}/I{EUV} decreases\nwith impact velocity, magnetic field at the impact site, and EUV ionising flux.\nMany of the infalling fragments dissipate above the chromosphere either due to\nionisation and trapping in magnetic structures, or to them encountering a\nsplash from an earlier impact. If the same happens in accreting stars then the\nreduced X-ray compared to optical emission that has been observed is more\nlikely due to absorption by the trailing stream than locally at the impact\nsite.\n", "  Feasibility studies of an observation of the exclusive diffractive\nbremsstrahlung in proton-proton scattering at the LHC are reported. A\nsimplified approach to the photon and the scattered proton energy\nreconstruction is used. The background influence is discussed.\n", "  We study the rapidity evolution of gluon transverse momentum dependent\ndistributions appearing in processes of particle production and show how this\nevolution changes from small to moderate Bjorken x.\n", "  Pulsar timing arrays are now setting increasingly tight limits on the\ngravitational wave background from binary supermassive black holes. But as\nupper limits grow more constraining, what can be implied about galaxy\nevolution? We investigate which astrophysical parameters have the largest\nimpact on strain spectrum predictions and provide a simple framework to\ndirectly translate between measured values for the parameters of galaxy\nevolution and PTA limits on the gravitational wave background of binary\nsupermassive black holes. We find that the most influential observable is the\nrelation between a host galaxy's central bulge and its central black hole,\n$\\mbox{$M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\rm bulge}$}$, which has the largest effect on the\nmean value of the characteristic strain amplitude. However, the variance of\neach prediction is dominated by uncertainties in the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction. Using this framework with the best published PTA limit, we can set\nlimits on the shape and scatter of the $\\mbox{$M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\rm bulge}$}$\nrelation. We find our limits to be in contention with strain predictions using\ntwo leading measurements of this relation. We investigate several possible\nreasons for this disagreement. If we take the $\\mbox{$M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\rm\nbulge}$}$ relations to be correct within a simple power-law model for the\ngravitational wave background, then the inconsistency is reconcilable by\nallowing for an additional \"stalling\" time between a galaxy merger and\nevolution of a binary supermassive black hole to sub-parsec scales, with lower\nlimits on this timescale of $\\sim 1-2$ Gyr.\n", "  Recent progress on nonlinear properties of parity-time ($\\cal PT$-) symmetric\nsystems is comprehensively reviewed in this article. $\\cal PT$ symmetry started\nout in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where complex potentials obeying $\\cal\nPT$ symmetry could exhibit all-real spectra. This concept later spread out to\noptics, Bose-Einstein condensates, electronic circuits, and many other physical\nfields, where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric system. The natural inclusion of nonlinearity into these $\\cal\nPT$ systems then gave rise to a wide array of new phenomena which have no\ncounterparts in traditional dissipative systems. Examples include the existence\nof continuous families of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion,\nstabilization of nonlinear modes above $\\cal PT$-symmetry phase transition,\nsymmetry breaking of nonlinear modes, distinctive soliton dynamics, and many\nothers. In this article, nonlinear $\\cal PT$-symmetric systems arising from\nvarious physical disciplines are presented; nonlinear properties of these\nsystems are thoroughly elucidated; and relevant experimental results are\ndescribed. In addition, emerging applications of $\\cal PT$ symmetry are pointed\nout.\n", "  The paper treats oscillations of a liquid in partially filled vessel under\nhorizontal harmonic ground excitation. Such excitation may lead to hydraulic\nimpacts. The liquid sloshing mass is modeled by equivalent pendulum, which can\nimpact the vessel walls. We use parameters of the equivalent pendulum for\nwell-explored case of cylindrical vessels. The hydraulic impacts are modeled by\nhigh-power potential function. Conditions for internal resonances are\npresented. A non-resonant behavior and dynamic response related to 3:1 internal\nresonance are explored. When the excitation amplitude exceeds a critical value,\nthe system exhibits multiple steady state solutions. Quasi-periodic solutions\nappear in relatively narrow range of parameters. Numerical continuation links\nbetween resonant regimes found asymptotically for small excitation amplitude,\nand high-amplitude responses with intensive impacts.\n", "  We study jets with identified hadrons in which a family of jet-shape\nvariables called angularities are measured, extending the concept of\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs) to these observables. FJFs determine the\nfraction of energy, z, carried by an identified hadron in a jet with\nangularity, \\tau_a. The FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation functions (FFs),\nevolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable matching\ncoefficients. Renormalization group equations are used to provide resummed\ncalculations with next-to-leading logarithm prime (NLL') accuracy. We apply\nthis formalism to two-jet events in e^+ e^- collisions with B mesons in the\njets, and three-jet events in which a J/\\psi is produced in the gluon jet. In\nthe case of B mesons, we use a phenomenological FF extracted from e^+ e^-\ncollisions at the Z^0 pole evaluated at the scale \\mu = m_b. For events with\nJ/\\psi, the FF can be evaluated in terms of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) matrix\nelements at the scale \\mu =2 m_c. The z and \\tau_a distributions from our NLL'\ncalculations are compared with predictions from monte carlo event generators.\nWhile we find consistency between the predictions for B mesons and the J/\\psi\ndistributions in \\tau_a, we find the z distributions for J/\\psi differ\nsignificantly. We describe an attempt to merge PYTHIA showers with NRQCD FFs\nthat gives good agreement with NLL' calculations of the z distributions.\n", "  A model of a Free Electron Laser operating with an elliptically polarised\nundulator is presented. The equations describing the FEL interaction, including\nresonant harmonic radiation fields, are averaged over an undulator period and\ngenerate a generalised Bessel function scaling factor, similar to that of\nplanar undulator FEL theory. Comparison between simulations of the averaged\nmodel with those of an unaveraged model show very good agreement in the linear\nregime. Two unexpected results were found. Firstly, an increased coupling to\nharmonics for elliptical rather than planar polarisarised undulators. Secondly,\nand thought to be unrelated to the undulator polarisation, a signficantly\ndifferent evolution between the averaged and unaveraged simulations of the\nharmonic radiation evolution approaching FEL saturation.\n", "  For a wide range of supersymmetric models, there is a chiral superfield whose\nscalar and pseudo-scalar have approximately degenerate masses and couplings to\nStandard Model particles. At colliders, they may show up as \"superbumps\": a\npair of resonances with similar masses and production cross-sections. Observing\nthe superbumps may provide evidence of supersymmetry even without seeing\nsuperpartners with a different spin. We present two models which realize the\nsuperbump scenario. The first one contains an elementary superfield, 24, under\nSU(5)_GUT, while the second one is based on the supersymmetric QCD model with\nN_f = N_c +1 and identifying SU(N_f=5) as SU(5)_GUT. Both models have rich\nphenomenology including nearly mass-degenerate scalar and pseudo-scalar color\noctets that appear as three body resonances of two photons and one gluon. We\nalso show that the recent 750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC could be the first\nhint of a superbump signature.\n", "  We study the evolution of the small $x$ gluon transverse momentum\ndependent(TMD) distribution in the dilute limit. The calculation has been\ncarried out in the Ji-Ma-Yuan scheme using a simple quark target model. As\nexpected, we find that the resulting small $x$ gluon TMD simultaneously\nsatisfies both the Collins-Soper(CS) evolution equation and the\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov(BFKL) evolution equation. We thus confirmed the\nearlier finding that the high energy factorization(HEF) and the TMD\nfactorization should be jointly employed to resum the different type large\nlogarithms in a process where three relevant scales are well separated.\n", "  We discuss the isoscalar $T=0, S=1$ pairing correlation in the low-lying\nstates of $^{102}{\\rm Sb}={}^{100}{\\rm Sn}+p+n$ nucleus. To this end, we employ\n${\\rm core}+p+n$ three-body model with the model space constructed by\nself-consistent mean-field calculations. The model is developed with both\nnon-relativistic and relativistic effective interactions, the latter of which\nare found to be more realistic for the present case due to the pseudo-spin\nsymmetry. It turns out that the $(L,S,T)=(0,1,0)$ pairing scheme is strongly\nhindered in $^{102}$Sb with the relativistic model because of the near\ndegeneracy of the $g_{7/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$ orbitals in the valence space. This\npair-breaking effect is clearly seen in the charge-exchange Gamow-Teller-type\ntransitions rather than in the binding energies of $T=0$ and $T=1$ states.\n", "  We employ the Gutzwiller variational approach to investigate the interplay of\nCoulomb interaction and spin-orbit coupling in a three-orbital Hubbard model.\nAlready in the paramagnetic phase we find a substantial renormalization of the\nspin-orbit coupling that enters the effective single-particle Hamiltonian for\nthe quasi-particles. Only close to half band-filling and for sizable Coulomb\ninteraction we observe clear signatures of Hund's atomic rules for spin,\norbital, and total angular momentum. For a finite local Hund's-rule exchange\ninteraction we find a ferromagnetically ordered state. The spin-orbit coupling\nconsiderably reduces the size of the ordered moment, it generates a small\nordered orbital moment, and it induces a magnetic anisotropy. To investigate\nthe magnetic anisotropy energy, we use an external magnetic field that tilts\nthe magnetic moment away from the easy axis $(1,1,1)$.\n", "  An electron beam traversing a structured plasmonic field is shown to undergo\ndiffraction with characteristic angular patterns of both elastic and inelastic\noutgoing electron components. In particular, a plasmonic {\\it grating} (e.g., a\nstanding wave formed by two counter-propagating plasmons in a thin film)\nproduces diffraction orders of the same parity as the net number of exchanged\nplasmons. Large diffracted beam fractions are predicted to occur for realistic\nplasmon intensities in attainable geometries due to a combination of phase and\namplitude changes locally imprinted on the passing electron wave. Our study\nopens new vistas in the study of multiphoton exchanges between electron beams\nand evanescent optical fields with unexplored effects related to the\ntransversal component of the electron wave function.\n", "  Vector leptoquarks provide an elegant solution to a series of anomalies and\nat the same time generate naturally light neutrino masses through their mixing\nwith the standard model Higgs boson. We present a simple Froggatt-Nielsen model\nto accommodate the B physics anomalies $R_K$ and $R_D$, neutrino masses, and\nthe $750$ GeV diphoton excess in one cohesive framework adding only two vector\nleptoquarks and two singlet scalar fields to the standard model field content.\n", "  It is possible to formulate light-cone gauge string field theory in\nnoncritical dimensions. Such a theory corresponds to conformal gauge worldsheet\ntheory with nonstandard longitudinal part. We study the longitudinal part of\nthe worldsheet theory on higher genus Riemann surfaces. The results in this\npaper shall be used to study the dimensional regularization of light-cone gauge\nstring field theory.\n", "  Treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure, we\ninvestigate the critical behavior of a Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole system. The\ncritical points for the van der Waals like phase transition are numerically\nsolved. The highly accurate fitting formula for them is given and is found to\nbe dependent of the charge $Q$ and angular momentum $J$. In the reduced\nparameter space, we find that the temperature, Gibbs free energy, and\ncoexistence curve depend only on the dimensionless angular momentum-charge\nratio $\\epsilon=J/Q^2$ rather than $Q$ and $J$. Moreover, when varying\n$\\epsilon$ from 0 to $\\infty$, the coexistence curve will continuously change\nfrom that of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-AdS black hole to the Kerr-AdS black\nhole. These results may guide us to study the critical phenomena for other\nthermodynamic systems with two characteristic parameters.\n", "  We consider a time dependent trap externally manipulated in such a way that\none of its bound states is brought into an instant contact with the continuum\nthreshold, and then down again. It is shown that, in the limit of slow\nevolution, the probability to remain in the bound state, $P^{stay}$ tends to a\nuniversal limit, and is determined only by the manner in which the adiabatic\nbound state approaches and leaves the threshold. The task of evaluating the\n$P^{stay}$ in the adiabatic limit can be reduced to studying the loss from a\nzero range well, and is performed numerically. Various types of trapping\npotentials are considered. Applications of the theory to cold atoms in traps,\nand to propagation of traversal modes in tapered wave guides are proposed.\n", "  Resonant X-ray scattering experiments on high-temperature superconductors and\nrelated cuprates have revealed the presence of intense paramagnon scattering at\nhigh excitation energies, of the order of several hundred meV. The excitation\nenergies appear to show very similar behavior across all compounds, ranging\nfrom magnetically ordered, via superconductors, to heavy fermion systems.\nHowever, we argue that this apparent behavior has been inferred from the data\nthrough model fitting which implicitly imposes such similarities. Using model\nfitting that is free from such restrictions, we show that the paramagnons are\nnot nearly as well-defined as has been asserted previously, and that some\nparamagnons might not represent propagating excitations at all. Our work\nindicates that the data published previously in the literature will need to be\nre-analyzed with proper models.\n", "  We revisit the possibility of de Sitter vacua and slow-roll inflation in type\nII string theory at the level of the classical two-derivative supergravity\napproximation. Previous attempts at explicit constructions were plagued by\nubiquitous tachyons with a large $\\eta$ parameter whose origin has not been\nfully understood so far. In this paper, we determine and explain the tachyons\nin two setups that are known to admit unstable dS critical points: an SU(3)\nstructure compactification of massive type IIA with O6-planes and an SU(2)\nstructure compactification of type IIB with O5/O7-planes. We explicitly show\nthat the tachyons are always close to, but never fully aligned with the\nsgoldstino direction in the considered examples and argue that this behavior is\nexplained by a generalized version of a no-go theorem by Covi et al, which\nholds in the presence of large mixing in the mass matrix between the sgoldstino\nand the orthogonal moduli. This observation may also provide a useful stability\ncriterion for general dS vacua in supergravity and string theory.\n", "  We calculate the quantum state of the plasmon field excited by an ensemble of\nmolecular emitters, which are driven by exchange of electrons with metallic\nnano-particle electrodes. Assuming identical emitters that are coupled\ncollectively to the plasmon mode but are otherwise subject to independent\nrelaxation channels, we show that symmetry constraints on the total system\ndensity matrix imply a drastic reduction in the numerical complexity. For\n$N_{\\text{m}}$ three-level molecules we may thus represent the density matrix\nby a number of terms scaling as $(N_{\\rm m}+8)!/(8!N_{\\rm m}!)$ instead of\n$9^{N_{\\text{m}}}$, and this allows exact simulations of up to\n$N_{\\text{m}}=10$ molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that many emitters\ncompensate strong plasmon damping and lead to the population of high plasmon\nnumber states and a narrowed linewidth of the plasmon field. For large\n$N_{\\text{m}}$, our exact results are reproduced by an approximate approach\nbased on the plasmon reduced density matrix. With this approach, we have\nextended the simulations to more than $50$ molecules and shown that the plasmon\nnumber state population follows a Poisson-like distribution. An alternative\napproach based on nonlinear rate equations for the molecular state populations\nand the mean plasmon number also reproduce the main lasing characteristics of\nthe system.\n", "  We construct a 5D, N = 2 Euclidean theory of supergravity coupled to vector\nmultiplets. Upon reducing this theory over a circle we recover the action of\n4D, N = 2 Euclidean supergravity coupled to vector multiplets.\n", "  Infrared emission from intergalactic dust might compromise the ability of\nfuture experiments to detect subtle spectral distortions in the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) from the early Universe. We provide the first\nestimate of foreground contamination of the CMB signal due to diffuse dust\nemission in the intergalactic medium. We use models of the extragalactic\nbackground light to calculate the intensity of intergalactic dust emission and\nfind that emission by intergalactic dust at redshifts z<0.5 exceeds the\nsensitivity of the planned Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) to CMB\nspectral distortions by 1-3 orders of magnitude. We place an upper limit of\n0.23% on the contribution to the far-infrared background from intergalactic\ndust emission.\n", "  We show that the temperature of a diffusing fluid with the diffusion constant\n\\kappa^{2} in an expanding universe approaches a constant limit T=\\kappa^{2}/H\nin its final de Sitter stage characterized by the horizon 1/H determined by the\nHubble constant. If de Sitter surface temperature in the final equilibrium\nstate coincides with the fluid temperature then the cosmological constant\n\\Lambda=3H^{2}=6\\pi\\kappa^{2}.\n", "  Supersymmetric localization provides exact results that should match QFT\ncomputations in some regularization scheme. The agreement is particularly\nsubtle in three dimensions where complex answers from localization procedure\nsometimes arise. We investigate this problem by studying the expectation value\nof the 1/6 BPS Wilson loop in planar ABJ(M) theory at three loops in\nperturbation theory. We reproduce the corresponding term in the localization\nresult and argue that it originates entirely from a non-trivial framing of the\ncircular contour. Contrary to pure Chern-Simons theory, we point out that for\nABJ(M) the framing phase is a non-trivial function of the couplings and that it\npotentially receives contributions from vertex-like diagrams. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss the intimate link between the exact framing factor and the\nBremsstrahlung function of the 1/2-BPS cusp.\n", "  Randomly coupled neural fields demonstrate chaotic variation of firing rates,\nif the coupling is strong enough, as has been shown by Sompolinsky et. al\n[Phys. Rev. Lett., v. 61, 259 (1988)]. We present a method for reconstruction\nof the coupling matrix from the observations of the chaotic firing rates. The\napproach is based on the particular property of the nonlinearity in the\ncoupling, as the latter is determined by a sigmoidal gain function. We\ndemonstrate that for a large enough data set, the method gives an accurate\nestimation of the coupling matrix and of other parameters of the system,\nincluding the gain function.\n", "  [Fe II] emission lines are prominent in the infrared (IR), and they are\nimportant diagnostic tools for radiative atomic shocks. We investigate the\nemission characteristics of [Fe II] lines using a shock code developed by\nRaymond (1979) with updated atomic parameters. We first review general\ncharacteristics of IR [Fe II] emission lines from shocked gas, and derive [Fe\nII] line fluxes as a function of shock speed and ambient density. We have\ncompiled the available IR [Fe II] line observations of interstellar shocks and\ncompare them to the ratios predicted from our model. The sample includes both\nyoung and old supernova remnants in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud\nand several Herbig-Haro objects. We find that the observed ratios of IR [Fe II]\nlines generally fall on our grid of shock models, but the ratios of some\nmid-infrared lines, e.g., [Fe II] 35.35 um/[Fe II] 25.99 um, [Fe II] 5.340\num/[Fe II] 25.99 um, and [Fe II] 5.340 um/[Fe II] 17.94 um, are significantly\noffset from our model grid. We discuss possible explanations and conclude that\nthe uncertainty in atomic rates might be the major source of uncertainty, while\nuncertainties in the shock modeling and the observations certainly exist.\n", "  Active matter systems are driven out of thermal equilibrium by a lack of\ngeneralized Stokes-Einstein relation between injection and dissipation of\nenergy at the microscopic scale. We consider such a system of interacting\nparticles, propelled by persistent noises, and show that, at small but finite\npersistence time, their dynamics still satisfy a time-reversal symmetry. To do\nso, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for\nshort persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such\nsystems with an effective Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem akin to that of\nthermal equilibrium systems. Last we show how interacting particle systems with\nviscous drags and correlated noises can be seen as in equilibrium with a\nvisco-elastic bath but driven out of equilibrium by non-conservative forces,\nhence providing an energetic insight on the departure of active systems from\nequilibrium.\n", "  The time-dependent optical properties of molecular systems are investigated\nby step-scan Fourier-transform spectroscopy in order to explore the dynamics at\nphase transitions and molecular orientation in the milli- and microsecond\nrange. The electrical switching of liquid crystals traced by vibrational\nspectroscopy reveals a rotation of the molecules with a relaxation time of 2\nms. The photo-induced neutral-ionic transition in TTF-CA takes place by a\nsuppression of the dimerization in the ionic phase and creation of neutral\ndomains. The time-dependent infrared spectra depend on temperature and laser\npulse intensity; the relaxation of the spectra follows a stretched-exponential\ndecay with relaxation times in the microsecond range strongly dependent on\ntemperature and laser intensity. We present all details of the experimental\nsetups and thoroughly discuss the technical challenges.\n", "  We give an explicit construction of a class of F-theory models with matter in\nthe three-index symmetric (4) representation of SU(2). This matter is realized\nat codimension two loci in the F-theory base where the divisor carrying the\ngauge group is singular; the associated Weierstrass model does not have the\nform associated with a generic SU(2) Tate model. For 6D theories, the matter is\nlocalized at a triple point singularity of arithmetic genus g=3 in the curve\nsupporting the SU(2) group. This is the first explicit realization of matter in\nF-theory in a representation corresponding to a genus contribution greater than\none. The construction is realized by \"unHiggsing\" a model with a U(1) gauge\nfactor under which there is matter with charge q=3. The resulting SU(2) models\ncan be further unHiggsed to realize non-Abelian G_2xSU(2) models with more\nconventional matter content or SU(2)^3 models with trifundamental matter. The\nU(1) models used as the basis for this construction do not seem to have a\nWeierstrass realization in the general form found by Morrison-Park, suggesting\nthat a generalization of that form may be needed to incorporate models with\narbitrary matter representations and gauge groups localized on singular\ndivisors.\n", "  We use polarized Raman scattering to study the structural phase transition in\nEuFe2As2, the parent compound of the 122-ferropnictide superconductors. The\nin-plane lattice anisotropy is characterized by measurements of the side\nsurface with different strains induced using different preparation methods. We\nshow that while a fine surface polishing leaves the samples free of residual\ninternal strain, in which case the onset of the C4 symmetry breaking is\nobserved at the nominal structural phase transition temperature Ts, cutting the\nside surface induces a permanent four-fold rotational symmetry C4 breaking\nspanning tens of degrees above Ts.\n", "  We derive a mathematical model of a nematic electrolyte based on a\nvariational formulation of nematodynamics. Extending our previous work, we\nconsider a general setup which incorporates dielectric anisotropy of the\nliquid-crystalline matrix and the full set of nematic viscosities. We verify\nthe model by comparing its predictions to the results of the experiments on the\nsubstrate-controlled liquid-crystal-enabled electrokinetics. In the experiments\na nematic liquid crystal confined to a thin planar cell with surface-patterned\nanchoring conditions exhibit electro-osmotic flows along the \"guiding rails\"\nimposed by the spatially varying director.\n", "  We propose and analyse a quantum electromechanical system composed of a\nmonolithic quartz bulk acoustic wave (BAW) oscillator coupled to a\nsuperconducting transmon qubit via an intermediate LC electrical circuit.\nMonolithic quartz oscillators offer unprecedentedly high effective masses and\nquality factors for the investigation of mechanical oscillators in the quantum\nregime. Ground-state cooling of such mechanical modes via resonant\npiezoelectric coupling to an LC circuit, which is itself sideband cooled via\ncoupling to a transmon qubit, is shown to be feasible. The fluorescence\nspectrum of the qubit, containing motional sideband contributions due to the\ncouplings to the oscillator modes, is obtained and the imprint of the\nelectromechanical steady-state on the spectrum is determined. This allows the\nqubit to function both as a cooling resource for, and transducer of, the\nmechanical oscillator. The results described are relevant to any hybrid quantum\nsystem composed of a qubit coupled to two (coupled or uncoupled) thermal\noscillator modes.\n", "  We describe and constrain the origins of ISM structures likely created by\nongoing ICM ram pressure stripping in two Virgo Cluster spirals, NGC 4522 and\nNGC 4402, using HST BVI images of dust extinction and stars, as well as\nsupplementary HI, Halpha, and radio continuum images. This is the\nhighest-resolution study to date of the physical processes that occur during an\nICM-ISM ram pressure stripping interaction, ram pressure stripping's effects on\nthe multi-phase, multi-density ISM, and the formation and evolution of\nram-pressure-stripped tails. In dust extinction, we view the leading side of\nNGC 4402 and the trailing side of NGC 4522; we see distinct types of features\nin both galaxies. NGC 4522 has experienced stronger, more recent pressure and\nhas the jellyfish morphology characteristic of some ram pressure stripped\ngalaxies. Its stripped tail extends up from the disk plane in continuous\nupturns of dust and stars curving ~2 kpc above the disk plane. A kinematically\nand morphologically distinct extraplanar arm of young, blue stars and ISM\nextends above a mostly-stripped portion of the disk, and between it and the\ndisk plane are decoupled dust clouds. NGC 4402 contains long dust ridges,\nsuggesting that large parts of the ISM are being pushed out at once. Both\ngalaxies contain long ridges of polarized radio continuum emission indicating\nthe presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. We propose that magnetic\nfields could bind together gas of different densities, causing nearby gas of\ndifferent densities to be stripped at the same rate and creating the large,\ncoherent dust ridges and upturns. A number of factors that play roles in\ndetermining what types of structures form as a result of ram pressure: ram\npressure strength and history, the location within the galaxy relative to the\nleading side, and pre-existing substructure in the ISM that may be bound\ntogether by magnetic fields.\n", "  An in situ study of the epitaxial growth of SmN thin films on Ga-polar GaN\n(0001)templates by molecular beam epitaxy is reported. Using X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy we found that Ga segregates at the surface during\nthe first stages of growth. We showed that the problem related to Ga surface\nsegregation can be simply suppressed by growing a few monolayers of AlN before\nstarting the SmN growth. This results in a significant improvement of the\ncrystallinity of SmN thin films assessed by X-ray diffraction.\n", "  Fourier-positivity, i.e. the mathematical property that a function has a\npositive Fourier transform, can be used as a constraint on the parametrization\nof QCD dipole-target cross-sections or Wilson line correlators in transverse\nposition (r) space. They are Bessel transforms of positive transverse momentum\ndependent gluon distributions. Using mathematical Fourier-positivity\nconstraints on the limit r -> 0 behavior of the dipole amplitudes, we identify\nthe common origin of the violation of Fourier-positivity for various, however\nphenomenologically convenient, dipole models. It is due to the behavior\nr^{2+epsilon}, epsilon>0, softer, even slightly, than color transparency.\nFourier-positivity seems thus to conflict with the present dipole formalism\nwhen it includes a QCD running coupling constant alpha(r).\n", "  We study the 1-loop renormalization group equation running in the simplest\nsinglet Majoron model constructed by us earlier to accommodate the dark\nradiation and dark matter content in the universe. A comprehensive numerical\nstudy was performed to explore the whole model parameter space. A smaller\neffective number of neutrinos $\\triangle N_{eff}\\sim 0.05$, or a Majoron\ndecoupling temperature higher than the charm quark mass, is preferred. We found\nthat a heavy scalar dark matter, $\\rho$, of mass $1.5-4$ TeV is required by the\nstability of the scalar potential and an operational type-I see-saw mechanism\nfor neutrino masses. A neutral scalar, $S$, of mass in the $10-100$ GeV range\nand its mixing with the standard model Higgs as large as $0.1$ is also\npredicted. The dominant decay modes are $S$ into $b\\bar{b}$ and/or\n$\\omega\\omega$. A sensitive search will come from rare $Z$ decays via the chain\n$Z\\rightarrow S+ f\\bar{f}$, where $f$ is a Standard Model fermion, followed by\n$S$ into a pair of Majoron and/or b-quarks. The interesting consequences of\ndark matter bound state due to the sizable $S\\rho \\rho$-coupling are discussed\nas well. In particular, shower-like events with an apparent neutrino energy at\n$M_\\rho$ could contribute to the observed effective neutrino flux in\nunderground neutrino detectors such as IceCube.\n", "  The quantum excitations of the collective magnetization dynamics in a\nferromagnet (F) - magnons - enable spin transport without an associated charge\ncurrent. This pure spin current can be transferred to electrons in an adjacent\nnon-magnetic conductor (N). We evaluate the finite temperature noise of the\nmagnon-mediated spin current injected into N by an adjacent F driven by a\ncoherent microwave field. We find that the dipolar interaction leads to\nsqueezing of the magnon modes giving them wavevector dependent non-integral\nspin, which directly manifests itself in the shot noise. For temperatures\nhigher than the magnon gap, the thermal noise is dominated by large wavevector\nmagnons which exhibit negligible squeezing. The noise spectrum is white up to\nthe frequency corresponding to the maximum of the temperature or the magnon\ngap. At larger frequencies, the noise is dominated by vacuum fluctuations. The\nshot noise is found to be much larger than its thermal counterpart over a broad\ntemperature range, making the former easier to be measured experimentally.\n", "  In the framework of metric-like approach, totally symmetric arbitrary spin\nbosonic conformal fields propagating in flat space-time are studied. Depending\non the values of conformal dimension, spin, and dimension of space-time, we\nclassify all conformal field as long, partial-short, short, and special\nconformal fields. An ordinary-derivative (second-derivative) Lagrangian\nformulation for such conformal fields is obtained. The ordinary-derivative\nLagrangian formulation is realized by using double-traceless gauge fields,\nStueckelberg fields, and auxiliary fields. Gauge-fixed Lagrangian invariant\nunder global BRST transformations is obtained. The gauge-fixed BRST Lagrangian\nis used for the computation of partition functions for all conformal fields.\nUsing the result for the partition functions, numbers of propagating D.o.F for\nthe conformal fields are also found.\n", "  We discuss a modified gravity theory defined by $f(R) = \\sum_{n}^{l} \\alpha_n\nM^{2(1-n)} R^n$. We consider both finite and infinite number of terms in the\nseries while requiring that the Einstein frame potential of the theory has a\nflat area around any of its stationary points. We show that the requirement of\nmaximally flat stationary point leads to the existence of the saddle point\n(local maximum) for even (odd) $l$. In both cases for $l\\to\\infty$ one obtains\nthe Starobinsky model with small, exponentially suppressed corrections. Besides\nthe GR minimum the Einstein frame potential has an anti de Sitter vacuum.\nHowever we argue that the GR vacuum is absolutely stable and AdS cannot be\nreached neither via classical evolution nor via quantum tunnelling. Our results\nshow that a Starobinsky-like model is the only possible realisation of $f(R)$\ntheory with an extremely flat area in the Einstein frame potential.\n", "  Icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) with extremely high degrees of translational\norder have been produced in the laboratory and found in naturally occurring\nminerals, yet questions remain about how IQCs form. In particular, the\nfundamental question of how locally determined additions to a growing cluster\ncan lead to the intricate long-range correlations in IQCs remains open. In\nanswer to this question, we have developed an algorithm that is capable of\nproducing a perfectly ordered IQC, yet relies exclusively on local rules for\nsequential, face-to-face addition of tiles to a cluster. When the algorithm is\nseeded with a special type of cluster containing a defect, we find that growth\nis forced to infinity with high probability and that the resultant IQC has a\nvanishing density of defects. The geometric features underlying this algorithm\ncan inform analyses of experimental systems and numerical models that generate\nhighly ordered quasicrystals.\n", "  We apply the low-energy theorems to analyze the recent lattice QCD results\nfor the two-nucleon system at a pion mass of $M_\\pi\\simeq 450$ MeV obtained by\nthe NPLQCD collaboration. We find that the binding energies of the deuteron and\ndineutron are inconsistent with the low-energy behavior of the corresponding\nphase shifts within the quoted uncertainties and vice versa. Using the binding\nenergies of the deuteron and dineutron as input, we employ the low-energy\ntheorems to predict the phase shifts and extract the scattering length and the\neffective range in the $^3S_1$ and $^1S_0$ channels. Our results for these\nquantities are consistent with those obtained by the NPLQCD collaboration from\neffective field theory analyses but are in conflict with their determination\nbased on the effective-range approximation.\n", "  One of the most celebrated findings in complex systems in the last decade is\nthat different indexes y (e.g., patents) scale nonlinearly with the\npopulation~x of the cities in which they appear, i.e., $y\\sim x^\\beta, \\beta\n\\neq 1$. More recently, the generality of this finding has been questioned in\nstudies using new databases and different definitions of city boundaries. In\nthis paper we investigate the existence of nonlinear scaling using a\nprobabilistic framework in which fluctuations are accounted explicitly. In\nparticular, we show that this allows not only to (a) estimate $\\beta$ and\nconfidence intervals, but also to (b) quantify the evidence in favor of $\\beta\n\\neq 1$ and (c) test the hypothesis that the observations are compatible with\nthe nonlinear scaling. We employ this framework to compare $5$ different models\nto $15$ different datasets and we find that the answers to points (a)-(c)\ncrucially depend on the fluctuations contained in the data, on how they are\nmodeled, and on the fact that the city sizes are heavy-tailed distributed.\n", "  We construct four kinds of Z3-symmetric three-dimentional (3-d) Potts models,\neach with different number of states at each site on a 3-d lattice, by\nextending the 3-d three-state Potts model. Comparing the ordinary Potts model\nwith the four Z3-symmetric Potts models, we investigate how Z3 symmetry affects\nthe sign problem and see how the deconfinement transition line changes in the\n$\\mu-\\kappa$ plane as the number of states increases, where $\\mu$ $(\\kappa)$\nplays a role of chemical potential (temperature) in the models. We find that\nthe sign problem is almost cured by imposing Z3 symmetry. This mechanism may\nhappen in Z3-symmetric QCD-like theory. We also show that the deconfinement\ntransition line has stronger $\\mu$-dependence with respect to increasing the\nnumber of states.\n", "  We propose four different thermodynamically stable structural phases of\narsenic monolayers based on ab-initio density functional theory calculations\nall of which undergo a topological phase transition on application of a\nperpendicular electric field. All the four arsenic monolayer allotropes have a\nwide band gap, varying from 1.21 eV to 3.0 eV (based on GW calculations), and\nin general they undergo a metal-insulator quantum phase transition on\napplication of uniaxial in-layer strain. Additionally an increasing transverse\nelectric field induces band-inversion at the {\\Gamma} point in all four\nmonolayer allotropes, leading to a nontrivial topological phase (insulating for\nthree and metallic for one allotrope), characterized by the switching of the Z2\nindex, from 0 (before band inversion) to 1 (after band inversion). The\ntopological phase tuned by the transverse electric field, should support\nspin-separated gapless edge states which should manifest in quantum spin Hall\neffect.\n", "  We present a viable string embedding of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis in type IIB\nsequestered models where the late-time decay of the lightest modulus reheats\nthe universe to relatively low temperatures. We show that if inflation is\ndriven by a blow-up Kaehler modulus, the Affleck-Dine field can become\ntachyonic during inflation if the Kaehler metric for matter fields has an\nappropriate inflaton-dependent contribution. We find that the Affleck-Dine\nmechanism can generate the observed baryon asymmetry for natural values of the\nunderlying parameters which lead also to successful inflation and low-energy\ngaugino masses in a split supersymmetry scenario. The reheating temperature\nfrom the lightest modulus decay is high enough to allow thermal Higgsino-like\ndark matter.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the Orion Nebula that cover the OMC1 outflow\nregion. Our focus in this paper is on compact emission from protoplanetary\ndisks. We mosaicked a field containing $\\sim 600$ near-IR-identified young\nstars, around which we can search for sub-mm emission tracing dusty disks.\nApproximately 100 sources are known proplyds identified with HST. We detect\ncontinuum emission at 1 mm wavelengths towards $\\sim 20\\%$ of the proplyd\nsample, and $\\sim 8\\%$ of the larger sample of near-IR objects. The noise in\nour maps allows 4$\\sigma$ detection of objects brighter than $\\sim 1.5$ mJy,\ncorresponding to protoplanetary disk masses larger than 1.5 M$_{\\rm J}$ (using\nstandard assumptions about dust opacities and gas-to-dust ratios). None of\nthese disks are detected in contemporaneous CO(2-1) or C$^{18}$O(2-1)\nobservations, suggesting that the gas-to-dust ratios may be substantially\nsmaller than the canonical value of 100. Furthermore, since dust grains may\nalready be sequestered in large bodies in ONC disks, the inferred masses of\ndisk solids may be underestimated. Our results suggest that the distribution of\ndisk masses in this region is compatible with the detection rate of massive\nplanets around M dwarfs, which are the dominant stellar constituent in the ONC.\n", "  We present fermionic model based on symmetric resonant tunneling\nheterostructure, which demonstrates spontaneous symmetry breaking in respect to\ncombined operations of space inversion (P) and time reversal (T). PT-symmetry\nbreaking manifests itself in resonance coalescence (collapse of resonances). We\nshow that resonant energies are determined by eigenvalues of auxiliary\npseudo-Hermitian PT-invariant Hamiltonian.\n", "  Hoyt & Schatten (1998) claim that Simon Marius would have observed the sun\nfrom 1617 Jun 7 to 1618 Dec 31 (Gregorian calendar) all days, except three\nshort gaps in 1618, but would never have detected a sunspot -- based on a\nquotation from Marius in Wolf (1857), but misinterpreted by Hoyt & Schatten.\nMarius himself specified in early 1619 that \"for one and a half year ... rather\nfew or more often no spots could be detected ... which was never observed\nbefore\" (Marius 1619). The generic statement by Marius can be interpreted such\nthat the active day fraction was below 0.5 (but not zero) from fall 1617 to\nspring 1619 and that it was 1 before fall 1617 (since August 1611). Hoyt &\nSchatten cite Zinner (1952), who referred to Zinner (1942), where observing\ndates by Marius since 1611 are given, but which were not used by Hoyt &\nSchatten. We present all relevant texts from Marius where he clearly stated\nthat he observed many spots in different form on and since 1611 Aug 3 (Julian)\n= Aug 13 (Greg.) (on the first day together with Ahasverus Schmidnerus), 14\nspots on 1612 May 30 (Julian) = Jun 9 (Greg.), which is consistent with\ndrawings by Galilei and Jungius for that day, the latter is shown here for the\nfirst time, at least one spot on 1611 Oct 3 and/or 11 (Julian), i.e. Oct 13\nand/or 21 (Greg.), when he changed his sunspot observing technique, he also\nmentioned that he has drawn sunspots for 1611 Nov 17 (Julian) = Nov 27 (Greg.),\nin addition to those clearly datable detections, there is evidence in the texts\nfor regular observations. ... Sunspots records by Malapert from 1618 to 1621\nshow that the last low-latitude spot was seen in Dec 1620, while the first\nhigh-latitude spots were noticed in June and Oct 1620, so that the Schwabe\ncycle turnover (minimum) took place around that time, ...\n", "  We investigate the coherent dynamics of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein\ncondensate in a system consisting of two bosonic reservoirs coupled via a\nspatially localized mode. We describe this system by a two-terminal\nFano-Anderson model and investigate analytically the time evolution of\nobservables such as the bosonic Josephson current. In doing so, we find that\nthe Josephson current sensitively depends on the on-site energy of the\nlocalized mode. This facilitates to use this setup as a transistor for a\nBose-Einstein condensate. We identify two regimes. In one regime, the system\nexhibits well-behaved long-time dynamics with a slowly oscillating and undamped\nJosephson current. In a second regime, the Josephson current is a superposition\nof an extremely weakly damped slow oscillation and an undamped fast\noscillation. Our results are confirmed by finite-size simulations.\n", "  We study the dynamical phase transition out of an excitonic insulator phase\nafter photo-excitation using a time-dependent extension of the selfconsistent\nGW method. We connect the evolution of the photoemission spectra to the\ndynamics of the excitonic order parameter and identify two dynamical phase\ntransition points marked by a slowdown in the relaxation: one critical point is\nconnected with the trapping in a nonthermal state with reduced exciton density\nand the second corresponds to the thermal phase transition. The transfer of\nkinetic energy from the photoexcited carriers to the exciton condensate is\nshown to be the main mechanism for the gap melting. We analyze the low energy\ndynamics of screening, which strongly depends on the presence of the excitonic\ngap, and argue that it is difficult to interpret the static component of the\nscreened interaction as the effective interaction of some low energy model.\nInstead we propose a phenomenological measure for the effective interaction\nwhich indicates that screening has minor effects on the low energy dynamics.\n", "  On the basis of the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS), a detailed\nsystematic investigation of the O Vz stars is presented. The currently used\nspectral classification criteria are rediscussed, and the Vz phenomenon is\nrecalibrated through the addition of a quantitative criterion based on the\nequivalent widths of the He I 4471, He II 4542, and He II 4686 spectral lines.\nThe GOSSS O Vz and O V populations resulting from the newly adopted spectral\nclassification criteria are comparatively analyzed. The locations of the O Vz\nstars are probed, showing a concentration of the most extreme cases toward the\nyoungest star forming regions. The occurrence of the Vz spectral peculiarity in\na solar-metallicity environment, as predicted by the fastwind code, is also\ninvestigated, confirming the importance of taking into account several\nprocesses for the correct interpretation of the phenomenon.\n", "  We consider phase transitions and their contributions to vacuum energy in the\nmanifestly local theory of vacuum energy sequestering. We demonstrate that the\nabsence of instabilities imposes constraints on the couplings of gravitating\nand non-gravitating sectors, which can be satisfied in a large class of models.\nWe further show by explicit construction that the vacuum energy contributions\nto the effective cosmological constant in the descendant vacua are generically\nstrongly suppressed by the ratios of spacetime volumes of parent and descendant\ngeometries. This means that the cosmological constant in de Sitter descendant\nvacua remains insensitive to phase transitions which may have occurred in the\ncourse of its cosmic history.\n", "  We study the disordered XYZ spin chain using the recently developed Spectrum\nBifurcation Renormalization Group (SBRG) numerical method. With strong\ndisorder, the phase diagram consists of three many body localized (MBL) spin\nglass phases. We argue that, with sufficiently strong disorder, these spin\nglass phases are separated by marginally many-body localized (MBL) critical\nlines. We examine the critical lines of this model by measuring the\nentanglement entropy and Edwards-Anderson spin glass order parameter, and find\nthat the critical lines are characterized by an effective central charge\nc'=ln2. Our data also suggests continuously varying critical exponents along\nthe critical lines. We also demonstrate how long-range mutual information can\ndistinguish these phases.\n", "  We investigate the generic features of the low energy dynamical spin\nstructure factor of the Kitaev honeycomb quantum spin liquid perturbed away\nfrom its exact soluble limit by generic symmetry-allowed exchange couplings. We\nfind that the spin gap persists in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, but generally\nvanishes provided more generic symmetry-allowed interactions exist. We\nformulate the generic expansion of the spin operator in terms of fractionalized\nMajorana fermion operators according to the symmetry enriched topological order\nof the Kitaev spin liquid, described by its projective symmetry group. The\ndynamical spin structure factor displays power-law scaling bounded by Dirac\ncones in the vicinity of the $\\Gamma$, $K$ and $K'$ points of the Brillouin\nzone, rather than the spin gap found for the exactly soluble point.\n", "  Muon spin rotation measurements have been performed on a powder sample of\na-RuCl3, a layered material which previously has been proposed to be a quantum\nmagnet on a honeycomb lattice close to a quantum spin liquid ground state. Our\ndata reveal two distinct phase transitions at 11 K and 14 K which we interpret\nas originating from the onset of three-dimensional order and in-plane magnetic\norder, respectively. We identify, with the help of density functional theory\ncalculations, likely muon stopping sites and combine these with dipolar field\ncalculations to show that the two measured muon rotation frequencies are\nconsistent with two inequivalent muon sites within a zig-zag antiferromagnetic\nstructure proposed previously.\n", "  The pure spinor formalism for the superstring can be formulated as a twisted\nN=2 worldsheet theory with fermionic generators $j_{BRST}$ and composite $b$\nghost. After untwisting the formalism to an N=1 worldsheet theory with\nfermionic stress tensor $j_{BRST}+b$, the worldsheet variables combine into N=1\nworldsheet superfields $X^m$ and $\\Theta^\\alpha$ together with a superfield\nconstraint relating $DX^m$ and $D\\Theta^\\alpha$. The constraint implies that\nthe worldsheet superpartner of $\\theta^\\alpha$ is a bosonic twistor variable,\nand different solutions of the constraint give rise to the pure spinor or\nextended RNS formalisms, as well as a new twistor-string formalism with\nmanifest N=1 worldsheet supersymmetry.\n  These N=1 worldsheet methods generalize in curved Ramond-Ramond backgrounds,\nand a manifestly N=1 worldsheet supersymmetric action is proposed for the\nsuperstring in an $AdS_5\\times S^5$ background in terms of the twistor\nsuperfields. This $AdS_5\\times S^5$ worldsheet action is a remarkably simple\nfermionic coset model with manifest $PSU(2,2|4)$ symmetry and might be useful\nfor computing $AdS_5\\times S^5$ superstring scattering amplitudes.\n", "  We analyze the influence of a dissipative environment on geometric phases in\na quantum system subject to non-adiabatic evolution. We find dissipative\ncontributions to the acquired phase and modification of dephasing, considering\nthe cases of weak short-correlated noise as well as of slow quasi-stationary\nnoise. Motivated by recent experiments, we find the leading non-adiabatic\ncorrections to the results, known for the adiabatic limit.\n", "  For holographic CFT states near the vacuum, entanglement entropies for\nspatial subsystems can be expressed perturbatively as an expansion in the\none-point functions of local operators dual to light bulk fields. Using the\nconnection between quantum Fisher information for CFT states and canonical\nenergy for the dual spacetimes, we describe a general formula for this\nexpansion up to second-order in the one-point functions, for an arbitrary\nball-shaped region, extending the first-order result given by the entanglement\nfirst law. For two-dimensional CFTs, we use this to derive a completely\nexplicit formula for the second-order contribution to the entanglement entropy\nfrom the stress tensor. We show that this stress tensor formula can be\nreproduced by a direct CFT calculation for states related to the vacuum by a\nlocal conformal transformation. This result can also be reproduced via the\nperturbative solution to a non-linear scalar wave equation on an auxiliary de\nSitter spacetime, extending the first-order result in arXiv/1509.00113.\n", "  Despite the importance of pulsed jets for underwater propulsion, the effect\nof multiple-jet interactions remains poorly understood. We experimentally\ninvestigate how interactions between neighboring jets in a pulsed-jet thruster\naffect the thruster's propulsive performance. Using high-speed fluorescence\nimaging, we investigate the mutual influence of two pulsed jets under\nconditions relevant to low-speed maneuvering in a vehicle ($Re\\approx350,$\n$L/D\\leq2$). Thrust production and propulsive efficiency are evaluated for\ndifferent nozzle spacings using a new force estimation technique based on the\nfluorescence data. This analysis reveals that, compared to non-interacting\njets, the efficiency and thrust generated by the pair of interacting jets can\nfall by as much as 10\\% when the jets are brought into close proximity.\nEmpirically, the thrust $T$ falls off with the non-dimensional jet spacing\n$\\widetilde{\\Delta}$ as $T=T_\\infty(1-Co \\widetilde{\\Delta}^{-6})$ for a thrust\ncoupling coefficient $Co=2.04 \\pm 0.11.$ Finally, we predict this leading order\ndependence of thrust on spacing using a model that relates the thrust and\nefficiency drop to streamline curvature and vortex induction at the nozzles.\n", "  Radio-mode AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of galaxy groups\nand clusters. Its physical origin lies in the kpc-scale interaction of AGN jets\nwith the intracluster medium. Large-scale jet simulations often initiate light\ninternally-supersonic jets with density contrast $0.01<\\eta<1$. Here we argue\nfor the first time for the importance of very-light ($\\eta<0.01$)\ninternally-subsonic jets. We investigated the shapes of young X-ray cavities\nproduced in a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and found that bottom-wide\ncavities are always produced by internally-subsonic jets, while\ninternally-supersonic jets inflate cylindrical, center-wide, or top-wide\ncavities. We found examples of real cavities with shapes analogous to those\ninflated in our simulations by internally-subsonic and internally-supersonic\njets, suggesting a dichotomy of AGN jets according to their internal Mach\nnumbers. We further studied the long-term cavity evolution, and found that old\ncavities resulted from light jets spread along the jet direction, while those\nproduced by very light jets are significantly elongated along the perpendicular\ndirection. The northwestern ghost cavity in Perseus is pancake-shaped,\nproviding tentative evidence for the existence of very light jets. Our\nsimulations show that very-light internally-subsonic jets decelerate faster and\nrise much slower in the ICM than light internally-supersonic jets, possibly\ndepositing a larger fraction of jet energy to cluster cores and alleviating the\nproblem of low coupling efficiencies found previously. The internal Mach number\npoints to the jet's energy content, and internally-subsonic jets are\nenergetically dominated by non-kinetic energy, such as thermal energy, cosmic\nrays, or magnetic fields.\n", "  Context: Dust is efficiently produced by cool giant stars, but the\ncondensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Aims: Identify and\ncharacterize aluminum bearing species in the circumstellar gas of Mira ($o$\nCeti) in order to elucidate their role in the production of Al$_2$O$_3$ dust.\nMethods: Multiepoch spectral line observations at (sub-)millimeter,\nfar-infrared, and optical wavelengths including: maps with ALMA which probe the\ngas distribution in the immediate vicinity of the star at ~30 mas; observations\nwith ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in 2013-2015 for studying cycle and inter-cycle\nvariability of the rotational lines of Al bearing molecules; optical records as\nfar back as 1965 to examine variations in electronic transitions over time\nspans of days to decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of\nthe spectral features which constrain the physical parameters of the gas.\nResults: Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al I are the\nmain observable aluminum species in Mira, although a significant fraction of\naluminum might reside in other species that have not yet been identified.\nStrong irregular variability in the (sub-)millimeter and optical features of\nAlO (possibly the direct precursor of Al$_2$O$_3$) indicates substantial\nchanges in the excitation conditions, or varying abundance that is likely\nrelated to shocks in the star. The inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might\ninfluence the spatial and temporal characteristics of dust production.\nConclusions: We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion from the\ngas, but the rich observational material constrains time dependent chemical\nnetworks. Future improvements should include spectroscopic characterization of\nhigher aluminum oxides, coordinated observations of dust and gas species at\ndifferent variability phases, and tools to derive abundances in shock excited\ngas.\n", "  Stimulated by the recent observation of the exotic $X(5568)$ state by D0\nCollaboration, we study the four-quark system $us\\bar{b}\\bar{d}$ with quantum\nnumbers $J^P=0^+$ in the framework of chiral quark model. Two structures,\ndiquark-antidiquark and meson-meson, with all possible color configurations are\ninvestigated by using Gaussian expansion method. The results show that energies\nof the tetraquark states with diquark-antiquark structure are too high to the\ncandidate of $X(5568)$, and no molecular structure can be formed in our\ncalculations. The calculation is also extended to the four-quark system\n$us\\bar{c}\\bar{d}$ and the same results as that of $us\\bar{b}\\bar{d}$ are\nobtained.\n", "  Line intensity mapping experiments seek to trace large scale structure by\nmeasuring the spatial fluctuations in the combined emission, in some convenient\nspectral line, from individually unresolved galaxies. An important systematic\nconcern for these surveys is line confusion from foreground or background\ngalaxies emitting in other lines that happen to lie at the same observed\nfrequency as the \"target\" emission line of interest. We develop an approach to\nseparate this \"interloper\" emission at the power spectrum level. If one adopts\nthe redshift of the target emission line in mapping from observed frequency and\nangle on the sky to co-moving units, the interloper emission is mapped to the\nwrong co-moving coordinates. Since the mapping is different in the line of\nsight and transverse directions, the interloper contribution to the power\nspectrum becomes anisotropic, especially if the interloper and target emission\nare at widely separated redshifts. This distortion is analogous to the\nAlcock-Paczynski test, but here the warping arises from assuming the wrong\nredshift rather than an incorrect cosmological model. We apply this to the case\nof a hypothetical [CII] emission survey at z~7 and find that the distinctive\ninterloper anisotropy can, in principle, be used to separate strong foreground\nCO emission fluctuations. In our models, however, a significantly more\nsensitive instrument than currently planned is required, although there are\nlarge uncertainties in forecasting the high redshift [CII] emission signal.\nWith upcoming surveys, it may nevertheless be useful to apply this approach\nafter first masking pixels suspected of containing strong interloper\ncontamination.\n", "  We present Gemini/GMOS imaging of twelve candidate intergalactic globular\nclusters (IGCs) in the Local Group, identified in a recent survey of the SDSS\nfootprint by di Tullio Zinn & Zinn (2015). Our image quality is sufficiently\nhigh, at $\\sim 0.4^{\\prime\\prime} - 0.7^{\\prime\\prime}$, that we are able to\nunambiguously classify all twelve targets as distant galaxies. To reinforce\nthis conclusion we use GMOS images of globular clusters in the M31 halo, taken\nunder very similar conditions, to show that any genuine clusters in the\nputative IGC sample would be straightforward to distinguish. Based on the\nstated sensitivity of the di Tullio Zinn & Zinn (2015) search algorithm, we\nconclude that there cannot be a significant number of IGCs with $M_V \\le -6$\nlying unseen in the SDSS area if their properties mirror those of globular\nclusters in the outskirts of M31 -- even a population of $4$ would have only a\n$\\approx 1\\%$ chance of non-detection.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is the ability of joint quantum systems to possess\nglobal properties (correlation among systems) even when subsystems have no\ndefinite individual property. Whilst the 2-dimensional (qubit) case is\nwell-understood, currently, tools to characterise entanglement in high\ndimensions are limited. We experimentally demonstrate a new procedure for\nentanglement certification that is suitable for large systems, based entirely\non information-theoretics. It scales more efficiently than Bell's inequality,\nand entanglement witness. The method we developed works for arbitrarily large\nsystem dimension $d$ and employs only two local measurements of complementary\nproperties. This procedure can also certify whether the system is maximally\nentangled. We illustrate the protocol for families of bipartite states of\nqudits with dimension up to $32$ composed of polarisation-entangled photon\npairs.\n", "  We consider the six dimensional N=(1,0) hypermultiplet model coupled to an\nexternal field of the Abelian vector multiplet in harmonic superspace approach.\nUsing the superfield proper-time technique we find the divergent part of the\neffective action and derive the complete finite induced low-energy superfield\neffective action. This effective action depends on external field and contains\nin bosonic sector all the powers of the constant Maxwell field strength. The\nobtained result can be treated as the 6D, N=(1,0) supersymmetric\nHeisenberg-Euler type effective action.\n", "  We present wide-field $g$ and $i$ band stellar photometry of the Sextans\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy and its surrounding area out to four times its\nhalf-light radius ($r_h=695\\,$pc), based on images obtained with the Dark\nEnergy Camera at the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO. We find clear evidence of\nstellar substructure associated with the galaxy, extending to a distance of\n$82\\arcmin$ (2\\,kpc) from its centre. We perform a statistical analysis of the\nover-densities and find three distinct features, as well as an extended\nhalo-like structure, to be significant at the $99.7\\%$ confidence level or\nhigher. Unlike the extremely elongated and extended substructures surrounding\nthe Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy, the over-densities seen around Sextans\nare distributed evenly about its centre, and do not appear to form noticeable\ntidal tails. Fitting a King model to the radial distribution of Sextans stars\nyields a tidal radius $r_t =83.2\\arcmin\\pm7.1\\arcmin$ (2.08$\\pm$0.18\\,kpc),\nwhich implies the majority of detected substructure is gravitationally bound to\nthe galaxy. This finding suggests that Sextans is not undergoing significant\ntidal disruption from the Milky Way, supporting the scenario in which the orbit\nof Sextans has a low eccentricity.\n", "  In this paper we study anisotropic spherical polytropes within the framework\nof general relativity. Using the anisotropic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV)\nequations, we explore the relativistic anisotropic Lane-Emden equations. We\nfind how the anisotropic pressure affects the boundary conditions of these\nequations. Also we argue that the behaviour of physical quantities near the\ncenter of star changes in the presence of anisotropy. For constant density, a\nclass of exact solution is derived with the aid of a new ansatz and its\nphysical properties are discussed.\n", "  This paper reports results of the third-year campaign of monitoring\nsuper-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) in active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) between 2014-2015. Ten new targets were selected from quasar\nsample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which are generally more luminous\nthan the SEAMBH candidates in last two years. H$\\beta$ lags ($\\tau_{_{\\rm\nH\\beta}}$) in five of the 10 quasars have been successfully measured in this\nmonitoring season. We find that the lags are generally shorter, by large\nfactors, than those of objects with same optical luminosity, in light of the\nwell-known $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$ relation. The five quasars have\ndimensionless accretion rates of $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}=10-10^3$. Combining\nmeasurements of the previous SEAMBHs, we find that the reduction of H$\\beta$\nlags tightly depends on accretion rates, $\\tau_{_{\\rm\nH\\beta}}/\\tau_{_{R-L}}\\propto\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}^{-0.42}$, where $\\tau_{_{R-L}}$\nis the H$\\beta$ lag from the normal $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$ relation.\nFitting 63 mapped AGNs, we present a new scaling relation for the broad-line\nregion: $R_{_{\\rm\nH\\beta}}=\\alpha_1\\ell_{44}^{\\beta_1}\\,\\min\\left[1,\\left(\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}/\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_c\\right)^{-\\gamma_1}\\right]$,\nwhere $\\ell_{44}=L_{5100}/10^{44}\\,\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ is 5100 \\AA\\ continuum\nluminosity, and coefficients of $\\alpha_1=(29.6_{-2.8}^{+2.7})$ lt-d,\n$\\beta_1=0.56_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$, $\\gamma_1=0.52_{-0.16}^{+0.33}$ and\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_c=11.19_{-6.22}^{+2.29}$. This relation is applicable to\nAGNs over a wide range of accretion rates, from $10^{-3}$ to $10^3$.\nImplications of this new relation are briefly discussed.\n", "  The local atomic environments and magnetic properties were investigated for a\nseries of Co(1+x)Fe(2-x)Si (0<x<1) Heusler compounds. While the total magnetic\nmoment in these compounds increases with the number of valance electrons, the\nhighest Curie temperature (Tc) in this series was found for Co1.5Fe1.5Si, with\na Tc of 1069 K (24 K higher than the well known Co2FeSi). 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy was used to characterize the local atomic order and to estimate\nthe Co and Fe magnetic moments. Consideration of the local magnetic moments and\nthe exchange integrals is necessary to understand the trend in Tc.\n", "  Grassmann (or anti-commuting) variables are extensively used in theoretical\nphysics. In this paper we use Grassmann variable calculus to give new proofs of\ncelebrated combinatorial identities such as the Lindstr\\\"om-Gessel-Viennot\nformula for graphs with cycles and the Jacobi-Trudi identity. Moreover, we\ndefine a one parameter extension of Schur polynomials that obey a natural\nconvolution identity.\n", "  We show that ulta-dense Z-pinches with nanoscale dimensions can be generated\nby irradiating aligned nanowires with femtosecond laser pulses of relativistic\nintensity. Using fully three-dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell\nsimulations we demonstrate that the laser pulse drives a forward electron\ncurrent in the area around the wires. This forward current induces return\ncurrent densities of $\\sim$ 0.1 Giga-Amperes per $\\mu$m\\textsuperscript{2}\nthrough the wires. The resulting strong, quasi-static, self-generated azimuthal\nmagnetic field pinches the nanowires into hot plasmas with a peak electron\ndensity of $> 9\\cdot 10^{24}$ cm\\textsuperscript{-3}, exceeding 1000 times the\ncritical density. Arrays of these new ultra-dense nanopinches can be expected\nto lead to efficient micro-fusion and other applications.\n", "  We continue our investigation of gauge theories in which the Higgs boson\narises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) and top-partners arise as bound\nstates of three hyperfermions. All models have additional pNGBs in their\nspectrum that should be accessible at LHC. We analyze the patterns of symmetry\nbreaking and present all relevant couplings of the pNGBs with the gauge fields.\nWe discuss how vacuum misalignment and a mass for the pNGBs is generated by a\nloop-induced potential. Finally, we paint a very broad, qualitative, picture of\nthe kind of experimental signatures these models give rise to, setting the\nstage for further analysis.\n", "  We solve the nonperturbative renormalization-group flow equations for the\ntwo-dimensional XY model at the truncation level of the (complete) second-order\nderivative expansion. We compute the thermodynamic properties in the\nhigh-temperature phase and compare the non-universal features specific to the\nXY model with results from Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we study the\nposition and magnitude of the specific heat peak as a function of temperature.\nThe obtained results compare well with Monte Carlo simulations. We additionally\ngauge the accuracy of simplified nonperturbative renormalization-group\ntreatments relying on $\\phi^4$-type truncations. Our computation indicates that\nsuch an approximation is insufficient in the high-$T$ phase and a correct\nanalysis of the specific heat profile requires account of an infinite number of\ninteraction vertices.\n", "  We present a catalog of 840 X-ray sources and first results from a 100 ks\nChandra X-ray Observatory imaging study of the filamentary infrared dark cloud\nG014.225$-$00.506, which forms the central regions of a larger cloud complex\nknown as the M17 southwest extension (M17 SWex). In addition to the rich\npopulation of protostars and young stellar objects with dusty circumstellar\ndisks revealed by Spitzer Space Telescope archival data, we discover a\npopulation of X-ray-emitting, intermediate-mass pre--main-sequence stars (IMPS)\nthat lack infrared excess emission from circumstellar disks. We model the\ninfrared spectral energy distributions of this source population to measure its\nmass function and place new constraints on the inner dust disk destruction\ntimescales for 2-8 $M_{\\odot}$ stars. We also place a lower limit on the star\nformation rate (SFR) and find that it is quite high ($\\dot{M}\\ge\n0.007~M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), equivalent to several Orion Nebula Clusters in\nG14.225$-$0.506 alone, and likely accelerating. The cloud complex has not\nproduced a population of massive, O-type stars commensurate with its SFR. This\nabsence of very massive (${\\ge}20~M_{\\odot}$) stars suggests that either (1)\nM17 SWex is an example of a distributed mode of star formation that will\nproduce a large OB association dominated by intermediate-mass stars but\nrelatively few massive clusters, or (2) the massive cores are still in the\nprocess of accreting sufficient mass to form massive clusters hosting O stars.\n", "  The impact of biasing schemes on the clustering of tracers of the large-scale\nstructure is analytically studied in the weakly nonlinear regime. For this\npurpose, we use the one-loop approximation of the integrated perturbation\ntheory together with the renormalized bias functions of various, physically\nmotivated Lagrangian bias schemes. These include the halo, peaks and excursion\nset peaks model, for which we derive useful formulae for the evaluation of\ntheir renormalized bias functions. The shapes of the power spectra and\ncorrelation functions are affected by the different bias models at the level of\na few percent on weakly nonlinear scales. These effects are studied\nquantitatively both in real and redshift space. The amplitude of the\nscale-dependent bias in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity also depends\non the details of the bias models. If left unaccounted for, these theoretical\nuncertainties could affect the robustness of the cosmological constraints\nextracted from galaxy clustering data.\n", "  We propose a compact analytic expression for the polylogarithmic part of the\nn-point two-loop all-plus helicity amplitude in gauge theory.\n", "  The key challenge in superconductivity research is to go beyond the\nhistorical mode of discovery-driven research. We put forth a new strategy,\nwhich is to combine theoretical developments in the weak-coupling\nrenormalization group approach with the experimental developments in lattice\nstrain driven Fermi surface-engineering. For concreteness we theoretically\ninvestigate how superconducting tendencies will be affected by strain\nengineering of ruthenates' Fermi surface. We first demonstrate that our\napproach qualitatively reproduces recent experiments under uniaxial strain. We\nthen note that order few $\\%$ strain readily accessible to epitaxial thin\nfilms, can bring the Fermi surface close to van Hove singularity. Using the\nexperimental observation of the change in the Fermi surface under biaxial\nepitaxial strain and ab-initio calculations, we predict ${\\rm T}_{\\rm c}$ for\ntriplet pairing to be maximized by getting close to the van Hove singularities\nwithout tuning on to the singularity.\n", "  We perform Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations on a suite of $2500$ models of multiphase, outflowing media, which\nare characterized by $14$ parameters. We focus on the Ly$\\alpha$ spectra\nemerging from these media, and investigate which properties are dominant in\nshaping the emerging Ly$\\alpha$ profile. Multiphase models give rise to a wide\nvariety of emerging spectra, including single, double and triple peaked\nspectra. We find that the dominant parameters in shaping the spectra include\n(i) the cloud covering factor, $f_c$, in agreement with earlier studies, and\n(ii) the temperature and number density of residual HI in the hot ionized\nmedium. We attempt to reproduce spectra emerging from multiphase models with\n`shell models' which are commonly used to fit observed Ly$\\alpha$ spectra, and\ninvestigate the connection between shell-model parameters and the physical\nparameters of the clumpy media. In shell models, the neutral hydrogen content\nof the shell is one of the key parameters controlling Ly$\\alpha$ radiative\ntransfer. Because Ly$\\alpha$ spectra emerging from multi-phase media depend\nmuch less on the neutral hydrogen content of the clumps, the shell model\nparameters such as HI column density (but also shell velocity and dust content)\nare generally not well matched to the associated physical parameters of clumpy\nmedia.\n", "  We present a new database of our two-dimensional bulge-disk decompositions\nfor 14,233 galaxies drawn from SDSS DR12 in order to examine the properties of\nbulges residing in the local universe ($0.005 < z < 0.05$). We performed\ndecompositions in $g$ and $r$ bands by utilizing the {\\sc{galfit}} software.\nThe bulge colors and bulge-to-total ratios are found to be sensitive to the\ndetails in the decomposition technique, and hence we hereby provide full\ndetails of our method. The $g-r$ colors of bulges derived are almost constantly\nred regardless of bulge size except for the bulges in the low bulge-to-total\nratio galaxies ($B/T_{\\rm r} \\lesssim 0.3$). Bulges exhibit similar scaling\nrelations to those followed by elliptical galaxies, but the bulges in galaxies\nwith lower bulge-to-total ratios clearly show a gradually larger departure in\nslope from the elliptical galaxy sequence. The scatters around the scaling\nrelations are also larger for the bulges in galaxies with lower bulge-to-total\nratios. Both the departure in slopes and larger scatters are likely originated\nfrom the presence of young stars. The bulges in galaxies with low\nbulge-to-total ratios show signs of a frosting of young stars so substantial\nthat their luminosity-weighted Balmer-line ages are as small as 1\\,Gyr in some\ncases. While bulges seem largely similar in optical properties to elliptical\ngalaxies, they do show clear and systematic departures as a function of\nbulge-to-total ratio. The stellar properties and perhaps associated formation\nprocesses of bulges seem much more diverse than those of elliptical galaxies.\n", "  Stellar rotation, age spread and binary stars are thought to be three most\npossible causes of the peculiar color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of some star\nclusters, which exhibit extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs). It is far\nfrom getting a clear answer. This paper studies the effects of three above\ncauses on the CMDs of star clusters systematically. A rapid stellar\nevolutionary code and a recently published database of rotational effects of\nsingle stars have been used, via an advanced stellar population synthesis\ntechnique. As a result, we find a consistent result for rotation to recent\nworks, which suggests that rotation is able to explain, at least partially, the\neMSTOs of clusters, if clusters are not too old ($<$ 2.0\\,Gyr). In addition, an\nage spread of 200 to 500\\,Myr reproduces extended turn-offs for all clusters\nyounger than 2.5\\,Gyr, in particular, for those younger than 2.2\\,Gyr. Age\nspread also results in extended red clumps (eRCs) for clusters younger than\n0.5\\,Gyr. The younger the clusters, the clearer the eRC structures. Moreover,\nit is shown that binaries (including interactive binaries) affect the spread of\nMSTO slightly for old clusters, but they can contribute to the eMSTOs of\nclusters younger than 0.5\\,Gyr. Our result suggests a possible way to\ndisentangle the roles of stellar rotation and age spread, i.e., checking the\nexistence of CMDs with both eMSTO and eRC in clusters younger than 0.5\\,Gyr.\n", "  We compute correlation functions of chiral primary operators in N=2\nsuperconformal theories at large N using a construction based on supersymmetric\nlocalization recently developed by Gerchkovitz et al. We focus on N=4 SYM as\nwell as on superconformal QCD. In the case of N=4 we recover the free field\ntheory results as expected due to non-renormalization theorems. In the case of\nsuperconformal QCD we study the planar expansion in the large N limit. The\nfinal correlators admit a simple generalization to a finite N formula which\nexactly matches the various small $N$ results in the literature.\n", "  Using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, we derive limiting magnitude, spatial\ncompleteness and density maps that we use to probe the three dimensional\nstructure and estimate the stellar mass of the so-called Monoceros Ring. The\nMonoceros Ring is an enormous and complex stellar sub-structure in the outer\nMilky Way disk. It is most visible across the large Galactic Anticenter region,\n120 < l < 240 degrees, -30 < b < +40 degrees. We estimate its stellar mass\ndensity profile along every line of sight in 2 X 2 degree pixels over the\nentire 30,000 square degree Pan-STARRS1 survey using the previously developed\nMATCH software. By parsing this distribution into a radially smooth component\nand the Monoceros Ring, we obtain its mass and distance from the Sun along each\nrelevant line of sight. The Monoceros Ring is significantly closer to us in the\nSouth (6 kpc) than in the North (9 kpc). We also create 2D cross sections\nparallel to the Galactic plane that show 135 degrees of the Monoceros Ring in\nthe South and 170 degrees of the Monoceros Ring in the North. We show that the\nNorthern and Southern structures are also roughly concentric circles,\nsuggesting that they may be a wave rippling from a common origin. Excluding the\nGalactic plane, we observe an excess stellar mass of 4 million solar masses\nacross 120 < l < 240 degrees. If we interpolate across the Galactic plane, we\nestimate that this region contains 8 million solar masses. If we assume\n(somewhat boldly) that the Monoceros Ring is a set of two Galactocentric rings,\nits total stellar mass is 60 million solar masses. Finally, if we assume that\nit is a set of two circles centered at a point 4 kpc from the Galactic center\nin the anti-central direction, as our data suggests, we estimate its stellar\nmass to be 40 million solar masses.\n", "  Hot subluminous stars of spectral type B and O are core helium-burning stars\nat the blue end of the horizontal branch or have evolved even beyond that\nstage. Strikingly, the distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of\nHe-rich vs. He-poor hot subdwarf stars of the globular clusters omega Cen and\nNGC~2808 differ from that of their field counterparts. The metal-abundance\npatterns of hot subdwarfs are typically characterized by strong deficiencies of\nsome lighter elements as well as large enrichments of heavy elements. A large\nfraction of sdB stars are found in close binaries with white dwarf or very\nlow-mass main sequence companions, which must have gone through a\ncommon-envelope phase of evolution.They provide a clean-cut laboratory to study\nthis important but yet purely understood phase of stellar evolution. Substellar\ncompanions to sdB stars have also been found. For HW~Vir systems the companion\nmass distribution extends from the stellar into the brown dwarf regime. A giant\nplanet to the pulsator V391 Peg was the first discovery of a planet that\nsurvived the red giant evolution of its host star. Several types of pulsating\nstar have been discovered among hot subdwarf stars, the most common are the\ngravity-mode sdB pulsators (V1093 Her) and their hotter siblings, the p-mode\npulsating V361 Hya stars. Another class of multi-periodic pulsating hot\nsubdwarfs has been found in the globular cluster omega Cen that is unmatched by\nany field star. The masses of hot subdwarf stars are the key to understand the\nstars' evolution. A few pulsating sdB stars in eclipsing binaries have been\nfound that allow mass determination. The results are in good agreement with\npredictions from binary population synthesis. New classes of binaries, hosting\nextremely low mass (ELM) white dwarfs (M<0.3 Msun), have recently been\ndiscovered, filling a gap in the mosaic of binary stellar evolution.\n(abbreviated)\n", "  We present a scotogenic model, i.e. a one-loop neutrino mass model with dark\nright-handed neutrino gauge singlets and one inert dark scalar gauge doublet\n$\\eta$, which has symmetries that lead to co-bimaximal mixing, i.e. to an\natmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23} = 45^\\circ$ and to a $CP$-violating phase\n$\\delta = \\pm \\pi/2$, while the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ remains arbitrary.\nThe symmetries consist of softly broken lepton numbers $L_\\alpha$ ($\\alpha =\ne,\\mu,\\tau$), a non-standard $CP$ symmetry, and three $Z_2$ symmetries. We\nindicate two possibilities for extending the model to the quark sector. Since\nthe model has, besides $\\eta$, three scalar gauge doublets, we perform a\nthorough discussion of its scalar sector. We demonstrate that it can\naccommodate a Standard Model-like scalar with mass $125\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, with\nall the other charged and neutral scalars having much higher masses.\n", "  In this paper we report the occurrence of chimera patterns in a network of\nneuronal oscillators, which are coupled through {\\it local}, synaptic {\\it\ngradient} coupling. We discover a new chimera pattern, namely the {\\it\nimperfect traveling chimera} where the incoherent traveling domain spreads into\nthe coherent domain of the network. Remarkably, we also find that chimera\nstates arise even for {\\it one-way} local coupling, which is in contrast to the\nearlier belief that only nonlocal, global or nearest neighbor local coupling\ncan give rise to chimera; this find further relaxes the essential connectivity\nrequirement of getting a chimera state. We choose a network of identical\nbursting Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal oscillators and show that depending upon the\nrelative strength of the synaptic and gradient coupling several chimera\npatterns emerge. We map all the spatiotemporal behaviors in parameter space and\nidentify the transitions among several chimera patterns, in-phase synchronized\nstate and global amplitude death state.\n", "  Secret sharing of a quantum state, or quantum secret sharing, in which a\ndealer wants to share certain amount of quantum information with a few players,\nhas wide applications in quantum information. The critical criterion in a\nthreshold secret sharing scheme is confidentiality, with less than the\ndesignated number of players, no information can be recovered. Furthermore, in\na quantum scenario, one additional critical criterion exists, the capability of\nsharing entangled and unknown quantum information. Here by employing a\nsix-photon entangled state, we demonstrate a quantum threshold scheme, where\nthe shared quantum secrecy can be efficiently reconstructed with a state\nfidelity as high as 93%. By observing that any one or two parties cannot\nrecover the secrecy, we show that our scheme meets the confidentiality\ncriterion. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that entangled quantum information\ncan be shared and recovered via our setting, which demonstrates that our\nimplemented scheme is fully quantum. Moreover, our experimental setup can be\ntreated as a decoding circuit of the 5-qubit quantum error-correcting code with\ntwo erasure errors.\n", "  We present new astrometric measurements from our ongoing monitoring campaign\nof the HR 8799 directly imaged planetary system. These new data points were\nobtained with NIRC2 on the W.M. Keck II 10 meter telescope between 2009 and\n2014. In addition, we present updated astrometry from previously published\nobservations in 2007 and 2008. All data were reduced using the SOSIE algorithm,\nwhich accounts for systematic biases present in previously published\nobservations. This allows us to construct a self-consistent data set derived\nentirely from NIRC2 data alone. From this dataset, we detect acceleration for\ntwo of the planets (HR 8799b and e) at $>$3$\\sigma$. We also assess possible\norbital parameters for each of the four planets independently. We find no\nstatistically significant difference in the allowed inclinations of the\nplanets. Fitting the astrometry while forcing coplanarity also returns $\\chi^2$\nconsistent to within 1$\\sigma$ of the best fit values, suggesting that if\ninclination offsets of $\\lesssim$20$^{o}$ are present, they are not detectable\nwith current data. Our orbital fits also favor low eccentricities, consistent\nwith predictions from dynamical modeling. We also find period distributions\nconsistent to within 1$\\sigma$ with a 1:2:4:8 resonance between all planets.\nThis analysis demonstrates the importance of minimizing astrometric systematics\nwhen fitting for solutions to highly undersampled orbits.\n", "  Lovelock theory provides a tractable model of higher-curvature gravity in\nwhich several questions can be studied analytically. This is the reason why, in\nthe last years, this theory has become the favorite arena to study the effects\nof higher-curvature terms in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Lovelock\ntheory also admits extensions that permit to accommodate matter coupled to\ngravity in a non-minimal way. In this setup, problems such as the backreaction\nof matter on the black hole geometry can also be solved exactly. In this paper,\nwe study the thermodynamics of black holes in theories of gravity of this type,\nwhich include both higher-curvature terms, U(1) gauge fields, and conformal\ncouplings with matter fields in D dimensions. These charged black hole\nsolutions exhibit a backreacting scalar field configuration that is regular\neverywhere outside and on the horizon, and may exist both in asymptotically\nflat and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We work out explicitly the\nboundary action for this theory, which renders the variational problem\nwell-posed and suffices to regularize the Euclidean action in AdS. We also\ndiscuss several interrelated properties of the theory, such as its duality\nsymmetry under field redefinition and how it acts on black holes and\ngravitational wave solutions.\n", "  Debris discs are typically revealed through excess emission at infrared\nwavelengths. Most discs exhibit excess at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths,\nanalogous to the solar system's Asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. Recently,\nstars with strong (1 per cent) excess at near-infrared wavelengths were\nidentified through interferometric measurements. Using the HIgh Precision\nPolarimetric Instrument (HIPPI), we examined a sub-sample of these hot dust\nstars (and appropriate controls) at parts-per-million sensitivity in SDSS g'\n(green) and r' (red) filters for evidence of scattered light. No detection of\nstrongly polarized emission from the hot dust stars is seen. We therefore rule\nout scattered light from a normal debris disk as the origin of this emission. A\nwavelength dependent contribution from multiple dust components for hot dust\nstars is inferred from the dispersion (difference in polarization angle in red\nand green) of southern stars. Contributions of 17 ppm (green) and 30 ppm (red)\nare calculated, with strict 3 sigma upper limits of 76 and 68 ppm,\nrespectively. This suggests weak hot dust excesses consistent with thermal\nemission, although we cannot rule out contrived scenarios, e.g. dust in a\nspherical shell or face on discs. We also report on the nature of the local\ninterstellar medium, obtained as a byproduct of the control measurements.\nHighlights include the first measurements of the polarimetric colour of the\nlocal interstellar medium and discovery of a southern sky region with a\npolarization per distance thrice the previous maximum. The data suggest the\nwavelength of maximum polarization is bluer than typical.\n", "  Hyperfine structure of the ground $2^{2}S-$states of the three-electron atoms\nand ions is investigated. By using our recent numerical values for the doublet\nelectron density at the atomic nucleus we determine the hyperfine structure of\nthe ground (doublet) $2^{2}S-$state(s) in the ${}^{6}$Li and ${}^{7}$Li atoms.\nOur predicted values (228.2058 $MHz$ and 803.5581 $MHz$, respectivly) agree\nwell with the experimental values 228.20528(8) $MHz$ (${}^{6}$Li) and\n803.50404(48) $MHz$ (${}^{7}$Li (R.G. Schlecht and D.W. McColm, Phys. Rev.\n\\textbf{142}, 11 (1966))). The hyperfine structures of a number of lithium\nisotopes with short life-times, including ${}^{8}$Li, ${}^{9}$Li and\n${}^{11}$Li atoms are also predicted. The same method is used to obtain the\nhyperfine structures of the three-electron ${}^{7}$Be$^{+}$ and\n${}^{9}$Be$^{+}$ ions in their ground $2^{2}S-$states. Finally, we conclude\nthat our approach can be generalized to describe the hyperfine structure in the\ntriplet $n{}^{3}S-$states of the four-electron atoms and ions.\n", "  Turbulent friction in convective regions in stars and planets is one of the\nkey physical mechanisms that drive the dissipation of the kinetic energy of\ntidal flows in their interiors and the evolution of their systems. This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation.\n", "  In a recent paper in EPJC March 2016, Faria has shown that quantum massive\nconformal gravity is renormalizable but has ghost states. We comment this paper\non the aspect of renormalizability.\n", "  In order to holographically model quenches with a gapped final hamiltonian,\nwe consider a gravity-scalar theory in anti-de Sitter space with an infrared\nhard wall. We allow a time dependent profile for the scalar field at the wall.\nThis induces an energy exchange between bulk and wall and generates an\noscillating scalar pulse. We argue that such backgrounds are the counterpart of\nquantum revivals in the dual field theory. We perform a qualitative comparison\nwith the quench dynamics of the massive Schwinger model, which has been\nrecently analyzed using tensor network techniques. Agreement is found provided\nthe width of the oscillating scalar pulse is inversely linked to the energy\ndensity communicated by the quench. We propose this to be a general feature of\nholographic quenches.\n", "  We introduce and discuss a hybrid quantum-mechanics molecular-mechanics\n(QM-MM) approach for Car-Parrinello DFT simulations with pseudopotentials and\nplanewaves basis, designed for the treatment of periodic systems. In this\nimplementation the MM atoms are considered as additional QM ions having\nfractional charges of either sign, which provides conceptual and computational\nsimplicity by exploiting the machinery already existing in planewave codes to\ndeal with electrostatics in periodic boundary conditions. With this strategy,\nboth the QM and MM regions are contained in the same supercell, which\ndetermines the periodicity for the whole system. Thus, while this method is not\nmeant to compete with non-periodic QM-MM schemes able to handle extremely large\nbut finite MM regions, it is shown that for periodic systems of a few hundred\natoms, our approach provides substantial savings in computational times by\ntreating classically a fraction of the particles. The performance and accuracy\nof the method is assessed through the study of energetic, structural, and\ndynamical aspects of the water dimer and of the aqueous bulk phase. Finally,\nthe QM-MM scheme is applied to the computation of the vibrational spectra of\nwater layers adsorbed at the TiO$_2$ anatase (101) solid-liquid interface. This\ninvestigation suggests that the inclusion of a second monolayer of H$_2$O\nmolecules is sufficient to induce on the first adsorbed layer, a vibrational\ndynamics similar to that taking place in the presence of an aqueous\nenvironment. The present QM-MM scheme appears as a very interesting tool to\nefficiently perform molecular dynamics simulations of complex condensed matter\nsystems, from solutions to nanoconfined fluids to different kind of interfaces.\n", "  We perform a general computation of the off-shell one-loop divergences in\nEinstein gravity, in a two-parameter family of path integral measures,\ncorresponding to different ways of parametrizing the graviton field, and a\ntwo-parameter family of gauges. Trying to reduce the gauge- and\nmeasure-dependence selects certain classes of measures and gauges respectively.\nThere is a choice of two parameters (corresponding to the exponential\nparametrization and the partial gauge condition that the quantum field be\ntraceless) that automatically eliminates the dependence on the remaining two\nparameters and on the cosmological constant. We observe that the divergences\nare invariant under a $\\mathbf{Z}_2$ \"duality\" transformation that (in a\nparticularly important special case) involves the replacement of the densitized\nmetric by a densitized inverse metric as the fundamental quantum variable. This\nsingles out a formulation of unimodular gravity as the unique \"self-dual\"\ntheory in this class.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of the discrete BFKL spectrum, which appears\nin the gluon Green function when the running coupling is considered, to a lower\ncut-off in the relative rapidities of the emitted particles. We find that the\neigenvalues associated to each of the discrete eigenfunctions decrease with the\nsize of the rapidity veto. The effect is stronger on the lowest eigenfunctions.\nThe net result is a reduction of the growth with energy for the Green function\ntogether with a suppression in the regions with small transverse momentum.\n", "  We present new Chandra X-ray observations of seven low-mass black holes (~1e6\nMsun) accreting at low Eddington ratios between -2.0<log L/Ledd<-1.5. We\ncompare the X-ray properties of these seven low-mass active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) to a total of 73 other low-mass AGN in the literature with published\nChandra observations (with Eddington ratios extending from -2.0<log\nL/Ledd<-0.1). We do not find any statistical differences between low- and\nhigh-Eddington ratio low-mass AGN in the distributions of their X-ray to\nultraviolet luminosity ratios (aox), or in their X-ray spectral shapes.\nFurthermore, the aox distribution of low-L/Ledd AGN displays an X-ray weak tail\nthat is also observed within high-L/Ledd objects. Our results indicate that\nbetween -2<log L/Ledd<-0.1, there is no systematic change in the structure of\nthe accretion flow for active galaxies hosting 1e6 Msun black holes. We examine\nthe accuracy of current bolometric luminosity estimates for our low-L/Ledd\nobjects with new Chandra observations, and it is plausible that their Eddington\nratios could be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude. If so, then in\nanalogy with weak emission line quasars, we suggest that accretion from a\ngeometrically thick, radiatively inefficient `slim disk' could explain their\ndiverse properties in aox. Alternatively, if current Eddington ratios are in\nfact correct (or overestimated), then the X-ray weak tail would imply that\nthere is diversity in disk/corona couplings among individual low-mass objects.\nFinally, we conclude by noting that the aox distribution for low-mass black\nholes may have favorable consequences for the epoch of cosmic reionization\nbeing driven by AGN.\n", "  We determine the Killing superalgebras underpinning field theories with rigid\nunextended supersymmetry on Lorentzian four-manifolds by re-interpreting them\nas filtered deformations of $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded subalgebras with maximum odd\ndimension of the $N{=}1$ Poincar\\'e superalgebra in four dimensions. Part of\nthis calculation involves computing a Spencer cohomology group which, by\nanalogy with a similar result in eleven dimensions, prescribes a notion of\nKilling spinor, which we identify with the defining condition for bosonic\nsupersymmetric backgrounds of minimal off-shell supergravity in four\ndimensions. We prove that such Killing spinors always generate a Lie\nsuperalgebra, and that this Lie superalgebra is a filtered deformation of a\nsubalgebra of the $N{=}1$ Poincar\\'e superalgebra in four dimensions. Demanding\nthe flatness of the connection defining the Killing spinors, we obtain\nequations satisfied by the maximally supersymmetric backgrounds. We solve these\nequations, arriving at the classification of maximally supersymmetric\nbackgrounds whose associated Killing superalgebras are precisely the filtered\ndeformations we classify in this paper.\n", "  We present an analysis of a new detached eclipsing binary,\nOGLE-LMC-ECL-25658, in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The system consists of two\nlate G-type giant stars on an eccentric orbit and orbital period of ~200 days.\nThe system shows total eclipses and the components have similar temperatures,\nmaking it ideal for a precise distance determination. Using multi-color\nphotometric and high resolution spectroscopic data, we have performed an\nanalysis of light and radial velocity curves simultaneously using the Wilson\nDevinney code. We derived orbital and physical parameters of the binary with a\nhigh precision of < 1 %. The masses and surface metallicities of the components\nare virtually the same and equal to 2.23 +/- 0.02 M_sun and [Fe/H] = -0.63 +/-\n0.10 dex. However their radii and rates of rotation show a distinct trace of\ndifferential stellar evolution. The distance to the system was calculated using\nan infrared calibration between V-band surface brightness and (V-K) color,\nleading to a distance modulus of (m-M) = 18.452 +/- 0.023 (statistical) +/-\n0.046 (systematic). Because OGLE-LMC-ECL-25658 is located relatively far from\nthe LMC barycenter we applied a geometrical correction for its position in the\nLMC disc using the van der Marel et al. model of the LMC. The resulting\nbarycenter distance to the galaxy is d_LMC = 50.30 +/- 0.53 (stat.) kpc, and is\nin perfect agreement with the earlier result of Pietrzynski et al.(2013).\n", "  A variational approach has been recently employed to determine the ideal\ntime-dependent injection rate Q(t) that minimizes fingering formation when a\nfluid is injected in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with another fluid of much greater\nviscosity. However, such a calculation is approximate in nature, since it has\nbeen performed by assuming a high capillary number regime. In this work, we go\none step further, and utilize a Hamiltonian formulation to obtain an analytical\nexact solution for Q(t), now valid for arbitrary values of the capillary\nnumber. Moreover, this Hamiltonian scheme is applied to calculate the\ncorresponding injection rate that minimizes fingering formation in a uniform\nthree-dimensional porous media. An analysis of the improvement offered by these\nexact injection rate expressions in comparison with previous approximate\nresults is also provided.\n", "  Solar tornadoes are dark vertical filamentary structures observed in the\nextreme ultraviolet associated with prominence legs and filament barbs. Their\ntrue nature and relationship to prominences requires understanding their\nmagnetic structure and dynamic properties. Recently, a controversy has arisen:\nis the magnetic field organized forming vertical, helical structures or is it\ndominantly horizontal? And concerning their dynamics, are tornadoes really\nrotating or is it just a visual illusion? Here, we analyze four consecutive\nspectropolarimetric scans of a prominence hosting tornadoes on its legs which\nhelp us shed some light on their magnetic and dynamical properties. We show\nthat the magnetic field is very smooth in all the prominence, probably an\nintrinsic property of the coronal field. The prominence legs have vertical\nhelical fields that show slow temporal variation probably related to the motion\nof the fibrils. Concerning the dynamics, we argue that 1) if rotation exists,\nit is intermittent, lasting no more than one hour, and 2) the observed velocity\npattern is also consistent with an oscillatory velocity pattern (waves).\n", "  Neutral Hydrogen (HI) provides a very important fuel for star formation, but\nis difficult to detect at high redshift due to weak emission, limited\nsensitivity of modern instruments, and terrestrial radio frequency interference\n(RFI) at low frequencies. We the first attempt to use gravitational lensing to\ndetect HI line emission from three gravitationally lensed galaxies behind the\ncluster Abell 773, two at redshift of 0.398 and one at z=0.487, using the Green\nBank Telescope. We find a 3 sigma upper limit for a galaxy with a rotation\nvelocity of 200 km/s is M_HI=6.58x10^9 and 1.5x10^10 M_solar at z=0.398 and\nz=0.487. The estimated HI masses of the sources at z=0.398 and z=0.487 are a\nfactor of 3.7 and ~30 times lower than our detection limits at the respective\nredshifts. To facilitate these observations we have used sigma clipping to\nremove both narrow- and wide-band RFI but retain the signal from the source. We\nare able to reduce the noise of the spectrum by ~25% using our routine instead\nof discarding observations with too much RFI. The routine is most effective\nwhen ~10 of the integrations or fewer contains RFI. These techniques can be\nused to study HI in highly magnified distant galaxies that are otherwise too\nfaint to detect.\n", "  We test a new technique of studying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence\nsuggested by Lazarian \\& Pogosyan, using synthetic synchrotron polarization\nobservations. This paper focuses on a one-point statistics, which is termed the\npolarization frequency analysis, that is characterized by the variance of\npolarized emission as a function of the square of wavelengths along a single\nline of sight. We adopt a ratio $\\eta$ of the standard deviation of the\nline-of-sight turbulent magnetic field to the line-of-sight mean magnetic field\nto depict the level of turbulence. When this ratio is either large\n($\\eta\\gg1$), which characterizes a turbulent field dominated region, or small\n($\\eta\\lesssim0.2$), which characterizes a mean field dominated region, we\nobtain the polarization variance $\\left<P^2\\right>\\propto\\lambda^{-2}$ and\n$\\left<P^2\\right>\\propto\\lambda^{-2-2m}$, respectively. At small $\\eta$, i.e.,\nthe mean field dominated region, we successfully recover the turbulent spectral\nindex by the polarization variance. We find that our simulations agree well\nwith the theoretical prediction of Lazarian \\& Pogosyan. With existing and\nupcoming data cubes from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio astronomy (LOFAR)\nand Square Kilometer Array (SKA), this new technique can be applied to study\nthe magnetic turbulence in the Milky Way and other galaxies.\n", "  How long does a uniformly accelerated observer need to interact with a\nquantum field in order to record thermality in the Unruh temperature? We\naddress this question for a pointlike Unruh-DeWitt detector, coupled linearly\nto a real Klein-Gordon field of mass $m\\ge0$ and treated within first order\nperturbation theory, in the limit of large detector energy gap\n$E_{\\text{gap}}$. We first show that when the interaction duration $\\Delta T$\nis fixed, thermality in the sense of detailed balance cannot hold as\n$E_{\\text{gap}}\\to\\infty$, and this property generalises from the Unruh effect\nto any Kubo-Martin-Schwinger state satisfying certain technical conditions. We\nthen specialise to a massless field in four spacetime dimensions and show that\ndetailed balance does hold when $\\Delta T$ grows as a power-law in\n$E_{\\text{gap}}$ as $E_{\\text{gap}}\\to\\infty$, provided the switch-on and\nswitch-off intervals are stretched proportionally to $\\Delta T$ and the\nswitching function has sufficiently strong Fourier decay. By contrast, if\n$\\Delta T$ grows by stretching a plateau in which the interaction remains at\nconstant strength but keeping the duration of the switch-on and switch-off\nintervals fixed, detailed balance at $E_{\\text{gap}}\\to\\infty$ requires $\\Delta\nT$ to grow faster than any polynomial in $E_{\\text{gap}}$, under mild technical\nconditions. These results also hold for a static detector in a Minkowski heat\nbath.\n  The results limit the utility of the large $E_{\\text{gap}}$ regime as a probe\nof thermality in time-dependent versions of the Hawking and Unruh effects, such\nas an observer falling into a radiating black hole. They may also have\nimplications on the design of prospective experimental tests of the Unruh\neffect.\n", "  Observations of the emission at radio, millimeter, sub-millimeter, and\ninfrared wavelengths in the center of the solar disk validate the\nauto-consistence of semi-empirical models of the chromosphere. Theoretically,\nthese models must reproduce the emission at the solar limb. In this work, we\ntested both the VALC and the C7 semi-empirical models by computing their\nemission spectrum in the frequency range from 2 GHz to 10 THz, at solar limb\naltitudes. We calculate the Sun's theoretical radii as well as their limb\nbrightening. Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) was computed for\nhydrogen, electron density, and H-. In order to solve the radiative transfer\nequation a 3D geometry was employed to determine the ray paths and\nBremsstrahlung, H-, and inverse Bremsstrahlung opacity sources were integrated\nin the optical depth. We compared the computed solar radii with high resolution\nobservations at the limb obtained by Clark (1994). We found that there are\ndifferences between observed and computed solar radii of 12000 km at 20 GHz,\n5000 km at 100 GHz, and 1000 km at 3 THz for both semi-empirical models. A\ndifference of 8000 km in the solar radii was found comparing our results\nagainst heights obtained from H{\\alpha} observations of spicules-off at the\nsolar limb. We conclude that the solar radii can not be reproduced by VALC and\nC7 semi-empirical models at radio - infrared wavelengths. Therefore, the\nstructures in the high chromosphere provides a better measurement of the solar\nradii and their limb brightening as shown in previous investigations.\n", "  We revisit the estimate of the charm particle contribution to the atmospheric\nneutrino flux that is expected to dominate at high energies because long-lived\nhigh-energy pions and kaons interact in the atmosphere before decaying into\nneutrinos. We focus on the production of forward charm particles which carry a\nlarge fraction of the momentum of the incident proton. In the case of strange\nparticles, such a component is familiar from the abundant production of $K^{+}\n\\Lambda$ pairs. These forward charm particles can dominate the high-energy\natmospheric neutrino flux in underground experiments. Modern collider\nexperiments have no coverage in the very large rapidity region where charm\nforward pair production dominates. Using archival accelerator data as well as\nIceCube measurements of atmospheric electron and muon neutrino fluxes, we\nobtain an upper limit on forward $\\bar{D}^0 \\Lambda_c$ pair production and on\nthe associated flux of high-energy atmospheric neutrinos. We conclude that the\nprompt flux may dominate the much-studied central component and represent a\nsignificant contribution to the TeV atmospheric neutrino flux. Importantly, it\ncannot accommodate the PeV flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, nor the excess\nof events observed by IceCube in the 30--200 TeV energy range indicating either\nstructure in the flux of cosmic accelerators, or a presence of more than one\ncomponent in the cosmic flux observed.\n", "  The combination of spectroscopic stellar metallicities and resolved star\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) has the potential to constrain the entire star\nformation and chemical enrichment history (SFH) of a galaxy better than fitting\nCMDs alone (as is most common in SFH studies using resolved stellar\npopulations). In this paper, two approaches for incorporating external\nmetallicity information into color-magnitude diagram fitting techniques are\npresented. Overall, the joint fitting of metallicity and CMD information can\nincrease the precision on measured age-metallicity relationships and star\nformation rates by ~10% over CMD fitting alone. However, systematics in stellar\nisochrones and mismatches between spectroscopic and photometric metallicity\ndeterminations can reduce the accuracy of the recovered SFHs. I present a\nsimple mitigation of these systematics that can reduce the amplitude of these\nsystematics to the level obtained from CMD fitting alone, while ensuring the\nage-metallicity relationship is consistent with spectroscopic metallicities. As\nis the case in CMD-fitting analysis, improved stellar models and calibrations\nbetween spectroscopic and photometric metallicities are currently the primary\nimpediment to gains in SFH precision from jointly fitting stellar metallicities\nand CMDs.\n", "  We present a new method that allows long-term and large-scale hydrodynamical\nsimulations of migrating planets over a grid-based Eulerian code. This\ntechnique, which consists in a remapping of the disk by tracking the planetary\nmigration, enables runs of migrating planets over a time comparable to the age\nof protoplanetary disks. This method also has the potential to address\nefficiently problems related with migration of multi-planet systems in gaseous\ndisks, and to improve current results of migration of massive planets by\nincluding global viscous evolution as well as detailed studies of the\nco-orbital region during migration. We perform different tests using the public\ncode FARGO3D to validate this method and compare its results with those\nobtained using a classical fixed grid.\n", "  We develop new techniques for estimating the fractional uncertainty (F) in\nthe projected planetary mass (msini) resulting from Keplerian fits to\nradial-velocity (RV) datasets of known Jupiter-class exoplanets. The techniques\ninclude (1) estimating the distribution of msini using Monte Carlo projection,\n(2) detecting and mitigating chimeras, a source of systematic error, and (3)\nestimating the reduction in the uncertainty in msini if hypothetical\nobservations were made in the future. We demonstrate the techniques on a\nrepresentative set of RV exoplanets, known as the Gang of 27, which are\ncandidates for detection and characterization by a future astrometric direct\nimaging (ADI) mission. We estimate the improvements (reductions) in F due to\nadditional, hypothetical RV measurements (RVMs) obtained in the future. We\nencounter and address a source of systematic error, chimeras, which can appear\nwhen multiple types of Keplerian solutions are compatible with a single\ndataset. We find that for n = 10 new, hypothetical RVMs obtained in the last\nplanetary year before 2025, with the same accuracy as the current available\nRVMs, F is reduced by ~18%. From there, each plus-one increase in 2 log n - log\nq , where q is the factor by which RVM measurement uncertainty is reduced,\nfurther reduces F by factor 0.18.\n", "  We predict that magnon motive force can lead to temperature dependent,\nnonlinear chiral damping in both conducting and insulating ferromagnets. We\nestimate that this damping can significantly influence the motion of skyrmions\nand domain walls at finite temperatures. We also find that in systems with low\nGilbert damping moving chiral magnetic textures and resulting magnon motive\nforces can induce large spin and energy currents in the transverse direction.\n", "  We consider possible discretizations for a gauge-fixed Green-Schwarz action\nof Type IIB superstring. We use them for measuring the action, from which we\nextract the cusp anomalous dimension of planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as derived\nfrom AdS/CFT, as well as the mass of the two $AdS$ excitations transverse to\nthe relevant null cusp classical string solution. We perform lattice\nsimulations employing a Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC) algorithm and two\nWilson-like fermion discretizations, one of which preserves the global $SO(6)$\nsymmetry of the model. We compare our results with the expected behavior at\nvarious values of $g=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{4\\pi}$. For both the observables, we\nfind a good agreement for large $g$, which is the perturbative regime of the\nsigma-model. For smaller values of $g$, the expectation value of the action\nexhibits a deviation compatible with the presence of quadratic divergences.\nAfter their non-perturbative subtraction the continuum limit can be taken, and\nsuggests a qualitative agreement with the non-perturbative expectation from\nAdS/CFT. Furthermore, we detect a phase in the fermion determinant, whose\norigin we explain, that for very small $g$ leads to a sign problem not\ntreatable via standard reweigthing. The continuum extrapolations of the\nobservables in the two different discretizations agree within errors, which is\nstrongly suggesting that they lead to the same continuum limit. Part of the\nresults discussed here were presented earlier in arXiv:1601.04670.\n", "  Temporal variability of narrow absorption lines in high-resolution spectra of\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is studied to search for circumstellar matter. Time\nseries which resolve the profiles of absorption lines such as Na I D or Ca II\nH&K are expected to reveal variations due to photoionisation and subsequent\nrecombination of the gases. The presence, composition, and geometry of\ncircumstellar matter may hint at the elusive progenitor system of SNe Ia and\ncould also affect the observed reddening law. To date, there are few known\ncases of time-varying Na I D absorption in SNe Ia, all of which occurred during\nrelatively late phases of the supernova evolution. Photoionisation, however, is\npredicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks\nin the ultraviolet. We therefore attempt to observe early-time absorption-line\nvariations by obtaining high-resolution spectra of SNe before maximum light. We\nhave obtained photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of SNe Ia 2013gh and\niPTF 13dge, to search for absorption- line variations. Furthermore, we study\ninterstellar absorption features in relation to the observed photometric\ncolours of the SNe. Results. Both SNe display deep Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption features. Furthermore, small but significant variations are detected\nin a feature of the Na I D profile of SN 2013gh. The variations are consistent\nwith either geometric effects of rapidly moving or patchy gas clouds or\nphotoionisation of Na I gas at R \\approx 1019 cm from the explosion. Our\nanalysis indicates that it is necessary to focus on early phases to detect\nphotoionisation effects of gases in the circumstellar medium of SNe Ia.\nDifferent absorbers such as Na I and Ca II can be used to probe for matter at\ndifferent distances from the SNe.\n", "  An important question in extragalactic astronomy concerns the distribution of\nblack hole accretion rates of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Based on\nobservations at X-ray wavelengths, the observed Eddington ratio distribution\nappears as a power law, while optical studies have often yielded a lognormal\ndistribution. There is increasing evidence that these observed discrepancies\nmay be due to contamination by star formation and other selection effects.\nUsing a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we\ntest if an intrinsic Eddington ratio distribution that takes the form of a\nSchechter function is consistent with previous work that suggests that young\ngalaxies in optical surveys have an observed lognormal Eddington ratio\ndistribution. We simulate the optical emission line properties of a population\nof galaxies and AGN using a broad instantaneous luminosity distribution\ndescribed by a Schechter function near the Eddington limit. This simulated AGN\npopulation is then compared to observed galaxies via the positions on an\nemission line excitation diagram and Eddington ratio distributions. We present\nan improved method for extracting the AGN distribution using BPT diagnostics\nthat allows us to probe over one order of magnitude lower in Eddington ratio\ncounteracting the effects of dilution by star formation. We conclude that for\noptically selected AGN in young galaxies, the intrinsic Eddington ratio\ndistribution is consistent with a possibly universal, broad power law with an\nexponential cutoff, as this distribution is observed in old optically selected\ngalaxies and in X-rays.\n", "  We present observations of interactions between the two filament channels of\ndifferent chiralities and associated dynamics that occurred during 2014 April\n18 -- 20. While two flux ropes of different helicity with parallel axial\nmagnetic fields can only undergo a bounce interaction when they are brought\ntogether, the observations at the first glance show that the heated plasma is\nmoving from one filament channel to the other. The SDO/AIA 171 A observations\nand the PFSS magnetic field extrapolation reveal the presence of fan-spine\nmagnetic configuration over the filament channels with a null point located\nabove them. Three different events of filament activations, partial eruptions,\nand associated filament channel interactions have been observed. The activation\ninitiated in one filament channel seems to propagate along the neighbour\nfilament channel. We believe that the activation and partial eruption of the\nfilaments bring the field lines of flux ropes containing them closer to the\nnull point and trigger the magnetic reconnection between them and the fan-spine\nmagnetic configuration. As a result, the hot plasma moves along the outer spine\nline toward the remote point. Utilizing the present observations, for the first\ntime we have discussed how two different-chirality filament channels can\ninteract and show interrelation.\n", "  Many galaxies contain magnetic fields supported by galactic dynamo action.\nHowever, nothing definitive is known about magnetic fields in ring galaxies.\nHere we investigate large-scale magnetic fields in a previously unexplored\ncontext, namely ring galaxies, and concentrate our efforts on the structures\nthat appear most promising for galactic dynamo action, i.e. outer star-forming\nrings in visually unbarred galaxies. We use tested methods for modelling\n$\\alpha-\\Omega$ galactic dynamos, taking into account the available\nobservational information concerning ionized interstellar matter in ring\ngalaxies. Our main result is that dynamo drivers in ring galaxies are strong\nenough to excite large-scale magnetic fields in the ring galaxies studied. The\nvariety of dynamo driven magnetic configurations in ring galaxies obtained in\nour modelling is much richer than that found in classical spiral galaxies. In\nparticular, various long-lived transients are possible. An especially\ninteresting case is that of NGC 4513 where the ring counter-rotates with\nrespect to the disc. Strong shear in the region between the disc and the ring\nis associated with unusually strong dynamo drivers for the counter-rotators.\nThe effect of the strong drivers is found to be unexpectedly moderate. With\ncounter-rotation in the disc, a generic model shows that a steady mixed parity\nmagnetic configuration, unknown for classical spiral galaxies, may be excited,\nalthough we do not specifically model NGC 4513. We deduce that ring galaxies\nconstitute a morphological class of galaxies in which identification of\nlarge-scale magnetic fields from observations of polarized radio emission, as\nwell as dynamo modelling, may be possible. Such studies have the potential to\nthrow additional light on the physical nature of rings, their lifetimes and\nevolution.\n", "  We report on a theoretical study of the lifetime of the first excited state\nof spin chains made of an odd number of Fe atoms on Cu2N/Cu(100). Yan et al\n(Nat. Nanotech. 10, 40 (2015)) recently observed very long lifetimes in the\ncase of Fe3 chains. We consider the decay of the first excited state induced by\nelectron-hole pair creation in the substrate. For a finite magnetic field, the\ntwo lowest-lying states in the chain have a quasi-N\\'eel state structure. Decay\nfrom one state to the other strongly depends on the degree of entanglement of\nthe local spins in the chain. The entanglement in the chain accounts for the\nlong lifetimes that increase exponentially with chain length. Despite their\napparently very different properties, the behaviour of odd and even chains is\ngoverned by the same kind of phenomena, in particular entanglement effects. The\npresent results account quite well for the lifetimes recently measured by Yan\net al on Fe3\n", "  The origin and depletion of iron differ from all other abundant refractory\nelements that make up the composition of the interstellar dust. Iron is\nprimarily synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and in core collapse\nsupernovae (CCSN), and is present in the outflows from AGB stars. Only the\nlatter two are observed to be sources of interstellar dust, since searches for\ndust in SN~Ia have provided strong evidence for the absence of any significant\nmass of dust in their ejecta. Consequently, more than 65% of the iron is\ninjected into the ISM in gaseous form. Yet, ultraviolet and X-ray observations\nalong many lines of sight in the ISM show that iron is severely depleted in the\ngas phase compared to expected solar abundances. The missing iron, comprising\nabout 90% of the total, is believed to be locked up in interstellar dust. This\nsuggests that most of the missing iron must have precipitated from the ISM gas\nby cold accretion onto preexisting silicate, carbon, or composite grains. Iron\nis thus the only element that requires most of its growth to occur outside the\ntraditional stellar condensation sources. This is a robust statement that does\nnot depend on our evolving understanding of the dust destruction efficiency in\nthe ISM. Reconciling the physical, optical, and chemical properties of such\ncomposite grains with their many observational manifestations is a major\nchallenge for understanding the nature and origin of interstellar dust.\n", "  A new kind of three-dimensional carbon allotropes, termed carbon honeycomb\n(CHC), has recently been synthesized [PRL 116, 055501 (2016)]. Based on the\nexperimental results, a family of graphene networks are constructed, and their\nelectronic and phonon properties are calculated by using first principles\nmethods. All networks are porous metal with two types of electron transport\nchannels along the honeycomb axis and they are isolated from each other: one\ntype of channels is originated from the orbital interactions of the carbon\nzigzag chains and is topologically protected, while the other type of channels\nis from the straight lines of the carbon atoms that link the zigzag chains and\nis topologically trivial. The velocity of the electrons can reach ~10^6 m/s.\nPhonon transport in these allotropes is strongly anisotropic, and the thermal\nconductivities can be very low when compared with graphite by at least a factor\nof 15. Our calculations further indicate that these porous carbon networks\npossess high storage capacity for gaseous atoms and molecules in agreement with\nexperiment.\n", "  We discuss the resummation of the Goldstone boson contributions to the\neffective potential of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). This\neliminates the formal problems of spurious imaginary parts and logarithmic\nsingularities in the minimization conditions when the tree-level Goldstone\nboson squared masses are negative or approach zero. The numerical impact of the\nresummation is shown to be almost always very small. We also show how to write\nthe two-loop minimization conditions so that Goldstone boson squared masses do\nnot appear at all, and so that they can be solved without iteration.\n", "  We present a novel mathematical formalism that allows to easily compute the\nexpected kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) signal in intensity and polarization\ndue to an anisotropic primordial Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We derive\nthe expected intensity and polarization distortions in the direction of\nnon-moving galaxy clusters and then we generalize our calculations for non-zero\npeculiar velocity. We show that, in the direction of moving clusters, low CMB\nmultipoles impose intensity and polarization spectral distortions with\ndifferent frequency dependences. The polarization signal primarily probes the\nquadrupole moment of the CMB, with a significant contribution from the\nprimordial dipole and octupole moments. For a typical cluster velocity of 1000\nkm/s, corrections to the quadrupole-induced polarization of a non-moving\ncluster are of the order of 2-10% between 200-600 GHz, and depend on cluster's\nposition on the sky, velocity magnitude and direction of motion. We also find\nthat the angular dependence of the signal varies with frequency of observation.\nThe distinct frequency and angular dependences of the polarization induced by\nthe primordial dipole and octupole can be exploited to measure them despite\nother physical effects and foregrounds. Contrary to polarization, intensity\ndistortions are affected by all the CMB multipoles, so they cannot be readily\nused to probe the low multipoles at higher redshifts. However, correlations\nbetween intensity and polarization signals, can be used to enhance the signal\nto noise ratio for the measurements of the primordial dipole, quadrupole and\noctupole. The more general calculation of the aberration kernel presented in\nthis work has applications reaching beyond the SZ cluster science addressed\nhere. For example, it can be exploited to the deboost/deaberrate CMB multipoles\nas observed in our local frame.\n", "  We use time-sliced perturbation theory (TSPT) to give an accurate description\nof the infrared non-linear effects affecting the baryonic acoustic oscillations\n(BAO) present in the distribution of matter at very large scales. In TSPT this\ncan be done via a systematic resummation that has a simple diagrammatic\nrepresentation and does not involve uncontrollable approximations. We discuss\nthe power counting rules and derive explicit expressions for the resummed\nmatter power spectrum up to next-to leading order and the bispectrum at the\nleading order. The two-point correlation function agrees well with N-body data\nat BAO scales. The systematic approach also allows to reliably assess the shift\nof the baryon acoustic peak due to non-linear effects.\n", "  We estimate spatial gradients in the ionosphere using the Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) and GLONASS (Russian global navigation system) observations,\nutilising data from multiple GPS stations in the vicinity of Murchison\nRadio-astronomy Observatory (MRO). In previous work the ionosphere was\ncharacterised using a single-station to model the ionosphere as a single layer\nof fixed height and this was compared with ionospheric data derived from radio\nastronomy observations obtained from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\nHaving made improvements to our data quality (via cycle slip detection and\nrepair) and incorporating data from the GLONASS system, we now present a\nmulti-station approach. These two developments significantly improve our\nmodelling of the ionosphere. We also explore the effects of a variable-height\nmodel. We conclude that modelling the small-scale features in the ionosphere\nthat have been observed with the MWA will require a much denser network of\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations than is currently available\nat the MRO.\n", "  We present $Spitzer$/IRAC Ch1 and Ch2 monitoring of six brown dwarfs during 8\ndifferent epochs over the course of 20 months. For four brown dwarfs, we also\nobtained simulataneous $HST$/WFC3 G141 Grism spectra during two epochs and\nderived light curves in five narrow-band filters. Probing different pressure\nlevels in the atmospheres, the multi-wavelength light curves of our six targets\nall exhibit variations, and the shape of the light curves evolves over the\ntimescale of a rotation period, ranging from 1.4 h to 13 h. We compare the\nshapes of the light curves and estimate the phase shifts between the light\ncurves observed at different wavelengths by comparing the phase of the primary\nFourier components. We use state-of-the-art atmosphere models to determine the\nflux contribution of different pressure layers to the observed flux in each\nfilter. We find that the light curves that probe higher pressures are similar\nand in phase, but are offset and often different from the light curves that\nprobe lower pressures. The phase differences between the two groups of light\ncurves suggest that the modulations seen at lower and higher pressures may be\nintroduced by different cloud layers.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate a simple class of Horndeski models where the\nscalar field plays the role of a k-essence fluid. We present several solutions\nfor early-time universe, namely inflation and cosmological bounce, by making\nuse of some reconstruction technique. Moreover, we furnish the formalism to\ncalculate perturbations in FRW space-time and we compute the spectral index and\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio during inflation.\n", "  We study the propagation of different types of correlations through a quantum\nbus formed by a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators. This includes steering,\nentanglement, mutual information, quantum discord, and Bell-like nonlocality.\nThe whole system consists of the quantum bus (propagation medium) and other\nquantum harmonic oscillators (sources and receivers of quantum correlations)\nweakly coupled to the chain. We are particularly interested in using the point\nof view of transport to spot distinctive features displayed by different kinds\nof correlations. We found, for instance, that there are fundamental differences\nin the way steering and discord propagate, depending on the way they are\ndefined with respect to the parties involved in the initial correlated state.\nWe analyzed both the closed- and open-system dynamics as well as the role\nplayed by thermal excitations in the propagation of the correlations.\n", "  We carried out deep optical observations of the middle-aged $\\gamma$-ray\npulsar PSR J1741-2054 with the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We identified two\nobjects, of magnitudes $m_v=23.10\\pm0.05$ and $m_v=25.32\\pm0.08$, at positions\nconsistent with the very accurate Chandra coordinates of the pulsar, the\nfaintest of which is more likely to be its counterpart. From the VLT images we\nalso detected the known bow-shock nebula around PSR J1741-2054. The nebula is\ndisplaced by $\\sim 0\\farcs9$ (at the $3\\sigma$ confidence level) with respect\nto its position measured in archival data, showing that the shock propagates in\nthe interstellar medium consistently with the pulsar proper motion. Finally, we\ncould not find evidence of large-scale extended optical emission associated\nwith the pulsar wind nebula detected by Chandra, down to a surface brightness\nlimit of $\\sim 28.1$ magnitudes arcsec$^{-2}$. Future observations are needed\nto confirm the optical identification of PSR J1741-2054 and characterise the\nspectrum of its counterpart.\n", "  By adopting the empirical constraints related to the estimates of Helium\nenhancement ($\\Delta Y$), present mass ratio between first and second stellar\ngenerations ($M_{1G}/M_{2G}$) and the actual mass of Galactic globular clusters\n($M_{GC}$), we envisage a possible scenario for the formation of these stellar\nsystems. Our approach allows for the possible loss of stars through evaporation\nor tidal interactions and different star formation efficiencies. In our\napproach the star formation efficiency of the first generation\n($\\epsilon_{1G}$) is the central factor that links the stellar generations as\nit not only defines both the mass in stars of the first generation and the\nremaining mass available for further star formation, but it also fixes the\namount of matter required to contaminate the second stellar generation. In this\nway, $\\epsilon_{1G}$ is fully defined by the He enhancement between successive\ngenerations in a GC. We also show that globular clusters fit well within a\n$\\Delta Y$ {\\it vs} $M_{1G}/M_{2G}$ diagram which indicates three different\nevolutionary paths. The central one is for clusters that have not loss stars,\nthrough tidal interactions, from either of their stellar generations, and thus\ntheir present $M_{GC}$ value is identical to the amount of low mass stars ($M_*\n\\le$ 1 M$_\\odot$) that resulted from both stellar generations. Other possible\nevolutions imply either the loss of first generation stars or the combination\nof a low star formation efficiency in the second stellar generation and/or a\nloss of stars from the second generation. From these considerations we derive a\nlower limit to the mass ($M_{tot}$) of the individual primordial clouds that\ngave origin to globular clusters.\n", "  We shortly review different methods to obtain the scattering solutions of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation in Minkowski space. We emphasize the possibility to\nobtain the zero energy observables in terms of the Euclidean scattering\namplitude.\n", "  The tadpole galaxy Kiso 5639 has a slowly rotating disk with a drop in\nmetallicity at its star-forming head, suggesting that star formation was\ntriggered by the accretion of metal-poor gas. We present multi-wavelength HST\nWFC3 images of UV through I band plus Halpha to search for peripheral emission\nand determine the properties of various regions. The head has a mass in young\nstars of ~10^6 Mo and an ionization rate of 6.4x10^51 s^{-1}, equivalent to\n~2100 O9-type stars. There are four older star-forming regions in the tail, and\nan underlying disk with a photometric age of ~1 Gyr. The mass distribution\nfunction of 61 star clusters is a power law with a slope of -1.73+-0.51.\nFourteen young clusters in the head are more massive than 10^4 Mo, suggesting a\nclustering fraction of 30%-45%. Wispy filaments of Halpha emission and young\nstars extend away from the galaxy. Shells and holes in the head HII region\ncould be from winds and supernovae. Gravity from the disk should limit the\nexpansion of the HII region, although hot gas might escape through the holes.\nThe star formation surface density determined from Halpha in the head is\ncompared to that expected from likely pre-existing and accreted gas. Unless the\nsurface density of the accreted gas is a factor of ~3 or more larger than what\nwas in the galaxy before, the star formation rate has to exceed the usual\nKennicutt-Schmidt rate by a factor of >5.\n", "  It is possible that the electroweak scale is low due to the fine-tuning of\nmicroscopic parameters, which can result from selection effects. The\nexperimental discovery of new light fundamental scalars other than the Standard\nModel Higgs boson would seem to disfavor this possibility, since generically\nsuch states imply parametrically worse fine-tuning with no compelling\nconnection to selection effects. We discuss counterexamples where the Higgs\nboson is light because of fine-tuning, and a second scalar doublet is light\nbecause a discrete symmetry relates its mass to the mass of the Standard Model\nHiggs boson. Our examples require new vectorlike fermions at the electroweak\nscale, and the models possess a rich electroweak vacuum structure. The\nmechanism that we discuss does not protect a small CP-odd Higgs mass in split\nor high-scale supersymmetry-breaking scenarios of the MSSM due to an\nincompatibility between the discrete symmetries and holomorphy.\n", "  The electron-proton collisions collected by the H1 and ZEUS experiments at\nHERA comprise a unique particle physics data set, and a comprehensive range of\nmeasurements has been performed to provide new insight into the structure of\nthe proton. The high centre of mass energy at HERA has also allowed rare\nprocesses to be studied, including the production of W and Z bosons and events\nwith multiple leptons in the final state. The data have also opened up a new\ndomain to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model including contact\ninteractions, leptoquarks, excited fermions and a number of supersymmetric\nmodels. This review presents a summary of such results, where the analyses\nreported correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 1 fb^-1, representing\nthe complete data set recorded by the H1 and ZEUS experiments.\n", "  Located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), SXP214 is an X-ray pulsar in a\nhigh mass X-ray binary system with a Be-star companion. A recent survey of the\nSMC under a Chandra X-ray Visionary program found the source in a transition\nwhen the X-ray flux was on a steady rise. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram revealed\na pulse period of 211.49 +/- 0.42 s, which is significantly (>5sigma) shorter\nthan the previous measurements with XMM-Newton and RXTE. This implies that the\nsystem has gone through sudden spin-up episodes recently. The pulse profile\nshows a sharp eclipse-like feature with a modulation amplitude of >95%. The\nlinear rise of the observed X-ray luminosity from <~2x to 7x10^35 erg s^-1 is\ncorrelated with steady softening of the X-ray spectrum, which can be described\nby the changes in the local absorption from N_H ~ 10^24 to <~10^20 cm^-2 for an\nabsorbed power-law model. The soft X-ray emission below 2 keV was absent in the\nearly part of the observation when only the pulsating hard X-ray component was\nobserved, whereas at later times both soft and hard X-ray components were\nobserved pulsating. A likely explanation is that the neutron star was initially\nhidden in the circumstellar disk of the companion, and later came out of the\ndisk with the accreted material that continued fueling the observed pulsation.\n", "  We present the first survey results of hard X-ray point sources in the\nGalactic Center (GC) region by NuSTAR. We have discovered 70 hard (3-79 keV)\nX-ray point sources in a 0.6 deg^2 region around Sgr A* with a total exposure\nof 1.7 Ms, and 7 sources in the Sgr B2 field with 300 ks. We identify clear\nChandra counterparts for 58 NuSTAR sources and assign candidate counterparts\nfor the remaining 19. The NuSTAR survey reaches X-ray luminosities of ~4 x and\n~8 x 10^32 erg s^-1 at the GC (8 kpc) in the 3-10 and 10-40 keV bands,\nrespectively. The source list includes three persistent luminous X-ray binaries\nand the likely run-away pulsar called the Cannonball. New source-detection\nsignificance maps reveal a cluster of hard (>10 keV) X-ray sources near the Sgr\nA diffuse complex with no clear soft X-ray counterparts. The severe extinction\nobserved in the Chandra spectra indicates that all the NuSTAR sources are in\nthe central bulge or are of extragalactic origin. Spectral analysis of\nrelatively bright NuSTAR sources suggests that magnetic cataclysmic variables\nconstitute a large fraction (>40-60%). Both spectral analysis and logN-logS\ndistributions of the NuSTAR sources indicate that the X-ray spectra of the\nNuSTAR sources should have kT > 20 keV on average for a single temperature\nthermal plasma model or an average photon index of Gamma = 1.5 - 2 for a\npower-law model. These findings suggest that the GC X-ray source population may\ncontain a larger fraction of X-ray binaries with high plasma temperatures than\nthe field population.\n", "  The precise connection between the theoretical T, CP, CPT asymmetries, in\nterms of transition probabilities between the filtered neutral meson $B_d$\nstates and the experimental asymmetries between the double decay rate\nintensities for Flavour-CP eigenstate decay products in a B-factory of\nentangled states, is established. This allows the identification of genuine\nAsymmetry Parameters in the time distribution of the asymmetries and their\nmeasurability by disentangling genuine and possible fake terms. We express the\nnine asymmetry parameters -- three different observables for each one of the\nthree symmetries -- in terms of the ingredients of the Weisskopf-Wigner\ndynamical description of the entangled $B_d$-meson states and we obtain a\nglobal fit to their values from the BaBar collaboration experimental results.\nThe possible fake terms are all compatible with zero and the information\ncontent of the nine asymmetry parameters is indeed different. The non-vanishing\n$\\Delta\\mathscr S_c^{\\rm T} =-0.687\\pm 0.020 $ and $\\Delta\\mathscr S_c^{\\rm\nCP}=-0.680\\pm 0.021$ are impressive separate direct evidence of\nTime-Reversal-violation and CP-violation in these transitions and compatible\nwith Standard Model expectations. An intriguing 2$\\sigma$ effect for the\nRe($\\theta$) parameter responsible of CPT-Violation appears which, interpreted\nas an upper limit, leads to $|M_{\\bar B^0\\bar B^0}-M_{B^0B^0}| < 4.0\\times\n10^{-5}$ eV at 95\\% C.L. for the diagonal flavour terms of the mass matrix. It\ncontributes to the CP-violating $\\Delta\\mathscr C_c^{\\rm CP}$ asymmetry\nparameter in an unorthodox manner -- in its $\\cos(\\Delta M\\,t)$ time dependence\n--, and it is accessible in facilities with non-entangled $B_d$'s, like the\nLHCb experiment.\n", "  We analyze high-resolution UV spectra of a small sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars\n(HAEBES) in order to explore the origin of the $T\\sim10^5$ K gas in these\nstars. The C IV 1548,1550 \\AA\\ line luminosities are compared to\nnon--simultaneous accretion rate estimates for the objects showing C IV\nemission. We show that the correlation between $L_{CIV}$ and $\\dot{M}$\npreviously established for classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) seems to extend into\nthe HAEBE mass regime, although the large spread in literature $\\dot{M}$ and\n$A_V$ values makes the actual relationship highly uncertain. With the exception\nof DX Cha, we find no evidence for hot, optically thick winds in our HAEBE\nsample. All other objects showing clear doublet emission in C IV can be well\ndescribed by a two component (i.e., a single component for each doublet member)\nor four component (i.e., two components for each doublet member) Gaussian\nemission line fit. The morphologies and peak-flux velocities of these lines\nsuggest they are formed in weak, optically thin stellar winds and not in an\naccretion flow, as is the case for the hot lines observed in CTTSs. The lack of\nstrong outflow signatures and lack of evidence for line formation in accretion\nflows is consistent with the conclusion presented in our recent optical and He\nI 10830 \\AA\\ studies that the immediate circumstellar environments of HAEBES,\nin general, are not scaled-up analogs of the immediate environments around\nCTTSs. The conclusions presented here for hot gas lines around HAEBES should be\nverified with a larger sample of objects.\n", "  Besides the Higgs particle discovered in 2012, with mass 125 GeV, recent LHC\ndata show tentative signals for new resonances in diboson as well as diphoton\nsearches at high center-of-mass energies (2 TeV and 750 GeV, respectively). If\nthese signals are confirmed (or other new resonances are discovered at the TeV\nscale), the large hierarchies between masses of new bosons require a dynamical\nexplanation. Motivated by these tentative signals of new physics, we\ninvestigate the theoretical possibility that large hierarchies in the masses of\nglueballs could arise dynamically in new strongly-coupled gauge theories\nextending the standard model of particle physics. We study lattice data on\nnon-Abelian gauge theories in the (near-)conformal regime as well as a simple\ntoy model in the context of gauge/gravity dualities. We focus our attention on\nthe ratio $R$ between the mass of the lightest spin-2 and spin-0 resonances,\nthat for technical reasons is a particularly convenient and clean observable to\nstudy. For models in which (non-perturbative) large anomalous dimensions arise\ndynamically, we show indications that this mass ratio can be large, with $R>5$.\nMoreover, our results suggest that $R$ might be related to universal properties\nof the IR fixed point. Our findings provide an interesting step towards\nunderstanding large mass ratios in the non-perturbative regime of quantum field\ntheories with (near) IR conformal behaviour.\n", "  The microquasar GRS~1915+105 is known for its spectacular discrete ejections.\nThey occur unexpectedly, thus their inception escapes direct observation. It\nhas been shown that the X-ray flux increases in the hours leading up to a major\nejection. In this article, we consider the serendipitous interferometric\nmonitoring of a modest version of a discrete ejection described in Reid et al.\n(2014) that would have otherwise escaped detection in daily radio light curves.\nThe observation begins $\\sim 1$ hour after the onset of the ejection, providing\nunprecedented accuracy on the estimate of the ejection time. The astrometric\nmeasurements allow us to determine the time of ejection as $\\rm{MJD}\\,\n56436.274^{+0.016}_{-0.013}$, i.e., within a precision of 41 minutes (95\\%\nconfidence). Just like larger flares, we find that the X-ray luminosity\nincreases in last 2 - 4 hours preceding ejection. Our finite temporal\nresolution indicates that this elevated X-ray flux persists within\n$21.8^{+22.6}_{-19.1}$ minutes of the ejection with 95\\% confidence, the\nhighest temporal precision of the X-ray - superluminal ejection connection to\ndate. This observation provides direct evidence that the physics that launches\nmajor flares occurs on smaller scales as well (lower radio flux and shorter\nejection episodes). The observation of a X-ray spike prior to a discrete\nejection, although of very modest amplitude suggests that the process linking\naccretion behavior to ejection is general from the smallest scales to high\nluminosity major superluminal flares.\n", "  It is shown that General Relativity with negative cosmological constant in\nthree spacetime dimensions admits a new family of boundary conditions being\nlabeled by a nonnegative integer $k$. Gravitational excitations are then\ndescribed by \"boundary gravitons\" that fulfill the equations of the $k$-th\nelement of the KdV hierarchy. In particular, $k=0$ corresponds to the\nBrown-Henneaux boundary conditions so that excitations are described by chiral\nmovers. In the case of $k=1$, the boundary gravitons fulfill the KdV equation\nand the asymptotic symmetry algebra turns out to be infinite-dimensional,\nabelian and devoid of central extensions. The latter feature also holds for the\nremaining cases that describe the hierarchy ($k>1$). Our boundary conditions\nthen provide a gravitational dual of two noninteracting left and right KdV\nmovers, and hence, boundary gravitons possess anisotropic Lifshitz scaling with\ndynamical exponent $z=2k+1$. Remarkably, despite spacetimes solving the field\nequations are locally AdS, they possess anisotropic scaling being induced by\nthe choice of boundary conditions. As an application, the entropy of a rotating\nBTZ black hole is precisely recovered from a suitable generalization of the\nCardy formula that is compatible with the anisotropic scaling of the chiral KdV\nmovers at the boundary, in which the energy of AdS spacetime with our boundary\nconditions depends on $z$ and plays the role of the central charge. The\nextension of our boundary conditions to the case of higher spin gravity and its\nlink with different classes of integrable systems is also briefly addressed.\n", "  We study the impact of random pinning fields on the emergence of synchrony in\nthe Kuramoto model on complete graphs and uncorrelated random complex networks.\nWe consider random fields with uniformly distributed directions and homogeneous\nand heterogeneous (Gaussian) field magnitude distribution. In our analysis we\napply the Ott-Antonsen method and the annealed-network approximation to find\nthe critical behavior of the order parameter. In the case of homogeneous\nfields, we find a tricritical point above which a second-order phase transition\ngives place to a first-order phase transition when the network is either fully\nconnected, or scale-free with the degree exponent $\\gamma>5$. Interestingly,\nfor scale-free networks with $2<\\gamma \\leq 5$, the phase transition is of\nsecond-order at any field magnitude, except for degree distributions with\n$\\gamma=3$ when the transition is of infinite order at $K_c=0$ independently on\nthe random fields. Contrarily to the Ising model, even strong Gaussian random\nfields do not suppress the second-order phase transition in both complete\ngraphs and scale-free networks though the fields increase the critical coupling\nfor $\\gamma > 3$. Our simulations support these analytical results.\n", "  Diquarks are found to have the right degrees of freedom to describe the\ntetraquark poles in hidden-charm to open-charm meson-meson amplitudes. Compact\ntetraquarks result as intermediate states in non-planar diagrams of the 1/N\nexpansion and the corresponding resonances are narrower than what estimated\nbefore. The proximity of tetraquarks to meson-thresholds has an apparent role\nin this analysis and, in the language of meson molecules, an halving rule in\nthe counting of states is obtained.\n", "  We refine our previously introduced parameterized model for explosive\ncarbon-oxygen fusion during thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia) by adding\ncorrections to post-processing of recorded Lagrangian fluid element histories\nto obtain more accurate isotopic yields. Deflagration and detonation products\nare verified for propagation in a uniform density medium. A new method is\nintroduced for reconstructing the temperature-density history within the\nartificially thick model deflagration front. We obtain better than 5\\%\nconsistency between the electron capture computed by the burning model and\nyields from post-processing. For detonations, we compare to a benchmark\ncalculation of the structure of driven steady-state planar detonations\nperformed with a large nuclear reaction network and error-controlled\nintegration. We verify that, for steady-state planar detonations down to a\ndensity of 5x10^6 g/cc, our post processing matches the major abundances in the\nbenchmark solution typically to better than 10% for times greater than 0.01 s\nafter the shock front passage. As a test case to demonstrate the method,\npresented here with post-processing for the first time, we perform a two\ndimensional simulation of a SN Ia in the Chandrasekhar-mass\ndeflagration-detonation transition (DDT) scenario. We find that reconstruction\nof deflagration tracks leads to slightly more complete silicon burning than\nwithout reconstruction. The resulting abundance structure of the ejecta is\nconsistent with inferences from spectroscopic studies of observed SNe Ia. We\nconfirm the absence of a central region of stable Fe-group material for the\nmulti-dimensional DDT scenario. Detailed isotopic yields are tabulated and only\nchange modestly when using deflagration reconstruction.\n", "  We determine the constraints imposed on the 10d target superspace geometry by\nthe requirement of classical kappa-symmetry of the Green-Schwarz superstring.\nIn the type I case we find that the background must satisfy a generalization of\ntype I supergravity equations. These equations depend on an arbitrary vector\nX_a and imply the one-loop scale invariance of the GS sigma model. In the\nspecial case when X_a is the gradient of a scalar \\phi (dilaton) one recovers\nthe standard type I equations equivalent to the 2d Weyl invariance conditions\nof the superstring sigma model. In the type II case we find a generalized\nversion of the 10d supergravity equations the bosonic part of which was\nintroduced in arXiv:1511.05795. These equations depend on two vectors \\X_a and\nK_a subject to 1st order differential relations (with the equations in the\nNS-NS sector depending only on the combination X_a = \\X_a + K_a). In the\nspecial case of K_a=0 one finds that \\X_a=\\d_a \\phi and thus obtains the\nstandard type II supergravity equations. New generalized solutions are found if\nK_a is chosen to be a Killing vector (and thus they exist only if the metric\nadmits an isometry). Non-trivial solutions of the generalized equations\ndescribe K-isometric backgrounds that can be mapped by T-duality to type II\nsupergravity solutions with dilaton containing a linear isometry-breaking term.\nExamples of such backgrounds appeared recently in the context of integrable\n\\eta-deformations of AdS_n x S^n sigma models. The classical kappa-symmetry\nthus does not, in general, imply the 2d Weyl invariance conditions for the GS\nsigma model (equivalent to type II supergravity equations) but only weaker\nscale invariance type conditions.\n", "  Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved.\n", "  The monogamy is a fundamental property of Bell nonlocality and contextuality.\nIn this article, we studied the $n$-cycle noncontextual inequalities and\ngeneralized CHSH inequalities in detail and found the sufficient conditions for\nthose inequalities to be hold. According to those conditions, we provide\nseveral kind of tradeoff relations: monogamy of generalized Bell inequalities\nin non-signaling framework, monogamy of cycle type noncontextual inequalities\nand monogamy between Bell inequality and noncontextual inequality in general\nno-disturbance framework. At last, some generic tradeoff relations of\ngeneralized CHSH inequalities for $n$-party physical systems, which are beyond\none-to-many scenario, are discussed.\n", "  The near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon is an intriguing object: its\nperihelion is at only 0.14 au and is associated with the Geminid meteor stream.\nWe aim to use all available disk-integrated optical data to derive a reliable\nconvex shape model of Phaethon. By interpreting the available space- and\nground-based thermal infrared data and Spitzer spectra using a thermophysical\nmodel, we also aim to further constrain its size, thermal inertia, and visible\ngeometric albedo. We applied the convex inversion method to the new optical\ndata obtained by six instruments and to previous observations. The convex shape\nmodel was then used as input for the thermophysical modeling. We also studied\nthe long-term stability of Phaethon's orbit and spin axis with a numerical\norbital and rotation-state integrator. We present a new convex shape model and\nrotational state of Phaethon: a sidereal rotation period of 3.603958(2) h and\necliptic coordinates of the preferred pole orientation of (319$^{\\circ}$,\n$-$39$^{\\circ}$) with a 5$^{\\circ}$ uncertainty. Moreover, we derive its size\n($D$=5.1$\\pm$0.2 km), thermal inertia ($\\Gamma$=600$\\pm$200 J m$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1/2}$ K$^{-1}$), geometric visible albedo\n($p_{\\mathrm{V}}$=0.122$\\pm$0.008), and estimate the macroscopic surface\nroughness. We also find that the Sun illumination at the perihelion passage\nduring the past several thousand years is not connected to a specific area on\nthe surface, which implies non-preferential heating.\n", "  We present a new, detailed analysis of the morphologies and molecular gas\nfractions for a complete sample of 65 local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)\nfrom the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) using high resolution\n$I$-band images from The Hubble Space Telescope, the University of Hawaii 2.2m\nTelescope and the Pan-STARRS1 Survey. Our classification scheme includes single\nundisturbed galaxies, minor mergers, and major mergers, with the latter divided\ninto five distinct stages from pre-first pericenter passage to final nuclear\ncoalescence. We find that major mergers of molecular gas-rich spirals clearly\nplay a major role for all sources with $L_{\\rm IR} > 10^{11.5} L_\\odot $;\nhowever, below this luminosity threshold, minor mergers and secular processes\ndominate. Additionally, galaxies do not reach $L_{\\rm IR} > 10^{12.0} L_\\odot $\nuntil late in the merger process when both disks are near final coalescence.\nThe mean molecular gas fraction (MGF $= M_{\\rm H_2} / (M_* + M_{\\rm H_2})$) for\nnon-interacting and early-stage major merger LIRGs is 18$\\pm 2$%, which\nincreases to 33$\\pm 3$%, for intermediate stage major merger LIRGs, consistent\nwith the hypothesis that, during the early-mid stages of major mergers, most of\nthe initial large reservoir of atomic gas (HI) at large galactocentric radii is\nswept inward where it is converted into molecular gas (H$_2$).\n", "  We present an experimentally feasible scheme to implement holonomic quantum\ncomputation in the ultrastrong-coupling regime of light-matter interaction. The\nlarge anharmonicity and the Z2 symmetry of the quantum Rabi model allow us to\nbuild an effective three-level {\\Lambda}-structured artificial atom for quantum\ncomputation. The proposed physical implementation includes two gradiometric\nflux qubits and two microwave resonators where single-qubit gates are realized\nby a two-tone driving on one physical qubit, and a two-qubit gate is achieved\nwith a time-dependent coupling between the field quadratures of both\nresonators. Our work paves the way for scalable holonomic quantum computation\nin ultrastrongly coupled systems.\n", "  We present new identifications of five red giant stars in the Galactic halo\nwith chemical abundance patterns that indicate they originally formed in\nglobular clusters. Using data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic\nEvolution Experiment (APOGEE) Survey available through Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release 12 (DR12), we first identify likely halo giants, and then search\nthose for the well-known chemical tags associated with globular clusters,\nspecifically enrichment in nitrogen and aluminum. We find that 2% of the halo\ngiants in our sample have this chemical signature, in agreement with previous\nresults. Following the interpretation in our previous work on this topic, this\nwould imply that at least 13% of halo stars originally formed in globular\nclusters. Recent developments in the theoretical understanding of globular\ncluster formation raise questions about that interpretation, and we concede the\npossibility that these migrants represent a small fraction of the halo field.\nThere are roughly as many stars with the chemical tags of globular clusters in\nthe halo field as there are in globular clusters, whether or not they are\naccompanied by a much larger chemically untaggable population of former\nglobular cluster stars.\n", "  The R&D activity performed during the last years proved the potential of ZnSe\nscintillating bolometers to the search for neutrino-less double beta decay,\nmotivating the realization of the first large-mass experiment based on this\ntechnology: CUPID-0. The isotopic enrichment in $^{82}$Se, the Zn$^{82}$Se\ncrystals growth, as well as the light detectors production have been\naccomplished, and the experiment is now in construction at Laboratori Nazionali\ndel Gran Sasso (Italy). In this paper we present the results obtained testing\nthe first three Zn$^{82}$Se crystals operated as scintillating bolometers, and\nwe prove that their performance in terms of energy resolution, background\nrejection capability and intrinsic radio-purity complies with the requirements\nof CUPID-0.\n", "  Super-chameleon models where all types of matter belong to three secluded\nsectors, i.e. the dark, supersymmetry breaking and matter sectors, are shown to\nbe dynamically equivalent to ultra-local models of modified gravity. In the\ndark sector, comprising both dark matter and dark energy, the interaction range\nbetween the dark energy field and dark matter is constrained to be extremely\nshort, i.e. shorter than the inverse gravitino mass set by supersymmetry\nbreaking. This realises an extreme version of chameleon screening of the dark\nenergy interaction. On the other hand, the baryonic matter sector decouples\nfrom the dark energy in a Damour-Polyakov way. These two mechanisms preclude\nthe existence of any modification of gravity locally in the Solar System due to\nthe presence of the super-chameleon field. On larger scales, the\nsuper-chameleon can have effects on the growth of structure and the number of\ndark matter halos. It can also affect the dynamics of galaxies where the fifth\nforce interaction that it induces can have the same order of magnitude as\nNewton's interaction.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model in both uniform\nlongitudinal ($H$) and transverse ($\\Omega $) magnetic fields by using the\neffective-field theory with finite cluster $N=1$ spin (EFT-1). We analyzed the\nbehavior of the magnetic susceptibility to investigate the reentrant phenomena\nwe have seen the same phase diagram previously obtained in another papers. Our\nresults shows the presence of two divergences in the susceptibility that\nindicates the existence of a reentrant behaviour.\n", "  A search for various double electron capture modes of $^{74}$Se has been\nperformed using an ultralow background Ge-detector in the Felsenkeller\nlaboratory, Germany. Especially for the potentially resonant transition into\nthe 1204.2 keV excited state of $^{74}$Ge a lower half-life limit of $0.70\\cdot\n10^{19}$ yr (90% credibility) has been obtained. Serious concerns are raised\nabout the validity of obtained $^{74}$Se limits in some recent publications.\n", "  We study the influence of the meson cloud of the nucleon on predictions of\nthe Monte Carlo Glauber model for the charged particle multiplicity density at\nmid-rapidity in $AA$ collisions. We find that for central $AA$ collisions the\nmeson cloud can increase the multiplicity density by $\\sim 16-18$\\%. The\nmeson-baryon Fock component reduces the required fraction of the binary\ncollisions by a factor of $\\sim 2$ for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ TeV\nand $\\sim 1.5$ for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV.\n", "  Black holes at the centre of quiescent galaxies can be switched on when they\naccrete gas that is gained from stellar tidal disruptions. A star approaching a\nblack hole on a low angular momentum orbit may be ripped apart by tidal forces,\nwhich triggers raining down of a fraction of stellar debris onto the compact\nobject through an accretion disc and powers a bright flare. In this paper we\ndiscuss XMMSL1J063045.9-603110 as a candidate object for a tidal disruption\nevent. The source has recently been detected to be bright in the soft X-rays\nduring an XMM-Newton slew and later showed an X-ray flux decay by a factor of\nabout 10 in twenty days. We analyse XMM-Newton and Swift data.\nXMMSL1J063045.9-603110 shows several features typical of tidal disruption\nevents: the X-ray spectrum shows the characteristics of a spectrum arising from\na thermal accretion disc, the flux decay follows a t^-5/3 law, and the flux\nvariation is > 350. Optical observations testify that XMMSL1J063045.9-603110 is\nprobably associated with an extremely small galaxy or even a globular cluster,\nwhich suggests that intermediate-mass black holes are located in the cores of\n(at least) some of them.\n", "  Continuing the project described by Kato et al. (2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for 128 SU UMa-type dwarf novae observed\nmainly during the 2015-2016 season and characterized these objects. The data\nhave improved the distribution of orbital periods, the relation between the\norbital period and the variation of superhumps, the relation between period\nvariations and the rebrightening type in WZ Sge-type objects. Coupled with new\nmeasurements of mass ratios using growing stages of superhumps, we now have a\nclearer and statistically greatly improved evolutionary path near the terminal\nstage of evolution of cataclysmic variables. Three objects (V452 Cas, KK Tel,\nASASSN-15cl) appear to have slowly growing superhumps, which is proposed to\nreflect the slow growth of the 3:1 resonance near the stability border.\nASASSN-15sl, ASASSN-15ux, SDSS J074859.55+312512.6 and CRTS J200331.3-284941\nare newly identified eclipsing SU UMa-type (or WZ Sge-type) dwarf novae.\nASASSN-15cy has a short (~0.050 d) superhump period and appears to belong to EI\nPsc-type objects with compact secondaries having an evolved core. ASASSN-15gn,\nASASSN-15hn, ASASSN-15kh and ASASSN-16bu are candidate period bouncers with\nsuperhump periods longer than 0.06 d. We have newly obtained superhump periods\nfor 79 objects and 13 orbital periods, including periods from early superhumps.\nIn order that the future observations will be more astrophysically beneficial\nand rewarding to observers, we propose guidelines how to organize observations\nof various superoutbursts.\n", "  This paper reports on polarimetric radiation properties based on the\nswitching modes of normal PSR B2020+28 by analysing the data acquired from the\nNanshan 25-m radio telescope at 1556 MHz. With nearly 8 hours quasi-continuous\nobservation, the data presented some striking and updated phenomena. The change\nof relative intensity between the leading and trailing components is the\npredominant feature of mode switching. The intensity ratio between the leading\nand trailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over\n30 seconds. It is found that there is an excess of high ratios over the normal\ndistribution, which indicates that two modes exist in the pulsar. The\ndistribution of abnormal mode has a narrower width indicating that the abnormal\nmode is more stable than the normal mode. A total of 76 mode switching events\nare detected in our data. It spends 89\\% in the normal mode and 11\\% in the\nabnormal mode. The intrinsic distributions of mode timescales are constrained\nwith power-law distributions. The significant difference in the index of the\nduration distribution between normal and abnormal modes possibly indicates that\nthe timescale for the abnormal mode to get stable is shorter than that for the\nnormal mode. The frequent switching between both modes may indicate that the\noscillations between different magnetospheric states are rapid.\n", "  We imaged the transport of current-induced spin coherence in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas confined in a triple quantum well. Nonlocal Kerr\nrotation measurements, based on the optical resonant amplification of the\nelectrically-induced polarization, revealed a large spatial variation of the\nelectron g factor and the efficient generation of a current controlled\nspin-orbit field in a macroscopic Hall bar device. We observed coherence times\nin the nanoseconds range transported beyond half-millimeter distances in a\ndirection transverse to the applied electric field. The measured long spin\ntransport length can be explained by two material properties: large mean free\npath for charge diffusion in clean systems and enhanced spin-orbit coefficients\nin the triple well.\n", "  We present the 21 cm power spectrum analysis approach of the Murchison\nWidefield Array Epoch of Reionization project. In this paper, we compare the\noutputs of multiple pipelines for the purpose of validating statistical limits\ncosmological hydrogen at redshifts between 6 and 12. Multiple, independent,\ndata calibration and reduction pipelines are used to make power spectrum limits\non a fiducial night of data. Comparing the outputs of imaging and power\nspectrum stages highlights differences in calibration, foreground subtraction\nand power spectrum calculation. The power spectra found using these different\nmethods span a space defined by the various tradeoffs between speed, accuracy,\nand systematic control. Lessons learned from comparing the pipelines range from\nthe algorithmic to the prosaically mundane; all demonstrate the many pitfalls\nof neglecting reproducibility. We briefly discuss the way these different\nmethods attempt to handle the question of evaluating a significant detection in\nthe presence of foregrounds.\n", "  The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in quasi-two-dimensional\nBEDT-TTF organic superconductors is a subject of ongoing debate. We report ab\ninitio density functional theory calculations for a number of organic\nsuperconductors containing $\\kappa$-type layers. Using projective Wannier\nfunctions we derive parameters of a common low-energy Hamiltonian based on\nindividual BEDT-TTF molecular orbitals. In a random phase approximation\nspin-fluctuation approach we investigate the evolution of the superconducting\npairing symmetry within this model and point out a phase-transition between\nextended $s + d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ symmetry. We discuss the origin of the\nmixed order parameter and the relation between the realistic molecule\ndescription and the widely used dimer approximation. Based on our ab initio\ncalculations we position the investigated materials in the obtained molecule\nmodel phase diagram and simulate scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments\nfor selected cases. Our calculations show that many $\\kappa$-type materials lie\nclose to the phase transition line between the two pairing symmetry types found\nin our calculation, possibly explaining the multitude of contradictory\nexperiments in this field.\n", "  A dispersion relation for a commonly used hybrid model of plasma physics is\ndeveloped, which combines fully kinetic ions and a massless-electron fluid\ndescription. Although this model and variations of it have been used to\ndescribe plasma phenomena for about 40 years, to date there exists no general\ndispersion relation to describe the linear wave physics contained in the model.\nPrevious efforts along these lines are extended here to retain arbitrary wave\npropagation angles, temperature anisotropy effects, as well as additional terms\nin the generalized Ohm's law which determines the electric field. A numerical\nsolver for the dispersion relation is developed, and linear wave physics is\nbenchmarked against solutions of a full Vlasov-Maxwell dispersion relation\nsolver. This work opens the door to a more accurate interpretation of existing\nand future wave and turbulence simulations using this type of hybrid model.\n", "  We consider the minimal three-form ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity coupled to\nnilpotent three-form chiral superfields. The supersymmetry breaking is sourced\nby the three-forms of the chiral multiplets, while the value of the gravitino\nmass is controlled by the three-form of the supergravity multiplet. The\nthree-forms can nucleate membranes which scan both the supersymmetry breaking\nscale and the gravitino mass. The peculiar supergravity feature that the\ncosmological constant is the sum of a positive contribution from the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale and a negative contribution from the gravitino\nmass makes the cosmological constant jump. This can lead to a\nphenomenologically allowed small value of the cosmological constant even though\nthe supersymmetry breaking scale and the gravitino mass are dynamically large.\n", "  It is well known that the polarization signal in microlensing events of hot\nstars is larger than that of main-sequence stars. Most hot stars rapidly rotate\naround their stellar axes. The stellar rotation makes ellipticity and\ngravity-darkening effects which break the spherical symmetry of the source\nshape and the circular symmetry of the source surface brightness respectively.\nHence, it causes a net polarization signal for the source star. This\npolarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast\nrotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even\ncharacterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through\npolarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source\nstar makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing\ncurves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected\nposition of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a\ntime shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in\ntransit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry\ncurves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing\nevents. By measuring this time shift via polarimetry observations of\nmicrolensing events, we can evaluate the ellipticity of the projected source\nsurface on the sky plane. Given the characterizations of the FOcal Reducer and\nlow dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2) polarimeter at Very Large Telescope (VLT)\ntelescope, the probability of observing this time shift is so small. The more\naccurate polarimeters of the next generation may likely measure these time\nshifts and evaluate the ellipticity of microlensing source stars.\n", "  We derive a general expression for standard tensor norm of $N$-body\ncorrelation tensors for $N$-qubit complete graph states. With the help of this\nexpression, we formulate a separability criterion that identifies\nnon-$k$-separability of a class of $N$-qubit complete graph states, including\nGHZ state. We illustrate the performance of our criterion by considering the\n$N$-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise. We also\ndemonstrate that few local measurement settings are sufficient to evaluate our\ncriterion.\n", "  The Yukawa interactions of the SO(10) GUT with fermions in 16-plets (as well\nas with singlets) have certain intrinsic (\"built-in\") symmetries which do not\ndepend on the model parameters. Thus, the symmetric Yukawa interactions of the\n10 and 126 dimensional Higgses have intrinsic discrete $Z_2\\times Z_2$\nsymmetries, while the antisymmetric Yukawa interactions of the 120 dimensional\nHiggs have a continuous SU(2) symmetry. The couplings of SO(10) singlet\nfermions with fermionic 16-plets have $U(1)^3$ symmetry. We consider a\npossibility that some elements of these intrinsic symmetries are the residual\nsymmetries, which originate from the (spontaneous) breaking of a larger\nsymmetry group $G_f$. Such an embedding leads to the determination of certain\nelements of the relative mixing matrix $U$ between the matrices of Yukawa\ncouplings $Y_{10}$, $Y_{126}$, $Y_{120}$, and consequently, to restrictions of\nmasses and mixings of quarks and leptons. We explore the consequences of such\nembedding using the symmetry group conditions. We show how unitarity emerges\nfrom group properties and obtain the conditions it imposes on the parameters of\nembedding. We find that in some cases the predicted values of elements of $U$\nare compatible with the existing data fits. In the supersymmetric version of\nSO(10) such results are renormalization group invariant.\n", "  The habitable zone (HZ) describes the range of orbital distances around a\nstar where the existence of liquid water on the surface of an Earth-like planet\nis in principle possible. While 3D climate studies can calculate the water\nvapor, ice albedo, and cloud feedback self-consistently and therefore allow for\na deeper understanding and the identification of relevant climate processes, 1D\nmodel studies rely on fewer model assumptions and can be more easily applied to\nthe large parameter space possible for exoplanets. We evaluate the\napplicability of 1D climate models to estimate the potential habitability of\nEarth-like exoplanets by comparing our 1D model results to those of 3D climate\nstudies in the literature. We applied a cloud-free 1D radiative-convective\nclimate model to calculate the climate of Earth-like planets around different\ntypes of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity\nprofile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated\nself-consistently in most 1D models. We compared the results to those of 3D\nmodel calculations in the literature and investigated to what extent the 1D\nmodel can approximate the surface temperatures calculated by the 3D models. The\n1D parameter study results in a large range of climates possible for an\nEarth-sized planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and water reservoir at a\ncertain stellar insolation. At some stellar insolations the full spectrum of\nclimate states could be realized, i.e., uninhabitable conditions as well as\nhabitable surface conditions, depending only on the relative humidity and\nsurface albedo assumed. When treating the surface albedo and the relative\nhumidity profile as parameters in 1D model studies and using the habitability\nconstraints found by recent 3D modeling studies, the same conclusions about the\npotential habitability of a planet can be drawn as from 3D model calculations.\n", "  Many-body entanglement is studied within the algebraic approach to quantum\nphysics in systems made of Majorana fermions. In this framework, the notion of\nseparability stems from partitions of the algebra of observables and properties\nof the associated correlation functions, rather than on particle tensor\nproducts. This allows obtaining a complete characterization of non-separable\nMajorana fermion states. These results may find direct applications in quantum\nmetrology: using Majorana systems, sub-shot noise accuracy in parameter\nestimations can be achieved without preliminary, resource consuming, state\nentanglement operations.\n", "  The LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS have reported an excess in the diphoton\nspectrum at \\sim 750 GeV. At the same time the motivation for Supersymmetry\n(SUSY) remains unbowed. Consequently, we review briefly the proposals to\nexplain this excess in SUSY, focusing on \"pure\" (N)MSSM solutions. We then\nreview in more detail a proposal to realize this excess within the NMSSM. In\nthis particular scenario a Higgs boson with mass around 750 GeV decays to two\nlight pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons. Via mixing with the pion these pseudo-scalars\ndecay into a pair of highly collimated photons, which are identified as one\nphoton, thus resulting in the observed signal.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the variables affecting the electronic and\noptical properties of two-dimensional(2D) crystals within \\textit{ab initio} GW\nand GW plus Bethe Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE) calculations. As a prototypical 2D\ntransition metal dichalcogenide material, we focus our study on monolayer\nMoS${}_2$. We find that the reported variations in GW-BSE results in the\nliterature for monolayer MoS${}_2$ and related systems arise from different\ntreatments of the long-range Coulomb interaction in supercell calculations and\nconvergence of k-grid sampling and cutoffs for various quantities such as the\ndielectric screening. In particular, the quasi-2D nature of the system gives\nrise to fast spatial variations in the screening environment, which are\ncomputationally challenging to resolve. We also show that common numerical\ntreatments to remove the divergence in the Coulomb interaction can shift the\nexciton continuum leading to false convergence with respect to k-point\nsampling. Our findings apply to GW-BSE calculations on any low-dimensional\nsemiconductors.\n", "  We present a way to analyze the distribution produced by a Monte Carlo\nalgorithm. We perform these analyses on several versions of the Sudakov veto\nalgorithm, adding a cutoff, a second variable and competition between emission\nchannels. The analysis allows us to prove that multiple, seemingly different\ncompetition algorithms, including those that are currently implemented in most\nparton showers, lead to the same result. Finally, we test their performance and\nshow that there are significantly faster alternatives to the commonly used\nalgorithms.\n", "  At the core of the standard cosmological model lies the assumption that the\nredshift of distant galaxies is independent of photon wavelength. This\ninvariance of cosmological redshift with wavelength is routinely found in all\ngalaxy spectra with a precision of $\\Delta$z~10$^{-4}$. The combined use of\napproximately half a million high-quality galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) allows us to explore this invariance down to a nominal\nprecision in redshift of one part per million (statistical). Our analysis is\nperformed over the redshift interval 0.02<z<0.25. We use the centroids of\nspectral lines over the 3700-6800\\AA\\ rest-frame optical window. We do not find\nany difference in redshift between the blue and red sides down to a precision\nof 10$^{-6}$ at z<0.1 and 10$^{-5}$ at 0.1<z<0.25 (i.e. at least an order of\nmagnitude better than with single galaxy spectra). This is the first time the\nwavelength-independence of the (1+z) redshift law is confirmed over a wide\nspectral window at this precision level. This result holds independently of the\nstellar population of the galaxies and their kinematical properties. This\nresult is also robust against wavelength calibration issues. The limited\nspectral resolution (R~2000) of the SDSS data combined with the asymmetric\nwavelength sampling of the spectral features in the observed restframe due to\nthe (1+z) stretching of the lines prevent our methodology to achieve a\nprecision higher than 10$^{-5}$, at z>0.1. Future attempts to constrain this\nlaw will require high quality galaxy spectra at higher resolution (R>10,000).\n", "  In this paper, we unearth symmetries of different types of a nonlinear\nnon-polynomial oscillator. The symmetries which we report here are\nadjoint-symmetries, contact symmetries and telescopic vector fields. We also\nobtain Jacobi last multipliers and Darboux polynomials as a by-product of our\nprocedure. All the aforementioned quantities are derived from a Theorem proved\nby Muriel and Romero. The procedure which we present here is applicable to a\nclass of nonlinear oscillator equations.\n", "  Self-organized spatial structures in the light emission from the ion-ion\ncapacitive RF plasma of a strongly electronegative gas (CF4) are observed\nexperimentally for the first time. Their formation is analyzed and understood\nbased on particle-based kinetic simulations. These \"striations\" are found to be\ngenerated by the resonance between the driving radio-frequency and the\neigenfrequency of the ion-ion plasma (derived from an analytical model) that\nestablishes a modulation of the electric field, the ion densities, as well as\nthe energy gain and loss processes of electrons in the plasma. The growth of\nthe instability is followed by the numerical simulations.\n", "  Genetic regulatory networks with adaptive responses are widely studied in\nbiology. Usually, models consisting only of a few nodes have been considered.\nThey present one input receptor for activation and one output node where the\nadaptive response is computed. In this work, we design genetic regulatory\nnetworks with many receptors and many output nodes able to produce delayed\nadaptive responses. This design is performed by using an evolutionary algorithm\nof mutations and selections that minimizes an error function defined by the\nadaptive response in signal shapes. We present several examples of network\nconstructions with a predefined required set of adaptive delayed responses. We\nshow that an output node can have different kinds of responses as a function of\nthe activated receptor. Additionally, complex network structures are presented\nsince processing nodes can be involved in several input-output pathways.\n", "  We have done the exploratory study of bottom tetraquarks ($[bq\\bar b \\bar\nq];{q\\in u,d}$) in the diquark-antidiquark framework with the inclusion of spin\nhyperfine, spin-orbit and tensor components of the one gluon exchange\ninteraction. Our focus here is on the $Y_b$(10890) and other exotic states in\nthe bottom sector. We have predicted some of the bottom counterparts to the\ncharm tetraquark candidates. Our present study shows that if $Z_b(10610)$ and\n$Z_b(10650)$ are diquark-diantiquark states then they have to be first radial\nexcitations only and we have predicted $Z_b(10650)$ state as first radial\nexcitation of tetraquark state $X_b$ (10.143-10.230). We have identified $X_b$\nstate with $J^{PC}= 1^{+-}/0^{++}$ as being the analogue of $Z_c(3900)$. An\nobservation of the $X_b$ will provide a deeper insight into the exotic hadron\nspectroscopy and is helpful to unravel the nature of the states connected by\nthe heavy quark symmetry. We particularly focus on the lowest P wave $[bq][\\bar\nb\\bar q]$ states with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ by computing their leptonic, hadronic and\nradiative decay widths to predict the status of still controversial\n$Y_b$(10890) state. Apart from this, we have also shown here the possibility of\nmixing of P wave states. In the case of mixing of $1^{--}$ state with different\nspin multiplicities, we found that predicted masses of the mixed P states\ndiffer from $Y_b$(10890) state only by $\\pm20$ MeV energy difference which can\nbe helpful to resolve further the structure of $Y_b$(10890).\n", "  One possible approach for detecting ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and\nneutrinos is to search for radio emission from extensive air showers created\nwhen they interact in the atmosphere of Jupiter, effectively utilizing Jupiter\nas a particle detector. We investigate the potential of this approach. For\nsearches with current or planned radio telescopes we find that the effective\narea for detection of cosmic rays is substantial (~3*10^7 km^2), but the\nacceptance angle is so small that the typical geometric aperture (~10^3 km^2\nsr) is less than that of existing terrestrial detectors, and cosmic rays also\ncannot be detected below an extremely high threshold energy (~10^23 eV). The\ngeometric aperture for neutrinos is slightly larger, and greater sensitivity\ncan be achieved with a radio detector on a Jupiter-orbiting satellite, but in\nneither case is this sufficient to constitute a practical detection technique.\nExploitation of the large surface area of Jupiter for detecting\nultra-high-energy particles remains a long-term prospect that will require a\ndifferent technique, such as orbital fluorescence detection.\n", "  Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization algorithm, we have\nperformed a density estimation in the framework of $T_{90}$ versus hardness\nratio for 296 Swift/BAT GRBs with known redshift. Here, Bayesian Information\nCriterion has been taken to compare different models. Our investigations show\nthat two instead of three or more Gaussian components are favoured in both the\nobserver and rest frames. Our key findings are consistent with some previous\nresults.\n", "  We consider the theory and application of a solution method for the inverse\nproblem in collisionless equilibria, namely that of calculating a\nVlasov-Maxwell equilibrium for a given macroscopic (fluid) equilibrium. Using\nJeans' Theorem, the equilibrium distribution functions are expressed as\nfunctions of the constants of motion, in the form of a Maxwellian multiplied by\nan unknown function of the canonical momenta. In this case it is possible to\nreduce the inverse problem to inverting Weierstrass transforms, which we\nachieve by using expansions over Hermite polynomials. A sufficient condition on\nthe pressure tensor is found which guarantees the convergence and the\nboundedness of the candidate solution, when satisfied. This condition is\nobtained by elementary means, and it is clear how to put it into practice. We\nalso argue that for a given pressure tensor for which our method applies, there\nalways exists a positive distribution function solution for a sufficiently\nmagnetised plasma. Illustrative examples of the use of this method with both\nforce-free and non-force-free macroscopic equilibria are presented, including\nthe full verification of a recently derived distribution function for the\nforce-free Harris Sheet (Allanson $\\textit{et al., Phys. Plasmas}$, vol. 22\n(10), 2015, 102116). In the effort to model equilibria with lower values of the\nplasma beta, solutions for the same macroscopic equilibrium in a new gauge are\ncalculated, with numerical results presented for $\\beta_{pl}=0.05$.\n", "  The aim of this study is to clarify if the assumption of ionization\nequilibrium and a Maxwellian electron energy distribution is valid in flaring\nsolar plasmas. We analyze the 2014 December 20 X1.8 flare, in which the\n\\ion{Fe}{xxi} 187~\\AA, \\ion{Fe}{xxii} 253~\\AA, \\ion{Fe}{xxiii} 263~\\AA\\ and\n\\ion{Fe}{xxiv} 255~\\AA\\ emission lines were simultaneously observed by the EUV\nImaging Spectrometer onboard the Hinode satellite. Intensity ratios among these\nhigh temperature Fe lines are compared and departures from isothermal\nconditions and ionization equilibrium examined. Temperatures derived from\nintensity ratios involving these four lines show significant discrepancies at\nthe flare footpoints in the impulsive phase, and at the looptop in the gradual\nphase. Among these, the temperature derived from the\n\\ion{Fe}{xxii}/\\ion{Fe}{xxiv} intensity ratio is the lowest, which cannot be\nexplained if we assume a Maxwellian electron distribution and ionization\nequilibrium, even in the case of a multi-thermal structure. This result\nsuggests that the assumption of ionization equilibrium and/or a Maxwellian\nelectron energy distribution can be violated in evaporating solar plasma around\n10~MK.\n", "  Light curve modulations in the sample of Kepler planet candidates allows the\ndisentangling of the nature of the transiting object by photometrically\nmeasuring its mass. This is possible by detecting the effects of the\ngravitational pull of the companion (ellipsoidal modulations) and in some\ncases, the photometric imprints of the Doppler effect when observing in a broad\nband (Doppler beaming). We aim to photometrically unveil the nature of some\ntransiting objects showing clear modulations in the phase-folded Kepler light\ncurve. We selected a subsample among the large crop of Kepler objects of\ninterest (KOIs) based on their chances to show detectable light curve\nmodulations, i.e., close ($a<12~R_{\\star}$) and large (in terms of radius)\ncandidates. We modeled their phase-folded light curves with consistent\nequations for the three effects, namely, reflection, ellipsoidal and beaming\n(known as REB modulations). We provide detailed general equations for the fit\nof the REB modulations for the case of eccentric orbits. These equations are\naccurate to the photometric precisions achievable by current and forthcoming\ninstruments and space missions. By using this mathematical apparatus, we find\nthree close-in {very low-mass companions (two of them in the brown dwarf mass\ndomain)} orbiting main-sequence stars (KOI-554, KOI-1074, and KOI-3728), and\nreject the planetary nature of the transiting objects (thus classifying them as\nfalse positives). In contrast, the detection of the REB modulations and\ntransit/eclipse signal allows the measurement of their mass and radius that can\nprovide important constraints for modeling their interiors since just a few\ncases of low-mass eclipsing binaries are known. Additionally, these new systems\ncan help to constrain the similarities in the formation process of the more\nmassive and close-in planets (hot Jupiters), brown dwarfs, and very low-mass\ncompanions.\n", "  The quasi-skutterudite superconductor La$_3$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$ undergoes a phase\ntransition at $T^*=152$ K. By measuring the temperature dependence of heat\ncapacity, electrical resistivity, and the superlattice reflection intensity\nusing X-ray, we explore the character of the phase transition at $T^*$. Our\nlattice dynamic calculations found imaginary phonon frequencies around the\n${\\bf M}$ point, when the high temperature structure is used in the\ncalculations, indicating that the structure is unstable at the zero temperature\nlimit. The combined experimental and computational results establish that $T^*$\nis associated with a second-order structural transition with $\\bf{q}$=(0.5,\n0.5, 0) (or the ${\\bf M}$ point). Further electronic bandstructure calculations\nreveal Fermi surface sheets with low curvature segments, which allow us to draw\nqualitative comparison with both Sr$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and\nSr$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ in which similar physics has been discussed recently.\n", "  Recent analyses of wetting in the semi-infinite two dimensional Ising model,\nextended to include both a surface coupling enhancement and a surface field,\nhave shown that the wetting transition may be effectively first-order and that\nsurprisingly the surface susceptibility develops a divergence described by an\nanomalous exponent with value $\\gamma_{11}^{\\rm eff}=\\frac{3}{2}$. We reproduce\nthese results using an interfacial Hamiltonian model making connection with\nprevious studies of two dimensional wetting and show that they follow from the\nsimple crossover scaling of the singular contribution to the surface\nfree-energy which describes the change from apparent first-order to continuous\n(critical) wetting due to interfacial tunnelling. The crossover scaling\nfunctions are calculated explicitly within both the strong-fluctuation and\nintermediate-fluctuation regimes and determine uniquely and more generally the\nvalue of $\\gamma_{11}^{\\rm eff}$ which is non-universal for the latter regime.\nThe location and the rounding of a line of pseudo pre-wetting transitions\noccurring above the wetting temperature and off bulk coexistence, together with\nthe crossover scaling of the parallel correlation length, is also discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  The idea of obtaining a pilot-wave quantum theory on a lattice with discrete\ntime is presented. The motion of quantum particles is described by a\n$|\\Psi|^2$-distributed Markov chain. Stochastic matrices of the process are\nfound by the discrete version of the least-action principle. Probability\ncurrents are the consequence of Hamilton's principle and the stochasticity of\nthe Markov process is minimized. As an example, stochastic motion of single\nparticles in a double-slit experiment is examined.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of Snell's law for magneto-static spin\nwaves in thin ferromagnetic Permalloy films by imaging incident, refracted and\nreflected waves. We use a thickness step as the interface between two media\nwith different dispersion relation. Since the dispersion relation for\nmagneto-static waves in thin ferromagnetic films is anisotropic, deviations\nfrom the isotropic Snell's law known in optics are observed for incidence\nangles larger than 25\\textdegree{} with respect to the interface normal between\nthe two magnetic media. Furthermore, we can show that the thickness step\nmodifies the wavelength and the amplitude of the incident waves. Our findings\nopen up a new way of spin wave steering for magnonic applications.\n", "  We examine anharmonic contributions to the optical phonon modes in bulk\n$T_d$-MoTe$_2$ through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. At\ntemperatures ranging from 100 K to 200 K, we find that all modes redshift\nlinearly with temperature in agreement with the Gr\\\"{u}neisen model. However,\nbelow 100 K we observe nonlinear temperature-dependent frequency shifts in some\nmodes. We demonstrate that this anharmonic behavior is consistent with the\ndecay of an optical phonon into multiple acoustic phonons. Furthermore, the\nhighest frequency Raman modes show large changes in intensity and linewidth\nnear $T\\approx 250$ K that correlate well with the $T_d \\to 1T^\\prime$\nstructural phase transition. These results suggest that phonon-phonon\ninteractions can dominate anharmonic contributions at low temperatures in bulk\n$T_d$-MoTe$_2$, an experimental regime that is currently receiving attention in\nefforts to understand Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Recent applications of the M3Y-type semi-realistic interaction to the nuclear\nmean-field approaches are presented: (i) Prediction of magic numbers and (ii)\nisotope shifts of nuclei with magic proton numbers. The results exemplify that\nrealistic interaction, which is derived from the base $2N$ and $3N$\ninteraction, furnish a new theoretical instrument for advancing nuclear\nmean-field approaches.\n", "  Wind and solar power are known to be highly influenced by weather events and\nmay ramp up or down abruptly. Such events in the power production influence not\nonly the availability of energy, but also the stability of the entire power\ngrid. By analysing significant amounts of data from several regions around the\nworld with resolutions of seconds to minutes, we provide strong evidence that\nrenewable wind and solar sources exhibit multiple types of variability and\nnonlinearity in the time scale of {\\it seconds} and characterise their\nstochastic properties. In contrast to previous findings, we show that only the\njumpy characteristic of renewable sources decreases when increasing the spatial\nsize over which the renewable energies are harvested. Otherwise, the strong\nnon-Gaussian, intermittent behaviour in the cumulative power of the total field\nsurvives even for a country-wide distribution of the systems. The strong\nfluctuating behaviour of renewable wind and solar sources can be well\ncharacterised by Kolmogorov-like power spectra and $q-$exponential probability\ndensity functions. Using the estimated potential shape of power time series, we\nquantify the jumpy or diffusive dynamic of the power. Finally we propose a time\ndelayed feedback technique as a control algorithm to suppress the observed\nshort term non-Gaussian statistics in spatially strong correlated and\nintermittent renewable sources.\n", "  The gradient flow in QCD is treated perturbatively through\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant. The evaluation\nof the relevant momentum and flow-time integrals is described, including\nvarious means of validation. For the vacuum expectation value of the action\ndensity, which turns out to be a useful quantity in lattice calculations, we\nfind a very well-behaved perturbative series through NNLO. Quark mass effects\nare taken into account through NLO. The theoretical uncertainty due to\nrenormalization scale variation is significantly reduced with respect to LO and\nNLO, as long as the flow time is smaller than about 0.1 fm.\n", "  We report on the numerical and theoretical study of the subcritical\nbifurcation of parametrically amplified waves appearing at the interface\nbetween two immiscible incompressible fluids when the layer of the lower fluid\nis very shallow. As a critical control parameter is surpassed, small amplitude\nsurface waves bifurcate towards highly nonlinear ones, with twice their\namplitude. We propose a simple phenomenological model which can describe the\nobserved bifurcation. We relate this hysteresis with the change of shear stress\nusing a simple stress balance, in agreement with numerical results.\n", "  The cross section of pair double heavy diquark production process\n$pp\\to(bc)+(\\bar b \\bar c)+X$ is calculated in the leading order of gluonic\nfusion channel with all four possible color and spin combinations\n$[^1S_0]_{\\bar3}$, $[^1S_0]_{6}$, $[^3S_1]_{\\bar3}$, and $[^3S_1]_{6}$ for each\nof the two final diquarks taken into account. Several sources of relativistic\ncorrections to the cross section are handled in the framework of relativistic\nquark model. Perturbative $\\mathcal O(v^2)$ corrections originating from the\nproduction amplitude expansions in heavy quark relative velocity~$v$ depend on\nthe color and spin states of the final particles, but can be generally\nconsidered as unimportant ones giving maximally 12\\% improvement in numerically\nsignificant cases. Modifications of the quark--quark and antiquark--antiquark\nbound state wave functions caused by the appropriate generalization of the\nBreit interaction potential have rather severe impact on the cross section\nsuppressing it almost three times. Under assumption of antitriplets and\nsextuplets' nonperturbative parameters having the same order of magnitude, it\nis shown that the color-sextet mechanism strongly dominates pair diquark\nproduction in both nonrelativistic and relativistic approximations.\n", "  A new normalized sunspot-area series has been reconstructed from the series\nobtained by the Royal Greenwich Observatory and other contemporary institutions\nfor the period 1874 - 2008 and the area series compiled by De la Rue, Stewart,\nand Loewy from 1832 to 1868. Since the two sets of series do not overlap in\ntime, we used as a link between them the new version of sunspot index number\n(Version 2) published by SILSO (Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar\nObservations). We also present a spectral analysis of the normalized area\nseries in search of periodicities beyond the well-known solar cycle of 11 years\nand a study of the Waldmeier effect in the new version of sunspot-number and\nthe sunspot-area series presented in this study. We conclude that while this\neffect is significant in the new series of sunspot number, it has a weak\nrelationship with the sunspot-area series.\n", "  Theories that attempt to explain the dynamical relationship between bar and\nspiral patterns in galactic disks make different predictions about the radial\nprofile of the pattern speed. These are tested for the H-alpha bar and spiral\npatterns of NGC 1365. The radial profile of the pattern speed is measured by\nfitting mathematical models that are based on the Tremaine-Weinberg method. The\nresults show convincing evidence for the bar rotating at a faster rate than the\nspiral pattern, inconsistent with a global wave mode or a manifold. There is\nevidence for mode coupling of the bar and spiral patterns at the overlap of\ncorotation and inner Lindblad resonances, but the evidence is unreliable and\ninconsistent. The results are the most consistent with the bar and spiral\npatterns being dynamically distinct features. The pattern speed of the bar\nbegins near an ILR and ends near the corotation resonance. The radial profile\nof the pattern speed beyond the bar most closely resembles what is expected for\ncoupled spiral modes and tidal interactions.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a linear kinetic model that describes the evolution\nof the probability density of the number of firms in a society, in which the\nmicroscopic rate of change obeys to the so-called law of proportional effect\nproposed by Gibrat. Despite its apparent simplicity, the possible mean field\nlimits of the kinetic model are varied. In some cases, the asymptotic limit can\nbe described by a first-order partial differential equation. In other cases,\nthe mean field equation is a linear diffusion with a non constant diffusion\ncoefficient that models also the geometric Brownian motion and can be studied\nanalytically. In this case, it is shown that the large-time behavior of the\nsolution is represented, for a large class of initial data, by a lognormal\ndistribution with constant mean value and variance increasing exponentially in\ntime at a precise rate. The relationship between the kinetic and the diffusion\nmodels allow to introduce an easy-to- implement expression for computing the\nFourier transform of the lognormal distribution.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that the variation over the solar magnetic\nactivity cycle of the area of facular/network features identified on broad band\nand narrow band imagery is positively correlated with the sunspot area and\nnumber, the relation between the area coverages being described as either\nlinear or quadratic. On the other hand, the temporal variation of the spatial\ndistributions of faculae, network and sunspots follows patterns that are less\nobviously correlated, so that we expect the relation that describes variation\nof the area coverage of different types of magnetic features to vary with the\nposition over the disk. In this work we employ MDI full-disk magnetograms\nacquired during Cycle 23 and at the beginning of Cycle 24 to investigate the\nrelation between the coverage of magnetic elements characterized by different\namounts of magnetic flux and located at different angular distances from disk\ncenter with the sunspot number. In agreement with some previous studies we find\nthat daily data are best described by a quadratic function while data averaged\nover 6-months are best described by a linear function. In both cases the\ncoefficients of the fits show large dependence on the position over the disk\nand the magnetic flux. We also find that toward disk center 6-months averaged\ndata show asymmetries between the ascending and the descending phase.\nImplications for solar irradiance modeling are discussed.\n", "  Work of Lev Landau had a profound impact on the physics in 20th century.\nLandau had created the paradigms that had framed the conversations on the\noutstanding problems in physics for decades. He has laid the foundations for\nour understanding of quantum matter such as superfluidity, superconductivity\nand the theory of Fermi Liquid. Here we present sampled Nobel Archive data on\nthe winning nomination that led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962.\n", "  In half-doped Pr0.50A0.50CoO3 metallic perovskites, the spin-lattice coupling\nbrings about distinct magnetostructural transitions for A=Ca and A=Sr at\ntemperatures close to 100 K. However, the ground magnetic properties of\nPr0.50Sr0.50CoO3 (PSCO) strongly differ from Pr0.50Ca0.50CoO3 ones, where a\npartial Pr3+ to Pr4+ valence shift and Co spin transition makes the system\ninsulating below the transition. This work investigates and describes the\nrelationship between the Imma-to-I4/mcm symmetry change [Padilla-Pantoja et al,\nInorg. Chem. 53, 12297 (2014)] and the original magnetic behavior of PSCO\nversus temperature and external magnetic fields. The FM1 and FM2 ferromagnetic\nphases, above and below the magnetostructural transition (TS1=120 K) have been\ninvestigated. The FM2 phase of PSCO is composed of [100] FM domains, with\nmagnetic symmetry Im'm'a (mz=0). The magnetic space group of the FM1 phase is\nFm'm'm (with mx=my). Neutron data analyses in combination with magnetometry and\nearlier reports results agrees with a reorientation of the magnetization axis\nby 45 deg within the a-b plane across the transition, in which the system\nretains its metallic character. The presence below TS1 of conjugated magnetic\ndomains, both of Fm'm'm symmetry but having perpendicular spin orientations\nalong the diagonals in the xy-plane of the tetragonal unit cell, is at the\norigin of the anomalies observed in the macroscopic magnetization. A relatively\nsmall field m0H > 30 mT is able to reorient the magnetization within the a-b\nplane, whereas a higher field (m0H,[H//z] >1.2 T at 2K) is necessary to align\nthe Co moments perpendicular to a-b plane. Such a spin reorientation, in which\nthe orbital and spin components of the Co moment rotate joined by 45deg, was\nnot observed with other lanthanides different to praseodymium.\n", "  We report a structural study of the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP, utilizing\ndiffraction and imaging techniques, where we show that they contain a high\ndensity of defects, leading to non-stoichiometric single crystals of both\nsemimetals. Despite the observed defects and non-stoichiometry on samples grown\nusing techniques already reported in the literature, de Haas-van Alphen\nmeasurements on TaP reveal quantum oscillations and a high carrier mobility, an\nindication that the crystals are of quality comparable to those reported\nelsewhere. Electronic structure calculations on TaAs reveal that the position\nof the Weyl points relative to the Fermi level shift with the introduction of\nvacancies and stacking faults. In the case of vacancies the Fermi surface\nbecomes considerably altered, while the effect of stacking faults on the\nelectronic structure is to allow the Weyl pockets to remain close to the Fermi\nsurface. The observation of quantum oscillations in a non-stoichiometric\ncrystal and the persistence of Weyl fermion pockets near the Fermi surface in a\ncrystal with stacking faults point to the robustness of these quantum phenomena\nin these materials.\n", "  A generic scheme to trap atoms at the magic wavelengths\n($\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$s) that are independent of vector and tensor components\nof the interactions of the atoms with the external electric field is presented.\nThe $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$s for the laser cooling D2 lines in the Rb and Cs\natoms are demonstrated and their corresponding polarizability values without\nvector and tensor contributions are given. Consequently, these\n$\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$s are independent of magnetic sublevels and hyperfine\nlevels of the atomic states involved in the transition, thus, can offer unique\napproaches to carry out many high precision measurements with minimal\nsystematics. Inevitably, the proposed technique can also be used for electronic\nor hyperfine transitions in other atomic systems.\n", "  We consider six-dimensional supergravity with Abelian bulk flux compactified\non an orbifold. The effective low-energy action can be expressed in terms of\nN=1 chiral moduli superfields with a gauged shift symmetry. The D-term\npotential contains two Fayet-Iliopoulos terms which are induced by the flux and\nby the Green-Schwarz term canceling the gauge anomalies, respectively. The\nGreen-Schwarz term also leads to a correction of the gauge kinetic function\nwhich turns out to be crucial for the existence of Minkowski and de Sitter\nvacua. Moduli stabilization is achieved by the interplay of the D-term and a\nnonperturbative superpotential. Varying the gauge coupling and the\nsuperpotential parameters, the scale of the extra dimensions can range from the\nGUT scale down to the TeV scale. Supersymmetry is broken by F- and D-terms, and\nthe scale of gravitino, moduli, and modulini masses is determined by the size\nof the compact dimensions.\n", "  We propose a method to obtain optimal protocols for adiabatic ground-state\npreparation near the adiabatic limit, extending earlier ideas from [D. A. Sivak\nand G. E. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 190602 (2012)] to quantum\nnon-dissipative systems. The space of controllable parameters of isolated\nquantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric\nstructure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically.\nHere, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to\naccomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of\ntime. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter\nmanifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize\nthe average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on\nthe Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic XY spin chain. In both cases we show\nthat geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity. Moreover, this\nhappens even if one crosses a critical point, where the adiabatic perturbation\ntheory fails.\n", "  It is well known that electron beams accelerated in solar flares can drive\ntwo-stream instability and produce radio bursts in the solar corona as well as\nin the interplanetary medium. Recent observations show that the solar wind\nlikely originates from nanoflare-like events near the surface of the Sun where\nlocally heated plasma escapes along open field lines into space. Recent\nnumerical simulations and theoretical studies show that electron two-stream\ninstability (ETSI) driven by nanoflare-accelerated electron beams can produce\nthe observed nanoflare-type radio bursts, the non-Maxwellian electron velocity\ndistribution function of the solar wind, and the kinetic scale turbulence in\nsolar wind. This brief review focus on the basic theoretical framework and\nrecent progress in the nonlinear evolution of ETSI, including the formation of\nelectron holes, Langmuir wave generation in warm plasma, and the nonlinear\nmodulation instability and Langmuir collapse. Potential applications in\nheliophysics and astrophysics are discussed.\n", "  We consider excited vortex states, which are vortex states left inside a\nsuperconductor once the external applied magnetic field is switched off and\nwhose energy is lower than of the normal state. We show that this state is\nparamagnetic and develop here a general method to obtain its Gibbs free energy\nthrough conformal mapping. The solution for any number of vortices in any cross\nsection geometry can be read off from the Schwarz - Christoffel mapping. The\nmethod is based on the first order equations used by A. Abrikosov to discover\nvortices.\n", "  We have analysed the phenomenological dependence of the spin independent\n($F_1^{p,n}$ and $F_2^{p,n}$) and the spin dependent ($g_1^{p,n}$) structure\nfunctions of the nucleon on the the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ using the\nunpolarized distribution functions of the quarks $q(x)$ and the polarized\ndistribution functions of the quarks $\\Delta q(x)$ respectively. The chiral\nconstituent quark model ($\\chi$CQM), which is known to provide a satisfactory\nexplanation of the proton spin crisis and related issues in the nonperturbative\nregime, has been used to compute explicitly the valence and sea quark flavor\ndistribution functions of $p$ and $n$. In light of the improved precision of\nthe world data, the $p$ and $n$ longitudinal spin asymmetries ($A_1^p(x)$ and\n$A_1^n(x)$) have been calculated. The implication of the presence of the sea\nquarks has been discussed for ratio of polarized to unpolarized quark\ndistribution functions for up and down quarks in the $p$ and $n$ $\\frac{\\Delta\nu^p(x)}{u^p(x)}$, $\\frac{\\Delta d^p(x)}{d^p(x)}$, $\\frac{\\Delta\nu^n(x)}{u^n(x)}$, and $\\frac{\\Delta d^n(x)}{d^n(x)}$. The ratio of the $n$ and\n$p$ structure functions $R^{np}(x)=\\frac{F_2^n(x)}{F_2^p(x)}$ has also been\npresented. The results have been compared with the recent available\nexperimental observations. The results on the spin sum rule have also been\nincluded and compared with data and other recent approaches.\n", "  We report a strong difference in the sliding properties of the bidirectional\ncharge density wave (CDW) in the two-dimensional rare earth tritelluride\nErTe$_3$ which occurs below $T_{CDW1}=265$ K with a wave vector along $c$-axis\nand below $T_{CDW2}=165$ K with a wave vector along $a$-axis; the excess\ncurrent carried by the motion of the CDW is 10 times less for the lower CDW\ncompared with the value of the upper one. We tentatively explain this result by\na stronger pinning of the lower temperature CDW intricated with the upper one,\nwhich inhibits its motion and may generate a phase slippage lattice.\n", "  Using state-of-the-art many-body Green's function calculations based on the\n\"GW plus cumulant\" approach, we analyze the properties of plasmon satellites in\nthe electron spectral function resulting from electron-plasmon interactions in\none-, two- and three-dimensional systems. Specifically, we show how their\ndispersion relation, lineshape and linewidth are related to the properties of\nthe constituent electrons and plasmons. To gain insight into the many-body\nprocesses giving rise to the formation of plasmon satellites, we connect the\n\"GW plus cumulant\" approach to a many-body wavefunction picture of\nelectron-plasmon interactions and introduce the coupling-strength weighted\nelectron-plasmon joint-density states as a powerful concept for understanding\nplasmon satellites.\n", "  Renowned for its sensitivity to detect the presence of numerous substances,\ngraphene is an excellent chemical sensor. Unfortunately, which general features\na dopant must have in order to enter the list of substances detectable by\ngraphene are not exactly known. Here we demonstrate with a simple model\ncalculation implemented in three different ways that one of such features is\nthe symmetry properties of the impurity binding to graphene. In particular, we\nshow that electronic scattering is suppressed when dopants are bound\nsymmetrically to both graphene sub-lattices, giving rise to impurity\ninvisibility. In contrast, dopants that affect the two sublattices\nasymmetrically are more strongly scattered and therefore the most likely\ncandidates to being chemically sensed by graphene. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat impurity invisibility is lifted with the introduction of a\nsymmetry-breaking perturbation such as uniaxial strain. In this case, graphene\nwith sublattice-symmetric dopants will function as efficient strain sensors. We\nargue that by classifying dopants through their bonding symmetry leads to a\nmore efficient way of identifying suitable components for graphene-based\nsensors.\n", "  Recently it is proposed that porous icy dust aggregates are formed by\npairwise accretion of dust aggregates beyond the snowline. We calculate the\nequilibrium random velocity of porous dust aggregates taking into account\nmutual gravitational scattering, collisions, gas drag, and turbulent stirring\nand scattering. We find that the disk of porous dust aggregates becomes\ngravitationally unstable as they evolve through gravitational compression in\nthe minimum-mass solar nebula model for a reasonable range of turbulence\nstrength, which leads to rapid formation of planetesimals.\n", "  We investigate finite $\\alpha '$ effects in string theory on a black hole\nbackground. By explicitly computing tree level scattering amplitudes, we\nconfirm a duality between seemingly different states recently conjectured by\nGiveon, Itzhaki, and Kutasov in [arXiv:1603.05822]. We verify that the relevant\n3-point functions factorize in such a way that the duality between oscillator\nand winding states becomes manifest. This leads to determine the precise\nnormalization of the dual vertex operators, and confirms at the level of the\ninteracting theory the identification of states suggested by the analysis of\nthe spectrum. This result implies a duality between two seemingly distinct\nmechanisms driving the violation of the string winding number in the black hole\natmosphere.\n", "  We present the results obtained by analyzing high spatial and spectral\nresolution data of the solar photosphere acquired by the CRisp Imaging\nSpectroPolarimeter at the Swedish Solar Telescope on 6 August 2011, relevant to\na large sunspot with a light bridge (LB) observed in NOAA AR 11263. These data\nare complemented by simultaneous Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) observation in\nthe Fe I 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm lines. The continuum intensity map shows a\ndiscontinuity of the radial distribution of the penumbral filaments in\ncorrespondence with the LB, which shows a dark lane (about 0.3\" wide and about\n8.0\" long) along its main axis. The available data were inverted with the\nStokes Inversion based on Response functions (SIR) code and physical parameters\nmaps were obtained. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the plasma along the LB\nderived from the Doppler effect shows motions towards and away from the\nobserver up to 0.6 km/s, which are lower in value than the LOS velocities\nobserved in the neighbouring penumbral filaments. The noteworthy result is that\nwe find motions toward the observer up to 0.6 km/s in the dark lane where the\nLB is located between two umbral cores, while the LOS velocity motion toward\nthe observer is strongly reduced where the LB is located between an umbral core\nat one side and penumbral filaments on the other side. Statistically, the LOS\nvelocities correspond to upflows/downflows andcomparing these results with\nHinode/SP data, we conclude that the surrounding magnetic field configuration\n(whether more or less inclined) could have a role in maintaining the conditions\nfor the process of plasma piling up along the dark lane. The results obtained\nfrom our study support and confirm outcomes of recent magnetohydro-dynamic\nsimulations showing upflows along the main axis of a LBs.\n", "  Surface reactivity is important in modifying the physical and chemical\nproperties of surface sensitive materials, such as the topological insulators\n(TIs). Even though many studies addressing the reactivity of TIs towards\nexternal gases have been reported, it is still under heavy debate whether and\nhow the topological insulators react with H$_2$O. Here, we employ scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) to directly probe the surface reaction of\nBi$_2$Te$_3$ towards H$_2$O. Surprisingly, it is found that only the top\nquintuple layer is reactive to H$_2$O, resulting in a hydrated Bi bilayer as\nwell as some Bi islands, which passivate the surface and prevent from the\nsubsequent reaction. A reaction mechanism is proposed with H$_2$Te and hydrated\nBi as the products. Unexpectedly, our study indicates the reaction with water\nis intrinsic and not dependent on any surface defects. Since water inevitably\nexists, these findings provide key information when considering the reactions\nof Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with residual gases or atmosphere.\n", "  We derived chemical abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al in 20 asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. All these elements\n(but Mg) show intrinsic star-to-star variations and statistically significant\ncorrelations or anticorrelations analogous to those commonly observed in red\ngiant stars of globular clusters hosting multiple populations. This\ndemonstrates that, at odds with previous findings, both first and second\ngeneration stars populate the AGB of NGC 6752. The comparison with the Na\nabundances of red giant branch stars in the same cluster reveals that second\ngeneration stars (with mild Na and He enrichment) do reach the AGB phase. The\nonly objects that are not observed along the AGB of NGC 6752 are stars with\nextreme Na enhancement. This is also consistent with standard stellar evolution\nmodels, showing that highly Na and He enriched stars populate the bluest\nportion of the horizontal branch and, because of their low stellar masses,\nevolve directly to the white dwarf cooling sequence, skipping the AGB phase.\n", "  The metallic compound EuCo2P2 with the body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2\nstructure containing Eu spins 7/2 was previously shown from single-crystal\nneutron diffraction measurements to exhibit a helical antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstructure below TN = 66.5 K with the helix axis along the c axis and with the\nordered moments aligned within the ab-plane. Here we report crystallography,\nelectrical resistivity, heat capacity, magnetization and magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements on single crystals of this compound. We demonstrate\nthat EuCo2P2 is a model molecular-field helical Heisenberg antiferromagnet from\ncomparisons of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility chi, high-field\nmagnetization and magnetic heat capacity of EuCo2P2 single crystals at\ntemperature T < TN with the predictions of our recent formulation of molecular\nfield theory. Values of the Heisenberg exchange interactions between the Eu\nspins are derived from the data. The low-T magnetic heat capacity ~ T^3 arising\nfrom spin-wave excitations with no anisotropy gap is calculated and found to be\ncomparable to the lattice heat capacity. The density of states at the Fermi\nenergy of EuCo2P2 and the related compound BaCo2P2 are found from the heat\ncapacity data to be large, 10 and 16 states/eV per formula unit for EuCo2P2 and\nBaCo2P2, respectively. These values are enhanced by a factor of ~2.5 above\nthose found from DFT electronic structure calculations for the two compounds.\nThe calculations also find ferromagnetic Eu-Eu exchange interactions within the\nab-plane and AFM interactions between nearest- and next-nearest planes, in\nagreement with the MFT analysis of chi{ab}(T < TN).\n", "  We review the actions of the supergravity theory in eleven dimensions as well\nas the type IIA and IIB supergravities in ten dimensions and derive the bosonic\nequations of motion in a coordinate-free notation. We also consider the\nexistence of supersymmetries and the associated generalized Killing spinor\nequations. The aim of this note is to serve as a formulary and make the\nequations of supergravity more easily accessible to mathematicians.\n", "  The majority of massive disk galaxies, including our own, have stellar bars\nwith vertically thick inner regions -- so-called \"boxy/peanut-shaped\" (B/P)\nbulges. The most commonly suggested mechanism for the formation of B/P bulges\nis a violent vertical \"buckling\" instability in the bar, something that has\nbeen seen in N-body simulations for over twenty years, but never identified in\nreal galaxies. Here, we present the first direct observational evidence for\nongoing buckling in two nearby galaxies (NGC 3227 and NGC 4569), including\ncharacteristic asymmetric isophotes and (in NGC 4569) stellar-kinematic\nasymmetries that match buckling in simulations. This confirms that the buckling\ninstability takes place and produces B/P bulges in real galaxies. A toy model\nof bar evolution yields a local fraction of buckling bars consistent with\nobservations if the buckling phase lasts ~0.5--1 Gyr, in agreement with\nsimulations.\n", "  It has recently been suggested [S. B. Giddings, Phys. Lett. B {\\bf 754}, 39\n(2016)] that the Hawking black-hole radiation spectrum originates from an\neffective quantum \"atmosphere\" which extends well outside the black-hole\nhorizon. In particular, comparing the Hawking radiation power of a\n$(3+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of horizon radius $r_{\\text{H}}$\nwith the familiar Stefan-Boltzmann radiation power of a $(3+1)$-dimensional\nflat space perfect blackbody emitter, Giddings concluded that the source of the\nHawking semi-classical black-hole radiation is a quantum region outside the\nSchwarzschild black-hole horizon whose effective radius $r_{\\text{A}}$ is\ncharacterized by the relation $\\Delta r\\equiv r_{\\text{A}}-r_{\\text{H}}\\sim\nr_{\\text{H}}$. It is of considerable physical interest to test the general\nvalidity of Giddings's intriguing conclusion. To this end, we study the Hawking\nradiation of $(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. We find that the\ndimensionless radii $r_{\\text{A}}/r_{\\text{H}}$ which characterize the\nblack-hole quantum atmospheres, as determined from the Hawking black-hole\nradiation power and the $(D+1)$-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law, are\na decreasing function of the number $D+1$ of spacetime dimensions. In\nparticular, it is shown that radiating $(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black\nholes are characterized by the relation\n$(r_{\\text{A}}-r_{\\text{H}})/r_{\\text{H}}\\ll1$ in the large $D\\gg1$ regime. Our\nresults therefore suggest that, at least in some physical cases, the Hawking\nemission spectrum originates from quantum excitations very near the black-hole\nhorizon.\n", "  The axion particle, a consequence of an elegant hypothesis that resolves the\nstrong-CP problem of quantum chromodynamics, is a plausible origin for\ncosmological dark matter. In searches for axionic dark matter that detect the\nconversion of axions to microwave photons, the quantum noise associated with\nmicrowave vacuum fluctuations will soon limit the rate at which parameter space\nis searched. Here we show that this noise can be partially overcome either by\nsqueezing the quantum vacuum using recently developed Josephson parametric\ndevices, or by using superconducting qubits to count microwave photons. The\nrecently demonstrated ability of superconducting qubits to make QND\nmeasurements of microwave photons offers great advantages over destructive\nphoton counting methods such as those using Rydberg atoms.\n", "  Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions known, capable of\noutshining the rest of gamma-ray sky during their short-lived prompt emission.\nTheir cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages\nin the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore,\nstudying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared)\nvia rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the\nmost distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host\ngalaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and\nneutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption\nfeatures imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as\nthe intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this\nchapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in\nunderstanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to\nstudy the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen\nfraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of\nre-ionization.\n", "  Large-scale shell-model calculations are carried out in the model space\nincluding neutron-hole orbitals $2p_{1/2}$, $1f_{5/2}$, $2p_{3/2}$,\n$0i_{13/2}$, $1f_{7/2}$ and $0h_{9/2}$ to study the structure and\nelectromagnetic properties of neutron deficient Pb isotopes. An optimized\neffective interaction is used. Good agreement between full shell-model\ncalculations and experimental data is obtained for the spherical states in\nisotopes $^{194-206}$Pb. The lighter isotopes are calculated with an\nimportance-truncation approach constructed based on the monopole Hamiltonian.\nThe full shell-model results also agree well with our generalized seniority and\nnucleon-pair-approximation truncation calculations. The deviations between\ntheory and experiment concerning the excitation energies and electromagnetic\nproperties of low-lying $0^+$ and $2^+$ excited states and isomeric states may\nprovide a constraint on our understanding of nuclear deformation and intruder\nconfiguration in this region.\n", "  Facing the ever-growing demand for data storage will most probably require a\nnew paradigm. Nanoscale magnetic skyrmions are anticipated to solve this issue\nas they are arguably the smallest spin textures in magnetic thin films in\nnature. We designed cobalt-based multilayered thin films where the cobalt layer\nis sandwiched between two heavy metals providing additive interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, which reach a value close to 2 mJ m-2 in\nthe case of the Ir|Co|Pt asymmetric multilayers. Using a\nmagnetization-sensitive scanning x-ray transmission microscopy technique, we\nimaged small magnetic domains at very low field in these multilayers. The study\nof their behavior in perpendicular magnetic field allows us to conclude that\nthey are actually magnetic skyrmions stabilized by the large\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This discovery of stable sub-100 nm\nindividual skyrmions at room temperature in a technologically relevant material\nopens the way for device applications in a near future.\n", "  A theorem of Hegerfeldt (Instantaneous spreading and Einstein causality in\nquantum theory, Ann. Phys. Leipzig vol. 7, 716-725 (1998)) establishes, for a\nclass of quantum systems, a dichotomy between those which are permanently\nlocalized in a bounded region of space, and those exhibiting instantaneous\nspreading. We analyse in some detail the physical inconsistencies which follow\nfrom both of these options, and formulate which, in our view, are the basic\nopen problems.\n", "  The characteristic and distinctive features of the visibility amplitude of\ninterferometric observations for compact objects like stars in the immediate\nvicinity of the central black hole in our Galaxy are considered. These features\nare associated with the specifics of strong gravitational scattering of point\nsources by black holes, wormholes, or black_white holes. The revealed features\nwill help to determine the most important topological characteristics of the\ncentral object in our Galaxy: whether this object possesses the properties of\nonly a black hole or also has characteristics unique to wormholes or\nblack_white holes. These studies can be used to interpret the results of\noptical, infrared, and radio interferometric observations.\n", "  Lattice defects are inevitably present in two-dimensional materials, with\ndirect implications on their physical and chemical properties. We show that the\nformation energy of a lattice defect in buckled two-dimensional crystals is not\nuniquely defined as it takes different values for different boundary conditions\neven in the thermodynamic limit, as opposed to their perfectly planar\ncounterparts. Also, the approach to the thermodynamic limit follows a different\nscaling: inversely proportional to the logaritm of the system size for buckled\nmaterials, rather than the usual power-law approach. In graphene samples of\n$\\sim 1000$ atoms, different boundary conditions can cause differences\nexceeding 10 eV. Besides presenting numerical evidence in simulations, we show\nthat the universal features in this behavior can be understood with simple\nbead-spring models. Fundamentally, our findings imply that it is necessary to\nspecify the boundary conditions for the energy of the lattice defects in the\nbuckled two-dimensional crystals to be uniquely defined, and this may explain\nthe lack of agreement in the reported values of formation energies in graphene.\nWe argue that boundary conditions may also have impact on other physical\nobservables such as the melting temperature.\n", "  In this comment on \"How many principles does it take to change a light bulb\n... into a laser?\" by Howard M. Wiseman, Physica Scripta 91 (3), 033001 (2016)\nI am analyzing this extremely nicely formulated question in the framework of\nthe Hanbury-Brown & Twiss experiment thus celebrating also its 60th\nanniversary. I am giving a straightforward, concise and unique answer on this\nquestion, emphasizing that the intensity correlations or the photon statistics\nmake the difference between a light bulb and a laser.\n", "  We discuss the impact of a tiny Lorentz-violating $b^\\mu$ term on the one\ndimensional motion of a Dirac particle scattering on a rectangular barrier. We\nassume the experiment is performed in a particular inertial frame, where the\ncomponents of $b^\\mu$ are assumed constants. The results show that\nLorentz-violation modification to the transmission rate depends on the observer\nLorentz nature of $b^\\mu$. For a spacelike or lightlike $b^\\mu$ the induced\nresonant frequency shift depends on the polarization, while for timelike\n$b^\\mu$ there is essentially no modification.\n", "  Recently, the different electronic charges, which are related to the\ndifferent coupling constants with magnetic field, in the two-component\nsuperconductor have been studied in frame of Ginzburg-Landau theory. In order\nto study the electronic charges in detail we suggest the wave function in the\ntwo-component superconductor to be coherent state. We find the different\nelectronic charges exist not only in the coherent state but the incoherent\nstate. But the ratio of the different charges in the coherent state is\ndifferent from ratio in the incoherence. The expressions of the coupling\nconstants are given directly based on the coherence effects. We also discuss\nthe winding number in such system.\n", "  Let X be a normal projective Q-Gorenstein variety with at worst log-terminal\nsingularities. We prove a formula expressing the total stringy Chern class of a\ngeneric complete intersection in X via the total stringy Chern class of X. This\nformula is motivated by its applications to mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau\ncomplete intersections in toric varieties. We compute stringy Chern classes and\ngive a combinatorial interpretation of the stringy Libgober-Wood identity for\narbitrary projective Q-Gorenstein toric varieties. As an application we derive\na new combinatorial identity relating d-dimensional reflexive polytopes to the\nnumber 12 in dimension d>3.\n", "  Clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally-bound objects in\nthe Universe and are still forming. They are thus important probes of\ncosmological parameters and a host of astrophysical processes. Knowledge of the\ndynamics of the pervasive hot gas, which dominates in mass over stars in a\ncluster, is a crucial missing ingredient. It can enable new insights into\nmechanical energy injection by the central supermassive black hole and the use\nof hydrostatic equilibrium for the determination of cluster masses. X-rays from\nthe core of the Perseus cluster are emitted by the 50 million K diffuse hot\nplasma filling its gravitational potential well. The Active Galactic Nucleus of\nthe central galaxy NGC1275 is pumping jetted energy into the surrounding\nintracluster medium, creating buoyant bubbles filled with relativistic plasma.\nThese likely induce motions in the intracluster medium and heat the inner gas\npreventing runaway radiative cooling; a process known as Active Galactic\nNucleus Feedback. Here we report on Hitomi X-ray observations of the Perseus\ncluster core, which reveal a remarkably quiescent atmosphere where the gas has\na line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 164+/-10 km/s in a region 30-60 kpc from\nthe central nucleus. A gradient in the line-of-sight velocity of 150+/-70 km/s\nis found across the 60 kpc image of the cluster core. Turbulent pressure\nsupport in the gas is 4% or less of the thermodynamic pressure, with large\nscale shear at most doubling that estimate. We infer that total cluster masses\ndetermined from hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regions need little\ncorrection for turbulent pressure.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to introduce an alternative notion of two-scale\nconvergence which gives a more natural modeling approach to the homogenization\nof partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients:\nwhile removing the bother of the admissibility of test functions, it\nnevertheless simplifies the proof of all the standard compactness results which\nmade classical two-scale convergence very worthy of interest: bounded sequences\nin $L^2_{\\sharp}[Y,L^2(\\Omega)]$ and $L^2_{\\sharp}[Y,H^1(\\Omega)]$ are proven\nto be relatively compact with respect to this new type of convergence. The\nstrengths of the notion are highlighted on the classical homogenization problem\nof linear second-order elliptic equations for which first order boundary\ncorrector-type results are also established. Eventually, possible weaknesses of\nthe method are pointed out on a nonlinear problem: the weak two-scale\ncompactness result for $\\mathbb{S}^2$-valued stationary harmonic maps.\n", "  We derive and study a simple 1D nonlinear model for Edge Localized Mode (ELM)\ncycles. The nonlinear dynamics of a resistive ballooning mode is modeled via a\nsingle nonlinear equation of the Ginzburg-Landau type with a radial frequency\ngradient due to a prescribed ExB shear layer of finite extent. The nonlinearity\nis due to the feedback of the mode on the profile. We identify a novel\nmechanism, whereby the ELM only crosses the linear stability boundary once, and\nsubsequently stays in the nonlinear regime for the full duration of the cycles.\nThis is made possible by the shearing and merging of filaments by the ExB flow,\nwhich forces the system to oscillate between a radially-uniform solution and a\nnon-uniform solitary - wave like solution. The model predicts a 'phase-jump'\ncorrelated with the ELM bursts.\n", "  We study the role of anisotropy on the transport properties of composite\nfermions near Landau level filling factor $\\nu=1/2$ in two-dimensional holes\nconfined to a GaAs quantum well. By applying a parallel magnetic field, we tune\nthe composite fermion Fermi sea anisotropy and monitor the relative change of\nthe transport scattering time at $\\nu=1/2$ along the principal directions.\nInterpreted in a simple Drude model, our results suggest that the scattering\ntime is longer along the longitudinal direction of the composite fermion Fermi\nsea. Furthermore, the measured energy gap for the fractional quantum Hall state\nat $\\nu=2/3$ decreases when anisotropy becomes significant. The decrease,\nhowever, might partly stem from the charge distribution becoming bilayer-like\nat very large parallel magnetic fields.\n", "  The i-V curve describes the current drawn from a flame as a function of the\nvoltage difference applied across the reaction zone. Since combustion\ndiagnostics and flame control strategies based on electric fields depend on the\namount of current drawn from flames, there is significant interest in modeling\nand understanding i-V curves. We implement and apply a detailed model for the\nsimulation of the production and transport of ions and electrons in one\ndimensional premixed flames. An analytical reduced model is developed based on\nthe detailed one, and analytical expressions are used to gain insight into the\ncharacteristics of the i-V curve for various flame configurations. In order for\nthe reduced model to capture the spatial distribution of the electric field\naccurately, the concept of a dead zone region, where voltage is constant, is\nintroduced, and a suitable closure for the spatial extent of the dead zone is\nproposed and validated. The results from the reduced modeling framework are\nfound to be in good agreement with those from the detailed simulations. The\nsaturation voltage is found to depend significantly on the flame location\nrelative to the electrodes, and on the sign of the voltage difference applied.\nFurthermore, at sub-saturation conditions, the current is shown to increase\nlinearly or quadratically with the applied voltage, depending on the flame\nlocation. These limiting behaviors exhibited by the reduced model elucidate the\nfeatures of i-V curves observed experimentally. The reduced model relies on the\nexistence of a thin layer where charges are produced, corresponding to the\nreaction zone of a flame. Consequently, the analytical model we propose is not\nlimited to the study of premixed flames, and may be applied easily to others\nconfigurations, e.g. nonpremixed counterflow flames.\n", "  A classical evolution in chaotic inflationary models starts at high energy\ndensities with semi-classical initial conditions presumably consistent with\nuniversal quantum nature of all the fundamental forces. That is each quantum\ncontributes the same amount to the energy density. We point out the upper limit\non this amount inherent in this approach, so that all the quanta are inside the\nweak-coupling domain. We discuss this issue in realistic models with modified\ngravity, $R^2$- and Higgs-inflations, emphasizing the specific change of the\ninitial conditions with metric frame, while all the quanta still contribute\nequal parts. The analysis can be performed straightforwardly in any model with\nmodified gravity ($F(R)$-gravity, scalars with non-minimal couplings to\ngravity, etc).\n", "  Method of active correlations is a key one to suppress radically beam\nassociated backgrounds in heavy ion induced complete fusion nuclear reactions.\nThis property is enhanced significantly when applying DSSSD detector instead of\nposition sensitive resistive strip detector. Example of application in the\n240Pu+48Ca->114+3n reaction is presented. An edge effect between neighbor\nstrips is considered too. The value of the mentioned effect is measured as 15.9\npercents for ER-alpha correlation chains. C++ Builder GFS2016 program package\nfor spectral analysis is presented. Calibration parameters (totally 352) were\nobtained from natYb+48Ca nuclear reaction. New ultra intense FLNR DC280\ncyclotron that is expected to be put into operation in the nearest future is\nalso discussed from the viewpoint of the described method developments.\n", "  Low energy protons (<100-300 keV) in the Van Allen belt and the outer regions\ncan enter the field of view of X-ray focusing telescopes, interact with the\nWolter-I optics, and reach the focal plane. The use of special filters protects\nthe XMM-Newton focal plane below an altitude of 70000 km, but above this limit\nthe effect of soft protons is still present in the form of sudden flares in the\ncount rate of the EPIC instruments, causing the loss of large amounts of\nobserving time. We try to characterize the input proton population and the\nphysics interaction by simulating, using the BoGEMMS framework, the proton\ninteraction with a simplified model of the X-ray mirror module and the focal\nplane, and comparing the result with a real observation. The analysis of ten\norbits of observations of the EPIC/pn instrument show that the detection of\nflares in regions far outside the radiation belt is largely influenced by the\ndifferent orientation of the Earth's magnetosphere respect with XMM-Newton's\norbit, confirming the solar origin of the soft proton population. The Equator-S\nproton spectrum at 70000 km altitude is used for the proton population entering\nthe optics, where a combined multiple and Firsov scattering is used as physics\ninteraction. If the thick filter is used, the soft protons in the 30-70 keV\nenergy range are the main contributors to the simulated spectrum below 10 keV.\nWe are able to reproduce the proton vignetting observed in real data-sets, with\na 50\\% decrease from the inner to the outer region, but a maximum flux of 0.01\ncounts cm-2 s-1 keV-1 is obtained below 10 keV, about 5 times lower than the\nEPIC/MOS detection and 100 times lower than the EPIC/pn one. Given the high\nvariability of the flare intensity, we conclude that an average spectrum, based\non the analysis of a full season of soft proton events is required to compare\nMonte Carlo simulations with real events.\n", "  This short article was submitted to Nature Physics as a Correspondence. The\nintention was to provide a brief albeit significant criticism of the work of J.\nDunkel and S. Hilbert, \\textit{Consistent Thermostatistics Forbids Negative\nAbsolute Temperatures}, Nature Physics \\textbf{10}, (2014). The respected\neditor decided not to publish the Correspondence. We have therefore decided to\nsubmit the paper to arXiv. Comments/criticisms are welcomed, particularly from\nthe authors of the mentioned paper.\n", "  We study the behaviour of the dynamical and stellar mass inside the effective\nradius (re) of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use several samples of ETGs\n-ranging from 19 000 to 98 000 objects- from the ninth data release of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. We consider Newtonian dynamics, different light\nprofiles and different Initial Mass Functions (IMF) to calculate the dynamical\nand stellar mass. We assume that any difference between these two masses is due\nto dark matter and/or a non Universal IMF. The main results for galaxies in the\nredshift range 0.0024 < z < 0.3500 and in the dynamical mass range 9.5 < log(M)\n< 12.5 are: i) A significant part of the intrinsic dispersion of the\ndistribution of dynamical vs. stellar mass is due to redshift. ii) The\ndifference between dynamical and stellar mass increases as a function of\ndynamical mass and decreases as a function of redshift. iii) The difference\nbetween dynamical and stellar mass goes from approximately 0% to 70% of the\ndynamical mass depending on mass and redshift. iv) These differences could be\ndue to dark matter or a non Universal IMF or a combination of both. v) The\namount of dark matter inside ETGs would be equal to or less than the difference\nbetween dynamical and stellar mass depending on the impact of the IMF on the\nstellar mass estimation. vi) The previous results go in the same direction of\nsome results of the Fundamental Plane (FP) found in the literature in the sense\nthat they could be interpreted as an increase of dark matter along the FP and a\ndependence of the FP on redshift.\n", "  Birefringent metasurfaces are two-dimensional structures capable of\nindependently controlling the amplitude, phase and polarization of orthogonally\npolarized incident waves. In this work, we propose a in-depth discussion on the\nmathematical synthesis of such metasurfaces. We compare two methods, one that\nis rigorous and based on the exact electromagnetic fields involved in the\ntransformation and one that is based on approximate reflection and transmission\ncoefficients. We next validate the synthesis technique in metasurfaces\nperforming the operations of half- and quarter-wave plates, polarization beam\nsplitting and orbital angular momentum multiplexing.\n", "  With the recent development of optomechanics, the vibration in solids,\ninvolving collective motion of trillions of atoms, gradually enters into the\nrealm of quantum control. Built on the recent remarkable progress in optical\ncontrol of motional states of diamonds, here we report an experimental\ndemonstration of quantum teleportation from light beams to vibrational states\nof a macroscopic diamond under ambient conditions. Through quantum process\ntomography, we demonstrate average teleportation fidelity (90.6+/- 1.0)%,\nclearly exceeding the classical limit of 2/3. The experiment pushes the target\nof quantum teleportation to the biggest object so far, with interesting\nimplications for optomechanical quantum control and quantum information\nscience.\n", "  The recent direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black\nhole mergers (2016, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, no. 6, 061102; no. 24, 241103) opens\nup an entirely new non-electromagnetic window into the Universe making it\npossible to probe physics that has been hidden or dark to electromagnetic\nobservations. In addition to cataclysmic events involving black holes, GWs can\nbe triggered by physical processes and systems involving neutron stars.\nProperties of neutron stars are largely determined by the equation of state\n(EOS) of neutron-rich matter, which is the major ingredient in calculating the\nstellar structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational\nwave emission from elliptically deformed pulsars and neutron star binaries.\nAlthough the EOS of neutron-rich matter is still rather uncertain mainly due to\nthe poorly known density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at high\ndensities, significant progress has been made recently in constraining the\nsymmetry energy using data from terrestrial nuclear laboratories. These\nconstraints could provide useful information on the limits of GWs expected from\nneutron stars. Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining\ngravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial\nnuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we\nestimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic\nvalue for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at\ndistances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of\n$\\sim[0.2-31.1]\\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to\ncompute the neutron star properties. Implications are discussed.\n", "  Spatiotemporal solitons (STSs) are localized solitary waves in both space and\ntime that involve complex linear and nonlinear processes. Optical STSs have\nbeen observed in various media, but they are difficult to be realized in\nmultimode fibers due to their large modal dispersion. Here, we report STS\nmode-locking and spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics in a step-index multimode\nfiber mediated by gain. Gain competition and energy redistribution among\ndifferent spatial modes help nonlinearity effectively cancel both temporal\nsplitting and spatial diffracting of the entire pulse (multicomponent soliton)\nand thereby maintain its shape during propagation. Optical STSs in multimode\nfibers therefore open a new way to clarify the fundamental science of\nspatiotemporal solitary waves and also imply important applications in\nmulti-channel communications, optical switches and mode-area power scaling of\nfiber laser pulses.\n", "  By using the M>=5 global earthquake data for Jan. 1950 to Dec. 2015, we\nperformed statistical analyses for the parameters magnitude, time, and depth on\na yearly scale. The magnitude spectrum, which is the earthquake number\naccumulated at different magnitudes, had an exponential distribution. For the\nfirst time, we report a very significant characteristic of the sinusoidal\nperiodic variation in the spectral index. The cycle of the sine function\nfitting was 30.98 years. The concept of annual equivalent total magnitude\n(AETM) of total released energy for each year was introduced and the trend\nvariation of AETM year by year was studied. Overall, the global AETM of\nearthquakes with M>=5 displayed a certain upward trend as the years elapsed. At\nthe same time, the change of the average epicenter depth of the global\nearthquakes (M>=5) in each year was analyzed.\n", "  With the progress of optical detection technology, the classical diffraction\nlimit raised a hundred years ago has been continuously broken through. In\nprevious experiments within fluorescence sources, one of the techniques used is\ndetecting auto-correlation functions. The image is reconstructed by\nsingle-photon and multi-photon detecting intensities. By taking the joint\nintensity of more than one single-photon detectors into consideration, the\npoint spread function of each photon emitter can be resolved even when the\ndistance of their central position is below the classical diffraction limit.\nHowever, the measurement precision is not considered. In actual detecting\nprocess the detectors are imperfect, they have quantum detecting efficiency\n$\\eta$ and even can not count the photon numbers during one absorbing process.\nTherefore, we analyze the detecting intensity of each detector separately and\nuse the total Fisher information to depict the resolution. Higher Fisher\ninformation is obtained when second order correlation function is considered\nand higher detecting efficiency is beneficial to the Fisher information\nenhancement, meanwhile the Cram\\`er-Rao bound for an effective distance\nresolving is lower than the classical diffraction limits. Furthermore, when the\nemitted photons are coherent states, the resolution ability can be enhanced\nwith infinite single-photon detectors.\n", "  The design of the region close to the interaction point of the FCC-ee\nexperiments is especially challenging. The beams collide at an angle (+-15\nmrad) in the high-field region of the detector solenoid. Moreover, the very low\nvertical beta_y* of the machine necessitates that the final focusing\nquadrupoles have a distance from the IP (L*) of around 2 m and therefore are\ninside the main detector solenoid. The beams should be screened from the effect\nof the detector magnetic field, and the emittance blow-up due to vertical\ndispersion in the interaction region should be minimized, while leaving enough\nspace for detector components. Crosstalk between the two final focus\nquadrupoles, only about 6 cm apart at the tip, should also be minimized.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks are a byproduct of the star formation process. In the\ndense mid-plane of these disks, planetesimals and planets are expected to form.\nThe first step in planet formation is the growth of dust particles from\nsubmicrometer-sized grains to macroscopic mm-sized aggregates. The grain growth\nis accompanied by radial drift and vertical segregation of the particles within\nthe disk. To understand this essential evolutionary step, spatially resolved\nmulti-wavelength observations as well as photometric data are necessary which\nreflect the properties of both disk and dust. We present the first spatially\nresolved image obtained with NACO at the VLT in the L$_\\text{p}$ band of the\nnear edge-on protoplanetary disk FS Tau B. Based on this new image, a\npreviously published Hubble image in H band and the spectral energy\ndistribution from optical to millimeter wavelengths, we derive constraints on\nthe spatial dust distribution and the progress of grain growth. For this\npurpose we perform a disk modeling using the radiative transfer code MC3D.\nRadial drift and vertical sedimentation of the dust are not considered. We find\na best-fit model which features a disk extending from $2\\,\\text{AU}$ to several\nhundreds AU with a moderately decreasing surface density and\n$M_\\text{disk}=2.8\\,\\times\\,10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$. The inclination amounts\nto $i=80^\\circ$. Our findings indicate that substantial dust grain growth has\ntaken place and that grains of a size equal to or larger than $1\\,\\text{mm}$\nare present in the disk. In conclusion, the parameters describing the vertical\ndensity distribution are better constrained than those describing the radial\ndisk structure.\n", "  The description of symmetry breaking proposed by K. Symanzik within the\nframework of renormalizable theories is generalized from the geometrical point\nof view. For an arbitrary compact Lie group, a soft breaking of arbitrary\ncovariance, and an arbitrary field multiplet, the expected integrated Ward\nidentities are shown to hold to all orders of renormalized perturbation theory\nprovided the Lagrangian is suitably chosen. The corresponding local Ward\nidentity which provides the Lagrangian version of current algebra through the\ncoupling to an external, classical, Yang-Mills field, is then proved to hold up\nto the classical Adler-Bardeen anomaly whose general form is written down. The\nBPHZ renormalization scheme is used throughout in such a way that the algebraic\nstructure analyzed in the present context may serve as an introduction to the\nstudy of fully quantized gauge theories.\n", "  Generalised Hermite-Gaussian modes (gHG modes), an extended notion of\nHermite-Gaussian modes (HG modes), are formed by the summation of normal HG\nmodes with a characteristic function $\\alpha$, which can be used to unite\nconventional HG modes and Laguerre-Gaussian modes (LG modes). An infinite\nnumber of normalised orthogonal modes can thus be obtained by modulation of the\nfunction $\\alpha$. The gHG mode notion provides a useful tool in analysis of\nthe deformation and transformation phenomena occurring in propagation of HG and\nLG modes with astigmatic perturbation.\n", "  In this Letter, a low-loss Kerr-driven optical filament in Krypton gas is\nexperimentally reported in the ultraviolet. The experimental findings are\nsupported by ab initio quantum calculations describing the atomic optical\nresponse. Higher-order Kerr effect induced by three-photon resonant transitions\nis identified as the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the\nintensity stabilization during the filamentation process, while ionization\nplays only a minor role. This result goes beyond the commonly-admitted paradigm\nof filamentation, in which ionization is a necessary condition of the filament\nintensity clamping. At resonance, it is also experimentally demonstrated that\nthe filament length is greatly extended because of a strong decrease of the\noptical losses.\n", "  We develop models of two-component spherical galaxies to establish scaling\nrelations linking the properties of spheroids at $z=0$ (total stellar masses,\neffective radii $R_e$ and velocity dispersions within $R_e$) to the properties\nof their dark-matter halos at both $z=0$ and higher redshifts. . Our main\nmotivation is the widely accepted idea that the accretion-driven growth of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) in protogalaxies is limited by quasar-mode\nfeedback and gas blow-out. The SMBH masses, $M_{\\rm{BH}}$, should then be\nconnected to the dark-matter potential wells at the redshift $z_{\\rm{qso}}$ of\nthe blow-out. We specifically consider the example of a power-law dependence on\nthe maximum circular speed in a protogalactic dark-matter halo:\n$M_{\\rm{BH}}\\propto V^4_{\\rm{d,pk}}$, as could be expected if quasar-mode\nfeedback were momentum-driven. For halos with a given $V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$ at a\ngiven $z_{\\rm{qso}}\\ge 0$, our model scaling relations give a typical stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ at $z=0$. Thus, they transform a\ntheoretical $M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$ relation into a prediction for an\nobservable $M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$\\sigma_{\\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ relation. We find the latter\nto be distinctly non-linear in log-log space. Its shape depends on the generic\nredshift-evolution of halos in a {$\\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and the systematic\nvariation of stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction at $z=0$, in addition to any\nassumptions about the physics underlying the $M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$\nrelation. Despite some clear limitations of the form we use for $M_{\\rm{BH}}$\nversus $V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$, and even though we do not include any SMBH growth\nthrough dry mergers at low redshift, our results for\n$M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$\\sigma_{\\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ compare well to data for local early\ntypes if we take $z_{\\rm{qso}} \\sim$ 2-4.\n", "  One of the fundamental results in quantum foundations is the Kochen-Specker\nno-go theorem. For the quantum theory, the no-go theorem excludes the\npossibility of a class of hidden variable models where value attribution is\ncontext independent. Recently, the notion of contextuality has been generalized\nfor different operational procedures and it has been shown that preparation\ncontextuality of mixed quantum states can be a useful resource in an\ninformation-processing task called parity-oblivious multiplexing. Here, we\nintroduce a new class of information processing tasks, namely d-level parity\noblivious random access codes and obtain bounds on the success probabilities of\nperforming such tasks in any preparation noncontextual theory. These bounds\nconstitute noncontextuality inequalities for any value of d. For d=3, using a\nset of mutually asymmetric biased bases we show that the corresponding\nnoncontextual bound is violated by quantum theory. We also show quantum\nviolation of the inequalities for some other higher values of d. This reveals\noperational usefulness of preparation contextuality of higher level quantum\nsystems.\n", "  The parametrization of coarse-grained (CG) simulation models for molecular\nsystems often aims at reproducing static properties alone. The reduced\nmolecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit\ninconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to\nsimultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide\nforce fields---one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution\nof CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to\nimprove the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models,\nwhich employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant\nforce-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow\nkinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times\nbetween metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these\nstates. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into\na structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil\ntransition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models\nunderstabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models\nthat improve the ratio of forward/backward timescales by effectively hindering\nthe sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states.\n", "  In this paper we write a system of integral equations for a capacitor\ncomposed by two disks of different radii, generalizing Love's equation for\nequal disks. We compute the complete asymptotic form of the capacitance matrix\nboth for large and small distances obtaining a generalization of Kirchhoff's\nformula for the latter case.\n", "  Charge-carrier transport in a paradigmatic semicrystalline polymer\nsemiconductor (P3HT) is important for both fundamental understanding and\napplications. In samples with enhanced structural disorder due to ad-hoc point\ndefects, the mobility displays rich behavior as a function of electric field\n(F) and temperature (T). At low T, the mobility increases with the applied\nfield, but upon further increasing T, the field-dependence becomes shallower.\nEventually, at the highest T considered, the slope changes sign and the\nmobility then decreases with the field. This phenomenon can be interpreted with\nour model as a result of the competition between intrachain conductive-like\ntransport (which slows on increasing F) and interchain activated transport\n(which is faster at higher F). The former is controlling at high T where\ninterchain hops are strictly limited to nearest-neighbor monomers on adjacent\nchains. At low T, instead, interchain hops to distant sites are allowed and\ncontrol the positive correlation of the mobility with the field.\n", "  Assume that $ACF$ denotes the theory of algebraically closed fields. The\nrenowned theorem of A. Tarski states that $ACF$ admits quantifier elimination.\nIn this paper we give a constructive proof of Tarski's theorem on quantifier\nelimination in $ACF$. This means that for a given formula $\\varphi$ of the\nlanguage of fields we construct a quantifier-free formula $\\varphi'$ such that\n$ACF\\vdash\\varphi\\leftrightarrow\\varphi'$. We devote the last section of the\npaper to show some applications of this constructive version in mathematics and\nphysics.\n", "  This work covers an ab initio calculation of thermodynamic, transport, and\noptical properties of plastics of the effective composition CH$_2$ at density\n0.954 g/cm$^3$ in the temperature range from 5 kK up to 100 kK. The calculation\nis based on the quantum molecular dynamics, density functional theory and the\nKubo-Greenwood formula. The temperature dependence of the static electrical\nconductivity $\\sigma(T)$ has a step-like shape: $\\sigma(T)$ grows rapidly for 5\nkK <= $T$ <= 10 kK and is almost constant for 20 kK <= $T$ <= 60 kK. The\nadditional analysis based on the investigation of the electron density of\nstates (DOS) is performed. The rapid growth of $\\sigma(T)$ at 5 kK<= $T$ <= 10\nkK is connected with the increase of DOS at the electron energy equal to the\nchemical potential $\\epsilon = \\mu$. The frequency dependence of the dynamic\nelectrical conductivity $\\sigma_1(\\omega)$ at 5 kK has the distinct non-Drude\nshape with the peak at $\\omega \\approx 10$ eV. This behavior of\n$\\sigma_1(\\omega)$ was explained by the dip at the electron DOS.\n", "  Coherence of a quantum state intrinsically depends on the choice of the\nreference basis. A natural question to ask is the following: if we use two or\nmore incompatible reference bases, can~there be some trade-off relation between\nthe coherence measures in different reference bases? We show that the quantum\ncoherence of a state as quantified by the relative entropy of coherence in two\nor more noncommuting reference bases respects uncertainty like relations for a\ngiven state of single and bipartite quantum systems. In the case of bipartite\nsystems, we find that the presence of entanglement may tighten the above\nrelation. Further, we find an upper bound on the sum of the relative entropies\nof coherence of bipartite quantum states in two noncommuting reference bases.\nMoreover, we provide an upper bound on the absolute value of the difference of\nthe relative entropies of coherence calculated with respect to two incompatible\nbases.\n", "  Wave packet propagation succeeding electron transfer (ET) from alizarin dye\nmolecules into the nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductor has been studied by\nultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Due to the ultrafast time scale of\nthe ET reaction of about 6 fs the system shows substantial differences to\nmolecular ET systems. We show that the ET process is not mediated by molecular\nvibrations and therefore classical ET theories lose their applicability. Here\nthe ET reaction itself prepares a vibrational wave packet and not the\nelectromagnetic excitation by the laser pulse. Furthermore, the generation of\nphonons during polaron formation in the TiO2 lattice is observed in real time\nfor this system. The presented investigations enable an unambiguous assignment\nof the involved photoinduced mechanisms and can contribute to a corresponding\nextension of molecular ET theories to ultrafast ET systems like alizarin/TiO2.\n", "  A holographic duality is proposed between black hole evaporation in the bulk\nand hadronization (confinement) in dual field theory. Information paradox is\ndiscussed in this duality. We also propose that the recently introduced semi\nblack brane solution is holographically dual to a mixed plasma of quarks,\ngluons and hadrons in global equilibrium.\n", "  We present a new design of a Fourier Domain Mode Locked laser (FDML laser),\nwhich provides a new record in sweep range at ~1um center wavelength: At the\nfundamental sweep rate of 2x417 kHz we reach 143nm bandwidth and 120nm with 4x\nbuffering at 1.67MHz sweep rate. The latter configuration of our system is\ncharacterized: The FWHM of the point spread function (PSF) of a mirror is 5.6um\n(in tissue). Human in vivo retinal imaging is performed with the MHz laser\nshowing more details in vascular structures. Here we could measure an axial\nresolution of 6.0um by determining the FWHM of specular reflex in the image.\nAdditionally, challenges related to such a high sweep bandwidth such as water\nabsorption are investigated.\n", "  The microscopic physics behind the lattice thermal conductivity of NiTiSn is\ninvestigated using first-principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics. The\ncalcu lated lattice thermal conductivity of bulk materials (5.3 W/m.K) is in\ngood agreement with the experimental value at the optimal working temper ature\n(700 K), but is overestimated below this temperature. The calculated values can\nbe strongly affected by the size of the crystalline grains. We show tha t the\nlattice thermal conductivity is dominated by the acoustic (transverse and\nmostly longitudinal) modes with no contribution from the optical modes. The a\ncoustic phonons are located below 150 cm-1 and involve mainly the tin atoms.\nThe calculated mean free path of the most heat carrying phonons is around f\nifty nanometers with a maximum life time of approx. 100 ps. These theoretical\nresults are a step forward in developing the experimental design of low thermal\nconductivity NiTiSn Heusler based materials.\n", "  The Max-Planck institutes for astronomy (MPIA) and for extraterrestrial\nphysics (MPE) run an adaptive optics (AO) system with a laser guide star at the\n3.5 m telescope on Calar Alto, Spain. This system, called ALFA, produces now\nscientific results and works ex- cellent with natural guide stars (NGS) as\nfaint as 13th magnitude in R-band. The ultimate goal however is to achieve\nsimilar performances with the laser guide star (LGS) which is faint and\nextended. We introduce the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor implemented in ALFA\nand present our efforts in increasing its sensitivity by using advanced\ncentroiding and wavefront reconstruction algorithms.\n", "  We have introduced an improved exponential GUP, derived the maximally\nlocalized states, calculated quantum corrections to the thermodynamic\nquantities of the Schwardzschild black hole in our previous work. In this paper\nwe continue to investigate how the maximally localized states and thermodynamic\nquantities such as Hawking temperature, the entropy, the heat capacity, the\nevaporation rate, and the decay time change in the extreme case that the\ninteger n in our GUP rises to infinity.\n", "  The observed correlation of the angular momenta $L^{ik}$ and magnetic moments\n$\\mu_{lm}$ of celestial bodies (the Sun, planets and stars) was discussed by\nmany authors but without any explanation. In this paper a possible explanation\nof this phenomenon is suggested. It is shown that the function $\\Phi_{lm}\n=(\\eta/r_g)L^{ik}R_{iklm}$ satisfy Maxwell equations and can be considered as a\nfunction which determine the electro-magnetic properties of rotating heavy\nbodies. The $R_{iklm}$ is the Riemann tensor, which determines the\ngravitational field of the body, $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the body,\nand $\\eta$ is the constant which has to be determined by observations. The\nfield $\\Phi_{lm}$ describe the observed $\\mu \\leftrightarrow L$ correlation. In\nparticular the function $\\Phi_{l0}$ describe the electric field created by\nrotating heavy bodies. It is possible that the observed electric field of the\nEarth is created by the Earth rotation\n", "  Plasmon in graphene possesses many unique properties. It originates from the\ncollective motion of massless Dirac fermions and the carrier density dependence\nis distinctively different from conventional plasmons. In addition, graphene\nplasmon is highly tunable and shows strong energy confinement capability. Most\nintriguing, as an atom-thin layer, graphene and its plasmon are very sensitive\nto the immediate environment. Graphene plasmons strongly couple to polar\nphonons of the substrate, molecular vibrations of the adsorbates, and lattice\nvibrations of other atomically thin layers. In this review paper, we'll present\nthe most important advances in grapene plasmonics field. The topics include\nterahertz plasmons, mid-infrared plasmons, plasmon-phonon interactions and\npotential applications. Graphene plasmonics opens an avenue for reconfigurable\nmetamaterials and metasurfaces. It's an exciting and promising new subject in\nthe nanophotonics and plasmonics research field.\n", "  Although very similar in many technological applications, graphene and MoS2\nbear significant differences if exposed to humid environments. As an example,\nlubrication properties of graphene are reported to improve while those of MoS2\nto deteriorate: it is unclear whether this is due to oxidation from disulfide\nto oxide or to water adsorption on the sliding surface. By means of ab initio\ncalculations we show here that these two layered materials have similar\nadsorption energies for water on the basal planes. They both tend to avoid\nwater intercalation between their layers and to display only mild reactivity of\ndefects located on the basal plane. It is along the edges where marked\ndifferences arise: graphene edges are more reactive at the point that they\nimmediately prompt water splitting. MoS2 edges are more stable and consequently\nwater adsorption is much less favoured than in graphene. We also show that\nwater-driven oxidation of MoS2 layers is unfavoured with respect to adsorption.\n", "  Anisotropic flow phenomena is a key probe of the existence of Quark-Gluon\nPlasma. Several new observable associated with correlations between anisotropic\nflow harmonics are developed, which are expected to be sensitive to the initial\nfluctuations and transport properties of the created matter in heavy ion\ncollisions. I review recent developments of correlations of anisotropic flow\nharmonics. The experimental measurements, together with the comparisons to\ntheoretical model calculations, open up new opportunities of exploring novel\nQCD dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Complex Langevin simulations provide an alternative to sample path integrals\nwith complex weights and therefore are suited to determine the phase diagram of\nQCD from first principles. We use our proposed method of Dynamic Stabilisation\n(DS) to ensure improved convergence to the right limit and present new\nsystematic tests of this technique. We also show results on QCD in the limit of\nheavy quarks and an analysis of DS compared to known results from reweighting.\n", "  We establish a sharp estimate on the size of the spectral clusters of the\nLandau Hamiltonian with $L^p$ potentials in two dimensions as the cluster index\ntends to infinity. In three dimensions, we prove a new limiting absorption\nprinciple as well as a unique continuation theorem. The results generalize to\nhigher dimensions.\n", "  Nanoscale localization of electromagnetic fields near metallic nanostructures\nunderpins the fundamentals and applications of plasmonics. The unavoidable\nenergy loss from plasmon decay, initially seen as a detriment, has now expanded\nthe scope of plasmonic applications to exploit the generated hot carriers.\nHowever, quantitative understanding of the spatial localization of these hot\ncarriers, akin to electromagnetic near-field maps, has been elusive. Here we\nspatially map hot-electron-driven reduction chemistry with 15 nanometre\nresolution as a function of time and electromagnetic field polarization for\ndifferent plasmonic nanostructures. We combine experiments employing a\nsix-electron photo-recycling process that modify the terminal group of a\nself-assembled monolayer on plasmonic silver nanoantennas, with theoretical\npredictions from first-principles calculations of non-equilibrium hot-carrier\ntransport in these systems. The resulting localization of reactive regions,\ndetermined by hot carrier transport from high-field regions, paves the way for\nhot-carrier extraction science and nanoscale regio-selective surface chemistry.\n", "  Local helioseismology has opened new frontiers in our quest for understanding\nof the internal dynamics and dynamo on the Sun. Local helioseismology\nreconstructs subsurface structures and flows by extracting coherent signals of\nacoustic waves traveling through the interior and carrying information about\nsubsurface perturbations and flows, from stochastic oscillations observed on\nthe surface. The initial analysis of the subsurface flow maps reconstructed\nfrom the 5 years of SDO/HMI data by time-distance helioseismology reveals the\ngreat potential for studying and understanding of the dynamics of the quiet Sun\nand active regions, and the evolution with the solar cycle. In particular, our\nresults show that the emergence and evolution of active regions are accompanied\nby multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the\nNorth-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The\nlatitudinal variations of the meridional circulation speed, which are probably\nrelated to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow\nsubsurface layers. Therefore, these variations do not necessarily affect the\nmagnetic flux transport. The North-South asymmetry is also pronounced in the\nvariations of the differential rotation (\"torsional oscillations\"). The\ncalculations of a proxy of the subsurface kinetic helicity density show that\nthe helicity does not vary during the solar cycle, and that supergranulation is\na likely source of the near-surface helicity.\n", "  We present a simple, scalable synthesis route for producing exchange coupled\nsoft/hard magnetic composite powder that outperforms pure soft and hard phase\nconstituents. Importantly, the composites is iron oxide based (SrFe12O19 and\nFe3O4) and contain no rare earth or precious metal. The two step synthesis\nprocess consists of first precipitating, an Iron oxide/hydroxide precursor\ndirectly on top of SrFe12O19 nano-flakes, ensuring a very fine degree of mixing\nbetween the hard and the soft magnetic phases. We then use a second step that\nserves to reduce the precursor to create the proper soft magnetic phase and\ncreate the intimate interface necessary for exchange coupling. We establish a\nclear processing window; at temperatures below this window the desired soft\nphase is not produced, while higher temperatures result in deleterious reaction\nat the soft/hard phase interfaces, causing an improper ratio of soft to hard\nphases. Improvements of Mr, Ms, and (BH)max are 42%, 29% and 37% respectively\nin the SrFe12O19/Fe3O4 composite compared to pure hard phase (SrFe12O19). We\nprovide evidence of coupling (exchange spring behavior) with hysteresis curves,\nfirst order reversal curve (FORC) analysis and recoil measurements.\n", "  We present the Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) evolutionary tracks of stars with\n0.0065~5.0Ms. The models were evolved from the PMS stellar birthline to the\nonset of hydrogen burning in the core. The convective turnover timescales which\nenables an observational test of theoretical model, particulary in the stellar\ndynamic activity, are also calculated. All models have Sun-like metal\nabundances, typically considered as the stars in the Galactic disk and the star\nformation region of Population I star. The convection phenomenon is treated by\nthe usual mixing length approximation. All evolutionary tracks are available\nupon request.\n", "  The realms of gravitation, belonging to Classical Physics, and\nElectromagnetism, belonging to the Theory of the Electron and Quantum Mechanics\nhave remained apart as two separate pillars, inspite of a century of effort by\nPhysicists to reconcile them. In this paper it is argued that if we extend\nideas of\n  Classical spacetime to include in addition to non integrability non\ncommutavity also, then such a reconcilation is possible.\n"]}
