With these materials, the\nwhispering gallery mode technique is able to resolve changes of a few parts per\nmillion in the permittivity and the microwave losses as compared with those\nmeasured in darkness. A phenomenological model is proposed to explain the\nobserved changes, which result not from direct valence to conduction band\ntransitions but from detrapping and retrapping of carriers from impurity/defect\nsites with ionization energies that lay in the semiconductor band gap.\nDetrapping and retrapping relaxation times have been evaluated from comparison\nwith measured data.\n", "  Thermophotovoltaic devices are energy-conversion systems generating an\nelectric current from the thermal photons radiated by a hot body. In far field,\nthe efficiency of these systems is limited by the thermodynamic\nSchockley-Queisser limit corresponding to the case where the source is a black\nbody. On the other hand, in near field, the heat flux which can be transferred\nto a photovoltaic cell can be several orders of magnitude larger because of the\ncontribution of evanescent photons. This is particularly true when the source\nsupports surface polaritons. Unfortunately, in the infrared where these systems\noperate, the mismatch between the surface-mode frequency and the semiconductor\ngap reduces drastically the potential of this technology. Here we show that\ngraphene-based hybrid photovoltaic cells can significantly enhance the\ngenerated power paving the way to a promising technology for an intensive\nproduction of electricity from waste heat.\n", "  In this work, we analyze the generalization ability of distributed online\nlearning algorithms under stationary and non-stationary environments. We derive\nbounds for the excess-risk attained by each node in a connected network of\nlearners and study the performance advantage that diffusion strategies have\nover individual non-cooperative processing. We conduct extensive simulations to\nillustrate the results.\n", "  We investigated the spin pumping damping contributed by paramagnetic layers\n(Pd, Pt) in both direct and indirect contact with ferromagnetic\nNi$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ films. We find a nearly linear dependence of the\ninterface-related Gilbert damping enhancement $\\Delta\\alpha$ on the heavy-metal\nspin-sink layer thicknesses t$_\\textrm{N}$ in direct-contact\nNi$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/(Pd, Pt) junctions, whereas an exponential dependence is\nobserved when Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ and (Pd, Pt) are separated by \\unit[3]{nm} Cu.\nWe attribute the quasi-linear thickness dependence to the presence of induced\nmoments in Pt, Pd near the interface with Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$, quantified using\nX-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements. Our results show that\nthe scattering of pure spin current is configuration-dependent in these systems\nand cannot be described by a single characteristic length.\n", "  A network has a non-overlapping community structure if the nodes of the\nnetwork can be partitioned into disjoint sets such that each node in a set is\ndensely connected to other nodes inside the set and sparsely connected to the\nnodes out- side it. There are many metrics to validate the efficacy of such a\nstructure, such as clustering coefficient, betweenness, centrality, modularity\nand like-mindedness. Many methods have been proposed to optimize some of these\nmetrics, but none of these works well on the recently introduced metric\nlike-mindedness. To solve this problem, we propose a be- havioral property\nbased algorithm to identify communities that optimize the like-mindedness\nmetric and compare its performance on this metric with other behavioral data\nbased methodologies as well as community detection methods that rely only on\nstructural data. We execute these algorithms on real-life datasets of\nFilmtipset and Twitter and show that our algorithm performs better than the\nexisting algorithms with respect to the like-mindedness metric.\n", "  These are notes for a mini-course of 3 lectures given at the St. Petersburg\nSchool in Probability and Statistical Physics (June 2012). My aim was to\nexplain, on the example of a particular model, how ideas from the\nrepresentation theory of big groups can be applied in probabilistic problems.\n  The material is based on the joint paper arXiv:1009.2029 by Alexei Borodin\nand myself; a broader range of topics is surveyed in the lecture notes by\nAlexei Borodin and Vadim Gorin arXiv:1212.3351.\n", "  We investigate the Kondo effect in a quadruple quantum dot device of\ncoupled-double quantum dots (DQDs), which simultaneously contains intra-DQDs\nand inter-DQDs coupling. A variety of novel behaviors are observed. The\ndifferential conductance dI/dV is measured in the upper DQDs as a function of\nsource drain bias. It is found to exhibit multiple peaks, including a zero-bias\npeak, where the number of peaks exceeds five. Alternatively, tuning the lower\nDQDs yielded regions of four peaks. In addition, a Kondo-effect switcher is\ndemonstrated, using the lower DQDs as the controller.\n", "  We analyse the matrix factorization problem. Given a noisy measurement of a\nproduct of two matrices, the problem is to estimate back the original matrices.\nIt arises in many applications such as dictionary learning, blind matrix\ncalibration, sparse principal component analysis, blind source separation, low\nrank matrix completion, robust principal component analysis or factor analysis.\nIt is also important in machine learning: unsupervised representation learning\ncan often be studied through matrix factorization. We use the tools of\nstatistical mechanics - the cavity and replica methods - to analyze the\nachievability and computational tractability of the inference problems in the\nsetting of Bayes-optimal inference, which amounts to assuming that the two\nmatrices have random independent elements generated from some known\ndistribution, and this information is available to the inference algorithm. In\nthis setting, we compute the minimal mean-squared-error achievable in principle\nin any computational time, and the error that can be achieved by an efficient\napproximate message passing algorithm. The computation is based on the\nasymptotic state-evolution analysis of the algorithm. The performance that our\nanalysis predicts, both in terms of the achieved mean-squared-error, and in\nterms of sample complexity, is extremely promising and motivating for a further\ndevelopment of the algorithm.\n", "  This is a comment on arXiv:1402.6767 (2014) by Y. Imura, T. Okubo, S. Morita,\nand K. Okunishi.\n", "  An algebraic interpretation of the one-variable quantum $q$-Krawtchouk\npolynomials is provided in the framework of the Schwinger realization of\n$\\mathcal{U}_{q}(sl_{2})$ involving two independent $q$-oscillators. The\npolynomials are shown to arise as matrix elements of unitary \"$q$-rotation\"\noperators expressed as $q$-exponentials in the $\\mathcal{U}_{q}(sl_{2})$\ngenerators. The properties of the polynomials (orthogonality relation,\ngenerating function, structure relations, recurrence relation, difference\nequation) are derived by exploiting the algebraic setting. The results are\nextended to another family of polynomials, the affine $q$-Krawtchouk\npolynomials, through a duality relation.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the properties of magnetic reconnection at\nlarge-scale current sheets in a high cadence version of the Lynch & Edmondson\n(2013) 2.5D MHD simulation of sympathetic magnetic breakout eruptions from a\npseudostreamer source region. We examine the resistive tearing and breakup of\nthe three main current sheets into chains of X- and O-type null points and\nfollow the dynamics of magnetic island growth, their merging, transit, and\nejection with the reconnection exhaust. For each current sheet, we quantify the\nevolution of the length-to-width aspect ratio (up to $\\sim$100:1), Lundquist\nnumber ($\\sim$10$^3$), and reconnection rate (inflow-to-outflow ratios reaching\n$\\sim$0.40). We examine the statistical and spectral properties of the\nfluctuations in the current sheets resulting from the plasmoid instability,\nincluding the distribution of magnetic island area, mass, and flux content. We\nshow that the temporal evolution of the spectral index of the\nreconnection-generated magnetic energy density fluctuations appear to reflect\nglobal properties of the current sheet evolution. Our results are in excellent\nagreement with recent, high resolution reconnection-in-a-box simulations even\nthough our current sheets' formation, growth, and dynamics are intrinsically\ncoupled to the global evolution of sequential sympathetic CME eruptions.\n", "  Despite the now vast body of two-dimensional materials under study, bilayer\ngraphene remains unique in two ways: it hosts a simultaneously tunable band gap\nand electron density; and stems from simple fabrication methods. These two\nadvantages underscore why bilayer graphene is critical as a material for\noptoelectronic applications. In the work that follows, we calculate the one-\nand two-photon absorption coefficients for degenerate interband absorption in a\ngraphene bilayer hosting an asymmetry gap and adjustable chemical\npotential--all at finite temperature. Our analysis is comprehensive,\ncharacterizing one- and two-photon absorptive behavior over wide ranges of\nphoton energy, gap, chemical potential, and thermal broadening. The two-photon\nabsorption coefficient for bilayer graphene displays a rich structure as a\nfunction of photon energy and band gap due to the existence of multiple\nabsorption pathways and the nontrivial dispersion of the low energy bands. This\nsystematic work will prove integral to the design of bilayer-graphene-based\nnonlinear optical devices.\n", "  We consider the scenario of thermal transport through two types of Andreev\nquantum dots which are coupled to two leads, belonging to the Class D and Class\nC symmetry classes. Using the random matrix description we derive the joint\nprobability density function (j.p.d.f.) in term of Hypergeometric Function of\nMatrix Arguments when we consider one lead to be attached ideally and one lead\nnon ideally. For the class C ensemble we derive a more explicit representation\nof the j.p.d.f. which results in a new type of random matrix model.\n", "  A Parity-Time (PT)-symmetric system with periodically varying-in-time gain\nand loss modeled by two coupled Schrodinger equations (dimer) is studied. It is\nshown that the problem can be reduced to a perturbed pendulum-like equation.\nThis is done by finding two constants of motion. Firstly, a generalized problem\nusing Melnikov type analysis and topological degree arguments is studied for\nshowing the existence of periodic (libration), shift periodic (rotation), and\nchaotic solutions. Then these general results are applied to the PT-symmetric\ndimer. It is interestingly shown that if a sufficient condition is satisfied,\nthen rotation modes, which do not exist in the dimer with constant gain-loss,\nwill persist. An approximate threshold for PT-broken phase corresponding to the\ndisappearance of bounded solutions is also presented. Numerical study is\npresented accompanying the analytical results.\n", "  Compact objects in general relativity approximately move along geodesics of\nspacetime. It is shown that the corrections to geodesic motion due to spin\n(dipole), quadrupole, and higher multipoles can be modeled by an extension of\nthe point mass action. The quadrupole contributions are discussed in detail for\nastrophysical objects like neutron stars or black holes. Implications for\nbinaries are analyzed for a small mass ratio situation. There quadrupole\neffects can encode information about the internal structure of the compact\nobject, e.g., in principle they allow a distinction between black holes and\nneutron stars, and also different equations of state for the latter.\nFurthermore, a connection between the relativistic oscillation modes of the\nobject and a dynamical quadrupole evolution is established.\n", "  This short paper proposes an alternative theory to Anthropic Principle.\nAccording to our interpretation, the Universe is not \"fine-tuned\" for life, but\n\"roughly-tuned\" for computation and its biofilness is only a phenomenon. This\nstandpoint allows us to extend Seth Lloyd's concept about the ultimate physical\nlimits of computing to examine the computing capabilities of any imaginable\nuniverse. In addition, I draw up a universe classification based on it.\n", "  The Dirac-Dunkl operator on the 2-sphere associated to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$\nreflection group is considered. Its symmetries are found and are shown to\ngenerate the Bannai-Ito algebra. Representations of the Bannai-Ito algebra are\nconstructed using ladder operators. Eigenfunctions of the spherical Dirac-Dunkl\noperator are obtained using a Cauchy-Kovalevskaia extension theorem. These\neigenfunctions, which correspond to Dunkl monogenics, are seen to support\nfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Bannai-Ito algebra.\n", "  The Racah problem for the quantum superalgebra $\\mathfrak{osp}_{q}(1|2)$ is\nconsidered. The intermediate Casimir operators are shown to realize a\n$q$-deformation of the Bannai-Ito algebra. The Racah coefficients of\n$\\mathfrak{osp}_q(1|2)$ are calculated explicitly in terms of basic orthogonal\npolynomials that $q$-generalize the Bannai-Ito polynomials. The relation\nbetween these $q$-deformed Bannai-Ito polynomials and the\n$q$-Racah/Askey-Wilson polynomials is discussed.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to present a result on the existence of Cauchy\ntemporal functions invariant by the action of a compact group of conformal\ntransformations in arbitrary globally hyperbolic manifolds. Moreover, the\nprevious results about the existence of Cauchy temporal functions with\nadditional properties on arbitrary globally hyperbolic manifolds are unified in\na fully general theorem. The article is written as self-contained as possible,\nno prior knowledge on Lorentzian geometry is assumed.\n", "  Particles with directional interactions are promising building blocks for new\nfunctional materials and may serve as models for biological structures.\nMutually attractive nanoparticles that are deformable due to flexible surface\ngroups, for example, may spontaneously order themselves into strings, sheets\nand large vesicles. Furthermore, anisotropic colloids with attractive patches\ncan self-assemble into open lattices and colloidal equivalents of molecules and\nmicelles. However, model systems that combine mutual attraction, anisotropy,\nand deformability have---to the best of our knowledge---not been realized.\nHere, we synthesize colloidal particles that combine these three\ncharacteristics and obtain self-assembled microcapsules. We propose that mutual\nattraction and deformability induce directional interactions via colloidal bond\nhybridization. Our particles contain both mutually attractive and repulsive\nsurface groups that are flexible. Analogous to the simplest chemical bond,\nwhere two isotropic orbitals hybridize into the molecular orbital of H2, these\nflexible groups redistribute upon binding. Via colloidal bond hybridization,\nisotropic spheres self-assemble into planar monolayers, while anisotropic\nsnowman-like particles self-assemble into hollow monolayer microcapsules. A\nmodest change of the building blocks thus results in a significant leap in the\ncomplexity of the self-assembled structures. In other words, these relatively\nsimple building blocks self-assemble into dramatically more complex structures\nthan similar particles that are isotropic or non-deformable.\n", "  Materials exhibiting negative differential resistance have important\napplications in technologies involving microwave generation, which range from\nmotion sensing to radio astronomy. Despite their usefulness, there has been few\nphysical mechanisms giving rise to materials with such properties, i.e. GaAs\nemployed in the Gunn diode. In this work, we show that negative differential\nresistance also generically arise in Dirac ring systems, an example of which\nhas been experimentally observed in the surface states of Topological\nInsulators. This novel realization of negative differential resistance is based\non a completely different physical mechanism from that of the Gunn effect,\nrelying on the characteristic non-monotonicity of the response curve that\nremains robust in the presence of nonzero temperature, chemical potential, mass\ngap and impurity scattering. As such, it opens up new possibilities for\nengineering applications, such as frequency upconversion devices which are\nhighly sought for terahertz signal generation. Our results may be tested with\nthin films of Bi2Se3 Topological Insulators, and are expected to hold\nqualitatively even in the absence of a strictly linear Dirac dispersion, as\nwill be the case in more generic samples of Bi2Se3 and other materials with\ntopologically nontrivial Fermi sea regions.\n", "  Recently, motivated by certain loop quantum gravity inspired corrections, it\nwas shown that for spherically symmetric midisuperspace models infinitely many\nsecond derivative theories of gravity exist (as revealed by the presence of\nthree arbitrary functions in the corresponding Lagrangian/Hamiltonian) and not\njust those allowed by spherically symmetric general relativity. This freedom\ncan be interpreted as the freedom to accommodate certain quantum gravity\ncorrections in these models even in the absence of higher curvature terms (at a\nsemi-classical level, at least). For a particular choice of the arbitrary\nfunctions it is shown that the new theories map to spherically symmetric\ngeneral relativity in arbitrary number of (integer) dimensions thus explicitly\ndemonstrating that when working with midisuperspace models, one loses the\ninformation about the dimensionality of the full spacetime. In addition, it is\nshown that these new theories can accommodate scenarios of fractional spacetime\ndimensions as well as those of emergent spacetime dimensions -- a possibility\nsuggested by various approaches to quantum gravity.\n", "  In this paper, we shall perform a detailed analysis of the Exact Holographic\nMapping first introduced in arXiv:1309.6282, which was proposed as an explicit\nexample of holographic duality between quantum many-body systems and\ngravitational theories. We obtain analytic results for free-fermion systems\nthat not only confirm previous numerical results, but also elucidate the exact\nrelationships between the various physical properties of the bulk and boundary\nsystems. Our analytic results allow us to study the asymptotic properties that\nare difficult to probe numerically, such as the near horizon regime of the\nblack hole geometry. We shall also explore a few interesting but hitherto\nunexplored bulk geometries, such as that corresponding to a boundary critical\nfermion with nontrivial dynamic critical exponent. Our analytic framework also\nallows us to study the holographic mapping of some of these boundary theories\nin dimensions 2+1 or higher.\n", "  The thermodynamic entropy of an isolated system is given by its von Neumann\nentropy. Over the last few years, there is an intense activity to understand\nthermodynamic entropy from the principles of quantum mechanics. More\nspecifically, is there a relation between the (von Neumann) entropy of\nentanglement between a system and some (separate) environment is related to the\nthermodynamic entropy? It is difficult to obtain the relation for many body\nsystems, hence, most of the work in the literature has focused on small number\nsystems. In this work, we consider black-holes --- that are simple yet\nmacroscopic systems --- and show that a direct connection could not be made\nbetween the entropy of entanglement and the Hawking temperature. In this work,\nwithin the adiabatic approximation, we explicitly show that the Hawking\ntemperature is indeed given by the rate of change of the entropy of\nentanglement across a black hole's horizon with regard to the system energy.\nThis is yet another numerical evidence to understand the key features of black\nhole thermodynamics from the viewpoint of quantum information theory.\n", "  Single pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel technique being able to capture 2D\nimages using a bucket detector with high signal-to-noise ratio, wide spectrum\nrange and low cost. Conventional SPI projects random illumination patterns to\nrandomly and uniformly sample the entire scene's information. Determined by the\nNyquist sampling theory, SPI needs either numerous projections or high\ncomputation cost to reconstruct the target scene, especially for\nhigh-resolution cases. To address this issue, we propose an efficient single\npixel imaging technique (eSPI), which instead projects sinusoidal patterns for\nimportance sampling of the target scene's spatial spectrum in Fourier space.\nSpecifically, utilizing the centrosymmetric conjugation and sparsity priors of\nnatural images' spatial spectra, eSPI sequentially projects two\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$-phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns to obtain each Fourier\ncoefficient in the most informative spatial frequency bands. eSPI can reduce\nrequisite patterns by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional SPI,\nwhich helps a lot for fast and high-resolution SPI.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the macroscopic behavior of global energy\nminimizers in the three-dimensional sharp interface unscreened Ohta-Kawasaki\nmodel of diblock copolymer melts. This model is also referred to as the nuclear\nliquid drop model in the studies of the structure of highly compressed nuclear\nmatter found in the crust of neutron stars, and, more broadly, is a paradigm\nfor energy-driven pattern forming systems in which spatial order arises as a\nresult of the competition of short-range attractive and long-range repulsive\nforces. Here we investigate the large volume behavior of minimizers in the low\nvolume fraction regime, in which one expects the formation of a periodic\nlattice of small droplets of the minority phase in a sea of the majority phase.\nUnder periodic boundary conditions, we prove that the considered energy\n$\\Gamma$-converges to an energy functional of the limit \"homogenized\" measure\nassociated with the minority phase consisting of a local linear term and a\nnon-local quadratic term mediated by the Coulomb kernel. As a consequence,\nasymptotically the mass of the minority phase in a minimizer spreads uniformly\nacross the domain. Similarly, the energy spreads uniformly across the domain as\nwell, with the limit energy density minimizing the energy of a single droplets\nper unit volume. Finally, we prove that in the macroscopic limit the connected\ncomponents of the minimizers have volumes and diameters that are bounded above\nand below by universal constants, and that most of them converge to the\nminimizers of the energy divided by volume for the whole space problem.\n", "  The recent demonstration of cooling of a macroscopic silicon nitride membrane\nbased on dissipative coupling makes dissipatively coupled optomechanical\nsystems as promising candidates for squeezing. We theoretically show that such\na system in a cavity on resonance can yield good squeezing which is comparable\nto that produced by dispersive coupling. We also report the squeezing resulting\nfrom the combined effects of dispersive and dissipative couplings and thus the\ndevice can be operated in one regime or the other. We derive the maximal\nfrequency and quadrature angles to observe squeezing for given optomechanical\ncoupling strengths. We also discuss the effects of temperature on squeezing.\n", "  We identify a new class of topologically driven phase transitions when\ncalculating the Hall conductance of two-band Chern insulators in the long-time\nlimit after a global quench of the Hamiltonian. The Hall conductance is\nexpressed as the integral of the Berry curvature in the diagonal ensemble. Even\nif the topological invariant of the wave function is conserved under unitary\nevolution, the Hall conductance as a function of the energy gap in the\npost-quench Hamiltonian displays a continuous but nonanalytic behavior, that is\nit has a logarithmically divergent derivative as the gap closes. The\ncoefficient of this logarithmic function is the ratio of the change of Chern\nnumber in the ground state of the post-quench Hamiltonian to the energy gap in\nthe initial state. This nonanalytic behavior is universal in two-band Chern\ninsulators.\n", "  Recent theoretical studies have predicted magnetic states for Ru and Os in\nthe body centered tetragonal structure (bct) with c/a < 1. In this study, we\npresent first principles calculations of the phonon dispersion for\nferromagnetic Ru- and Os-bct along the epitaxial and uniaxial Bain paths, to\nevaluate their dynamical stability. The phonon dispersions were computed using\nthe density function perturbation theory, including the gradient corrections to\nthe exchange-correlation functional within the plane-waves\nultrasoft-pseudopotential approximation. The phonon dispersion for the local\nminimum in the Bain path with c/a < 1 as well as the uniaxial and epitaxial\nstrained structures are analyzed. We find imaginary frequencies along different\ndirections of the Brillouin zone, which indicates that both systems are\ndynamically unstable. Consequently, ferromagnetic Ru and Os in the body\ncentered tetragonal structure with c/a < 1 are not truly metastable phases.\n", "  From dispersion relation approach, a formalism that describes final state\ninteraction among three particles in a coupled-channel system is presented in\nthis work. Different representations of coupled-channel three-body formalism\nwith only spinless particles in both initial and final states are derived.\n", "  In standard optical tomographic methods, the off-diagonal elements of a\ndensity matrix $\\rho$ are measured indirectly. Thus, the reconstruction of\n$\\rho$, even if it is based on linear inversion, typically magnifies small\nerrors in the experimental data. Recently, an optimal tomography [Phys. Rev. A\n90, 062123 (2014)] has been proposed theoretically to measure one-by-one all\nthe elements of $\\rho$. Thus, the relative errors in the reconstructed state\ncan be the same as those in the experimental data. We implemented this method\nfor two-qubit polarization states performing both local and global\nmeasurements. For comparison, we also experimentally implemented other\nwell-known tomographic protocols based solely on local measurements (of, e.g.,\nthe Pauli operators and James-Kwiat-Munro-White projectors) and those with\nmutually unbiased bases requiring both local and global measurements. We\nreconstructed seventeen of two-qubit polarization states including separable,\npartially and maximally entangled. Our experiments show the highest stability\nagainst errors of our method in comparison to the other quantum tomographies.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that each optimally-reconstructed state} is\nembedded in the uncertainty circle of the smallest radius, both in terms of the\ntrace distance and disturbance. We explain how to estimate experimentally the\nuncertainty radii for all the implemented tomographies and show that, for each\nreconstructed state, the relevant uncertainty circles intersect indicating the\napproximate location of the corresponding physical density matrix.\n", "  Within a mean-field approximation, the ground state and finite temperature\nphase diagrams of the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model have been carefully\nstudied as functions of the Kondo coupling $J$ and the conduction electron\nconcentration $n_{c}$. In addition to the conventional hybridization between\nlocal moments and itinerant electrons, a staggered hybridization is proposed to\ncharacterize the interplay between the antiferromagnetism and the Kondo\nscreening effect. As a result, a heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase is\nobtained and separated from the pure antiferromagnetic ordered phase by a\nfirst-order Lifshitz phase transition, while a continuous phase transition\nexists between the heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo\nparamagnetic phase. We have developed a efficient theory to calculate these\nphase boundaries. As $n_{c}$ decreases from the half-filling, the region of the\nheavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase shrinks and finally disappears at a\ncritical point $n_{c}^{*}=0.8228$, leaving a first-order critical line between\nthe pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo paramagnetic phase for\n$n_{c}<n_{c}^{* }$. At half-filling limit, a finite temperature phase diagram\nis also determined on the Kondo coupling and temperature ($J$-$T$) plane.\nNotably, as the temperature is increased, the region of the heavy fermion\nantiferromagnetic phase is reduced continuously, and finally converges to a\nsingle point, together with the pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo\nparamagnetic phase. The phase diagrams with such triple point may account for\nthe observed phase transitions in related heavy fermion materials.\n", "  There exist a number of experiments/applications where the second dimension\nof the bore of Bitter magnets is not fully utilized. Using an analytical\nsolution for elliptical bore coils, we show that reducing one of the dimensions\nof the bore can lead to considerable decrease in consumed power and/or coil\nmaterial. The results of additional numerical computation show that a 20%\nhigher magnetic field can be achieved for an elliptical bore and racetrack bore\ncoils with 1:10 ratio of the transverse dimensions of the bore than for a\ncircular bore coil with the same larger transverse dimension of the bore,\nconsumed power, and disk area.\n", "  Spinor description for the curvatures of $D=5$ Yang-Mills, Rarita-Schwinger\nand gravitational fields is elaborated. Restrictions imposed on the curvature\nspinors by the dynamical equations and Bianchi identities are analyzed. In the\nabsence of sources symmetric curvature spinors with $2s$ indices obey\nfirst-order equations that in the linearized limit reduce to Dirac-type\nequations for massless free fields. These equations allow for a higher-spin\ngeneralization similarly to $4d$ case. Their solution in the form of the\nintegral over Lorentz-harmonic variables parametrizing coset manifold\n$SO(1,4)/(SO(1,1)\\times ISO(3))$ isomorphic to the three-sphere is considered.\nSuperparticle model that contains such Lorentz harmonics as dynamical\nvariables, as well as harmonics parametrizing the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$ is\nproposed. The states in its spectrum are given by the functions on $S^3$ that\nupon integrating over the Lorentz harmonics reproduce on-shell symmetric\ncurvature spinors for various massless supermultiplets of $D=5$ space-time\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  The Einstein-Hilbert action in the context of Higher derivative theories is\nconsidered for finding out their BRST symmetries. Being a constraint system,\nthe model is transformed in the minisuperspace language with the FRLW\nbackground and the gauge symmetries are explored. Exploiting the first order\nformalism developed by Banerjee et. al. the diffeomorphism symmetry is\nextracted. From the general form of the gauge transformations of the field, the\nanalogous BRST transformations are calculated. The effective Lagrangian is\nconstructed by considering two gauge fixing conditions. Further, the BRST\n(conserved) charge is computed which plays an important role in defining the\nphysical states from the total Hilbert space of states. The finite field\ndependent BRST (FFBRST) formulation is also studied in this context where the\nJacobian for functional measure is illustrated specifically.\n", "  We introduce a general and accurate method for determining lattice phase\nshifts and mixing angles, which is applicable to arbitrary, non-cubic lattices.\nOur method combines angular momentum projection, spherical wall boundaries and\nan adjustable auxiliary potential. This allows us to construct radial lattice\nwave functions and to determine phase shifts at arbitrary energies. For coupled\npartial waves, we use a complex-valued auxiliary potential that breaks\ntime-reversal invariance. We benchmark our method using a system of two\nspin-1/2 particles interacting through a finite-range potential with a strong\ntensor component. We are able to extract phase shifts and mixing angles for all\nangular momenta and energies, with precision greater than that of extant\nmethods. We discuss a wide range of applications from nuclear lattice\nsimulations to optical lattice experiments.\n", "  We present the notion of higher Kirillov brackets on the sections of an even\nline bundle over a supermanifold. When the line bundle is trivial we shall\nspeak of higher Jacobi brackets. These brackets are understood furnishing the\nmodule of sections with an $L_{\\infty}$-algebra, which we refer to as a\nhomotopy Kirillov algebra. We are then to higher Kirillov algebroids as higher\ngeneralisations of Jacobi algebroids. Furthermore, we show how to associate a\nhigher Kirillov algebroid and a homotopy BV-algebra with every higher Kirillov\nmanifold. In short, we construct homotopy versions of some of the well-known\ntheorems related to Kirillov's local Lie algebras.\n", "  In this work we propose an accurate first-principle approach to calculate the\ntransient photo--absorption spectrum measured in Pump\\&\\,Probe experiments. We\nformulate a condition of {\\em adiabaticity} and thoroughly analyze the\nsimplifications brought about by the fulfillment of this condition in the\nnon--equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework. Starting from the\nKadanoff-Baym equations we derive a non--equilibrium Bethe--Salpeter equation\n(BSE) for the response function that can be implemented in most of the already\nexisting {\\em ab--initio} codes. In addition, the {\\em adiabatic} approximation\nis benchmarked against full NEGF simulations in simple model hamiltonians, even\nunder extreme, nonadiabatic conditions where it is expected to fail. We find\nthat the non--equilibrium BSE is very robust and captures important spectral\nfeatures in a wide range of experimental configurations.\n", "  We study effects of classical magnetic impurities on the Anderson\nmetal-insulator transition numerically. We find that a small concentration of\nHeisenberg impurities enhances the critical disorder amplitude $W_{\\rm c}$ with\nincreasing exchange coupling strength $J$. The resulting scaling with $J$ is\nanalyzed which supports an anomalous scaling prediction by Wegner due to the\ncombined breaking of time-reversal and spin-rotational symmetry. Moreover, we\nfind that the presence of magnetic impurities lowers the critical correlation\nlength exponent $\\nu$ and enhances the multifractality parameter $\\alpha_0$.\nThe new value of $\\nu$ improves the agreement with the value measured in\nexperiments on the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in doped semiconductors\nlike phosphor-doped silicon, where a finite density of magnetic moments is\nknown to exist in the vicinity of the MIT. The results are obtained by a\nfinite-size scaling analysis of the geometric mean of the local density of\nstates which is calculated by means of the kernel polynomial method. We\nestablish this combination of numerical techniques as a method to obtain\ncritical properties of disordered systems quantitatively.\n", "  This paper describes a new concept of cellular automaton (CA). XCA consists\nof a set of arcs (edges) that correspond to cells in CA. At a particular time,\nthe arcs are connected to a directed graph. With each time step, the arcs\nexchange their neighbors (adjacent arcs) according to rules that depend on the\nstatuses of the adjacent arcs. An XCA can be used to simulate an artificial\nworld beginning with a Big Bang. In contrast to an CA, an XCA does not require\na grid. However, it can create one, just as the real universe after the Big\nBang generated its own space, which had not excisted previously. Examples using\ndifferent rules reveal the manifold nature of the XCA concept. Similar to John\nConway s well-known The Game of Life simulates birth, survival, and death, this\ngame can simulate a system that begins from a singularity, and evolves into a\ncomplex space.\n", "  Gauge-invariant observables for quantum gravity are described, with explicit\nconstructions given primarily to leading order in Newton's constant, analogous\nto and extending constructions first given by Dirac in quantum electrodynamics.\nThese can be thought of as operators that create a particle, together with its\ninseparable gravitational field, and reduce to usual field operators of quantum\nfield theory in the weak-gravity limit; they include both Wilson-line\noperators, and those creating a Coulombic field configuration. We also describe\noperators creating the field of a particle in motion; as in the electromagnetic\ncase, these are expected to help address infrared problems. An important\ncharacteristic of the quantum theory of gravity is the algebra of its\nobservables. We show that the commutators of the simple observables of this\npaper are nonlocal, with nonlocality becoming significant in strong field\nregions, as predicted previously on general grounds.\n", "  We reconstruct the projected mass distribution of a massive merging Hubble\nFrontier Fields cluster MACSJ0416 using the genetic algorithm based free-form\ntechnique called Grale. The reconstructions are constrained by 149 lensed\nimages identified by Jauzac et al. using HFF data. No information about cluster\ngalaxies or light is used, which makes our reconstruction unique in this\nregard. Using visual inspection of the maps, as well as galaxy-mass correlation\nfunctions we conclude that overall light does follow mass. Furthermore, the\nfact that brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered with mass is an\nimportant confirmation of the standard biasing scenario in galaxy clusters. On\nthe smallest scales, approximately less than a few arcseconds, the resolution\nafforded by 149 images is still not sufficient to confirm or rule out\ngalaxy-mass offsets of the kind observed in ACO 3827. We also compare the mass\nmaps of MACSJ0416 obtained by three different groups: Grale, and two parametric\nLenstool reconstructions from the CATS and Sharon/Johnson teams. Overall, the\nthree agree well; one interesting discrepancy between Grale and Lenstool\ngalaxy-mass correlation functions occurs on scales of tens of kpc and may\nsuggest that cluster galaxies are more biased tracers of mass than parametric\nmethods generally assume.\n", "  We discuss a generic form of the scalar potential appearing in the geometric\nscalar theory of gravity. We find the conditions on the potential by\nconsidering weak and strong gravity. The modified black hole solutions are\nobtained for generic potentials and the inverse problems on a black hole and on\na spherical body (`pseudo-gravastar') are investigated.\n", "  The interface between the two band insulators SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 unexpectedly\nhas the properties of a two dimensional electron gas. It is even\nsuperconducting with a transition temperature, Tc, that can be tuned using gate\nbias Vg, which controls the number of electrons added or removed from the\ninterface. The gate bias - temperature (Vg, T) phase diagram is characterized\nby a dome-shaped region where superconductivity occurs, i.e., Tc has a\nnon-monotonic dependence on Vg, similar to many unconventional superconductors.\nIn this communication the frequency of the quantum resistance-oscillations\nversus inverse magnetic field is reported for various Vg. This frequency\nfollows the same nonmonotonic behavior as Tc; similar trend is seen in the low\nfield limit of the Hall coefficient. We theoretically show that electronic\ncorrelations result in a non-monotonic population of the mobile band, which can\naccount for the experimental behavior of the normal transport properties and\nthe superconducting dome.\n", "  We quantify multiparticle quantum entanglement in a system of N two-level\natoms interacting with a squeezed vacuum state of the electromagnetic field. We\ncalculate the amount of quantum entanglement present among one hundred such\ntwo-level atoms and also show the variation of that entanglement with the\nradiation field parameter. We show the continuous variation of the amount of\nquantum entanglement as we continuously increase the number of atoms from N=2\nto N=100. We also discuss that the multiparticle correlations among the N\ntwo-level atoms are made up of all possible bipartite correlations among the N\natoms.\n", "  Recurrence networks are complex networks, constructed from time series data,\nhaving several practical applications. Though their properties when constructed\nwith the threshold value \\epsilon chosen at or just above the percolation\nthreshold of the network are quite well understood, what happens as the\nthreshold increases beyond the usual operational window is still not clear from\na complex network perspective. The present Letter is focused mainly on the\nnetwork properties at intermediate-to-large values of the recurrence threshold,\nfor which no systematic study has been performed so far. We argue, with\nnumerical support, that recurrence networks constructed from chaotic attractors\nwith \\epsilon equal to the usual recurrence threshold or slightly above cannot,\nin general, show small-world property. However, if the threshold is further\nincreased, the recurrence network topology initially changes to a\nsmall-worldstructure and finally to that of a classical random graph as the\nthreshold approaches the size of the strange attractor.\n", "  When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity, the two systems can exchange a\nsingle photon through a coherent Rabi oscillation. This process enables precise\nquantum-state engineering and manipulation of atoms and photons in a cavity,\nwhich play a central role in quantum information and measurement. Recently, a\nnew regime of cavity QED has been reached experimentally where the strength of\nthe interaction between light and artificial atoms (qubits) becomes comparable\nto the atomic transition frequency or the resonance frequency of the cavity\nmode. Here we show that this regime can strongly modify the concept of vacuum\nRabi oscillations, enabling multiphoton exchanges between the qubit and the\nresonator. We find that experimental state-of-the-art circuit- QED systems can\nundergo two- and three-photon vacuum Rabi oscillations. These anomalous Rabi\noscillations can be exploited for the realization of efficient Fock-state\nsources of light and complex entangled states of qubits.\n", "  We investigate the spatial clustering of dark matter halos, collapsing from\n$1-4 \\sigma$ fluctuations, in the redshift range $0 - 5$ using N-body\nsimulations. The halo bias of high redshift halos ($z \\geq 2$) is found to be\nstrongly non-linear and scale-dependent on quasi-linear scales that are larger\nthan their virial radii ($0.5-10$ Mpc/h). However, at lower redshifts, the\nscale-dependence of non-linear bias is weaker and and is of the order of a few\npercent on quasi-linear scales at $z \\sim 0$. We find that the redshift\nevolution of the scale dependent bias of dark matter halos can be expressed as\na function of four physical parameters: the peak height of halos, the\nnon-linear matter correlation function at the scale of interest, an effective\npower law index of the {\\it rms} linear density fluctuations and the matter\ndensity of the universe at the given redshift. This suggests that the\nscale-dependence of halo bias is not a universal function of the dark matter\npower spectrum, which is commonly assumed. We provide a fitting function for\nthe scale dependent halo bias as a function of these four parameters. Our fit\nreproduces the simulation results to an accuracy of better than 4 % over the\nredshift range $0\\leq z \\leq 5$. We also extend our model by expressing the\nnon-linear bias as a function of the linear matter correlation function. It is\nimportant to incorporate our results into the clustering models of dark matter\nhalos at any redshift, including those hosting early generations of stars and\ngalaxies before reionization.\n", "  Explicit formulae are given for the consistent truncation of massive type IIA\nsupergravity on the six-sphere to the SU(3)--invariant sector of $D=4$ ${\\cal\nN}=8$ supergravity with dyonic ISO(7) gauging. These formulae are then used to\nconstruct AdS$_4$ solutions of massive type IIA via uplift on $S^6$ of the\ncritical points of the $D=4$ supergravity with at least SU(3) symmetry. We find\na new ${\\cal N}=1$ solution with SU(3) symmetry, a new non-supersymmetric\nsolution with SO(6) symmetry, and recover previously known solutions. We\nquantise the fluxes, calculate the gravitational free energies of the solutions\nand discuss the stability of the non-supersymmetric ones. Among these, a\n(previously known) G$_2$--invariant solution is found to be stable.\n", "  Understanding the phase behaviors of nanoconfined water has driven notable\nresearch interests recently. In this work, we examine the structures and\nthermodynamics of water encapsulated under a graphene cover. We find layered\nwater structures up to ~1000 molecules, which is stabilized by the spatial\nconfinement and pressure induced by the adhesion between graphene cover and\nsubstrate. For monolayer encapsulations, we identify both crystalline lattices\nand defects. Free energy analysis shows that these low- entropy orders are\ncompensated by high formation energies. There exists an order- disorder\ntransition for this condensed phase at ~480-490 K, with a sharp reduction in\nthe number of hydrogen bonds and increase in the entropy. These findings offer\nfundamental understandings of the encapsulated water, and provide guidance for\npractical applications with its presence, for example, in the design of\nnanoelectronic devices.\n", "  We prove $L^p$ and smoothing estimates for the resolvent of magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operators. We allow electromagnetic potentials that are small\nperturbations of a smooth, but possibly unbounded background potential. As an\napplication, we prove an estimate on the location of eigenvalues of magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger and Pauli operators with complex electromagnetic potentials.\n", "  It is shown that the normal electron-electron scattering is a source of\nelectrical resistance on non-contact current excitation in two-dimensional\nspin-split electron systems. In contrast to the contact current injection,\nnon-contact current excitation causes spatially inhomogeneous polarization in a\ntwo-dimensional conductor leading to new resistivity mechanisms.\n", "  The volume-dependence of a shallow three-particle bound state in the cubic\nbox with a size $L$ is studied. It is shown that, in the unitary limit, the\nenergy-level shift from the infinite-volume position is given by $\\Delta E=c\n(\\kappa^2/m)\\,(\\kappa L)^{-3/2}|A|^2 \\exp(-2\\kappa L/\\sqrt{3})$, where $\\kappa$\nis the bound-state momentum and $|A|^2$ denotes the three-body analog of the\nasymptotic normalization constant, which encodes the information about the\nshort-range interactions in the three-body system.\n", "  Experimental studies of mantle petrology find that small concentrations of\nwater and carbon dioxide have a large effect on the solidus temperature and\ndistribution of melting in the upper mantle. However, it has remained unclear\nwhat effect small fractions of deep, volatile-rich melts have on melt transport\nand reactive melting in the shallow asthenosphere. Here we present theory and\ncomputations indicating that low-degree, reactive, volatile-rich melts cause\nchannelisation of magmatic flow at depths approximately corresponding to the\nanhydrous solidus temperature. These results are obtained with a novel method\nto simulate the thermochemical evolution of the upper mantle in the presence of\nvolatiles. The method uses a thermodynamically consistent framework for\nreactive, disequilibrium, multi-component melting. It is coupled with a system\nof equations representing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for a\npartially molten grain aggregate. Application of this method in two-phase,\nthree-component upwelling-column models demonstrates that it reproduces\nleading-order features of hydrated and carbonated peridotite melting; in\nparticular, it captures the production of low-degree, volatile-rich melt at\ndepths far below the volatile-free solidus. The models predict that segregation\nof volatile-rich, deep melts promotes a reactive channeling instability that\ncreates fast and chemically isolated pathways of melt extraction. Reactive\nchanneling occurs where volatile-rich melts flux the base of the silicate\nmelting region, enhancing dissolution of fusible components from the ambient\nmantle. We find this effect to be similarly expressed for models of both\nhydrated and carbonated mantle melting. These findings indicate that despite\ntheir small concentrations, water and carbon dioxide have an important control\non the extent and style of magma genesis, as well as on the dynamics of melt\ntransport.\n", "  Standard semiconductor fabrication techniques are used to fabricate a quantum\ndot (QD) made of WS2, where Coulomb oscillations were found. The\nfull-width-at-half-maximum of the Coulomb peaks increases linearly with\ntemperature while the height of the peaks remains almost independent of\ntemperature, which is consistent with standard semiconductor QD theory. Unlike\ngraphene etched QDs, where Coulomb peaks belonging to the same QD can have\ndifferent temperature dependences, these results indicate the absence of the\ndisordered confining potential. This difference in the potential-forming\nmechanism between graphene etched QDs and WS2 QDs may be the reason for the\nlarger potential fluctuation found in graphene QDs.\n", "  In the tunneling framework of Hawking radiation, charged massive particle's\ntunneling in charged non-rotating TeV-Scale black hole is investigated. To this\nend, we consider natural cutoffs as a minimal length, a minimal momentum, and a\nmaximal momentum through a generalized uncertainty principle. We focus on the\nrole played by these natural cutoffs on the luminosity of charged non-rotating\nmicro black hole by taking into account the full implications of energy and\ncharge conservation as well as the back- scattered radiation.\n", "  LaNiO$_3$ (LNO) is an intriguing member of the rare-earth nickelates in\nexhibiting a metal-insulator transition for a critical film thickness of about\n4 unit cells [Son et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 96, 062114 (2010)]; however, such\nthin films also show a transition to a metallic state in superlattices with\nSrTiO$_3$ (STO) [Son et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 202109 (2010)]. In order to\nbetter understand this transition, we have studied a strained LNO/STO\nsuperlattice with 10 repeats of [4 unit-cell LNO/3 unit-cell STO] grown on an\n(LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$AlTaO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrate using soft x-ray\nstanding-wave-excited angle-resolved photoemission (SWARPES), together with\nsoft- and hard- x-ray photoemission measurements of core levels and\ndensities-of-states valence spectra. The experimental results are compared with\nstate-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations of band\nstructures and densities of states. Using core-level rocking curves and x-ray\noptical modeling to assess the position of the standing wave, SWARPES\nmeasurements are carried out for various incidence angles and used to determine\ninterface-specific changes in momentum-resolved electronic structure. We\nfurther show that the momentum-resolved behavior of the Ni 3d eg and t2g states\nnear the Fermi level, as well as those at the bottom of the valence bands, is\nvery similar to recently published SWARPES results for a related\nLa$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattice that was studied using the\nsame technique (Gray et al., Europhysics Letters 104, 17004 (2013)), which\nfurther validates this experimental approach and our conclusions. Our\nconclusions are also supported in several ways by comparison to DFT\ncalculations for the parent materials and the superlattice, including\nlayer-resolved density-of-states results.\n", "  We present a new class of models of lepton flavor in the composite Higgs\nframework. Following the concept of minimality, they lead to a rich\nphenomenology in good agreement with the current experimental picture. Because\nof a unification of the right-handed leptons, our scenario is very predictive\nand can naturally lead to a violation of lepton-flavor universality in neutral\ncurrent interactions. We will show that, in particular, the anomaly in $R_K=\n{\\cal B}(B \\to K \\mu^+ \\mu^-)/{\\cal B}(B \\to K e^+ e^-)$, found by LHCb, can be\naddressed, while other constraints from quark- and lepton-flavor physics are\nmet. In fact, the minimal structure of the setup allows for the implementation\nof a very powerful flavor protection, which avoids the appearance of new\nsources of flavor-changing neutral currents to very good approximation.\nFinally, the new lepton sector provides a parametrically enhanced correction to\nthe Higgs mass, such that the need for ultra-light top partners is weakened\nconsiderably, linking the mass of the latter with the size of the neutrino\nmasses.\n", "  We study the domain wall structure in thin uniaxial ferromagnetic films in\nthe presence of an in-plane applied external field in the direction normal to\nthe easy axis. Using the reduced one-dimensional thin film micromagnetic model,\nwe analyze the critical points of the obtained non-local variational problem.\nWe prove that the minimizer of the one-dimensional energy functional in the\nform of the N\\'eel wall is the unique (up to translations) critical point of\nthe energy among all monotone profiles with the same limiting behavior at\ninfinity. Thus, we establish uniqueness of the one-dimensional monotone N\\'eel\nwall profile in the considered setting. We also obtain some uniform estimates\nfor general one-dimensional domain wall profiles.\n", "  Narrow band electron systems are particularly likely to exhibit correlated\nmany-body phases driven by interaction effects. Examples include magnetic\nmaterials, heavy fermion systems, and topological phases such as fractional\nquantum Hall states and their lattice-based cousins, the fractional Chern\ninsulators (FCIs). Here we discuss the problem of designing models with optimal\nband flatness, subject to constraints on the range of electron hopping. In\nparticular, we show how the imaginary gap, which serves as a proxy for band\nflatness, can be optimized by appealing to Rouche's theorem, a familiar result\nfrom complex analysis. This leads to an explicit construction which we\nillustrate through its application to two-band FCI models with nontrivial\ntopology (i.e. nonzero Chern numbers). We show how the imaginary gap\nperspective leads to an elegant geometric picture of how topological properties\ncan obstruct band flatness in systems with finite ranged hopping.\n", "  We show that distinct emergent symmetries, such as partial dynamical symmetry\nand quasi dynamical symmetry, can occur simultaneously in the same or different\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Implications for nuclear spectroscopy in the\nrare-earth region and for first-order quantum phase transitions between\nspherical and deformed shapes, are considered.\n", "  We consider the inflationary model in which the inflaton $\\phi$ couples to\nanother scalar field $\\chi$ via the interaction $g^2(\\phi-\\phi_0)^2\\chi^2$ with\na small coupling constant $g$ ($g^2 \\sim 10^{-7}$). We assume that there is a\nsequence of \"trapping points\" $\\phi_{0i}$ along the inflationary trajectory\nwhere particles of $\\chi$-field become massless and are rather effectively\nproduced. We calculate the power spectrum of inflaton field fluctuations\noriginated from a backreaction of $\\chi$-particles produced, using the\nSchwinger's \"in-in\" formalism. We show that the primary curvature power\nspectrum produced by these backreaction effects is blue, which leads to a\nstrong overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs) in subsequent radiation\nera.\n", "  The generating functional for scalar theories admits a representation which\nis dual with respect to the one introduced by Schwinger, interchanging the role\nof the free and interacting terms. It maps $\\int V(\\delta_J)$ and $J\\Delta J$\nto $\\delta_{\\phi_c}\\Delta\\delta_{\\phi_c}$ and $\\int V(\\phi_c)$, respectively,\nwith $\\phi_c=\\int J\\Delta$ and $\\Delta$ the Feynman propagator. Comparing the\nSchwinger representation with its dual version one gets a little known relation\nthat we prove to be a particular case of a more general operatorial relation.\nWe then derive a new representation of the generating functional\n$T[\\phi_c]=W[J]$ expressed in terms of covariant derivatives acting on 1 $$\nT[\\phi_c] = {N\\over N_0} \\exp(-U_0[\\phi_c])\\exp\\Big(-\\int V({\\cal\nD}_{\\phi_c}^-)\\Big) \\cdot 1 $$ where ${\\cal\nD}_{\\phi}^{\\pm}(x)=\\mp\\Delta{\\delta\\over\\delta\\phi}(x)+\\phi(x)$. The dual\nrepresentation, which is deeply related to the Hermite polynomials, is the key\nto express the generating functional associated to a sum of potentials in terms\nof factorized generating functionals. This is applied to renormalization,\nleading to a factorization of the counterterms of the interaction. We\ninvestigate the structure of the functional generator for normal ordered\npotentials and derive an infinite set of relations in the case of the potential\n${\\lambda\\over n!}:\\phi^n:$. Such relations are explicitly derived by using the\nFa\\`a di Bruno formula. This also yields the explicit expression of the\ngenerating functional of connected Green's functions.\n", "  Electrified liquids are well known to be prone to a variety of interfacial\ninstabilities that result in the onset of apparent interfacial singularities\nand liquid fragmentation. In the case of electrically conducting liquids, one\nof the basic models describing the equilibrium interfacial configurations and\nthe onset of instability assumes the liquid to be equipotential and interprets\nthose configurations as local minimizers of the energy consisting of the sum of\nthe surface energy and the electrostatic energy. Here we show that,\nsurprisingly, this classical geometric variational model is mathematically\nill-posed irrespectively of the degree to which the liquid is electrified.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that an isolated spherical droplet is never a\nlocal minimizer, no matter how small is the total charge on the droplet, since\nthe energy can always be lowered by a smooth, arbitrarily small distortion of\nthe droplet's surface. This is in sharp contrast with the experimental\nobservations that a critical amount of charge is needed in order to destabilize\na spherical droplet. We discuss several possible regularization mechanisms for\nthe considered free boundary problem and argue that well-posedness can be\nrestored by the inclusion of the entropic effects resulting in finite screening\nof free charges.\n", "  We measure the redshift-space correlation function from a spectroscopic\nsample of 2783 emission line galaxies from the FastSound survey. The survey,\nwhich uses the Subaru Telescope and covers the redshift ranges of\n$1.19<z<1.55$, is the first cosmological study at such high redshifts. We\ndetect clear anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions (RSD) both in the\ncorrelation function as a function of separations parallel and perpendicular to\nthe line of sight and its quadrupole moment. RSD has been extensively used to\ntest general relativity on cosmological scales at $z<1$. Adopting a LCDM\ncosmology with the fixed expansion history and no velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_{\\rm v}=0$, and using the RSD measurements on scales above 8Mpc/h, we\nobtain the first constraint on the growth rate at the redshift,\n$f(z)\\sigma_8(z)=0.482\\pm 0.116$ at $z\\sim 1.4$ after marginalizing over the\ngalaxy bias parameter $b(z)\\sigma_8(z)$. This corresponds to $4.2\\sigma$\ndetection of RSD. Our constraint is consistent with the prediction of general\nrelativity $f\\sigma_8\\sim 0.392$ within the $1-\\sigma$ confidence level. When\nwe allow $\\sigma_{\\rm v}$ to vary and marginalize it over, the growth rate\nconstraint becomes $f\\sigma_8=0.494^{+0.126}_{-0.120}$. We also demonstrate\nthat by combining with the low-z constraints on $f\\sigma_8$, high-z galaxy\nsurveys like the FastSound can be useful to distinguish modified gravity models\nwithout relying on CMB anisotropy experiments.\n", "  The adequacy of the triple-Pomeron interaction approximation (the 3P-model)\nfor description of the high-energy single diffractive dissociation of nucleons\nis analyzed via application to the available experimental data on\nnucleon-nucleon scattering, including the recent results produced by CMS\nCollaboration which allow to estimate reliably the triple-Pomeron coupling\nvalue. It is argued that the total contribution of secondary Reggeon exchanges\nis not negligible up to the Tevatron energy.\n", "  Conformal Galilei Algebras labeled by $d,\\ell$ (where $d$ is the number of\nspace dimensions and $\\ell$ denotes a spin-${\\ell}$ representation w.r.t. the\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ subalgebra) admit two types of central extensions, the\nordinary one (for any $d$ and half-integer $\\ell$) and the exotic central\nextension which only exists for $d=2$ and ${\\ell}\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n  For both types of central extensions invariant second-order PDEs with\ncontinuous spectrum were constructed in [1]. It was later proved in [2] that\nthe ordinary central extensions also lead to oscillator-like PDEs with discrete\nspectrum.\n  We close in this paper the existing gap, constructing \\textcolor{black}{a new\nclass of second-order invariant PDEs for the exotic centrally extended CGAs;\nthey admit a discrete and bounded spectrum when applied to a lowest weight\nrepresentation. These PDEs are markedly different with respect to their\nordinary counterparts. The ${\\ell}=1$ case (which is the prototype of this\nclass of extensions, just like the $\\ell=\\frac{1}{2}$ Schr\\\"odinger algebra is\nthe prototype of the ordinary centrally extended CGAs) is analyzed in detail.\n", "  Local changes in the topology of electricity grids can cause overloads far\naway from the disturbance, making the prediction of the robustness against\nchanges in the topology - for example caused by power outages or grid\nextensions - a challenging task. The impact of single-line additions on the\nlong-range response of DC electricity grids has recently been studied. By\nsolving the real part of the static AC load flow equations, we conduct a\nsimilar investigation for AC grids. In a regular 2D grid graph with cyclic\nboundary conditions, we find a power law decay for the change of power flow as\na function of distance to the disturbance over a wide range of distances. The\npower exponent increases and saturates for large system sizes. By applying the\nsame analysis to the German transmission grid topology, we show that also in\nreal-world topologies a long-ranged response can be found.\n", "  We show a fundamental limitation in the description of quantum many-body\nmixed states with tensor networks in purification form. Namely, we show that\nthere exist mixed states which can be represented as a translationally\ninvariant (TI) matrix product density operator (MPDO) valid for all system\nsizes, but for which there does not exist a TI purification valid for all\nsystem sizes. The proof is based on an undecidable problem and on the\nuniqueness of canonical forms of matrix product states. The result also holds\nfor classical states.\n", "  The effective field theory of cosmic acceleration systematizes possible\ncontributions to the action, accounting for both dark energy and modifications\nof gravity. Rather than making model dependent assumptions, it includes all\nterms, subject to the required symmetries, with four (seven) functions of time\nfor the coefficients. These correspond respectively to the Horndeski and\ngeneral beyond Horndeski class of theories. We address the question of whether\nthis general systematization is actually effective, i.e. useful in revealing\nthe nature of cosmic acceleration when compared with cosmological data. The\nanswer is no and yes: {\\it there is no simple time dependence of the free\nfunctions} -- assumed forms in the literature are poor fits, but one can derive\nsome general characteristics in early and late time limits. For example, we\nprove that the gravitational slip must restore to general relativity in the de\nSitter limit of Horndeski theories, and why it doesn't more generally. We also\nclarify the relation between the tensor and scalar sectors, and its important\nrelation to observations; in a real sense the expansion history $H(z)$ or dark\nenergy equation of state $w(z)$ is $1/5$ or less of the functional information!\nIn addition we discuss the de Sitter, Horndeski, and decoupling limits of the\ntheory utilizing Goldstone techniques.\n", "  In this paper, we consider an exotic baryon (pentaquark) as a bound state of\ntwo-particle systems composed of a baryon (nucleon) and a meson.We used a\nbaryon - meson picture to reduce a complicated five-body problem to a simple\ntwo-body problems. The homogeneous Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is\nsolved in configuration space by using one pion exchange potential. We\ncalculate the masses of pentaquarks $\\theta_{c}(uudd\\bar{c})$,\n$\\theta_{b}(uudd\\bar{b})$.\n", "  There are several inequalities in physics which limit how well we can process\nphysical systems to achieve some intended goal, including the second law of\nthermodynamics, entropy bounds in quantum information theory, and the\nuncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Recent results provide physically\nmeaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one\ncan attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and\nextend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy\ninequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, entropic\ndisturbance, and complete positivity of open quantum systems dynamics. Our\nfirst result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel.\nThis result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a\nsubunital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be\nused as a recovery map to undo the action of the original channel. Our second\nresult regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and\nwith quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain\nimplies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if\nit is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the\ninformation-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with\nquantum side information. Our third result shows that the loss of Holevo\ninformation caused by the action of a noisy channel on an input ensemble of\nquantum states is small if and only if the noise can be approximately corrected\non average. We finally establish that the reduced dynamics of a\nsystem-environment interaction are approximately completely positive and\ntrace-preserving if and only if the data processing inequality holds\napproximately.\n", "  University students taking introductory physics are generally successful\nexecuting mathematical procedures in context, but often struggle with the use\nof mathematical concepts for sense making. Physics instructors note that their\nstudents experience difficulty with basic algebraic reasoning, a foundation on\nwhich more advanced mathematical thinking rests. However, little systematic\nresearch has been done to measure and categorize such difficulties in this\npopulation. This paper describes an investigation of trends in student\nreasoning with proportions, quantification, and symbolizing in introductory\ncalculus-based physics. Although the assessment items used to probe student\nthinking require mathematical reasoning typically taught at the middle school\nlevel in mathematics courses, we find success rates of about 50% among\ncalculus-based physics students. For many of these students, numerical\ncomplexity and the level of abstraction of the quantities interfere with basic\narithmetic reasoning. We argue that the algebraic thinking of physicists stems\nfrom an idiosyncratic cognitive blend, which is not addressed in prerequisite\nalgebra courses. We suggest that for more students to understand and adopt the\nmathematical thinking characteristic of physics, instructors and education\nresearchers must explore how to make mathematization a more explicit part of\nthe curriculum.\n", "  We present a comparative study of nucleon structure such as electromagnetic\nform factors, transverse charge and magnetization densities in three different\nmodels within AdS/QCD framework.\n", "  Magnetic fields generated by human and animal organs, such as the heart,\nbrain and nervous system carry information useful for biological and medical\npurposes. These magnetic fields are most commonly detected using\ncryogenically-cooled superconducting magnetometers. Here we present the frst\ndetection of action potentials from an animal nerve using an optical atomic\nmagnetometer. Using an optimal design we are able to achieve the sensitivity\ndominated by the quantum shot noise of light and quantum projection noise of\natomic spins. Such sensitivity allows us to measure the nerve impulse with a\nminiature room-temperature sensor which is a critical advantage for biomedical\napplications. Positioning the sensor at a distance of a few millimeters from\nthe nerve, corresponding to the distance between the skin and nerves in\nbiological studies, we detect the magnetic field generated by an action\npotential of a frog sciatic nerve. From the magnetic field measurements we\ndetermine the activity of the nerve and the temporal shape of the nerve\nimpulse. This work opens new ways towards implementing optical magnetometers as\npractical devices for medical diagnostics.\n", "  Average block entanglement in the 1D XX-model with uncorrelated random\ncouplings is known to grow as the logarithm of the block size, in similarity to\nconformal systems. In this work we study random spin chains whose couplings\npresent long range correlations, generated as gaussian fields with a power-law\nspectral function. Ground states are always planar valence bond states, and\ntheir statistical ensembles are characterized in terms of their block entropy\nand their bond-length distribution, which follow power-laws. We conjecture the\nexistence of a critical value for the spectral exponent, below which the system\nbehavior is identical to the case of uncorrelated couplings. Above that\ncritical value, the entanglement entropy violates the area law and grows as a\npower law of the block size, with an exponent which increases from zero to one.\nSimilar planar bond structures are also found in statistical models of RNA\nfolding and kinetic roughening, and we trace an analogy between them and\nquantum valence bond states. Using an inverse renormalization procedure we\ndetermine the optimal spin-chain couplings which give rise to a given planar\nbond structure, and study the statistical properties of the couplings whose\nbond structures mimic those found in RNA folding.\n", "  The aim of the study was to investigate surface and buildup region doses for\n6MV and 15MV photon beams using a Markus parallel-plate ionization chamber,\nGafChromic EBT3 film, and MOSFET detector for different field sizes and beam\nangles. The measurements were made in a water equivalent solid phantom at the\nsurface and in the buildup region of the 6MV and 15MV photon beams at 100 cm\nsource-detector distance for 5 x 5, 10 x 10, and 20 x 20 cm2 field sizes and 0,\n30, 60, and 80 beam angles. The surface doses using 6MVphoton beams for 10 x 10\ncm2 field size were found to be 20.3%, 18.8%, and 25.5% for Markus chamber,\nEBT3 film, and MOSFET detector, respectively. The surface doses using 15MV\nphoton beams for 10 x 10 cm2 field size were found to be 14.9%, 13.4%, and\n16.4% for Markus chamber, EBT3 film, and MOSFET detector, respectively. The\nsurface dose increased with field size for all dosimeters. As the angle of the\nincident radiation beam became more oblique, the surface dose increased. The\neffective measurement depths of dosimeters vary; thus, the results of the\nmeasurements could be different. This issue can lead to mistakes at surface and\nbuildup dosimetry and must be taken into account.\n", "  We examine the ultrafast optical response of the crystalline and amorphous\nphases of the phase change material Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ below the phase\ntransformation threshold. Simultaneous measurement of the transmissivity and\nreflectivity of thin film samples yields the time-dependent evolution of the\ndielectric function for both phases. We then identify how lattice motion and\nelectronic excitation manifest in the dielectric response. The dielectric\nresponse of both phases is large but markedly different. At 800 nm, the changes\nin amorphous GST are well described by the Drude response of the generated\nphoto-carriers, whereas the crystalline phase is better described by the\ndepopulation of resonant bonds. We find that the generated coherent phonons\nhave a greater influence in the amorphous phase than the crystalline phase.\nFurthermore, coherent phonons do not influence resonant bonding. For fluences\nup to 50% of the transformation threshold, the structure does not exhibit bond\nsoftening in either phase, enabling large changes of the optical properties\nwithout structural modification.\n", "  We derive a Hamiltonian for an extended spinning test body in a curved\nbackground spacetime, to quadratic order in the spin, in terms of\nthree-dimensional position, momentum, and spin variables having canonical\nPoisson brackets. This requires a careful analysis of how changes of the spin\nsupplementary condition are related to shifts of the body's representative\nworldline and transformations of the body's multipole moments, and we employ\nbitensor calculus for a precise framing of this analysis. We apply the result\nto the case of the Kerr spacetime and thereby compute an explicit canonical\nHamiltonian for the test-body limit of the spinning two-body problem in general\nrelativity, valid for generic orbits and spin orientations, to quadratic order\nin the test spin. This fully relativistic Hamiltonian is then expanded in\npost-Newtonian orders and in powers of the Kerr spin parameter, allowing\ncomparisons with the test-mass limits of available post-Newtonian results. Both\nthe fully relativistic Hamiltonian and the results of its expansion can inform\nthe construction of waveform models, especially effective-one-body models, for\nthe analysis of gravitational waves from compact binaries.\n", "  A quantum superintegrable model with reflections on the three-sphere is\npresented. Its symmetry algebra is identified with the rank-two Bannai-Ito\nalgebra. It is shown that the Hamiltonian of the system can be constructed from\nthe tensor product of four representations of the superalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ and that the superintegrability is naturally understood\nin that setting. The exact separated solutions are obtained through the Fischer\ndecomposition and a Cauchy-Kovalevskaia extension theorem.\n", "  We construct a new class of quantum error-correcting codes for a bosonic mode\nwhich are advantageous for applications in quantum memories, communication, and\nscalable computation. These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite\nsuperposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial\ncodes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in\nbosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and\ndisplacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For\nrealistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform\napproximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between\nerror detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error\nrecovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The\nbinomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means\nof measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of\nthe binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes\nwith even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes\nare related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of\nrequiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as\nthe ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat\ncodes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several\nadvantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate\northonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for\nrepumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are\nrealizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should\nprove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories,\nphotonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and\ndown-conversion.\n", "  Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks plays a\ncrucial role in effective information spreading. A simple strategy is to choose\ntop-$r$ ranked nodes as spreaders according to influence ranking method such as\nPageRank, ClusterRank and $k$-shell decomposition. Besides, some heuristic\nmethods such as hill-climbing, SPIN, degree discount and independent set based\nare also proposed. However, these approaches suffer from a possibility that\nsome spreaders are so close together that they overlap sphere of influence or\ntime consuming. In this report, we present a simply yet effectively iterative\nmethod named VoteRank to identify a set of decentralized spreaders with the\nbest spreading ability. In this approach, all nodes vote in a spreader in each\nturn, and the voting ability of neighbors of elected spreader will be decreased\nin subsequent turn. Experimental results on four real networks show that under\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, VoteRank outperforms the\ntraditional benchmark methods on both spreading speed and final affected scale.\nWhat's more, VoteRank is also superior to other group-spreader identifying\nmethods on computational time.\n", "  We theoretically investigate emergent quantum phases in the thin film\ngeometries of the pyrochore iridates, where a number of exotic quantum ground\nstates are proposed to occur in bulk materials as a result of the interplay\nbetween electron correlation and strong spin-orbit coupling. The fate of these\nbulk phases as well as novel quantum states that may arise only in the thin\nfilm platforms, are studied via a theoretical model that allows layer-dependent\nmagnetic structures. It is found that the magnetic order develop in\ninhomogeneous fashions in the thin film geometries. This leads to a variety of\nmagnetic metal phases with modulated magnetic ordering patterns across\ndifferent layers. Both the bulk and boundary electronic states in these phases\nconspire to promote unusual electronic properties. In particular, such phases\nare akin to the Weyl semimetal phase in the bulk system and they would exhibit\nan unusually large anomalous Hall effect.\n", "  A continuous quantum field, such as a propagating beam of light, may be\ncharacterized by a squeezing spectrum that is inhomogeneous in frequency. We\npoint out that homodyne detectors, which are commonly employed to detect\nquantum squeezing, are blind to squeezing spectra in which the correlation\nbetween amplitude and phase fluctuations is complex. We find theoretically that\nsuch complex squeezing is a component of ponderomotive squeezing of light\nthrough cavity optomechanics. We propose a detection scheme, called synodyne\ndetection, which reveals complex squeezing and allows the accounting of\nmeasurement back-action. Even with the optomechanical system subject to\ncontinuous measurement, such detection allows the measurement of one component\nof an external force with sensitivity only limited by the mechanical\noscillator's thermal occupation.\n", "  Recent work suggests that a sharp definition of `phase of matter' can be\ngiven for some quantum systems out of equilibrium---first for many-body\nlocalized systems with time independent Hamiltonians and more recently for\nperiodically driven or Floquet localized systems. In this work we propose a\nclassification of the finite abelian symmetry protected phases of interacting\nFloquet localized systems in one dimension. We find that the different Floquet\nphases correspond to elements of $\\text{Cl}\\times\\mathcal{A}_G$, where\n$\\text{Cl}$ is the undriven interacting classification, and $\\mathcal{A}_G$ is\na set of (twisted) 1d representations of $G$. We will address symmetry broken\nphases in a subsequent paper.\n", "  We present an experimental realization of resonance fluorescence in squeezed\nvacuum. We strongly couple microwave-frequency squeezed light to a\nsuperconducting artificial atom and detect the resulting fluorescence with high\nresolution enabled by a broadband traveling-wave parametric amplifier. We\ninvestigate the fluorescence spectra in the weak and strong driving regimes,\nobserving up to 3.1 dB of reduction of the fluorescence linewidth below the\nordinary vacuum level and a dramatic dependence of the Mollow triplet spectrum\non the relative phase of the driving and squeezed vacuum fields. Our results\nare in excellent agreement with predictions for spectra produced by a two-level\natom in squeezed vacuum [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{58}, 2539-2542 (1987)],\ndemonstrating that resonance fluorescence offers a resource-efficient means to\ncharacterize squeezing in cryogenic environments.\n", "  We propose a new technique to fully characterize the temporal structure of\nextreme ultraviolet pulses by ionizing a bound coherent electronic wavepacket.\nThe populated energy levels make it possible to interfere different spectral\ncomponents leading to quantum beats in the photoelectron spectrum as a function\nof the delay between ionization and initiation of the wavepacket. The influence\nof the dipole phase, which is the main obstacle for state-of-the-art pulse\ncharacterization schemes, can be eliminated by angle integration of the\nphotoelectron spectrum. We show that particularly atomic Rydberg wavepackets\nare ideal and that wavepackets involving multiple electronic states provide\nredundant information which can be used to cross-check the consistency of the\nphase reconstruction.\n", "  We report on broad-band electron spin resonance measurements performed within\nthe itinerant ferromagnetic phase of $R$CoPO ($R$ = La, Pr, Nd and Sm). We\nreveal that the $R$ substitution is highly effective in gradually introducing a\nsizeable easy-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy within the Co sublattice. We\nexplain our results in terms of a subtle interplay of structural effects and of\nindirect interactions between the $f$ and $d$ orbitals from $R$ and Co,\nrespectively.\n", "  In this paper, we review some general formulations of exact renormalisation\ngroup equations and loop equations for tensor models and tensorial group field\ntheories. We illustrate the use of these equations in the derivation of the\nleading order expectation values of observables in tensor models. Furthermore,\nwe use the exact renormalisation group equations to establish a suitable\nscaling dimension for interactions in Abelian tensorial group field theories\nwith a closure constraint. We also present analogues of the loop equations for\ntensor models.\n", "  We provide a non-technical overview of recent extensions of renormalization\nmethods and techniques to Group Field Theories (GFTs), a class of\ncombinatorially non-local quantum field theories which generalize matrix models\nto dimension $d \\geq 3$. More precisely, we focus on GFTs with so-called\nclosure constraint, which are closely related to lattice gauge theories and\nquantum gravity spin foam models. With the help of recent tensor model tools, a\nrich landscape of renormalizable theories has been unravelled. We review our\ncurrent understanding of their renormalization group flows, at both\nperturbative and non-perturbative levels.\n", "  We make an intensive investigation of the soft mode at the quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) critical point on the basis of the functional\nrenormalization group (FRG) method in the local potential approximation. We\ncalculate the spectral functions $\\rho_{\\sigma, \\pi}(\\omega,\\, p)$ in the\nscalar ($\\sigma$) and pseudoscalar ($\\pi$) channels beyond the random phase\napproximation in the quark--meson model. At finite baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu$ with a finite quark mass, the baryon-number fluctuation is coupled to the\nscalar channel and the spectral function in the $\\sigma$ channel has a support\nnot only in the time-like ($\\omega\\,>\\,p$) but also in the space-like\n($\\omega\\,<\\, p$) regions, which correspond to the mesonic and the\nparticle--hole phonon excitations, respectively. We find that the energy of the\npeak position of the latter becomes vanishingly small with the height being\nenhanced as the system approaches the QCD critical point, which is a\nmanifestation of the fact that the phonon mode is the {\\em soft mode}\nassociated with the second-order transition at the QCD critical point, as has\nbeen suggested by some authors. Moreover, our extensive calculation of the\nspectral function in the $(\\omega, p)$ plane enables us to see that the mesonic\nand phonon modes have the respective definite dispersion relations\n$\\omega_{\\sigma.{\\rm ph}}(p)$, and it turns out that $\\omega_{\\sigma}(p)$\ncrosses the light-cone line into the space-like region, and then eventually\nmerges into the phonon mode as the system approaches the critical point more\nclosely. This implies that the sigma-mesonic mode also becomes soft at the\ncritical point. We also provide numerical stability conditions that are\nnecessary for obtaining the accurate effective potential from the flow\nequation.\n", "  Electrical control of spin signals and long distance spin transport are major\nrequirements in the field of spin electronics. Here we report the efficient\nguiding of spin currents at room temperature in high mobility hexagonal boron\nnitride encapsulated bilayer graphene using carrier drift. Our experiments,\ntogether with modelling, show that the spin relaxation length can be tuned from\n2 to 88 micrometers when applying a DC current of $\\mp$40 uA respectively. Our\nmodel predicts that, extending the range up to $\\mathrm{I_{dc}}=\\mp$150 uA, the\nspin relaxation length can be tuned from 0.6 to 320 um respectively, indicating\nthat spin relaxation lengths in the millimeter range are within scope in near\nfuture with moderate current densities. Our results also show that we are able\nto direct spin currents on either side of a spin injection contact. 98% of the\ninjected spins flow to the left when $\\mathrm{I_{dc}}$= -40 uA and 65% flow to\nthe right when the drift current is reversed. Our model shows that, for\n$\\mathrm{I_{dc}}=\\mp$150 uA the numbers reach 99.8% and 95% respectively\nshowing the potential of carrier drift for spin-based logic operations and\ndevices.\n", "  Near-field cosmology -- using detailed observations of the Local Group and\nits environs to study wide-ranging questions in galaxy formation and dark\nmatter physics -- has become a mature and rich field over the past decade.\nThere are lingering concerns, however, that the relatively small size of the\npresent-day Local Group ($\\sim 2$ Mpc diameter) imposes insurmountable\nsample-variance uncertainties, limiting its broader utility. We consider the\nregion spanned by the Local Group's progenitors at earlier times and show that\nit reaches $3' \\approx 7$ co-moving Mpc in linear size (a volume of $\\approx\n350\\,{\\rm Mpc}^3$) at $z=7$. This size at early cosmic epochs is large enough\nto be representative in terms of the matter density and counts of dark matter\nhalos with $M_{\\rm vir}(z=7) \\lesssim 2\\times 10^{9}\\,M_{\\odot}$. The Local\nGroup's stellar fossil record traces the cosmic evolution of galaxies with\n$10^{3} \\lesssim M_{\\star}(z=0) / M_{\\odot} \\lesssim 10^{9}$ (reaching\n$M_{1500} > -9$ at $z\\sim7$) over a region that is comparable to or larger than\nthe Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) for the entire history of the Universe. It\nis highly complementary to the HUDF, as it probes much fainter galaxies but\ndoes not contain the intrinsically rarer, brighter sources that are detectable\nin the HUDF. Archaeological studies in the Local Group also provide the ability\nto trace the evolution of individual galaxies across time as opposed to\nevaluating statistical connections between temporally distinct populations. In\nthe JWST era, resolved stellar populations will probe regions larger than the\nHUDF and any deep JWST fields, further enhancing the value of near-field\ncosmology.\n", "  We propose a functional architecture of the adult songbird nucleus HVC in\nwhich the core element is a \"functional syllable unit\" (FSU). In this model,\nHVC is organized into FSUs, each of which provides the basis for the production\nof one syllable in vocalization. Within each FSU, the inhibitory neuron\npopulation takes one of two operational states: (A) simultaneous firing wherein\nall inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously, and (B) competitive firing of the\ninhibitory neurons. Switching between these basic modes of activity is\naccomplished via changes in the synaptic strengths among the inhibitory\nneurons. The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such\nthat during state (A) the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while\nduring state (B) patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur.\nThe latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the\ninhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by\nthe manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other.\n  Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We\nillustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics\nof the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that\nare currently testable experimentally. In addition, and standing apart from the\ncore features of an FSU, we propose that the transition between modes may be\ngoverned by the biophysical mechanism of neuromodulation.\n", "  Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a novel computational coherent\nimaging technique for high space-bandwidth product imaging. Mathematically,\nFourier ptychographic (FP) reconstruction can be implemented as a phase\nretrieval optimization process, in which we only obtain low resolution\nintensity images corresponding to the sub-bands of the sample's high resolution\n(HR) spatial spectrum, and aim to retrieve the complex HR spectrum. In real\nsetups, the measurements always suffer from various degenerations such as\nGaussian noise, Poisson noise, speckle noise and pupil location error, which\nwould largely degrade the reconstruction. To efficiently address these\ndegenerations, we propose a novel FP reconstruction method under a gradient\ndescent optimization framework in this paper. The technique utilizes Poisson\nmaximum likelihood for better signal modeling, and truncated Wirtinger gradient\nfor error removal. Results on both simulated data and real data captured using\nour laser FPM setup show that the proposed method outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. Also, we have released our source code for\nnon-commercial use.\n", "  A voltage pulse of a Lorentzian shape carrying a half of the flux quantum\nexcites out of a zero-temperature Fermi sea an electron in a mixed state, which\nlooks like a quasi-particle with an effectively fractional charge $e/2$. A\nprominent feature of such an excitation is a narrow peak in the energy\ndistribution function laying exactly at the Fermi energy $ \\mu$. Another\nspectacular feature is that the distribution function has symmetric tails as\nabove as below $ \\mu$, which results in a zero energy of an excitation. This\nsounds improbable since at zero temperature all available states below $ \\mu$\nare fully occupied. The resolution is lying in the fact that such a voltage\npulse excites also electron-hole pairs which free some space below $ \\mu$ and\nthus allow a zero-energy quasi-particle to exist. I discuss also how to address\nseparately electron-hole pairs and a fractionally charged zero-energy\nexcitation in experiment.\n", "  By modelling heat engines as driven multi-partite system we show that their\ndissipation can be expressed in terms of the lag (relative entropy) between the\nperturbed state of each partition and their equilibrium state, and the\ncorrelations that build up among the partitions. We illustrate the rich\ninterplay between correlations and lags with a two-qubit device driven by a\nquantum gate.\n", "  Typical brain networks consist of many peripheral regions and a few highly\ncentral ones, i.e. hubs, playing key functional roles in cerebral\ninter-regional interactions. Studies have shown that networks, obtained from\nthe analysis of specific frequency components of brain activity, present\npeculiar architectures with unique profiles of region centrality. However, the\nidentification of hubs in networks built from different frequency bands\nsimultaneously is still a challenging problem, remaining largely unexplored.\nHere we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex network\nand face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of\nmultiplex topologies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique\ntopological information, fundamental to accurately model brain functional\nnetworks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex network, in general\ndifferent from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured\nsignals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain's most important\nfunctional regions, allowing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic\npopulations better than conventional network approaches.\n", "  Run-I results from the CMS collaboration show an excess of events in the\ndecay $h \\to \\mu \\tau_e$ with a local significances of 2.4$\\sigma$. This could\nbe the first hint of flavour violation in the Higgs sector. We summarise the\nbounds on the flavour violating Yukawa couplings from direct searches, low\nenergy measurements and projected future experiments. We discuss the\nsensitivity of upcoming HL-LHC runs and future lepton colliders in measuring\nlepton-flavour violating couplings using an effective field theory framework.\nFor the HL-LHC we find limits on BR($h\\to \\mu \\tau$) and BR$(h\\to e \\tau)\n\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(0.5)\\%$ and on BR($h \\to e \\mu) \\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(0.02)\\%$. For an ILC with center-of-mass energy of 1 TeV we expect\nBR($h \\to e \\tau$) and BR($h\\to \\mu \\tau$) to be measurable down to\n$\\mathcal{O}(0.2)\\%$.\n", "  We construct the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action of a real linear multiplet in\n4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Based on conformal supergravity, we derive the\ngeneral condition under which the DBI action can be realized, and show that it\ncan be constructed in the new minimal supergravity. We also generalize it to\nthe matter coupled system.\n", "  Transfer of free energy from large to small velocity-space scales by phase\nmixing leads to Landau damping in a linear plasma. In a turbulent drift-kinetic\nplasma, this transfer is statistically nearly canceled by an inverse transfer\nfrom small to large velocity-space scales due to \"anti-phase-mixing\" modes\nexcited by a stochastic form of plasma echo. Fluid moments (density, velocity,\ntemperature) are thus approximately energetically isolated from the higher\nmoments of the distribution function, so phase mixing is ineffective as a\ndissipation mechanism when the plasma collisionality is small.\n", "  The neck dynamics in Fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions, to probe the nuclear\nsymmetry energy in the domain of sub-saturation densities, is investigated\nwithin an isospin dependent transport model. The single and double ratios of\nneutron/proton from free nucleons and light clusters (complex particles) in the\nisotopic reactions are analyzed systematically. Isospin effects of particles\nproduced from the neck fragmentations are explored, which are constrained\nwithin the midrapidities ($|y/y_{proj}|<$0.3) and azimuthal angles\n(70$^{o}\\sim$110$^{o}$, 250$^{o}\\sim$290$^{o}$) in semiperipheral nuclear\ncollisions. It is found that the ratios of the energetic isospin particles\nstrongly depend on the stiffness of nuclear symmetry energy and the effects\nincrease with softening the symmetry energy, which would be a nice probe for\nextracting the symmetry energy below the normal density in experimentally. A\nflat structure appears at the tail spectra from the double ratio distributions.\nThe neutron to proton ratio of light intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) with\ncharged number Z$\\leq$8 is related to the density dependence of symmetry energy\nwith less sensitivity in comparison to the isospin ratios of nucleons and light\nparticles.\n", "  Recently, two of us have found numerically rotating Ellis wormholes as\nsolutions of 4-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a phantom field. In this\npaper, we investigate possible observational signatures to identify similar\nobjects in the Universe. These symmetric wormholes have a mass and are compact,\nso they may look like black holes. We study the iron line profile in the X-ray\nreflection spectrum of a thin accretion disk around rotating Ellis wormholes\nand we find some specific observational signatures that can be used to\ndistinguish these objects from Kerr black holes. We simulate some observations\nwith XIS/Suzaku assuming typical parameters for a bright AGN and we conclude\nthat current X-ray missions cannot apply strong constraints.\n", "  We study the statistics of increments in record values in a time series\n$\\{x_0=0,x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ generated by the positions of a random walk\n(discrete time, continuous space) of duration $n$ steps. For arbitrary jump\nlength distribution, including L\\'evy flights, we show that the distribution of\nthe record increment becomes stationary, i.e., independent of $n$ for large\n$n$, and compute it explicitly for a wide class of jump distributions. In\naddition, we compute exactly the probability $Q(n)$ that the record increments\ndecrease monotonically up to step $n$. Remarkably, $Q(n)$ is universal (i..e.,\nindependent of the jump distribution) for each $n$, decaying as $Q(n) \\sim\n{\\cal A}/\\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$, with a universal amplitude ${\\cal A} =\ne/\\sqrt{\\pi} = 1.53362\\ldots$.\n", "  Utilizing {\\it ab initio} ultra-high resolution hydrodynamical simulations,\nwe investigate the properties of the interstellar and circum-galactic medium of\nLy$\\alpha$ Blobs (LABs) at $z=3$, focusing on three important emission lines:\nLy$\\alpha$ 1216\\AA, \\heii 1640\\AA\\ and \\civ 1449\\AA. Their relative strengths\nprovide a powerful probe of the thermodynamic properties of the gas when\nconfronted with observations. By adjusting the dust attenuation effect using\none parameter and matching the observed size-luminosity relation of LABs using\nanother parameter, we show that our simulations can reproduce the observed\n\\civ/\\lya\\ and \\heii/\\lya\\ ratios adequately. This analysis provides the first\nsuccessful physical model to account for simultaneously the LAB luminosity\nfunction, luminosity-size relation, and the \\civ/Ly$\\alpha$ and\n\\heii/Ly$\\alpha$ ratios, with only two parameters. The physical underpinning\nfor this model is that, in addition to the stellar component for the \\lya\\\nemission, the \\lya\\ and \\civ\\ emission lines due to shock heated gas are\nprimarily collisional excitation driven and the \\heii\\ emission line\ncollisional ionization driven. We find that the density, temperature and\nmetallicity of the gas responsible for each emission line is significantly\ndistinct, in a multi-phase interstellar and circumgalactic medium that is\nshock-heated primarily by supernovae and secondarily by gravitational accretion\nof gas.\n", "  We define the coherence non-generating channel as the completely positive\ntrace-preserving map which does not generate quantum coherence from an\nincoherent state. The incoherent operations are the strict subset of the\ncoherence non-generating channels. We prove that the relative entropy of\ncoherence is monotonically decreasing under the coherence non-generating\nchannels, while the coherence of formation may increase under such channels.\nInterestingly, by combining mathematically the coherence of formation to the\nentanglement of formation, we show that the coherence of formation of a\nsingle-qubit is never increased by a coherence non-generating channel. This\nleads to the superadditivity property for the coherence increasing power of\nquantum channels, namely, while two channels can not increase coherence\nindividually, they may increase the quantum coherence of a composed system.\nFurther, we derive the general form of the rank-2 coherence non-generating\nqubit channels. Our results contribute to the resource theory of quantum\ncoherence.\n", "  The time delay between the receptions of ultra-relativistic particles emitted\nsimultaneously is a useful observable for both fundamental physics and\ncosmology. The expression of the delay when the particles travel through an\narbitrary spacetime has been derived recently by Fanizza et al., using a\nparticular coordinate system and self-consistent assumptions. The present\narticle shows that this formula enjoys a simple physical interpretation: the\nrelative velocity between two ultra-relativistic particles is constant. This\nresult reveals an interesting kinematical property of general relativity,\nnamely that the tidal forces experienced by ultra-relativistic particles in the\ndirection of their motion are much smaller than those experienced orthogonally\nto their motion.\n", "  Ge under high strain is predicted to become a direct bandgap semiconductor.\nVery large deformations can be introduced using microbridge devices. However,\nat the microscale, strain values are commonly deduced from Raman spectroscopy\nusing empirical linear models only established up to 1.2% for uniaxial stress.\nIn this work, we calibrate the Raman-strain relation at higher strain using\nsynchrotron based microdiffraction. The Ge microbridges show unprecedented high\ntensile strain up to 4.9 % corresponding to an unexpected 9.9 cm-1 Raman shift.\nWe demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the Raman strain relation\nis not linear and we provide a more accurate expression.\n", "  We theoretically study intrinsic superconductivity in doped Dirac semimetals.\nDirac semimetals host bulk Dirac points, which are formed by doubly degenerate\nbands, so the Hamiltonian is described by a $4 \\times 4$ matrix and six types\nof $k$-independent pair potentials are allowed by the Fermi-Dirac statistics.\nWe show that the unique spin-orbit coupling leads to characteristic\nsuperconducting gap structures and $d$ vectors on the Fermi surface and the\nelectron-electron interaction between intra and interorbitals gives a novel\nphase diagram of superconductivity. It is found that when the inter-orbital\nattraction is dominant, an unconventional superconducting state with point\nnodes appears. To verify the experimental signature of possible superconducting\nstates, we calculate the temperature dependence of bulk physical properties\nsuch as electronic specific heat and spin susceptibility and surface state. In\nthe unconventional superconducting phase, either dispersive or flat Andreev\nbound states appear between point nodes, which leads to double peaks or single\npeak in the surface density of states, respectively. As a result, possible\nsuperconducting states can be distinguished by combining bulk and surface\nmeasurements.\n", "  We investigate electron transport through an antidot embedded in a narrow\nstrip of two-dimensional topological insulator. We focus on the most generic\nand experimentally relevant case with broken axial spin symmetry.\nSpin-non-conservation allows additional scattering processes which change the\ntransport properties profoundly. We start from an analytical model for\nnoninteracting transport, which we also compare with a numerical tight-binding\nsimulation. We then extend this model by including Coulomb repulsion on the\nantidot, and we study the transport in the Coulomb-blockade limit. We\ninvestigate sequential tunneling and cotunneling regimes, and we find that the\ncurrent-voltage characteristic allows a spectroscopic measurement of the\nedge-state spin textures.\n", "  Jet substructure techniques such as subjet $p_T$-asymmetry, mass-drop, and\ngrooming have become powerful and widely used tools in experimental searches at\nthe LHC. While these tools provide much-desired handles to separate signal from\nbackground, they can introduce unexpected mass scales into the analysis. These\nscales may be misinterpreted as excesses if these are not correctly\nincorporated into background modeling. As an example, we study the ATLAS\nhadronic di-$W/Z$ resonance search. There, we find that the substructure\nanalysis -- in particular the combination of a subjet asymmetry cut with the\nrequirement on the number of tracks within a jet -- induces a mass scale where\nthe dominant partonic subprocess in the background changes from $pp \\to g \\!+\\!\nq/\\bar q$ to $pp \\to q\\bar{q}$. In light of this scale, modeling the QCD\nbackground using a simple smooth function with monotonically decreasing slope\nappears insufficient.\n", "  Using resonant magnetic x-ray scattering we address the unresolved nature of\nthe magnetic groundstate and the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of\nSm$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, a prototypical pyrochlore iridate with a finite temperature\nmetal-insulator transition. Through a combination of elastic and inelastic\nmeasurements, we show that the magnetic ground state is an all-in all-out\n(AIAO) antiferromagnet. The magnon dispersion indicates significant electronic\ncorrelations and can be well-described by a minimal Hamiltonian that includes\nHeisenberg exchange ($J=27.3(6)$ meV) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n($D=4.9(3)$ meV), which provides a consistent description of the magnetic order\nand excitations. In establishing that Sm$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ has the requisite\ninversion symmetry preserving AIAO magnetic groundstate, our results support\nthe notion that pyrochlore iridates may host correlated Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the massive graviton is a viable candidate\nof dark matter in the context of bimetric gravity. We first derive the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the massive graviton and show that it indeed behaves\nas that of dark matter fluid. We then discuss a production mechanism and the\npresent abundance of massive gravitons as dark matter. Since the metric to\nwhich ordinary matter fields couple is a linear combination of the two mass\neigenstates of bigravity, production of massive gravitons, i.e. the dark matter\nparticles, is inevitably accompanied by generation of massless gravitons, i.e.\nthe gravitational waves. Therefore, in this scenario some information about\ndark matter in our universe is encoded in gravitational waves. For instance, if\nLIGO detects gravitational waves generated by the preheating after inflation\nthen the massive graviton with the mass of $\\sim 0.01$ GeV is a candidate of\nthe dark matter.\n", "  The physics of cosmic rays (CR) is a promising candidate for explaining the\ndriving of galactic winds and outflows. Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion.\n", "  Effects of local lattice distortions on the spin ordering are investigated\nfor the antiferromagnetic classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice.\nIt is found by Monte Carlo simulations that the spin-lattice coupling (SLC)\noriginating from site phonons induces a first-order transition into two\ndifferent types of collinear magnetic ordered states. The state realized at\nstronger SLC is cubic symmetric characterized by the magnetic (1/2,1/2,1/2)\nBragg peaks, while that at weaker SLC is tetragonal symmetric characterized by\nthe (1,1,0) ones, each accompanied by the commensurate local lattice\ndistortions. Experimental implications to chromium spinels are discussed.\n", "  We consider special supersymmetry (SUSY) transformations with $m$ generators\n$\\overleftarrow{s}_{\\alpha }$ for a certain class of models and study some\nphysical consequences of Grassmann-odd transformations which form an Abelian\nsupergroup with finite parameters and respective group-like elements being\nfunctionals of field variables. The SUSY-invariant path integral measure within\nconventional quantization implies the appearance, under a change of variables\nrelated to such SUSY transformations, of a Jacobian which is explicitly\ncalculated. The Jacobian implies, first of all, the appearance of trivial\ninteractions in the transformed action, and, second, the presence of a modified\nWard identity which reduces to the standard Ward identities in the case of\nconstant parameters. We examine the case of ${N}=1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric\nharmonic oscillators to illustrate the general concept by a simple free model\nwith $(1,1)$ physical degrees of freedom. It is shown that the interaction\nterms $U_{tr}$ have a corresponding SUSY-exact form: $U_{tr}=%\n\\big(V_{(1)}\\overleftarrow{s};V_{(2)}\\overleftarrow{\\bar{s}}\\overleftarrow{s}%\n\\big)$ naturally generated in this generalized formulation. We argue that the\ncase of non-trivial interactions cannot be obtained in such a way.\n", "  We present deep Near-infrared (NIR) images of a sample of 19\nintermediate-redshift ($0.3<z<1.0$) radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nwith powerful relativistic jets ($L_{1.4GHz} >10^{27}$ WHz$^{-1}$), previously\nclassified as flat-spectrum radio quasars. We also compile host galaxy and\nnuclear magnitudes for blazars from literature. The combined sample (this work\nand compilation) contains 100 radio-loud AGN with host galaxy detections and a\nbroad range of radio luminosities $L_{1.4GHz} \\sim 10^{23.7} -\n10^{28.3}$~WHz$^{-1}$, allowing us to divide our sample into high-luminosity\nblazars (HLBs) and low-luminosity blazars (LLBs). The host galaxies of our\nsample are bright and seem to follow the $\\mu_{e}$-$R_{eff}$ relation for\nellipticals and bulges. The two populations of blazars show different\nbehaviours in the \\mnuc - \\mbulge plane, where a statistically significant\ncorrelation is observed for HLBs. Although it may be affected by selection\neffects, this correlation suggests a close coupling between the accretion mode\nof the central supermassive black hole and its host galaxy, that could be\ninterpreted in terms of AGN feedback. Our findings are consistent with\nsemi--analytical models where low--luminosity AGN emit the bulk of their energy\nin the form of radio jets, producing a strong feedback mechanism, and\nhigh--luminosity AGN are affected by galaxy mergers and interactions, which\nprovide a common supply of cold gas to feed both nuclear activity and star\nformation episodes.\n", "  We present a set of NLO SUSY-QCD calculations for the pair production of\nneutralinos and charginos at the LHC, and their matching to parton-shower\nprograms in the framework of the POWHEG-BOX program package. The code we have\ndeveloped provides a SUSY Les Houches Accord interface for setting\nsupersymmetric input parameters. Decays of the neutralinos and charginos and\nparton-shower effects can be simulated with PYTHIA. To illustrate the\ncapabilities of our program, we present phenomenological results for a\nrepresentative SUSY parameter point. We find that NLO-QCD corrections increase\nthe production rates for neutralinos and charginos significantly. The impact of\nparton-shower effects on distributions of the weakinos is small, but\nnon-negligible for jet distributions.\n", "  Metallic glasses have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to\ntheir unique combination of superb properties and processability. Predicting\nbulk metallic glass formers from known parameters remains a challenge and the\nsearch for new systems is still performed by trial and error. It has been\nspeculated that some sort of \"confusion\" during crystallization of the\ncrystalline phases competing with glass formation could play a key role. Here,\nwe propose a heuristic descriptor quantifying confusion and demonstrate its\nvalidity by detailed experiments on two well-known glass forming alloy systems.\nWith the insight provided by these results, we develop a robust model for\npredicting glass formation ability based on the spectral decomposition of\ngeometrical and energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab-initio\nin the AFLOW high throughput framework. Our findings indicate that the\nformation of metallic glass phases could be a much more common phenomenon than\ncurrently estimated, with more than 17% of binary alloy systems being potential\nglass formers. Our approach is capable of pinpointing favorable compositions,\novercoming a major bottleneck hindering the discovery of new materials. Hence,\nit is demonstrated that smart descriptors, based solely on the energetics and\nstructure of competing crystalline phases calculated from first-principles and\navailable in online databases, others the sought-after key for accelerated\ndiscovery of novel metallic glasses.\n", "  The existence of an undetectable eavesdropping of dense coded information has\nbeen already demonstrated by Pavi\\v{c}i\\'c for the quantum direct communication\nbased on the ping-pong paradigm. However, a) the explicit scheme of the circuit\nis only given and no design rules are provided, b) the existence of losses is\nimplicitly assumed, c) the attack has been formulated against qubit based\nprotocol only and it is not clear whether it can be adapted to higher\ndimensional systems. These deficiencies are removed in the presented\ncontribution. A new generic eavesdropping scheme built on a firm theoretical\nbackground is proposed. In contrast to the previous approach, it does not refer\nto the properties of the vacuum state, so it is fully consistent with the\nabsence of losses assumption. Moreover, the scheme applies to the communication\nparadigm based on signal particles of any dimensionality. It is also shown that\nsome well known attacks are special cases of the proposed scheme.\n", "  We introduce a covariant approach in Minkowski space for the description of\nquarks and mesons that exhibits both chiral-symmetry breaking and confinement.\nIn a simple model for the interquark interaction the quark mass function is\nobtained and used in the calculation of the pion form factor. We study the\neffects of the mass function and of the different quark pole contributions on\nthe pion form factor.\n", "  We analyze the divergent zero-point energy of a dilute and ultracold gas of\natoms in D spatial dimensions. For bosonic atoms we explicitly show how to\nregularize this divergent contribution, which appears in the Gaussian\nfluctuations of the functional integration, by using three different\nregularization approaches: dimensional regularization, momentum-cutoff\nregularization and convergence-factor regularization. In the case of the ideal\nBose gas the divergent zero-point fluctuations are completely removed, while in\nthe case of the interacting Bose gas these zero-point fluctuations give rise to\na finite correction to the equation of state. The final convergent equation of\nstate is independent of the regularization procedure but depends on the\ndimensionality of the system and the two-dimensional case is highly nontrivial.\nWe also discuss very recent theoretical results on the divergent zero-point\nenergy of the D-dimensional superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover. In\nthis case the zero-point energy is due to both fermionic single-particle\nexcitations and bosonic collective excitations, and its regularization gives\nremarkable analytical results in the BEC regime of composite bosons. We compare\nthe beyond-mean-field equations of state of both bosons and fermions with\nrelevant experimental data on dilute and ultracold atoms quantitatively\nconfirming the contribution of zero-point-energy quantum fluctuations to the\nthermodynamics of ultracold atoms at very low temperatures.\n", "  In this study, we solve analytically the Schrodinger equation for a\nmacroscopic quantum oscillator as a central system coupled to two environmental\nmicro-oscillating particles. Then, the double-slit interference patterns are\ninvestigated in two limiting cases, considering the limits of uncertainty in\nthe position probability distribution. Moreover, we analyze the interference\npatterns based on a recent proposal called stochastic electrodynamics with\nspin. Our results show that when the quantum character of the macro-system is\ndecreased, the diffraction pattern becomes more similar to a classical one. We\nalso show that, depending on the size of the slits, the predictions of quantum\napproach could be apparently different with those of the aforementioned\nstochastic description\n", "  We investigate the spectral geometry and spectral action functionals\nassociated to 1D Supersymmetry Algebras, using the classification of these\nsuperalgebras in terms of Adinkra graphs and the construction of associated\ndessin d'enfant and origami curves. The resulting spectral action functionals\nare computed in terms of the Selberg (super) trace formula.\n", "  We study the volume distribution of nodal domains of random band-limited\nfunctions on generic manifolds, and find that in the high energy limit a\ntypical instance obeys a deterministic universal law, independent of the\nmanifold. Some of the basic qualitative properties of this law, such as its\nsupport, monotonicity and continuity of the cumulative probability function,\nare established.\n", "  Tuning of the electronic properties of heavy fermion compounds by chemical\nsubstitutions provides excellent opportunities to further understand the\nphysics of hybridized ions in crystal lattices. Here we present an\ninvestigation on the effects of Cd doping in flux-grown single crystals of the\ncomplex intermetallic cage compound YbFe$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$, that has been\ndescribed as a heavy fermion with Sommerfeld coefficient of 535 mJ/mol.K$^{2}$.\nSubstitution of Cd for Zn disturbs the system by expanding the unit cell and,\nin this case, the size of the Zn cages that surround Yb and Fe. With increasing\namount of Cd, the hybridization between Yb $4f$ electrons and the conduction\nelectrons is weakened, as evidenced by a decrease in the Sommerfeld\ncoefficient, which should be accompanied by a valence shift of the Yb$^{3+}$\ndue to the negative chemical pressure effect. This scenario is also supported\nby the low temperature dc-magnetic susceptibility, that is gradually suppressed\nand evidences an increment of the Kondo temperature, based on a shift to higher\ntemperatures of the characteristic broad susceptibility peak. Furthermore, the\nDC resistivity decreases with the isoelectronic Cd substitution for Zn,\ncontrary to the expectation for an increasingly disordered system, and implying\nthat the valence shift is not related to charge carrier doping. The combined\nresults demonstrate excellent complementarity between positive physical\npressure and negative chemical pressure, and point to a rich playground for\nexploring the physics and chemistry of strongly correlated electron systems in\nthe general family of Zn$_{20}$ compounds, despite their structural complexity.\n", "  We present the discovery of a new, peculiar form of double-periodic pulsation\nin RR Lyrae stars. In four, long-period ($P>0.6$ d) stars observed by the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, and classified as fundamental mode\npulsators (RRab), we detect additional, low-amplitude variability, with period\nshorter than fundamental mode period. The period ratios fall in a range similar\nto double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the\nexception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and\nnearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the\nfour stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental\nmode are very similar. The peak-to-peak amplitudes and amplitude ratios\n(Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $R_{31}$) are among the highest observed in\nRRab stars of similar period, while Fourier phases ($\\varphi_{21}$ and\n$\\varphi_{31}$) are among the lowest observed in RRab stars.\n  If the additional variability is interpreted as due to radial first overtone,\nthen, the four stars are the most extreme RRd variables of the longest\npulsation periods known. Indeed, the observed period ratios can be well\nmodelled with high metallicity pulsation models. However, at such long\npulsation periods, first overtone is typically damped.\n  Five other candidates, with weak signature of additional variability, sharing\nthe same characteristics, were also detected and are briefly discussed.\n", "  The quasi-degeneracy between the single-particle states $(n,\\,l,\\,j=l+1/2)$\nand $(n-1,\\,l+2,\\,j=l+3/2)$ indicates a special and hidden symmetry in atomic\nnuclei---the so-called pseudospin symmetry (PSS)---which is an important\nconcept in both spherical and deformed nuclei. A number of phenomena in nuclear\nstructure have been successfully interpreted directly or implicitly by this\nsymmetry, including nuclear superdeformed configurations, identical bands,\nquantized alignment, pseudospin partner bands, and so on. Since the PSS was\nrecognized as a relativistic symmetry in 1990s, there have been comprehensive\nefforts to understand its properties in various systems and potentials. In this\nReview, we mainly focus on the latest progress on the supersymmetric (SUSY)\nrepresentation of PSS, and one of the key targets is to understand its\nsymmetry-breaking mechanism in realistic nuclei in a quantitative and\nperturbative way. The SUSY quantum mechanics and its applications to the SU(2)\nand U(3) symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian are discussed in detail. It is\nshown that the origin of PSS and its symmetry-breaking mechanism, which are\ndeeply hidden in the origin Hamiltonian, can be traced by its SUSY partner\nHamiltonian. Essential open questions, such as the SUSY representation of PSS\nin the deformed system, are pointed out.\n", "  A new nano-lithography technique compatible with conducting oxide interfaces,\nwhich requires a single lithographic step with no additional amorphous layer\ndeposition or etching, is presented. It is demonstrated on SrTiO3/LaAlO3\ninterface where a constriction is patterned in the electron liquid. We find\nthat an additional back-gating can further confine the electron liquid into an\nisolated island. Conductance and differential conductance measurements show\nresonant tunneling through the island. The data at various temperatures and\nmagnetic fields are analyzed and the effective island size is found to be of\nthe order of 10nm. The magnetic field dependence suggests absence of spin\ndegeneracy in the island. Our method is suitable for creating superconducting\nand oxide-interface based electronic devices.\n", "  Cleavage crack propagation has been investigated in a low-carbon\nlath-martensitic steel using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The\nability of different martensitic boundaries within prior-austenite grain, such\nas sub-block, block and packet boundaries to resist cleavage crack propagation\nhas been estimated in terms of Kurdjumov-Sachs crystallographic variants.\nCrystallographic study of crack path indicated that block boundaries are more\neffective in cleavage crack deviation as compared to packet boundaries, whilst\nsub-block boundaries are ineffective in that respect. Moreover, characterizing\nthe boundaries in terms of misorientation angle (angle-axis pair) may be\nmisleading if their effectiveness in retarding cleavage crack propagation is\nconsidered.\n", "  The set of supernova remnants (SNR) from Green's SNR catalog which are found\nin the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) are the objects considered in this\nstudy. For these SNR, we extract and analyse HI absorption spectra in a uniform\nway and construct a catalogue of absorption spectra and distance\ndeterminations.\n", "  A cluster-transfer experiment of\n$^9\\rm{Be}(^9\\rm{Be},^{14}\\rm{C}\\rightarrow\\alpha+^{10}\\rm{Be})\\alpha$ at an\nincident energy of 45 MeV was carried out in order to investigate the molecular\nstructure in high-lying resonant states in $^{14}$C. This reaction is of\nextremely large $Q$-value, making it an excellent case to select the reaction\nmechanism and the final states in outgoing nuclei. The high-lying resonances in\n$^{14}$C are reconstructed for three sets of well discriminated final states in\n$^{10}$Be. The results confirm the previous decay measurements with clearly\nimproved decay-channel selections and show also a new state at 23.5(1) MeV. The\nresonant states at 22.4(3) and 24.0(3) MeV decay primarily into the typical\nmolecular states at about 6 MeV in $^{10}$Be, indicating a well developed\ncluster structure in these high-lying states in $^{14}$C. Further measurements\nof more states of this kind are suggested.\n", "  We examine the performance of a nonlinear fiber gyroscope for improved signal\ndetection beating the quantum limits of its linear counterparts. The\nperformance is examined when the nonlinear gyroscope is illuminated by\npractical field states, such as coherent and quadrature squeezed states. This\nis compared with the case of more ideal probes such as photon-number states.\n", "  The relations between observable stellar parameters are usually assumed to be\ndeterministic. That is, given an infinitely precise measurement of independent\nvariable, `$x$', and some model, the value of dependent variable, `$y$' can be\nknown exactly. In practise this assumption is rarely valid and intrinsic\nstochasticity means that two stars with exactly the same `$x$', will have\nslightly different `$y$'s. The relation between short-timescale brightness\nfluctuations (flicker) of stars and both surface gravity and stellar density\nare two such stochastic relations that have, until now, been treated as\ndeterministic ones. We recalibrate these relations in a probabilistic\nframework, using Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) to constrain the\nintrinsic scatter in the relations. We find evidence for additional scatter in\nthe relationships, that cannot be accounted for by the observational\nuncertainties alone. The scatter in surface gravity and stellar density does\nnot depend on flicker, suggesting that using flicker as a proxy for $\\log g$\nand $\\rho_\\star$ is equally valid for dwarf and giant stars, despite the fact\nthat the observational uncertainties tend to be larger for dwarfs.\n", "  We reply to the comment of Becker, Nelissen, Cleuren, Partoens, and Van den\nBroeck, Phys. Rev. E 93, 046101 (2016) on our article, Phys. Rev. E 90, 052108\n(2014) about transport properties of a class of generalized exclusion\nprocesses.\n", "  By way of the non-equilibrium Green's function simulations and analytical\nexpressions, the quantum thermal conductance of stanene is studied. We find\nthat, due to the existence of Dirac fermion in stanene, the ratio of electron\nthermal conductance and electric conductance becomes a\nchemical-potential-dependent quantity, violating the Wiedemann-Franz law. This\nfinding is applicable to any two-dimensional (2D) materials that possess\nmassless Dirac fermions. In strong contrast to the negligible electronic\ncontribution in graphene, surprisingly, the electrons and phonons in stanene\ncarry a comparable heat current. The unusual behaviours in stanene widen our\nknowledge of quantum thermal transport in 2D materials.\n", "  Nano-resonator integrated with two-dimensional materials (e.g. transition\nmetal dichalcogenides) have recently emerged as a promising nano-optoelectronic\nplatform. Here we demonstrate resonatorenhanced second-harmonic generation\n(SHG) in tungsten diselenide using a silicon photonic crystal cavity. By\npumping the device with the ultrafast laser pulses near the cavity mode at the\ntelecommunication wavelength, we observe a near visible SHG with a narrow\nlinewidth and near unity linear polarization, originated from the coupling of\nthe pump photon to the cavity mode. The observed SHG is enhanced by factor of\n~200 compared to a bare monolayer on silicon. Our results imply the efficacy of\ncavity integrated monolayer materials for nonlinear optics and the potential of\nbuilding a silicon-compatible second-order nonlinear integrated photonic\nplatform.\n", "  It is shown that a 1980 proposal to search for heavy sterile neutrinos by\nobserving the energy of the associated lepton in weak decays rests on an\nquestionable assumption, and that the possibility of such a detection might be\ninconsistent with the observability of neutrino oscillations.\n", "  For over a decade now, the primary purpose of relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) has been to study the properties of QCD matter under extreme\nconditions -high temperature and high density. The heavy-ion experiments at\nboth RHIC and LHC have recorded a wealth of data in p+p, p+Pb, d+Au, Cu+Cu,\nCu+Au, Au+Au, Pb+Pb and U+U collisions at energies ranging from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\n= 7.7 GeV to 7 TeV. Heavy quarks are considered good probe to study the QCD\nmatter created in relativistic collisions due to their very large mass and\nother unique properties. A precise measurement of various properties of heavy\nflavor hadrons provides an insight into the fundamental properties of the hot\nand dense medium created in these nuclei-nuclei collisions, such as transport\ncoefficient and thermalization and hadronization mechanisms. The main focus of\nthis paper is to present a review on the measurements of azimuthal anisotropy\nof heavy flavor hadrons and to outline the scientific opportunities in this\nsector due to future detector upgrade. We will mainly discuss the elliptic flow\nof open charmed meson ($D$-meson), $J/\\psi$ and leptons from heavy flavor decay\nat RHIC and LHC energy.\n", "  We study persistence probabilities of Hermite processes. As a tool, we derive\na general decorrelation inequality for the Rosenblatt process, which is\nreminiscent of Slepian's lemma for Gaussian processes or the FKG inequality and\nwhich may be of independent interest. This allows to compute the persistence\nexponent for the Rosenblatt process. For general Hermite processes, we derive\nupper and lower bounds for the persistence probabilites with the conjectured\npersistence exponent, but with non-matching boundaries.\n", "  In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, force field determines the capability\nof an individual model in capturing physical and chemistry properties. The\nmethod for generating proper parameters of the force field form is the key\ncomponent for computational research in chemistry, biochemistry, and\ncondensed-phase physics. Our study showed that the feasibility to predict\nexperimental condensed phase properties (i.e., density and heat of\nvaporization) of methanol through problem specific force field from only\nquantum chemistry information. To acquire the satisfying parameter sets of the\nforce field, the genetic algorithm (GA) is the main optimization method. For\nelectrostatic potential energy, we optimized both the electrostatic parameters\nof methanol using the GA method, which leads to low deviations of between the\nquantum mechanics (QM) calculations and the GA optimized parameters. We\noptimized the van der Waals (vdW) parameters both using GA and guided GA\nmethods by calibrating interaction energy of various methanol homo-clusters,\nsuch as nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers. Excellent agreement between the\ntraining dataset from QM calculations (i.e., MP2) and GA optimized parameters\ncan be achieved. However, only the guided GA method, which eliminates the\noverestimation of interaction energy from MP2 calculations in the optimization\nprocess, provides proper vdW parameters for MD simulation to get the condensed\nphase properties (i.e., density and heat of vaporization) of methanol.\nThroughout the whole optimization process, the experimental value were not\ninvolved in the objective functions, but were only used for the purpose of\njustifying models (i.e., nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers) and validating\nmethods (i.e., GA or guided GA). Our method shows the possibility of developing\ndescriptive polarizable force field using only QM calculations.\n", "  Many central problems in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics lead to\nquestions concerning the long-time dynamics of solutions to ordinary and\npartial differential equations. Examples range from the Einstein field\nequations of general relativity to quasilinear reaction-advection-diffusion\nequations of parabolic type. Specific questions concern the convergence to\nequilibria, the existence of periodic, homoclinic, and heteroclinic solutions,\nand the existence and geometric structure of global attractors. On the other\nhand, many solutions develop singularities in finite time. The singularities\nhave to be analyzed in detail before attempting to extend solutions beyond\ntheir singularities, or to understand their geometry in conjunction with\nglobally bounded solutions. In this context we have also aimed at global\nqualitative descriptions of blow-up and grow-up phenomena.\n", "  Numerical models and computer-aided modeling software are tools commonly used\nto assess the accessibility of an environment, based on static human body\ndimensions. In this paper, the limits of validity of these approaches are\nassessed by comparing the reach envelopes obtained by these methods to those\nobtained experimentally. First, the accessibility areas of forty adult\nsubjects, which may correspond to the distance of reachability of products,\nwere evaluated by performing an accessibility task comprising 168 reach points.\nSecond, anthropometric characteristics of participants were recorded and used\nto perform the reach assessment by a numerical method, and then by a CAD-based\nanalysis, where the reach was predicted using the software's maximum\nreach-envelope generation. In spite of the simple nature of the presented\ndesign problem (two-dimensional), the results show important differences\nbetween the three methods. The study of the number of reached points shows that\nthe CAD-based assessment provides more accurate results than the numerical\nmodel. Nevertheless, the shapes envelopes comparison indicates that the maximum\nreach envelopes obtained with the CAD analysis are not always consistent with\nthose obtained experimentally, closely linked to the hand location. Results\nindicate that the CAD model used to obtain maximum reaches gave predictions\nthat underestimate the reach ability.\n", "  Here is considered the full evolution of a spherical supernova remnant. We\nstart by calculating the early time ejecta dominated stage and continue through\nthe different phases of interaction with the circumstellar medium, and end with\nthe dissipation and merger phase. The physical connection between the phases\nreveals new results. One is that the blast wave radius during the adiabatic\nphase is significantly smaller than it would be, if one does notaccount for the\nblast wave interaction with the ejecta.\n", "  Here we identify a new form of optomechanical coupling in gas-filled\nhollow-core fibers. Stimulated forward Brillouin scattering is observed in air\nin the core of a photonic bandgap fiber. A single resonance is observed at 35\nMHz, which corresponds to the first excited axial-radial acoustic mode in the\nair-filled core. The linewidth and coupling strengths are determined by the\nacoustic loss and electrostrictive coupling in air, respectively. A simple\nanalytical model, refined by numerical simulations, is developed that\naccurately predicts the Brillouin coupling strength and frequency from the gas\nand fiber parameters. Since this form of Brillouin coupling depends strongly on\nboth the acoustic and dispersive optical properties of the gas within the\nfiber, this new type of optomechanical interaction is highly tailorable. These\nresults allow for forward Brillouin spectroscopy in dilute gases, could be\nuseful for sensing and will present a power and noise limitation for certain\napplications.\n", "  In this LOI we propose a dedicated experiment that would detect\n\"milli-charged\" particles produced by pp collisions at LHC Point 5. The\nexperiment would be installed during LS2 in the vestigial drainage gallery\nabove UXC and would not interfere with CMS operations. With 300 fb$^{-1}$ of\nintegrated luminosity, sensitivity to a particle with charge\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})~e$ can be achieved for masses of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV,\nand charge $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})~e$ for masses of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV,\ngreatly extending the parameter space explored for particles with small charge\nand masses above 100 MeV.\n", "  Despite the success of reverse osmosis (RO) for water purification, the\nmolecular-level physico-chemical processes of contaminant rejection are not\nwell understood. Here we carry out NEMD simulations on a model polyamide RO\nmembrane to understand the mechanisms of transport and rejection of both ionic\nand neutral contaminants in water. We observe that the rejection changes\nnon-monotonously with ion sizes. In particular, the rejection of urea, 2.4 A\nradius, is higher than ethanol, 2.6 A radius, and the rejections for organic\nsolutes, 2.2-2.8 A radius, are lower than Na+, 1.4 A radius, or Cl-, 2.3 A\nradius. We show that this can be explained in terms of the solute accessible\nintermolecular volume in the membrane and the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy. If the smallest open spaces in the membrane's molecular structure are\nall larger than the hydrated solute, then the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy does not matter. However, when the open spaces in the polymeric\nstructure are such that solutes have to shed at least one water molecule to\npass through a portion of the membrane molecular structure, the pair\ninteraction energy governs solute rejection. The high pair interaction energy\nfor water molecules in the solvation shell for ions makes the water molecules\ndifficult to shed, thus enhancing the rejection of ions. On the other hand, the\norganic solute-water interaction energies are governed by the water molecules\nthat are hydrogen bonded to the solute. Urea molecules have more\nhydrogen-bonding sites than alcohol molecules, leading to a higher rejection of\nurea than occurs for ethanol, a molecule of similar size but with fewer\nhydrogen bonding sites. These findings underline the importance of the solute's\nsolvation shell and solute-water-membrane chemistry in the context of reverse\nosmosis, thus providing new insights into solute transport and rejection in RO\nmembranes.\n", "  Here we report mid infrared (mid-IR) photothermal response of multi layer\nMoS2 thin film grown on crystalline (p-type silicon and c-axis oriented single\ncrystal sapphire) and amorphous substrates (Si/SiO2 and Si/SiN) by pulsed laser\ndeposition (PLD) technique. The photothermal response of the MoS2 films was\nmeasured as changes in the resistance of MoS2 films when irradiated with mid IR\n(7 to 8.2 {\\mu}m) source. We show that it is possible to enhance the\ntemperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the MoS2 thin film by\ncontrolling the interface through proper choice of substrate and growth\nconditions. The thin films grown by PLD were characterized using XRD, Raman,\nAFM, XPS and TEM. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)\nimages show that the MoS2 films grow on sapphire substrate in a layer-by-layer\nmanner with misfit dislocations. Layer growth morphology is disrupted when\ngrown on substrates with diamond cubic structure such as silicon due to growth\ntwin formation. The growth morphology is very different on amorphous substrates\nsuch as Si/SiO2 or Si/SiN. The MoS2 film grown on silicon shows a very high TCR\n(-2.9% K-1), mid IR sensitivity (delR/R=5.2 %) and responsivity (8.7 V/W) as\ncompared to films on other substrates.\n", "  This paper focuses on accelerating quantum optimal control design for complex\nquantum systems. Based on our previous work [{arXiv:1607.04054}], we combine\nPulse Width Modulation (PWM) and gradient descent algorithm into solving\nquantum optimal control problems, which shows distinct improvement of\ncomputational efficiency in various cases. To further apply this algorithm to\npotential experiments, we also propose the smooth realization of the optimized\ncontrol solution, e.g. using Gaussian pulse train to replace rectangular\npulses. Based on the experimental data of the D-Norleucine molecule, we\nnumerically find optimal control functions in $3$-qubit and $6$-qubit systems,\nand demonstrate its efficiency advantage compared with basic GRAPE algorithm.\n", "  The Allan variance (AVAR) was introduced 50 years ago as a statistical tool\nfor assessing of the frequency standards deviations. For the past decades, AVAR\nhas increasingly being used in geodesy and astrometry to assess the noise\ncharacteristics in geodetic and astrometric time series. A specific feature of\nastrometric and geodetic measurements, as compared with the clock measurements,\nis that they are generally associated with uncertainties; thus, an appropriate\nweighting should be applied during data analysis. Besides, some physically\nconnected scalar time series naturally form series of multi-dimensional\nvectors. For example, three station coordinates time series $X$, $Y$, and $Z$\ncan be combined to analyze 3D station position variations. The classical AVAR\nis not intended for processing unevenly weighted and/or multi-dimensional data.\nTherefore, AVAR modifications, namely weighted AVAR (WAVAR), multi-dimensional\nAVAR (MAVAR), and weighted multi-dimensional AVAR (WMAVAR), were introduced to\novercome these deficiencies. In this paper, a brief review is given of the\nexperience of using AVAR and its modifications in processing astro-geodetic\ntime series.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate that a metasurface consisting of\nPancharatnam-Berry phase optical elements can enable the full control of\noptical spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion. Our approach relies on the\ncritical interference between the transmission and reflection upon the\nmetasurfaceto create actively tunable and controllable conversion with a high\noutput via coherent control of the two incident beams. The introduced control\nmethodology is general and could be an important step toward the development of\nfunctional optical devices for practical applications.\n", "  The assembly of ecological communities from a pool of species is central to\necology, but the effect of this process on properties of community interaction\nnetworks is still largely unknown. Here, we use a systematic analytical\nframework to describe how assembly from a species pool gives rise to community\nnetwork properties that differ from those of the pool: Compared to the pool,\nthe community shows a bias towards higher carrying capacities, weaker\ncompetitive interactions and stronger beneficial interactions. Moreover, even\nif interactions between all pool species are completely random, community\nnetworks are more structured, with correlations between interspecies\ninteractions, and between interactions and carrying capacities. Nonetheless, we\nshow that these properties are not sufficient to explain the coexistence of all\ncommunity species, and that it is a simple relation between interactions and\nspecies abundances that is responsible for the diversity within a community.\n", "  Information and data exchange is an important aspect of scientific progress.\nIn computational materials science, a prerequisite for smooth data exchange is\nstandardization, which means using agreed conventions for, e.g., units, zero\nbase lines, and file formats. There are two main strategies to achieve this\ngoal. One accepts the heterogeneous nature of the community which comprises\nscientists from physics, chemistry, bio-physics, and materials science, by\ncomplying with the diverse ecosystem of computer codes and thus develops\n\"converters\" for the input and output files of all important codes. These\nconverters then translate the data of all important codes into a standardized,\ncode-independent format. The other strategy is to provide standardized open\nlibraries that code developers can adopt for shaping their inputs, outputs, and\nrestart files, directly into the same code-independent format. We like to\nemphasize in this paper that these two strategies can and should be regarded as\ncomplementary, if not even synergetic. The main concepts and software\ndevelopments of both strategies are very much identical, and, obviously, both\napproaches should give the same final result. In this paper, we present the\nappropriate format and conventions that were agreed upon by two teams, the\nElectronic Structure Library (ESL) of CECAM and the NOMAD (NOvel MAterials\nDiscovery) Laboratory, a European Centre of Excellence (CoE). This discussion\nincludes also the definition of hierarchical metadata describing\nstate-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations.\n", "  Wishart random matrices are often used to model multivariate systems in\nphysics, finance, biology and wireless communication. Extreme value statistics,\nsuch as those of the smallest eigenvalue, can be used to test the accuracy of\nthe model. In this article we study the gap formation probability (cumulative\ndistribution function of the smallest eigenvalue) for real and quaternion\n$N\\times \\left(N+\\nu\\right)$ Wishart random matrices in the large $N$ limit. We\nderive compact expression in terms of determinants of known functions. As a\nconsequence of this representation, the gap formation probabilities solve the\nToda lattice equation, in the index $\\nu$ for $\\nu$ even and for $\\nu$ odd\nseparately.\n", "  With continuous advances in technologies related to deep space ranging and\nsatellite gravity gradiometry, corrections from general relativity to the\ndynamics of relative orbital motions will certainly become important. In this\nwork, we extend,in a systematic way, the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire Equations to\ninclude the complete first order post-Newtonian effects from general\nrelativity. Within certain short time limit, post-Newtonian corrections to\ngeneral periodic solutions of the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire Equations are also\nworked out.\n", "  We consider a bilevel optimatisation method for inverse linear atmospheric\ndispersion problems where both linear and non-linear model parameters are to be\ndetermined. We propose that a smooth weighted Mahalanobis distance function is\nused and derive sufficient conditions for when the follower problem has local\nstrict convexity. A few toy-models are presented where local strict convexity\nand ill-posedness of the inverse problem are explored, indeed the smooth\ndistance function is compared and contrasted to linear and piecewise linear\nones. The bilevel optimisation method is then applied to sensor data collected\nin wind tunnel experiments of a neutral gas release in urban environments\n(MODITIC).\n", "  The method of group theory is applied to investigate the ground and the\nexcited states of the triton and helium nuclei by using the translation\ninvariant shell model with basis functions corresponding to even number of\nquanta of excitations in the range 0 less than or equal to N less than or equal\nto 20. Accordingly, the ground and first excited state wave functions and\nenergies, the S, P and D state probabilities, the root mean square radius and\nthe magnetic dipole moment of triton have been investigated. Also, the energies\nand wave functions of the ground and the even parity excited states and the\nroot mean square radius of helium have been investigated. Two residual two body\ninteractions together with two three nucleon interactions have been used in the\ncalculations. Moreover, the convergence of calculations has been examined by\nextrapolating the results with N less than or equals to 20 step by step to\nreach N equals to 30 for the two nuclei.\n", "  This paper presents a study of the forced acoustical response of an open\ncavity from the perspective of modal expansion. Based on the coupled mode\ntheory, it is shown that the sound pressure distribution of an open cavity\nexcited by a point source placed within the cavity can be expanded by a set of\nfrequency-dependent eigenmodes, which are derived from the coupling between the\ncavity and a semi-infinite space. The calculation of the acoustical responses\nfor baffled and unbaffled open cavities indicates that the proposed modal\nexpansion converges with only a few frequency-dependent eigenmodes in the\nfrequency range of interest. The results of this study eliminate the ambiguity\ninvolving the selection of appropriate basis functions, in modal expansion for\nthe forced response problem in open cavities.\n", "  Supersonic beams are a prevalent source of cold molecules utilized in the\nstudy of chemical reactions, atom interferometry, gas-surface interactions,\nprecision spectroscopy, molecular cooling and more. The triumph of this method\nemanates from the high densities produced in relation to other methods, however\nbeam density remains fundamentally limited by interference with shock waves\nreflected from collimating surfaces. Here we show experimentally that this\nshock interaction can be reduced or even eliminated by cryo-cooling the\ninteracting surface. An increase in beam density of nearly an order of\nmagnitude was measured at the lowest surface temperature, with no further\nfundamental limitation reached. Visualization of the shock waves by plasma\ndischarge and reproduction with direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations both\nindicate that the suppression of the shock structure is partially caused by\nlowering the momentum flux of reflected particles, and significantly enhanced\nby the adsorption of particles to the surface. We observe that the scaling of\nbeam density with source pressure is recovered, paving the way to order of\nmagnitude brighter cold molecular beams.\n", "  Sampling complex potential energies is one of the most pressing challenges of\ncontemporary computational science. Inspired by recent efforts that use quantum\neffects and discretized Feynman's path integrals to overcome large barriers we\npropose a replica exchange method. In each replica two copies of the same\nsystem with halved potential strengths interact via inelastic springs. The\nstrength of the spring is varied in the different replicas so as to bridge the\ngap between the infinitely strong spring, that corresponds to the Boltzmann\nreplica and the less tight ones. We enhance the spring length fluctuations\nusing Metadynamics. We test the method on simple yet challenging problems.\n", "  We overview recent results on the mathematical foundations of Cutkosky rules.\nWe emphasize that the two operations of shrinking an internal edge or putting\ninternal lines on the mass-shell are natural operation on the cubical chain\ncomplex studied in the context of geometric group theory. This together with\nCutkosky's theorem regarded as a theorem which informs us about variations\nconnected to the monodromy of Feynman amplitudes allows for a systematic\napproach to normal and anomalous thresholds, dispersion relations and the\noptical theorem. In this report we follow [1] closely.\n", "  Wire grid polarizers (WGPs), periodic nano-optical meta-surfaces, are\nconvenient polarizing elements for many optical applications. However, they are\nstill inadequate in the deep ultraviolet spectral range. We show that to\nachieve high performance ultraviolet WGPs a material with large absolute value\nof the complex permittivity and extinction coefficient at the wavelength of\ninterest has to be utilized. This requirement is compared to refractive index\nmodels considering intraband and interband absorption processes. We elucidate\nwhy the extinction ratio of metallic WGPs intrinsically humble in the deep\nultraviolet, whereas wide bandgap semiconductors are superior material\ncandidates in this spectral range. To demonstrate this, we present the design,\nfabrication and optical characterization of a titanium dioxide WGP. At a\nwavelength of 193 nm an unprecedented extinction ratio of 384 and a\ntransmittance of 10 % is achieved.\n", "  We present a method to identify distant solar system objects in long-term\nwide-field asteroid survey data, and conduct a search for them in the\nPan-STARRS1 (PS1) image data acquired from 2010 to mid-2015. We demonstrate\nthat our method is able to find multi-opposition orbital links, and we present\nthe resulting orbital distributions which consist of 154 Centaurs, 255\nclassical Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), 121 resonant TNOs, 89 Scattered Disc\nObjects (SDOs) and 10 comets. Our results show more than half of these are new\ndiscoveries, including a newly discovered 19th magnitude TNO. Our identified\nobjects do not show clustering in their argument of perihelia, which if\npresent, might support the existence of a large unknown planetary-sized object\nin the outer solar system.\n", "  We apply the global thermodynamic variables approach to experimentally\ndetermine the isothermal compressibility parameter $\\kappa_T$ of a trapped Bose\ngas across the phase transition. We demonstrate the behavior of $\\kappa_T$\naround the critical pressure, revealing the second order nature of the phase\ntransition. Compressibility is the most important susceptibility to\ncharacterize the system. The use of global variables shows advantages with\nrespect to the usual local density approximation method and can be applied to a\nbroad range of situations.\n", "  Utilisation of the material and energy resources of the Solar System will be\nessential for the development of a sustainable space economy and associated\ninfrastructure. Science will be a major beneficiary of a space economy, even if\nits major elements (e.g. space tourism, resource extraction activities on the\nMoon or asteroids, and large-scale in-space construction capabilities) are not\ndeveloped with science primarily in mind. Examples of scientific activities\nthat would be facilitated by the development of space infrastructure include\nthe construction of large space telescopes, ambitious space missions (including\nhuman missions) to the outer Solar System, and the establishment of scientific\nresearch stations on the Moon and Mars (and perhaps elsewhere). In the more\ndistant future, an important scientific application of a well-developed space\ninfrastructure may be the construction of interstellar space probes for the\nexploration of planets around nearby stars.\n", "  In this paper the theory of high-frequency acoustic signal detection by\nSchottky diodes is presented. Physically, the detection was found to be due to\nthe quasi-static screening of the potential perturbation caused by the acoustic\nstrain by charge carriers. The total charge required for screening changes with\nthe value of strain at the edge of the semiconductor depletion region and\nmetal-semiconductor interface giving rise to displacement current. The\nmagnitude and frequency dependence of the electrical signals are analyzed for\nboth piezoelectric and deformation potential coupling mechanisms. The obtained\nresults are in good agreement with the recent experimental observations and\nsuggest feasibility of high-frequency (up to terahertz band) acoustic wave\ndetection provided that proper electrical measuring scheme is available.\n", "  A combination of the H- stripping and phase space painting method is used to\naccumulate a high intensity beam in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of the\nChina Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). The injection system for CSNS/RCS\nconsists of three kinds of magnets: four direct current magnets (BC1-BC4),\neight alternating current magnets (BH1-BH4 and BV1-BV4), two septum magnets\n(ISEP1 and ISEP2). In this paper, the magnetic measurements of the injection\nsystem were introduced and the data analysis was processed. The field\nuniformity and magnetizing curves of these magnets were given, and then the\nmagnetizing fitting equations were obtained.\n", "  The emission of dispersive waves (DWs) by temporal solitons can be described\nas a cascaded four-wave mixing process triggered by a pair of monochromatic\ncontinuous waves (CWs). We report experimental and numerical results\ndemonstrating that the efficiency of this process is strongly and non-trivially\naffected by the frequency detuning of the CW pump lasers. We explain our\nresults by showing that individual cycles of the input dual-frequency beat\nsignal can evolve as higher-order solitons whose temporal compression and\nsoliton fission govern the DW efficiency. Analytical predictions based on the\ndetuning dependence of the soliton order are shown to be in excellent agreement\nwith experimental and numerical observations.\n", "  In this paper, we proposed a pseudo antibunching effect on one single photon\ndetector. Though this pseudo antibunching effect is not a sign of the non\nclassical properties of the light field as the antibunching effect. It will\ngive some intresting properties to the photon statistics of the related fields,\nsuch as the anticorrelation of photon number or intensity fluctuations of the\ntwo input fields. This effect may have some potential application in future\nespecially in the quantum information field.\n", "  We investigate several aspects of realizing quantum computation using\nentangled polar molecules in pendular states. Quantum algorithms typically\nstart from a product state |00...0> and we show that up to a negligible error,\nthe ground states of polar molecule arrays can be considered as the unentangled\nqubit basis state |00...0>. This state can be prepared by simply allowing the\nsystem to reach thermal equilibrium at low temperature (<1 mK). We also\nevaluate entanglement, characterized by the concurrence of pendular state\nqubits in dipole arrays as governed by the external electric field,\ndipole-dipole coupling and number N of molecules in the array. In the parameter\nregime that we consider for quantum computing, we find that qubit entanglement\nis modest, typically no greater than 0.0001, confirming the negligible\nentanglement in the ground state. We discuss methods for realizing quantum\ncomputation in the gate model, measurement based model, instantaneous quantum\npolynomial time circuits and the adiabatic model using polar molecules in\npendular states.\n", "  Matrix permanents arise naturally in the context of linear optical networks\nfed with nonclassical states of light. In this letter we tie the computational\ncomplexity of a class of multi-dimensional integrals to the permanents of large\nmatrices using a simple quantum optics argument. In this way we prove that\nevaluating integrals in this class is \\textbf{\\#P}-hard. Our work provides a\nnew approach for using methods from quantum physics to prove statements in\ncomputer science.\n", "  Huge astrospheres or stellar wind bubbles influence the propagation of cosmic\nrays at energies up to the TeV range and can act as small-scale sinks\ndecreasing the cosmic ray flux. We model such a sink (in 2D) by a sphere of\nradius 10\\,pc embedded within a sphere of a radius of 1\\,kpc. The cosmic ray\nflux is calculated by means of backward stochastic differential equations from\nan observer, which is located at $r_{0}$, to the outer boundary. It turns out\nthat such small-scale sinks can influence the cosmic ray flux at the observer's\nlocation by a few permille (i.e\\ a few 0.1\\%), which is in the range of the\nobservations by IceCube, Milagro and other large area telescopes.\n", "  Numerical hydrodynamic simulation of inviscid and viscous flows have shown\nthat significant outflows could be produced from the CENtrifugal pressure\nsupported BOundary Layer or CENBOL of an advective disk. However, this barrier\nis weakened in presence of viscosity, more so, if there are explicit energy\ndissipations at the boundary layer itself. We study effects of viscosity and\nenergy dissipation theoretically on the outflow rate and show that as the\nviscosity or energy dissipation (or both) rises, the prospect of formation of\noutflows is greatly reduced, thereby verifying results obtained through\nobservations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative\nviscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the\nShakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter {\\alpha} is less than 0.2. This is a direct\nconsequence of modification of the Rankine-Hugoniot relation across the shock\nin a viscous flow, when the energy dissipation and mass loss in the form of\noutflows from the post-shock region are included. If we ignore the effects of\nmass loss altogether, the standing dissipative shocks in viscous flows may\noccur only if {\\alpha} < 0.27. These limits are tighter than the absolute limit\nof {\\alpha} = 0.3 valid for a situation when the shock itself neither\ndissipates energy nor any outflow is formed. We compute typical viscosity\nparameters required to understand spectral and temporal properties of several\nblack hole candidates such as GX399-4, MAXI J1659-152 and MAXI J1836-194 and\nfind that required {\\alpha} are indeed well within our prescribed limit.\n", "  In the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks\nwhich are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and\nheterogeneous rate of disease transmission. The random allocation of epidemic\ntransmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn\ncauses the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim of\nthe study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among\nvarious sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such\nnetworks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible\ninfected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to\ndescribe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. The study is\nparameterized in terms of variable $\\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts\na node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation\nresults, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical\nin terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no\noutbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from\nthe size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the\ntotal number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the\nparametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number\nof concurrent contacts made by a node ($\\lambda$ ) and the average number of\nlinks per node. In both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to\nincrease with the corresponding increase in respective parameters.\n", "  Strain engineering is a very effective method to tune electronic, optical,\ntopological and thermoelectric properties of materials. In this work, we\nsystematically study biaxial strain dependence of electronic structures and\nthermoelectric properties (both electron and phonon parts) of monolayer\n$\\mathrm{PtSe_2}$ with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) for electron part and GGA for phonon part. Calculated results\nshow that compressive or tensile strain can induce conduction band minimum\n(CBM) or valence band maximum (VBM) transition, which produces important\neffects on Seebeck coefficient. It is found that compressive or tensile strain\ncan induce significantly enhanced n- or p-type Seebeck coefficient at the\ncritical strain of CBM or VBM transition, which can be explained by\nstrain-induced band convergence. Another essential strain effect is that\ntensile strain can produce significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity,\nand the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity at the strain of -4.02\\%\ncan decrease by about 60\\% compared to unstrained one, which is very favorable\nfor high $ZT$. To estimate efficiency of thermoelectric conversion, the figure\nof merit $ZT$ can be obtained by empirical scattering time $\\tau$. Calculated\n$ZT$ values show that strain indeed is a very effective strategy to achieve\nenhanced thermoelectric properties, especially for p-type doping. Tuning\nthermoelectric properties with strain also can be applied to other\nsemiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers $\\mathrm{MX_2}$\n(M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and Pt; X=S, Se and Te).\n", "  Local helioseismology provides a unique opportunity to investigate the\nsubsurface structure and dynamics of active regions and their effect on the\nlarge-scale flows and global circulation of the Sun. We use measurements of\nplasma flows in the upper convection zone, provided by the Time-Distance\nHelioseismology Pipeline developed for analysis of solar oscillation data\nobtained by Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO), to investigate the subsurface dynamics of emerging active\nregion NOAA 11726. The active region emergence was detected in deep layers of\nthe convection zone about 12 hours before the first bipolar magnetic structure\nappeared on the surface, and 2 days before the emergence of most of the\nmagnetic flux. The speed of emergence determined by tracking the flow\ndivergence with depth is about 1.4 km/s, very close to the emergence speed in\nthe deep layers. As the emerging magnetic flux becomes concentrated in sunspots\nlocal converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots. These flows\nare most prominent in the depth range 1-3 Mm, and remain converging after the\nformation process is completed. On the larger scale converging flows around\nactive region appear as a diversion of the zonal shearing flows towards the\nactive region, accompanied by formation of a large-scale vortex structure. This\nprocess occurs when a substantial amount of the magnetic flux emerged on the\nsurface, and the converging flow pattern remains stable during the following\nevolution of the active region. The Carrington synoptic flow maps show that the\nlarge-scale subsurface inflows are typical for active regions. In the deeper\nlayers (10-13 Mm) the flows become diverging, and surprisingly strong beneath\nsome active regions. In addition, the synoptic maps reveal a complex evolving\npattern of large-scale flows on the scale much larger than supergranulation.\n", "  The present work reports the preparation of polycrystalline multiferroic\n$GdFeO_3$ (GdFO) and characterization with x-ray diffraction (XRD),\nmagnetization, temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, temperature and\nmagnetic field dependent $^{57}Fe$ M$\\ddot{o}$ssbauer spectroscopy\nmeasurements. The sample is found to be phase pure from Rietveld refinement of\nXRD pattern. The M$\\ddot{o}$ssbauer spectra measured in the presence of\nexternal magnetic field show the signatures of field induced spin reorientation\ntransition, which are corroborated by magnetization measurements. From the\ntemperature dependent variation of internal hyperfine field, N$\\grave{e}$el\ntransition temperature ($T_{N,Fe}$) of 672.5$\\pm$0.2 K and critical exponent\n($\\beta$) of 0.333$\\pm$0.003 is obtained. Temperature dependent (300 - 760 K)\nRaman spectroscopy measurements show the signatures of spin-phonon coupling and\nlocal structural re-arrangement across $T_{N,Fe}$.\n", "  The propagation of laser beams through madia with cubic nonlinear\npolarization is part of a wide range of practical applications. The processes\nthat are involved are at the limit of extreme (cuasi-singular) concentration of\nintensity and the transversal modulational instability, the saturation and\ndefocusing effect of the plasma generated through avalanche and multi-photon\n(MPI) ionization are competing leading to a complicated pattern of intensity in\nthe transversal plane. This regime has been named \\textquotedblleft optical\nturbulence\\textquotedblright and it has been studied in experiments and\nnumerical simulations. Led by the similarity of the portraits we have\ninvestigated the possibility that the mechanism that underlies the creation of\nthe complex pattern of the intensity field is the manifestation of the dynamics\n\\textit{activator-inhibitor}. In a previous work we have considered a unique\nconnection, the \\textit{complex Landau-Ginzburg equation}, a common ground for\nthe nonlinear Schrodinger equation (optical propagation) and reaction-diffusion\nsystems (activator-inhibitor). The present work is a continuation of this\ninvestigation. We start from the exact integrability of the elementary\nself-focusing propagation (\\textit{gas Chaplygin with anomalous polytropic})\nand show that the analytical model for the intensity can be extended on\nphysical basis to include the potential barrier separating two states of\nequilibria and the drive due to competing Kerr and MPI nonlinearities. We\nunderline the variational structure and calculate the width of a branch of the\ncluster of high intensity (when it is saturated at a finite value). Our result\nis smaller but satisfactorily in the range of the experimental observations.\n", "  The concept of coupled robust field induced Josephson junctions placed in\ncomplex electromagnetic environments is presented. The methodology of modeling\nof structures and possible implementations is introduced. The presented scheme\nis expected to implement and describe both classical and quantum computer with\nuse of Josephson junction and artificial evolution. In such case one can obtain\nunexpected new typologies of circuits that can contribute in enhancement of\nknown and used circuit schemes.\n", "  According to a basic rule of fermionic and bosonic many-body physics, known\nas the linked cluster theorem, physical observables are not affected by vacuum\nbubbles, which represent virtual particles created from vacuum and\nself-annihilating without interacting with real particles. Here, we show that\nthis conventional knowledge must be revised for anyons, quasiparticles that\nobey fractional exchange statistics intermediate between fermions and bosons.\nWe find that a certain class of vacuum bubbles of Abelian anyons does affect\nphysical observables. They represent virtually excited anyons which wind around\nreal anyonic excitations. These topological bubbles result in a\ntemperature-dependent phase shift of Fabry-Perot interference patterns in the\nfractional quantum Hall regime accessible in current experiments, thus\nproviding a tool for direct and unambiguous observation of elusive fractional\nstatistics.\n", "  From his observations of the A.D. 1572 super-nova and the A.D. 1577 comet,\nTycho Brahe concluded that such transient celestial objects are outside the\nEarth's atmosphere, and he quoted the 9th century A.D. Persian astrologer and\nastronomer Abu Mashar: Dixit Albumasar, Cometa supra Venerem visus fuit, i.e.\nthat he had reported much earlier that comets were seen beyond Venus. However,\neven from a more detailed Latin translation, the observations and logic behind\nAbu Mashar's conclusion were not understandable. We present here the original\nArabic text (MS Ankara, Saib 199) together with our translation and\ninterpretation: Abu Mashar reported that he had observed Venus in (or projected\nonto) the tail of a comet and concluded that the comet was behind Venus,\nbecause he had observed the extinction of Venus due to the cometary tail to be\nnegligible (light of Venus was unimpaired). He then concluded that the comet\nwould be located behind Venus. He also mentioned that others had observed\nJupiter and Saturn in cometary tails, so that those comets would even be\nlocated beyond those two outer planets - in the sphere of the stars. The dates\nof the observed close conjunctions were not mentioned; using known orbital\nelements for a few comets, we found a few close conjunctions between comets and\nplanets from A.D. 770 to 868, but we cannot be sure regarding which\nconjunctions were reported. While the argument of Abu Mashar is not correct (as\ncometary tails are optically thin), parts of the conclusion - namely that\ncomets are outside the Earth atmosphere and beyond the moon - is correct. This\nmay have helped Tycho Brahe to come to his revolutionary conclusion.\n", "  We study the persistent current in a one dimensional Dirac ring and show that\nthe change of spin current with respect to an applied perpendicular electric\nfield can be used to identify the topological phases. We further study the\neffect of Rashba spin orbit coupling and show that the Aharonov-Casher phase\nappearing due to Rashba spin orbit coupling vanishes in topologically\nnontrivial regime and thus can identify the topological phases. This\nAharonov-Casher phase causes a finite spin-valley current in presence of valley\nmixing perturbation and is thus useful to detect the topological phases even in\npresence of such impurity.\n", "  A multidisciplinary approach is proposed for evaluating the effects of\nshaking due to strong motions on the Tiber river alluvial deposits in Rome's\nhistorical centre. At this aim, a detailed 3D geological model of the Tiber\nriver alluvial deposit has been constructed and a numerical analysis of site\nresponse was performed along two geological sections across the historical\ncentre of Rome. The numerical models were performed in both 1D and 2D\nconfigurations assuming linear and nonlinear conditions, by applying a three\ncomponent seismic input. The results show that the maximum shear strains are\nstrongly conditioned by the layer geometries (i.e. 2D or 1D conditions) and by\nthe soil heterogeneity. Moreover, the reliability of the maximum strains\nobtained by numerical modeling is discussed comparing these values respect to\nboth the volumetric and the degradation dynamic thresholds of the considered\nsoils.\n", "  We give introductions into the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra,\nWightman axioms and vertex algebras in the first part.\n  In the second part, we compare the above definitions. We give a proof of\nLuescher and Mack that a dilation invariant 2D QFT with an energy-momentum\ntensor gives rise to two commuting unitary representations of the Virasoro\nalgebra.\n  In the last chapter we compare Wightman QFTs to vertex algebras. We present\nKac's proof that every Wightman Moebius CFT (a 2D Wightman QFT containing\nquasiprimary fields) gives rise to two commuting strongly-generated\npositive-energy Moebius conformal vertex algebras. If the number of generating\nfields of each conformal weight is finite, then these vertex algebras are\nunitary quasi-vertex operator algebras. As a corollary using Luescher--Mack's\nTheorem we obtain that a Wightman CFT (a Wightman Moebius CFT with an\nenergy-momentum tensor) gives rise to a conformal vertex algebra which\nfurthermore becomes a unitary vertex operator algebra, if the number of\ngenerating fields of each conformal weight is finite. We reverse Kac's\narguments and get a converse proof that two unitary (quasi)-vertex operator\nalgebras can be combined to give a Wightman (Moebius) CFT.\n", "  A novel implementation for the skeletal reduction of large detailed reaction\nmechanisms using the directed relation graph with error propagation and\nsensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA) is developed and presented with examples for\nthree hydrocarbon components, n-heptane, iso-octane, and n-decane, relevant to\nsurrogate fuel development. DRGEPSA integrates two previously developed\nmethods, directed relation graph-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) and\ndirected relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP), by first applying DRGEP\nto efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to\nfurther remove unimportant species, producing an optimally small skeletal\nmechanism for a given error limit. It is illustrated that the combination of\nthe DRGEP and DRGASA methods allows the DRGEPSA approach to overcome the\nweaknesses of each, specifically that DRGEP cannot identify all unimportant\nspecies and that DRGASA shields unimportant species from removal. Skeletal\nmechanisms for n-heptane and iso-octane generated using the DRGEP, DRGASA, and\nDRGEPSA methods are presented and compared to illustrate the improvement of\nDRGEPSA. From a detailed reaction mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to\nn-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions, two skeletal mechanisms for\nn-decane generated using DRGEPSA, one covering a comprehensive range of\ntemperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio conditions for autoignition and\nthe other limited to high temperatures, are presented and validated. The\ncomprehensive skeletal mechanism consists of 202 species and 846 reactions and\nthe high-temperature skeletal mechanism consists of 51 species and 256\nreactions. Both mechanisms are further demonstrated to well reproduce the\nresults of the detailed mechanism in perfectly-stirred reactor and laminar\nflame simulations over a wide range of conditions.\n", "  Baryonic correlation functions provide an ideal tool to study parity doubling\nand chiral symmetry using lattice simulations. We present a study using $2+1$\nflavors of anisotropic Wilson clover fermions on the FASTSUM ensembles and find\nclear evidence that parity doubling emerges in the quark-gluon plasma. This\nresult is confirmed on the level of spectral functions, which are obtained\nusing a MEM reconstruction. We further highlight the importance of Gaussian\nsmearing in this study.\n", "  The mechanical response of embedded ABA trilayer graphene flakes loaded in\ntension and compression on polymer beams is monitored by simultaneous Raman\nmeasurements through the strain sensitivity of the G or 2D peaks. A\ncharacteristic peculiarity of the investigated flake is that it contains a\ntrilayer and bilayer part. The Bernal stacked bilayer was used as a strain\nsensor aiming to assess the efficiency of the load transfer from the polymer\nmatrix through shear to the individual graphene layers. For the trilayer\ngraphene in tension, both peaks are redshifted and splitting of the G peak is\nreported for the first time. In compression, the studied sample was an almost\nisolated trilayer, in which both peaks are blue-shifted up to a critical\ncompressive strain. This critical strain is found to be one fourth of the value\nfound in the case of single layer graphene despite the higher bending rigidity\nthat trilayer exhibits over the much thinner monolayer.\n", "  In this paper we study the stability and deformation of structures, in\nparticular the wall of an open pit mine is studied by using information\nobtained from a variety of remote sensors and some extra data, with a novelty\napproach considering the use of mathematical models and data mining techniques.\nIn particular we present two models to help the study the slope stability of\npit and the possible occurrence of movements. Primarily we present an static\nmodel for slow movements, which will help us identify areas of possible risks\nareas with time horizons of several months or years, depends on the available\ninformation, before the wall start moving, and secondly a dynamic short-term\nmodel, which help us to determine risks of collapse zones with several days in\nadvance. We remark that this methodology can be a powerful tool to plain future\nactions in order to simulate possible scenarios considering the production\nplans.\n", "  We extend the theory of disciplinary integration of games for science\neducation beyond the virtual world of games, and identify two key themes of a\npractice-based theoretical commitment to science learning: (1) materiality in\nthe classroom and (2) iterative design of multiple, complementary symbolic\ninscriptions (e.g., graphs and agent-based programs). We also identify the\naffordances of our proposed approach for facilitating student learning and\nteacher agency.\n", "  We demonstrated for the first time the condensation and precipitation (or\nsnowfall) induced by a corona discharge inside a cloud chamber. Ionic wind was\nfound to have played a more significant role than ions as extra Cloud\nCondensation Nuclei (CCN). 2.25 g of net snow enhancement was measured after\napplying a 30 kV corona discharge for 25 min. In comparison with another newly\nemerging femtosecond laser filamentation method, the snow precipitation induced\nby the corona discharge has about 4 orders of magnitude higher wall-plug\nefficiency under similar conditions.\n", "  A modified version of a published slug test model for unconfined aquifers is\napplied to cross-hole slug test data collected in field tests conducted at the\nWiden site in Switzerland. The model accounts for water-table effects using the\nlinearised kinematic condition. The model also accounts for inertial effects in\nsource and observation wells. The primary objective of this work is to\ndemonstrate applicability of this semi-analytical model to multi-well and\nmulti-level pneumatic slug tests. The pneumatic perturbation was applied at\ndiscrete intervals in a source well and monitored at discrete vertical\nintervals in observation wells. The source and observation well pairs were\nseparated by distances of up to 4 m. The analysis yielded vertical profiles of\nhydraulic conductivity, specific storage, and specific yield at observation\nwell locations. The hydraulic parameter estimates are compared to results from\nprior pumping and single-well slug tests conducted at the site, as well as to\nestimates from particle size analyses of sediment collected from boreholes\nduring well installation. The results are in general agreement with results\nfrom prior tests and are indicative of a sand and gravel aquifer. Sensitivity\nanalysis show that model identification of specific yield is strongest at\nlate-time. However, the usefulness of late-time data is limited due to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n", "  An introduction to loop quantum gravity is given, focussing on the\nfundamental aspects of the theory, different approaches to the dynamics, as\nwell as possible future directions. It is structured in five lectures,\nincluding exercises, and requires only little prior knowledge of quantum\nmechanics, gauge theory, and general relativity. The main aim of these lectures\nis to provide non-experts with an elementary understanding of loop quantum\ngravity and to evaluate the state of the art of the field. Technical details\nare avoided wherever possible.\n", "  Fundamental bosonic fields of arbitrary spin are predicted by generic\nextensions of the Standard Model and of General Relativity, and are\nwell-motivated candidates to explain the dark components of the Universe. One\nof most promising channels to look for their presence is through their\ngravitational interaction with compact objects. Within this context, in this\nthesis I study several mechanisms by which bosonic fields may affect the\ndynamics and structure of black holes and neutron stars. The first part of the\nthesis is devoted to the study of massive spin-2 fields around spherically\nsymmetric black-hole spacetimes. Massive spin-2 fields can be consistently\ndescribed within theories of massive gravity, making it possible to perform a\nsystematic study of the propagation of these fields in curved spacetimes. In\nparticular, I show that due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom in\nthese theories, the structure of black-hole solutions is richer than in General\nRelativity. In the second part of the thesis, I discuss in detail superradiant\ninstabilities in the context of black-hole physics. I show that several\nmechanisms, such as massive bosonic fields and magnetic fields, can turn\nspinning black holes unstable against superradiant modes, which has important\nimplications for astrophysics and for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the\nlast part of this thesis, I present a study of how bosonic dark matter\ncondensates interact gravitationally with compact stars. In particular, I show\nthat stable stellar configurations formed by a perfect fluid and a bosonic\ncondensate exist and can describe the late stages of dark matter accretion onto\nstars, in dark matter rich environments.\n", "  We present a simplified variant of the integrand reduction algorithm for\nmultiloop scattering amplitudes in $d = 4 - 2\\epsilon$ dimensions, which\nexploits the decomposition of the integration momenta in parallel and\northogonal subspaces, $d=d_\\parallel+d_\\perp$, where $d_\\parallel$ is the\ndimension of the space spanned by the legs of the diagrams. We discuss the\nadvantages of a lighter polynomial division algorithm and how the orthogonality\nrelations for Gegenbauer polynomilas can be suitably used for carrying out the\nintegration of the irreducible monomials, which eliminates spurious integrals.\nApplications to one- and two-loop integrals, for arbitrary kinematics, are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The co-orbital satellites of Saturn, Janus and Epimetheus, swap radial\npositions every 4.0 years. Since \\textit{Cassini} has been in orbit about\nSaturn, this has occurred on 21 January in 2006, 2010, and 2014. We describe\nthe effects of this radial migration in the Lindblad resonance locations of\nJanus within the rings. When the swap occurs such that Janus moves towards\nSaturn and Epimetheus away, nonlinear interference between now-relocated\ndensity waves launches a solitary wave that travels through the rings with a\nvelocity approximately twice that of the local spiral density wave group\nvelocity in the A ring and commensurate with the spiral density wave group\nvelocity in the B ring.\n", "  Classical isomorphism theorems due to Dynkin, Eisenbaum, Le Jan, Sznitman,\nestablish equalities in law between local times of random paths or ensemble of\npaths and the square of discrete Gaussian free fields on graphs. We extend\nthese results to the case of real or complex vector bundles of arbitrary rank\nover graphs endowed with a connection, by providing identities in law between\nfunctionals of the covariant Gaussian free fields and holonomies of random\npaths. As an application, we give a formula for computing moments of a large\nclass of random, in general non-Gaussian, sections in terms of holonomies of\nrandom paths with respect to an annealed random gauge field, in the spirit of\nSymanzik's foundational work on the subject.\n", "  An attempt was made to tailor the magnetostructural transitions (MSTs) over a\nwide temperature range under the principle of isostructural alloying. A series\nof wide Curie-temperature windows (CTWs) with a maximal width of 377 K between\n69 and 446 K were established in the Mn1-yCoyNiGe1-xSix system. Throughout the\nCTWs, the magnetic-field-induced metamagnetic behavior and giant magnetocaloric\neffects are obtained. The (Mn,Co)Ni(Ge,Si) system shows great potential as\nmultifunctional phase-transition materials that work in a wide range covering\nliquid-nitrogen and above water-boiling temperatures. Moreover, general\nunderstanding to isostructural alloying and CTWs constructed in\n(Mn,Co)Ni(Ge,Si) as well as (Mn,Fe)Ni(Ge,Si) are provided.\n", "  A full factorial design of experiments was used to study the effect of blend\nshear strain on the compaction process, relative density and strength of\npharmaceutical tablets. The powder blends were subjected to different shear\nstrain levels (integral of shear rate with respect to time) using an ad hoc\nCouette shear cell. Tablets were compressed at different compaction forces\nusing an instrumented compactor simulator, and compaction curves showing the\nforce-displacement profiles during compaction were obtained. Although the\ndie-fill blend porosity (initial porosity) and the minimum in-die tablet\nporosity (at maximum compaction) decreased significantly with shear strain, the\nfinal tablet porosity was surprisingly independent of shear strain. The\nincrease in the in-die maximum compaction with shear strain was, in fact,\ncompensated during post-compaction relaxation of the tables, which also\nincreased significantly with shear strain. Therefore, tablet porosity alone was\nnot sufficient to predict tablet tensile strength. A decrease in the 'work of\ncompaction' as a function of shear strain, and an increase in the recovered\nelastic work was observed, which suggested weaker particle-particle bonding as\nthe shear strain increased. For each shear strain level, the Ryskewitch\nDuckworth equation was a good fit to the tensile strength as a function of\ntablet porosity, and the obtained asymptotic tensile strength at zero porosity\nexhibited a 60% reduction as a function of shear strain. This was consistent\nwith a reduced bonding efficiency as the shear strain increased.\n", "  A decorated surface S is an oriented surface with punctures and a finite set\nof marked points on the boundary, such that each boundary component has a\nmarked point. We introduce ideal bipartite graphs on S. Each of them is related\nto a group G of type A, and gives rise to cluster coordinate systems on certain\nspaces of G-local systems on S. These coordinate systems generalize the ones\nassigned to ideal triangulations of S. A bipartite graph on S gives rise to a\nquiver with a canonical potential. The latter determines a triangulated 3d CY\ncategory with a cluster collection of spherical objects. Given an ideal\nbipartite graph on S, we define an extension of the mapping class group of S\nwhich acts by symmetries of the category. There is a family of open CY 3-folds\nover the universal Hitchin base, whose intermediate Jacobians describe the\nHitchin system. We conjecture that the 3d CY category with cluster collection\nis equivalent to a full subcategory of the Fukaya category of a generic\nthreefold of the family, equipped with a cluster collection of special\nLagrangian spheres. For SL(2) a substantial part of the story is already known\nthanks to Bridgeland, Keller, Labardini-Fragoso, Nagao, Smith, and others. We\nhope that ideal bipartite graphs provide special examples of the\nGaiotto-Moore-Neitzke spectral networks.\n", "  Magnetic field emerges at the surface of the Sun as sunspots and active\nregions. This process generates a poloidal magnetic field from a rising\ntoroidal flux tube, it is a crucial but poorly understood aspect of the solar\ndynamo. The emergence of magnetic field is also important because it is a key\ndriver of solar activity. We show that measurements of horizontal flows at the\nsolar surface around emerging active regions, in combination with numerical\nsimulations of solar magnetoconvection, can constrain the subsurface rise speed\nof emerging magnetic flux. The observed flows imply that the rise speed of the\nmagnetic field is no larger than 150 m/s at a depth of 20 Mm, that is, well\nbelow the prediction of the (standard) thin flux tube model but in the range\nexpected for convective velocities at this depth. We conclude that convective\nflows control the dynamics of rising flux tubes in the upper layers of the Sun\nand cannot be neglected in models of flux emergence.\n", "  On September 14, 2015, the newly upgraded Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) recorded a loud gravitational-wave (GW)\nsignal, emitted a billion light-years away by a coalescing binary of two\nstellar-mass black holes. The detection was announced in February 2016, in time\nfor the hundredth anniversary of Einstein's prediction of GWs within the theory\nof general relativity (GR). The signal represents the first direct detection of\nGWs, the first observation of a black-hole binary, and the first test of GR in\nits strong-field, high-velocity, nonlinear regime. In the remainder of its\nfirst observing run, LIGO observed two more signals from black-hole binaries,\none moderately loud, another at the boundary of statistical significance. The\ndetections mark the end of a decades-long quest, and the beginning of GW\nastronomy: finally, we are able to probe the unseen, electromagnetically dark\nUniverse by listening to it. In this article, we present a short historical\noverview of GW science: this young discipline combines GR, arguably the\ncrowning achievement of classical physics, with record-setting, ultra-low-noise\nlaser interferometry, and with some of the most powerful developments in the\ntheory of differential geometry, partial differential equations,\nhigh-performance computation, numerical analysis, signal processing,\nstatistical inference, and data science. Our emphasis is on the synergy between\nthese disciplines, and how mathematics, broadly understood, has historically\nplayed, and continues to play, a crucial role in the development of GW science.\nWe focus on black holes, which are very pure mathematical solutions of\nEinstein's gravitational-field equations that are nevertheless realized in\nNature, and that provided the first observed signals.\n", "  The diffusion of silver (Ag) impurities in high energy grain boundaries\n(HEGBs) of cubic (3C) silicon carbide (SiC) is studied using an ab initio based\nkinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model. This study assesses the hypothesis that the\nHEGB diffusion is responsible for Ag release in Tristructural-Isotropic fuel\nparticles, and provides a specific example to increase understanding of\nimpurity diffusion in highly disordered grain boundaries. The HEGB environment\nwas modeled by an amorphous SiC. The structure and stability of Ag defects were\ncalculated using density functional theory code. The defect energetics\nsuggested that the fastest diffusion takes place via an interstitial mechanism\nin a-SiC. The formation energy of Ag interstitials and the kinetic resolved\nactivation energies between them were well approximated with Gaussian\ndistributions that were then sampled in the kMC. The diffusion of Ag was\nsimulated with the effective medium model using kMC. At 1200-1600C, Ag in a\nHEGB is predicted to exhibit an Arrhenius type diffusion and with a diffusion\nprefactor and effective activation energy of (2.73+-1.09)*10-10 m2s-1 and\n2.79+-0.18 eV, respectively. The comparison between HEGB results to other\ntheoretical studies suggested not only that GB diffusion is predominant over\nbulk diffusion, but also that the HEGB is one of fastest grain boundary paths\nfor Ag diffusion in SiC. The Ag diffusion coefficient in the HEGB shows a good\nagreement with ion-implantation measurements, but is 2-3 orders of magnitude\nlower than the diffusion coefficients extracted from integral release\nmeasurements. The discrepancy between GB diffusion and integral release\nmeasurements suggests that other contributions are responsible for the fast\nrelease of Ag in some experiments and we propose that these contributions may\narise from radiation enhanced diffusion.\n", "  These are lecture notes from a weeklong course in quantum complexity theory\ntaught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016.\nThe focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates\nneeded to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary\ntransformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent\ninterest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and\nadvice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against\ncounterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information\nparadox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by\nHarlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience\nof theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and\nstarts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in\ngeneral.\n"]}
