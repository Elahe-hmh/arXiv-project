Closed\nform solutions to the eigenmode problem are given. For each polarization, the\nplasmonic mode with the highest quality is found to be an antiphase mode. We\nfound that the significant suppression in radiative loss can be understood as\nthe cancellation of the dipolar radiation term in the radiative linewidth. The\nremaining finite radiative linewidth decreases exponentially as the number of\nparticle increases.\n", "  We investigate the collective plasmonic modes of metal nano-particles in\nperiodic two-dimensional (2D) arrays within a point-dipole description. As an\nopen system, the full-dynamic dispersion relations of the 2D arrays are\nobtained through an efficient method which gives an effective polarizability\ndescribing the collective response of a system. Both the dispersion relations\nand mode qualities are simultaneously related to the imaginary part of the\neffective polarizability, which has contributions from the single-particle\nresponse as well as the inter-particle coupling. The transversal long-range\ndipolar interaction is dominated by a wave term together with a purely\ngeometrical constant representing the static geometrical contribution to\nresonant frequencies. As concrete examples, we considered small Ag spheres\narranged in a square lattice. We find that inside the light-cone, the\ntransverse quasi-mode has a reasonably high mode quality while the two in-plane\nmodes show significant radiation damping. Near the light-line, we observe\nstrong coupling with free photons for the bands of the transverse mode and the\ntransversal in-plane mode, and the longitudinal in-plane mode exhibits a\nnegative group-velocity inside the light-cone. Vanishing group velocities in\nthe light-cone for all the quasi-modes are found to be intrinsic properties of\nthe 2D metal nano-sphere dense arrays.\n", "  We study the group velocity of light in layer-by-layer chiral photonic\ncrystals composed of dielectrics and metals. Through studying the band\nstructures with an extended-zone scheme that is given by a Fourier analysis, we\nshow the existence of negative group velocity in the proposed chiral\nstructures. The physical mechanism is interpreted with the help of a simplified\nmodel that has an analytical solution. The iso-frequency contours of the\nphotonic band structure suggest that the negative group velocity can lead to\neither positive or negative refraction, depending on the orientation of the\nmedium interface. We propose a feasible realization of such kind of photonic\ncrystals. Computational results on the proposed realization are consistent with\nthat of the simplified models.\n", "  When the surface plasmon resonance in a metal-nanoparticle chain is excited\nat one point, the response signal will generally decay down the chain due to\nabsorption and radiation losses. The decay length is a key parameter in such\nplasmonic systems. By studying the plasmon lattice Green's function, we found\nthat the decay length is generally governed by two exponential decay constants\nwith phase factors corresponding to guided Bloch modes and one power-law decay\nwith a phase factor corresponding to that of free space photons. The results\nshow a high level of similarity between the absorptive and radiative decay\nchannels. By analyzing the poles (and the corresponding residues) of the\nGreen's function in a transformed complex reciprocal space, the dominant decay\nchannel of the real-space Green's function is understood.\n", "  The Drinfled realization of quantum affine algebras has been tremendously\nuseful since its discovery. Combining techniques of Beck and Nakajima with our\nprevious approach, we give a complete and conceptual proof of the Drinfeld\nrealization for the twisted quantum affine algebras using Lusztig's twisted\nbraid group action.\n", "  We experimentally investigate and quantitatively analyze the spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance effect in ferromagnetic insulator/platinum and ferromagnetic\ninsulator/nonferromagnetic metal/platinum hybrid structures. For the\nferromagnetic insulator we use either yttrium iron garnet, nickel ferrite or\nmagnetite and for the nonferromagnet copper or gold. The spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance effect is theoretically ascribed to the combined action of\nspin Hall and inverse spin Hall effect in the platinum metal top layer. It\ntherefore should characteristically depend upon the orientation of the\nmagnetization in the adjacent ferromagnet, and prevail even if an additional,\nnonferromagnetic metal layer is inserted between Pt and the ferromagnet. Our\nexperimental data corroborate these theoretical conjectures. Using the spin\nHall magnetoresistance theory to analyze our data, we extract the spin Hall\nangle and the spin diffusion length in platinum. For a spin mixing conductance\nof $4\\times10^{14}\\;\\mathrm{\\Omega^{-1}m^{-2}}$ we obtain a spin Hall angle of\n$0.11\\pm0.08$ and a spin diffusion length of $(1.5\\pm0.5)\\;\\mathrm{nm}$ for Pt\nin our thin film samples.\n", "  We show how a single linearly polarized control field can produce a sharply\ntunable group velocity of a weak probe field at resonance in a four-level\natomic configuration of alkali vapors. The dispersion can be switched from\nnormal to anomalous along with vanishing absorption, just by changing intensity\nof the resonant control field. In addition, by allowing different intensities\nof the different polarization components of the control field, the anomalous\ndispersion can be switched back to the normal. This thereby creates a \"valley\nof anomaly\" in group index variation and offers two sets of control field\nintensities, for which the system behaves like a vacuum. The explicit\nanalytical expressions for the probe coherence are provided along with all\nphysical explanations. We demonstrate our results in $J = 1/2 \\leftrightarrow J\n= 1/2$ transition for D_1 lines in alkali atoms, in which one can obtain a\ngroup index as large as $3.2\\times10^{8}$ and as negative as $-1.5\\times10^{5}$\nusing a control field with power as low as 0.017 mW/cm$^2$ and 9.56 mW/cm$^2$ .\n", "  The squeezed state of the electromagnetic field can be generated in many\nnonlinear optical processes and finds a wide range of applications in quantum\ninformation processing and quantum metrology. This article reviews the basic\nproperties of single-and dual-mode squeezed light states, methods of their\npreparation and detection, as well as their quantum technology applications.\n", "  Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation have\nshown an apparent tension with the present value of the Hubble parameter\ninferred from local observations of supernovae, which look closer, i.e.\nbrighter, than what is expected in a homogeneous model with a value of $H_0$\nequal to the one estimated from CMB observations. We examine the possibility\nthat such a discrepancy is the consequence of the presence of a local\ninhomogeneity seeded by primordial curvature perturbations, finding that a\nnegative peak of the order of less than two standard deviations could allow to\nfit low red-shift supernovae observations without the need of using a value of\nthe Hubble parameter different from $H_0^{CMB}$. The type of inhomogeneity we\nconsider does not modify the distance to the last scattering, making it\ncompatible with the constraints of the PLANCK mission data. Our calculation is\nfully relativistic and non perturbative, and for this reason shows important\neffects which were missed in the previous investigations using relativistic\nperturbations or Newtonian approximations, because the structures seeded by\nprimordial curvature perturbations can be today highly non linear, and\nrelativist Doppler terms cannot be neglected.\n  Comparison with studies of local structure based on galaxy surveys and\nluminosity density analysis reveals that the density profile we find could in\nfact be compatible with the one obtained for the same region of sky where is\nlocated most of the Cepheids used to calibrate the luminosity distance of the\nsupernovae employed for the local $H_0$ estimation, suggesting a possible\ndirectional dependence and calibration bias which could be partially attributed\nto the presence of the Sloan Great Wall.\n", "  We study the effects of a class of features of the inflaton potential,\ncorresponding to discontinuties in its derivatives. We perform fully numerical\ncalculations and derive analytical approximations for the curvature\npertubations spectrum and the bispectrum which are in good agreement with the\nnumerical results.\n  The spectrum of primordial perturbations has oscillations around the scale\n$k_0$ which leaves the horizon at the time $\\tau_0$ when the feature occurs,\nwith the amplitude and phase of the oscillations determined by the size and the\norder of the discontinuity. The large scale bispectrum in the squeezed and\nequilateral limits have a very similar form and are linearly suppressed. Both\nin the squeezed and equilateral small scale limit the bispectrum has an\noscillatory behavior whose phase depends on the parameters determining the\ndiscontinuity, and whose amplitude is inversely proportional to the scale.\nGiven the generality of this class of features they could be used to model or\nclassify phenomenologically different types of non Gaussian features\nencountered in observational data such as the cosmic microwave background\nradiation or large scale structure.\n", "  The standard formulation of quantum theory assumes a predefined notion of\ntime. This is a major obstacle in the search for a quantum theory of gravity,\nwhere the causal structure of space-time is expected to be dynamical and\nfundamentally probabilistic in character. Here, we propose a generalized\nformulation of quantum theory without predefined time or causal structure,\nbuilding upon a recently introduced operationally time-symmetric approach to\nquantum theory. The key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations and\nstates which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal. This\nallows us to express the time-symmetric formulation in a time-neutral form with\na clear physical interpretation, and ultimately drop the assumption of time. In\nthe resultant generalized formulation, operations are associated with regions\nthat can be connected in networks with no directionality assumed for the\nconnections, generalizing the standard circuit framework and the process matrix\nframework for operations without global causal order. The possible events in a\ngiven region are described by positive semidefinite operators on a Hilbert\nspace at the boundary, while the connections between regions are described by\nentangled states that encode a nontrivial symmetry and could be tested in\nprinciple. We discuss how the causal structure of space-time could be\nunderstood as emergent from properties of the operators on the boundaries of\ncompact space-time regions. The framework is compatible with indefinite causal\norder, timelike loops, and other acausal structures.\n", "  We describe an innovative statistical approach for the ab initio simultaneous\nanalysis of the formation history and morphology of the large-scale structure\nof the inhomogeneous Universe. Our algorithm explores the joint posterior\ndistribution of the many millions of parameters involved via efficient\nHamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We describe its application to\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 and an additional non-linear\nfiltering step. We illustrate the use of our findings for cosmic web analysis:\nidentification of structures via tidal shear analysis and inference of dark\nmatter voids.\n", "  In this work we consider gravitational theories in which the effect of\ncoupling characteristic classes, appropriately introduced as operators in the\nEinstein-Hilbert action, has been taken into account. As it is well known, this\napproach strays from the framework of general relativity since it results in\ntheories in which torsion can be present. We consider here all the\ncharacteristic classes that are consistent with a four-dimensional space-time\nmanifold. Then, we present explicit expressions for the contortion $1$-form and\ntorsion $2$-form that can be obtained under general conditions in various cases\nof interest. Additionally, we use the same framework to study cosmological\nscenarios that are obtained mainly by selecting the flat FLRW metric and an\nideal fluid.\n", "  $\\Upsilon(nS)$ and $\\chi_b(nP)$ (n=1,2,3) production at the LHC is studied at\nnext-to-leading order in $\\alpha_s$ in nonrelativistic QCD. Feeddown\ncontributions from higher $\\chi_b$ and $\\Upsilon$ states are all considered for\nlower $\\Upsilon$ cross sections and polarizations. The long distance matrix\nelements (LDMEs) are extracted from the yield data, and then used to make\npredictions for the $\\Upsilon(nS)$ polarizations, which are found to be\nconsistent with the measured polarization data within errors. In particular,\nthe $\\Upsilon(3S)$ polarization puzzle can be understood by a large feeddown\ncontribution from $\\chi_b(3P)$ states. Our results may provide a good\ndescription for both cross sections and polarizations of prompt $\\Upsilon(nS)$\nand $\\chi_b(nP)$ production at the LHC.\n", "  We present calculations of the correlation energies of crystalline solids and\nisolated systems within the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation\nformulation of density-functional theory. We perform a quantitative comparison\nof a set of model exchange-correlation kernels originally derived for the\nhomogeneous electron gas (HEG), including the recently-introduced renormalized\nadiabatic local-density approximation (rALDA) and also kernels which (a)\nsatisfy known exact limits of the HEG, (b) carry a frequency dependence or (c)\ndisplay a 1/$k^2$ divergence for small wavevectors. After generalizing the\nkernels to inhomogeneous systems through a reciprocal-space averaging\nprocedure, we calculate the lattice constants and bulk moduli of a test set of\n10 solids consisting of tetrahedrally-bonded semiconductors (C, Si, SiC), ionic\ncompounds (MgO, LiCl, LiF) and metals (Al, Na, Cu, Pd). We also consider the\natomization energy of the H$_2$ molecule. We compare the results calculated\nwith different kernels to those obtained from the random-phase approximation\n(RPA) and to experimental measurements. We demonstrate that the model kernels\ncorrect the RPA's tendency to overestimate the magnitude of the correlation\nenergy whilst maintaining a high-accuracy description of structural properties.\n", "  We show that the surface of an $s$-wave superconductor decorated with a\ntwo-dimensional lattice of magnetic impurities can exhibit chiral topological\nsuperconductivity. If impurities order ferromagnetically and the\nsuperconducting surface supports a sufficiently strong Rashba-type spin-orbit\ncoupling, Shiba sub-gap states at impurity locations can hybridize into\nBogoliubov bands with non-vanishing, sometimes large, Chern number $C$. This\ntopological superconductor supports $C$ chiral Majorana edge modes. We\nconstruct phase diagrams for model two-dimensional superconductors, accessing\nthe dilute and dense magnetic impurity limits analytically and the intermediate\nregime numerically. To address potential experimental systems, we identify\nstable configurations of ferromagnetic iron atoms on the Pb (111) surface and\nconclude that ferromagnetic adatoms on Pb surfaces can provide a versatile\nplatform for two-dimensional topological superconductivity.\n", "  In the present work it is shown that some specific double Higgs like\nmechanisms may have interesting cosmological applications. A hidden scenario\nwhich cast long lived super heavy particles together with an extremely light\nparticle $a$ with mass $m_a\\sim 10^{-32}-10^{-33}$eV is presented. The\npotential energy of this particle models the vacuum energy density of the\nuniverse $\\rho_c\\simeq 10^{-47}\\;\\hbox{GeV}^4$. The construction of such\nscenario is non trivial since the presence of light particles may spoil the\nstability of the heavy particles. However, double Higgs mechanisms may be\nhelpful for overcoming this problem. The hidden sector we propose include\nfermions with masses near the neutrino mass $m_\\nu\\sim 10^{-2}$eV which arise\nin terms of a see saw mechanism. Besides, the super heavy particles acquire a\nmass due to a double Higgs like mechanism of the order of the GUT scale. The\ngauge group of the model is $\\hbox{SU(2)}_L$ and the scalars of the double\nHiggs mechanism are not charged under these interactions. The light particle\n$a$ is the Goldstone boson associated to a Peccei-Quinn like symmetry in the\ndouble Higgs model. In addition, the double Higgs mechanism posses another CP\nodd scalar $A^0$, which acquire a mass of the order of the GUT scale. We show\nthat if there is no direct coupling between $A^0$ and $a$, even in presence of\nindirect couplings, the $A^0$ particle is long lived an may appear in events\nabove the GKZ bound in present times.\n", "  We initiate a systematic study of non-planar on-shell diagrams in N=4 SYM and\ndevelop powerful technology for doing so. We introduce canonical variables\ngeneralizing face variables, which make the dlog form of the on-shell form\nexplicit. We make significant progress towards a general classification of\narbitrary on-shell diagrams by means of two classes of combinatorial objects:\ngeneralized matching and matroid polytopes. We propose a boundary measurement\nthat connects general on-shell diagrams to the Grassmannian. Our proposal\nexhibits two important and non-trivial properties: positivity in the planar\ncase and it matches the combinatorial description of the diagrams in terms of\ngeneralized matroid polytopes. Interestingly, non-planar diagrams exhibit novel\nphenomena, such as the emergence of constraints on Plucker coordinates beyond\nPlucker relations when deleting edges, which are neatly captured by the\ngeneralized matching and matroid polytopes. This behavior is tied to the\nexistence of a new type of poles in the on-shell form at which combinations of\nPlucker coordinates vanish. Finally, we introduce a prescription, applicable\nbeyond the MHV case, for writing the on-shell form as a function of minors\ndirectly from the graph.\n", "  In order to estimate the effects of local structure on the Hubble parameter\nwe calculate the low-redshift expansion for $H(z)$ and $\\frac{\\delta H}{H}$ for\nan observer at the center of a spherically symmetric matter distribution in\npresence of a cosmological constant. We then test the accuracy of the formulae\ncomparing them with fully relativistic non perturbative numerical calculations\nfor different cases for the density profile. The low red-shift expansion we\nobtain gives results more precise than perturbation theory since is based on\nthe use of an exact solution of Einstein's field equations. For larger density\ncontrasts the low red-shift formulae accuracy improves respect to the\nperturbation theory accuracy because the latter is based on the assumption of a\nsmall density contrast, while the former does not rely on such assumption.\n  The formulae can be used to take into account the effects on the Hubble\nexpansion parameter due to the monopole component of the local structure. If\nthe $H(z)$ observations will show deviations from the $\\Lambda CDM$ prediction\ncompatible with the formulae we have derived, this could be considered an\nindependent evidence of the existence of a local inhomogeneity, and the\nformulae could be used to determine the characteristics of this local\nstructure.\n", "  Building upon our previous work, on graphical representation of a quantum\nstate by signless Laplacian matrix, we pose the following question. If a local\nunitary operation is applied to a quantum state, represented by a signless\nLaplacian matrix, what would be the corresponding graph and how does one\nimplement local unitary transformations graphically? We answer this question by\ndeveloping the notion of local unitary equivalent graphs. We illustrate our\nmethod by a few, well known, local unitary transformations implemented by\nsingle-qubit Pauli and Hadamard gates. We also show how graph switching can be\nused to implement the action of the CNOT gate, resulting in a graphical\ndescription of Bell state generation.\n", "  We consider nonlinear modes of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\nnonlocal nonlinearity and an additional PT-symmetric parabolic potential. We\nshow that there exists a set of continuous families of nonlinear modes and\nstudy their linear stability in the limit of small nonlinearity. It is\ndemonstrated that either PT symmetry or the nonlocality can be used to manage\nthe stability of the small-amplitude nonlinear modes. The stability properties\nare also found to depend on the particular shape of the nonlocal kernel.\nAdditional numerical simulations show that the stability results remain valid\nnot only for the infinitesimally small nonlinear modes, but also for the modes\nof finite amplitude\n", "  We provide a significant extension of the Hyperboloidal Foliation Method\nintroduced by the authors in 2014 in order to establish global existence\nresults for systems of quasilinear wave equations posed on a curved space, when\nwave equations and Klein-Gordon equations are coupled. This method is based on\na (3+1) foliation (of the interior of a future light cone in Minkowski\nspacetime) by spacelike and asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces. In the\nnew formulation of the method, we succeed to cover wave-Klein-Gordon systems\ncontaining \"strong interaction\" terms at the level of the metric, and then\ngeneralize our method in order to establish a new existence theory for the\nEinstein equations of general relativity. Following pioneering work by Lindblad\nand Rodnianski on the Einstein equations in wave coordinates, we establish the\nnonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime for self-gravitating massive scalar\nfields.\n", "  The performance of a radiatively cooled instrument is investigated in the\ncontext of optomechanical quantum experiments, where the environment of a\nmacroscopic particle in a quantum-superposition has to be cooled to less than\n20\\,K in deep space. A heat-transfer analysis between the components of the\ninstrument as well as a transfer-function analysis on thermal oscillations\ninduced by the spacecraft interior and by dissipative sources is performed. The\nthermal behaviour of the instrument in an orbit around a Lagrangian point and\nin a highly elliptical Earth orbit is discussed. Finally, we investigate\nfurther possible design improvements aiming at lower temperatures of the\nenvironment of the macroscopic particle. These include a mirror-based design of\nthe imaging system on the optical bench and the extension of the heat shields.\n", "  Real-time prediction of signals is a task often encountered in control\nproblems as well as by living systems. Here a model-free prediction approach\nbased on the coupling of a linear relaxation-delay system to a smooth,\nstationary signal is described. The resulting anticipatory relaxation dynamics\n(ARD) is a frequency-dependent predictor of future signal values. ARD not only\napproximately predicts signals on average but can anticipate the occurrence of\nsignal peaks, too. This can be explained by recognizing ARD as an input/output\nsystem with negative group delay. It is completely characterized, including its\nprediction horizon, by its analytically given frequency response function.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of top squarks at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) in a supersymmetric model where lepton number is identified with an\napproximate $U(1)_R$ symmetry in such a way that one of the left chiral\nsneutrinos can acquire a large vacuum expectation value ($vev$) and can play\nthe role of the down-type Higgs. This $R$-symmetry allows a subset of trilinear\n$R$-parity violating interactions, which determine the collider phenomenology\nof this model in a significant way. The gauginos are Dirac particles and\ngluinos are relatively heavy in this class of models. The model contains a\nright handed neutrino superfield, which gives a tree level mass to one of the\nactive neutrinos. An order one neutrino Yukawa coupling also helps enhance the\nHiggs boson mass at the tree level and results in a very light bino-like\nneutralino ($\\widetilde \\chi_2^0$) with mass around a few hundred MeV, which is\na carrier of missing (transverse) energy (\\met). The model can accommodate two\nrather light top squarks, compatible with the observed mass of the Higgs boson.\nThe lighter top squark (${\\widetilde t}_1$) can decay into\n$t\\widetilde\\chi_2^0$, and thus the signal would be similar to the signal of\ntop quark pair production at the LHC. In addition, fully visible decays such as\n${\\widetilde t}_2 \\rightarrow b e^+$ can give rise to interesting final states.\nSuch signals at the LHC combined with other features like a heavy gluino could\nprovide a strong evidence for this kind of a model. Our analysis shows that\n$m_{\\widetilde t_1}\\lsim 575~(750)$ GeV and $m_{\\widetilde t_2}\\lsim 1.2~(1.4)$\nTeV can be probed with 5$\\sigma$ statistical significance at the 13 TeV LHC\nwith 300~(3000) fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Finally, we observe that in\nthe presence of super-light carriers of \\met, the so-called `stealth' top\nsquark scenario may naturally appear in our model.\n", "  We study the effects of a class of features of the potential of slow-roll\ninflationary models corresponding to a step symmetrically dumped by an even\npower negative exponential factor, which we call local features. Local-type\nfeatures differ from other branch-type features considered previously, because\nthe potential is only affected in a limited range of the scalar field value,\nand are symmetric respect to the location of the feature. This type of features\nonly affects the spectrum and bispectrum in a narrow range of scales which\nleave the horizon during the time interval corresponding to the modification of\nthe potential. On the contrary branch-type features have effects on all the\nperturbation modes leaving the horizon when the field value is within the\ninterval defining the branch, introducing for example differences in the power\nspectrum between large and small scale which are absent in the case of\nlocal-type features. The spectrum and bispectrum of primordial curvature\nperturbations are affected by oscillations around the scale $k_0$ exiting the\nhorizon at the time $\\tau_0$ corresponding to the feature. We also compute the\neffects of the features on the CMB temperature and polarization spectra,\nshowing the effects or different choices of parameters.\n", "  We discuss the large mass hierarchy problem in a braneworld model which\nrepresents our acceleratively expanding universe. The Randall-Sundrum (RS)\nmodel with warped one extra dimension added to flat 4-dimensional space-time\ncannot describe our expanding universe. Here, we study instead the de Sitter\nthin brane model. This is described by the same action as that for the RS\nmodel, but the 4-dimensional space-time on the branes is $\\rm dS_4$. We study\nthe model for both the cases of positive 5-dimensional cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda_5$ and negative one. In the positive $\\Lambda_5$ case, the\n4-dimensional large hierarchy necessitates a 5-dimensional large hierarchy, and\nwe cannot get a natural explanation. On the other hand, in the negative\n$\\Lambda_5$ case, the large hierarchy is naturally realized in the\n5-dimensional theory in the same manner as in the RS model. Moreover, another\nlarge hierarchy between the Hubble parameter and the Planck scale is realized\nby the ${\\mathcal O}(10^2)$ hierarchy of the 5-dimensional quantities. Finally,\nwe find that the lightest mass of the massive Kaluza-Klein modes and the\nintervals of the mass spectrum are of order $10^2\\,\\rm GeV$, which are the same\nas in the RS case and do not depend on the value of the Hubble parameter.\n", "  The paper reviews and discusses four ideas scattered in previous papers of\nthe author. First, objective properties of quantum systems are not associated\nwith observables but are defined by preparations. Second, measurable results of\nclassical theories are not sharp. All such results can be obtained as\nhigh-entropy limits of quantum mechanics. Third, a careful study of exchange\nsymmetry requires a modification of the theory of measurement. Fourth, screens\nand detectors are closely associated with state reduction. A new, rather\nimproved understanding of quantum mechanics is achieved without any deep\nchanges of the theory itself. In the framework of a model approach to the\nphilosophy of science, the RCU interpretation is developed step by step by\nadding specific supplementary hypotheses to the Minimum Interpretation of\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  Recently, the Yang-Mills gradient flow is found to be a useful concept not\nonly in lattice simulations but also in continuous field theories. Since its\nsmearing property is similar to the Wilsoninan \"block spin transformation\",\nthere might be deeper connection between them. In this work, we define the\n\"effective action\" which generates configurations at a finite flow time and\nderive the exact differential equation to investigate the flow time dependence\nof the action. Then Yang-Mills gradient flow can be regarded as the flow of the\neffective action. We also propose the flow time dependent gradient, where the\ndifferential equation becomes similar to the renormalization group equation. We\ndiscuss a possibility to regard the time evolution of the effective action as\nthe Wilsonian renormalization group flow.\n", "  Low-temperature properties of crystalline solids can be understood using\nharmonic perturbations around a perfect lattice, as in Debye's theory.\nLow-temperature properties of amorphous solids, however, strongly depart from\nsuch descriptions, displaying enhanced transport, activated slow dynamics\nacross energy barriers, excess vibrational modes with respect to Debye's theory\n(i.e., a Boson Peak), and complex irreversible responses to small mechanical\ndeformations. These experimental observations indirectly suggest that the\ndynamics of amorphous solids becomes anomalous at low temperatures. Here, we\npresent direct numerical evidence that vibrations change nature at a\nwell-defined location deep inside the glass phase of a simple glass former. We\nprovide a real-space description of this transition and of the rapidly growing\ntime and length scales that accompany it. Our results provide the seed for a\nuniversal understanding of low-temperature glass anomalies within the\ntheoretical framework of the recently discovered Gardner phase transition.\n", "  The problem of entanglement detection for arbitrary spin systems is analyzed.\nWe demonstrate how a single measurement of the squared total spin can\nprobabilistically discern separable from entangled many-particle states. For\nachieving this goal, we construct a tripartite analogy between the degeneracy\nof entanglement witness eigenstates, tensor products of $SO(3)$ representations\nand classical lattice walks with special constraints. Within this framework,\ndegeneracies are naturally given by generalized Catalan numbers and determine\nthe fraction of states that are decidedly entangled and also known to be\nsomewhat protected against decoherence. In addition, we introduce the concept\nof a \"sterile entanglement witness\", which for large enough systems detects\nentanglement without affecting much the system's state. We discuss when our\nproposed entanglement witness can be regarded as a sterile one.\n", "  Based on the ab initio calculations, we show that MoTe2, in its\nlow-temperature orthorhombic structure characterized by an X-ray diffraction\nstudy at 100 K, realizes 4 type-II Weyl points between the N-th and N+1-th\nbands, where N is the total number of valence electrons per unit cell. Other\nWPs and nodal lines between different other bands also appear close to the\nFermi level due to a complex topological band structure. We predict a series of\nstrain-driven topological phase transitions in this compound, opening a wide\nrange of possible experimental realizations of different topological semimetal\nphases. Crucially, with no strain, the number of observable surface Fermi arcs\nin this material is 2 - the smallest number of arcs consistent with\ntime-reversal symmetry.\n", "  Building on a recent proposal for a quantum reduction to spherical symmetry\nfrom full loop quantum gravity, we investigate the relation between a\nquantisation of spherically symmetric general relativity and a reduction at the\nquantum level. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed quantum\nreduction by dropping the gauge fixing condition on the radial diffeomorphisms,\nthus allowing to make direct contact between previous work on reduced\nquantisation. A dictionary between spherically symmetric variables and\nobservables with respect to the reduction constraints in the full theory is\ndiscussed, as well as an embedding of reduced quantum states to a sub sector of\nthe quantum symmetry reduced full theory states. On this full theory sub\nsector, the quantum algebra of the mentioned observables is computed and shown\nto qualitatively reproduce the quantum algebra of the reduced variables in the\nlarge quantum number limit for a specific choice of regularisation.\nInsufficiencies in recovering the reduced algebra quantitatively from the full\ntheory are attributed to the oversimplified full theory quantum states we use.\n", "  Using bifurcation theory, we study the secular resonances induced by the Sun\nand Moon on space debris orbits around the Earth. In particular, we concentrate\non a special class of secular resonances, which depend only on the debris'\norbital inclination. This class is typically subdivided into three distinct\ntypes of secular resonances: those occurring at the critical inclination, those\ncorresponding to polar orbits, and a third type resulting from a linear\ncombination of the rates of variation of the argument of perigee and the\nlongitude of the ascending node.\n  The model describing the dynamics of space debris includes the effects of the\ngeopotential, as well as the Sun's and Moon's attractions, and it is defined in\nterms of suitable action-angle variables. We consider the system averaged over\nboth the mean anomaly of the debris and those of the Sun and Moon. Such\nmultiply-averaged Hamiltonian is used to study the lunisolar resonances which\ndepend just on the inclination.\n  Borrowing the technique from the theory of bifurcations of Hamiltonian normal\nforms, we study the birth of periodic orbits and we determine the energy\nthresholds at which the bifurcations of lunisolar secular resonances take\nplace. This approach gives us physically relevant information on the existence\nand location of the equilibria, which help us to identify stable and unstable\nregions in the phase space. Besides their physical interest, the study of\ninclination dependent resonances offers interesting insights from the dynamical\npoint of view, since it sheds light on different phenomena related to\nbifurcation theory.\n", "  We carefully study the implications of adiabaticity for the behavior of\ncosmological perturbations. There are essentially three similar but different\ndefinitions of non-adiabaticity: one is appropriate for a thermodynamic fluid\n$\\delta P_{nad}$, another is for a general matter field $\\delta P_{c,nad}$, and\nthe last one is valid only on superhorizon scales. The first two definitions\ncoincide if $c_s^2=c_w^2$ where $c_s$ is the propagation speed of the\nperturbation, while $c_w^2=\\dot P/\\dot\\rho$. Assuming the adiabaticity in the\ngeneral sense, $\\delta P_{c,nad}=0$, we derive a relation between the lapse\nfunction in the comoving sli\\-cing $A_c$ and $\\delta P_{nad}$ valid for\narbitrary matter field in any theory of gravity, by using only momentum\nconservation. The relation implies that as long as $c_s\\neq c_w$, the uniform\ndensity, comoving and the proper-time slicings coincide approximately for any\ngravity theory and for any matter field if $\\delta P_{nad}=0$ approximately. In\nthe case of general relativity this gives the equivalence between the comoving\ncurvature perturbation $R_c$ and the uniform density curvature perturbation\n$\\zeta$ on superhorizon scales, and their conservation.\n  We then consider an example in which $c_w=c_s$, where $\\delta P_{nad}=\\delta\nP_{c,nad}=0$ exactly, but the equivalence between $R_c$ and $\\zeta$ no longer\nholds. Namely we consider the so-called ultra slow-roll inflation. In this case\nboth $R_c$ and $\\zeta$ are not conserved. In particular, as for $\\zeta$, we\nfind that it is crucial to take into account the next-to-leading order term in\n$\\zeta$'s spatial gradient expansion to show its non-conservation, even on\nsuperhorizon scales. This is an example of the fact that adiabaticity (in the\nthermodynamic sense) is not always enough to ensure the conservation of $R_c$\nor $\\zeta$.\n", "  A central problem in many-body quantum physics is the determination of the\nground state of a thermodynamically large physical system. We construct a\ncluster expansion for ground states of local Hamiltonians, which naturally\nincorporates physical requirements inherited by locality as conditions on its\ncluster amplitudes. Applying a diagrammatic technique we derive the relation of\nthese amplitudes to thermodynamic quantities and local observables. Moreover we\nderive a set of functional equations that determine the cluster amplitudes for\na general Hamiltonian, verify the consistency with perturbation theory and\ndiscuss non-perturbative approaches. Lastly we verify the persistence of\nlocality features of the cluster expansion under unitary evolution with a local\nHamiltonian and provide applications to out-of-equilibrium problems: a\nsimplified proof of equilibration to the GGE and a cumulant expansion for the\nstatistics of work, for an interacting-to-free quench.\n", "  The Wigner distributions for u and d quarks in a proton are calculated using\nthe light front wave functions (LFWFs) of the scalar quark-diquark model for\nnucleon constructed from the soft-wall AdS/QCD correspondence. We present a\ndetail study of the quark orbital angular momentum(OAM) and its correlation\nwith quark spin and proton spin. The quark density distributions, considering\nthe different polarizations of quarks and proton, in transverse momentum plane\nas well as in transverse impact parameter plane are presented for both u and d\nquarks.\n", "  It is shown that the leaky integrator, the basis for many neuronal models,\npossesses a negative group delay when a time-delayed recurrent inhibition is\nadded to it. By means of this negative group delay, the leaky integrator\nbecomes a predictor for some frequency components of the input signal. The\nprediction properties are derived analytically and an application to a local\nfield potential is provided.\n", "  In this paper we consider the separability problem for bipartite quantum\nstates arising from graphs. Earlier it was proved that the degree criterion is\nthe graph-theoretic counterpart of the familiar positive partial transpose\ncriterion for separability, although there are entangled states with positive\npartial transpose for which the degree criterion fails. Here we introduce the\nconcept of partially symmetric graphs and degree symmetric graphs by using the\nwell-known concept of partial transposition of a graph and degree criteria,\nrespectively. Thus, we provide classes of bipartite separable states of\ndimension $m \\times n$ arising from partially symmetric graphs. We identify\npartially asymmetric graphs that lack the property of partial symmetry. We\ndevelop a combinatorial procedure to create a partially asymmetric graph from a\ngiven partially symmetric graph. We show that this combinatorial operation can\nact as an entanglement generator for mixed states arising from partially\nsymmetric graphs.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg inequality, an analogue of Bell's inequality involving\ncorrelations of measurements on a system at different times, stands as one of\nthe hallmark tests of quantum mechanics against classical predictions. The\nphenomenon of neutrino oscillations should adhere to quantum-mechanical\npredictions and provide an observable violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality.\nWe demonstrate how oscillation phenomena can be used to test for violations of\nthe classical bound by performing measurements on an ensemble of neutrinos at\ndistinct energies, as opposed to a single neutrino at distinct times. A study\nof the MINOS experiment's data shows a greater than $6{\\sigma}$ violation over\na distance of 735 km, representing the longest distance over which either the\nLeggett-Garg inequality or Bell's inequality has been tested.\n", "  We analyze charged-current electron-neutrino cross sections on Carbon. We\nconsider two different theoretical approaches, on one hand the Continuum Random\nPhase Approximation (CRPA) which allows a description of giant resonances and\nquasielastic excitations, on the other hand the RPA-based calculations which\nare able to describe multinucleon emission and coherent and incoherent pion\nproduction as well as quasielastic excitations. We compare the two approaches\nin the genuine quasielastic channel, and find a satisfactory agreement between\nthem at large energies while at low energies the collective giant resonances\nshow up only in the CRPA approach. We also compare electron-neutrino cross\nsections with the corresponding muon-neutrino ones in order to investigate the\nimpact of the different charged-lepton masses. Finally, restricting to the\nRPA-based approach we compare the sum of quasielastic, multinucleon emission,\ncoherent and incoherent one-pion production cross sections (folded with the\nelectron-neutrino T2K flux) with the charged-current inclusive\nelectron-neutrino differential cross sections on Carbon measured by T2K. We\nfind a good agreement with the data. The multinucleon component is needed in\norder to reproduce the T2K electron-neutrino inclusive cross sections.\n", "  In the Standard Model (SM) the branching ratio for the decay $K_L \\to \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}$ into two neutrinos is helicity suppressed and predicted to be very\nsmall $ \\leq O(10^{-17})$. We consider two natural extensions of the SM, such\nas two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and the $\\nu$MSM with additional singlet\nscalar, those main features is that they can lead to an enhanced $Br(K_L \\to\ninvisible)$. In the 2HDM the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained due to\nthe smallness of the second Higgs doublet vacuum expectation value. Moreover,\nthe $\\nu$MSM extension with additional singlet field can explain the $(g - 2)$\nmuon anomaly. The considered models demonstrate that the $K_L \\to invisible $\ndecay is a clean probe of new physics scales well above 100 TeV, that is\ncomplementary to rare $K \\to \\pi+invisible$ decay, and provide a strong\nmotivation for its sensitive search in a near future low-energy experiment.\n", "  Gate control of donor electrons near interfaces is a generic ingredient of\ndonor-based quantum computing. Here, we address the question: how is the\nphonon-assisted qubit relaxation time $T_1$ affected as the electron is\nshuttled between the donor and the interface? We focus on the example of the\n`flip-flop qubit' [Tosi et al., arXiv:1509.08538v1], defined as a combination\nof the nuclear and electronic states of a phosphorous donor in silicon,\npromising fast electrical control and long dephasing times when the electron is\nhalfway between the donor and the interface. We theoretically describe orbital\nrelaxation, flip-flop relaxation, and electron spin relaxation. We estimate\nthat the flip-flop qubit relaxation time can be of the order of $100 \\,\n\\mu\\text{s}$, 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the value for an on-donor\nelectron in bulk silicon, and a few orders of magnitude shorter (longer) than\nthe predicted inhomogeneous dephasing time (gate times). All three relaxation\nprocesses are boosted by (i) the nontrivial valley structure of the\nelectron-phonon interaction, and (ii) the different valley compositions of the\ninvolved electronic states.\n", "  We show that short-range correlations have a dramatic impact on the\nsteady-state phase diagram of quantum driven-dissipative systems. This effect,\nnever observed in equilibrium, follows from the fact that ordering in the\nsteady state is of dynamical origin, and is established only at very long\ntimes, whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium it arises from the properties of\nthe (free) energy. To this end, by combining the cluster methods extensively\nused in equilibrium phase transitions to quantum trajectories and\ntensor-network techniques, we extend them to nonequilibrium phase transitions\nin dissipative many-body systems. We analyze in detail a model of spin-1=2 on a\nlattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of them coupled to an\nindependent environment that induces incoherent spin flips. In the steady-state\nphase diagram derived from our cluster approach, the location of the phase\nboundaries and even its topology radically change, introducing reentrance of\nthe paramagnetic phase as compared to the single-site mean field where\ncorrelations are neglected. Furthermore, a stability analysis of the cluster\nmean field indicates a susceptibility towards a possible incommensurate\nordering, not present if short-range correlations are ignored.\n", "  A measurement of the Z gamma to nu nu-bar gamma production cross section in\npp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is presented, using data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC. This measurement is based on the observation of events\nwith large missing energy and with a single photon with transverse momentum\nabove 145 GeV and absolute pseudorapidity in the range |eta| < 1.44. The\nmeasured Z gamma to nu nu-bar gamma production cross section, 52.7 +/-\n2.1(stat) +/- 6.4 (syst) +/- 1.4 (lumi) fb, agrees well with the standard model\nprediction of 50.0 +2.4 -2.2 fb. A study of the photon transverse momentum\nspectrum yields the most stringent limits to date on the anomalous Z-Z-gamma\nand Z-gamma-gamma trilinear gauge boson couplings.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for supersymmetry with gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking in electroweak production. Final states with photons and\nlarge missing transverse energy (MET) were examined. The data sample was\ncollected in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC\nand corresponds to 7.4 inverse femtobarns. The analysis focuses on scenarios in\nwhich the lightest neutralino has bino- or wino-like components, resulting in\ndecays to photons and gravitinos, where the gravitinos escape undetected. The\ndata were obtained using a specially designed trigger with dedicated low\nthresholds, providing good sensitivity to signatures with photons, MET, and low\nhadronic energy. No excess of events over the standard model expectation is\nobserved. The results are interpreted using the model of general gauge\nmediation. With the wino mass fixed at 10 GeV above that of the bino, wino\nmasses below 710 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also\nset in the context of two simplified models, for which the analysis sets the\nlowest cross section limits on the electroweak production of supersymmetric\nparticles.\n", "  A detailed analysis of the lowest two moments of the $\\phi$ meson spectral\nfunction in vacuum and nuclear matter is performed. The consistency is examined\nbetween the constraints derived from finite energy QCD sum rules and the\nspectra computed within an improved vector dominance model, incorporating the\ncoupling of kanonic degrees of freedom with the bare $\\phi$ meson. In the\nvacuum, recent accurate measurements of the $e^+ e^- \\to K^+ K^-$ cross section\nallow us to determine the spectral function with high precision. In nuclear\nmatter, the modification of the spectral function can be described by the\ninteractions of the kaons from $\\phi \\rightarrow K\\bar{K}$ with the surrounding\nnuclear medium. This leads primarily to a strong broadening and an asymmetric\ndeformation of the $\\phi$ meson peak structure. We confirm that, both in vacuum\nand nuclear matter, the zeroth and first moments of the corresponding spectral\nfunctions satisfy the requirements of the finite energy sum rules to a\nremarkable degree of accuracy. Limits on the strangeness sigma term of the\nnucleon are examined in this context. Applying our results to the second moment\nof the spectrum, we furthermore discuss constraints on four-quark condensates\nand the validity of the commonly used ground state saturation approximation.\n", "  We investigate the expected rates and bolometric light-curve properties of\nstripped-envelope electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) using stellar models from\nthe Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code. We find that 0.8 per\ncent (Z = 0.020) and 1.2 per cent (Z = 0.004) of core-collapse supernovae are\nstripped-envelope ECSNe. Their typical ejecta masses are estimated to be about\n0.3 Msun (Z = 0.020) and 0.6 Msun (Z = 0.004). Assuming ECSN explosion\nproperties from numerical explosion simulations, an explosion energy of 1.5e50\nerg and a 56Ni mass of 2.5e-3 Msun, we find that stripped-envelope ECSNe have a\ntypical rise time of around 7 days (Z = 0.020) or 13 days (Z = 0.004) and peak\nluminosity of around 1e41 erg/s (-13.8 mag, Z = 0.020) or 7e40 erg/s (-13.4\nmag, Z = 0.004). Their typical ejecta velocities are around 7000 km/s (Z =\n0.020) or 5000 km/s (Z = 0.004). Thus, stripped-envelope ECSNe are observed as\nrapidly-evolving faint transients with relatively small velocities. SN\n2008ha-like supernovae, which are the faintest kind of SN 2002cx-like (a.k.a.\nType Iax) supernovae, may be related to stripped-envelope ECSNe.\n", "  We theoretically analyse a recent experiment reporting the observation of a\nself-amplifying Hawking radiation in a flowing atomic condensate [J.Steinhauer,\nNature Physics, vol.10, pp.864, Nov 2014]. We are able to accurately reproduce\nthe experimental observations using a theoretical model based on the numerical\nsolution of a mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation that does not include\nquantum fluctuations of the matter field. In addition to confirming the black\nhole lasing mechanism, our results show that the underlying dynamical\ninstability has a classical hydrodynamic origin and is triggered by a seed of\ndeterministic nature, linked to the non-stationary of the process, rather than\nby thermal or zero-point fluctuations.\n", "  The charge asymmetry in t t-bar events is measured using dilepton final\nstates produced in pp collisions at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The data\nsample, collected with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.5 inverse femtobarns. The measurements are performed using\nevents with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons) and two or more\njets, where at least one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom\nquark. The charge asymmetry is measured from differences in kinematic\ndistributions, unfolded to the parton level, of positively and negatively\ncharged top quarks and leptons. The t t-bar and leptonic charge asymmetries are\nfound to be 0.011 +/- 0.011 (stat) +/- 0.007 (syst) and 0.003 +/- 0.006 (stat)\n+/- 0.003 (syst), respectively. These results, as well as charge asymmetry\nmeasurements made as a function of the invariant mass, rapidity, and transverse\nmomentum of the t t-bar system, are in agreement with predictions of the\nstandard model.\n", "  Bell inequality is a mathematical inequality derived using the assumptions of\nlocality and realism. Its violation guarantees the existence of quantum\ncorrelations in a quantum state. Bell inequality acts as an entanglement\nwitness in the sense that a pure bipartite quantum state, having nonvanishing\nentanglement, always violates a Bell inequality. We construct Bell-type\ninequalities for product states in quantum coherence theory for different\nmeasures of coherence, and find that the maximally entangled states violate\nthese inequalities. We further show that Bell-type inequalities for relative\nentropy of coherence is violated by all two-qubit pure entangled states,\nserving as an entanglement witness.\n", "  We investigate stochastic thermodynamics of a two-particles Langevin system.\nEach particle is in contact with a heat bath at different temperatures $T_1$\nand $T_2~(<T_1)$, respectively. Particles are trapped by a harmonic potential\nand driven by a linear external force. The system can act as an autonomous heat\nengine performing work against the external driving force. Linearity of the\nsystem enables us to examine thermodynamic properties of the engine\nanalytically. We find that the efficiency of the engine at maximum power\n$\\eta_{MP}$ is given by $\\eta_{MP} = 1-\\sqrt{T_2/T_1}$. This universal form has\nbeen known as a characteristic of endoreversible heat engines. Our result\nextends the universal behavior of $\\eta_{MP}$ to non-endoreversible engines. We\nalso obtain the large deviation function of the probability distribution for\nthe stochastic efficiency in the overdamped limit. The large deviation function\ntakes the minimum value at mean efficiency $\\eta = \\bar{\\eta}$ and increases\nmonotonically until it reaches plateaus when $\\eta \\leq \\eta_L$ and $\\eta \\geq\n\\eta_R$ with model dependent parameters $\\eta_{R,L}$. It has been known for\nheat engines with a finite number of microscopic configurations with\ntime-symmetric protocol that the probability of achieving the Carnot efficiency\nis minimum. Our result reveals that the least likeliness of the Carnot\nefficiency is not the generic property of heat engines.\n", "  We study the resonant dynamics in a simple one degree of freedom, time\ndependent Hamiltonian model describing spin-orbit interactions. The equations\nof motion admit periodic solutions associated with resonant motions, the most\nimportant being the synchronous one in which most evolved satellites of the\nSolar system, including the Moon, are observed. Such primary resonances can be\nsurrounded by a chain of smaller islands which one refers to as secondary\nresonances. Here, we propose a novel canonical normalization procedure allowing\nto obtain a higher order normal form, by which we obtain analytical results on\nthe stability of the primary resonances as well as on the bifurcation\nthresholds of the secondary resonances. The procedure makes use of the\nexpansion in a parameter, called the detuning, measuring the shift from the\nexact secondary resonance. Also, we implement the so-called `book-keeping'\nmethod, i.e., the introduction of a suitable separation of the terms in orders\nof smallness in the normal form construction, which deals simultaneously with\nall the small parameters of the problem. Our analytical computation of the\nbifurcation curves is in excellent agreement with the results obtained by a\nnumerical integration of the equations of motion, thus providing relevant\ninformation on the parameter regions where satellites can be found in a stable\nconfiguration.\n", "  We present our recent progress on the relativistic modeling of\nelectron-nucleus reactions and compare our predictions with inclusive $^{12}$C\n($e,e'$) experimental data in a wide kinematical region. The model, originally\nbased on the superscaling phenomenon shown by electron-nucleus scattering data,\nhas recently been improved through the inclusion of Relativistic Mean Field\ntheory effects that take into account the enhancement of the transverse scaling\nfunction compared with its longitudinal counterpart. We also discuss the impact\nof meson-exchange currents (MEC) through the analysis of two-particle two-hole\nlongitudinal and transverse contributions to electromagnetic response functions\nevaluated within the framework of the relativistic Fermi gas. The formalism is\nalso extended to include the complete inelastic spectrum -- resonant,\nnon-resonant and deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The results show quite good\nagreement with data over the whole range of energy transfer, including the dip\nregion between the quasielastic peak and the $\\Delta$ resonance.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum spin-1 chain whose Hamiltonian\nis invariant under a global onsite $A_4$, translation and lattice inversion\nsymmetries. We detect different gapped phases characterized by SPT order and\nsymmetry breaking using matrix product state order parameters. We observe a\nrich variety of phases of matter characterized by a combination of symmetry\nbreaking and symmetry fractionalization and also the interplay between the\nonsite and spatial symmetries. Examples of continuous phase transitions\ndirectly between topologically nontrivial SPT phases are also observed.\n", "  Based on thermodynamic principles, we derive expressions quantifying the\nnon-harmonic vibrational behavior of materials, which are rigorous yet easily\nevaluated from experimentally available data for the thermal expansion\ncoefficient and the phonon density of states. These experimentally- derived\nquantities are valuable to benchmark first-principles theoretical predictions\nof harmonic and non-harmonic thermal behaviors using perturbation theory, ab\ninitio molecular-dynamics, or Monte-Carlo simulations. We illustrate this\nanalysis by computing the harmonic, dilational, and anharmonic contributions to\nthe entropy, internal energy, and free energy of elemental aluminum and the\nordered compound FeSi over a wide range of temperature. Results agree well with\nprevious data in the literature and provide an efficient approach to estimate\nanharmonic effects in materials.\n", "  In this work we express the partition function of the integrable elliptic\nsolid-on-solid model with domain-wall boundary conditions as a single\ndeterminant. This representation appears naturally as the solution of a system\nof functional equations governing the model's partition function.\n", "  The advent of devices based on single dopants, such as the single atom\ntransistor, the single spin magnetometer and the single atom memory, motivates\nthe quest for strategies that permit to control matter with atomic precision.\nManipulation of individual atoms by means of low-temperature scanning\ntunnelling microscopy provides ways to store data in atoms, encoded either into\ntheir charge state, magnetization state or lattice position. A defining\nchallenge at this stage is the controlled integration of these individual\nfunctional atoms into extended, scalable atomic circuits. Here we present a\nrobust digital atomic scale memory of up to 1 kilobyte (8,000 bits) using an\narray of individual surface vacancies in a chlorine terminated Cu(100) surface.\nThe memory can be read and rewritten automatically by means of atomic scale\nmarkers, and offers an areal density of 502 Terabits per square inch,\noutperforming state-of-the-art hard disk drives by three orders of magnitude.\nFurthermore, the chlorine vacancies are found to be stable at temperatures up\nto 77 K, offering prospects for expanding large-scale atomic assembly towards\nambient conditions.\n", "  Polymer-based nanocomposite dielectrics are expected to become essential in\nfuture generations of high voltage electrical insulation. However, the physics\nbehind their performance is not yet understood. Here we investigate electronic\nproperties of the interfacial area in magnesium oxide-polyethylene\nnanocomposite. We use density functional theory to calculate densities of\nstates for MgO (100) and hydroxylated MgO (111) interfaces with polyethylene.\nWe evaluate the role of silicon-based nanoparticle surface modification at the\nelectronic level and propose a new theory for charge trapping in\nnanocomposites.\n", "  We theoretically consider the temporal dynamics of two coupled spin qubits\n(e.g., semiconductor quantum dots) driven by the inter-qubit spin-spin\ncoupling. The presence of environmental noise (e.g., charge traps, nuclear\nspins, random magnetic impurities) is accounted for by including random\nmagnetic field and random inter-qubit coupling terms in the Hamiltonian. Both\nHeisenberg coupling and Ising coupling between the spin qubits are considered,\ncorresponding respectively to exchange and capacitive gates as appropriate for\nsingle spin and singlet-triplet semiconductor qubit systems, respectively. Both\nexchange (Heisenberg) and capacitive (Ising) coupling situations can be solved\nnumerically exactly even in the presence of noise, leading to the key findings\nthat (i) the steady-state return probability to the initial state remains close\nto unity in the presence of strong noise for many, but not all, starting spin\nconfigurations, and (ii) the return probability as a function of time is\noscillatory with a characteristic noise-controlled decay toward the\nsteady-state value. We also provide results for the magnetization dynamics of\nthe coupled two-qubit system. Our predicted dynamics can be directly tested in\nthe already existing semiconductor spin qubit setups providing insight into\ntheir coherent interaction dynamics. Retention of the initial state spin memory\neven in the presence of strong environmental noise has important implications\nfor quantum computation using spin qubits.\n", "  The adsorption of single colloidal microparticles (0.5--1 $\\mu$m radius) at a\nwater-oil interface has been recently studied experimentally using digital\nholographic microscopy [Kaz \\textit{et al., Nat. Mater.}, 2012, \\textbf{11},\n138--142]. An initially fast adsorption dynamics driven by capillary forces is\nfollowed by an unexpectedly slow relaxation to equilibrium that is logarithmic\nin time and can span hours or days. The slow relaxation kinetics has been\nattributed to the presence of surface \"defects\" with nanoscale dimensions\n(1--5\\,nm) that induce multiple metastable configurations of the contact line\nperimeter. A kinetic model considering thermally activated transitions between\nsuch metastable configurations has been proposed [Colosqui \\textit{et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett.}, 2013, \\textbf{111}, 028302] to predict both the relaxation\nrate and the crossover point to the slow logarithmic regime. However, the\nadsorption dynamics observed experimentally before the crossover point has\nremained unstudied. In this work, we propose a Langevin model that is able to\ndescribe the entire adsorption process of single colloidal particles by\nconsidering metastable states produced by surface defects and thermal motion of\nthe particle and liquid interface. Invoking the fluctuation dissipation\ntheorem, we introduce a drag term that considers significant dissipative forces\ninduced by thermal fluctuations of the liquid interface. Langevin dynamics\nsimulations based on the proposed adsorption model yield close agreement with\nexperimental observations for different microparticles, capturing the crossover\nfrom (fast) capillary driven dynamics to (slow) thermally activated kinetics.\n", "  It has been shown recently that spectral flow admits a natural integer-valued\nextension to essential spectrum. This extension admits four different\ninterpretations; two of them are singular spectral shift function and total\nresonance index. In this work we study resonance index outside essential\nspectrum.\n  Among results of this paper are the following.\n  1. Total resonance index satisfies Robbin-Salamon axioms for spectral flow.\n  2. Direct proof of equality \"total resonance index = intersection number\".\n  3. Direct proof of equality \"total resonance index = total Fredholm index\".\n  4. (a) Criteria for a perturbation~$V$ to be tangent to the~resonance set at\na point~$H,$ where the resonance set is the infinite-dimensional variety of\nself-adjoint perturbations of the initial self-adjoint operator~$H_0$ which\nhave~$\\lambda$ as an eigenvalue. (b) Criteria for the order of tangency of a\nperturbation~$V$ to the resonance set.\n  5. Investigation of the root space of the compact operator\n$(H_0+sV-\\lambda)^{-1}V$ corresponding to an eigenvalue $(s-r_\\lambda)^{-1},$\nwhere $H_0+r_\\lambda V$ is a point of the resonance set.\n  This analysis gives a finer information about behaviour of discrete spectrum\ncompared to spectral flow.\n  Finally, many results of this paper are non-trivial even in finite\ndimensions, in which case they can be and were tested in numerical experiments.\n", "  The misanthrope process is a class of stochastic interacting particle\nsystems, generalizing the simple exclusion process. It allows each site of the\nlattice to accommodate more than one particle. We consider a special case of\nthe one dimensional misanthrope process whose probability distribution is\ncompletely equivalent to the ordinary simple exclusion process under the\nperiodic boundary condition. By imposing open boundaries, high- and low-density\ndomains can coexist in the system, which we investigate by Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We examine finite-size corrections of density profiles and\ncorrelation functions, when the jump rule for particles is symmetric. Moreover,\nwe study properties of delocalized and localized shocks in the case of the\ntotally asymmetric jump rule. The localized shock slowly moves to its stable\nposition in the bulk.\n", "  A different paradigm is proposed to selectively manipulate and transport\nsmall engineered chiral particles and discriminate different enantiomers using\nunstructured chiral light. It is theoretically shown that the response of a\nchiral metamaterial particle may be tailored to enable an optical conveyor belt\noperation with no optical traps, such that for a fixed incident light helicity\nthe nanoparticle is either steadily pushed towards the direction of the photon\nflow or steadily pulled against the photon flow, independent of its position.\nOur findings create distinct opportunities for unconventional optical\nmanipulations of tailored nanoparticles and may have applications in sorting\nracemic mixtures of artificial chiral molecules and in particle delivery.\n", "  We analyse van der Waals interactions between a pair of dielectrically\nanisotropic plane-layered media interacting across a dielectrically isotropic\nsolvent medium. We develop a general formalism based on transfer matrices to\ninvestigate the van der Waals torque and force in the limit of weak\nbirefringence and dielectric matching between the ordinary axes of the\nanisotropic layers and the solvent. We apply this formalism to study the\nfollowing systems: (i) a pair of single anisotropic layers, (ii) a single\nanisotropic layer interacting with a multilayered slab consisting of\nalternating anisotropic and isotropic layers, and (iii) a pair of multilayered\nslabs each consisting of alternating anisotropic and isotropic layers, looking\nat the cases where the optic axes lie parallel and/or perpendicular to the\nplane of the layers. For the first case, the optic axes of the oppositely\nfacing anisotropic layers of the two interacting slabs generally possess an\nangular mismatch, and within each multilayered slab the optic axes may either\nbe the same, or undergo constant angular increments across the anisotropic\nlayers. In particular, we examine how the behaviors of the van der Waals torque\nand force can be \"tuned\" by adjusting the layer thicknesses, the relative\nangular increment within each slab, and the angular mismatch between the slabs.\n", "  We design and implement 3D lumped element microwave cavities for the coherent\nand uniform coupling to electron spins hosted by nitrogen vacancy centers in\ndiamond. Our design spatially focuses the magnetic field to a small mode\nvolume. We achieve large homogeneous single spin coupling rates, with an\nenhancement of the single spin Rabi frequency of more than one order of\nmagnitude compared to standard 3D cavities with a fundamental resonance at\n\\SI{3}{GHz}. Finite element simulations confirm that the magnetic field\ncomponent is homogeneous throughout the entire sample volume, with a RMS\ndeviation of 1.54\\%. With a sample containing $10^{17}$ nitrogen vacancy\nelectron spins we achieve a collective coupling strength of\n$\\Omega=\\SI{12}{MHz}$, a cooperativity factor $C=27$ and clearly enter the\nstrong coupling regime. This allows to interface a macroscopic spin ensemble\nwith microwave circuits, and the homogeneous Rabi frequency paves the way to\nmanipulate the full ensemble population in a coherent way.\n", "  In this work we focus on the quantum Einstein-Yang-Mills sector quantised by\nthe methods of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We point out the improved UV\nbehaviour of the coupled system as compared to pure quantum Yang-Mills theory\non a fixed, classical background spacetime as was considered in a seminal work\nby Kogut and Susskind. Furthermore, we develop a calculational scheme by which\nthe fundamental spectrum of the quantum Yang-Mills Hamiltonian can be computed\nin principle and by which one can make contact to the Wilsonian renormalization\ngroup, possibly purely within the Hamiltonian framework. Finally, we comment on\nthe relation of the fundamental spectrum to that of pure Yang-Mills theory on a\n(flat) classical spacetime.\n", "  Planck-scale dynamical dimensional reduction is attracting more and more\ninterest in the quantum-gravity literature since it seems to be a model\nindependent effect. However different studies base their results on different\nconcepts of spacetime dimensionality. Most of them rely on the\n\\textit{spectral} dimension, others refer to the \\textit{Hausdorff} dimension\nand, very recently, it has been introduced also the \\textit{thermal} dimension.\nWe here show that all these distinct definitions of dimension give the same\noutcome in the case of the effective regime of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). This\nis achieved by deriving a modified dispersion relation from the\nhypersurface-deformation algebra with quantum corrections. Moreover we also\nobserve that the number of UV dimensions can be used to constrain the\nambiguities in the choice of these LQG-based modifications of the Dirac\nspacetime algebra. In this regard, introducing the \\textit{polymerization} of\nconnections i.e. $K \\rightarrow \\frac{\\sin(\\delta K)}{\\delta}$, we find that\nthe leading quantum correction gives $d_{UV} = 2.5$. This result may indicate\nthat the running to the expected value of two dimensions is ongoing, but it has\nnot been completed yet. Finding $d_{UV}$ at ultra-short distances would require\nto go beyond the effective approach we here present.\n", "  Collapsing magnetic traps (CMTs) are one proposed mechanism for generating\nnon-thermal particle populations in solar flares. CMTs occur if an initially\nstretched magnetic field structure relaxes rapidly into a lower-energy\nconfiguration, which is believed to happen as a by-product of magnetic\nreconnection. A similar mechanism for energising particles has also been found\nto operate in the Earth's magnetotail. One particular feature proposed to be of\nimportance for particle acceleration in the magnetotail is that of a braking\nplasma jet, i.e. a localised region of strong flow encountering stronger\nmagnetic field which causes the jet to slow down and stop. Such a feature has\nnot been included in previously proposed analytical models of CMTs for solar\nflares. In this work we incorporate a braking plasma jet into a well studied\nCMT model for the first time. We present results of test particle calculations\nin this new CMT model. We observe and characterise new types of particle\nbehaviour caused by the magnetic structure of the jet braking region, which\nallows electrons to be trapped both in the braking jet region and the loop\nlegs. We compare and contrast the behaviour of particle orbits for various\nparameter regimes of the underlying trap by examining particle trajectories,\nenergy gains and the frequency with which different types of particle orbit are\nfound for each parameter regime.\n", "  The solar northern and southern hemispheres exhibit differences between the\nintensities and time profiles of the activity cycles. The time variation of\nthese properties has been studied in a previous article on the data of Cycles\n12-23. The hemispheric phase lags exhibited a characteristic variation: the\nleading role has been exchanged between the hemispheres by four cycles. The\npresent work extends the investigation of this variation with the data of\nSchwabe and Staudacher in Cycles 1-4 and 7-10 as well as Sp\\\"orer's data in\ncycle 11. The previously found variation can not be clearly recognized using\nthe data of Staudacher, Schwabe and Sp\\\"orer. However, it is more interesting\nthat the phase lags of the reversals of the magnetic fields at the poles follow\nthe same variation as that of the hemispheric cycles in Cycles 12-23, i.e. in\nfour cyles one of the hemispheres leads and the leading role jumps to the\nopposite hemisphere in the next four cycles. This means that this variation is\na long term property of the entire solar dynamo mechanism, both the toroidal\nand poloidal fields, that hints at an unidentified component of the process\nresponsible for the long term memory.\n", "  According to hierarchical structure formation models, merging galaxies are\nexpected to be seen in different stages of their coalescence. However,\ncurrently there are no straightforward observational methods neither to select\nnor to confirm a large number of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates.\nMost attempts involve the better understanding of double-peaked narrow emission\nline sources, to distinguish the objects where the emission lines originate\nfrom narrow-line kinematics or jet-driven outflows from those which might\nharbour dual AGN. We observed four such candidate sources with the Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) at 1.5 GHz with $\\sim$ 10 milli-arcsecond angular\nresolution where spectral profiles of AGN optical emission suggested the\nexistence of dual AGN. In SDSS J210449.13-000919.1 and SDSS J23044.82-093345.3,\nthe radio structures are aligned with the optical emission features, thus the\ndouble-peaked emission lines might be the results of jet-driven outflows. In\nthe third detected source SDSS J115523.74+150756.9, the radio structure is less\nextended and oriented nearly perpendicular to the position angle derived from\noptical spectroscopy. The fourth source remained undetected with the VLBA but\nit has been imaged with the Very Large Array at arcsec resolution a few months\nbefore our observations, suggesting the existence of extended radio structure.\nIn none of the four sources did we detect two radio-emitting cores, a\nconvincing signature of duality.\n", "  Three dimensional waveguides within the bulk of diamond are manufactured\nusing ultrafast laser fabrication. High intensities within the focal volume of\nthe laser cause breakdown of the diamond into a graphitic phase leading to a\nstress induced refractive index change in neighboring regions. Type II\nwaveguiding is thus enabled between two adjacent graphitic tracks, but\nsupporting just a single polarization state. We show that adaptive aberration\ncorrection during the laser processing allows the controlled fabrication of\nmore complex structures beneath the surface of the diamond which can be used\nfor 3D waveguide splitters and Type III waveguides which support both\npolarizations.\n", "  In this paper, we study thermostatistical properties of a photon gas in the\nframework of two deformed special relativity models defined by the cosmological\ncoordinatizations of the de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) momentum\nspaces. The dS model is a doubly special relativity theory in which an\nultraviolet length scale is invariant under the deformed Lorentz\ntransformations. For the case of AdS model, however, the Lorentz symmetry\nbreaks at the high energy regime. We show that the existence of a maximal\nmomentum in dS momentum space leads to maximal pressure and temperature at the\nthermodynamical level while maximal internal energy and entropy arise for the\ncase of the AdS momentum space due to the existence of a maximal kinematical\nenergy. These results show the thermodynamical duality of these models much\nsimilar to their well-known kinematical duality.\n", "  Recently, a family of hairy black holes in 4-dimensional Einstein gravity\nminimally coupled to a complex, massive scalar field was discovered~\\cite{hbh}.\nBesides the mass $M$ and spin angular momentum $J$, these objects are\ncharacterized by a Noether charge $Q$, measuring the amount of scalar hair,\nwhich is not associated to a Gauss law and cannot be measured at spatial\ninfinity. Introducing a dimensionless scalar hair parameter $q$, ranging from 0\nto 1, we recover (a subset of) Kerr black holes for $q=0$ and a family of\nrotating boson stars for $q=1$. In the present paper, we explore the\npossibility of measuring $q$ for astrophysical black holes with current and\nfuture X-ray missions. We study the iron K$\\alpha$ line expected in the\nreflection spectrum of such hairy black holes and we simulate observations with\nSuzaku and eXTP. As a proof of concept, we point out, by analyzing a sample of\nhairy black holes, that current observations can already constrain the scalar\nhair parameter $q$, because black holes with $q$ close to 1 would have iron\nlines definitively different from those we observe in the available data. We\nconclude that a detailed scanning of the full space of solutions, together with\ndata from the future X-ray missions, like eXTP, will be able to put relevant\nconstraints on the astrophysical realization of Kerr black holes with scalar\nhair.\n", "  We study the decoupling process of neutrinos in the early universe in the\npresence of three-flavour oscillations. The evolution of the neutrino spectra\nis found by solving the corresponding momentum-dependent kinetic equations for\nthe neutrino density matrix, including for the first time the proper collision\nintegrals for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements. This improved\ncalculation modifies the evolution of the off-diagonal elements of the neutrino\ndensity matrix and changes the deviation from equilibrium of the frozen\nneutrino spectra. However, it does not vary the contribution of neutrinos to\nthe cosmological energy density in the form of radiation, usually expressed in\nterms of the effective number of neutrinos, N_eff. We find a value of\nN_eff=3.045, in agreement with previous theoretical calculations and consistent\nwith the latest analysis of Planck data. This result does not depend on the\nordering of neutrino masses. We also consider the effect of non-standard\nneutrino-electron interactions (NSI), predicted in many theoretical models\nwhere neutrinos acquire mass. For two sets of NSI parameters allowed by present\ndata, we find that N_eff can be reduced down to 3.040 or enhanced up to 3.059.\n", "  Using the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg effective potential, we derive a general\nanalytic expression for all the derivatives of the effective potential with\nrespect to any number of classical scalar fields. The result is valid for a\nrenormalisable theory in four dimensions with any number of scalars, fermions\nor gauge bosons. This result corresponds to the zero-external momentum\ncontribution to a general one-loop diagram with N scalar external legs. We\nillustrate the use of the general result in two simple scalar singlet\nextensions of the Standard Model, to obtain the dominant contributions to the\ntriple couplings of light scalar particles under the zero external momentum\napproximation\n", "  The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the most massive satellites of the\nMilky Way, claimed to be embedded in a huge dark matter halo, and the only\namong the Milky Way satellites hosting five globular clusters. Interestingly,\ntheir estimated masses, ages and positions seem hardly compatible with the\npresence of a significant dark matter component, as expected in the $\\Lambda$\nCDM scheme. Indeed, if Fornax would have a CDM halo with a standard density\nprofile, all its globular clusters should have sunk to the galactic centre many\nGyr ago due to dynamical friction. Due to this, some authors proposed that the\nmost massive clusters may have formed out of Fornax and later tidally captured.\nIn this paper we investigate the past evolution of the Fornax GC system by\nusing both a recently developed, semi-analytical treatment of dynamical\nfriction and direct $N$-body simulations of the orbital evolution of the\nglobular clusters within Fornax and of Fornax galaxy around the Milky Way. Our\nresults suggest that an \"in-situ\" origin for all the clusters is likely if\ntheir observed positions are close to their spatial ones and their orbits are\nalmost circular. Moreover, the Milky Way seems to accelerate the GC decay\nreducing the decay time of $15\\%$. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the\nGCs survival probability exceeds $50\\%$, even in the case of cuspy density\nprofiles. We conclude that more detailed data are required to shed light on the\nFornax dark matter content, to distinguish between a cuspy or a cored profile.\n", "  Recently, Strickland et al retrieved dynamic polarizabilities of infinitely\nlong wires at oblique incidence, reporting non-zero magnetoelectric coupling,\nseemingly defying existing theorems which forbid this in centrosymmetric\nscatterers. We reconcile this finding with existing symmetry restrictions on\nmicroscopic polarizabilities using a property of line dipoles. This motivates a\nreformulation of cylinder polarizability, yielding diagonal tensors that\ndecompose the response into TM and TE contributions, simplifying subsequent\ntreatment by homogenization theories. A transformation is derived between\nStrickland et al.'s formulation and our reformulation, allowing magnetoelectric\ncoupling to be identified as the contrast between TM and TE responses, and\nenabling simple geometric insights into all its scaling and symmetry\nproperties.\n", "  Students often have difficulty in understanding qualitatively the behaviour\nof simple electric circuits. In particular, as different studies have shown,\nthey find multiple batteries connected in multiple loops difficult to analyse.\nIn a recent paper [Phys. Educ. 50 568 (2015)], we showed such an electric\ncircuit, which consists of ideal batteries connected in parallel, that couldn't\nbe solved by the existing circuit analysis methods. In this paper, we shall\nintroduce a new mathematical method of solving simple electric circuits from\nthe solutions of more general circuits and show that the currents, in this\nparticular circuit, take the indeterminate 0/0 form. We shall also present some\nof the implications of teaching the method. We believe that the description\npresented in this paper should help the instructors in teaching the behaviour\nof multiple batteries connected in parallel.\n", "  The survival of asteroid Vesta during the violent early history of the Solar\nSystem is a pivotal constraint on theories of planetary formation. Particularly\nimportant from this perspective is the amount of olivine excavated from the\nvestan mantle by impacts, as this constrains both the interior structure of\nVesta and the number of major impacts the asteroid suffered during its life.\nThe NASA Dawn mission revealed that olivine is present on Vesta's surface in\nlimited quantities, concentrated in small patches at a handful of sites and\ninterpreted as the result of the excavation of endogenous olivine. Later works\nraised the possibility that the olivine had an exogenous origin, based on the\ngeologic and spectral features of the deposits. In this work we quantitatively\nexplore the proposed scenario of a exogenous origin for the detected olivine to\ninvestigate whether its presence on Vesta can be explained as a natural outcome\nof the collisional history of the asteroid. We took advantage of the impact\ncontamination model previously developed to study the origin and amount of dark\nand hydrated materials observed by Dawn on Vesta, which we updated by\nperforming dedicated hydrocode impact simulations. We show that the exogenous\ndelivery of olivine by impacts can offer a viable explanation for the currently\nidentified olivine-rich sites without violating the constraint posed by the\nlack of global olivine signatures on Vesta. Our results indicate that no mantle\nexcavation is in principle required to explain the observations of the Dawn\nmission and support the idea that the vestan crust could be thicker than\nindicated by simple geochemical models based on the Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite\nfamily of meteorites.\n", "  It is now well known that the moduli space of a vector bundle for heterotic\nstring compactifications to four dimensions is parameterized by a set of\nsections of a weighted projective space bundle of a particular kind, known as\nLooijenga's weighted projective space bundle. We show that the requisite\nweighted projective spaces and the Weierstrass equations describing the\nspectral covers for gauge groups E_N (N=4,...,8) and SU(n+1) (n=1,2,3) can be\nobtained systematically by a series of blowing-up procedures according to\nTate's algorithm, thereby the sections of correct line bundles claimed to arise\nby Looijenga's theorem can be automatically obtained. They are nothing but the\nfour-dimensional analogue of the set of independent polynomials in the\nsix-dimensional F-theory parameterizing the complex structure, which is further\nconfirmed in the constructions of D_4, A_5, D_6, E_3 and SU(2) x SU(2) bundles.\nWe also explain why we can obtain them in this way by using the structure\ntheorem of the Mordell-Weil lattice, which is also useful for understanding the\nrelation between the singularity and the occurrence of chiral matter in\nF-theory.\n", "  In the context of GR, we study the thermodynamic stability of evolving\nLorentzian wormholes at the apparent horizon. The average pressure of the\nanisotrropic components is considered as the pressure of the wormhole.\nAccording to the requirements of stable equilibrium in conventional\nthermodynamics, we calculate the heat capacity at constant pressure and Gibbs\nfree energy and analyze the local and global thermodynamic stability of the\nwormhole.\n", "  Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been shown to act as an ideal\nsubstrate to graphene by greatly improving the material transport properties\nthanks to its atomically flat surface, low interlayer electronic coupling and\nalmost perfect reticular matching. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is\npresently considered the most scalable approach to grow graphene directly on\nh-BN. However, for the catalyst-free approach, poor control over the shape and\ncrystallinity of the graphene grains and low growth rates are typically\nreported. In this work we investigate the crystallinity of differently shaped\ngrains and identify a path towards a real van der Waals epitaxy of graphene on\nh-BN by adopting a catalyst-free CVD process. We demonstrate the\npolycrystalline nature of circular-shaped pads and attribute the stemming of\ndifferent oriented grains to airborne contamination of the h-BN flakes. We show\nthat single-crystal grains with six-fold symmetry can be obtained by adopting\nhigh hydrogen partial pressures during growth. Notably, growth rates as high as\n100 nm/min are obtained by optimizing growth temperature and pressure. The\npossibility of synthesizing single-crystal graphene on h-BN with appreciable\ngrowth rates by adopting a simple CVD approach is a step towards an increased\naccessibility of this promising van der Waals heterostructure.\n", "  In the paper [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4237-4244 (2015)], Qin and Dai\nproposed a proactive quantum secret sharing scheme. We study the security of\nthe proposed scheme and find that it is not secure. In the distribution phase\nof the proposed scheme, two dishonest participants may collaborate to eavesdrop\nthe secret of the dealer without introducing any error. Incidentally, a\npossible improvement of the distribution phase is given.\n", "  As an alternative to conventional multi-pixel cameras, single-pixel cameras\nenable images to be recorded using a single detector that measures the\ncorrelations between the scene and a set of patterns. However, to fully sample\na scene in this way requires at least the same number of correlation\nmeasurements as there are pixels in the reconstructed image. Therefore\nsingle-pixel imaging systems typically exhibit low frame-rates. To mitigate\nthis, a range of compressive sensing techniques have been developed which rely\non a priori knowledge of the scene to reconstruct images from an under-sampled\nset of measurements. In this work we take a different approach and adopt a\nstrategy inspired by the foveated vision systems found in the animal kingdom -\na framework that exploits the spatio-temporal redundancy present in many\ndynamic scenes. In our single-pixel imaging system a high-resolution foveal\nregion follows motion within the scene, but unlike a simple zoom, every frame\ndelivers new spatial information from across the entire field-of-view. Using\nthis approach we demonstrate a four-fold reduction in the time taken to record\nthe detail of rapidly evolving features, whilst simultaneously accumulating\ndetail of more slowly evolving regions over several consecutive frames. This\ntiered super-sampling technique enables the reconstruction of video streams in\nwhich both the resolution and the effective exposure-time spatially vary and\nadapt dynamically in response to the evolution of the scene. The methods\ndescribed here can complement existing compressive sensing approaches and may\nbe applied to enhance a variety of computational imagers that rely on\nsequential correlation measurements.\n", "  We place limits on spherical coefficients for Lorentz violation involving\noperators of dimension four in the photon sector of the minimal Standard-Model\nExtension. The bounds are deduced from existing experimental results with\noptical-cavity oscillators.\n", "  This paper mainly addresses the strong unique continuation property for the\nelectromagnetic Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator with complex-valued coefficients.\nAppropriate multipliers with physical backgrounds have been introduced to prove\na priori estimates. Moreover, its application in an exact controllability\nproblem has been shown, in which case, the boundary value determines the\ninterior value completely.\n", "  This paper considers the general signal detection and parameter estimation\nproblem in the presence of colored Gaussian noise disturbance. By modeling the\ndisturbance with an autoregressive process, we present three signal detectors\nwith different unknown parameters under the general framework of binary\nhypothesis testing. The closed form of parameter estimates and the asymptotic\ndistributions of these three tests are also given. Given two examples of\nfrequency modulated signal detection problem and time series moving object\ndetection problem, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthree presented detectors.\n", "  There is considerable interest in understanding and controlling topological\ndefects in nematic liquid crystals (LCs). Confinement, in the form of droplets,\nhas been particularly effective in that regard. Here, we employ the Landau-de\nGennes method to explore the geometrical frustration of nematic order in shell\ngeometries, and focus on chiral materials. By varying the chirality and\nthickness in uniform shells, we construct a phase diagram that includes\ntetravalent structures, bipolar structures (BS), bent structures and radial\nspherical structures (RSS). It is found that, in uniform shells, the BS-to-RSS\nstructural transition, in response to both chirality and shell geometry, is\naccompanied by an abrupt change of defect positions, implying a potential use\nfor chiral nematic shells as sensors. Moreover, we investigate thickness\nheterogeneity in shells and demonstrate that non-chiral and chiral nematic\nshells exhibit distinct equilibrium positions of their inner core that are\ngoverned by shell chirality c.\n", "  A Predictor-Corrector strategy is employed for the numerical simulation of\nthe one-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model of earthquakes. This approach is\ntotally explicit and allows to reproduce the main features of the model. The\nresults achieved are compared with those of several previous works available in\nthe literature, in order to state the effectiveness of the novel numerical\nstrategy. Simulations are performed starting from the simplest cases and are\naimed at studying the qualitative trends of the phenomena under analysis. By\nincreasing the size of the associated differential system, it is possible to\nexamine data on the basis of the Gutenberg-Richter statistical law. Finally,\nsome tests are conducted to investigate the continuum limit of the discrete\nBurridge-Knopoff model towards a macroscopic dynamics.\n", "  In gas dynamics, the connection between the continuum physics model offered\nby the Navier-Stokes equations and the heat equation and the molecular model\noffered by the kinetic theory of gases has been understood for some time,\nespecially through the work of Chapman and Enskog, but it has never been\nestablished rigorously. This paper established a precise bridge between this\ntwo models for a simple linear Boltzman-like equation. Specifically a special\nclass of solutions, the grossly determined solutions, of this kinetic model are\nshown to exist and satisfy closed form balance equations representing a class\nof continuum model solutions.\n", "  Recently, two-dimensional boron sheets have attracted a lot of attentions\nowing to their structural polymorphs and outstanding properties. And, due to\nchemical complexity and electron deficiency of B atoms, the 2D boron sheets are\neasy affected by the environment. So, exploring novel 2D boron oxides gets\nhighly needed. In this study, we theoretically explored 2D boron oxides\nstructures and their basic properties. We found 2D boron oxides are metals or\nsemimetals, when oxygen concentration is low. More interesting, the B6O1\nexhibits Dirac Loop near the Fermi level and the maximum Fermi velocity is\nestimated as high as 0.61*10E6 m/s, which much close to that in graphene. In\naddition, when the oxygen concentration is one forth, the most stable B4O1 get\na semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.24 eV and a strong anisotropic\ncarrier mobility. Such huge differences of carrier mobility between two\ndirections have not been reported in other 2D materials. Besides, when oxygen\nconcentra-tion is higher than one forth, the 2D boron sheets will get unstable\nbased our results. We also proposed a method how to synthesize these systems.\nOur work provide a basic knowledge of 2D boron oxides and may lead to novel 2D\nboron oxides discovered. The unique electronic properties of the B6O1 and B4O1\nrender them promising 2D materials for applications in high-performance\nnanodevices.\n", "  This work mainly presents a preliminary design for a pendulum experiment with\nboth the source mass and the test mass in a striped pattern to amplify the\nLorentz-violation signal, since the signal is sensitive to edge effects.\n", "  Anderson localization has been observed in various types of waves, such as\nmatter waves, optical waves and acoustic waves. Here we reveal that the effect\nof Anderson localization can be also induced in metallic nonlinear nanoparticle\narrays excited by a random electrically driving field. We find that the\ndipole-induced nonlinearity results in ballistic expansion of dipole intensity\nduring evolution; while the randomness of the external driving field can\nsuppress such an expansion. Increasing the strength of randomness above the\nthreshold value, a localized pattern of dipole intensity can be generated in\nthe metallic nanoparticle arrays. By means of statistics, the mean intensity\ndistribution of the dipoles reveals the formation of Anderson localization. We\nfurther show that the generated Anderson localization is highly confined, with\nits size down to the scale of incident wavelength. The reported results might\nfacilitate the manipulations of electromagnetic fields in the scale of\nwavelength.\n", "  The rotation of sunspots of 2 yr in two different solar cycles is studied\nwith the data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the \\it Solar\nDynamics Observatory \\rm and the Michelson Doppler Imager instrument on board\nthe \\it Solar and Heliospheric Observataory.\\rm We choose the $\\alpha$ sunspot\ngroups and the relatively large and stable sunspots of complex active regions\nin our sample. In the year of 2003, the $\\alpha$ sunspot groups and the\npreceding sunspots tend to rotate counterclockwise and have positive magnetic\npolarity in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, the magnetic\npolarity and rotational tendency of the $\\alpha$ sunspot groups and the\npreceding sunspots are opposite to the northern hemisphere. The average\nrotational speed of these sunspots in 2003 is about $0^{\\circ}.65 \\rm \\\nhr^{-1}$. From 2014 January to 2015 February, the $\\alpha$ sunspot groups and\nthe preceding sunspots tend to rotate clockwise and have negative magnetic\npolarity in the northern hemisphere. The patterns of rotation and magnetic\npolarity of the southern hemisphere are also opposite to those of the northern\nhemisphere. The average rotational speed of these sunspots in 2014/2015 is\nabout $1^{\\circ}.49 \\rm \\ hr^{-1}$. The rotation of the relatively large and\nstable preceding sunspots and that of the $\\alpha$ sunspot groups located in\nthe same hemisphere have opposite rotational direction in 2003 and 2014/2015.\n", "  Recently Dai and Pennington have performed a comprehensive analysis of\nessentially all pion and kaon pair production data from two-photon collisions\nbelow 1.5 GeV, including all high statistics results from Belle, as well as the\nolder data from Mark II at SLAC, CELLO at DESY, and Crystal Ball at SLAC.\nImposing the basic constraints required by analyticity, unitarity, and crossing\nsymmetry and making use of Low's low energy theorem for QED, they are able to\nextract the final-state strong-interaction scattering amplitudes for the\nintermediate pi pi->pi pi and pi pi-> K\\bar K reactions in a model-independent\nfashion. In addition, they provide good fits to the respective gamma gamma-> pi\npi cross-sections that are known in the low-energy sector in the restricted\nangular range, | cos theta|< 0.6-0.8. Using the parameters obtained in this\nfashion, these authors contruct the \\gamma\\gamma->pi pi cross-sections\nintegrated over the full angular range. In this work, we use a version of\nchiral perturbation theory developed by Oller and Oset to evaluate the\nfinal-state strong-interaction amplitudes directly theoretically and we compare\nour thus obtained low-energy QCD-based results directly with the amplitudes\nextracted by Dai and Pennington. We also calculate the gamma gamma -> pi pi\ncross-sections (integrated over the full angular range) and compare these with\nthose obtained by Dai and Pennington. This calculation thus gives a more\ndetailed insight into the fit of chiral perturbation theory, not just to the\nmeasured gamma gamma-> pi pi cross-sections, as is usually presented, but\nrather to a higher level of detail through the available analysis of the\nexperimental data for the underlying final-state strong-interaction meson-meson\nscattering amplitudes pi pi-> pi pi and pi pi-> K\\bar K themselves. The fits\nappear to be reasonable over the energy range considered.\n", "  In this paper we develop a dual-support smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(DS-SPH) that naturally satisfies the conservation of momentum, angular\nmomentum and energy when the varying smoothing length is utilized. The DS-SPH\nis based on the concept of dual-support, which is introduced to consider the\nunbalanced interactions between the particles with different smoothing lengths.\nOur DS-SPH formulation can be implemented in traditional SPH with little\nchanges and improve the computational efficiency. Several numerical examples\nare presented to demonstrate the capability of the method.\n", "  Segmented primary mirrors are indispensable to master the steady increase in\nspatial resolution. Phasing optics systems must reduce segment misalignments to\nguarantee the high optical quality required for astronomical science programs.\nModern telescopes routinely use adaptive optics systems to compensate for the\natmosphere and use laser-guide-stars to create artificial stars as bright\nreferences in the field of observation. Because multiple laser-guide-star\nadaptive optics are being implemented in all major observatories, we propose to\nuse man-made stars not only for adaptive optics, but for phasing optics. We\npropose a method called the doublet-wavelength coherence technique (DWCT),\nexploiting the D lines of sodium in the mesosphere using laser guide-stars. The\nsignal coherence properties are then used. The DWCT capture range exceeds\ncurrent abilities by a factor of 100. It represents a change in paradigm by\nimproving the phasing optics capture range from micrometric to millimetric. It\nthereby potentially eliminates the need of a man-made mechanical pre-phasing\nstep. Extremely large telescopes require hundreds of segments, several of which\nneed to be substituted on a daily basis to be recoated. The DWCT relaxes\nmechanical integration requirements and speeds up integration and\nre-integration process.\n", "  Two measurements of $A$ and $B$ are carried out one after the other. The\nmeasurements of $A$ are controlled by the parameter $\\lambda_A$ in the Kraus\noperator, where the measurements of $B$ are controlled by the parameter\n$\\lambda_B$. Strong measurements imply that the parameters in the Kraus\noperators approach infinite large values while weak measurements are carried\nout when the parameters approach zero. Here we prove that by repeating on the\ntwo successive measurements of $A$ and $B$ then: (1) Average over all\nmeasurements of $A$ is invariant of the measurement strength parameters\n$\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_B$. It implies that all surprising results obtained in\nweak measurements of $A$ are washed out when the average is taken. (2) If the\noperators $\\hat A$ and $\\hat B$ commute then the mean value of $B$ as obtained\nby taking the average of the results for $B$ over all measurements is invariant\nof $\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_B$. Moreover it is exactly equal to the expectation\nvalue of $\\hat B$ as expected for strong measurements of $B$. (3) If $\\hat A$\nand $\\hat B$ do not commute \\textit{and} another condition given in this paper\nis satisfied then the mean value of the results obtained for $B$ depends on the\nvalue of $\\lambda_A$ and not on the value of $\\lambda_B$. An illustrative\npossible experiment to show the effect of the strength of the measurements of A\non the results obtained for the measurements of B is given.\n", "  In this paper, we study shearing spherically symmetric homogeneous density\nfluids in comoving coordinates. It is found that the expansion of the\nfour-velocity of a perfect fluid is homogeneous, whereas its shear is generated\nby an arbitrary function of time M(t), related to the mass function of the\ndistribution. This function is found to bear a functional relationship with\ndensity. The field equations are reduced to two coupled first order ordinary\ndifferential equations for the metric coefficients, g 11 and g 22. We have\nexplored a class of solutions assuming that M is a linear function of the\ndensity. This class embodies, as a subcase, the complete class of shear-free\nsolutions. We have discussed the off quoted work of Kustaanheimo (1947) and\nhave noted that it deals with shear-free fluids having anisotropic pressure. It\nis shown that the anisotropy of the fluid is characterized by an arbitrary\nfunction of time. We have discussed some issues of historical priorities and\ncredentials related to shear-free solutions. Recent controversial claims by\nMitra (2011, 2012) have also been addressed. We found that the singularity and\nthe shearing motion of the fluid are closely related. Hence, there is a need\nfor fresh look to the solutions obtained earlier in comoving coordinates.\nKeywords (separated by '-') Shearing solution - Perfect fluids - Homogeneous\ndensity\n", "  We know that our Galaxy is permeated by tenuous, hot, metal-rich gas. However\nmuch remains unknown about its origin, the portion of the Galaxy that it\npermeates, its total mass, as any role it may play in regulating activity in\nthe Galaxy. In a Letter currently in the press with the ApJ, we show that this\nhot gas permeates both the disk of the Galaxy and a large spherical volume,\ncentered on the Galactic nucleus, and extending out to distances of at least\n60-200 kpc from the center. This gas displays a peculiar density distribution\nthat peaks about 6 kpc from the Galaxy's center, likely witnessing a period of\nstrong activity of the central super-massive black hole of the Milky Way that\noccurred 6 Myrs ago. With our study we are also able to update the total\nbaryonic mass of the Galaxy to Mb = (0.8-4)x1e11 Solar Masses, sufficient to\nclose the Galaxy's baryon census.\n", "  Theory results on precision measurements in electron-positron annihilation at\nlow and high energies are collected. These cover pure QCD calculations as well\nas mixed electroweak and QCD results, involving light and heavy quarks.

By monitoring the patio-temporal\ndistribution of the strain in response to the local stress, we demonstrate that\nthe postcursors, high angle grain boundaries and triple junctions act as\nfavorable heterogeneous nucleation sites corresponding to different loading and\ncooling conditions, and predict the phase diagram of the nucleation mode of\nmartensite.\n", "  We very briefly discuss proposed in the literature possible scenarios for\nintermediate mass black holes (IMBH) formation in globular clusters. We also\ndiscuss the results of the MOCCA simulations of about 2000 models (BigSurvey)\nregarding the distribution of events connected with electromagnetic and\ngravitational radiations, namely: mass transfer on IMBH, collisions and mergers\nwith IMBH and mergers with IMBH due to gravitational radiation. The rates of\nthese events are very small, so their observation is very improbable.\n", "  Inversive geometry can be used to generate exactly self-similar space-filling\nsphere packings. We present a construction method in two dimensions and\ngeneralize it to search for packings in higher dimensions. We newly discover 29\nthree-dimensional and 13 four-dimensional topologies of which 10 and 5,\nrespectively, are bearings. To distinguish and characterize the packing\ntopologies, we numerically estimate their fractal dimensions and we analyze\ntheir contact networks.\n", "  Strong variations of any kind and causes within a stellar light curve may\nprohibit the detection of transits, particularly of faint or shallow transits\ncaused by small planets passing in front of the stellar disk. The success of\nfuture space telescopes with the goal for finding small planets will be based\non proper filtering, analysis and detection of transits in perturbed stellar\nlight curves. The wavelet-based filter methods VARLET and PHALET, developed by\nRIU-PF, in combination with the transit detection software package EXOTRANS\nallow the extraction of (i) strong stellar variations, (ii) instrument caused\nspikes and singularities within a stellar light curve, (iii) already detected\nplanetary or stellar binary transits in order to be able to search for further\nplanets or planets about binary stars. Once the light curve is filtered,\nEXOTRANS is able to search efficiently, effectively and precisely for transits,\nin particular for faint transits.\n", "  Using a photonic reformatter to eliminate the effects of conventional modal\nnoise could greatly improve the stability of a high resolution spectrograph.\nHowever the regimes where this advantage becomes clear are not yet defined.\nHere we will look at where modal noise becomes a problem in conventional high\nresolution spectroscopy and what impact photonic spectrographs could have. We\nwill theoretically derive achievable radial velocity measurements to compare\nphotonic instruments and conventional ones. We will discuss the theoretical and\nexperimental investigations that will need to be undertaken to optimize and\nprove the photonic reformatting concept.\n", "  The high-energy astrophysical neutrinos recently discovered by IceCube opened\na new way to test Lorentz and CPT violation through the astrophysical neutrino\nmixing properties. The flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos is a very\npowerful tool to investigate tiny effects caused by Lorentz and CPT violation.\nThere are 3 main findings; (1) current limits on Lorentz and CPT violation in\nneutrino sector are not tight and they allow for any flavor ratios, (2)\nhowever, the observable flavor ratio on the Earth is tied with the flavor ratio\nat production, this means we can test both the presence of new physics and the\nastrophysical neutrino production mechanism simultaneously, and (3) the\nastrophysical neutrino flavor ratio is one of the most stringent tests of\nLorentz and CPT violation.\n", "  Axisymmetric Solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations are found in the\nPapapetrou-Weyl gauge. The solutions depend on two pairs of functionals, each\npair of two functions depends on a different arbitrarily chosen function of one\nvariable. Some examples are given.\n", "  A determinant property of the structure of a biological network is the\ndistribution of local connectivity patterns, i.e., network motifs. In this\nwork, a method for creating directed, unweighted networks while promoting a\ncertain combination of motifs is presented. This motif-based network algorithm\nstarts with an empty graph and randomly connects the nodes by advancing or\ndiscouraging the formation of chosen motifs. The in- or out-degree distribution\nof the generated networks can be explicitly chosen. The algorithm is shown to\nperform well in producing networks with high occurrences of the targeted\nmotifs, both ones consisting of 3 nodes as well as ones consisting of 4 nodes.\nMoreover, the algorithm can also be tuned to bring about global network\ncharacteristics found in many natural networks, such as small-worldness and\nmodularity.\n", "  We study deposition and impact of heavy particles onto an in-line tube-banks\nwithin a turbulent cross flow through Lagrangian particle tracking coupled with\nan LES modelling framework. The flow Reynolds number based on the cylinder\ndiameter D and flow velocity between the gap of two vertically adjacent\ncylinders is 33960. We examine the flow structures across the tube bank and\nreport surface pressure characteristics on cylinders. Taking into account\nparticle-wall impact and bounce, we study dispersion and deposition of three\nsets of particles (St = 0.35, 0.086, 0.0075) based on 107 particles tracked\nthrough the turbulent flow resolved by LES. The deposition efficiency for the\nthree sets of particles are reported across the tube-banks. Positions of\nparticle deposited onto tube-banks shows that significantly more of smaller\nparticles deposit onto the back-side of the back-banks. This suggests that the\nsmaller particles are easier to be entrained into the wake and impact onto the\nback-side of cylinders.\n", "  Valuable theoretical predictions of nuclear dipole excitations in the whole\nchart are of great interest for different nuclear applications, including in\nparticular nuclear astrophysics. Here we present large-scale calculations of\nthe $E1$ $\\gamma$-ray strength function obtained in the framework of the\naxially-symmetric deformed QRPA based on the finite-range Gogny force. This\napproach is applied to even-even nuclei, the strength function for odd nuclei\nbeing derived by interpolation. The convergence with respect to the adopted\nnumber of harmonic oscillator shells and the cut-off energy introduced in the\n2-quasiparticle (2-$qp$) excitation space is analyzed. The calculations\nperformed with two different Gogny interactions, namely D1S and D1M, are\ncompared. A systematic energy shift of the $E1$ strength is found for D1M\nrelative to D1S, leading to a lower energy centroid and a smaller\nenergy-weighted sum rule for D1M. When comparing with experimental\nphotoabsorption data, the Gogny-QRPA predictions are found to overestimate the\ngiant dipole energy by typically $\\sim$2 MeV. Despite the microscopic nature of\nour self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus QRPA calculation, some\nphenomenological corrections need to be included to take into account the\neffects beyond the standard 2-$qp$ QRPA excitations and the coupling between\nthe single-particle and low-lying collective phonon degrees of freedom. For\nthis purpose, three prescriptions of folding procedure are considered and\nadjusted to reproduce experimental photoabsorption data at best. All of them\nare shown to lead to rather similar predictions of the $E1$ strength, both at\nlow energies and for exotic neutron-rich nuclei. Predictions of $\\gamma$-ray\nstrength functions and Maxwellian-averaged neutron capture rates for the whole\nSn isotopic chain are also discussed and compared with previous theoretical\ncalculations.\n", "  The elliptic quasimap potential function is explicitly calculated for\nCalabi-Yau complete intersections in projective spaces by Kim and Lho. We\nextend this result to local Calabi-Yau varieties. Using this as well as the\nwall crossing formula by Ciocan-Fontanine and Kim, we can calculate the\nelliptic Gromov-Witten potential function.\n", "  One of the most widely studied problem in mining and analysis of complex\nnetworks is the detection of community structures. The problem has been\nextensively studied by researchers due to its high utility and numerous\napplications in various domains. Many algorithmic solutions have been proposed\nfor the community detection problem but the quest to find the best algorithm is\nstill on. More often than not, researchers focus on developing fast and\naccurate algorithms that can be generically applied to networks from a variety\nof domains without taking into consideration the structural and topological\nvariations in these networks.\n  In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms\nas a function of varying network topology. Along with the well known LFR model\nto generate benchmark networks with communities,we also propose a new model\nnamed Naive Scale Free Model to study the behavior of community detection\nalgorithms with respect to different topological features. More specifically,\nwe are interested in the size of networks, the size of community structures,\nthe average connectivity of nodes and the ratio of inter-intra cluster edges.\nResults reveal several limitations of the current popular network clustering\nalgorithms failing to correctly find communities. This suggests the need to\nrevisit the design of current clustering algorithms that fail to incorporate\nvarying topological features of different networks.\n", "  Muscle uses Ca2+ as a messenger to control contraction and relies on ATP to\nmaintain the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Mitochondria are the major\nsub-cellular organelle of ATP production. With a negative inner membrane\npotential, mitochondria take up Ca2+ from their surroundings, a process called\nmitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ uptake into\nmitochondria promotes ATP production. Excessive uptake causes mitochondrial\nCa2+ overload, which activates downstream adverse responses leading to cell\ndysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could shape spatio-temporal\npatterns of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Malfunction of mitochondrial Ca2+\nuptake is implicated in muscle degeneration. Unlike non-excitable cells,\nmitochondria in muscle cells experience dramatic changes of intracellular Ca2+\nlevels. Besides the sudden elevation of Ca2+ level induced by action\npotentials, Ca2+ transients in muscle cells can be as short as a few\nmilliseconds during a single twitch or as long as minutes during tetanic\ncontraction, which raises the question whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is\nfast and big enough to shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling during\nexcitation-contraction coupling and creates technical challenges for\nquantification of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ inside mitochondria. This review\nfocuses on characterization of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle and\nits role in muscle physiology and diseases.\n", "  Many-body states described by a Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation include states of\noverlapping waves of non-vanishing interaction energies. These peculiar states\nformed in many-body transitions remain in asymptotic regions, and lead a new\ncomponent to the transition probability. The probability is computed rigorously\nfollowing the von Neumann's fundamental principle of quantum mechanics with an\nS-matrix that is defined with normalized functions, instead of plane waves.\nThat includes the intriguing correction term to the Fermi's golden rule, in\nwhich a visible energy is smaller than the initial energy, and reveals\nmacroscopic quantum phenomena for light particles. Processes in Quantum\nElectrodynamics are analyzed and the sizable corrections are found in the\ndilute systems. The results suggest that these states play important roles in\nnatural phenomena, and the verification in laboratory would be possible with\nrecent advanced technology.\n", "  This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale,\nsilicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good\nsources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such\nsources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components,\ninterfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current\nphotonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of\ncomponents on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows\nthe creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for\nquantum computation.\n  At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage\ninvolves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons\nproduced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities)\ncombined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald\nthat a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being\nnear-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an\ninterferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states -\nnecessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a\n`ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an\ninterferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a\nlarge-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing\nimplemented by single-photon measurements.\n  There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and\nuse the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing\nthe initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated\nbefore we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational\ntime-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such\nquestions.\n", "  We explicitly compute the plasma wave (PW) induced by a plane gravitational\nwave (GW) travelling through a region of strongly magnetized plasma, governed\nby force-free electrodynamics. The PW co-moves with the GW and absorbs its\nenergy to grow over time, creating an essentially force-free counterpart to the\ninverse-Gertsenshtein effect. The time-averaged Poynting flux of the induced PW\nis comparable to the vacuum case, but the associated current may offer a more\nsensitive alternative to photodetection when designing experiments for\ndetecting/constraining high frequency gravitational waves. Aside from the exact\nsolutions, we also offer an analysis of the general properties of the GW to PW\nconversion process, which should find use when evaluating electromagnetic\ncounterparts to astrophysical gravitational waves, that are generated directly\nby the latter as a second order phenomenon.\n", "  The analysis of the effect of the hysteresis, which manifests itself in an\nambiguous relationship of radiation from the photosphere, chromosphere and\ncorona on the rise and decline phases of the solar and stellar activity cycles\nhave done. Some indices of solar activity: the flux of the hydrogen Lyman-alpha\nemission, the 10.7 cm flux, the sunspot number SSN, the flux in the coronal\ngreen line 530.3 nm, the solar constant TSI and the 280 nm Mg II flux were\nstudied. The stars with the well-determined cycles were examined to detect the\neffect of hysteresis between the chromosphere's S-index CaII fluxes versus the\nphotosphere's fluxes Fphotosphere.\n", "  We examine a new class of CPT-even and dimension-five nonminimal interactions\nbetween fermions and photons, deprived of higher-order derivatives, yielding\nelectric dipole moment and magnetic dipole moment in the context of the Dirac\nequation. These couplings are Lorentz-violating nonminimal structures, composed\nof a rank-2 tensor, the electromagnetic tensor, and gamma matrices, being\naddressed in its axial and non-axial hermitian versions. We use the electron's\nanomalous magnetic and electric dipole moment measurements to reach upper\nbounds of $1$ part in $10^{11}$ and $10^{16}$ GeV$^{-1}$.\n", "  Astronomical observations of distant quasars may be important to test models\nfor quantum gravity, which posit Planck-scale spatial uncertainties ('spacetime\nfoam') that would produce phase fluctuations in the wavefront of radiation\nemitted by a source, which may accumulate over large path lengths. We show\nexplicitly how wavefront distortions cause the image intensity to decay to the\npoint where distant objects become undetectable if the accumulated path-length\nfluctuations become comparable to the wavelength of the radiation. We also\nreassess previous efforts in this area. We use X-ray and gamma-ray observations\nto rule out several models of spacetime foam, including the interesting\nrandom-walk and holographic models.\n", "  In anticipation of improved observational data for Jupiter's gravitational\nfield from the Juno spacecraft, we predict the static tidal response for a\nvariety of Jupiter interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of\nhydrogen-helium mixtures. We calculate hydrostatic-equilibrium gravity terms\nusing the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method that\neliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method\ncaptures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations,\nwhich we find to be important for a rapidly-rotating planet like Jupiter. Our\npredicted static tidal Love number $k_2 = 0.5900$ is $\\sim$10\\% larger than\nprevious estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal\nharmonic coefficient $J_2$, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes\nare made to interior structure while holding $J_2$ fixed at the observed value.\nWe note that the predicted static $k_2$ might change due to Jupiter's dynamical\nresponse to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may\nbe detectable, although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for\nhighly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter's tidal response\nwill be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal\nsignals from effects of other interior dynamics in Jupiter's gravitational\nfield.\n", "  We study the optical responses of metal nanoparticle chains. Multiple\nscattering calculations are used to study the extinction cross sections of\nsilver nanosphere chains of finite length embedded in a glass matrix. The\ntransmission and reflection coefficients of periodic 2D arrays of silver\nnanospheres are also calculated to understand the interaction between\nnanoparticle chains. The results are in agreement with recent experiments. The\nsplitting of plasmon-resonance modes for different polarizations of the\nincident light are explored. Results on the effect of disorder are also\npresented.\n", "  We demonstrate an efficient eigen-decomposition method for analyzing the\nguided modes in metal nanoparticle chains. The proposed method has the\nadvantage of showing the dispersion relation and mode quality simultaneously.\nIt can also separate the material and geometrical properties, so its efficiency\ndoes not depend on the complexity of the material polarizability. The method is\napplied to analyze the guided modes of a single and a pair of metal chains. The\nmore accurate dynamic dipole polarizability typically gives a red-shift\ncompared with the results obtained with the broadly used quasistatic dipole\npolarizability with radiation correction.\n"]}
