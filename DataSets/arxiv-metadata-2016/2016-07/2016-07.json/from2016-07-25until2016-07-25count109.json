We prove that bi-invariant quantum Brownian motion\ncan be 'deformed' in a suitable sense. Moreover, we propose a noncommutative\nanalogue of the well-known asymptotics of the exit time of classical Brownian\nmotion. We explicitly analyze such asymptotics for a specific example on\nnoncommutative two-torus A{\\theta}, which seems to behave like a\none-dimensional manifold, perhaps reminiscent of the fact that A{\\theta} is a\nnoncommutative model of the (locally one-dimensional) 'leaf-space' of the\nKronecker foliation.\n", "  Initially, we make a detailed historical survey of van der Waals forces,\ncollecting the main references on the subject. Then, we review a method\nrecently proposed by Eberlein and Zietal to compute the dispersion van der\nWaals interaction between a neutral but polarizable atom and a perfectly\nconducting surface of arbitrary shape. This method has the advantage of\nrelating the quantum problem to a corresponding classical one in electrostatics\nso that all one needs is to compute an appropriate Green function. We show how\nthe image method of electrostatics can be conveniently used together with the\nEberlein and Zietal mehtod (when the problem admits an image solution). We then\nillustrate this method in a couple of simple but important cases, including the\natom-sphere system. Particularly, in our last example, we present an original\nresult, namely, the van der Waals force between an atom and a boss hat made of\na grounded conducting material.\n", "  Unlike atoms in a lattice, the spacings between neighboring qubits in a\nsuperconducting quantum circuit are mesoscopic and non-uniform. The strength of\ninteraction between this quasi-lattice chain of qubits and a resonator mode in\ncircuit transmission lines is inhomogeneous and geometrically dependent on the\ncircuit layout. We propose a projection-deformation method to give analytically\nthe eigenstates of the quasi-particle excitation that arise in the\nquasi-lattice. We further show that, during the quasi-particle excitation, the\ndistribution of multi-photon resonances between the resonator photon and the\nquasi-lattice is determined by the degree the quasi-lattice is deformed from a\nnormal lattice. The multi-photon resonances lead to simultaneous generation of\nGHZ-type and W-type of multipartite entanglement states of the qubits, which is\nenhanced by the inhomogeneous interaction. Comparing the concurrence and the\n3-tangle generated, we find that the totally non-separable GHZ entanglement is\nspecifically increased, up to two orders of magnitude.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental works, we investigate a system of vortex\ndynamics in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), consisting of three\nvortices, two of which have the same charge. These vortices are modeled as a\nsystem of point particles which possesses a Hamiltonian structure. This tripole\nsystem constitutes a prototypical model of vortices in BECs exhibiting chaos.\nBy using the angular momentum integral of motion we reduce the study of the\nsystem to the investigation of a two degree of freedom Hamiltonian model and\nacquire quantitative results about its chaotic behavior. Our investigation tool\nis the construction of scan maps by using the Smaller ALignment Index (SALI) as\na chaos indicator. Applying this approach to a large number of initial\nconditions we manage to accurately and efficiently measure the extent of chaos\nin the model and its dependence on physically important parameters like the\nenergy and the angular momentum of the system.\n", "  We present an algorithm and its parallel implementation for solving a self\nconsistent problem as encountered in Hartree Fock or Density Functional Theory.\nThe algorithm takes advantage of the sparsity of matrices through the use of\nlocal molecular orbitals. The implementation allows to exploit efficiently\nmodern symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) computer architectures. As a first\napplication, the algorithm is used within the density functional based tight\nbinding method, for which most of the computational time is spent in the linear\nalgebra routines (diagonalization of the Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix). We show that\nwith this algorithm (i) single point calculations on very large systems\n(millions of atoms) can be performed on large SMP machines (ii) calculations\ninvolving intermediate size systems (1~000--100~000 atoms) are also strongly\naccelerated and can run efficiently on standard servers (iii) the error on the\ntotal energy due to the use of a cut-off in the molecular orbital coefficients\ncan be controlled such that it remains smaller than the SCF convergence\ncriterion.\n", "  We present a comparative study of the spatial distribution of the spin\ndensity (SD) of the ground state of CuCl2 using Density Functional Theory\n(DFT), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), and post-Hartree-Fock wavefunction theory\n(WFT). A number of studies have shown that an accurate description of the\nelectronic structure of the lowest-lying states of this molecule is\nparticularly challenging due to the interplay between the strong dynamical\ncorrelation effects in the 3d shell of the copper atom and the delocalization\nof the 3d hole over the chlorine atoms. It is shown here that qualitatively\ndifferent results for SD are obtained from these various quantum-chemical\napproaches. At the DFT level, the spin density distribution is directly related\nto the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange introduced in hybrid functionals. At the\nQMC level, Fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) results for SD are\nstrongly dependent on the nodal structure of the trial wavefunction employed\n(here, Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham with a particular amount of HF exchange) : in\nthe case of this open-shell system, the 3N -dimensional nodes are mainly\ndetermined by the 3-dimensional nodes of the singly occupied molecular orbital.\nRegarding wavefunction approaches, HF and CASSCF lead to strongly localized\nspin density on the copper atom, in sharp contrast with DFT. To get a more\nreliable description and shed some light on the connections between the various\ntheoretical descriptions, Full CI-type (FCI) calculations are performed. To\nmake them feasible for this case a perturbatively selected CI approach\ngenerating multi-determinantal expansions of reasonable size and a small\ntractable basis set are employed. Although semi-quantitative, these near-FCI\ncalculations allow to clarify how the spin density distribution evolves upon\ninclusion of dynamic correlation effects. A plausible scenario about the nature\nof the SD is proposed.\n", "  The potential energy curve of the F$_2$ molecule is calculated with\nFixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) using Configuration Interaction\n(CI)-type trial wavefunctions. To keep the number of determinants reasonable\n(the first and second derivatives of the trial wavefunction need to be\ncalculated at each step of FN-DMC), the CI expansion is restricted to those\ndeterminants that contribute the most to the total energy. The selection of the\ndeterminants is made using the so-called CIPSI approach (Configuration\nInteraction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively). Quite remarkably,\nthe nodes of CIPSI wavefunctions are found to be systematically improved when\nincreasing the number of selected determinants. To reduce the non-parallelism\nerror of the potential energy curve a scheme based on the use of a\n$R$-dependent number of determinants is introduced. Numerical results show that\nimproved FN-DMC energy curves for the F$_2$ molecule are obtained when\nemploying CIPSI trial wavefunctions. Using the Dunning's cc-pVDZ basis set the\nFN-DMC energy curve is of a quality similar to that obtained with FCI/cc-pVQZ.\nA key advantage of using selected CI in FN-DMC is the possibility of improving\nnodes in a systematic and automatic way without resorting to a preliminary\nmulti-parameter stochastic optimization of the trial wavefunction performed at\nthe Variational Monte Carlo level as usually done in FN-DMC.\n", "  We consider Rota-Baxter algebras of meromorphic forms with poles along a\n(singular) hypersurface in a smooth projective variety and the associated\nBirkhoff factorization for algebra homomorphisms from a commutative Hopf\nalgebra. In the case of a normal crossings divisor, the Rota-Baxter structure\nsimplifies considerably and the factorization becomes a simple pole\nsubtraction. We apply this formalism to the unrenormalized momentum space\nFeynman amplitudes, viewed as (divergent) integrals in the complement of the\ndeterminant hypersurface. We lift the integral to the Kausz compactification of\nthe general linear group, whose boundary divisor is normal crossings. We show\nthat the Kausz compactification is a Tate motive and that the boundary divisor\nand the divisor that contains the boundary of the chain of integration are\nmixed Tate configurations. The regularization of the integrals that we obtain\ndiffers from the usual renormalization of physical Feynman amplitudes, and in\nparticular it may give mixed Tate periods in some cases that have non-mixed\nTate contributions when computed with other renormalization methods.\n", "  We present accurate nonrelativistic ground-state energies of the transition\nmetal atoms of the 3d series calculated with Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo\n(FN-DMC). Selected multi-determinantal expansions obtained with the CIPSI\nmethod (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made\nIteratively) and including the most prominent determinants of the full CI\nexpansion are used as trial wavefunctions. Using a maximum of a few tens of\nthousands determinants, fixed-node errors on total DMC energies are found to be\ngreatly reduced for some atoms with respect to those obtained with Hartree-Fock\nnodes. The FN-DMC/(CIPSI nodes) ground-state energies presented here are, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the most accurate values reported so far. Thanks to\nthe variational property of FN-DMC total energies, the results also provide\nlower bounds for the absolute value of all-electron correlation energies,\n$|E_c|$.\n", "  We have used time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering to measure the spin\nwave spectrum of the canonical half-doped manganite\nPr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$, in its magnetic and orbitally ordered phase. The\ndata, which cover multiple Brillouin zones and the entire energy range of the\nexcitations, are compared with several different models that are all consistent\nwith the CE-type magnetic order, but arise through different exchange coupling\nschemes. The Goodenough model, i.e. an ordered state comprising strong nearest\nneighbor ferromagnetic interactions along zig-zag chains with antiferromagnetic\ninter-chain coupling, provides the best description of the data, provided that\nfurther neighbor interactions along the chains are included. We are able to\nrule out a coupling scheme involving formation of strongly bound ferromagnetic\ndimers, i.e. Zener polarons, on the basis of gross features of the observed\nspin wave spectrum. A model with weaker dimerization reproduces the observed\ndispersion but can be ruled out on the basis of discrepancies between the\ncalculated and observed structure factors at certain positions in reciprocal\nspace. Adding further neighbor interactions results in almost no dimerization,\ni.e. recovery of the Goodenough model. These results are consistent with\ntheoretical analysis of the degenerate double exchange model for half-doping,\nand provide a recipe for how to interpret future measurements away from\nhalf-doping, where degenerate double exchange models predict more complex\nground states.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a type of quantum correlation which\nallows one to remotely prepare, or steer, the state of a distant quantum\nsystem. While EPR steering can be thought of as a purely spatial correlation\nthere does exist a temporal analogue, in the form of single-system temporal\nsteering. However, a precise quantification of such temporal steering has been\nlacking. Here we show that it can be measured, via semidefinite programming,\nwith a temporal steerable weight, in direct analogy to the recently proposed\nEPR steerable weight. We find a useful property of the temporal steerable\nweight in that it is a non-increasing function under completely-positive\ntrace-preserving maps and can be used to define a sufficient and practical\nmeasure of strong non-Markovianity.\n", "  Non-Abelian flux-tube (string) solutions carrying global currents are found\nin the bosonic sector of 4-dimensional N=2 super-symmetric gauge theories. The\nspecific model considered here posseses U(2)local x SU(2)global symmetry, with\ntwo scalar doublets in the fundamental representation of SU(2). We construct\nstring solutions that are stationary and translationally symmetric along the x3\ndirection, and they are characterized by a matrix phase between the two\ndoublets, referred to as \"twist\". Consequently, twisted strings have nonzero\n(global) charge, momentum, and in some cases even angular momentum per unit\nlength. The planar cross section of a twisted string corresponds to a\nrotationally symmetric, charged non-Abelian vortex, satisfying 1st order\nBogomolny-type equations and 2nd order Gauss-constraints. Interestingly,\ndepending on the nature of the matrix phase, some of these solutions even break\nrotational symmetry in R3. Although twisted vortices have higher energy than\nthe untwisted ones, they are expected to be linearly stable since one can\nmaintain their charge (or twist) fixed with respect to small perturbations.\n", "  One of the most fundamental problems in quantum many-body systems is the\nidentification of a mean field in spontaneous symmetry breaking which is\nusually made in a heuristic manner. We propose a systematic method of finding a\nmean field based on the Lie algebra and the dynamical symmetry by introducing a\nclass of symmetry broken phases which we call $\\mu$-symmetry breaking. We show\nthat for $\\mu$-symmetry breaking the quadratic part of an effective Lagrangian\nof Nambu-Goldstone modes can be block-diagonalized and that homotopy groups of\ntopological excitations can be calculated systematically.\n", "  We present an all sky map of the $y$-type distortion calculated from the full\nmission Planck HFI (High Frequency Instrument) data using the recently proposed\napproach to component separation based on parametric model fitting and model\nselection. This simple model selection approach allows us to distinguish\nbetween carbon monoxide (CO) line emission and $y$-type distortion, something\nthat is not possible using the internal linear combination based methods. We\ncreate a mask to cover the regions of significant CO emission relying on the\ninformation in the $\\chi^2$ map obtained when fitting for the $y$-distortion\nand CO emission to the lowest four HFI channels. We revisit the second Planck\ncluster catalog and try to quantify the quality of the cluster candidates in an\napproach that is similar in spirit to Aghanim et al. (2014). We find that at\nleast $93\\%$ of the clusters in the cosmology sample are free of CO\ncontamination. We also find that $59\\%$ of unconfirmed candidates may have\nsignificant contamination from molecular clouds. We agree with Planck\ncollaboration (2015) for the worst offenders. We suggest an alternative\nvalidation strategy of measuring and subtracting the CO emission from the\nPlanck cluster candidates using radio telescopes thus improving the reliability\nof the catalog. Our CO mask and annotations to the Planck cluster catalog\nidentifying cluster candidates with possible CO contamination are made publicly\navailable.\n", "  We present and investigate an analogue model for a controllable photon\ngeberation via the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in a cavity containing a\ndegenerate optical amplifier (OPA) which is pumed by an amplitude-modulated\nfield. The time modulation of the pump field in the model OPA system is\nequivalent to a periodic modulation of the cavity length, which is responsible\nfor the generation of the Casimir radiation. By taking into account the rapidly\noscillating terms of the modulation frequency, the effects of the corresponding\ncounter-rotating terms (CRTs) on the analogue Casimir radiation emerge clearly.\nWe find that the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical\nproperties exhibit oscillatory behaviors, which are controllable through the\nmodulation frequency as an external control parameter.We also recognize a new\nphenomenon, the so-called \"Anti-DCE,\" in which pair photons can be coherently\nannihilated due to the time-modulated pumping. We show that the Casimir\nradiation exhibits quadrature squeezing, photon bunching and super-Poissonian\nstatistics which are controllable by modulation frequency. We also calculate\nthe power spectrum of the intracavity light field. We find that the appearance\nof the side bands in the spectrum is due to the presence of the CRTs.\n", "  How to macroscopically control the flow of heat at will is up to now a\nchallenge, which, however, is very important for human life since heat flow is\na ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Inspired by intelligent electronic\ncomponents or intelligent materials, here we demonstrate, analytically and\nnumerically, a unique class of intelligent bifunctional thermal metamaterials\ncalled thermal cloak-concentrators, which can automatically change from a cloak\n(concentrator) to a concentrator (cloak) when the applied temperature field\ndecreases (increases). For future experimental realization, the behavior is\nalso confirmed by assembling homogeneous isotropic materials according to the\neffective medium theory. The underlying mechanism originates from the effect of\nnonlinearity in thermal conduction. This work not only makes it possible to\nachieve a switchable Seebeck effect, but also offers guidance both for\nmacroscopic manipulation of heat flow at will and for the design of similar\nintelligent multifunctional metamaterials in optics, electromagnetics,\nacoustics, or elastodynamics.\n", "  Social identities are among the key factors driving behavior in complex\nsocieties. Signals of social identity are known to influence individual\nbehaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences\nof identity signaling on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here\nwe use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a\nbeneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two\ngroups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the\ndynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as\ndemographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find\nthat outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one\ngroup, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two\nmodels, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural\nconstraints on information flow even in the absence of intrinsic between-group\ndifferences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization\nin adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of\ndemographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has\nparticular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and\nbehaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption\ndetermine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.\n", "  We investigate whether compact stars having Tolman-like interior geometry\nadmit conformal symmetry. Taking anisotropic pressure along the two principal\ndirections within the compact object, we obtain physically relevant quantities\nsuch as transverse and radial pressure, density and redshift function. We study\nthe equation of state for the matter distribution inside the star. From the\nrelation between pressure and density function of the constituent matter, we\nexplore the nature and properties of the interior matter. The red shift\nfunction, compactness parameter are found to be physically reasonable. The\nmatter inside the star satisfies the null, weak and strong energy conditions.\nFinally, we compare the masses and radii predicted from the model with\ncorresponding values in some observed stars.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a unidirectional quenched random field on the\nanisotropic quantum spin-1/2 $XY$ model, which magnetizes spontaneously in the\nabsence of the random field. We adopt mean-field approach to show that\nspontaneous magnetization persists even in the presence of this random field\nbut the magnitude of magnetization gets suppressed due to disorder, and the\nsystem magnetizes in the directions parallel and transverse to the random\nfield. Our results are obtained by analytical calculations within perturbative\nframework and by numerical simulations. Interestingly, we show that it is\npossible to enhance a component of the magnetization in presence of the\ndisorder field provided we apply an additional constant field in the $XY$\nplane. Moreover, we derive generalized expressions for the critical temperature\nand the scalings of the magnetization near the critical point for the $XY$ spin\nsystem with arbitrary fixed quantum spin angular momentum.\n", "  Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build\nscientific instruments; with the advent of readily-available 3D printers,\nmechanical designs can now be shared, improved and replicated faster and more\neasily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often\nperform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome\nmany of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance\nof the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage,\ncapable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of $8\\times8\\times4\\,$mm. This\nrequires minimal post-print clean-up, and can be automated with\nreadily-available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is\nvery stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than $20\\,\\mu$m over\nthe course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to\nconstruct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect\nfor timelapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of\nmanufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability\nis advantageous, and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel.\nHigh performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to\nmicroscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the\nlaboratory and beyond.\n", "  Ultrafast shadowgraphy is a new experimental technique that uses few cycle\nlaser pulses to image density gradients in a rapidly evolving plasma. It\nenables structures that move at speeds close to the speed of light, such as\nlaser driven wakes, to be visualized. Here we study the process of\nshadowgraphic image formation during the propagation of a few cycle probe pulse\ntransversely through a laser-driven wake using three-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations. In order to construct synthetic shadowgrams a\nnear-field snapshot of the ultrashort probe pulse is analyzed by means of\nFourier optics, taking into account the effect of a typical imaging setup. By\ncomparing synthetic and experimental shadowgrams we show that the generation of\nsynthetic data is crucial for the correct interpretation of experiments.\nMoreover, we study the dependence of synthetic shadowgrams on various\nparameters such as the imaging system aperture, the position of the object\nplane and the probe pulse delay, duration and wavelength. Finally, we show that\ntime-dependent information from the interaction can be recovered from a single\nshot by using a broadband, chirped probe pulse and subsequent spectral\nfiltering.\n", "  Power law-like size distributions are ubiquitous in astrophysical\ninstabilities. There are at least four natural effects that cause deviations\nfrom ideal power law size distributions, which we model here in a generalized\nway: (1) a physical threshold of an instability; (2) incomplete sampling of the\nsmallest events below a threshold $x_0$; (3) contamination by an\nevent-unrelated background $x_b$; and (4) truncation effects at the largest\nevents due to a finite system size. These effects can be modeled in simplest\nterms with a \"thresholded power law\" distribution function (also called\ngeneralized Pareto [type II] or Lomax distribution), $N(x) dx \\propto\n(x+x_0)^{-a} dx$, where $x_0 > 0$ is positive for a threshold effect, while\n$x_0 < 0$ is negative for background contamination. We analytically derive the\nfunctional shape of this thresholded power law distribution function from an\nexponential-growth evolution model, which produces avalanches only when a\ndisturbance exceeds a critical threshold $x_0$. We apply the thresholded power\nlaw distribution function to terrestrial, solar (HXRBS, BATSE, RHESSI), and\nstellar flare (Kepler) data sets. We find that the thresholded power law model\nprovides an adequate fit to most of the observed data. Major advantages of this\nmodel are the automated choice of the power law fitting range, diagnostics of\nbackground contamination, physical inastability thresholds, instrumental\ndetection thresholds, and finite system size limits. When testing\nself-organized criticality models, which predict ideal power laws, we suggest\nto include these natural truncation effects.\n", "  We extend the ab initio coupled-cluster effective interaction (CCEI) method\nto deformed open-shell nuclei with protons and neutrons in the valence space,\nand compute binding energies and excited states of isotopes of neon and\nmagnesium. We employ a nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interaction from\nchiral effective field theory evolved to a lower cutoff via a similarity\nrenormalization group transformation. We find good agreement with experiment\nfor binding energies and spectra, while charge radii of neon isotopes are\nunderestimated. For the deformed nuclei $^{20}$Ne and $^{24}$Mg we reproduce\nrotational bands and electric quadrupole transitions within uncertainties\nestimated from an effective field theory for deformed nuclei, thereby\ndemonstrating that collective phenomena in $sd$-shell nuclei emerge from\ncomplex ab initio calculations.\n", "  We propose a new theory of higher spin gravity in three spacetime dimensions.\nThis is defined by what we will call a Nambu-Chern-Simons (NCS) action; this is\nto a Nambu 3-algebra as an ordinary Chern-Simons (CS) action is to a Lie\n(2-)algebra. The novelty is that the gauge group of this theory is simple; this\nstands in contrast to previously understood interacting 3D higher spin theories\nin the frame-like formalism. We also consider the $N=8$ supersymmetric\nNCS-matter model (BLG theory), where the NCS action originated: Its fully\nsupersymmetric M2 brane configurations are interpreted as Hopf fibrations, the\nhomotopy type of the (infinite) gauge group is calculated and its instantons\nare classified.\n", "  We reconsider the problem of $f(R)$ theories of gravity coupled to\nBorn-Infeld theory of electrodynamics formulated in a Palatini approach, where\nmetric and connection are independent fields. By studying electrovacuum\nconfigurations in a static and spherically symmetric space-time, we find\nsolutions which reduce to their Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om counterparts at large\ndistances but undergo important non-perturbative modifications close to the\ncenter. Our new analysis reveals that the point-like singularity is replaced by\na finite-size wormhole structure, which provides a geodesically complete and\nthus nonsingular space-time, despite the existence of curvature divergences at\nthe wormhole throat. Implications of these results, in particular for the\ncosmic censorship conjecture, are discussed.\n", "  We compute the five point world sheet scattering amplitude of a symmetric\nclosed string Ramond-Ramond , a transverse scalar field, a world volume gauge\nfield and a real tachyon in both world volume and transverse directions of\nbrane in type IIA and IIB superstring theory. We provide the complete analysis\nof $<C^{-1} \\phi^0 A^0 T ^{-1}>$ S-matrix and show that both $u'=u+\\frac{1}{4}$\nand $t$ channel bulk singularity structures can also be examined by this\nS-matrix. Various remarks about new restricted Bianchi identities on world\nvolume for the other pictures have also been made.\n", "  Investigation of laser matter interaction with electromagnetic codes requires\nto implement sources for the electromagnetic fields. A way to do so is to\nprescribe the fields at the numerical box boundaries in order to achieve the\ndesired fields inside the numerical box. Here we show that the often used\nparaxial approximation can lead to unexpected field profiles with strong impact\non the laser matter interaction results. We propose an efficient numerical\nalgorithm to compute the required laser boundary conditions consistent with the\nMaxwell's equations for arbitrarily shaped, tightly focused laser pulses.\n", "  The grand canonical ensemble lies at the core of quantum and classical\nstatistical mechanics. A small system thermalizes to this ensemble while\nexchanging heat and particles with a bath. A quantum system may exchange\nquantities represented by operators that fail to commute. Whether such a system\nthermalizes and what form the thermal state has are questions about truly\nquantum thermodynamics. Here we investigate this thermal state from three\nperspectives. First, we introduce an approximate microcanonical ensemble. If\nthis ensemble characterizes the system-and-bath composite, tracing out the bath\nyields the system's thermal state. This state is expected to be the equilibrium\npoint, we argue, of typical dynamics. Finally, we define a resource-theory\nmodel for thermodynamic exchanges of noncommuting observables. Complete\npassivity---the inability to extract work from equilibrium states---implies the\nthermal state's form, too. Our work opens new avenues into equilibrium in the\npresence of quantum noncommutation.\n", "  We perform current(I)-voltage(V) measurements on low resistance\nsuperconductor-normal-superconductor arrays in finite magnetic fields, focusing\non the dilute vortex population regime. We observe significant deviations from\npredicted behavior, notably the absence of a differential resistance peak near\nthe vortex de-pinning current, and a broad linear I-V region with an\nextrapolated I intercept equal to the de-pinning current. Comparing these\nresults to an overdamped molecular vortex model, we find that this behavior can\nbe explained by the presence of a history dependent dissipative force. This\napproach has not been considered previously, yet is crucial for obtaining a\ncorrect description of the vortex dynamics in superconducting arrays.\n", "  Under non-equilibrium conditions, bosonic modes can become dynamically\nunstable with an exponentially growing occupation. On the other hand,\ntopological band structures give rise to symmetry protected midgap states. In\nthis letter, we investigate the interplay of instability and topology. Thereby,\nwe establish a general relation between topology and instability under\nac-driving. We apply our findings to create dynamical instabilities which are\nstrongly localized at the boundaries of a finite-size system. As these\nlocalized instabilities are protected by symmetry, they can be considered as\ntopological instabilities.\n", "  Virtual globes - programs implementing interactive three-dimensional (3D)\nmodels of planets - are increasingly used in geosciences. Global morphometric\nmodels can be useful for tectonic and planetary studies. We describe the\ndevelopment of the first testing version of the system of virtual morphometric\nglobes for the Earth, Mars, and the Moon. As the initial data, we used three\n15'-gridded global digital elevation models (DEMs) extracted from SRTM30_PLUS,\nthe Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, and the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter gridded\narchives. For three planetary bodies, we derived global digital models and maps\nof several morphometric attributes (i.e., horizontal curvature, vertical\ncurvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, and catchment area). To\ndevelop the system, we used Blender, the open-source software for 3D modeling\nand visualization. First, a 3D sphere model was generated. Second, the global\nmorphometric maps as textures were imposed to the sphere surface. Finally, the\nreal-time 3D graphics Blender engine was used to implement globe rotation and\nzooming. The testing of the developed system demonstrated its good performance.\nMorphometric globes clearly represent peculiarities of planetary topography,\naccording to the physical and mathematical sense of a particular morphometric\nvariable.\n", "  At the jamming transition, amorphous packings are known to display anomalous\nvibrational modes with a density of states (DOS) that remains constant at low\nfrequency. The scaling of the DOS at higher densities remains, however,\nunclear. One might expect to find simple Debye scaling, but recent results from\neffective medium theory and the exact solution of mean-field models both\npredict an anomalous, non-Debye scaling. Being mean-field solutions, however,\nthese solutions are only strictly applicable to the limit of infinite spatial\ndimension, and it is unclear what value they have for finite-dimensional\nsystems. Here, we study packings of soft spheres in dimensions 3 through 7 and\nfind, far from jamming, a universal non-Debye scaling of the DOS that is\nconsistent with the mean-field predictions. We also consider how the soft mode\nparticipation ratio converges to the mean-field prediction as dimension\nincreases.\n", "  Wormholes may arise as solutions of extensions of General Relativity without\nviolation of the energy conditions. Working in a Palatini approach we consider\nclassical geometries supporting such wormholes. It is shown that the resulting\nspace-times represent explicit realizations of the concept of geon introduced\nby Wheeler, interpreted as self-consistent bodies generated by an\nelectromagnetic field without sources.\n", "  Using exactly solvable models, it is shown that black hole singularities in\ndifferent electrically charged configurations can be cured. Our solutions\ndescribe black hole space-times with a wormhole giving structure to the\notherwise point-like singularity. We show that geodesic completeness is\nsatisfied despite the existence of curvature divergences at the wormhole\nthroat. In some cases, physical observers can go through the wormhole and in\nother cases the throat lies at an infinite affine distance.\n", "  Nowadays, scientific challenges usually require approaches that cross\ntraditional boundaries between academic disciplines, driving many researchers\ntowards interdisciplinarity. Despite its obvious importance, there is a lack of\nstudies on how to quantify the influence of interdisciplinarity on the research\nimpact, posing uncertainty in a proper evaluation for hiring and funding\npurposes. Here we propose a method based on the analysis of bipartite\ninterconnected multilayer networks of citations and disciplines, to assess\nscholars, institutions and countries interdisciplinary importance. Using data\nabout physics publications and US patents, we show that our method allows to\nreward, using a quantitative approach, scholars and institutions that have\ncarried out interdisciplinary work and have had an impact in different\nscientific areas. The proposed method could be used by funding agencies,\nuniversities and scientific policy decision makers for hiring and funding\npurposes, and to complement existing methods to rank universities and\ncountries.\n", "  In this work we provide an updated description of the Vertical Current\nApproximation Nonlinear Force-Free Field (VCA-NLFFF) code, which is designed to\nmeasure the evolution of the potential, nonpotential, free energies, and the\ndissipated magnetic energies during solar flares. This code provides a\ncomplementary and alternative method to existing traditional NLFFF codes. The\nchief advantages of the VCA-NLFFF code over traditional NLFFF codes are the\ncircumvention of the unrealistic assumption of a force-free photosphere in the\nmagnetic field extrapolation method, the capability to minimize the\nmisalignment angles between observed coronal loops (or chromospheric fibril\nstructures) and theoretical model field lines, as well as computational speed.\nIn performance tests of the VCA-NLFFF code, by comparing with the NLFFF code of\nWiegelmann (2004), we find agreement in the potential, nonpotential, and free\nenergy within a factor of about 1.3, but the Wiegelmann code yields in the\naverage a factor of 2 lower flare energies. The VCA-NLFFF code is found to\ndetect decreases in flare energies in most X, M, and C-class flares. The\nsuccessful detection of energy decreases during a variety of flares with the\nVCA-NLFFF code indicates that current-driven twisting and untwisting of the\nmagnetic field is an adequate model to quantify the storage of magnetic\nenergies in active regions and their dissipation during flares. - The VCA-NLFFF\ncode is also publicly available in the Solar SoftWare (SSW).\n", "  The impact of curvature divergences on physical observers in a black hole\nspace-time which, nonetheless, is geodesically complete is investigated. This\nspace-time is an exact solution of certain extensions of General Relativity\ncoupled to Maxwell's electrodynamics and, roughly speaking, consists on two\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m (or Schwarzschild or Minkowski) geometries connected by\na spherical wormhole near the center. We find that, despite the existence of\ninfinite tidal forces, causal contact is never lost among the elements making\nup the observer. This suggests that curvature divergences may not be as\npathological as traditionally thought.\n", "  The aim of this study is to explore the suitability of chromospheric images\nfor magnetic modeling of active regions. We use high-resolution images (0.1\")\nfrom the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) in the Ca II 8542 A\nline, the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument in the\nH-alpha 6563 A line, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the\n2796 A line, and compare non-potential magnetic field models obtained from\nthose chromospheric images with those obtained from images of the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) in coronal (171 A, etc.) and in chromospheric (304 A)\nwavelengths. Curvi-linear structures are automatically traced in those images\nwith the OCCULT-2 code, to which we forward-fitted magnetic field lines\ncomputed with the Vertical-Current Approximation Non-Linear Force Free Field\n(VCA-NLFFF) code. We find that the chromospheric images: (1) reveal crisp\ncurvi-linear structures (fibrils, loop segments, spicules) that are extremely\nwell-suited for constraining magnetic modeling; (2) that these curvi-linear\nstructures are field-aligned with the best-fit solution by a median\nmisalignment angle of ~4-7 deg; (3) the free energy computed from coronal data\nmay underestimate that obtained from cromospheric data by a factor of ~ 2-4,\n(4) the height range of chromospheric features is confined to h ~ 4000$ km,\nwhile coronal features are detected up to h ~ 35,000$ km; and (5) the\nplasma-beta parameter is beta ~ 10^(-5)-10^(-1) for all traced features. We\nconclude that chromospheric images reveal important magnetic structures that\nare complementary to coronal images and need to be included in comprehensive\nmagnetic field models, a quest that is not accomodated in standard NLFFF codes.\n", "  We evaluate $n$-particle ($n=2,3,4,5$) transverse momentum correlations for\npions and kaons following from the decay of statistical clusters. These\ncorrelation functions could provide strong constraints on a possible existence\nof thermal clusters in the process of particle production.\n", "  We study the effects of applying observational techniques to derive the\nproperties of simulated galaxies, with the aim of making an unbiased comparison\nbetween observations and simulations. For our study, we used fifteen galaxies\nsimulated in a cosmological context using three different feedback and chemical\nenrichment models, and compared their z=0 properties with data from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). We show that the physical properties obtained\ndirectly from the simulations without post-processing can be very different to\nthose obtained mimicking observational techniques. In order to provide\nsimulators a way to reliably compare their galaxies with SDSS data, for each\nphysical property that we studied - colours, magnitudes, gas and stellar\nmetallicities, mean stellar ages and star formation rates - we give scaling\nrelations that can be easily applied to the values extracted from the\nsimulations. These scalings have in general a high correlation, except for the\ngalaxy mean stellar ages and gas oxygen metallicities. Our simulated galaxies\nare photometrically similar to galaxies in the blue cloud/green valley, but in\ngeneral they appear older, passive and with lower metal content compared to\nmost of the spirals in SDSS. As a careful assessment of the\nagreement/disagreement with observations is the primary test of the baryonic\nphysics implemented in hydrodynamical codes, our study shows that considering\nthe observational biases in the derivation of the galaxies' properties is of\nfundamental importance to decide on the failure/success of a galaxy formation\nmodel.\n", "  We give the geralized expression of spin precession of extended bunch\nparticles having both anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments in storage\nring. The transversal betatron oscillation formula of the bunch is also given.\nThe latter is the generalization of the Farley's pitch correction\n\\cite{Farley}, including radial oscillation as well as vertical one. Some\nuseful formulae for muon storage ring are discussed in appendix.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on all-optical magnetization reversal in\nconductive ferromagnetic thin films we use nonequilibrium formalism to\ncalculate the effective magnetic field induced in a Rashba ferromagnet by a\nshort laser pulse. The main contribution to the effect originates in the direct\noptical transitions between spin-split subbands. The resulting effective\nmagnetic field is inversely proportional to the impurity scattering rate and\ncan reach the amplitude of a few Tesla in the systems like Co/Pt bilayers. We\nshowthat the total light-induced effective magnetic field in ferromagnetic\nsystems is the sum of two contributions: a helicity dependent term, which is an\neven function of magnetization, and a helicity independent term, which is an\nodd function of magnetization. The primary role of the spin-orbit interaction\nis to widen the frequency range for direct optical transitions.\n", "  In this work, we propose and test a strategy for tunable, broadband wave\nattenuation in electromechanical waveguides with shunted piezoelectric\ninclusions. Our strategy is built upon the vast pre-existing literature on\nvibration attenuation and bandgap generation in structures featuring periodic\narrays of piezo patches, but distinguishes itself for several key features.\nFirst, we demystify the idea that periodicity is a requirement for wave\nattenuation and bandgap formation. We further embrace the idea of \"organized\ndisorder\" by tuning the circuits as to resonate at distinct neighboring\nfrequencies. In doing so, we create a tunable \"rainbow trap\" [Tsakmakidis et\nal. Nature 450, 397-401 (2007)] capable of attenuating waves with broadband\ncharacteristics, by \"distilling\" (sequentially) seven frequencies from a\ntraveling wavepacket. Finally, we devote considerable attention to the\nimplications in terms of packet distortion of the spectral manipulation\nintroduced by shunting. This work is also meant to serve as a didactic tool for\nthose approaching the field of shunted piezoelectrics, and attempts to provide\na different perspective, with abundant details, on how to successfully design\nan experimental setup involving resistive-inductive shunts.\n", "  In quantum field theory, we learn that fermions come in three varieties:\nMajorana, Weyl, and Dirac. Here we show that in solid state systems this\nclassification is incomplete and find several additional types of crystal\nsymmetry-protected free fermionic excitations . We exhaustively classify linear\nand quadratic 3-, 6- and 8- band crossings stabilized by space group symmetries\nin solid state systems with spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry.\nSeveral distinct types of fermions arise, differentiated by their degeneracies\nat and along high symmetry points, lines, and surfaces. Some notable\nconsequences of these fermions are the presence of Fermi arcs in non-Weyl\nsystems and the existence of Dirac lines. Ab-initio calculations identify a\nnumber of materials that realize these exotic fermions close to the Fermi\nlevel.\n", "  We present observations of SN 2015bn (= PS15ae = CSS141223-113342+004332 =\nMLS150211-113342+004333), a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift\n$z=0.1136$. As well as being one of the closest SLSNe I yet discovered, it is\nintrinsically brighter ($M_U\\approx-23.1$) and in a fainter galaxy\n($M_B\\approx-16.0$) than other SLSNe at $z\\sim0.1$. We used this opportunity to\ncollect the most extensive dataset for any SLSN I to date, including\ndensely-sampled spectroscopy and photometry, from the UV to the NIR, spanning\n$-$50 to +250 days from optical maximum. SN 2015bn fades slowly, but exhibits\nsurprising undulations in the light curve on a timescale of 30-50 days,\nespecially in the UV. The spectrum shows extraordinarily slow evolution except\nfor a rapid transformation between +7 and +20-30 days. No narrow emission lines\nfrom slow-moving material are observed at any phase. We derive physical\nproperties including the bolometric luminosity, and find slow velocity\nevolution and non-monotonic temperature and radial evolution. A deep radio\nlimit rules out a healthy off-axis gamma-ray burst, and places constraints on\nthe pre-explosion mass loss. The data can be consistently explained by a\n$\\gtrsim10\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ stripped progenitor exploding with $\\sim\n10^{51}\\,$erg kinetic energy, forming a magnetar with a spin-down timescale of\n$\\sim20$ days (thus avoiding a gamma-ray burst) that reheats the ejecta and\ndrives ionization fronts. The most likely alternative scenario -- interaction\nwith $\\sim20\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ of dense, inhomogeneous circumstellar material --\ncan be tested with continuing radio follow-up.\n", "  Levitated diamond nanocrystals with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in high\nvacuum have been proposed as a unique system for experiments in fundamental\nquantum mechanics, including the generation of large quantum superposition\nstates and tests of quantum gravity. This system promises extreme isolation\nfrom its environment while providing quantum control and sensing through the NV\ncentre spin. While optical trapping has been the most explored method of\nlevitation, recent results indicate that excessive optical heating of the\nnanodiamonds under vacuum may make the method impractical with currently\navailable materials. Here, we study an alternative magneto-gravitational trap\nfor diamagnetic particles, such as diamond nanocrystals, with stable levitation\nfrom atmospheric pressure to high vacuum. Magnetic field gradients from\npermanent magnets confine the particle in two dimensions, while confinement in\nthe third dimension is gravitational. We demonstrate that feedback cooling of\nthe centre-of-mass motion of a trapped nanodiamond cluster results in cooling\nof one degree of freedom to less than 1 K.\n", "  We propose and analyse a feasible experimental scheme for a quantum force\nsensor based on the elimination of back-action noise through coherent quantum\nnoise cancellation (CQNC) in a hybrid atom-cavity optomechanical setup assisted\nwith squeezed vacuum injection. The force detector, which allows for a\ncontinuous, broad-band detection of weak forces well below the standard quantum\nlimit (SQL), is formed by a single optical cavity simultaneously coupled to a\nmechanical oscillator and to an ensemble of ultracold atoms. The latter acts as\na negative-mass oscillator so that atomic noise cancels exactly the back-action\nnoise from the mechanical oscillator due to destructive quantum interference.\nSqueezed vacuum injection enforces this cancellation and allows to reach\nsub-SQL sensitivity in a very wide frequency band, and at much lower input\nlaser powers.\n", "  The hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) exhibits long minority-carrier\nlifetimes and diffusion lengths. We show that slow recombination originates\nfrom a spin-split indirect-gap. Large internal electric fields act on\nspin-orbit-coupled band extrema, shifting band-edges to inequivalent\nwavevectors, making the fundamental gap indirect. From a description of\nphotoluminescence within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW)\napproximation for MAPI, CdTe and GaAs, we predict carrier lifetime as a\nfunction of light intensity and temperature. At operating conditions we find\nradiative recombination in MAPI is reduced by a factor of more than 350\ncompared to direct gap behavior. The indirect gap is retained with dynamic\ndisorder.\n", "  With the aim of exploring the fast evolutionary path from the blue cloud of\nstar-forming galaxies to the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the local\nuniverse, we select a local advanced merging infrared luminous and\nultraluminous galaxy (adv-merger (U)LIRGs) sample and perform careful dust\nextinction corrections to investigate their positions in the SFR-$M_{\\ast}$,\nu-r and NUV-r color-mass diagrams. The sample consists of 89 (U)LIRGs at the\nlate merger stage, obtained from cross-correlating the IRAS Point Source\nCatalog Redshift Survey and 1 Jy ULIRGs samples with the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey DR7 database. Our results show that $74\\%\\pm 5\\%$ of adv-merger (U)LIRGs\nare localized above the $1\\, \\sigma$ line of the local star-forming galaxy main\nsequence. We also find that all adv-merger (U)LIRGs are more massive than and\nas blue as the blue cloud galaxies after corrections of Galactic and internal\ndust extinctions, with $95\\%\\pm 2\\%$ and $81\\%\\pm 4\\%$ of them outside the blue\ncloud on the u-r and NUV-r color-mass diagrams, respectively. These results,\ncombined with the short timescale for exhausting the molecular gas reservoir in\nadv-merger (U)LIRGs ($3\\times 10^{7}$ to $3\\times 10^{8}$ years), imply that\nthe adv-merger (U)LIRGs are likely at the starting point of the fast\nevolutionary track previously proposed by several groups. While the number\ndensity of adv-merger (U)LIRGs is only $\\sim 0.1\\%$ of the blue cloud\nstar-forming galaxies in the local universe, this evolutionary track may play a\nmore important role at high redshift.\n", "  Motivated by the various indications that holographic superfluid is BCS like\nat the standard quantization but BEC like at the alternative quantization, we\nhave implemented the alternative quantization in the dynamical holographic\nsuperfluid for the first time. With this accomplishment, we further initiate\nthe detailed investigation of quantum turbulence in finite temperature BEC by a\nlong time stable numerical simulation of bulk dynamics, which includes the two\nbody decay of vortex number caused by vortex pair annihilation, the onset of\nsuperfluid turbulence signaled by Kolmogorov scaling law, and a direct energy\ncascade demonstrated by injecting energy to the turbulent superfluid. All of\nthese results share the same patterns as the holographic superfluid at the\nstandard quantization, thus suggest that these should be universal features for\nquantum turbulence at temperatures order of the critical temperature.\n", "  It is general wisdom that the pair potential of charged colloids in a liquid\nmay be closely approximated by a Yukawa interaction, as predicted by the\nclassical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. We experimentally\ndetermine the effective forces in a binary mixture of like-charged particles,\nof species 1 and 2, with blinking optical tweezers. The measured forces are\nconsistent with a Yukawa pair potential but the (12) cross-interaction is not\nequal to the geometric mean of the (11) and (22) like-interactions, as expected\nfrom DLVO. The deviation is a function of the electrostatic screening length\nand the size ratio, with the cross-interaction measured being consistently\nweaker than DLVO predictions. The corresponding non-additivity parameter is\nnegative and grows in magnitude with increased size asymmetry.\n", "  Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of frequency metrology. Both the\ninstability and systematic uncertainty of these clocks have been reported to be\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than the best microwave clocks. For this\nreason, a redefinition of the SI second based on optical clocks seems possible\nin the near future. However, the operation of optical lattice clocks has not\nyet reached the reliability that microwave clocks have achieved so far. In this\npaper, we report on the operation of a strontium optical lattice clock that\nspans several weeks, with more than 80% uptime. We make use of this long\nintegration time to demonstrate a reproducible measurement of frequency ratios\nbetween the strontium clock transition and microwave Cs primary and Rb\nsecondary frequency standards.\n", "  We study a spin pump on a two-leg ladder chain of the Rice--Mele model. To\ncharacterize the spin pump, we propose the Chern number for the many-body\nground state of the entanglement Hamiltonian, which is referred to as the\nentanglement Chern number. We show that this model has two phases distinguished\nby the entanglement Chern numbers. These two phases can be experimentally\nverified in cold atoms.\n", "  Phase-space distributions are widely applied in quantum optics to access the\nnonclassical features of radiations fields. In particular, the inability to\ninterpret the Glauber-Sudarshan distribution in terms of a classical\nprobability density is the fundamental benchmark for quantum light. However,\nthis phase-space distribution cannot be directly reconstructed for arbitrary\nstates, because of its singular behavior. In this work, we perform a\ncharacterization of the Glauber-Sudarshan representation in terms of\ndistribution theory. We address important features of such distributions: (i)\nthe maximal degree of their singularities is studied, (ii) the ambiguity of\nrepresentation is shown, and (iii) their dual space for nonclassicality tests\nis specified. In this view, we reconsider the methods for regularizing the\nGlauber-Sudarshan distribution for verifying its nonclassicality. This\ntreatment is supported with comprehensive examples and counterexamples.\n", "  Random tessellations of the space represent a class of prototype models of\nheterogeneous media, which are central in several applications in physics,\nengineering and life sciences. In this work, we investigate the statistical\nproperties of $d$-dimensional isotropic Poisson geometries by resorting to\nMonte Carlo simulation, with special emphasis on the case $d=3$. We first\nanalyse the behaviour of the key features of these stochastic geometries as a\nfunction of the dimension $d$ and the linear size $L$ of the domain. Then, we\nconsider the case of Poisson binary mixtures, where the polyhedra are assigned\ntwo `labels' with complementary probabilities. For this latter class of random\ngeometries, we numerically characterize the percolation threshold, the strength\nof the percolating cluster and the average cluster size.\n", "  Quantum features of correlated optical modes define a major aspect of the\nnonclassicality in quantized radiation fields. However, the phase-sensitive\ndetection of a two-mode light field is restricted to interferometric setups and\nlocal intensity measurements. Even the full reconstruction of the quantum state\nof a single radiation mode relies on such detection layouts and the preparation\nof a well-defined reference light field. In this work, we establish the notion\nof the essential quantum correlations of two-mode light fields. It refers to\nthose quantum correlations which are measurable by a given device, i.e., the\naccessible part of a nonclassical Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space distribution,\nwhich does not depend on a global phase. Assuming a simple four-port\ninterferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, we derive the\nreconstruction method and nonclassicality criteria based on the\nLaplace-transformed moment-generating function of the essential\nquasiprobability. With this technique, we demonstrate that the essential\nquantum correlations of a polarization tomography scheme are observable even if\nthe detectors are imperfect and cannot truly resolve the photon statistics.\n", "  We demonstrate that muon tomography can be used to precisely measure the\nproperties of various materials. The materials which have been considered have\nbeen extracted from an experimental blast furnace, including carbon (coke) and\niron oxides, for which measurements of the linear scattering density relative\nto the mass density have been performed with an absolute precision of 10%. We\nreport the procedures that are used in order to obtain such precision, and a\ndiscussion is presented to address the expected performance of the technique\nwhen applied to heavier materials. The results we obtain do not depend on the\nspecific type of material considered and therefore they can be extended to any\napplication.\n", "  LHC results do not confirm conventional natural solutions to the Higgs mass\nhierarchy problem, motivating alternative interpretations where a\nhierarchically small weak scale is generated from a dimension-less quantum\ndynamics. We propose weakly and strongly-coupled models where the field that\nbreaks classical scale invariance giving mass to itself and to the Higgs is\nidentified with a possible new resonance within the LHC reach. As an example,\nwe identify such resonance with the 750 GeV diphoton excess recently reported\nby ATLAS and CMS. Such models can be extrapolated up to the Planck scale,\nprovide Dark Matter candidates and eliminate the SM vacuum instability.\n", "  We recently performed experiments on the transfer of photon spin to electron\norbital angular momentum. For an interpretation of the experimental results we\nused a classical electrodynamic model of the photon as a propagating\nelectromagnetic solitary wave which is developed in detail here. A linearly\npolarized monochromatic photon is considered as a propagating solitary\nelectromagnetic wave of finite energy hf which carries an angular momentum\nh/2pi with the frequency f and Plancks constant h. This model has, apart from\nbeing a tool for an interpretation of our experimental results, far reaching\nconsequences of fundamental relevance and guides us to an outline to a unified\nquantum theory of electromagnetism and gravitation including an explanation of\nthe electrodynamic origin of the quantized charge of an electron.\n", "  We report the detection of the most luminous high-redshift Lyman Alpha\nEmitting galaxy (LAE) yet seen, with log L(Ly alpha) = 43.9 ergs/s. The galaxy\n-- COSMOS Lyman alpha 1, or COLA1 -- was detected in a search for\nultra-luminous LAEs with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope. It was\nconfirmed to lie at z = 6.593 based on a Lyman alpha line detection obtained\nfrom followup spectroscopy with the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck2. COLA1 is the\nfirst very high-redshift LAE to show a multi-component Lyman alpha line profile\nwith a blue wing, which suggests that it could lie in a highly ionized region\nof the intergalactic medium and could have significant infall. If this\ninterpretation is correct, then ultra-luminous LAEs like COLA1 offer a unique\nopportunity to determine the properties of the HII regions around these\ngalaxies which will help in understanding the ionization of the z ~ 7\nintergalactic medium.\n", "  We investigate lensless endoscopy using coherent beam combining and aperiodic\nmulticore fibers (MCF). We show that diffracted orders, inherent to MCF with\nperiodically arranged cores, dramatically reduce the field of view (FoV) and\nthat randomness in MCF core positions can increase the FoV up to the\ndiffraction limit set by a single fiber core, while maintaining MCF\nexperimental feasibility. We demonstrate experimentally pixelation-free\nlensless endoscopy imaging over a 120 micron FoV with an aperiodic MCF designed\nwith widely spaced cores. We show that this system is suitable to perform beam\nscanning imaging by simply applying a tilt to the proximal wavefront.\n", "  We report in-situ Raman scattering studies of electrochemically top gated\nVO$_2$ thin film to address metal-insulator transition (MIT) under gating. The\nroom temperature monoclinic insulating phase goes to metallic state at a gate\nvoltage of 2.6 V. However, the number of Raman modes do not change with\nelectrolyte gating showing that the metallic phase is still monoclinic. The\nhigh frequency Raman mode A$_g$(7) near 616 cm$^{-1}$ ascribed to V-O vibration\nof bond length 2.06 \\AA~ in VO$_6$ octahedra hardens with increasing gate\nvoltage and the B$_g$(3) mode near 654 cm$^{-1}$ softens. This shows that the\ndistortion of the VO$_6$ octahedra in the monoclinic phase decreases with\ngating. The time dependent Raman data at fixed gate voltages of 1 V (for 50\nminute, showing enhancement of conductivity by a factor of 50) and 2 V (for 130\nminute, showing further increase in conductivity by a factor of 5) show similar\nchanges in high frequency Raman modes A$_g$(7) and B$_g$(3) as observed in\ngating. This slow change in conductance together with Raman frequency changes\nshow that the governing mechanism for metalization is more likely to the\ndiffusion controlled oxygen vacancy formation due to the applied electric\nfield.\n", "  Strontium titanate (SrTiO3, STO) is a critically important material for the\nstudy of emergent electronic phases in complex oxides, as well as for the\ndevelopment of applications based on their heterostructures. Despite the large\nbody of knowledge on STO, there are still many uncertainties regarding the role\nof defects in the properties of STO, including their influence on\nferroelectricity in bulk STO and ferromagnetism in STO-based heterostructures.\nWe present a detailed analysis of the decay of persistent photoconductivity in\nSTO single crystals with defect concentrations that are relatively low but\nsignificantly affect their electronic properties. The results show that\nphoto-activated electron transport cannot be described by a superposition of\nthe properties due to independent point defects as current models suggest but\nis, instead, governed by defect complexes that interact through dynamic\ncorrelations. These results emphasize the importance of defect correlations for\nactivated electronic transport properties of semiconducting and insulating\nperovskite oxides.\n", "  Recently, Wang $et$ $al.$ have reported the observation of \"unconventional\nsuperconductivity\" in the Weyl semimetal TaAs [arXiv:1607.00513]. The authors\nhave written \"\\textit{A conductance plateau and sharp double dips are observed\nin the point contact spectra, indicating p-wave like unconventional\nsuperconductivity. Furthermore, the zero bias conductance peak in low\ntemperature regime is detected, suggesting potentially the existence of\nMajorana zero modes. The experimentally observed tunneling spectra can be\ninterpreted with a novel mirror-symmetry protected topological superconductor\ninduced in TaAs, which can exhibit zero bias and double finite bias peaks, and\ndouble conductance dips in the measurements}.\" In this comment we show that for\na superconducting point contact, the features like a zero-bias conductance\npeak, a plateau and single or multiple conductance dips might arise due to\nsimple contact-heating related effects. Such features are routinely observed in\npoint contacts involving a wide variety of superconductors when the experiments\nare not performed in the right regime of mesoscopic transport. We also show\nthat the data presented by Wang $et$ $al.$ in a single transport regime of\npoint contact do not confirm tip induced superconductivity (TISC). Even if it\nis assumed that Wang $et$ $al.$ achieved TISC on TaAs, all the spectra that\nthey have reported show striking similarities with the type of spectra expected\nin thermal regime of transport. Such data cannot be used for extracting any\nspectroscopic information and based on such data any discussion on \"p-wave\"\nsuperconductivity or the emergence of Majorana modes should be considered\ninvalid. This version (v2) also includes a brief discussion on the response of\nWang $et$ $al.$ to the first version (v1) of this comment. Correct ballistic\nregime data on TaAs point contacts can be found in arXiv:1607.05131 (2016).\n", "  Comb geometry, constituted of a backbone and fingers, is one of the most\nsimple paradigm of a two dimensional structure, where anomalous diffusion can\nbe realized in the framework of Markov processes. However, the intrinsic\nproperties of the structure can destroy this Markovian transport. These effects\ncan be described by the memory and spatial kernels. In particular, the fractal\nstructure of the fingers, which is controlled by the spatial kernel in both the\nreal and the Fourier spaces, leads to the L\\'evy processes (L\\'evy flights) and\nsuperdiffusion. This generalization of the fractional diffusion is described by\nthe Riesz space fractional derivative. In the framework of this generalized\nfractal comb model, L\\'evy processes are considered, and exact solutions for\nthe probability distribution functions are obtained in terms of the Fox\n$H$-function for a variety of the memory kernels, and the rate of the\nsuperdiffusive spreading is studied by calculating the fractional moments. For\na special form of the memory kernels, we also observed a competition between\nlong rests and long jumps. Finally, we considered the fractional structure of\nthe fingers controlled by a Weierstrass function, which leads to the power-law\nkernel in the Fourier space. It is a special case, when the second moment\nexists for superdiffusion in this competition between long rests and long\njumps.\n", "  A $^{52}$Cr$(p,t)$$^{50}$Cr two-neutron pickup reaction was performed using\nthe Q3D magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium in Garching,\nGermany. Excited states in $^{50}$Cr were observed up to an excitation energy\nof 5.3 MeV. Despite significantly increased sensitivity and resolution over\nprevious work, no evidence of the previously assigned first excited $0^+$ state\nwas found. As a result, the $0^+_2$ state is reassigned at an excitation energy\nof $E_x=3895.0(5)$ keV in $^{50}$Cr. This reassignment directly impacts direct\nsearches for a non-analogue Fermi $\\beta^+$ decay branch in $^{50}$Mn. These\nresults also show better systematic agreement with the theoretical predictions\nfor the $0^+$ state spectrum in $^{50}$Cr using the same formalism as the\nisospin-symmetry-breaking correction calculations for superallowed nuclei. The\nexperimental data are also compared to $ab$-$initio$ shell-model predictions\nusing the IM-SRG formalism based on $NN$ and $3N$ forces from chiral-EFT in the\n$pf$-shell for the first time.\n", "  A growing class of ultra-high energy neutrino (UHE-nu) observatories based on\nthe Askaryan effect and Antarctic ice is able to search for Lorentz invariance\nviolation (LIV). The ARA, ARIANNA, ANITA and EVA collaborations have the power\nto constrain the Standard Model Extension (SME) by measuring the flux and\nenergy distribution of neutrinos created through the GZK process. The future\nexpansion of ARA, at the South Pole, pushes the discovery potential further.\n", "  We present a new approach to dielectric metasurface design that relies on a\nsingle resonator per unit cell and produces robust, high quality-factor Fano\nresonances. Our approach utilizes symmetry breaking of highly symmetric\nresonator geoemetries, such as cubes, to induce couplings between the otherwise\northogonal resonator modes. In particular, we design perturbations that couple\n\"bright\" dipole modes to \"dark\" dipole modes whose radiative decay is\nsuppressed by local field effects in the array. Our approach is widely scalable\nfrom the near-infrared to radio frequencies. We first unravel the Fano\nresonance behavior through numerical simulations of a germanium resonator-based\nmetasurface that achieved a quality-factor of ~1300 at ~10.8 um. Then, we\npresent two experimental demonstrations operating in the near-infrared (~1 um):\na silicon-based implementation that achieved a quality-factor of ~350; and a\ngallium arsenide-based structure that achieves a quality-factor of ~600 - the\nhighest near-infrared quality-factor experimentally demonstrated to date with\nthis kind of metasurfaces. Importantly, large electromagnetic field\nenhancements appear within the resonators at the Fano resonant frequencies. We\nenvision that combining high-quality factor, high field enhancement resonances\nwith nonlinear and active/gain materials such as gallium arsenide will lead to\nnew classes of active optical devices.\n", "  The origin of the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background permeating throughout\nthe Universe remains a mystery forty years after its discovery. The\nextrapolated population of blazars can account for only half of the background\nradiation at the energy range of ~ 0.1-10 GeV. Here we show that quasar-driven\noutflows generate relativistic protons that produce the missing component of\nthe extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background and naturally match its spectral\nfingerprint, with a generic break above ~ 1 GeV. The associated $\\gamma$-ray\nsources are too faint to be detected individually, explaining why they had not\nbeen identified so far. However, future radio observations may image their\nshock fronts directly. Our best fit to the Fermi-LAT observations of\nextragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background spectrum provides constraints on the\noutflow parameters that agree with observations of these outflows and\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  We examine the dark matter content of satellite galaxies in Lambda-CDM\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group from the APOSTLE\nproject. We find excellent agreement between simulation results and estimates\nfor the 9 brightest Galactic dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) derived from their\nstellar velocity dispersions and half-light radii. Tidal stripping plays an\nimportant role by gradually removing dark matter from the outside in, affecting\nin particular fainter satellites and systems of larger-than-average size for\ntheir luminosity. Our models suggest that tides have significantly reduced the\ndark matter content of Can Ven I, Sextans, Carina, and Fornax, a prediction\nthat may be tested by comparing them with field galaxies of matching luminosity\nand size. Uncertainties in observational estimates of the dark matter content\nof individual dwarfs have been underestimated in the past, at times\nsubstantially. We use our improved estimates to revisit the `too-big-to-fail'\nproblem highlighted in earlier N-body work. We reinforce and extend our\nprevious conclusion that the APOSTLE simulations show no sign of this problem.\nThe resolution does not require `cores' in the dark mass profiles, but, rather,\nrelies on revising assumptions and uncertainties in the interpretation of\nobservational data and accounting for `baryon effects' in the theoretical\nmodelling.\n", "  The vast majority of pulsars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\ndisplay exponentially cutoff spectra with cutoffs falling in a narrow band\naround a few GeV. Early spectral modelling predicted spectral cutoffs at\nenergies of up to 100 GeV, assuming curvature radiation. It was therefore not\nexpected that pulsars would be visible in the very-high energy (VHE) regime\n(>100 GeV). The VERITAS announcement of the detection of pulsed emission from\nthe Crab pulsar at energies up to 400 GeV (and now up to 1.5 TeV as detected by\nMAGIC) therefore raised important questions about our understanding of the\nelectrodynamics and local environment of pulsars. H.E.S.S. has now detected\npulsed emission from the Vela pulsar down to tens of GeV, making this the\nsecond pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. Deep upper limits\nhave also been obtained by VERITAS and MAGIC for the Geminga pulsar. We will\nreview the latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview of\nthe latest observations, refinements, and extensions to radiation models and\nmagnetic field structures, and the implementation of new radiation mechanisms.\nThis will assist us in understanding the VHE emission detected from the Crab\npulsar, and predicting the level of VHE emission expected from other pulsars,\nwhich is very important for the upcoming CTA.\n", "  We have used systematic, sustained visual observations from the AAVSO\nInternational Database, and the AAVSO time-series analysis package VSTAR to\nstudy the unexplained \"long secondary periods\" (LSPs) in 27 pulsating red\ngiants. In our sample, the LSPs range from 479 to 2967 days, and are on average\n8.1 +/- 1.3 times the pulsation period. There is no evidence for more than one\nLSP in each star. In stars with both the fundamental and first overtone radial\nperiod present, the LSP is more often about 10 times the latter. The visual\namplitudes of the LSPs are typically 0.1 magnitude and do not correlate with\nthe LSP. The phase curves tend to be sinusoidal, but at least two are sawtooth.\nThe LSPs are stable, within their errors, over the timespan of our data, which\nis typically 25,000 days. The amplitudes, however, vary by up to a factor of\ntwo or more on a timescale of roughly 20-30 LSPs. There is no obvious\ndifference between the behavior of the carbon (C) stars and the normal oxygen\n(M) stars. Previous multicolor photoelectric observations showed that the LSP\ncolor variations are similar to those of the pulsation period, and of the LSPs\nin the Magellanic Clouds, and not like those of eclipsing stars. We note that\nthe LSPs are similar to the estimated rotation periods of the stars, though the\nlatter have large uncertainties. This suggests that the LSP phenomenon may be a\nform of modulated rotational variability.\n", "  We have shown that a Lagrangian for a torus surface can yield second order\nnonlinear differential equations using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. It is\nseen that these second order nonlinear differential equations can be\ntransformed into the nonlinear quadratic and Mathews-Lakshmanan equations using\nthe position dependent mass approach developed by Mustafa for the classical\nsystems. Then, we have applied the quantization procedure to the nonlinear\nquadratic and Mathews-Lakshmanan equations and found their exact solutions.\n", "  Stellar signals are the main limitation for precise radial-velocity (RV)\nmeasurements. These signals arise from the photosphere of the stars. The m/s\nperturbation created by these signals prevents the detection and mass\ncharacterization of small-mass planetary candidates such as Earth-twins.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to mitigate stellar signals in RV\nmeasurements. However, without precisely knowing the stellar and planetary\nsignals in real observations, it is extremely difficult to test the efficiency\nof these methods.\n  The goal of the RV fitting challenge is to generate simulated RV data\nincluding stellar and planetary signals and to perform a blind test within the\ncommunity to test the efficiency of the different methods proposed to recover\nplanetary signals despite stellar signals.\n  In this first paper, we describe the simulation used to model the\nmeasurements of the RV fitting challenge. Each simulated planetary system\nincludes the signals from instrumental noise, stellar oscillations,\ngranulation, supergranulation, stellar activity, and observed and simulated\nplanetary systems. In addition to RV variations, this simulation also models\nthe effects of instrumental noise and stellar signals on activity observables\nobtained by HARPS-type high-resolution spectrographs, that is, the calcium\nactivity index log(R'hk) and the bisector span and full width at half maximum\nof the cross-correlation function.\n  We publish the 15 systems used for the RV fitting challenge including the\ndetails about the planetary systems that were injected into each of them (data\navailable at CDS and here: https://rv-challenge.wikispaces.com.\n", "  In this paper, we present various schemes of cloaking an arbitrary objects\nvia anomalous localized resonance and provide their analysis in two and three\ndimensions. This is a way to cloak an object using negative index materials in\nwhich the cloaking device is independent of the object. As a result, we show\nthat in two dimensional quasistatic regime an annular plasmonic structure $-I$\ncloaks small but finite size objects near by. We also discuss its connections\nwith superlensing and cloaking using complementary media. In particular, we\nconfirm the possibility that a lens can act like a cloak and conversely. This\npossibility was raised about a decade ago in the literature.\n", "  Most of the massive states in superstring theory are expected to undergo mass\nrenormalization at one loop order. Typically these corrections should contain\nimaginary parts, indicating that the states are unstable against decay into\nlighter particles. However in such cases, direct computation of the\nrenormalized mass using superstring perturbation theory yields divergent\nresult. Previous approaches to this problem involve various analytic\ncontinuation techniques, or deforming the integral over the moduli space of the\ntorus with two punctures into the complexified moduli space near the boundary.\nIn this paper we use insights from string field theory to describe a different\napproach that gives manifestly finite result for the mass shift satisfying\nunitarity relations. The procedure is applicable to all states of\n(compactified) type II and heterotic string theories. We illustrate this by\ncomputing the one loop correction to the mass of the first massive state on the\nleading Regge trajectory in SO(32) heterotic string theory.\n", "  A discussion on the momentum evolution of an impurity interacting via a\nfinite delta potential repulsion with a non-interacting fermionic background\ngas is presented. It has recently been shown that the momentum evolution of\nthis system displays two interesting features, namely a non-zero thermalised\nvalue and a long-lived quantum mechanical oscillation around this plateau named\n\"quantum flutter\" [Mathy, Zvonarev, Demler, Nat. Phys. 2012]. We discuss\nrevivals in the momentum of the impurity, which have been seen before but not\nyet thoroughly investigated. Subsequently it is shown the quantum flutter and\nrevivals are caused by disjoint sets of eigenstate transitions, and this fact\nis used to interpret some of their aspects. This attribution of momentum\nfeatures to different eigenstate subsets allows quantitative reproduction of\nthese features with much less computational expense than has so far been\npossible. Finally some results on the distribution of the momentum of\neigenstates and their relation to the momentum of the impurity once the system\nhas been thermalised are presented along with a discussion on the time averaged\ninfinite time value of the momentum and its comparison to different eigenstate\nsubsets.\n", "  Single-file diffusion is a ubiquitous physical process exploited by living\nand synthetic systems to exchange molecules with their environment. It is\nparamount quantifying the escape time needed for single files of particles to\nexit from constraining synthetic channels and biological pores. This quantity\ndepends on complex cooperative effects, whose predominance can only be\nestablished through a strict comparison between theory and experiments. By\nusing colloidal particles, optical manipulation, microfluidics, digital\nmicroscopy and theoretical analysis we uncover the self-similar character of\nthe escape process and provide closed-formula evaluations of the escape time.\nWe find that the escape time scales inversely with the diffusion coefficient of\nthe last particle to leave the channel. Importantly, we find that at the\ninvestigated {\\bf microscale}, bias forces as tiny as $10^{-15}\\;{\\rm N}$\ndetermine the magnitude of the escape time by drastically reducing\ninterparticle collisions. Our findings provide crucial guidelines to optimize\nthe design of micro- and nano-devices for a variety of applications including\ndrug delivery, particle filtering and transport in geometrical constrictions.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the reduced density trajectory, phi-mapping\ntopological current theory and Ginzberg-Landau model to study the current of\nthe coherent state. We give the new expression of the current of the coherent\nstate. Based on this expression, the symmetry of the coherence is studied. We\nfind that the current of the coherent state corresponds to the supercurrent of\ntwo-condensate system. The partial wave functions of the coherence carry new\ncharges and their interaction is mediated by new U(1) gauge potential.\n", "  Assuming QCD exhibits an interacting fixed-point behaviour in the ultraviolet\nregime, I argue that the axion can be substantially heavier than in the\nconventional case of asymptotically free QCD due to the enhanced contribution\nof small size instantons to its mass.\n", "  Motivated by recent results by lattice analysis, we assume that the spin-1\nmesons of $\\left( \\rho, \\omega, a_1, \\rho', \\omega', b_1, f_1, h_1\\right)$ make\na representation of $\\mathbf{16}$ of U(4) emergent symmetry in two-flavor QCD\nwhen the chiral symmetry is not broken. We study the decay properties of the\nspin-1 mesons by using a chiral model with an SU(4)$\\times$U(1) hidden local\nsymmetry. We first show that, since the SU(4) symmetry is spontaneously broken\ntogether with the chiral symmetry, each coupling of the interaction among one\npion and two spin-1 mesons is proportional to the mass difference of the\nrelevant spin-1 mesons similarly to the Goldberger-Treiman relation. In\naddition, some of one-pion couplings are related with each other by the SU(4)\nsymmetry. We further show that there is a relation among the mass of $\\rho'$\nmeson, the $\\rho'\\pi\\pi$ coupling and the $\\rho'$-photon mixing strength as\nwell as the Kawarabayashi-Suzuki-Riazuddin-Fayyazuddin relation for the $\\rho$\nmeson. From the relations, we give numerical predictions such as ratios of the\nspin-1 meson decay widths, which are compared with future experiments for\ntesting the existence of the U(4) emergent symmetry.\n", "  We report the graded electronic band gap along the axis of individual\nheterostructured WZ-ZB InAs/InSb0.12As0.88 nanowires. Resonance Raman imaging\nhas been exploited to map the axial variation in the second excitation gap\nenergy (E1) at the high symmetry point (L point) of the Brillouin zone. We\nrelate the origin of the observed evolution of the gap energy to the fine\ntuning of the alloy composition from the tip towards the interface of the\nnanowire. The electronic band structures of InAs, InSb and InSbxAs1-x alloy\nsystems at x=0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 0.875, using all electron density\nfunctional theory code Wien2k, are reported. The measured band gap along the\naxis of the InAs/InSb0.12As0.88 nanowire is correlated with the calculated gap\nenergy at the A point and the L point of the Brillouin zone for InAs and\nInSb0.125As0.875, respectively. We draw a one-to-one correspondence between the\nvariation of the E1 gap and the fundamental E0 gap in the calculated electronic\nband structure and propose the graded fundamental gap energy across the axis of\nthe nanowire.\n", "  We use electronic Raman scattering to study the low-energy excitations in\nBaFe$_2$(As$_{0.5}$P$_{0.5}$)$_2$ ($T_c \\approx 16$ K) samples. In addition to\na superconducting pair breaking peak (2$\\Delta=6.7$ meV) in the A$_{1g}$\nchannel with a linear tail towards zero energy, suggesting a nodal gap\nstructure, we detect spectral features associated to Pomeranchuk oscillations\nin the A$_{1g}$, B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels. We argue that the small Fermi\nenergy of the system is an essential condition for these Pomeranchuk\noscillations to be underdamped. The Pomeranchuk oscillations have the same\nfrequencies in the B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels, which we explain by the\nmixing of these symmetries resulting from the removal of the $\\sigma_v$ and\n$\\sigma_v$ symmetry planes due to a large As/P disorder. Interestingly, we show\nthat the temperature at which the peaks corresponding to the Pomeranchuk\noscillations get underdamped is consistent with the non-Fermi liquid to Femi\nliquid crossover determined by transport, suggesting that the Pomeranchuk\ninstability plays an important role in the low-energy physics of the Fe-based\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We introduce an algebraic measure of correlations in bipartite quantum\nsystems. The proposed quantity, called maximal mutual correlation, provides the\ninformation how much a given state differs from the product state of its\nmarginals. In contrast to the entanglement or quantum discord, maximal mutual\ncorrelation can be non - zero for some classically correlated quantum states.\n", "  The use of hot electrons generated from the decay of surface plasmons is a\nnew paradigm to increase the conversion yield in solar energy technologies.\nTitanium nitride (TiN) is an emerging plasmonic ceramic that offers\ncompatibility with CMOS technology, corrosion resistance, as well as mechanical\nstrength and durability thus outperforming noble metals (i.e., Au, Ag) in terms\nof cost, mechanical, chemical and thermal stability. Here, we show that\nplasmonic TiN nanoparticles produce 25% higher photocurrent enhancement than Au\nnanoparticles decorated on TiO2 nanowires for photoelectrochemical water\nsplitting. Our results highlight that TiN offers superior performance in hot\ncarrier generation due to enhanced absorption efficiency, increased electron\nmean free path, and the ability to form an Ohmic junction with TiO2, thus\nenabling an extremely efficient electron collection not achievable with\nplasmonic Au nanoparticles. Our findings show that transition metal nitrides\nenable practical plasmonic devices with enhanced performance for solar energy\nconversion.\n", "  The Clementine Gnomon realized in 1702 by the astronomer Francesco Bianchini\n(1661-1729) upon the will of Pope Clement XI (1700-1721) in the Basilica of\nSanta Maria degli Angeli in Rome is fully reviewed about its scientific\nfunctions.\n", "  We study the ground-state entanglement in the quantum Ising model with\nnearest neighbor ferromagnetic coupling $J$ and find a sequential increase of\nentanglement depth with growing $J$. This entanglement avalanche starts with\ntwo-point entanglement, as measured by the concurrence, and continues via the\nthree-tangle and four-tangle, until finally, deep in the ferromagnetic phase\nfor $J=\\infty$, arriving at pure $\\ell$-partite (GHZ type) entanglement of all\n$\\ell$ spins. Comparison with the two, three, and four-point correlations\nreveals a similar sequence and shows strong ties to the above entanglement\nmeasures for small $J$. However, we also find a partial inversion of the\nhierarchy, where the four-point correlation exceeds the three- and two-point\ncorrelations, well before the critical point is reached. Qualitatively similar\nbehavior is also found for the Bose-Hubbard model, suggesting that this is a\ngeneral feature of a quantum phase transition. This should have far reaching\nconsequences for approximations starting from a mean-field limit.\n", "  The conditions that must be fulfilled by a certain physical system to apply\ngeometric quantization prescription on it are investigated. These terms are\nsought as mathematical requirements, which can be traced in an analysis of\nintegrable systems, from the perspective of both potential function and\nHamiltonian vector field. The answer is found in momentum map critical points.\nBasically, a certain disposal of points that allow a momentum map $C^*$\nisomorphism, of observables, with harmonic oscillator momentum map enforce\ngeometric quantization rules. Following the general theory, two newly presented\nexamples, which exhibits these properties, are quantified through geometric\nquantization prescription. The Lennard-Jones' type potential is one of the\nexamples, it is known as describing molecules in interaction. We end with a\nthird example that shows the local isomorphism of potentials do not induce\n$C^*$ isomorphism of observables.\n", "  We report a method that exploits a connection between quantum contextuality\nand graph theory to reveal any form of quantum contextuality in high-precision\nexperiments. We use this technique to identify a graph which corresponds to an\nextreme form of quantum contextuality unnoticed before and test it using\nhigh-dimensional quantum states encoded in the linear transverse momentum of\nsingle photons. Our results open the door to the experimental exploration of\nquantum contextuality in all its forms, including those needed for quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We study the Schr\\\"odinger equation on $\\R$ with a potential behaving as\n$x^{2l}$ at infinity, $l\\in[1,+\\infty)$ and with a small time quasiperiodic\nperturbation. We prove that, if the perturbation belongs to a class of\nunbounded symbols including smooth potentials and magnetic type terms with\ncontrolled growth at infinity, then the system is reducible.\n", "  Following an earlier study regarding Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell black holes in the\npresence of gravity's rainbow [S. H. Hendi and M. Faizal, Phys. Rev. D 92,\n044027 (2015)], in this paper, we will consider all constants as energy\ndependent ones. The geometrical and thermodynamical properties of this\ngeneralization are studied and the validation of the first law of\nthermodynamics is examined. Next, through the use of proportionality between\ncosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure, van der Waals-like behavior\nof these black holes in extended phase space is investigated. An interesting\ncritical behavior for sets of rainbow functions in this case is reported. Also,\nthe critical behavior of uncharged and charged solutions is analyzed and it is\nshown that the generalization to a charged case puts an energy dependent\nrestriction on values of different parameters.\n", "  An introduction to extended theories of gravity formulated in metric-affine\n(or Palatini) spaces is presented. Focusing on spherically symmetric\nconfigurations with electric fields, we will see that in these theories the\ncentral singularity present in General Relativity is generically replaced by a\nwormhole structure. The resulting space-time becomes geodesically complete and,\ntherefore, can be regarded as non-singular. We illustrate these properties\nconsidering two different models, namely, a quadratic $f(R)$ theory and a\nBorn-Infeld like gravity theory.\n", "  The study of magnetic correlations in dipolar-coupled nanomagnet systems with\nsynchrotron x-ray scattering provides a means to uncover emergent phenomena and\nexotic phases, in particular in systems with thermally active magnetic moments.\nFrom the diffuse signal of soft x-ray resonant magnetic scattering, we have\nmeasured magnetic correlations in a highly dynamic artificial kagome spin ice\nwith sub-70-nm Permalloy nanomagnets. On comparing experimental scattering\npatterns with Monte Carlo simulations based on a needle-dipole model, we\nconclude that kagome ice I phase correlations exist in our experimental system\neven in the presence of moment fluctuations, which is analogous to bulk spin\nice and spin liquid behavior. In addition, we describe the emergence of\nquasi-pinch-points in the magnetic diffuse scattering in the kagome ice I\nphase. These quasi-pinch-points bear similarities to the fully developed pinch\npoints with singularities of a magnetic Coulomb phase, and continually evolve\ninto the latter on lowering the temperature. The possibility to measure\nmagnetic diffuse scattering with soft x rays opens the way to study magnetic\ncorrelations in a variety of nanomagnetic systems.\n", "  We present and study a novel class of one-dimensional Hilbert space\neigenfunction transforms that diagonalize analytic difference operators\nencoding the (reduced) two-particle relativistic hyperbolic Calogero-Moser\ndynamics. The scattering is described by reflection and transmission amplitudes\n$t$ and $r$ with function-theoretic features that are quite different from\nnonrelativistic amplitudes. The axiomatic Hilbert space analysis in the\nappendices is inspired by and applied to the attractive two-particle\nrelativistic Calogero-Moser dynamics for a sequence of special couplings.\nTogether with the scattering function $u$ of the repulsive case, this leads to\na triple of amplitudes $u, t, r$ satisfying the Yang-Baxter equations.\n", "  Pore-forming toxins (PFT) are cytolytic proteins belonging to the molecular\nwarfare apparatus of living organisms. The assembly of the functional\ntransmembrane pore requires several intermediate steps ranging from a\nwater-soluble monomeric species to the multimeric ensemble inserted in the cell\nmembrane. The non-lytic oligomeric intermediate known as prepore plays an\nessential role in the mechanism of insertion of the class of $\\beta$-PFT.\nHowever, in the class of $\\alpha$-PFT like the actinoporins produced by sea\nanemones, evidence of membrane-bound prepores is still lacking. We have\nemployed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) to identify, for the first time, a prepore species of the\nactinoporin fragaceatoxin C (FraC) bound to lipid vesicles. The size of the\nprepore coincides that of the functional pore, except for the transmembrane\nregion, which is absent in the prepore. Biochemical assays indicated that, in\nthe prepore species, the N-terminus is not inserted in the bilayer but exposed\nto the aqueous solution. Our study reveals the structure of the prepore complex\nin actinoporins, and highlights the role of structural intermediates for the\nformation of cytolytic pores by an $\\alpha$-PFT.\n", "  Researchers from Intel Corporation recently proposed \"Magneto-Electric Spin\nOrbit (MESO)\" logic as a new strategy for beyond-CMOS electronics [1]. The\nIntel researchers project that this concept has the potential to reduce the\nswitching energy per bit \"to near thermodynamic limits for GHz logic (100 kT\nswitching at 100 ps delay)\", i.e., to near 0.4 aJ. Here I point out that the\nswitching energy stated in ref. [1] is incorrect, because the paper neglects a\nlarge energy cost associated with Ohmic dissipation that is unavoidable within\nthe MESO scheme. Using optimistic parameters, the true minimum switching energy\nper bit within the MESO approach is at least 150 fJ, or more than 300,000 times\ngreater than the value stated in ref. [1]. Given this large energy cost, the\nMESO concept is not a viable strategy for beyond-CMOS logic.\n", "  Advancements in information and communication technologies have enhanced our\npossibilities to communicate worldwide, eliminating borders and making it\npossible to interact with people coming from other cultures like never happened\nbefore. Such powerful tools have brought us to reconsider our concept of\nprivacy and social involvement in order to make them fit into this wider\nenvironment. It is possible to claim that the ICT revolution is changing our\nworld and is having a core role as a mediating factor for social movements\n(e.g., Arab spring) and political decisions (e.g., Brexit), shaping the world\nin a faster and shared brand new way. It is then interesting to explore how the\nperception of this brand new environment (in terms of social engagement,\nprivacy perception and sense of belonging to a community) differs even in\nsimilar cultures separated by recent historical reasons, as for example in\nItalian and Turkish cultures.\n", "  In the seminal essay, \"On the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in\nthe physical sciences,\" physicist Eugene Wigner poses a fundamental\nphilosophical question concerning the relationship between a physical system\nand our capacity to model its behavior with the symbolic language of\nmathematics. In this essay, I examine an ambitious 16th and 17th-century\nintellectual agenda from the perspective of Wigner's question, namely, what\nhistorian Paolo Rossi calls \"the quest to create a universal language.\" While\nmany elite thinkers pursued related ideas, the most inspiring and forceful was\nGottfried Leibniz's effort to create a \"universal calculus,\" a pictorial\nlanguage which would transparently represent the entirety of human knowledge,\nas well as an associated symbolic calculus with which to model the behavior of\nphysical systems and derive new truths. I suggest that a deeper understanding\nof why the efforts of Leibniz and others failed could shed light on Wigner's\noriginal question. I argue that the notion of reductionism is crucial to\ncharacterizing the failure of Leibniz's agenda, but that a decisive argument\nfor the why the promises of this effort did not materialize is still lacking.\n", "  The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of\nsocial networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral\nsciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional,\nor life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this\npaper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of\ninteraction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing\nplatform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,\nface-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt\nto isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively\nhomogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the\nlife course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data\nreveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,\ndistributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,\nsome patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender\npreference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity\ncontext, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower\n(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.\nThese findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of\ngender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and\nmobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to\ndifferences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of\nsociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.\n", "  Nanoindentation is an effective way of finding mechanical properties at\nnanoscale. They are especially useful for thin films where elimination of the\nsubstrate effect is required. The mechanism is based upon depth sensing\nindentation based on Oliver and Pharr modeling. Nanoindentation was used to\nevaluate the nanomechanical and fractographic properties of hard coatings\ndeposited by magnetron sputtering. Radial and lateral cracks accompanied by\ndelamination of the coatings were observed during the indentation tests. A\nnovel phenomenon of stress induced crystallization was observed in case of the\nCNx films which resulted in crack deflection. Indentations at micro scale using\nVickers Indenter were also done and the cracking phenomena were analyzed.\n", "  Two coupled-cavity systems, or \"photonic dimers\", are efficient test-beds for\nboth fundamental optics -the realization of quantum correlated states,\nJosephson physics, and so forth-, and applications such as optical flip-flop\nmemories. In this work we report on the first observation of nonlinear mode\ninteraction in a photonic dimer formed by two semiconductor photonic crystal\ncoupled nanolasers. For this, we investigate energy transfer between hybrid\nmodes, which manifests as a switching from the blue-detuned (bonding) to the\nred-detuned (anti-bonding) modes. An mean-field model allows us to explain this\nphenomenon as stimulated scattering due to carrier population oscillations in\nthe cavities at the Rabi frequency. Such asymmetrical mode interaction is\nuniversal in semiconductor laser photonic molecules, and unveils the origin of\ncross-correlation dips in the statistics of mode fluctuations.\n", "  Four rubidium fountains at the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) have been in\noperation for 4.5 years. Each fountain has demonstrated periods of stability\nmarked by Total or Theo deviation below 10^-16. Occasional frequency changes,\non order of 1.5 times per year per fountain, introduce deviations from\nwhite-frequency noise behavior. Averaged together, the four fountains form an\nensemble with a white-frequency noise level of 10^-13 and excellent long-term\nstability as compared to the primary frequency standards contributing to TAI.\nProgress on using the clocks at USNO for improving limits on coupling of\nfundamental constants to gravity by measuring the universality of the\ngravitational redshift for different types of clocks is discussed.\n", "  We present how to further the search for Lorentz and CPT violation in the\ntop-quark sector after the first measurement in this sector by D0. We compute\nthe Lorentz-violating matrix element for top pair production via gluon fusion,\nwhich allows a similar but more precise measurement at the LHC. For CPT\nviolation, we analyze single-top production, derive the modified matrix\nelements, and predict possible signals.\n", "  Equilibrium is a central concept of statistical mechanics. In previous work\nwe introduced the notions of a Boltzmannian alpha-epsilon-equilibrium and a\nBoltzmannian gamma-varepsilon-equilibrium (Werndl and Frigg 2015a, 2015b). This\nwas done in a deterministic context. We now consider systems with a stochastic\nmicro-dynamics and transfer these notions from the deterministic to the\nstochastic context. We then prove stochastic equivalents of the Dominance\nTheorem and the Prevalence Theorem. This establishes that also in stochastic\nsystems equilibrium macro-regions are large in requisite sense.\n", "  Structure-property relationships is a key materials science concept that\nenables the design of new materials. In the case of materials for application\nin radiation environments, correlating radiation tolerance with fundamental\nstructural features of a material enables materials discovery. Here, we use a\nmachine learning model to examine the factors that govern amorphization\nresistance in the complex oxide pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$). We examine the\nfidelity of predictions based on cation radii and electronegativities, the\noxygen positional parameter, and the energetics of disordering and amorphizing\nthe material. No one factor alone adequately predicts amorphization resistance.\nWe find that, when multiple families of pyrochlores (with different B cations)\nare considered, radii and electronegativities provide the best prediction but\nwhen the machine learning model is restricted to only the $B$=Ti pyrochlores,\nthe energetics of disordering and amorphization are optimal. This work provides\nnew insight into the factors that govern the amorphization susceptibility and\nhighlights the ability of machine learning approaches to generate that insight.\n", "  Coulomb breakup is used to infer radiative-capture cross sections at\nastrophysical energies. We test theoretically the accuracy of this indirect\ntechnique in the particular case of 15C, for which both the Coulomb breakup to\n^{14}C+n and the radiative capture 14C(n,{\\gamma})15C have been measured. We\nanalyse the dependance of Coulomb-breakup calculations on the projectile\ndescription in both its initial bound state and its continuum. Our calculations\ndepend not only on the Asymptotic Normalisation Coefficient (ANC) of the 15C\nground state, but also on the 14C-n continuum. This questions the method\nproposed by Summers and Nunes [Phys. Rev. C 78, 011601 (2008), ibid. 78, 069908\n(2008)], which assumes that an ANC can be directly extracted from the\ncomparison of calculations to breakup data. Fortunately, the sensitivity to the\ncontinuum description can be absorbed in a normalisation constant obtained by a\nsimple {\\chi}2 fit of our calculations to the measurements. By restricting this\nfit to low 14C-n energy in the continuum, we can achieve a better agreement\nbetween the radiative-capture cross sections inferred from the Coulomb-breakup\nmethod and the exact ones. This result revives the Coulomb-breakup technique to\ninfer neutron radiative-capture capture to loosely-bound states, which would be\nvery useful for r- and s-process modelling in explosive stellar environments.\n", "  We extend the Rouse model of polymer dynamics to situations of non-stationary\nchain growth. For a dragged polymer chain of length $N(t) = t^\\alpha$, we find\ntwo transitions in conformational dynamics. At $\\alpha= 1/2$, the propagation\nof tension and the average shape of the chain change qualitatively, while at\n$\\alpha = 1 $ the average center-of-mass motion stops. These transitions are\ndue to a simple physical mechanism: a race duel between tension propagation and\npolymer growth. Therefore they should also appear for growing semi-flexible or\nstiff polymers. The generalized Rouse model inherits much of the versatility of\nthe original Rouse model: it can be efficiently simulated and it is amenable to\nanalytical treatment.\n", "  We propose a new algorithm for sampling the $N$-body density $|\\Psi({\\bf\nR})|^2/\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3N}} |\\Psi|^2$ in the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)\nframework. This algorithm is based upon a modified Ricci-Ciccotti\ndiscretization of the Langevin dynamics in the phase space $({\\bf R},{\\bf P})$\nimproved by a Metropolis acceptation/rejection step. We show through some\nrepresentative numerical examples (Lithium, Fluorine and Copper atoms, and\nphenol molecule), that this algorithm is superior to the standard sampling\nalgorithm based on the biased random walk (importance sampling).\n"]}
