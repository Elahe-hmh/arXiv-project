"abstract": ["  Group formation is important in many economic contexts. The current\nliterature on group formation assumes that individuals may join any existing\ngroup. In this paper, I consider the implications of social, geographic, and\ninformational constraints to group membership decisions. I embed the players in\na network of relationships, which constrains their choice of groups--they may\nonly join a group if that group contains a member that they are connected to on\nthe network. I then examine how this network constraint affects the equilibrium\ngroup structure. I show that even with complete information, unconstrained\nindividuals form groups that are inefficiently large. When individuals are\nconstrained, the resulting group structures are much closer to the socially\noptimal group structure, because the constraint limits the ability of the\nindividual to free ride on the efforts of other group members. The efficiency\nof the outcome is related to the structure of the network constraint--outcomes\nare more efficient when networks are sparse and have few random connections.\n", "  It is shown that the Schrodinger symmetry algebra of a free particle in d\nspatial dimensions can be embedded into a representation of the higher-spin\nalgebra. The latter spans an infinite dimensional algebra of higher-order\nsymmetry generators of the free Schrodinger equation. An explicit\nrepresentation of the maximal finite dimensional subalgebra of the higher spin\nalgebra is given in terms of non-relativistic generators. We show also how to\nconvert Vasiliev's equations into an explicit non-relativistic covariant form,\nsuch that they might apply to non-relativistic systems. Our procedure reveals\nthat the space of solutions of the Schrodinger equation can be regarded also as\na supersymmetric module.\n", "  When dealing with the dissemination of epidemics, one important question that\ncan be asked is the location where the contamination began. In this paper, we\nanalyze three spreading schemes and propose and validate an effective\nmethodology for the identification of the source nodes. The method is based on\nthe calculation of the centrality of the nodes on the sampled network,\nexpressed here by degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centrality. We\nshow that the source node tends to have the highest measurement values. The\npotential of the methodology is illustrated with respect to three theoretical\ncomplex network models as well as a real-world network, the email network of\nthe University Rovira i Virgili.\n", "  Many organizations rely on the skills of innovative individuals to create\nvalue, including academic and government institutions, think tanks, and\nknowledge-based firms. Roughly speaking, workers in these fields can be divided\ninto two categories: specialists, who have a deep knowledge of a single area,\nand generalists, who have knowledge in a wide variety of areas. In this paper,\nI examine an individual's choice to be a specialist or generalist. My model\naddresses two questions: first, under what conditions does it make sense for an\nindividual to acquire skills in multiple areas, and second, are the decisions\nmade by individuals optimal from an organizational perspective? I find that\nwhen problems are single-dimensional, and disciplinary boundaries are open, all\nworkers will specialize. However, when there are barriers to working on\nproblems in other fields, then there is a tradeoff between the depth of the\nspecialist and the wider scope of problems the generalist has available. When\nproblems are simple, having a wide variety of problems makes it is rational to\nbe a generalist. As these problems become more difficult, though, depth wins\nout over scope, and workers again tend to specialize. However, that decision is\nnot necessarily socially optimal--on a societal level, we would prefer that\nsome workers remain generalists.\n", "  The rapidly increasing interest in the quantum properties of living matter\nstimulates a discussion of the fundamental properties of life as well as\nquantum mechanics. In this discussion often concepts are used that originate in\nphilosophy and ask for a philosophical analysis. In the present work the\nclassic philosophical tradition based on Aristotle and Aquinas is employed\nwhich surprisingly is able to shed light on important aspects. Especially one\ncould mention the high degree of unity in living objects and the occurrence of\nthorough qualitative changes. The latter are outside the scope of classical\nphysics where changes are restricted to geometrical rearrangement of\nmicroscopic particles. A challenging approach is used in the philosophical\nanalysis as the empirical evidence is not taken from everyday life but from\n20th century science (quantum mechanics) and recent results in the field of\nquantum biology. In the discussion it is argued that quantum entanglement is\npossibly related to the occurrence of life. Finally it is recommended that\nscientists and philosophers should be open for dialogue that could enrich both.\nScientists could redirect their investigation, as paradigm shifts like the one\noriginating from philosophical evaluation of quantum mechanics give new insight\nabout the relation between the whole en the parts. Whereas philosophers could\nuse scientific results as a consistency check for their philosophical framework\nfor understanding reality.\n", "  Collaboration networks provide a method for examining the highly\nheterogeneous structure of collaborative communities. However, we still have\nlimited theoretical understanding of how individual heterogeneity relates to\nnetwork heterogeneity. The model presented here provides a framework linking an\nindividual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and the\ndistribution of skills in the population to the structure of the collaboration\nnetwork as a whole. This model suggests that there is a non-trivial\nrelationship between skills and network position: individuals with a useful\ncombination of skills will have a disproportionate number of links in the\nnetwork. Indeed, in some cases, an individual's degree is non-monotonic in the\nnumber of skills she has--an individual with very few skills may outperform an\nindividual with many. Special cases of the model suggest that the degree\ndistribution of the network will be skewed, even when the distribution of\nskills is uniform in the population. The degree distribution becomes more\nskewed as problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a\nfew high-degree superstars. This has striking implications for labor market\noutcomes in industries where production is largely the result of collaborative\neffort.\n", "  We describe the Mediatrix filamentation method, an iterative procedure that\ndecomposes image shapes in filaments over their intensity ridgeline along their\nmain direction using perpendicular bisectors. From this decomposition several\nmorphological features can be derived, such as the length along the main\ndirection and thickness of the object and, for curved objects, estimates of its\ncenter of curvature and curvature radius. As an example, we apply this\ntechnique to arc-shaped objects: simulated gravitational arcs.\n", "  We provide a method to correct the observed azimuthal anisotropy in heavy-ion\ncollisions for the event plane resolution in a wide centrality bin. This new\nprocedure is especially useful for rare particles, such as Omega baryons and\nJ/psi mesons, which are difficult to measure in small intervals of centrality.\nBased on a Monte Carlo calculation with simulated v_2 and multiplicity, we show\nthat some of the commonly used methods have a bias of up to 15%.\n", "  We study dipolar relaxation of a chromium BEC loaded into a 3D optical\nlattice. We observe dipolar relaxation resonances when the magnetic energy\nreleased during the inelastic collision matches an excitation towards higher\nenergy bands. A spectroscopy of these resonances for two orientations of the\nmagnetic field provides a 3D band spectroscopy of the lattice. The narrowest\nresonance is registered for the lowest excitation energy. Its line-shape is\nsensitive to the on-site interaction energy. We use such sensitivity to probe\nnumber squeezing in a Mott insulator, and we reveal the production of\nthree-body states with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the quasineutral limit of the Euler-Poisson\nequation for a clod, ion-acoustic plasma when the Debye length tends to zero.\nWhen the ion-acoustic plasma is cold, the Euler-Poisson equation is\npressureless and hence fails to be Friedrich symmetrisable, which excludes the\napplication of the classical energy estimates method. This brings new\ndifficulties in proving uniform estimates independent of $\\varepsilon$. The\nmain novelty in this article is to introduce new $\\varepsilon$-weighted norms\nof the unknowns and to combine energy estimates in different levels with\nweights depending on $\\varepsilon$. Finally, that the quasineutral regimes are\nthe incompressible Euler equations is proven for well prepared initial data.\n", "  The quantum states or Hilbert spaces for the quantum field theory in de\nSitter space-time are studied on ambient space formalism. In this formalism,\nthe quantum states are only depended $(1)$ on the topological character of the\nde Sitter space-time, {\\it i.e.} $\\R \\times S^3$, and $(2)$ on the homogeneous\nspaces which are used for construction of the unitary irreducible\nrepresentation of de Sitter group. A compact homogeneous space is chosen in\nthis paper. The unique feature of this homogeneous space is that its total\nnumber of quantum states, ${\\cal N}$, is finite although the Hilbert space has\ninfinite dimensions. It is shown that ${\\cal N}$ is a continuous function of\nthe Hubble constant $H$ and the eigenvalue of the Casimir operators of de\nSitter group. The entropy of the quantum fields on this Hilbert space have been\ncalculated which is finite and invariant for all inertial observers on the de\nSitter hyperboloid.\n", "  The world data on yields and ratios of different $\\Upsilon$ states created in\nhadron collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 19-8000$ GeV are examined in systematic way.\nWe find that $\\Upsilon(2S)/\\Upsilon(1S)=0.275\\pm0.005$ and\n$\\Upsilon(3S)/\\Upsilon(1S)=0.128\\pm0.004$. No signficant energy dependence of\nthese ratios are observed within the broad collision energies. In addition, the\nrapidity, transverse momentum, and transverse mass dependence of these ratios\nare also reported.\n", "  We prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution to the periodic\nrenormalized $\\Phi^4_3$ model of stochastic quantisation using the method of\ncontrolled distributions introduced recently by Imkeller, Gubinelli and\nPerkowski (\"Paraproducts, rough paths and controlled distributions\",\narXiv:1210.2684)\n", "  Cool red giants and supergiants are among the most complex and fascinating\nstars in the Universe. They are bright and large, and thus can be observed to\nenormous distances allowing us to study the properties of their host galaxies,\nsuch as dynamics and chemical abundances. This review lecture addresses various\nproblems related to observations and modelling spectra of red giants and\nsupergiants.\n", "  Models of radiation transport in stellar atmospheres are the hinge of modern\nastrophysics. Our knowledge of stars, stellar populations, and galaxies is only\nas good as the theoretical models, which are used for the interpretation of\ntheir observed spectra, photometric magnitudes, and spectral energy\ndistributions. I describe recent advances in the field of stellar atmosphere\nmodelling for late-type stars. Various aspects of radiation transport with 1D\nhydrostatic, LTE, NLTE, and 3D radiative-hydrodynamical models are briefly\nreviewed.\n", "  The chemical composition of the Sun is among the most important quantities in\nastrophysics. Solar abundances are needed for modelling stellar atmospheres,\nstellar structure and evolution, population synthesis, and galaxies as a whole.\nThe solar abundance problem refers to the conflict of observed data from\nhelioseismology and the predictions made by stellar interior models for the\nSun, if these models use the newest solar chemical composition obtained with 3D\nand NLTE models of radiative transfer. Here we take a close look at the problem\nfrom observational and theoretical perspective. We also provide a list of\npossible solutions, which have yet to be tested.\n", "  An experiment is proposed in which the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be veryfied\nthrough a spectroscopic measurement. The apparatus consists of gaseous\nhydrochloric acid (HCl) immersed in the vector potential ${\\bf A}$ present in\nthe center of a toroidal coil, where ${\\bf B}=0$. Changes due to ${\\bf A}$ in\nthe absorption spectrum of the gas are investigated.\n", "  Basic assumptions of the NLTE approximation in stellar atmospheres are\nsummarized. The assumptions of thermodynamic equilibrium, local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE), and non-LTE (NLTE) are compared. It is emphasized that LTE\nis a poor approximation if radiative transitions dominate in stellar\natmospheres. The equations of kinetic equilibrium and methods of their solution\nare discussed.\n", "  Methods of calculation of NLTE model atmosphere are discussed. The NLTE trace\nelement procedure is compared with the full NLTE model atmosphere calculation.\nDifferences between LTE and NLTE atmosphere modeling are evaluated. The ways of\nmodel atom construction are discussed. Finally, modelling of expanding\natmospheres of hot stars with winds is briefly reviewed.\n", "  Various available codes for NLTE modeling and analysis of hot star spectra\nare reviewed. Generalizations of standard equations of kinetic equilibrium and\ntheir consequences are discussed.\n", "  The goal of this document is to describe the important practical aspects in\nthe use of an Equivalent Width (EW) method for the derivation of spectroscopic\nstellar parameters. A general description of the fundamental steps composing\nany EW method is given, together with possible differences that may be found in\ndifferent methods used in the literature. Then ARES+MOOG is then used as an\nexample where each step of the method is described in detail. A special focus\nis given for the specific steps of this method, namely the use of a\ndifferential analysis to define the atomic data for the adopted line list, the\nautomatic EW determinations, and the way to find the best parameters at the end\nof the procedure. Finally, a practical tutorial is given, where we focus on\nsimple exercises useful to illustrate and explain the dependence of the\nabundances with the assumed stellar parameters. The interdependences are\ndescribed and a clear procedure is given to find the \"final\" stellar\nparameters.\n", "  Group-level behaviour of particles undergoing a velocity jump process with\nhard-sphere interactions is investigated. We derive $N$-particle transport\nequations that include the possibility of collisions between particles and\napply different approximation techniques to get expressions for the dependence\nof the collective diffusion coefficient on the number of particles and their\ndiameter. The derived approximations are compared with numerical results\nobtained from individual-based simulations. The theoretical results compare\nwell with Monte Carlo simulations providing the excluded volume fraction is\nsmall.\n", "  The vortex dynamics and the specific heat of a type II superconducting system\nwith quasi-periodic geometry is studied theoretically for different values of\ninteraction parameters using the numerical simulation technique, where the\nvortex-vortex interaction potential is considered in the form of the modified\nBessel's function of first kind. The dynamics of the system is analysed by\nphase space trajectories of the vortex for both high and low values as well as\nfor both high and low mismatch of vortex-vortex and vortex-pinning interaction\nparameters. The specific heat variation with temperature is analysed\nstatistically for different values of interaction parameters. It is observed\nthat for low values and lower mismatch of interaction parameters, the system is\nhighly chaotic and shows a bifurcation pattern similar to Hopf bifurcation. The\nspecific heat also shows a highly divergent character in this situation.\nHowever for high values and higher mismatch, the superconducting system tends\nto be a very regular one. The trajectory of the vortices will also be very\nstable in this situation. Similar situations are also observed respectively for\nlow and high values of the quasi-periodic parameter.\n", "  An effective field theory of $\\alpha$ cluster condensation is formulated as a\nspontaneously broken symmetry in quantum field theory to understand the raison\nd'etre and nature of the Hoyle and $\\alpha$ cluster states in $^{12}$C. The\nNambu--Goldstone and Higgs mode operators in infinite systems are replaced with\na pair of canonical operators whose Hamiltonian gives rise to discrete energy\nstates in addition to the Bogoliubov--de Gennes excited states. The\ncalculations reproduce well the experimental spectrum of the $\\alpha$ cluster\nstates. The existence of the Nambu--Goldstone--Higgs states is demonstrated and\ncrucial. The $\\gamma$ decay transitions are also obtained.\n", "  We describe experiments and simulations demonstrating the propulsion of a\nneutrally-buoyant swimmer that consists of a pair of spheres attached by a\nspring, immersed in a vibrating fluid. The vibration of the fluid induces\nrelative motion of the spheres which, for sufficiently large amplitudes, can\nlead to motion of the center of mass of the two spheres. We find that the\nswimming speed obtained from both experiment and simulation agree and collapse\nonto a single curve if plotted as a function of the streaming Reynolds number,\nsuggesting that the propulsion is related to streaming flows. There appears to\nbe a critical onset value of the streaming Reynolds number for swimming to\noccur. We observe a change in the streaming flows as the Reynolds number\nincreases, from that generated by two independent oscillating spheres to a\ncollective flow pattern around the swimmer as a whole. The mechanism for\nswimming is traced to a strengthening of a jet of fluid in the wake of the\nswimmer.\n", "  Phase-sensitive detection (PSD) is an important experimental technique that\nallows signals to be extracted from noisy data. PSD is also used in modulation\nspectroscopy and is used in the stabilization of optical sources. Commercial\nlock-in amplifiers that use PSD are often expensive and host a bewildering\narray of controls that may intimidate a novice user. Low-cost microcontrollers\nsuch as the Arduino family of devices seem like a good match for learning about\nPSD; however, making a self-contained device (reference signal, voltage input,\nmixing, filtering, and display) is difficult, but in the end the project\nteaches students \"tricks\" to turn the Arduino into a true scientific\ninstrument.\n", "  Possible violations of fundamental physical principles, e.g. the Einstein\nequivalence prin- ciple on which all metric theories of gravity are based,\nincluding general relativity (GR), would lead to a rotation of the plane of\npolarization for linearly polarized radiation traveling over cosmological\ndistances, the so-called cosmic polarization rotation (CPR). We review here the\nastrophysical tests which have been carried out so far to check if CPR exists.\nThese are using the radio and ultraviolet polarization of radio galaxies and\nthe polarization of the cosmic microwave background (both E-mode and B-mode).\nThese tests so far have been negative, leading to upper limits of the order of\none degree on any CPR angle, thereby increasing our confidence in those\nphysical principles, including GR. We also discuss future prospects in\ndetecting CPR or improving the constraints on it.\n", "  We simulate the long-range inter-complex electronic energy transfer in\nPhotosystem II -- from the antenna complex, via a core complex, to the reaction\ncenter -- using a non-Markovian (ZOFE) quantum master equation description that\nallows us to quantify the electronic coherence involved in the energy transfer.\nWe identify the pathways of the energy transfer in the network of coupled\nchromophores, using a description based on excitation probability currents. We\ninvestigate how the energy transfer depends on the initial excitation --\nlocalized, coherent initial excitation versus delocalized, incoherent initial\nexcitation -- and find that the energy transfer is remarkably robust with\nrespect to such strong variations of the initial condition. To explore the\nimportance of vibrationally enhanced transfer and to address the question of\noptimization in the system parameters, we vary the strength of the coupling\nbetween the electronic and the vibrational degrees of freedom. We find that the\noriginal parameters lie in a (broad) region that enables optimal transfer\nefficiency, and that the energy transfer appears to be very robust with respect\nto variations in the vibronic coupling. Nevertheless, vibrationally enhanced\ntransfer appears to be crucial to obtain a high transfer efficiency. We compare\nour quantum simulation to a \"classical\" rate equation based on a\nmodified-Redfield/generalized-F\\\"orster description that was previously used to\nsimulate energy transfer dynamics in the entire Photosystem II complex, and\nfind very good agreement between quantum and rate-equation simulation of the\noverall energy transfer dynamics.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the energetics of thin nematic shells with\ntwo charge one-half defects and one charge-one defect. We determine the optimal\narrangement: the defects are located on a great circle at the vertices of an\nisosceles triangle with angles of 66 degrees at the charge one-half defects and\na distinct angle of 48 degrees, consistent with experimental findings. We also\nanalyse thermal fluctuations around this ground state and estimate the energy\nas a function of thickness. We find that the energy of the three-defect shell\nis close to the energy of other known configurations having two charge-one and\nfour charge one-half defects. This finding, together with the large energy\nbarriers separating one configuration from the others, explains their\nobservation in experiments as well as their long-time stability.\n", "  We study the manifestation of local gauge anomalies of four- and\nsix-dimensional field theories in the lower-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory\nobtained after circle compactification. We identify a convenient set of\ntransformations acting on the whole tower of massless and massive states and\ninvestigate their action on the low-energy effective theories in the Coulomb\nbranch. The maps employ higher-dimensional large gauge transformations and\nprecisely yield the anomaly cancelation conditions when acting on the one-loop\ninduced Chern-Simons terms in the three- and five-dimensional effective theory.\nThe arising symmetries are argued to play a key role in the study of the\nM-theory to F-theory limit on Calabi-Yau manifolds. For example, using the fact\nthat all fully resolved F-theory geometries inducing multiple Abelian gauge\ngroups or non-Abelian groups admit a certain set of symmetries, we are able to\ngenerally show the cancelation of pure Abelian or pure non-Abelian anomalies in\nthese models.\n", "  The interparticle interactions in a magnetic nanocomposite play a dominant\nrole in controlling the phase transitions superparamagnetic to superspinglass\nto superferromagnetic. These interactions can be tuned by controlling the size\nand number density of nanoparticles. Aerogel composites, 0.3 Ni-BC and 0.7\nNi-BC, consisting of Ni nanoparticles distributed in bacterial cellulose have\nbeen used as model systems to study the effect of interparticle interactions\nwith increasing fraction of Ni in the composite. Contrary to conventional\napproach, the size of Ni nanoparticles is not controlled and was allowed to\nform naturally in the bacterial cellulose template. The structural\ncharacterization using x-ray diffraction and electron microscopies indicates\nthe presence of only Ni and cellulose with no other phases. The uncontrolled\ngrowth of Ni in cellulose matrix results in the formation of nanoparticles with\n3 different size distributions - 10 nm particles mainly distributed along the\nlength of fibrils, 50 nm particles present in the intermediate spaces between\nthe fibrils and 100 nm particles present in voids formed by the reticulate\nstructure. At room temperature the composites exhibit a weakly ferromagnetic\nbehavior with a coercivity of 40 Oe which increases to 160 Oe at 10 K. The\ntransition from weakly ferromagnetic state at room temperature to a\nsuperferromagnetic state at low temperatures is mediated via a superspinglass\nstate at intermediate temperatures. A temperature dependent microstructural\nmodel has been developed combining the structural and magnetic results obtained\nfrom the two composite aerogels.\n", "  We investigate entanglement properties of infinite 1D and 2D spin-1/2 quantum\nIsing and XXZ models. Tensor network methods (MPS in 1D and TERG and CTMRG in\n2D) are used to model the ground state of the studied models. Different\nentanglement measures, such as one-site entanglement entropy, one-tangle,\nconcurrence of formation and assistance, negativity and entanglement per bond\nare calculated and their `characterizing power' to determine quantum phase\ntransitions is compared. A special emphasis is made on the study of\nentanglement monogamy properties.\n", "  This article, as the first of three, aims at establishing the\n(time-dependent) Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in the sense of space\nadiabatic perturbation theory, for quantum systems constructed by techniques of\nthe loop quantum gravity framework, especially the canonical formulation of the\nlatter. The analysis presented here fits into a rather general framework, and\noffers a solution to the problem of applying the usual Born-Oppenheimer ansatz\nfor molecular (or structurally analogous) systems to more general quantum\nsystems (e.g. spin-orbit models) by means of space adiabatic perturbation\ntheory. The proposed solution is applied to a simple, finite dimensional model\nof interacting spin systems, which serves as a non-trivial, minimal model of\nthe aforesaid problem. Furthermore, it is explained how the content of this\narticle, and its companion, affect the possible extraction of quantum field\ntheory on curved spacetime from loop quantum gravity (including matter fields).\n", "  In this article, the second of three, we discuss and develop the basis of a\nWeyl quantisation for compact Lie groups aiming at loop quantum gravity-type\nmodels. This Weyl quantisation may serve as the main mathematical tool to\nimplement the program of space adiabatic perturbation theory in such models. As\nwe already argued in our first article, space adiabatic perturbation theory\noffers an ideal framework to overcome the obstacles that hinder the direct\nimplementation of the conventional Born-Oppenheimer approach in the canonical\nformulation of loop quantum gravity. Additionally, we conjecture the existence\nof a new form of the Segal-Bargmann-Hall \"coherent state\" transform for compact\nLie groups $G$, which we prove for $G=U(1)^{n}$ and support by numerical\nevidence for $G=SU(2)$. The reason for conjoining this conjecture with the main\ntopic of this article originates in the observation, that the coherent state\ntransform can be used as a basic building block of a coherent state\nquantisation (Berezin quantisation) for compact Lie groups $G$. But, as Weyl\nand Berezin quantisation for $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ are intimately related by heat\nkernel evolution, it is natural to ask, whether a similar connection exists for\ncompact Lie groups, as well. Moreover, since the formulation of space adiabatic\nperturbation theory requires a (deformation) quantisation as minimal input, we\nanalyse the question to what extent the coherent state quantisation, defined by\nthe Segal-Bargmann-Hall transform, can serve as basis of the former.\n", "  Various spin effects are expected to become observable in light-matter\ninteraction at relativistic intensities. Relativistic quantum mechanics\nequipped with a suitable relativistic spin operator forms the theoretical\nfoundation for describing these effects. Various proposals for relativistic\nspin operators have been offered by different authors, which are presented in a\nunified way. As a result of the operators' mathematical properties only the\nFoldy-Wouthuysen operator and the Pryce operator qualify as possible proper\nrelativistic spin operators. The ground states of highly charged hydrogen-like\nions can be utilized to identify a legitimate relativistic spin operator\nexperimentally. Subsequently, the Foldy-Wothuysen spin operator is employed to\nstudy electron-spin precession in high-intensity standing light waves with\nelliptical polarization. For a correct theoretical description of the predicted\nelectron-spin precession relativistic effects due to the spin angular momentum\nof the electromagnetic wave has to be taken into account even in the limit of\nlow intensities.\n", "  We investigate the quark-gluon three-point correlation function within a\none-loop computation performed in the Curci-Ferrari massive extension of the\nFaddeev-Popov gauge-fixed action. The mass term is used as a minimal way for\ntaking into account the influence of the Gribov ambiguity. Our results, with\nrenormalization-group improvement, are compared with lattice data. We show that\nthe comparison is in general very satisfactory for the functions which are\ncompatible with chiral symmetry, except for one. We argue that this may be due\nto large systematic errors {when extracting this function from} lattice\nsimulations. The quantities which break chiral symmetry are more sensitive to\nthe details of the renormalization scheme. We however manage to reproduce some\nof them with good precision. The chosen parameters allow to simultaneously fit\nthe quark mass function coming from the quark propagator with a reasonably\nagreement.\n", "  The hydrodynamic equations with quantum effects are studied in this paper.\nFirst we establish the global existence of smooth solutions with small initial\ndata and then in the second part, we establish the convergence of the solutions\nof the quantum hydrodynamic equations to those of the classical hydrodynamic\nequations. The energy equation is considered in this paper, which added new\ndifficulties to the energy estimates, especially to the selection of the\nappropriate Sobolev spaces.\n", "  Correlations between the star formation rates (SFRs) of nearby galaxies\n(so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up\nto 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We\ninvestigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby\nhalos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of\nhost halos \"know about\" each others' assembly histories even when their\npresent-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either\nhalo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the\nhalos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at\nthese distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which\nregulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external\nforces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity\nsignal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively\nsimilar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with\ndistance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are\ncorrelated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale\ngalactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels\nby z > 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z ~ 1;\nconfirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo\naccretion rate and central galaxy SFR.\n", "  Many of the new physics models predicts a light Higgs boson similar to the\nHiggs boson of the Standard Model (SM) and also extra scalar bosons. Beyond the\nsearch channels for a SM Higgs boson, the future collider experiments will\nexplore additional channels that are specific to extended Higgs sectors. We\nstudy the charged Higgs boson production within the framework of two Higgs\ndoublet models (THDM) in the proton-proton collisions at the FCC-hh collider.\nWith an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$ at very high energy frontier, we\nobtain a significant coverage of the parameter space and distinguish the\ncharged Higgs-top-bottom interaction within the THDM or other new physics\nmodels with charged Higgs boson mass up to 1 TeV.\n", "  We present the first numerical simulations in coupled dark energy cosmologies\nwith high enough resolution to investigate the effects of the coupling on\ngalactic and sub-galactic scales. We choose two constant couplings and a\ntime-varying coupling function and we run simulations of three Milky-Way-size\nhalos ($\\sim$10$^{12}$M$_{\\odot}$), a lower mass halo\n(6$\\times$10$^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$) and a dwarf galaxy halo\n(5$\\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\\odot}$). We resolve each halo with several millions dark\nmatter particles. On all scales the coupling causes lower halo concentrations\nand a reduced number of substructures with respect to LCDM. We show that the\nreduced concentrations are not due to different formation times, but they are\nrelated to the extra terms that appear in the equations describing the\ngravitational dynamics. On the scale of the Milky Way satellites, we show that\nthe lower concentrations can help in reconciling observed and simulated\nrotation curves, but the coupling values necessary to have a significant\ndifference from LCDM are outside the current observational constraints. On the\nother hand, if other modifications to the standard model allowing a higher\ncoupling (e.g. massive neutrinos) are considered, coupled dark energy can\nbecome an interesting scenario to alleviate the small-scale issues of the LCDM\nmodel.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of interstellar X-ray extinction using the\nextensive Chandra supernova remnant archive and use our results to refine the\nempirical relation between the hydrogen column density and optical extinction.\nIn our analysis, we make use of the large, uniform data sample to assess\nvarious systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the interstellar X-ray\nabsorption. Specifically, we address systematic uncertainties that originate\nfrom (i) the emission models used to fit supernova remnant spectra, (ii) the\nspatial variations within individual remnants, (iii) the physical conditions of\nthe remnant such as composition, temperature, and non-equilibrium regions, and\n(iv) the model used for the absorption of X-rays in the interstellar medium.\nUsing a Bayesian framework to quantify these systematic uncertainties, and\ncombining the resulting hydrogen column density measurements with the\nmeasurements of optical extinction toward the same remnants, we find the\nempirical relation NH = (2.87+/-0.12) x 10^21 AV cm^(-2), which is\nsignificantly higher than the previous measurements.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the signatures of the Hubbard Model in the strongly\ninteracting regime can be simulated by modifying the screening in the limit of\nzero wavevector in Projector-Augmented Wave GW calculations for systems without\nsignificant nesting. This modification, when applied to the Mott insulator CuO,\nresults in the opening of the Mott gap by the splitting of states at the Fermi\nlevel into upper and lower Hubbard bands, and exhibits a giant transfer of\nspectral weight upon electron doping. The method is also employed to clearly\nillustrate that the M$_{1}$ and M$_{2}$ forms of vanadium dioxide are\nfundamentally different types of insulator. Standard GW calculations are\nsufficient to open a gap in M$_{1}$ VO$_{2}$, which arise from the Peierls\npairings filling the valence band, creating homopolar bonds. The valence band\nwavefunctions are stabilized with respect to the conduction band, reducing\npolarizability and pushing the conduction band eigenvalues to higher energy.\nThe M$_{2}$ structure however opens a gap from strong on-site interactions; it\nis a Mott insulator.\n", "  We construct a theory for Bose-Einstein condensation of light in\nnano-fabricated semiconductor microcavities. We model the semiconductor by one\nconduction and one valence band which consist of electrons and holes that\ninteract via a Coulomb interaction. Moreover, we incorporate screening effects\nby using a contact interaction with the scattering length for a Yukawa\npotential and describe in this manner the crossover from exciton gas to\nelectron-hole plasma as we increase the excitation level of the semiconductor.\nWe then show that the dynamics of the light in the microcavities is damped due\nto the coupling to the semiconductor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that on the\nelectron-hole plasma side of the crossover, which is relevant for the\nBose-Einstein condensation of light, this damping can be described by a single\ndimensionless damping parameter that depends on the external pumping.\nHereafter, we propose to probe the superfluidity of light in these\nnano-fabricated semiconductor microcavities by making use of the differences in\nthe response in the normal or superfluid phase to a sudden rotation of the\ntrap. In particular, we determine frequencies and damping of the scissors modes\nthat are excited in this manner. Moreover, we show that a distinct signature of\nthe dynamical Casimir effect can be observed in the density-density\ncorrelations of the excited light fluid.\n", "  There are two different notions of holonomy in supergeometry, the supergroup\nintroduced by Galaev and our functorial approach motivated by super Wilson\nloops. Either theory comes with its own version of invariance of vectors and\nsubspaces under holonomy. By our first main result, the Twofold Theorem, these\ndefinitions are equivalent. Our proof is based on the Comparison Theorem, our\nsecond main result, which characterises Galaev's holonomy algebra as an algebra\nof coefficients, building on previous results. As an application, we generalise\nsome of Galaev's results to S-points, utilising the holonomy functor. We\nobtain, in particular, a de Rham-Wu decomposition theorem for semi-Riemannian\nS-supermanifolds.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of phase estimation using a generic class of\npath-symmetric entangled states\n$|\\varphi\\rangle|0\\rangle+|0\\rangle|\\varphi\\rangle$, where an arbitrary state\n$|\\varphi\\rangle$ occupies one of two modes in quantum superposition. This\nclass of states includes the previously considered states, i.e. $NOON$ states\nand entangled coherent states, as special cases. With its generalization, we\nidentify the practical limit of phase estimation under energy constraint that\nis characterized by the photon statistics of the component state\n$|\\varphi\\rangle$. We first show that quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) can be\nlowered with super-Poissonianity of the state $|\\varphi\\rangle$. By introducing\na component state of the form\n$|\\varphi\\rangle=\\sqrt{q}|1\\rangle+\\sqrt{1-q}|N\\rangle$, we particularly show\nthat an arbitrarily small QCRB can be achieved even with a finite energy in an\nideal situation. For practical measurement schemes, we consider a parity\nmeasurement and a full photon-counting method to obtain phase-sensitivity.\nWithout photon loss, the latter scheme employing any path-symmetric states\n$|\\varphi\\rangle|0\\rangle+|0\\rangle|\\varphi\\rangle$ achieves the QCRB over the\nentire range $[0,2\\pi]$ of unknown phase shift $\\phi$ whereas the former does\nso in a certain confined range of $\\phi$. We find that the case of\n$|\\varphi\\rangle=\\sqrt{q}|1\\rangle+\\sqrt{1-q}|N\\rangle$ provides the most\nrobust resource against loss among the considered entangled states over the\nwhole range of input energy. Finally we also propose experimental schemes to\ngenerate these path-symmetric entangled states.\n", "  We present a quantum version of the generalized $(h,\\phi)$-entropies,\nintroduced by Salicr\\'u \\textit{et al.} for the study of classical probability\ndistributions. We establish their basic properties, and show that already known\nquantum entropies such as von Neumann, and quantum versions of R\\'enyi,\nTsallis, and unified entropies, constitute particular classes of the present\ngeneral quantum Salicr\\'u form. We exhibit that majorization plays a key role\nin explaining most of their common features. We give a characterization of the\nquantum $(h,\\phi)$-entropies under the action of quantum operations, and study\ntheir properties for composite systems. We apply these generalized entropies to\nthe problem of detection of quantum entanglement, and introduce a discussion on\npossible generalized conditional entropies as well.\n", "  When a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (BH), roughly\nhalf of its mass falls back to the BH at super-Eddington rates. Being tenuously\ngravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only a small fraction\nf_in << 1 of the returning debris will likely be incorporated into the disk and\naccrete, with the vast majority instead becoming unbound in an outflow of\nvelocity ~1e4 km/s. This slow outflow spreads laterally, encasing the BH. For\nmonths or longer, the outflow remains sufficiently neutral to block hard EUV\nand X-ray radiation from the hot inner disk, which instead becomes trapped in a\nradiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of\nthe ejecta to temperatures of T > few 1e4 K, converting the emission to\noptical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower\nopacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant\neffective temperatures of optically-discovered TDE flares. For BHs with\nrelatively high masses M_BH > 1e7 M_sun the ejecta can become ionized at an\nearlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare\nwhich is instead dominated by thermal X-ray emission. We predict total radiated\nenergies consistent with those of observed TDE flares, and ejecta velocities\nthat agree with the measured emission line widths. The peak optical luminosity\nfor M_BH < 1e6 M_sun is suppressed due to adiabatic losses in the inner disk\nwind, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in\ngalaxies with low mass BHs. In the classical picture, where f_in ~ 1, TDEs\nde-spin supermassive BHs and cap their maximum spins well below theoretical\naccretion physics limits. This cap is greatly relaxed in our model, and\nexisting Fe K-alpha spin measurements provide suggestive preliminary evidence\nthat f_in < 1.\n", "  The world experimental data on cross section and kinematic distribution in\n$p+p$ and $p+A$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 6.8 - 7000 GeV are examined in\nsystematic way. The $\\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the inclusive cross section,\nrapidity and transverse momentum distributions are studied phenomenologically.\nWe explore empirical formulas to obtain the total cross section, rapidity and\ntransverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distribution. This is crucial for the\ninterpretation of A$+$A $J/\\psi$ results at RHIC when the $p+p$ reference data\nare not available. In addition, the cross section at mid-rapidity and\ntransverse momentum distributions in $p+p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 39 and\n62.4 GeV are evaluated.\n", "  A single qubit driven by an appropriate sequence of control pulses can serve\nas a spectrometer of local noise affecting its energy splitting. We show that\nby driving and observing two spatially separated qubits, it is possible to\nreconstruct the spectrum of cross-correlations of noises acting at various\nlocations. When the qubits are driven by the same sequence of pulses, real part\nof cross-correlation spectrum can be reconstructed, while applying two distinct\nsequence to the two qubits allows for reconstruction of imaginary part of this\nspectrum. The latter quantity contains information on either causal\ncorrelations between environmental dynamics at distinct locations, or on the\noccurrence of propagation of noisy signals through the environment. We\nillustrate the former case by modeling the noise spectroscopy protocol for\nqubits coupled to correlated two-level systems. While entanglement between the\nqubits is not necessary, its presence enhances the signal from which the\nspectroscopic information is reconstructed.\n", "  The discrete spectra of certain two-dimensional Schrodinger operators are\nnumerically calculated. These operators have interesting spectral properties,\ni.e. their kernels are multi-dimensional and the deformations of potentials via\nthe Novikov-Veselov equation (a two-dimensional generalization of the\nKorteweg-de Vries equation) lead to blowups, and are obtained by the Moutard\ntransformation. The calculations supply the numerical evidence for certain\nstatements on integrable systems related to the 2D Schrodinger operator. The\nnumerical scheme is applicable to a general 2D Schrodinger operator with fast\ndecaying potential.\n", "  Recent advances in light microscopy have spawned new research frontiers in\nmicrobiology by working around the diffraction barrier and allowing for the\nobservation of nanometric biological structures. Microrheology is the study of\nthe properties of complex fluids, such as those found in biology, through the\ndynamics of small embedded particles, typically latex beads. Statistics based\non the recorded sample paths are then used by biophysicists to infer\nrheological properties of the fluid. In the biophysical literature, the main\nstatistic for characterizing diffusivity is the so-named mean squared\ndisplacement (MSD) of the tracer particles. Notwithstanding the central role\nplayed by the MSD, its asymptotic distribution in different cases has not yet\nbeen established. In this paper, we tackle this problem. We take a pathwise\napproach and assume that the particle movement undergoes a Gaussian,\nstationary-increment stochastic process. We show that as the sample and the\nincrement lag sizes go to infinity, the MSD displays Gaussian or non-Gaussian\nlimiting distributions, as well as distinct convergence rates, depending on the\ndiffusion exponent parameter. We illustrate our results analytically and\ncomputationally based on fractional Brownian motion and the (integrated)\nfractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n", "  We took spatially resolved slit spectra of 261 field disk galaxies at\nredshifts up to z~1 using the FORS instruments of the ESO Very Large Telescope.\nOur spectroscopy was complemented with HST/ACS imaging in the F814W filter. We\nanalyzed the ionized gas kinematics by extracting rotation curves from the 2-D\nspectra. Taking into account all geometrical, observational and instrumental\neffects, these rotation curves were used to derive the intrinsic Vmax.\nNeglecting galaxies with disturbed kinematics or insufficient spatial rotation\ncurve extent, Vmax could be robustly determined for 124 galaxies covering\nredshifts 0.05<z<0.97. This is one of the largest kinematic samples of distant\ndisk galaxies to date. We compared this data set to the local B-band\nTully-Fisher relation and the local velocity-size relation. The scatter in both\nscaling relations is a factor of ~2 larger at z~0.5 than at z~0. The deviations\nof individual distant galaxies from the local Tully-Fisher relation are\nsystematic in the sense that the galaxies are increasingly overluminous towards\nhigher redshifts, corresponding to an over-luminosity of -(1.2+-0.5) mag at\nz=1. This luminosity evolution at given Vmax is probably driven by younger\nstellar populations of distant galaxies with respect to their local\ncounterparts, potentially combined with modest changes in dark matter mass\nfractions. The analysis of the velocity-size relation reveals that disk\ngalaxies of a given Vmax have grown in size by a factor of ~1.5 over the past\n~8 Gyr, likely via accretion of cold gas and/or small satellites. Scrutinizing\nthe combined evolution in luminosity and size, we find that the galaxies which\nshow the strongest evolution towards smaller sizes at z~1 are not those which\nfeature the strongest evolution in luminosity, and vice versa.

Structure and electrical properties,\ntechnological aspects of producing of high-strength artificial graphite and\ndynamics of its destruction are considered. These type of graphite are\ntraditionally used in the nuclear industry, so author concentrates on actual\nproblems of application and testing of graphite materials in modern science and\ntechnology.\n  Translated from chapters 1 of monograph (by Zhmurikov E.I., Bubnenkov I.A.,\nPokrovsky A.S. et al.

Our replica trick is based on the\nanalytic continuation of partition functions that break the replica Z_n\nsymmetry. It provides a method for computing arbitrary matrix elements of the\nmodular Hamiltonian corresponding to excited states in terms of correlation\nfunctions. We show that the quantum Fisher information in vacuum can be\nexpressed in terms of two-point functions on the replica geometry. We perform\nsample calculations in two-dimensional conformal field theories.\n", "  I present a 40 kilosecond Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)\nobservation of the recently identified low-luminosity X-ray binary and\ntransitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) candidate 1RXS J154439.4-112820, which\nis associated with the high-energy gamma-ray source 3FGL J1544.6--1125. The\nsystem is detected up to ~30 keV with an extension of the same power-law\nspectrum and rapid large-amplitude variability between two flux levels observed\nin soft X-rays. These findings provide further evidence that 1RXS\nJ154439.4-112820 belongs to the same class of objects as the nearby bona fide\ntMSPs PSR J1023+0038 and XSS J12270-4859 and therefore almost certainly hosts a\nmillisecond pulsar accreting at low luminosities. I also examine the long-term\naccretion history of 1RXS J154439.4-112820 based on archival optical,\nultraviolet, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray light curves covering the past\n$\\sim$decade. Throughout this period, the source has maintained similar flux\nlevels at all wavelengths, which is an indication that it has not experienced\nprolonged episodes of a non-accreting radio pulsar state but may spontaneously\nundergo such a state transformation in the future.\n", "  As the pion mass approaches a critical value $m_\\pi^\\star$ from below, an\n$S$-wave resonance crosses pion-baryon threshold and becomes a bound state with\narbitrarily small binding energy, thus driving the scattering length to\ndiverge. I explore the consequences of chiral symmetry for the values of\n$m_\\pi$ close to $m_\\pi^\\star$. It turns out that chiral symmetry is crucial\nfor an $S$-wave resonance to be able to stand very near threshold and in the\nmeantime to remain narrow, provided that the mass splitting is reasonably\nsmall. The effective range of pion-baryon scattering is unexpectedly large,\nproportional to $ 4\\pi f_\\pi^2/m_\\pi^3$ when $m_\\pi$ is around $m_\\pi^\\star$.\nAs a result, this unexpected large length scale causes universality relations\nto break down much sooner than naively expected.\n", "  On Thursday, September 1, 1859, the British astronomer Richard Carrington,\nfor the first time ever, observes a spectacular gleam of visible light on the\nsurface of the solar disk, the photosphere. The Carrington Event, as it is\nnowadays known by scientists, occurred because of the high solar activity that\nhad visible consequences on Earth, in particular reports of outstanding aurorae\nactivity that amazed thousands of people in the western hemisphere during the\ndawn of September 2. The geomagnetic storm, generated by the solar-terrestrial\nevent, had such a magnitude that the auroral oval expanded towards the equator,\nallowing low latitudes, like Panama's 9$^\\circ$ N, to catch a sight of the\naurorae. An expedition was carried out to review several historical reports and\nbooks from the northern cities of Colombia, allowing the identification of a\nnarrative from Monter\\'ia, Colombia (8$^\\circ$ 45' N), that describes phenomena\nresembling those of an aurorae borealis, such as fire-like lights, blazing and\ndazzling glares, and the appearance of an immense S-like shape in the sky. The\nvery low latitude of the geomagnetic north pole in 1859, the lowest value in\nover half a millennia, is proposed to have allowed the observations of auroral\nevents at locations closer to the equator, and supports the historical\ndescription found in Colombia. The finding of such chronicle represents one of\nthe most complete descriptions of low-latitude sightings of aurorae caused by\nthe Carrington Event.\n", "  Using nuclear quadrupole resonance, the phase diagram of 1111\n$R$FeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ ($R$$=$La, Ce, Sm) iron pnictides is constructed as a\nfunction of the local charge distribution in the paramagnetic state, which\nfeatures low-doping-like (LD-like) and high-doping-like (HD-like) regions.\nCompounds based on magnetic rare earths (Ce, Sm) display a unified behavior,\nand comparison with La-based compounds reveals the detrimental role of static\niron $3d$ magnetism on superconductivity, as well as a qualitatively different\nevolution of the latter at high doping. It is found that the LD-like regions\nfully account for the orthorhombicity of the system, and are thus the origin of\nany static iron magnetism. Orthorhombicity and static magnetism are not\nhindered by superconductivity but limited by dilution effects, in agreement\nwith 2D (respectively 3D) nearest-neighbor square lattice site percolation when\nthe rare earth is nonmagnetic (respectively magnetic). The LD-like regions are\nnot intrinsically supportive of superconductivity, on the contrary of the\nHD-like regions, as evidenced by the well-defined Uemura relation between the\nsuperconducting transition temperature and the superfluid density when\naccounting for the proximity effect. This leads us to propose a complete\ndescription of the interplay of ground states in 1111 pnictides, where\nnanoscopic regions compete to establish the ground state through suppression of\nsuperconductivity by static magnetism, and extension of superconductivity by\nproximity effect.\n", "  Pre-gauging the cosmological scale factor $a(t)$ does not introduce\nunphysical degrees of freedom into the exact FLRW classical solution. It seems\nto lead, however, to a non-dynamical mini superspace. The missing ingredient, a\ngeneralised momentum enjoying canonical Dirac (rather than Poisson) brackets\nwith the lapse function $n(t)$, calls for measure scaling which can be realised\nby means of a scalar field. The latter is essential for establishing a\ngeometrical connection with the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein\nSchwarzschild-deSitter black hole. Contrary to the Hartle-Hawking approach, (i)\nThe $t$-independent wave function $\\psi(a)$ is traded for an explicit\n$t$-dependent $\\psi(n, t)$, (ii) The classical FLRW configuration does play a\nmajor role in the structure of the 'most classical' cosmological wave packet,\nand (iii) The non-singular Euclid/Lorentz crossovers get quantum mechanically\nsmeared.\n", "  While the existence of stable knotted and linked vortex lines has been\nestablished in many experimental and theoretical systems, their existence in\noscillatory systems and systems with nonlocal coupling has remained elusive.\nHere, we present strong numerical evidence that stable knots and links such as\ntrefoils and Hopf links do exist in simple, complex, and chaotic oscillatory\nsystems if the coupling between the oscillators is neither too short ranged nor\ntoo long ranged. In this case, effective repulsive forces between vortex lines\nin knotted and linked structures stabilize curvature-driven shrinkage observed\nfor single vortex rings. In contrast to real fluids and excitable media, the\nvortex lines correspond to scroll wave chimeras [synchronized scroll waves with\nspatially extended (tubelike) unsynchronized filaments], a prime example of\nspontaneous synchrony breaking in systems of identical oscillators. In the case\nof complex oscillatory systems, this leads to a novel topological\nsuperstructure combining knotted filaments and synchronization defect sheets.\n", "  We consider the prospects for the indirect detection of low mass dark matter\nwhich couples dominantly to quarks. If the center of mass energy is below about\n280 MeV, the kinematically allowed final states will be dominated by photons\nand neutral pions, producing striking signatures at gamma ray telescopes. In\nfact, an array of new instruments have been proposed, which would greatly\nimprove sensitivity to photons in this energy range. We find that planned\ninstruments can improve on current sensitivity to dark matter models of this\ntype by up to a few orders of magnitude.\n", "  We present closed-form analytic solutions to non-secular Bloch-Redfield\nmaster equations for quantum dynamics of a V-type system driven by weak\ncoupling to a thermal bath. We focus on noise-induced Fano coherences among the\nexcited states induced by incoherent driving of the V-system initially in the\nground state. For suddenly turned-on incoherent driving, the time evolution of\nthe coherences is determined by the damping parameter\n$\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2)/\\Delta_p$, where $\\gamma_i$ are the\nradiative decay rates of the excited levels $i=1,2$, and\n$\\Delta_p=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (1-p^2)\\gamma_1\\gamma_2}$ depends on the\nexcited-state level splitting $\\Delta>0$ and the angle between the transition\ndipole moments in the energy basis. The coherences oscillate as a function of\ntime in the underdamped limit ($\\zeta\\gg1$), approach a long-lived quasi-steady\nstate in the overdamped limit ($\\zeta\\ll 1$), and display an intermediate\nbehavior at critical damping ($\\zeta= 1$). The sudden incoherent turn-on\ngenerates a mixture of excited eigenstates $|e_1\\rangle$ and $|e_2\\rangle$ and\ntheir in-phase coherent superposition $|\\phi_+\\rangle =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\bar{r}}}(\\sqrt{r_1} |e_1\\rangle + \\sqrt{r_2}|e_2\\rangle)$,\nwhich is remarkably long-lived in the overdamped limit (where $r_1$ and $r_2$\nare the incoherent pumping rates). Formation of this coherent superposition\n{\\it enhances} the decay rate from the excited states to the ground state. In\nthe strongly asymmetric V-system where the coupling strengths between the\nground state and the excited states differ significantly, we identify\nadditional asymptotic quasistationary coherences, which arise due to slow\nequilibration of one of the excited states. Finally, we demonstrate that\nnoise-induced Fano coherences are maximized with respect to populations when\n$r_1=r_2$ and the transition dipole moments are fully aligned.\n", "  Using the idea of regularisation of singularities due to the variability of\nthe fundamental constants in cosmology we study the cyclic universe models. We\nfind two models of oscillating and non-singular mass density and pressure\n(\"non-singular\" bounce) regularised by varying gravitational constant $G$\ndespite the scale factor evolution is oscillating and having sharp turning\npoints (\"singular\" bounce). Both violating (big-bang) and non-violating\n(phantom) null energy condition models appear. Then, we extend this idea onto\nthe multiverse containing cyclic individual universes with either growing or\ndecreasing entropy though leaving the net entropy constant. In order to get an\ninsight into the key idea, we consider the doubleverse with the same\ngeometrical evolution of the two \"parallel\" universes with their physical\nevolution (physical coupling constants $c(t)$ and $G(t)$) being different. An\ninteresting point is that there is a possibility to exchange the universes at\nthe point of maximum expansion -- the fact which was already noticed in quantum\ncosmology. Similar scenario is also possible within the framework of\nBrans-Dicke theory where varying $G(t)$ is replaced by the dynamical\nBrans-Dicke field $\\phi(t)$ though these theories are slightly different.\n", "  We discuss (2+1)-dimensional gapless surface theories of bulk\n(3+1)-dimensional topological phases, such as the BF theory at level\n$\\mathrm{K}$, and its generalization. In particular, we put these theories on a\nflat (2+1) dimensional torus $T^3$ parameterized by its modular parameters, and\ncompute the partition functions obeying various twisted boundary conditions. We\nshow the partition functions are transformed into each other under\n$SL(3,\\mathbb{Z})$ modular transformations, and furthermore establish the\nbulk-boundary correspondence in (3+1) dimensions by matching the modular\n$\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ matrices computed from the boundary field\ntheories with those computed in the bulk. We also propose the three-loop\nbraiding statistics can be studied by constructing the modular $\\mathcal{S}$\nand $\\mathcal{T}$ matrices from an appropriate boundary field theory.\n", "  The problem of construction of a quantum master equation for a system of\nsites weakly coupled to each other and to one or more reservoirs (open quantum\nnetwork) is considered. Microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation\nrequires a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the network, which can be a\ndifficult task. When the inter-site couplings are weak, the local approach,\nwhich neglects the influence of the inter-site couplings on the\nsystem-reservoir couplings, is often used. Recently, some doubts were cast to\nthe consistency of the local approach. We develop a systematic perturbation\nexpansion to derive corrections to the local approach and establish its range\nof validity. Using this extension of the local approach, we derive an\nexpression for the heat flux for a particular model and show that it does not\nviolate the second law of thermodynamics.\n", "  An analytical approach is developed to the problem of computation of monotone\nRiemannian metrics (e.g. Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori, Bures, Chernoff, etc.) on the\nset of quantum states. The obtained expressions originate from the Morozova,\nChencov and Petz correspondence of monotone metrics to operator monotone\nfunctions. The used mathematical technique provides analytical expansions in\nterms of the thermodynamic mean values of iterated (nested) commutators of a\nmodel Hamiltonian T with the operator S involved through the control parameter\n$h$. Due to the sum rules for the frequency moments of the dynamic structure\nfactor new presentations for the monotone Riemannian metrics are obtained.\nParticularly, relations between any monotone Riemannian metric and the usual\nthermodynamic susceptibility or the variance of the operator $S$ are discussed.\nIf the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian are given in terms of generators\nof some Lie algebra, the obtained expansions may be evaluated in a closed form.\nThese issues are tested on a class of model systems studied in condensed matter\nphysics.\n", "  We study how the color and polarization of ultrashort pulses of visible light\ncan be used to control the demagnetization processes of the antiferromagnetic\ninsulator Cr$_2$O$_3$. We utilize time-resolved second harmonic generation\n(SHG) to probe how changes in the magnetic and structural state evolve in time.\nWe show that, varying the pump photon-energy to excite either localized\ntransitions within the Cr or charge transfer states, leads to markedly\ndifferent dynamics. Through a full polarization analysis of the SHG signal,\nsymmetry considerations and density functional theory calculations, we show\nthat, in the non-equilibrium state, SHG is sensitive to {\\em both} lattice\ndisplacements and changes to the magnetic order, which allows us to conclude\nthat different excited states couple to phonon modes of different symmetries.\nFurthermore, the spin-scattering rate depends on the induced distortion,\nenabling us to control the timescale for the demagnetization process. Our\nresults suggest that selective photoexcitation of antiferromagnetic insulators\nallows fast and efficient manipulation of their magnetic state.\n", "  Since 2010, the Yale physics department has offered a novel calculus-based\nintroductory physics for the life science (IPLS) sequence, that re-imagines the\nIPLS syllabus to include a selection of biologically and medically relevant\ntopics, that are highly meaningful to its audience of biological science and\npremedical undergraduates. The first semester, in particular, differs\nconsiderably from traditional first-semester introductory physics. Here, we\nhighlight the novel aspects of Yale's first-semester course, and describe\nstudent feedback about the course, including a comparison between how students\nevaluate the course and how they evaluate courses with a traditional syllabus,\nand how students' perceptions of the relevance of physics to biology and\nmedicine are affected by having taken the course.\n", "  How can relevant information be extracted from a quantum process? In many\nsituations, only some part of the total information content produced by an\ninformation source is useful. Can one then find an efficient encoding, in the\nsense of retaining the largest fraction of relevant information? This paper\noffers one possible solution by giving a generalization of a classical method\ndesigned to retain as much relevant information as possible in a lossy data\ncompression. A key feature of the method is to introduce a second information\nsource to define relevance. We quantify the advantage a quantum encoding has\nover the best classical encoding in general, and we demonstrate using examples\nthat a substantial quantum advantage is possible. A main result, however, is\nthat if the relevant information is purely classical, then a classical encoding\nis optimal.\n", "  I argue that feedback is as important to formation of planets as it is to\nformation of stars and galaxies. Energy released by massive solid cores puffs\nup pre-collapse gas giant planets, making them vulnerable to tidal disruptions\nby their host stars. I find that feedback is the ultimate reason for some of\nthe most robust properties of the observed exoplanet populations: the rarity of\ngas giants at all separations from $\\sim 0.1$ to $\\sim 100$~AU, the abundance\nof $\\sim 10 M_\\oplus$ cores but dearth of planets more massive than $\\sim 20\nM_\\oplus$. Feedback effects can also explain (i) rapid assembly of massive\ncores at large separations as needed for Uranus, Neptune and the suspected HL\nTau planets; (ii) the small core in Jupiter yet large cores in Uranus and\nNeptune; (iii) the existence of rare \"metal monster\" planets such as CoRoT-20b,\na gas giant made of heavy elements by up to $\\sim 50$\\%.\n", "  Impulsive optical excitation can generate both coherent and squeezed phonons.\nThe expectation value of the phonon displacement $<u_q>$ oscillates at the mode\nfrequency for the coherent state but remains zero for a pure squeezed state. In\ncontrast, both show oscillations in $<|u_q|^2>$ at twice the mode frequency.\nTherefore it can be difficult to distinguish them in a second-order measurement\nof the displacements, such as in first-order x-ray diffuse scattering. Here we\ndemonstrate a simple method to distinguish squeezed from coherent atomic motion\nby measurement of the diffuse scattering following double impulsive excitation.\nWe find that femtosecond optical excitation generates squeezed phonons spanning\nthe Brillouin zone in Ge, GaAs and InSb. Our results confirm the mechanism\nsuggested in [Nature Physics 9, 790 (2013)].\n", "  Quadratic convergence throughout the active space is achieved for the\ngradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) family of quantum optimal control\nalgorithms. We demonstrate in this communication that the Hessian of the GRAPE\nfidelity functional is unusually cheap, having the same asymptotic complexity\nscaling as the functional itself. This leads to the possibility of using very\nefficient numerical optimization techniques. In particular, the Newton-Raphson\nmethod with a rational function optimization (RFO) regularized Hessian is shown\nin this work to require fewer system trajectory evaluations than any other\nalgorithm in the GRAPE family. This communication describes algebraic and\nnumerical implementation aspects (matrix exponential recycling, Hessian\nregularization, etc.) for the RFO Newton-Raphson version of GRAPE and reports\nbenchmarks for common spin state control problems in magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We propose an open/closed string duality in general backgrounds extending\nprevious ideas about open string completeness by Ashoke Sen. Our proposal sets\nup a general version of holography that works in gravity as a tomographic\nprinciple. We argue, in particular, that previous expectations of a\nsupergravity/Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) correspondence are naturally embedded in\nthis conjecture and can be tested in a well-defined manner. As an example, we\nconsider the correspondence between open string field theories on extremal\nD-brane setups in flat space in the large-N, large 't Hooft limit, and\nasymptotically flat solutions in ten-dimensional type II supergravity. We focus\non a convenient long-wavelength regime, where specific effects of higher-spin\nopen string modes can be traced explicitly in the dual supergravity\ncomputation. For instance, in this regime we show how the full abelian DBI\naction arises from supergravity as a straightforward reformulation of\nrelativistic hydrodynamics. In the example of a (2+1)-dimensional open string\ntheory this reformulation involves an abelian Hodge duality. We also point out\nhow different deformations of the DBI action, related to higher-derivative\ncorrections and non-abelian effects, can arise in this context as deformations\nin corresponding relativistic hydrodynamics.\n", "  Thanks to the high sensitivity of the instruments on board the XMM-Newton and\nChandra satellites, it has become possible to explore the properties of the\nX-ray emission from hot subdwarfs. The small but growing sample of hot\nsubdwarfs detected in X-rays includes binary systems, in which the X-rays\nresult from wind accretion onto a compact companion (white dwarf or neutron\nstar), as well as isolated sdO stars in which X-rays are probably due to shock\ninstabilities in the wind. X-ray observations of these low mass stars provide\ninformation which can be useful also for our understanding of the winds of more\nluminous and massive early-type stars and can lead to the discovery of\nparticularly interesting binary systems.\n", "  While the emergent field of quantum thermodynamics has the potential to\nimpact energy science, the performance of thermal machines is often classical.\nWe ask whether quantum effects can boost the performance of a thermal machine\nto reach quantum supremacy, i.e., surpassing both the efficiency and power\nachieved in classical thermodynamics. To this end, we introduce a nonadiabatic\nquantum heat engine operating an Otto cycle with a many-particle working\nmedium, consisting of an interacting Bose gas confined in a time-dependent\nharmonic trap. It is shown that thanks to the interplay of nonadiabatic and\nmany-particle quantum effects, this thermal machine can outperform an ensemble\nof single-particle heat engines with same resources, demonstrating quantum\nsupremacy in many-particle thermal machines.\n", "  We recapitulate the primary sources of theoretical uncertainties in proton\nlifetime estimates in renormalizable, four-dimensional and non-supersymmetric\ngrand unifications that represent the most conservative framework in which this\nquestion may be addressed at the perturbative level. We point out that many of\nthese uncertainties are so severe that there are only very few scenarios in\nwhich an NLO approach, as crucial as it is for a real testability of any\nspecific model, is actually sensible. Among these, the most promising seems to\nbe the minimal renormalizable SO(10) GUT whose high-energy gauge symmetry is\nspontaneously broken by the adjoint and the five-index antisymmetric\nirreducible representations.\n", "  Topological states of electrons present new avenues to explore the rich\nphenomenology of correlated quantum matter. Topological insulators (TIs) in\nparticular offer an experimental setting to study novel quantum critical points\n(QCPs) of massless Dirac fermions, which exist on the sample's surface. Here,\nwe obtain exact results for the zero- and finite-temperature optical\nconductivity at the semimetal-superconductor QCP for these topological surface\nstates. This strongly interacting QCP is described by a scale invariant theory\nwith emergent supersymmetry, which is a unique symmetry mixing bosons and\nfermions. We show that supersymmetry implies exact relations between the\noptical conductivity and two otherwise unrelated properties: the shear\nviscosity and the entanglement entropy. We discuss experimental considerations\nfor the observation of these signatures in TIs.\n", "  The strong CP problem of QCD is at heart a problem of naturalness: why is the\nF\\tilde{F} term highly suppressed in the QCD Lagrangian when it seems necessary\nto explain why there are three and not four light pions? The most elegant\nsolution posits a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry which\nrequires the existence of the axion field a. The axion field settles to the\nminimum of its potential thus removing the offensive term but giving rise to\nthe physical axion whose coherent oscillations can make up the cold dark\nmatter. Only now are experiments such as ADMX beginning to explore QCD axion\nparameter space. Since a bonafide scalar particle-- the Higgs boson-- has been\ndiscovered, one might expect its mass to reside at the axion scale f_a~ 10^{11}\nGeV. The Higgs mass is elegantly stabilized by supersymmetry: in this case the\naxion is accompanied by its axino and saxion superpartners. Requiring\nnaturalness also in the electroweak sector implies higgsino-like WIMPs so then\nwe expect mixed axion-WIMP dark matter. Ultimately we would expect detection of\nboth an axion and a WIMP while signals for light higgsinos may show up at LHC\nand must show up at ILC.\n", "  In the present work, we theoretically demonstrate that near field radiative\ntransport between one dimensional periodic grating microstructures separated by\nnanometer vacuum gaps can be spectrally enhanced by exciting magnetic\npolariton. Fluctuational electrodynamics that incorporates scattering matrix\ntheory with rigorous coupled wave analysis is employed to exactly calculate the\nnear field radiative flux between two gold gratings. Besides the well known\ncoupled surface plasmon polaritons, the radiative flux can be also spectrally\nenhanced due to magnetic polariton, which is excited in the gap between gold\nridges. The mechanisms of magnetic polariton in the near field radiative\ntransport are elucidated in detail, while the unusual enhancement cannot be\npredicted by either the Derjaguin or effective medium approximations. The\neffects of vacuum gap distance and grating geometry parameters between the two\ngratings are investigated. The findings will open up a new way to control near\nfield radiative transfer by magnetic polariton with micro or nanostructured\nmetamaterials.\n", "  Ultra-luminous X-ray sources are usually believed to be black holes with mass\nabout $10^{2-3}M_{\\odot}$. However, the recent discovery of NuSTAR\nJ095551+6940.8 in M82 by Bachetti et al. shows that it holds the spin period\n$P=1.37\\rm\\,s$ and period {\\bf derivative}\n$\\dot{P}\\approx-2\\times10^{-10}\\rm\\,s\\,s^{-1}$, which provides a strong\nevidence that some ultra-luminous X-ray sources could be neutron stars. We\nobtain that the source may be an evolved magetar, according to our simulation\nby employing the model of accretion induced the polar magnetic field decay and\nstandard spin-up torque of an accreting neutron star. The results show that\nNuSTAR J095551+6940.8 is still in the spin-up process, and the polar magnetic\nfield decays to about $4.5\\times10^{12}\\rm\\,G$ after accreting $\\sim\n10^{-2.5}$\\ms, while the strong magnetic field exists in the out-polar region,\nwhich could be responsible for the observed low field magnetar. The ultra\nluminosity of the source can be explained by the beaming effort and two kinds\nof accretion--radial random accretion and disk accretion. Since the birth rate\nof magnetars is about ten percent of the normal neutron stars, we guess that\nseveral ultra-luminous X-ray sources should share the similar properties to\nthat of NuSTAR J095551+6940.8.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a non-Abelian spin-1 chiral spin liquid state\nproposed by Greiter and Thomale [PRL 102, 207203 (2009)] using variational\nMonte Carlo. In this state the bosonic $\\nu = 1$ Moore-Read Pfaffian wave\nfunction is used to describe a gas of bosonic spin flips on a square lattice\nwith one flux quantum per plaquette. For toroidal geometries there is a\nthree-dimensional space of these states corresponding to the topological\ndegeneracy of the bosonic Moore-Read state on the torus. We show that spin\ncorrelations for different states in this space become indistinguishable for\nlarge system size. We also calculate the Renyi entanglement entropy for\ndifferent system partitions to extract the topological entanglement entropy and\nprovide evidence that the topological order of the lattice spin-liquid state is\nthe same as that of the continuum Moore-Read state from which it is\nconstructed.\n", "  The density field reconstruction technique, which was developed to partially\nreverse the nonlinear degradation of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)\nfeature in the galaxy redshift surveys, has been successful in substantially\nimproving the cosmology constraints from recent galaxy surveys such as Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We estimate the efficiency of the\nreconstruction method as a function of various reconstruction details. To\ndirectly quantify the BAO information in nonlinear density fields before and\nafter reconstruction, we calculate the cross-correlations (i.e., propagators)\nof the pre(post)-reconstructed density field with the initial linear field\nusing a mock galaxy sample that is designed to mimic the clustering of the BOSS\nCMASS galaxies. The results directly provide the BAO damping as a function of\nwavenumber that can be implemented into the Fisher matrix analysis. We focus on\ninvestigating the dependence of the propagator on a choice of smoothing filters\nand on two major different conventions of the redshift-space density field\nreconstruction that have been used in literature. By estimating the BAO\nsignal-to-noise for each case, we predict constraints on the angular diameter\ndistance and Hubble parameter using the Fisher matrix analysis. We thus\ndetermine an optimal Gaussian smoothing filter scale for the signal-to-noise\nlevel of the BOSS CMASS. We also present appropriate BAO fitting models for\ndifferent reconstruction methods based on the first and second order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory in Fourier space. Using the mock data, we show that the\nmodified BAO fitting model can substantially improve the accuracy of the BAO\nposition in the best fits as well as the goodness of the fits.\n", "  We propose a setup that integrates a quantum point contact (QPC) and a\nJosephson junction on a quantum spin Hall sample, experimentally realizable in\nInAs/GaSb quantum wells. The confinement due to both the QPC and the\nsuperconductor results in a Kramers pair of Majorana zero-energy bound states\nwhen the superconducting phases in the two arms differ by an odd multiple of\n$\\pi$ across the Josephson junction. We investigate the detection of these\nMajorana pairs with the integrated QPC, and find a robust switching from normal\nto Andreev scattering across the edges due to the presence of Majorana Kramers\npairs. This transport signature is expected to be exhibited in measurements of\ndifferential conductance and/or current cross-correlation at low bias.\n", "  The ultra-fast demagnetization of small iron clusters initiated by an intense\noptical excitation is studied with time-dependent spin density functional\ntheory (TDSDFT). In particular we investigate the effect of the spin-orbit\ninteraction on the onset of the demagnetization process. It is found that the\ninitial rate of coherent spin loss is proportional to the square of the atomic\nspin-orbit coupling constant, $\\lambda$. A simplified quantum spin model\ncomprising spin-orbit interaction and a local time-dependent magnetic field is\nfound to be the minimal model able to reproduce our {\\it ab initio} results.\nThe model predicts the $\\lambda^2$ dependence of the onset rate of\ndemagnetization when it is solved either numerically or analytically in the\nlinear response limit. Our findings are supported by additional TDSDFT\nsimulations of clusters made of Co and Ni.\n", "  Interactions between many-body atomic systems in optical lattices and light\nin cavities induce long-range and correlated atomic dynamics beyond the\nstandard Bose-Hubbard model, due to the global nature of the light modes. We\ncharacterise these processes, and show that uniting such phenomena with\ndynamical constraints enforced by the backaction resultant from strong light\nmeasurement leads to a synergy that enables the atomic dynamics to be tailored,\nbased on the particular optical geometry, exploiting the additional structure\nimparted by the quantum light field. This leads to a range of tunable effects\nsuch as long-range density-density interactions, perfectly correlated atomic\ntunnelling, superexchange, and effective pair processes. We further show that\nthis provides a framework for enhancing quantum simulations to include such\nlong-range and correlated processes, including reservoir models and dynamical\nglobal gauge fields.\n", "  We present the results of a study which uses spectral energy distribution\n(SED) fitting to investigate the evolution of the equivalent width (EW) of the\nHalpha emission line in star-forming galaxies over the redshift interval 1<z<5.\nAfter first demonstrating the ability of our SED-fitting technique to recover\nEW(Ha) using a sample of galaxies at z~1.3 with EW(Ha) measurements from 3D-HST\ngrism spectroscopy, we proceed to apply our technique to samples of\nspectroscopically confirmed and photometric-redshift selected star-forming\ngalaxies at z>=1 in the CANDELS UDS and GOODS-S fields. Confining our analysis\nto a constant stellar mass range (9.5<log(M/Msun)<10.5), we find that the\nmedian EW(Ha) evolves only modestly with redshift, reaching a rest-frame value\nof EW(Ha)=301+/-30 Angs by redshift z~4.5. Furthermore, using estimates of\nstar-formation rate (SFR) based on both UV luminosity and Ha line flux, we use\nour galaxy samples to compare the evolution of EW(Ha) and specific\nstar-formation rate (sSFR). Our results indicate that over the redshift range\n1<z<5, the evolution displayed by EW(Ha) and sSFR is consistent, and can be\nadequately parameterized as: propto (1+z)^(1.0+/-0.2). As a consequence, over\nthis redshift range we find that the sSFR and rest-frame EW(Ha) of star-forming\ngalaxies with stellar masses M~10^(10) Msun are related by:\nEW(Ha)/Ang=(63+/-7)sSFR/Gyr^(-1). Given the current uncertainties in measuring\nthe SFRs of high-redshift galaxies, we conclude that EW(Ha) provides a useful\nindependent tracer of sSFR for star-forming galaxies out to redshifts of z=5.\n", "  We study the chiral phase transition in the presence of the chiral chemical\npotential $\\mu_5$ using the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. In\nparticular, we analyze the reason why one can obtain two opposite behaviors of\nthe chiral critical temperature as a function of $\\mu_5$ in the framework of\ndifferent regularization schemes. We compare the modifications of the chiral\ncondensate and the critical temperature due to $\\mu_5$ in different\nregularization schemes, analytically and numerically. Finally, we find that,\nfor the conventional hard-cutoff regularization scheme, the increasing\ndependence of the critical temperature on the chiral chemical potential is an\nartifact, which is caused by the fact that it does not include complete\ncontribution from the thermal fluctuations. When the thermal contribution is\nfully taken into account, the chiral critical temperature should decrease with\n$\\mu_5$.\n", "  By using specially designed nanoparticles scatterers which prevents\nphotodegradation of the dye, we present clear demonstration of replica symmetry\nbreak and a photonic paramagnetic to spin-glass phase transition in a random\nlaser operating in the incoherent feedback regime based on ethanol solution of\nRhodamine 6G and amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles.\n", "  We present Herschel observations of 22 radio galaxies, selected for the\npresence of shocked, warm molecular hydrogen emission. We measured and modeled\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) in 33 bands from the ultraviolet to the\nfar-infrared to investigate the impact of jet feedback on star formation\nactivity. These galaxies are massive, early-type galaxies with normal\ngas-to-dust ratios, covering a range of optical and infrared colors. We find\nthat the star formation rate (SFR) is suppressed by a factor of ~3-6, depending\non how molecular gas mass is estimated. We suggest this suppression is due to\nthe shocks driven by the radio jets injecting turbulence into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM), which also powers the luminous warm H2 line emission.\nApproximately 25% of the sample shows suppression by more than a factor of 10.\nHowever, the degree of SFR suppression does not correlate with indicators of\njet feedback including jet power, diffuse X-ray emission, or intensity of warm\nmolecular H2 emission, suggesting that while injected turbulence likely impacts\nstar formation, the process is not purely parameterized by the amount of\nmechanical energy dissipated into the ISM. Radio galaxies with shocked warm\nmolecular gas cover a wide range in SFR-stellar mass space, indicating that\nthese galaxies are in a variety of evolutionary states, from actively\nstar-forming and gas-rich to quiescent and gas-poor. SFR suppression appears to\nhave the largest impact on the evolution of galaxies that are moderately\ngas-rich.\n", "  Skew scattering on rare impurity configurations is shown to dominate the\nanomalous Hall effect in a 2D Rashba ferromagnet. The mechanism originates in\nscattering on rare impurity pairs separated by distances of the order of the\nFermi wave length. Corresponding theoretical description goes beyond the\nconventional non-crossing approximation. The mechanism provides the only\ncontribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity in the most relevant metallic\nregime and strongly modifies previously obtained results for lower energies in\nthe leading order with respect to impurity strength.\n", "  The velocity structure imprinted in the H{\\alpha} emission line profiles\ncontains valuable information about galactic outflows. Using a set of\nhigh-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations of galaxies at z=2, we\ngenerate H{\\alpha} emission line profiles, taking into account the\ntemperature-dependent H{\\alpha} emissivity, as well as dust extinction. The\nH{\\alpha} line can be described as a sum of two gaussians, as typically done\nwith observations. In general, its properties are in good agreement with those\nobserved in local isolated galaxies with similar masses and star formation\nrates, assuming a spatially constant clumping factor of c=24. Blueshifted\noutflows are very common in the sample. They extend several kpc above the\ngalaxy discs. They are also spread over the full extent of the discs. However,\nat small radii, the material with high velocities tends to remain confined\nwithin a thick disc, as part of galactic fountains or a turbulent medium, most\nprobably due to the deeper gravitational potential at the galaxy centre.\n", "  In realistic nanoelectronics, disordered impurities/defects are inevitable\nand play important roles in electron transport. However, due to the lack of\neffective quantum transport method to do disorder average, the important\neffects of disorders remain largely un-explored or poorly understood. Here, we\nreport a generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction method with coherent\npotential approximation for the non-equilibrium quantum transport simulation of\ndisordered nanoelectronics. In this method, the disorder average of various\nGreen's functions are computed by a generalized coherent potential\napproximation. A generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction algorithm is\nthen developed to calculate disorder average of the product of any two real\ntime single-particle Green's functions. We obtain nine non-equilibrium vertex\ncorrections and find they can be solved by a set of simple linear equations. As\na result, the averaged non-equilibrium density matrix and various important\ntransport properties, including averaged current, disordered induced current\nfluctuation and the averaged shot noise, can all be efficiently computed in a\nunified simple scheme. Moreover, the relationship between the non-equilibrium\nvertex correction method and the non-equilibrium coherent potential\napproximation theory is clarified, and we prove the non-equilibrium coherent\npotential equals the non-equilibrium vertex correction and this equivalence is\nguaranteed by the Keldysh's formulas. In addition, a generalized form of\nconditionally averaged non-equilibrium Green's function is derived to\nincorporate with density functional theory to enable first-principles quantum\ntransport simulation. Our approach provides a unified, efficient and\nself-consistent method for simulating non-equilibrium quantum transport through\ndisordered nanoelectronics.\n", "  The interdependence of luminosity distance, $D_L$ and angular diameter\ndistance, $D_A$ given by the distance duality relation (DDR) is very\nsignificant in observational cosmology. It is very closely tied with the\ntemperature- redshift relation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.\nAny deviation from $\\eta(z)\\equiv \\frac{D_L}{D_A (1+z)^2} =1$ indicates a\npossible emergence of new physics. Our aim in this work is to check the\nconsistency of these relations using a non-parametric regression method namely,\nLOESS with SIMEX. This technique avoids dependency on the cosmological model\nand works with a minimal set of assumptions. Further, to analyze the efficiency\nof the methodology, we simulate a dataset of $200$ points of $\\eta (z)$ data\nbased on a phenomenological model $\\eta(z)= (1+z)^\\epsilon$. The error on the\nsimulated data points is obtained by using the temperature of CMB radiation at\nvarious redshifts. For testing the distance duality relation, we use the JLA\nSNe Ia data for luminosity distances, while the angular diameter distances are\nobtained from radio galaxies datasets. Since the DDR is linked with CMB\ntemperature - redshift relation, therefore we also use the CMB temperature data\nto reconstruct $\\eta (z)$. It is important to note that with CMB data, we are\nable to study the evolution of DDR up to a very high redshift $ z = 2.418$. In\nthis analysis, we find no evidence of deviation from $\\eta=1$ within a\n$1\\sigma$ region in the entire redshift range used in this analysis ($0 < z\n\\leq 2.418$).\n", "  We investigate the instability of classical Yang-Mills field in an expanding\ngeometry under a color magnetic background field within the linear regime. We\nconsider homogeneous, boost-invariant and time-dependent color magnetic fields\nsimulating the glasma configuration. We introduce the conformal coordinates\nwhich enable us to map an expanding problem approximately into a nonexpanding\nproblem. We find that the fluctuations with finite longitudinal momenta can\ngrow exponentially due to parametric instability. Fluctuations with finite\ntransverse momenta can also show parametric instability, but their momenta are\nrestricted to be small. The most unstable modes start to grow exponentially in\nthe early stage of the dynamics and they may affect the thermalization in\nheavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We realize a single particle microscope by using deterministically extracted\nlaser cooled $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions from a Paul trap as probe particles for\ntransmission imaging. We demonstrate focusing of the ions with a resolution of\n5.8$\\;\\pm\\;$1.0$\\,$nm and a minimum two-sample deviation of the beam position\nof 1.5$\\,$nm in the focal plane. The deterministic source, even when used in\ncombination with an imperfect detector, gives rise to much higher signal to\nnoise ratios as compared with conventional Poissonian sources. Gating of the\ndetector signal by the extraction event suppresses dark counts by 6 orders of\nmagnitude. We implement a Bayes experimental design approach to microscopy in\norder to maximize the gain in spatial information. We demonstrate this method\nby determining the position of a 1$\\,\\mu$m circular hole structure to an\naccuracy of 2.7$\\,$nm using only 579 probe particles.\n", "  Evidences for late-time acceleration of the Universe are provided by multiple\nprobes, such as Type Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and\nlarge-scale structure (LSS). In this work, we focus on the integrated\nSachs--Wolfe (ISW) effect, i.e., secondary CMB fluctuations generated by\nevolving gravitational potentials due to the transition between, e.g., the\nmatter and dark energy (DE) dominated phases. Therefore, assuming a flat\nuniverse, DE properties can be inferred from ISW detections. We present a\nBayesian approach to compute the CMB--LSS cross-correlation signal. The method\nis based on the estimate of the likelihood for measuring a combined set\nconsisting of a CMB temperature and a galaxy contrast maps, provided that we\nhave some information on the statistical properties of the fluctuations\naffecting these maps. The likelihood is estimated by a sampling algorithm,\ntherefore avoiding the computationally demanding techniques of direct\nevaluation in either pixel or harmonic space. As local tracers of the matter\ndistribution at large scales, we used the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\ngalaxy catalog and, for the CMB temperature fluctuations, the ninth-year data\nrelease of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9). The results show a\ndominance of cosmic variance over the weak recovered signal, due mainly to the\nshallowness of the catalog used, with systematics associated with the sampling\nalgorithm playing a secondary role as sources of uncertainty. When combined\nwith other complementary probes, the method presented in this paper is expected\nto be a useful tool to late-time acceleration studies in cosmology.\n", "  We consider a boundary value problem for the Dirac equation in a smooth,\nasymptotically flat Lorentzian manifold admitting a Killing field which is\ntimelike near and tangential to the boundary. A self-adjoint extension of the\nDirac Hamiltonian is constructed. Our results also apply to the situation that\nthe space-time includes horizons, where the Hamiltonian fails to be elliptic.\n", "  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) harbors a rich and diverse system of star\nclusters, whose ages, chemical abundances, and positions provide information\nabout the LMC history of star formation. We use Science Verification imaging\ndata from the Dark Energy Survey to increase the census of known star clusters\nin the outer LMC and to derive physical parameters for a large sample of such\nobjects using a spatially and photometrically homogeneous data set. Our sample\ncontains 255 visually identified cluster candidates, of which 109 were not\nlisted in any previous catalog. We quantify the crowding effect for the stellar\nsample produced by the DES Data Management pipeline and conclude that the\nstellar completeness is < 10% inside typical LMC cluster cores. We therefore\ndevelop a pipeline to sample and measure stellar magnitudes and positions\naround the cluster candidates using DAOPHOT. We also implement a\nmaximum-likelihood method to fit individual density profiles and\ncolour-magnitude diagrams. For 117 (from a total of 255) of the cluster\ncandidates (28 uncatalogued clusters), we obtain reliable ages, metallicities,\ndistance moduli and structural parameters, confirming their nature as physical\nsystems. The distribution of cluster metallicities shows a radial dependence,\nwith no clusters more metal-rich than [Fe/H] ~ -0.7 beyond 8 kpc from the LMC\ncenter. The age distribution has two peaks at ~ 1.2 Gyr and ~ 2.7 Gyr.\n", "  The pseudo-spin dynamics of propagating exciton-polaritons in semiconductor\nmicrocavities are known to be strongly influenced by TE-TM splitting. As a\nvivid consequence, in the Rayleigh scattering regime, the TE-TM splitting gives\nrise to the optical spin Hall effect (OSHE). Much less is known about its role\nin the nonlinear optical regime in which four-wave mixing for example allows\nthe formation of spatial patterns in the polariton density, such that hexagons\nand two-spot patterns are observable in the far field. Here we present a\ndetailed analysis of spin-dependent four-wave mixing processes, by combining\nthe (linear) physics of TE-TM splitting with spin-dependent nonlinear\nprocesses, i.e., exciton-exciton interaction and fermionic phase-space filling.\nOur combined theoretical and experimental study elucidates the complex physics\nof the four-wave mixing processes that govern polarization and orientation of\noff-axis modes.\n", "  A \"chimera state\" is a dynamical pattern that occurs in a network of coupled\nidentical oscillators when the symmetry of the oscillator population is broken\ninto synchronous and asynchronous parts. We report the experimental observation\nof chimera and cluster states in a network of four globally coupled chaotic\nopto-electronic oscillators. This is the minimal network that can support\nchimera states, and our study provides new insight into the fundamental\nmechanisms underlying their formation. We use a unified approach to determine\nthe stability of all the observed partially synchronous patterns, highlighting\nthe close relationship between chimera and cluster states as belonging to the\nbroader phenomenon of partial synchronization. Our approach is general in terms\nof network size and connectivity. We also find that chimera states often appear\nin regions of multistability between global, cluster, and desynchronized\nstates.\n", "  We study the dynamics of coupled phase oscillators on a two-dimensional\nKuramoto lattice with periodic boundary conditions. For coupling strengths just\nbelow the transition to global phase-locking, we find localized spatiotemporal\npatterns that we call \"frequency spirals.\" These patterns cannot be seen under\ntime averaging; they become visible only when we examine the spatial variation\nof the oscillators' instantaneous frequencies, where they manifest themselves\nas two-armed rotating spirals. In the more familiar phase representation, they\nappear as wobbly periodic patterns surrounding a phase vortex. Unlike the\nstationary phase vortices seen in magnetic spin systems, or the rotating spiral\nwaves seen in reaction-diffusion systems, frequency spirals librate: the phases\nof the oscillators surrounding the central vortex move forward and then\nbackward, executing a periodic motion with zero winding number. We construct\nthe simplest frequency spiral and characterize its properties using analytical\nand numerical methods. Simulations show that frequency spirals in large\nlattices behave much like this simple prototype.\n", "  In this work the collective modes of an effective kinetic theory description\nbased on the Boltzmann equation in relaxation time approximation applicable to\ngauge theories at weak but finite coupling and low frequencies are studied.\nReal time retarded two-point correlators of the energy-momentum tensor and the\nR-charge current are calculated at finite temperature in flat space-times for\nlarge N gauge theories. It is found that the real time correlators possess\nlogarithmic branch cuts which in the limit of large coupling disappear and give\nrise to non-hydrodynamic poles that are reminiscent of quasi-normal modes in\nblack holes. In addition to branch cuts, correlators can have simple\nhydrodynamic poles, generalizing the concept of hydrodynamic modes to\nintermediate wavelength. Surprisingly, the hydrodynamic poles cease to exist\nfor some critical value of the wavelength and coupling reminiscent of the\nproperties of onset transitions.\n", "  The entanglement properties of quenched quantum systems have been studied for\na decade, however results in dimensions other than $d=1$ are generally lacking.\nWe remedy this by investigating the entanglement properties of bosonic critical\nsystems in $d=3$, both numerically and analytically, comparing the free and the\ninteracting critical quench of an $O(N)$ model. We find that the evolution of\nthe entanglement entropy for these two systems is nearly identical, as expected\nfrom the \"quasi-particle\" picture. However, the low-lying entanglement spectrum\nis controlled by the different critical exponent of the two systems, and\ntherefore these exponents may be extracted by purely entanglement-theoretic\ncalculations. We verify this scaling numerically.\n", "  For O(4)-symmetric instantons, there are two complementary interpretations\nfor their analytic continuations. One is the nothing-to-something\ninterpretation, where the initial and final hypersurfaces are disconnected by\nEuclidean manifolds. The other is the something-to-something interpretation,\nintroduced by Brown and Weinberg, where the initial and final hypersurfaces are\nconnected by the Euclidean manifold. These interpretations have their own pros\nand cons and hence they are complementary. In this paper, we consider analytic\ncontinuations of thin-shell instantons that have less symmetry, i.e., the\nspherical symmetry. When we consider the\nFarhi-Guth-Guven/Fischler-Morgan-Polchinski tunneling, the\nsomething-to-something interpretation has been used in the usual literature. On\nthe other hand, we can apply the nothing-to-something interpretation with some\nlimited conditions. We argue that for both interpretations, we can give the\nconsistent decay rate. As we apply and interpret what follows the\nnothing-to-something interpretation, a stationary black hole can emit an\nexpanding shell that results in a spacetime without a singularity or event\nhorizon.\n", "  Recent numerical simulations suggest that the model by Zahn (1992, A&A, 265,\n115) for the turbulent mixing of chemical elements due to differential rotation\nin stellar radiative zones is valid.\n  We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the numerical\nconfiguration and Reynolds number of the flow.\n  We compare results from simulations performed with two different numerical\ncodes, including one that uses the shearing-box formalism. We also extensively\nstudy the dependence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient on the turbulent\nReynolds number.\n  The two numerical codes used in this study give consistent results. The\nturbulent diffusion coefficient is independent of the size of the numerical\ndomain if at least three large turbulent structures fit in the box. Generally,\nthe turbulent diffusion coefficient depends on the turbulent Reynolds number.\nHowever, our simulations suggest that an asymptotic regime is obtained when the\nturbulent Reynolds number is larger than $10^3$.\n  Shear mixing in the regime of small P\\'eclet numbers can be investigated\nnumerically both with shearing-box simulations and simulations using explicit\nforcing. Our results suggest that Zahn's model is valid at large turbulent\nReynolds numbers.\n", "  The search for metallic boron allotropes has attracted great attention in the\npast decades and recent theoretical works predict the existence of metallicity\nin monolayer boron. Here, we synthesize the \\b{eta}12-sheet monolayer boron on\na Ag(111) surface and confirm the presence of metallic boron-derived bands\nusing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The Fermi surface is composed\nof one electron pocket at the S point and a pair of hole pockets near the X\npoint, which is supported by the first-principles calculations. The metallic\nboron allotrope in \\b{eta}12 sheet opens the way to novel physics and chemistry\nin material science.\n", "  The broad-band variability of many accreting systems displays characteristic\nstructure; log-normal flux distributions, RMS-flux relations, and long\ninter-band lags. These characteristics are usually interpreted as inward\npropagating fluctuations in an accretion disk driven by stochasticity of the\nangular momentum transport mechanism. We present the first analysis of\npropagating fluctuations in a long-duration, high-resolution, global\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a geometrically-thin\n($h/r\\approx0.1$) accretion disk around a black hole. While the\ndynamical-timescale turbulent fluctuations in the Maxwell stresses are too\nrapid to drive radially-coherent fluctuations in the accretion rate, we find\nthat the low-frequency quasi-periodic dynamo action introduces low-frequency\nfluctuations in the Maxwell stresses which then drive the propagating\nfluctuations. Examining both the mass accretion rate and emission proxies, we\nrecover log-normality, linear RMS-flux relations, and radial coherence that\nwould produce inter-band lags. Hence, we successful relate and connect the\nphenomenology of propagating fluctuations to modern MHD accretion disk theory.\n", "  We present a new theoretical population synthesis model (the Galaxy Model) to\nexamine and deal with large amounts of data from surveys of the Milky Way and\nto decipher the present and past structure and history of our own Galaxy. We\nassume the Galaxy to consist of a superposition of many composite stellar\npopulations belonging to the thin and thick disks, the stellar halo and the\nbulge, and to be surrounded by a single dark matter halo component. A global\nmodel for the Milky Way's gravitational potential is built up self-consistently\nwith the density profiles from the Poisson equation. In turn, these density\nprofiles are used to generate synthetic probability distribution functions\n(PDFs) for the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).\nFinally, the gravitational potential is used to constrain the stellar\nkinematics by means of the moment method on a (perturbed)-distribution\nfunction. Spiral arms perturb the axisymmetric disk distribution functions in\nthe linear response framework of density-wave theory where we present an\nanalytical formula of the so-called `reduction factor' using Hypergeometric\nfunctions. Finally, we consider an analytical non-axisymmetric model of\nextinction and an algorithm based on the concept of probability distribution\nfunction to handle colour magnitude diagrams with a large number of stars. A\ngenetic algorithm is presented to investigate both the photometric and\nkinematic parameter space. This galaxy model represents the natural framework\nto reconstruct the structure of the Milky Way from the heterogeneous data set\nof surveys such as Gaia-ESO, SEGUE, APOGEE2, RAVE and the Gaia mission.\n", "  Using density functional theory plus self-consistent Hubbard $U$\n(DFT$+U_{sc}$) calculations, we have investigated the structural and electronic\nproperties of the rare-earth cobaltites \\textit{R}CoO$_3$ (\\textit{R} = Pr --\nLu). Our calculations show the evolution of crystal and electronic structure of\nthe insulating low-spin (LS) \\textit{R}CoO$_3$ with increasing rare-earth\natomic number (decreasing ionic radius), including the invariance of the Co-O\nbond distance ($d_{Co-O}$), the decrease of the Co-O-Co bond angle ($\\Theta$),\nand the increase of the crystal field splitting ($\\Delta_{CF}$) and band gap\nenergy ($E_g$). Agreement with experiment for the latter improves considerably\nwith the use of DFT$+U_{sc}$ and all trends are in good agreement with\nexperimental data. These trends enable a direct test of prior rationalizations\nof the trend in spin-gap associated with the spin crossover in this series,\nwhich is found to expose significant issues with simple band based arguments.\nWe also examine the effect of placing the rare-earth \\textit{f}-electrons in\nthe core region of the pseudopotential. The effect on lattice parameters and\nband structure is found to be small, but distinct for the special case of\n\\textit{Pr}CoO$_3$ where some \\textit{f}-states populate the middle of the gap,\nconsistent with recent reports of unique behavior in Pr-containing cobaltites.\nOverall, this study establishes a foundation for future predictive studies of\nthermally induced spin excitations in rare-earth cobaltites and similar\nsystems.\n", "  Long considered as the \"odd man out\" among X-ray emitting Be stars, \\gamma\nCas (B0.5e IV) is now recognized as the prototype of a class of stars that emit\nhard thermal X-rays. Our classification differs from the historical use of the\nterm \"gamma Cas stars\" defined from optical properties alone. The luminosity\noutput of this class contributes significantly to the hard X-ray production in\nmassive stars in the Galaxy. The gamma Cas stars have light curves showing\nvariability on a few broadly-defined timescales and spectra indicative of an\noptically thin plasma consisting of one or more hot thermal components. By now\n9--13 Galactic \\approx B0-1.5e main sequence stars are judged to be members or\ncandidate members of the \\gamma Cas class. Conservative criteria for this\ndesignation are for a \\approxB0-1.5e III-V star to have an X-ray luminosity of\n10^{32}--10^{33} ergs s^{-1}, a hot thermal spectrum containing the short\nwavelength Ly \\alpha FeXXV and FeXXVI lines and the fluorescence FeK feature\nall in emission. If thermality cannot be demonstrated, for example from either\nthe presence of these Ly \\alpha lines or curvature of the hard continuum; these\nare the gamma Cas candidates. We discuss the history of the discovery of the\ncomplicated characteristics of the variability in the optical, UV, and X-ray\ndomains, leading to suggestions for the physical cause of the production of\nhard X-rays. These include scenarios in which matter from the Be star accretes\nonto a degenerate secondary star and interactions between magnetic fields on\nthe Be star and its decretion disk. The greatest aid to the choice of the\ncausal mechanism is the temporal correlations of X-ray light curves and spectra\nwith diagnostics in the optical and UV wavebands. We show why the magnetic\nstar-disk interaction scenario is the most tenable explanation for the creation\nof hard X-rays on these stars.\n", "  We study the asymptotic response of polar ordered active fluids (\"flocks\") to\nsmall external aligning fields $h$. The longitudinal susceptibility\n$\\chi_{_\\parallel}$ diverges, in the thermodynamic limit, like $h^{-\\nu}$ as $h\n\\rightarrow 0$. In finite systems of linear size $L$, $\\chi_{_\\parallel}$\nsaturates to a value $\\sim L^\\gamma$. The universal exponents $\\nu$ and\n$\\gamma$ depend only on the spatial dimensionality $d$, and are related to the\ndynamical exponent $z$ and the \"roughness exponent\" $\\alpha$ characterizing the\nunperturbed flock dynamics. Using a well supported conjecture for the values of\nthese two exponents, we obtain $\\nu = 2/3$, $\\gamma = 4/5$ in $d = 2$ and $\\nu\n= 1/4$, $\\gamma = 2/5$ in $d = 3$. These values are confirmed by our\nsimulations.\n", "  We study the many-body physics of different quantum systems using a hierarchy\nof correlations, which corresponds to a generalization of the $1/\\mathcal{Z}$\nhierarchy. The decoupling scheme obtained from this hierarchy is adapted to\ncalculate double-time Green's functions, and due to its non-perturbative\nnature, we describe quantum phase transition and topological features\ncharacteristic of strongly correlated phases. As concrete examples we consider\nspinless fermions in a dimers chain and in a honeycomb lattice. We present\nanalytical results which are valid for any dimension and can be generalized to\ndifferent types of interactions (e.g., long range interactions), which allows\nus to shed light on the effect of quantum correlations in a very systematic\nway. Furthermore, we show that this approach provides an efficient framework\nfor the calculation of topological invariants in interacting systems.\n", "  Radiative $\\bar{B}^0(\\bar{B}^0_s)\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\gamma$ decays provide an\ninteresting case to test our understanding of (non)perturbative QCD and\neventually to probe physics beyond the standard model. Recently, the LHCb\nCollaboration has reported an upper bound, updating the results of the BABAR\nCollaboration. Previous theoretical predictions based on QCD factorization or\nperturbative QCD have shown large variations due to different treatment of\nnonfactorizable contributions and meson-photon transitions. In this paper, we\nreport on a novel approach to estimate the decay rates, which is based on a\nrecently proposed model for $B$ decays and the vector meson dominance\nhypothesis, widely tested in the relevant energy regions. The predicted\nbranching ratios are $\\mathrm{Br}[\\bar{B}^0\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\gamma]=\\left(3.50\\pm0.34^{+1.12}_{-0.63}\\right)\\times10^{-8}$ and\n$\\mathrm{Br}[\\bar{B}^0_s\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\gamma]=\\left(7.20\\pm0.68^{+2.31}_{-1.30}\\right)\\times10^{-7}$. The first\nuncertainty is systematic and the second is statistical, originating from the\nexperimental $\\bar{B}^0_s\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi$ branching ratio.\n", "  If local supersymmetry is the correct extension of the standard model of\nparticle physics, then following Inflation the early universe would have been\npopulated by gravitinos produced from scatterings in the hot plasma during\nreheating. Their abundance is directly related to the magnitude of the\nreheating temperature. The gravitino lifetime is fixed as a function of its\nmass, and for gravitinos with lifetimes longer than the age of the universe at\nredshift $z\\simeq 2\\times 10^{6}$ (or roughly $6\\times 10^6{\\rm s}$), decay\nproducts can produce spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background.\nCurrently available COBE/FIRAS limits on spectral distortion can, in certain\ncases, already be competitive with respect to cosmological constraints from\nprimordial nucleosynthesis for some gravitino decay scenarios. We show how the\nsensitivity limits on $\\mu$ and $y$ distortions that can be reached with\ncurrent technology would improve constraints and possibly rule out a\nsignificant portion of the parameter space for gravitino masses and Inflation\nreheating temperatures.\n", "  By considering the behavior of the reduced action under the scaling\ntransformation, we present a unified derivation of the Smarr-like relation for\nasymptotically anti-de-Sitter planar black holes. This novel Smarr-like\nrelation leads to useful information in the condensed matter systems through\nthe AdS/CMT correspondence. By using our results, we provide an efficient way\nto obtain the holographically renormalized on-shell action without the\ninformation on the explicit forms of counter terms. We find the complete\nconsistency of our results with those in various models discussed in the recent\nliteratures and obtain new implications.\n", "  Direct detection of black hole-neutron star pairs is anticipated with the\nadvent of aLIGO. Electromagnetic counterparts may be crucial for a confident\ngravitational-wave detection as well as for extraction of astronomical\ninformation. Yet black hole-neutron star pairs are notoriously dark and so\ninaccessible to telescopes. Contrary to this expectation, a bright\nelectromagnetic transient can occur in the final moments before merger as long\nas the neutron star is highly magnetized. The orbital motion of the neutron\nstar magnet creates a Faraday flux and corresponding power available for\nluminosity. A spectrum of curvature radiation ramps up until the rapid\ninjection of energy ignites a fireball, which would appear as an energetic\nblackbody peaking in the x ray to $\\gamma$ rays for neutron star field\nstrengths ranging from $10^{12}$G to $10^{16}$G respectively and a $10M_{\\odot}\n$ black hole. The fireball event may last from a few milliseconds to a few\nseconds depending on the neutron star magnetic-field strength, and may be\nobservable with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor with a rate up to a few per\nyear for neutron star field strengths $\\gtrsim 10^{14}$G. We also discuss a\npossible decaying post-merger event which could accompany this signal. As an\nelectromagnetic counterpart to these otherwise dark pairs, the black-hole\nbattery should be of great value to the development of multi-messenger\nastronomy in the era of aLIGO.\n", "  The Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes have led to numerous advances in\nthe study and understanding of astrophysical X-ray sources. Particularly\nimportant has been the much increased spectral resolution of modern X-ray\ninstrumentation. Wind-broadened emission lines have been spectroscopically\nresolved for many massive stars. This contribution reviews approaches to the\nmodeling of X-ray emission line profile shapes from single stars, including\nsmooth winds, winds with clumping, optically thin versus thick lines, and the\neffect of a radius-dependent photoabsorption coefficient.\n", "  We exploit ALMA 870um observations to measure the star-formation rates (SFRs)\nof eight X-ray detected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in a z~3.1 protocluster,\nfour of which reside in extended Ly-alpha haloes (often termed Ly-alpha blobs:\nLABs). Three of the AGNs are detected by ALMA and have implied SFRs of\n~220-410~M_sun/yr; the non detection of the other five AGNs places SFR upper\nlimits of <210 M_sun/yr. The mean SFR of the protocluster AGNs (~110-210\nM_sun/yr) is consistent (within a factor of ~0.7-2.3) with that found for\nco-eval AGNs in the field, implying that galaxy growth is not significantly\naccelerated in these systems. However, when also considering ALMA data from the\nliterature, we find evidence for elevated mean SFRs (up-to a factor of ~5.9\nover the field) for AGNs at the protocluster core, indicating that galaxy\ngrowth is significantly accelerated in the central regions of the protocluster.\nWe also show that all of the four protocluster LABs are associated with an ALMA\ncounterpart within the extent of their Ly-alpha emission. The SFRs of the ALMA\nsources within the LABs (~150-410 M_sun/yr) are consistent with those expected\nfor co-eval massive star-forming galaxies in the field. Furthermore, the two\ngiant LABs (with physical extents of >100 kpc) do not host more luminous star\nformation than the smaller LABs, despite being an order of magnitude brighter\nin Ly-alpha emission. We use these results to discuss star formation as the\npower source of LABs.\n", "  V404 Cygni was discovered in 1989 by the $Ginga$ X-ray satellite during its\nonly previously observed X-ray outburst and soon after confirmed as a black\nhole binary. On June 15, 2015, the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggered on a\nnew outburst of V404 Cygni. We present 13 days of GBM observations of this\noutburst including Earth occultation flux measurements, spectral and temporal\nanalysis. The Earth occultation fluxes reached 30 Crab with detected emission\nto 100 keV and determined, via hardness ratios, that the source was in a hard\nstate. At high luminosity, spectral analysis between 8 and 300 keV showed that\nthe electron temperature decreased with increasing luminosity. This is expected\nif the protons and electrons are in thermal equilibrium during an outburst with\nthe electrons cooled by the Compton scattering of softer seed photons from the\ndisk. However, the implied seed photon temperatures are unusually high,\nsuggesting a contribution from another source, such as the jet. No evidence of\nstate transitions is seen during this time period. The temporal analysis\nreveals power spectra that can be modeled with two or three strong, broad\nLorentzians, similar to the power spectra of black hole binaries in their hard\nstate.\n", "  The origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remain an open\nquestion. Several attempts have been made to cross-correlate the arrival\ndirections of the UHECRs with catalogs of potential sources, but no definite\nconclusion has been reached. We report a Bayesian analysis of the 69 events\nfrom the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), that aims to determine the fraction of\nthe UHECRs that originate from known AGNs in the Veron-Cety & Veron (VCV)\ncatalog, as well as AGNs detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope\n(Swift-BAT), galaxies from the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), and an additional\nvolume-limited sample of 17 nearby AGNs. The study makes use of a multi-level\nBayesian model of UHECR injection, propagation and detection. We find that for\nreasonable ranges of prior parameters, the Bayes factors disfavour a purely\nisotropic model. For fiducial values of the model parameters, we report 68%\ncredible intervals for the fraction of source originating UHECRs of\n0.09+0.05-0.04, 0.25+0.09-0.08, 0.24+0.12-0.10, and 0.08+0.04-0.03 for the VCV,\nSwift-BAT and 2MRS catalogs, and the sample of 17 AGNs, respectively.\n", "  The significant electron-electron interactions that characterize the\n{\\pi}-electrons of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) necessitate going beyond\none-electron tight-binding description. Existing theories of electron-electron\ninteractions in GNRs take into account one electron-one hole interactions\naccurately but miss higher order effects. We report highly accurate density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations of the ground state electronic\nstructure, the relative energies of the lowest one-photon versus two-photon\nexcitations and the charge gaps in three narrow graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)\nwithin the correlated Pariser-Parr-Pople model for {\\pi}-conjugated systems. We\nhave employed the symmetrized DMRG method to investigate the zigzag nanoribbon\n3-ZGNR and two armchair nanoribbons 6-AGNR and 5-AGNR, respectively. We predict\nbulk magnetization of the ground state of 3-ZGNR, and a large spin gap in\n6-AGNR in their respective thermodynamic limits. Nonzero charge gaps and\nsemiconducting behavior, with moderate to large exciting binding energies are\nfound for all three nanoribbons, in contradiction to the prediction of\ntight-binding theory. The lowest two-photon gap in 3-ZGNR vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit, while this gap is smaller than the one-photon gap in\n5-AGNR. However, in 6-AGNR the one-photon gap is smaller than the two-photon\ngap and it is predicted to be fluorescent.\n", "  Selecting sources with rising flux densities towards longer wavelengths from\nHerschel/SPIRE maps is an efficient way to produce a catalogue rich in\nhigh-redshift (z > 4) dusty star-forming galaxies. The effectiveness of this\napproach has already been confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up observations,\nbut the previously available catalogues made this way are limited by small\nsurvey areas. Here we apply a map-based search method to 274 deg$^2$ of the\nHerMES Large Mode Survey (HeLMS) and create a catalogue of 477 objects with\nSPIRE flux densities $S_{500} > S_{350} >S_{250}$ and a $5 \\sigma$ cut-off\n$S_{500} > $ 52 mJy. From this catalogue we determine that the total number of\nthese \"red\" sources is at least an order of magnitude higher than predicted by\ngalaxy evolution models. These results are in agreement with previous findings\nin smaller HerMES fields; however, due to our significantly larger sample size\nwe are also able to investigate the shape of the red source counts for the\nfirst time. We have obtained spectroscopic redshift measurements for two of our\nsources using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The\nredshifts z = 5.1 and z = 3.8 confirm that with our selection method we can\nindeed find high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies.\n", "  The Boron to Carbon (B/C) and sub-Fe/Fe ratios provides an important clue on\nCosmic Ray (CR) propagation within the Galaxy. These ratios estimate the\ngrammage that the CR traverse as they propagate from their sources to Earth.\nAttempts to explain these ratios within the standard CR propagation models\nrequire ad hoc modifications and even with those these models necessitate\ninconsistent grammages to explain both ratios. As an alternative, physically\nmotivated model, we have proposed that CR originate preferably within the\ngalactic spiral arms. CR propagation from dynamic spiral arms has important\nimprints on various secondary to primary ratios, such as the B/C ratio and the\npositron fraction. We use our spiral arm diffusion model with the spallation\nnetwork extended up to Nickel to calculate the sub-Fe/Fe ratio. We show that\nwithout any additional parameters the spiral arm model consistently explains\nboth ratios with the same grammage, providing further evidence in favor of this\nmodel.\n", "  The anomalous transport and thermodynamic properties in the quantum-critical\nregion, in the cuprates, and in the quasi-two dimensional Fe-based\nsuperconductors and heavy-fermion compounds, have the same temperature\ndependences. This can occur only if, despite their vast microscopic\ndifferences, a common statistical mechanical model describes their phase\ntransitions. The antiferromagnetic (AFM)-ic models for the latter two, just as\nthe loop-current model for the cuprates, map to the dissipative XY model. The\nsolution of this model in 2+1 D reveals that the critical fluctuations are\ndetermined by topological excitations, vortices and a variety of instantons,\nand not by renormalized spin-wave theories of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson type,\nadapted by Moriya, Hertz and others for quantum-criticality. The absorptive\npart of the fluctuations is a separable function of momentum ${\\bf q}$,\nmeasured from the ordering vector, and of the frequency $\\omega$ and the\ntemperature $T$ which scale as $\\tanh(\\omega/2T)$ at criticality. Direct\nmeasurements of the fluctuations by neutron scattering in the\nquasi-two-dimensional heavy fermion and Fe-based compounds, near their\nantiferromagnetic quantum critical point, are consistent with this form. Such\nfluctuations, together with the vertex coupling them to fermions, lead to a\nmarginal fermi-liquid, with the imaginary part of the self-energy $\\propto\nmax(\\omega, T)$ for all momenta, a resistivity $\\propto T$, a $T \\ln T$\ncontribution to the specific heat, and other singular fermi-liquid properties\ncommon to these diverse compounds, as well as to d-wave superconductivity. This\nis explicitly verified, in the cuprates, by analysis of the pairing and the\nnormal self-energy directly extracted from the recent high resolution angle\nresolved photoemission measurements.\n", "  The topological pumping [1-3] is revisited from a view point of the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence. Shift of the center of mass (CM) as a pumped charge is\nexplicitly given by the Berry connection in time direction. We show that\nobserved pumping is due to the bulk, but its quantization is guaranteed by\nsingular motion of the CM caused by edge states. This is the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence in the topological pumping. A gauge invariant form of the pumped\ncharge is proposed by the temporal gauge and is used to establish this\nbulk-edge correspondence.\n", "  Morphological trends in growing colonies of living cells are at the core of\nphysiological and evolutionary processes. Using active gel equations, which\ninclude cell division, we show that shape changes during the growth can be\nregulated by the dynamics of topological defects in the orientation of cells.\nThe friction between the dividing cells and underlying substrate drives\nanisotropic colony shapes toward more isotropic morphologies, by mediating the\nnumber density and velocity of topological defects. We show that the defects\ninteract with the interface at a specific interaction range, set by the\nvorticity length scale of flows within the colony, and that the cells\npredominantly reorient parallel to the interface due to division-induced active\nstresses.\n", "  Photonic crystal waveguides are known to support C-points - point-like\npolarisation singularities with local chirality. Such points can couple with\ndipole-like emitters to produce highly directional emission, from which\nspin-photon entanglers can be built. Much is made of the promise of using\nslow-light modes to enhance this light-matter coupling. Here we explore the\ntransition from travelling to standing waves for two different photonic crystal\nwaveguide designs. We find that time-reversal symmetry and the reciprocal\nnature of light places constraints on using C-points in the slow-light regime.\nWe observe two distinctly different mechanisms through which this condition is\nsatisfied in the two waveguides. In the waveguide designs we consider, a modest\ngroup-velocity of $v_g \\approx c/10$ is found to be the optimum for slow-light\ncoupling to the C-points.\n", "  The X-ray emission of magnetic intermediate mass Ap/Bp stars is reviewed and\nput into context of intrinsic as well as extrinsic hypotheses for its origin.\nNew X-ray observations of Ap/Bp stars are presented and combined with an\nupdated analysis of the available datasets, providing the largest sample of its\ntype that is currently available. In the studied stars the X-ray detections are\nfound predominantly among the more massive, hotter and more luminous targets.\nTheir X-ray properties are quite diverse and beside strong soft X-ray emission\nsignificant magnetic activity is frequently present. While a connection between\nmore powerful winds and brighter X-ray emission is expected in intrinsic\nmodels, the scatter in X-ray luminosity at given bolometric luminosity is so\nfar unexplained and several observational features like X-ray light curves and\nflaring, luminosity distributions and spectral properties are often similar to\nthose of low-mass stars. It remains to be seen if these features can be fully\nreproduced by magnetospheres of intermediate mass stars. The article discusses\nimplications for magnetically confined wind-shock models (MCWS) and stellar\nmagnetospheres under the assumption that the intrinsic model is applicable, but\nalso examines the role of possible companions. Further, related magnetospheric\nphenomena are presented and an outlook on future perspectives is given.\n", "  The interaction between light and acoustic phonons is strongly modified in\nsub-wavelength confinement, and has led to the demonstration and control of\nBrillouin scattering in photonic structures such as nano-scale optical\nwaveguides and cavities. Besides the small optical mode volume, two physical\nmechanisms come into play simultaneously: a volume effect caused by the strain\ninduced refractive index perturbation (known as photo-elasticity), and a\nsurface effect caused by the shift of the optical boundaries due to mechanical\nvibrations. As a result proper material and structure engineering allows one to\ncontrol each contribution individually. In this paper, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the perfect cancellation of Brillouin scattering by engineering a\nsilica nanowire with exactly opposing photo-elastic and moving-boundary\neffects. This demonstration provides clear experimental evidence that the\ninterplay between the two mechanisms is a promising tool to precisely control\nthe photon-phonon interaction, enhancing or suppressing it.\n", "  We use simulated galaxy surveys to study: i) how galaxy membership in\nredMaPPer clusters maps to the underlying halo population, and ii) the accuracy\nof a mean dynamical cluster mass, $M_\\sigma(\\lambda)$, derived from stacked\npairwise spectroscopy of clusters with richness $\\lambda$. Using $\\sim\\!\n130,000$ galaxy pairs patterned after the SDSS redMaPPer cluster sample study\nof Rozo et al. (2015 RMIV), we show that the pairwise velocity PDF of\ncentral--satellite pairs with $m_i < 19$ in the simulation matches the form\nseen in RMIV. Through joint membership matching, we deconstruct the main\nGaussian velocity component into its halo contributions, finding that the\ntop-ranked halo contributes $\\sim 60\\%$ of the stacked signal. The halo mass\nscale inferred by applying the virial scaling of Evrard et al. (2008) to the\nvelocity normalization matches, to within a few percent, the log-mean halo mass\nderived through galaxy membership matching. We apply this approach, along with\nmis-centering and galaxy velocity bias corrections, to estimate the log-mean\nmatched halo mass at $z=0.2$ of SDSS redMaPPer clusters. Employing the velocity\nbias constraints of Guo et al. (2015), we find $\\langle \\ln(M_{200c})|\\lambda\n\\rangle = \\ln(M_{30}) + \\alpha_m \\ln(\\lambda/30)$ with $M_{30} = 1.56 \\pm 0.35\n\\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$ and $\\alpha_m = 1.31 \\pm 0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.13_{sys}$.\nSystematic uncertainty in the velocity bias of satellite galaxies\noverwhelmingly dominates the error budget.\n", "  The observation of diphoton excess around the mass of 750 GeV in LHC Run-II\nmotivates us to consider whether the singlet Higgs boson in the custodial Higgs\ntriplet model can serve as a good candidate because an earlier study of\ncomprehensive parameter scan shows that it can have the right mass in the\nviable mass spectra. By assuming the singlet Higgs mass at 750 GeV, its total\nwidth less than 50 GeV and imposing constraints from the LHC 8-TeV data, we\nidentify an approximately linear region on the $(v_\\Delta, \\alpha)$ plane along\nwhich the exotic Higgs boson masses satisfy a specific hierarchy and have lower\npossible spectra, where $v_\\Delta$ denotes the triplet vacuum expectation value\nand $\\alpha$ is the mixing angle between the singlet Higgs boson and the\nstandard model-like Higgs boson. Although the diphoton decay rate can be\nenhanced by charged Higgs bosons running in the loop in this region, it is\nmostly orders of magnitude smaller than that required for the observed\nproduction rate, except for the small $v_\\Delta$ region when the diphoton\nfusion production mechanism becomes dominant. Nonetheless, this part of\nparameter space suffers from the problems of breakdown of perturbativity and\nlarge uncertainties in the photon parton distribution function of proton.\n", "  We study four-terminal junction of spinless Luttinger liquid wires, which\ndescribes either a corner junction of two helical edges states of topological\ninsulators or the tunneling from the spinful wire into the helical edge state.\nWe use the fermionic representation and the scattering state formalism, in\norder to compute the renormalization group (RG) equations for the linear\nresponse conductances. We establish our approach by considering a junction\nbetween two possibly non-equivalent helical edge states and find an agreement\nwith the earlier analysis of this situation. Tunneling from the tip of the\nspinful wire to the edge state is further analyzed which requires some\nmodification of our formalism. In the latter case we demonstrate i) the\nexistence of both fixed lines and conventional fixed points of RG equations,\nand ii) certain proportionality relations holding for conductances during\nrenormalization. The scaling exponents and phase portraits are obtained in all\ncases.\n", "  The main objectives of the KM3NeT Collaboration are i) the discovery and\nsubsequent observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe and ii)\nthe determination of the mass hierarchy of neutrinos. These objectives are\nstrongly motivated by two recent important discoveries, namely: 1) The\nhigh-energy astrophysical neutrino signal reported by IceCube and 2) the\nsizable contribution of electron neutrinos to the third neutrino mass\neigenstate as reported by Daya Bay, Reno and others. To meet these objectives,\nthe KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure\nconsisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean\nSea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the\naccess to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the\nsynergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community. Three\nsuitable deep-sea sites are identified, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo\nPassero (Italy) and Pylos (Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three\nso-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings, each string\ncomprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises 31\nphoto-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a 3-dimensional\narray of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced\nby relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building\nblocks will be configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with different\nmethodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the\nGalactic plane. One building block will be configured to precisely measure\natmospheric neutrino oscillations.\n", "  We apply a generalized model for the determination and analysis of the\ndielectric function of optically anisotropic materials with colour dispersion\nto phonon modes and show that it can also be generalized to excitonic\npolarizabilities and electronic band-band transitions. We take into account\nthat the tensor components of the dielectric function within the cartesian\ncoordinate system are not independent from each other but are rather\nprojections of the polarization of dipoles oscillating along directions defined\nby the, non-cartesian, crystal symmetry and polarizability. The dielectric\nfunction is then composed of a series of oscillators pointing in different\ndirections. The application of this model is exemplarily demonstrated for\nmonoclinic ($\\beta$-phase) Ga$_2$O$_3$ bulk single crystals. Using this model,\nwe are able to relate electronic transitions observed in the dielectric\nfunction to atomic bond directions and orbitals in the real space crystal\nstructure. For thin films revealing rotational domains we show that the optical\nbiaxiality is reduced to uniaxial optical response.\n", "  Stochastic differential equations describe well many physical, biological and\nsociological systems, despite the simplification often made in their\nderivation. Here the usage of simple stochastic differential equations to\ncharacterize and classify complex dynamical systems is proposed within a\nBayesian framework. To this end, we develop a dynamic system classifier (DSC).\nThe DSC first abstracts training data of a system in terms of time dependent\ncoefficients of the descriptive stochastic differential equation. Thereby the\nDSC identifies unique correlation structures within the training data. For\ndefiniteness we restrict the presentation of DSC to oscillation processes with\na time dependent frequency {\\omega}(t) and damping factor {\\gamma}(t). Although\nreal systems might be more complex, this simple oscillator captures many\ncharacteristic features. The {\\omega} and {\\gamma} timelines represent the\nabstract system characterization and permit the construction of efficient\nsignal classifiers. Numerical experiments show that such classifiers perform\nwell even in the low signal-to-noise regime.\n", "  We study a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled through the position\noperator $\\hat{q}$ to a first bath and through the momentum operator $\\hat{p}$\nto a second bath yielding an Ohmic-Drude dissipation. We analyse the\noscillator's fluctuations as a function of the ratio between the strength of\nthe two couplings, focusing in particular on the situation in which the two\ndissipative interactions are comparable. Analytic formulas are derived in the\nrelevant regimes corresponding to the low temperature limit and when the Drude\nhigh frequency cutoff is much larger than all other frequencies. At low\ntemperature, each bath operates to suppress the oscillator's ground state\nquantum fluctuations ${\\langle \\Delta \\hat{q}^2 \\rangle}_0$ or ${\\langle \\Delta\n\\hat{p}^2 \\rangle}_0$ appearing in the corresponding interaction. When one of\nthe two dissipative interactions dominates over the other, the fluctuations for\nthe coupling operator are squeezed. When the two interactions are comparable,\nthe two baths enter in competition as the two conjugate operators do not\ncommute yielding quantum frustration. In this regime, remarkably, the\nfluctuations of both two quadratures can be enhanced by increasing the\ndissipative coupling.\n", "  Time correlations for KPZ growth in 1+1 dimensions are reconsidered. We\ndiscuss flat, curved, and stationary initial conditions and are interested in\nthe covariance of the height as a function of time at a fixed point on the\nsubstrate. In each case the power laws of the covariance for short and long\ntimes are obtained. They are derived from a variational problem involving two\nindependent Airy processes. For stationary initial conditions we derive an\nexact formula for the stationary covariance with two approaches: (1) the\nvariational problem and (2) deriving the covariance of the time-integrated\ncurrent at the origin for the corresponding driven lattice gas. In the\nstationary case we also derive the l arge time behavior for the covariance of\nthe height gradients.\n", "  The determination of photospheric abundances in late-type stars from\nspectroscopic observations is a well-established field, built on solid\ntheoretical foundations. Improving those foundations to refine the accuracy of\nthe inferred abundances has proven challenging, but progress has been made. In\nparallel, developments on instrumentation, chiefly regarding multi-object\nspectroscopy, have been spectacular, and a number of projects are collecting\nlarge numbers of observations for stars across the Milky Way and nearby\ngalaxies, promising important advances in our understanding of galaxy formation\nand evolution. After providing a brief description of the basic physics and\ninput data involved in the analysis of stellar spectra, a review is made of the\nanalysis steps, and the available tools to cope with large observational\nefforts. The paper closes with a quick overview of relevant ongoing and planned\nspectroscopic surveys, and highlights of recent research on photospheric\nabundances.\n", "  Fundamental properties of warm dense matter are described by the dielectric\nfunction, which gives access to the frequency-dependent electrical\nconductivity, absorption, emission and scattering of radiation, charged\nparticles stopping and further macroscopic properties. Different approaches to\nthe dielectric function and the related dynamical collision frequency are\ncompared in a wide frequency range. The high-frequency limit describing inverse\nbremsstrahlung and the low-frequency limit of the dc conductivity are\nconsidered. Sum rules and Kramers-Kronig relation are checked for the\ngeneralized linear response theory and the standard approach following kinetic\ntheory. The results are discussed in application to aluminum, xenon and argon\nplasmas.\n", "  To study systematically the evolution on the angular extents of the galaxy,\nICM, and dark matter components in galaxy clusters, we compiled the optical and\nX-ray properties of a sample of 340 clusters with redshifts $<0.5$, based on\nall the available data with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and {\\it\nChandra}/{\\it XMM-Newton}. For each cluster, the member galaxies were\ndetermined primarily with photometric redshift measurements. The radial ICM\nmass distribution, as well as the total gravitational mass distribution, were\nderived from a spatially-resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray data. When\nnormalizing the radial profile of galaxy number to that of the ICM mass, the\nrelative curve was found to depend significantly on the cluster redshift; it\ndrops more steeply towards outside in lower redshift subsamples. The same\nevolution is found in the galaxy-to-total mass profile, while the ICM-to-total\nmass profile varies in an opposite way. We interpret that the galaxies, the\nICM, and the dark matter components had similar angular distributions when a\ncluster was formed, while the galaxies travelling interior of the cluster have\ncontinuously fallen towards the center relative to the other components, and\nthe ICM has slightly expanded relative to the dark matter although it suffers\nstrong radiative loss. This cosmological galaxy infall, accompanied by an ICM\nexpansion, can be explained by considering that the galaxies interact strongly\nwith the ICM while they are moving through it. The interaction is considered to\ncreate a large energy flow of $10^{44-45}$ erg $\\rm s^{-1}$ per cluster from\nthe member galaxies to their environment, which is expected to continue over\ncosmological time scales.\n", "  We analyse the demographics of black holes (BHs) in the large-volume\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. This simulation\nstatistically models how much gas is accreted onto BHs, traces the energy\ndeposited into their environment and, consequently, the back-reaction of the\nambient medium on BH growth. The synthetic BHs reproduce a variety of\nobservational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density\nand the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova\nfeedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH-galaxy mass\ncorrelation. Starting at z~2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs\nover-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a\ncentral BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees\nbetter with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless\nobscuration is taken into account. The most massive halos present BH\nmultiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some\ncases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a\ndual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found\nin observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are\nin good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated\nin turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at\nz=3 and z=2 respectively.\n", "  Hot stars emit large amounts of X-rays, which are assumed to originate in the\nsupersonic stellar wind. Part of the emitted X-rays is subsequently absorbed in\nthe wind and influences its ionization state. Because hot star winds are driven\nradiatively, the modified ionization equilibrium affects the radiative force.\nWe review the recent progress in modelling the influence of X-rays on the\nradiative equilibrium and on the radiative force. We focus particularly on\nsingle stars with X-rays produced in wind shocks and on binaries with massive\ncomponents, which belong to the most luminous objects in X-rays.\n", "  We explore the role that gravitational instability plays in NGC 1068, a\nnearby Seyfert galaxy that exhibits unusually vigorous starburst activity. For\nthis purpose, we use the Romeo-Falstad disc instability diagnostics and data\nfrom BIMA SONG, SDSS and SAURON. Our analysis illustrates that NGC 1068 is a\ngravitationally unstable \"monster\". Its starburst disc is subject to unusually\npowerful instabilities. Several processes, including AGN/stellar feedback, try\nto quench such instabilities from inside out by depressing the surface density\nof molecular gas across the central kpc, but they do not succeed. Gravitational\ninstability \"wins\" because it is driven by the stars via their much higher\nsurface density. In this process, stars and molecular gas are strongly coupled,\nand it is such a coupling that ultimately triggers local gravitational\ncollapse/fragmentation in the molecular gas.\n", "  Proton mirror modes are large amplitude nonpropagating structures frequently\nobserved in the magnetosheath. It has been suggested that electron temperature\nanisotropy can enhance the proton mirror instability growth rate while leaving\nthe proton cyclotron instability largely unaffected, therefore causing the\nproton mirror instability to dominate the proton cyclotron instability in\nEarth's magnetosheath. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to investigate\nthe electron temperature anisotropy effects on proton mirror instability\nevolution. Contrary to the hypothesis, electron temperature anisotropy leads to\nexcitement of the electron whistler instability. Our results show that the\nelectron whistler instability grows much faster than the proton mirror\ninstability and quickly consumes the electron free energy, so that there is no\nelectron temperature anisotropy left to significantly impact the evolution of\nthe proton mirror instability.\n", "  Homojunctions between Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and its Mn-doped phase are investigated as\na sample geometry to study the influence of spin degrees of freedom on\ntopological insulator properties. $n$ quintuple layers (QLs) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nare grown ontop of Mn-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy for $0\\le n\n\\le 30\\,$QLs, allowing to unhamperedly monitor the development of electronic\nand topological properties by surface sensitive techniques like angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. With increasing $n$, a Mn-induced gap at the Dirac\npoint is gradually filled in an \"hourglass\" fashion to reestablish a\ntopological surface state at $n \\sim 9\\,$QLs. Our results suggest a competition\nof upwards and downwards band bending effects due to the presence of an n-p\ntype interface, which can be used to tailor topological and quantum well states\nindependently.\n", "  We present measurements of thermal and electrical spin injection in nanoscale\nmetallic non-local spin valve (NLSV) structures. Informed by measurements of\nthe Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity of representative films made\nusing a micromachined Si-N thermal isolation platform, we use simple analytical\nand finite element thermal models to determine limits on the thermal gradient\ndriving thermal spin injection and calculate the spin dependent Seebeck\ncoefficient to be $-0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{K}< S_{s}<-1.3\\\n\\mu\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{K}$. This is comparable in terms of the fraction of the\nabsolute Seebeck coefficient to previous results, despite dramatically smaller\nelectrical spin injection signals. Since the small electrical spin signals are\nlikely caused by interfacial effects, we conclude that thermal spin injection\nis less sensitive to the FM/NM interface, and possibly benefits from a layer of\noxidized ferromagnet, which further stimulates interest in thermal spin\ninjection for applications in sensors and pure spin current sources.\n", "  We show that the gravitational wave source counts distribution can test how\ngravitational radiation propagates on cosmological scales. This test does not\nrequire obtaining redshifts for the sources. If the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR,\n$\\rho$) from a gravitational wave source is proportional to the strain then it\nfalls as $R^{-1}$, thus we expect the source counts to follow $dN/d\\rho \\propto\n\\rho^{-4}$. However, if gravitational waves decay as they propagate or\npropagate into other dimensions, then there can be deviations from this generic\nprediction. We consider the possibility that the strain falls as $R^{-\\gamma}$,\nwhere $\\gamma=1$ recovers the expected predictions in a Euclidean\nuniformly-filled universe, and forecast the sensitivity of future observations\nto deviations from standard General Relativity. We first consider the case of\nfew objects, 7 sources, with a signal-to-noise from 8 to 24, and impose a lower\nlimit on $\\gamma$, finding $\\gamma>0.33$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. The\ndistribution of our simulated sample is very consistent with the distribution\nof the trigger events reported by Advanced LIGO. Future measurements will\nimprove these constraints: with 100 events, we estimate that $\\gamma$ can be\nmeasured with an uncertainty of $15\\%$. We generalize the formalism to account\nfor a range of chirp masses and the possibility that the signal falls as\n$\\exp(-R/R_0)/R^\\gamma$.\n", "  Stellar halos and globular cluster (GC) systems contain valuable information\nregarding the assembly history of their host galaxies. Motivated by the\ndetection of a significant rotation signal in the outer halo GC system of M31,\nwe investigate the likelihood of detecting such a rotation signal in\nprojection, using cosmological simulations. To this end we select subsets of\ntagged particles in the halos of the Aquarius simulations to represent mock GC\nsystems, and analyse their kinematics. We find that GC systems can exhibit a\nnon-negligible rotation signal provided the associated stellar halo also has a\nnet angular momentum. The ability to detect this rotation signal is highly\ndependent on the viewing perspective, and the probability of seeing a signal\nlarger than that measured in M31 ranges from 10% to 90% for the different halos\nin the Aquarius suite. High values are found from a perspective such that the\nprojected angular momentum of the GC system is within 40 deg of the rotation\naxis determined via the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of the\nGCs. Furthermore, the true 3D angular momentum of the outer stellar halo is\nrelatively well aligned, within 35 deg, with that of the mock GC systems. We\nargue that the net angular momentum in the mock GC systems arises naturally\nwhen the majority of the material is accreted from a preferred direction,\nnamely along the dominant dark matter filament of the large-scale structure\nthat the halos are embedded in. This, together with the favourable edge-on view\nof M31's disk suggests that it is not a coincidence that a large rotation\nsignal has been measured for its outer halo GC system.\n", "  An extension of the CCS-method [Chem. Phys. 2004, 304, p. 103-120] for\nsimulating non-adiabatic dynamics with quantum effects of the nuclei is put\nforward.\n  The time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the motion of the nuclei is\nsolved in a moving basis set. The basis set is guided by classical\ntrajectories, which can hop stochastically between different electronic\npotential energy surfaces. The non-adiabatic transitions are modelled by a\nmodified version of Tully's fewest switches algorithm. The trajectories consist\nof Gaussians in the phase space of the nuclei (coherent states) combined with\namplitudes for an electronic wave function. The time-dependent matrix elements\nbetween different coherent states determine the amplitude of each trajectory in\nthe total multistate wave function; the diagonal matrix elements determine the\nhopping probabilities and gradients. In this way, both intereference effects\nand non-adiabatic transitions can be described in a very compact fashion,\nleading to the exact solution if convergence with respect to the number of\ntrajectories is achieved and the potential energy surfaces are known globally.\n  The method is tested on a 2D model for a conical intersection [J. Chem.\nPhys., 1996, 104, p. 5517], where a nuclear wavepacket encircles the point of\ndegeneracy between two potential energy surfaces and intereferes with itself.\nThese intereference effects are absent in classical trajectory-based molecular\ndynamics but can be fully incorporated if trajectories are replaced by surface\nhopping coupled coherent states.\n", "  Robust, accurate and efficient quantum tomography is key for future quantum\ntechnologies. Traditional methods are impractical for even medium sized systems\nand are not robust against noise and errors. Here we report on an experimental\ndemonstration of self-guided quantum tomography; an autonomous, fast, robust\nand precise technique for measuring quantum states with significantly less\ncomputational resources than standard techniques. The quantum state is\niteratively learned by treating tomography as a projection measurement\noptimization problem. We experimentally demonstrate robustness against both\nstatistical noise and experimental errors on both single qubit and entangled\ntwo-qubit states. Our demonstration provides a method of full quantum state\ncharacterization in current and near-future experiments where standard\ntechniques are unfeasible.\n", "  We propose a microscopic model to study the avalanche problem of insulating\nglass deformed by external static uniform strain below $T=60$K. We use\nthree-dimensional real-space renormalization procedure to carry out the glass\nmechanical susceptibility at macroscopic length scale. We prove the existence\nof irreversible stress drops in amorphous materials, corresponding to the steep\npositive-negative transitions in glass mechanical susceptibility. We also\nobtain the strain directions in which the glass system is brittle. The\nirreversible stress drops in glass essentially come from non-elastic\nstress-stress interaction which is generated by virtual phonon exchange\nprocess.\n", "  We theoretically investigate trapped ions interacting with atoms that are\ncoupled to Rydberg states. The strong polarizabilities of the Rydberg levels\nincreases the interaction strength between atoms and ions by many orders of\nmagnitude, as compared to the case of ground state atoms, and may be mediated\nover micrometers. We calculate that such interactions can be used to generate\nentanglement between an atom and the motion or internal state of an ion.\nFurthermore, the ion could be used as a bus for mediating spin-spin\ninteractions between atomic spins in analogy to much employed techniques in ion\ntrap quantum simulation. The proposed scheme comes with attractive features as\nit maps the benefits of the trapped ion quantum system onto the atomic one\nwithout obviously impeding its intrinsic scalability. No ground state cooling\nof the ion or atom is required and the setup allows for full dynamical control.\nMoreover, the scheme is to a large extent immune to the micromotion of the ion.\nOur findings are of interest for developing hybrid quantum information\nplatforms and for implementing quantum simulations of solid state physics.\n", "  Direct imaging observations of protoplanetary disks at near-infrared (NIR)\nwavelengths have revealed structures of potentially planetary origin.\nInvestigations of observational signatures from planet-induced features have so\nfar focused on disks viewed face-on. Combining 3D hydrodynamics and radiative\ntransfer simulations, we study how the appearance of the spiral arms and the\ngap produced in a disk by a companion varies with inclination and position\nangle in NIR scattered light. We compare the cases of a $3M_{\\rm J}$ and a\n$0.1M_{\\odot}$ companion, and make predictions suitable for testing with\nGemini/GPI, VLT/NACO/SPHERE, and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO. We find that the two\ntrailing arms produced by an external perturber can have a variety of\nmorphologies in inclined systems - they may appear as one trailing arm; two\ntrailing arms on the same side of the disk; or two arms winding in opposite\ndirections. The disk ring outside a planetary gap may also mimic spiral arms\nwhen viewed at high inclinations. We suggest potential explanations for the\nfeatures observed in HH 30, HD 141569 A, AK Sco, HD 100546, and AB Aur. We\nemphasize that inclined views of companion-induced features cannot be converted\ninto face-on views using simple and commonly practiced image deprojections.\n", "  Connections between the electron eigenstates and conductivity of\none-dimensional disordered electron systems is studied in the framework of the\ntight-binding model. We show that for weak disorder only part of the states\nexhibit resonant transmission and contribute to the conductivity. The rest of\nthe eigenvalues are not associated with peaks in transmission and the\namplitudes of their wave functions do not exhibit a significant maxima within\nthe sample. Moreover, unlike ordinary states, the lifetimes of these `hidden'\nmodes either remain constant or even decrease (depending on the coupling with\nthe leads) as the disorder becomes stronger. In a wide range of the disorder\nstrengths, the averaged ratio of the number of transmission peaks to the total\nnumber of the eigenstates is independent of the degree of disorder and is close\nto the value $\\sqrt{2/5}$, which was derived analytically in the\nweak-scattering approximation. These results are in perfect analogy to the\nspectral and transport properties of light in one-dimensional randomly\ninhomogeneous media, which provides strong grounds to believe that the\nexistence of hidden, non-conducting modes is a general phenomenon inherent to\n1D open random systems, and their fraction of the total density of states is\nthe same for quantum particles and classical waves.\n", "  Using fully kinetic simulations, we study the suppression of asymmetric\nreconnection in the limit where the diamagnetic drift speed >> Alfven speed and\nthe magnetic shear angle is moderate. We demonstrate that the slippage between\nelectrons and the magnetic flux facilitates reconnection, and can even result\nin fast reconnection that lacks one of the outflow jets. Through comparing a\ncase where the diamagnetic drift is supported by the temperature gradient with\na companion case that has a density gradient instead, we identify a robust\nsuppression mechanism. The drift of the x-line is slowed down locally by the\nasymmetric nature of the current sheet and the resulting tearing modes, then\nthe x-line is run over and swallowed by the faster-moving following flux.\n", "  Parity-time (PT) symmetric systems have two distinguished phases, e.g., one\nwith real energy eigenvalues and the other with complex conjugate eigenvalues.\nTo enter one phase from the other, it is believed that the system must pass\nthrough an exceptional point, which is a non-Hermitian degenerate point with\ncoalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this letter we reveal an anomalous\nPT transition that takes place away from an exceptional point in a nonlinear\nsystem: as the nonlinearity increases, the original linear system evolves along\ntwo distinct PT-symmetric trajectories, each of which can have an exceptional\npoint. However, the two trajectories collide and vanish away from these\nexceptional points, after which the system is left with a PT-broken phase. We\nfirst illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify\nit using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.\n", "  According to statistical mechanics, micro-states of an isolated physical\nsystem (say, a gas in a box) at time $t_0$ in a given macro-state of\nless-than-maximal entropy typically evolve in such a way that the entropy at\ntime $t$ increases with $|t-t_0|$ in both time directions. In order to account\nfor the observed entropy increase in only one time direction, the thermodynamic\narrow of time, one usually appeals to the hypothesis that the initial state of\nthe universe was one of very low entropy. In certain recent models of\ncosmology, however, no hypothesis about the initial state of the universe is\ninvoked. We discuss how the emergence of a thermodynamic arrow of time in such\nmodels can nevertheless be compatible with the above-mentioned consequence of\nstatistical mechanics, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.\n", "  Accurately characterizing the redshift distributions of galaxies is essential\nfor analysing deep photometric surveys and testing cosmological models. We\npresent a technique to simultaneously infer redshift distributions and\nindividual redshifts from photometric galaxy catalogues. Our model constructs a\npiecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution\nof galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efficiently inferred\nfrom noisy photometric flux measurements. This approach can be seen as a\ngeneralization of template-fitting photometric redshift methods and relies on a\nlibrary of spectral templates to relate the photometric fluxes of individual\ngalaxies to their redshifts. We illustrate this technique on simulated galaxy\nsurvey data, and demonstrate that it delivers correct posterior distributions\non the underlying type and redshift distributions, as well as on the individual\ntypes and redshifts of galaxies. We show that even with uninformative priors,\nlarge photometric errors and parameter degeneracies, the redshift and type\ndistributions can be recovered robustly thanks to the hierarchical nature of\nthe model, which is not possible with common photometric redshift estimation\ntechniques. As a result, redshift uncertainties can be fully propagated in\ncosmological analyses for the first time, fulfilling an essential requirement\nfor the current and future generations of surveys.\n", "  For a material to order upon cooling is common sense. What is more seldom is\nfor disorder to reappear at lower temperature, which is known as reentrant\nbehavior. Such resurgence of disorder has been observed in a variety of\nsystems, ranging from Rochelle salts to nematic phases in liquid crystals.\nFrustration is often a key ingredient for reentrance mechanisms. Here we shall\nstudy a frustrated model, namely the anisotropic shuriken lattice, which offers\na natural setting to explore an extension of the notion of reentrance between\nmagnetic disordered phases. By tuning the anisotropy of the lattice, we open a\nwindow in the phase diagram where magnetic disorder prevails down to zero\ntemperature. In this region, the competition between multiple disordered ground\nstates gives rise to a double crossover where both the low- and\nhigh-temperature regimes are less correlated than the intervening classical\nspin liquid. This reentrance of disorder is characterized by an entropy\nplateau, a multi-step Curie law crossover and a rather complex diffuse\nscattering in the static structure factor. Those results are confirmed by\ncomplementary numerical and analytical methods: Monte Carlo simulations,\nHusimi-tree calculations and an exact decoration-iteration transformation.\n", "  The role played by the insulating intermediate (Li$_{0.84}$Fe$_{0.16}$)OH\nlayer on magnetic and superconducting properties of\n(Li$_{0.84}$Fe$_{0.16}$)OHFe$_{0.98}$Se was studied by means of muon-spin\nrotation. It was found that it is not only enhances the coupling between the\nFeSe layers for temperatures below $\\simeq 10$ K, but becomes superconducting\nby itself due to the proximity to the FeSe ones. Superconductivity in\n(Li$_{0.84}$Fe$_{0.16}$)OH layers is most probably filamentary-like and the\nenergy gap value, depending on the order parameter symmetry, does not exceed\n1-1.5 meV.\n", "  We present an analysis of a general machine learning technique called\n'stacking' for the estimation of photometric redshifts. Stacking techniques can\nfeed the photometric redshift estimate, as output by a base algorithm, back\ninto the same algorithm as an additional input feature in a subsequent learning\nround. We shown how all tested base algorithms benefit from at least one\nadditional stacking round (or layer). To demonstrate the benefit of stacking,\nwe apply the method to both unsupervised machine learning techniques based on\nself-organising maps (SOMs), and supervised machine learning methods based on\ndecision trees. We explore a range of stacking architectures, such as the\nnumber of layers and the number of base learners per layer. Finally we explore\nthe effectiveness of stacking even when using a successful algorithm such as\nAdaBoost. We observe a significant improvement of between 1.9% and 21% on all\ncomputed metrics when stacking is applied to weak learners (such as SOMs and\ndecision trees). When applied to strong learning algorithms (such as AdaBoost)\nthe ratio of improvement shrinks, but still remains positive and is between\n0.4% and 2.5% for the explored metrics and comes at almost no additional\ncomputational cost.\n", "  MeV blazars are a sub--population of the blazar family, exhibiting\nlarger--than--average jet powers, accretion luminosities and black hole masses.\nBecause of their extremely hard X--ray continua, these objects are best studied\nin the X-ray domain. Here, we report on the discovery by the $Fermi$ Large Area\nTelescope and subsequent follow-up observations with $NuSTAR$, $Swift$ and\nGROND of a new member of the MeV blazar family: PMN J0641$-$0320. Our optical\nspectroscopy provides confirmation that this is a flat--spectrum radio quasar\nlocated at a redshift of $z=1.196$. Its very hard $NuSTAR$ spectrum (power--law\nphoton index of $\\sim$1 up to $\\sim$80 keV) indicates that the emission is\nproduced via inverse Compton scattering off photons coming from outside the\njet.The overall spectral energy distribution of PMN J0641$-$0320 is typical of\npowerful blazars and by reproducing it with a simple one-zone leptonic emission\nmodel we find the emission region to be located either inside the broad line\nregion or within the dusty torus.\n", "  We explore the impact of a cosmic ray (CR) background generated by supernova\nexplosions from the first stars on star-forming metal-free gas in a minihalo at\n$z\\sim25$. Starting from cosmological initial conditions, we use the smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2 to follow gas collapsing under the\ninfluence of a CR background up to densities of $n=10^{12}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}$, at\nwhich point we form sink particles. Using a suite of simulations with two sets\nof initial conditions and employing a range of CR background models, we follow\neach simulation for $5000\\,$yr after the first sink forms. CRs both heat and\nionise the gas, boosting ${\\rm H}_2$ formation. Additional ${\\rm H}_2$ enhances\nthe cooling efficiency of the gas, allowing it to fulfil the Rees-Ostriker\ncriterion sooner and expediting the collapse, such that each simulation reaches\nhigh densities at a different epoch. As it exits the loitering phase, the\nthermodynamic path of the collapsing gas converges to that seen in the absence\nof any CR background. By the time the gas approaches sink formation densities,\nthe thermodynamic state of the gas is thus remarkably similar across all\nsimulations. This leads to a robust characteristic mass that is largely\nindependent of the CR background, of order $\\sim$ a few $\\times10\\,{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ even as the CR background strength varies by five orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  Interacting Fermi systems in the strongly correlated regime play a\nfundamental role in many areas of physics and are of particular interest to the\ncondensed matter community. Though weakly inter- acting fermions are\nunderstood, strongly correlated fermions are difficult to describe\ntheoretically as there is no small interaction parameter to expand about.\nExisting strong coupling theories rely heavily on the so-called many-body\nT-matrix approximation that sums ladder-type Feynman diagrams. Here, by\nacknowledging the fact that the effective interparticle interaction (i.e., the\nvertex function) becomes smaller above three dimensions, we propose an\nalternative way to reorganize Feynman diagrams and develop a theoretical\nframework for interacting Fermi gases beyond the ladder approximation. As an\napplication, we solve the equation of state for three- and two-dimensional\nstrongly interacting fermions and find excellent agreement with experimental\n[Science 335, 563 (2012)] and other theoretical results above the temperature\n0.5TF .\n", "  Throughout the epoch of reionization the most luminous Ly{\\alpha} emitters\nare capable of ionizing their own local bubbles. The CR7 galaxy at $z \\approx\n6.6$ stands out for its combination of exceptionally bright Ly{\\alpha} and HeII\n1640 Angstrom line emission but absence of metal lines. As a result CR7 may be\nthe first viable candidate host of a young primordial starburst or direct\ncollapse black hole. High-resolution spectroscopy reveals a +160 km s$^{-1}$\nvelocity offset between the Ly{\\alpha} and HeII line peaks while the spatial\nextent of the Ly{\\alpha} emitting region is $\\sim 16$ kpc. The observables are\nindicative of an outflow signature produced by a strong central source. We\npresent one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations incorporating\naccurate Ly{\\alpha} feedback and ionizing radiation to investigate the nature\nof the CR7 source. We find that a Population III star cluster with $10^5$ K\nblackbody emission ionizes its environment too efficiently to generate a\nsignificant velocity offset. However, a massive black hole with a nonthermal\nCompton-thick spectrum is able to reproduce the Ly{\\alpha} signatures as a\nresult of higher photon trapping and longer potential lifetime. For both\nsources, Ly{\\alpha} radiation pressure turns out to be dynamically important.\n", "  Quantum communication without a shared reference frame or the construction of\na relational quantum theory requires the notion of a quantum reference frame.\nWe analyze aspects of quantum reference frames associated with non-compact\ngroups, specifically the group of spatial translations and Galilean boosts. We\nbegin by demonstrating how the usually employed group average, used to dispense\nof the notion of an external reference frame, leads to unphysical states when\napplied to reference frames associated with non-compact groups. However, we\nshow that this average does lead naturally to a reduced state on the relative\ndegrees of freedom of a system, which was previously considered by Angelo et\nal. [1]. We then study in detail the informational properties of this reduced\nstate for systems of two and three particles in Gaussian states.\n", "  Motivated by recent studies showing an apparent correlation between the\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the low-frequency, type-C\nQPO in low-mass, black hole X-ray binaries (LMXBs), we explore a model that\nexplains all three QPOs in terms of an oscillating, precessing hot flow in the\ntruncated-disk geometry. Our model favors attributing the two high-frequency\nQPOs, often occurring in a near 3:2 frequency ratio, to the breathing and\nvertical epicyclic frequency modes of the hot, thick flow, although we can not\nrule out the Keplerian and m=-1 radial epicyclic modes. In either case, the\ntype-C QPO is attributed to precession. The correlation of the QPOs comes from\nthe fact that all three frequencies are associated with the same geometrical\nstructure. While the exact QPO frequencies are sensitive to the black hole mass\nand spin, their evolution over the course of an outburst is mainly tied to the\ntruncation radius between the geometrically thin, optically thick disk and the\ninner, hot flow. We show that, in the case of the LMXB GRO J1655-40, this model\ncan explain the one simultaneous observation of all three QPOs and that an\nextrapolation of the model appears to match lower frequency observations where\nonly two of the three components are seen. Thus, this model may be able to\nunify multiple QPO observations using the properties of a single, simple,\ngeometrical model.\n", "  We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in an anti-de-Sitter\n(AdS) bulk through a cosmological singularity by mapping the dynamics onto the\nboundary conformal fields theory by means of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We\nconsider a deformed AdS space-time obtained by considering a time-dependent\ndilaton which induces a curvature singularity in the bulk at a time which we\ncall $t = 0$, and which asymptotically approaches AdS both for large positive\nand negative times. The boundary field theory becomes free when the bulk\ncurvature goes to infinity. Hence, the evolution of the fluctuations is under\nbetter controle on the boundary than in the bulk. To avoid unbounded particle\nproduction across the bounce it is necessary to smooth out the curvature\nsingularity at very high curvatures. We show how the bulk cosmological\nperturbations can be mapped onto boundary gauge field fluctuations. We evolve\nthe latter and compare the spectrum of fluctuations on the infrared scales\nrelevant for cosmological observations before and after the bounce point. We\nfind that the index of the power spectrum of fluctuations is the same before\nand after the bounce.\n", "  We present a series of quantum states that are characterized by dark solitons\nof the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (i.e. the Gross-Pitaevskii equation)\nfor the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas interacting through the repulsive\ndelta-function potentials. The classical solutions satisfy the periodic\nboundary conditions and we call them periodic dark solitons. Through exact\nsolutions we show corresponding aspects between the states and the solitons in\nthe weak coupling case: the quantum and classical density profiles completely\noverlap with each other not only at an initial time but also at later times\nover a long period of time, and they move together with the same speed in time;\nthe matrix element of the bosonic field operator between the quantum states has\nexactly the same profiles of the square amplitude and the phase as the\nclassical complex scalar field of a periodic dark soliton not only at the\ninitial time but also at later times, and the corresponding profiles move\ntogether for a long period of time. We suggest that the corresponding\nproperties hold rigorously in the weak coupling limit. Furthermore, we argue\nthat the lifetime of the dark soliton-like density profile in the quantum state\nbecomes infinitely long as the coupling constant approaches zero, by comparing\nit with the quantum speed limit time. Thus, we call the quantum states quantum\ndark soliton states.\n", "  In this work, we demonstrate the on-chip two-photon interference between\nsingle photons emitted by a single self-assembled InGaAs quantum dot and an\nexternal laser. The quantum dot is embedded within one arm of an air-clad\ndirectional coupler which acts as a beam-splitter for incoming light. Photons\noriginating from an attenuated external laser are coupled to the second arm of\nthe beam-splitter and then combined with the quantum dot photons, giving rise\nto two-photon quantum interference between dissimilar sources. We verify the\noccurrence of on-chip Hong-Ou-Mandel interference by cross-correlating the\noptical signal from the separate output ports of the directional coupler. This\nexperimental approach allows us to use classical light source (laser) to assess\nin a single step the overall device performance in the quantum regime and probe\nquantum dot photon indistinguishability on application realistic time scales.\n", "  In this article we partially implement the program outlined in the previous\npaper of the authors [A. V. Aminova and P. I. Chumarov, Phys. Rev. D 88, 044005\n(2013)]. The program owes its origins to the following comment in paper [M.\nCveti\\v{c} and D. Youm, Nucl. Phys. B, 438, 182 (1995), Addendum-ibid. 449,146\n(1995)], where a class of static spherically symmetric solutions in\n$(4+n)$-dimensional Kaluza--Klein theory was studied: \"...We suspect that the\nsame thing [as for spherical symmetry] will happen for axially symmetric\nstationary configurations, but it remains to be proven\". We study the radial\nand non-radial motion of test particles in the cylindrically symmetric\nwormholes found in the authors'paper of type $\\rm WhCR^e$ in 6-dimensional\nreduced Kaluza--Klein theory with Abelian gauge field and two dilaton fields,\nwith particular attention to the extent to which the wormhole is traversable.\nIn the case of non-radial motion along a hypersurface z=const we show that, as\nin the Kerr and Schwarzschild geometries, we should distinguish between orbits\nwith impact parameters greater resp. less than a certain critical value $D_c$,\nwhich corresponds to the unstable circular orbit of radius $u_c$ $(r_c)$. For\n$D^2>D_c^2$ there are two kinds of orbits: orbits of the first kind arrive from\ninfinity and have pericenter distances greater than $u_c$, whereas orbits of\nthe second kind have apocenter distances less than $u_c$ and terminate at the\nsingularity at $u=-\\infty$ $(r=0)$. For $D=D_c$ orbits of the first and second\nkinds merge and both orbits spiral an infinite number of times toward the\nunstable circular orbit $u=u_c$. For $D^2<D_c^2$ we have only orbits of one\nkind: starting at infinity, they cross the wormhole throat and terminate at the\nsingularity.\n", "  We study parafermion chains with $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ symmetry subject to a\nperiodic binary drive. We focus on the case $k=3$. We find that the chains\nsupport different Floquet edge modes at nontrivial quasienergies, distinct from\nthose for the static system. We map out the corresponding phase diagram by a\ncombination of analytics and numerics, and provide the location of $2\\pi/3$\nmodes in parameter space. We also show that the modes are robust to weak\ndisorder. While the previously studied $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant Majorana\nsystems posesses a transparent weakly interacting case where the existence of a\n$\\pi$-Majorana mode is manifest, our intrinsically strongly interacting\ngeneralization demonstrates that the existence of such a limit is not\nnecessary.\n", "  We report on the exciton propagation in polar (Al,Ga)N/GaN quantum wells over\nseveral micrometers and up to room temperature. The key ingredient to achieve\nthis result is the crystalline quality of GaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on GaN\ntemplate substrate. By comparing microphotoluminescence images of two identical\nQWs grown on sapphire and on GaN, we reveal the twofold role played by GaN\nsubstrate in the transport of excitons. First, the lower threading dislocation\ndensities in such structures yield higher exciton radiative efficiency, thus\nlimiting nonradiative losses of propagating excitons. Second, the absence of\nthe dielectric mismatch between the substrate and the epilayer strongly limits\nthe photon guiding effect in the plane of the structure,making exciton\ntransport easier to distinguish from photon propagation. Our results pave the\nway towards room-temperature gate-controlled exciton transport in wide-bandgap\npolar heterostructures.\n", "  The cold dark matter model of structure formation faces apparent problems on\ngalactic scales. Several threads point to excessive halo concentration,\nincluding central densities that rise too steeply with decreasing radius. Yet,\nrandom fluctuations in the gaseous component can 'heat' the centres of haloes,\ndecreasing their densities. We present a theoretical model deriving this effect\nfrom first principles: stochastic variations in the gas density are converted\ninto potential fluctuations that act on the dark matter; the associated force\ncorrelation function is calculated and the corresponding stochastic equation\nsolved. Assuming a power law spectrum of fluctuations with maximal and minimal\ncutoff scales, we derive the velocity dispersion imparted to the halo particles\nand the relevant relaxation time. We further perform numerical simulations,\nwith fluctuations realised as a Gaussian random field, which confirm the\nformation of a core within a timescale comparable to that derived analytically.\nNon-radial collective modes enhance the energy transport process that erases\nthe cusp, though the parametrisations of the analytical model persist.\n  In our model, the dominant contribution to the dynamical coupling driving the\ncusp-core transformation comes from the largest scale fluctuations. Yet, the\nefficiency of the transformation is independent of the value of the largest\nscale and depends weakly (linearly) on the power law exponent; it effectively\ndepends on two parameters: the gas mass fraction and the normalisation of the\npower spectrum. This suggests that cusp-core transformations observed in\nhydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation may be understood and parametrised\nin simple terms, the physical and numerical complexities of the various\nimplementations notwithstanding.\n", "  Brownian motion is the only random process which is Gaussian, stationary and\nMarkovian. Dropping the Markovian property, i.e. allowing for memory, one\nobtains a class of processes called fractional Brownian motion, indexed by the\nHurst exponent $H$. For $H=1/2$, Brownian motion is recovered. We develop a\nperturbative approach to treat the non-locality in time in an expansion in\n$\\varepsilon = H-1/2$. This allows us to derive analytic results beyond scaling\nexponents for various observables related to extreme value statistics: The\nmaximum $m$ of the process and the time $t_{\\text{max}}$ at which this maximum\nis reached, as well as their joint distribution. We test our analytical\npredictions with extensive numerical simulations for different values of $H$.\nThey show excellent agreement, even for $H$ far from $1/2$.\n", "  The neutrino mass hierarchy is one of the neutrino fundamental properties yet\nto be determined. We introduce a method to determine neutrino mass hierarchy by\ncomparing the interaction rate of neutral current (NC) interactions,\n$\\nu(\\hat{\\nu}) + p\\rightarrow\\nu(\\hat{\\nu}) + p$, and inverse beta decays\n(IBD), $\\bar{\\nu}_e + p\\rightarrow n + e^+$, of supernova neutrinos in\nscintillation detectors. Neutrino flavor conversions inside the supernova are\nsensitive to neutrino mass hierarchy. Due to Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein\neffects, the full swapping of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux with the $\\bar{\\nu}_x$\n($x=\\mu,~\\tau$) one occurs in the inverted hierarchy, while such a swapping\ndoes not occur in the normal hierarchy. As a result, more high energy IBD\nevents occur in the detector for the inverted hierarchy than the high energy\nIBD events in the normal hierarchy. By comparing IBD interaction rate with the\nmass hierarchy independent NC interaction rate, one can determine the neutrino\nmass hierarchy.\n", "  We generalize the state-of-the-art perturbative Equation of State of cold\nquark matter to nonzero temperatures, needed in the description of neutron star\nmergers and core collapse processes. The new result is accurate to order g^5 in\nthe gauge coupling, and is based on a novel framework for dealing with the\ninfrared sensitive soft field modes of the theory. The zero Matsubara mode\nsector is treated using a dimensionally reduced effective theory, while the\nsoft non-zero modes are resummed using the Hard Thermal Loop approximation.\nThis combination of known effective descriptions offers unprecedented access to\nsmall but nonzero temperatures, both in and out of beta equilibrium.\n", "  We study the frictional drag between carriers in two bilayer graphene flakes\nseparated by a 2 $-$ 5 nm thick hexagonal boron nitride dielectric. At\ntemperatures ($T$) lower than $\\sim$ 10 K, we observe a large anomalous\nnegative drag emerging predominantly near the drag layer charge neutrality. The\nanomalous drag resistivity increases dramatically with reducing {\\it T}, and\nbecomes comparable to the layer resistivity at the lowest {\\it T} = 1.5 K. At\nlow $T$ the drag resistivity exhibits a breakdown of layer reciprocity. A\ncomparison of the drag resistivity and the drag layer Peltier coefficient\nsuggests a thermoelectric origin of this anomalous drag.\n", "  Nucleonic matter is described within a su(2) extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. Several parametrizations with different nuclear matter saturation\nproperties are proposed. At subsaturation, nuclear pasta phases are calculated\nwithin two methods: the coexistence-phases approximation and the compressible\nliquid drop model, with the surface tension coefficient determined using a\ngeometrical approach at zero temperature. An unified equation of state of\nstellar matter for the inner crust, with the nuclear pasta phases, and the core\nis calculated. The mass and radius of neutron stars within this framework are\nobtained for several families of hadronic and hybrid stars. The quark phase of\nhybrid stars is described within the su(3) NJL model including a vector term.\nStellar macroscopic properties are in accordance with some of the recent\nresults in the literature.\n", "  We obtain a closed system of equations for scalar perturbations in a\nmulti-component braneworld. Our braneworld possesses a phantom-like equation of\nstate at late times, $w_{\\rm eff} < -1$, but no big-rip future singularity. In\naddition to matter and radiation, the braneworld possesses a new effective\ndegree of freedom - the 'Weyl fluid' or 'dark radiation'. Setting initial\nconditions on super-Hubble spatial scales at the epoch of radiation domination,\nwe evolve perturbations of radiation, pressureless matter and the Weyl fluid\nuntil the present epoch. We observe a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the\nWeyl-fluid perturbations after Hubble-radius crossing, which results in a\nnegligible effect of the Weyl fluid on the evolution of matter perturbations on\nspatial scales relevant for structure formation. Consequently, the quasi-static\napproximation of Koyama and Maartens provides a good fit to the exact results\nduring the matter-dominated epoch. We find that the late-time growth of density\nperturbations on the brane proceeds at a faster rate than in $\\Lambda$CDM.\nAdditionally, the gravitational potentials $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ evolve differently\non the brane than in $\\Lambda$CDM, for which $\\Phi = \\Psi$. On the brane, by\ncontrast, the ratio $\\Phi/\\Psi$ exceeds unity during the late matter-dominated\nepoch ($z \\lesssim 50$). These features emerge as \"smoking gun\" tests of\nphantom brane cosmology and allow predictions of this scenario to be tested\nagainst observations of galaxy clustering and large-scale structure.\n", "  Quantum phase slips (QPS) generate voltage fluctuations in superconducting\nnanowires. Employing Keldysh technique and making use of the phase-charge\nduality arguments we develop a theory of QPS-induced voltage noise in such\nnanowires. We demonstrate that quantum tunneling of the magnetic flux quanta\nacross the wire yields quantum shot noise which obeys Poisson statistics and is\ncharacterized by a power law dependence of its spectrum $S_\\Omega$ on the\nexternal bias. In long wires $S_\\Omega$ decreases with increasing frequency\n$\\Omega$ and vanishes beyond a threshold value of $\\Omega$ at $T \\to 0$.\nQuantum coherent nature of QPS noise yields non-monotonous dependence of\n$S_\\Omega$ on $T$ at small $\\Omega$.\n", "  We compute the $S$-factor of the proton-proton ($pp$) fusion reaction using\nchiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) up to next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO) and perform a rigorous uncertainty analysis of the results. We quantify\nthe uncertainties due to (i) the computational method used to compute the $pp$\ncross section in momentum space, (ii) the statistical uncertainties in the\nlow-energy coupling constants of $\\chi$EFT, (iii) the systematic uncertainty\ndue to the $\\chi$EFT cutoff, and (iv) systematic variations in the database\nused to calibrate the nucleon-nucleon interaction. We also examine the\nrobustness of the polynomial extrapolation procedure, which is commonly used to\nextract the threshold $S$-factor and its energy-derivatives. By performing a\nstatistical analysis of the polynomial fit of the energy-dependent $S$-factor\nat several different energy intervals, we eliminate a systematic uncertainty\nthat can arise from the choice of the fit interval in our calculations. In\naddition, we explore the statistical correlations between the $S$-factor and\nfew-nucleon observables such as the binding energies and point-proton radii of\n$^{2,3}$H and $^3$He as well as the $D$-state probability and quadrupole moment\nof $^2$H, and the $\\beta$-decay of $^{3}$H. We find that, with the\nstate-of-the-art optimization of the nuclear Hamiltonian, the statistical\nuncertainty in the threshold $S$-factor cannot be reduced beyond 0.7%.\n", "  We analyze a static and spherically symmetric hairy black hole solution in\nnon-invariant massive gravity. The formalism of geometrothermodynamics is used\nto describe the thermodynamic characteristics of this black hole in a Legendre\ninvariant way. For a black hole in massive gravity, the geometry of the space\nof equilibrium states is computed showing that it contains information about\nthe thermodynamic interaction, critical points and phase transitions structure.\n", "  The far-infrared fine-structure line [CII] at 1900.5\\,GHz is known to be one\nof the brightest cooling lines in local galaxies, and therefore it has been\nsuggested to be an efficient tracer for star-formation in very high-redshift\ngalaxies. However, recent results for galaxies at $z>6$ have yielded numerous\nnon-detections in star-forming galaxies, except for quasars and submillimeter\ngalaxies. We report the results of ALMA observations of two lensed,\nstar-forming galaxies at $z = 6.029$ and $z=6.703$. The galaxy A383-5.1 (star\nformation rate [SFR] of 3.2 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and magnification of $\\mu =\n11.4\\pm1.9$) shows a line detection with $L_{\\rm [CII]} = 8.9\\times10^{6}$\nL$_\\odot$, making it the lowest $L_{\\rm [CII]}$ detection at $z>6$. For\nMS0451-H (SFR = 0.4 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\\mu = 100\\pm20$) we provide an\nupper limit of $L_{\\rm [CII]} < 3\\times10^{5}$ L$_\\odot$, which is 1\\,dex below\nthe local SFR-$L_{\\rm [CII]}$ relations. The results are consistent with\npredictions for low-metallicity galaxies at $z>6$, however, other effects could\nalso play a role in terms of decreasing $L_{\\rm [CII]}$. The detection of\nA383-5.1 is encouraging and suggests that detections are possible, but much\nfainter than initially predicted.\n", "  Optical potentials for $K^+$-nucleus interactions are constructed from\n$K^+$-nucleon amplitudes using recently developed algorithm based on $K^+$-N\nkinematics in the nuclear medium. With the deep penetration of $K^+$ mesons\ninto the nucleus at momenta below 800~MeV/c it is possible to test this\napproach with greater sensitivity than hitherto done with $K^-$ and pions. The\nenergy-dependence of experimental reaction and total cross sections on nuclei\nis better reproduced with this approach compared to fixed-energy amplitudes.\nThe inclusion of Pauli correlations in the medium also improves the agreement\nbetween calculation and experiment. The absolute scale of the cross sections is\nreproduced very well for $^6$Li but for C, Si and Ca calculated cross sections\nare (23$\\pm4$)\\% smaller than experiment, in agreement with earlier analyses.\nTwo phenomenological models that produce such missing strength suggest that the\nimaginary part of the potential needs about 40\\% enhancement.\n", "  We describe theoretically the depairing effect of a microwave field on\ndiffusive s-wave superconductors. The ground state of the superconductor is\naltered qualitatively in analogy to the depairing due to a dc current. In\ncontrast to dc-depairing the density of states acquires, for microwaves with\nfrequency $\\omega_0$, steps at multiples of the photon energy $\\Delta\\pm\nn\\hbar\\omega_0$ and shows an exponential-like tail in the subgap regime. We\nshow that this ac-depairing explains the measured frequency shift of a\nsuperconducting resonator with microwave power at low temperatures.\n", "  We provide a rigorous treatment of the entanglement properties of two-mode\nGaussian states in atmospheric channels by deriving and analyzing the\ninput-output relations for the corresponding entanglement test. A key feature\nof such turbulent channels is a non-trivial dependence of the transmitted\ncontinuous-variable entanglement on coherent displacements of the quantum state\nof the input field. Remarkably, this allows one to optimize the entanglement\ncertification by modifying local coherent amplitudes using a finite, but\noptimal amount of squeezing. In addition, we propose a protocol which, in\nprinciple, renders it possible to transfer the Gaussian entanglement through\nany turbulent channel over arbitrary distances. Therefore, our approach\nprovides the theoretical foundation for advanced applications of Gaussian\nentanglement in free-space quantum communication.\n", "  This is the first of two papers describing the observations and cataloguing\nof deep 3-GHz observations of the Lockman Hole North using the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array. The aim of this paper is to investigate, through the use of\nsimulated images, the uncertainties and accuracy of source-finding routines, as\nwell as to quantify systematic effects due to resolution, such as source\nconfusion and source size. While these effects are not new, this work is\nintended as a particular case study that can be scaled and translated to other\nsurveys. We use the simulations to derive uncertainties in the fitted\nparameters, as well as bias corrections for the actual catalogue (presented in\nPaper 2). We compare two different source-finding routines, OBIT and AEGEAN,\nand two different effective resolutions, 8 and 2.75 arcsec. We find that the\ntwo routines perform comparably well, with OBIT being slightly better at\nde-blending sources, but slightly worse at fitting resolved sources. We show\nthat 30 to 70 per cent of sources are missed or fit inaccurately once the\nsource size becomes larger than the beam, possibly explaining source count\nerrors in high-resolution surveys. We also investigate the effect of blending,\nfinding that any sources with separations smaller than the beam size are fit as\nsingle sources. We show that the use of machine-learning techniques can\ncorrectly identify blended sources up to 90 per cent of the time, and\nprior-driven fitting can lead to a 70 per cent improvement in the number of\nde-blended sources.\n", "  We numerically exhibit strange scaling and temporal evolution of finite-size\nfluctuation in thermal equilibrium of a simple long-range interacting system.\nThese phenomena are explained from the view point of existence of the Casimirs\nand their nonexactness in finite-size systems, where the Casimirs are\ninvariants in the Vlasov dynamics describing the long-range systems in the\nlimit of large population. This explanation expects appearance of the reported\nphenomena in a wide class of isolated long-range systems. The scaling theory is\nalso discussed as an application of the strange scaling.\n", "  The ground state and transport properties of the Lieb lattice flat band in\nthe presence of an attractive Hubbard interaction are considered. It is shown\nthat the superfluid weight can be large even for an isolated and strictly flat\nband. Moreover the superfluid weight is proportional to the interaction\nstrength and to the quantum metric, a band structure invariant obtained from\nthe flat-band Bloch functions. These predictions are amenable to verification\nwith ultracold gases and may explain the anomalous behaviour of the superfluid\nweight of high-Tc superconductors.\n", "  We present a collection of $\\mathrm{CP}$-odd observables for the process\n$pp\\to t\\,\\left(\\rightarrow b {\\ell}^+ \\nu_{\\ell}\\right)\n\\bar{t}\\,\\left(\\rightarrow \\bar{b} {\\ell}^-{\\bar{\\nu}}_{\\ell}\\right)\\,H$ that\nare linearly dependent on the scalar ($\\kappa_t$) and pseudoscalar\n($\\tilde{\\kappa}_t$) top-Higgs coupling and hence sensitive to the\ncorresponding relative sign. The proposed observables are based on triple\nproduct (TP) correlations that we extract from the expression for the\ndifferential cross section in terms of the spin vectors of the top and antitop\nquarks. In order to explore other possibilities, we progressively modify these\nTPs, first by combining them, and then by replacing the spin vectors by the\nlepton momenta or the $t$ and $\\bar{t}$ momenta by their visible parts. We\ngenerate Monte Carlo data sets for several benchmark scenarios, including the\nStandard Model ($\\kappa_t=1$, $\\tilde{\\kappa}_t=0$) and two scenarios with\nmixed $\\mathrm{CP}$ properties ($\\kappa_t=1$, $\\tilde{\\kappa}_t=\\pm 1$).\nAssuming an integrated luminosity that is consistent with that envisioned for\nthe High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, using Monte Carlo-truth and taking\ninto account only statistical uncertainties, we find that the most promising\nobservable can disentangle the \"$\\mathrm{CP}$-mixed\" scenarios with an\neffective separation of $\\sim 19\\sigma$. In the case of observables that do not\nrequire the reconstruction of the $t$ and $\\bar{t}$ momenta, the power of\ndiscrimination is up to $\\sim 13\\sigma$ for the same number of events. We also\nshow that the most promising observables can still disentangle the\n$\\mathrm{CP}$-mixed scenarios when the number of events is reduced to values\nconsistent with expectations for the Large Hadron Collider in the near term.\n", "  Using the analytic modeling of the electromagnetic cascades compared with\nmore precise numerical simulations we describe the physical properties of\nelectromagnetic cascades developing in the universe on CMB and EBL background\nradiations. A cascade is initiated by very high energy photon or electron and\nthe remnant photons at large distance have two-component energy spectrum,\n$\\propto E^{-2}$ ($\\propto E^{-1.9}$ in numerical simulations) produced at\ncascade multiplication stage, and $\\propto E^{-3/2}$ from Inverse Compton\nelectron cooling at low energies. The most noticeable property of the cascade\nspectrum in analytic modeling is 'strong universality', which includes the\nstandard energy spectrum and the energy density of the cascade $\\omega_{\\rm\ncas}$ as its only numerical parameter. Using numerical simulations of the\ncascade spectrum and comparing it with recent Fermi LAT spectrum we obtained\nthe upper limit on $\\omega_{\\rm cas}$ stronger than in previous works. The new\nfeature of the analysis is \"$E_{\\max}$ rule\". We investigate the dependence of\n$\\omega_{\\rm cas}$ on the distribution of sources, distinguishing two cases of\nuniversality: the strong and weak ones.\n", "  As star-forming clouds collapse, the gas within them fragments to\never-smaller masses. Naively one might expect this process to continue down to\nthe smallest mass that is able to radiate away its binding energy on a\ndynamical timescale, the opacity limit for fragmentation, at $\\sim 0.01$\n$M_\\odot$. However, the observed peak of the initial mass function (IMF) lies a\nfactor of $20-30$ higher in mass, suggesting that some other mechanism halts\nfragmentation before the opacity limit is reached. In this paper we analyse\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in typical\nMilky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits\nfragmentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that\nform in the simulations to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented\nfrom fragmenting by thermal and magnetic pressure. We show that, on small\nscales, thermal pressure enhanced by stellar radiation heating is the dominant\nmechanism limiting the ability of the gas to further fragment. In the brown\ndwarf mass regime, $\\sim 0.01$ $M_\\odot$, the typical object that forms in the\nsimulations is surrounded by gas whose mass is several times its own that is\nunable to escape or fragment, and instead is likely to accrete. This mechanism\nexplains why $\\sim 0.01$ $M_\\odot$ objects are rare: unless an outside agent\nintervenes (e.g., a shock strips away the gas around them), they will grow by\naccreting the warmed gas around them. In contrast, by the time stars grow to\nmasses of $\\sim 0.2$ $M_\\odot$, the mass of heated gas is only tens of percent\nof the central star mass, too small to alter its final mass by a large factor.\nThis naturally explains why the IMF peak is at $\\sim 0.2$ $M_\\odot$.\n", "  We study the effect of impurity scattering effect in black phosphorurene (BP)\nin this work. For single impurity, we calculate impurity induced local density\nof states (LDOS) in momentum space numerically based on tight-binding\nHamiltonian. In real space, we calculate LDOS and Friedel oscillation\nanalytically. LDOS shows strong anisotropy in BP. Many impurities in BP are\ninvestigated using $T$-matrix approximation when the density is low. Midgap\nstates appear in band gap with peaks in DOS. The peaks of midgap states are\ndependent on impurity potential. For finite positive potential, the impurity\ntends to bind negative charge carriers and vise versa. The infinite impurity\npotential problem is related to chiral symmetry in BP.\n", "  We present a new perspective on gravitational lensing. We describe a new\nextension of the weak lensing formalism capable of describing strongly lensed\nimages. By integrating the non-linear geodesic deviation equation, the\namplification matrix of weak lensing is generalised to a sum over independent\namplification tensors of increasing rank. We show how an image distorted by a\ngeneric lens may be constructed as a sum over `roulettes', which are the\nnatural curves associated with the independent spin modes of the amplification\ntensors. Highly distorted images can be constructed even for large sources\nobserved near or within the Einstein radius of a lens where the shear and\nconvergence are large. The amplitude of each roulette is formed from a sum over\nappropriate derivatives of the lensing potential. Consequently, measuring these\nindividual roulettes for images around a lens gives a new way to reconstruct a\nstrong lens mass distribution without requiring a lens model. This formalism\ngeneralises the convergence, shear and flexion of weak lensing to arbitrary\norder, and provides a unified bridge between the strong and weak lensing\nregimes.\n  This overview paper is accompanied by a much more detailed Paper II,\narXiv:1603.04652\n", "  Positive and negative ions forming so-called pair plasma differing in sign of\ntheir charge but asymmetric in mass and temperature support a new acoustic mode\nwhere damping of heavier ion dominates. The condition for the excitation of ion\nsound wave through electron beam induced Cherenkov instability is also\ninvestigated. This beam can generate a perturbation in the pair ion plasmas in\nthe presence of electrons when there is number density, temperature and mass\ndifference in the two species of ions. Basic emphasis is on the focusing of ion\nsound waves and we show how, in the area of localization of wave energy, the\ndensity of pair particles increases while electrons are pushed away from that\nregion. Further, this localization of wave is dependent on the shape of the\npulse. Considering the example of pancake and bullet shaped pulses, we find\nthat only the former leads to compression of pair ions in the supersonic regime\nof the focusing region. Here possible existence of regions where pure pair\nparticles can exist may also be speculated which is not only useful from\nacademic point of view but also to mimic the situation of plasma (electro\npositron asymmetric and symmetric) observed in astrophysical environment.\n", "  We present and test a method that dramatically reduces variance arising from\nthe sparse sampling of wavemodes in cosmological simulations. The method uses\ntwo simulations which are fixed (the initial Fourier mode amplitudes are fixed\nto the ensemble average power spectrum) and paired (with initial modes exactly\nout of phase). We measure the power spectrum, monopole and quadrupole\nredshift-space correlation functions, halo mass function and reduced bispectrum\nat $z=1$. By these measures, predictions from a fixed pair can be as precise on\nnon-linear scales as an average over 50 traditional simulations. The fixing\nprocedure introduces a non-Gaussian correction to the initial conditions; we\ngive an analytic argument showing why the simulations are still able to predict\nthe mean properties of the Gaussian ensemble. We anticipate that the method\nwill drive down the computational time requirements for accurate large-scale\nexplorations of galaxy bias and clustering statistics, enabling more precise\ncomparisons with theoretical models, and facilitating the use of numerical\nsimulations in cosmological data interpretation.\n", "  It is critical to capture the effect due to strain and material interface for\ndevice level transistor modeling. We introduced a transferable sp3d5s* tight\nbinding model with nearest neighbor interactions for arbitrarily strained group\nIV and III-V materials. The tight binding model is parameterized with respect\nto Hybrid functional(HSE06) calculations for varieties of strained systems. The\ntight binding calculations of ultra small superlattices formed by group IV and\ngroup III-V materials show good agreement with the corresponding HSE06\ncalculations. The application of tight binding model to superlattices\ndemonstrates that transferable tight binding model with nearest neighbor\ninteractions can be obtained for group IV and III-V materials.\n", "  Starting from a relativistic Lagrangian for pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons and\nvector mesons in the antisymmetric tensor representation, a one-loop\ncalculation is performed to pin down the divergent structures that appear for\nthe effective low-energy action at chiral orders Q^2 and Q^4. The corresponding\nrenormalisation-scale dependences of all low-energy constants up to chiral\norder Q^4 are determined. Calculations are carried out for both the\npseudoscalar octet and the pseudoscalar nonet, the latter in the framework of\nchiral perturbation theory in the limit of a large number of colours.\n", "  We investigate a method to construct parametrized progenitor models for\ncore-collapse supernova simulations. Different from all modern core-collapse\nsupernova studies, which rely on progenitor models from stellar evolution\ncalculations, we follow the methodology of Baron & Cooperstein (1990) to\nconstruct initial models. Choosing parametrized spatial distributions of\nentropy and electron fraction as a function of mass coordinate and solving the\nequation of hydrostatic equilibrium, we obtain the initial density structures\nof our progenitor models. First, we calculate structures with parameters\nfitting broadly the evolutionary model s11.2 of Woosley et al. (2002). We then\ndemonstrate the reliability of our method by performing general relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry with the isotropic diffusion\nsource approximation to solve the neutrino transport. Our comprehensive\nparameter study shows that initial models with a small central entropy\n($\\lesssim 0.4\\,k_B$ nucleon$^{-1}$) can explode even in spherically symmetric\nsimulations. Models with a large entropy ($\\gtrsim 6\\,k_B$ nucleon$^{-1}$) in\nthe Si/O layer have a rather large explosion energy ($\\sim 4\\times 10^{50}$\nerg) at the end of the simulations, which is still rapidly increasing.\n", "  We show that the aging dynamics of a strong glass former displays a\nstrikingly simple scaling behavior, connecting the average dynamics with its\nfluctuations, namely the dynamical heterogeneities. We perform molecular\ndynamics simulations of SiO$_2$ with BKS interactions, quenching the system\nfrom high to low temperature, and study the evolution of the system as a\nfunction of the waiting time $t_{\\rm w}$ measured from the instant of the\nquench. We find that both the aging behavior of the dynamic susceptibility\n$\\chi_4$ and the aging behavior of the probability distribution $P(f_{{\\rm\ns},{\\mathbf r}})$ of the local incoherent intermediate scattering function\n$f_{{\\rm s},{\\mathbf r}}$ can be described by simple scaling forms in terms of\nthe global incoherent intermediate scattering function $C$. The scaling forms\nare the same that have been found to describe the aging of several fragile\nglass formers and that, in the case of $P(f_{{\\rm s},{\\mathbf r}})$, have been\nalso predicted theoretically. A thorough study of the length scales involved\nhighlights the importance of intermediate length scales. We also analyze\ndirectly the scaling dependence on particle type and on wavevector $q$, and\nfind that both the average and the fluctuations of the slow aging dynamics are\ncontrolled by a unique aging clock, which is not only independent of the\nwavevector $q$, but is the same for O and Si atoms.\n", "  Within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), we\nexplore a decoupling of the parameters into separate sectors that determine\nconsistency with collider data, the abundance of dark matter, and potential\nsignatures at direct dark matter searches. We consider weak-scale bino-like\nneutralino dark matter, and find that annihilations via light slepton exchange\npresent a viable mechanism for obtaining the appropriate dark matter abundance\nassuming a thermal history. Constraints and prospects for discovery of these\nmodels are discussed, including the possibility that direct dark matter\nsearches may be sensitive to these models if light squarks exhibit left-right\nmixing. Differences between the scenarios presented here and the typical\nexpectations for the MSSM are discussed.\n", "  Impulsive interband excitation with femtosecond near-infrared pulses\nestablishes a plasma response in intrinsic germanium structures fabricated on a\nsilicon substrate. This direct approach activates the plasmonic resonance of\nthe Ge structures and enables their use as optical antennas up to the\nmid-infrared spectral range. The optical switching lasts for hundreds of\npicoseconds until charge recombination red-shifts the plasma frequency. The\nfull behavior of the structures is modeled by the electrodynamic response\nestablished by an electron-hole plasma in a regular array of antennas.\n", "  A powerful approach to analysing quantum systems with dimensionality $d>1$\ninvolves adding a weak coupling to an array of one-dimensional (1D) chains. The\nresultant quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) systems can exhibit long-range order at\nlow temperature, but are heavily influenced by interactions and disorder due to\ntheir large anisotropies. Real q1D materials are therefore ideal candidates not\nonly to provoke, test and refine theories of strongly correlated matter, but\nalso to search for unusual emergent electronic phases. Here we report the\nunprecedented enhancement of a superconducting instability by disorder in\nsingle crystals of Na$_{2-\\delta}$Mo$_6$Se$_6$, a q1D superconductor comprising\nMoSe chains weakly coupled by Na atoms. We argue that disorder-enhanced Coulomb\npair-breaking (which usually destroys superconductivity) may be averted due to\na screened long-range Coulomb repulsion intrinsic to disordered q1D materials.\nOur results illustrate the capability of disorder to tune and induce new\ncorrelated electron physics in low-dimensional materials.\n", "  A nearby source of Lyman-Werner (LW) photons is thought to be a central\ncomponent in dissociating H$_2$ and allowing for the formation of a direct\ncollapse black hole seed. Nearby sources are also expected to produce copious\namounts of hydrogen ionising photons and X-ray photons. We study here the\nfeedback effects of the X-ray photons by including a spectrum due to high-mass\nX-ray binaries on top of a galaxy with a stellar spectrum. We explicitly trace\nphoton packages emerging from the nearby source and track the radiative and\nchemical effects of the multi-frequency source $(E_{\\rm photon} = \\rm{0.76\\ eV\n\\rightarrow 7500\\ eV}$). We find that X-rays have a strongly negative feedback\neffect, compared to a stellar only source, when the radiative source is placed\nat a separation greater than $\\gtrsim 1 \\ \\rm kpc$. The X-rays heat the low and\nmedium density gas in the envelope surrounding the collapsing halo suppressing\nthe mass inflow. The result is a smaller enclosed mass compared to the stellar\nonly case. However, for separations of $\\lesssim 1 \\ \\rm kpc$, the feedback\neffects of the X-rays becomes somewhat neutral. The enhanced LW intensity at\nclose separations dissociates more H$_2$ and this gas is heated due to stellar\nphotons alone, the addition of X-rays is then not significant. This distance\ndependence of X-ray feedback suggests that a Goldilocks zone exists close to a\nforming galaxy where X-ray photons have a much smaller negative feedback effect\nand ideal conditions exist for creating massive black hole seeds.\n", "  We apply pseudo-spectral methods to integrate functional flow equations with\nhigh accuracy, extending earlier work on functional fixed point equations\n\\cite{Borchardt:2015rxa}. The advantages of our method are illustrated with the\nhelp of two classes of models: first, to make contact with literature, we\ninvestigate flows of the O$(N)$-model in 3 dimensions, for $N=1, 4$ and in the\nlarge $N$ limit. For the case of a fractal dimension, $d=2.4$, and $N=1$, we\nfollow the flow along a separatrix from a multicritical fixed point to the\nWilson-Fisher fixed point over almost 13 orders of magnitude. As a second\nexample, we consider flows of bounded quantum-mechanical potentials, which can\nbe considered as a toy model for Higgs inflation. Such flows pose substantial\nnumerical difficulties, and represent a perfect test bed to exemplify the power\nof pseudo-spectral methods.\n", "  The recent discovery of the gravitational wave source GW150914 has revealed a\ncoalescing binary black hole (BBH) with masses of $\\sim 30~M_\\odot$. Previous\nproposals for the origin of such a massive binary include Population III\n(PopIII) stars. PopIII stars are efficient producers of BBHs and of a\ngravitational wave background (GWB) in the $10-100$ Hz band, and also of\nionizing radiation in the early Universe. We quantify the relation between the\namplitude of the GWB ($\\Omega_{\\rm gw}$) and the electron scattering optical\ndepth ($\\tau_{\\rm e}$), produced by PopIII stars, assuming that $f_{\\rm\nesc}\\approx 10\\%$ of their ionizing radiation escapes into the intergalactic\nmedium. We find that PopIII stars would produce a GWB that is detectable by the\nfuture O5 LIGO/Virgo if $\\tau_{\\rm e} \\gtrsim 0.07$, consistent with the recent\nPlanck measurement of $\\tau_e=0.055 \\pm 0.09$. Moreover, the spectral index of\nthe background from PopIII BBHs becomes as small as ${\\rm d}\\ln \\Omega_{\\rm\ngw}/{\\rm d}\\ln f\\lesssim 0.3$ at $f \\gtrsim 30$ Hz, which is significantly\nflatter than the value $\\sim 2/3$ generically produced by lower-redshift and\nless-massive BBHs. A detection of the unique flattening at such low frequencies\nby the O5 LIGO/Virgo will indicate the existence of a high-chirp mass,\nhigh-redshift BBH population, which is consistent with the PopIII origin. A\nprecise characterization of the spectral shape near $30-50$ Hz by the Einstein\nTelescope could also constrain the PopIII initial mass function and star\nformation rate.\n", "  Background The intense current experimental interest in studying the\nstructure of the deuteron and using it to enable accurate studies of neutron\nstructure motivate us to examine the four-dimensional space-time nature of the\nnuclear wave function, and the various approximations used to reduce it to an\nobject that depends only on three spatial variables.\n  Purpose: The aim is to determine if the ability to understand and analyze\nmeasured experimental cross sections is compromised by making the reduction\nfrom four to three dimensions.\n  Method: Simple, exactly-calculable, covariant models of a bound-state wave\nstate wave function (a scalar boson made of two constituent-scalar bosons) with\nparameters chosen to represent a deuteron are used to investigate the accuracy\nof using different approximations to the nuclear wave function to compute the\nquasi-elastic scattering cross section. Four different versions of the wave\nfunction are defined (light-front spectator, light-front, light-front with\nscaling and non-relativistic) and used to compute the cross sections as a\nfunction of how far off the mass-shell (how virtual) is the struck constituent.\n  Results: We show that making an exact calculation of the quasi-elastic\nscattering cross section involves using the light-front spectator wave\nfunction. All of the other approaches fail to reproduce the model exact\ncalculation if the value of Bjorken $x$ differs from unity. The model is\nextended to consider an essential effect of spin to show that constituent\nnucleons cannot be treated as being on their mass shell even when taking the\nmatrix element of a `good' current.\n  Conclusions: It is necessary to develop realistic light-front spectator wave\nfunctions to meet the needs of current and planned experiments.\n", "  We consider a class of {\\em quantum Hall topological insulators}:\ntopologically nontrivial states with zero Chern number at finite magnetic\nfield, in which the counter-propagating edge states are protected by a symmetry\n(spatial or spin) other than time-reversal. HgTe-type heterostructures and\ngraphene are among the relevant systems. We study the effect of electron\ninteractions on the topological properties of the system. We particularly focus\non the vicinity of the topological phase transition, marked by the crossing of\ntwo Landau levels, where the system is a strongly interacting quantum Hall\nferromagnet. We analyse the edge properties using the formalism of the\nnonlinear $\\sigma$-model. We establish the symmetry requirement for the\ntopological protection in this interacting system: effective continuous U(1)\nsymmetry with respect to uniaxial isospin rotations must be preserved. If U(1)\nsymmetry is preserved, the topologically nontrivial phase persists; its edge is\na helical Luttinger liquid with highly tunable effective interactions. We\nobtain explicit analytical expressions for the parameters of the Luttinger\nliquid. However, U(1) symmetry may be broken, either spontaneously or by\nU(1)-asymmetric interactions. In either case, interaction-induced transitions\noccur to the respective topologically trivial phases with gapped edge charge\nexcitations.\n", "  Understanding the processes that could lead to enrichment of molecules in\n$^{15}$N atoms is of particular interest in order to shed light on the\nrelatively large variations observed in the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in various\nsolar system environments. Currently, the sample of molecular clouds where\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios have been measured is small and has to be enlarged in\norder to allow statistically significant studies. In particular, the N$_2$H$^+$\nmolecule currently shows the largest spread of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios in\nhigh-mass star forming regions. However, the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in\nN$_2$H$^+$ was obtained in only two low-mass star forming regions (L1544 and\nB1b). The current work extends this sample to a third dark cloud. We targeted\nthe 16293E prestellar core, where the N$^{15}$NH$^+$ $J$=1-0 line was detected.\nUsing a model previously developed for the physical structure of the source, we\nsolved the molecular excitation with a non-local radiative transfer code. For\nthat purpose, we computed specific collisional rate coefficients for the\nN$^{15}$NH$^+$-H$_2$ collisional system. As a first step of the analysis, the\nN$_2$H$^+$ abundance profile was constrained by reproducing the N$_2$H$^+$\n$J$=1-0 and 3-2 maps. A scaling factor was then applied to this profile to\nmatch the N$^{15}$NH$^+$ $J$=1-0 spectrum. We derive a column density ratio\nN$_2$H$^+$ / N$^{15}$NH$^+$ = $330^{+170}_{-100}$. The current estimate\n$\\sim$330 agrees with the value typical of the elemental isotopic ratio in the\nlocal ISM. It is however lower than in some other cores, where values as high\nas 1300 have been reported.\n", "  Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models struggle to match the observations at galactic\nscales. The tension can be reduced either by dramatic baryonic feedback effects\nor by modifying the particle physics of CDM. Here, we consider an ultra-light\nscalar field DM particle manifesting a wave nature below a DM particle\nmass-dependent Jeans scale. For DM mass $m\\sim10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, this scenario\ndelays galaxy formation and avoids cusps in the center of the dark matter\nhaloes. We use new measurements of half-light mass in ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies Draco II and Triangulum II to estimate the mass of the DM particle in\nthis model. We find that if the stellar populations are within the core of the\ndensity profile then the data are in agreement with a wave dark matter model\nhaving a DM particle with $m\\sim 3.7-5.6\\times 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$. The presence\nof this extremely light particle will contribute to the formation of a central\nsolitonic core replacing the cusp of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and bringing\npredictions closer to observations of cored central density in dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We derive thermodynamic product relations for four-parametric regular black\nhole (BH) solutions of the Einstein equations coupled with a non-linear\nelectrodynamics source. The four parameters can be described by the mass ($m$),\ncharge ($q$), dipole moment ($\\alpha$) and quadrupole moment ($\\beta$)\nrespectively. We study its complete thermodynamics. We compute different\nthermodynamic products i.e. area product, BH temperature product, specific heat\nproduct and Komar energy product respectively. Furthermore, we show that some\ncomplicated function of horizon areas that is indeed \\emph{mass-independent}\nand could turn out to be \\emph{universal}.\n", "  Motivated by the successes of covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory in\none-baryon systems and in heavy-light systems, we study relevance of\nrelativistic effects in hyperon-nucleon interactions with strangeness $S=-1$.\nIn this exploratory work, we follow the covariant framework developed by\nEpelbaum and Gegelia to calculate the $YN$ scattering amplitude at leading\norder. By fitting the five low-energy constants to the experimental data, we\nfind that the cutoff dependence is mitigated, compared with the heavy-baryon\napproach. Nevertheless, the description of the experimental data remains\nquantitatively similar at leading order.\n", "  The first indication of the presence of a circumstellar debris disk is\nusually the detection of excess infrared emission from the population of small\ndust grains orbiting the star. This dust is short-lived, requiring continual\nreplenishment, and indicating that the disk must be excited by an unseen\nperturber. Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated that an eccentric\nplanet orbiting interior to the disk will stir the larger bodies in the belt\nand produce dust via interparticle collisions. However, motivated by recent\nobservations, we explore another possible mechanism for heating a debris disk:\na stellar-mass perturber orbiting exterior to and inclined to the disk and\nexciting the disk particles' eccentricities and inclinations via the\nKozai-Lidov mechanism. We explore the consequences of an exterior perturber on\nthe evolution of a debris disk using secular analysis and collisional N-body\nsimulations. We demonstrate that a Kozai-Lidov excited disk can generate a dust\ndisk via collisions and we compare the results of the Kozai-Lidov excited disk\nwith a simulated disk perturbed by an interior eccentric planet. Finally, we\npropose two observational tests of a dust disk that can distinguish whether the\ndust was produced by an exterior brown dwarf or stellar companion or an\ninterior eccentric planet.\n", "  Correlations in the orbits of several minor planets in the outer solar system\nsuggest the presence of a remote, massive Planet Nine. With at least ten times\nthe mass of the Earth and a perihelion well beyond 100 AU, Planet Nine poses a\nchallenge to planet formation theory. Here we expand on a scenario in which the\nplanet formed closer to the Sun and was gravitationally scattered by Jupiter or\nSaturn onto a very eccentric orbit in an extended gaseous disk. Dynamical\nfriction with the gas then allowed the planet to settle in the outer solar\nsystem. We explore this possibility with a set of numerical simulations.\nDepending on how the gas disk evolves, scattered super-Earths or small gas\ngiants settle on a range of orbits, with perihelion distances as large as 300\nAU. Massive disks that clear from the inside out on million-year time scales\nyield orbits that allow a super-Earth or gas giant to shepherd the minor\nplanets as observed. A massive planet can achieve a similar orbit in a\npersistent, low-mass disk over the lifetime of the solar system.\n", "  The relationship between Koopman mode decomposition, resolvent mode\ndecomposition and exact invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations is\nclarified. The correspondence rests upon the invariance of the system operators\nunder symmetry operations such as spatial translation. The usual interpretation\nof the Koopman operator is generalised to permit combinations of such\noperations, in addition to translation in time. This invariance is related to\nthe spectrum of a spatio-temporal Koopman operator, which has a travelling wave\ninterpretation. The relationship leads to a generalisation of dynamic mode\ndecomposition, in which symmetry operations are applied to restrict the dynamic\nmodes to span a subspace subject to those symmetries. The resolvent is\ninterpreted as the mapping between the Koopman modes of the Reynolds stress\ndivergence and the velocity field. It is shown that the singular vectors of the\nresolvent (the resolvent modes) are the optimal basis in which to express the\nvelocity field Koopman modes where the latter are not a priori known.\n", "  We report the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in suites of\nnumerical $N$-body simulations of Population III remnant black holes (BHs)\nembedded in gas-rich protogalaxies at redshifts $z\\gtrsim10$. We model the\neffects of gas drag on the BHs' orbits, and allow BHs to grow via gas\naccretion, including a mode of hyper-Eddington accretion in which photon\ntrapping and rapid gas inflow suppress any negative radiative feedback. Most\ninitial BH configurations lead to the formation of one (but never more than\none) IMBH in the center of the protogalaxy, reaching a mass of\n$10^{3-5}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ through hyper-Eddington growth. Our results\nsuggest a viable pathway to forming the earliest massive BHs in the centers of\nearly galaxies. We also find that the nuclear IMBH typically captures a\nstellar-mass BH companion, making these systems observable in gravitational\nwaves as extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with \\textit{eLISA}.\n", "  The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect signal is widely recognized as a\nrobust mass proxy of galaxy clusters with small intrinsic scatter. However,\nrecent observational calibration of the tSZ scaling relation using weak lensing\n(WL) mass exhibits considerably larger scatter than the intrinsic scatter\npredicted from numerical simulations. This raises a question as to whether we\ncan realize the full statistical power of ongoing and upcoming tSZ-WL\nobservations of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the origin of\nobserved scatter in the tSZ-WL scaling relation, using mock maps of galaxy\nclusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the\ninferred intrinsic scatter from mock tSZ-WL analyses is considerably larger\nthan the intrinsic scatter measured in simulations, and comparable to the\nscatter in the observed tSZ-WL relation. We show that this enhanced scatter\noriginates from the combination of the projection of correlated structures\nalong the line of sight and the uncertainty in the cluster radius associated\nwith WL mass estimates, causing the amplitude of the scatter to depend on the\ncovariance between tSZ and WL signals. We present a statistical model to\nrecover the unbiased cluster scaling relation and cosmological parameter by\ntaking into account the covariance in the tSZ-WL mass relation from\nmulti-wavelength cluster surveys.\n", "  The cohesive energy, equilibrium lattice constant, and bulk modulus of noble\nmetals are computed by different van der Waals-corrected Density Functional\nTheory methods, including vdW-DF, vdW-DF2, vdW-DF-cx, rVV10 and PBE-D. Two\nspecifically-designed methods are also developed in order to effectively\ninclude dynamical screening effects: the DFT/vdW-WF2p method, based on the\ngeneration of Maximally Localized Wannier Functions, and the RPAp scheme (in\ntwo variants), based on a single-oscillator model of the localized electron\nresponse. Comparison with results obtained without explicit inclusion of van\nder Waals effects, such as with the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, or the hybrid PBE0\nfunctional, elucidates the importance of a suitable description of screened van\nder Waals interactions even in the case of strong metal bonding. Many-body\neffects are also quantitatively evaluated within the RPAp approach.\n", "  The decay widths of four-body double-pion decays $\\ds\\to pn \\pi^0\\pi^0$,\n$\\ds\\to pn \\pi^+\\pi^-$, and iso-scalar parts of $\\ds\\to pp \\pi^0\\pi^-$ and\n$\\ds\\to nn \\pi^+\\pi^0$ are explicitly calculated with the help of the $d^*$\nwave function obtained in a chiral SU(3) quark model calculation. The effect of\nthe dynamical structure on $\\ds$'s width is analyzed both in the single\n$\\Delta\\Delta$ channel and coupled $\\Delta\\Delta$ and $CC$ channel\napproximations. It is found that in the coupled-channel approximation, the\nobtained partial decay widths of $\\ds\\to pn \\pi^0\\pi^0$, $\\ds\\to pn\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$, and those of $d^*$ to the iso-scalar parts of $pp \\pi^0\\pi^-$ and\n$nn \\pi^+\\pi^0$ are about $7.4$MeV, $16.4$MeV, $3.5$MeV and $3.5$MeV,\nrespectively As a consequence, the total width is about $64.5$MeV. These widths\nare consistent with those estimated by using the corresponding cross section\ndata in our previous investigation and also the observed data. But in the\nsingle $\\Delta\\Delta$ channel approximation, the widths are still almost\n2-times larger than the measured values. Apparently, the explicitly calculated\nwidth together with the evaluated mass of $d^*$ in the coupled $\\Delta\\Delta$\nand $CC$ channel approximation can well explain the observed data, which again\nsupports our assertion that the $\\ds$ resonance is a six-quark dominated exotic\nstate.\n", "  The solar wind speed at 1 AU shows variations in latitude and in time which\nreflect the evolution of the global background magnetic field during the\nactivity cycle. It is commonly accepted that the terminal wind speed in a\nmagnetic flux-tube is anti-correlated with its expansion ratio, which motivated\nthe definition of widely-used semi-empirical scaling laws relating one to the\nother. In practice, such scaling laws require ad-hoc corrections. A predictive\nlaw based solely on physical principles is still missing. We test whether the\nflux-tube expansion is the controlling factor of the wind speed at all phases\nof the cycle and at all latitudes using a very large sample of wind-carrying\nopen magnetic flux-tubes. We furthermore search for additional physical\nparameters based on the geometry of the coronal magnetic field which have an\ninfluence on the terminal wind flow speed. We use MHD simulations of the corona\nand wind coupled to a dynamo model to provide a large statistical ensemble of\nopen flux-tubes which we analyse conjointly in order to identify relations of\ndependence between the wind speed and geometrical parameters of the flux-tubes\nwhich are valid globally (for all latitudes and moments of the cycle). Our\nstudy confirms that the terminal speed of the solar wind depends very strongly\non the geometry of the open magnetic flux-tubes through which it flows. The\ntotal flux-tube expansion is more clearly anti-correlated with the wind speed\nfor fast rather than for slow wind flows, and effectively controls the\nlocations of these flows during solar minima. Overall, the actual asymptotic\nwind speeds attained are also strongly dependent on field-line inclination and\nmagnetic field amplitude at the foot-points. We suggest ways of including these\nparameters on future predictive scaling-laws for the solar wind speed.\n", "  We design a Stern-Gerlach apparatus that separates quasispin components on\nthe lattice, without the use of external fields. The effect is engineered using\nintrinsic parameters, such as hopping amplitudes and on-site potentials. A\ntheoretical description of the apparatus relying on a generalized\nFoldy-Wouthuysen transformation beyond Dirac points is given. Our results are\nverified numerically by means of wavepacket evolution, including an analysis of\nZitterbewegung on the lattice. The necessary tools for microwave realizations,\nsuch as complex hopping amplitudes and chiral effects, are simulated.\n", "  Using $1.09\\times10^{9}$ $J/\\psi$ events collected by the BESIII experiment\nin 2012, we study the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta^{\\prime}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$\nprocess and observe a significant abrupt change in the slope of the\n$\\eta^{\\prime}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ invariant mass distribution at the\nproton-antiproton ($p\\bar{p}$) mass threshold. We use two models to\ncharacterize the $\\eta^{\\prime}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ line shape around\n$1.85~\\text{GeV}/c^{2}$: one which explicitly incorporates the opening of a\ndecay threshold in the mass spectrum (Flatt\\'{e} formula), and another which is\nthe coherent sum of two resonant amplitudes. Both fits show almost equally good\nagreement with data, and suggest the existence of either a broad state around\n$1.85~\\text{GeV}/c^{2}$ with strong couplings to $p\\bar{p}$ final states or a\nnarrow state just below the $p\\bar{p}$ mass threshold. Although we cannot\ndistinguish between the fits, either one supports the existence of a $p\\bar{p}$\nmolecule-like state or bound state with greater than $7\\sigma$ significance.\n", "  We derive effective Polyakov line actions for SU(3) gauge theories with\nstaggered dynamical fermions, for a small sample of lattice couplings, lattice\nactions, and lattice extensions in the time direction. The derivation is via\nthe method of relative weights, and the theories are solved at finite chemical\npotential by mean field theory. We find in some instances that the long-range\ncouplings in the effective action are very important to the phase structure,\nand that these couplings are responsible for long-lived metastable states in\nthe effective theory. Only one of these states corresponds to the underlying\nlattice gauge theory.\n", "  We present an analysis of an $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$ extension of the\nTeleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, where $T$ denotes the torsion\nand $\\mathcal{T}$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This extension\nincludes non--minimal couplings between torsion and matter. In particular, we\nconstruct two specific models that recover the usual continuity equation,\nnamely, $f(T, \\mathcal{T})=T+g(\\mathcal{T})$ and $f(T, \\mathcal{T})=T\\times\ng(\\mathcal{T})$. We then constrain the parameters of each model by fitting the\npredicted distance modulus to that measured from type Ia supernovae, and find\nthat both models can reproduce the late--time cosmic acceleration. We also\nobserve that one of the models satisfies well the observational constraints and\nyields a goodness--of--fit similar to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, thus\ndemonstrating that $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory encompasses viable models\nthat can be an alternative to $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  A large number of supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy and galaxies nearby\nhave been resolved in various radio bands. This radio emission is thought to be\nproduced via synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by the shock that\nthe supernova ejecta drives into the external medium. Here we consider the\nsample of radio SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds. Given the size and radio flux of\na SNR, we seek to constrain the fraction of shocked fluid energy in non-thermal\nelectrons ($\\epsilon_e$) and magnetic field ($\\epsilon_B$), and find\n$\\epsilon_e \\epsilon_B \\sim 10^{-3}$. These estimates do not depend on the\nlargely uncertain values of the external density and the age of the SNR. We\ndevelop a Monte Carlo scheme that reproduces the observed distribution of radio\nfluxes and sizes of the population of radio SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds. This\nsimple model provides a framework that could potentially be applied to other\ngalaxies with complete radio SNRs samples.\n", "  We report on 22 yrs of radio timing observations of the millisecond pulsar\nJ1024$-$0719 by the telescopes participating in the European Pulsar Timing\nArray (EPTA). These observations reveal a significant second derivative of the\npulsar spin frequency and confirm the discrepancy between the parallax and\nShklovskii distances that has been reported earlier. We also present optical\nastrometry, photometry and spectroscopy of 2MASS J10243869$-$0719190. We find\nthat it is a low-metallicity main-sequence star (K7V spectral type,\n$\\mathrm{[M/H]}=-1.0$, $T_\\mathrm{eff}=4050\\pm50$ K) and that its position,\nproper motion and distance are consistent with those of PSR J1024$-$0719. We\nconclude that PSR J1024$-$0719 and 2MASS J10243869$-$0719190 form a common\nproper motion pair and are gravitationally bound. The gravitational interaction\nbetween the main-sequence star and the pulsar accounts for the spin frequency\nderivatives, which in turn resolves the distance discrepancy. Our observations\nsuggest that the pulsar and main-sequence star are in an extremely wide\n($P_\\mathrm{b}>200$ yr) orbit. Combining the radial velocity of the companion\nand proper motion of the pulsar, we find that the binary system has a high\nspatial velocity of $384\\pm45$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard\nof rest and has a Galactic orbit consistent with halo objects. Since the\nobserved main-sequence companion star cannot have recycled the pulsar to\nmillisecond spin periods, an exotic formation scenario is required. We\ndemonstrate that this extremely wide-orbit binary could have evolved from a\ntriple system that underwent an asymmetric supernova explosion, though find\nthat significant fine-tuning during the explosion is required. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications of the long period orbit on the timing stability of\nPSR J1024$-$0719 in light of its inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.\n", "  Generation of photon pairs from compact, manufacturable and inexpensive\nsilicon (Si) photonic devices at room temperature may help develop practical\napplications of quantum photonics. An important characteristic of photon-pair\ngeneration is the two-photon joint spectral intensity (JSI), which describes\nthe frequency correlations of the photon pair. In particular, heralded\nsingle-photon generation requires uncorrelated photons, rather than the highly\nanti-correlated photons conventionally obtained under continuous-wave (CW)\npumping. Recent attempts to achieve such a factorizable JSI have used short\noptical pulses from mode-locked lasers, which are much more expensive and\nbigger table-top or rack-sized instruments compared to the Si microchip pair\ngenerator, dominate the cost and inhibit the miniaturization of the source.\nHere, we generate photon pairs from a Si microring resonator by using an\nelectronic step-recovery diode to drive an electro-optic modulator which carves\nthe pump light from a CW optical diode into pulses of the appropriate width,\nthus potentially eliminating the need for optical mode-locked lasers.\n", "  We study a quantum Otto cycle in which the strokes are performed in finite\ntime. The cycle involves energy measurements at the end of each stroke to allow\nfor the respective determination of work. We then optimize for the work and\nefficiency of the cycle by varying the time spent in the different strokes and\nfind that the optimal value of the ratio of time spent on each stroke goes\nthrough sudden changes as the parameters of this cycle vary continuously. The\nposition of these discontinuities depends on the optimized quantity under\nconsideration such as the net work output or the efficiency.\n", "  In the hindered magnetic dipole transitions of heavy quarkonia, the\ncoupled-channel effects originating from the coupling of quarkonia to a pair of\nheavy and anti-heavy mesons can play a dominant role. Here, we study the\nhindered magnetic dipole transitions between two $P$-wave bottomonia, $\\chi_b(n\nP)$ and $h_b(n^\\prime P)$, with $n\\neq n^\\prime$. In these processes the\ncoupled-channel effects are expected to lead to partial widths much larger than\nthe quark model predictions. We estimate these partial widths which, however,\nare very sensitive to unknown coupling constants related to the vertices\n$\\chi_{b0}(nP)B\\bar B$. A measurement of the hindered M1 transitions can shed\nlight on the coupled-channel dynamics in these transitions and hence on the\nsize of the coupling constants. We also suggest to check the coupled-channel\neffects by comparing results from quenched and fully dynamical lattice QCD\ncalculations.\n", "  Ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) probe the\noutermost layers of the explosion, and UV spectra of SNe Ia are expected to be\nextremely sensitive to differences in progenitor composition and the details of\nthe explosion. Here we present the first study of a sample of high\nsignal-to-noise ratio SN Ia spectra that extend blueward of 2900 A. We focus on\nspectra taken within 5 days of maximum brightness. Our sample of ten SNe Ia\nspans the majority of the parameter space of SN Ia optical diversity. We find\nthat SNe Ia have significantly more diversity in the UV than in the optical,\nwith the spectral variance continuing to increase with decreasing wavelengths\nuntil at least 1800 A (the limit of our data). The majority of the UV variance\ncorrelates with optical light-curve shape, while there are no obvious and\nunique correlations between spectral shape and either ejecta velocity or\nhost-galaxy morphology. Using light-curve shape as the primary variable, we\ncreate a UV spectral model for SNe Ia at peak brightness. With the model, we\ncan examine how individual SNe vary relative to expectations based on only\ntheir light-curve shape. Doing this, we confirm an excess of flux for SN 2011fe\nat short wavelengths, consistent with its progenitor having a subsolar\nmetallicity. While most other SNe Ia do not show large deviations from the\nmodel, ASASSN-14lp has a deficit of flux at short wavelengths, suggesting that\nits progenitor was relatively metal rich.\n", "  We present an analysis of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) within hydrodynamic\nsimulations of isolated, low-mass (M* ~ 10^9 M_sol) disc galaxies. We study the\nevolution of molecular abundances and the implications for CO emission and the\nX_CO conversion factor in individual clouds. We define clouds either as regions\nabove a density threshold n_H,min = 10 cm^-3, or using an observationally\nmotivated CO intensity threshold of 0.25 K km s^-1. Our simulations include a\nnon-equilibrium chemical model with 157 species, including 20 molecules. We\nalso investigate the effects of resolution and pressure floors (i.e. Jeans\nlimiters). We find cloud lifetimes up to ~40 Myr, with a median of 13 Myr, in\nagreement with observations. At one tenth solar metallicity, young clouds\n(<10-15 Myr) are underabundant in H2 and CO compared to chemical equilibrium,\nby factors of ~3 and 1-2 orders of magnitude, respectively. At solar\nmetallicity, GMCs reach chemical equilibrium faster (within ~1 Myr). We also\ncompute CO emission from individual clouds. The mean CO intensity, I_CO, is\nstrongly suppressed at low dust extinction, A_v, and possibly saturates towards\nhigh A_v, in agreement with observations. The I_CO - A_v relation shifts\ntowards higher A_v for higher metallicities and, to a lesser extent, for\nstronger UV radiation. At one tenth solar metallicity, CO emission is weaker in\nyoung clouds (<10-15 Myr), consistent with the underabundance of CO.\nConsequently, X_CO decreases by an order of magnitude from 0 to 15 Myr, albeit\nwith a large scatter.\n", "  We present the results of a deep (280 ks) Chandra observation of the\nOphiuchus cluster, the second-brightest galaxy cluster in the X-ray sky. The\ncluster hosts a truncated cool core, with a temperature increasing from kT~1\nkeV in the core to kT~9 keV at r~30 kpc. Beyond r~30 kpc the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) appears remarkably isothermal. The core is dynamically disturbed\nwith multiple sloshing induced cold fronts, with indications for both\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The sloshing is the result\nof the strongly perturbed gravitational potential in the cluster core, with the\ncentral brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) being displaced southward from the\nglobal center of mass. The residual image reveals a likely subcluster south of\nthe core at the projected distance of r~280 kpc. The cluster also harbors a\nlikely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions\nin the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,\nindicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s. The density fluctuations might be\ndamped by thermal conduction in the hot and remarkably isothermal ICM,\nresulting in our underestimate of gas velocities. We find a surprising, sharp\nsurface brightness discontinuity, that is curved away from the core, at r~120\nkpc to the southeast of the cluster center. We conclude that this feature is\nmost likely due to gas dynamics associated with a merger and not a result of an\nextraordinary active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst. The cooling core lacks\nany observable X-ray cavities and the AGN only displays weak, point-like radio\nemission, lacking lobes or jets, indicating that currently it may be largely\ndormant. The lack of strong AGN activity may be due to the bulk of the cooling\ntaking place offset from the central supermassive black hole.\n", "  Large redshift surveys capable of measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation\n(BAO) signal have proven to be an effective way of measuring the\ndistance-redshift relation in cosmology. Building off the work in Zhu et al.\n(2015), we develop a technique to directly constrain the distance-redshift\nrelation from BAO measurements without splitting the sample into redshift bins.\nWe parametrize the distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as\na quadratic expansion. We measure its coefficients and reconstruct the\ndistance-redshift relation from the expansion. We apply the redshift weighting\ntechnique in Zhu et al. (2015) to the clustering of galaxies from 1000 QuickPM\n(QPM) mock simulations after reconstruction and achieve a 0.75% measurement of\nthe angular diameter distance $D_A$ at $z=0.64$ and the same precision for\nHubble parameter H at $z=0.29$. These QPM mock catalogs are designed to mimic\nthe clustering and noise level of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). We compress the correlation functions in the\nredshift direction onto a set of weighted correlation functions. These\nestimators give unbiased $D_A$ and $H$ measurements at all redshifts within the\nrange of the combined sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of redshift\nweighting in improving the distance and Hubble parameter estimates. Instead of\nmeasuring at a single 'effective' redshift as in traditional analyses, we\nreport our $D_A$ and $H$ measurements at all redshifts. The measured fractional\nerror of $D_A$ ranges from 1.53% at $z=0.2$ to 0.75% at $z=0.64$. The\nfractional error of $H$ ranges from 0.75% at $z=0.29$ to 2.45% at $z = 0.7$.\nOur measurements are consistent with a Fisher forecast to within 10% to 20%\ndepending on the pivot redshift. We further show the results are robust against\nthe choice of fiducial cosmologies, galaxy bias models, and RSD streaming\nparameters.\n", "  We investigate enhanced field emission due to a continuous or pulsed\noscillating field added to a constant electric field $E$ at the emitter\nsurface. When the frequency of oscillation, field strength, and property of the\nemitter material satisfy the Keldysh condition $\\gamma<1/2$ one can use the\nadiabatic approximation for treating the oscillating field, i.e. consider the\ntunneling through the instantaneous Fowler-Nordheim barrier created by both\nfields. Due to the great sensitivity of the emission to the field strength the\naverage tunneling current can be much larger than the current produced by only\nthe constant field.\n  We carry out the computations for arbitrary strong constant electric fields,\nbeyond the commonly used Fowler-Nordheim approximation which exhibit in\nparticular an important property of the wave function inside the potential\nbarrier where it is found to be monotonically decreasing without oscillations.\n", "  The CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating Carroll-Field-Jackiw modification of\nelectrodynamics is discussed and we study its effects on the energy spectrum of\nhydrogen, as well as in the generation of a momentum-dependent electric dipole\nmoment for charged leptons. We also briefly comment on the possibility of the\ndetection of Lorentz violation in measurements of vacuum birefringence in\nresonant cavities. The bounds found are based on local laboratory experimental\nlimits and are not competitive with the ones coming from astrophysical\nconsiderations.\n", "  We present first results from a new technique for the prediction of Fe\nK$\\alpha$ profiles directly from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\n(GRMHD) simulations. Data from a GRMHD simulation are processed by a Monte\nCarlo global radiation transport code, which determines the X-ray flux\nirradiating the disk surface and the coronal electron temperature\nself-consistently. With that irradiating flux and the disk's density structure\ndrawn from the simulation, we determine the reprocessed Fe K$\\alpha$ emission\nfrom photoionization equilibrium and solution of the radiation transfer\nequation. We produce maps of the surface brightness of Fe K$\\alpha$ emission\nover the disk surface, which---for our example of a $10 M_\\odot$, Schwarzschild\nblack hole accreting at $1\\%$ the Eddington value---rises steeply one\ngravitational radius outside the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit\nand then falls $\\propto r^{-2}$ at larger radii. We explain these features of\nthe Fe K$\\alpha$ radial surface brightness profile as consequences of the\ndisk's ionization structure and an extended coronal geometry, respectively. We\nalso present the corresponding Fe K$\\alpha$ line profiles as would be seen by\ndistant observers at several inclinations. Both the shapes of the line profiles\nand the equivalent widths of our predicted K$\\alpha$ lines are qualitatively\nsimilar to those typically observed from accreting black holes. Most\nimportantly, this work represents a direct link between theory and observation:\nin a fully self-consistent way, we produce observable results---iron\nfluorescence line profiles---from the theory of black hole accretion with\nalmost no phenomenological assumptions.\n", "  The paper studies the interaction of Lamb waves with the free edge of a\nplate. The reflection coefficients of a Lamb mode at a plate free edge are\ncalculated using a semi-analytical method, as a function of frequency and angle\nof incidence. The conversion between forward and backward Lamb modes is\nthoroughly investigated. It is shown that, at the zero-group velocity (ZGV)\nfrequency, the forward $S_1$ Lamb mode fully converts into the backward\n$S_{2b}$ Lamb mode at normal incidence. Besides, this conversion is very\nefficient over most of the angular spectrum and remains dominant at frequencies\njust above the ZGV-point. This effect is observed experimentally on a Duralumin\nplate. Firstly, the $S_1$ Lamb mode is selectively generated using a transducer\narray, secondly the $S_{2b}$ mode is excited using a single circular\ntransducer. The normal displacement field is probed with an interferometer. The\nfree edge is shown to retro-focus the incident wave at different depths\ndepending on the wave number mismatch between the forward and backward\npropagating modes. In the vicinity of the ZGV-point, wave numbers coincide and\nthe wave is retro-reflected on the source. In this frequency range, the free\nedge acts as a perfect phase conjugating mirror.\n", "  We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to\nreduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant (H_0) from\n3.3% to 2.4%. Improvements come from new, near-infrared observations of Cepheid\nvariables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe~Ia, more than doubling the sample of\nSNe~Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage\nthe magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe~Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts and the\nmegamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying\ncross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33% reduction\nin the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids\nand a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of\nCepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW)\nCepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i)\nmegamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with\nparallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51,\n72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best\nestimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC,\nand includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4%. This value is\n3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3\nneutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma\nrelative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of\nWMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may\nplay a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H_0 at\nface value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of\ndark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N_eff=0.4-1. We\nanticipate significant improvements in H_0 from upcoming parallax measurements.\n", "  We discuss a scenario in which the diphoton enhancement at $M_{\\gamma\n\\gamma}$ = 750 GeV, observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, is a neutral\ntechnipion $\\tilde{\\pi}^0$. We consider two distinct minimal models for the\ndynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. In a first one, two-flavor vector-like\ntechnicolor (VTC) model, we assume that the two-photon fusion is a dominant\nproduction mechanism. We include $\\gamma \\gamma \\to {\\tilde \\pi}^0$ and\nproduction of technipion associated with one or two jets. All the considered\nmechanisms give similar contributions. With the strong Yukawa\n(technipion-techniquark) coupling $g_{TC}$ = 10 - 20 we obtain the measured\ncross section of the \"signal\". With such values of $g_{TC}$ we get a relatively\nsmall $\\Gamma_{\\rm tot}$. In a second approach, one-family walking technicolor\n(WTC) model, the isoscalar technipion is produced dominantly via the\ngluon-gluon fusion. We also discuss the size of the signal at lower energies\n(LHC, Tevatron) for $\\gamma \\gamma$ (VTC) and jet-jet (WTC) final states and\ncheck consistency with the existing experimental data. We predict a measurable\ncross section for ${\\tilde \\pi}^0$ production associated with one or two soft\njets. The technipion signal in both models is compared with the SM background\ndiphoton contributions. We observe the dominance of inelastic-inelastic\nprocesses for $\\gamma \\gamma$ induced processes. In the VTC scenario, we\npredict the signal cross section for purely exclusive $p p \\to p p \\gamma\n\\gamma$ processes at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to be about 0.2 fb. Such a cross\nsection would be, however, difficult to measure with the planned integrated\nluminosity. In all considered cases the signal is below the background or/and\nbelow the threshold set by statistics.\n", "  Given the unique optical properties of LiF, it is often used as an\nobservation window in high-temperature and pressure experiments; and, hence,\nestimates of its transmission properties are necessary to interpret\nobservations. Since direct measurements of the thermal conductivity of LiF at\nthe appropriate conditions are difficult, we resort to molecular simulation\nmethods. Using the Belonoshko et al. (2000) empirical potential validated\nagainst ab initio phonon density of states, we estimate the thermal\nconductivity of LiF at high temperatures (1000-4000K) and pressures (100-400\nGPa) with the Green-Kubo method. We also compare these estimates to those\nderived directly from ab initio data. To ascertain the correct phase of LiF at\nthese extreme conditions we calculate the (relative) phase stability of the B1\nand B2 structures using a quasiharmonic ab initio model of the free energy. We\nalso estimate the thermal conductivity of LiF in an uniaxial loading state that\nemulates initial stages of compression in high-stress ramp loading experiments\nand show the degree of anisotropy induced in the conductivity due to\ndeformation.\n", "  A single-step Eriksen transformation of~$1S_{1/2}$,~$2P_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{3/2}$\nstates of the relativistic hydrogen-like atom is performed exactly by\nexpressing each transformed function (TF) as a linear combination of\neigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian. The transformed functions, which are\nfour-component spinors with vanishing two lower components, are calculated\nnumerically and have the same symmetries as the initial states. For all nuclear\ncharges~$Z \\in [1\\ldots 92]$ a contribution of the initial state to TFs exceeds\n86\\% of the total probability density. Next large contribution to TFs comes\nfrom continuum states with negative energies close to~$-m_0c^2-E_b$,\nwhere~$E_b$ is the binding energy of initial state. Contribution of other\nstates to TFs is less than~$0.1\\%$ of the total probability density. Other\ncomponents of TFs are nearly zero which confirms both validity of the Eriksen\ntransformation and accuracy of the numerical calculations. The TFs\nof~$1S_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{1/2}$ states are close to~$1s$ and~$2p$ states of the\nnonrelativistic hydrogen-like atom, respectively, but the TF of~$2P_{3/2}$\nstate differs qualitatively from the~$2p$ state. Functions calculated with use\nof a linearized Eriksen transformation, being equivalent to the second order\nFoldy-Wouthuysen transformation, are compared with corresponding functions\nobtained by Eriksen transformation. A very good agreement between both results\nis obtained.\n", "  We have fabricated and measured ballistic graphene transistors with two\noblique gates that can be independently biased. The gate lengths are about 38\nnm and are separated by a distance of 30 nm, the tilting angle being of 45o\nwith respect to source and drain electrodes distanced at 190 nm. Electric\nmeasurements reveal specific properties of ballistic carrier transport, i.e.\nnonlinear drain voltage-drain current dependence, showing a saturation region,\nand negative differential resistance at certain bias voltages, which cannot be\nexplained without physical mechanisms related to ballistic transport. Tens of\nballistic transistors, with very large transconductances, were fabricated on a\nchip cut from a 4 inch graphene wafer. Such double-gate transistor\nconfigurations can be used also as extremely efficient, state-of-the-art\nphotodetectors.\n", "  Dynamics of a charged particle in the canonical coordinates is a Hamiltonian\nsystem, and the well-known symplectic algorithm has been regarded as the de\nfacto method for numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems due to its\nlong-term accuracy and fidelity. For long-term simulations with high\nefficiency, explicit symplectic algorithms are desirable. However, it is widely\naccepted that explicit symplectic algorithms are only available for\nsum-separable Hamiltonians, and that this restriction severely limits the\napplication of explicit symplectic algorithms to charged particle dynamics. To\novercome this difficulty, we combine the familiar sum-split method and a\ngenerating function method to construct second and third order explicit\nsymplectic algorithms for dynamics of charged particle. The generating function\nmethod is designed to generate explicit symplectic algorithms for\nproduct-separable Hamiltonian with form of\n$H(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=\\mathbf{p}_{i}f(\\mathbf{q})$ or\n$H(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=\\mathbf{q}_{i}f(\\mathbf{p})$. Applied to the\nsimulations of charged particle dynamics, the explicit symplectic algorithms\nbased on generating functions demonstrate superiorities in conservation and\nefficiency.\n", "  We introduce new three-dimensional topological phases of two-band models\nusing the Pontryagin-Thom construction. In symmetry class A these are the\ninfinitely many Hopf-Chern topological insulators, which are hybrids of layered\nChern insulators and the Hopf insulator. In symmetry class C, there is a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-classification with the non-trivial topological phase, the Hopf\nsuperconductor, being realized by a construction that doubles the usual Hopf\ninsulator in momentum space. For these new topological phases we investigate\nthe energy spectrum in the presence of a boundary and find gapless surface\nmodes, confirming the validity of the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n", "  We analyze the time-resolved energy transport and the entropy production in\nac-driven quantum coherent electron systems coupled to multiple reservoirs at\nfinite temperature. At slow driving we formulate the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics valid at each instant of time. We identify heat fluxes flowing\nthough the different pieces of the device and emphasize the importance of the\nenergy stored in the contact and central regions for the second law of\nthermodynamics to be instantaneously satisfied. In addition, we discuss\nconservative and dissipative contributions to the heat flux and to the entropy\nproduction as a function of time. We illustrate these ideas with a simple model\ncorresponding to a driven level coupled to two reservoirs with different\nchemical potentials.\n", "  We investigate the spin-current transport through antiferromagnetic insulator\n(AFMI) by means of the spin-Hall magnetoressitance (SMR) over a wide\ntemperature range in Pt/NiO/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (Pt/NiO/YIG) heterostructures.\nBy inserting the AFMI NiO layer, the SMR dramatically decreases by decreasing\nthe temperature down to the antiferromagnetically ordered state of NiO, which\nimplies that the AFM order prevents rather than promotes the spin-current\ntransport. On the other hand, the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) on induced Pt\nmoments by YIG, which entangles with the spin-Hall effect (SHE) in Pt, can be\nefficiently screened, and pure SMR can be derived by insertion of NiO. The dual\nroles of the NiO insertion including efficiently blocking the MPE and\ntransporting the spin current from Pt to YIG are outstanding compared with\nother antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal or nonmagnetic metal (NM).\n", "  We study the transport of high-energy particles in pulsar wind nebulae (PWN)\nusing three-dimensional MHD (see Porth et al. (2014) for details) and\ntest-particle simulations, as well as a Fokker-Planck particle transport model.\nThe latter includes radiative and adiabatic losses, diffusion, and advection on\nthe background flow of the simulated MHD nebula. By combining the models, the\nspatial evolution of flux and photon index of the X-ray synchrotron emission is\nmodelled for the three nebulae G21.5-0.9, the inner regions of Vela, and 3C 58,\nthereby allowing us to derive governing parameters: the magnetic field\nstrength, average flow velocity and spatial diffusion coefficient. For\ncomparison, the nebulae are also modelled with the semi-analytic Kennel &\nCoroniti (1984) model but the Porth et al. (2014) model generally yields better\nfits to the observational data. We find that high velocity fluctuations in the\nturbulent nebula (downstream of the termination shock) give rise to efficient\ndiffusive transport of particles, with average P\\'eclet number close to unity,\nindicating that both advection and diffusion play an important role in particle\ntransport. We find that the diffusive transport coefficient of the order of\n$\\sim2\\times 10^{27} (L_{\\rm s}/0.42\\rm Ly) cm^{2}s^{-1}$ ($L_{\\rm s}$ is the\nsize of the termination shock) is independent of energy up to extreme particle\nLorentz factors of $\\gamma_{p}\\sim10^{10}$.\n", "  Semiconducting half- and, to a lesser extent, full-Heusler compounds are\npromising thermoelectric materials due to their compelling electronic\nproperties with large power factors. However, intrinsically high thermal\nconductivity resulting in a limited thermoelectric efficiency has so far\nimpeded their widespread use in practical applications. Here, we report the\ncomputational discovery of a class of hitherto unknown stable semiconducting\nfull-Heusler compounds with ten valence electrons ($X_2YZ$, $X$=Ca, Sr, and Ba;\n$Y$= Au and Hg; $Z$=Sn, Pb, As, Sb, and Bi) through high-throughput $ab-initio$\nscreening. These new compounds exhibit ultralow lattice thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa_{\\text{L}}$ close to the theoretical minimum due to strong anharmonic\nrattling of the heavy noble metals, while preserving high power factors, thus\nresulting in excellent phonon-glass electron-crystal materials.\n", "  There is a host of alternative theories of gravitation in the literature,\namong them the $f(R,T)$ recently elaborated by Harko and collaborators. In\nthese theories the $R$ and $T$ are respectively the Ricci scalar and the trace\nof the energy momentum tensor. There is already in literature a series of\nstudies of different forms of the $f(R,T)$ functions as well as their\ncosmological consequences. However, there is not so far in the literature\nstudies related to the gravitational waves in $f(R,T)$ gravity. Here we\nconsider such an issue, in particular studying the putative extra polarization\nmodels that can well appear in such theories. To do that, we consider different\nfunctional forms for $f(R,T)$.\n", "  We investigate whether current data on the distribution of observed flux\ndensities of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are consistent with a constant source\ndensity in Euclidean space. We use the number of FRBs detected in two surveys\nwith different characteristics along with the observed signal-to-noise ratios\nof the detected FRBs in a formalism similar to a V/V_max-test to constrain the\ndistribution of flux densities. We find consistency between the data and a\nEuclidean distribution. Any extension of this model is therefore not\ndata-driven and needs to be motivated separately. As a byproduct we also obtain\nnew improved limits for the FRB rate at 1.4 GHz, which had not been constrained\nin this way before.\n", "  Recently, studies of brown dwarfs have demonstrated that they possess strong\nmagnetic fields and have the potential to produce radio and optical auroral\nemissions powered by magnetospheric currents. This emission provides the only\nwindow on magnetic fields in the coolest brown dwarfs and identifying\nadditional benchmark objects is key to constraining dynamo theory in this\nregime. To this end, we conducted a new red optical (6300 - 9700 Angstrom)\nsurvey with the Keck telescopes looking for H-alpha emission from a sample of\nlate L dwarfs and T dwarfs. Our survey gathered optical spectra for 29 targets,\n18 of which did not have previous optical spectra in the literature, greatly\nexpanding the number of moderate resolution (R~2000) spectra available at these\nspectral types. Combining our sample with previous surveys, we confirm an\nH-alpha detection rate of 9.2 (+3.5/-2.1) % for L and T dwarfs in the optical\nspectral range of L4 - T8. This detection rate is consistent with the recently\nmeasured detection rate for auroral radio emission from Kao et al. (2016),\nsuggesting that geometrical selection effects due to the beaming of the radio\nemission are small or absent. We also provide the first detection of H-alpha\nemission from 2MASS 0036+1821, previously notable as the only electron\ncyclotron maser radio source without a confirmed detection of H-alpha emission.\nFinally, we also establish optical standards for spectral types T3 and T4,\nfilling in the previous gap between T2 and T5.\n", "  We present a catalog of low-mass dense cores observed with the SHARC-II\ninstrument at 350 microns. Our observations have an effective angular\nresolution of 10\", approximately 2.5 times higher than observations at the same\nwavelength obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory, albeit with lower\nsensitivity, especially to extended emission. The catalog includes 81 maps\ncovering a total of 164 detected sources. For each detected source, we tabulate\nbasic source properties including position, peak intensity, flux density in\nfixed apertures, and radius. We examine the uncertainties in the pointing model\napplied to all SHARC-II data and conservatively find that the model corrections\nare good to within ~3\", approximately 1/3 of the SHARC-II beam. We examine the\ndifferences between two array scan modes and find that the instrument\ncalibration, beam size, and beam shape are similar between the two modes. We\nalso show that the same flux densities are measured when sources are observed\nin the two different modes, indicating that there are no systematic effects\nintroduced into our catalog by utilizing two different scan patterns during the\ncourse of taking observations. We find a detection rate of 95% for protostellar\ncores but only 45% for starless cores, and demonstrate the existence of a\nSHARC-II detection bias against all but the most massive and compact starless\ncores. Finally, we discuss the improvements in protostellar classification\nenabled by these 350 micron observations.\n", "  Motivated by the ATLAS and CMS announcements of the excesses of di-photon\nevents, we discuss the production and decay processes of di-photon resonance at\nfuture $e^+e^-$ colliders. We assume that the excess of the di-photon events at\nthe LHC is explained by a scalar resonance decaying into a pair of photons. In\nsuch a case, the scalar interacts with standard model gauge bosons and,\nconsequently, the production of such a scalar is possible at the $e^+e^-$\ncolliders. We study the production of the scalar resonance via the associated\nproduction with photon or $Z$, as well as via the vector-boson fusion, and\ncalculate the cross sections of these processes. We also study the backgrounds,\nand discuss the detectability of the signals of scalar production with various\ndecay processes of the scalar resonance. We also consider the case where the\nscalar resonance has an invisible decay mode, and study how the invisible decay\ncan be observed at the $e^+e^-$ colliders.\n", "  In this paper we present the full NLO QCD + NLO EW corrections to the\n$Z$-boson pair production in association with a hard jet at the LHC. The\nsubsequent $Z$-boson leptonic decays are included by adopting both the naive\nNWA and MadSpin methods for comparison. Since the $ZZ+{\\rm jet}$ production is\nan important background for single Higgs boson production and new physics\nsearch at hadron colliders, the theoretical predictions with high accuracy for\nthe hadronic production of $ZZ+{\\rm jet}$ are necessary. We present the\nnumerical results of the integrated cross section and various kinematic\ndistributions of final particles, and conclude that it is necessary to take\ninto account the spin correlation and finite width effects from the $Z$-boson\nleptonic decays. We also find that the NLO EW correction is quantitatively\nnonnegligible in matching the experimental accuracy at the LHC, particularly is\nsignificant in high transverse momentum region.\n", "  Excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) are generalizations of\nquantum phase transitions (QPTs) to excited levels. They are associated with\nlocal divergences in the density of states. Here, we investigate how the\npresence of an ESQPT can be detected from the analysis of the structure of the\nHamiltonian matrix, the level of localization of the eigenstates, the onset of\nbifurcation, and the speed of the system evolution. Our findings are\nillustrated for a Hamiltonian with infinite-range Ising interaction in a\ntransverse field. This is a version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and\nthe limiting case of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 system with tunable\ninteractions realized with ion traps. From our studies for the dynamics, we\nuncover similarities between the LMG and the noninteracting XX models.\n", "  We investigate the role of Kekule and non-Kekule structures in the radical\ncharacter of alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using\nthermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT), an efficient\nelectronic structure method for the study of large ground-state systems with\nstrong static correlation effects. Our results reveal that the studies of\nKekule and non-Kekule structures qualitatively describe the radical character\nof alternant PAHs, which could be useful when electronic structure calculations\nare infeasible due to the expensive computational cost. In addition, our\nresults support previous findings on the increase in radical character with\nincreasing system size. For alternant PAHs with the same number of aromatic\nrings, the geometrical arrangements of aromatic rings are responsible for their\nradical character.\n", "  In general relativity, it has been shown that radiation-supported atmospheres\nexist outside the surface of a radiating spherical body close to a radius where\nthe gravitational and radiative forces balance each other. We calculate the\nfrequency of oscillation of the incompressible radial mode of such a thin\natmospheric shell and show that in the optically thin case, this particular\nmode is overdamped by radiation drag.\n", "  In the presence of a (time-dependent) macroscopic electric field the electron\ndynamics of dielectrics cannot be described by the time-dependent density only.\nWe present a real-time formalism that has the density and the macroscopic\npolarization P as key quantities. We show that a simple local function of P\nalready captures long-range correlation in linear and nonlinear optical\nresponse functions. Specifically, after detailing the numerical implementation,\nwe examine the optical absorption, the second- and third-harmonic generation of\nbulk Si, GaAs, AlAs and CdTe at different level of approximation. We highlight\nlinks with ultranonlocal exchange-correlation functional approximations\nproposed within linear response time-dependent density functional theory\nframework.\n", "  Wavefunction extrapolation greatly reduces the number of self-consistent\nfield (SCF) iterations and thus the overall computational cost of\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) that is based on the Kohn-Sham\ndensity functional theory. Going against the intuition that the higher order of\nextrapolation possesses a better accuracy, we demonstrate, from both\ntheoretical and numerical perspectives, that the extrapolation accuracy firstly\nincreases and then decreases with respect to the order, and an optimal\nextrapolation order in terms of minimal number of SCF iterations always exists.\nWe also prove that the optimal order tends to be larger when using larger MD\ntime steps or more strict SCF convergence criteria. By example BOMD simulations\nof a solid copper system, we show that the optimal extrapolation order covers a\nbroad range when varying the MD time step or the SCF convergence criterion.\nTherefore, we suggest the necessity for BOMD simulation packages to open the\nuser interface and to provide more choices on the extrapolation order. Another\nfactor that may influence the extrapolation accuracy is the alignment scheme\nthat eliminates the discontinuity in the wavefunctions with respect to the\natomic or cell variables. We prove the equivalence between the two existing\nschemes, thus the implementation of either of them does not lead to essential\ndifference in the extrapolation accuracy.\n", "  Past holographic screens are codimension-one surfaces of indefinite signature\nthat are foliated by marginally anti-trapped surfaces called leaves. Future\nholographic screens are defined similarly except with marginally trapped\nleaves. Bousso and Engelhardt recently showed that the leaves of past and\nfuture holographic screens have monotonic area. We prove a stronger area law\nthat shows that subregions of leaves also have monotonic area. For every past\nand future holographic screen, there exists a family of leaf-orthogonal curves\ncalled the fibration of the screen. Any region in a leaf can be translated\nalong the fibration to a leaf of larger area. Our result states that the area\nof the subregion grows as it is translated.\n", "  We present the results of ALMA observations of dust continuum emission and\nmolecular rotational lines toward a dense core MC27 (aka L1521F) in Taurus,\nwhich is considered to be at a very early stage of star formation. The detailed\ncolumn density distribution on size scales from a few tens AU to ~10,000 AU\nscale are revealed by combining the ALMA (12 m array + 7 m array) data with the\npublished/unpublished single-dish data. The high angular resolution\nobservations at 0.87 mm with a synthesized beam size of ~0.\"74 x 0.\"32 reveal\nthat a protostellar source, MMS-1, is not spatially resolved and lacks\nassociated gas emission, while a starless high-density core, MMS-2, has\nsubstructures both in dust and molecular emission. The averaged radial column\ndensity distribution of the inner part of MC27/L1521F (r $\\lesssim$ 3000 AU) is\nN(H2) ~r$^{-0.4}$, clearly flatter than that of the outer part, ~r$^{-1.0}$.\nThe complex velocity/spatial structure obtained with previous ALMA observations\nis located inside the inner flatter region, which may reflect the dynamical\nstatus of the dense core.\n", "  Our recent N-body simulations of planetary system formation, incorporating\nmodels for the main physical processes thought to be important during the\nbuilding of planets (i.e. gas disc evolution, migration, planetesimal/boulder\naccretion, gas accretion onto cores, etc.), have been successful in reproducing\nsome of the broad features of the observed exoplanet population (e.g. compact\nsystems of low mass planets, hot Jupiters), but fail completely to form any\nsurviving cold Jupiters. The primary reason for this failure is rapid inward\nmigration of growing protoplanets during the gas accretion phase, resulting in\nthe delivery of these bodies onto orbits close to the star. Here, we present\nthe results of simulations that examine the formation of gas giant planets in\nprotoplanetary discs that are radially structured due to spatial and temporal\nvariations in the effective viscous stresses, and show that such a model\nresults in the formation of a population of cold gas giants. Furthermore, when\ncombined with models for disc photoevaporation and a central magnetospheric\ncavity, the simulations reproduce the well-known hot-Jupiter/cold-Jupiter\ndichotomy in the observed period distribution of giant exoplanets, with a\nperiod valley between 10-100 days.\n", "  We examine the effect of an accretion disc on the orbits of stars in the\ncentral star cluster surrounding a central massive black hole by performing a\nsuite of 39 high-accuracy direct N-body simulations using state-of-the art\nsoftware and accelerator hardware, with particle numbers up to 128k. The\nprimary focus is on the accretion rate of stars by the black hole (equivalent\nto their tidal disruption rate for black holes in the small to medium mass\nrange) and the eccentricity distribution of these stars. Our simulations vary\nnot only the particle number, but disc model (two models examined), spatial\nresolution at the centre (characterised by the numerical accretion radius) and\nsoftening length. The large parameter range and physically realistic modelling\nallow us for the first time to confidently extrapolate these results to real\ngalactic centres. While in a real galactic centre both particle number and\naccretion radius differ by a few orders of magnitude from our models, which are\nconstrained by numerical capability, we find that the stellar accretion rate\nconverges for models with N > 32k. The eccentricity distribution of accreted\nstars, however, does not converge. We find that there are two competing effects\nat work when improving the resolution: larger particle number leads to a\nsmaller fraction of stars accreted on nearly-circular orbits, while higher\nspatial resolution increases this fraction. We scale our simulations to some\nnearby galaxies and find that the expected boost in stellar accretion (or tidal\ndisruption, which could be observed as X-ray flares) in the presence of a gas\ndisc is about a factor of 10. Even with this boost, the accretion of mass from\nstars is still a factor of ~ 100 slower than the accretion of gas from the\ndisc. Thus, it seems accretion of stars is not a major contributor to black\nhole mass growth.\n", "  At redshifts beyond $z{\\sim}1$ measuring the black hole galaxy relations\nproves to be a difficult task. The bright light of the AGN aggravates\ndeconvolution of black hole and galaxy properties. On the other hand high\nredshift data on these relations is vital to understand in what ways galaxies\nand black holes co-evolve and in what ways they don't. In this work we use\nblack hole (BHMDs) and stellar mass densities (SMDs) to constrain the possible\nco-evolution of black holes with their host galaxies since $z{\\sim}5$. The\nBHMDs are calculated from quasar luminosity functions (QLF) using the Soltan\nargument, while we use integrals over stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the star\nformation rate density to obtain values for the stellar mass density. We find\nthat both quantities grow in lock-step below redshifts of $z{\\sim}3$ with a\nnon-evolving BHMD to SMD ratio. A fit to the data assuming a power law relation\nbetween the BHMD and the SMD yields exponents around unity ($1.0{-}1.5$). Up to\n$z{\\sim}5$ the BHMD to SMD ratio doesn't show a strong evolution given the\nlarger uncertainty in the completeness of high-redshift datasets. Our results,\nalways applying the same analysis technique, seem to be consistent across all\nadopted data sets.\n", "  We aim at drawing the hadron-quark phase transition line in the QCD phase\ndiagram by using the two phase model (TPM) in which the entanglement\nPolyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (EPNJL) model with vector-type\nfour-quark interaction is used for the quark phase and the relativistic mean\nfield (RMF) model is for the hadron phase. Reasonable TPM is constructed by\nusing lattice QCD data and neutron star observations as reliable constraints.\nFor the EPNJL model, we determine the strength of vector-type four-quark\ninteraction at zero quark chemical potential from lattice QCD data on quark\nnumber density normalized by its Stefan-Boltzmann limit. For the hadron phase,\nwe consider three RMF models, NL3, TM1 and model proposed by Maruyama, Tatsumi,\nEndo and Chiba (MTEC). We find that MTEC is most consistent with the neutron\nstar observations and TM1 is the second best. Assuming that the hadron-quark\nphase transition occurs in the core of neutron star, we explore the\ndensity-dependence of vector-type four-quark interaction. Particularly for the\ncritical baryon chemical potential at zero temperature, we determine a range\nfor the quark phase to occur in the core of neutron star.\n", "  The CUORE experiment will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of\n$^{130}$Te with an array of 988 TeO$_2$ bolometers arranged in 19 towers.\nCUORE-0, the first tower assembled according to the CUORE procedures, was built\nand commissioned at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, and took data from\nMarch 2013 to March 2015. In this paper we describe the design, construction\nand operation of the CUORE-0 experiment, with an emphasis on the improvements\nmade over a predecessor experiment, Cuoricino. In particular, we demonstrate\nwith CUORE-0 data that the design goals of CUORE are within reach.\n", "  Observational implications are derived for two standard models of\nsupernovae-driven galactic winds: a freely expanding steady-state wind and a\nwind sourced by a self-similarly expanding superbubble including thermal heat\nconduction. It is shown that, for the steady-state wind, matching the measured\ncorrelation between the soft x-ray luminosity and star formation rate of\nstarburst galaxies is equivalent to producing a scaled wind mass-loading factor\nrelative to the star-formation rate of 0.5 - 3, in agreement with the amount\ninferred from metal absorption line measurements. The match requires the\nasymptotic wind velocity v_inf to scale with the star formation rate SFR (in\nsolar masses per year) approximately as v_inf ~ (700 - 1000) km/s SFR^{1/6}.\nThe corresponding mass injection rate is close to the amount naturally provided\nby thermal evaporation from the wall of a superbubble in a galactic disc,\nsuggesting thermal evaporation may be a major source of mass-loading. The\npredicted mass-loading factors from thermal evaporation within the galactic\ndisc alone, however, are somewhat smaller, 0.2 - 2, so that a further\ncontribution from cloud ablation or evaporation may be required. Both models\nmay account for the 1.4GHz luminosity of unresolved radio sources within\nstarburst galaxies for plausible parameters describing the distribution of\nrelativistic electrons. Further observational tests to distinguish the models\nare suggested.\n", "  Fe-Si binary compounds have been fabricated by focused electron beam induced\ndeposition by the alternating use of iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, and\nneopentasilane, Si5H12 as precursor gases. The fabrication procedure consisted\nin preparing multilayer structures which were treated by low-energy electron\nirradiation and annealing to induce atomic species intermixing. In this way we\nare able to fabricate FeSi and Fe3Si binary compounds from [Fe=Si]2 and\n[Fe3=Si]2 multilayers, as shown by transmission electron microscopy\ninvestigations. This fabrication procedure is useful to obtain nanostructured\nbinary alloys from precursors which compete for adsorption sites during growth\nand, therefore, cannot be used simultaneously.\n", "  The ground state of an elastic interface in a disordered medium undergoes\ncollective jumps upon variation of external parameters. These mesoscopic jumps\nare called shocks, or static avalanches. Submitting the interface to a\nparabolic potential centered at $w$, we study the avalanches which occur as $w$\nis varied. We are interested in the correlations between the avalanche sizes\n$S_1$ and $S_2$ occurring at positions $w_1$ and $w_2$. Using the Functional\nRenormalization Group (FRG), we show that correlations exist for realistic\ninterface models below their upper critical dimension. Notably, the connected\nmoment $ \\langle S_1 S_2 \\rangle^c$ is up to a prefactor exactly the\nrenormalized disorder correlator, itself a function of $|w_2-w_1|$. The latter\nis the universal function at the center of the FRG; hence correlations between\nshocks are universal as well. All moments and the full joint probability\ndistribution are computed to first non-trivial order in an $\\epsilon$-expansion\nbelow the upper critical dimension. To quantify the local nature of the\ncoupling between avalanches, we calculate the correlations of their local\njumps. We finally test our predictions against simulations of a particle in\nrandom-bond and random-force disorder, with surprisingly good agreement.\n", "  We develop a Bayesian model for globular clusters composed of multiple\nstellar populations, extending earlier statistical models for open clusters\ncomposed of simple (single) stellar populations (vanDyk et al. 2009, Stein et\nal. 2013). Specifically, we model globular clusters with two populations that\ndiffer in helium abundance. Our model assumes a hierarchical structuring of the\nparameters in which physical properties---age, metallicity, helium abundance,\ndistance, absorption, and initial mass---are common to (i) the cluster as a\nwhole or to (ii) individual populations within a cluster, or are unique to\n(iii) individual stars. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm\nis devised for model fitting that greatly improves convergence relative to its\nprecursor non-adaptive MCMC algorithm. Our model and computational tools are\nincorporated into an open-source software suite known as BASE-9. We use\nnumerical studies to demonstrate that our method can recover parameters of\ntwo-population clusters, and also show model misspecification can potentially\nbe identified. As a proof of concept, we analyze the two stellar populations of\nglobular cluster NGC 5272 using our model and methods. (BASE-9 is available\nfrom GitHub: https://github.com/argiopetech/base/releases).\n", "  We use Cycle 21 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations and HST archival\nACS Treasury observations of Galactic Globular Clusters to find and\ncharacterize two stellar populations in NGC 5024 (M53), NGC 5272 (M3), and NGC\n6352. For these three clusters, both single and double-population analyses are\nused to determine a best fit isochrone(s). We employ a sophisticated Bayesian\nanalysis technique to simultaneously fit the cluster parameters (age, distance,\nabsorption, and metallicity) that characterize each cluster. For the\ntwo-population analysis, unique population level helium values are also fit to\neach distinct population of the cluster and the relative proportions of the\npopulations are determined. We find differences in helium ranging from\n$\\sim$0.05 to 0.11 for these three clusters. Model grids with solar\n$\\alpha$-element abundances ([$\\alpha$/Fe] =0.0) and enhanced $\\alpha$-elements\n([$\\alpha$/Fe]=0.4) are adopted.\n", "  Multiplicity is common in field stars and among protostellar systems. Models\nsuggest two paths of formation: turbulent fragmentation and protostellar disk\nfragmentation. We attempt to find whether or not the coevality frequency of\nmultiple protostellar systems can help to better understand their formation\nmechanism. The coevality frequency is determined by constraining the relative\nevolutionary stages of the components in a multiple system. SEDs for known\nmultiple protostars in Perseus were constructed from literature data. Herschel\nPACS photometric maps were used to sample the peak of the SED for systems with\nseparations >7\", a crucial aspect in determining the evolutionary stage of a\nprotostellar system. Inclination effects and the surrounding envelope and\noutflows were considered to decouple source geometry from evolution. This\ntogether with the shape and derived properties from the SED was used to\ndetermine each system's coevality as accurately as possible. SED models were\nused to examine the frequency of non-coevality that is due to geometry. We find\na non-coevality frequency of 33+/-10% from the comparison of SED shapes of\nresolved multiple systems. Other source parameters suggest a somewhat lower\nfrequency of non-coevality. The frequency of apparent non-coevality that is due\nto random inclination angle pairings of model SEDs is 17+/-0.5%. Observations\nof the outflow of resolved multiple systems do not suggest significant\nmisalignments within multiple systems. Effects of unresolved multiples on the\nSED shape are also investigated. We find that 1/3 of the multiple protostellar\nsystems sampled here are non-coeval, which is more than expected from random\ngeometric orientations. The other 2/3 are found to be coeval. Higher order\nmultiples show a tendency to be non-coeval. The frequency of non-coevality\nfound here is most likely due to formation and enhanced by dynamical evolution.\n", "  The evolutionary classification of massive clumps that are candidate\nprogenitors of high-mass young stars and clusters relies on a variety of\nindependent diagnostics based on observables from the near-infrared to the\nradio. A promising evolutionary indicator for massive and dense\ncluster-progenitor clumps is the L/M ratio between the bolometric luminosity\nand the mass of the clumps. With the aim of providing a quantitative\ncalibration for this indicator we used SEPIA/APEX to obtain CH3C2H(12-11)\nobservations, that is an excellent thermometer molecule probing densities >\n10^5 cm^-3 , toward 51 dense clumps with M>1000 solar masses, and uniformly\nspanning -2 < Log(L/M) < 2.3.\n  We identify three distinct ranges of L/M that can be associated to three\ndistinct phases of star formation in massive clumps. For L/M <1 no clump is\ndetected in CH3C2H , suggesting an inner envelope temperature below 30K. For 1<\nL/M < 10 we detect 58% of the clumps, with a temperature between 30 and 35 K\nindependently from the exact value of L/M; such clumps are building up\nluminosity due to the formation of stars, but no star is yet able to\nsignificantly heat the inner clump regions. For L/M> 10 we detect all the\nclumps, with a gas temperature rising with Log(L/M), marking the appearance of\na qualitatively different heating source within the clumps; such values are\nfound towards clumps with UCHII counterparts, suggesting that the quantitative\ndifference in T - L/M behaviour above L/M >10 is due to the first appearance of\nZAMS stars in the clumps.\n", "  We establish the Statistical Mechanics framework for a bundle of Nf living\nand uncrosslinked actin filaments in a supercritical solution of free monomers\npressing against a mobile wall. The filaments are anchored normally to a fixed\nplanar surface at one of their ends and, because of their limited flexibility,\nthey grow almost parallel to each other. Their growing ends hit a moving\nobstacle, depicted as a second planar wall, parallel to the previous one and\nsubjected to a harmonic compressive force. The force constant is denoted as\ntrap strength while the distance between the two walls as trap length to make\ncontact with the experimental optical trap apparatus. For an ideal solution of\nreactive filaments and free monomers at fixed free monomers chemical potential,\nwe obtain the general expression for the grand potential from which we derive\naverages and distributions of relevant physical quantities, namely the obstacle\nposition, the bundle polymerization force and the number of filaments in direct\ncontact with the wall. The grafted living filaments are modeled as discrete\nWormlike chains, with Factin persistence length, subject to discrete contour\nlength variations to model single monomer (de)polymerization steps. Rigid\nfilaments, either isolated or in bundles, all provide average values of the\nstalling force in agreement with Hill's predictions, independent of the average\ntrap length. Flexible filaments instead, for values of the trap strength\nsuitable to prevent their lateral escape, provide an average bundle force and\nan average trap length slightly larger than the corresponding rigid cases (few\npercents). Still the stalling force remains nearly independent on the average\ntrap length, but results from the product of two strongly L dependent\ncontributions: the fraction of touching filaments and the single filament\nbuckling force.\n", "  All optical magnetic switching (AOS) is a recently observed rich and puzzling\nphenomenon that offers promis- ing technological applications. However,\nfundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here we\npresent a new model for multi-shot helicity-dependent AOS in ferromagnetic\nmaterials based on a purely heat-driven mechanism in the presence of Magnetic\nCircular Dichroism (MCD). We predict that AOS should be possible with as little\nas 0.5% of MCD, after a minimum number of laser shots. Finally, we re- produce\nprevious AOS results by simulating the sweeping of a laser beam on an FePtC\ngranular ferromagnetic film.\n", "  The Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope observed 184 carbon\nstars in the Magellanic Clouds. This sample reveals that the dust-production\nrate (DPR) from carbon stars generally increases with the pulsation period of\nthe star. The composition of the dust grains follows two condensation\nsequences, with more SiC condensing before amorphous carbon in metal-rich\nstars, and the order reversed in metal-poor stars. MgS dust condenses in\noptically thicker dust shells, and its condensation is delayed in more\nmetal-poor stars. Metal-poor carbon stars also tend to have stronger absorption\nfrom C2H2 at 7.5 um. The relation between DPR and pulsation period shows\nsignificant apparent scatter, which results from the initial mass of the star,\nwith more massive stars occupying a sequence parallel to lower-mass stars, but\nshifted to longer periods. Accounting for differences in the mass distribution\nbetween the carbon stars observed in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds\nreveals a hint of a subtle decrease in the DPR at lower metallicities, but it\nis not statistically significant. The most deeply embedded carbon stars have\nlower variability amplitudes and show SiC in absorption. In some cases they\nhave bluer colors at shorter wavelengths, suggesting that the central star is\nbecoming visible. These deeply embedded stars may be evolving off of the AGB\nand/or they may have non-spherical dust geometries.\n", "  We consider the random walk on a lattice with random transition rates and\narbitrarily long-range jumps. We employ Bruggeman's effective medium\napproximation (EMA) to find the disorder averaged (coarse-grained) dynamics.\nThe EMA procedure replaces the disordered system with a cleverly guessed\nreference system in a self-consistent manner. We give necessary conditions on\nthe reference system and discuss possible physical mechanisms of anomalous\ndiffusion. In case of a power-law scaling between transition rates and\ndistance, lattice variants of Levy-ights emerge as the effective medium, and\nthe problem is solved analytically, bearing the effective anomalous\ndiffusivity. Finally, we discuss several example distributions, and demonstrate\nvery good agreement with numerical simulations.\n", "  Superconducting targets have recently been proposed for the direct detection\nof dark matter as light as a keV, via elastic scattering off conduction\nelectrons in Cooper pairs. Detecting such light dark matter requires\nsensitivity to energies as small as the superconducting gap of O(meV). Here we\nshow that these same superconducting devices can detect much lighter DM, of meV\nto eV mass, via dark matter absorption on a conduction electron, followed by\nemission of an athermal phonon. We demonstrate the power of this setup for\nrelic kinetically mixed hidden photons, pseudoscalars, and scalars, showing the\nreach can exceed current astrophysical and terrestrial constraints with only a\nmoderate exposure.\n", "  We present MUSE observations of the debated ultra faint stellar system\nCrater. We spectroscopically confirm 26 member stars of this system via radial\nvelocity measurements. We derive the systematic instrumental velocity\nuncertainty of MUSE spectra to be 2.27$\\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}$. This new dataset\nincreases the confirmed member stars of Crater by a factor of 3. One out of\nthree bright blue stars and a fainter blue star just above the\nmain-sequence-turn-off are also found to be likely members of the system. The\nobservations reveal that Crater has a systemic radial velocity of $v_{\\rm\nsys}=148.18^{\\rm +1.08}_{\\rm -1.15}\\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}$, whereas the most likely\nvelocity dispersion of this system is $\\sigma_{\\rm v}=2.04^{\\rm +2.19}_{\\rm\n-1.06} \\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}$. The total dynamical mass of the system, assuming\ndynamical equilibrium is then $M_{\\rm tot}=1.50^{+4.9}_{-1.2}\\cdot 10^{\\rm\n5}M_{\\odot}$ implying a mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_{\\rm\nV}$=8.52$^{+28.0}_{-6.5}\\, M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, which is consistent with a\npurely baryonic stellar population within its errors and no significant\nevidence for the presence dark matter was found. We also find evidence for a\nvelocity gradient in the radial velocity distribution. We conclude that our\nfindings strongly support that Crater is a faint intermediate-age outer halo\nglobular cluster and not a dwarf galaxy.\n", "  Rotational light modulation in Kepler photometry of K - A stars is used to\nestimate the absolute rotational shear. The rotation frequency spread in 2562\ncarefully selected stars with known rotation periods is measured using\ntime-frequency diagrams. The variation of rotational shear as a function of\neffective temperature in restricted ranges of rotation period is determined.\nThe shear increases to a maximum in F stars, but decreases somewhat in the A\nstars. Theoretical models reproduce the temperature variation quite well. The\ndependence of rotation shear on rotation rate in restricted temperature ranges\nis also determined. The dependence of the shear on the rotation rate is weak in\nK and G stars, increases rapidly for F stars and is strongest in A stars. For\nstars earlier than type K, a discrepancy exists between the predicted and\nobserved variation of shear with rotation rate. There is a strong increase in\nthe fraction of stars with zero frequency spread with increasing effective\ntemperature. The time-frequency diagrams for A stars are no different from\nthose in cool stars, further supporting the presence of spots in stars with\nradiative envelopes.\n", "  We present numerical details of the evaluation of the so-called Bose-ghost\npropagator in lattice minimal Landau gauge, for the SU(2) case in four\nEuclidean dimensions. This quantity has been proposed as a carrier of the\nconfining force in the Gribov-Zwanziger approach and, as such, its infrared\nbehavior could be relevant for the understanding of color confinement in\nYang-Mills theories. Also, its nonzero value can be interpreted as direct\nevidence of BRST-symmetry breaking, which is induced when restricting the\nfunctional measure to the first Gribov region Omega. Our simulations are done\nfor lattice volumes up to 120^4 and for physical lattice extents up to 13.5 fm.\nWe investigate the infinite-volume and continuum limits.\n", "  Recent experiments on silicon nanostructures have seen breakthroughs toward\nscalable, long-lived quantum information processing. The valley degree of\nfreedom plays a fundamental role in these devices, and the two lowest-energy\nelectronic states of a silicon quantum dot can form a valley qubit. In this\nwork, we show that a single-atom high step at the silicon/barrier interface\ninduces a strong interaction of the qubit and in-plane electric fields, and\nanalyze the consequences of this enhanced interaction on the dynamics of the\nqubit. The charge densities of the qubit states are deformed differently by the\ninterface step, allowing non-demolition qubit readout via valley-to-charge\nconversion. A gate-induced in-plane electric field together with the interface\nstep enables fast control of the valley qubit via electrically driven valley\nresonance. We calculate single- and two-qubit gate times, as well as relaxation\nand dephasing times, and present predictions for the parameter range where the\ngate times can be much shorter than the relaxation time and dephasing is\nreduced.\n", "  We study transport properties of graphene with anisotropically distributed\non-site impurities (adatoms) that are randomly placed on every third line drawn\nalong carbon bonds. We show that stripe states characterized by strongly\nsuppressed back-scattering are formed in this model in the direction of the\nlines. The system reveals L\\'evy-flight transport in stripe direction such that\nthe corresponding conductivity increases as the square root of the system\nlength. Thus, adding this type of disorder to clean graphene near the Dirac\npoint strongly enhances the conductivity, which is in stark contrast with a\nfully random distribution of on-site impurities which leads to Anderson\nlocalization. The effect is demonstrated both by numerical simulations using\nthe Kwant code and by an analytical theory based on the self-consistent\n$T$-matrix approximation.\n", "  We show how to compute the electrooptical functions (absorption, reflection,\nand transmission) when Rydberg Excitons appear, including the effect of the\ncoherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic field. With\nthe use of Real Density Matrix Approach numerical calculations applied for\nCu$_2$0 crystal are performed. We also examine in detail and explain the\ndependence of the resonance displacement on the state number and applied\nelectric field strength. We report a good agreement with recently published\nexperimental data.\n", "  Ballistic Josephson junctions are studied in the presence of a spin-splitting\nfield and spin-orbit coupling. A generic expression for the quasi-classical\nGreen's function is obtained and with its help we analyze several aspects of\nthe proximity effect between a spin-textured normal metal (N) and singlet\nsuperconductors (S). In particular, we show that the density of states may show\na zero-energy peak which is a generic consequence of the spin-dependent\ncouplings in heterostructures. In addition we also obtain the spin current and\nthe induced magnetic moment in a SNS structure and discuss possible coherent\nmanipulation of the magnetization which results from the coupling between the\nsuperconducting phase and the spin degree of freedom. Our theory predicts a\nspin accumulation at the S/N interfaces, and transverse spin currents flowing\nperpendicular to the junction interfaces. Some of these findings can be\nunderstood in the light of a non-Abelian electrostatics.\n", "  We present an analysis of local properties of magnetic reconnection at the\ndayside magnetopause for various interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\norientations in global magnetospheric simulations. This has heretofore not been\npractical because it is difficult to locate where reconnection occurs for\noblique IMF, but new techniques make this possible. The approach is to identify\nmagnetic separators, the curves separating four regions of differing magnetic\ntopology, which map the reconnection X-line. The electric field parallel to the\nX-line is the local reconnection rate. We compare results to a simple model of\nlocal two-dimensional asymmetric reconnection. To do so, we find the plasma\nparameters that locally drive reconnection in the magnetosheath and\nmagnetosphere in planes perpendicular to the X-line at a large number of points\nalong the X-line. The global magnetohydrodynamic simulations are from the\nthree-dimensional Block-Adaptive, Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme\n(BATS-R-US) code with a uniform resistivity, although the techniques described\nhere are extensible to any global magnetospheric simulation model. We find that\nthe predicted local reconnection rates scale well with the measured values for\nall simulations, being nearly exact for due southward IMF. However, the\nabsolute predictions differ by an undetermined constant of proportionality,\nwhose magnitude increases as the IMF clock angle changes from southward to\nnorthward. We also show similar scaling agreement in a simulation with oblique\nsouthward IMF and a dipole tilt. The present results will be an important\ncomponent of a full understanding of the local and global properties of dayside\nreconnection.\n", "  We study high temperature spin transport in a disordered Heisenberg chain in\nthe ergodic regime. By employing a density matrix renormalization group\ntechnique for the study of the stationary states of the boundary-driven\nLindblad equation we are able to study extremely large systems (400 spins). We\nfind both a diffusive and a subdiffusive phase depending on the strength of the\ndisorder and on the anisotropy parameter of the Heisenberg chain. Studying\nfinite-size effects we show numerically and theoretically that a very large\ncrossover length exists that controls the passage of a clean-system dominated\ndynamics to one observed in the thermodynamic limit. Such a large length scale,\nbeing larger than the sizes studied before, explains previous conflicting\nresults. We also predict spatial profiles of magnetization in steady states of\ngeneric nondiffusive systems.\n", "  The confirmation of a globular cluster (GC) in the recently discovered\nultrafaint galaxy Eridanus II (Eri II) motivated us to examine the question\nposed in the title. After estimating the halo mass of Eri II using a published\nstellar mass - halo mass relation, the one GC in this galaxy supports extending\nthe relationship between the number of GCs hosted by a galaxy and the galaxy's\ntotal mass about two orders of magnitude in stellar mass below the previous\nlimit. For this empirically determined specific frequency of between 0.06 and\n0.39 globular clusters per 10$^9$ $M_\\odot$ of total mass, the surviving Milky\nWay (MW) subhalos with masses smaller than $10^{10} M_\\odot$ could host as many\nas 5 to 31 GCs, broadly consistent with the actual population of outer halo MW\nGCs, although matching the radial distribution in detail remains a challenge.\nUsing a subhalo mass function from published high resolution numerical\nsimulations and a Poissonian model for populating those halos with the\naforementioned empirically constrained frequency, we find that about 90$\\%$ of\nthese GCs lie in lower-mass subhalos than that of Eri II. From what we know\nabout the stellar mass-halo mass function, the subhalo mass function, and the\nmass-normalized GC specific frequency, we conclude that some of the MW's outer\nhalo GCs are likely to be hosted by undetected subhalos with extremely modest\nstellar populations.\n", "  Astrophysical plasmas are typically magnetized, with the Larmor radii of the\ncharged particles many orders of magnitude smaller than their collisional mean\nfree paths. The fundamental properties of such plasmas, e.g., conduction and\nviscosity, may depend on the instabilities driven by the anisotropy of the\nparticle distribution functions and operating at scales comparable to the\nLarmor scales. We discuss a possibility that the pressure anisotropy of thermal\nelectrons could produce polarization of thermal bremsstrahlung emission. In\nparticular, we consider coherent large-scale motions in galaxy clusters to\nestimate the level of anisotropy driven by stretching of the magnetic-field\nlines by plasma flow and by heat fluxes associated with thermal gradients. Our\nestimate of the degree of polarization is $\\sim 0.1 \\%$ at energies $\\gtrsim\nkT$. While this value is too low for the forthcoming generation of X-ray\npolarimeters, it is potentially an important proxy for the processes taking\nplace at extremely small scales, which are impossible to resolve spatially. The\nabsence of the effect at the predicted level may set a lower limit on the\nelectron collisionality in the ICM. At the same time, the small value of the\neffect implies that it does not preclude the use of clusters as (unpolarized)\ncalibration sources for X-ray polarimeters at this level of accuracy.\n", "  We apply the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for\nindistinguishable particles (MCTDH-X) to systems of bosons or fermions in\nlattices described by Hubbard type Hamiltonians with long-range or short-range\ninterparticle interactions. The wavefunction is expanded in a variationally\noptimized time-dependent many-body basis generated by a set of effective\ncreation operators that are related to the original particle creation operators\nby a time-dependent unitary transform. We use the time-dependent variational\nprinciple for the coefficients of this transform as well as the expansion\ncoefficients of the wavefunction in the time-dependent many-body basis as\nvariational parameters to derive equations of motion. The convergence of\nMCTDH-X is shown by comparing its results to the exact diagonalization of one-,\ntwo-, and three-dimensional lattices filled with bosons with contact\ninteractions. We use MCTDH-X to study the buildup of correlations in the\nlong-time splitting dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a large\ntwo-dimensional lattice subject to a barrier that is ramped up in the center.\nWe find that the system is split into two parts with emergent time-dependent\ncorrelations that depend on the ramping time -- for most barrier-raising-times\nthe system becomes two-fold fragmented, but for some of the very fast ramps,\nthe system shows revivals of coherence.\n", "  We investigate the inclusion of variable spins in electronic structure\nquantum Monte Carlo, with a focus on diffusion Monte Carlo with Hamiltonians\nthat include spin-orbit interactions. Following our previous introduction of\nfixed-phase spin-orbit diffusion Monte Carlo (FPSODMC), we thoroughly discuss\nthe details of the method and elaborate upon its technicalities. We present a\nproof for an upper-bound property for complex nonlocal operators, which allows\nfor the implementation of T-moves to ensure the variational property. We\ndiscuss the time step biases associated with our particular choice of spin\nrepresentation. Applications of the method are also presented for atomic and\nmolecular systems. We calculate the binding energies and geometry of the PbH\nand Sn$_2$ molecules, as well as the electron affinities of the 6$p$ row\nelements in close agreement with experiments.\n", "  Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we develop a new monte-carlo\nbased method to estimate the photometric metallicity distribution function\n(MDF) for stars in the Milky Way. Compared with other photometric calibration\nmethods, this method enables a more reliable determination of the MDF, in\nparticular at the metal-poor and metal-rich ends. We present a comparison of\nour new method with a previous polynomial-based approach, and demonstrate its\nsuperiority. As an example, we apply this method to main-sequence stars with\n$0.2<g-r<0.6$, $6$ kpc$<R<9$ kpc, and in different intervals in height above\nthe plane, $|Z|$. The MDFs for the selected stars within two relatively local\nintervals ($0.8$ kpc$<|Z|<1.2$ kpc, $1.5$ kpc$<|Z|<2.5$ kpc) can be well-fit by\ntwo Gaussians, with peaks at [Fe/H] $\\approx-0.6$ and $-1.2$ respectively, one\nassociated with the disk system, the other with the halo. The MDFs for the\nselected stars within two more distant intervals ($3$ kpc$<|Z|<5$ kpc, $6$\nkpc$<|Z|<9$ kpc) can be decomposed into three Gaussians, with peaks at [Fe/H]\n$\\approx-0.6$, $-1.4$ and $-1.9$ respectively, where the two lower peaks may\nprovide evidence for a two-component model of the halo: the inner halo and the\nouter halo. The number ratio between the disk component and halo component(s)\ndecreases with vertical distance from the Galactic plane, consistent with the\nprevious literature.\n", "  Analysis of gamma-ray emission from the supernova remnant G78.2+2.1 ($\\gamma$\nCygni) with 7.2 years of cumulative data from the Fermi-LAT telescope shows a\ndistinct hard, bright and extended component to the north of the shell\ncoincident with the known TeV source VER J2019+407. In the GeV-TeV energy range\nits spectrum is best described by a broken power-law with indices 1.8 below a\nbreak energy of 71 GeV and 2.5 above the break. A broadband spectral energy\ndistribution is assembled and different scenarios for the origin of the\ngamma-rays are explored. Both hadronic and leptonic mechanisms are able to\naccount for the GeV-TeV observations. In the leptonic framework, a\nsuperposition of inverse Compton and nonthermal bremsstrahlung emissions is\nneeded whereas the hadronic scenario requires a cosmic ray population described\nby a broken power-law distribution with a relatively hard spectral index of\n$\\sim1.8$ below a break particle energy of 0.45 TeV. In addition, the neutrino\nflux expected from cosmic ray interactions is calculated.\n", "  Neutrinos play a crucial role in many aspects of astrophysics and cosmology.\nSince they control the electron fraction, or equivalently neutron-to-proton\nratio, neutrino properties impact yields of r-process nucleosynthesis.\nSimilarly the weak decoupling temperature in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis epoch\nis exponentially dependent on the neutron-to-proton ratio. In these conference\nproceedings, I briefly summarize some of the recent work exploring the role of\nneutrinos in astrophysics and cosmology.\n", "  Understanding optical conductivity data in the optimally doped cuprates in\nthe framework of quantum criticality requires a strongly-coupled quantum\ncritical metal which violates hyperscaling. In the simplest scaling framework,\nhyperscaling violation can be characterized by a single non-zero exponent\n$\\theta$, so that in a spatially isotropic state in $d$ spatial dimensions, the\nspecific heat scales with temperature as $T^{(d-\\theta)/z}$, and the optical\nconductivity scales with frequency as $\\omega^{(d-\\theta-2)/z}$ for $\\omega \\gg\nT$, where $z$ is the dynamic critical exponent. We study the Ising-nematic\ncritical point, using the controlled dimensional regularization method proposed\nby Dalidovich and Lee (Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 88}, 245106 (2013)). We find that\nhyperscaling is violated, with $\\theta =1$ in $d=2$. We expect that similar\nresults apply to Fermi surfaces coupled to gauge fields in $d=2$.\n", "  We investigate the logarithmic negativity in strongly-disordered spin chains\nin the random-singlet phase. We focus on the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain\nand the random XX chain. We find that for two arbitrary intervals the\ndisorder-averaged negativity and the mutual information are proportional to the\nnumber of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder\nrenormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent\nintervals grows logarithmically with the intervals length. In particular, the\nscaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different\nprefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal\nsimple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function\nof the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in\ncontrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our\npredictions using a numerical implementation of the SDRG method. Finally, we\nalso implement DMRG simulations for the negativity in open spin chains. The\nchains accessible in the presence of strong disorder are not sufficiently long\nto provide a reliable confirmation of the SDRG results.\n", "  We present a correlation between the average temporal decay\n({\\alpha}X,avg,>200s) and early-time luminosity (LX,200s) of X-ray afterglows\nof gamma-ray bursts as observed by Swift-XRT. Both quantities are measured\nrelative to a rest frame time of 200 s after the {\\gamma}-ray trigger. The\nluminosity average decay correlation does not depend on specific temporal\nbehavior and contains one scale independent quantity minimizing the role of\nselection effects. This is a complementary correlation to that discovered by\nOates et al. (2012) in the optical light curves observed by Swift-UVOT. The\ncorrelation indicates that on average, more luminous X-ray afterglows decay\nfaster than less luminous ones, indicating some relative mechanism for energy\ndissipation. The X-ray and optical correlations are entirely consistent once\ncorrections are applied and contamination is removed. We explore the possible\nbiases introduced by different light curve morphologies and observational\nselection effects, and how either geometrical effects or intrinsic properties\nof the central engine and jet could explain the observed correlation.\n", "  The evolution of the inner accretion flow of a black hole X-ray binary\n(BHXRB) during the outburst is still a matter of active research. X-ray\nreverberation lags are powerful tools to constrain the disk-corona geometry. We\npresent a study of X-ray lags in the black hole transient H1743-322. We\ncompared results obtained from the analysis of all the publicly available\nXMM-Newton observations. These observations were carried out during two\ndifferent outbursts, happened in 2008 and 2014. During all the observations the\nsource is caught in the hard state and at similar luminosities\n($\\mathrm{L_{3-10\\ keV}/L_{Edd}\\sim 0.004}$). We detected a soft X-ray lag of\n$\\sim$60 ms, most likely due to thermal reverberation. We did not detect any\nsignificant change of the lag amplitude among the different observations,\nindicating a similar disk-corona geometry at the same luminosity in the hard\nstate. On the other hand, we observe significant differences between the\nreverberation lag detected in H1743-322 and in GX 339-4 (at similar\nluminosities in the hard state), which might indicate variations of the\ngeometry from source to source.\n", "  The fabrication of polylactic acid (PLA)-carbonated hydroxyapatite (cHAP)\ncomposite material from synthesised phase pure nano-cHAP and melted PLA by\nmechanical mixing at 220-235{\\deg}C has been developed in this study.\nTopographical structuring of PLA-cHAP composite surfaces was performed by\ndirect laser writing (DLW). Microstructured surfaces and the apatite\ndistribution within the composite and formed grooves were evaluated by optical\nand scanning electron microscopies. The influence of the dopant concentration\nas well as the laser power and translation velocity on the composite surface\nmorphology is discussed. The synthesis of carbonated hydroxyapatite (cHAP)\nnanocrystalline powders via wet chemistry approach from calcium acetate and\ndiammonium hydrogen phosphate precursors together with crosslinking and\ncomplexing agents of polyethylene glycol, poly(vinyl alcohol) and\ntriethanolamine is also reported. Thermal decomposition of the gels and\nformation of nanocrystalline cHAP were evaluated by thermal analysis, mass\nspectrometry and dilatometry measurements. The effect of organic additives on\nthe formation and morphological features of cHAP was investigated. The phase\npurity and crystallinity of the carbonated apatite powders were evaluated by\nX-ray diffraction analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy.\n", "  We study the one-body reduced density matrix of a system of $N$\none-dimensional impenetrable anyons trapped by a harmonic potential. To this\npurpose we extend two methods developed to tackle related problems, namely the\ndeterminant approach and the replica method. While the former is the basis for\nexact numerical computations at finite $N$, the latter has the advantage of\nproviding an analytic asymptotic expansion for large $N$. We show that the\nfirst few terms of such expansion are sufficient to reproduce the numerical\nresults to an excellent accuracy even for relatively small $N$, thus\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the replica method.\n", "  Recently, in a few case studies we demonstrated that gyrosynchrotron\nmicrowave emission can be detected directly from the acceleration region when\nthe trapped electron component is insignificant. For the statistical study\nreported here, we have identified events with steep (narrowband) microwave\nspectra that do not show a significant trapped component and at the same time\nshow evidence of source uniformity, which simplifies the data analysis greatly.\nInitially, we identified a subset of more than 20 radio bursts with such narrow\nspectra, having low- and high-frequency spectral indices larger than 3 in\nabsolute value. A steep low-frequency spectrum implies that the emission is\nnonthermal (for optically-thick thermal emission, the spectral index cannot be\nsteeper than 2), and the source is reasonably dense and uniform. A steep\nhigh-frequency spectrum implies that no significant electron trapping occurs;\notherwise a progressive spectral flattening would be observed. Roughly half of\nthese radio bursts have RHESSI data, which allows for detailed, joint\ndiagnostics of the source parameters and evolution. Based on an analysis of\nradio-to-X-ray spatial relationships, timing, and spectral fits, we conclude\nthat the microwave emission in these narrowband bursts originates directly from\nthe acceleration regions, which have relatively strong magnetic field, high\ndensity, and low temperature. In contrast, the thermal X-ray emission comes\nfrom a distinct loop with smaller magnetic field, lower density, but higher\ntemperature. Therefore, these flares occurred likely due to interaction between\ntwo (or more) magnetic loops.\n", "  The coupling of resonant light and surface plasmons in metal layer coated\noptical microcavities results in the formation of hybrid photon-plasmon modes.\nHere, we comprehensively investigate the hybridization mechanism of\nphoton-plasmon modes based on opto-plasmonic microtubular cavities. By changing\nthe cavity structure and the metal layer thickness, weakly, moderately and\nstrongly hybridized resonant modes are demonstrated depending on the\nphoton-plasmon coupling strength. An effective potential approach is applied to\nillustrate the hybridization of photon-plasmon modes relying on the competition\nbetween light confinement by the cavity wall and the potential barrier\nintroduced by the metal layer. Our work reveals the basic physical mechanisms\nfor the generation of hybrid modes in metal-coated whispering-gallery-mode\nmicrocavities, and is of importance for the study of enhanced light-matter\ninteractions and potential sensing applications.\n", "  We study the localization transition of an atom confined by an external\noptical lattice in a high-finesse cavity. The atom-cavity coupling yields an\neffective secondary lattice potential, whose wavelength is incommensurate with\nthe periodicity of the optical lattice. The cavity lattice can induce\nlocalization of the atomic wave function analogously to the Aubry-Andr\\'e\nlocalization transition. Starting from the master equation for the cavity and\nthe atom we perform a mapping of the system dynamics to a Hubbard Hamiltonian,\nwhich can be reduced to the Harper's Hamiltonian in appropriate limits. We\nevaluate the phase diagram for the atom ground state and show that the\ntransition between extended and localized wavefunction is controlled by the\nstrength of the cavity nonlinearity, which determines the size of the localized\nregion and the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent, in\nparticular, exhibits resonance-like behaviour in correspondence with the\noptomechanical resonances. Finally we discuss the experimental feasibility of\nthese predictions.\n", "  General relativistic ray tracing simulations of the time-averaged spectrum\nand energy-dependent time delays in AGN are presented. We model the lamp-post\ngeometry in which the accreting gas is illuminated by an X-ray source located\non the rotation axis of the black hole. The spectroscopic features imprinted in\nthe reflection component are modelled using REFLIONX. The associated time\ndelays after the direct continuum, known as reverberation lags, are computed\nincluding the full effects of dilution and ionization gradients on the disc. We\nperform, for the first time, simultaneous fitting of the time-averaged and\nlag-energy spectra in three AGN: Mrk 335, IRAS 13224-3809 and Ark 564 observed\nwith XMM-Newton. The best fitting source height and central mass of each AGN\npartly agree with those previously reported. We find that including the\nionization gradient in the model naturally explains lag-energy observations in\nwhich the 3 keV and 7-10 keV bands precede other bands. To obtain the clear 3\nkeV and 7-10 keV dips in the lag-energy profile, the model requires either a\nsource height > 5$r_g$, or a disc that is highly ionized at small radii and is\ncolder further out. We also show that fitting the lag or the mean spectra alone\ncan lead to different results and interpretations. This is therefore important\nto combine the spectral and timing data in order to find the plausible but\nself-consistent fits which is achievable with our model.\n", "  We investigate a possible method for determining the progenitors of black\nhole (BH) mergers observed via their gravitational wave (GW) signal. We argue\nthat measurements of the cross-correlation of the GW events with overlapping\ngalaxy catalogs may provide an additional tool in determining if BH mergers\ntrace the stellar mass of the Universe, as would be expected from mergers of\nthe endpoints of stellar evolution. If on the other hand the BHs are of\nprimordial origin, as has been recently suggested, their merging would be\npreferentially hosted by lower biased objects, and thus have a lower\ncross-correlation with luminous galaxies. Here we forecast the expected\nprecision of the cross-correlation measurement for current and future GW\ndetectors such as LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We then predict how well\nthese instruments can distinguish the model that identifies high-mass BH-BH\nmergers as the merger of primordial black holes that constitute the dark matter\nin the Universe from more traditional astrophysical sources.\n", "  Linear polarization of high-energy gamma-rays (10 MeV-100 GeV) can be\ndetected by measuring the azimuthal angle of electron-positron pairs and\nobserving the modulation of the azimuthal distribution. To demonstrate the\ngamma-ray polarization sensitivity of emulsion, we conducted a test using a\npolarized gamma-ray beam at SPring-8/LEPS. Emulsion tracks were reconstructed\nusing scanning data, and gamma-ray events were selected automatically. Using an\noptical microscope, out of the 2381 gamma-ray conversions that were observed,\n1372 remained after event selection, on the azimuthal angle distribution of\nwhich we measured the modulation. From the distribution of the azimuthal angles\nof the selected events, a modulation factor of 0.21 + 0.11 - 0.09 was measured,\nfrom which the detection of a non-zero modulation was established with a\nsignificance of 3.06 $\\sigma$. This attractive polarimeter will be applied to\nthe GRAINE project, a balloon-borne experiment that observes cosmic gamma-rays\nwith an emulsion-based pair conversion telescope.\n", "  A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) on the line with an exact\ndiscrete $U(N)$ gauge invariance is introduced. It is shown that the continuous\nlimit of these DTQWs, when it exists, coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac\nfermion coupled to usual $U(N)$ gauge fields in $2D$ spacetime. A discrete\ngeneralization of the usual $U(N)$ curvature is also constructed. An alternate\ninterpretation of these results in terms of superimposed $U(1)$ Maxwell fields\nand $SU(N)$ gauge fields is discussed in the Appendix. Numerical simulations\nare also presented, which explore the convergence of the DTQWs towards their\ncontinuous limit and which also compare the DTQWs with classical (i.e.\nnon-quantum) motions in classical $SU(2)$ fields. The results presented in this\narticle constitute a first step towards quantum simulations of generic\nYang-Mills gauge theories through DTQWs.\n", "  Methanol is a common component of interstellar and circumstellar ice mantles\nand is often used as an evolution indicator in star-forming regions. The\nobservations of gas-phase methanol in the interiors of dense molecular clouds\nat temperatures as low as 10 K suggests that a non-thermal ice desorption must\nbe active. Ice photodesorption was proposed to explain the abundances of\ngas-phase molecules toward the coldest regions. Laboratory experiments were\nperformed to investigate the potential photodesorption of methanol toward the\ncoldest regions. Solid methanol was deposited at 8 K and UV-irradiated at\nvarious temperatures starting from 8 K. The irradiation of the ice was\nmonitored by means of infrared spectroscopy and the molecules in the gas phase\nwere detected using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. Fully deuterated methanol was\nused for confirmation of the results. The photodesorption of methanol to the\ngas phase was not observed in the mass spectra at different irradiation\ntemperatures. We estimate an upper limit of 3x10e-5 molecules per incident\nphoton. On the other hand, photon-induced desorption of the main photoproducts\nwas clearly observed. The negligible photodesorption of methanol could be\nexplained by the ability of UV-photons in the 114 - 180 nm (10.87 - 6.88 eV)\nrange to dissociate this molecule efficiently. Therefore, the presence of\ngas-phase methanol in the absence of thermal desorption remains unexplained. On\nthe other hand, we find CH_4 to desorb from irradiated methanol ice, which was\nnot found to desorb in the pure CH_4 ice irradiation experiments.\n", "  We present Doppler tomographic analyses for the spectroscopic transits of\nKELT-7b and HAT-P-56b, two hot-Jupiters orbiting rapidly rotating F-dwarf host\nstars. These include analyses of archival TRES observations for KELT-7b, and a\nnew TRES transit observation of HAT-P-56b. We report spin-orbit aligned\ngeometries for KELT-7b (2.7 +/- 0.6 deg) and HAT-P-56b (8 +/- 2 deg). The host\nstars KELT-7 and HAT-P-56 are among some of the most rapidly rotating\nplanet-hosting stars known. We examine the tidal re-alignment model for the\nevolution of the spin-orbit angle in the context of the spin rates of these\nstars. We find no evidence that the rotation rates of KELT-7 and HAT-P-56 have\nbeen modified by star-planet tidal interactions, suggesting that the spin-orbit\nangle of systems around these hot stars may represent their primordial\nconfiguration. In fact, KELT-7 and HAT-P-56 are two of three systems in\nsuper-synchronous, spin-orbit aligned states, where the rotation periods of the\nhost stars are faster than the orbital periods of the planets.\n", "  We discuss identification of possible counterparts and persistent sources\nrelated to Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in the framework of the model of supergiant\npulses from young neutron stars with large spin-down luminosities. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that at least some of sources of FRBs can be\nobserved as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). At the moment no ULXs are known\nto be coincident with localization areas of FRBs. We searched for a correlation\nof FRB positions with galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift survey catalogue. Our\nanalysis produced statistically insignificant overabundance ($p$-value $\\approx\n4\\%$) of galaxies in error boxes of FRBs. In the very near future with even\nmodestly increased statistics of FRBs and with the help of dedicated X-ray\nobservations and all-sky X-ray surveys it will be possible to decisively prove\nor falsify the supergiant pulses model.\n", "  We present the results of HI spectral stacking analysis of Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) observations targeting the COSMOS field. The GMRT data\ncube contains 474 field galaxies with redshifts known from the zCOSMOS-bright\n10k catalogue. Spectra for the galaxies are co-added and the stacked spectrum\nallows us to make a $\\sim 3\\sigma$ measurement of the average HI mass. Using\nthis average HI mass along with the integral optical $B$-band luminosity of the\ngalaxies and the luminosity density of the COSMOS field, a volume normalisation\nis applied to obtain the cosmic HI mass density ($\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$). We find a\ncosmic HI mass density of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ = (0.42 $\\pm$ 0.16) $\\times$\n10$^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 0.37$, which is the highest-redshift measurement of\n$\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ ever made using HI spectral stacking. The value we obtained\nfor $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ at $z \\sim 0.37$ is consistent with that measured from\nlarge blind 21-cm surveys at $z = 0$ as well as measurements from other HI\nstacking experiments at lower redshifts. Our measurement in conjunction with\nearlier measurements indicates that there has been no significant evolution of\nHI gas abundance over the last 4 Gyr. A weighted mean of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ from\nall 21-cm measurements at redshifts $z \\lesssim 0.4$ gives $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ =\n(0.35 $\\pm$ 0.01) $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$. The $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ measured (from HI\n21-cm emission measurements) at $z \\lesssim 0.4$ is however approximately half\nthat measured from Damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ Absorption (DLA) systems at $z \\gtrsim\n2$. Deeper surveys with existing and upcoming instruments will be critical to\nunderstand the evolution of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ in the redshift range\nintermediate between $z \\sim 0.4$ and the range probed by DLA observations.\n", "  We study the properties of 975 active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected by\nvariability in the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey. Using complementary multi\nwavelength data from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared, we use SED fitting to\ndetermine the AGN and host properties at $z<1$, and compare to a well-matched\ncontrol sample. We confirm the trend previously observed that the variability\namplitude decreases with AGN luminosity, but on the other hand, we observe that\nthe slope of this relation steepens with wavelength resulting in a \"redder when\nbrighter\" trend at low luminosities. Our results show that AGN are hosted by\nmore massive hosts than control sample galaxies, while the restframe,\ndust-corrected $NUV-r$ color distribution of AGN hosts is similar to control\ngalaxies. We find a positive correlation between the AGN luminosity and star\nformation rate (SFR), independent of redshift. AGN hosts populate the whole\nrange of SFRs within and outside the Main Sequence of star forming galaxies.\nComparing the distribution of AGN hosts and control galaxies, we show that AGN\nhosts are less likely to be hosted by quiescent galaxies, but more likely to be\nhosted by Main Sequence or starburst galaxies.\n", "  In order to investigate star formation (SF) processes in extreme\nenvironments, we have carried out a multi-wavelength analysis of the\nmid-infrared bubble N46, which hosts a WN7 Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star. We have used\n13CO line data to trace an expanding shell surrounding the W-R star containing\nabout five condensations within the molecular cloud associated with the bubble.\nThe W-R star is associated with a powerful stellar wind having a mechanical\nluminosity of ~4 x 10^37 ergs/s. A deviation of the H-band starlight mean\npolarization angles around the bubble has also been traced, indicating the\nimpact of stellar wind on the surroundings. The Herschel temperature map shows\na temperature range of ~18 - 24 K toward the five molecular condensations. The\nphotometric analysis reveals that these condensations are associated with the\nidentified clusters of young stellar objects, revealing ongoing SF process. The\ndensest among these five condensations (peak N(H_2) ~9.2 x 10^22 cm^-2 and A_V\n~ 98 mag) is associated with a 6.7 GHz methanol maser, an infrared dark cloud,\nand the CO outflow, tracing active massive SF within it. At least five compact\nradio sources (crss) are physically linked with the edges of the bubble and\neach of them is consistent with the radio spectral class of a B0V - B0.5V type\nstar. The ages of the individual infrared counterparts of three crss (~1 - 2\nMyr) and a typical age of WN7 W-R star (~4 Myr) indicate that the SF activities\naround the bubble are influenced by the feedback of the W-R star.\n", "  We compare the physical parameters and the relative abundances calculated\nthroughout supernova (SN) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies by the\ndetailed modelling of the spectra. The results show that : 1) shock velocities\nare lower in long period GRB (LGRB) than in SN host galaxies. 2) O/H relative\nabundance in SN hosts are scattered within a range 8.0 <12+log(O/H)<8.85 but\nthey are close to solar in LGRB hosts. N/H are lower than solar for both SN and\nLGRB. 3) The starburst temperatures within a few SN hosts reach Ts >10^5 K. Ts\nin LGRB hosts are 3-8 10^4 K. 4) Ha increases with the ionization parameter U.\nWe suggest that SN-host symbiosis is stronger in terms of host galaxy activity\nthan GRB-host in the range of energies related to the near UV - optical - near\nIR spectra.\n", "  In this paper we report the results of an X-ray monitoring campaign on the\nheavily obscured Seyfert galaxy Markarian 3 carried out between the fall of\n2014 and the spring of 2015 with NuSTAR, Suzaku and XMM-Newton. The hard X-ray\nspectrum of Markarian 3 is variable on all the time scales probed by our\ncampaign, down to a few days. The observed continuum variability is due to an\nintrinsically variable primary continuum seen in transmission through a large,\nbut still Compton-thin column density (N_H~0.8-1.1$\\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$).\nIf arranged in a spherical-toroidal geometry, the Compton scattering matter has\nan opening angle ~66 degrees and is seen at a grazing angle through its upper\nrim (inclination angle ~70 degrees). We report a possible occultation event\nduring the 2014 campaign. If the torus is constituted by a system of clouds\nsharing the same column density, this event allows us to constrain their number\n(17$\\pm$5) and individual column density, [~(4.9$\\pm$1.5)$\\times$10$^{22}$\ncm$^{-2}$]. The comparison of IR and X-ray spectroscopic results with\nstate-of-the art \"torus\" models suggests that at least two thirds of the X-ray\nobscuring gas volume might be located within the dust sublimation radius. We\nreport also the discovery of an ionized absorber, characterised by variable\nresonant absorption lines due to He- and H-like iron. This discovery lends\nsupport to the idea that moderate column density absorbers could be due to\nclouds evaporated at the outer surface of the torus, possibly accelerated by\nthe radiation pressure due to the central AGN emission leaking through the\npatchy absorber.\n", "  We present the results of the first complete unbaised survey of the Galactic\nPlane for 6035-MHz excited-state hydroxyl masers undertaken as part of the\nMethanol Multibeam Survey. These observations cover the Galactic longitude\nranges $186^{\\circ}< l < 60^{\\circ}$ including the Galactic Centre. We report\nthe detection of 127 excited-state hydroxyl masers within the survey region, 47\nbeing new sources. The positions of new detections were determined from\ninterferometric observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We\ndiscuss the association of 6035-MHz masers in our survey with the 6668-MHz\nmasers from the MMB Survey, finding 37 likely methanol-excited-state hydroxyl\nmasers maser pairs with physical separations of <=0.03pc and 55 pairings\nseparated by <=0.1pc. Using these we calculate for the first time an\nexcited-state hydroxyl maser life time of between 3.3x10^3 and 8.3x10^3 years.\nWe also discuss the variability of the 6035-MHz masers and detection rates of\ncounterpart 6030-MHz excited-state hydroxyl masers (28% of our sample having\ndetection at both frequencies).\n", "  We suggest an additional possible plasma source to explain part of the\nphenomena observed for the transiting hot Jupiters WASP-12b and HD 189733b in\ntheir ultraviolet (UV) light curves. In the proposed scenario, material\noutgasses from the molten surface of Trojan satellites on tadpole orbits near\nthe Lagrange points L$_4$ and L$_5$. We show that the temperature at the\norbital location of WASP-12b is high enough to melt the surface of rocky bodies\nand to form shallow lava oceans on them. In case of WASP-12b, this leads to the\nrelease of elements such as Mg and Ca, which are expected to surround the\nsystem. The predicted Mg and Ca outgassing rates from two Io-sized WASP-12b\nTrojans are $\\approx 2.2 \\times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\\approx 2.2 \\times\n10^{26}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. Trojan outgassing can lead to the apparent\nlack of emission in Mg{\\sc ii}\\,h\\&k and Ca{\\sc ii}\\,H\\&K line cores of\nWASP-12. For HD 189733b, the mechanism is only marginally possible due to the\nlower temperature. This may be one of the reasons that couldn't explain the\nearly ingress of HD 189733b observed in the far-UV (FUV) C{\\sc ii} doublet due\nto absence of carbon within elements outgassed by molten lava. We investigate\nthe long-term stability region of WASP-12b and HD 189733b in case of planar and\ninclined motion of these satellites and show that unlike the classical exomoons\norbiting the planet, Io-sized Trojans can be stable for the whole systems life\ntime.\n", "  We carried out a dynamical study of the galaxy cluster pair A3407 \\& A3408\nbased on a spectroscopic survey obtained with the 4 meter Blanco telescope at\nthe CTIO, plus 6dF data, and ROSAT All-Sky-Survey. The sample consists of 122\nmember galaxies brighter than $m_R=20$. Our main goal is to probe the galaxy\ndynamics in this field and verify if the sample constitutes a single galaxy\nsystem or corresponds to an ongoing merging process. Statistical tests were\napplied to clusters members showing that both the composite system A3407 +\nA3408 as well as each individual cluster have Gaussian velocity distribution. A\nvelocity gradient of $\\sim 847\\pm 114$ $\\rm km\\;s^{-1}$ was identified around\nthe principal axis of the projected distribution of galaxies, indicating that\nthe global field may be rotating. Applying the KMM algorithm to the\ndistribution of galaxies we found that the solution with two clusters is better\nthan the single unit solution at the 99\\% c.l. This is consistent with the\nX-ray distribution around this field, which shows no common X-ray halo\ninvolving A3407 and A3408. We also estimated virial masses and applied a\ntwo-body model to probe the dynamics of the pair. The more likely scenario is\nthat in which the pair is gravitationally bound and probably experiences a\ncollapse phase, with the cluster cores crossing in less than $\\sim$1 $h^{-1}$\nGyr, a pre-merger scenario. The complex X-ray morphology, the gas temperature,\nand some signs of galaxy evolution in A3408 suggests a post-merger scenario,\nwith cores having crossed each other $\\sim 1.65 h^{-1}$Gyr ago, as an\nalternative solution.\n", "  The most accurate 6D phase-space information from the Radial Velocity\nExperiment (RAVE) was used to integrate the orbits of 105 stars around the\ngalactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae, to look for close encounters between them\nin the past, with a minimum distance approach less than the cluster tidal\nradius. The stars are currently over the distance range 3.0 kpc $<$ d $<$ 5.5\nkpc. Using the uncertainties in the current position and velocity vector for\nboth, star and cluster, 105 pairs of star-cluster orbits were generated in a\nMonte Carlo numerical scheme, integrated over 2 Gyr and considering an\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric Milky-Way-like Galactic potential,\nrespectively. In this scheme, we identified 20 potential cluster members that\nhad close encounters with the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, all of which have a\nrelative velocity distribution (V$_{rel}$) less than 200 km s$^{-1}$ at the\nminimum distance approach. Among these potential members, 9 had close\nencounters with the cluster with velocities less than the escape velocity of 47\nTucanae, therefore a scenario of tidal stripping seems likely. These stars have\nbeen classified with a 93\\% confidence level, leading to the identification of\nextratidal cluster stars. For the other 11 stars, V$_{rel}$ exceeds the escape\nvelocity of the cluster, therefore they were likely ejected or are unassociated\ninterlopers.\n", "  Orientation, together with accretion and evolution, is one of the three main\ndrivers in the Grand Unification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Being\nunresolved, determining the true inclination of those powerful sources is\nalways difficult and indirect, yet it remains a vital clue to apprehend the\nnumerous, panchromatic and complex spectroscopic features we detect. There are\nonly a hundred inclinations derived so far; in this context, can we be sure\nthat we measure the true orientation of AGN? To answer this question, four\nmethods to estimate the nuclear inclination of AGN are investigated and\ncompared to inclination-dependent observables (hydrogen column density, Balmer\nlinewidth, optical polarization, and flux ratios within the IR and relative to\nX-rays). Among these orientation indicators, the method developed by Fisher,\nCrenshaw, Kraemer et al., mapping and modeling the radial velocities of the [O\niii] emission region in AGN, is the most successful. The [O iii]-mapping\ntechnique shows highly statistically significant correlations at >95%\nconfidence level for rejecting null hypothesis for all the test cases. Such\nresults confirm that the Unified Model is correct at a scale ranging from\nkiloparsec to a fraction of a parsec. However, at a radial distance less than\n0.01 pc from the central black hole, warps and misalignments may change this\npicture.\n", "  Silicon membranes patterned by nanometer-scale pillars standing on the\nsurface provide a practical platform for thermal conductivity reduction by\nresonance hybridization. Using molecular simulations, we investigate the effect\nof nanopillar size, unit-cell size, and finite-structure size on the net\ncapacity of the local resonators in reducing the thermal conductivity of the\nbase membrane. The results indicate that the thermal conductivity reduction\nincreases as the ratio of the volumetric size of a unit nanopillar to that of\nthe base membrane is increased, and the intensity of this reduction varies with\nunit-cell size at a rate dependent on the volumetric ratio. Considering sample\nsize, the resonance-induced thermal conductivity drop is shown to increase\nslightly with the number of unit cells until it would eventually level off.\n", "  We calculate the energy gap (latent heat) and pressure gap between the hot\nand cold phases of the SU(3) gauge theory at the first order deconfining phase\ntransition point. We perform simulations around the phase transition point with\nthe lattice size in the temporal direction Nt=6, 8 and 12 and extrapolate the\nresults to the continuum limit. We also investigate the spatial volume\ndependence. The energy density and pressure are evaluated by the derivative\nmethod with non-perturabative anisotropy coefficients. We adopt a multi-point\nreweighting method to determine the anisotropy coefficients. We confirm that\nthe anisotropy coefficients approach the perturbative values as Nt increases.\nWe find that the pressure gap vanishes at all values of Nt when the\nnon-perturbative anisotropy coefficients are used. The spatial volume\ndependence in the latent heat is found to be small on large lattices.\nPerforming extrapolation to the continuum limit, we obtain $ \\Delta\n\\epsilon/T^4 = 0.75 \\pm 0.17 $ and $ \\Delta (\\epsilon -3 p)/T^4 = 0.623 \\pm\n0.056.$\n", "  The formation mechanism of brown dwarfs (BDs) is one of the long-standing\nproblems in star formation because the typical Jeans mass in molecular clouds\nis too large to form these substellar objects. To answer this question, it is\ncrucial to study a BD at the embedded phase. IRAS 16253-2429 is classified as a\nvery low luminosity object (VeLLO) with internal luminosity 0.1 Lsun. VeLLOs\nare believed to be very low-mass protostars or even proto-BDs. We observed the\njet/outflow driven by IRAS 16253-2429 in CO (2-1), (6-5), and (7-6) using the\nIRAM 30 m and APEX telescopes and the SMA in order to study its dynamical\nfeatures and physical properties. Our SMA map reveals two protostellar jets,\nindicating the existence of a proto-binary system as implied by the precessing\njet detected in H2 emission. We detect a wiggling pattern in the\nposition-velocity diagrams along the jet axes, which is likely due to the\nbinary orbital motion. Based on this, we derive the current mass of the binary\nas ~0.032 Msun. Given the low envelope mass, IRAS 16253-2429 will form a binary\nthat probably consist of one or two BDs. Furthermore, we found that the outflow\nforce as well as the mass accretion rate are very low based on the\nmulti-transition CO observations, which suggests that the final masses of the\nbinary components are at the stellar/substellar boundary. Since IRAS 16253 is\nlocated in an isolated environment, we suggest that BDs can form through\nfragmentation and collapse like low-mass stars.\n", "  We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the\n1987A-like supernova (SN) 2009mw. Our $BVRI$ and $g'r'i'z'$ photometry covers\n167 days of evolution, including the rise to the light curve maximum, and ends\njust after the beginning of the linear tail phase. We compare the observational\nproperties of SN 2009mw with those of other SNe belonging to the same subgroup,\nand find that it shows similarities to several objects. The physical parameters\nof the progenitor and the SN are estimated via hydrodynamical modelling,\nyielding an explosion energy of $1$ foe, a pre-SN mass of $19\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$, a progenitor radius as $30\\,{\\rm R_{\\odot}}$ and a $^{56}$Ni mass\nas $0.062\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. These values indicate that the progenitor of SN\n2009mw was a blue supergiant star, similar to the progenitor of SN 1987A. We\nexamine the host environment of SN 2009mw and find that it emerged from a\npopulation with slightly sub-solar metallicty.\n", "  We study the cluster environment for a sample of 21 radio loud AGN from the\n3CR catalog at z>1, 12 radio galaxies and 9 quasars with HST images in the\noptical and IR. We use two different approaches to determine cluster\ncandidates. We identify the early type galaxies (ETGs) in every field by\nmodeling each of the sources within a 40\" radius of the targets with a Sersic\nprofile. Using a simple passive evolution model, we derive the expected\nlocation of the ETGs on the red sequence (RS) in the color-magnitude diagram\nfor each of the fields of our sources. For seven targets, the model coincides\nwith the position of the ETGs. A second approach involves a search for over\ndensities. We compare the object densities of the sample as a whole and\nindividually against control fields taken from the GOODS-S region of 3D-HST\nsurvey. With this method we determine the fields of 10 targets to be cluster\ncandidates. Four cluster candidates are found by both methods. The two methods\ndisagree in some cases, depending on the specific properties of each field. For\nthe most distant radio galaxy in the 3CR catalog (3C257 at z = 2.47), we\nidentify a population of bluer ETGs that lie on the expected location of the RS\nmodel for that redshift. This appears to be the general behavior of ETGs in our\nfields and it is possibly a signature of the evolution of such galaxies. Our\nresults are consistent with half of the z > 1 radio galaxies being located in\ndense, rapidly evolving environments.\n", "  The recently developed code for N-body/hydrodynamics simulations in Modified\nNewtonian Dynamics (MOND), known as RAyMOND, is used to investigate the\nconsequences of MOND on structure formation in a cosmological context, with a\nparticular focus on the velocity field. This preliminary study investigates the\nresults obtained with the two formulations of MOND implemented in RAyMOND, as\nwell as considering the effects of changing the choice of MOND interpolation\nfunction, and the cosmological evolution of the MOND acceleration scale. The\nsimulations are contrived such that structure forms in a background cosmology\nthat is similar to $\\Lambda$CDM, but with a significantly lower matter content.\nGiven this, and the fact that a fully consistent MOND cosmology is still\nlacking, we compare our results with a standard $\\Lambda$CDM simulation, rather\nthan observations. As well as demonstrating the effectiveness of using RAyMOND\nfor cosmological simulations, it is shown that a significant enhancement of the\nvelocity field is likely an unavoidable consequence of the gravitational\nmodification implemented in MOND, and may represent a clear observational\nsignature of such a modification. It is further suggested that such a signal\nmay be clearest in intermediate density regions such as cluster outskirts and\nfilaments.\n", "  We present a detailed X-ray variability study of the low mass Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) NGC 7314 using the two newly obtained XMM-Newton observations\n($140$ and $130$ ks), together with two archival data sets of shorter duration\n($45$ and $84$ ks). The relationship between the X-ray variability\ncharacteristics and other physical source properties (such as the black hole\nmass) are still relatively poorly defined, especially for low-mass AGN. We\nperform a new, fully analytical, power spectral density (PSD) model analysis\nmethod, which will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper, that takes\ninto consideration the spectral distortions, caused by red-noise leak. We find\nthat the PSD in the $0.5-10$ keV energy range, can be represented by a bending\npower-law with a bend around $6.7\\times10^{-5}$ Hz, having a slope of $0.51$\nand $1.99$ below and above the bend, respectively. Adding our bend time-scale\nestimate, to an already published ensemble of estimates from several AGN,\nsupports the idea that the bend time-scale depends linearly only on the black\nhole mass and not on the bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find that as the\nenergy range increases, the PSD normalization increases and there is a hint\nthat simultaneously the high frequency slope becomes steeper. Finally, the\nX-ray time-lag spectrum of NGC 7314 shows some very weak signatures of\nrelativistic reflection, and the energy resolved time-lag spectrum, for\nfrequencies around $3\\times10^{-4}$ Hz, shows no signatures of X-ray\nreverberation. We show that the previous claim about ks time-delays in this\nsource, is simply an artefact induced by the minuscule number of points\nentering during the time-lag estimation in the low frequency part of the\ntime-lag spectrum (i.e. below $10^{-4}$ Hz).\n", "  We present new rest frame UV and visible observations of 22 high-redshift (1\n< z < 2.5) 3C radio galaxies and QSOs obtained with the Hubble Space\nTelescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. Using a custom data\nreduction strategy in order to assure the removal of cosmic rays, persistence\nsignal, and other data artifacts, we have produced high-quality science-ready\nimages of the targets and their local environments. We observe targets with\nregions of UV emission suggestive of active star formation. In addition,\nseveral targets exhibit highly distorted host galaxy morphologies in the rest\nframe visible images. Photometric analyses reveals that brighter QSOs tend to\nbe generally redder than their dimmer counterparts. Using emission line fluxes\nfrom the literature, we estimate that emission line contamination is relatively\nsmall in the rest frame UV images for the QSOs. Using archival VLA data, we\nhave also created radio map overlays for each of our targets, allowing for\nanalysis of the optical and radio axes alignment.\n", "  We consider a simplified model in which Majorana fermion dark matter\nannihilates to charged fermions through exchange of charged mediators. We\nconsider the gamma-ray signals arising from the processes $XX \\rightarrow \\bar\nf f \\gamma$, $\\gamma \\gamma$, and $\\gamma Z$ in the most general case,\nincluding non-trivial fermion mass and non-trivial left-right mixing and\n$CP$-violating phase for the charged mediators. In particular, we find the most\ngeneral spectrum for internal bremsstrahlung, which interpolates between the\nregimes dominated by virtual internal bremsstrahlung and by final state\nradiation. We also examine the variation in the ratio $\\sigma(\\gamma \\gamma) /\n\\sigma (\\gamma Z)$ and the helicity asymmetry in the $XX \\rightarrow \\gamma\n\\gamma$ process, each as a function of mixing angle and $CP$-violating phase.\nAs an application, we apply these results to searches for a class of MSSM\nmodels.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss two features of the noncommmutative geometry and\nspectral action approach to the Standard Model: the fact that the model is\ninherently Euclidean, and that it requires a quadrupling of the fermionic\ndegrees of freedom. We show how the two issues are intimately related. We give\na precise prescription for the Wick rotation from the Euclidean theory to the\nLorentzian one, eliminating the extra degrees of freedom. This requires not\nonly projecting out mirror fermions, as has been done so far, and which leads\nto the correct Pfaffian, but also the elimination of the remaining extra\ndegrees of freedom. The remaining doubling has to be removed in order to\nrecover the correct Fock space of the physical (Lorentzian) theory. In order to\nget a Spin(1,3) invariant Lorentzian theory from a Spin(4) invariant Euclidean\ntheory such an elimination must be performed after the Wick rotation.\nDifferences between the Euclidean and Lorentzian case are described in detail,\nin a pedagogical way.\n", "  We present the abundance analysis for a sample of 18 red giant branch stars\nin the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 4147 based on medium and high resolution\nspectra. This is the first extensive spectroscopic study of this cluster. We\nderive abundances of C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, Ba, and\nEu. We find a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.84+-0.02 and an alpha-enhancement of\n+0.38+-0.05 (errors on the mean), typical of halo globular clusters in this\nmetallicity regime. A significant spread is observed in the abundances of light\nelements C, N, O, Na, and Al. In particular we found a Na-O anti-correlation\nand Na-Al correlation. The cluster contains only 15% of stars that belong to\nthe first generation (Na-poor and O-rich). This implies that it suffered a\nsevere mass loss during its lifetime. Its [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] mean values agree\nbetter with the Galactic Halo trend than with the trend of extragalactic\nenvironments at the cluster metallicity. This possibly suggests that NGC 4147\nis a genuine Galactic object at odd with what claimed by some author that\nproposed the cluster to be member of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. A\nanti-relation between the light s-process element Y and Na may also be present.\n", "  Production of electron-positron pairs in the collision of a high-energy\nphoton with a high-intensity few-cycle laser pulse is studied. By utilizing the\nframeworks of laser-dressed spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, a\ncomparison between the production of pairs of Dirac and Klein-Gordon particles\nis drawn. Positron energy spectra and angular distributions are presented for\nvarious laser parameters. We identify conditions under which predictions from\nKlein-Gordon theory either closely resemble or largely differ from those of the\nproper Dirac theory. In particular, we address the question to which extent the\nrelevance of spin effects is influenced by the short duration of the laser\npulse.\n", "  This paper aims at providing aperture corrections for emission lines in a\nsample of spiral galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey\n(CALIFA) database. In particular, we explore the behavior of the\nlog([OIII]5007/Hbeta)/([NII]6583/Halpha) (O3N2) and log[NII]6583/Halpha (N2)\nflux ratios since they are closely connected to different empirical\ncalibrations of the oxygen abundances in star forming galaxies.\n  We compute median growth curves of Halpha, Halpha/Hbeta, O3N2 and N2 up to\n2.5R_50 and 1.5 disk R_eff. The growth curves simulate the effect of observing\ngalaxies through apertures of varying radii. The median growth curve of the\nHalpha/Hbeta ratio monotonically decreases from the center towards larger\nradii, showing for small apertures a maximum value of ~10% larger than the\nintegrated one. The median growth curve of N2 shows a similar behavior,\ndecreasing from the center towards larger radii. No strong dependence is seen\nwith the inclination, morphological type and stellar mass for these growth\ncurves. Finally, the median growth curve of O3N2 increases monotonically with\nradius. However, at small radii it shows systematically higher values for\ngalaxies of earlier morphological types and for high stellar mass galaxies.\n  Applying our aperture corrections to a sample of galaxies from the SDSS\nsurvey at 0.02<=z<=0.3 shows that the average difference between fiber-based\nand aperture corrected oxygen abundances, for different galaxy stellar mass and\nredshift ranges, reaches typically to ~11%, depending on the abundance\ncalibration used. This average difference is found to be systematically biased,\nthough still within the typical uncertainties of oxygen abundances derived from\nempirical calibrations. Caution must be exercised when using observations of\ngalaxies for small radii (e.g. below 0.5R_eff) given the high dispersion shown\naround the median growth curves.\n", "  During the last decades, much effort has been devoted to explain the\ndiscrepancy between the amount of intracluster medium (ICM) estimated from\nstellar evolution theories and that emerging from observations in globular\nclusters (GCs). One possible scenario is the accretion of this medium by an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) at the centre of the cluster. In this work,\nwe aim at modelling the cluster colour-excess profile as a tracer of the ICM\ndensity, both with and without an IMBH. Comparing the profiles with\nobservations allows us to test the existence of IMBHs and their possible role\nin the cleansing of the ICM. We derive the intracluster density profiles from\nhydrodynamical models of accretion onto a central IMBH in a GC and we determine\nthe corresponding dust density. This model is applied to a list of 25 Galactic\nGCs. We find that central IMBHs decrease the ICM by several orders of\nmagnitude. In a subset of 9 clusters, the absence of the black hole combined\nwith a low intracluster medium temperature would be at odds with present gas\nmass content estimations. As a result, we conclude that IMBHs are an effective\ncleansing mechanism of the ICM of GCs. We construct synthetic extinction maps\nfor M 62 and {\\omega} Cen, two clusters in the small subset of 9 with observed\n2D extinction maps. We find that under reasonable assumptions regarding the\nmodel parameters, if the gas temperature in M 62 is close to 8000 K, an IMBH\nneeds to be invoked. Further ICM observations regarding both the gas and dust\nin GCs could help to settle this issue.\n", "  We present a high-precision proper motion study of 873 X-ray and\nspectroscopically selected stars in the massive OB association Cygnus OB2 as\npart of the DANCe project. These were calculated from images spanning a 15 year\nbaseline and have typical precisions < 1 mas/yr. We calculate the velocity\ndispersion in the two axes to be $\\sigma_\\alpha(c) = 13.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and\n$\\sigma_\\delta(c) = 9.1^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ km/s, using a 2-component, 2-dimensional\nmodel that takes into account the uncertainties on the measurements. This gives\na 3-dimensional velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_{3D} = 17.8 \\pm 0.6$ km/s\nimplying a virial mass significantly larger than the observed stellar mass,\nconfirming that the association is gravitationally unbound. The association\nappears to be dynamically unevolved, as evidenced by considerable kinematic\nsubstructure, non-isotropic velocity dispersions and a lack of energy\nequipartition. The proper motions show no evidence for a global expansion\npattern, with approximately the same amount of kinetic energy in expansion as\nthere is in contraction, which argues against the association being an expanded\nstar cluster disrupted by process such as residual gas expulsion or tidal\nheating. The kinematic substructures, which appear to be close to virial\nequilibrium and have typical masses of 40-400 M$_\\odot$, also do not appear to\nhave been affected by the expulsion of the residual gas. We conclude that Cyg\nOB2 was most likely born highly substructured and globally unbound, with the\nindividual subgroups born in (or close to) virial equilibrium, and that the OB\nassociation has not experienced significant dynamical evolution since then.\n", "  Due to its youth, proximity and richness the Orion Nebula Cloud (ONC) is an\nideal testbed to obtain a comprehensive view on the Initial Mass Function (IMF)\ndown to the planetary mass regime. Using the HAWK-I camera at the VLT, we have\nobtained an unprecedented deep and wide near-infrared JHK mosaic of the ONC\n(90% completeness at K~19.0mag, 22'x28). Applying the most recent isochrones\nand accounting for the contamination of background stars and galaxies, we find\nthat ONC's IMF is bimodal with distinct peaks at about 0.25 and 0.025 M_sun\nseparated by a pronounced dip at the hydrogen burning limit (0.08 M_sun), with\na depth of about a factor 2-3 below the log-normal distribution. Apart from\n~920 low-mass stars (M < 1.4 M_sun) the IMF contains ~760 brown dwarf (BD)\ncandidates and ~160 isolated planetary mass object (IPMO) candidates with M >\n0.005 M_sun, hence about ten times more substellar candidates than known\nbefore. The substellar IMF peak at 0.025 M_sun could be caused by BDs and IPMOs\nwhich have been ejected from multiple systems during the early star-formation\nprocess or from circumstellar disks.\n", "  We present a novel approach to draw the synthetic color-magnitude diagram of\ngalaxies, which can provide - in principle - a deeper insight in the\ninterpretation and understanding of current observations. In particular, we\n`light up' the stars of chemical evolution models, according to their initial\nmass, metallicity and age, to eventually understand how the assumed underlying\ngalaxy formation and evolution scenario affects the final configuration of the\nsynthetic CMD. In this way, we obtain a new set of observational constraints\nfor chemical evolution models beyond the usual photospheric chemical\nabundances. The strength of our method resides in the very fine grid of\nmetallicities and ages of the assumed database of stellar isochrones. In this\nwork, we apply our photo-chemical model to reproduce the observed CMD of the\nSculptor dSph and find that we can reproduce the main features of the observed\nCMD. The main discrepancies are found at fainter magnitudes in the main\nsequence turn-off and sub-giant branch, where the observed CMD extends towards\nbluer colors than the synthetic one; we suggest that this is a signature of\nmetal-poor stellar populations in the data, which cannot be captured by our\nassumed one-zone chemical evolution model.\n", "  We present NuSTAR hard X-ray observations of Sh 2-104, a compact HII region\ncontaining several young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs). We have detected\ndistinct hard X-ray sources coincident with localized VERITAS TeV emission\nrecently resolved from the giant gamma-ray complex MGRO J2019+37 in the Cygnus\nregion. Faint, diffuse X-ray emission coincident with the eastern YMSC in\nSh2-104 is likely the result of colliding winds of component stars. Just\noutside the radio shell of Sh 2-104 lies 3XMM J201744.7+365045 and a nearby\nnebula NuSTAR J201744.3+364812, whose properties are most consistent with\nextragalactic objects. The combined XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum of 3XMM\nJ201744.7+365045 is well-fit to an absorbed power-law model with NH = (3.1 +/-\n1.0)E22 cm^-2 and photon index Gamma = 2.1 +/- 0.1. Based on possible long-term\nflux variation and the lack of detected pulsations (< 43% modulation), this\nobject is likely a background AGN rather than a Galactic pulsar. The spectrum\nof the NuSTAR nebula shows evidence of an emission line at E = 5.6 keV\nsuggesting an optically obscured galaxy cluster at z = 0.19 +/- 0.02 (d = 800\nMpc) and Lx = 1.2E44 erg/s. Follow-up Chandra observations of Sh 2-104 will\nhelp identify the nature of the X-ray sources and their relation to MGRO\nJ2019+37. We also show that the putative VERITAS gamma-ray excess south of Sh\n2-104 is most likely associated with the newly discovered Fermi pulsar PSR\nJ2017+3625 and not the HII region.\n", "  We present the effective temperatures ($T_{\\rm eff}$), metallicities, and\ncolours in SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE filters, of a sample of 3834 late-K and\nearly-M dwarfs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey APOGEE spectroscopic\nsurvey ASPCAP catalog. We confirm that ASPCAP $T_{\\rm eff}$ values between 3550\nK$<T_{\\rm eff}<$4200 K are accurate to $\\sim$100 K compared to interferometric\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ values. In that same $T_{\\rm eff}$ range, ASPCAP metallicities\nare accurate to 0.18 dex between $-1.0<$[M/H]$<0.2$. For these cool dwarfs,\nnearly every colour is sensitive to both $T_{\\rm eff}$ and metallicity.\nNotably, we find that $g-r$ is not a good indicator of metallicity for\nnear-solar metallicity early-M dwarfs. We confirm that $J-K_S$ colour is\nstrongly dependent on metallicity, and find that $W1-W2$ colour is a promising\nmetallicity indicator. Comparison of the late-K and early-M dwarf colours,\nmetallicities, and $T_{\\rm eff}$ to those from three different model grids\nshows reasonable agreement in $r-z$ and $J-K_S$ colours, but poor agreement in\n$u-g$, $g-r$, and $W1-W2$. Comparison of the metallicities of the KM dwarf\nsample to those from previous colour-metallicity relations reveals a lack of\nconsensus in photometric metallicity indicators for late-K and early-M dwarfs.\nWe also present empirical relations for $T_{\\rm eff}$ as a function of $r-z$\ncolour combined with either [M/H] or $W1-W2$ colour, and for [M/H] as a\nfunction of $r-z$ and $W1-W2$ colour. These relations yield $T_{\\rm eff}$ to\n$\\sim$100 K and [M/H] to $\\sim$0.18 dex precision with colours alone, for\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ in the range of 3550-4200 K and [M/H] in the range of $-$0.5-0.2.\n", "  The Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability is a rotational instability\nthat is thought to contribute to the transfer of angular momentum in\ndifferentially rotating stars. It has been included in recent codes of stellar\nevolution in a diffusion-like approximation, under the assumption that the\nkinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is unimportant for the development of the\ninstability. As noted previously by other authors, for most stellar\napplications this may not be a valid approximation. We discuss this issue in\ndetail, solving the dispersion relation of the perturbed modes for realistic\nvalues of $\\nu$ in the bulk of the radiative zone of the Sun and of three red\ngiant stars at various evolutionary stages. We find that the GSF instability is\ntriggered only in layers of extremely strong shear. In a simple case study, we\nalso investigate the effect of a small deviation from axisymmetry or a small\nbackground magnetic field. We find that, like the viscosity, these have a\nstabilising effect. We conclude that this instability is probably far less\nefficient in transporting angular momentum than is often assumed, and may not\neven be present.\n", "  The spin axis of a rotationally deformed planet is forced to precess about\nits orbital angular momentum vector, due to the tidal gravity of its host star,\nif these directions are misaligned. This induces internal fluid motions inside\nthe planet that are subject to a hydrodynamic instability. We study the\nturbulent damping of precessional fluid motions, as a result of this\ninstability, in the simplest local computational model of a giant planet (or\nstar), with and without a weak internal magnetic field. Our aim is to determine\nthe outcome of this instability, and its importance in driving tidal evolution\nof the spin-orbit angle in precessing planets (and stars). We find that this\ninstability produces turbulent dissipation that is sufficiently strong that it\ncould drive significant tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle for hot\nJupiters with orbital periods shorter than about 10-18 days. If this mechanism\nacts in isolation, this evolution would be towards alignment or anti-alignment,\ndepending on the initial angle, but the ultimate evolution (if other tidal\nmechanisms also contribute) is expected to be towards alignment. The turbulent\ndissipation is proportional to the cube of the precession frequency, so it\nleads to much slower damping of stellar spin-orbit angles, implying that this\ninstability is unlikely to drive evolution of the spin-orbit angle in stars\n(either in planetary or close binary systems). We also find that the\ninstability-driven flow can act as a system-scale dynamo, which may play a role\nin producing magnetic fields in short-period planets.\n", "  We examine a model for the variable free-free and neutral hydrogen absorption\ninferred towards the cores of some compact radio galaxies in which a spatially\nfluctuating medium drifts in front of the source. We relate the\nabsorption-induced intensity fluctuations to the statistics of the underlying\nopacity fluctuations. We investigate models in which the absorbing medium\nconsists of either discrete clouds or a power-law spectrum of opacity\nfluctuations. We examine the variability characteristics of a medium comprised\nof Gaussian-shaped clouds in which the neutral and ionized matter are\nco-located, and in which the clouds comprise spherical constant-density neutral\ncores enveloped by ionized sheaths. The cross-power spectrum indicates the\nspatial relationship between neutral and ionized matter, and distinguishes the\ntwo models, with power in the Gaussian model declining as a featureless\npower-law, but that in the ionized sheath model oscillating between positive\nand negative values. We show how comparison of the HI and free-free power\nspectra reveals information on the ionization and neutral fractions of the\nmedium. The background source acts as a low-pass filter of the underlying\nopacity power spectrum, which limits temporal fluctuations to frequencies\n$\\omega < \\dot{\\theta}_v / \\theta_{\\rm src}$, where $\\dot{\\theta}_v$ is the\nangular drift speed of the matter in front of the source, and it quenches the\nobservability of opacity structures on scales smaller than the source size\n$\\theta_{\\rm src}$. For drift speeds of $\\sim 10^3\\,$km s$^{-1}$ and source\nbrightness temperatures $\\sim 10^{12}\\,$K, this limitation confines temporal\nopacity fluctuations to timescales of order several months to decades.\n", "  Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs by high energy radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object is currently the favourite model to explain the\nsudden dispersal of discs from the inside out. While several theoretical works\nhave provided a detailed pictured of this process, the direct observational\nvalidation is still lacking. Emission lines produced in these slow moving\nprotoplanetary disc winds may bear the imprint of the wind structure and thus\nprovide a potential diagnostic of the underlying dispersal process. In this\npaper we primarily focus on the collisionally excited neutral oxygen line at\n6300A. We compare our models predictions to observational data and demonstrate\na thermal origin for the observed blueshifted low-velocity component of this\nline from protoplanetary discs. Furthermore our models show that while this\nline is a clear tell-tale-sign of a warm, quasi-neutral disc wind, typical of\nX-ray photoevaporation, its strong temperature dependence makes it unsuitable\nto measure detailed wind quantities like mass-loss-rate.\n", "  Solar activity undergoes a variation over time scales of several months known\nas Rieger-type periodicity, which usually occurs near maxima of sunspot cycles.\nAn early analysis showed that the periodicity appears only in some cycles, and\nis absent in other cycles. But the appearance/absence during different cycles\nhas not been explained. We performed a wavelet analysis of sunspot data from\nthe Greenwich Royal Observatory and the Royal Observatory of Belgium during\ncycles 14-24. We found that the Rieger-type periods occur in all cycles, but\nthey are cycle-dependent: shorter periods occur during stronger cycles. Our\nanalysis revealed a periodicity of 185-195 days during the weak cycles 14-15\nand 24, and a periodicity of 155-165 days during the stronger cycles 16-23. We\nderived the dispersion relation of the spherical harmonics of the magnetic\nRossby waves in the presence of differential rotation and a toroidal magnetic\nfield in the dynamo layer near the base of the convection zone. This showed\nthat the harmonic of fast Rossby waves with m=1 and n=4, where m (n) indicate\nthe toroidal (poloidal) wavenumbers, respectively, perfectly fit with the\nobserved periodicity. The variation of the toroidal field strength from weaker\nto stronger cycles may lead to the different periods found in those cycles,\nwhich explains the observed enigmatic feature of the Rieger-type periodicity.\nFinally, we used the observed periodicity to estimate the dynamo field strength\nduring cycles 14-24. Our estimations suggest a field strength of 40 kG for the\nstronger cycles, and 20 kG for the weaker cycles.\n", "  We investigate the redshift evolution of the [OIII]/Hb nebular emission line\nratio for a sample of galaxies spanning the redshift range 0 < z < 4. We\ncompare the observed evolution to a set of theoretical models which account for\nthe independent evolution of chemical abundance, ionization parameter and\ninterstellar-medium (ISM) pressure in star-forming galaxies with redshift.\nAccounting for selection effects in the combined datasets, we show that the\nevolution to higher [OIII]/Hb ratios with redshift is a real physical effect\nwhich is best accounted for by a model in which the ionization parameter is\nelevated from the average values typical of local star-forming galaxies, with a\npossible simultaneous increase in the ISM pressure. We rule out the possibility\nthat the observed [OIII]/Hb evolution is purely due to metallicity evolution.\nWe discuss the implications of these results for using local empirical\nmetallicity calibrations to measure metallicities at high redshift, and briefly\ndiscuss possible theoretical implications of our results.\n", "  We present high-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI\nobservations and deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) optical imaging of\ntwo galaxy groups: NGC 4725/47 and NGC 3166/9. These data are part of a\nmulti-wavelength unbiased survey of the gas-rich dwarf galaxy populations in\nthree nearby interacting galaxy groups. The NGC 4725/47 group hosts two tidal\nknots and one dIrr. Both tidal knots are located within a prominent HI tidal\ntail, appear to have sufficient mass (M_gas~10^8 M_sol) to evolve into\nlong-lived tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) and are fairly young in age. The NGC\n3166/9 group contains a TDG candidate, AGC 208457, at least three dIrrs and\nfour HI knots. Deep CFHT imaging confirms that the optical component of AGC\n208457 is bluer -- with a 0.28 mag g-r colour -- and a few Gyr younger than its\npurported parent galaxies. Combining the results for these groups with those\nfrom the NGC 871/6/7 group reported earlier, we find that the HI properties,\nestimated stellar ages and baryonic content of the gas-rich dwarfs clearly\ndistinguish tidal features from their classical counterparts. We optimistically\nidentify four potentially long-lived tidal objects associated to three separate\npairs of interacting galaxies, implying that TDGs are not readily produced\nduring interaction events as suggested by some recent simulations. The tidal\nobjects examined in this survey also appear to have a wider variety of\nproperties than TDGs of similar mass formed in current simulations of\ninteracting galaxies, which could be the result of pre- or post-formation\nenvironmental influences.\n", "  Using the eight time dependences for the decays Upsilon(4S)-> B0 B0bar -> fj\nfk with the dacay into a flavor-specific state fj = ell+- X before or after the\ndecay into a CP eigenstate fk = c cbar KS,KL, as measured by the BABAR\nexperiment, we determine the three CPT-sensitive parameters Re(z) and Im(z) in\nB0-B0bar mixing and |Abar/A| in B0 -> c cbar K0 decays. We find Im(z) = 0.010\n+- 0.030 +- 0.013, Re(z) = -0.065 +- 0.028 +- 0.014, and |Abar/A| = 0.999 +-\n0.023 +- 0.017, in agreement with CPT symmetry.\n", "  Acoustic and magnetoacoustic waves are among the possible candidate\nmechanisms that heat the upper layers of solar atmosphere. A weak chromospheric\nplage near a large solar pore NOAA 11005 was observed on October 15, 2008 in\nthe lines Fe I 617.3 nm and Ca II 853.2 nm with the Interferometric\nBidimemsional Spectrometer (IBIS) attached to the Dunn Solar Telescope.\nAnalyzing the Ca II observations with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0.4\"\nand 52 s, the energy deposited by acoustic waves is compared with that released\nby radiative losses. The deposited acoustic flux is estimated from power\nspectra of Doppler oscillations measured in the Ca II line core. The radiative\nlosses are calculated using a grid of seven 1D hydrostatic semi-empirical model\natmospheres. The comparison shows that the spatial correlation of maps of\nradiative losses and acoustic flux is 72 %. In quiet chromosphere, the\ncontribution of acoustic energy flux to radiative losses is small, only of\nabout 15 %. In active areas with photospheric magnetic field strength between\n300 G and 1300 G and inclination of 20-60 degrees, the contribution increases\nfrom 23 % (chromospheric network) to 54 % (a plage). However, these values have\nto be considered as lower limits and it might be possible that the acoustic\nenergy flux is the main contributor to the heating of bright chromospheric\nnetwork and plages.\n", "  We observed the lenticular galaxy NGC 3998 with the Mitchell Integral-Field\nSpectrograph and extracted line-of-sight velocity distributions out to 3\nhalf-light radii. We constructed collisionless orbit models in order to\nconstrain NGC 3998's dark and visible structure, using kinematics from both the\nMitchell and SAURON instruments. We find NGC 3998 to be almost axisymmetric,\nseen nearly face on with a flattened intrinsic shape - i.e., a face-on\nfast-rotator. We find an I-band mass-to-light ratio of $4.7_{-0.45}^{+0.32}$ in\ngood agreement with previous spectral fitting results for this galaxy. Our\nbest-fit orbit model shows a both a bulge and a disc component, with a\nnon-negligible counter-rotating component also evident. We find that relatively\nlittle dark matter is needed to model this galaxy, with an inferred dark mass\nfraction of just $(7.1^{+8.1}_{-7.1})\\%$ within one half-light radius.\n", "  We present SCUBA-2 450{\\mu}m and 850{\\mu}m observations of the W40 complex in\nthe Serpens-Aquila region as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)\nGould Belt Survey (GBS) of nearby star-forming regions. We investigate\nradiative heating by constructing temperature maps from the ratio of SCUBA-2\nfluxes using a fixed dust opacity spectral index, {\\beta} = 1.8, and a beam\nconvolution kernel to achieve a common 14.8\" resolution. We identify 82 clumps\nranging between 10 and 36K with a mean temperature of 20{\\pm}3K. Clump\ntemperature is strongly correlated with proximity to the external OB\nassociation and there is no evidence that the embedded protostars significantly\nheat the dust. We identify 31 clumps that have cores with densities greater\nthan 105cm{^{-3}}. Thirteen of these cores contain embedded Class 0/I\nprotostars. Many cores are associated with bright-rimmed clouds seen in\nHerschel 70 {\\mu}m images. From JCMT HARP observations of the 12CO 3-2 line, we\nfind contamination of the 850{\\mu}m band of up to 20 per cent. We investigate\nthe free-free contribution to SCUBA-2 bands from large-scale and ultracompact H\nii regions using archival VLA data and find the contribution is limited to\nindividual stars, accounting for 9 per cent of flux per beam at 450 {\\mu}m or\n12 per cent at 850 {\\mu}m in these cases. We conclude that radiative heating\nhas potentially influenced the formation of stars in the Dust Arc sub-region,\nfavouring Jeans stable clouds in the warm east and fragmentation in the cool\nwest.\n", "  We probe the feasibility of describing the structure of a multi-component\naxisymmetric galaxy with a dynamical model based on the Jeans equations while\ntaking into account a third integral of motion. We demonstrate that using the\nthird integral in the form derived by G. Kuzmin, it is possible to calculate\nthe stellar kinematics of a galaxy from the Jeans equations by integrating the\nequations along certain characteristic curves. In cases where the third\nintegral of motion does not describe the system exactly, the derived kinematics\nwould describe the galaxy only approximately. We apply our method to the\nAndromeda galaxy, for which the mass distribution is relatively firmly known.\nWe are able to reproduce the observed stellar kinematics of the galaxy rather\nwell. The calculated model suggests that the velocity dispersion ratios\n${\\sigma}_z^2/{\\sigma}_R^2$ of M31 decrease with increasing R. Moving away from\nthe galactic plane, ${\\sigma}_z^2/{\\sigma}_R^2$ remains the same. The velocity\ndispersions ${\\sigma}_{\\theta}^2$ and ${\\sigma}_R^2$ are roughly equal in the\ngalactic plane.\n", "  We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV spectra of 4 QSOs whose sightlines\npass through the halo of NGC 1097 at impact parameters of 48 -165 kpc. NGC 1097\nis a nearby spiral galaxy that has undergone at least two minor merger events,\nbut no apparent major mergers, and is relatively isolated with respect to other\nnearby bright galaxies. This makes NGC 1097 a good case study for exploring\nbaryons in a paradigmatic bright-galaxy halo. Lyman-alpha absorption is\ndetected along all sightlines and Si III 1206 is found along the 3 smallest\nimpact parameter sightlines; metal lines of C II, Si II and Si IV are only\nfound with certainty towards the inner-most sightline. The kinematics of the\nabsorption lines are best replicated by a model with a disk-like distribution\nof gas approximately planar to the observed 21 cm H I disk, that is rotating\nmore slowly than the inner disk, and into which gas is infalling from the\nintergalactic medium. Some part of the absorption towards the inner-most\nsightline may arise either from a small-scale outflow, or from tidal debris\nassociated with the minor merger that gives rise to the well known `dog-leg'\nstellar stream that projects from NGC 1097. When compared to other studies, NGC\n1097 appears to be a `typical' absorber, although the large dispersion in\nabsorption line column density and equivalent width in a single halo goes\nperhaps some way in explaining the wide range of these values seen in\nhigher-redshift studies.\n", "  The substantial decrease in star formation density from z=1 to the present\nday is curious given the relatively constant neutral gas density over the same\nepoch. Future radio astronomy facilities, including the SKA and pathfinder\ntelescopes, will provide pioneering measures of both the gas content of\ngalaxies and star formation activity over cosmological timescales. Here we\ninvestigate the commensalities between neutral atomic gas (HI) and radio\ncontinuum observations, as well as the complementarity of the data products. We\nstart with the proposed HI and continuum surveys to be undertaken with the SKA\nprecursor telescope MeerKAT, and building on this, explore optimal combinations\nof survey area coverage and depth of proposed HI and continuum surveys to be\nundertaken with the SKA1-MID instrument. Intelligent adjustment of these\nobservational parameters results in a tiered strategy that minimises\nobservation time while maximising the value of the dataset, both for HI and\ncontinuum science goals. We also find great complementarity between the HI and\ncontinuum datasets, with the spectral line HI data providing redshift\nmeasurements for gas-rich, star-forming galaxies with stellar masses\nMstellar~10^9 Msun to z~0.3, a factor of three lower in stellar mass than would\nbe feasible to reach with large optical spectroscopic campaigns.\n", "  Using three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations of accretion flows around stellar mass black holes, we report that\nthe relatively cold disk ($\\gtrsim 10^{7}$K) is truncated near the black hole.\nHot and less-dense regions, of which the gas temperature is $ \\gtrsim 10^9$K\nand more than ten times higher than the radiation temperature (overheated\nregions), appear within the truncation radius. The overheated regions also\nappear above as well as below the disk, and sandwich the cold disk, leading to\nthe effective Compton upscattering. The truncation radius is $\\sim 30 r_{\\rm\ng}$ for $\\dot{M} \\sim L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$, where $r_{\\rm g}, \\dot M,\nL_\\mathrm{Edd}, c$ are the gravitational radius, mass accretion rate, Eddington\nluminosity, and light speed. Our results are consistent with observations of\nvery high state, whereby the truncated disk is thought to be embedded in the\nhot rarefied regions. The truncation radius shifts inward to $\\sim 10 r_{\\rm\ng}$ with increasing mass accretion rate $\\dot{M} \\sim 100 L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwhich is very close to an innermost stable circular orbit. This model\ncorresponds to the slim disk state observed in ultra luminous X-ray sources.\nAlthough the overheated regions shrink if the Compton cooling effectively\nreduces the gas temperature, the sandwich-structure does not disappear at the\nrange of $\\dot{M} \\lesssim 100L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$. Our simulations also reveal\nthat the gas temperature in the overheated regions depends on black hole spin,\nwhich would be due to efficient energy transport from black hole to disks\nthrough the Poynting flux, resulting gas heating.\n", "  The short-lived $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe radionuclides are synthesized and\nexpelled in the interstellar medium by core-collapse supernova events. The\nsolar system's first solids, calcium-aluminium refractory inclusions (CAIs),\ncontain evidence for the former presence of the $^{26}$ Al nuclide defining the\ncanonical $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$ Al ratio of $\\sim5 \\times10^{-5}$. A different\nclass of objects temporally related to canonical CAIs are CAIs with\nfractionation and unidentified nuclear effects (FUN CAIs), which record a low\ninitial $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al of $10^{-6}$. The contrasting level of $^{26}$Al\nbetween these objects is often interpreted as reflecting the admixing of the\n$^{26}$Al nuclide during the early formative phase of the Sun. We use giant\nmolecular cloud (GMC) scale adaptive mesh-refinement numerical simulations to\ntrace the abundance of $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe in star-forming gas during the\nearly stages of accretion of individual low mass protostars. We find that the\n$^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al and $^{60}$Fe/$^{56}$Fe ratios of accreting gas within a\nvicinity of 1000 AU of the stars follow the predicted decay curves of the\ninitial abundances at time of star formation without evidence of spatial or\ntemporal heterogeneities for the first 100 kyr of star formation. Therefore,\nthe observed differences in $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratios between FUN and\ncanonical CAIs are likely not caused by admixing of supernova material during\nthe early evolution of the proto-Sun. Selective thermal processing of dust\ngrains is a more viable scenario to account for the heterogeneity in\n$^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratios at the time of solar system formation.\n", "  Radio pulsar B1933+16 is brightest core-radiation dominated pulsar in the\nArecibo sky, and here we carry out a comprehensive high resolution polarimetric\nstudy of its radiation at both 1.5 and 4.6 GHz. At 1.5 GHz, the polarization is\nlargely compatible with a rotating-vector model with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nvalues of 125 and --1.2$^{\\circ}$, such that the core and conal regions can be\nidentified with the primary and secondary polarization modes and plausibly with\nthe extraordinary and ordinary propagation modes. Polarization modal\nsegregation of profiles shows that the core is comprised of two parts which we\nassociate with later X-mode and earlier O-mode emission. Analysis of the broad\nmicrostructures under the core shows that they have similar timescales to those\nof the largely conal radiation of other pulsars studied earlier.\nAberration/retardation analysis was here possible for both the conal and core\nradiation and showed average physical emission heights of about 200 km for\neach. Comparison with other core-cone pulsars suggests that the core and conal\nemission arises from similar heights. Assuming the inner vacuum gap model, we\nnote that at these emission altitudes the frequency of the observed radiation\n$\\nu_{obs}$ is less than the plasma frequency $\\nu_p$. We then conclude that\nthe radio emission properties are consistent with the theory of coherent\ncurvature radiation by charged solitons where the condition $\\nu_{obs} <\n\\nu_{p}$ is satisfied. However, the differences that exist between core and\nconal emission in their geometric locations within a pulse, polarization and\nmodulation properties are yet to be understood.\n", "  We use the large cosmological hydro-dynamic simulation BlueTides to predict\nthe photometric properties of galaxies during the epoch of reionisation\n($z=8-15$). These properties include the rest-frame UV to near-IR broadband\nspectral energy distributions, the Lyman continuum photon production, the UV\nstar formation rate calibration, and intrinsic UV continuum slope. In\nparticular we focus on exploring the effect of various modelling assumptions,\nincluding the assumed choice of stellar population synthesis model, initial\nmass function, and the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons, upon these\nquantities. We find that these modelling assumptions can have a dramatic effect\non photometric properties leading to consequences for the accurate\ndetermination of physical properties from observations. For example, at $z=8$\nwe predict that nebular emission can account for up-to $50\\%$ of the rest-frame\n$R$-band luminosity, while the choice of stellar population synthesis model can\nchange the Lyman continuum production rate up to a factor of $\\times 2$.\n", "  We construct a comprehensive model atom for TiI-II using more than 3600\nmeasured and predicted energy levels of TiI and 1800 energy levels of TiII, and\nquantum mechanical photoionisation cross-sections. Non-local thermodynamical\nequilibrium (NLTE) line formation for the two ions of titanium is treated\nthrough a wide range of spectral types from A to K, including metal-poor stars\nwith [Fe/H] down to -2.6 dex. NLTE leads to systematically depleted total\nabsorption in the TiI lines and to positive abundance corrections. The\nmagnitude of NLTE abundance corrections is smaller compared to the available\nliterature data for the cool (FGK type) atmospheres. NLTE leads to strengthened\nTiII lines and to negative NLTE abundance corrections. For the first time, we\nperformed the NLTE calculations for TiI-II in the 6500 K < Teff < 13000 K\nrange. The deviations from LTE grow towards higher effective temperature. For\nfour A type stars we derived the NLTE and LTE abundances from lines of TiI and\nTiII. In LTE an abundance discrepancy of up to 0.22 dex was obtained between\nTiI and TiII, and it vanishes in NLTE. For other four A-B stars, with only TiII\nlines observed, NLTE leads to smaller line-to-line scatter compared to LTE. An\nefficiency of inelastic TiI + HI collisions was empirically estimated from\nanalysis of TiI and TiII lines in 17 cool stars in a wide metallicity range\n-2.6 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. Consistent NLTE abundances from lines of TiI and TiII were\nobtained applying classical Drawinian rates for the stars with log g > 4.1, and\nneglecting inelastic collisions with HI for the VMP giant HD 122563. For the\nvery metal-poor turn-off stars ([Fe/H] < -2 and log g < 4.1), the abundance\ndifference TiI-TiII was obtained to be positive already in LTE and it increases\nin NLTE. The accurate collisional data for TiI and TiII are desired to find a\nclue to this problem.\n", "  We present results from deep, wide-field surface photometry of three nearby\n(D=4--7 Mpc) spiral galaxies: M94 (NGC 4736), M64 (NGC 4826), and M106 (NGC\n4258). Our imaging reaches limiting surface brightnesses of $\\mu_{B} \\sim$ 28\n-- 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and probes colors down to $\\mu_{B} \\sim$ 27.5 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$. We compare our broadband optical data to available ultraviolet\nand high column-density HI data to better constrain the star forming history\nand stellar populations of the outermost parts of each galaxy's disk. Each\ngalaxy has a well-defined radius beyond which little star formation occurs and\nthe disk light appears both azimuthally smooth and red in color, suggestive of\nold, well-mixed stellar populations. Given the lack of ongoing star formation\nor blue stellar populations in these galaxies' outer disks, the most likely\nmechanisms for their formation are dynamical processes such as disk heating or\nradial migration, rather than inside-out growth of the disks. This is also\nimplied by the similarity in outer disk properties despite each galaxy showing\ndistinct levels of environmental influence, from a purely isolated galaxy (M94)\nto one experiencing weak tidal perturbations from its satellite galaxies (M106)\nto a galaxy recovering from a recent merger (M64), suggesting that a variety of\nevolutionary histories can yield similar outer disk structure. While this\nsuggests a common secular mechanism for outer disk formation, the large extent\nof these smooth, red stellar populations---which reach several disk\nscalelengths beyond the galaxies' spiral structure---may challenge models of\nradial migration given the lack of any non-axisymmetric forcing at such large\nradii.\n", "  This paper presents an overview of the Fokker-Planck formalism for\nnon-biological magnetic resonance simulations, describes its existing\napplications and proposes some novel ones. The most attractive feature of\nFokker-Planck theory compared to the commonly used Liouville - von Neumann\nequation is that, for all relevant types of spatial dynamics (spinning,\ndiffusion, flow, etc.), the corresponding Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian is\ntime-independent. Many difficult NMR, EPR and MRI simulation problems (multiple\nrotation NMR, ultrafast NMR, gradient-based zero-quantum filters, diffusion and\nflow NMR, off-resonance soft microwave pulses in EPR, spin-spin coupling\neffects in MRI, etc.) are simplified significantly in Fokker-Planck space. The\npaper also summarises the author's experiences with writing and using the\ncorresponding modules of the Spinach library - the methods described below have\nenabled a large variety of simulations previously considered too complicated\nfor routine practical use.\n", "  We investigate the dependance of galaxy sizes and star-formation rates (SFRs)\non environment using a mass-limited sample of quiescent and star-forming\ngalaxies with M>10^9.5 at z=0.92 selected from the NMBS survey. Using the GEEC2\nspectroscopic cluster catalog and the accurate photometric redshifts from NMBS,\nwe select quiescent and star-forming cluster (sigma=490 km/s) galaxies within\ntwo virial radius, Rvir, intervals of 0.5<Rvir<2 and Rvir<0.5. Galaxies\nresiding outside of 2 Rvir of both the cluster centres and additional candidate\nover-densities are defined as our field sample. Galaxy structural parameters\nare measured from the COSMOS legacy HST/ACS F814W image. The sizes and Sersic\nindices of quiescent field and cluster galaxies have the same distribution\nregardless of Rvir. However, cluster star-forming galaxies within 0.5 Rvir have\nlower mass-normalised average sizes, by 16${\\pm}7\\%$, and a higher fraction of\nSersic indices with n>1, than field star-forming galaxies. The average SFRs of\nstar-forming cluster galaxies show a trend of decreasing SFR with clustocentric\nradius. The mass-normalised average SFR of cluster star-forming galaxies is a\nfactor of 2-2.5 (7-9 sigma) lower than that of star-forming galaxies in the\nfield. While we find no significant dependence on environment for quiescent\ngalaxies, the properties of star-forming galaxies are affected, which could be\nthe result of environment acting on their gas content.\n", "  We report the detection of an infrared selected transient which has lasted at\nleast 5 years, first identified by a large mid-infrared and optical outburst\nfrom a faint X-ray source detected with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In this\npaper we rule out several scenarios for the cause of this outburst, including a\nclassical nova, a luminous red nova, AGN flaring, a stellar merger, and\nintermediate luminosity optical transients, and interpret this transient as the\nresult of a Young Stellar Object (YSO) of at least solar mass accreting\nmaterial from the remains of the dusty envelope from which it formed, in\nisolation from either a dense complex of cold gas or massive star formation.\nThis object does not fit neatly into other existing categories of large\noutbursts of YSOs (FU Orionis types) which may be a result of the object's\nmass, age, and environment. It is also possible that this object is a new type\nof transient unrelated to YSOs.\n", "  We use ~100 cosmological galaxy formation zoom-in simulations using the\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code {\\sc gasoline} to study the effect of\nbaryonic processes on the mass profiles of cold dark matter haloes. The haloes\nin our study range from dwarf (M_{200}~10^{10}Msun) to Milky Way\n(M_{200}~10^{12}Msun) masses. Our simulations exhibit a wide range of halo\nresponses, primarily varying with mass, from expansion to contraction, with up\nto factor ~10 changes in the enclosed dark matter mass at one per cent of the\nvirial radius. Confirming previous studies, the halo response is correlated\nwith the integrated efficiency of star formation:\ne_SF=(M_{star}/M_{200})/(\\Omega_b/\\Omega_m). In addition we report a new\ncorrelation with the compactness of the stellar system: e_R=r_{1/2}/R_{200}. We\nprovide an analytic formula depending on e_SF and e_R for the response of cold\ndark matter haloes to baryonic processes. An observationally testable\nprediction is that, at fixed mass, larger galaxies experience more halo\nexpansion, while the smaller galaxies more halo contraction. This diversity of\ndark halo response is captured by a toy model consisting of cycles of adiabatic\ninflow (causing contraction) and impulsive gas outflow (causing expansion). For\nnet outflow, or equal inflow and outflow fractions, f, the overall effect is\nexpansion, with more expansion with larger f. For net inflow, contraction\noccurs for small f (large radii), while expansion occurs for large f (small\nradii), recovering the phenomenology seen in our simulations. These\nregularities in the galaxy formation process provide a step towards a fully\npredictive model for the structure of cold dark matter haloes.\n", "  We present constraints on the molecular outflows in a sample of five\nHyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies using Herschel observations of the OH doublet\nat 119 {\\mu}m. We have detected the OH doublet in three cases: one purely in\nemission and two purely in absorption. The observed emission profile has a\nsignificant blueshifted wing suggesting the possibility of tracing an outflow.\nOut of the two absorption profiles, one seems to be consistent with the\nsystemic velocity while the other clearly indicates the presence of a molecular\noutflow whose maximum velocity is about ~1500 km/s. Our analysis shows that\nthis system is in general agreement with previous results on Ultra-luminous\nInfrared Galaxies and QSOs, whose outflow velocities do not seem to correlate\nwith stellar masses or starburst luminosities (star formation rates). Instead\nthe galaxy outflow likely arises from an embedded AGN.\n", "  We have assembled a dataset of 165 low redshift, $z<$0.06, publicly available\ntype Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We produce maximum light magnitude ($M_{B}$ and\n$M_{V}$) distributions of SNe Ia to explore the diversity of parameter space\nthat they can fill. Before correction for host galaxy extinction we find that\nthe mean $M_{B}$ and $M_{V}$ of SNe Ia are $-18.58\\pm0.07$mag and\n$-18.72\\pm0.05$mag respectively. Host galaxy extinction is corrected using a\nnew method based on the SN spectrum. After correction, the mean values of\n$M_{B}$ and $M_{V}$ of SNe Ia are $-19.10\\pm0.06$ and $-19.10\\pm0.05$mag\nrespectively. After correction for host galaxy extinction, `normal' SNeIa\n($\\Delta m_{15}(B)<1.6$mag) fill a larger parameter space in the\nWidth-Luminosity Relation (WLR) than previously suggested, and there is\nevidence for luminous SNe Ia with large $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$. We find a bimodal\ndistribution in $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$, with a pronounced lack of transitional\nevents at $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$=1.6 mag. We confirm that faster, low-luminosity\nSNe tend to come from passive galaxies. Dividing the sample by host galaxy\ntype, SNe Ia from star-forming (S-F) galaxies have a mean $M_{B}=-19.20 \\pm\n0.05$ mag, while SNe Ia from passive galaxies have a mean $M_{B}=-18.57 \\pm\n0.24$ mag. Even excluding fast declining SNe, `normal' ($M_{B}<-18$ mag) SNe Ia\nfrom S-F and passive galaxies are distinct. In the $V$-band, there is a\ndifference of 0.4$ \\pm $0.13 mag between the median ($M_{V}$) values of the\n`normal' SN Ia population from passive and S-F galaxies. This is consistent\nwith ($\\sim 15 \\pm $10)% of `normal' SNe Ia from S-F galaxies coming from an\nold stellar population.\n", "  Due to significant galaxy contamination and impurity in stellar mass selected\nsamples (up to 95% from z=0-3), we examine the star formation history,\nquenching time-scales, and structural evolution of galaxies using a constant\nnumber density selection with data from the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey field.\nUsing this methodology we investigate the evolution of galaxies at a variety of\nnumber densities from $z=0-3$. We find that samples chosen at number densities\nranging from $3\\times10^{-4}$ to 10$^{-5}$ galaxies Mpc$^{-3}$ (corresponding\nto $z\\sim0.5$ stellar masses of M$_{*}= 10^{10.95-11.6}$ M$_{0}$) have a star\nforming blue fraction of $\\sim50$\\% at $z\\sim2.5$, which evolves to a nearly\n$100$\\% quenched red and dead population by $z\\sim 1$. We also see evidence for\nnumber density downsizing, such that the galaxies selected at the lowest\ndensities (highest masses) become a homogeneous red population before those at\nhigher number densities. Examining the evolution of the colours for these\nsystems furthermore shows that the formation redshift of galaxies selected at\nthese number densities is $z_{\\rm form}>3$. The structural evolution through\nsize and Sersic index fits reveal that while there remains evolution in terms\nof galaxies becoming larger and more concentrated in stellar mass at lower\nredshifts, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than for a mass\nselected sample. We also find that changes in size and structure continues at\n$z < 1$, and is coupled strongly to passivity evolution. We conclude that\ngalaxy structure is driving the quenching of galaxies, such that galaxies\nbecome concentrated before they become passive.\n", "  We investigate the evaporation of close-by pulsar companions, such as\nplanets, asteroids, and white dwarfs, by induction heating. Assuming that the\noutflow energy is dominated by a Poynting flux (or pulsar wave) at the location\nof the companions, we calculate their evaporation timescales, by applying the\nMie theory. Depending on the size of the companion compared to the incident\nelectromagnetic wavelength, the heating regime varies and can lead to a total\nevaporation of the companion. In particular, we find that inductive heating is\nmostly inefficient for small pulsar companions, although it is generally\nconsidered the dominant process. Small objects like asteroids can survive\ninduction heating for $10^4\\,$years at distances as small as $1\\,R_\\odot$ from\nthe neutron star. For degenerate companions, induction heating cannot lead to\nevaporation and another source of heating (likely by kinetic energy of the\npulsar wind) has to be considered. It was recently proposed that bodies\norbiting pulsars are the cause of fast radio bursts; the present results\nexplain how those bodies can survive in the pulsar's highly energetic\nenvironment.\n", "  We study mass distributions within and beyond 5~effective radii ($R_{\\rm e}$)\nin 23 early-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey, using their globular cluster\n(GC) kinematic data. The data are obtained with Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph, and\nconsist of line-of-sight velocities for ~$3500$ GCs, measured with a high\nprecision of ~15 $\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ per GC and extending out to $~13 R_{\\rm e}$.\nWe obtain the mass distribution in each galaxy using the tracer mass estimator\nof Watkins et al. and account for kinematic substructures, rotation of the GC\nsystems and galaxy flattening in our mass estimates.\n  The observed scatter between our mass estimates and results from the\nliterature is less than 0.2 dex. The dark matter fraction within $5R_{\\rm e}$\n($f_{\\rm DM}$) increases from ~$0.6$ to ~$0.8$ for low- and high-mass galaxies,\nrespectively, with some intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_*{\\sim}10^{11}M_\\odot$)\nhaving low $f_{\\rm DM}\\sim0.3$, which appears at odds with predictions from\nsimple galaxy models. We show that these results are independent of the adopted\norbital anisotropy, stellar mass-to-light ratio, and the assumed slope of the\ngravitational potential. However, the low $f_{\\rm DM}$ in the ~$10^{11}M_\\odot$\ngalaxies agrees with the cosmological simulations of Wu et al. where the\npristine dark matter distribution has been modified by baryons during the\ngalaxy assembly process. We find hints that these $M_*\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$\ngalaxies with low $f_{\\rm DM}$ have very diffuse dark matter haloes, implying\nthat they assembled late. Beyond $5R_{\\rm e}$, the $M/L$ gradients are steeper\nin the more massive galaxies and shallower in both low and intermediate mass\ngalaxies.\n", "  We perform zoom-in cosmological simulations of a suite of dwarf galaxies,\nexamining the impact of cosmic-rays generated by supernovae, including the\neffect of diffusion. We first look at the effect of varying the uncertain\ncosmic ray parameters by repeatedly simulating a single galaxy. Then we fix the\ncomic ray model and simulate five dwarf systems with virial masses range from\n8-30 $\\times 10^{10}$ Msun. We find that including cosmic ray feedback (with\ndiffusion) consistently leads to disk dominated systems with relatively flat\nrotation curves and constant star formation rates. In contrast, our purely\nthermal feedback case results in a hot stellar system and bursty star\nformation. The CR simulations very well match the observed baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation, but have a lower gas fraction than in real systems. We\nalso find that the dark matter cores of the CR feedback galaxies are cuspy,\nwhile the purely thermal feedback case results in a substantial core.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations of SN 2013ej, in galaxy M74, from 1 to 450 days after the\nexplosion. SN 2013ej is a hydrogen-rich supernova, classified as a Type IIL due\nto its relatively fast decline following the initial peak. It has a relatively\nhigh peak luminosity (absolute magnitude M$_\\rm{V}$ = -17.6) but a small\n$^{56}$Ni production of ~0.023 M$_\\odot$. Its photospheric evolution is similar\nto other Type II SNe, with shallow absorption in the H{\\alpha} profile typical\nfor a Type IIL. During transition to the radioactive decay tail at ~100 days,\nwe find the SN to grow bluer in B - V colour, in contrast to some other Type II\nsupernovae. At late times, the bolometric light curve declined faster than\nexpected from $^{56}$Co decay and we observed unusually broad and asymmetric\nnebular emission lines. Based on comparison of nebular emission lines most\nsensitive to the progenitor core mass, we find our observations are best\nmatched to synthesized spectral models with a M$_\\rm{ZAMS}$ = 12 - 15 M$_\\odot$\nprogenitor. The derived mass range is similar to but not higher than the mass\nestimated for Type IIP progenitors. This is against the idea that Type IIL are\nfrom more massive stars. Observations are consistent with the SN having a\nprogenitor with a relatively low-mass envelope.\n", "  We present two new examples of galaxies undergoing transformation in the\nShapley supercluster core. These low-mass (stellar mass from 0.4E10 to 1E10\nMsun) galaxies are members of the two clusters SC-1329-313 (z=0.045) and\nSC-1327-312 (z=0.049). Integral-field spectroscopy complemented by imaging in\nugriK bands and in Halpha narrow-band are used to disentangle the effects of\ntidal interaction (TI) and ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In both galaxies,\nSOS-61086 and SOS-90630, we observe one-sided extraplanar ionized gas extending\nrespectively 30kpc and 41kpc in projection from their disks. The galaxies'\ngaseous disks are truncated and the kinematics of the stellar and gas\ncomponents are decoupled, supporting the RPS scenario. The emission of the\nionized gas extends in the direction of a possible companion for both galaxies\nsuggesting a TI. The overall gas velocity field of SOS-61086 is reproduced by\nad hoc N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of RPS acting almost face-on and\nstarting about 250Myr ago, consistent with the age of the young stellar\npopulations. A link between the observed gas stripping and the cluster-cluster\ninteraction experienced by SC-1329-313 and A3562 is suggested. Simulations of\nram pressure acting almost edge-on are able to fully reproduce the gas velocity\nfield of SOS-90630, but cannot at the same time reproduce the extended tail of\noutflowing gas. This suggests that an additional disturbance from a TI is\nrequired. This study adds a piece of evidence that RPS may take place in\ndifferent environments with different impacts and witnesses the possible effect\nof cluster-cluster merger on RPS.\n", "  Fast reconnection operating in magnetically dominated plasmas is often\ninvoked in models for magnetar giant flares, for magnetic dissipation in pulsar\nwinds, or to explain the gamma-ray flares observed in the Crab nebula, hence\nits investigation is of paramount importance in high-energy astrophysics. Here\nwe study, by means of two dimensional numerical simulations, the linear phase\nand the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability within the\nframework of relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics, as appropriate in\nsituations where the Alfven velocity approaches the speed of light. It is found\nthat the linear phase of the instability closely matches the analysis in\nclassical MHD, where the growth rate scales with the Lundquist number S as\nS^-1/2, with the only exception of an enhanced inertial term due to the thermal\nand magnetic energy contributions. In addition, when thin current sheets of\ninverse aspect ratio scaling as S^-1/3 are considered, the so-called \"ideal\"\ntearing regime is retrieved, with modes growing independently on S and\nextremely fast, on only a few light crossing times of the sheet length. The\noverall growth of fluctuations is seen to solely depend on the value of the\nbackground Alfven velocity. In the fully nonlinear stage we observe an inverse\ncascade towards the fundamental mode, with Petschek-type supersonic jets\npropagating at the external Alfven speed from the X-point, and a fast\nreconnection rate at the predicted value R~(ln S)^-1.\n", "  A Linearized Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model coupled with hydrodynamical\nbackground is established to describe the evolution of jet shower partons and\nmedium excitations in high energy heavy-ion collisions. We extend the LBT model\nto include both elastic and inelastic processes for light and heavy partons in\nthe quark-gluon plasma. A hybrid model of fragmentation and coalescence is\ndeveloped for the hadronization of heavy quarks. Within this framework, we\ninvestigate how heavy flavor observables depend on various ingredients, such as\ndifferent energy loss and hadronization mechanisms, the momentum and\ntemperature dependences of the transport coefficients, and the radial flow of\nthe expanding fireball. Our model calculations show good descriptions of the\n$D$ meson suppression and elliptic flow observed at the LHC and RHIC. The\nprediction for the Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$=5.02~TeV is\nprovided.\n", "  We employ an asteroseismic model of L19-2, a relatively massive ($M_{\\star}\n\\sim 0.75 M_{\\sun}$) and hot ($T_{\\rm eff} \\sim 12\\,100$ K) pulsating DA\n(H-rich atmosphere) white dwarf star (DAV or ZZ Ceti variable), and use the\nobserved values of the temporal rates of period change of its dominant\npulsation modes ($\\Pi \\sim 113$ s and $\\Pi \\sim 192$ s), to derive a new\nconstraint on the mass of the axion, the hypothetical non-barionic particle\nconsidered as a possible component of the dark matter of the Universe. If the\nasteroseismic model employed is an accurate representation of L19-2, then our\nresults indicate hints of extra cooling in this star, compatible with emission\nof axions of mass $m_{\\rm a} \\cos^2 \\beta \\lesssim 25$ meV or an axion-electron\ncoupling constant of $g_{\\rm ae} \\lesssim 7 \\times 10^{-13}$.\n", "  The first-known tidal disruption event (TDE) with strong evidence for a\nrelativistic jet -- based on extensive multi-wavelength campaigns -- is Swift\nJ1644+5734. In order to directly measure the apparent speed of the radio jet,\nwe performed very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with the\nEuropean VLBI network (EVN) at 5 GHz. Our observing strategy was to identify a\nvery nearby and compact radio source with the real-time e-EVN, and then utilise\nthis source as a stationary astrometry reference point in the later five deep\nEVN observations. With respect to the in-beam source FIRST J1644+5736, we have\nachieved a statistical astrometric precision about 12 micro-arcsecond (68 %\nconfidence level) per epoch. This is one of the best phase-referencing\nmeasurements available to date. No proper motion has been detected in the Swift\nJ1644+5734 radio ejecta. We conclude that the apparent average ejection speed\nbetween 2012.2 and 2015.2 was less than 0.3c with a confidence level of 99 %.\nThis tight limit is direct observational evidence for either a very small\nviewing angle or a strong jet deceleration due to interactions with a dense\ncircum-nuclear medium, in agreement with some recent theoretical studies.\n", "  We continue the exploration of the BaLROG (Bars in Low Redshift Optical\nGalaxies) sample: 16 large mosaics of barred galaxies observed with the\nintegral field unit SAURON. We quantify the influence of bars on the\ncomposition of the stellar component. We derive linestrength indices of\nH${\\beta}$, Fe5015 and Mgb. Based on single stellar population (SSP) models, we\ncalculate ages, metallicities and [Mg/Fe] abundances and their gradients along\nthe bar major and minor axes. The high spatial resolution of our data allows us\nto identify breaks among index and SSP profiles, commonly at 0.13$\\pm$0.06 bar\nlength, consistent with kinematic features. Inner gradients are about ten times\nsteeper than outer gradients and become larger when there is a central rotating\ncomponent, implying that the gradients are not independent of dynamics and\norbits. Central ages appear to be younger for stronger bars. Yet, the bar\nregions are usually old. We find a flattening of the iron (Fe5015) and\nmagnesium (Mgb) outer gradients along the bar major axis, translating into a\nflattening of the metallicity gradient. This gradient is found to be\n0.03$\\pm$0.07 dex/kpc along the bar major axis while the mean value of the bar\nminor axis compares well with that of an unbarred control sample and is\nsignificantly steeper, namely -0.20$\\pm$0.04 dex/kpc. These results confirm\nrecent simulations and discern the important localized influence of bars. The\nelevated [Mg/Fe] abundances of bars and bulges compared to the lower values of\ndiscs suggest an early formation, in particular for early type galaxies.\n", "  We establish a geometric interpretation of orientifold Donaldson-Thomas\ninvariants of $\\sigma$-symmetric quivers with involution. More precisely, we\nprove that the cohomological orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariant is\nisomorphic to the rational Chow group of the moduli space of $\\sigma$-stable\nself-dual quiver representations. As an application we prove that the Chow\nBetti numbers of moduli spaces of stable $m$-tuples in classical Lie algebras\ncan be computed numerically. We also prove a cohomological wall-crossing\nformula relating semistable Hall modules for different stabilities.\n", "  In the recent paper Buchbinder, Kirillova and Pletnev presented formal\narguments concerning quantum equivalence of free massive antisymmetric tensor\nfields of second and third rank to the free Proca theory and massive scalar\nfield with minimal coupling to gravity, respectively. We confirm this result\nusing explicit covariant calculations of non-local form factors based on the\nheart-kernel technique, and discuss the discontinuity of quantum contributions\nin the massless limit.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experimental report on in-plane anisotropic resistivity\nin the double-striped antiferromagnetic phase of FeTe, we theoretically\ncalculate in-plane resistivity by applying a memory function approach to the\nordered phase. We find that the resistivity is larger along an\nantiferromagnetically ordered direction than along a ferromagnetically ordered\none, consistent with experimental observation. The anisotropic results are\nmainly contributed from Drude weight, whose behavior is attributed to Fermi\nsurface topology of the ordered phase.\n", "  We study the effect of Active Nuclei Galaxy (AGN) feedback as one of the\nmajor mechanisms modifying the cluster morphology influencing scaling\nrelations, which are the most uncertain factor in constraining cosmology with\nclusters of galaxies. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations we\ninvestigate how the AGN feedback changes the X-ray morphology of the simulated\nsystems, and compare to the observed REXCESS (Representative XMM-Newton Cluster\nStructure Survey) clusters. We apply centre shifts and power ratios to\ncharacterise the cluster morphology, and find that our simulated clusters are\nmore substructured than the observed ones. We show that the degree of this\ndiscrepancy is affected by the inclusion of AGN feedback. While the clusters\nsimulated with the AGN feedback are in much better agreement with the REXCESS\nL_X-T relation, they are also more substructured, which increases the tension\nwith observations. This suggests that not only global cluster properties such\nas L_X and T and radial profiles should be used to compare and to calibrate\nsimulations with observations, but also substructure measures such as centre\nshifts and power ratios. We discuss what changes in the simulations might ease\nthe tension with observational constraints on these quantities.\n", "  Be stars are surrounded by outflowing circumstellar matter structured in the\nform of decretion discs. They are often members of binary systems, where it is\nexpected that the decretion disc interacts both radiatively and gravitationally\nwith the companion. In this work we study how various orbital (period, mass\nratio and eccentricity) and disc (viscosity) parameters affect the disc\nstructure in coplanar systems. We simulate such binaries with the use of a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The main effects of the secondary on the\ndisc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.\nWe find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular\nor nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in\nshape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc is smaller\nin size, more elongated and more massive for low viscosity parameter, small\norbital separation and/or high mass ratio. (ii) Highly eccentric orbits are\nmore complex, with the disc structure and total mass strongly dependent on the\norbital phase and the distance to the secondary. We also study the effects of\nbinarity in the disc continuum emission. Since the infrared and radio SED are\nsensitive to the disc size and density slope, the truncation and matter\naccumulation result in considerable modifications in the emergent spectrum. We\nconclude that binarity can serve as an explanation for the variability\nexhibited in observations of Be stars, and that our model can be used to detect\ninvisible companions.\n", "  We present a novel method to detect the effects of dynamical friction in\nobserved galaxy clusters. Following accretion into clusters, massive satellite\ngalaxies will backsplash to systematically smaller radii than less massive\nsatellites, an effect that may be detected by stacking the number density\nprofiles of galaxies around clusters. We show that this effect may be\nunderstood using a simple toy model which reproduces the trends with halo\nproperties observed in simulations. We search for this effect using SDSS\nredMaPPer clusters with richness 10<lambda<20, and find that bright (M_i<-21.5)\nsatellites have smaller splashback radii than fainter (M_i>-20) satellites at\n99% confidence.\n", "  We present a catalogue of 1715 early-type galaxies from the literature,\nspanning the luminosity range from faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies to giant\nelliptical galaxies. The aim of this catalogue is to be one of the most\ncomprehensive and publicly available collections of data on early-type\ngalaxies. The emphasis in this catalogue lies on dwarf elliptical galaxies, for\nwhich some samples with detailed data have been published recently. For almost\nall of the early-type galaxies included in it, this catalogue contains data on\ntheir locations, distances, redshifts, half-light radii, the masses of their\nstellar populations and apparent magnitudes in various passbands. Data on\nmetallicity and various colours are available for a majority of the galaxies\npresented here. The data on magnitudes, colours, metallicities and masses of\nthe stellar populations is supplemented with entries that are based on fits to\ndata from simple stellar population models and existing data from observations.\nAlso, some simple transformations have been applied to the data on magnitudes,\ncolours and metallicities in this catalog, in order to increase the homogeneity\nof this data. Estimates on the S\\'{e}rsic profiles, internal velocity\ndispersions, maximum rotational velocities, dynamical masses and ages are\nlisted for several hundreds of the galaxies in this catalogue. Finally, each\nquantity listed in this catalogue is accompanied with information on its\nsource, so that users of this catalogue can easily exclude data that they do\nnot consider as reliable enough for their purposes.\n", "  While the Virgo cluster is the nearest galaxy cluster and therefore the best\nobserved one, little is known about its formation history. In this paper, a set\nof cosmological simulations that resemble the Local Universe is used to shed\nthe first light on this mystery. The initial conditions for these simulations\nare constrained with galaxy peculiar velocities of the second catalog of the\nCosmicflows project using algorithms developed within the Constrained Local\nUniversE Simulation project. Boxes of 500 Mpc/h on a side are set to run a\nseries of dark matter only constrained simulations. In each simulation, a\nunique dark matter halo can be reliably identified as Virgo's counterpart. The\nproperties of these Virgo halos are in agreement at a 10-20% level with the\nglobal properties of the observed Virgo cluster. Their zero-velocity masses\nagree at one-sigma with the observational mass estimate. In all the\nsimulations, the matter falls onto the Virgo objects along a preferential\ndirection that corresponds to the observational filament and the slowest\ndirection of collapse. A study of the mass accretion history of the Virgo\ncandidates reveals the most likely formation history of the Virgo cluster,\nnamely a quiet accretion over the last 7 Gigayears.\n", "  In this study, we use a one-zone leptonic and a lepto-hadronic model to\ninvestigate the multi-wavelength emission and the prominent flare of the flat\nspectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 in Nov 2010. We perform a parameter study with\nboth models to obtain broadband fits to the spectral energy distribution of 3C\n454.3. Starting with the baseline parameters obtained from the fits, we then\ninvestigate different flaring scenarios for both models to explain an extreme\noutburst and spectral hardening of 3C 454.3 that occurred in Nov 2010. We find\nthat the one zone lepto-hadronic model can successfully explain both the\nbroadband multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution and light curves in the\noptical R, Swift XRT and Fermi gamma-ray bandpasses for 3C 454.3 during\nquiescence and the peak of the Nov. 2010 flare. We also find that the one-zone\nleptonic model produces poor fits to the broadband spectra in the X-ray and\nhigh energy gamma-ray band passes for the Nov. 2010 flare.\n", "  We present our work on the simulation of the early stages of heavy-ion\ncollisions with finite longitudinal thickness in the laboratory frame in 3+1\ndimensions. In particular we study the effects of nuclear thickness on the\nproduction of a glasma state in the McLerran-Venugopalan model within the color\nglass condensate framework. A finite thickness enables us to describe nuclei at\nlower energies, but forces us to abandon boost-invariance. As a consequence,\nrandom classical color sources within the nuclei have to be included in the\nsimulation, which is achieved by using the colored particle-in-cell (CPIC)\nmethod. We show that the description in the laboratory frame agrees with\nboost-invariant approaches as a limiting case. Furthermore we investigate\ncollisions beyond boost-invariance, in particular the pressure anisotropy in\nthe glasma.\n", "  We review current understanding of kilonova/macronova emission from compact\nbinary mergers (mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black\nhole). Kilonova/macronova is optical and near-infrared emission powered by\nradioactive decays of r-process nuclei. Emission from the dynamical ejecta with\n~0.01 Msun is likely to have a luminosity of ~10^{40}-10^{41} erg s^{-1} with a\ncharacteristic timescale of about 1 week. The spectral peak is located in red\noptical or near-infrared wavelengths. A subsequent accretion disk wind may\nprovide an additional luminosity, or an earlier/bluer emission if it is not\nabsorbed by the precedent dynamical ejecta. The detection of near-infrared\nexcess in the afterglow of short GRB 130603B and possible optical excess in GRB\n060614 supports the concept of the kilonova/macronova scenario. At 200 Mpc\ndistance, a typical brightness of kilonova/macronova with 0.01 Msun ejecta is\nexpected to be about 22 mag and the emission rapidly fades to >24 mag within\n~10 days after the merger. Kilonova/macronova candidates can be distinguished\nfrom supernovae by (1) the faster time evolution, (2) fainter absolute\nmagnitudes, and (3) redder colors. To effectively search for such objects,\nfollow-up survey observations with multiple visits within <10 days and with\nmultiple filters will be important. Since the high expansion velocity (v ~\n0.1-0.2c) is a robust outcome of compact binary mergers, the detection of\nsmooth spectra will be the smoking gun to conclusively identify the GW source.\n", "  Herschel observations of nearby molecular clouds suggest that interstellar\nfilaments and prestellar cores represent two fundamental steps in the star\nformation process. The observations support a picture of low-mass star\nformation according to which ~ 0.1 pc-wide filaments form first in the cold\ninterstellar medium, probably as a result of large-scale compression of\ninterstellar matter by supersonic turbulent flows, and then prestellar cores\narise from gravitational fragmentation of the densest filaments. Whether this\nscenario also applies to regions of high-mass star formation is an open\nquestion, in part because Herschel data cannot resolve the inner width of\nfilaments in the nearest regions of massive star formation.\n  We used the bolometer camera ArTeMiS on the APEX telescope to map the central\npart of the NGC6334 complex at a factor of > 3 higher resolution than Herschel\nat 350 microns. Combining ArTeMiS data with Herschel data allowed us to study\nthe structure of the main filament of the complex with a resolution of 8\" or <\n0.07 pc at d ~ 1.7 kpc.\n  Our study confirms that this filament is a very dense, massive linear\nstructure with a line mass ranging from ~ 500 Msun/pc to ~ 2000 Msun/pc over\nnearly 10 pc. It also demonstrates that its inner width remains as narrow as W\n~ 0.15 +- 0.05 pc all along the filament length, within a factor of < 2 of the\ncharacteristic 0.1 pc value found with Herschel for lower-mass filaments in the\nGould Belt. While it is not completely clear whether the NGC 6334 filament will\nform massive stars or not in the future, it is two to three orders of magnitude\ndenser than the majority of filaments observed in Gould Belt clouds, and yet\nhas a very similar inner width. This points to a common physical mechanism for\nsetting the filament width and suggests that some important structural\nproperties of nearby clouds also hold in high-mass star forming regions.\n", "  We explore the pitfalls which affect the comparison of the star-formation\n(SF) relation for nearby molecular clouds with that for distant compact\nmolecular clumps. We show that both relations behave differently in the\n($\\Sigma_{gas}$, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$) space, where $\\Sigma_{gas}$ and $\\Sigma_{SFR}$\nare, respectively, the gas and SF rate surface densities, even when the physics\nof star formation is the same. This is because the SF relation of nearby clouds\nrelates gas and star surface densities measured locally, that is, within a\ngiven interval of gas surface density, or at a given protostar location. We\nrefer to such measurements as local measurements, and the corresponding SF\nrelation as the local relation. In contrast, the stellar content of a distant\nmolecular clump remains unresolved. Only the mean SF rate can be obtained from\ne.g. the clump infrared luminosity. One clump therefore provides one single\npoint to the ($\\Sigma_{gas}$, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$) space, that is, its mean gas\nsurface density and SF rate surface density. We refer to this SF relation as a\nglobal relation since it builds on the global properties of molecular clumps.\nIts definition therefore requires an ensemble of cluster-forming clumps. We\nshow that, although the local and global relations have different slopes, this\nper se cannot be taken as evidence for a change in the physics of SF with gas\nsurface density. It therefore appears that great caution should be taken when\nphysically interpreting a composite SF relation, that is, a relation combining\ntogether local and global measurements.\n", "  Using resonant light absorption, random walk motions of rubidium atoms in\nnitrogen buffer gas are observed directly. The transmitted light intensity\nthrough atomic vapor is measured and its spectrum is obtained, down to orders\nof magnitude below the shot noise level to detect fluctuations caused by atomic\nmotions. To understand the measured spectra, the spectrum for atoms performing\nrandom walks in a gaussian light beam is computed and its analytical form is\nobtained. The spectrum has $1/f^2$ ($f$: frequency) behavior at higher\nfrequencies, crossing over to a different, but well defined behavior at lower\nfrequencies. The properties of this theoretical spectrum agree excellently with\nthe measured spectrum. This understanding also enables us to obtain the\ndiffusion constant, the photon cross section of atoms in buffer gas and the\natomic number density, from a single spectral measurement. We further discuss\nother possible applications of our experimental method and analysis.\n", "  We present deep spectra of ring nebulae associated with Wolf-Rayet (WR) and\nO-type stars: NGC 6888, G2.4+1.4, RCW 58, S 308, NGC 7635 and RCW 52. The data\nhave been taken with the 10m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the 6.5m Clay\nTelescope. We extract spectra of several apertures in some of the objects. We\nderive C$^{++}$ and O$^{++}$ abundances from faint recombination lines in NGC\n6888 and NGC 7635, permitting to derive their C/H and C/O ratios and estimate\nthe abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) of O$^{++}$. The ADFs are larger than\nthe typical ones of normal HII regions but similar to those found in the\nionised gas of star-forming dwarf galaxies. We find that chemical abundances\nare rather homogeneous in the nebulae where we have spectra of several\napertures: NGC 6888, NGC 7635 and G2.4+1.4. We obtain very high values of\nelectron temperature in a peripheral zone of NGC 6888, finding that shock\nexcitation can reproduce its spectral properties. We find that all the objects\nassociated with WR stars show N enrichment. Some of them also show He\nenrichment and O deficiency as well as a lower Ne/O than expected, this may\nindicate the strong action of the ON and NeNa cycles. We have compared the\nchemical composition of NGC 6888, G2.4+1.4, RCW 58 and S 308 with the\nnucleosynthesis predicted by stellar evolution models of massive stars. We find\nthat non-rotational models of stars of initial masses between 25 and 40 solar\nmasses seem to reproduce the observed abundance ratios of most of the nebulae.\n", "  Future large liquid-scintillator detectors can be implemented to observe\nneutrinos from a core-collapse supernova (SN) in our galaxy in various reaction\nchannels: (1) The inverse beta decay $\\overline{\\nu}^{}_e + p \\to n + e^+$; (2)\nThe elastic neutrino-proton scattering $\\nu + p \\to \\nu + p$; (3) The elastic\nneutrino-electron scattering $\\nu + e^- \\to \\nu + e^-$; (4) The charged-current\n$\\nu^{}_e$ interaction $\\nu^{}_e + {^{12}}{\\rm C} \\to e^- + {^{12}}{\\rm N}$;\n(5) The charged-current $\\overline{\\nu}^{}_e$ interaction $\\overline{\\nu}^{}_e\n+ {^{12}}{\\rm C} \\to e^+ + {^{12}}{\\rm B}$; (6) The neutral-current interaction\n$\\nu + {^{12}}{\\rm C} \\to \\nu + {^{12}}{\\rm C}^*$. The less abundant $^{13}{\\rm\nC}$ atoms in the liquid scintillator are also considered as a target, and both\nthe charged-current interaction $\\nu^{}_e + {^{13}}{\\rm C} \\to e^- +\n{^{13}}{\\rm N}$ and the neutral-current interaction $\\nu + {^{13}}{\\rm C} \\to\n\\nu + {^{13}}{\\rm C}^*$ are taken into account. In this work, we show for the\nfirst time that a global analysis of all these channels at a single\n{liquid-}scintillator detector, such as Jiangmen Underground Neutrino\nObservatory (JUNO), is very important to test the average-energy hierarchy of\nSN neutrinos and how the total energy is partitioned among neutrino flavors. In\naddition, the dominant channels for reconstructing neutrino spectra and the\nimpact of other channels are discussed in great detail.\n", "  We analysed the effects of planet ingestion on the characteristics of a\npre-MS star similar to the Gamma Velorum cluster member 2MASS\nJ08095427--4721419 (#52). We discussed the effects of changing the age $t_0$ at\nwhich the accretion episode occurs, the mass of the ingested planet and its\nchemical composition. We showed that the mass of the ingested planet required\nto explain the current [Fe/H]^#52 increases by decreasing the age $t_0$ and/or\nby decreasing the Iron content of the accreted matter.\n  We compared the predictions of a simplified accretion method -- where only\nthe variation of the surface chemical composition is considered -- with that of\na full accretion model that properly accounts for the modification of the\nstellar structure. We showed that the two approaches result in different\nconvective envelope extension which can vary up to 10 percent. We discussed the\nimpact of the planet ingestion on a stellar model in the colour-magnitude\ndiagram, showing that a maximum shift of about 0.06 dex in the colour and 0.07\ndex in magnitude are expected and that such variations persist even much later\nthe accretion episode. We also analysed the systematic bias in the stellar mass\nand age inferred by using a grid of standard non accreting models to recover\nthe characteristics of an accreting star. We found that standard non accreting\nmodels can safely be adopted for mass estimate, as the bias is <= 6 percent,\nwhile much more caution should be used for age estimate where the differences\ncan reach about 60 percent.\n", "  We present a kinematic analysis of 152 low surface gravity M7-L8 dwarfs by\nadding 8 parallaxes, 38 radial velocities, and 19 proper motions. We find 39\nobjects to be high-likelihood or bona fide members of nearby moving groups, 92\nobjects to be ambiguous members and 21 objects that are non-members. We find\nthat gravity classification and photometric color separate 5-150 Myr sources\nfrom > 3 Gyr field objects, but they do not correlate one-to-one with the\nnarrower 5 -150 Myr age range. The absolute magnitudes of low-gravity sources\nfrom J band through W3 show a flux redistribution when compared to equivalent\nfield sources that is correlated with spectral subtype. Clouds, which are a far\nmore dominant opacity source for L dwarfs, are the likely cause. On CMDs, the\nlatest-type low-gravity L dwarfs drive the elbow of the L/T transition up to 1\nmag redder and 1 mag fainter than field dwarfs at M_J but are consistent with\nor brighter than the elbow at M_W1 and M_W2. Furthermore, there is an\nindication on CMD's (such as M_J versus (J-W2) of increasingly redder sequences\nseparated by gravity classification. Examining bolometric luminosities for\nplanets and low-gravity objects, we confirm that young M dwarfs are\noverluminous while young L dwarfs are normal compared to the field. This\ntranslates into warmer M dwarf temperatures compared to the field sequence\nwhile lower temperatures for L dwarfs.\n", "  We implement novel numerical models of AGN feedback in the SPH code GADGET-3,\nwhere the energy from a supermassive black hole (BH) is coupled to the\nsurrounding gas in the kinetic form. Gas particles lying inside a bi-conical\nvolume around the BH are imparted a one-time velocity (10,000 km/s) increment.\nWe perform hydrodynamical simulations of isolated cluster (total mass 10^14 /h\nM_sun), which is initially evolved to form a dense cool core, having central\nT<10^6 K. A BH resides at the cluster center, and ejects energy. The\nfeedback-driven fast wind undergoes shock with the slower-moving gas, which\ncauses the imparted kinetic energy to be thermalized. Bipolar bubble-like\noutflows form propagating radially outward to a distance of a few 100 kpc. The\nradial profiles of median gas properties are influenced by BH feedback in the\ninner regions (r<20-50 kpc). BH kinetic feedback, with a large value of the\nfeedback efficiency, depletes the inner cool gas and reduces the hot gas\ncontent, such that the initial cool core of the cluster is heated up within a\ntime 1.9 Gyr, whereby the core median temperature rises to above 10^7 K, and\nthe central entropy flattens. Our implementation of BH thermal feedback (using\nthe same efficiency as kinetic), within the star-formation model, cannot do\nthis heating, where the cool core remains. The inclusion of cold gas accretion\nin the simulations produces naturally a duty cycle of the AGN with a\nperiodicity of 100 Myr.\n", "  In the present paper we discuss how to maximize the double-parton scattering\n(DPS) contribution in four-jet production by selecting kinematical cuts. Here\nboth single-parton and double-parton scattering effects are calculated in the\n$k_T$-factorization approach, following our recent developments of relevant\nmethods and tools. Several differential distributions are shown and discussed\nin the context of future searches for DPS effects, such as rapidity of jets,\nrapidity distance, and azimuthal correlations between jets. The dependences of\nthe relative DPS amount is studied as function of those observables. The\nregions with an enhanced DPS contribution are identified. Future experimental\nexplorations could extract more precise values of $\\sigma_{eff}$ and its\npotential dependence on kinematical variables.\n", "  The ALICE Collaboration has recently measured the correlations between\namplitudes of anisotropic flow in different Fourier harmonics, referred to as\nsymmetric cumulants. We derive approximate relations between symmetric\ncumulants involving $v_4$ and $v_5$ and the event-plane correlations measured\nby ATLAS. The validity of these relations is tested using event-by-event\nhydrodynamic calculations. The corresponding results are in better agreement\nwith ALICE data than existing hydrodynamic predictions. We make quantitative\npredictions for three symmetric cumulants which are not yet measured.\n", "  [Abridged] Inverse Compton scattering of CMB fluctuations off cosmic electron\nplasma generates a polarization of the associated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect. This signal has been studied so far mostly in the non-relativistic\nregime and for a thermal electron population and, as such, has limited\nastrophysical applications. Partial attempts to extend this calculation for a\nthermal electron plasma in the relativistic regime have been done but cannot be\napplied to a general relativistic electron distribution. Here we derive a\ngeneral form of the SZ effect polarization valid in the full relativistic\napproach for both thermal and non-thermal electron plasmas, as well as for a\ngeneric combination of various electron population co-spatially distributed in\nthe environments of galaxy clusters or radiogalaxy lobes. We derive the\nspectral shape of the Stokes parameters induced by the IC scattering of every\nCMB multipole, focusing on the CMB quadrupole and octupole that provide the\nlargest detectable signals in galaxy clusters. We found that the CMB quadrupole\ninduced Stoke parameter Q is always positive with a maximum amplitude at 216\nGHz which increases slightly with increasing cluster temperature. The CMB\noctupole induced Q spectrum shows, instead, a cross-over frequency which\ndepends on the cluster electron temperature, or on the minimum momentum p_1 as\nwell as on the power-law spectral index of a non-thermal electron population.\nWe discuss some possibilities to disentangle the quadrupole-induced Q spectrum\nfrom the octupole-induced one which allow to measure these quantities through\nthe SZ effect polarization. We finally apply our model to the realistic case of\nthe Bullet cluster and derive the visibility windows of the total,\nquandrupole-induced and octupole-induced Stoke parameter Q in the frequency\nranges accessible to SKA, ALMA, MILLIMETRON and CORE++ experiments.\n", "  Observational evidence indicates that the role of gas is secondary to that of\ngravity in the formation of the most luminous spheroids inhabiting the centres\nof galaxy associations, as originally conjectured in the late 80's/early 90's.\nHowever, attempts to explain the origin of the Fundamental Plane (FP) of\nmassive early-type galaxies (ETGs) -- a tilted version of the scaling relation\nconnecting the size, velocity dispersion and mass of virialized homologous\nsystems -- based on sequences of pairwise mergers, have systematically\nconcluded that dissipation cannot be ignored. We use controlled simulations of\nthe previrialization stage of galaxy groups to show that multiple collisionless\nmerging is capable of creating realistic first-ranked galaxies. Our mock\nremnants define a thin FP that perfectly fits data from all kinds of giant ETGs\nin the local volume, showing the existence of a unified relationship for these\nsystems. High-ranked galaxies occupy in the FP different areas than standard\nobjects, a segregation which is viewed essentially as zero-point offsets in the\n2D correlations arising from standard projections of this plane. Our findings\nmake a strong case for considering hierarchical dissipationless merging a\nviable route for the formation of the largest galaxies in the universe.\n", "  We present an axially symmetric formula to calculate the probability of\nfinding gravitational arcs in galaxy clusters, being induced by their massive\ndark matter haloes, as a function of clusters redshifts and virial masses. The\nformula includes the ellipticity of the clusters dark matter potential by using\na pseudo-elliptical approximation. The probabilities are calculated and\ncompared for two dark-matter halo profiles, the Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW)\nand the Non-Singular-Isothermal-Sphere (NSIS). We demonstrate the power of our\nformulation through a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the strong lensing\nstatistics of an X-ray bright sample of low redshift Abell clusters. This KS\ntest allows to establish limits on the values of the concentration parameter\nfor the NFW profile ($c_\\Delta$) and the core radius for the NSIS profile\n(\\rc), which are related to the lowest cluster redshift ($z_{\\rm cut}$) where\nstrong arcs can be observed. For NFW dark matter profiles, we infer cluster\nhaloes with concentrations that are consistent to those predicted by\n$\\Lambda$CDM simulations. As for NSIS dark matter profiles, we find only upper\nlimits for the clusters core radii and thus do not rule out a purely SIS model.\nFor alternative mass profiles, our formulation provides constraints through\n$z_{\\rm cut}$ on the parameters that control the concentration of mass in the\ninner region of the clusters haloes. We find that $z_{\\rm cut}$ is expected to\nlie in the 0.0--0.2 redshift, highlighting the need to include very low-$z$\nclusters in samples to study the clusters mass profiles.\n", "  We present proper motions for 15 pulsars which are observed regularly by the\nNanshan 25-m radio telescope. Two methods, the frequentist method (Coles et\nal.2011) and the Bayesian (Lentati et al. 2014) method, are used and the\nresults are compared. We demonstrate that the two methods can be applied to\nyoung pulsar data sets that exhibit large amounts of timing noise with steep\nspectral exponents and give consistent results. The measured positions also\nagree with very-long-baseline interferometric positions. Proper motions for\nfour pulsars are obtained for the first time, and improved values are obtained\nfor five pulsars.\n", "  In this thesis we discuss three separate analysis of various phenomenological\naspects of heavy-ion collisions (HIC). The first one is a possible\ngeneralization of the kinetic theory framework for dense systems. We\ninvestigate its long-time behaviour and the properties of the equilibrium. The\nsecond discussion is about the phenomenological analysis of the azimuthal\nasymmetry of the particle yields in a HIC, where we link the initial stage\ngeometrical asymmetry to the particle yields and examine the possible\norganizing mechanisms that could be responsible for such a relation. The third,\nand also the most thorough part of the thesis is about the relation of the\nspectral density of quasi-particle states and the macroscopic fluidity measure\n(the ratio of shear viscosity and the entropy density) and other transport\nproperties of the system. We extensively study the liquid-gas crossover with\nthe help of model spectral functions. The main conclusion is that the relative\nintensification of the continuum of the scattering states compared to the\nquasi-particle peak makes the matter more fluent.\n", "  We confirm, using spectra from seven observatories, that the diffuse bands\n6196 and 6614 are very tightly correlated. However, their strength ratio is not\nconstant as well as profile shapes. Apparently the two interstellar features do\nnot react in unison to the varying physical conditions of different\ninterstellar clouds.\n", "  We investigate synchronization in complex networks of noisy phase\noscillators. We find that, while too weak a coupling is not sufficient for the\nwhole system to synchronize, too strong a coupling induces a nontrivial type of\nphase slip among oscillators, resulting in synchronization failure. Thus, an\nintermediate coupling range for synchronization exists, which becomes narrower\nwhen the network is more heterogeneous. Analyses of two noisy oscillators\nreveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present\nand coupling is strong. Therefore, the low synchronizability of heterogeneous\nnetworks can be understood as a result of the difference in effective coupling\nstrength among oscillators with different degrees; oscillators with high\ndegrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak\ncoupling strengths that are insufficient for synchronization.\n", "  We present a pair of optimized objective lenses with long working distances\nof 117~mm and 65~mm respectively that offer diffraction limited performance for\nboth Cs and Rb wavelengths when imaging through standard vacuum windows. The\ndesigns utilise standard catalog lens elements to provide a simple and\ncost-effective solution. Objective 1 provides $\\mathrm{NA}=0.175$ offering\n3~$\\mu$m resolution whilst objective 2 is optimized for high collection\nefficiency with $\\mathrm{NA}=0.29$ and 1.8~$\\mu$m resolution. This flexible\ndesign can be further extended for use at shorter wavelengths by simply\nre-optimising the lens separations.\n", "  We analyse the planetary nebulae (PNe) population of the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC), based on evolutionary models of stars with metallicities in the\nrange $10^{-3} \\leq Z \\leq 4\\times 10^{-3}$ and mass $0.9 M\\odot < M <\n8M\\odot$, evolved through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. The models\nused account for dust formation in the circumstellar envelope. To characterise\nthe PNe sample of the SMC, we compare the observed abundances of the various\nspecies with the final chemical composition of the AGB models: this study\nallows us to identify the progenitors of the PNe observed, in terms of mass and\nchemical composition. According to our interpretation, most of the PNe descend\nfrom low-mass ($M < 2 M\\odot$) stars, which become carbon rich, after\nexperiencing repeated third dredge-up episodes, during the AGB phase. A\nfraction of the PNe showing the signature of advanced CNO processing are\ninterpreted as the progeny of massive AGB stars, with mass above $\\sim 6\nM\\odot$, undergoing strong hot bottom burning. The differences with the\nchemical composition of the PNe population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\nis explained on the basis of the diverse star formation history and\nage-metallicity relation of the two galaxies. The implications of the present\nstudy for some still highly debated points regarding the AGB evolution are also\ncommented.\n", "  The instabilities triggered when two counter-streaming pair beams collide are\nanalyzed. A guiding magnetic field is accounting for, while both beams are\nconsidered identical and cold. The instability analysis is conducted over the\nfull \\textbf{k}-spectrum, allowing to derive the hierarchy map of the dominant\nunstable modes, in terms of the initial beams energy $\\gamma_0$ and a magnetic\nfield strength parameter $\\Omega_B$. Four different regions of the\n$(\\Omega_B,\\gamma_0)$ phase space are identified, each one governed by a\ndifferent kind of mode. The analysis also unravels the existence of a \"triple\npoint\", where 3 different modes grow exactly the same rate. A number of\nanalytical expressions can be derived, either for the modes growth-rates, or\nfor the frontiers between the 4 regions.\n", "  Microvariability (intra-night variability) is a low amplitude flux change at\nshort time scales (i.e. hours). It has been detected in unobscured type 1 AGNs\nand blazars. However in type 2 AGNs, the detection is hampered by the low\ncontrast between the presumably variable nucleus and the host galaxy. In this\npaper, we present a search for microvariability in a sample of four type 2\nquasars as an astrostatistical problem. We are exploring the use of a newly\nintroduced enhanced F-test, proposed by de Diego 2014. The presented results\nshow that out of our four observed targets, we were able to apply this\nstatistical method to three of them. Evidence of microvariations is clear in\nthe case of quasar J0802+2552 in all used filters (g',r' and i') during both\nobserving nights, the microvariations are present in one of the nights of\nobservations of J1258+5239 in one filter (i'), while for the J1316+4452, there\nis evidence for microvariability within our detection levels during one night\nand two filters (r' and i'). We demonstrate the feasibility of the enhanced\nF-test to detect microvariability in obscured type 2 quasars. At the end of\nthis paper, we discuss possible causes of microvariability. One of the options\nis the misclassification of the targets. A likely scenario for explanation of\nthe phenomenon involves optically thin gaps in a clumpy obscuring medium, in\naccordance with the present view of the circumnuclear region. There is a\npossible interesting connection between the merging state of the targets and\ndetection of microvariability.\n", "  We obtain high spatial and spectral resolution images of the CO J=2-1, CN\nN=2-1 and CS J=5-4 emission with ALMA in Cycle~2. The radial distribution of\nthe turbulent broadening is derived with three approaches: two `direct' and one\nmodelling. The first requires a single transition and derives \\Tex{} directly\nfrom the line profile, yielding a \\vturb{}. The second assumes two different\nmolecules are co-spatial thus their relative linewidths allow for a calculation\nof \\Tkin{} and \\vturb{}. Finally we fit a parametric disk model where physical\nproperties of the disk are described by power laws, to compare our `direct'\nmethods with previous values. The two direct methods were limited to the outer\n$r > 40$~au disk due to beam smear. The direct method found \\vturb{} ranging\nfrom $\\approx$~\\vel{130} at 40~au, dropping to $\\approx$~\\vel{50} in the outer\ndisk, qualitatively recovered with the parametric model fitting. This\ncorresponds to roughly $0.2 - 0.4~c_s$. CN was found to exhibit strong non-LTE\neffects outside $r \\approx 140$~au, so \\vturb{} was limited to within this\nradius. The assumption that CN and CS are co-spatial is consistent with\nobserved linewidths only within $r \\lesssim 100$~au, within which \\vturb{} was\nfound to drop from \\vel{100} ($\\approx~0.4~c_s$) to nothing at 100~au. The\nparametric model yielded a near constant \\vel{50} for CS ($0.2 - 0.4~c_s$). We\ndemonstrate that absolute flux calibration is and will be the limiting factor\nin all studies of turbulence using a single molecule. The magnitude of the\ndispersion is comparable with or below that predicted by the magneto-rotational\ninstability theory. A more precise comparison would require to reach an\nabsolute calibration precision of order 3\\%, or to find a suitable combination\nof light and heavy molecules which are co-located in the disk.\n", "  Giant pulsar frequency glitches as detected in the emblematic Vela pulsar\nhave long been thought to be the manifestation of a neutron superfluid\npermeating the inner crust of a neutron star. However, this superfluid has been\nrecently found to be entrained by the crust, and as a consequence it does not\ncarry enough angular momentum to explain giant glitches. The extent to which\npulsar-timing observations can be reconciled with the standard vortex-mediated\nglitch theory is studied considering the current uncertainties on dense-matter\nproperties. To this end, the crustal moment of inertia of glitching pulsars is\ncalculated employing a series of different unified dense-matter equations of\nstate.\n", "  Simplified models provide an avenue for characterising and exploring New\nPhysics for large classes of UV theories. In this article we study the ability\nof the LHC to probe the spin and parity quantum numbers of a new light\nresonance $X$ which couples predominantly to the third generation quarks in a\nvariety of simplified models through the $t\\bar t X$ channel. After evaluating\nthe LHC discovery potential for $X$, we suggest several kinematic variables\nsensitive to the spin and CP properties of the new resonance. We show how an\nanalysis exploiting differential distributions in the semi-leptonic channel can\ndiscriminate among various possibilities. We find that the potential to\ndiscriminate a scalar from a pseudoscalar or (axial) vector to be particularly\npromising.\n", "  Radiative feedback is an important consequence of cluster formation in Giant\nMolecular Clouds (GMCs) in which newly formed clusters heat and ionize their\nsurrounding gas. The process of cluster formation, and the role of radiative\nfeedback, has not been fully explored in different GMC environments. We present\na suite of simulations which explore how the initial gravitational boundedness,\nand radiative feedback, affect cluster formation. We model the early evolution\n($<$ 5 Myr) of turbulent, 10$^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ clouds with virial parameters\nranging from 0.5 to 5. To model cluster formation, we use cluster sink\nparticles, coupled to a raytracing scheme, and a custom subgrid model which\npopulates a cluster via sampling an IMF with an efficiency of 20\\% per freefall\ntime. We find that radiative feedback only decreases the cluster particle\nformation efficiency by a few percent. The initial virial parameter plays a\nmuch stronger role in limiting cluster formation, with a spread of cluster\nformation efficiencies of 37\\% to 71\\% for the most unbound to the most bound\nmodel. The total number of clusters increases while the maximum mass cluster\ndecreases with an increasing initial virial parameter, resulting in steeper\nmass distributions. The star formation rates in our cluster particles are\ninitially consistent with observations but rise to higher values at late times.\nThis suggests that radiative feedback alone is not responsible for dispersing a\nGMC over the first 5 Myr of cluster formation.\n", "  The gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) model has been proposed as a\npossible explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae in the single-degenerate\nevolution channel. Driven by buoyancy, a deflagration flame rises in a narrow\ncone towards the surface. For the most part, the flow of the expanding ashes\nremains radial, but upon reaching the outer, low-pressure layers of the white\ndwarf, an additional lateral component develops. This makes the deflagration\nashes converge again at the opposite side, where the compression heats fuel and\na detonation may be launched. To test the GCD explosion model, we perform a 3D\nsimulation for a model with an ignition spot offset near the upper limit of\nwhat is still justifiable, 200 km. This simulation meets our deliberately\noptimistic detonation criteria and we initiate a detonation. The detonation\nburns through the white dwarf and leads to its complete disruption. We\ndetermine nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10^6 tracer particles with\na 384 nuclide reaction network and we present multi-band light curves and\ntime-dependent optical spectra. We find that our synthetic observables show a\nprominent viewing-angle sensitivity in UV and blue bands, which is in tension\nwith observed SNe Ia. The strong dependence on viewing-angle is caused by the\nasymmetric distribution of the deflagration ashes in the outer ejecta layers.\nFinally, we perform a comparison of our model to SN 1991T. The overall\nflux-level of the model is slightly too low and the model predicts pre-maximum\nlight spectral features due to Ca, S, and Si that are too strong. Furthermore,\nthe model chemical abundance stratification qualitatively disagrees with recent\nabundance tomography results in two key areas: our model lacks low velocity\nstable Fe and instead has copious amounts of high-velocity 56Ni and stable Fe.\nWe therefore do not find good agreement of the model with SN 1991T.\n", "  Thermal expansion and forced magnetostriction of MnSi were measured as a\nfunction of temperature down to 5 K and magnetic field to 3 T. The small length\n(volume) discontinuity at the magnetic phase transition in MnSi decreases with\napplication of magnetic field to a value $\\Delta L/L \\sim 10^{-7}$, and then\nsuddenly the discontinuity seemingly jumps to zero. Thermal expansivity peaks\nstrongly deteriorate with magnetic fields. No specific features identifying a\ntricritical point were observed. We propose that the Frenkel concept of\nheterophase fluctuations may be relevant in the current case. Therefore, we\nsuggest that the magnetic phase transition in MnSi always remains first order\nat any temperature and magnetic field, but the transition is progressively\nsmoothed by heterophase fluctuations. These results question the applicability\nof a model of a fluctuation-induced first order phase transition for MnSi.\nProbably a model of coupling of an order parameter with other degrees of\nfreedom is more appropriate.\n", "  Within the scope of isotropic FRW cosmological model the role of nonlinear\nspinor field in the evolution of the Universe is studied. It is found that\nunlike in anisotropic cosmological models in the present case the spinor field\ndoes not possess nontrivial non-diagonal components of energy-momentum tensor,\nconsequently does not impose any additional restrictions on the components of\nthe spinor field or metric function. The spinor description of different matter\nwas given and evolution of the Universe corresponding to these sources is\nillustrated. In the framework of a three fluid system the utility of spinor\ndescription of matter is established.\n", "  The ability to coherently transport electron-spin states between different\nsites of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots is an essential ingredient for\na quantum-dot-based quantum computer. Previous shuttles using electrostatic\ngating were too slow to move an electron within the spin dephasing time across\nan array. Here we report a nanosecond-timescale spin transfer of individual\nelectrons across a quadruple-quantum-dot device. Utilizing enhanced relaxation\nrates at a so-called `hot spot', we can upper bound the shuttle time to at most\n150 ns. While actual shuttle times are likely shorter, 150 ns is already fast\nenough to preserve spin coherence in e.g. silicon based quantum dots. This work\ntherefore realizes an important prerequisite for coherent spin transfer in\nquantum dot arrays.\n", "  We investigate the electronic and optical properties of monolayer and\nstacking dependent bilayer blue phosphorus in the framework of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and tight-binding approximations. We extract the\nhopping parameters of TB Hamiltonian for monolayer and bilayer blue phosphorus\nby using the DFT results. The variation of energy band gap with applied\nexternal electric field for two different stacks of bilayer blue phosphorus are\nalso shown. We examine the linear response of the systems due to the external\nelectromagnetic radiation in terms of the dielectric functions in the DFT\ntheory. The relatively large electronic band gap and possibility of exfoliation\nform bulk structure due to weak interlayer coupling, make blue phosphorus an\nappropriate candidate for future electronic devices.\n", "  KIC 9851944 is a short period ($P=2.16$ days) eclipsing binary in the {\\it\nKepler} field of view. By combining the analysis of {\\it Kepler} photometry and\nphase resolved spectra from Kitt Peak National Observatory and Lowell\nObservatory, we determine the atmospheric and physical parameters of both\nstars. The two components have very different radii ($2.27R_{\\odot}$,\n$3.19R_{\\odot}$) but close masses ($1.76 M_{\\odot}$, $1.79M_{\\odot}$) and\neffective temperatures ($7026$K, $6902$K), indicating different evolutionary\nstages. The hotter primary is still on the main sequence (MS), while the cooler\nand larger secondary star has evolved to post-MS, burning hydrogen in a shell.\nA comparison with coeval evolutionary models shows that it requires solar\nmetallicity and a higher mass ratio to fit the radii and temperatures of both\nstars simultaneously. Both components show $\\delta$ Scuti type pulsations which\nwe interpret as p-modes and p and g mixed modes. After a close examination of\nthe evolution of $\\delta$ Scuti pulsational frequencies, we make a comparison\nof the observed frequencies with those calculated from MESA/GYRE.\n", "  We present Chandra and Swift X-ray observations of four extremely low-mass\n(ELM) white dwarfs with massive companions. We place stringent limits on X-ray\nemission from all four systems, indicating that neutron star companions are\nextremely unlikely and that the companions are almost certainly white dwarfs.\nGiven the observed orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes, the total\nmasses of these binaries are greater than 1.02 to 1.39 Msun. The extreme mass\nratios between the two components make it unlikely that these binary white\ndwarfs will merge and explode as Type Ia or underluminous supernovae. Instead,\nthey will likely go through stable mass transfer through an accretion disk and\nturn into interacting AM CVn. Along with three previously known systems, we\nidentify two of our targets, J0811 and J2132, as systems that will definitely\nundergo stable mass transfer. In addition, we use the binary white dwarf sample\nfrom the ELM Survey to constrain the inspiral rate of systems with extreme mass\nratios. This rate, 0.00017/year, is consistent with the AM CVn space density\nestimated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Hence, stable mass transfer double\nwhite dwarf progenitors can account for the entire AM CVn population in the\nGalaxy.\n", "  Galactic globular clusters (GC) are known to have multiple stellar\npopulations and be characterised by similar chemical features, e.g. O-Na\nanti-correlation. While second-population stars, identified by their Na\noverabundance, have been found from the main sequence turn-off up to the tip of\nthe red giant branch in various Galactic GCs, asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars have rarely been targeted. The recent finding that NGC 6752 lacks an\nNa-rich AGB star has thus triggered new studies on AGB stars in GCs, since this\nresult questions our basic understanding of GC formation and stellar evolution\ntheory. In order to compare the Na abundance distributions of AGB and RGB stars\nin Galactic GCs and investigate whether the presence of Na-rich stars on the\nAGB is metallicity-dependent, we obtained the high-resolution spectra with the\nmulti-object high-resolution spectrograph FLAMES on ESO/VLT for a sample of AGB\nand RGB stars in the Galactic GC NGC 2808. The accurate Na abundances were\nderived for 31 AGB and 40 RGB stars. We find that NGC 2808 has a mean\nmetallicity of -1.11 $\\pm$ 0.08 dex, in good agreement with earlier analyses.\nComparable Na abundance dispersions are derived for our AGB and RGB samples,\nwith the AGB stars being slightly more concentrated than the RGB stars. The\nratios of Na-poor first-population to Na-rich second-population stars are 45:55\nin the AGB sample and 48:52 in the RGB sample. NGC 2808 has Na-rich\nsecond-population AGB stars, which turn out to be even more numerous - in\nrelative terms - than their Na-poor AGB counterparts and the Na-rich stars on\nthe RGB. Our findings are well reproduced by the fast rotating massive stars\nscenario and they do not contradict the recent results that there is not an\nNa-rich AGB star in NGC 6752. NGC 2808 thus joins the larger group of Galactic\nGCs for which Na-rich second-population stars on the AGB have recently been\nfound.\n", "  We report new CHARA/MIRC interferometric observations of the Cepheid\narchetype $\\delta$ Cep, which aimed at detecting the newly discovered\nspectroscopic companion. We reached a maximum dynamic range $\\Delta H $ = 6.4,\n5.8, and 5.2 mag, respectively within the relative distance to the Cepheid $r <\n25$ mas, $25 < r < 50$ mas and $50 < r < 100$ mas. Our observations did not\nshow strong evidence of a companion. We have a marginal detection at $3\\sigma$\nwith a flux ratio of 0.21\\%, but nothing convincing as we found other possible\nprobable locations. We ruled out the presence of companion with a spectral type\nearlier than F0V, A1V and B9V, respectively for the previously cited ranges\n$r$. From our estimated sensitivity limits and the Cepheid light curve, we\nderived lower-limit magnitudes in the $H$ band for this possible companion to\nbe $H_\\mathrm{comp} > 9.15, 8.31$ and 7.77 mag, respectively for $r < 25$ mas,\n$25 < r < 50$ mas and $50 < r < 100$ mas. We also found that to be consistent\nwith the predicted orbital period, the companion has to be located at a\nprojected separation $< 24$ mas with a spectral type later than a F0V star.\n", "  The unrivalled spatial resolution of the Chandra X-ray observatory has\nallowed many breakthroughs to be made in high energy astrophysics. Here we\nexplore applications of Gaussian Gradient Magnitude (GGM) filtering to X-ray\ndata, which dramatically improves the clarity of surface brightness edges in\nX-ray observations, and maps gradients in X-ray surface brightness over a range\nof spatial scales. In galaxy clusters, we find that this method is able to\nreveal remarkable substructure behind the cold fronts in Abell 2142 and Abell\n496, possibly the result of Kelvin Helmholtz instabilities. In Abell 2319 and\nAbell 3667, we demonstrate that the GGM filter can provide a straightforward\nway of mapping variations in the widths and jump ratios along the lengths of\ncold fronts. We present results from our ongoing programme of analysing the\nChandra and XMM-Newton archives with the GGM filter. In the Perseus cluster we\nidentify a previously unseen edge around 850 kpc from the core to the east,\nlying outside a known large scale cold front, which is possibly a bow shock. In\nMKW 3s we find an unusual 'V' shape surface brightness enhancement starting at\nthe cluster core, which may be linked to the AGN jet. In the Crab nebula a new,\nmoving feature in the outer part of the torus is identified which moves across\nthe plane of the sky at a speed of ~0.1c, and lies much further from the\ncentral pulsar than the previous motions seen by Chandra.\n", "  The star phi Dra comprises a spectroscopic binary and a third star that\ntogether form a visual triple system. It is one of the brightest chemically\npeculiar (CP) stars of the upper main sequence. Despite these facts, no\ncomprehensive study of its multiplicity has been performed yet. In this work,\nwe present a detailed analysis of the triple system based on available\nmeasurements. We use radial velocities taken from four sources in the\nliterature in a re-analysis of the inner spectroscopic binary (Aab). An\nincorrect value of the orbital period of the inner system Aab about 27 days was\naccepted in literature more than forty years. A new solution of orbit with the\n128-day period was determined. Relative position measurements of the outer\nvisual binary system (AB) from Washington Double Star Catalog were compared\nwith known orbital models. Furthermore, it was shown that astrometric motion in\nsystem AB is well described by the model of Andrade (2005) with a 308-year\norbital period. Parameters of A and B components were utilized to estimate\nindividual brightness for all components and their masses from evolutionary\ntracks. Although we found several facts which support the gravitational bond\nbetween them, unbound solution cannot be fully excluded yet.\n", "  NGC 6946, known as the Fireworks galaxy because of its high supernova rate\nand high star formation, is embedded in a very extended HI halo. Its northern\nspiral arm is well detached from the galactic main body. We found that this arm\ncontains a large (~300 pc in size) Red Ellipse, named according to a strong\ncontamination of the H-alpha emission line on its optical images. The ellipse\nis accompanied by a short parallel arc and a few others still smaller and less\nregular; a bright star cluster is seen inside these features. The complicated\ncombination of arcs seems to be unique, it is only a bit similar to some SNRs.\nHowever, the long-slit spectral data obtained with the Russian 6-m telescope\ndid not confirm the origin of the nebula as a result of a single SN outburst.\nThe emission-line spectrum corresponds to the photoionization by young hot\nstars with a small contribution of shock ionization. The most likely\nexplanation of the Red Ellipse is a superbbuble created by a collective\nfeedback of massive stars in the star cluster located in the NE side of the Red\nEllipse. However, the very regular elliptical shape of the nebulae seems\nstrange.\n", "  After an extensive assessment of the effective collision strengths available\nto model the He-like triplet of C V, N VI, O VII, Ne IX, Mg XI and Si XIII in\ncollisionally dominated plasmas, new accurate effective collision strengths are\nreported for Ne IX. The uncertainty intervals of the density and temperature\ndiagnostics due to the atomic data errors are also determined for both\nMaxwell-Boltzmann and $\\kappa$ electron-energy distributions. It is shown that\nthese uncertainty bands limit the temperature range where the temperature\nline-ratio diagnostic can be applied and its effectiveness to discern the\nelectron-energy distribution type. These findings are benchmarked with Chandra\nand XMM-Newton spectra of stellar coronae and with tokamak measurements.\n", "  We report an extension of our program to search for radio-quiet BL Lac\ncandidates using intra-night optical variability (INOV) as a probe. The present\nINOV observations cover a well-defined representative set of 10 `radio-quiet\nweak-emission-line quasars' (RQWLQs), selected from a newly published sample of\n46 such sources, derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data release 7).\nIntra-night CCD monitoring of the 10 RQWLQs was carried out in 18 sessions\nlasting at least 3.5 hours. For each session, differential light curves (DLCs)\nof the target RQWLQ were derived relative to two steady comparison stars\nmonitored simultaneously. Combining these new data with those already published\nby us for 15 RQWLQs monitored in 30 sessions, we estimate an INOV duty cycle of\n$\\sim 3\\%$ for the RQWLQs, which appears inconsistent with BL Lacs. However,\nthe observed INOV events (which occurred in just two of the sessions) are\nstrong (with a fractional variability amplitude $\\psi >$ 10\\%), hence\nblazar-like. We briefly point out the prospects of an appreciable rise in the\nestimated INOV duty cycle for RQWLQs with a relatively modest increase in\nsensitivity for monitoring these rather faint objects.\n", "  An electrostatic cryogenic storage ring, CSR, for beams of anions and cations\nwith up to 300 keV kinetic energy per unit charge has been designed,\nconstructed and put into operation. With a circumference of 35 m, the ion-beam\nvacuum chambers and all beam optics are in a cryostat and cooled by a\nclosed-cycle liquid helium system. At temperatures as low as (5.5 $\\pm$ 1) K\ninside the ring, storage time constants of several minutes up to almost an hour\nwere observed for atomic and molecular, anion and cation beams at an energy of\n60 keV. The ion-beam intensity, energy-dependent closed-orbit shifts\n(dispersion) and the focusing properties of the machine were studied by a\nsystem of capacitive pickups. The Schottky-noise spectrum of the stored ions\nrevealed a broadening of the momentum distribution on a time scale of 1000 s.\nPhotodetachment of stored anions was used in the beam lifetime measurements.\nThe detachment rate by anion collisions with residual-gas molecules was found\nto be extremely low. A residual-gas density below 140 cm$^{-3}$ is derived,\nequivalent to a room-temperature pressure below 10$^{-14}$ mbar. Fast atomic,\nmolecular and cluster ion beams stored for long periods of time in a cryogenic\nenvironment will allow experiments on collision- and radiation-induced\nfragmentation processes of ions in known internal quantum states with merged\nand crossed photon and particle beams.\n", "  Even though compressible plasma turbulence is encountered in many\nastrophysical phenomena, its effect is often not well understood. Furthermore,\ndirect numerical simulations are typically not able to reach the extreme\nparameters of these processes. For this reason, large-eddy simulations (LES),\nwhich only simulate large and intermediate scales directly, are employed. The\nsmallest, unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales\nare introduced by means of a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. We propose and verify a\nnew set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES\nof compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We use 15 simulations (without\nexplicit SGS model) of forced, isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with varying\nsonic Mach number $\\mathrm{M_s} = 0.2$ to $20$ as reference data for the most\nextensive \\textit{a priori} tests performed so far in literature. In these\ntests we explicitly filter the reference data and compare the performance of\nthe new closures against the most widely tested closures. These include\neddy-viscosity and scale-similarity type closures with different\nnormalizations. Performance indicators are correlations with the turbulent\nenergy and cross-helicty flux, the average SGS dissipation, the topological\nstructure and the ability to reproduce the correct magnitude and direction of\nthe SGS vectors. We find that only the new nonlinear closures exhibit\nconsistently high correlations (median value \\textgreater$0.8$) with the data\nover the entire parameter space and outperform the other closures in all tests.\nMoreover, we show that these results are independent of resolution and chosen\nfilter scale. Additionally, the new closures are effectively coefficient-free\nwith a deviation of less than $20\\%$.\n", "  The leading explanation for the origin of galactic cosmic rays is particle\nacceleration at the shocks surrounding young supernova remnants (SNRs),\nalthough crucial aspects of the acceleration process are unclear. The similar\ncollisionless plasma shocks frequently encountered by spacecraft in the solar\nwind are generally far weaker (lower Mach number) than these SNR shocks.\nHowever, the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the shock standing in the solar\nwind sunward of Saturn (Saturn's bow shock) can occasionally reach this\nhigh-Mach number astrophysical regime. In this regime Cassini has provided the\nfirst in situ evidence for electron acceleration under quasi-parallel upstream\nmagnetic conditions. Here we present the full picture of suprathermal electrons\nat Saturn's bow shock revealed by Cassini. The downstream thermal electron\ndistribution is resolved in all data taken by the low-energy electron detector\n(CAPS-ELS, <28 keV) during shock crossings, but the higher energy channels were\nat (or close to) background. The high-energy electron detector (MIMI-LEMMS, >18\nkeV) measured a suprathermal electron signature at 31 of 508 crossings, where\ntypically only the lowest energy channels (<100 keV) were above background. We\nshow that these results are consistent with theory in which the \"injection\" of\nthermal electrons into an acceleration process involves interaction with\nwhistler waves at the shock front, and becomes possible for all upstream\nmagnetic field orientations at high Mach numbers like those of the strong\nshocks around young SNRs. A future dedicated study will analyze the rare\ncrossings with evidence for relativistic electrons (up to ~1 MeV).\n", "  We present a new transit timing catalog of 2599 Kepler Objects of Interest\n(=KOIs), using the PDC-MAP long-cadence light curves that include the full\nseventeen quarters of the mission (ftp://wise-\nftp.tau.ac.il/pub/tauttv/TTV/ver_112). The goal is to produce an easy-to-use\ncatalog that can stimulate further analyses of interesting systems. For 779\nKOIs with high enough SNRs, we derived the timing, duration and depth of 69,914\ntransits. For 1820 KOIs with lower SNR, we derived only the timing of 225,273\ntransits. After removal of outlier timings, we derived various statistics for\neach KOI that were used to indicate significant variations. Including systems\nfound by previous works, we have detected 260 KOIs which showed significant\nTTVs with long-term variations (>100 day), and another fourteen KOIs with\nperiodic modulations shorter than 100 day and small amplitudes. For five of\nthose, the periodicity is probably due to the crossing of rotating stellar\nspots by the transiting planets.\n", "  In this paper we consider light-cone fluctuations arising as a consequence of\nthe nontrivial topology of the locally flat cosmic string spacetime. By setting\nthe light-cone along the z-direction we are able to develop a full analysis to\ncalculate the renormalized graviton two-point function, as well as the mean\nsquare fluctuation in the geodesic interval function and the time delay (or\nadvance) in the propagation of a light-pulse. We found that all these\nexpressions depend upon the parameter characterizing the conical topology of\nthe cosmic string spacetime and vanish in the absence of it. We also point out\nthat at large distances from the cosmic string the mean square fluctuation in\nthe geodesic interval function is extremely small while in the opposite limit\nit logarithmically increases, improving the signal and thus, making possible\nthe detection of such quantity.\n", "  Compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is ubiquitous in\nastrophysical phenomena ranging from the intergalactic to the stellar scales.\nIn studying them, numerical simulations are nearly inescapable, due to the\nlarge degree of nonlinearity involved. However the dynamical ranges of these\nphenomena are much larger than what is computationally accessible. In large\neddy simulations (LES), the resulting limited resolution effects are addressed\nexplicitly by introducing to the equations of motion additional terms\nassociated with the unresolved, subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics. This renders the\nsystem unclosed. We derive a set of nonlinear structural closures for the ideal\nMHD LES equations with particular emphasis on the effects of compressibility.\nThe closures are based on a gradient expansion of the finite-resolution\noperator (W.K. Yeo CUP 1993, ed. Galperin & Orszag) and require no assumptions\nabout the nature of the flow or magnetic field. Thus the scope of their\napplicability ranges from the sub- to the hyper-sonic and -Alfvenic regimes.\nThe closures support spectral energy cascades both up and down-scale, as well\nas direct transfer between kinetic and magnetic resolved and unresolved energy\nbudgets. They implicitly take into account the local geometry, and in\nparticular the anisotropy, of the flow. Their properties are $\\textit{a\npriori}$ validated in an accompanying article (Grete et al. Phys. Plasmas,\n2016) against alternative closures available in the literature with respect to\na wide range of simulation data of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.\n", "  We investigate the possible implications of quark deconfinement on the\nphenomenology of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts focusing, in particular, on the\npossibility to describe multiple prompt emission phases in the context of the\nproto-magnetar model. Starting from numerical models of rotating Hadron Stars\nand Quark Stars in full general relativity we track the electromagnetic\nspin-down evolution in both the hadronic and quark phase, linking the two\nfamilies through conservation of baryon number and angular momentum. We give\nestimates of the timescales and the energetics involved in the spin-down\nprocess deriving, in the relevant spin range, the relation between the initial\nand the final masses and rotational energies, whenever hadron-quark conversion\nis possible. We show how the results can be used in relevant astrophysical\ncases such as the double burst GRB 110709B.\n", "  Asteroseismic constraints on K giants make it possible to infer radii, masses\nand ages of tens of thousands of field stars. Tests against independent\nestimates of these properties are however scarce, especially in the metal-poor\nregime. Here, we report the detection of solar-like oscillations in 8 stars\nbelonging to the red-giant branch and red-horizontal branch of the globular\ncluster M4. The detections were made in photometric observations from the K2\nMission during its Campaign 2. Making use of independent constraints on the\ndistance, we estimate masses of the 8 stars by utilising different combinations\nof seismic and non-seismic inputs. When introducing a correction to the Delta\nnu scaling relation as suggested by stellar models, for RGB stars we find\nexcellent agreement with the expected masses from isochrone fitting, and with a\ndistance modulus derived using independent methods. The offset with respect to\nindependent masses is lower, or comparable with, the uncertainties on the\naverage RGB mass (4-10%, depending on the combination of constraints used). Our\nresults lend confidence to asteroseismic masses in the metal poor regime. We\nnote that a larger sample will be needed to allow more stringent tests to be\nmade of systematic uncertainties in all the observables (both seismic and\nnon-seismic), and to explore the properties of RHB stars, and of different\npopulations in the cluster.\n", "  The origin of the unification model for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) was the\ndetection of broad hydrogen recombination lines in the optical polarized\nspectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy (Sy2) NGC 1068. Since then, a search for the\nhidden broad-line region (HBLR) of nearby Sy2s started, but polarized broad\nlines have only been detected in 30-40% of the nearby Sy2s observed to date.\nHere we present new VLT/FORS2 optical spectropolarimetry of a sample of 15\nSy2s, including Compton-thin and Compton-thick sources. The sample includes six\ngalaxies without previously published spectropolarimetry, some of them normally\ntreated as non-hidden BLR (NHBLR) objects in the literature, four classified as\nNHBLR, and five as HBLR based on previous data. We report >=4{\\sigma}\ndetections of a HBLR in 11 of these galaxies (73% of the sample) and a\ntentative detection in NGC 5793, which is Compton-thick according to the\nanalysis of X-ray data performed here. Our results confirm that at least some\nNHBLRs are misclassified, bringing previous publications reporting differences\nbetween HBLR and NHBLR objects into question. We detect broad H{\\alpha} and\nH{\\beta} components in polarized light for 10 targets, and just broad H{\\alpha}\nfor NGC 5793 and NGC 6300, with line widths ranging between 2100 and 9600 km/s.\nHigh bolometric luminosities and low column densities are associated with\nhigher polarization degrees, but not necessarily with the detection of the\nscattered broad components.\n", "  We present a study of the detectability of CO molecules in the Galactic\ninterstellar medium using high-resolution X-ray spectra obtained with the\nXMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer. We analyzed 10 bright low mass\nX-ray binaries (LMXBs) to study the CO contribution in their line-of-sights. A\ntotal of 25 observations were fitted with the ISMabs X-ray absorption model\nwhich includes photoabsorption cross-sections for O I, O II, O III and CO. We\nperformed a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation analysis of the goodness of fit in\norder to estimate the significance of the CO detection. We determine that the\nstatistical analysis prevents a significant detection of CO molecular X-ray\nabsorption features, except for the lines-of-sight toward XTE~J1718-330 and\n4U~1636-53. In the case of XTE~J1817-330, this is the first report of the\npresence of CO along its line-of-sight. Our results reinforce the conclusion\nthat molecules have a minor contribution to the absorption features in the O\nK-edge spectral region. We estimate a CO column density lower limit to perform\na significant detection with XMM-Newton of N(CO) > 6x10^{16} cm-2 for typical\nexposure times\n", "  In this paper we derive and discuss several implications of the analytic form\nof a modified blackbody, also called greybody, which is widely used in\nAstrophysics, and in particular in the study of star formation in the\nfar-infrared/sub-millimeter domain. The research in this area has been greatly\nimproved thanks to recent observations taken with the Herschel satellite, so\nthat it became important to clarify the sense of the greybody approximation, to\nsuggest possible further uses, and to delimi its intervals of validity. First,\nwe discuss the position of the greybody peak, making difference between the\noptically thin and thick regimes. Second, we analyze the behavior of bolometric\nquantities as a function of the different greybody parameters. The ratio\nbetween the bolometric luminosity and the mass of a source, the ratio between\nthe so-called \"sub-millimeter luminosity\" and the bolometric one, and the\nbolometric temperature are observables used to characterize the evolutionary\nstage of a source, and it is of primary importance to have analytic equations\ndescribing the dependence of such quantities on the greybody parameters. Here\nwe discuss all these aspects, providing analytic relations, illustrating\nparticular cases and providing graphical examples. Some equations reported here\nare well-known in Astrophysics, but are often spread over different\npublications. Some of them, instead, are brand new and represent a novelty in\nAstrophysics literature. Finally we indicate an alternative way to obtain,\nunder some conditions, the greybody temperature and dust emissivity directly\nfrom an observing spectral energy distribution, avoiding a best-fit procedure.\n", "  There have recently been several reports of apparently periodic variations in\nthe light curves of quasars, e.g. PG 1302-102 by Graham et al. (2015a). Any\nquasar showing periodic oscillations in brightness would be a strong candidate\nto be a close binary supermassive black hole and, in turn, a candidate for\ngravitational wave studies. However, normal quasars -- powered by accretion\nonto a single, supermassive black hole -- usually show stochastic variability\nover a wide range of timescales. It is therefore important to carefully assess\nthe methods for identifying periodic candidates from among a population\ndominated by stochastic variability. Using a Bayesian analysis of the light\ncurve of PG 1302-102, we find that a simple stochastic process is preferred\nover a sinusoidal variations. We then discuss some of the problems one\nencounters when searching for rare, strictly periodic signals among a large\nnumber of irregularly sampled, stochastic time series, and use simulations of\nquasar light curves to illustrate these points. From a few thousand simulations\nof steep spectrum (`red noise') stochastic processes, we find many simulations\nthat display few-cycle periodicity like that seen in PG 1302-102. We emphasise\nthe importance of calibrating the false positive rate when the number of\ntargets in a search is very large.\n", "  An oblique pulsar magnetosphere with a plasma conductivity is studied by\nusing a pseudo-spectral method. In the pseudo-spectral method, the\ntime-dependent Maxwell equations are solved, both electric and magnetic fields\nare expanded in terms of the vector spherical harmonic (VSH) functions in\nspherical geometry and the divergencelessness of magnetic field is analytically\nenforced by a projection method. The pulsar magnetospheres in infinite (i. e.,\nforce-free approximation) and finite conductivities are simulated and a family\nof solutions that smoothly transition from the Deutsch vacuum solution to the\nforce-free solution are obtained. The $\\sin^2\\alpha$ dependence of the\nspin-down luminosity on the magnetic inclination angle $\\alpha$ in which the\nfull electric current density are taken into account is retrieved in the\nforce-free regime.\n", "  Black-hole masses are crucial to understanding the physics of the connection\nbetween quasars and their host galaxies and measuring cosmic black hole-growth.\nAt high redshift, z > 2.1, black hole masses are normally derived using the\nvelocity-width of the CIV broad emission line, based on the assumption that the\nobserved velocity-widths arise from virial-induced motions. In many quasars,\nthe CIV-emission line exhibits significant blue asymmetries (`blueshifts') with\nthe line centroid displaced by up to thousands of km/s to the blue. These\nblueshifts almost certainly signal the presence of strong outflows, most likely\noriginating in a disc wind. We have obtained near-infrared spectra, including\nthe H$\\alpha$ emission line, for 19 luminous ($L_{Bol}$ = 46.5-47.5 erg/s)\nSloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, at redshifts 2 < z < 2.7, with CIV emission\nlines spanning the full-range of blueshifts present in the population. A strong\ncorrelation between CIV-velocity width and blueshift is found and, at large\nblueshifts, > 2000 km/s, the velocity-widths appear to be dominated by\nnon-virial motions. Black-hole masses, based on the full width at half maximum\nof the CIV-emission line, can be overestimated by a factor of five at large\nblueshifts. A larger sample of quasar spectra with both CIV and H$\\beta$, or\nH$\\alpha$, emission lines will allow quantitative corrections to CIV-based\nblack-hole masses as a function of blueshift to be derived. We find that\nquasars with large CIV blueshifts possess high Eddington luminosity ratios and\nthat the fraction of high-blueshift quasars in a flux-limited sample is\nenhanced by a factor of approximately four relative to a sample limited by\nblack hole mass.\n", "  We report spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of the peculiar nova\nV5852~Sgr (discovered as OGLE-2015-NOVA-01), which exhibits a combination of\nfeatures from different nova classes. The photometry shows a flat-topped light\ncurve with quasi-periodic oscillations, then a smooth decline followed by two\nfainter recoveries in brightness. Spectroscopy with the Southern African Large\nTelescope shows first a classical nova with an Fe II or Fe IIb spectral type.\nIn the later spectrum, broad emissions from helium, nitrogen and oxygen are\nprominent and the iron has faded which could be an indication to the start of\nthe nebular phase. The line widths suggest ejection velocities around\n$1000\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. The nova is in the direction of the Galactic bulge\nand is heavily reddened by an uncertain amount. The $V$ magnitude 16 days after\nmaximum enables a distance to be estimated and this suggests that the nova may\nbe in the extreme trailing stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\nIf so it is the first nova to be detected from that, or from any dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy. Given the uncertainty of the method and the unusual light\ncurve we cannot rule out the possibility that it is in the bulge or even the\nGalactic disk behind the bulge.\n", "  The timing of radio pulsars in binary systems provides a superb testing\nground of general relativity. Here we propose a Bayesian approach to carry out\nthese tests, and a relevant efficient numerical implementation, that has\nseveral conceptual and practical advantages with respect to traditional methods\nbased on least-square-fits that have been used so far: (i) it accounts for the\nactual structure of the likelihood function - and it is not predicated on the\nLaplace approximation which is implicitly built in least-square fits that can\npotentially bias the inference - (ii) it provides the ratio of the evidences of\nany two models under consideration as the statistical quantity to compare\ndifferent theories, and (iii) it allows us to put joint constraints from the\nmonitoring of multiple systems, that can be expressed in terms of ratio of\nevidences or probability intervals of global (thus not system-dependent)\nparameters of the theory, if any exists. Our proposed approach optimally\nexploits the progress in timing of radio pulsars and the increase in the number\nof observed systems. We demonstrate the power of this framework using simulated\ndata sets that are representative of current observations.\n", "  We present deep spectroscopy of three Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) with\nlarge abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs): NGC6153, M1-42 and Hf2-2. The\nspectra were obtained with VLT/UVES and cover the whole optical range\n(3040-11,000 A) with a spectral resolution of ~20,000. For all three PNe,\nseveral hundred emission lines were detected and identified, with more than 70\nper cent of them as permitted lines. Most of these permitted lines are excited\nby recombination. Numerous weak optical recombination lines (ORLs) of O II, C\nII, N II and Ne II were detected in the spectra and accurate fluxes measured.\nLine flux tables were compiled and ready for use by the community of nebular\nastrophysics. These ORLs were critically analyzed using the effective\nrecombination coefficients recently calculated for the optical recombination\nspectrum of N II and O II under the physical conditions of photoionized gaseous\nnebulae. Plasma diagnostics based on the heavy element ORLs were carried out\nusing the new atomic data. Elemental abundances derived from the ORLs were\nsystematically higher than those derived from the collisionally excited lines\n(CELs) by a factor of ~10, 22 and 80 for NGC6153, M1-42 and Hf2-2,\nrespectively. The electron temperatures derived from the heavy element ORLs are\nsystematically lower than those derived from the CELs. These ORL versus CEL\nabundance and temperature discrepancies, previously observed in the three PNe\nthrough deep spectroscopy with medium to low spectral resolution, are thus\nconfirmed by our analysis of the deep echelle spectra using the new atomic\ndata.\n", "  In these introductory lectures we discuss the topic of Yangian symmetry from\nvarious perspectives. Forming the classical counterpart of the Yangian and an\nextension of ordinary Noether symmetries, first the concept of nonlocal charges\nin classical, two-dimensional field theory is reviewed. We then define the\nYangian algebra following Drinfeld's original motivation to construct solutions\nto the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Different realizations of the Yangian and\nits mathematical role as a Hopf algebra and quantum group are discussed. We\ndemonstrate how the Yangian algebra is implemented in quantum, two-dimensional\nfield theories and how its generators are renormalized. Implications of Yangian\nsymmetry on the two-dimensional scattering matrix are investigated. We\nfurthermore consider the important case of discrete Yangian symmetry realized\non integrable spin chains. Finally we give a brief introduction to Yangian\nsymmetry in planar, four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory and indicate its\nimpact on the dilatation operator and tree-level scattering amplitudes. These\nlectures are illustrated by several examples, in particular the two-dimensional\nchiral Gross-Neveu model, the Heisenberg spin chain and N=4 superconformal\nYang-Mills theory in four dimensions. This review arose from lectures given at\nthe Young Researchers Integrability School at Durham University (UK).\n", "  We present spectroscopic observations of six high redshift ($z_{\\rm em}$ $>$\n2) quasars, which have been selected for their Lyman $\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$)\nemission region being only partially covered by a strong proximate ($z_{\\rm\nabs}$ $\\sim$ $z_{\\rm em}$) coronagraphic damped Ly$\\alpha$ system (DLA). We\ndetected spatially extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission envelopes surrounding these six\nquasars, with projected spatial extent in the range 26 $\\le$ $d_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$\n$\\le$ 51 kpc. No correlation is found between the quasar ionizing luminosity\nand the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity of their extended envelopes. This could be\nrelated to the limited covering factor of the extended gas and/or due to the\nAGN being obscured in other directions than towards the observer. Indeed, we\nfind a strong correlation between the luminosity of the envelope and its\nspatial extent, which suggests that the envelopes are probably ionized by the\nAGN. The metallicity of the coronagraphic DLAs is low and varies in the range\n$-$1.75 $<$ [Si/H] $<$ $-$0.63. Highly ionized gas is observed to be associated\nwith most of these DLAs, probably indicating ionization by the central AGN. One\nof these DLAs has the highest AlIII/SiII ratio ever reported for any\nintervening and/or proximate DLA. Most of these DLAs are redshifted with\nrespect to the quasar, implying that they might represent infalling gas\nprobably accreted onto the quasar host galaxies through filaments.\n", "  The spherical harmonics $m$-mode decomposition is a powerful sky map\nreconstruction method suitable for radio interferometers operating in transit\nmode. It can be applied to various configurations, including dish arrays and\ncylinders. We describe the computation of the instrument response function, the\npoint spread function (PSF), transfer function, the noise covariance matrix and\nnoise power spectrum. The analysis in this paper is focused on dish arrays\noperating in transit mode. We show that arrays with regular spacing have more\npronounced side lobes as well as structures in their noise power spectrum,\ncompared to arrays with irregular spacing, specially in the north-south\ndirection. A good knowledge of the noise power spectrum\n$C^{\\mathrm{noise}}(\\ell)$ is essential for intensity mapping experiments as\nnon uniform $C^{\\mathrm{noise}}(\\ell)$ is a potential problem for the\nmeasurement of the HI power spectrum. Different configurations have been\nstudied to optimise the PAON-4 and Tianlai dish array layouts. We present their\nexpected performance and their sensitivities to the 21-cm emission of the Milky\nWay and local extragalactic HI clumps\n", "  We use local numerical simulations to study a vertically stratified accretion\ndisk with a resistive mid-plane that damps magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence. This is an idealized model for the dead zones that may be present\nat some radii in protoplanetary and dwarf novae disks. We vary the relative\nthickness of the dead and active zones to quantify how forced fluid motions in\nthe dead zone change. We find that the residual Reynolds stress near the\nmid-plane decreases with increasing dead zone thickness, becoming negligible in\ncases where the active to dead mass ratio is less than a few percent. This\nimplies that purely Ohmic dead zones would be vulnerable to episodic accretion\noutbursts via the mechanism of Martin & Lubow (2011). We show that even thick\ndead zones support a large amount of kinetic energy, but this energy is largely\nin fluid motions that are inefficient at angular momentum transport. Confirming\nresults from Oishi & Mac Low (2009), the perturbed velocity field in the dead\nzone is dominated by an oscillatory, vertically extended circulation pattern\nwith a low frequency compared to the orbital frequency. This disturbance has\nthe properties predicted for the lowest order r mode in a hydrodynamic disk. We\nsuggest that in a global disk similar excitations would lead to propagating\nwaves, whose properties would vary with the thickness of the dead zone and the\nnature of the perturbations (isothermal or adiabatic). Flows with similar\namplitudes would buckle settled particle layers and could reduce the efficiency\nof pebble accretion.\n", "  Precession has been proposed as an alternative power source for planetary\ndynamos. Previous hydrodynamic simulations suggested that precession can\ngenerate very complex flows in planetary liquid cores [Y. Lin, P. Marti, and J.\nNoir, \"Shear-driven parametric instability in a precessing sphere,\" Physics of\nFluids 27, 046601 (2015)]. In the present study, we numerically investigate the\nmagnetohydrodynamics of a precessing sphere. We demonstrate precession driven\ndynamos in different flow regimes, from laminar to turbulent flows. In\nparticular, we highlight the magnetic field generation by large scale cyclonic\nvortices, which has not been explored previously. In this regime, dynamos can\nbe sustained at relatively low Ekman numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers,\nwhich paves the way for planetary applications.\n", "  We report on variable helium absorption lines in NGC 4151 observed across six\nepochs of quasi-simultaneous near-infrared and optical data. These observations\ncover the transitions from the metastable 2^3S state at 3889 A and 10830 A, and\nfrom the 2^1S state at 20587 A. This is the first AGN absorption line\nvariability study to include measurements of the 20587 A line. The physical\nproperties of the absorber recorded at the fifth observational epoch are\nrelatively well constrained by the presence of absorption in both the optical\nand near-infrared components, with the 10830 A line likely saturated. The\nobservations suggest variations in this absorber's strength are best explained\nby ionization changes in response to a variable incident continuum.\nPhotoionization simulations constrain the total hydrogen number density of the\nepoch 5 absorber to 7.1<log(n_H/cm^-3)<8.8, the hydrogen column density to\n21.2<log(N_H/cm^-2)<23.3 and the ionization parameter range to -1.9<logU<0.4.\nThe simulations also suggest the absorber is located between 0.03 and 0.49 pc\nfrom the continuum emission region. This range in physical properties is\nconsistent with an absorber of similar velocity seen in NGC 4151 from previous\nultraviolet and optical studies, but with high column density X-ray absorbing\ncomponents not present. The mass outflow rate due to the fifth epoch absorber\nis in the range 0.008 to 0.38 M_sun/yr, too low to contribute to galaxy\nfeedback effects.\n", "  We report on a search for steep spectrum radio sources within the 95%\nconfidence error ellipses of the Fermi unassociated sources from the Large\nArray Telescope (LAT). Using existing catalogs and the newly released GMRT\nall-sky survey at 150 MHz we identify compact radio sources that are bright at\nMHz frequencies but faint or absent at GHz frequencies. Such steep spectrum\nradio sources are rare and constitute a sample of pulsar candidates, selected\nindependently of period, dispersion measure, interstellar scattering and\norbital parameters. We find point-like, steep spectrum candidates toward 11\nFermi sources. Based on the gamma-ray/radio positional coincidence, the rarity\nof such radio sources, and the properties of the 3FGL sources themselves, we\nargue that many of these sources could be pulsars. They may have been missed by\nprevious radio periodicity searches due to interstellar propagation effects or\nbecause they lie in an unusually tight binary. If this hypothesis is correct,\nthen renewed gamma-ray and radio periodicity searches at the positions of the\nsteep spectrum radio sources may reveal pulsations.\n", "  Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new\nAbelian forces with new gauge bosons mediating interactions between \"dark\nsectors\" and the Standard Model. We report a search for a dark boson Z'\ncoupling only to the second and third generations of leptons in the reaction\ne+e- -> mu+mu- Z', Z' -> mu+mu- using 514 fb-1 of data collected by the BABAR\nexperiment. No significant signal is observed for Z' masses in the range 0.212\n- 10 GeV. Limits on the coupling parameter g' as low as 7x10^-4 are derived,\nleading to improvements in the bounds compared to those previously derived from\nneutrino experiments.\n", "  We have monitored the massive binary star $\\eta$ Carinae with the CTIO/SMARTS\n1.5~m telescope and CHIRON spectrograph from the previous apastron passage of\nthe system through the recent 2014.6 periastron passage. Our monitoring has\nresulted in a large, homogeneous data set with an unprecedented time-sampling,\nspectral resolving power, and signal-to-noise. This allowed us to investigate\ntemporal variability previously unexplored in the system and discover a\nkinematic structure in the P Cygni absorption troughs of neutral helium wind\nlines. The features observed occurred prior to the periastron passage and are\nseen as we look through the trailing arm of the wind-wind collision shock cone.\nWe show that the bulk of the variability is repeatable across the last five\nperiastron passages, and that the absorption occurs in the inner 230 AU of the\nsystem. In addition, we found an additional, high-velocity absorption component\nsuper-imposed on the P Cygni absorption troughs that has been previously\nun-observed in these lines, but which bears resemblance to the observations of\nthe He~I $\\lambda$10830 \\AA\\ feature across previous cycles. Through a\ncomparison of the current smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations, we show\nthat the observed variations are likely caused by instabilities in the\nwind-wind collision region in our line-of-sight, coupled with stochastic\nvariability related to clumping in the winds.\n", "  A study on the intermediate polar EX Hya is presented, based on simultaneous\nphotometry and high dispersion spectroscopic observations, during four\nconsecutive nights. The strong photometric modulation related to with the\n67-min spin period of the primary star is clearly present, as well as the\nnarrow eclipses associated to the orbital modulation. Since our eclipse timings\nhave been obtained almost 91,000 cycles since the last reported observations,\nwe present new linear ephemeris, although we cannot rule out a sinusoidal\nvariation suggested by previous authors. The system mainly shows double-peaked\nH$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and HeI $\\lambda$5876 \\AA emission lines. From the profile\nof the H$\\alpha$ line, we find two components; one with a steep rise and\nvelocities not larger than $\\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ and another broader component\nextending up to $\\sim$2000 km s$^{-1}$, which we interpret as coming mainly\nfrom the inner disc. A strong and variable hotspot is found and a stream-like\nstructure is seen at times. We show that the best solution correspond to $K_1 =\n58 \\pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$ from H$\\alpha$, from the two emission components, which\nare both in phase with the orbital modulation. We remark on a peculiar effect\nin the radial velocity curve around phase zero, which could be interpreted as a\nRositter-MacLaughlin-like effect, which has been taken into account before\nderiving $K_1$. This value is compatible with the values found in\nhigh-resolution both in the ultraviolet and X-ray. We find: $M_{1} = 0.78 \\pm\n0.03$ M$_{\\odot}$, $ M_{2} = 0.10 \\pm 0.02$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $a = 0.67 \\pm 0.01$\nR$_{\\odot}$. Doppler Tomography has been applied, to construct six Doppler\ntomograms for single orbital cycles spanning the four days of observations to\nsupport our conclusions. Our results indicate that EX Hya has a well formed\ndisc and that the magnetosphere should extend only to about\n$3.75\\,R_{\\rm{WD}}$.\n", "  We have identified a population of passive spiral galaxies from photometry\nand integral field spectroscopy. We selected z<0.035 spiral galaxies that have\nWISE colours consistent with little mid-infrared emission from warm dust.\nMatched aperture photometry of 51 spiral galaxies in ultraviolet, optical and\nmid-infrared show these galaxies have colours consistent with passive galaxies.\nSix galaxies form a spectroscopic pilot study and were observed using the\nWide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to check for signs of nebular emission from\nstar formation. We see no evidence of substantial nebular emission found in\nprevious red spiral samples. These six galaxies possess absorption-line spectra\nwith 4000\\AA\\ breaks consistent with an average luminosity-weighted age of 2.3\nGyr. Our photometric and IFU spectroscopic observations confirm the existence\nof a population of local passive spiral galaxies, implying that transformation\ninto early-type morphologies is not required for the quenching of star\nformation.\n", "  Models of magnetically-driven accretion and outflows reproduce many\nobservational properties of T Tauri stars. This concept is not well established\nfor the more massive Herbig Ae/Be stars. We intend to examine the\nmagnetospheric accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars and search for rotational\nmodulation using spectroscopic signatures, in this first paper concentrating on\nthe well-studied Herbig Ae star HD101412. We used near-infrared spectroscopic\nobservations of the magnetic Herbig Ae star HD101412 to test the magnetospheric\ncharacter of its accretion disk/star interaction. We reduced and analyzed 30\nspectra of HD101412, acquired with the CRIRES and X-shooter spectrographs\ninstalled at the VLT (ESO, Chile). The spectroscopic analysis was based on the\nHe I lambda 10,830 and Pa gamma lines, formed in the accretion region. We found\nthat the temporal behavior of these diagnostic lines in the near-infrared\nspectra of HD101412 can be explained by rotational modulation of line profiles\ngenerated by accreting gas with a period P = 20.53+-1.68 d. The discovery of\nthis period, about half of the magnetic rotation period P_m = 42.076 d\npreviously determined from measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic\nfield, indicates that the accreted matter falls onto the star in regions close\nto the magnetic poles intersecting the line-of-sight two times during the\nrotation cycle. We intend to apply this method to a larger sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars.\n", "  We study affine fusion with the adjoint representation. For simple Lie\nalgebras, elementary and universal formulas determine the decomposition of a\ntensor product of an integrable highest-weight representation with the adjoint\nrepresentation. Using the (refined) affine depth rule, we prove that equally\nstriking results apply to adjoint affine fusion. For diagonal fusion, a\ncoefficient equals the number of nonzero Dynkin labels of the relevant affine\nhighest weight, minus 1. A nice lattice-polytope interpretation follows, and\nallows the straightforward calculation of the genus-1 1-point adjoint Verlinde\ndimension, the adjoint affine fusion tadpole. Explicit formulas, (piecewise)\npolynomial in the level, are written for the adjoint tadpoles of all classical\nLie algebras. We show that off-diagonal adjoint affine fusion is obtained from\nthe corresponding tensor product by simply dropping non-dominant\nrepresentations.\n", "  The production of two-jet final states in deep inelastic scattering is an\nimportant QCD precision observable. We compute it for the first time to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. Our calculation is\nfully differential in the lepton and jet variables and allows one to impose\ncuts on the jets both in the laboratory and the Breit frame. We observe that\nthe NNLO corrections are moderate in size, except at kinematical edges, and\nthat their inclusion leads to a substantial reduction of the scale variation\nuncertainty on the predictions. Our results will enable the inclusion of deep\ninelastic dijet data in precision phenomenology studies.\n", "  We present calculations of the auroral radio powers expected from exoplanets\nwith magnetospheres driven by an Earth-like magnetospheric interaction with the\nsolar wind. Specifically, we compute the twin cell-vortical ionospheric flows,\ncurrents, and resulting radio powers resulting from a Dungey cycle process\ndriven by dayside and nightside magnetic reconnection, as a function of\nplanetary orbital distance and magnetic field strength. We include saturation\nof the magnetospheric convection, as observed at the terrestrial magnetosphere,\nand we present power law approximations for the convection potentials, radio\npowers and spectral flux densities. We specifically consider a solar-age system\nand a young (1 Gyr) system. We show that the radio power increases with\nmagnetic field strength for magnetospheres with saturated convection potential,\nand broadly decreases with increasing orbital distance. We show that the\nmagnetospheric convection at hot Jupiters will be saturated, and thus unable to\ndissipate the full available incident Poynting flux, such that the magnetic\nRadiometric Bode's Law (RBL) presents a substantial overestimation of the radio\npowers for hot Jupiters. Our radio powers for hot Jupiters are $\\sim$5-1300 TW\nfor hot Jupiters with field strengths of 0.1-10 $B_J$ orbiting a Sun-like star,\nwhile we find that competing effects yield essentially identical powers for hot\nJupiters orbiting a young Sun-like star. However, in particular for planets\nwith weaker magnetic fields our powers are higher at larger orbital distances\nthan given by the RBL, and there are many configurations of planet that are\nexpected to be detectable using SKA.\n", "  Minkowski Functionals (MF) are excellent tools to investigate the statistical\nproperties of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) maps. Between their\nnotorious advantages is the possibility to use them efficiently in patches of\nthe CMB sphere, which allow studies in masked skies, inclusive analyses of\nsmall sky regions. Then, possible deviations from Gaussianity are investigated\nby comparison with MF obtained from a set of Gaussian isotropic simulated CMB\nmaps to which are applied the same cut-sky masks. These analyses are sensitive\nenough to detect contaminations of small intensity like primary and secondary\nCMB anisotropies. Our methodology uses the MF, widely employed to study\nnon-Gaussianities in CMB data, and asserts Gaussian deviations only when all of\nthem points out an exceptional $\\chi^2$ value, at more than $2.2 \\sigma$\nconfidence level, in a given sky patch. Following this rigorous procedure, we\nfind 13 regions in the foreground-cleaned Planck maps that evince such high\nlevels of non-Gaussian deviations. According to our results, these non-Gaussian\ncontributions show signatures that can be associated to the presence of hot or\ncold spots in such regions. Moreover, some of these non-Gaussian deviations\nsignals suggest the presence of foreground residuals in those regions located\nnear the galactic plane. Additionally, we confirm that most of the regions\nrevealed in our analyses, but not all, have been recently reported in studies\ndone by the Planck collaboration. Furthermore, we also investigate whether\nthese non-Gaussian deviations can be possibly sourced by systematics, like\ninhomogeneous noise and beam effect in the released Planck data, or perhaps due\nto residual galactic foregrounds.\n", "  We present evidence for a small glitch in the spin evolution of the\nmillisecond pulsar J0613$-$0200, using the EPTA Data Release 1.0, combined with\nJodrell Bank analogue filterbank TOAs recorded with the Lovell telescope and\nEffelsberg Pulsar Observing System TOAs. A spin frequency step of 0.82(3) nHz\nand frequency derivative step of ${-1.6(39) \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{Hz} \\\n\\text{s}^{-1}}$ are measured at the epoch of MJD 50888(30). After PSR\nB1821$-$24A, this is only the second glitch ever observed in a millisecond\npulsar, with a fractional size in frequency of ${\\Delta \\nu/\\nu=2.5(1) \\times\n10^{-12}}$, which is several times smaller than the previous smallest glitch.\nPSR J0613$-$0200 is used in gravitational wave searches with pulsar timing\narrays, and is to date only the second such pulsar to have experienced a glitch\nin a combined 886 pulsar-years of observations. We find that accurately\nmodelling the glitch does not impact the timing precision for pulsar timing\narray applications. We estimate that for the current set of millisecond pulsars\nincluded in the International Pulsar Timing Array, there is a probability of\n$\\sim 50$% that another glitch will be observed in a timing array pulsar within\n10 years.\n", "  HD170582 is an interacting binary of the Double Periodic Variable (DPV) type,\nshowing ellipsoidal variability with a period of 16.87 days along with a long\nphotometric cycle of 587 days. It was recently studied by Mennickent et al.\n(2015), who found a slightly evolved B-type star surrounded by a luminous\naccretion disc fed by a Roche-lobe overflowing A-type giant. Here we extend\ntheir analysis presenting new spectroscopic data and studying the Balmer\nemission lines. We find orbitally modulated double-peak Halpha and Hbeta\nemissions whose strength also vary in the long-term. In addition, Doppler maps\nof the emission lines reveal sites of enhanced line emission in the 1st and 4th\nvelocity quadrants, the first one consistent with the position of one of the\nbright zones detected by the light curve analysis. We find a difference between\nDoppler maps at high and low stage of the long cycle; evidence that the\nemission is optically thicker at high state in the stream-disc impact region,\npossibly reflecting a larger mass transfer rate. We compare the system\nparameters with a grid of synthetic binary evolutionary tracks and find the\nbest fitting model. The system is found to be semi-detached, in a conservative\nCase-B mass transfer stage, with age 7.68E7 yr and mass transfer rate 1.6E-6\nMsun/yr. For 5 well-studied DPVs, the disc luminosity scales with the primary\nmass and is much larger than the theoretical accretion luminosity.\n", "  Nano electromechanical systems are considered as ultra sensitive devices for\nmass and force detection. Capacitive actuation is widely used in these devices\nbut is known to degrade the quality factor of the resonator due to DC\nelectrostatic damping. We report the enhancement of the quality factor of SiC\nvibrating nanowires detected nano optomechanically and electrically by applying\nan AC capacitive driving at a frequency above both the resonance frequency and\nthe electrical cutoff frequency. Self-oscillations are demonstrated for optimal\nconditions. We developed an analytical model of the phenomenon and showed that\nit can lead to an improvement of the force sensitivity. *\nanthony.ayari@univ-lyon1.fr 1\n", "  Constraining the temperature and density structure of dense molecular cloud\ncores is fundamental for understanding the initial conditions of star\nformation. We use Herschel observations of the thermal FIR dust emission from\nnearby isolated molecular cloud cores and combine them with ground-based\nsubmillimeter continuum data to derive observational constraints on their\ntemperature and density structure. The aim of this study is to verify the\nvalidity of a ray-tracing inversion technique developed to derive the dust\ntemperature and density structure of isolated starless cores directly from the\ndust emission maps and to test if the resulting temperature and density\nprofiles are consistent with physical models. Using this ray-tracing inversion\ntechnique, we derive the dust temperature and density structure of six isolated\nstarless cloud cores. We employ self-consistent radiative transfer modeling to\nthe derived density profiles, treating the ISRF as the only heating source. The\nbest-fit values of local strength of the ISRF and the extinction by the outer\nenvelope are derived by comparing the self-consistently calculated temperature\nprofiles with those derived by the ray-tracing method. We find that all\nstarless cores are significantly colder inside than outside, with the core\ntemperatures showing a strong negative correlation with peak column density.\nThis suggests that their thermal structure is dominated by external heating\nfrom the ISRF and shielding by dusty envelopes. The temperature profiles\nderived with the ray-tracing inversion method can be well-reproduced with\nself-consistent radiative transfer models.\n", "  Coherent population trapping (CPT) is extensively studied for future vapor\ncell clocks of high frequency stability. In the constructive polarization\nmodulation CPT scheme, a bichromatic laser field with polarization and phase\nsynchronously modulated is applied on an atomic medium. A high contrast CPT\nsignal is observed in this so-called double-modulation configuration, due to\nthe fact that the atomic population does not leak to the extreme Zeeman states,\nand that the two CPT dark states, which are produced successively by the\nalternate polarizations, add constructively. Here we experimentally investigate\nCPT signal dynamics first in the usual configuration, a single circular\npolarization. The double-modulation scheme is then addressed in both cases: one\npulse Rabi interaction and two pulses Ramsey interaction. The impact and the\noptimization of the experimental parameters involved in the time sequence are\nreviewed. We show that a simple sevenlevel model explains the experimental\nobservations. The double-modulation scheme yields a high contrast similar to\nthe one of other high contrast configurations like push-pull optical pumping or\ncrossed linear polarization scheme, with a setup allowing a higher compactness.\nThe constructive polarization modulation is attractive for atomic clock, atomic\nmagnetometer and high precision spectroscopy applications.\n", "  Debris discs are commonly swathed in gas which can be observed in UV, in fine\nstructure lines in FIR, and in resolved maps of CO emission. Carbon and oxygen\nare overabundant in such gas, but it is severely depleted in hydrogen. As a\nconsequence, its ionisation fraction is remarkably high, suggesting\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes may be important. In particular, the gas\nmay be subject to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and indeed recent\nmodelling of $\\beta$ Pictoris requires an anomalous viscosity to explain the\ngas's observed radial structure. In this paper we explore the possibility that\nthe MRI is active in debris-disc gas and responsible for the observed mass\ntransport. We find that non-ideal MHD and dust-gas interactions play a\nsubdominant role, and that linear instability is viable at certain radii.\nHowever, owing to low gas densities, the outer parts of the disc could be\nstabilised by a weak ambient magnetic field, though it is difficult to\nconstrain such a field. Even if the MRI is stabilised by too strong a field, a\nmagnetocentrifugal wind may be launched in its place and this could lead to\nequivalent (non-turbulent) transport. Numerical simulations of the vertically\nstratified MRI in conditions appropriate to the debris disc gas should be able\nto determine the nature of the characteristic behaviour at different radii, and\ndecide on the importance of the MRI (and MHD more generally) on the evolution\nof these discs.\n", "  In this letter we investigate the effect of boxy/peanut (b/p) bulges on\nbar-induced gas inflow to the central kiloparsec, which plays a crucial role on\nthe evolution of disc galaxies. We carry out hydrodynamic gas response\nsimulations in realistic barred galaxy potentials, including or not the\ngeometry of a b/p bulge, to investigate the amount of gas inflow induced in the\ndifferent models. We find that b/p bulges can reduce the gas inflow rate to the\ncentral kiloparsec by more than an order of magnitude, which leads to a\nreduction in the amount of gas available in the central regions. We also\ninvestigate the effect of the dark matter halo concentration on these results,\nand find that for maximal discs, the effect of b/p bulges on gas inflow remains\nsignificant. The reduced amount of gas reaching the central regions due to the\npresence of b/p bulges could have significant repercussions on the formation of\ndiscy- (pseudo-) bulges, on the amount of nuclear star formation and feedback,\non the fuel reservoir for AGN activity, and on the overall secular evolution of\ngalaxies.\n", "  The common envelope interaction is thought to be the gateway to all evolved\ncompact binaries and mergers. Hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope\ninteraction between giant stars and their companions are restricted to the\ndynamical, fast, in-spiral phase. They find that the giant envelope is lifted\nduring this phase, but remains mostly bound to the system. At the same time,\nthe orbital separation is greatly reduced, but in most simulations it levels\noff? at values larger than measured from observations. We conjectured that\nduring the post-in-spiral phase the bound envelope gas will return to the\nsystem. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we generate initial conditions for our\nsimulation that result in a fall-back disk with total mass and angular momentum\nin line with quantities from the simulations of Passy et al. We find that the\nsimulated fall-back event reduces the orbital separation efficiently, but fails\nto unbind the gas before the separation levels off once again. We also find\nthat more massive fall-back disks reduce the orbital separation more\nefficiently, but the efficiency of unbinding remains invariably very low. From\nthese results we deduce that unless a further energy source contributes to\nunbinding the envelope (such as was recently tested by Nandez et al.), all\ncommon envelope interactions would result in mergers. On the other hand,\nadditional energy sources are unlikely to help, on their own, to reduce the\norbital separation. We conclude by discussing our dynamical fall-back event in\nthe context of a thermally-regulated post-common envelope phase.\n", "  We present the results obtained from a total of 123 ks X-ray (Chandra) and 8\nhrs of 1.4 GHz radio (Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope - GMRT) observations of\nthe cool core cluster ZwCl 2701 (z = 0.214). These observations of ZwCl 2701\nshowed the presence of an extensive pair of ellipsoidal cavities along the East\nand West directions within the central region < 20 kpc. Detection of bright\nrims around the cavities suggested that the radio lobes displaced X-ray\nemitting hot gas forming shell-like structures. The total cavity power\n(mechanical power) that directly heated the surrounding gas and cooling\nluminosity of the cluster were estimated to be ~2.27 x 10^{45} erg\\s and 3.5 x\n10^{44} erg\\s, respectively. Comparable values of cavity power and cooling\nluminosity of ZwCL 2701 suggested that the mechanical power of the AGN outburst\nis large enough to balance the radiative cooling in the system. The star\nformation rate derived from the H_alpha luminosity was found to be ~0.60 M_sun\nyr^{-1} which is about three orders of magnitude lower than the cooling rate of\n~196 M_sun yr^{-1}. Detection of the floor in entropy profile of ZwCl 2701\nsuggested the presence of an alternative heating mechanism at the centre of the\ncluster. Lower value of the ratio (~10^{-2}) between black hole mass accretion\nrate and Eddington mass accretion rate suggested that launching of jet from the\nsuper massive black hole is efficient in ZwCl 2701. However, higher value of\nratio (~10^{3}) between black hole mass accretion rate and Bondi accretion rate\nindicated that the accretion rate required to create cavities is well above the\nBondi accretion rate.\n", "  We analyze by detailed modelling the spectra observed from the sample\ngalaxies at z$\\sim$0.8 presented by Ly et al (2015), constraining the models by\nthe [OIII]5007+4959/[OIII]4363 line ratios. Composite models accounting for\nshock and photoionization by AGN or starburst are adopted. O/H are about solar\nfor all the objects, except for a few AGN clouds with O/H= 0.3 -0.5 solar.\nStarburst models reproduce most of the data within the observational errors.\nAbout half of the object spectra are well fitted by an accreting AGN. Some\ngalaxies show multiple radiation sources, such as starburst+AGN, or a double\nAGN.\n", "  The counter-rotation phenomenon in disc galaxies directly indicates a complex\ngalaxy assembly history which is crucial for our understanding of galaxy\nphysics. Here we present the complex data analysis for a lenticular galaxy NGC\n448, which has been recently suspected to host a counter-rotating stellar\ncomponent. We collected deep long-slit spectroscopic observations using the\nRussian 6-m telescope and performed the photometric decomposition of Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival images. We exploited (i) a non-parametric\napproach in order to recover stellar line-of-sight velocity distributions and\n(ii) a parametric spectral decomposition technique in order to disentangle\nstellar population properties of both main and counter-rotating stellar discs.\nOur spectral decomposition stays in perfect agreement with the photometric\nanalysis. The counter-rotating component contributes $\\approx$30 per cent to\nthe total galaxy light. We estimated its stellar mass to be\n$9.0^{+2.7}_{-1.8}\\cdot10^{9}M_\\odot$. The radial scale length of\ncounter-rotating disc is $\\approx$3 times smaller than that of the main disc.\nBoth discs harbour old stars but the counter-rotating components reveals a\ndetectable negative age gradient that might suggest an extended inside-out\nformation during $3\\dots4$ Gyrs. The counter-rotating disc hosts more\nmetal-rich stars and possesses a shallower metallicity gradient with respect to\nthe main disc. Our findings rule out cosmological filaments as a source of\nexternal accretion which is considered as a potential mechanism of the\ncounter-rotating component formation in NGC 448, and favour the satellite\nmerger event with the consequent slow gas accretion.\n", "  Several dedicated surveys focusing on early-type galaxies (ETGs) reveal that\nsignificant fractions of them are detectable in all interstellar medium phases\nstudied to date. We select ETGs from the Herschel Reference Survey that have\nboth far-infrared Herschel and either HI or CO detection (or both). We derive\ntheir star formation rates (SFR), stellar masses and dust masses via modelling\ntheir spectral energy distributions. We combine these with literature\ninformation on their atomic and molecular gas properties, in order to relate\ntheir star formation, total gas mass and dust mass on global scales. The ETGs\ndeviate from the dust mass-SFR relation and the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation that\nSDSS star forming galaxies define: compared to SDSS galaxies, ETGs have more\ndust at the same SFR, or less SFR at the same dust mass. When placing them in\nthe M*-SFR plane, ETGs show a much lower specific SFR as compared to normal\nstar-forming galaxies. ETGs show a large scatter compared to the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt relation found locally within our Galaxy, extending to lower\nSFRs and gas mass surface densities. Using an ETG's SFR and the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt law to predict its gas mass leads to an underestimate. ETGs\nhave similar observed-gas-to-modelled-dust mass ratios to star forming-galaxies\nof the same stellar mass, as well as they exhibit a similar scatter.\n", "  2,6-lutidine molecules mix with water at high and low temperatures but in a\nwide intermediate temperature range a 2,6-lutidine/water mixture exhibits a\nmiscibility gap. We constructed and validated an atomistic model for\n2,6-lutidine and performed molecular dynamics simulations of 2,6-lutidine/water\nmixture at different temperatures. We determined the part of demixing curve\nwith the lower critical point. The lower critical point extracted from our data\nis located close to the experimental one. The estimates for critical exponents\nobtained from our simulations are in a good agreement with the values\ncorresponding to the $3D$ Ising universality class.\n", "  The Schechter-Valle theorem states that a positive observation of\nneutrinoless double-beta ($0\\nu \\beta \\beta$) decays implies a finite Majorana\nmass term for neutrinos when any unlikely fine-tuning or cancellation is\nabsent. In this note, we reexamine the quantitative impact of the\nSchechter-Valle theorem, and find that current experimental lower limits on the\nhalf-lives of $0\\nu \\beta \\beta$-decaying nuclei have placed a restrictive\nupper bound on the Majorana neutrino mass $|\\delta m^{ee}_\\nu| < 7.43 \\times\n10^{-29}~{\\rm eV}$ radiatively generated at the four-loop level. Furthermore,\nwe generalize this quantitative analysis of $0\\nu \\beta \\beta$ decays to that\nof the lepton-number-violating (LNV) meson decays $M^- \\to {M^\\prime}^+ +\n\\ell^-_\\alpha + \\ell^-_\\beta$ (for $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ = $e$ or $\\mu$). Given the\npresent upper limits on these rare LNV decays, we have derived the loop-induced\nMajorana neutrino masses $|\\delta m^{ee}_\\nu| < 9.7 \\times 10^{-18}~{\\rm eV}$,\n$|\\delta m^{e\\mu}_\\nu| < 1.6 \\times 10^{-15}~{\\rm eV}$ and $|\\delta m^{\\mu\n\\mu}_\\nu| < 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}~{\\rm eV}$ from $K^- \\to \\pi^+ + e^- + e^-$,\n$K^- \\to \\pi^+ + e^- + \\mu^-$ and $K^- \\to \\pi^+ + \\mu^- + \\mu^-$,\nrespectively. A partial list of radiative neutrino masses from the LNV decays\nof $D$, $D_s^{}$ and $B$ mesons is also given.\n", "  We report the detection of high-amplitude X-ray flaring of the AGN HE\n1136-2304, which is accompanied by a strong increase in the flux of the broad\nBalmer lines, changing its Seyfert type from almost type 2 in 1993 down to 1.5\nin 2014. HE 1136-2304 was detected by the XMM-Newton slew survey at >10 times\nthe flux it had in the ROSAT all-sky survey, and confirmed with Swift follow-up\nafter increasing in X-ray flux by a factor of 30. Optical spectroscopy with\nSALT shows that the AGN has changed from a Seyfert 1.95 to a Seyfert 1.5\ngalaxy, with greatly increased broad line emission and an increase in blue\ncontinuum AGN flux by a factor of > 4. The X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR reveal moderate intrinsic absorption and a high energy cutoff at 100\nkeV. We consider several different physical scenarios for a flare, such as\nchanges in obscuring material, tidal disruption events, and an increase in the\naccretion rate. We find that the most likely cause of the increased flux is an\nincrease in the accretion rate, although it could also be due to a change in\nobscuration.\n", "  We explore the impact of star formation and thermal stellar feedback on the\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) population forming in a M83-type barred spiral\ngalaxy. We compare three high-resolution simulations (1.5 pc cell size) with\ndifferent star formation/feedback models: one with no star formation, one with\nstar formation but no feedback, and one with star formation and thermal energy\ninjection. We analyze the resulting population of clouds, finding that we can\nidentify the same population of massive, virialized clouds and transient,\nlow-surface density clouds found in our previous work (that did not include\nstar formation or feedback). Star formation and feedback can affect the mix of\nclouds we identify. In particular, star formation alone simply converts dense\ncloud gas into stars with only a small change to the cloud populations,\nprincipally resulting in a slight decrease in the transient population.\nFeedback, however, has a stronger impact: while it is not generally sufficient\nto entirely destroy the clouds, it does eject gas out of them, increasing the\ngas density in the inter-cloud region. This decreases the number of massive\nclouds, but substantially increases the transient cloud population. We also\nfind that feedback tends to drive a net radial inflow of massive clouds,\nleading to an increase in the star formation rate in the bar region. We examine\na number of possible reasons for this and conclude that it is possible that the\ndrag force from the enhanced intercloud density could be responsible.\n", "  The dark matter (DM) haloes around spiral galaxies appear to conspire with\ntheir baryonic content: empirically, significant amounts of DM are inferred\nonly below a universal characteristic acceleration scale. Moreover, the\ndiscrepancy between the baryonic and dynamical mass, which is usually\ninterpreted as the presence of DM, follows a very tight mass discrepancy\nacceleration (MDA) relation. Its universality, and its tightness in spiral\ngalaxies, poses a challenge for the DM interpretation and was used to argue in\nfavour of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Here, we test whether or not this\napplies to early-type galaxies. We use the dynamical models of fast-rotator\nearly-type galaxies by Cappellari et al. based on ATLAS$^{3D}$ and SLUGGS data,\nwhich was the first homogenous study of this kind, reaching ~4 $R_e$, where DM\nbegins to dominate the total mass budget. We find the early-type galaxies to\nfollow an MDA relation similar to spiral galaxies, but systematically offset.\nAlso, while the slopes of the mass density profiles inferred from galaxy\ndynamics show consistency with those expected from their stellar content\nassuming MOND, some profiles of individual galaxies show discrepancies.\n", "  Many debris discs reveal a two-component structure, with an outer Kuiper-belt\nanalogue and a warm inner component whose origin is still a matter of debate.\nOne possibility is that warm emission stems from an \"asteroid belt\" closer in\nto the star. We consider a scenario in which a set of giant planets is formed\nin an initially extended planetesimal disc. These planets carve a broad gap\naround their orbits, splitting up the disc into the outer and the inner belts.\nAfter the gas dispersal, both belts undergo collisional evolution in a\nsteady-state regime. This scenario is explored with detailed collisional\nsimulations involving realistic physics to describe a long-term collisional\ndepletion of the two-component disc. We find that the inner disc may be able to\nretain larger amounts of material at older ages than thought before on the\nbasis of simplified analytic models. We show that the proposed scenario is\nconsistent with a suite of thermal emission and scattered light observational\ndata for a bright two-temperature debris disc around a nearby solar-type star\nq$^1$ Eridani. This implies a Solar System-like architecture of the system,\nwith an outer massive \"Kuiper belt\", an inner \"asteroid belt\", and a few\nNeptune- to Jupiter-mass planets in between.\n", "  Among asteroid families, the Astrid family is peculiar because of its unusual\ninclination distribution. Objects at $a\\simeq$~2.764 au are quite dispersed in\nthis orbital element, giving the family a \"crab-like\" appearance. Recent works\nshowed that this feature is caused by the interaction of the family with the\n$s-s_C$ nodal secular resonance with Ceres, that spreads the inclination of\nasteroids near its separatrix. As a consequence, the currently observed\ndistribution of the $v_W$ component of terminal ejection velocities obtained\nfrom inverting Gauss equation is quite leptokurtic, since this parameter mostly\ndepends on the asteroids inclination. The peculiar orbital configuration of the\nAstrid family can be used to set constraints on key parameters describing the\nstrength of the Yarkovsky force, such as the bulk and surface density and the\nthermal conductivity of surface material. By simulating various fictitious\nfamilies with different values of these parameters, and by demanding that the\ncurrent value of the kurtosis of the distribution in $v_W$ be reached over the\nestimated lifetime of the family, we obtained that the thermal conductivity of\nAstrid family members should be $\\simeq$ 0.001 W/m/K, and that the surface and\nbulk density should be higher than 1000 kg/m$^{3}$. Monte Carlo methods\nsimulating Yarkovsky and stochastic YORP evolution of the Astrid family show\nits age to be $T$ = 140$\\pm$30 Myr old, in good agreement with estimates from\nother groups. Its terminal ejection velocity parameter is in the range $V_{EJ}=\n5^{+17}_{-5}$~m/s.] Values of $V_{EJ}$ larger than 25 m/s are excluded from\nconstraints from the current inclination distribution.\n", "  The doppler measurements of stars are diluted and distorted by stellar\nactivity noise. Different choices of noise models and statistical methods have\nled to much controversy in the confirmation of exoplanet candidates obtained\nthrough analysing radial velocity data. To quantify the limitation of various\nmodels and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection\ncriteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework.\nAccording to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as\nsignal, leading to false positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are\nlikely to interprete signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find\nthat the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor threshold\nof 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We\nfurther propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modeling radial velocity noise\nto avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives. We propose that\nthe noise model with RHK-dependent jitter is used in combination with the\nmoving average model to detect planetary signals for M dwarfs. Our work may\nalso shed light on the noise modeling for hotter stars, and provide a valid\napproach for finding similar principles in other disciplines.\n", "  We revisit the properties and astrophysical implications of the field white\ndwarf mass distribution in preparation of Gaia applications. Our study is based\non the two samples with the best established completeness and most precise\natmospheric parameters, the volume-complete survey within 20 pc and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) magnitude-limited sample. We explore the modelling of\nthe observed mass distributions with Monte Carlo simulations, but find that it\nis difficult to constrain independently the initial mass function (IMF), the\ninitial-to-final-mass relation (IFMR), the stellar formation history (SFH), the\nvariation of the Galactic disk vertical scale height as a function of stellar\nage, and binary evolution. Each of these input ingredients has a moderate\neffect on the predicted mass distributions, and we must also take into account\nbiases owing to unidentified faint objects (20 pc sample), as well as unknown\nmasses for magnetic white dwarfs and spectroscopic calibration issues (SDSS\nsample). Nevertheless, we find that fixed standard assumptions for the above\nparameters result in predicted mean masses that are in good qualitative\nagreement with the observed values. It suggests that derived masses for both\nstudied samples are consistent with our current knowledge of stellar and\nGalactic evolution. Our simulations overpredict by 40-50% the number of massive\nwhite dwarfs (M > 0.75 Msun) for both surveys, although we can not exclude a\nSalpeter IMF when we account for all biases. Furthermore, we find no evidence\nof a population of double white dwarf mergers in the observed mass\ndistributions.\n", "  Broad relativistic iron lines from neutron star X-ray binaries are important\nprobes of the inner accretion disk. The X-ray reflection features can be\nweakened due to strong magnetic fields or very low iron abundances such as is\npossible in X-ray binaries with low mass, first generation stars as companions.\nHere we investigate the reality of the broad iron line detected earlier from\nthe neutron star low mass X-ray binary 4U~1820--30 with a degenerate helium\ndwarf companion. We perform a comprehensive, systematic broadband spectral\nstudy of the atoll source using \\suzaku{} and simultaneous \\nustar{} \\&\n\\swift{} observations. We have used different continuum models involving\naccretion disk emission, thermal blackbody and thermal Comptonization of either\ndisk or blackbody photons. The \\suzaku{} data show positive and negative\nresiduals in the region of iron K band. These features are well described by\ntwo absorption edges at $7.67\\pm0.14\\kev$ and $6.93\\pm0.07\\kev$ or partial\ncovering photoionized absorption or by blurred reflection. Though, the\nsimultaneous \\swift{} and \\nustar{} data do not clearly reveal the emission or\nabsorption features, the data are consistent with the presence of either\nabsorption or emission features. Thus, the absorption based models provide an\nalternative to the broad iron line or reflection model. The absorption features\nmay arise in winds from the inner accretion disk. The broadband spectra appear\nto disfavour continuum models in which the blackbody emission from the neutron\nstar surface provides the seed photons for thermal Comptonization. Our results\nsuggest emission from a thin accretion disk ($kT_{disk} \\sim 1\\kev$),\nComptonization of disk photons in a boundary layer most likely covering a large\nfraction of the neutron star surface and innermost parts of the accretion disk,\nand blackbody emission ($kT_{bb} \\sim 2\\kev$) from the polar regions.\n", "  The presence of extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) regions in\nintermediate-age star clusters in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds is\noften interpreted as resulting from extended star-formation histories (SFHs),\nlasting $\\geq$ 300 Myr. This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of\nthe dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as\nsingle-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation\nby exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which\nhosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star\nclusters. We show that the width of the NGC 411 SGB favours the single-aged\nstellar population interpretation and rules out an extended SFH. In addition,\nwhen considering the red clump (RC) morphology and adopting the unproven\npremise that the widths of all features in the colour--magnitude diagram are\ndetermined by an underlying range in ages, we find that the SFH implied is\nstill very close to that resulting from a single-aged stellar population, with\na minor fraction of stars scattering to younger ages compared with the bulk of\nthe population. The SFHs derived from the SGB and RC are both inconsistent with\nthe SFH derived from the eMSTO region. NGC 411 has a very low escape velocity\nand it has unlikely undergone significant mass loss at an early stage, thus\nindicating that it may lack the capacity to capture most of its initial,\nexpelled gas from stellar evolutionary processes, a condition often required\nfor extended SFHs to take root.\n", "  Using the recent INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT surveys we have extracted a\nsample of 64 confirmed plus 3 candidate radio galaxies selected in the soft\ngamma-ray band. The sample covers all optical classes and is dominated by\nobjects showing a FR II radio morphology; a large fraction (70%) of the sample\nis made of radiative mode or High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERG). We have\nmeasured the source size on NVSS, FIRST and SUMSS images and have compared our\nfindings with data in the literature obtaining a good match. We surprisingly\nfound that the soft gamma-ray selection favours the detection of large size\nradio galaxies: 60% of objects in the sample have size greater than 0.4 Mpc\nwhile around 22% reach dimension above 0.7 Mpc at which point they are\nclassified as Giant Radio Galaxies or GRGs, the largest and most energetic\nsingle entities in the Universe. Their fraction among soft gamma ray selected\nradio galaxies is significantly larger than typically found in radio surveys,\nwhere only a few percent of objects (1-6%) are GRGs. This may partly be due to\nobservational biases affecting radio surveys more than soft gamma ray surveys,\nthus disfavouring the detection of GRGs at lower frequencies. The main reasons\nand/or conditions leading to the formation of these large radio structures are\nstill unclear with many parameters such as high jet power, long activity time\nand surrounding environment all playing a role; the first two may be linked to\nthe type of AGN discussed in this work and partly explain the high fraction of\nGRGs found in the present sample. Our result suggests that high energy surveys\nmay be a more efficient way than radio surveys to find these peculiar objects.\n", "  The existence of long (> 100 kpc) HI streams and small (< 20 kpc)\nfree-floating HI clouds is well-known. While the formation of the streams has\nbeen investigated extensively, and the isolated clouds are often purported to\nbe interaction debris, little research has been done on the formation of\noptically dark HI clouds that are not part of a larger stream. One possibility\nis that such features result from the fragmentation of more extended streams,\nwhile another idea is that they are primordial, optically dark galaxies. We\ntest the validity of the fragmentation scenario (via harassment) using\nnumerical simulations. In order to compare our numerical models with\nobservations, we present catalogues of both the known long HI streams (42\nobjects) and free-floating HI clouds suggested as dark galaxy candidates (51\nobjects). In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to form compact\nfeatures with high velocity widths (> 100 km/s), similar to observed clouds\nwhich are otherwise intriguing dark galaxy candidates. We find that producing\nsuch features is possible but extremely unlikely, occurring no more than 0.2%\nof the time in our simulations. In contrast, we find that genuine dark galaxies\ncould be extremely stable to harassment and remain detectable even after 5 Gyr\nin the cluster environment (with the important caveat that our simulations only\nexplore harassment and do not yet include the intracluster medium, heating and\ncooling, or star formation). We also discuss the possibility that such objects\ncould be the progenitors of recently discovered ultra diffuse galaxies.\n", "  In order to investigate the role of absorption in AGN with jets, we have\nstudied the column density distribution of a hard X-ray selected sample of\nradio galaxies, derived from the INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/BAT AGN catalogues\n(~7-10% of the total AGN population). The 64 radio galaxies have a typical FRII\nradio morphology and are characterized by high 20-100 keV luminosities (from\n10^42 to 10^46 erg/s) and high Eddington ratios (Log L_{Bol}/L_{Edd} typically\nlarger than ~0.01). The observed fraction of absorbed AGN (N_{H} > 10^{22}\ncm^{-2}) is around 40% among the total sample, and ~75% among type 2 AGN. The\nmajority of obscured AGN are narrow line objects, while unobscured AGN are\nbroad line objects, obeying to the zeroth-order predictions of unified models.\nA significant anti-correlation between the radio core dominance parameter and\nthe X-ray column density is found. The observed fraction of Compton thick AGN\nis ~2-3%, in comparison with the 5-7% found in radio-quiet hard X-ray selected\nAGN. We have estimated the absorption and Compton thick fractions in a hard\nX-ray sample containing both radio galaxies and non-radio galaxies and\ntherefore affected by the same selection biases. No statistical significant\ndifference was found in the absorption properties of radio galaxies and non\nradio galaxies sample. In particular, the Compton thick objects are likely\nmissing in both samples and the fraction of obscured radio galaxies appears to\ndecrease with luminosity as observed in hard X-ray non-radio galaxies.\n", "  The two-photon luminescence (TPL) of small 10 nm x 40 nm colloidal gold\nnanorods (GNR) is investigated at the single object level, combining\npolarization resolved TPL and simultaneously acquired topography. A very high\ndependence of the TPL signal with both the nanorods longitudinal axis and the\nincident wavelength is observed confirming the plasmonic origin of the signal\nand pointing the limit of the analogy between GNRs and molecules. The spectral\nanalysis of the TPL evidences two emission bands peaks: in the visible (in\ndirect connection with the gold band structure), and in the infrared. Both\nbands are observed to vary quadradically with the incident excitation beam but\nexhibit different polarization properties. The maximum two-photon brightness of\na single GNR is measured to be a few millions higher than the two-photon\nbrightness of fluorescein molecules. We show that the important TPL observed in\nthese small gold nanorods results from resonance effects both at the excitation\nand emission level : local field enhancement at the longitudinal surface\nplasmon resonances (LSPR) first results in an increase of the electron-hole\ngeneration. Further relaxation of electron-hole pairs then mostly leads to the\nexcitation of the GNR transverse plasmon mode and its subsequent radiative\nrelaxation.\n", "  The interplay between charge density waves (CDWs) and high-temperature\nsuperconductivity is currently under intense investigation. Experimental\nresearch on this issue is difficult because CDW formation in bulk copper-oxides\nis strongly influenced by random disorder, and a long-range-ordered CDW state\nin high magnetic fields is difficult to access with spectroscopic and\ndiffraction probes. Here we use resonant x-ray scattering in zero magnetic\nfield to show that interfaces with the metallic ferromagnet\nLa$_{2/3}$Ca$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ greatly enhance CDW formation in the optimally\ndoped high-temperature superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\\delta}$ ($\\bf \\delta\n\\sim 1$), and that this effect persists over several tens of nm. The wavevector\nof the incommensurate CDW serves as an internal calibration standard of the\ncharge carrier concentration, which allows us to rule out any significant\ninfluence of oxygen non-stoichiometry, and to attribute the observed phenomenon\nto a genuine electronic proximity effect. Long-range proximity effects induced\nby heterointerfaces thus offer a powerful method to stabilize the charge\ndensity wave state in the cuprates, and more generally, to manipulate the\ninterplay between different collective phenomena in metal oxides.\n", "  A significant advance in magnetic field management in a fully assembled\nsuperconducting radiofrequency cryomodule has been achieved and is reported\nhere. Demagnetization of the entire cryomodule after assembly is a crucial step\ntoward the goal of field less than 5x10-7 Tesla. An explanation of the basic\nphysics of demagnetization as well as experimental results are presented.\n", "  We analyze a sample of 73 old long-period comets (LPCs) (orbital periods $200\n< P < 1000$ yr) with perihelion distances $q < 2.5$ au, discovered in the\nperiod 1850-2014. We cloned the observed comets and also added fictitious LPCs\nwith perihelia in the Jupiter's zone. We consider both a purely dynamical\nevolution and a physico-dynamical one with different physical lifetimes. We can\nfit the computed energy distribution of comets with $q < 1.3$ au to the\nobserved one only within the energy range $0.01 < x < 0.04$ au$^{-1}$ (or\nperiods $125 < P < 1000$ yr), where the \"energy\" is taken as the inverse of the\nsemimajor axis $a$, namely $x \\equiv 1/a$. The best results are obtained for\nphysical lifetimes of about 200-300 revolutions (for a comet with a standard $q\n= 1$ au). We find that neither a purely dynamical evolution, nor a\nphysico-dynamical one can reproduce the long tail of larger binding energies\n($x \\gsim 0.04$ au$^{-1}$) that correspond to most Halley-type comets (HTCs)\nand Jupiter-family comets. We conclude that most HTCs are not the end states of\nthe evolution of LPCs, but come from a different source, a flattened one that\nwe identify with the Centaurs that are scattered to the inner planetary region\nfrom the trans-Neptunian belt. These results also show that the boundary\nbetween LPCs and HTCs should be located at an energy $x \\sim 0.04$ au$^{-1}$\n($P \\sim 125$ yr), rather than the conventional classical boundary at $P = 200$\nyr.\n", "  We describe a statistical approach for measuring the influence that a\ngalaxy's closest companion has on the galaxy's properties out to arbitrarily\nwide separations. We begin by identifying the closest companion for every\ngalaxy in a large spectroscopic sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We\nthen characterize the local environment of each galaxy by using the number of\ngalaxies within 2 Mpc and by determining the isolation of the galaxy pair from\nother neighbouring galaxies. We introduce a sophisticated algorithm for\ncreating a statistical control sample for each galaxy, matching on stellar\nmass, redshift, local density and isolation. Unlike traditional studies of\nclose galaxy pairs, this approach is effective in a wide range of environments,\nregardless of how far away the closest companion is (although a very distant\nclosest companion is unlikely to have a measurable influence on the galaxy in\nquestion). We apply this methodology to measurements of galaxy asymmetry, and\nfind that the presence of nearby companions drives a clear enhancement in\ngalaxy asymmetries. The asymmetry excess peaks at the smallest projected\nseparations (< 10 kpc), where the mean asymmetry is enhanced by a factor of 2.0\n$\\pm$ 0.2. Enhancements in mean asymmetry decline as pair separation increases,\nbut remain statistically significant (1-2$\\sigma$) out to projected separations\nof at least 50 kpc.\n", "  The birth of the first luminous sources and the ensuing epoch of reionization\nare best studied via the redshifted 21-cm emission line, the signature of the\nfirst two imprinting the last. In this work we present a fully-Bayesian method,\n\\textsc{hibayes}, for extracting the faint, global (sky-averaged) 21-cm signal\nfrom the much brighter foreground emission. We show that a simplified (but\nplausible), Gaussian model of the 21-cm emission from the Cosmic Dawn epoch\n($15 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 30$), parameterized by an amplitude $A_{\\rm HI}$, a\nfrequency peak $\\nu_{\\rm HI}$ and a width $\\sigma_{\\rm HI}$, can be extracted\neven in the presence of a structured foreground frequency spectrum\n(parameterized as a $7^{\\rm th}$-order polynomial), provided sufficient\nsignal-to-noise (400~hours of observation with a single dipole). We apply our\nmethod to an early, 19-minute long observation from the Large aperture\nExperiment to detect the Dark Ages, constraining the 21-cm signal amplitude and\nwidth to be $-890 < A_{\\rm HI} < 0$ mK and $\\sigma_{\\rm HI} > 6.5$ MHz\n(corresponding to $\\Delta z > 1.9$ at redshift $z \\simeq 20$) respectively at\nthe 95-per-cent confidence level in the range $13.2 < z < 27.4$ ($100 > \\nu >\n50$ MHz).\n", "  We present a line survey of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Arp 220, taken\nwith the newly installed SEPIA Band 5 instrument on APEX. We illustrate the\ncapacity of SEPIA to detect the 183.3 GHz H2O 31,3-22,0 line against the\natmospheric H2O absorption feature. We confirm the previous detection of the\nHCN(2-1) line, and detect new transitions of standard dense gas tracers such as\nHNC(2-1), HCO+(2-1), CS(4-3), C34S(4-3), HC3N(20-19). We also detect HCN(2-1)\nv2=1 and the 193.5 GHz methanol (4-3) group for the first time. The absence of\ntime variations in the megamaser water line compared to previous observations\nseems to rule out an AGN nuclear origin for the line. It could, on the\ncontrary, favor a thermal origin instead, but also possibly be a sign that the\nmegamaser emission is associated with star-forming cores washed-out in the\nbeam. We finally discuss how the new transitions of HCN, HNC, HCO+ refine our\nknowledge of the ISM physical conditions in Arp 220.\n", "  We use the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study\nhow the HI content of present-day galaxies depends on their environment. We\nshow that EAGLE reproduces observed HI mass-environment trends very well, while\nsemi-analytic models typically overpredict the average HI masses in dense\nenvironments. The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for\nthe HI content of satellites with stellar mass Mstar>10^9 Msun. At a fixed\nMstar, the fraction of HI-depleted satellites increases with increasing host\nhalo mass M200 in response to stronger environmental effects, while at a fixed\nM200 it decreases with increasing satellite Mstar as the gas is confined by\ndeeper gravitational potentials. HI-depleted satellites reside mostly, but not\nexclusively, within the virial radius r200 of their host halo. We investigate\nthe origin of these trends by focussing on three environmental mechanisms: ram\npressure stripping by the intra-group medium, tidal stripping by the host halo,\nand satellite-satellite encounters. By tracking back in time the evolution of\nthe HI-depleted satellites, we find that the most common cause of HI removal is\nsatellite encounters. The timescale for HI removal is typically less than 0.5\nGyr. Tidal stripping occurs in halos of M200<10^{14} Msun within half r200,\nwhile the other processes act also in more massive halos, generally within\nr200. Conversely, we find that ram pressure stripping is the most common\nmechanism that disturbs the HI morphology of galaxies at redshift z=0. This\nimplies that HI removal due to satellite-satellite interactions occurs on\nshorter timescales than the other processes.\n", "  We report the results of a Green Bank Telescope survey for water masers,\nammonia (1,1) and (2,2), and the H66-alpha recombination line toward 506\nluminous compact 24 micron-emitting regions in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). We\ninclude the 206 sources observed in the Darling (2011) water maser survey for\ncompleteness. The survey was sensitive enough to detect any maser useful for\n~10 microarcsecond/yr astrometry. No new water masers, ammonia lines, or\nH66-alpha recombination lines were detected individually or in spectral stacks\nreaching rms noise levels of ~3 mJy and ~0.2 mJy, respectively, in 3.1-3.3 km/s\nchannels. The lack of detections in individual spectra and in the spectral\nstacks is consistent with Galactic extrapolations. Contrary to previous\nassertions, there do not seem to be additional bright water masers to be found\nin M31. The strong variability of water masers may enable new maser detections\nin the future, but variability may also limit the astrometric utility of known\n(or future) masers since flaring masers must also fade.\n", "  This is the third installment in a series of papers in which we investigate\ncalibration artefacts. Calibration artefacts (also known as ghosts or spurious\nsources) are created when we calibrate with an incomplete model. In the first\ntwo papers of this series we developed a mathematical framework which enabled\nus to study the ghosting mechanism itself. An interesting concomitant of the\nsecond paper was that ghosts appear in symmetrical pairs. This could possibly\naccount for spurious symmetrization. Spurious symmetrization refers to the\nappearance of a spurious source (the anti-ghost) symmetrically opposite an\nunmodelled source around a modelled source. The analysis in the first two\npapers indicates that the anti-ghost is usually very faint, in particular when\na large number of antennas are used. This suggests that spurious symmetrization\nwill mainly occur at an almost undetectable flux level. In this paper, we show\nthat phase-only calibration produces an anti-ghost that is $N$-times (where $N$\ndenotes the number of antennas in the array) as bright as the one produced by\nphase and amplitude calibration and that this already bright ghost can be\nfurther amplified by the primary beam correction.\n", "  We reconsider perturbative unitarity in quantum field theory and upgrade\nseveral arguments and results. The minimum assumptions that lead to the largest\ntime equation, the cutting equations and the unitarity equation are identified.\nUsing this knowledge and a special gauge, we give a new, simpler proof of\nperturbative unitarity in gauge theories and generalize it to quantum gravity,\nin four and higher dimensions. The special gauge interpolates between the\nFeynman gauge and the Coulomb gauge without double poles. When the Coulomb\nlimit is approached, the unphysical particles drop out of the cuts and the\ncutting equations are consistently projected onto the physical subspace. The\nproof does not extend to nonlocal quantum field theories of gauge fields and\ngravity, whose unitarity remains uncertain.\n", "  The spins of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and the power outputs of their\njets are measurable quantities. Unfortunately, the currently employed methods\ndo not agree and the results are controversial. Two major issues concern the\nmeasurements of BH spin and beam (jet) power. The former issue can be resolved\nby future observations. But the latter issue can be resolved now, if we pay\nattention to what is expected from theoretical considerations. The question of\nwhether a correlation has been found between the power outputs of few objects\nand the spins of their BHs is moot because BH beam power does not scale with\nthe square of the spin of the BH. We show that the theoretical BH beam power is\na strongly nonlinear function of spin that cannot be approximated by a\nquadratic relation, as is generally stated when the influence of the magnetic\nfield is not accounted for in the \\cite{bla77} model. The BH beam power of\nballistic jets should scale a lot more steeply with BH spin irrespective of the\nmagnetic field assumed to thread the horizon and the spin range considered.\nThis behavior may already be visible in the analyses of radio observations by\n\\cite{nar12} and \\cite{rus13}. In agreement with previous studies, we also find\nthat the power output that originates in the inner regions of the surrounding\naccretion disks is higher than that from the BHs and it cannot be ignored in\ninvestigations of continuous compact jets from these systems.\n", "  We present a proof-of-concept study of a method to estimate the inclination\nangle of compact high velocity clouds (CHVCs), i.e. the angle between a CHVC's\ntrajectory and the line-of-sight. The inclination angle is derived from the\nCHVC's morphology and kinematics. We calibrate the method with numerical\nsimulations, and we apply it to a sample of CHVCs drawn from HIPASS.\nImplications for CHVC distances are discussed.\n", "  We present a dimensionless index that quantifies the degree of cloudiness of\nthe atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet. Our cloudiness index is based on\nmeasuring the transit radii associated with the line center and wing of the\nsodium or potassium line. In deriving this index, we revisited the algebraic\nformulae for inferring the isothermal pressure scale height from transit\nmeasurements. We demonstrate that the formulae of Lecavelier et al. and Benneke\n& Seager are identical: the former is inferring the temperature while assuming\na value for the mean molecular mass and the latter is inferring the mean\nmolecular mass while assuming a value for the temperature. More importantly,\nthese formulae cannot be used to distinguish between cloudy and cloudfree\natmospheres. We derive values of our cloudiness index for a small sample of 7\nhot Saturns/Jupiters taken from Sing et al. We show that WASP-17b, WASP-31b and\nHAT-P-1b are nearly cloudfree at visible wavelengths. We find the tentative\ntrend that more irradiated atmospheres tend to have less clouds consisting of\nsub-micron-sized particles. We also derive absolute sodium and/or potassium\nabundances $\\sim 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$ for WASP-17b, WASP-31b and HAT-P-1b (and upper\nlimits for the other objects). Higher-resolution measurements of both the\nsodium and potassium lines, for a larger sample of exoplanetary atmospheres,\nare needed to confirm or refute this trend.\n", "  Asymmetries in the neutral hydrogen gas distribution and kinematics of\ngalaxies are thought to be indicators for both gas accretion and gas removal\nprocesses. These are of fundamental importance for galaxy formation and\nevolution. Upcoming large blind HI surveys will provide tens of thousands of\ngalaxies for a study of these asymmetries in a proper statistical way. Due to\nthe large number of expected sources and the limited resolution of the majority\nof objects, detailed modelling is not feasible for most detections. We need\nfast, automatic and sensitive methods to classify these objects in an objective\nway. Existing non-parametric methods suffer from effects like the dependence on\nsignal to noise, resolution and inclination. Here we show how to correctly take\nthese effects into account and show ways to estimate the precision of the\nmethods. We will use existing and modelled data to give an outlook on the\nperformance expected for galaxies observed in the various sky surveys planned\nfor e.g. WSRT/APERTIF and ASKAP.\n", "  Streaking of photoelectrons has long been used for the temporal\ncharacterization of attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses. When the\ntime-resolved photoelectrons originate from a coherent superposition of\nelectronic states, they carry an additional phase information, which can be\nretrieved by the streaking technique. In this contribution we extend the\nstreaking formalism to include coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in\nmolecules as well as initial coherences and demonstrate how it offers a novel\ntool to monitor non-adiabatic dynamics as it occurs in the vicinity of conical\nintersections and avoided crossings. Streaking can enhance the time resolution\nand provide direct signatures of electronic coherences, which affect many\nprimary photochemical and biological events.\n", "  We present an orbital solution study for the newly discovered system 1SWASP\nJ080150.03+471433.8 by means of new CCD observations in VRI bands. Our\nobservations were carried out on 25 Feb. 2013 using the Kottamia optical\ntelescope at NRIAG, Egypt. 12 new times of minima were estimated and the\nobserved light curves were analysed using the Wilson-Devinney code. The\naccepted orbital solution reveals that the primary component of is more massive\nand hotter than the secondary one by about 280K. The system is an over-contact\none with fillout ratio ~ 29% and is located at a distance of 195 Pc. The\nevolutionary status of the system is investigated by means of stellar models\nand empirical data.\n", "  We highlight the main results of a three-dimensional (3D) multilevel\nradiative transfer investigation about the solar disk-center polarization of\nthe Ca {\\sc ii} 8542 \\AA\\ line. First, we investigate the linear polarization\ndue to the atomic level polarization produced by the absorption and scattering\nof anisotropic radiation in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere, taking into\naccount the symmetry breaking effects caused by its thermal, dynamic and\nmagnetic structure. Second, we study the contribution of the Zeeman effect to\nthe linear and circular polarization. Finally, we show examples of the Stokes\nprofiles produced by the joint action of atomic level polarization and the\nHanle and Zeeman effects. We find that the Zeeman effect tends to dominate the\nlinear polarization signals only in the localized patches of opposite magnetic\npolarity where the magnetic field is relatively strong and slightly inclined,\nwhile outside such very localized patches the linear polarization is often\ndominated by the contribution of atomic level polarization. We demonstrate that\na correct modeling of this last contribution requires taking into account the\nsymmetry breaking effects caused by the thermal, dynamic and magnetic structure\nof the solar atmosphere, and that in the 3D model used the Hanle effect in\nforward-scattering geometry (disk center observation) mainly reduces the\npolarization corresponding to the zero-field case. We emphasize that, in\ngeneral, a reliable modeling of the linear polarization in the Ca {\\sc ii} 8542\n\\AA\\ line requires taking into account the joint action of atomic level\npolarization and the Hanle and Zeeman effects.\n", "  After several years of quiescence, the blazar CTA 102 underwent an\nexceptional outburst in 2012 September-October. The flare was tracked from\ngamma-ray to near-infrared frequencies, including Fermi and Swift data as well\nas photometric and polarimetric data from several observatories. An intensive\nGASP-WEBT collaboration campaign in optical and NIR bands, with an addition of\npreviously unpublished archival data and extension through fall 2015, allows\ncomparison of this outburst with the previous activity period of this blazar in\n2004-2005. We find remarkable similarity between the optical and gamma-ray\nbehaviour of CTA 102 during the outburst, with a time lag between the two light\ncurves of ~1 hour, indicative of co-spatiality of the optical and gamma-ray\nemission regions. The relation between the gamma-ray and optical fluxes is\nconsistent with the SSC mechanism, with a quadratic dependence of the SSC\ngamma-ray flux on the synchrotron optical flux evident in the post-outburst\nstage. However, the gamma-ray/optical relationship is linear during the\noutburst; we attribute this to changes in the Doppler factor. A strong\nharder-when-brighter spectral dependence is seen both the in gamma-ray and\noptical non-thermal emission. This hardening can be explained by convexity of\nthe UV-NIR spectrum that moves to higher frequencies owing to an increased\nDoppler shift as the viewing angle decreases during the outburst stage. The\noverall pattern of Stokes parameter variations agrees with a model of a\nradiating blob or shock wave that moves along a helical path down the jet.\n", "  We present the discovery of seven new proplyds (i.e. sources surrounded by\ncometary Halpha emission characteristic of offset ionization fronts) in NGC\n1977, located about 30' north of the Orion Nebula Cluster at a distance of ~400\npc. Each of these proplyds are situated at projected distances 0.04-0.27 pc\nfrom the B1V star 42 Orionis (c Ori), which is the main source of UV photons in\nthe region. In all cases the ionization fronts of the proplyds are clearly\npointing toward the common ionizing source, 42 Ori, and 6 of the 7 proplyds\nclearly show tails pointing away from it. These are the first proplyds to be\nfound around a B star, with previously known examples instead being located\naround O stars, including those in the Orion Nebula Cluster around $\\theta^1$\nOri C. The radii of the offset ionization fronts in our proplyds are between\n~200 and 550 AU; two objects also contain clearly resolved central sources that\nwe associate with disks of radii 50-70 AU. The estimated strength of the FUV\nradiation field impinging on the proplyds is around 10-30 times less than that\nincident on the classic proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We show that the\nobserved proplyd sizes are however consistent with recent models for FUV\nphotoevaporation in relatively weak FUV radiation fields.\n", "  We introduce a general mathematical framework to model the internal transport\nof angular momentum in a star hosting a close-in planetary/stellar companion.\nBy assuming that the tidal and rotational distortions are small and that the\ndeposit/extraction of angular momentum induced by stellar winds and tidal\ntorques are redistributed solely by an effective eddy-viscosity that depends on\nthe radial coordinate, we can formulate the model in a completely analytic way.\nIt allows us to compute simultaneously the evolution of the orbit of the\ncompanion and of the spin and the radial differential rotation of the star. An\nillustrative application to the case of an F-type main-sequence star hosting a\nhot Jupiter is presented. The general relevance of our model to test more\nsophisticated numerical dynamical models and to study the internal rotation\nprofile of exoplanet hosts, submitted to the combined effects of tides and\nstellar winds, by means of asteroseismology are discussed.\n", "  We present analytical results for the $N_f^4$ and $N_f^3$ terms of the\nfive-loop Beta function, for a general gauge group. While the former term\nagrees with results available from large-$N_f$ studies, the latter is new and\nextends the value known for SU(3) from an independent calculation.\n", "  Charges in conjugated polymer materials have a strong impact on the\nphotophysics and their interaction with the primary excited state species has\nto be taken into account in understanding device properties. Here, we employ\nsingle-molecule spectroscopy to unravel the influence of charges on several\nphotoluminescence (PL) observables. The charges are injected either\nstochastically by a photochemical process, or deterministically in a\nhole-injection sandwich device configuration. We find that upon charge\ninjection, besides a blue-shift of the PL emission and a shortening of the PL\nlifetime due to quenching and blocking of the lowest-energy chromophores, the\nnon-classical photon arrival time distribution of the multichromophoric chain\nis modified towards a more classical distribution. Surprisingly, the fidelity\nof photon antibunching deteriorates upon charging, whereas one would actually\nexpect the number of chromophores to be reduced. A qualitative model is\npresented to explain the observed PL changes. The results are of interest to\ndeveloping a microscopic understanding of the intrinsic charge-exciton\nquenching interaction in devices.\n", "  The pressure effects on the antiferromagentic orders in iron-based ladder\ncompounds CsFe$_2$Se$_3$ and BaFe$_2$S$_3$ have been studied using neutron\ndiffraction. With identical crystal structure and similar magnetic structures,\nthe two compounds exhibit highly contrasting magnetic behaviors under moderate\nexternal pressures. In CsFe$_2$Se$_3$ the ladders are brought much closer to\neach other by pressure, but the stripe-type magnetic order shows no observable\nchange. In contrast, the stripe order in BaFe$_2$S$_3$, undergoes a quantum\nphase transition where an abrupt increase of N$\\acute{e}$el temperature by more\nthan 50$\\%$ occurs at about 1 GPa, accompanied by a jump in the ordered moment.\nWith its spin structure unchanged, BaFe$_2$S$_3$ enters an enhanced magnetic\nphase that bears the characteristics of an orbital selective Mott phase, which\nis the true neighbor of superconductivity emerging at higher pressures.\n", "  We observed Kepler-421 during the anticipated third transit of the snow-line\nexoplanet Kepler-421b in order to constrain the existence and extent of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs). Previously, the Kepler Spacecraft only observed two\ntransits of Kepler-421b leaving the planet's transit ephemeris unconstrained.\nOur visible light, time-series observations from the 4.3-meter Discovery\nChannel Telescope were designed to capture pre-transit baseline and the partial\ntransit of Kepler-421b barring significant TTVs. We use the light curves to\nassess the probabilities of various transit models using both the posterior\nodds ratio and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and find that a transit\nmodel with no TTVs is favored to 3.6-sigma confidence. These observations\nsuggest that Kepler-421b is either alone in its system or is only experiencing\nminor dynamic interactions with an unseen companion. With the Kepler-421b\nephemeris constrained, we calculate future transit times and discuss the\nopportunity to characterize the atmosphere of this cold, long-period exoplanet\nvia transmission spectroscopy. Our investigation emphasizes the difficulties\nassociated with observing long-period exoplanet transits and the consequences\nthat arise from failing to refine transit ephemerides.\n", "  Graphene-metal nanoparticle hybrid materials potentially display not only the\nunique properties of metal nanoparticles and those of graphene, but also\nadditional novel properties due to the interaction between graphene and\nnanoparticles. This study shows that gold nanoislands can be used to tailor the\nlocal electronic properties of graphene. Graphene on crystalline gold\nnanoislands exhibits moir\\'e superlattices, which generate secondary Dirac\npoints in the local density of states. Conversely, the graphene covered gold\nregions undergo a polycrystalline to Au(111) phase transition upon annealing.\nMoreover, the nanoscale coexistence of moir\\'e superlattices with different\nmoir\\'e periodicities has also been revealed. Several of these moir\\'e\nperiodicities are anomalously large, which cannot be explained by the standard\nlattice mismatch between the graphene and the topmost Au(111) layers. Density\nfunctional theory and molecular dynamics simulations show for the first time\nthat in such cases the graphene and the interfacial metallic layer is strained,\nleading to distorted lattice constants, and consequently to reduced misfit.\nRoom temperature charge localization induced by a large wavelength moir\\'e\npattern is also observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These findings can\nopen a route towards the strain engineering of graphene/metal interfaces with\nvarious moir\\'e superlattices and tailored electronic properties for nanoscale\ninformation coding.\n", "  We investigate the star formation rate (SFR) dependence on the stellar mass\nand gas-phase metallicity relation at z=2 with MOSFIRE/Keck as part of the\nZFIRE survey. We have identified 117 galaxies (1.98 < z < 2.56), with\n$8.9\\leq$log(M/M$_{\\odot}$)$\\leq11.0$, for which we can measure gas-phase\nmetallicities. For the first time, we show discernible difference between the\nmass-metallicity relation, using individual galaxies, when deviding the sample\nby low ($<10$~M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and high ($>10$~M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) SFRs.\nAt fixed mass, low star-forming galaxies tend to have higher metallicity than\nhigh star-forming galaxies. Using a few basic assumptions, we further show that\nthe gas masses and metallicities required to produce the fundamental\nmass--metallicity relation, and its intrinsic scatter, are consistent with\ncold-mode accretion predictions obtained from the OWLS hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Our results from both simulations and observations are suggestive\nthat cold-mode accretion is responsible for the fundamental mass-metallicity\nrelation at $z=2$ and demonstrates the direct relationship between cosmological\naccretion and the fundamental properties of galaxies.\n", "  We present the most general gauge-invariant action functional for coupled 1-\nand 2-form gauge fields with kinetic terms in generic dimensions, i.e. dropping\neventual contributions that can be added in particular space-time dimensions\nonly such as higher Chern-Simons terms. After appropriate field redefinitions\nit coincides with a truncation of the Samtleben-Szegin-Wimmer action. In the\nprocess one sees explicitly how the existence of a gauge invariant functional\nenforces that the most general semi-strict Lie 2-algebra describing the bundle\nof a non-abelian gerbe gets reduced to a very particular structure, which,\nafter the field redefinition, can be identified with the one of an enhanced\nLeibniz algebra. This is the first step towards a systematic construction of\nsuch functionals for higher gauge theories, with kinetic terms for a tower of\ngauge fields up to some highest form degree p, solved here for p = 2.\n", "  We present the results of a NuSTAR study of the dynamically confirmed\nstellar-mass black hole GS 1354-645. The source was observed during its 2015\n\"hard\" state outburst; we concentrate on spectra from two relatively bright\nphases. In the higher-flux observation, the broadband NuSTAR spectra reveal a\nclear, strong disk reflection spectrum, blurred by a degree that requires a\nblack hole spin of a = cJ/GM^2 > 0.98 (1 sigma statistical limits only). The\nfits also require a high inclination: theta = 75(2) degrees. Strong \"dips\" are\nsometimes observed in the X-ray light curves of sources viewed at such an\nangle; these are absent, perhaps indicating that dips correspond to flared disk\nstructures that only manifest at higher accretion rates. In the lower-flux\nobservation, there is evidence of radial truncation of the thin accretion disk.\nWe discuss these results in the context of spin in stellar-mass black holes,\nand inner accretion flow geometries at moderate accretion rates.\n", "  In the present chapter we study the emergence of global patterns in large\ngroups in first and second-order multi-agent systems, focusing on two\ningredients that influence the dynamics: the interaction network and the state\nspace. The state space determines the types of equilibrium that can be reached\nby the system. Meanwhile, convergence to specific equilibria depends on the\nconnectivity of the interaction network and on the interaction potential. When\nthe system does not satisfy the necessary conditions for convergence to the\ndesired equilibrium, control can be exerted, both on finite-dimensional systems\nand on their mean-field limit.\n", "  While the extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) found in almost all 1--2\nGyr-old star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds are often explained by\npostulating extended star-formation histories, the tight subgiant branches\n(SGBs) seen in some clusters challenge this popular scenario. Puzzlingly, the\nSGB of the eMSTO cluster NGC 419 is significantly broader at bluer than at\nredder colors. We carefully assess and confirm the reality of this\nobservational trend. If we would assume that the widths of the features in\ncolor--magnitude space were entirely owing to a range in stellar ages, the\nstar-formation histories of the eMSTO stars and the blue SGB region would be\nsignificantly more prolonged than that of the red part of the SGB. This cannot\nbe explained by assuming an internal age spread. We show that rotational\ndeceleration of a population of rapidly rotating stars, a currently hotly\ndebated alternative scenario, naturally explains the observed trend along the\nSGB. Our analysis shows that a `converging' SGB could be produced if the\ncluster is mostly composed of rapidly rotating stars that slow down over time\nowing to the conservation of angular momentum during their evolutionary\nexpansion from main-sequence turn-off stars to red giants.\n", "  We report an inelastic neutron scattering study of the spin waves of the\none-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin ladder compound RbFe$_2$Se$_3$. The\nresults reveal that the products, $SJ$'s, of the spin $S$ and the magnetic\nexchange interactions $J$'s along the antiferromagnetic (leg) direction and the\nferromagnetic (rung) direction are comparable with those for the stripe ordered\nphase of the parent compounds of the iron-based superconductors. The\nuniversality of the $SJ$'s implies nearly universal spin wave dynamics and the\nirrelevance of the fermiology for the existence of the stripe antiferromagnetic\norder among various Fe-based materials.\n", "  In Liu (2015), we propose selecting binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\ncandidates using the centroid shift of the images, which is induced by the\nnon-synchronous variations of the two nuclei. In this paper, a known binary AGN\n(SDSS J233635.75-010733.7) is employed to verify the ability of this method.\nUsing 162 exposures in the $R$ band of \\textit{Palomar Transient Factory}\n(PTF), an excess of dispersion in the positional distribution of the binary AGN\nis detected, though the two nuclei cannot be resolved in the images of PTF. We\nalso propose a new method to compare the position of the binary AGN in PTF $g$\nand $R$ band and find the difference is highly significant even only with 20\nexposures. This new method is efficient for two nuclei with different spectral\nenergy distributions, e.g., type I + type II AGN or off-set AGN. Large-scale\nsurveys, e.g., the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System and the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope, are expected to discover a large sample of\nbinary AGN candidates with these methods.\n", "  Nearly all types of massive stars with radiatively driven stellar winds are\nX-ray sources that can be observed by the presently operating powerful X-ray\ntelescopes. In this review I briefly address recent advances in our\nunderstanding of stellar winds obtained from X-ray observations. The winds of\nOB dwarfs with subtypes later than O9V may be predominantly in a hot phase, and\nX-ray observations offer the best window for their studies. The X-ray\nproperties of OB supergiants are largely determined by the effects of radiative\ntransfer in their clumped stellar winds. The recently suggested method to\ndirectly measure mass-loss rates of O stars by fitting the shapes of X-ray\nemission lines is considered but its validity cannot be confirmed. To obtain\nrobust quantitative information on stellar wind parameters from X-ray\nspectroscopy, a multiwavelength analysis by means of stellar atmosphere models\nis required. Independent groups are now performing such analyses with\nencouraging results. Joint analyses of optical, UV, and X-ray spectra of OB\nsupergiants yield consistent mass-loss rates. Depending on the adopted clumping\nparameters, the empirically derived mass-loss rates are comparable (within a\nfactor of a few) to those predicted by standard recipes (Vink et al. 2001). All\nsufficiently studied O stars display variable X-ray emission that might be\nrelated to corotating interaction regions in their winds. In the latest stages\nof stellar evolution, single red supergiants and luminous blue variable stars\ndo not emit observable amounts of X-rays. On the other hand, nearly all types\nof Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are X-ray sources. X-ray spectroscopy allows a\nsensitive probe of WR wind abundances and opacities.\n", "  The pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates\nremains the biggest unresolved mystery in condensed matter physics. To solve\nthe problem, one of the most effective approaches is to investigate directly\nthe superconducting CuO2 layers. Here, by growing CuO2 monolayer films on\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta} substrates, we identify two distinct and spatially\nseparated energy gaps centered at the Fermi energy, a smaller U-like gap and a\nlarger V-like gap on the films, and study their interactions with alien atoms\nby low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. The newly discovered U-like\ngap exhibits strong phase coherence and is immune to scattering by K, Cs and Ag\natoms, suggesting its nature as a nodeless superconducting gap in the CuO2\nlayers, whereas the V-like gap agrees with the well-known pseudogap state in\nthe underdoped regime. Our results support an s-wave superconductivity in\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta}, which, we propose, originates from the\nmodulation-doping resultant two-dimensional hole liquid confined in the CuO2\nlayers.\n", "  We present the results of spectropolarimetric observations of 12 Herbig Ae/Be\nobjects. Our data have the largest spectropolarimetric wavelength coverage,\n4560 {\\AA} to 9480 {\\AA}, published to date. A change in linear polarisation\nacross the H{\\alpha} line, is detected in all objects. Such a line effect\nreveals the fact that stellar photons are scattered off free electrons that are\nnot distributed in a spherically symmetric volume, suggesting the presence of\nsmall disks around these accreting objects. Thanks to the large wavelength\ncoverage, we can report that H{\\alpha} is the spectral line in the optical\nwavelength range that is most sensitive to revealing deviations from spherical\nsymmetry, and the one most likely to show a line effect across the polarisation\nin such cases. Few other spectral lines display changes in polarisation across\nthe line. In addition, H{\\alpha} is the only line which shows an effect across\nits absorption component in some sources. We present a scenario explaining this\nfinding and demonstrate that the detection of the line effect strongly relies\non the number of photons scattered into our line of sight. We highlight the\nspecial case of R Mon, which is the only object in our sample to show many\nlines with a polarisation effect, which is much stronger than in all other\nobjects. Given that the object and its nebulosity is spatially resolved, we\nargue that this is due to scattering of the stellar and emission spectrum off\ncircumstellar dust.\n", "  First-principles calculations predicted monolayer blue phosphorus to be an\nalternative two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, like the recently\ndiscovered monolayer black phosphorus. Due to its unique crystalline and\nelectronic structure, blue phosphorus may be a promising candidate as a\nBCS-superconductor after proper intercalation. In this study, using\nfirst-principles calculations, the favorable intercalation sites for some\nalkali metals and alkaline earths have been identified for Blue-P bilayer and\nthe stacking configuration of bilayer is changed. Then the blue phosphorus\nbilayer transforms from a semiconductor to a metal due to the charge transfer\nfrom metal to phosphorus. Own to the strong electron-phonon coupling, isotropic\nsuperconducting state is induced and the calculated transition temperatures are\n$20.4$, $20.1$, and $14.4$K for Li-, Na-, and Mg-intercaltion, respectively,\nwhich is superior to other predicted or experimentally observed two-dimensional\nBCS-superconductors.\n", "  Nonlinear evolution of magnetic reconnection is investigated by means of\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations including uniform resistivity, uniform\nviscosity, and anisotropic thermal conduction. When viscosity exceeds\nresistivity (the magnetic Prandtl number Prm > 1), the viscous dissipation\ndominates outflow dynamics and leads to the decrease in the plasma density\ninside a current sheet. The low-density current sheet supports the excitation\nof the vortex. The thickness of the vortex is broader than that of the current\nfor Prm > 1. The broader vortex flow more efficiently carries the upstream\nmagnetic flux toward the reconnection region, and consequently boosts the\nreconnection. The reconnection rate increases with viscosity provided that\nthermal conduction is fast enough to take away the thermal energy increased by\nthe viscous dissipation (the fluid Prandtl number Pr < 1). The result suggests\nthe need to control the Prandtl numbers for the reconnection against the\nconventional resistive model.\n", "  Accreting stellar-mass black holes often show a `Type-C' quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) in their X-ray flux, and an iron emission line in their X-ray\nspectrum. The iron line is generated through continuum photons reflecting off\nthe accretion disk, and its shape is distorted by relativistic motion of the\norbiting plasma and the gravitational pull of the black hole. The physical\norigin of the QPO has long been debated, but is often attributed to\nLense-Thirring precession, a General Relativistic effect causing the inner flow\nto precess as the spinning black hole twists up the surrounding space-time.\nThis predicts a characteristic rocking of the iron line between red and blue\nshift as the receding and approaching sides of the disk are respectively\nilluminated. Here we report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the black\nhole binary H 1743-322 in which the line energy varies systematically over the\n~4 s QPO cycle (3.70 sigma significance), as predicted. This provides strong\nevidence that the QPO is produced by Lense-Thirring precession, constituting\nthe first detection of this effect in the strong gravitation regime. There are\nhowever elements of our results harder to explain, with one section of data\nbehaving differently to all the others. Our result enables the future\napplication of tomographic techniques to map the inner regions of black hole\naccretion disks.\n", "  We compare common star-formation rate (SFR) indicators in the local Universe\nin the GAMA equatorial fields (around 160 sq. deg.), using ultraviolet (UV)\nphotometry from GALEX, far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimetre (sub-mm)\nphotometry from H-ATLAS, and Halpha spectroscopy from the GAMA survey. With a\nhigh-quality sample of 745 galaxies (median redshift 0.08), we consider three\nSFR tracers: UV luminosity corrected for dust attenuation using the UV spectral\nslope beta (SFRUV,corr), Halpha line luminosity corrected for dust using the\nBalmer decrement (BD) (SFRHalpha,corr), and the combination of UV and IR\nemission (SFRUV+IR). We demonstrate that SFRUV,corr can be reconciled with the\nother two tracers after applying attenuation corrections by calibrating IRX\n(i.e. the IR to UV luminosity ratio) and attenuation in the Halpha (derived\nfrom BD) against beta. However, beta on its own is very unlikely to be a\nreliable attenuation indicator. We find that attenuation correction factors\ndepend on parameters such as stellar mass, z and dust temperature (Tdust), but\nnot on Halpha equivalent width (EW) or Sersic index. Due to the large scatter\nin the IRX vs beta correlation, when compared to SFRUV+IR, the beta-corrected\nSFRUV,corr exhibits systematic deviations as a function of IRX, BD and Tdust.\n", "  During their formation phase stars gain most of their mass in violent\nepisodic accretion events, such as observed in FU Orionis (FUor) and EXor\nstars. V346 Normae is a well-studied FUor that underwent a strong outburst\nbeginning in $\\sim1980$. Here, we report photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations which show that the visual/near-infrared brightness has decreased\ndramatically between the 1990s and 2010 (${\\Delta}R\\approx10.9^{\\rm m}$,\n${\\Delta}J\\approx7.8^{\\rm m}$, ${\\Delta}K\\approx5.8^{\\rm m}$). The spectral\nproperties of this fading event cannot be explained with variable extinction\nalone, but indicate a drop in accretion rate by 2-3 orders of magnitude,\nmarking the first time that a member of the FUor class has been observed to\nswitch to a very low accretion phase. Remarkably, in the last few years\n(2011-2015) V346 Nor has brightened again at all near-infrared wavelengths,\nindicating the onset of a new outburst event. The observed behaviour might be\nconsistent with the clustered luminosity bursts that have been predicted by\nrecent gravitational instability and fragmentation models for the early stages\nof protostellar evolution. Given V346 Nor's unique characteristics (concerning\noutburst duration, repetition frequency, and spectroscopic diagnostics), our\nresults also highlight the need for revisiting the FUor/EXor classification\nscheme.\n", "  We use the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope to study\nthe rich population of young massive star clusters in the main body of NGC\n3256, a merging pair of galaxies with a high star formation rate (SFR) and SFR\nper unit area ($\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$). These clusters have luminosity and mass\nfunctions that follow power laws, $dN/dL \\propto L^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha =\n-2.23 \\pm 0.07$, and $dN/dM \\propto M^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta = -1.86 \\pm 0.34$\nfor $\\tau < 10$ Myr clusters, similar to those found in more quiescent\ngalaxies. The age distribution can be described by $dN/d\\tau \\propto \\tau ^\n\\gamma$, with $\\gamma \\approx -0.67 \\pm 0.08$ for clusters younger than about a\nfew hundred million years, with no obvious dependence on cluster mass. This is\nconsistent with a picture where $\\sim 80 \\%$ of the clusters are disrupted each\ndecade in time. We investigate the claim that galaxies with high\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$ form clusters more efficiently than quiescent systems by\ndetermining the fraction of stars in bound clusters ($\\Gamma$) and the CMF/SFR\nstatistic (CMF is the cluster mass function) for NGC 3256 and comparing the\nresults with those for other galaxies. We find that the CMF/SFR statistic for\nNGC 3256 agrees well with that found for galaxies with $\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$ and\nSFRs that are lower by $1-3$ orders of magnitude, but that estimates for\n$\\Gamma$ are only robust when the same sets of assumptions are applied.\nCurrently, $\\Gamma$ values available in the literature have used different sets\nof assumptions, making it more difficult to compare the results between\ngalaxies.\n", "  This paper proposes a numerical method for solving time-dependent Schrodinger\nequations with finite spectral bandwidth, which applies to both periodic and\nnon-periodic cases. We introduce the concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),\nwhich is broadly used in classical control engineering, to simulate\ntime-dependent quantum dynamics by switching between a finite number of\nconstant Hamiltonians. The switching timings can be programmed to improve the\nprecision and save computational resources. The effectiveness of the PWM method\nis demonstrated by numerical simulations, which shows that it is faster and\nmore robust than the standard piecewise constant control systems. Moreover, we\nalso propose the realization of PWM method for potential implementation in\nexperimental systems.\n", "  From the days when superconductivity was discovered its science was entangled\nby the unresolved problem of the relationship between superconductive state,\nits crystal structure and its phase transitions. The problem was exacerbated by\nthe adjacent scientific area - solid state phase transitions - that offered to\ndivide phase transitions into first and second order. Adding to that the\nconclusion (turned out erroneous)on the structural identity of the\nsuperconductor and normal phases, the whole issue was uncertain and confusing.\nThis article straights it out.\n", "  We carry out two-dimensional global particle-in-cell simulations of the\ninteraction between the solar wind and a dipole field to study the formation of\nthe bow shock and magnetosphere. A self-reforming bow shock ahead of a dipole\nfield is presented by using relatively high temporal-spatial resolutions. We\nfind that (1) the bow shock and the magnetosphere are formed and reach a\nquasi-stable state after several ion cyclotron periods, and (2) under the Bz\nsouthward solar wind condition the bow shock undergoes a self-reformation for\nlow \\b{eta}i and high MA. Simultaneously, a magnetic reconnection in the\nmagnetotail is found. For high \\b{eta}i and low MA, the shock becomes\nquasi-stationary, and the magnetotail reconnection disappears. In addition, (3)\nthe magnetopause deflects the magnetosheath plasmas. The sheath particles\ninjected at the quasi-perpendicular region of the bow shock can be convected to\ndownstream of an oblique shock region. A fraction of these sheath particles can\nleak out from the magnetosheath at the wings of the bow shock. Hence, the\ndownstream situation is more complicated than that for a planar shock produced\nin local simulations.\n", "  2D crystals, such as graphene, exhibit the higher strength and stiffness of\nany other known man-made or natural material. So far, this assertion has been\nprimarily based on modelling predictions and on bending experiments in\ncombination with pertinent modelling. True uniaxial loading of suspended\ngraphene is not easy to accomplish; however such an experiment is of paramount\nimportance in order to assess the intrinsic properties of graphene without the\ninfluence of an underlying substrate. In this work we report on uniaxial\ntension of graphene up to moderate strains of 0.8% ca.. This has been made\npossible by sandwiching the graphene flake between two polymethylmethacrylate\n(PMMA) layers and by suspending its central part by the removal of a section of\nPMMA with e-beam lithography. True uniaxial deformation is confirmed by the\nmeasured large phonon shifts with strain by Raman spectroscopy and the\nindication of lateral buckling (similar to what is observed for thin\nmacroscopic membranes under tension). Finally, we also report on how the stress\nis transferred to the suspended specimen through the adhesive grips and\ndetermine the value of interfacial shear stress that is required for efficient\naxial loading in such a system.\n", "  The announced ~ 3 {\\sigma} enhancement in the inclusive {\\gamma} {\\gamma}\n-spectrum at ~ 750 GeV made by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at LHC might\nindicate the existence of a monopole-antimonopole bound state: monopolium. In\nhere we revisit our calculation of 2012 from a more general perspective and see\nthat this resonance, if confirmed, might be a first signal of the existence of\nmagnetic monopoles.\n", "  After 26 years from the major event of 1990, in early 2016 the puzzling\nsymbiotic binary MWC 560 has gone into a new and even brighter outburst. We\npresent our tight BVRI photometric monitoring of MWC 560 (451 independent runs\ndistributed over 357 different nights), covering the 2005-2016 interval, and\nthe current outburst in particoular. A stricking feature of the 2016 outburst\nhas been the suppression of the short term chaotic variability during the rise\ntoward maximum brightness, and its dominance afterward with an amplitude in\nexcess of 0.5 mag. Similar to the 1990 event when the object remained around\nmaximum brightness for ~6 months, at the time Solar conjunction prevented\nfurther observations of the current outburst, MWC 560 was still around maximum,\nthree months past reaching it. We place our observations into a long term\ncontex by combining with literature data to provide a complete 1928-2016\nlightcurve. Some strong periodicities are found to modulate the optical\nphotometry of MWC 560. A period of 1860 days regulate the occourence of bright\nphases at BVR bands (with exactly 5.0 cycles separating the 1990 and 2016\noutbursts), while the peak brightness attained during bright phases seems to\nvary with a ~9570 days cycle. A clean 331 day periodicity modulate the I-band\nlightcurve, where the emission from the M giant dominates, with a lightcurve\nstrongly reminiscent of an ellipsoidal distortion plus irradiation from the hot\ncompanion. Pros and cons of 1860 and 331 days as the system orbital period are\nreviewed, waiting for a spectroscopic radial velocity orbit of the M giant to\nsettle the question (provided the orbit is not oriented face-on).\n", "  In this paper, considering the energy conditions we shall show that some of\nthe energy conditions are violated in the vicinity of future singularities with\nthe scale factor suggested by Dabrowski - Marosek.\n", "  We performed a search for a Lorentz-invariance- and CPT-violating coupling of\nthe $^3$He and $^{129}$Xe nuclear spins to posited background fields. Our\nexperimental approach is to measure the free precession of nuclear spin\npolarized $^3$He and $^{129}$Xe atoms using SQUID detectors. As the laboratory\nreference frame rotates with respect to distant stars, we look for a sidereal\nmodulation of the Larmor frequencies of the co-located spin samples. As a\nresult we obtain an upper limit on the equatorial component of the background\nfield $\\tilde{b}^n_{\\bot}< 8.4 \\cdot 10^{-34}$ GeV (68\\% C.L.). Furthermore,\nthis technique was modified to search for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of\n$^{129}$Xe.\n", "  We present a detailed theory for the total reaction rate constant of a\ncomposite core-shell nanoreactor, consisting of a central solid core surrounded\nby a hydrogel layer of variable thickness, where a given number of small\ncatalytic nanoparticles are embedded at prescribed positions and are endowed\nwith a prescribed surface reaction rate constant. Besides the precise geometry\nof the assembly, our theory accounts explicitly for the diffusion coefficients\nof the reactants in the hydrogel and in the bulk as well as for their transfer\nfree energy jump upon entering the hydrogel shell. Moreover, we work out an\napproximate analytical formula for the overall rate constant, which is valid in\nthe physically relevant range of geometrical and chemical parameters. We\ndiscuss in depth how the diffusion-controlled part of the rate depends on the\nessential variables, including the size of the central core. In particular, we\nderive some simple rules for estimating the number of nanocatalysts per\nnanoreactor for an efficient catalytic performance in the case of small to\nintermediate core sizes. Our theoretical treatment promises to provide a very\nuseful and flexible tool for the design of superior performing nanoreactor\ngeometries and with optimized nanoparticle load.\n", "  In this paper we find new solutions for the so called Einstein-Chern-Simons\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker field equations studied in refs. (Phys. Rev. D 84\n(2011) 063506, Eur. Phys. J. C 74 (2014) 3087). We consider three cases:(i) in\nthe first case we find some solutions of the five-dimensional ChS-FRW field\nequations when the $h^a$ field is a perfect fluid that obeys a barotropic\nequation of state; (ii) in the second case we study the solutions, for the\ncases $\\gamma =1/2,\\ 3/4$, when the $h^a$ field is a five dimensional\npolitropic fluid that obeys the equation $P^{(h)}=\\omega ^{(h)}\\rho ^{(h)\\gamma\n}$; (iii) in the third case we find the scale factor and the state parameter\n$\\omega (t)$ when the $h^a$ field is a variable modified Chaplygin gas.\n  We consider also a space-time metric which contains as a subspace to the\nusual four-dimensional FRW and then we study the same three cases considered in\nthe five-dimensional, namely when (i) the $h^a$ field is a perfect fluid, (ii)\nthe $h^a$ field is a five dimensional politropic fluid and (iii) the $h^a$\nfield is a variable modified Chaplygin gas.\n", "  We present a novel scheme for controlled quantum secure communication (CQSC)\nusing GHZ-like state. In this scheme, a trusted controller assists the users\nfor achieving secure transmission of data between them. The dense coding\ntechnique is exploited to increase the qubit efficiency and we show that the\nproposed scheme is immune against common eavesdropping attacks. We show how the\nmethod can be generalized to include N controllers using sets of GHZ-like\nstates shared among the controllers and users. In this process entanglement\nswapping and single particle measurements are performed by the controllers to\nrelax their controls and the users get entangled in Bell states.\n", "  Lorentz symmetry violations can be parametrized by an effective field theory\nframework that contains both General Relativity and the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, called the Standard-Model Extension or SME. We consider in\nthis work only the pure gravitational sector of the minimal SME. We present new\nconstraints on the SME coefficients obtained from lunar laser ranging, very\nlong baseline interferometry, and planetary motions.\n", "  The world runs on communicated sequences of symbols, e.g. numerals. Examining\nboth engineered and natural communications networks reveals an unsuspected\norder that depends on contact with an unpredictable entity. This order has\nthree roots. The first is a proof within quantum theory that no evidence can\never determine its explanation, so that an agent choosing an explanation must\ndo so unpredictably. The second root is the showing that clocks that step\ncomputers do not \"tell time\" but serve as self-adjusting symbol-handling agents\nthat regulate \"logically synchronized\" motion in response to unpredictable\ndisturbances. Such a clock-agent has a certain independence as well as the\ncapacity to communicate via unpredictable symbols with other clock-agents and\nto adjust its own tick rate in response to that communication. The third root\nis the noticing of unpredictable symbol exchange in natural systems, including\nthe transmission of symbols found in molecular biology. We introduce a\nsymbol-handling agent as a role played in some cases by a person, for example a\nphysicist who chooses an explanation of given experimental outcomes, and in\nother cases by some other biological entity, and in still other cases by an\ninanimate device, such as a computer-based detector used in physical\nmeasurements. While we forbear to try to explain the propensity of agents at\nall levels from cells to civilizations to form and operate networks of\nlogically synchronized symbol-handling agents, we point to this propensity as\nan overlooked cosmic order, an order structured by the unpredictability ensuing\nfrom the proof. Appreciating the cosmic order leads to a conception of agency\nthat replaces volition by unpredictability and re-conceives the notion of\nobjectivity in a way that makes a place for agency in the world as described by\nphysics. Some specific implications for physics are outlined.\n", "  Recent observations suggest ongoing planet formation in the innermost parsec\nof our Galaxy. The super-massive black hole (SMBH) might strip planets or\nplanetary embryos from their parent star, bringing them close enough to be\ntidally disrupted. We investigate the chance of planet tidal captures by\nrunning three-body encounters of SMBH-star-planet systems with a high-accuracy\nregularized code. We show that tidally captured planets have orbits close to\nthose of their parent star. We conclude that the final periapsis distance of\nthe captured planet from the SMBH will be much larger than 200 AU, unless its\nparent star was already on a highly eccentric orbit.\n", "  This study aims to probe the thermodynamic properties of the hot intragroup\nmedium (IGM) plasma in the core regions of the NGC 4636 galaxy group by\ndetailed measurements of several emission lines and their relative intensities.\nWe analyzed deep XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data in five\nadjacent spectral regions in the central parts of the NGC 4636 galaxy group. We\nexamined the suppression of the Fe xvii resonance line (15.01 {\\AA}) as\ncompared to the forbidden lines of the same ion (17.05 {\\AA} and 17.10 {\\AA}).\nThe presence and radial dependence of the cooling flow was investigated through\nspectral modeling. In addition, a parallel analysis with deep Chandra Advances\nCCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data was conducted to gain additional\ninformation about the thermodynamical properties of the IGM. We find that the\nplasma at the group center to the north shows efficient Fe xvii ion resonant\nscattering, wheras no resonant scattering was detected at the south side. The\nregions featuring resonant scattering coincide with those embodying large\namounts of cool ($kT\\lesssim0.4$ keV) gas phases, and the spectral imprints of\ncooling gas with a total mass deposition rate of $\\sim0.8$ M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ within the examined region of $2.4^{\\prime}\\times 5.0^{\\prime}$. We\ninterpret the results as possible evidence of asymmetric turbulence\ndistribution in the NGC 4636 IGM: Turbulence dominates the gas dynamics to the\nsouth, while collective gas motions characterize the dynamics to the north.\nX-ray images show imprints of energetic AGN at both sides, yet we find evidence\nof turbulence heating at the south and gas cooling at the north of the core. We\ninfer that the observed asymmetry may be the result of the specific observation\nangle to the source, or arise from the turbulence driven by core sloshing at\nsouth side.\n", "  We present a method to improve the resolution of available hyperlenses in the\nliterature. In this method, we combine the operation of hyperlens with the\nrecently proposed plasmon injection scheme for loss compensation in\nmetamaterials. Image of an object, which is otherwise not resolvable by the\nhyperlens alone, was reconstructed up to the minimum feature size of one\nseventh of the free-space wavelength.\n", "  This study investigated whether and how Learning Assistant (LA) support is\nlinked to student outcomes in Physics courses nationwide. Paired student\nconcept inventory scores were collected over three semesters from 3,753\nstudents, representing 69 courses, and 40 instructors, from 17 LA Alliance\nmember institutions. Each participating student completed an online concept\ninventory at the beginning (pre) and end (post) of each term. The physics\nconcept inventories tested included the Force Concept Inventory (FCI),\nConceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM), Force and Motion Concept\nEvaluation (FMCE) and the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA).\nAcross instruments, Cohen's d effect sizes were 1.4 times higher, on average,\nfor courses supported by LAs compared to courses without LA support.\nPreliminary findings indicate that physics students' outcomes may be most\neffective when LA support is utilized in laboratory settings (1.9 times higher\nthan no LA support) in comparison to lecture (1.4 times higher), recitations\n(1.5 times higher), or unknown uses (1.3 times higher). Additional research\nwill inform LA-implementation best practices across disciplines.\n", "  In this paper, we present a study of the electric transport properties of\nsmall discrete rings with $3\\leq N\\leq 6$ sites and $N_{e}<2N$ electrons, which\ncan be seen as a simplified version of real aromatic molecules. In particular,\nthe ring with six sites and six electrons is our prototype of the benzene\nmolecule. It is already known that the Hubbard model itself cannot account for\nthe anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility of the aromatic molecules,\nwhich is observed when they are subjected to an external magnetic field\nperpendicular to their basal plane. Therefore, we propose an extension of the\nHubbard model, with an ad hoc extra interaction term, with two adjustable\nparameters. Our results show that this extension of the Hubbard model is able\nto amplify the persistent currents established in the ground state of our rings\nand, moreover, promotes an enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility\nanisotropy depending on the tuning of the adjustable parameters. In particular,\nfor the prototype of the benzene molecule, we recover the order of magnitude of\nthe diamagnetic anisotropy measured for this molecule.\n", "  We report quantitative measurements of optically detected ferromagnetic\nresonance (ODFMR) of ferromagnetic thin films that use nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamonds to transduce FMR into a fluorescence intensity variation.\nTo uncover the mechanism responsible for these signals, we study ODFMR as we 1)\nvary the separation of the NV centers from the ferromagnet (FM), 2) record the\nNV center longitudinal relaxation time $T_1$ during FMR, and 3) vary the\nmaterial properties of the FM. Based on the results, we propose the following\nmechanism for ODFMR. Decay and scattering of the driven, uniform FMR mode\nresults in spinwaves that produce fluctuating dipolar fields in a spectrum of\nfrequencies. When the spinwave spectrum overlaps the NV center ground-state\nspin resonance frequencies, the dipolar fields from these resonant spinwaves\nrelax the NV center spins, resulting in an ODFMR signal. These results lay the\nfoundation for an approach to NV center spin relaxometry to study FM dynamics\nwithout the constraint of directly matching the NV center spin-transition\nfrequency to the magnetic system of interest, thus enabling an alternate\nmodality for scanned-probe magnetic microscopy that can sense ferromagnetic\nresonance with nanoscale resolution.\n", "  Different types of gravitating compact objects occuring in d=5 space-time are\nconsidered: boson stars, hairy black holes and perfect fluid solutions. All\nthese solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to matter have well\nestablished counterparts in d=4; in particular neutron stars can be\nmodell{\\S}ed more or less realistically by a perfect fluid. A special emphasis\nis set on the possibility -and/or the necessity- for these solutions to have an\nintrinsic angular momentum or spin. The influence of a cosmological constant on\ntheir pattern is also studied.\n  Several physical properties are presented from which common features to boson\nand neutron stars clearly emerge.\n  We finally point out qualitative differences of the gravitational interaction\nsupporting these classical lumps between four and five dimensions.\n", "  In this essay we present an outer product on R^6, and we show that R^6 with\nthis outer product can take three kinds of Lie brackets. We prove that R^6 with\nthese Lie brackets take the structures of so(4), so(2,2) and so(3,1). We also\ndeduce a 4-dimensional submanifold of R^6 with an almost complex structure.\n", "  We investigate how students solve partial differential equations and partial\nderivatives in the context of quantum mechanics. We use the resources framework\nto investigate students' discussion in a group problem-solving environment to\ninvestigate the fine-grain elements of their problem solving. We analyze an\nexample of students' use of separation of variables to solve a partial\ndifferential equation for a free particle problem. We identify a mathematical\naction called \"pulling out\" as a procedural resource to help students with\nseparating the time part from the space part of the wave function in the course\nof solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We discuss how students use\n\"pulling out\" as a procedural step in solving partial differential equations\nand sense-making.\n", "  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer unprecedented opportunities to\nlearn at scale. Within a few years, the phenomenon of crowd-based learning has\ngained enormous popularity with millions of learners across the globe\nparticipating in courses ranging from Popular Music to Astrophysics. They have\ncaptured the imaginations of many, attracting significant media attention -\nwith The New York Times naming 2012 \"The Year of the MOOC.\" For those engaged\nin learning analytics and educational data mining, MOOCs have provided an\nexciting opportunity to develop innovative methodologies that harness big data\nin education.\n", "  Quantum carpets- in position and momentum space- woven by the\nself-interference of de Broglie wave of an atom or an electron, trapped in an\ninfinitely deep potential well, are explained. The recurrence of self-similar\nstructures in designs of these carpets mimics the phenomena of quantum revivals\nand fractional revivals. We identify fractional revivals of various order by\nmeans of these space-time and momentum-time interference patterns.\n", "  The increasing complexity and interdependency of today's networks highlight\nthe importance of studying network robustness to failure and attacks. Many\nlarge-scale networks are prone to cascading effects where a limited number of\ninitial failures (due to attacks, natural hazards or resource depletion)\npropagate through a dependent mechanism, ultimately leading to a global failure\nscenario where a substantial fraction of the network loses its functionality.\nThese cascading failure scenarios often take place in networks which are\nembedded in space and constrained by geometry. Building on previous results on\ncascading failure in random geometric networks, we introduce and analyze a\ncontinuous cascading failure model where a node has an initial\ncontinuously-valued state, and fails if the aggregate state of its neighbors\nfall below a threshold. Within this model, we derive analytical conditions for\nthe occurrence and non-occurrence of cascading node failure, respectively.\n", "  We prove a lower bound on the information leakage of any classical protocol\ncomputing the equality function in the simultaneous message passing (SMP)\nmodel. Our bound is valid in the finite length regime and is strong enough to\ndemonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of information leakage for practical\nquantum protocols. We prove our bound by obtaining an improved finite size\nversion of the communication bound due to Babai and Kimmel, relating randomized\ncommunication to deterministic communication in the SMP model. We then relate\ninformation leakage to randomized communication through a series of reductions.\nWe first provide alternative characterizations for information leakage,\nallowing us to link it to average length communication while allowing for\nshared randomness (pairwise, with the referee). A Markov inequality links this\nwith bounded length communication, and a Newman type argument allows us to go\nfrom shared to private randomness. The only reduction in which we incur more\nthan a logarithmic additive factor is in the Markov inequality; in particular,\nour compression method is essentially tight for the SMP model with average\nlength communication.\n", "  Electron transport coupled with magnetism has attracted attention over the\nyears as exemplified in anomalous Hall effect due to a Berry phase in momentum\nspace. Another type of unconventional Hall effect -- topological Hall effect,\noriginating from the real-space Berry phase, has recently become of great\nimportance in the context of magnetic skyrmions. We have observed topological\nHall effect in bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic\nSrIrO$_3$ over a wide region of both temperature and magnetic field. The\ntopological term rapidly decreases with the thickness of SrRuO$_3$, ending up\nwith the complete disappearance at 7 unit cells of SrRuO$_3$. Combined with\nmodel calculation, we concluded that the topological Hall effect is driven by\ninterface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which is caused by both the broken\ninversion symmetry and the strong spin-orbit coupling of SrIrO$_3$. Such\ninteraction is expected to realize the N\\'{e}el-type magnetic skyrmion, of\nwhich size is estimated to be $\\sim$10 nm from the magnitude of topological\nHall resistivity. The results established that the high-quality oxide interface\nenables us to tune the chirality of the system; this can be a step towards the\nfuture topological electronics.\n", "  Based on DFT calculation, we predict that BiCN, i.e., bilayer Bi films\npassivated with -CN group, is a novel 2D Bi-based material with highly\nthermodynamic stability, and demonstrate that it is also a new kind of 2D TI\nwith a giant SOC gap (? 1 eV) by direct calculation of the topological\ninvariant Z2 and obvious exhibition of the helical edge states. Monolayer h-BN\nand MoS2 are identified as good candidate substrates for supporting the\nnontrivial topological insulating phase of the 2D TI films, since the two\nsubstrates can stabilize and weakly interact with BiCN via van derWaals\ninteraction and thus hardly affect the electronic properties, especially the\nband topology. The topological properties are robust against the strain and\nelectric field. This may provide a promising platform for realization of novel\ntopological phases.\n", "  Within some approaches to loop quantum cosmology, the existence of an\nEuclidean phase at high density has been suggested. In this article, we try to\nexplain clearly what are the observable consequences of this possible\ndisappearance of time. Depending on whether it is a real fundamental effect or\njust an instability in the equation of motion, we show that very different\nconclusions should be drawn. We finally mention some possible consequences of\nthis phenomenon in the black hole sector.\n", "  Although atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, frequently presents\nin patients with underlying valvular disease, its hemodynamic contributions are\nnot fully understood. The present work aimed to computationally study how\nphysical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF\nhemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided\nvalvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert\nduring AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been\nrecently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the\nfour heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nThree different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for\neach of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more\nrelevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while\nthe former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral\nvalvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve\ndiseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary\nlevels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its\nregulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected\nregions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that\nboth mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by\nmitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed\nvalvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights\nas to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF. Present\nfindings, if clinically confirmed, hold the potential to impact AF management\n(e.g., adoption of a rhythm control strategy) in specific valvular diseases.\n", "  Resonant production of fourth chiral family up quark at the LHC via anomalous\ninteractions have been analyzed. It is shown that search for resonances in\nW^{+}b final states could lead to discovery of the fourth chiral family and\nsimultaneously determine scale of the new physics, presumabely related to the\nquark and lepton compositeness. Obtained results emphasize an importance of\nW-leading jet invariant mass analysis in search for W+jets final states at the\nLHC, both with and without b-tagging.\n", "  In this first investigation of the MOCCA database with respect to cataclysmic\nvariables, we found that for models with Kroupa initial distributions,\nconsidering the standard value of the efficiency of the common-envelope phase\nadopted in BSE, no single cataclysmic variable was formed only via binary\nstellar evolution, i. e., in order to form them, strong dynamical interactions\nhave to take place. Our results also indicate that the population of\ncataclysmic variables in globular clusters are, mainly, in the last stage of\ntheir evolution and observational selection effects can change drastically the\nexpected number and properties of observed cataclysmic variables.\n", "  The Siegert states are approached in framework of Bloch-Lane-Robson formalism\nfor quantum collisions. The Siegert state is not described by a pole of Wigner\nR- matrix but rather by the equation $1- R_{nn}L_n = 0$, relating R- matrix\nelement $R_{nn}$ to decay channel logarithmic derivative $L_n$. Extension of\nSiegert state equation to multichannel system results into replacement of\nchannel R- matrix element $R_{nn}$ by its reduced counterpart ${\\cal R}_{nn}$.\nOne proves the Siegert state is a pole, $(1 - {\\cal R}_{nn} L_{n})^{-1}$, of\nmultichannel collision matrix. The Siegert equation $1 - {\\cal R}_{nn} L_{n} =\n0$, ($n$ - Rydberg channel), implies basic results of Quantum Defect Theory as\nSeaton's theorem, complex quantum defect, channel resonances and threshold\ncontinuity of averaged multichannel collision matrix elements.\n", "  We give an algebraic characterisation for the triviality of the canonical\nbundle of a complex supermanifold in terms of a certain Batalin-Vilkovisky\nsuperalgebra structure. As an application, we study the Calabi-Yau case, in\nwhich an explicit formula in terms of the Levi-Civita connection is achieved.\nOur methods include the use of complex integral forms and the recently\ndeveloped theory of superholonomy.\n", "  We show that the widely used density dependent magnetic field prescriptions,\nnecessary to account for the variation of the field intensity from the crust to\nthe core of neutron stars violate one of the Maxwell equations. We estimate how\nstrong the violation is when different equations of state are used and check\nfor which cases the pathological problem can be cured.\n", "  This contribution to the CPT'16 meeting provides a brief overview of recent\nstudies of nonminimal Lorentz violation in the Standard-Model Extension.\n", "  A genetic algorithm procedure is demonstrated that refines the selection of\ninterpolation points of the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) when\nused for constructing reduced order models for time dependent and/or\nparametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with proper\northogonal decomposition. The method achieves nearly optimal interpolation\npoints with only a few generations of the search, making it potentially useful\nfor {\\em online} refinement of the sparse sampling used to construct a\nprojection of the nonlinear terms. With the genetic algorithm, points are\noptimized to jointly minimize reconstruction error and enable dynamic regime\nclassification. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on two canonical\nnonlinear PDEs: the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation and the\nNavier-Stokes equation for flow around a cylinder. Using the former model, the\nprocedure can be compared to the ground-truth optimal interpolation points,\nshowing that the genetic algorithm quickly achieves nearly optimal performance\nand reduced the reconstruction error by nearly an order of magnitude.\n", "  As an integrative and insightful example for undergraduates learning about\nelectrostatics, we discuss how to use symmetry, Coulomb's Law, superposition,\nGauss's law, and visualization to understand the electric field produced by a\nnon-conducting cubic surface that is covered with a uniform surface charge\ndensity. We first discuss how to deduce qualitatively, using only elementary\nphysics, the surprising fact that the electric field inside the cubic surface\nis nonzero and has a complex structure, pointing inwards towards the cube\ncenter from the midface of each cube and pointing outwards towards each edge\nand corner. We then discuss how to understand the quantitative features of the\nelectric field by plotting an analytical expression for E along symmetry lines\nand on symmetry surfaces. This example would be a good choice for group problem\nsolving in a recitation or flipped classroom.\n", "  Gravitational theories with fixed background fields break diffeomorphism\ninvariance. This breaking can be spontaneous or explicit. A brief summary of\nthe main consequences of these types of breaking is presented.\n", "  The largest geomagnetic storm so far in the solar cycle 24 was produced by a\nfast coronal mass ejection (CME) originating on 2015 March 15. It was an\ninitially west-oriented CME and expected to only cause a weak geomagnetic\ndisturbance. Why did this CME finally cause such a large geomagnetic storm? We\ntry to find some clues by investigating its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.\nFirst, we reconstruct the CME's kinematic properties in the corona from the\nSOHO and SDO imaging data with the aid of the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS)\nmodel. It is suggested that the CME propagated to the west\n$\\sim$$33^\\circ$$\\pm$$10^\\circ$ away from the Sun-Earth line with a speed of\nabout 817 km s$^{-1}$ before leaving the field of view of the SOHO/LASCO C3\ncamera. A magnetic cloud (MC) corresponding to this CME was measured in-situ by\nthe Wind spacecraft two days later. By applying two MC reconstruction methods,\nwe infer the configuration of the MC as well as some kinematic information,\nwhich implies that the CME possibly experienced an eastward deflection on its\nway to 1 AU. However, due to the lack of observations from the STEREO\nspacecraft, the CME's kinematic evolution in interplanetary space is not clear.\nIn order to fill this gap, we utilize numerical MHD simulation, drag-based CME\npropagation model (DBM) and the model for CME deflection in interplanetary\nspace (DIPS) to recover the propagation process, especially the trajectory, of\nthe CME from $30 R_S$ to 1 AU. It is suggested that the trajectory of the CME\nwas deflected toward the Earth by about $12^\\circ$, consistent with the\nimplication from the MC reconstruction at 1 AU. This eastward deflection\nprobably contributed to the CME's unexpected geoeffectiveness by pushing the\ncenter of the initially west-oriented CME closer to the Earth.\n", "  Thermal expansion and magnetostriction are directional dependent\nthermodynamic quantities. For the characterization of novel quantum phases of\nmatter it is required to study materials under multi-extreme conditions, in\nparticular down to very low temperatures, in very high magnetic fields, as well\nas under high pressure. We developed a miniaturized capacitive dilatometer\nsuitable for temperatures down to 20 mK and usage in high magnetic fields,\nwhich exerts a large spring force between 40 to 75 N on the sample. This\ncorresponds to a uniaxial stress up to 3 kbar for a sample with cross-section\nof (0.5~mm)$^2$. We describe the design and performance test of the dilatometer\nwhich resolves length changes with high resolution of $0.02 \\mathrm{\\AA}$ at\nlow temperatures. The miniaturized device can be utilized in any standard\ncryostat, including dilution refrigerators or the commercial physical property\nmeasurement system.\n", "  M. Budyko and W. Sellers independently introduced seminal energy balance\nclimate models in 1969, each with a goal of investigating the role played by\npositive ice albedo feedback in climate dynamics. In this paper we replace the\nrelaxation to the mean horizontal heat transport mechanism used in the models\nof Budyko and Sellers with diffusive heat transport. We couple the resulting\nsurface temperature equation with an equation for movement of the edge of the\nice sheet (called the ice line), recently introduced by E. Widiasih. We apply\nthe spectral method to the temperature-ice line system and consider finite\napproximations. We prove there exists a stable equilibrium solution with a\nsmall ice cap, and an unstable equilibrium solution with a large ice cap, for a\nrange of parameter values. If the diffusive transport is too efficient,\nhowever, the small ice cap disappears and an ice free Earth becomes a limiting\nstate. In addition, we analyze a variant of the coupled diffusion equations\nappropriate as a model for extensive glacial episodes in the Neoproterozoic\nEra. Although the model equations are no longer smooth due to the existence of\na switching boundary, we prove there exists a unique stable equilibrium\nsolution with the ice line in tropical latitudes, a climate event known as a\nJormungand or Waterbelt state. As the systems introduced here contain variables\nwith differing time scales, the main tool used in the analysis is geometric\nsingular perturbation theory.\n", "  When an object impacts onto a bed of very loose, fine sand, the drag it\nexperiences depends on the ambient pressure in a surprising way: Drag is found\nto increase significantly with decreasing pressure. We use a modified\npenetrometer experiment to investigate this effect and directly measure the\ndrag on a sphere as a function of both velocity and pressure. We observe a drag\nreduction of over 90% and trace this effect back to the presence of air in the\npores between the sand grains. Finally, we construct a model based on the\nmodification of grain-grain interactions that is in full quantitative agreement\nwith the experiments.\n", "  CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) were chosen as sensor technology\nfor the vertex detectors of STAR, CBM and the upgraded ALICE-ITS. They also\nconstitute a valuable option for tracking devices at future e+e- colliders.\nThose applications require a substantial tolerance to both, ionizing and\nnon-ionizing radiation. To allow for a focused optimization of the radiation\ntolerance, prototypes are tested by irradiating the devices either with purely\nionizing radiation (e.g. soft X-rays) or the most pure sources of non-ionizing\nradiation available (e.g. reactor neutrons). In the second case, it is\ntypically assumed that the impact of the parasitic $\\gamma$-rays found in the\nneutron beams is negligible. We checked this assumption by irradiating MAPS\nwith $\\gamma$-rays and comparing the radiation damage generated with the one in\nneutron irradiated sensors. We conclude that the parasitic radiation doses may\ncause non-negligible radiation damage. Based on the results we propose a\nprocedure to recognize and to suppress the effect of the related parasitic\nionizing radiation damage.\n", "  The process of topological phase transition in a chiral magnetic material\nfrom skyrmion lattice phase to helical phase has been investigated numerically\nand experimentally, yet the analytical expression of the evolution of skyrmion\nnumber and emergent magnetic monopole charge during the process is still\nwaiting to be explored. In this letter, by utilizing the topological current\ntheory, we show that the change of skyrmion number of a layer in the system is\nequal to the net monopole charges that flows through the layer. Based on this\nrelation, with the help of statistical argument, we derive the analytical\nexpressions of the skyrmion number and the monopole charge as functions of the\nexternal magnetic field. We find that the evolution of the skyrmion number is\nexactly the logistic growth function, and the evolution of the monopole charge\nis proportional to the derivative of the skyrmion number of the system. our\nanalytical results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations in\n\\cite{2013SCIENCE}. The goodness of data fitting goes up to 99.94\\%.\n", "  Monte-Carlo simulation of physical processes is an important tool for\ndetector development as it allows to predict signal pulse amplitude and timing,\ntime resolution, efficiency ... Yet despite the fact they are very common, full\nsimulations for RPC-like detector are not widespread and often incomplete. They\nare often based on mathematical distributions that are not suited for this\nparticular modelisation and over-simplify or neglect some important physical\nprocesses.\n  We describe the main physical processes occurring inside a RPC when a charged\nparticle goes through (ionisation, electron drift and multiplication, signal\ninduction ...) through the Riegler-Lippmann-Veenhof model together with a\nstill-in-development simulation. This is a full, fast and multi-threaded\nMonte-Carlo modelisation of the main physical processes using existing and well\ntested libraries and framework (such as the Garfield++ framework and the GNU\nScientific Library). It is developed in the hope to be a basic ground for\nfuture RPC simulation developments.\n", "  We address extended systems interacting with classical fluctuating\nenvironments and analyze the use of quantum probes to discriminate local noise,\ndescribed by independent fluctuating fields, from common noise, corresponding\nto the interaction with a common one. In particular, we consider a bipartite\nsystem made of two non interacting harmonic oscillators and assess\ndiscrimination strategies based on homodyne detection, comparing their\nperformances with the ultimate bounds on the error probabilities of\nquantum-limited measurements. We analyze in details the use of Gaussian probes,\nwith emphasis on experimentally friendly signals. Our results show that a joint\nmeasurement of the position-quadrature on the two oscillators outperforms any\nother homodyne-based scheme for any input Gaussian state.\n", "  We performed non-invasive video imaging of retinal blood flow in a pigmented\nrat by holographic interferometry of near-infrared laser light backscattered by\nretinal tissue, beating against an off-axis reference beam sampled at a frame\nrate of 39 kHz with a high throughput camera. Local Doppler contrasts emerged\nfrom the envelopes of short-time Fourier transforms and the phase of\nautocorrelation functions of holograms rendered by Fresnel transformation. This\napproach permitted imaging of blood flow in large retinal vessels (30 microns\ndiameter) over 400 by 400 pixels with a spatial resolution of 8 microns and a\ntemporal resolution of 6.5 ms.\n", "  We assume that the protein folding process follows two autonomous steps: the\nconformational search for the native, mainly ruled by the hydrophobic effect;\nand, the final adjustment stage, which eventually gives stability to the\nnative. Our main tool of investigation is a 3D lattice model provided with a\nten-letter alphabet, the stereochemical model. This model was conceived for\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations when one keeps in mind the kinetic behavior of\nprotein-like chains in solution. In order to characterize the folding\ncharacteristic time ({\\tau}) by two distinct sampling methods, first we present\ntwo sets of 10^{3} MC simulations for a fast protein-like sequence. For these\nsets of folding times, {\\tau} and {\\tau}_{q} were obtained with the application\nof the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and a modified algorithm (M_{q}A).\nThe results for {\\tau}_{q}reveal two things: i) the hydrophobic chain-solvent\ninteractions plus a set of inter-residues steric constraints are enough to\nemulate the first stage of the process: for each one of the 10^{3} MC performed\nsimulations, the native is always found without exception, ii) the ratio\n{\\tau}_{q}/{\\tau}~1/3 suggests that the effect of local thermal fluctuations,\nencompassed by the Tsallis weight, provides an innate efficiency to the chain\nescapes from energetic and steric traps. ...\n", "  This paper gives general intrinsic theory of general large $N_{c}$ QCD, SU(3)\nQCD, SU(2) hadron-dynamics and U(1) QED gauge field theories in general field\ntheory and progress towards solving the nucleon spin crisis, i.e., presents\ngeneral large $N_{c}$ QCD's inner structures, gauge invariant angular momenta\nand new corresponding Coulomb theorem in quark-gluon field interaction systems\nbased on general field theory, and naturally deduces the gauge invariant spin\nand orbital angular momentum operators of quark and gauge fields with\n$SU(N_{c})$ gauge symmetry by Noether theorem in general field theory. In the\ngeneral large $N_{c}$ QCD, we discover not only the general covariant\ntransverse and parallel conditions ( namely, non-Abelian divergence and curl ),\nbut also that this general system has good intrinsic symmetry characteristics.\nSpecially, this paper's generally decomposing gauge potential theory presents a\nnew technique, it should play a votal role in future physics research.\nTherefore, this paper breakthroughs the some huge difficulties in the nucleon\nspin crisis and opens a door of researching on lots of strong interacting\nsystems with different symmetric properties, which is popularly interesting,\nand keeps both the gauge invariance and their angular momentum commutation\nrelations so that their theories are consistent. Especially, the achieved\nresults here can be utilized to calculate the general QCD strong interactions\nand to give the precise predictions that can be exactly measured by current\nparticle physics experiments due to their gauge invariant properties etc.\n", "  The lack of computationally inexpensive and accurate ab-initio based\nmethodologies to predict lattice thermal conductivity, without computing the\nanharmonic force constants or time-consuming ab-initio molecular dynamics, is\none of the obstacles preventing the accelerated discovery of new high or low\nthermal conductivity materials. The Slack equation is the best alternative to\nother more expensive methodologies but is highly dependent on two variables:\nthe acoustic Debye temperature, $\\theta_a$, and the Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameter,\n$\\gamma$. Furthermore, different definitions can be used for these two\nquantities depending on the model or approximation. In this article, we present\na combinatorial approach to elucidate which definitions of both variables\nproduce the best predictions of the lattice thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_l$. A\nset of 42 compounds was used to test accuracy and robustness of all possible\ncombinations. This approach is ideal for obtaining more accurate values than\nfast screening models based on the Debye model, while being significantly less\nexpensive than methodologies that solve the Boltzmann transport equation.\n", "  Ferrofluids currently are the only type of magnetic liquid materials with\nwide practical use. The theory on ferrofluids is an example of success to apply\nstatistics to science. Ferrofluids are two-phase liquids consisting of\ndispersed nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid. Due\nto their tiny size, individual ferromagnetic particles clearly exhibit Brownian\nmotions. Only when a large number of randomly-moving particles are subject to\nan external magnetic field, can they collectively exhibit magnetization at a\nmacroscale. Using statistical theory, the magnetization of a ferrofluid can be\ncharacterized by the celebrated Langevin equation. The monograph combines\nstatistical theory and the method of Dirac function to establish equations for\nferrofluids under several conditions, including magnetization relaxation,\nmagnetization equilibrium, and magnetization freezing. It thus provides a quite\ncomplete account of the theory of ferrofluid dynamics.\n", "  Well-developed problem-solving skills are essential for any student enrolled\nin a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) course as well as\nfor graduates in the workforce. One of the most essential skills is the ability\nto monitor one's own progress and understanding while solving a problem.\nSuccessful monitoring during the entire solution allows a solver to identify\nerrors within a solution and make adjustments as necessary. To highlight this\naspect of problem-solving, we have developed a framework and associated\nclassroom activities that introduce students to monitoring (M) alongside the\nmore traditional aspects of problem-solving models: analyzing the task (A),\ncreating a plan (C), and executing the plan (E). This ACE-M framework has been\nsuccessfully implemented in lower-division chemistry, mathematics and physics\ncourses. Students enrolled in courses where ACE-M was used as the foundation\nfor problem-solving instruction reported improved problem-solving\nself-efficacy, more monitoring while solving problems, and in many cases\nimproved course grades. With this explicit instruction on self-monitoring,\nstudents are now introduced to expert problem-solving skills that will benefit\nthem in their STEM careers.\n", "  Secondary school students in the United States continue to underachieve in\nmathematics and science. Improving teacher quality is a core component of\nimproving student achievement. Here we report on a professional development\nprogram, the MAST System, that develops the knowledge and skills for teaching\nmathematics, including metacognitive knowledge and regulation. In this\ncognitive apprenticeship program, teachers learn to plan, evaluate and adjust\nto improve student engagement and achievement. Central is the metacognitive\npractice of defense of instruction. By practicing this reflective approach,\nteachers become adaptive experts, able to innovate in the classroom. During the\ntwo-year intervention, the MAST System resulted in large increases in the\nCalifornia Standards Test mathematics scores, compared to both the district and\nthe state. In addition, improvement continued for several years after the\nintervention was completed. This continued improvement in student scores\nindicated that the teachers and schools changed in a sustainable way.\n", "  Low-mass protostars are the extrasolar analogues of the natal Solar System.\nSophisticated physicochemical models are used to simulate the formation of two\nprotoplanetary discs from the initial prestellar phase, one dominated by\nviscous spreading and the other by pure infall. The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc. This holds relatively independent of initial abundances and chemical\nparameters: physical conditions are more important. The amount of CO2 increases\nvia the grain-surface reaction of OH with CO, which is enhanced by\nphotodissociation of H2O ice. Complex organic molecules are produced during\ntransport through the envelope at the expense of CH3OH ice. Their abundances\ncan be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc\nradii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the\ncomplex organic content. Planet population synthesis models may underestimate\nthe amount of CO2 and overestimate CH3OH ices in planetesimals by disregarding\nchemical processing between the cloud and disc phases. The overall C/O and C/N\nratios differ between the gas and solid phases. The two ice ratios show little\nvariation beyond the inner 10 AU and both are nearly solar in the case of pure\ninfall, but both are sub-solar when viscous spreading dominates. Chemistry in\nthe protostellar envelope en route to the protoplanetary disc sets the initial\nvolatile and prebiotically-significant content of icy planetesimals and\ncometary bodies. Comets are thus potentially reflecting the provenances of the\nmidplane ices in the Solar Nebula.\n", "  Two-dimensional interacting electron systems become strongly correlated if\nthe electrons are subject to a perpendicular high magnetic field. After\nintroducing the physics of the quantum Hall regime the incompressible many-\nparticle ground state and its excitations are studied in detail at fractional\nfilling factors for spin-polarized electrons. The spin degree of freedom whose\nimportance was shown in recent experiments is considered by studying the\nthermodynamics at filling factor one and near one.\n"]}
