We give a complete classification for the choices of Riemann\nsurface and the singularities. The Seiberg-Witten curve and scaling dimensions\nof the operator spectrum are worked out. Three dimensional mirror theory and\nthe central charges a and c are also calculated for some subsets, etc. Our\nresults greatly enlarge the landscape of N=2 superconformal field theory and in\nfact also include previous theories constructed using regular singularity on\nthe sphere.\n", "  We report an optical memory in a rare earth doped crystal with long storage\ntimes, up to 20 ms, together with an optical bandwidth of 1.5 MHz. This is\nobtained by transferring optical coherences to nuclear spin coherences, which\nwere then protected against environmental noise by dynamical decoupling. With\nthis approach, we achieved a 33 fold increase in spin wave storage time over\nthe intrinsic spin coherence lifetime. Comparison between different decoupling\nsequences indicates that sequences insensitive to initial spin coherence\nincrease retrieval efficiency. Finally, an interference experiment shows that\nrelative phases of input pulses are preserved through the whole storage process\nwith a visibility close to 1, demonstrating the usefulness of dynamical\ndecoupling for extending the storage time of quantum memories.\n", "  We show that under appropriate conditions the impact of a very short and\nintense laser pulse onto a plasma causes the expulsion of surface electrons\nwith high energy in the direction opposite to the one of propagation of the\npulse. This is due to the combined effects of the ponderomotive force and the\nhuge longitudinal field arising from charge separation (\"slingshot effect\").\nThe effect should also be present with other states of matter, provided the\npulse is sufficiently intense to locally cause complete ionization. An\nexperimental test seems to be feasible and, if confirmed, would provide a new\nextraction and acceleration mechanism for electrons, alternative to traditional\nradio-frequency-based or Laser-Wake-Field ones.\n", "  We study the masses of the low-lying charmed mesons within the framework of\nheavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory. We work to third order in the chiral\nexpansion, where meson loops contribute. In contrast to previous approaches, we\nuse physical meson masses in evaluating these loops. This ensures that their\nimaginary parts are consistent with the observed widths of the D-mesons. The\nlowest odd- and even-parity, strange and nonstrange mesons provide enough\nconstraints to determine only certain linear combinations of the low-energy\nconstants in the effective Lagrangian. We comment on how lattice QCD could\nprovide further information to disentangle these constants.\n", "  We revisit the exact microscopic equations (in differential, and equivalent\nintegral form) ruling a relativistic cold plasma after the plane-wave Ansatz,\nwithout customary approximations. We show that in the Eulerian description the\nmotion of a very diluted plasma initially at rest and excited by an arbitrary\ntransverse plane electromagnetic travelling-wave has a very simple and explicit\ndependence on the transverse electromagnetic potential; for a non-zero density\nplasma the above motion is a good approximation of the real one as long as the\nback-reaction of the charges on the electromagnetic field can be neglected,\ni.e. for a time lapse decreasing with the plasma density, and can be used as\ninitial step in an iterative resolution scheme.\n  As one of many possible applications, we use these results to describe how\nthe ponderomotive force of a very intense and short plane laser pulse hitting\nnormally the surface of a plasma boosts the surface electrons into the ion\nbackground. Because of this penetration the electrons are then pulled back by\nthe electric force exerted by the ions and may leave the plasma with high\nenergy in the direction opposite to that of propagation of the pulse [G. Fiore,\nR. Fedele, U. De Angelis, \"The slingshot effect: a possible new laser-driven\nhigh energy acceleration mechanism for electrons\", arXiv:1309.1400].\n", "  In past ten years, modern societies developed enormous communication and\nsocial networks. Their classification and information retrieval processing\nbecome a formidable task for the society. Due to the rapid growth of World Wide\nWeb, social and communication networks, new mathematical methods have been\ninvented to characterize the properties of these networks on a more detailed\nand precise level. Various search engines are essentially using such methods.\nIt is highly important to develop new tools to classify and rank enormous\namount of network information in a way adapted to internal network structures\nand characteristics. This review describes the Google matrix analysis of\ndirected complex networks demonstrating its efficiency on various examples\nincluding World Wide Web, Wikipedia, software architecture, world trade, social\nand citation networks, brain neural networks, DNA sequences and Ulam networks.\nThe analytical and numerical matrix methods used in this analysis originate\nfrom the fields of Markov chains, quantum chaos and Random Matrix theory.\n", "  Social networks have been of much interest in recent years. We here focus on\na network structure derived from co-occurrences of people in traditional\nnewspaper media. We find three clear deviations from what can be expected in a\nrandom graph. First, the average degree in the empirical network is much lower\nthan expected, and the average weight of a link much higher than expected.\nSecondly, high degree nodes attract disproportionately much weight. Thirdly,\nrelatively much of the weight seems to concentrate between high degree nodes.\nWe believe this can be explained by the fact that most people tend to co-occur\nrepeatedly with the same people. We create a model that replicates these\nobservations qualitatively based on two self-reinforcing processes: (1) more\nfrequently occurring persons are more likely to occur again; and (2) if two\npeople co-occur frequently, they are more likely to co-occur again. This\nsuggest that the media tends to focus on people that are already in the news,\nand that they reinforce existing co-occurrences.\n", "  We develop a language for describing the relationship among observations,\nmathematical models, and the underlying principles from which they are derived.\nUsing Information Geometry, we consider geometric properties of statistical\nmodels for different observations. As observations are varied, the model\nmanifold may be stretched, compressed, or even collapsed. Observations that\npreserve the structural identifiability of the parameters also preserve certain\ntopological features (such as edges and corners) that characterize the model's\nunderlying physical principles. We introduce Information Topology in analogy\nwith information geometry as characterizing the \"abstract model\" of which\nstatistical models are realizations. Observations that change the topology,\ni.e., \"manifold collapse,\" require a modification of the abstract model in\norder to construct identifiable statistical models. Often, the essential\ntopological feature is a hierarchical structure of boundaries (faces, edges,\ncorners, etc.) which we represent as a hierarchical graph known as a Hasse\ndiagram. Low-dimensional elements of this diagram are simple models that\ndescribe the dominant behavioral modes, what we call emergent model classes.\nObservations that preserve the Hasse diagram are diffeomorphically related and\nform a group, the collection of which form a partially ordered set. All\npossible observations have a semi-group structure. For hierarchical models, we\nconsider how the topology of simple models is embedded in that of larger\nmodels. When emergent model classes are unstable to the introduction of new\nparameters, we classify the new parameters as relevant. Conversely, the\nemergent model classes are stable to the introduction of irrelevant parameters.\nIn this way, information topology provides a general language for exploring\nrepresentations of physical systems and their relationships to observations.\n", "  A class of Kaluza-Klein cosmological models in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity\nhave been investigated. In the work, we have considered the functional $f(R,T)$\nto be in the form $f(R,T)=f(R)+f(T)$ with $f(R)=\\lambda R$ and $f(T)=\\lambda\nT$. Such a choice of the functional $f(R,T)$ leads to an evolving effective\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ which depends on the stress energy tensor. The\nsource of the matter field is taken to be a perfect cosmic fluid. The exact\nsolutions of the field equations are obtained by considering a constant\ndeceleration parameter which leads two different aspects of the volumetric\nexpansion namely a power law and an exponential volumetric expansion. Keeping\nan eye on the accelerating nature of the universe in the present epoch, the\ndynamics and physical behaviour of the models have been discussed. From\nstatefinder diagnostic pair we found that the model with exponential volumetric\nexpansion behaves more like a $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  Interfacing between various elements of a computer - from memory to\nprocessors to long range communication - will be as critical for quantum\ncomputers as it is for classical computers today. Paramagnetic rare earth doped\ncrystals, such as Nd$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ (YSO), are excellent candidates for\nsuch a quantum interface: they are known to exhibit long optical coherence\nlifetimes (for communication via optical photons), possess a nuclear spin\n(memory) and have in addition an electron spin that can offer hybrid coupling\nwith superconducting qubits (processing). Here we study two of these three\nelements, demonstrating coherent storage and retrieval between electron and\n$^{145}$Nd nuclear spin states in Nd$^{3+}$:YSO. We find nuclear spin coherence\ntimes can reach 9 ms at $\\approx 5$ K, about two orders of magnitude longer\nthan the electron spin coherence, while quantum state and process tomography of\nthe storage/retrieval operation reveal an average state fidelity of 0.86. The\ntimes and fidelities are expected to further improve at lower temperatures and\nwith more homogeneous radio-frequency excitation.\n", "  This paper presents a multi-stage, multi-photon quantum key distribution\nprotocol based on the double-lock cryptography. It exploits the asymmetry in\nthe detection strategies between the legitimate users and the eavesdropper. The\nsecurity analysis of the protocol is presented with coherent states under the\nintercept-resend attack, the photon number splitting attack, and the\nman-in-the-middle attack. It is found that the mean photon number can be much\nlarger than one. This complements the recent interest in multi-photon quantum\ncommunication protocols that require a pre-shared key between the legitimate\nusers.\n", "  Dimension 2 is expected to be the lower critical dimension for Anderson\nlocalization in a time reversal-invariant disordered quantum system. Using an\natomic quasiperiodic kicked rotor -- equivalent to a two-dimensional\nAnderson-like model -- we experimentally study Anderson localization in\ndimension 2 and we observe localized wavefunction dynamics. We also show that\nthe localization length depends exponentially on the disorder strength and\nanisotropy and is in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the\nself-consistent theory for the 2D Anderson localization.\n", "  We continue our research Nucl.Phys B888, 92 (2014); Int. J. Mod. Phys. A29,\n1450159 (2014); Phys. Lett. B739, 110 (2014); Int. J. Mod. Phys. A30, 1550021\n(2015) and extend the class of finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with\nodd-valued parameters $\\lambda_{a}$, $a=1,2$, introduced in these works. In\ndoing so, we evaluate the Jacobians induced by finite BRST-antiBRST\ntransformations linear in functionally-dependent parameters, as well as those\ninduced by finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary functional\nparameters. The calculations cover the cases of gauge theories with a closed\nalgebra, dynamical systems with first-class constraints, and general gauge\ntheories. The resulting Jacobians in the case of linearized transformations are\ndifferent from those in the case of polynomial dependence on the parameters.\nFinite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary parameters induce an extra\ncontribution to the quantum action, which cannot be absorbed into a change of\nthe gauge. These transformations include an extended case of\nfunctionally-dependent parameters that implies a modified compensation\nequation, which admits non-trivial solutions leading to a Jacobian equal to\nunity. Finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with functionally-dependent\nparameters are applied to the Standard Model, and an explicit form of\nfunctionally-dependent parameters $\\lambda_{a}$ is obtained, providing the\nequivalence of path integrals in any $3$-parameter $R_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$-like\ngauges. The Gribov--Zwanziger theory is extended to the case of the Standard\nModel, and a form of the Gribov horizon functional is suggested in the Landau\ngauge, as well as in $R_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$-like gauges, in a gauge-independent\nway using field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations, and in\n$R_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$-like gauges using transverse-like non-Abelian gauge\nfields.\n", "  We prove the existence of exponentially localised and time-periodic solutions\nin general nonlinear Hamiltonian lattice systems. Like normal modes, these\nlocalised solutions are characterised by collective oscillations at the lattice\nsites with a uniform time-dependence. The proof of existence uses the\ncomparison principle for differential equations to demonstrate that at each\nlattice site every half of the fundamental period of oscillations, contributing\nto localised solutions of the nonlinear lattice, is sandwiched between two\noscillatory states of auxiliary linear equations. For soft (hard) on-site\npotentials the allowed frequencies of the in-phase (out-of-phase) localised\nperiodic solutions lie below (above) the lower (upper) value of the linear\nspectrum of phonon frequencies. By varying a control parameter the exponential\ndecay of the localised states can be tuned continuously.\n", "  Interactions between microorganisms and their complex flowing environments\nare essential in many biological systems. We develop a model for microswimmer\ndynamics in non-Newtonian Poiseuille flows. We predict that swimmers in\nshear-thickening (-thinning) fluids migrate upstream more (less) quickly than\nin Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that viscoelastic normal stress differences\nreorient swimmers causing them to migrate upstream at the centreline, in\ncontrast to well-known boundary accumulation in quiescent Newtonian fluids.\nBased on these observations, we suggest a sorting mechanism to select microbes\nby swimming speed.\n", "  Magnetoresistance (MR) of ion irradiated monolayer graphene samples with\nvariable-range hopping (VRH) mechanism of conductivity was measured at\ntemperatures down to $T = 1.8$ K in magnetic fields up to $B = 8$ T. It was\nobserved that in perpendicular magnetic fields, hopping resistivity $R$\ndecreases, which corresponds to negative MR (NMR), while parallel magnetic\nfield results in positive MR (PMR) at low temperatures. NMR is explained on the\nbasis of the \"orbital\" model in which perpendicular magnetic field suppresses\nthe destructive interference of many paths through the intermediate sites in\nthe total probability of the long-distance tunneling in the VRH regime. At low\nfields, a quadratic dependence ($|\\Delta R/R|\\sim B^2$) of NMR is observed,\nwhile at $B > B^*$, the quadratic dependence is replaced by the linear one. It\nwas found that all NMR curves for different samples and different temperatures\ncould be merged into common dependence when plotted as a function of $B/B^*$.\nIt is shown that $B^*\\sim T^{1/2}$ in agreement with predictions of the\n\"orbital\" model. The obtained values of $B^*$ allowed also to estimate the\nlocalization radius $\\xi$ of charge carriers for samples with different degree\nof disorder. PMR in parallel magnetic fields is explained by suppression of\nhopping transitions via double occupied states due to alignment of electron\nspins.\n", "  We perform a detailed quantitative analysis of the recent AMS-02 electron and\npositron data. We investigate the interplay between the emission from primary\nastrophysical sources, namely Supernova Remnants and Pulsar Wind Nebulae, and\nthe contribution from a dark matter annihilation or decay signal. Our aim is to\nassess the information that can be derived on dark matter properties when both\ndark matter and primary astrophysical sources are assumed to jointly contribute\nto the leptonic observables measured by the AMS-02 experiment. We investigate\nboth the possibility to set robust constraints on the dark matter\nannihilation/decay rate and the possibility to look for dark matter signals\nwithin realistic models that take into account the full complexity of the\nastrophysical background. Our results show that AMS-02 data enable to probe\nefficiently vast regions of the dark matter parameter space and, in some cases,\nto set constraints on the dark matter annihilation/decay rate that are\ncomparable or even stronger than the ones derived from other indirect detection\nchannels.\n", "  The interaction of a rotating star's magnetic field with a surrounding plasma\ndisk lies at the heart of many questions posed by neutron stars in X-ray\nbinaries. We consider the opening of stellar magnetic flux due to differential\nrotation along field lines coupling the star and disk, using a simple model for\nthe disk-opened flux, the torques exerted on the star by the magnetosphere, and\nthe power extracted by the electromagnetic wind. We examine the conditions\nunder which the system enters an equilibrium spin state, in which the accretion\ntorque is instantaneously balanced by the pulsar wind torque alone. For\nmagnetic moments, spin frequencies, and accretion rates relevant to accreting\nmillisecond pulsars, the spin-down torque from this enhanced pulsar wind can be\nsubstantially larger than that predicted by existing models of the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction, and is in principle capable of maintaining spin\nequilibrium at frequencies less than 1 kHz. We speculate that this mechanism\nmay account for the non-detection of frequency increases during outbursts of\nSAX J1808.4-3658 and XTE J1814-338, and may be generally responsible for\npreventing spin-up to sub-millisecond periods. If the pulsar wind is collimated\nby the surrounding environment, the resulting jet can satisfy the power\nrequirements of the highly relativistic outflows from Cir X-1 and Sco X-1. In\nthis framework, the jet power scales relatively weakly with accretion rate, L_j\n~ Mdot^{4/7}, and would be suppressed at high accretion rates only if the\nstellar magnetic moment is sufficiently low.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy reveals chemically specific information and provides\nlabel-free insight into the molecular world. However, the signals are\nintrinsically weak and call for enhancement techniques. Here, we demonstrate\nPurcell enhancement of Raman scattering in a tunable high-finesse microcavity,\nand utilize it for molecular diagnostics by combined Raman and absorption\nimaging. Studying individual single-wall carbon nanotubes, we identify crucial\nstructural parameters such as nanotube radius, electronic structure and\nextinction cross-section. We observe a 320-times enhanced Raman scattering\nspectral density and an effective Purcell factor of 6.2, together with a\ncollection efficiency of 60%. Potential for significantly higher enhancement,\nquantitative signals, inherent spectral filtering and absence of intrinsic\nbackground in cavity-vacuum stimulated Raman scattering render the technique a\npromising tool for molecular imaging. Furthermore, cavity-enhanced Raman\ntransitions involving localized excitons could potentially be used for gaining\nquantum control over nanomechanical motion and open a route for molecular\ncavity optomechanics.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on volborthite single crystals showing a wide\n1/3-magnetization plateau, we perform microscopic modeling by means of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) with the single-crystal structural data as a starting\npoint. Using DFT+U, we find four leading magnetic exchanges: antiferromagnetic\nJ and J2, as well as ferromagnetic J' and J1. Simulations of the derived spin\nHamiltonian show good agreement with the experimental low-field magnetic\nsusceptibility and high-field magnetization data. The 1/3-plateau phase\npertains to polarized magnetic trimers formed by strong J bonds. An effective\nJ$\\rightarrow\\infty$ model shows a tendency towards condensation of magnon\nbound states preceding the plateau phase.\n", "  Observations of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect measure the\ndensity-weighted velocity field, a potentially powerful cosmological probe.\nThis paper presents an analytical method to predict the power spectrum and\ntwo-point correlation function of the density-weighted velocity in redshift\nspace, the direct observables in kSZ surveys. We show a simple relation between\nthe density power spectrum and the density-weighted velocity power spectrum\nthat holds for both dark matter and halos. Using this relation, we can then\nextend familiar perturbation expansion techniques to the kSZ power spectrum.\nOne of the most important features of density-weighted velocity statistics in\nredshift space is the change in sign of the cross-correlation between the\ndensity and density-weighted velocity at mildly small scales due to nonlinear\nredshift space distortions. Our model can explain this characteristic feature\nwithout any free parameters. As a result, our results can precisely predict the\nnon-linear behavior of the density-weighted velocity field in redshift space up\nto $\\sim30\\ h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc}$ for dark matter particles at the redshifts of\n$z=0.0$, $0.5$, and $1.0$.\n", "  We analyze the impact of strong correlations on the surface states of a\nthree-dimensional topological Kondo insulator. An important observation is that\ncorrelations are strongly increased at the surface, which leads to an\nenergetical confinement of the surface $f$-electrons into a narrow window\naround the Fermi energy at low enough temperature. This correlation effect in\ncombination with the nontrivial topology has two remarkable consequences: (i)\ncoexistence of light and heavy surface states at low temperatures. While heavy\nsurface states are formed directly in the surface layer, light surface states\nare formed in the next-nearest surface layer. Furthermore, (ii) with increasing\nthe temperature, the heavy surface states become incoherent and only light\nsurface states can be observed. The coexistence of light and heavy surface\nstates is thereby a remarkable characteristic of the combination of strong\ncorrelations and nontrivial topology. We believe that these results are\napplicable to the candidate topological Kondo insulator SmB6.\n", "  Crystals of superconducting Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$ ($T_{\\text{c}}=9.8$ K) and\nMo$_{\\text{8-x}}$V$_{\\text{x}}$Ga$_{41}$ limited solid solution\n$(x_{\\text{max}}=1.9(2))$ have been grown from the high-temperature Ga flux and\nconfirmed to have the V$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$ type of crystal structure at room\ntemperature. Thermodynamic and transport measurements as well as electronic\nstructure calculations were performed to investigate both normal- and\nsuperconducting-state properties of Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$. The discontinuity in the\nheat capacity at $T_{\\text{c}}$,\n$\\Delta{}c_{\\text{p}}/\\gamma_{\\text{N}}T_{\\text{c}}=2.83$ in zero magnetic\nfield, indicates a much stronger electron-phonon coupling than in the standard\nBCS limit. From the heat capacity data, we estimated the electron-phonon\ncoupling constant $\\lambda_{\\text{ep}}=0.9$. The upper critical field is\n$\\mu_{0}H_{\\text{c2}}(0)=8.3$ T, while the lower one is only\n$\\mu_{0}H_{\\text{c1}}(0)=131$ Oe. The upper critical field of Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$\nexhibits a clear enhancement with respect to the Werthamer-Helfand-Honenberg\nprediction, consistent with the strong electron-phonon coupling. The\nMo$_{\\text{8-x}}$V$_{\\text{x}}$Ga$_{41}$ limited solid solution also exhibits\nsuperconducting properties, and the critical temperature $T_{\\text{c}}$ is\nreduced only slightly with increasing $x$.\n", "  We calculate the bound state spectrum of the highly excited valence electron\nin the heavy alkali atoms solving the radial Schr\\\"odinger eigenvalue problem\nnumerically with an accurate spectral collocation algorithm that applies also\nfor a large principal quantum number $n\\gg1$. As an effective single-particle\npotential we favor the reputable potential of Marinescu \\emph{et al}., {[}Phys.\nRev.A \\textbf{49}, 982(1994){]}. Recent quasiclassical calculations of the\nquantum defect of the valence electron agree for orbital angular momentum\n$l=0,1,2,...$ overall remarkably well with the results of the numerical\ncalculations, but for the Rydberg states of rubidium and also cesium with $l=3$\nthis agreement is less fair. The reason for this anomaly is that the potential\nacquires for $l=3$ deep inside the ionic core a tiny second classical region,\nthus invalidating a standard WKB calculation with two widely spaced turning\npoints. Comparing then our numerical solutions of the radial Schr\\\"odinger\neigenvalue problem with the uniform analytic WKB approximation of Langer we\nobserve everywhere a remarkable agreement, apart from a tiny region around the\ninner turning point. With help of an ansatz proposed by Fock we obtain for the\n\\emph{s}-states a second uniform analytic approximation to the radial wave\nfunction complementary to the WKB approximation of Langer, which is exact for\n$r\\to0^{+}$. The value of the radial \\emph{s}-wave function at $r=0$ is\nanalytically found, thus validating the Fermi-Segr\\`e formula for the magnetic\ndipole interaction constant $A_{n,j,0}^{\\left(\\mathrm{HFS}\\right)}$.\n", "  Magnetotactic swimmers tend to align along magnetic field lines against\nstochastic reorientations. We show that the swimming strategy, e.g. active\nBrownian motion versus run-and-tumble dynamics, strongly affects the\norientation statistics. The latter can exhibit a velocity condensation whereby\nthe alignment probability density diverges. As a consequence, we find that the\nswimming strategy affects the nature of the phase transition to collective\nmotion, indicating that L\\'evy run-and-tumble walks can outperform active\nBrownian processes as strategies to trigger collective behavior.\n", "  The electric field in an extended phase of a liquid electrolyte exposed to a\ntemperature gradient is attributed to different thermophoretic mobilities of\nthe ion species. As shown herein, such Soret-type ion thermodiffusion is not\nrequired to induce thermoelectricity even in the simplest electrolyte if it is\nconfined between charged walls. The space charge of the electric double layer\nleads to selective ion diffusion driven by a temperature-dependent\nelectrophoretic ion mobility, which -for narrow channels- may cause\nthermo-voltages larger in magnitude than for the classical Soret equilibrium.\n", "  We consider a generalisation of thermodynamics that deals with multiple\nconserved quantities at the level of individual quantum systems. Each conserved\nquantity, which, importantly, need not commute with the rest, can be extracted\nand stored in its own battery. Unlike in standard thermodynamics, where the\nsecond law places a constraint on how much of the conserved quantity (energy)\nthat can be extracted, here, on the contrary, there is no limit on how much of\nany individual conserved quantity that can be extracted. However, other\nconserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the\ncombination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them which are\nallowed. We present explicit protocols which allow us to perform arbitrarily\ngood trade-offs and extract arbitrarily good combinations of conserved\nquantities from individual quantum systems.\n", "  Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) allow us to pinpoint and study\nstar-forming galaxies in the early universe, thanks to their orders of\nmagnitude brighter peak luminosities compared to other astrophysical sources,\nand their association with deaths of massive stars. We present Hubble Space\nTelescope Wide Field Camera 3 detections of three Swift GRB host galaxies lying\nat redshifts $z = 5.913$ (GRB 130606A), $z = 6.295$ (GRB 050904), and $z =\n6.327$ (GRB 140515A) in the F140W (wide-$JH$ band,\n$\\lambda_{\\rm{obs}}\\sim1.4\\,\\mu m$) filter. The hosts have magnitudes\n(corrected for Galactic extinction) of $m_{\\rm{\\lambda_{obs},AB}}=\n26.34^{+0.14}_{-0.16}, 27.56^{+0.18}_{-0.22},$ and $28.30^{+0.25}_{-0.33}$\nrespectively. In all three cases the probability of chance coincidence of lower\nredshift galaxies is $\\lesssim2\\,\\%$, indicating that the detected galaxies are\nmost likely the GRB hosts. These are the first detections of high redshift ($z\n> 5$) GRB host galaxies in emission. The galaxies have luminosities in the\nrange $0.1-0.6\\,L^{*}_{z=6}$ (with $M_{1600}^{*}=-20.95\\pm0.12$), and\nhalf-light radii in the range $0.6-0.9\\,\\rm{kpc}$. Both their half-light radii\nand luminosities are consistent with existing samples of Lyman-break galaxies\nat $z\\sim6$. Spectroscopic analysis of the GRB afterglows indicate low\nmetallicities ($[\\rm{M/H}]\\lesssim-1$) and low dust extinction\n($A_{\\rm{V}}\\lesssim0.1$) along the line of sight. Using stellar population\nsynthesis models, we explore the implications of each galaxy's luminosity for\nits possible star formation history, and consider the potential for\nemission-line metallicity determination with the upcoming James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n", "  We briefly report on the recently proposed [G. Fiore, R. Fedele, U. de\nAngelis, Phys. Plasmas 21 (2014), 113105], [G. Fiore, S. De Nicola,\narXiv:1509.04656] electron acceleration mechanism named \"slingshot effect\":\nunder suitable conditions the impact of an ultra-short and ultra-intense laser\npulse against the surface of a low-density plasma is expected to cause the\nexpulsion of a bunch of superficial electrons with high energy in the direction\nopposite to that of the pulse propagation; this is due to the interplay of the\nhuge ponderomotive force, huge longitudinal field arising from charge\nseparation, and the finite size of the laser spot.\n", "  In this paper we present a method to accurately compute the energy of the\nmagnetostatic interaction between linearly (or uniformly, as a special case)\nmagnetized polyhedrons. The method has applications in finite element\nmicromagnetics, or more generally in computing the magnetostatic interaction\nwhen the magnetization is represented using the finite element method (FEM).\n  The magnetostatic energy is described by a six-fold integral that is singular\nwhen the interaction regions overlap, making direct numerical evaluation\nproblematic. To resolve the singularity, we evaluate four of the six iterated\nintegrals analytically resulting in a 2d integral over the surface of a\npolyhedron, which is nonsingular and can be integrated numerically. This\nprovides a more accurate and efficient way of computing the magnetostatic\nenergy integral compared to existing approaches.\n  The method was developed to facilitate the evaluation of the demagnetizing\ninteraction between neighouring elements in finite-element micromagnetics and\nprovides a possibility to compute the demagnetizing field using efficient fast\nmultipole or tree code algorithms.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering allows two parties to verify their\nentanglement, even if one party's measurements are untrusted. This concept has\nnot only provided new insights into the nature of non-local spatial\ncorrelations in quantum mechanics, but also serves as a resource for one-sided\ndevice-independent quantum information tasks. Here, we investigate how EPR\nsteering behaves when one-half of a maximally-entangled pair of qudits\n(multidimensional quantum systems) is cloned by a universal cloning machine. We\nfind that EPR steering, as verified by a criterion based on the mutual\ninformation between qudits, can only be found in one of the copy subsystems but\nnot both. We prove that this is also true for the single-system analogue of EPR\nsteering. We find that this restriction, which we term \"no-cloning of quantum\nsteering\", elucidates the physical reason why steering can be used to secure\nsources and channels against cloning-based attacks when implementing quantum\ncommunication and quantum computation protocols.\n", "  We fabricate planar all-graphene field-effect transistors with self-aligned\nside-gates at 100 nm from the main graphene conductive channel, using a single\nlithographic step. We demonstrate side-gating below 1V with conductance\nmodulation of 35% and transconductance up to 0.5 mS/mm at 10 mV drain bias. We\nmeasure the planar leakage along the SiO2/vacuum gate dielectric over a wide\nvoltage range, reporting rapidly growing current above 15 V. We unveil the\nmicroscopic mechanisms driving the leakage, as Frenkel-Poole transport through\nSiO2 up to the activation of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling in vacuum, which becomes\ndominant at high voltages. We report a field-emission current density as high\nas 1uA/um between graphene flakes. These findings are essential for the\nminiaturization of atomically thin devices.\n", "  In this Letter we prove a simple theorem in quantum information theory, which\nimplies that bulk operators in the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory\n(AdS/CFT) correspondence can be reconstructed as CFT operators in a spatial\nsubregion $A$, provided that they lie in its entanglement wedge. This is an\nimprovement on existing reconstruction methods, which have at most succeeded in\nthe smaller causal wedge. The proof is a combination of the recent work of\nJafferis, Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh on the quantum relative entropy of a\nCFT subregion with earlier ideas interpreting the correspondence as a quantum\nerror correcting code.\n", "  We present a fast method for numerically solving the inhomogeneous Helmholtz\nequation. Our iterative method is based on the Born series, which we modified\nto achieve convergence for scattering media of arbitrary size and scattering\nstrength. Compared to pseudospectral time-domain simulations, our modified Born\napproach is two orders of magnitude faster and nine orders of magnitude more\naccurate in benchmark tests in 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional systems.\n", "  We review design and development decisions and their impact for the open\nsource code Nmag from a software engineering in computational science point of\nview. We summarise lessons learned and recommendations for future computational\nscience projects. Key lessons include that encapsulating the simulation\nfunctionality in a library of a general purpose language, here Python, provides\ngreat flexibility in using the software. The choice of Python for the top-level\nuser interface was very well received by users from the science and engineering\ncommunity. The from-source installation in which required external libraries\nand dependencies are compiled from a tarball was remarkably robust. In places,\nthe code is a lot more ambitious than necessary, which introduces unnecessary\ncomplexity and reduces main- tainability. Tests distributed with the package\nare useful, although more unit tests and continuous integration would have been\ndesirable. The detailed documentation, together with a tutorial for the usage\nof the system, was perceived as one of its main strengths by the community.\n", "  We investigate the output generation of squeezed radiation of a cavity photon\nmode coupled to another off-resonant bosonic excitation. By modulating in time\ntheir linear interaction, we predict high degree of output squeezing when the\ndispersive ultrastrong coupling regime is achieved, i.e., when the interaction\nrate becomes comparable to the frequency of the lowest energy mode. Our work\npaves the way to squeezed light generation in frequency domains where the\nultrastrong coupling is obtained, e.g., solid-state resonators in the GHz, THz\nand mid-IR spectral range.\n", "  Quantum memories for optical and microwave photons provide key\nfunctionalities in quantum processing and communications. Here we propose a\nprotocol well adapted to solid state ensemble based memories coupled to\ncavities. It is called Stark Echo Modulation Memory (SEMM), and allows large\nstorage bandwidths and low noise. This is achieved in a echo like sequence\ncombined with phase shifts induced by small electric fields through the linear\nStark effect. We investigated the protocol for rare earth nuclear spins and\nfound a high suppression of unwanted collective emissions that is compatible\nwith single photon level operation. Broadband storage together with high\nfidelity for the Stark retrieval process is also demonstrated. SEMM could be\nused to store optical or microwave photons in ions and/or spins. This includes\nNV centers in diamond and rare earth doped crystals, which are among the most\npromising solid-state quantum memories.\n", "  We discuss a candidate for a minimal interacting 4-dimensional N=1\nsuperconformal field theory (SCFT). The model contains a chiral primary\noperator u satisfying the chiral ring relation u^2=0, and its scaling dimension\nis \\Delta(u)=1.5. The model is derived by turning on a N=1 preserving\ndeformation of N=2 A2 Argyres-Douglas theory. The central charges are given by\n(a,c)=(263/768, 271/768) ~ (0.342,0.353). There is no moduli space of vacua, no\nflavor symmetry, and the chiral ring is finite.\n", "  We derive the exact third-order analytic solution of the matter density\nfluctuation in the proper-time hypersurface in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe,\naccounting for the explicit time-dependence and clarifying the relation to the\ninitial condition. Furthermore, we compare our analytic solution to the\nprevious calculation in the comoving gauge, and to the standard Newtonian\nperturbation theory by providing Fourier kernels for the relativistic effects.\nOur results provide an essential ingredient for a complete description of\ngalaxy bias in the relativistic context.\n", "  We study the microwave impedance of extremely high aspect ratio (length/width\n~ 5,000) superconducting niobium nitride nanowires. The nanowires are\nfabricated in a compact meander geometry that is in series with the center\nconductor of a 50 ohm coplanar waveguide transmission line. The transmission\ncoefficient of the sample is measured up to 20 GHz. At high frequency, a peak\nin the transmission coefficient is seen. Numerical simulations show that this\nis a half-wave resonance along the length of the nanowire, where the nanowire\nacts as a high impedance, slow wave transmission line. This resonance sets the\nupper frequency limit for these nanowires as inductive elements. Fitting\nsimulations to the measured resonance enables a precise determination of the\nnanowire's complex sheet impedance at the resonance frequency. The real part is\na measure of dissipation, while the imaginary part is dominated by kinetic\ninductance. We characterize the dependence of the sheet resistance and sheet\ninductance on both temperature and current and compare the results to recent\ntheoretical predictions for disordered superconductors. These results can aid\nin the understanding of high frequency devices based on superconducting\nnanowires. They may also lead to the development of novel superconducting\ndevices such as ultra-compact resonators and slow-wave structures.\n", "  We report on the transport properties of hybrid devices obtained by\ndepositing graphene on a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 oxide junction hosting a 4 nm-deep\ntwo-dimensional electron system. At low graphene-oxide inter-layer bias the two\nelectron systems are electrically isolated, despite their small spatial\nseparation, and very efficient reciprocal gating is shown. A pronounced\nrectifying behavior is observed for larger bias values and ascribed to the\ninterplay between electrostatic depletion and tunneling across the LaAlO3\nbarrier. The relevance of these results in the context of strongly-coupled\nbilayer systems is discussed.\n", "  The increase of a thermoelectric material's figure of merit (ZT value) is\nlimited by the interplay of the transport coefficients. Here we report the\ngreatly enhanced thermoelectric performance of a ZrS2 monolayer by the biaxial\ntensile strain, due to the simultaneous increase of the Seebeck coefficient and\ndecrease of the thermal conductivity. Based on the first-principles\ncalculations combined with the Boltzmann transport theory, we predict the band\ngap of the ZrS2 monolayer can be effectively engineered by the strain and the\nSeebeck coefficient is significantly increased. The thermal conductivity is\nreduced by the applied tensile strain due to the phonon softening. At the\nstrain of 6%, the maximal ZT value of 2.4 is obtained for the p-type doped ZrS2\nmonolayer at 300 K, which is 4.3 times larger than that of the unstrained\nsystem.\n", "  We propose an approach to solve the stochastic neutron point kinetics\nequations using an adaptation of the diagonalization-decomposition method\n(DDM). This new approach (Double-DDM) yields a nonstiff solution for the\nstochastic formulation, allowing the calculation of the neutron and precursor\ndensities at any time of interest without the need of using progressive time\nsteps. We use Double-DDM to compute results for stochastic problems with\nconstant, linear, and sinusoidal reactivities. We show that these results\nstrongly agree with those obtained by other approaches established in the\nliterature. We also compute and analyze the first four statistical moments of\nthe solutions.\n", "  The standard model predicts that, in addition to a proton, an electron, and\nan antineutrino, a continuous spectrum of photons is emitted in the $\\beta$\ndecay of the free neutron. We report on the RDK II experiment which measured\nthe photon spectrum using two different detector arrays. An annular array of\nbismuth germanium oxide scintillators detected photons from 14 to 782~keV. The\nspectral shape was consistent with theory, and we determined a branching ratio\nof 0.00335 $\\pm$ 0.00005 [stat] $\\pm$ 0.00015 [syst]. A second detector array\nof large area avalanche photodiodes directly detected photons from 0.4 to\n14~keV. For this array, the spectral shape was consistent with theory, and the\nbranching ratio was determined to be 0.00582 $\\pm$ 0.00023 [stat] $\\pm$ 0.00062\n[syst]. We report the first precision test of the shape of the photon energy\nspectrum from neutron radiative decay and a substantially improved\ndetermination of the branching ratio over a broad range of photon energies.\n", "  Small lattice bipolarons driven by external harmonic fields are considered in\nthe adiabatic approximation. Resonant excitation of ions modulates the trapping\npotential and promotes hole transfer between neighboring atomic layers. It\nleads to a dramatic decrease of the apparent bipolaron mass compared to the\nundriven case. This effect offers an explanation for dynamic stabilization of\nsuperconductivity at high temperatures recently observed in layered cuprates.\n", "  The lifetime of the $B^{0}_{s}$ meson is measured in the decay channel\n$B^{0}_{s} \\to J/\\psi\\mbox{ }\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ with $880 \\leq M_{\\pi^+\\pi^-} \\leq\n1080$ MeV/$c^2$, which is mainly a CP-odd state and dominated by the\n$f_{0}(980)$ resonance. In 10.4 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the D0\ndetector in Run II of the Tevatron, the lifetime of the $B^{0}_{s}$ meson is\nmeasured to be $\\tau(B^{0}_{s}) = 1.70\\pm 0.14 \\mbox{ (stat)} \\pm 0.05 \\mbox{\n(syst) ps}$. Neglecting CP violation in $B_s^0/\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing, the\nmeasurement can be translated into the width of the heavy mass eigenstate of\nthe $B^0_s$, $\\Gamma_H = 0.59 \\pm 0.05 \\mbox{ (stat)} \\pm 0.02 \\mbox{ (syst)}\n\\mbox{ ps$^{-1}$}$.\n", "  We investigate the band structure of BaBiO$_{3}$, an insulating parent\ncompound of doped high-$T_{c}$ superconductors, using \\emph{in situ}\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on thin films. The data compare\nfavorably overall with density functional theory calculations within the local\ndensity approximation, demonstrating that electron correlations are weak. The\nbands exhibit Brillouin zone folding consistent with known BiO$_{6}$ breathing\ndistortions. Though the distortions are often thought to coincide with\nBi$^{3+}$/Bi$^{5+}$ charge ordering, core level spectra show that bismuth is\nmonovalent. We further demonstrate that the bands closest to the Fermi level\nare primarily oxygen derived, while the bismuth $6s$ states mostly contribute\nto dispersive bands at deeper binding energy. The results support a model of\nBi-O charge transfer in which hole pairs are localized on combinations of the O\n$2p$ orbitals.\n", "  We report thermodynamic properties, magnetic ground state, and microscopic\nmagnetic model of the spin-1 frustrated antiferromaget Li$_{2}$NiW$_{2}$O$_{8}$\nshowing successive transitions at $T_{\\rm N1}\\simeq 18$ K and $T_{\\rm N2}\\simeq\n12.5$ K in zero field. Nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron diffraction\nreveal collinear and commensurate magnetic order with the propagation vector\n$\\mathbf k=(\\frac12,0,\\frac12)$ below $T_{\\rm N2}$. The ordered moment of 1.8\n$\\mu_B$ at 1.5 K is directed along $[0.89(9),-0.10(5),-0.49(6)]$ and matches\nthe magnetic easy axis of spin-1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions, which is determined by the\nscissor-like distortion of the NiO$_6$ octahedra. Incommensurate magnetic\norder, presumably of spin-density-wave type, is observed in the region between\n$T_{\\rm N2}$ and $T_{\\rm N1}$. Density-functional band-structure calculations\nput forward a three-dimensional spin lattice with spin-1 chains running along\nthe $[01\\bar 1]$ direction and stacked on a spatially anisotropic triangular\nlattice in the $ab$ plane. We show that the collinear magnetic order in\nLi$_2$NiW$_2$O$_8$ is incompatible with the triangular lattice geometry and\nthus driven by a pronounced easy-axis single-ion anisotropy of Ni$^{2+}$.\n", "  Current searches for gravitational waves from compact-object binaries with\nthe LIGO and Virgo observatories employ waveform models with spins aligned (or\nanti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum. Here, we derive a new\nstatistic to search for compact objects carrying generic (precessing) spins.\nApplying this statistic, we construct banks of both aligned- and generic-spin\ntemplates for binary black holes and neutron-star--black-hole binaries, and\ncompare the effectualness of these banks towards simulated populations of\ngeneric-spin systems. We then use these banks in a pipeline analysis of\nGaussian noise to measure the increase in background incurred by using generic-\ninstead of aligned-spin banks. Although the generic-spin banks have a factor of\nten to twenty more templates than the aligned-spin banks, we find an overall\nimprovement in signal recovery at fixed false-alarm rate for systems with\nhigh-mass ratio and highly precessing spins ---up to 60\\% for\nneutron-star--black-hole mergers. This gain in sensitivity comes at a small\nloss of sensitivity ($\\lesssim$4\\%) for systems that are already well-covered\nby aligned-spin templates. Since the observation of even a single binary merger\nwith misalinged spins could provide unique astrophysical insights into the\nformation of these sources, we recommend that the method described here be\ndeveloped further to mount a viable search for generic-spin binary mergers in\nLIGO/Virgo data.\n", "  We investigate dust entrainment by photoevaporative winds in protoplanetary\ndiscs using dusty smoothed particle hydrodrodynamics (SPH). We use unequal-mass\nparticles to resolve more than five orders of magnitude in disc/outflow density\nand a one-fluid formulation to efficiently simulate an equivalent magnitude\nrange in drag stopping time. We find that only micron sized dust grains and\nsmaller can be entrained in EUV driven winds. The maximum grain size is set by\ndust settling in the disc rather than aerodynamic drag in the wind. More\ngenerally, there is a linear relationship between the base flow density and the\nmaximum entrainable grain size in the wind. A pileup of micron sized dust\ngrains can occur in the upper atmosphere at critical radii in the disc as\ngrains decouple from the low-density wind. Entrainment is a strong function of\nlocation in the disc, resulting in a size sorting of grains in the\noutflow---the largest grain being carried out between $10$--$20\\,$AU. The peak\ndust density for each grain size occurs at the inner edge of its own\nentrainment region.\n", "  We propose to control light trapping in a large ensemble of cold atoms by an\nexternal, static magnetic field. For an appropriate choice of frequency and\npolarization of the exciting pulse, the field is expected to speed up the\nfluorescence of a dilute atomic system. In a dense ensemble, the field does not\naffect the early-time superradiant signal but amplifies intensity fluctuations\nat intermediate times and induces a very slow, nonexponential long-time decay.\nThe slowing down of fluorescence is due to the excitation of spatially\nlocalized collective atomic states that appear only under a strong magnetic\nfield and have exponentially long lifetimes. Our results therefore pave a way\ntowards experimental observation of the disorder-induced localization of light\nin cold atomic systems.\n", "  We calculate the high and low scale threshold corrections to the D=6 proton\ndecay mode in supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theories with\nhigher-dimensional representation Higgs multiplets. In particular, we focus on\na missing-partner model in which the grand unified group is spontaneously\nbroken by the 75-dimensional Higgs multiplet and the doublet-triplet splitting\nproblem is solved. We find that in the missing-partner model the D=6 proton\ndecay rate gets suppressed by about 60%, mainly due to the threshold effect at\nthe GUT scale, while the SUSY-scale threshold corrections are found to be less\nprominent when sfermions are heavy.\n", "  We study the holographic entanglement entropy in metal/superconductor phase\ntransition with exponential nonlinear electrodynamics (ENE) in four and five\ndimensional spacetimes. We find that the holographic entanglement entropy is\npowerful tool in studying the properties of the holographic phase transition.\nFor the operator $\\langle\\mathcal{O}_{+}\\rangle$, we observe that the\nentanglement entropy in 4-dimensional spacetime decreases in metal phase but\nchanges non-monotonously in superconducting phase with the increase of the ENE\nparameter. Interestingly, the change of the entanglement entropy in\n5-dimensional spacetime for both the phases is monotonous as the ENE factor\nalters. For the operator $\\langle\\mathcal{O}_{-}\\rangle$, we show that the\nbehavior of entanglement entropy in four and five dimensions changes\nmonotonously for both phases as one tunes the strength of the ENE. Furthermore,\nfor both the operators the entanglement entropy in four or five dimensional\nblack hole increases with the increase of the width of the region.\n", "  Quantum steering is observed when performing appropriate local measurements\non an entangled state. Here we discuss the possibility of simulating\nclassically this effect, using classical communication instead of entanglement.\nWe show that infinite communication is necessary for exactly simulating\nsteering for any pure entangled state, as well as for a class of mixed\nentangled states. Moreover, we discuss the communication cost of steering for\ngeneral entangled states, as well as approximate simulation. Our findings\nreveal striking differences between Bell nonlocality and steering, and provide\na natural way of measuring the strength of the latter.\n", "  In this review we discuss and compare the usage of simplified models and\nEffective Field Theory (EFT) approaches in dark matter searches. We provide a\nstate of the art description on the subject of EFTs and simplified models,\nespecially in the context of collider searches for dark matter, but also with\nimplications for direct and indirect detection searches, with the aim of\nconstituting a common language for future comparisons between different\nstrategies. The material is presented in a form that is as self-contained as\npossible, so that it may serve as an introductory review for the newcomer as\nwell as a reference guide for the practitioner.\n", "  We address nonradiative recombination pathways by leveraging surface\npassivation and dislocation management in micron-scale arrays of Ge crystals\ngrown on deeply patterned Si substrates. The time decay photoluminescence (PL)\nat cryogenic temperatures discloses carrier lifetimes approaching 45 ns in\nband-gap engineered Ge micro-crystals. This investigation provides compelling\ninformation about the competitive interplay between the radiative band-edge\ntransitions and the trapping of carriers by dislocations and free surfaces.\nFurthermore, an in-depth analysis of the temperature dependence of the PL,\ncombined with capacitance data and finite difference time domain modeling,\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of GeO2 in passivating the surface of Ge and\nthus in enhancing the room temperature PL emission.\n", "  We study the masses of the low-lying charm and bottom mesons within the\nframework of heavy- hadron chiral perturbation theory (HHChPT). We work to\nthird order in the chiral expansion, where meson loops contribute. In contrast\nto previous approaches, we use physical meson masses in evaluating these loops.\nThis ensures that their imaginary parts are consistent with the observed widths\nof the D-mesons. The lowest odd- and even-parity, strange and nonstrange charm\nmesons provide enough constraints to determine only certain linear combinations\nof the low-energy constants (LECs) in the effective Lagrangian. We comment on\nhow lattice QCD could provide further information to disentangle these\nconstants. Then we use the results from the charm sector to predict the\nspectrum of odd- and even-parity of the bottom mesons. The predicted masses\nfrom our theory are in good agreement with experimentally measured masses for\nthe case of the odd-parity sector. For the even-parity sector, the B-meson\nstates have not yet been observed; thus, our results provide useful information\nfor experimentalists investigating such states. The near degeneracy of\nnonstrange and strange scalar B mesons is confirmed in our predictions using\nHHChPT. We show why previous approaches of using HHChPT in studying the mass\ndegeneracy in the scalar states of charm and bottom meson sectors gave\nunsatisfactory results.\n", "  Kitaev's honeycomb-lattice compass model describes a spin liquid with\nemergent fractionalized excitations. Here we study the physics of isolated\nmagnetic impurities coupled to the Kitaev spin-liquid host. We reformulate this\nKondo-type problem in terms of a many-state quantum impurity coupled to a\nmultichannel bath of Majorana fermions and present the numerically exact\nsolution using Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique. Quantum\nphase transitions occur as a function of Kondo coupling and locally applied\nfield. At zero field, the impurity moment is partially screened only when it\nbinds an emergent gauge flux, and otherwise becomes free at low temperatures.\nWe show how Majorana degrees of freedom determine the fixed-point properties,\nmake contact with Kondo screening in pseudogap Fermi systems, and discuss\neffects away from the dilute limit.\n", "  We construct a double field theory coupled to the fields present in\nVasiliev's equations. Employing the \"semi-covariant\" differential geometry, we\nspell a functional in which each term is completely covariant with respect to\n$\\mathbf{O}(4,4)$ T-duality, doubled diffeomorphisms, $\\mathbf{Spin}(1,3)$\nlocal Lorentz symmetry and, separately, $\\mathbf{HS}(4)$ higher spin gauge\nsymmetry. We identify a minimal set of BPS-like conditions whose solutions\nautomatically satisfy the full Euler-Lagrange equations. As such a solution, we\nderive a linear dilaton vacuum. With extra algebraic constraints further\nsupplemented, the BPS-like conditions reduce to the bosonic Vasiliev equations.\n", "  We derive an expression for the product of the Pfaffians of two\nskew-symmetric matrices A and B as a sum of products of the traces of powers of\nAB and an expression for the inverse matrix A$^{-1}$, or equivalently B$^{-1}$,\nas a finite-order polynomial of AB with coefficients depending on the traces of\npowers of AB.\n", "  Recent developments in fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures enable\nnew type of devices assembled by stacking atomically thin layers of\ntwo-dimensional materials. Using this approach, we fabricate light-emitting\ndevices based on a monolayer WSe$_2$, and also comprising boron nitride\ntunnelling barriers and graphene electrodes, and observe sharp luminescence\nspectra from individual defects in WSe$_2$ under both optical and electrical\nexcitation. This paves the way towards the realization of electrically-pumped\nquantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors. In addition we demonstrate\ntuning by more than 1 meV of the emission energy of the defect luminescence by\napplying a vertical electric field. This provides an estimate of the permanent\nelectric dipole created by the corresponding electron-hole pair. The\nlight-emitting devices investigated in our work can be assembled on a variety\nof substrates enabling a route to integration of electrically pumped single\nquantum emitters with existing technologies in nano-photonics and\noptoelectronics.\n", "  Caustic singularity formations in shift-symmetric $k$-essence and Horndeski\ntheories on a fixed Minkowski spacetime were recently argued. In $n$\ndimensions, this singularity is the $(n-2)$-dimensional plane in spacetime at\nwhich second derivatives of a field diverge and the field loses single-valued\ndescription for its evolution. This does not necessarily imply a pathological\nbehavior of the system but rather invalidates the effective description. The\neffective theory would thus have to be replaced by another to describe the\nevolution thereafter. In this paper, adopting the planar-symmetric\n$1$+$1$-dimensional approach employed in the original analysis, we seek all\n$k$-essence theories in which generic simple wave solutions are free from such\ncaustic singularities. Contrary to the previous claim, we find that not only\nthe standard canonical scalar but also the DBI scalar are free from caustics,\nas far as planar-symmetric simple wave solutions are concerned. Addition of\nshift-symmetric Horndeski terms does not change the conclusion.\n", "  Within the conventional theory of superconductivity superfluid carriers\nrespond to an applied magnetic field and acquire a speed according to their\neffective (band) mass. On the other hand it can be shown theoretically and is\nconfirmed experimentally that the mechanical momentum of the supercurrent\ncarriers is given by the product of the supercurrent speed and the $bare$\nelectron mass. By combining these two well-established facts we show that the\nconventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity applied to Bloch electrons\nis $internally$ $inconsistent$. Furthermore, we argue that BCS-London theory\nwith Bloch electrons does not describe the phase rigidity and macroscopic\nquantum behavior exhibited by superconductors. Experimentally the speed of the\nsupercurrent in superconductors has never been measured and has been argued to\nbe non-measurable, however we point out that it is in principle measurable by a\nCompton scattering experiment. We predict that such experiments will show that\nsuperfluid carriers respond to an applied magnetic field according to their\nbare mass, in other words, that they respond as $free$ $electrons$, undressed\nfrom the electron-ion interaction, rather than as Bloch electrons. This is\ninconsistent with the conventional theory of superconductivity and consistent\nwith the alternative theory of hole superconductivity. Furthermore we point out\nthat in principle Compton scattering experiments can also detect the presence\nof a spin current in the ground state of superconductors predicted by the\ntheory of hole superconductivity.\n", "  A new closed virial equation of state of hard-sphere fluids is proposed which\nreproduces the calculated or estimated values of the first sixteen virial\ncoefficients at the same time as giving very good accuracy when compared with\ncomputer simulation data for the compressibility factor over the entire fluid\nrange, and having a pole at the correct closest packing density.\n", "  In this work we studied the diffusive behavior of active brownian particles\nunder lateral parabolic confinement. The results showed that we go from\nsubdiffusion to ballistic motion as we vary the angular noise strength and\nconfinement intensity. We argued that the subdiffusion regimes appear as\nconsequence of the restricted space available for diffusion (achieved either\nthrough large confinement and/or large noise); we saw that when there are large\nconfinement and noise intensity, a similar configuration to single file\ndiffusion appears; on the other hand, normal and superdiffusive regimes may\noccur due to low noise (longer persistent motion), either through exploring a\nwider region around the potential minimum in the transverse direction (low\nconfinement), or by forming independent clusters (high confinement).\n", "  The exponent of anomalous diffusion of virus in cytoplasm of a living cell is\nexperimentally known to fluctuate depending on localized areas of the\ncytoplasm, indicating heterogeneity of diffusion. In a recent paper (Itto,\n2012), a maximum-entropy-principle approach has been developed in order to\npropose an Ansatz for the statistical distribution of such exponent\nfluctuations. Based on this approach, here the deviation of the statistical\ndistribution of the fluctuations from the proposed one is studied from the\nviewpoint of Einstein's theory of fluctuations (of the thermodynamic\nquantities). This may present a step toward understanding the statistical\nproperty of the deviation. It is shown in a certain class of small deviations\nthat the deviation obeys the multivariate Gaussian distribution.\n", "  New correlations between viscosity and surface tension are proposed and\nchecked for saturated normal fluids. The proposed correlations contain three or\nfour adjustable coefficients for every fluid. They were obtained by fitting 200\ndata points, ranging from the triple point to a point very near to the critical\none. Forty substances were considered, including simple fluids (such as rare\ngases), simple hydrocarbons, refrigerants, and some other substances such as\ncarbon dioxide and water. Two correlation models with three adjustable\ncoefficients were checked, and the results showed that the one based on the\nmodified Pelofsky expression gives the better overall results. A new\n4-coefficient correlation is then proposed which clearly improves the results,\ngiving the lowest overall deviations for 32 out of the 40 substances considered\nand absolute average deviations below 10% for all of them.\n", "  Several correlations between viscosity and surface tension for saturated\nnormal fluids have been proposed in the literature. Usually, they include three\nor four adjustable coefficients for every fluid and give generally good\nresults. In this paper we propose a new and improved four-coefficient\ncorrelation which was obtained by fitting data ranging from the triple point to\na point very near to the critical one. Fifty four substances were considered,\nincluding simple fluids (such as rare gases), simple hydrocarbons,\nrefrigerants, and some other substances such as carbon dioxide, water or\nethanol. The new correlation clearly improves the results obtained with those\npreviously available since it gives absolute average deviations below1% for 40\nsubstances and below 2.1% for 10 substances more.\n", "  We report on the recent progress in reducing differential equations for\nFeynman master integrals to canonical form with the help of a method proposed\nby Roman Lee. For the first time, we present Fuchsia --- our open-source\nimplementation of the Lee algorithm written in Python using mathematical\nroutines of a free computer algebra system SageMath. We demonstrate Fuchsia by\nreducing differential equations for NLO contributions to splitting functions in\nQCD, which contain both loops and legs integrals.\n", "  With the rapid progress of quantum information these recent years, it becomes\nmore and more relevant to dedicate efforts in introducing this research topic\nto undergraduate students. However, as if in various fields of physics the\ntheoretical learning is closely accompanied with experimental illustrations,\nsuch a teaching method can be expensive to organise for quantum information. We\npropose one way to circumvent these difficulties by using the recently made\navailable 5-qubit quantum processor of IBM, in order to illustrate quantum\ninformation tasks, by actually implementing them on the superconducting chip\nthrough the web interface of the IBM Quantum Experience. We focus on the\nrealization of a quantum teleportation protocol on this device, analyze the\nresults and discuss the issues encountered, providing a complete analysis of\nthis software as a pedagogical tool.\n", "  We computed the contribution of the Compton and Bremsstrahlung processes with\na hidden light $U(1)_D$ neutral boson $\\gamma_D$ to the white dwarf G117-B15A\nanomalous cooling rate, as well as the white dwarf luminosity functions (WDLF).\nWe demonstrated that for a light mass of hidden photon ($m_{\\gamma_D} \\ll$ a\nfew keV), compatible results are obtained for the recent Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey observation, but the stringent limits\nwould be imposed on the kinetic mixing $\\epsilon$. We performed $\\chi^2$-tests\nto acquire a quantitative assessment on the WDLF data in the context of our\nmodel, computed under the assumption of different kinetic mixing $\\epsilon$,\nthe age of the oldest computed stars $T_D$, and a constant star formation rate\n$\\psi$. Then taken together, the WDLF analysis of 2$\\sigma$ confidence interval\n$\\epsilon = \\left( 0.37^{+0.35}_{-0.37}\\right) \\times 10^{-14}$ is barely\nconsistent with the cooling rate analysis at 2$\\sigma$ regime $\\epsilon =\n\\left( 0.97^{+0.35}_{-0.37} \\right) \\times 10^{-14}$. The two approaches used\nhere agree with each other in yielding an anomalous cooling rate of white dwarf\nin this luminosity range.\n", "  The preceding BCA (Stamper-Kurn et. al., arXiv:1607.01454) asserts that our\nobservation of interference contrast in a half-metre-scale atom interferometer\n(Kovachy et. al., Nature 528, 530-3 (2015)) does not prove the existence of\nmacroscopic quantum superpositions and hence does not test quantum mechanics at\nlong length scales. Moreover, the BCA implies that intrinsic atomic\ninteractions or technical imperfections could prevent the application of our\nwork to future differential measurements. On the contrary, we argue the\nfollowing: i) in standard quantum mechanics, there is no known mechanism in our\nsystem that prohibits its use in future differential measurement applications;\nii) our experiment tests quantum mechanics in that it constrains any\nmodifications that would reduce contrast in an interferometer with arms that\npropagate over widely separated trajectories; and iii) using a standard\ndefinition of superposition, our observation of interference results from\nquantum superposition at the half-metre scale. In particular, quantum\nsuperposition is a more general concept than first-order coherence.\n", "  We propose a matrix model for two- and many-valued logic using families of\nobservables in Hilbert space, the eigenvalues give the truth values of logical\npropositions where the atomic input proposition cases are represented by the\nrespective eigenvectors. For binary logic using the truth values {0,1} logical\nobservables are pairwise commuting projectors. For the truth values {+1,-1} the\noperator system is formally equivalent to that of a composite spin 1/2 system,\nthe logical observables being isometries belonging to the Pauli group. Also in\nthis approach fuzzy logic arises naturally when considering non-eigenvectors.\nThe fuzzy membership function is obtained by the quantum mean value of the\nlogical projector observable and turns out to be a probability measure in\nagreement with recent quantum cognition models. The analogy of many-valued\nlogic with quantum angular momentum is then established. Logical observables\nfor three-value logic are formulated as functions of the Lz observable of the\norbital angular momentum l=1. The representative 3-valued 2-argument logical\nobservables for the Min and Max connectives are explicitly obtained.\n", "  Plasma accelerators can sustain very high acceleration gradients. They are\npromising candidates for future generations of particle accelerators for sev-\neral scientific, medical and technological applications. Current plasma based\nacceleration experiments operate in the relativistic regime, where the plasma\nresponse is strongly non-linear. We outline some of the key properties of wake-\nfield excitation in these regimes. We outline a multidimensional theory for the\nexcitation of plasma wakefields in connection with current experiments. We then\nuse these results and provide design guidelines for the choice of laser and\nplasma parameters ensuring a stable laser wakefield accelerator that maximizes\nthe quality of the accelerated electrons. We also mention some of the future\nchallenges associated with this technology.\n", "  This paper reviews recent advances in the study of strongly interacting\nsystems of dipolar molecules. Heteronuclear molecules feature large and tunable\nelectric dipole moments, which give rise to long-range and anisotropic\ndipole-dipole interactions. Ultracold samples of dipolar molecules with\nlong-range interactions offer a unique platform for quantum simulations and the\nstudy of correlated many-body physics. We provide an introduction to the\nphysics of dipolar quantum gases, both electric and magnetic, and summarize the\nmultipronged efforts to bring dipolar molecules into the quantum regime. We\ndiscuss in detail the recent experimental progress in realizing and studying\nstrongly interacting systems of polar molecules trapped in optical lattices,\nwith particular emphasis on the study of interacting spin systems and\nnon-equilibrium quantum magnetism. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion\nof the future prospects for studies of strongly interacting dipolar molecules.\n", "  We highlight differences in spectral types and intrinsic colors observed in\npre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars. Spectral types of pre-MS stars are\nwavelength-dependent, with near-infrared spectra being 3-5 spectral sub-classes\nlater than the spectral types determined from optical spectra. In addition, the\nintrinsic colors of young stars differ from that of main-sequence stars at a\ngiven spectral type. We caution observers to adopt optical spectral types over\nnear-infrared types, since Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram positions derived\nfrom optical spectral types provide consistency between dynamical masses and\ntheoretical evolutionary tracks. We also urge observers to deredden pre-MS\nstars with tabulations of intrinsic colors specifically constructed for young\nstars, since their unreddened colors differ from that of main sequence dwarfs.\nOtherwise, V-band extinctions as much as ~0.6 mag erroneously higher than the\ntrue extinction may result, which would introduce systematic errors in the H-R\ndiagram positions and thus bias the inferred ages.\n", "  Various statistical issues relevant to searches for new physics or to\nparameter determination in analyses of data in neutrino experiments are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a useful multidisciplinary\nanalytic technique. However, it is still a challenge to produce SERS substrates\nthat are highly sensitive, reproducible, stable, reusable, and scalable. Here,\nwe demonstrate that atomically thin boron nitride (BN) nanosheets have many\nunique and desirable properties to help solve this challenge. The synergic\neffect of the atomic thickness, high flexibility, stronger surface adsorption\ncapability, electrical insulation, impermeability, high thermal and chemical\nstability of BN nanosheets can increase the Raman sensitivity by up to two\norders, and in the meantime attain long-term stability and extraordinary\nreusability not achievable by other materials. These advances will greatly\nfacilitate the wider use of SERS in many fields.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic properties of the RN-AdS black hole in full phase\nspace and propose a generalized thermodynamic identity. As an example, we use\nit to find relations of thermodynamical coefficients between the grand\ncanonical and canonical ensembles. We also show, for the first order phase\ntransition, that the usual Maxwell's equal area law should be extended to a new\nform for the RN-AdS black hole.\n", "  At the nematic quantum critical point that exists in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave\nsuperconducting dome of cuprates, the massless nodal fermions interact strongly\nwith the quantum critical fluctuation of nematic order. We study this problem\nby means of renormalization group approach and show that, the fermion damping\nrate $\\left|\\mathrm{Im}\\Sigma^R(\\omega)\\right|$ vanishes more rapidly than the\nenergy $\\omega$ and the quasiparticle residue $Z_f\\rightarrow 0$ in the limit\n$\\omega \\rightarrow 0$. The nodal fermions thus constitute an unconventional\nnon-Fermi liquid that represents an even weaker violation of Fermi liquid\ntheory than a marginal Fermi liquid. We also investigate the interplay of\nquantum nematic critical fluctuation and gauge-potential-like disorder, and\nfind that the effective disorder strength flows to the strong coupling regime\nat low energies. Therefore, even an arbitrarily weak disorder can drive the\nsystem to become a disorder controlled diffusive state. Based on these\ntheoretical results, we are able to understand a number of interesting\nexperimental facts observed in curpate superconductors.\n", "  The magnetic easy axis orientation was studied by the third order perturbed\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian. Ferromagnetic CoPt/AlN multilayer thin films with\nnumber of layers N=11, 16 and 21 synthesized on fused quartz substrates using\ndc magnetron sputtering technique have been employed as experimental data.\nAccording to experimental research performed by some other researchers, easy\naxis of these fcc structured ferromagnetic films is oriented in the plane of\nthe film at one particular temperature. Average value of out of plane spin\ncomponent was plotted against temperature in order to determine the spin\nreorientation temperature. The spin reorientation temperature was highly\nsensitive to 2nd order magnetic anisotropy constant.\n", "  Sol-gel spin coating technique was employed to synthesize CuO thin films at\n1500 rpm, 2200 rpm and 2400 rpm for 30 seconds, and subsequently annealed at\n150-550{\\deg}C for 1 hour. Multi-layered CuO thin films with 3 and 5 layers\nwere prepared. These thin films were characterized using XRD, FTIR and\npolarizing light microscopy. The XRD and FTIR analysis confirmed the\ncrystallization of CuO phase in thin films annealed above 350 {\\deg}C, and\ncorresponding crystallite sizes were observed to be increasing with the\nannealing temperature. The Scherrer formula was applied for (111) and peaks of\nXRD patterns of CuO thin films. According to the data of peak, average\ncrystallite size increased from 0.801 to 55.2 0A as annealing temperature was\nincreased from 350 to 500 0C.\n", "  Second order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian was employed to study the\nvariation of energy of ferromagnetic thick films with demagnetization factor.\nUnder the influence of demagnetization factor given by =6.6, the sc(001) film\nwith 10000 layers can be easily oriented in 0.6 radians direction for the\nvalues of energy parameters used in this report. Easy direction of thick\nfcc(001) film with 10000 layers was determined at 0.66 radians, when the\ndemagnetization factor is given by =2.6. The energy of sc(001) thick film is\nlarger than that of fcc(001) thick film. But the energy curve of fcc(001) thick\nfilm is smoother than that of sc(001).\n", "  In this paper, we elaborately investigate the phonon transport, thermal\nexpansion and thermomechanics of monolayer Td-WTe2 by using first-principles.\n", "  The interaction of hot atoms with laser fields experiences a Doppler shift\nwhich can severely affect the precise spatial measurement of an atom. We\nsuggest an experimentally realizable scheme to address this issue in\nthree-dimension position measurement of a single atom in vapors of rubidium\natoms. Three-level lambda type atom-field configuration is considered where a\nmoving atom interacts with three orthogonal standing-wave laser fields and\nspatial information of the atom in 3D space is obtained via upper-level\npopulation using a weak probe laser field. The atom moves with a velocity along\nthe probe laser field and due to the Doppler broadening the precision in the\nspatial information deteriorates significantly. It is reported that via a\nmicrowave field the precision in the position measurement of the single atom\ncan be obtained in the hot rubidium atom overcoming the limitation posed by the\nDoppler shift.\n", "  This review briefly summarizes our knowledge of the X-ray emission from\nsingle WN, WC, and WO stars. These stars have relatively modest X-ray\nluminosities, typically not exceeding L_sun. The analysis of X-ray spectra\nusually reveals thermal plasma with temperatures reaching a few 10 MK. X-ray\nvariability is detected in some WN stars. At present we don't fully understand\nhow X-ray radiation in produced in WR stars, albeit there are some promising\nresearch avenues, such as the presence of CIRs in the winds of some stars. To\nfully understand WR stars we need to unravel mechanisms of X-ray production in\ntheir winds.\n", "  The transit timing variation technique (TTV) has been widely used to detect\nand characterize multiple planetary systems. Due to the observational biases\nimposed mainly by the photometric conditions and instrumentation and the high\nsignal-to-noise required to produce primary transit observations, ground-based\ndata acquired using small telescopes limit the technique to the follow-up of\nhot Jupiters. However, space-based missions such as Kepler and CoRoT have\nalready revealed that hot Jupiters are mainly found in single systems. Thus, it\nis natural to question ourselves if we are properly using the observing time at\nhand carrying out such follow-ups, or if the use of medium-to-low quality\ntransit light curves, combined with current standard techniques of data\nanalysis, could be playing a main role against exoplanetary search via TTVs.\nThe purpose of this work is to investigate to what extent ground-based\nobservations treated with current modelling techniques are reliable to detect\nand characterize additional planets in already known planetary systems. To meet\nthis goal, we simulated typical primary transit observations of a hot Jupiter\nmimicing an existing system, Qatar-1. To resemble ground-based observations we\nattempt to reproduce, by means of physically and empirically motivated\nrelationships, the effects caused by the Earth's atmosphere and the\ninstrumental setup on the synthetic light curves. Therefore, the synthetic data\npresent different photometric quality and transit coverage. In addition, we\nintroduced a perturbation in the mid-transit times of the hot Jupiter, caused\nby an Earth-sized planet in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. Analyzing the\nsynthetic light curves produced after certain epochs, we attempt to recover the\nsynthetically added TTV signal by means of usual primary transit fitting\ntechniques, and show how these can recover (or not) the TTV signal.\n", "  By means of a suitable rational approximation to the logarithmic derivative\nof the wavefunction we obtain tight upper and lower bounds to the eigenvalues\nand critical parameters of the quartic double-well potential.\n", "  The ability to directly record human face-to-face interactions increasingly\nenables the development of detailed data-driven models for the spread of\ndirectly transmitted infectious diseases at the scale of individuals. Complete\ncoverage of the contacts occurring in a population is however generally\nunattainable, due for instance to limited participation rates or experimental\nconstraints in spatial coverage. Here, we study the impact of spatially\nconstrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a\npopulation using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is\nquantified by the epidemic threshold of the\nsusceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of\ncommunicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility\nabove which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and\nempirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due\nto spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias\nis however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same\nfraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that\nare recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover,\nit depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading\ndynamics.\n", "  The effect of turbulence on the heterogeneous (solid-fluid) reactions of\nsolid particles is studied numerically with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS).\nA simplified reaction system is used, where the solid-fluid reaction is\nrepresented by a single isothermal reaction step. It is found that, due to the\nclustering of particles by the isotropic turbulence, the overall reaction rate\nis entirely controlled by the turbulence for large Damk\\\"ohler numbers. The\nparticle clustering significantly slows down the reaction rate for increasing\nDamk\\\"ohler numbers which reaches an asymptotic limit that can be analytically\nderived. This implies that the effect of turbulence on heterogeneously reacting\nparticles should be included in models that are used in CFD simulations of e.g.\nchar burnout in combustors or gasifiers. Such a model, based on the chemical\nand turbulent time scales, is here proposed for the heterogeneous reaction rate\nin the presence of turbulence.\n", "  The observational data of the near infrared bands (H and K) have been used\nfor the modeling mean light curves. Also the visual observational data have\nbeen fitted the same. The infrared and visual mean light curves were compared.\nAll parameters and Fourier-coefficients of the mean light curves were obtained.\nThe periodogram analysis of the variation of the brightness have been carried\nout.\n", "  One of the oft-cited qualities sought after in a potential future engineering\nemployee is an analytical mind that is \"continually examining things.\" In one\nsense this examination is discouraged in an instructional laboratory employing\nopaque black box data collection devices. Smartphones can be used to gather\nsuch data but also - by their very nature- have the capability of removing the\nveil of opacity so as to allow students to examine their operation at a very\nfundamental level. By taking advantage of a smartphone's visualization\ncapabilities one can elucidate core aspects of its operation equally or perhaps\nbetter than a mechanical model might. Through purposeful app and curricular\ndesign based on student feedback, we avoid this commonly perceived pitfall of\nelectronic devices and encourage student examination of one such device, the\nstudent's own smartphone.\n", "  We review how the Regge trajectory of an elastic resonance can be obtained\njust from its pole position and coupling, using a dispersive formalism. This\nallows us to deal correctly with the finite widths of resonances in Regge\ntrajectories. In this way we can calculate the Regge trajectories for the\n$K^*(892)$, $K_1(1400)$ and $K^*_0(1430)$, obtaining ordinary linear Regge\ntrajectories, expected for $q \\bar q$ resonances. In contrast, for the\n$K^*_0(800)$ meson, the resulting Regge trajectory is non-linear and with much\nsmaller slope, strongly supporting its non-ordinary nature.\n", "  We review our recent analysis of $\\pi K$ scattering data in terms of forward\ndispersion relations, and also present the parameters of the strange\nresonances. This work consists of fits to the data that are constrained to\nsatisfy analyticity requirements. The method yields a set of simple and\nconsistent parameterizations that are compatible with forward dispersion\nrelations up to 1.6 GeV while still describing the data. We also obtain the\npole parameters of the $K^*_0(800)$ and the $K^*(892)$ resonances.\n", "  The main chain dihedral angles play an important role to decide the protein\nconformation. The native states of a protein can be regard as an ensemble of a\nlot of similar conformations, in different conformations the main chain\ndihedral angles vary in a certain range. Each dihedral angle value can be\ndescribed as a distribution, but only using the distribution can't describe the\nreal conformation space. The reason is that the dihedral angle has correlation\nwith others, especially the neighbor dihedral angles in primary sequence. In\nour study we analysis extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories\nof eleven proteins with different sizes and folds, we found that in stable\nsecond structure the correlations only exist between the dihedrals near to each\nother in primary sequence, long range correlations are rare. But in unstable\nstructures (loop) long range correlations exist. Further we observed some\ncharacteristics of the short range correlations in different second structures\n({\\alpha}-helix, {\\beta}-sheet) and we found that we can approximate good high\norder dihedral angle distribution good only use three order distribution in\nstable second structure which illustrates that high order correlations (over\nthree order) is small in stable second structure.\n", "  The dynamics of small bodies around the Earth has gained a renewed interest,\nsince the awareness of the problems that space debris can cause in the nearby\nfuture. A relevant role in space debris is played by lunisolar secular\nresonances, which might contribute to an increase of the orbital elements,\ntypically of the eccentricity. We concentrate our attention on the lunisolar\nsecular resonance described by the relation $2\\dot{\\omega}+\\dot{\\Omega}=0$,\nwhere $\\omega$ and $\\Omega$ denote the argument of perigee and the longitude of\nthe ascending node of the space debris. We introduce three different models\nwith increasing complexity. We show that the growth in eccentricity, as\nobserved in space debris located in the MEO region at the inclination about\nequal to $56^\\circ$, can be explained as a natural effect of the secular\nresonance $2\\dot{\\omega}+\\dot{\\Omega}=0$, while the chaotic variations of the\norbital parameters are the result of interaction and overlapping of nearby\nresonances.\n", "  We introduce a parametric family of models to characterize the properties of\nastrophysical systems in a quasi-stationary evolution under the incidence\nevaporation. We start from an one-particle distribution\n$f_{\\gamma}\\left(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}|\\beta,\\varepsilon_{s}\\right)$ that\nconsiders an appropriate deformation of Maxwell-Boltzmann form with inverse\ntemperature $\\beta$, in particular, a power-law truncation at the scape energy\n$\\varepsilon_{s}$ with exponent $\\gamma>0$. This deformation is implemented\nusing a generalized $\\gamma$-exponential function obtained from the\n\\emph{fractional integration} of ordinary exponential. As shown in this work,\nthis proposal generalizes models of tidal stellar systems that predict\nparticles distributions with \\emph{isothermal cores and polytropic haloes},\ne.g.: Michie-King models. We perform the analysis of thermodynamic features of\nthese models and their associated distribution profiles. A nontrivial\nconsequence of this study is that profiles with isothermal cores and polytropic\nhaloes are only obtained for low energies whenever deformation parameter\n$\\gamma<\\gamma_{c}\\simeq 2.13$.\n", "  I describe a bi-connection formalism of General relativity based on the dual\nrole of the Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck connection defining the parallelism at a distance\nand the concomitant Levi-Civita connection derived from the Riemannian metric.\nA more explicit tensor writing of the geodesic and loxodromic equations\nclarifies their joint meaning.\n", "  The rotational spectra of thioisocyanic acid (HNCS), and its three energetic\nisomers (HSCN, HCNS, and HSNC) have been observed at high spectral resolution\nby a combination of chirped-pulse and Fabry-P\\'{e}rot Fourier-transform\nmicrowave spectroscopy between 6 and 40~GHz in a pulsed-jet discharge\nexpansion. Two isomers, thiofulminic acid (HCNS) and isothiofulminic acid\n(HSNC), calculated here to be 35-37~kcal/mol less stable than the ground state\nisomer HNCS, have been detected for the first time. Precise rotational,\ncentrifugal distortion, and nitrogen hyperfine coupling constants have been\ndetermined for the normal and rare isotopic species of both molecules; all are\nin good agreement with theoretical predictions obtained at the coupled cluster\nlevel of theory. On the basis of isotopic spectroscopy, precise molecular\nstructures have been derived for all four isomers by correcting experimental\nrotational constants for the effects of rotation-vibration calculated\ntheoretically. Formation and isomerization pathways have also been\ninvestigated; the high abundance of HSCN relative to ground state HNCS, and the\ndetection of strong lines of SH using CH$_3$CN and H$_2$S, suggest that HSCN is\npreferentially produced by the radical-radical reaction HS + CN. A radio\nastronomical search for HSCN and its isomers has been undertaken toward the\nhigh-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N) in the Galactic Center with the 100 m\nGreen Bank Telescope. While we find clear evidence for HSCN, only a tentative\ndetection of HNCS is proposed, and there is no indication of HCNS or HSNC at\nthe same rms noise level. HSCN, and tentatively HNCS, displays clear deviations\nfrom a single-excitation temperature model, suggesting weak masing may be\noccurring in some transitions in this source.\n", "  The harmonic oscillator is one of the most widely used model systems in\nphysics: an indispensable theoretical tool in a variety of fields. It is well\nknown that otherwise linear oscillators can attain novel and nonlinear features\nthrough interaction with another dynamical system. We investigate such an\ninteracting system: a superconducting LC-circuit dispersively coupled to a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). We find that the SQUID\nphase behaves as a classical two-level system, whose two states correspond to\none linear and one nonlinear regime for the LC-resonator. As a result, the\ncircuit's response to forcing can become multistable. The strength of the\nnonlinearity is tuned by the level of noise in the system, and increases with\ndecreasing noise. This tunable nonlinearity could potentially find application\nin the field of sensitive detection, whereas increased understanding of the\nclassical harmonic oscillator is relevant for studies of the\nquantum-to-classical crossover of Jaynes-Cummings systems.\n", "  While Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) has been tested\nextensively in our solar system, it is just beginning to be tested in the\nstrong gravitational fields that surround black holes. As a way to study the\nbehavior of gravity in these extreme environments I have used and added to a\nray-tracing code that simulates the X-ray emission from the accretion disks\nsurrounding black holes. In particular, the observational channels which can be\nsimulated include the thermal and reflected spectra, polarization, and\nreverberation signatures. These calculations can be performed assuming GR as\nwell as four alternative spacetimes. These results can be used to see if it is\npossible to determine if observations can test the No-Hair theorem of GR which\nstates that stationary, astrophysical black holes are only described by their\nmass and spin. Although it proves difficult to distinguish between theories of\ngravity it is possible to exclude a large portion of the possible deviations\nfrom GR using observations of rapidly spinning stellar mass black holes such as\nCygnus X-1. The ray-tracing simulations can furthermore be used to study the\ninner regions of black hole accretion flows. I examined the dependence of X-ray\nreverberation observations on the ionization of the disk photosphere. My\nresults show that X-ray reverberation and X-ray polarization provides a\npowerful tool to constrain the geometry of accretion disks which are too small\nto be imaged directly. The second part of my thesis describes the work on the\nballoon-borne X-Calibur hard X-ray polarimetry mission and on the space-borne\nPolSTAR polarimeter concept.\n", "  We use a symmetry-preserving regularization method of ultraviolet divergences\nin a vector-vector contact interac- tion model for low-energy QCD. The contact\ninteraction is a representation of nonperturbative kernels used Dyson-Schwinger\nand Bethe-Salpeter equations. The regularization method is based on a\nsubtraction scheme that avoids standard steps in the evaluation of divergent\nintegrals that invariably lead to symmetry violation. Aiming at the study of\nheavy-light mesons, we have implemented the method to the pseudoscalar pion and\nKaon mesons. We have solved the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the u, d and s\nquark propagators, and obtained the bound-state Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes in a\nway that the Ward-Green-Takahashi identities reflecting global symmetries of\nthe model are satisfied for arbitrary routing of the momenta running in loop\nintegrals.\n", "  The Rosetta probe around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) reveals an\nanisotropic dust distribution of the inner coma with jet-like structures. The\nphysical processes leading to jet formation are under debate, with most models\nfor cometary activity focusing on localised emission sources, such as cliffs or\nterraced regions. Here we suggest, by correlating high-resolution simulations\nof the dust environment around 67P with observations, that the anisotropy and\nthe background dust density of 67P originate from dust released across the\nentire sunlit surface of the nucleus rather than from few isolated sources. We\ntrace back trajectories from coma regions with high local dust density in space\nto the non-spherical nucleus and identify two mechanisms of jet formation:\nareas with local concavity in either two dimensions or only one. Pits and\ncraters are examples of the first case, the neck region of the bilobed nucleus\nof 67P for the latter one. The conjunction of multiple sources in addition to\ndust released from all other sunlit areas results in a high correlation\ncoefficient (~0.8) of the predictions with observations during a complete\ndiurnal rotation period of 67P.\n", "  On the configuration space of projections in a noncommutative algebra, and\nfor an automorphism of the algebra, we use a twisted Hochschild cocycle for an\naction functional, and a twisted cyclic cocycle for a topological term. The\nlatter is Hochschild-cohomologous to the former and positivity in twisted\nHochschild cohomology results into a lower bound for the action functional.\nWhile the equations for the critical points are rather complicate, the use of\nthe positivity and the bound by the topological term leads to self-duality\nequations (thus yielding twisted noncommutative sigma-model solitons, or\ninstantons). We present explicit non trivial solutions on the quantum\nprojective line.\n", "  Various paradoxes about the relativity theory have been developed since the\nbirth of this theory. Each paradox somewhat shows people's query about the\nrelativity theory, and solving of each paradox demonstrates the correctness of\nrelativity theory once again. In this paper, four paradoxes about the special\ntheory of relativity are brought forward: displacement paradox, electromagnetic\ntransformation paradox, Doppler paradox and magnetic force paradox. We hope\nsome researchers can reasonably explain these paradoxes, and then knowledge of\nthe relativity theory will become more abundant.\n", "  The splitting of the tangent bundle of space-time into temporal and spatial\nsub-bundles defines an almost-product structure. In particular, any space-time\nmetric can be locally expressed in time-orthogonal form, in such a way that\nwhether or not that almost-product structure is locally generated by a\ncoordinate chart is a matter of the integrability of the Pfaff equation that\nthe temporal 1-form of that expression for the metric defines. When one applies\nthat analysis to the known exact solutions to the Einstein field equations, one\nfinds that many of the common ones are completely-integrable, although some of\nthe physically-interesting ones are not.\n", "  Intense positron beams can be prepared via electro production with the\nreaction $e^{-} + e^{-} \\rightarrow e^{-}+e^{+}+e^{-}+e^{-}$ due to the\navailability of high current electron beams. Head on collisions inside of a\nmagnetic field of a solenoid are used to produce unpolarized/polarized\npositrons via $e^{-}-e^{+}$ - pair production. A flux of unpolarized positrons,\n$N_{positron}=6.55 \\cdot 10^{11} s^{-1}$, has been obtained as a result of\ncalculations for a special case of parameters with beam currents for both\nelectron beams of $I_{e}$=10 mA and beam momenta of $p_{beam 1}$=0.63 MeV/c and\n$p_{beam 2}$=10.0 MeV/c. Intensities are an order of magnitude smaller in the\ncase of polarized positrons due to a reduced current of one of the electron\nbeams. Suitable cuts on momenta of the positrons allow to achieve a\npolarization transfer from electrons to positrons of $\\geq $ 85\\% reducing,\nhowever, the intensity to 27\\%\n", "  It has been shown that the Gupta-Bleuler method of quantization can be used\nto impose the Lorentz gauge condition in static space-times but not in\ncosmological space-times. This implies that the Gupta-Bleuler approach fails in\ngeneral in non-static space-times. More recently, however, the Dirac method of\nquantizing constrained dynamical systems has been successfully employed to\nimpose the Lorentz gauge in conformally flat space-times. In this paper we\ngeneralize this result by using Dirac's method to impose the Lorentz gauge in a\ngeneral space-time region where the metric is expressed in synchronous\ncoordinates.\n", "  We construct a model containing a viable dark matter candidate, in the\nframework of left-right symmetry, which can explain both width and\ncross-section of the observed 750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC. We introduce\na fermion quintuplet whose neutral component can be a possible dark matter\ncandidate, whereas the charged components enhance the loop induced coupling of\na 750 GeV singlet scalar with a pair of photons. We study the photo-production\nof the singlet scalar and its various decay modes, successfully addressing both\nthe ATLAS and the CMS diphoton excess.\n"]}
