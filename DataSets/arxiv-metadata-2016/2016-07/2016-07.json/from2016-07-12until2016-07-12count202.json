We develop a micromagnetic theory to describe the field-driven\nreorientation in nanomagnets with cubic and uniaxial anisotropies. Spin\nconfigurations in competing phases and parameters of accompanying multidomain\nstates are calculated as functions of the applied field and the magnetic\nanisotropies. The constructed magnetic phase diagrams allow to classify\ndifferent types of the magnetization reversal and to provide detailed analysis\nof the switching processes in magnetic nanostructures. The calculated\nmagnetization profiles of isolated domain walls show that the equilibrium\nparameters of such walls are extremely sensitive to applied magnetic field and\nvalues of the competing anisotropies and can vary in a broad range. For\nnanolayers with perpendicular anisotropy the geometrical parameters of stripe\ndomains have been calculated as functions of a bias field. The results are\napplied to analyse the magnetization processes as observed in various\nnanosystems with competing anisotropies, mainly, in diluted magnetic\nsemiconductor films (Ga,Mn)As.\n", "  We report on a search for extremely-high energy neutrinos with energies\ngreater than $10^6$ GeV using the data taken with the IceCube detector at the\nSouth Pole. The data was collected between April 2008 and May 2009 with the\nhalf completed IceCube array. The absence of signal candidate events in the\nsample of 333.5 days of livetime significantly improves model independent limit\nfrom previous searches and allows to place a limit on the diffuse flux of\ncosmic neutrinos with an $E^{-2}$ spectrum in the energy range $2.0 \\times\n10^{6}$ $-$ $6.3 \\times 10^{9}$ GeV to a level of $E^2 \\phi \\leq 3.6 \\times\n10^{-8}$ ${\\rm GeV cm^{-2} sec^{-1}sr^{-1}}$.\n", "  Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are high performance co-processors\noriginally intended to improve the use and quality of computer graphics\napplications. Once, researchers and practitioners noticed the potential of\nusing GPU for general purposes, GPUs applications have been extended from\ngraphics applications to other fields. The main objective of this paper is to\nevaluate the impact of using GPU in solution of the transient diffusion type\nequation by parallel and stable group explicit finite difference method and\nencourage the researchers in this field to immigrate from implementing their\nalgorithms in CPU to the GPU emerging world. For comparing them, we implemented\nthe method in both GPU and CPU (multi-core) programming context. Moreover, we\nproposed an optimal synchronization arrangement for the implementation\npseudo-code. Also, the interrelation of GPU parallel programming and\ninitializing the algorithm variables were discussed, taking advantage of\nnumerical experiences. The GPU-approach results are faster than those obtained\nfrom a much expensive parallel 8-thread CPU-based programming. The GPU used in\nthis paper, is an ordinary old laptop GPU (GT 335M, launched at 2010) and is\naccessible for everyone and the newer generations of GPU (as discussed in\npaper) have even more performance priority over the similar-price GPUs. Then,\nthe results are expected to encourage the entire research society to take\nadvantage of GPUs and improve the time efficiency of their studies.\n", "  The first demonstration of narrowband spectral filtering of multimode light\non a 3D integrated photonic chip using photonic lanterns and waveguide Bragg\ngratings is reported. The photonic lanterns with multi-notch waveguide Bragg\ngratings were fabricated using the femtosecond direct-write technique in\nboro-aluminosilicate glass (Corning, Eagle 2000). Transmission dips of up to 5\ndB were measured in both photonic lanterns and reference single-mode waveguides\nwith 10.4-mm-long gratings. The result demonstrates efficient and symmetrical\nperformance of each of the gratings in the photonic lantern. Such devices will\nbe beneficial to space-division multiplexed communication systems as well as\nfor units for astronomical instrumentation for suppression of the atmospheric\ntelluric emission from OH lines.\n", "  In this presentation prepared for a general audience, we briefly mention the\nshortcomings of standard model of universe. We then focus on the late time\ninconsistency of the model dubbed age crisis whose resolution requires the\npresence of a repulsive effect that could be sourced either by dark energy or\nby a large scale modification of gravity. By and large, our description is\nbased upon Newtonian cosmology which is simple and elegant despite of its\nlimitations. On heuristic grounds, we explain how a tiny mass of graviton could\naccount for late time cosmic acceleration. We also include a brief discussion\non the underlying physics of Type Ia supernovae explosion and the direct\nconfirmation of late time acceleration of Universe by the related observations.\n", "  Objections to the use of inequalities to address foundational issues are\nconsidered and shown to be invalid. The Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality is\nconsidered and interpreted in this light. It is shown that, applied correctly,\nthe CH inequality can validly test aspects of locality. This paper establishes\na firm methodological ground for a following paper analyzing a recent CH\nexperiment.\n", "  We derive the filtering equation for Markovian systems undergoing homodyne\nmeasurement in the situation where the output processes being monitored are\nsqueezed. The filtering theory applies to case where the system is driven by\nFock noise (that, quantum input processes in a coherent state) and where the\noutput is mixed with a squeezed signal. It also applies to the case of a system\ndriven by squeezed noise, but here there is a physical restriction to\nemission/absorption coupling only. For the special case of a cavity mode where\nthe dynamics is linear, we are able to derive explicitly the filtered estimate\n$\\pi_t (a)$ for the mode annihilator $a$ based on the homodyne quadrature\nobservations up to time $t$.\n", "  We determine the optical response of a thin and dense layer of interacting\nquantum emitters. We show that in such a dense system, the Lorentz redshift and\nthe associated interaction broadening can be used to control the transmission\nand reflection spectra. In the presence of overlapping resonances, a\nDipole-Induced Electromagnetic Transparency (DIET) regime, similar to\nElectromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT), may be achieved. DIET relies on\ndestructive interference between the electromagnetic waves emitted by quantum\nemitters. Carefully tuning material parameters allows to achieve narrow\ntransmission windows in otherwise completely opaque media. We analyze in\ndetails this coherent and collective effect using a generalized Lorentz model\nand show how it can be controlled. Several potential applications of the\nphenomenon, such as slow light, are proposed.\n", "  The conditions allowing particle suspension in turbulent flow are of interest\nin many applications, but understanding them is complicated both by the nature\nof turbulence and by the interaction of flow with particles. Observations on\nsmall particles indicate an invariance of acceleration PDFs of small particles\nindependent of size. We show to be true the postulated role of particle/fluid\ninteraction forces in maintaining suspension. The 3D-PTV method, applied for\ntwo particle phases (tracers and inertial particles) simultaneously, was used\nto obtain velocity and acceleration data, and through the use of the particle's\nequation of motion the magnitude of forces representing either the flow or the\nparticle interaction were derived and compared. The invariance of PDFs is shown\nto extend to the component forces, and lift forces are shown to be significant.\n", "  Soft, disordered, micro-structured materials are ubiquitous in nature and\nindustry, and are different from ordinary fluids or solids, with unusual,\ninteresting static and flow properties. The transition from fluid to solid -at\nthe so-called jamming density- features a multitude of complex mechanisms, but\nthere is no unified theoretical framework that explains them all. In this\nstudy, a simple yet quantitative and predictive model is presented, which\nallows for a variable, changing jamming density, encompassing the memory of the\ndeformation history and explaining a multitude of phenomena at and around\njamming. The jamming density, now introduced as a new state-variable, changes\ndue to the deformation history and relates the system's macroscopic response to\nits microstructure. The packing efficiency can increase logarithmically slow\nunder gentle repeated (isotropic) compression, leading to an increase of the\njamming density. In contrast, shear deformations cause anisotropy, changing the\npacking efficiency exponentially fast with either dilatancy or compactancy. The\nmemory of the system near jamming can be explained by a microstatistical model\nthat involves a multiscale, fractal energy landscape and links the microscopic\nparticle picture to the macroscopic continuum description, providing a unified\nexplanation for the qualitatively different flow-behavior for different\ndeformation modes. To complement our work, a recipe to extract the\nhistory-dependent jamming density from experimentally accessible data is\nproposed, and alternative state-variables are compared. The proposed simple\nmacroscopic constitutive model is calibrated with the memory of microstructure.\nSuch approach can help understanding predicting and mitigating failure of\nstructures or geophysical hazards, and will bring forward industrial process\ndesign/optimization, and help solving scientific challenges in fundamental\nresearch.\n", "  We make use of the tools of quantum information theory to shed light on the\nUnruh effect. A modal qubit appears as if subjected to quantum noise that\ndegrades quantum information, as observed in the accelerated reference frame.\nThe Unruh effect experienced by a mode of a free Dirac field, as seen by a\nrelativistically accelerated observer, is treated as a noise channel, which we\nterm the Unruh channel. We characterize this channel by providing its\noperator-sum representation, and study various facets of quantum correlations,\nsuch as, Bell inequality violations, entanglement, teleportation and\nmeasurement-induced decoherence under the effect. We compare and contrast this\nchannel from conventional noise due to environmental decoherence. We show that\nthe Unruh effect produces an amplitude-damping-like channel, associated with\nzero temperature, even though the Unruh effect is associated with a non-zero\ntemperature. Asymptotically, the Bloch sphere subjected to the channel does not\nconverge to a point, as would be expected by fluctuation-dissipation arguments,\nbut contracts by a finite factor. We construct for the Unruh effect the inverse\nchannel, a non-completely-positive map, that formally reverses the effect, and\noffer some physical interpretation.\n", "  Most unconventional superconductors, including cuprates and iron-based\nsuperconductors, are derived from chemical doping or application of pressure on\ntheir collinearly magnetic-ordered parent compounds[1-5]. The recently\ndiscovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example of a\nnon-collinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore generated great\ninterest in understanding microscopic magnetic properties and their interplay\nwith superconductivity [6-8]. Unlike cuprates and iron based superconductors\nwhere the magnetic moment direction barely changes upon doping, here we show\nthat CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation from the ab plane to the ac plane,\nalong with an abrupt drop of the magnetic propagation vector at a critical\npressure (Pc~0.6 GPa). This magnetic phase transition coincides with the\nemergence of bulk superconductivity, indicating a direct connection between\nmagnetism and superconductivity. With further increasing pressure, the magnetic\norder completely disappears near the optimal Tc regime (P~0.94 GPa). Moreover,\nthe Cr magnetic moments between nearest neighbors tend to be aligned\nantiparallel with increasing pressure toward the optimal superconductivity\nregime. Our findings suggest that the non-collinear helimagnetic order is\nstrongly coupled to structural and electronic degrees of freedom, and that\nantiferromagnetic correlations associated with the low magnetic vector phase\nare crucial for superconductivity.\n", "  We consider the possibility that dark matter halos are described by the\nFermi-Dirac distribution at finite temperature. This is the case if dark matter\nis a self-gravitating quantum gas made of massive neutrinos at statistical\nequilibrium. This is also the case if dark matter can be treated as a\nself-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing Lynden-Bell's type of violent\nrelaxation. In order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out a\nrigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic King model. In this\npaper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical King model.\nThis model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. We propose\nto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are\nnegligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical\nstability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above\na critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system\nundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an\nisothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and\nvelocity dispersion. We compare the prediction of the classical King model to\nthe observations of large dark matter halos. Because of collisions and\nevaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo density\nprofile decreases until an instability takes place. We show that large dark\nmatter halos are relatively well-described by the King model at, or close to,\nthe point of marginal microcanonical stability. At that point, the King model\ngenerates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified Hubble\nprofile. This profile has a flat core and decreases as $r^{-3}$ at large\ndistances, like the observational Burkert profile. Less steep halos are\nunstable.\n", "  We discuss the nature of phase transitions in the fermionic King model which\ndescribes tidally truncated quantum self-gravitating systems. This distribution\nfunction takes into account the escape of high energy particles and has a\nfinite mass. On the other hand, the Pauli exclusion principle puts an upper\nbound on the phase space density of the system and stabilizes it against\ngravitational collapse. As a result, there exists a statistical equilibrium\nstate for any accessible values of energy and temperature. We plot the caloric\ncurves and investigate the nature of phase transitions as a function of the\ndegeneracy parameter in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We\nconsider stable and metastable states and emphasize the importance of the\nlatter for systems with long-range interactions. Phase transitions can take\nplace between a \"gaseous\" phase unaffected by quantum mechanics and a\n\"condensed\" phase dominated by quantum mechanics. The phase diagram exhibits\ntwo critical points, one in each ensemble, beyond which the phase transitions\ndisappear. There also exist a region of negative specific heats and a situation\nof ensemble inequivalence for sufficiently large systems. We apply the\nfermionic King model to the case of dark matter halos made of massive\nneutrinos. The gaseous phase describes large halos and the condensed phase\ndescribes dwarf halos. Partially degenerate configurations describe\nintermediate size halos. We argue that large dark matter halos cannot harbor a\nfermion ball because these nucleus-halo configurations are thermodynamically\nunstable (saddle points of entropy). Large dark matter halos may rather contain\na central black hole resulting from a dynamical instability of relativistic\norigin occurring during the gravothermal catastrophe.\n", "  We introduce a catalog of stellar properties for stars observed by the Kepler\nfollow-on mission, K2. We base the catalog on a cross-match between the K2\nCampaign target lists and the current working version of the NASA TESS target\ncatalog. The resulting K2-TESS Stellar Properties Catalog includes value-added\ninformation from the TESS Target Catalog, including stellar colors, proper\nmotions, effective temperatures, an estimated luminosity class (dwarf/subgiant\nversus giant) for each star based on reduced-proper-motion, and many other\nproperties via cross-matching to other all-sky catalogs. Also included is the\nGuest Observer program identification number(s) associated with each K2 target.\nThe K2-TESS Stellar Properties Catalog is available to the community as a\nfreely accessible data portal on the Filtergraph system at:\nhttp://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu/tess_k2campaigns .\n", "  We explore the possible cosmological consequence of the gravitational\ncoupling between the inflaton and axion-like fields. In view of the forthcoming\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and lensing data, we study the\nsensitivity of the CMB data on the cross-correlation between the curvature and\naxion isocurvature perturbations. Through a concrete example, we illustrate the\nexplicit dependence of the scale dependent cross-correlation power spectrum on\nthe axion parameters.\n", "  Because of their superfluid properties, some compact astrophysical objects\nsuch as neutron stars may contain a significant part of their matter in the\nform of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We consider a partially-relativistic\nmodel of self-gravitating BECs where the relation between the pressure and the\nrest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical BECs)\nbut pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy\ndensity and the rest-mass density. At high densities, we get a stiff equation\nof state similar to the one considered by Zel'dovich (1961) in the context of\nbaryon stars in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. We\ndetermine the maximum mass of general relativistic BEC stars described by this\nequation of state by using the formalism of Tooper (1965). This maximum mass is\nslightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by Chavanis and Harko (2012)\nusing a fully-relativistic model. We also consider the possibility that dark\nmatter is made of BECs and apply the partially-relativistic model of BECs to\ncosmology. In this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matter\nphase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase\n(equivalent to a cosmological constant). The same evolution is obtained in\nZel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmological\nsingularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. Interestingly, the\nFriedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a\nsimple generalization of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We point out, however, the\nlimitations of the partially-relativistic model for BECs and show the need for\na fully-relativistic one.\n", "  A framework of inflation is formulated based on symmetry groups and their\nassociated automorphic functions. In this setting the inflaton multiplet takes\nvalues in a curved target space constructed from a continuous group $G$ and a\ndiscrete subgroup $\\Gamma$. The dynamics of inflationary models is essentially\ndetermined by the choice of the pair $(G,\\Gamma)$ and a function $\\Phi$ on the\ngroup $G$ relative to $\\Gamma$. Automorphic inflation provides a natural\nstructure in which the shift symmetry of large field inflation arises as one of\ngenerators of $\\Gamma$. The model of $j-$inflation is discussed as an example\nof modular inflation associated to the special linear group.\n", "  Multiply periodic states appear in a wide variety of physical contexts, such\nas the Rayleigh-Benard convection, Faraday waves, liquid crystals, domain\npatterns in ferromagnetic films and skyrmion crystals recently observed in\nchiral magnets. Here we study a simple model of an anisotropic frustrated\nmagnet and show that its zero-temperature phase diagram contains numerous\nmulti-q states including the skyrmion crystal. We clarify the mechanism for\nstabilization of these states, discuss their multiferroic properties and\nformulate rules for finding new skyrmion materials. In addition to skyrmion\ncrystal, we find stable isolated skyrmions with topological charge 1 and 2.\nPhysics of isolated skyrmions in frustrated magnets is very rich. Their\nstatical and dynamical properties are strongly affected by the new zero mode -\nskyrmion helicity.\n", "  A detailed theory describing linear optics of vapors comprised of interacting\nmulti-level quantum emitters is proposed. It is shown both by direct\nintegration of Maxwell-Bloch equations and using a simple analytical model that\nat large densities narrow transparency windows appear in otherwise completely\nopaque spectra. The existence of such windows is attributed to overlapping\nresonances. This effect, first introduced for three-level systems in [R.\nPuthumpally-Joseph, M. Sukharev, O. Atabek and E. Charron, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 163603 (2014)], is due to strongly enhanced dipole-dipole interactions at\nhigh emitters' densities. The presented theory extends this effect to the case\nof multilevel systems. The theory is applied to the D1 transitions of\ninteracting Rb-85 atoms. It is shown that at high atomic densities, Rb-85 atoms\ncan behave as three-level emitters exhibiting all the properties of dipole\ninduced electromagnetic transparency. Applications including slow light and\nlaser pulse shaping are also proposed.\n", "  In this paper we consider random planar maps weighted by the self-dual\nFortuin--Kasteleyn model with parameter $q \\in (0,4)$. Using a bijection due to\nSheffield and a connection to planar Brownian motion in a cone we obtain\nrigorously the value of the critical exponent associated with the length of\ncluster interfaces, which is shown to be $$\n  \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\arccos \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{q}}}{2}\n\\right)=\\frac{\\kappa'}{8}. $$ where $\\kappa' $ is the SLE parameter associated\nwith this model. We also derive the exponent corresponding to the area enclosed\nby a loop which is shown to be 1 for all values of $q \\in (0,4)$. Applying the\nKPZ formula we find that this value is consistent with the dimension of SLE\ncurves and SLE duality.\n", "  There is growing evidence that when magnetic reconnection occurs in high\nLundquist number plasmas such as in the Solar Corona or the Earth's\nMagnetosphere it does so within a fragmented, rather than a smooth current\nlayer. Within the extent of these fragmented current regions the associated\nmagnetic flux transfer and energy release occurs simultaneously in many\ndifferent places. This investigation focusses on how best to quantify the rate\nat which reconnection occurs in such layers. An analytical theory is developed\nwhich describes the manner in which new connections form within fragmented\ncurrent layers in the absence of magnetic nulls. It is shown that the\ncollective rate at which new connections form can be characterized by two\nmeasures; a total rate which measures the true rate at which new connections\nare formed and a net rate which measures the net change of connection\nassociated with the largest value of the integral of $E_{\\|}$ through all of\nthe non-ideal regions. Two simple analytical models are presented which\ndemonstrate how each should be applied and what they quantify.\n", "  Preparing and detecting spatially extended quantum superpositions of a\nmassive object comprises an important fundamental test of quantum theory. These\nquantum states are extremely fragile and tend to quickly decay into incoherent\nmixtures due to the environmental decoherence. Experimental setups considered\nup to date address this threat in a conceptually straightforward way -- by\neliminating the environment, i.e. by isolating an object in a sufficiently high\nvacuum. We show that another option exists: decoherence is suppressed in the\npresence of a strongly interacting environment if this environment is\nsuperfluid. Indeed, as long as an object immersed in a pure superfluid at zero\ntemperature moves with a velocity below the critical one, it does not create,\nabsorb or scatter any excitations of the superfluid. Hence, in this idealized\nsituations the decoherence is absent. In reality the decoherence will be\npresent due to thermal excitations of the superfluid and impurities\ncontaminating the superfluid. We examine various decoherence channels in the\nsuperfluid $^4$He. It is shown that the total decoherence time can be as large\nas tens of seconds for a $10^6$ amu nanoparticle delocalized over $300$ nm in\nhelium at $1$ mK. Performing interference experiments in superfluid helium can\nprovide certain practical advantages compared to conventional schemes, e.g.\ncompensation of gravity by the buoyancy force and effective cooling.\n", "  In Dirac materials, the low energy excitations behave like ultra-relativistic\nmassless particles with linear energy dispersion. A particularly intriguing\nphenomenon arises with the intrinsic charge transport behavior at the Dirac\npoint where the charge density approaches zero. In graphene, a 2-D Dirac\nfermion system, it was predicted that charge transport near the Dirac point is\ncarried by evanescent modes, resulting in unconventional pseudo-diffusive\ncharge transport even in the absence of disorder. In the past decade,\nexperimental observation of this phenomenon remained challenging due to the\npresence of strong disorder in graphene devices which limits the accessibility\nof the low carrier density regime close enough to the Dirac point. Here we\nreport transport measurements on ballistic suspended graphene-Niobium Josephson\nweak links that demonstrate a transition from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive\nlike evanescent transport below a carrier density of $(10^{10}\ncm^{-2})$.Approaching the Dirac point, the sub-harmonic gap structures due to\nmultiple Andreev reflections display a strong Fermi energy-dependence and\nbecome increasingly pronounced, while the normalized excess current through the\nsuperconductor-graphene interface decreases sharply. Our observations are in\nqualitative agreement with the longstanding theoretical prediction for the\nemergence of evanescent transport mediated pseudo-diffusive transport in\ngraphene.\n", "  Motivated by the doubly special relativity theories and noncommutative\nspacetime structures, thermodynamical properties of the photon gas in a phase\nspace with compact spatial momentum space is studied. At the high temperature\nlimit, the upper bounds for the internal energy and entropy are obtained which\nare determined by the size of the compact spatial momentum space. The maximum\ninternal energy turns out to be of the order of the Planck energy and the\nentropy bound is then determined by the factor $\\big(V/l_{_{\\rm Pl}}^3\\big)$\nthrough the relevant identification of the size of the momentum space with\nPlanck scale. The entropy bound is very similar to the case of\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes and suggests that thermodynamics of\nblack holes may be deduced from a saturated state in the framework of a full\nquantum gravitational statistical mechanics.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate W states based on transitionles-based\nshortcuts technique in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. In light of\nquantum Zeno dynamics, we first effectively design a system whose effective\nHamiltonian is equivalent to the counter-diabatic driving Hamiltonian\nconstructed by transitionless quantum driving, then, realize the W states'\ngeneration within this framework. For the sake of clearness, we describe two\nstale schemes for W states' generation via traditional methods: the adiabatic\ndark-state evolution and the quantum Zeno dynamics. The comparison among these\nthree schemes shows the shortcut scheme is closely related to the other two but\nbetter than them. That is, numerical investigation demonstrates that the\nshortcut scheme is faster than the adiabatic one, and more robust against\noperational imperfection than the Zeno one. What is more, the present scheme is\nalso robust against decoherence caused by spontaneous emission and photon loss.\n", "  We have calculated the Casimir-Polder interaction (CPI) of a micro-particle\nwith a sheet on the basis of the Klimchitskaya-Mostepanenko theory. We find the\nresult that for non-trivial susceptibility values of the sheet and\nmicro-particle, there is crossover between attractive and repulsive behavior.\nThe transition depends only on the impedance, involving permeability and\npermittivity, apart from the ratio of the film thickness and the micro-particle\nseparation (D/d) and temperature. The approach to calculate CPI of a\nmicro-particle with a silicene sheet involves replacing the dielectric constant\nof the sample by the static dielectric function obtained using the expressions\nfor the polarization function. The silicene is described by the low-energy\nLiu-Yao-Feng-Ezawa (LYFE)Model Hamiltonian involving the Dirac matrices in the\nchiral representation obeying the Clifford algebra.We find that the collective\ncharge excitations at zero doping, i.e., intrinsic plasmons, in this system,\nare absent in the Dirac limit. The valley-spin-split intrinsic plasmons,\nhowever, come into being in the case of the massive Dirac particles with\ncharacteristic frequency close to 10 THz.Furthermore, there is a longitudinal\nelectric field induced topological insulator(TI) to spin-valley polarized metal\n(SVPM) transition in silicene, which is also referred to as the topological\nphase transition (TPT). The low-energy SVP carriers at TPT possess gap-less\n(mass-less) and gapped (massive) energy spectra close to the two nodal points\nin the Brillouin zone with maximum spin-polarization. We find that the\nmagnitude of the Casimir-Polder force at a given ratio of the film thickness\nand the separation between the micro-particle and the film is greater at TPT\nthan at the topological insulator and trivial insulator phases.\n", "  In a matter-filled spacetime, perhaps with positive cosmological constant, a\nstable marginally outer trapped 2-sphere must satisfy a certain area\ninequality. Namely, as discussed in the paper, its area must be bounded above\nby $4\\pi/c$, where $c > 0$ is a lower bound on a natural energy-momentum term.\nWe then consider the rigidity that results for stable, or weakly outermost,\nmarginally outer trapped 2-spheres that achieve this upper bound on the area.\nIn particular, we prove a splitting result for 3-dimensional initial data sets\nanalogous to a result of Bray, Brendle and Neves [10] concerning area\nminimizing 2-spheres in Riemannian 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature.\nWe further show that these initial data sets locally embed as spacelike\nhypersurfaces into the Nariai spacetime. Connections to the Vaidya spacetime\nand dynamical horizons are also discussed.\n", "  One of the most challenging hurdles to the construction of realistic\ncomposite Higgs models is the generation of Yukawa couplings for the Standard\nModel fermions. This problem can be successfully addressed in approximate\nconformal theories that admit a marginally relevant mixing between composite\nfermionic operators and the SM fermions. I argue that SU(3) gauge theories with\nlight Dirac flavors in the fundamental representation feature all the\ningredients under theoretical control, including a strongly-coupled IR fixed\npoint, composite partners for all Standard Model fermions, absence of Landau\npoles at low energy, and a realistic phenomenology. These models acquire the\nstatus of compelling UV-completions of the SM if some spin-1/2 baryon operator\nhas scaling dimension close to 2.5 within the conformal window, a possibility\nthat can only be assessed via non-perturbative methods like lattice QCD. A\ndistinctive collider signature is long-lived hadrons with fractional charges.\n  Vacuum alignment is controlled by the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the coset\nSU(4)xSU(4)/SU(4). With a technically natural choice of mixing for the\ntop-quark, the exotic scalars with electro-weak charges acquire large positive\nmasses and a compelling custodial-symmetric phenomenology is obtained. In the\ndecoupling limit the symmetry breaking pattern effectively reduces to\nSU(4)->Sp(4) with a light Higgs.\n", "  The formal derivation of Langevin equations (and, equivalently Fokker-Planck\nequations) with projection operator techniques of Mori, Zwanzig, Kawasaki and\nothers apparently not has widely found its way into textbooks. It has been\nreproduced dozens of times on the fly with many references to the literature\nand without adding much substantially new. Here we follow the tradition, but\nstrive to produce a self-contained text. Furthermore, we address questions that\nnaturally arise in the derivation. Among other things the meaning of the\ndivergence of the Poisson brackets is explained, and the role of nonlinear\ndamping coefficients is clarified. The derivation relies on classical\nmechanics, and encompasses everything one can construct from point particles\nand potentials: solids, liquids, liquid crystals, conductors, polymers, systems\nwith spin-like degrees of freedom ... Einstein relations and Onsager\nreciprocity relations come for free.\n", "  We report on an exact diagonalization study of fractional quantum Hall states\nat filling factor $\\nu=2/3$ in a system with a four-fold degenerate $n$=0\nLandau level and SU(4) symmetric Coulomb interactions. Our investigation\nreveals previously unidentified SU(3) and SU(4) singlet ground states which\nappear at flux quantum shift 2 when a spherical geometry is employed, and lie\noutside the established composite-fermion or multicomponent Halperin state\npatterns. We evaluate the two-particle correlation functions of these states,\nand discuss quantum phase transitions in graphene between singlet states with\ndifferent number of components as magnetic field strength is increased.\n", "  We study the bulk properties of isotropic bidisperse granular mixtures using\ndiscrete element simulations. The focus is on the influence of the size\n(radius) ratio of the two constituents and volume fraction on the mixture\nproperties. We show that the effective bulk modulus of a dense granular (base)\nassembly can be enhanced by up to 20% by substituting as little as 5% of its\nvolume with smaller sized particles. Particles of similar sizes barely affect\nthe macroscopic properties of the mixture. On the other extreme, when a huge\nnumber of fine particles are included, most of them lie in the voids of the\nbase material, acting as rattlers, leading to an overall weakening effect. In\nbetween the limits, an optimum size ratio that maximizes the bulk modulus of\nthe mixture is found. For loose systems, the bulk modulus decreases\nmonotonically with addition of fines regardless of the size ratio. Finally, we\nrelate the mixture properties to the 'typical' pore size in a disordered\nstructure as induced by the combined effect of operating volume fraction\n(consolidation) and size ratio.\n", "  We propose the existence of a hidden or dark sector besides the standard\nmodel (SM) of particle physics, whose members (both fermionic and bosonic) obey\na local SU(2)$_{\\rm H}$ gauge symmetry while behaving like a singlet under the\nSM gauge group. However, the fermiomic fields of the dark sector also possess\nanother global U(1)$_{\\rm H}$ symmetry which remains unbroken. The local\nSU(2)$_{\\rm H}$ invariance of the dark sector is broken spontaneously when a\nscalar field in this sector acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) and\nthereby generating masses to the dark gauge bosons and dark fermions charged\nunder the SU(2)$_{\\rm H}$. The lightest fermion in this dark SU(2)$_{\\rm H}$\nsector can be a potential dark matter candidate. We first examine the viability\nof the model and constrain the model parameter space by theoretical constraints\nsuch as vacuum stability and by the experimental constraints such as PLANCK\nlimit on relic density, LHC data, limits on spin independent scattering\ncross-section from dark matter direct search experiments etc. We then\ninvestigate the gamma rays from the pair annihilation of the proposed dark\nmatter candidate at the Galactic Centre region. We also extend our calculations\nof gamma rays flux for the case of dwarf galaxies and compare the signatures of\ngamma rays obtained from these astrophysical sites.\n", "  We report results of our low-temperature magneto electric transport\nmeasurements on micron-sized short cylinders of odd-parity, spin-triplet\nsuperconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with the cylinder axis along the $c$ axis. The\nin-plane magnetic field and measurement current dependent magnetoresistance\noscillations were found to feature an amplitude much larger than that expected\nfrom the conventional Little-Parks effect, suggesting that the\nmagnetoresistance oscillations originate from vortex crossing. The free-energy\nbarrier that controls the vortex crossing was modulated by the magnetic flux\nenclosed in the cylinder, the in-plane field, measurement current, and\nstructural factors. Distinct features on magnetoresistance peaks were found,\nwhich we argue to be related to the emergence of half-flux quantum states, but\nonly in samples for which the vortex crossing is confined at specific parts of\nthe sample.\n", "  In quantum theory, no-go theorems are important as they rule out the\nexistence of a particular physical model under consideration. For instance, the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) theorem serves as a no-go theorem for the\nnonexistence of local hidden variable models by presenting a full contradiction\nfor the multipartite GHZ states. However, the elegant GHZ argument for Bell's\nnonlocality does not go through for bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nstate. Recent study on quantum nonlocality has shown that the more precise\ndescription of EPR's original scenario is \"steering\", i.e., the nonexistence of\nlocal hidden state models. Here, we present a simple GHZ-like contradiction for\nany bipartite pure entangled state, thus proving a no-go theorem for the\nnonexistence of local hidden state models in the EPR paradox. This also\nindicates that the very simple steering paradox presented here is indeed the\nclosest form to the original spirit of the EPR paradox.\n", "  We extend the conjectured Kerr/CFT correspondence to the case of extremal\nKerr black holes immersed by an magnetic field, namely the extremal Melvin-Kerr\nblack holes. We compute the central charge which appears in the associated\nVirasoro algebra generated by a class of diffeomorphisms that satisfies a set\nof boundary conditions in the near horizon of an extremal Melvin-Kerr black\nhole. Our results support the Kerr/CFT conjecture, where the macroscopic\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy for an extremal Melvin-Kerr black hole matches the\nresult obtained from a dual 2D CFT microscopic computation using Cardy formula.\nInterestingly, the dual CFT description could be non-unitary, due to the\npossibility of negative central charge.\n", "  Axisymmetric solitonic states (chiral skyrmions) have been predicted\ntheoretically more than two decades ago. However, until recently they have been\nobserved in a form of skyrmionic condensates (hexagonal lattices and other\nmesophases). In this paper we report experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations of isolated chiral skyrmions discovered in PdFe/Ir(111) bilayers\ntwo years ago (Science 341 , 636 (2013)). The results of spin-polarized\nscanning tunneling microscopy analyzed within the continuum and discrete models\nprovide a consistent description of isolated skyrmions in thin layers. The\nexistence region of chiral skyrmions is restricted by strip-out instabilities\nat low fields and a collapse at high fields. We demonstrate that the same\nequations describe axisymmetric localized states in all condensed matter\nsystems with broken mirror symmetry, and thus our findings establish basic\nproperties of isolated skyrmions common for chiral liquid crystals, different\nclasses of noncentrosymmetric magnets, ferroelectrics, and multiferroics.\n", "  Oxide thin films exhibit versatile physical properties such as magnetism,\nferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, metal-insulator transition (MIT),\nmultiferroicity, colossal magnetoresistivity, switchable resistivity, etc. More\nimportantly, the exhibited multifunctionality could be tuned by various\nexternal fields, which has enabled demonstration of novel electronic devices.\nIn this article, recent studies of the multi-fields modulation of physical\nproperties in oxide thin films have been reviewed. Some of the key issues and\nprospects about this field are also addressed.\n", "  Motivated by the way Japanese tatami mats are placed on the floor, we\nconsider domino tilings with a constraint and estimate the number of such\ntilings of plane regions. We map the system onto a monomer-dimer model with a\nnovel local interaction on the dual lattice. We use a variant of the\nHamiltonian replica exchange Monte Carlo method and the multi-parameter\nreweighting technique to study the model. The properties of the quantity are\nstudied beyond exact enumeration and combinatorial method. The logarithm of the\nnumber of the tilings is linear in the boundary length of the region for all\nthe regions studied.\n", "  The production of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays was measured as\na function of transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) in minimum-bias p-Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC. The measurement covers\nthe $p_{\\rm T}$ interval $0.5<p_{\\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$ and the rapidity range\n$-1.06 < y_{\\rm cms} < 0.14$ in the centre-of-mass reference frame. The\ncontribution of electrons from background sources was subtracted using an\ninvariant mass approach. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ was\ncalculated by comparing the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential invariant cross section in\np-Pb collisions to a pp reference at the same centre-of-mass energy, which was\nobtained by interpolating measurements at $\\sqrt{s}= 2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}\n=7$ TeV. The $R_{\\rm pPb}$ is consistent with unity within uncertainties of\nabout 25%, which become larger for $p_{\\rm T}$ below 1 GeV/$c$. The measurement\nshows that heavy-flavour production is consistent with binary scaling, so that\na suppression in the high-$p_{\\rm T}$ yield in Pb-Pb collisions has to be\nattributed to effects induced by the hot medium produced in the final state.\nThe data in p-Pb collisions are described by recent model calculations that\ninclude cold nuclear matter effects.\n", "  A broad range of quantum optimisation problems can be phrased as the question\nwhether a specific system has a ground state at zero energy, i.e.\\ whether its\nHamiltonian is frustration free. Frustration-free Hamiltonians, in turn, play a\ncentral role for constructing and understanding new phases of matter in quantum\nmany-body physics. Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known\nto be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly\ndesirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at\nleast, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion - a\nsufficient condition - under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be\nfrustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory\nto the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a\nfully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the\nHamiltonian's interaction graph which, as a statistical mechanics problem, is\nof interest in its own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local\nHamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of\nspin glass physics which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT\ntransition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural\nconjectures for when such bounds will be tight, as well as to a novel notion of\nuniversality for these computer science problems. Besides providing concrete\nalgorithms leading to detailed and quantitative insights, this underscores the\npower of marrying classical statistical mechanics with quantum computation and\ncomplexity theory.\n", "  We present quantum algorithms to efficiently perform discriminant analysis\nfor dimensionality reduction and classification over an exponentially large\ninput data set. Compared with the best-known classical algorithms, the quantum\nalgorithms show an exponential speedup in both the number of training vectors\n$M$ and the feature space dimension $N$. We generalize the previous quantum\nalgorithm for solving systems of linear equations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502\n(2009)] to efficiently implement a Hermitian chain product of $k$\ntrace-normalized $N \\times N$ Hermitian positive-semidefinite matrices with\ntime complexity of $O(\\log (N))$. Using this result, we perform linear as well\nas nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction over $M$\nvectors, each in an $N$-dimensional feature space, in time $O(p \\text{polylog}\n(MN)/\\epsilon ^{3})$, where $\\epsilon $ denotes the tolerance error, and $p$ is\nthe number of principal projection directions desired. We also present a\nquantum discriminant analysis algorithm for data classification with time\ncomplexity $O(\\log (MN)/\\epsilon^{3})$.\n", "  During his whole scientific life Hermann Weyl was fascinated by the\ninterrelation of physical and mathematical theories. From the mid 1920s onward\nhe reflected also on the typical difference between the two epistemic fields\nand tried to identify it by comparing their respective automorphism structures.\nIn a talk given at the end of the 1940s (ETH, Hs 91a:31) he gave the most\ndetailed and coherent discussion of his thoughts on this topic. This paper\npresents his arguments in the talk and puts it in the context of the later\ndevelopment of gauge theories.\n", "  We develop coarse-graining tensor renormalization group algorithms to compute\nphysical properties of two-dimensional lattice models on finite periodic\nlattices. Two different coarse-graining strategies, one based on the tensor\nrenormalization group and the other based on the higher-order tensor\nrenormalization group, are introduced. In order to optimize the tensor-network\nmodel globally, a sweeping scheme is proposed to account for the\nrenormalization effect from the environment tensors under the framework of\nsecond renormalization group. We demonstrate the algorithms by the classical\nIsing model on the square lattice and the Kitaev model on the honeycomb\nlattice, and show that the finite-size algorithms achieve substantially more\naccurate results than the corresponding infinite-size ones.\n", "  The increase of resolution by the use of microspheres is related to the use\nof evanescent waves, satisfying complex Snell law where the trigonometric\nfunctions of the incident and refracted angles are complex trigonometric\nfunctions, related to the incident and refracted angles, while the refractive\nindices are real. The evanescent waves are obtained in addition to propagating\nwaves satisfying the ordinary Snell law. Measurements with high resolutions of\nphase objects like those of semi-transparent biological tissues, is described\nby an optical system composed of a combination of the microsphere with\ninterferometer.\n", "  We study spatio-temporal bursting in a three-scale reaction diffusion\nequation organized by the winged cusp singularity. For large time-scale\nseparation the model exhibits traveling bursts, whereas for large space-scale\nseparation the model exhibits standing bursts. Both behaviors exhibit a common\nsingular skeleton, whose geometry is fully determined by persistent bifurcation\ndiagrams of the winged cusp. The modulation of spatio-temporal bursting in such\na model naturally translates into paths in the universal unfolding of the\nwinged-cusp.\n", "  We re-examine the physical origin of the polymer glass transition from the\npoint of view of marginal rigidity, which is achieved above a certain number of\nintermolecular contacts. In the case of polymer chains in a melt / poor\nsolvent, each monomer has two neighbors bound by covalent bonds and also a\nnumber of central-force contacts modelled by the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential.\nWe find that when the average number of contacts per monomer (covalent and\nnon-covalent) exceeds the critical value z*=4, the system becomes solid and the\ndynamics arrested - a state that we declare the glass. Coarse-grained Brownian\ndynamics simulations show that at sufficient strength of LJ attraction (which\neffectively represents the depth of quenching, or the quality of solvent) the\npolymer globule indeed crosses the threshold of z*=4, and does become a glass.\nWe verify this by showing the distinction between the `liquid' polymer droplet\nat z<z*, which changes shape and adopts the spherical conformation in\nequilibrium, and the `glassy' droplet at z>z*, which retains its shape frozen\nat the moment of z* crossover. These results provide a robust working criterion\nto tell the liquid apart from the glass for the linear polymers.\n", "  We give a comprehensive study from flavor observables of pion, kaon, D_(s),\nand B_(s) mesons for limiting the Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs) with natural\nflavor conservation, namely, Z_2 symmetric and aligned type of models. With use\nof the updated studies and analyses of B -> tau nu, D -> mu nu, D_s -> tau nu,\nD_s -> mu nu, K -> mu nu, Pi -> mu nu, B^0_s -> mu^+ mu^-, B^0_d -> mu^+ mu^-,\ntau -> K nu, tau -> Pi nu, B -> X_s gamma, K-K bar mixing, B^0_d-B^0_d bar\nmixing, and B^0_s-B^0_s bar mixing, we obtain constraints on the parameters in\nthe 2HDMs. To calculate the constraints, we pay attention to a determination of\nCKM matrix elements and re-fit them to experimental data so that new\ncontributions from additional Higgs bosons do not affect the determination. In\naddition, we discuss excesses of observables in the muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment and the semi-tauonic B meson decays in the context of the 2HDM.\n", "  Frustrated quantum magnets can harbor unconventional spin liquid ground\nstates in which the elementary magnetic moments fractionalize into new emergent\ndegrees of freedom. While the fractionalization of quantum numbers is one of\nthe recurring themes in modern condensed matter physics, it often remains a\nchallenge to devise a controlled analytical framework tracking this phenomenon.\nA notable exception is the exactly solvable Kitaev model, in which spin degrees\nof freedom fractionalize into Majorana fermions and a Z2 gauge field. Here we\ndiscuss the physics of fractionalization in three-dimensional Kitaev models and\ndemonstrate that the itinerant Majorana fermions generically form a (semi)metal\nwhich, depending on the underlying lattice structure, exhibits Majorana Fermi\nsurfaces, nodal lines or topologically protected Weyl nodes. We show that the\nnature of these Majorana metals can be deduced from an elementary symmetry\nanalysis of the projective time-reversal and inversion symmetries for a given\nlattice. This allows us to comprehensively classify the gapless spin liquids of\nKitaev models for the most elementary tricoordinated lattices in three\ndimensions. We further expand this classification by addressing the effects of\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking and additional interactions.\n", "  Several distant icy worlds have atmospheres that are in vapor-pressure\nequilibrium with their surface volatiles, including Pluto, Triton, and,\nprobably, several large KBOs near perihelion. Studies of the volatile and\nthermal evolution of these have been limited by computational speed, especially\nfor models that treat surfaces that vary with both latitude and longitude. In\norder to expedite such work, I present a new numerical model for the seasonal\nbehavior of Pluto and Triton which (i) uses initial conditions that improve\nconvergence, (ii) uses an expedient method for handling the transition between\nglobal and non-global atmospheres, (iii) includes local conservation of energy\nand global conservation of mass to partition energy between heating,\nconduction, and sublimation or condensation, (iv) uses time-stepping algorithms\nthat ensure stability while allowing larger timesteps, and (v) can include\nlongitudinal variability. This model, called VT3D, has been used in Young\n(2012), Young (2013), Olkin et al. (2015), Young and McKinnon (2013), and\nFrench et al. (2015).\n", "  In this article we study the hydrostatic equilibrium configuration of neutron\nstars and strange stars, whose fluid pressure is computed from the equations of\nstate $p=\\omega\\rho^{5/3}$ and $p=0.28(\\rho-4{\\cal B})$, respectively, with\n$\\omega$ and ${\\cal B}$ being constants and $\\rho$ the energy density of the\nfluid. We start by deriving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the\n$f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, with $R$ and $T$ standing for the Ricci scalar and\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. Such an equation is a\ngeneralization of the one obtained from general relativity, and the latter can\nbe retrieved for a certain limit of the theory. For the $f(R,T)=R+2\\lambda T$\nfunctional form, with $\\lambda$ being a constant, we find that some physical\nproperties of the stars, such as pressure, energy density, mass and radius, are\naffected when $\\lambda$ is changed. We show that for a fixed central star\nenergy density, the mass of neutron and strange stars can increase with\n$\\lambda$. Concerning the star radius, it increases for neutron stars and it\ndecreases for strange stars with the increment of $\\lambda$. Thus, in $f(R,T)$\ntheory of gravity we can push the maximum mass above the observational limits.\nThis implies that the equation of state cannot be eliminated if the maximum\nmass within General Relativity lies below the limit given by observed pulsars.\n", "  We construct exact localised solutions of the PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation with an attractive cubic nonlinearity. The trapping potential has the\nform of two $\\delta$-function wells, where one well loses particles while the\nother one is fed with atoms at an equal rate. The parameters of the constructed\nsolutions are expressible in terms of the roots of a system of two\ntranscendental algebraic equations. We also furnish a simple analytical\ntreatment of the linear Schr\\\"odinger equation with the PT-symmetric\ndouble-$\\delta$ potential.\n", "  This note examines Gross-Pitaevskii equations with PT-symmetric potentials of\nthe Wadati type: $V=-W^2+iW_x$. We formulate a recipe for the construction of\nWadati potentials supporting exact localised solutions. The general procedure\nis exemplified by equations with attractive and repulsive cubic nonlinearity\nbearing a variety of bright and dark solitons.\n", "  We report on a numerical experiment performed to analyze fluctuations of the\nentropy production in turbulent thermal convection, a physical configuration\nthat represents here a prototypical case of an out-of-equilibrium dissipative\nsystem. We estimate the entropy production from instantaneous measurements of\nthe local temperature and velocity fields sampled along the trajectory of a\nlarge number of point-wise Lagrangian tracers. The entropy production is\ncharacterized by large fluctuations and becomes often negative. This represents\na sort of \"finite-time\" violation of the second principle of thermodynamics,\nsince the direction of the energy flux is opposite to that prescribed by the\nexternal gradient. We clearly show that the fluctuations of entropy production\nobserved in the present system verify the fluctuation relation (FR), even\nthough the system is time-irreversible.\n", "  We present a simple method for fast and cheap thermal analysis on supercooled\nglass-forming liquids. This \"Thermalization Calorimetry\" technique is based on\nmonitoring the temperature and its rate of change during heating or cooling of\na sample for which the thermal power input comes from heat conduction through\nan insulating material, i.e., is proportional to the temperature difference\nbetween sample and surroundings. The monitored signal reflects the sample's\nspecific heat and is sensitive to exo- and endothermic processes. The technique\nis useful for studying supercooled liquids and their crystallization, e.g., for\nlocating the glass transition and melting point(s), as well as for\ninvestigating the stability against crystallization and estimating the relative\nchange in specific heat between the solid and liquid phases at the glass\ntransition.\n", "  Self testing is a device-independent technique based on non-local\ncorrelations whose aim is to certify the effective uniqueness of the quantum\nstate and measurements needed to produce these correlations. It is known that\nthe maximal violation of some Bell inequalities suffices for this purpose.\nHowever, most of the existing self-testing protocols for two devices exploit\nthe well-known Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality or modifications of\nit, and always with two measurements per party. Here, we generalize the\nprevious results by demonstrating that one can construct self-testing protocols\nbased on the chained Bell inequalities, defined for two devices implementing an\narbitrary number of two-output measurements. On the one hand, this proves that\nthe quantum state and measurements leading to the maximal violation of the\nchained Bell inequality are unique. On the other hand, in the limit of a large\nnumber of measurements, our approach allows one to self-test the entire plane\nof measurements spanned by the Pauli matrices X and Z. Our results also imply\nthat the chained Bell inequalities can be used to certify two bits of perfect\nrandomness.\n", "  The estimations done confirm a feasibility of the idea that gold nanobars\n(GNBs) and nanorings (GNRs) irradiated by microwaves could become the terahertz\n(THz) emitters with photon energies within the full width at half maximum of\nlongitudinal acoustic phononic DOS of gold (~13.7-17.5 meV, i.e., 3.3-4.2 THz).\nA scheme of the THz radiation source is suggested based on the domestic\nmicrowave oven irradiating a substrate with multiple deposited GNBs or GNRs.\n", "  We study excitonic processes second order in the electric fields in\nnoncentrosymmetric crystals. We derive formulas for shift current and second\nharmonic generation produced by exciton creation, by using the Floquet\nformalism combined with the Keldysh Green's function method. It is shown that\n(i) the steady dc shift current flows by exciton creation without dissociation\ninto free carriers and (ii) second harmonic generation is enhanced at the\nexciton resonance. The obtained formulas clarify topological aspects of these\nsecond order excitonic processes which are described by Berry connections of\nthe relevant valence and conduction bands.\n", "  We provide a general framework to study differentiability of SRB measures for\none dimensional non-uniformly expanding maps. Our technique is based on\ninducing the non-uniformly expanding system to a uniformly expanding one, and\non showing how the linear response formula of the non-uniformly expanding\nsystem is inherited from the linear response formula of the induced one. We\napply this general technique to interval maps with a neutral fixed point\n(Pomeau-Manneville maps) to prove differentiability of the corresponding SRB\nmeasure. Our work covers systems that admit a finite SRB measure and it also\ncovers systems that admit an infinite SRB measure. In particular, we obtain a\nlinear response formula for both finite and infinite SRB measures. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that contains a linear response result\nfor infinite measure preserving systems.\n", "  Expanding the library of known inorganic materials with functional electronic\nor magnetic behavior is a longstanding goal in condensed matter physics and\nmaterials science. Recently, the transition metal chalchogenides including\nselenium and sulfur have been of interest because of their correlated-electron\nproperties, as seen in the iron based superconductors and the transition metal\ndichalcogenides. However, the chalcogenide chemical space is less explored than\nthat of oxides, and there is an open question of whether there may be new\nmaterials heretofore undiscovered. We perform a systematic combined theoretical\nand experimental search over ternary phase diagrams that are empty in the\nInorganic Crystal Structure Database containing cations, transition metals, and\none of selenium or sulfur. In these 27 ternary systems, we use a probabilistic\nmodel to reduce the likelihood of false negative predictions, which results in\na list of 24 candidate materials. We then conduct a variety of synthesis\nexperiments to check the candidate materials for stability. While the\nprediction method did obtain previously unknown compositions that are predicted\nstable within density functional theory, none of the candidate materials formed\nin our experiments. We come to the conclusion that these phase diagrams are\n\"empty\" in the case of bulk synthesis, but it remains a possibility that\nalternate synthesis routes may produce some of these phases.\n", "  We study the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a bilayer honeycomb\nlattice including interlayer frustration. Using a set of complementary\napproaches, namely Schwinger bosons, dimer series expansion, bond operators,\nand exact diagonalization, we map out the quantum phase diagram. Analyzing\nground state energies and elementary excitation spectra, we find four distinct\nphases, corresponding to three collinear magnetic long range ordered states,\nand one quantum disordered interlayer dimer phase. We detail, that the latter\nphase is adiabatically connected to an \"exact\" singlet product ground state of\nthe the bilayer which exists along a line of maximum interlayer frustration.\nThe order within the remaining three phases will be clarified.\n", "  Topological quantum phases cannot be characterized by Ginzburg-Landau type\norder parameters, and are instead described by non-local topological\ninvariants. Experimental platforms capable of realizing such exotic states now\ninclude \"synthetic\" many-body systems such as ultracold atoms or photons.\nUnique tools available in these systems enable a new characterization of\nstrongly correlated many-body states. Here we propose a general scheme for\ndetecting topological order using interferometric measurements of elementary\nexcitations. The key ingredient is the use of mobile impurities which bind to\nquasiparticles of a host many-body system. Specifically we show how fractional\ncharges can be probed in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall systems. We\ndemonstrate that combining Ramsey interference with Bloch oscillations can be\nused to measure Chern numbers of individual quasiparticles, which gives a\ndirect probe of their fractional charges. We discuss possible extensions of our\nmethod to other topological many-body systems, such as spin liquids.\n", "  In order to improve the short-term stability of trapped-ion optical clocks,\nwe are developing a frequency standard based on ${}^{115}$In${}^+$ /\n${}^{172}$Yb${}^+$ Coulomb crystals. For this purpose, we have developed\nscalable segmented Paul traps which allow a high level of control for multiple\nion ensembles. In this article, we detail on our recent results regarding the\nreduction of the leading sources of frequency uncertainty introduced by the ion\ntrap: 2nd-order Doppler shifts due to micromotion and the heating of secular\nmotion, as well as the black-body radiation shift due to warming of the trap.\nWe show that the fractional frequency uncertainty due to each of these effects\ncan be reduced to well below $10^{-19}$.\n", "  Interacting one-dimensional quantum systems play a pivotal role in physics.\nExact solutions can be obtained for the homogeneous case using the Bethe ansatz\nand bosonisation techniques. However, these approaches are not applicable when\nexternal confinement is present. Recent theoretical advances beyond the Bethe\nansatz and bosonisation allow us to predict the behaviour of one-dimensional\nconfined systems with strong short-range interactions, and new experiments with\ncold atomic Fermi gases have already confirmed these theories. Here we\ndemonstrate that a simple linear combination of the strongly interacting\nsolution with the well-known solution in the limit of vanishing interactions\nprovides a simple and accurate description of the system for all values of the\ninteraction strength. This indicates that one can indeed capture the physics of\nconfined one-dimensional systems by knowledge of the limits using wave\nfunctions that are much easier to handle than the output of typical numerical\napproaches. We demonstrate our scheme for experimentally relevant systems with\nup to six particles. Moreover, we show that our method works also in the case\nof mixed systems of particles with different masses. This is an important\nfeature because these systems are known to be non-integrable and thus not\nsolvable by the Bethe ansatz technique.\n", "  Automorphic inflation is an application of the framework of automorphic\nscalar field theory, based on the theory of automorphic forms and\nrepresentations. In this paper the general framework of automorphic and modular\ninflation is described in some detail, with emphasis on the resulting\nstratification of the space of scalar field theories in terms of the group\ntheoretic data associated to the shift symmetry, as well as the automorphic\ndata that specifies the potential. The class of theories based on Eisenstein\nseries provides a natural generalization of the model of $j$-inflation\nconsidered previously.\n", "  We consider next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) which has a\ngauge singlet superfield. In the scale invariant superpotential we do not have\nthe mass terms and the whole Lagrangian has an additional $Z_3$ symmetry. This\nmodel can have light scalar and/or pseudoscalar allowed by the recent data from\nLHC and the old data from LEP. We investigate the situation where a relatively\nlight charged Higgs can decay to such singlet-like pseudoscalar and a $W^\\pm$\nboson giving rise to final state containing $\\tau$ and/or $b$-jets and\nlepton(s). Such decay evades the recent bounds on charged Higgs from the LHC.\nAccording to our PYTHIA-FastJet based simulation such a scenario can be probed\nwith early data of 10 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC center of mass energy of 13 and 14\nTeV.\n", "  Graphene, a thinnest material in the world, can form moire structures on\ndifferent substrates, including graphite, h-BN, or metal surfaces. In such\nsystems the structure of graphene, i. e. its corrugation, as well as its\nelectronic and elastic properties are defined by the combination of the system\ngeometry and local interaction strength at the interface. The corrugation in\nsuch structures on metals is heavily extracted from diffraction or local probe\nmicroscopy experiments and can be obtained only via comparison with theoretical\ndata, which usually simulate the experimental findings. Here we show that\ngraphene corrugation on metals can be measured directly employing atomic force\nspectroscopy and obtained value coincides with state-of-the-art theoretical\nresults. We also address the elastic reaction of the formed graphene nanodoms\non the indentation process by the scanning tip that is important for the\nmodeling and fabrication of graphene-based nanoresonators on the nanoscale.\n", "  We show that recently suggested subwavelength lattices offer remarkable\nprospects for the observation of novel superfluids of fermionic polar\nmolecules. It becomes realistic to obtain a topological $p$-wave superfluid of\nmicrowave-dressed polar molecules in 2D lattices at temperatures of the order\nof tens of nanokelvins, which is promising for topologically protected quantum\ninformation processing. Another foreseen novel phase is an interlayer $p$-wave\nsuperfluid of polar molecules in a bilayer geometry.\n", "  We study the inclusive production of a Higgs boson in association with a\nhigh-$p_T$ photon at the LHC, detailing the leading-order features of the main\nprocesses contributing to the $H\\gamma$ final state. Requiring an extra hard\nphoton in Higgs production upsets the cross-section hierarchy for the dominant\nchannels. The $H\\gamma$ inclusive production comes mainly from photons radiated\nin vector-boson fusion (VBF), which accounts for about 2/3 of the total rate,\nfor $p_T^{\\gamma,j} >30$ GeV, at leading order. On the other hand, radiating a\nhigh-$p_T$ photon in the main top-loop Higgs channel implies an extra parton in\nthe final state, which suppresses the production rate by a further $\\alpha_S$\npower. As a result, the $H\\gamma$ production via top loops at the LHC has rates\ncomparable with the ones arising from either the $H t\\bar t$ production or the\n$HW(Z)\\gamma$ associated production. Then, in order of decreasing cross\nsection, comes the single-top-plus-Higgs channel, followed in turn by the\nheavy-flavor fusion processes $b\\bar b \\to H\\gamma$ and $c\\bar c \\to H\\gamma$.\nThe $H\\gamma$ production via electroweak loops has just a minor role. At larger\nc.m. energies, the $H t\\bar t\\gamma$ channel surpasses the total contribution\nof top-loop processes. In particular, requiring $p_T^{\\gamma,j} >30$ GeV at\n$\\sqrt S \\simeq 100$ TeV, $H t\\bar t\\gamma$ accounts for about $1/4$ of the\ninclusive $H\\gamma$ production at leading order, about half of the total being\ndue to VBF production.\n", "  We employ resurgent transseries as algebraic tools to investigate two\nself-consistent Dyson-Schwinger equations, one in Yukawa theory and one in\nquantum electrodynamics. After a brief but pedagogical review, we derive fixed\npoint equations for the associated anomalous dimensions and insert a moderately\ngeneric log-free transseries ansatz to study the possible strictures imposed.\nWhile proceeding in various stages, we develop an algebraic method to keep\ntrack of the transseries' coefficients. We explore what conditions must be\nviolated in order to stay clear of fixed point theorems to eschew a unique\nsolution, if so desired, as we explain. An interesting find is that the flow of\ndata between the different sectors of the transseries shows a pattern typical\nof resurgence, ie the phenomenon that the perturbative sector of the\ntransseries talks to the nonperturbative ones in a one-way fashion. However,\nour ansatz is not exotic enough as it leads to trivial solutions with vanishing\nnonperturbative sectors, even when logarithmic monomials are included. We see\nour result as a harbinger of what future work might reveal about the\ntransseries representations of observables in fully renormalised\nfour-dimensional quantum field theories and adduce a tentative yet to our mind\nweighty argument as to why one should not expect otherwise.\n  This paper is considerably self-contained. Readers with little prior\nknowledge are let in on the basic reasons why perturbative series in quantum\nfield theory eventually require an upgrade to transseries. Furthermore, in\norder to acquaint the reader with the language utilised extensively in this\nwork, we also provide a concise mathematical introduction to grid-based\ntranseries.\n", "  In this article, we construct the axialvector-diquark-axialvector-antidiquark\ntype tensor current to interpolate both the vector and axialvector tetraquark\nstates, then calculate the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to\ndimension-10 in the operator product expansion, and obtain the QCD sum rules\nfor both the vector and axialvector tetraquark states. The numerical results\nsupport assigning the $Z_c(4020/4025)$ to be the $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$\ndiquark-antidiquark type tetraquark state, and assigning the $Y(4660)$ to be\nthe $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ diquark-antidiquark type tetraquark state. Furthermore, we\ntake the $Y(4260)$ and $Y(4360)$ as the mixed charmonium-tetraquark states, and\nconstruct the two-quark-tetraquark type tensor currents to study the masses and\npole residues. The numerical results support assigning the $Y(4260)$ and\n$Y(4360)$ to be the mixed charmonium-tetraquark states.\n", "  We experimentally investigate a scheme for studying lattice transport\nphenomena, based on the controlled momentum-space dynamics of ultracold atomic\nmatter waves. In the effective tight-binding models that can be simulated, we\ndemonstrate that this technique allows for a local and time-dependent control\nover all system parameters, and additionally allows for single-site resolved\ndetection of atomic populations. We demonstrate full control over site-to-site\noff-diagonal tunneling elements (amplitude and phase) and diagonal\nsite-energies, through the observation of continuous-time quantum walks, Bloch\noscillations, and negative tunneling. These capabilities open up new prospects\nin the experimental study of disordered and topological systems.\n", "  F1F0 ATP synthase (ATPase) either facilitates the synthesis of ATP in the\nmitochondrial membranes and bacterial inner membranes in a process driven by\nthe proton moving force (pmf), or uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump\nprotons against the concentration gradient across the membrane. ATPase is\ncomposed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation\nand compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a\nself-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state\nBrownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the\ncoiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description\nof linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of\nthe $\\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.\nSubstituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent\nexperiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the\n`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close\nagreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,\nstop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to\nsynthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the\nmotor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical\nwork it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in\nthe number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven\noperation.\n", "  Data of physical contacts and face-to-face communications suggest temporally\nvarying networks as the media on which infections take place among humans and\nanimals. Epidemic processes on temporal networks are complicated by complexity\nof both network structure and temporal dimensions. Theoretical approaches are\nmuch needed for identifying key factors that affect dynamics of epidemics. In\nparticular, what factors make some temporal networks stronger media of\ninfection than other temporal networks is under debate. We develop a theory to\nunderstand the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model on arbitrary\ntemporal networks, where each contact is used for a finite duration. We show\nthat temporality of networks lessens the epidemic threshold such that\ninfections persist more easily in temporal networks than in their static\ncounterparts. We further show that the Lie commutator bracket of the adjacency\nmatrices at different times is a key determinant of the epidemic threshold in\ntemporal networks. The effect of temporality on the epidemic threshold, which\ndepends on a data set, is approximately predicted by the magnitude of a\ncommutator norm.\n", "  In this paper we study analytically a parameter switching (PS) algorithm\napplied to a class of systems of ODE, depending on a single real parameter. The\nalgorithm allows the numerical approximation of any solution of the underlying\nsystem by simple periodical switches of the control parameter. Near a general\napproach of the convergence of the PS algorithm, some dissipative properties\nare investigated and the dynamical behavior of solutions is investigated with\nthe Lyapunov function method. A numerical example is presented\n", "  The limited connectivity of current and next-generation quantum annealers\nmotivates the need for efficient graph-minor embedding methods. These methods\nallow non-native problems to be adapted to the target annealer's architecture.\nThe overhead of the widely used heuristic techniques is quickly proving to be a\nsignificant bottleneck for solving real-world applications. To alleviate this\ndifficulty, we propose a systematic and deterministic embedding method,\nexploiting the structures of both the input graph of the specific problem and\nthe quantum annealer. We focus on the specific case of the Cartesian product of\ntwo complete graphs, a regular structure that occurs in many problems. We\ndivide the embedding problem by first embedding one of the factors of the\nCartesian product in a repeatable pattern. The resulting simplified problem\nconsists of the placement and connecting together of these copies to reach a\nvalid solution. Aside from the obvious advantage of a systematic and\ndeterministic approach with respect to speed and efficiency, the embeddings\nproduced are easily scaled for larger processors and show desirable properties\nfor the number of qubits used and the chain length distribution. To conclude,\nwe briefly address the problem of circumventing inoperable qubits by presenting\npossible extensions of the method.\n", "  We employ the quantum jump trajectory approach to construct a systematic\nframework to study the thermodynamics at the trajectory level in a\nnonequilibrium open quantum system under discrete feedback control. Within this\nframework, we derive quantum versions of the generalized Jarzynski equalities,\nwhich are demonstrated in an isolated pseudospin system and a coherently driven\ntwo-level open quantum system. Due to quantum coherence and measurement\nbackaction, a fundamental distinction from the classical generalized Jarzynski\nequalities emerges in the quantum versions, which is characterized by a large\nnegative information gain reflecting genuinely quantum rare events. A possible\nexperimental scheme to test our findings in superconducting qubits is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum\ncomputing. In these systems, the dynamically corrected gates offer considerable\nreduction of gate errors and are therefore of great interest both theoretically\nand experimentally. They are, however, designed under the static-noise model\nand may be considered as low-frequency filters. In this work, we perform a\ncomprehensive theoretical study of the response of a type of dynamically\ncorrected gates, namely the {\\sc supcode} for singlet-triplet qubits, to\nrealistic $1/f$ noises with frequency spectra $1/\\omega^\\alpha$. Through\nrandomized benchmarking, we have found that {\\sc supcode} offers improvement of\nthe gate fidelity for $\\alpha\\gtrsim1$ and the improvement becomes\nexponentially more pronounced with the increase of the noise exponent in the\nrange $1\\lesssim\\alpha\\leq3$ studied. On the other hand, for small $\\alpha$,\n{\\sc supcode} will not offer any improvement. The $\\delta J$-{\\sc supcode},\nspecifically designed for systems where the nuclear noise is absent, is found\nto offer additional error reduction than the full {\\sc supcode} for charge\nnoises. The computed filter transfer functions of the {\\sc supcode} gates are\nalso presented.\n", "  Gold atomic point contacts are prototype systems to evidence ballistic\nelectron transport. The typical dimension of the nanojunction being smaller\nthan the electron-phonon interaction length, even at room temperature,\nelectrons transfer their excess energy to the lattice only far from the\ncontact. At the contact however, favored by huge current densities,\nelectron-electron interactions result in a nano hot electron gas acting as a\nsource of photons. Using a home built Mechanically Controlled Break Junction,\nit is reported here, for the first time, that this hot electron gas also\nradiates in the infrared range (0.2eV to 1.2eV). Moreover, in agreement with\nthe pioneering work of Tomchuk, we show that this radiation is compatible with\na blackbody like spectrum emitted from an electron gas at temperatures of\nseveral thousands of Kelvin given by $(kB.Te)^2 = \\alpha. I.V$ where $\\alpha$,\n$I$ and $V$ are respectively a fitting parameter, the current flowing and the\napplied bias.\n", "  We calculate the fully-differential rate of the decays $B\\to P\\tau(\\to\n\\mu\\bar\\nu\\nu)\\bar\\nu$ where $P = D,\\pi$, which is a background to the\nsemimuonic decays $B\\to P\\mu\\bar\\nu$. The decays with a $3\\nu$ final state can\nhave a sizeable impact on the experimental analyses of the ratios $R_D$ and\n$R_\\pi$, depending on the event selection in the analysis. We outline a\nstrategy which permits the extraction of $R_P \\mathcal{B}(\\tau \\to\n\\mu\\bar\\nu\\nu)$ from the neutrino-inclusive rate. Our analytic results can also\nbe used to test both existing and upcoming experimental analyses. We further\nprovide Monte Carlo samples of the 5D rate of the neutrino-inclusive decays\n$B\\to P\\mu X_{\\bar\\nu}$.\n", "  The layered transition metal dichalcogenide vanadium disulfide (VS$_2$),\nwhich nominally has one electron in the $3d$ shell, is potent for strong\ncorrelation physics and is possibly another realization of an effective\none-band model beyond the cuprates. Here monolayer VS$_2$ in both the trigonal\nprismatic and octahedral phases is investigated using density functional theory\nplus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) calculations. Trigonal prismatic VS$_2$ has an\nisolated low-energy band that emerges from a confluence of crystal field\nsplitting and direct V--V hopping. Within spin density functional theory,\nferromagnetism splits the isolated band of the trigonal prismatic structure,\nleading to a low-band-gap $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic Stoner insulator; the\noctahedral phase is higher in energy. Including the on-site interaction $U$\nincreases the band gap, leads to Mott insulating behavior, and for sufficiently\nhigh values stabilizes the ferromagnetic octahedral phase. The validity of DFT\nand DFT+$U$ for these two-dimensional materials with potential for strong\nelectronic correlations is discussed. A clear benchmark is given by examining\nthe experimentally observed charge density wave (CDW) in octahedral VS$_2$, for\nwhich DFT grossly overestimates the bond length differences compared to known\nexperiments; the presence of CDWs is also probed for the trigonal prismatic\nphase. Finally, we investigate why only the octahedral phase has been observed\nin experiments and discuss the possibility of realizing the trigonal prismatic\nphase. Our work suggests trigonal prismatic VS$_2$ is a promising candidate for\nstrongly correlated electron physics that, if realized, could be experimentally\nprobed in an unprecedented fashion due to its monolayer nature.\n", "  The measurement of gamma rays from cosmic sources at MeV energies is one of\nthe key tools for nuclear astrophysics, in its study of nuclear reactions and\ntheir impacts on objects and phenomena throughout the universe. Gamma rays\ntrace nuclear processes most directly, as they originate from nuclear\ntransitions following radioactive decays or high-energy collisions with\nexcitation of nuclei. Additionally, the unique gamma-ray signature from the\nannihilation of positrons falls into this astronomical window and is discussed\nhere: Cosmic positrons are often produced from beta-decays, thus also of\nnuclear physics origins. The nuclear reactions leading to radioactive isotopes\noccur inside stars and stellar explosions, which therefore constitute the main\nobjects of such studies. In recent years, both thermonuclear and core-collapse\nsupernova radioactivities have been measured, and complement conventional\nsupernova observations with measurements of their prime energy sources. The\ndiffuse radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in gamma rays is\nnow being analysed towards how massive stars feed back their energy and ejecta\ninto interstellar gas. Large interstellar cavities and superbubbles have been\nrecognised to be the dominating structures where new massive-star ejecta are\ninjected, from 26Al gamma-ray spectroscopy. Finally, the puzzling\nbulge-dominated intensity distribution of positron annihilation gamma rays is\nmeasured in greater detail, but still not understood; a recent microquasar\nflare provided evidence that such objects may be prime sources for positrons in\ninterstellar space, rather than distributed nucleosynthesis. We also briefly\ndiscuss the status and prospects for astronomy with telescopes for the\nnuclear-radiation energy window.\n", "  The literature on the costs of climate change often draws a link between\nclimatic 'tipping points' and large economic shocks, frequently called\n'catastrophes'. The use of the phrase 'tipping points' in this context can be\nmisleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, 'tipping points'\ninvolve abrupt state changes. For some climatic 'tipping points,' the\ncommitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be\nrate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the\nconnection between climatic 'tipping points' and economic losses is tenuous,\nthough emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for\ninvestigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between\n'tipping points' in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by\nclimatic and social 'tipping elements,' and 'economic shocks'. The last may be\nassociated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or non-climatic\ntriggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature\non climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements,\nand climate-economic shocks, and we propose a research agenda to advance the\nintegrated assessment of all three.\n", "  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has discovered a diffuse all-flavor flux of\nhigh-energy astrophysical neutrinos. However, the corresponding astrophysical\nsources have not yet been identified. Neither significant point sources nor\nsignificant angular correlations of event directions have been observed by\nIceCube or other instruments to date. We present a new method to interpret the\nnon-observation of angular correlations in terms of exclusions on the strength\nand number of point-like sources in generic astrophysical scenarios.\nAdditionally, we constrain the presence of these sources taking into account\nthe measurement of the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux by IceCube. We apply\nthe method to two types of astrophysically motivated source count\ndistributions: The first type is obtained by considering the cosmological\nevolution of the co-moving density of active galaxies, while the second type is\ndirectly derived from the gamma ray source count distribution observed by\nFermi-LAT. As a result, we constrain the possible parameter space for both\ntypes of source count distributions.\n", "  We investigate maximum efficiency at a given power for low-dissipation heat\nengines. Close to maximum power, the maximum gain in efficiency scales as a\nsquare root of relative loss in power and this scaling is universal for a broad\nclass of systems. For the low-dissipation engines, we calculate the maximum\ngain in efficiency for an arbitrary fixed power. We show that the engines\nworking close to maximum power can operate at considerably larger efficiency\ncompared to the efficiency at maximum power. Furthermore, we introduce\nuniversal bounds on maximum efficiency at a given power for low-dissipation\nheat engines. These bounds represent direct generalization of the bounds on\nefficiency at maximum power obtained by Esposito et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 105,\n150603 (2010). We derive the bounds analytically in the regime close to maximum\npower and for small power values. For the intermediate regime we present strong\nnumerical evidence for the validity of the bounds.\n", "  The Schwinger-boson theory of the frustrated square lattice antiferromagnet\nyields a stable, gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ground state with\ntime-reversal symmetry, incommensurate spin correlations and long-range\nIsing-nematic order. We obtain an equivalent description of this state using\nfermionic spinons (the fermionic spinons can be considered to be bound states\nof the bosonic spinons and the visons). Upon doping, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin\nliquid can lead to a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) with small Fermi pockets\nof electron-like quasiparticles, while preserving the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ntopological and Ising-nematic orders. We describe a Higgs transition out of\nthis deconfined metallic state into a confining superconducting state which is\nusually of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type, with spatial modulation\nof the superconducting order.\n", "  Understanding how the brain functions is one of the biggest challenges of our\ntime. The analysis of experimentally recorded neural firing patterns (spike\ntrains) plays a crucial role in addressing this problem. Here, the PySpike\nlibrary is introduced, a Python package for spike train analysis providing\nparameter-free and time-scale independent measures of spike train synchrony. It\nallows to compute similarity and dissimilarity profiles, averaged values and\ndistance matrices. Although mainly focusing on neuroscience, PySpike can also\nbe applied in other contexts like climate research or social sciences. The\npackage is available as Open Source on Github and PyPI.\n", "  This review summarizes experimental works performed over the last decade by\nseveral groups on the manipulation of a few individual interacting Rydberg\natoms. These studies establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as a promising\nplatform for quantum state engineering, with potential applications to quantum\nmetrology, quantum simulation and quantum information.\n", "  We investigate the temporal evolution of electronic states in strontium\niridate Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. The time resolved photoemission spectra of intrinsic,\nelectron doped and the hole doped samples are monitored in identical\nexperimental conditions. Our data on intrinsic and electron doped samples, show\nthat primary doublon-holon pairs relax near to the chemical potential on a\ntimescale shorter than $70$ fs. The subsequent cooling of low energy\nexcitations takes place in two step: a rapid dynamics of $\\cong120$ fs is\nfollowed by a slower decay of $\\cong 1$ ps. The reported timescales endorse the\nanalogies between Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and copper oxides.\n", "  We investigate magnetic resonances driven in thermal vapour of alkali atoms\nby laser radiation broadly modulated at a frequency resonant with the Zeeman\nsplitting. A model accounting for both hyperfine and Zeeman pumping is\ndeveloped and its results are compared with experimental measurements performed\nat relatively weak pump irradiance. The interplay between the two pumping\nprocesses generates intriguing interaction conditions, often overlooked by\nsimplified models.\n", "  We evaluate the grand potential of a cluster of two molecular species,\nequivalent to its free energy of formation from a binary vapour phase, using a\nnonequilibrium molecular dynamics technique where guide particles, each\ntethered to a molecule by a harmonic force, move apart to disassemble a cluster\ninto its components. The mechanical work performed in an ensemble of\ntrajectories is analysed using the Jarzynski equality to obtain a free energy\nof disassembly, a contribution to the cluster grand potential. We study\nclusters of sulphuric acid and water at 300 K, using a classical interaction\nscheme, and contrast two modes of guided disassembly. In one, the cluster is\nbroken apart through simple pulling by the guide particles, but we find the\ntrajectories tend to be mechanically irreversible. In the second approach, the\nguide motion and strength of tethering are modified in a way that prises the\ncluster apart, a procedure that seems more reversible. We construct a surface\nrepresenting the cluster grand potential, and identify a critical cluster for\ndroplet nucleation under given vapour conditions. We compare the equilibrium\npopulations of clusters with calculations reported by Henschel et al. [J. Phys.\nChem. A 118, 2599 (2014)] based on optimised quantum chemical structures.\n", "  Free-standing thin films of magnetic ion intercalated transition metal\ndichalcogenides are produced using ultramicrotoming techniques. Films of\nthicknesses ranging from 30nm to 250nm were achieved and characterized using\ntransmission electron diffraction and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism.\nDiffraction measurements visualize the long range crystallographic ordering of\nthe intercalated ions, while the dichroism measurements directly assess the\norbital contributions to the total magnetic moment. We thus verify the\nunquenched orbital moment in Fe0.25TaS2 and measure the fully quenched orbital\ncontribution in Mn0.25TaS2. Such films can be used in a wide variety of\nultrafast X-ray and electron techniques that benefit from transmission\ngeometries, and allow measurements of ultrafast structural, electronic, and\nmagnetization dynamics in space and time.\n", "  The method of many body Green's functions is used to derive algebraic\nexpressions for the different elastic and thermodynamical quantities such as\nthe free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, elastic constants\n(adiabatic and isothermal) and the coefficient of thermal expansion. The\nperturbation expansion is developed up to third-order and diagrams\ncorresponding to the equations are represented. The present results extend the\nexisting ones by giving expressions for the elastic constants of arbitrary\norder and terms which are higher-order in the interatomic force constants that\nhave been obtained earlier. The perturbation expansion in terms of arbitrary\nmacroscopical parameters is considered and the similarity of expansions with\nrespect to different parameters is emphasized. A physical interpretation of the\nharmonic phonon eigenvectors is considered. To the author's knowledge, no such\nsimilar interpretation of the harmonic phonon eigenvectors has been given in\nthe literature before.\n", "  We investigate the formation of a new type of composite topological\nexcitation -- the skyrmion-vortex pair (SVP) -- in hybrid systems consisting of\ncoupled ferromagnetic and superconducting layers. Spin-orbit interaction in the\nsuperconductor mediates a magnetoelectric coupling between the vortex and the\nskyrmion, with a sign (attractive or repulsive) that depends on the topological\nindices of the constituents. We determine the conditions under which a bound\nSVP is formed, and characterize the range and depth of the effective binding\npotential through analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Furthermore,\nwe develop a semiclassical description of the coupled skyrmion-vortex dynamics\nand discuss how SVPs can be controlled by applied spin currents.\n", "  In the present work we investigate the link between high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) and star formation in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), our nearest\nstar-forming galaxy. Using optical photometric data, we identify the most\nlikely counterpart of 44 X-ray sources. Among the 40 HMXBs classified in this\nwork, we find 33 Be/X-ray binaries, and 4 supergiant XRBs. Using this census\nand the published spatially resolved star-formation history map of the LMC, we\nfind that the HMXBs (and as expected the X-ray pulsars) are present in regions\nwith star-formation bursts $\\sim$6-25 Myr ago, in contrast to the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), for which this population peaks at later ages\n($\\sim$25-60 Myr ago). We also estimate the HMXB production rate to be equal to\n1 system per $\\sim43.5\\times10^{-3}$ Mo/yr, or 1 system per $\\sim$143 Mo of\nstars formed during the associated star-formation episode. Therefore, the\nformation efficiency of HMXBs in the LMC is $\\sim$17 times lower than that in\nthe SMC. We attribute this difference primarily in the different ages and\nmetallicity of the HMXB populations in the two galaxies. We also set limits on\nthe kicks imparted on the neutron star during the supernova explosion. We find\nthat the time elapsed since the supernova kick is $\\sim$3 times shorter in the\nLMC than the SMC. This in combination with the average offsets of the HMXBs\nfrom their nearest star clusters results in $\\sim$4 times faster transverse\nvelocities for HMXBs in the LMC than in the SMC.\n", "  We demonstrate the fractional Talbot effect of nonpraxial accelerating beams,\ntheoretically and numerically. It is based on the interference of nonparaxial\naccelerating solutions of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. The effect\noriginates from the interfering lobes of a superposition of the solutions that\naccelerate along concentric semicircular trajectories with different radii.\nTalbot images form along certain central angles, which are referred to as the\nTalbot angles. The fractional nonparaxial Talbot effect is obtained by choosing\nthe coefficients of beam components properly. A single nonparaxial accelerating\nbeam possesses duality --- it can be viewed as a Talbot effect of itself with\nan infinite or zero Talbot angle. These results improve the understanding of\nnonparaxial accelerating beams and the Talbot effect among them.\n", "  The electronic structure modifications of WSe2 upon NO2-adsorption at room\nand low temperatures were studied by means of photoelectron spectroscopy. We\nfound only moderate changes in the electronic structure, which are manifested\nas an upward shift of the WSe2-related bands to the smaller binding energies.\nThe observed effects are modelled within the density functional theory\napproach, where a weak adsorption energy of gas molecules on the surface of\nWSe2 was deduced. The obtained experimental data are explained as a valence\nbands polarisation effect, which causes their energy shift depending on the\nadsorption geometry and the formed dipole moment.\n", "  A possible method for linking the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame\n(GCRF) to the VLBI-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) is to\nuse radio stars in a manner similar to that in the linking of the Hipparcos\nCelestial Reference Frame (HCRF) to ICRF. In this work, an obtainable accuracy\nof the orientation angles between GCRF and ICRF frames was estimated by Monte\nCarlo simulation. If the uncertainties in the radio star positions obtained by\nVLBI are in the range of 0.1-4 mas and those obtained by Gaia are in the range\nof 0.005-0.4 mas, the orientation angle uncertainties are 0.018-0.72 mas if 46\nradio stars are used, 0.013-0.51 mas if 92 radio stars are used, and\n0.010-0.41~mas if 138 radio stars are used. The general conclusion from this\nstudy is that a properly organized VLBI programme for radio star observation\nwith a reasonable load on the VLBI network can allow for the realization of\nGCRF-ICRF link with an error of about 0.1 mas.\n", "  Most random graph models are locally tree-like - do not contain short cycles\n- rendering them unfit for modeling networks with a community structure. We\nintroduce the hierarchical configuration model (HCM), a generalization of the\nconfiguration model that includes community structures, while properties such\nas the size of the giant component, and the size of the giant percolating\ncluster under bond percolation can still be derived analytically. Viewing\nreal-world networks as realizations of the HCM, we observe two previously\nunobserved power-law relations: between the number of edges inside a community\nand the community sizes, and between the number of edges going out of a\ncommunity and the community sizes. We also relate the power-law exponent $\\tau$\nof the degree distribution with the power-law exponent of the community size\ndistribution $\\gamma$. In the special case of extremely dense communities\n(e.g., complete graphs), this relation takes the simple form $\\tau=\\gamma-1$.\n", "  We consider minimal effective interactions of the 750 GeV mass resonance\nobserved recently by ATLAS and CMS. Assuming a new scalar and gauge invariant\neffective interactions leads to non-trivial two particle scattering amplitudes\nwith asymptotic gauge boson states. The longitudinally polarized $W\\pm$ and $Z$\nbosons interacting via dimension-five effective operators provide stringent\nconstraints on the validity of the effective model. The large width found by\nATLAS implying a bound of approximately 500 GeV already below the resonance,\nturns this scenario unlikely. For production mainly in gluon fusion we get an\nupper bound of $\\sim 1.3$ TeV and strong limits on the masses of the underlying\nvector-like fermions are given.\n", "  We investigate the zero-temperature ferromagnetic behavior of a two-component\nrepulsive Fermi gas in the presence of a correlated random field that\nrepresents an optical speckle pattern. The density is tuned so that the\n(noninteracting) Fermi energy is close to the mobility edge of the Anderson\nlocalization transition. We employ quantum Monte Carlo simulations to determine\nvarious ground-state properties, including the equation of state, the magnetic\nsusceptibility, and the energy of an impurity immersed in a polarized Fermi gas\n(repulsive polaron). In the weakly interacting limit, the magnetic\nsusceptibility is found to be suppressed by disorder. However, it rapidly\nincreases with the interaction strength, and it diverges at a much weaker\ninteraction strength compared to the clean gas. Both the transition from the\nparamagnetic phase to the partially ferromagnetic phase, and the one from the\npartially to the fully ferromagnetic phase are strongly favored by disorder,\nindicating a case of order induced by disorder.\n", "  The heptazine-based polymer melon (also known as graphitic carbon nitride,\ng-C3N4), is a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Nonetheless,\nattempts to improve its inherently low activity are rarely based on rational\napproaches due to a lack of fundamental understanding of its mechanistic\noperation. Here, we employ molecular heptazine-based model catalysts to\nidentify the cyanamide moiety as a photocatalytically relevant \"defect\". We\nexploit this knowledge for the rational design of a carbon nitride polymer\npopulated with cyanamide groups, yielding a material with 12- and 16-times the\nhydrogen evolution rate and apparent quantum efficiency (400 nm), respectively,\ncompared to the benchmark melon. Computational modelling and material\ncharacterization suggest this moiety improves co-ordination (and, in turn,\ncharge transfer kinetics) to the platinum co-catalyst and enhances the\nseparation of the photo-generated charge carriers. The demonstrated knowledge\ntransfer for rational catalyst design presented here provides the conceptual\nframework for engineering high performance heptazine-based photocatalysts.\n", "  We obtain a large class of Lorentzian wormhole spacetimes in scalar-tensor\ngravity, for which the matter stress energy does satisfy the weak energy\ncondition. Our constructions have zero Ricci scalar and an everywhere finite,\nnon-zero scalar field profile. Interpreting the scalar-tensor gravity as an\neffective on-brane theory resulting from a two-brane Randall--Sundrum model of\nwarped extra dimensions, it is possible to link wormhole existence with that of\nextra dimensions. We study the geometry, matter content, gravitational\nred-shift and circular orbits in such wormholes and argue that our examples are\nperhaps among those which may have some observational relevance in astrophysics\nin future. We also study traversability and find that our wormholes are indeed\ntraversable for values of the metric parameters satisfying the weak energy\ncondition.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the strong lensing statistics in galaxy\nclusters. We extract dark matter haloes from the Millennium-XXL simulation,\ncompute their Einstein radius distribution, and find a very good agreement with\nMonte Carlo predictions produced with the MOKA code. The distribution of the\nEinstein radii is well described by a log-normal distribution, with a\nconsiderable fraction of the largest systems boosted by different projection\neffects. We discuss the importance of substructures and triaxiality in shaping\nthe size of the critical lines for cluster size haloes. We then model and\ninterpret the different deviations, accounting for the presence of a Bright\nCentral Galaxy (BCG) and two different stellar mass density profiles. We\npresent scaling relations between weak lensing quantities and the size of the\nEinstein radii. Finally we discuss how sensible is the distribution of the\nEinstein radii on the cosmological parameters {\\Omega}_M-{\\sigma}_8 finding\nthat cosmologies with higher {\\Omega}_M and {\\sigma}_8 possess a large sample\nof strong lensing clusters. The Einstein radius distribution may help\ndistinguish Planck13 and WMAP7 cosmology at 3{\\sigma}.\n", "  Three-dimensional melting problems are investigated numerically with Lattice\nBoltzmann method (LBM). Regarding algorithm's accuracy and stability,\nMultiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) models are employed to simplify the collision\nterm in LBM. Temperature and velocity fields are solved with double\ndistribution functions, respectively. 3-D melting problems are solved with\ndouble MRT models for the first time in this article. The key point for the\nnumerical simulation of a melting problem is the methods to obtain the location\nof the melting front and this article uses interfacial tracking method. The\ninterfacial tracking method combines advantages of both deforming and fixed\ngrid approaches. The location of the melting front was obtained by calculating\nthe energy balance at the solid-liquid interface. Various 3-D conduction\ncontrolled melting problems are solved firstly to verify the numerical method.\nLiquid fraction tendency and temperature distribution obtained from numerical\nmethods agree with the analytical results well. The proposed double MRT model\nwith interfacial tracking method is valid to solve 3-D melting problems.\nDifferent 3-D convection controlled melting problems are then solved with the\nproposed numerical method. Various locations of the heat surface have different\nmelting front moving velocities, due to the natural convection effects.\nRayleigh number's effects to the 3-D melting process is discussed.\n", "  We develop a continuum theory for equilibrium elasticity of a network of\ncrosslinked semiflexible filaments, spanning the full range between flexible\nentropy-driven chains to stiff athermal rods. We choose the 3-chain\nconstitutive model over several plausible candidates, and derive analytical\nexpressions for the elastic energy at arbitrary strain, with the corresponding\nstress-strain relationship. The theory fits well to a wide range of\nexperimental data on simple shear in different filament networks,\nquantitatively matching the differential shear modulus variation with stress,\nwith only two adjustable parameters (which represent the filament stiffness and\npre-tension in the network, respectively). The general theory accurately\ndescribes the crossover between the positive and negative Poynting effect\n(normal stress on imposed shear) on increasing the stiffness of filaments\nforming the network.\n", "  A two-dimensional axisymmetric transient laser drilling model is used to\nanalyze the effects of laser beam diameter and laser pulse duration on the\nlaser drilling process. The model includes conduction and convection heat\ntransfer, melting, solidification and vaporization, as well as material removal\nresulting from the vaporization and melt ejection. The validated model is\napplied to study the effects of laser beam size and pulse duration on the\ngeometry of the drilled hole. It is found that the ablation effect decrease\nwith the increasing beam diameter due to the effect of increased vaporization\nrate, and deeper hole is observed for the larger pulse width due to the higher\nthermal ablation efficiency.\n", "  This work considers an extension of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector by a\nreal, scalar singlet field, including applicability to a dark matter (DM) model\nwith the addition of a Yukawa coupling to a Dirac fermion. The collider\nsignatures and constraints on the mixed two-Higgs scenario are determined,\nincluding limits from Higgs production signals and exclusion searches, as well\nas constraints arising from the Higgs total and invisible widths. As there is\noverwhelming Higgs data which is consistent with a SM scenario, the case in\nwhich an additional scalar has evaded detection is further explored in the\ncontext of Higgs precision measurement. The discovery reach and prospective\nsignatures of the model at a proposed linear collider are investigated, with\nparticular focus on the Higgs triple coupling, and di-Higgs production\nprocesses.\n", "  We study the massless flows described by the staircase model introduced by\nAl.B. Zamolodchikov through the analytic continuation of the sinh-Gordon\nS-matrix, focusing on the renormalisation group flow from the tricritical to\nthe critical Ising model. We show that the properly defined roaming limits of\ncertain sinh-Gordon form factors are identical to the form factors of the order\nand disorder operators for the massless flow. As a by-product, we also\nconstruct form factors for a semi-local field in the sinh-Gordon model, which\ncan be associated with the twist field in the ultraviolet limiting free\nmassless bosonic theory.\n", "  Coherent quantum-state manipulation of trapped ions using classical laser\nfields is a trademark of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we study\naspects of work statistics and irreversibility in a single trapped ion due to\nsudden interaction with the impinging laser. This is clearly an\nout-of-equilibrium process where work is performed through illumination of an\nion by the laser. Starting with the explicit evaluation of the first moments of\nthe work distribution, we proceed to a careful analysis of irreversibility as\nquantified by the nonequilibrium lag. The treatment employed here is not\nrestricted to the Lamb-Dicke limit, which allows us to investigate the\ninterplay between nonlinearities and irreversibility. We show that in these\nmultiquantum or sideband regimes, variation of the Lamb-Dicke parameter causes\na non-monotonic behavior of the irreversibility indicator. Counterintuitively,\nwe find a working point where nonlinearity helps reversibility, making the\nsudden quench of the Hamiltonian closer to what would have been obtained\nquasistatically and isothermally.\n", "  We extend the velocity channel analysis (VCA), introduced by Lazarian &\nPogosyan, of the intensity fluctuations in the velocity slices of\nposition-position-velocity (PPV) spectroscopic data from Doppler broadened\nlines to study statistical anisotropy of the underlying velocity and density\nthat arises in a turbulent medium from the presence of magnetic field. In\nparticular, we study analytically how the anisotropy of the intensity\ncorrelation in the channel maps changes with the thickness of velocity\nchannels. In agreement with the earlier VCA studies we find that the anisotropy\nin the thick channels reflects the anisotropy of the density field, while the\nrelative contribution of density and velocity fluctuations to the thin velocity\nchannels depends on the density spectral slope. We show that the anisotropies\narising from Alfven, slow and fast magnetohydrodynamical modes are different,\nin particular, the anisotropy in PPV created by fast modes is opposite to that\ncreated by Alfven and slow modes, and this can be used to separate their\ncontributions. We successfully compare our results with the recent numerical\nstudy of the PPV anisotropies measured with synthetic observations. We also\nextend our study to the medium with self-absorption as well as to the case of\nabsorption lines. In addition, we demonstrate how the studies of anisotropy can\nbe performed using interferometers.\n", "  Tsallis-$q$ entanglement is a bipartite entanglement measure which is the\ngeneralization of entanglement of formation for $q$ tending to 1. We first\nexpand the range of $q$ for the analytic formula of Tsallis-\\emph{q}\nentanglement. For $\\frac{5-\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\leq \\emph{q} \\leq\n\\frac{5+\\sqrt{13}}{2}$, we prove the monogamy relation in terms of the squared\nTsallis-$q$ entanglement for an arbitrary multi-qubit systems. It is shown that\nthe multipartite entanglement indicator based on squared Tsallis-$q$\nentanglement still works well even when the indicator based on the squared\nconcurrence loses its efficacy. We also show that the $\\mu$-th power of\nTsallis-\\emph{q} entanglement satisfies the monogamy or polygamy inequalities\nfor any three-qubit state.\n", "  The dispersion properties of elliptically polarized electromagnetic (EM)\nwaves in a magnetized electron-positron-pair (EP-pair) plasma are studied with\nthe effects of particle dispersion associated with the Bohm potential, the\nFermi degenerate pressure, and the exchange-correlation force. Two possible\nmodes of the extraordinary or X wave, modified by these quantum effects, are\nidentified and their propagation characteristics are investigated numerically.\nIt is shown that the upper-hybrid frequency, and the cutoff and resonance\nfrequencies are no longer constants but are dispersive due to these quantum\neffects. It is found that the particle dispersion and the exchange-correlation\nforce can have different dominating roles on each other depending on whether\nthe X waves are of short or long wavelengths (in comparison with the Fermi\nDebye length). The present investigation should be useful for understanding the\ncollective behaviors of EP plasma oscillations and the propagation of\nextraordinary waves in magnetized dense EP-pair plasmas.\n", "  YbCo$_2$Ge$_4$ is a clean paramagnetic Kondo lattice which displays non-Fermi\nliquid behavior. We report a detailed investigation of the specific heat,\nmagnetic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter ($\\Gamma_{\\rm mag}$) and temperature derivative\nof the magnetization ($M$) on a high-quality single crystal at temperatures\ndown to $0.1$~K and magnetic fields up to 7~T. $\\Gamma_{\\rm mag}$ and $dM/dT$\ndisplay a divergence upon cooling and obey $T/B$ scaling. Similar behavior has\npreviously been found in several other Yb-based Kondo lattices and related to a\nzero-field quantum critical point without fine tuning of pressure or\ncomposition. However, in the approach of $B\\rightarrow 0$ the electronic heat\ncapacity coefficient of YbCo$_2$Ge$_4$ saturates at low $T$, excluding\nferromagnetic quantum criticality. This indicates that $T/B$ scaling is\ninsufficient to prove a zero-field quantum critical point.\n", "  We investigate the presence and importance of dark matter discs in a sample\nof 24 simulated Milky Way galaxies in the APOSTLE project, part of the EAGLE\nprogramme of hydrodynamic simulations in Lambda-CDM cosmology. It has been\nsuggested that a dark disc in the Milky Way may boost the dark matter density\nand modify the velocity modulus relative to a smooth halo at the position of\nthe Sun, with ramifications for direct detection experiments. From a kinematic\ndecomposition of the dark matter and a real space analysis of all 24 halos, we\nfind that only one of the simulated Milky Way analogues has a detectable dark\ndisc component. This unique event was caused by a merger at late time with an\nLMC-mass satellite at very low grazing angle. Considering that even this rare\nscenario only enhances the dark matter density at the solar radius by 35% and\naffects the high energy tail of the dark matter velocity distribution by less\nthan 1%, we conclude that the presence of a dark disc in the Milky Way is\nunlikely, and is very unlikely to have a significant effect on direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  We determine the scaling properties of the Yang-Lee edge singularity as\ndescribed by a one-component scalar field theory with imaginary cubic coupling,\nusing the nonperturbative functional renormalization group in $3 \\leq d\\leq 6$\nEuclidean dimensions. We find very good agreement with high-temperature series\ndata in $d = 3$ dimensions and compare our results to recent estimates of\ncritical exponents obtained with the four-loop $\\epsilon = 6-d$ expansion and\nthe conformal bootstrap. The relevance of operator insertions at the\ncorresponding fixed point of the RG $\\beta$ functions is discussed and we\nestimate the error associated with $\\mathcal{O}(\\partial^4)$ truncations of the\nscale-dependent effective action.\n", "  We point out that two of the most important theorems of Quantum Mechanics,\nthe Ehrenfest theorem and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, lack in their standard\nform important information: there are cases where non-Hermitian boundary\ncontributions emerge. These contributions actually appear naturally, in order\nfor the above theorems to be valid and applicable (i.e. in multiply-connected\nspaces), and this occurs for physical quantities that are not represented by\nwell-defined self-adjoint operators (such as the position operator in a\nperiodic potential, or in general Aharonov-Bohm configurations, either in real\nor in an arbitrary parameter-space, in the sense of Berry's adiabatic and\ncyclic procedures). In this short note, we report modifications of these two\ntheorems when such non-Hermiticities appear, and we demonstrate how they\nresolve certain Quantum Mechanical paradoxes (most of them having been noticed\nin the past as violations of the so-called Hypervirial theorem in Quantum\nChemistry). This resolution of paradoxes (essentially the re-establishment of\napplicability of the Ehrenfest theorem even in multiply-connected spaces)\nalways proceeds through the appearance of certain generalized currents, in a\ntheoretical picture with interesting structure (where a generalized continuity\nequation with a sink term shows up naturally).\n", "  Continuing with previous research (Camperi et al. 2011),new heliocentric\nradial velocity distributions are presented for the nearby galaxy NGC 253,\nobtained from the ionized hydrogen recombination line H-alpha. These\ndistributions have been derived from long-slit spectroscopy for various\nposition angles. It is also shown the heliocentric radial velocity distribution\ncorresponding to part of the infrared data (ionized hydrogen recombination line\nBr-gamma) observed with the Phoenix spectrograph of the Gemini South\nObservatory. Sequential mapping with the long slit using this instrument will\nenable to study in detail the kinematics of the galaxy's core, which is\nstrongly obscured by dust.\n", "  Choice of appropriate force field is one of the main concerns of any\natomistic simulation that needs to be seriously considered in order to yield\nreliable results. Since, investigations on mechanical behavior of materials at\nmicro/nanoscale has been becoming much more widespread, it is necessary to\ndetermine an adequate potential which accurately models the interaction of the\natoms for desired applications. In this framework, reliability of multiple\nembedded atom method based interatomic potentials for predicting the elastic\nproperties was investigated. Assessments were carried out for different copper,\naluminum and nickel interatomic potentials at room temperature which is\nconsidered as the most applicable case. Examined force fields for the three\nspecies were taken from online repositories of National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST), as well as the Sandia National Laboratories, the LAMMPS\ndatabase. Using molecular dynamic simulations, the three independent elastic\nconstants, C11, C12 and C44 were found for Cu, Al and Ni cubic single crystals.\nVoigt-Reuss-Hill approximation was then implemented to convert elastic\nconstants of the single crystals into isotropic polycrystalline elastic moduli\nincluding Bulk, Shear and Young's modulus as well as Poisson's ratio.\nSimulation results from massive molecular dynamic were compared with available\nexperimental data in the literature to justify the robustness of each potential\nfor each species. Eventually, accurate interatomic potentials have been\nrecommended for finding each of the elastic properties of the pure species.\nExactitude of the elastic properties was found to be sensitive to the choice of\nthe force fields. Those potentials were fitted for a specific compound may not\nnecessarily work accurately for all the existing pure species.\n", "  Previous numerical studies had apparently ruled out the possibility that\nflares in galaxy discs could give rise to the apparent breaks in their\nluminosity profiles when observed edge-on. However the studies have not, until\nnow, analyzed this hypothesis systematically using realistic models for the\ndisc, the flare, and the bulge. We revisit this theme by analyzing a series of\nmodels which sample a wide range of observationally based structural parameters\nfor these three components. We have considered realistic distributions of bulge\nto disc ratios, morphological parameters of bulges and discs, vertical scale\nheights of discs and their radial gradients defining the flare for different\nmorphological types and stellar mass bins, based on observations. The surface\nbrightness profiles for the face-on and edge-on views of each model were\nsimulated to find out whether the flared disc produces a Type-II break in the\ndisc profile when observed edge-on, and if so under what conditions. Contrary\nto previous claims, we find that discs with realistic flares can produce\nsignificant breaks in discs when observed edge-on. Specifically a flare with\nthe parameters of that of the Milky Way would produce a significant break of\nthe disc at a Rbreak of ~8.6 kpc if observed edge-on. Central bulges have no\nsignificant effects on the results. These simulations show that flared discs\ncan explain the existence of many Type-II breaks observed in edge-on galaxies,\nin a range of galaxies with low-to-intermediate break strength values of\n-0.25<S<-0.1.\n", "  Exchange bias is one of the most extensively studied phenomena in magnetism,\nsince it exerts a unidirectional anisotropy to a ferromagnet (FM) when coupled\nto an antiferromagnet (AFM) and the control of the exchange bias is therefore\nvery important for technological applications, such as magnetic random access\nmemory and giant magnetoresistance sensors. In this letter, we report the\ncrystal structure manipulation of the exchange bias in epitaxial hcp Cr2O3\nfilms. By epitaxially growing twined (10-10) oriented Cr2O3 thin films, of\nwhich the c axis and spins of the Cr atoms lie in the film plane, we\ndemonstrate that the exchange bias between Cr2O3 and an adjacent permalloy\nlayer is tuned to in-plane from out-of-plane that has been observed in (0001)\noriented Cr2O3 films. This is owing to the collinear exchange coupling between\nthe spins of the Cr atoms and the adjacent FM layer. Such a highly anisotropic\nexchange bias phenomenon is not possible in polycrystalline films.\n", "  We give the free energy of equilibrium relativistic matter subject to\nexternal gravitational and electromagnetic fields, to one-derivative order in\nthe gradients of the external fields. The free energy allows for a\nstraightforward derivation of bound currents and bound momenta in equilibrium.\nAt leading order, the energy-momentum tensor admits a simple expression in\nterms of the polarization tensor. Beyond the leading order, electric and\nmagnetic polarization vectors are intrinsically ambiguous. The physical effects\nof polarization, such as the correlation between the magneto-vortically induced\nsurface charge and the electro-vortically induced surface current, are not\nambiguous.\n", "  We consider two non-interacting infinite quantum spin chains immersed in a\ncommon thermal environment and undergoing a local dissipative dynamics of\nLindblad type. We study the time evolution of collective mesoscopic quantum\nspin fluctuations that, unlike macroscopic mean-field observables, retain a\nquantum character in the thermodynamical limit. We show that the microscopic\ndissipative dynamics is able to entangle these mesoscopic degrees of freedom,\nthrough a purely mixing mechanism. Further, the behaviour of the dissipatively\ngenerated quantum correlations between the two chains is studied as a function\nof temperature and dissipation strength.\n", "  We describe a 3D percolation-type approach to modeling of the processes of\naging and certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of\ninteracting cells. Lattice sites are designated as regular (healthy) cells,\nsenescent cells, or vacancies left by dead (apoptotic) cells. The system is\nthen studied dynamically with the ongoing processes including regular cell\ndividing to fill vacant sites, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and\nsenescent cells dying. Statistical-mechanics description can provide patterns\nof time dependence and snapshots of morphological system properties. The\ndeveloped theoretical modeling approach is found not only to corroborate recent\nexperimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended\nlifespan, but also to confirm that, unlike 2D, in 3D senescent cells can\ncontribute to tissue's connectivity/mechanical stability. The latter effect\noccurs by senescent cells forming the second infinite cluster in the regime\nwhen the regular (healthy) cell's infinite cluster still exits.\n", "  We report a surprising result, established by numerical simulations and\nanalytical arguments for a one-dimensional lattice model of random sequential\nadsorption, that even an arbitrarily small imprecision in the lattice-site\nlocalization changes the convergence to jamming from fast, exponential, to\nslow, power-law, with, for some parameter values, a discontinuous jump in the\njamming coverage value. This finding has implications for irreversible\ndeposition on patterned substrates with pre-made landing sites for particle\nattachment. We also consider a general problem of the particle (depositing\nobject) size not an exact multiple of the lattice spacing, and the lattice\nsites themselves imprecise, broadened into allowed-deposition intervals.\nRegions of exponential vs. power-law convergence to jamming are identified, and\ncertain conclusions regarding the jamming coverage are argued for analytically\nand confirmed numerically.\n", "  We consider an N=2 supersymmetric odd-order Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator with\ndistinct frequencies of oscillation. The technique previously developed in\n[Acta Phys. Polon. B 36 (2005) 2115; Nucl. Phys. B 902 (2016) 95] is used to\nconstruct a family of Hamiltonian structures for this system.\n", "  Using ladder operators for the non-linear oscillator with position-dependent\neffective mass, realization of the dynamic group SU(1,1) is presented. Keeping\nin view the algebraic structure of the non-linear oscillator, coherent states\nare constructed using Barut-Girardello formalism and their basic properties are\ndiscussed. Furthermore, the statistical properties of these states are\ninvestigated by means of Mandel parameter and second order correlation\nfunction. Moreover, it is shown that in the harmonic limit, all the results\nobtained for the non-linear oscillator with spatially varying mass reduce to\ncorresponding results of the linear oscillator with constant mass.\n", "  This \"Perspectives\" paper gives a brief overview of the recent developments\nwith quantum-gas microscopes and how they can be used to build the next\ngeneration of cold-atom quantum simulators.\n", "  In this work we investigate localized and extended objects for gravitating,\nself-interacting phantom fields. The phantom fields come from two scalar fields\nwith a \"wrong sign\" (negative) kinetic energy term in the Lagrangian. This\nstudy covers several solutions supported by these phantom fields: phantom\nballs, traversable wormholes, phantom cosmic strings, and \"phantom\" domain\nwalls. These four systems are solved numerically and we try to draw out\ngeneral, interesting features in each case.\n", "  It has been recently suggested that the coexistence of ferroelectricity and\nRashba-like spin-splitting effects due to spin-orbit coupling in a single\nmaterial may allow for a non-volatile electric control of spin degrees of\nfreedom. In the present work, we compared the structural and ferroelectric\nproperties of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases of ferroelectric BiAlO$_3$ by\nmeans of density-functional calculations. In both phases, we carefully\ninvestigated Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, giving rise to spin-splitting in\ntheir bulk electronic structure, particularly near the conduction band minimum,\nsupplementing our first-principles results with an effective $ k\\cdot p$ model\nanalysis. The full reversal of the spin texture with ferroelectric polarization\nswitching was also predicted. BiAlO$_3$ can therefore be considered as the\nfirst known oxide to exhibit a coexistence of ferroelectricity and\nRashba-Dresselhaus effects.\n", "  We demonstrate that encapsulation of atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) by\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets is very effective for minimizing the\ninterface impurities induced during fabrication of BP channel material for\nquantum transport nanodevices. Highly stable BP nanodevices with ultrahigh\nmobility and controllable types are realized through depositing appropriate\nmetal electrodes after conducting a selective etching to the BP encapsulation\nstructure. Chromium and titanium are suitable metal electrodes for BP channels\nto control the transition from a p-type unipolar property to ambipolar\ncharacteristic because of different work functions. Record-high mobilities of\n6000 $cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$ and 8400 $cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$ are respectively obtained\nfor electrons and holes at cryogenic temperatures. High-mobility BP devices\nenable the investigation of quantum oscillations with an indistinguishable\nZeeman effect in laboratory magnetic field.\n", "  In this work, we study the doping effects on the magnetic states of CuCrO2\nbased on the classical frustrated spin model [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. B 89,\n220405(R) (2014)]. Several experimental observations can be well reproduced by\nthe Monte Carlo simulations of the modified spin models. Our work suggests that\nthe disorder induced by V/Al doping cooperated with the frustration in the\nsystem may contribute to the emergence of the spin glass state. Furthermore,\nthe hole-doping by Mg2+ substituting Cr3+ enhances the quantum fluctuations and\nbond disorder which modulate the biquadratic exchanges, and in turn results in\nthe promotion of the spiral phase, consistent with the experimental report.\n", "  We investigate for order and chaos the dynamical system of a spinning test\nparticle of mass $m$ moving in the spacetime background of a Kerr black hole of\nmass M. This system is approximated in our investigation by the linear in spin\nHamiltonian function provided in [E. Barausse, and A. Buonanno, Phys.Rev. D 81,\n084024 (2010)]. We study the corresponding phase space by using 2D projections\non a surface of section and the method of color and rotation on a 4D Poincar\\'e\nsection. Various topological structures coming from the non-integrability of\nthe linear in spin Hamiltonian are found and discussed. Moreover, an\ninteresting result is that from the value of the dimensionless spin $S/(m\nM)=10^{-4}$ of the particle and below, the impact of the non-integrability of\nthe system on the motion of the particle seems to be negligible.\n", "  The occupied Landau levels of strange quark matter are investigated in the\nframework of the SU(3) NJL model with a conventional coupling and a\nmagnetic-field dependent coupling respectively. At lower density, the Landau\nlevels are mainly dominated by u and d quarks. Threshold values of the chemical\npotential for the s quark onset are shown in the $\\mu$-$B$ plane. The\nmagnetic-field-dependent running coupling can broaden the region of\nthree-flavor matter by decreasing the dynamical masses of $s$ quarks. Before\nthe onset of $s$ quarks, the Landau level number of light quarks is directly\ndependent on the magnetic field strength $B$ by a simple inverse proportional\nrelation $k_{i,\\mathrm{max}}\\approx B_i^0/B$ with $B_d^0=5\\times 10^{19}$ G,\nwhich is approximately 2 times $B_u^0$ of $u$ quarks at a common chemical\npotential. When the magnetic field increases up to $B^0_d$, almost all three\nflavors are lying in the lowest Landau level.\n", "  We establish the equivalence of the various techniques for measuring B(E2)\nvalues using a statistical analysis. Data used in this work come from the re-\ncent compilation by B. Pritychenko et al., At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 107\n(2016). We consider only those nuclei for which the B(E2) values were measured\nby at least two different methods, with each method being independently\nperformed at least twice. Our results indicate that most prevalent methods of\nmeasuring B(E2) values are equivalent, with some weak evidence that\nDoppler-shift attenuation method (DSAM) measurements may differ from Coulomb\nexcitation (CE) and nuclear resonance fuorescence (NRF) measurements. However,\nsuch an evidence appears to arise from discrepant DSAM measurements of the\nlifetimes for 60Ni and some Sn nuclei rather than a systematic deviation in the\nmethod itself.\n", "  These are the proceedings of the LHCSki 2016 workshop \"A First Discussion of\n13 TeV Results\" that has been held at the Obergurgl Universit\\\"atszentrum,\nTirol, Austria, April 10 - 15, 2016. In this workshop the consequences of the\nmost recent results from the LHC have been discussed, with a focus also on the\ninterplay with dark matter physics, flavor physics, and precision measurements.\nContributions from the workshop speakers have been compiled into this document.\n", "  We present the stellar mass (M_*) and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) absolute Band 1 magnitude (M_W1) Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) of\nsubsets of galaxies from the CO Legacy Database for the Galex Arecibo SDSS\nSurvey (COLD GASS). We examine the benefits and drawbacks of several commonly\nused fitting functions in the context of measuring CO(1-0) line widths (and\nthus rotation velocities), favouring the Gaussian Double Peak function. We find\nthe M_W1 and M_* TFR, for a carefully selected sub-sample, to be M_W1 = (-7.1\n+/- 0.6) [log(W_50/sin i) - 2.58] - 23.83 +/- 0.09 and log(M_*/M_Sun) = (3.3\n+/- 0.3) [log(W_50/sin i) - 2.58] + 10.51 +/- 0.04, respectively, where W_50 is\nthe width of a galaxy's CO(1-0) integrated profile at 50% of its maximum and\nthe inclination i is derived from the galaxy axial ratio measured on the SDSS\nr-band image. We find no evidence for any significant offset between the TFRs\nof COLD GASS galaxies and those of comparison samples of similar redshifts and\nmorphologies. The slope of the COLD GASS M_* TFR agrees with the relation of\nPizagno et al. (2005). However, we measure a comparatively shallower slope for\nthe COLD GASS M_W1 TFR as compared to the relation of Tully & Pierce (2000). We\nattribute this to the fact that the COLD GASS sample comprises galaxies of\nvarious (late-type) morphologies. Nevertheless, our work provides a robust\nreference point with which to compare future CO TFR studies.\n", "  A future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will deliver luminosities of $10^{33} -\n10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for collisions of polarized electrons and protons\nand heavy ions over a wide range of center-of-mass energies (40 $\\mathrm{GeV}$\nto 145 $\\mathrm{GeV}$). One of its promising physics programs is to study the\npartonic structure of quasi-real photons. Measuring di-jet in photoproduction\nevents, one can effectively access the underlying parton dynamics of the\nphotons through the selection of the resolved photon processes. In this paper,\nwe discuss the feasibility of tagging resolved photon processes and measuring\nthe di-jet cross section as a function of jet transverse momentum in ranges of\n$x_{\\gamma}^{rec}$ at an EIC. These studies show that parton distributions in\nthe photon can be extracted at an EIC.\n", "  Time-resolved imaging reveals that the helicity dependent all-optical\nswitching (HD-AOS) of Co/Pt ferromagnetic multilayers proceeds by two stages.\nFirst one involves the helicity independent and stochastic nucleation of\nreversed magnetic domains. At the second stage circularly polarized light\nbreaks the degeneracy between the magnetic domains and promotes the preferred\ndirection of domain wall (DW) motion. The growth of the reversed domain from\nthe nucleation cite, for a particular helicity, leads to full magnetic\nreversal. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism of HD-AOS mediated by the\ndeterministic displacement of DWs.\n", "  We show that it is possible to isolate a set of kaon fluctuations in lattice\nQCD. By means of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, we calculate the actual\nkaon second-to-first fluctuation ratio, which receives contribution from\nprimordial kaons and resonance decays, and show that it is very close to the\none obtained for primordial kaons in the Boltzmann approximation. The latter\nonly involves the strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials, which\nare functions of $T$ and $\\mu_B$ due to the experimental constraint on\nstrangeness and electric charge, and can therefore be calculated on the\nlattice. This provides an unambiguous method to extract the kaon freeze-out\ntemperature, by comparing the lattice results to the experimental values for\nthe corresponding fluctuations.\n", "  We derive a large-strain plate model that allows to describe transient,\ncoupled processes involving elasticity and solvent migration, by performing a\ndimensional reduction of a three-dimensional poroelastic theory. We apply the\nmodel to polymer gel plates, for which a specific kinematic constraint and\nconstitutive relations hold. Finally, we assess the accuracy of the plate model\nwith respect to the parent three-dimensional model through two numerical\nbenchmarks, solved by means of the finite element method. Our results show that\nthe theory offers an efficient computational framework for the study of\nswelling-induced morphing of composite gel plates.\n", "  Magnetic and magneto-transport properties of thin layers of the\n(Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) quaternary dilute magnetic semiconductor grown by the\nlow-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique on GaAs substrates have been\ninvestigated. Ferromagnetic Curie temperature and magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy of the layers have been examined by using magneto-optical Kerr\neffect magnetometry and low-temperature magneto-transport measurements.\nPostgrowth annealing treatment has been shown to enhance the hole concentration\nand Curie temperature in the layers. Significant increase in the magnitude of\nmagnetotransport effects caused by incorporation of a small amount of Bi into\nthe (Ga,Mn)As layers revealed in the planar Hall effect (PHE) measurements, is\ninterpreted as a result of enhanced spin-orbit coupling in the (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As)\nlayers. Two-state behaviour of the planar Hall resistance at zero magnetic\nfield provides its usefulness for applications in nonvolatile memory devices.\n", "  Electromagnetic probes such as direct photons and dileptons are crucial to\nstudy the properties of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy ion\ncollisions. Based on the (3+1)-dimensional event-by-event viscous hydrodynamic\nmodel EPOS 3.102, we calculated the anisotropic emission of thermal photons and\ndileptons in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)\nenergy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$~GeV. Thermal emissions from both QGP phase and\nhadronic gas phase are considered, with AMY rate for photons and Lattice QCD\nbased rates for dileptons in QGP phase. For emission from hadron gas phase,\nrates based vector meson dominant model are used for both photons and\ndileptons. Non-thermal contribution to direct photons is calculated with next\nto leading order QCD. STAR cocktail data are directly used for non-thermal\ncontribution to dileptons. With the same space-time evolution of the collision\nsystems, the two penetrating probes, photons and dileptonsshow some\nconsistency, ie, the emission of both thermal photons and dileptons are\nunderestimated, compared with the transverse momentum spectra of direct photons\nmeasured by PHENIX collaboration and the invariant mass spectra of dileptons\nmeasured by STAR collaboration, for all centrality classes. With a good\nconstraint of anisotropy of the plasma via the elliptic flow and triangular\nflow of charged hadrons, the resulted elliptic flow and triangular flow of\ndirect photons agree with PHENIX measurements reasonably well. Thus we made\npredictions to the flows of thermal dileptons. The elliptic flow of thermal\ndileptons is predicted larger than the available results from other models, and\ncomparable to the STAR measurement referring to all dileptons (thermal +\ncocktail) for minimal bias collisions.\n", "  It is not easy to rationalize how peer review, as the current grassroots of\nscience, can work based on voluntary contributions of reviewers. There is no\nrationale to write impartial and thorough evaluations. Consequently, there is\nno risk in submitting low-quality work by authors. As a result, scientists face\na social dilemma: if everyone acts according to his or her own self-interest,\nlow scientific quality is produced. Still, in practice, reviewers as well as\nauthors invest high effort in reviews and submissions.\n  We examine how the increased relevance of public good benefits (journal\nimpact factor), the editorial policy of handling incoming reviews, and the\nacceptance decisions that take into account reputational information can help\nthe evolution of high-quality contributions from authors. High effort from the\nside of reviewers is problematic even if authors cooperate: reviewers are still\nbest off by producing low-quality reviews, which does not hinder scientific\ndevelopment, just adds random noise and unnecessary costs to it. We show with\nagent-based simulations that tacit agreements between authors that are based on\nreciprocity might decrease these costs, but does not result in superior\nscientific quality. Our study underlines why certain self-emerged current\npractices, such as the increased importance of journal metrics, the\nreputation-based selection of reviewers, and the reputation bias in acceptance\nwork efficiently for scientific development. Our results find no answers,\nhowever, how the system of peer review with impartial and thorough evaluations\ncould be sustainable jointly with rapid scientific development.\n", "  We present an analysis of the impact of bars on the radial distributions of\nthe different types of supernovae (SNe) in the stellar discs of host galaxies\nwith various morphologies. We find that in Sa-Sbc galaxies, the radial\ndistribution of core-collapse (CC) SNe in barred hosts is inconsistent with\nthat in unbarred ones, while the distributions of SNe Ia are not significantly\ndifferent. At the same time, the radial distributions of both types of SNe in\nSc-Sm galaxies are not affected by bars. We propose that the additional\nmechanism shaping the distributions of Type Ia and CC SNe can be explained\nwithin the framework of substantial suppression of massive star formation in\nthe radial range swept by strong bars, particularly in early-type spirals. The\nradial distribution of CC SNe in unbarred Sa-Sbc galaxies is more centrally\npeaked and inconsistent with that in unbarred Sc-Sm hosts, while the\ndistribution of SNe Ia in unbarred galaxies is not affected by host morphology.\nThese results can be explained by the distinct distributions of massive stars\nin the discs of early-and late-type spirals.\n", "  On the basis of the experimental data concerning interactions between humans\nthe process of Ising-based model of opinion formation in a social network was\ninvestigated. In the paper the data concerning human social activity, i.e.\nfrequency and duration time of interpersonal interactions as well as age\ncorrelations - homophily are presented in comparison to base line homogeneous,\nstatic and uniform mixing. It is known from previous studies that number of\ncontact and average age of nearest neighbors are highly correlated with age of\nan individual. Such real, assortative patterns usually speed up processes (like\nepidemic spread) on the networks, but here it only plays a role for small\nsocial temperature values (by reducing `freezing by heating' effect). A real\nstructure of contacts affects processes in many various studies in different\nway, however here it causes stronger (dynamic) and smoother (durations)\nsusceptibility on external field. Moreover, our research shows that the cross\ninteractions between contact frequency and its duration impose the significant\nincrease in critical temperature.\n", "  Using first principles calculations, we have studied the structural and\nelastic properties of SrTMO3 (TM = Rh, Ti, Mo, Zr) under pressure by the plane\nwave pseudopotential method based on the density functional theory (DFT) within\nthe generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The optical properties have been\ninvestigated under zero pressure. It is observed that the calculated lattice\nparameters are in good agreement with the available experimental result and\nprevious theoretical results.\n", "  New arguments supporting the reality of large-scale fluctuations in the\ndensity of the visible matter in deep galaxy surveys are presented. A\nstatistical analysis of the radial distributions of galaxies in the COSMOS and\nHDF-N deep fields is presented. Independent spectral and photometric surveys\nexist for each field, carried out in different wavelength ranges and using\ndifferent observing methods. Catalogs of photometric redshifts in the optical\n(COSMOS-Zphot) and infrared (UltraVISTA) were used for the COSMOS field in the\nredshift interval $0.1 < z < 3.5$, as well as the zCOSMOS (10kZ) spectroscopic\nsurvey and the XMM-COSMOS and ALHAMBRA-F4 photometric redshift surveys. The\nHDFN-Zphot and ALHAMBRA-F5 catalogs of photometric redshifts were used for the\nHDF-N field. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the fluctuations in the\nnumbers of galaxies obtained for independent surveys of the same deep field\nreaches $R = 0.70 \\pm 0.16$. The presence of this positive correlation supports\nthe reality of fluctuations in the density of visible matter with sizes of up\nto 1 000 Mpc and amplitudes of up to 20% at redshifts $z \\sim 2$. The absence\nof correlations between the fluctuations in different fields (the correlation\ncoefficient between COSMOS and HDF-N is $R = -0.20 \\pm 0.31$) testifies to the\nindependence of structures visible in different directions on the celestial\nsphere. This also indicates an absence of any influence from universal\nsystematic errors (such as \"spectral voids\"), which could imitate the detection\nof correlated structures.\n", "  Building smaller transistors with enhanced functionality is critical in\nextending the limits of Moores law and meeting the demands of the electronics\nindustry. Here we demonstrate transistor operation in a suspended single carbon\nnanotube (CNT) using feedback-enabled radiation pressure of a near-field\nfocused laser that enabled significant changes in conductivity of the CNT.\nFurther, using in-situ tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we show that the change\nin conductivity of over five orders in magnitude is accompanied by self-induced\ndefect states within the CNT. The entire structure is less than 10 nm in\ndimension and shows promise of scalability. This is a novel method for\nachieving logic operations at the nanoscale.\n", "  The IV-VI binary semiconductors and and column V elements crystalize in one\nof the three varieties derived from the cubic rocksalt structure. The rocksalt\nstructure can be seen as a network of interpenetrating octahedra with an atom\nat the center of each octahedron and its six nearest neighbors at the vertices.\nWhat drives lower symmetry is the problem of placing ten electrons along three\nperpendicular axes with six equivalent neighbors. Rhombohedral and orthorhombic\ndistortions divide the six immediate neighbors in two distinct sets of first\nneighbors and second neighbors. This structural competition is at the origin of\nthe the remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit in SnSe and PbTe.\n", "  We performed time resolved spectroscopy of 1H0707-495 and IRAS 13224-3809\nusing long XMM-Newton observations. These are strongly variable narrow line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies and show broad features around 1 keV that has been\ninterpreted as relativistically broad Fe L$\\alpha$ lines. Such features are not\nclearly observed in other AGN despite sometimes having high iron abundance\nrequired by the best fitted blurred reflection models. Given the importance of\nthese lines, we explore the possibility if rapid variability of spectral\nparameters may introduce broad bumps/dips artificially in the time averaged\nspectrum, which may then be mistaken as broadened lines. We tested this\nhypothesis by performing time resolved spectroscopy using long (> 100 ks)\nXMM-Newton observations and by dividing it into segments with typical exposure\nof few ks. We extracted spectra from each such segment and modelled using a two\ncomponent phenomenological model consisting of a power law to represent hard\ncomponent and a black body to represent the soft emission. As expected both the\nsources showed variations in the spectral parameters. Using these variation\ntrends, we simulated model spectra for each segment and then co-added to get a\ncombined simulated spectrum. In the simulated spectra, we found no broad\nfeatures below 1 keV and in particular no deviation near 0.9 keV as seen in the\nreal average spectra. This implies that the broad Fe L? line that is seen in\nthe spectra of these sources is not an artifact of the variation of spectral\ncomponents and hence providing evidence that the line is indeed genuine.\n", "  We propose a new scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique\nthat can realize the three-dimensional (3D) characterization of vacancies,\nlighter and heavier dopants with high precision. Using multislice STEM imaging\nand diffraction simulations of beta-Ga2O3 and SrTiO3, we show that selecting a\nsmall range of low scattering angles can make the contrast of the\ndefect-containing atomic columns substantially more depth-dependent. The origin\nof the depth-dependence is the de-channeling of electrons due to the existence\nof a point defect in the atomic column, which creates extra ripples at low\nscattering angles. We show that, by capturing the de-channeling signal with\nnarrowly selected annular dark field angles (e.g. 20-40 mrad), the contrast of\na column containing a point defect in the image can be significantly enhanced.\nThe effect of sample thickness, crystal orientation, probe convergence angle,\nand experimental uncertainty will also be discussed. Our new technique can\ntherefore create new opportunities for highly precise 3D structural\ncharacterization of individual point defects in functional materials.\n", "  The El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a mode of interannual\nvariability in the coupled equatorial ocean/atmosphere Pacific. El Ni\\~no\ndescribes a state in which sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific\nincrease and upwelling of colder, deep waters diminishes. El Ni\\~no events\ntypically peak in boreal winter, but their strength varies irregularly on\ndecadal time scales. There were exceptionally strong El Ni\\~no events in\n1982-83, 1997-98 and 2015-16 that affected weather on a global scale. Widely\npublicized forecasts in 2014 predicted that the 2015-16 event would occur a\nyear earlier. Predicting the strength of El Ni\\~no is a matter of practical\nconcern due to its effects on hydroclimate and agriculture around the world.\nThis paper presents a new robust mechanism limiting the predictability of\nstrong ENSO events: the existence of an irregular switching between an\noscillatory state that has strong El Ni\\~no events and a chaotic state that\nlacks strong events, which can be induced by very weak seasonal forcing or\nnoise.\n", "  All-electrical (magnetic-material-free) spin injection is one of the\noutstanding goals in spintronics. Topological insulators (TIs) have been\nrecognized as a promising electrically controlled spin source thanks to the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling and in particular, the spin-momentum locked\ntopological surface states (TSS) supporting helically spin polarized currents.\nMany TI materials such as Bi-based chalcogenides are also layered 2D materials\nand can be incorporated into van der Waals (vdW) coupled heterostructures,\nopening the possibility of the utilization of TIs for electrical spin injection\ninto other 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate electrical injection of helically\nspin-polarized current into graphene through a 3D TI in a mechanically stacked\nheterostructure between Bi2Te2Se (a TI) and chemical vapor deposition\n(CVD)-grown graphene, using the spin potentiometric measurement. When a dc\ncurrent is flowing from the TI to graphene, we detect a striking step-like\nvoltage change (spin signal) in both the TI and graphene using ferromagnetic\n(FM) probes. The sign of the spin signal can be reversed by reversing the\ndirection of the dc bias current, and the corresponding amplitude of the spin\nsignal increases linearly with the bias current, indicative of a\ncurrent-induced helical spin polarization in both TI and graphene. In contrast,\nthe graphene itself exhibits usual nonlocal spin valve signal when the spins\nare injected using an FM electrode. We discuss possible origins of the helical\nspin polarization injected into the graphene in our TI/graphene heterostructure\nthat may include TSS as well as the spin-orbit coupled Rashba states. Our\nfindings show electrical injection of a spin helical current into graphene\nthrough a TI and demonstrate TIs as potential spin sources for future\nspintronic devices wherein spin manipulation is achieved electrically.\n", "  We studied the Szilard engine under the effect of generalized uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP). In the classical Szilard engine, the work done by the engine\nis reduced by the GUP effect via a modified ideal gas law. In the quantum\nSzilard engine, the correction comes from the shifted eigen energy due to the\nnonlinear momentum dependence. We studied its effect on both bosonic and\nfermionic molecules.\n", "  We analyze the null geodesic equations in five dimensional spherically\nsymmetric spacetime with collapsing inhomogeneous dust cloud. By using a new\nmethod, we prove the existence and non-existence of solutions to null geodesic\nequation emanating from central singularity for smooth initial distribution of\ndust. Moreover, we also show that the null geodesics can extend to null\ninfinity in a certain case, which imply the violation of cosmic censorship\nconjecture.\n", "  Based on the Debye-Callaway and the Klemens model, as well as molecular\ndynamics, the paper proposes mechanism of thermal conductivity reduction by\nembedding dense 60{\\deg} shuffle-set dislocation arrays into silicon\nnano-films. Thermal conductivity reduction to 2% of that of bulk silicon has\nbeen obtained. The reduction is found mainly due to longitudinal phonon\nscattering at the dislocation cores, where the scattering rate is stronger than\nthat presented by Klemens. Within an effective diameter of about 9 nm around\ntheir cores, the dislocations locally scatter phonons, resulting in a\ndramatical density-dependent reduction of thermal conductivity for a\ndislocation density larger than 10^14 m^-2.\n", "  This review work addresses the recent advances in solving more comprehensive\nHamiltonians. The generalized tight-binding model is developed to investigate\nthe feature-rich quantization phenomena in emergent 2D materials. The\nmutli-orbital bondings, the spin-orbital interactions, the various geometric\nstructures, and the external fields are taken into consideration\nsimultaneously. Specifically, the IV-group layered systems, black phosphorus\nand MoS$_{2}$ exhibit the unique magnetic quantization. This is clearly\nindicated in three kinds of Landau levels (LLs), the orbital-, spin- and\nvalley-dependent LL groups, the abnormal LL energy spectra, and the splitting,\ncrossing and anticrossing behaviors. A detailed comparison with the\neffective-mass model is made. Some theoretical predictions have been confirmed\nby the experimental measurements.\n", "  Combined effect of Carbon and Nitrogen levels and isothermal holding\ntemperature on the microstructure, precipitation and the tensile properties of\nVanadium microalloyed steels with 0.05 weight percent Vanadium were studied.\nTwo different Vanadium steels, one having higher Carbon and lower Nitrogen\ncontent, HCLN steel, and the other having lower Carbon and higher Nitrogen\ncontent, LCHN steel, were prepared and subjected to isothermal holding\ntreatment over a temperature range of 500 to 750 degree Celsius, after\nhot-deformation. Maximum precipitation strengthening from fine Vanadium\ncarbonitride precipitates has been found at intermediate isothermal holding\ntemperatures i.e. 600 to 650 degree Celsius in both the steels. In spite of the\nsignificantly smaller fraction of pearlite and bainite, coarser average ferrite\ngrain size and lower interaction of precipitation and dislocation in the\nferrite matrix, the yield strength of LCHN steel was close to HCLN steel. This\ncan be attributed to the higher precipitation strengthening ranging from 20 to\n50 MPa resulted from the finer Vanadium precipitates in LCHN steel than that of\nHCLN steel.\n", "  Design of effective micro cooling systems to address the challenges of ever\nincreasing heat flux from microdevices requires deep examination of real time\nproblems and has been tackled in depth. The most common and apparently\nmisleading assumption while designing micro cooling systems is that the heat\nflux generated by the device is uniform, but the reality is far from this.\nDetailed simulations have been performed by considering non uniform heat load\nemploying the configurations U, I, Z for parallel microchannel systems with\nwater and nanofluids as the coolants. An Intel Core i7 4770 3.40 GHz quad core\nprocessor has been mimicked using heat load data retrieved from a real\nmicroprocessor with non-uniform core activity. The study clearly demonstrates\nthat there is a non-uniform thermal load induced temperature maldistribution\nalong with the already existent flow maldistribution induced temperature\nmaldistribution. The suitable configuration(s) for maximum possible overall\nheat removal for a hot zone while maximizing the uniformity of cooling have\nbeen tabulated. An Eulerian Lagrangian model of the nanofluids show that such\nsmart coolants not only reduce the hot spot core temperature, but also the hot\nspot core region and thermal slip mechanisms of Brownian diffusion and\nthermophoresis are at the crux of this. The present work conclusively shows\nthat high flow maldistribution leads to high thermal maldistribution, as the\ncommon prevalent notion, is no longer valid and existing maldistribution can be\neffectively utilized to tackle specific hot spot location, making the present\nstudy important to the field.\n", "  The recently introduced scheme [20,21] is extended to propose an algebraic\nnon-perturbative approach for the analytical treatment of Schr\\\"odinger\nequations with non-solvable potentials involving an exactly solvable potential\nform together with an additional piece. As an illustration the procedure is\nsuccessfully applied to the Cornell potential by means of very simple algebraic\nmanipulations. However, instead of providing numerical eigenvalues for the only\nconsideration of the small strength of the related linear potential as in the\nprevious reports, the present model puts forward a clean route to interpret\nrelated experimental or precise numerical results involving wide range of the\nlinear potential strengths. We hope this new technique will shed some light on\nthe questions concerning with the limitations of the traditional perturbation\ntechniques.\n", "  More recently, comprehensive application results of approximate analytical\nsolutions of the Woods-Saxon potential in closed form for the 5-dimensional\nBohr Hamiltonian have been appeared [14] and its comparison to the data for\nmany different nuclei has clearly revealed the domains for the sucsess and\nfailure in case of using such potential forms to analyse the data concerning\nwith the nuclear structure of deformed nuclei within the frame of the\ncollective model. Gaining confidence from this work, exact solvability of the\nWoods-Saxon type potentials in lower dimensions for the bound states having\nzero angular momentum is carefully reviewed to finalize an ongoing discussion\nin the related literature and clearly shown that such kind of potentials have\nno analytical solutions even for l=0 case.\n", "  A first measurement is presented of exclusive photoproduction of $\\rho^0$\nmesons associated with leading neutrons at HERA. The data were taken with the\nH1 detector in the years 2006 and 2007 at a centre-of-mass energy of 319 GeV\nand correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.16/pb. The $\\rho^0$ mesons with\ntransverse momenta $p_T<1$ GeV are reconstructed from their decays to charged\npions, while leading neutrons carrying a large fraction of the incoming proton\nmomentum, $x_L>$0.35, are detected in the Forward Neutron Calorimeter having a\npolar angular acceptance < 0.75 mrad. Single- and double-differential cross\nsections are measured as a function of several variables. The data are\ninterpreted in terms of a double peripheral process, involving pion exchange at\nthe proton vertex followed by elastic photoproduction of a $\\rho^0$ meson on\nthe virtual pion. In the framework of one-pion-exchange dominance the elastic\ncross section of photon-pion scattering is extracted. The value of this cross\nsection indicates significant absorptive corrections for the exclusive reaction\n$\\gamma p \\to \\rho^0 n \\pi^+$.\n", "  We have studied the ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) iron concentrations in\nAl-free Fe containing Mg-silicate perovskite (Mg-Pv) at pressure (P),\ntemperature (T), and oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions related to the lower\nmantle using a thermodynamic model based on ab-initio calculations. We consider\nthe oxidation reaction and the charge disproportionation reaction, both of\nwhich can produce Fe3+ in Mg-Pv. The model shows qualitatively good agreement\nwith available experimental data on Fe3+/{\\Sigma}Fe ({\\Sigma}Fe = total Fe in\nsystem), spin transitions, and equations of state. We predict that under\nlower-mantle conditions Fe3+/{\\Sigma}Fe determined by the charge\ndisproportionation is estimated to be 0.01-0.07 in Al-free Mg-Pv, suggesting\nthat low Al Mg-Pv in the uppermost pyrolitic mantle (where majoritic garnet\ncontains most of the Al) and in the harzburgitic heterogeneities throughout the\nlower mantle contains very little Fe3+. We find that the volume reduction by\nthe spin transition of the B-site Fe3+ leads to a minimum Fe3+/{\\Sigma}Fe in\nMg-Pv at mid-mantle pressures. The model shows that configurational entropy is\na key driving force to create Fe3+ and therefore Fe3+ content is highly\ntemperature sensitive. The temperature sensitivity may lead to a maximum\nFe3+/{\\Sigma}Fe in Mg-Pv in warm regions at the core-mantle boundary region,\nsuch as Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), potentially altering the\nphysical (e.g., bulk modulus) and transport (e.g., thermal and electrical\nconductivities) properties of the heterogeneities.\n", "  Simulating nonadiabatic effects with many-body wave function approaches is an\nopen field with many challenges. Recent interest has been driven by new\nalgorithmic developments and improved theoretical understanding of properties\nunique to electron-ion wave functions. Fixed-node diffusion Monte Caro is one\ntechnique that has shown promising results for simulating electron-ion systems.\nIn particular, we focus on the CH molecule for which previous results suggested\na relatively significant contribution to the energy from nonadiabatic effects.\nWe propose a new wave function ansatz for diatomic systems which involves\ninterpolating the determinant coefficients calculated from configuration\ninteraction methods. We find this to be an improvement beyond previous wave\nfunction forms that have been considered. The calculated nonadiabatic\ncontribution to the energy in the CH molecule is reduced compared to our\nprevious results, but still remains the largest among the molecules under\nconsideration.\n", "  A performance measure for a DART tsunami buoy network has been developed. The\nmeasure is based on a statistical analysis of simulated forecasts of wave\nheights outside an impact site and how much the forecasts are degraded in\naccuracy when one or more buoys are inoperative. The analysis uses simulated\ntsunami height time series collected at each buoy from selected source segments\nin the Short-term Inundation Forecast for Tsunamis (SIFT) database and involves\na set for 1000 forecasts for each buoy/segment pair at sites just offshore of\nselected impact communities. Random error-producing scatter in the time series\nis induced by uncertainties in the source location, addition of real oceanic\nnoise, and imperfect tidal removal. Comparison with an error-free standard\nleads to root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for DART buoys located near a\nsubduction zone. The RMSEs indicate which buoy provides the best forecast\n(lowest RMSE) for sections of the zone, under a warning-time constraint for the\nforecasts of 3 hrs. The analysis also shows how the forecasts are degraded\n(larger minimum RMSE among the remaining buoys) when one or more buoys become\ninoperative. The RMSEs also provide a way to assess array augmentation or\nredesign such as moving buoys to more optimal locations. Examples are shown for\nbuoys off the Aleutian Islands and off the West Coast of South America for\nimpact sites at Hilo HI and along the U.S. West Coast (Crescent City CA and\nPort San Luis CA). A simple measure (coded green, yellow or red) of the current\nstatus of the network's ability to deliver accurate forecasts is proposed to\nflag the urgency of buoy repair.\n", "  Among the interfacial transport modulations to the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO)\nheterostructure, mechanical strain has been proven to be an effective approach\nby growing the LAO/STO films on different substrates with varying lattice\nmismatches to STO. However, this lattice-mismatch-induced strain effect is\nstatic and biaxial, hindering the study of the strain effect in a dynamic way.\nIn this work we realize dynamic and uniaxial strain to the LAO/STO oxide\nheterostructure at low temperature, through mechanical coupling from a\nmagnetostrictive template. This anisotropic strain results in symmetry breaking\nat the interface and induces further splitting of the electronic band structure\nand therefore produces different conductivities along the x and y in-plane\ndirections. In particular, we observe that along the strained direction the\ninterface conductivity decreases by up to 70% under a tensile strain, while it\nincreases by 6.8% under a compressive strain at 2 K. Also, it is revealed that\nthe modulation on the interfacial transport property can be anisotropic, i.e.,\nthe resistance changes differently when an excitation current is parallel or\nperpendicular to the strain direction. This approach of strain engineering\nprovides another degree of freedom for control of transport properties of oxide\nheterostructures and opens an additional way to investigate strain effects in\nmaterials science.\n", "  Four kinds of waveguide power dividers with different structures working at\n2.856 GHz are developed. By comparing the simulation performances of these four\nstructures, the power divider with matching rod in the middle of its structure\nhas got the best performance and finally be chosen for fabrication. The\nprototype has got qualified microwave measurement results as well as the high\nvacuum performance. It also works stable during the whole progress of microwave\ncommissioning.\n", "  We consider a basic quantum hybrid network model consisting of a number of\nnodes each holding a qubit, for which the aim is to drive the network to a\nconsensus in the sense that all qubits reach a common state. Projective\nmeasurements are applied serving as control means, and the measurement results\nare exchanged among the nodes via classical communication channels. We show how\nto carry out centralized optimal path planning for this network with all-to-all\nclassical communications, in which case the problem becomes a stochastic\noptimal control problem with a continuous action space. To overcome the\ncomputation and communication obstacles facing the centralized solutions, we\nalso develop a distributed Pairwise Qubit Projection (PQP) algorithm, where\npairs of nodes meet at a given time and respectively perform measurements at\ntheir geometric average. We show that the qubit states are driven to a\nconsensus almost surely along the proposed PQP algorithm, and that the expected\nqubit density operators converge to the average of the network's initial\nvalues.\n", "  Smith-Purcell radiation is used in several applications including the\nmeasurement of the longitudinal profile of electron bunches. A correct\nreconstruction of such profile requires a good understanding of the underlying\nmodel. We have compared the leading models of Smith-Purcell radiation and shown\nthat they are in agreement within the experimental errors.\n", "  The equilibrium structure of a Dinucleosome is studied using an elastic model\nthat takes into account the force and torque balance conditions. Using the\nproper boundary conditions, it is found that the conformational energy of the\nproblem does not depend on the length of the linker DNA. In addition it is\nshown that the two histone octamers are almost perpendicular to each other and\nthe linker DNA in short lengths is almost straight. These findings could shed\nsome light on the role of DNA elasticity in the chromatin structure.\n", "  We reveal that an isotropic homogeneous subwavelength particle with a high\nrefractive index can produce ultra-weak total scattering due to vanishing\ncontribution of the electric dipole moment. This effect can be explained with\nthe help of the Fano resonance and scattering efficiency associated with the\nexcitation of an anapole mode. The latter is a nonradiative mode emerging from\ndestructive interference of electric and toroidal dipole moments, and it can be\nemployed for a design of highly transparent optical materials.\n", "  Using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we propose a\nmicroscopic theory for near-field radiative heat transfer between metal plates.\nTight-binding models for the electrons are coupled to the electromagnetic field\ncontinuum. Our approach differs from the established ones based on\nfluctuational electrodynamics, in that it describes truly nonequilibrium steady\nstates, and is nonlocal in system's dielectric properties. For a two\nquantum-dot model a new length scale emerges at which the heat current shows a\npeak. This length scale is related to the physics of parallel plate capacitors.\nThe three-dimensional model results are consistent with the theory of Polder\nand van Hove except at very short distances.\n", "  We consider for clarity the simple case of the one dimensional\nnon-relativistic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and regard it as an ensemble mean\nrepresentation of the stochastic motion of a single particle in a vacuum,\nsubject to an undefined stochastic quantum force. By analyzing the Bohm\npotential it is found that the imaginary part of the quantum momentum is the\nroot mean square fluctuation of the particle around its mean velocity, where\nthe latter is the real part of the quantum momentum. The local mean of the\nquantum force is found to be proportional to the third spatial derivative of\nthe probability density function, and its associated pressure to the second\nspatial derivative. The latter is decomposed from the single particle diluted\ngas pressure, and this pressure partition allows the interpretation of the\nquantum Bohm potential as the energy required to put a particle in a bath of\nfluctuating vacuum at constant entropy and volume.\n  The stochastic force expectation value is zero and is uncorrelated with the\nparticle location, thus does not perform work on average. Nonetheless it is\nanti-correlated with volume and this anti-correlation leads to a new type of an\nHeisenberg like relation. We imply the dynamic Gaussian solution to the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation as a simple example for exploring the mean properties\nof this quantum force. Still an interesting remained open task is the\nidentification of the stochastic law that leads to these obtained mean\nproperties.\n", "  Topological Kondo insulators are a new class of topological insulators in\nwhich metallic surface states protected by topological invariants reside in the\nbulk band gap at low temperatures. Unlike other three-dimensional topological\ninsulators, a truly insulating bulk state, which is critical for potential\napplications in next-generation electronic devices, is guaranteed by many-body\neffects in the topological Kondo insulator. Furthermore, the system has strong\nelectron correlations that can serve as a testbed for interacting topological\ntheories. This topical review focuses on recent advances in the study of SmB6,\nthe most promising candidate for a topological Kondo insulator, from the\nperspective of spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with\nhighlights of some important transport results.\n", "  These proceedings collate lectures given at the twenty-eighth specialized\ncourse organised by the CERN Accelerator School (CAS). The course was held at\nthe Hotel du Parc, Baden, Switzerland from 7 - 14 May 2014, in collaboration\nwith the Paul Scherrer Institute. Following introductory lectures on\naccelerators and the requirements on power converters, the course covered\ncomponents and topologies of the different types of power converters needed for\nparticle accelerators. Issues of design, control and exploitation in a\nsometimes-hostile environment were addressed. Site visits to ABB and PSI\nprovided an insight into state-of-the-art power converter production and\noperation, while topical seminars completed the programme.\n", "  The PAMELA satellite experiment is providing comprehensive observations of\nthe interplanetary and magnetospheric radiation in the near-Earth environment.\nThanks to its identification capabilities and the semi-polar orbit, PAMELA is\nable to precisely measure the energetic spectra and the angular distributions\nof the different cosmic-ray populations over a wide latitude region, including\ngeomagnetically trapped and albedo particles. Its observations comprise the\nsolar energetic particle events between solar cycles 23 and 24, and the\ngeomagnetic cutoff variations during magnetospheric storms. PAMELA's\nmeasurements are supported by an accurate analysis of particle trajectories in\nthe Earth's magnetosphere based on a realistic geomagnetic field modeling,\nwhich allows the classification of particle populations of different origin and\nthe investigation of the asymptotic directions of arrival.\n", "  Recently, we presented a paper about the tip-induced superconducting phase on\nTaAs single crystal (arXiv:1607.00513). A conductance plateau with double\nconductance peaks at finite bias, sharp double dips and a zero bias conductance\npeak were observed in the point contact spectra (PCS). These three features in\none PCS suggest the possibility of p-wave like superconductivity and Majorana\nzero modes in the surface. Soon after our paper posted on arXiv, Gayen el al.\n(arXiv:1607.01405) questioned the underlying mechanism of our observations\nbased on their experimental measurements in conventional superconductors(Pb and\nNb) and conclusively indicated that the superconductivity observed in our TaAs\ncrystal is conventional. We disagree with their quick conclusion without any\nspecific study on the TaAs materials. We will explain in the following that for\nthe clean (Z=0) point contact (PC) in ballistic limit, the superconducting\ntransition feature in temperature dependence of PC resistance is expected. And\nthe critical current effect claimed by Gayen el al. cannot explain the observed\nPCS in our paper.\n", "  We give a complete list of a class of three-generation models in E8 x E8\nheterotic string theory and its dual F-theory on an elliptic Calabi-Yau over a\n(generalized) Hirzebruch variety in which the divisors of the relevant line\nbundles needed for a smooth Weierstrass model are effective. The most stringent\nconstraint on the bound of the eta class comes from the effectiveness of the\ndivisor of the bundle corresponding to the highest Casimir in Looijenga's\nweighted projective space, as well as from the compactness of the toric\nvariety. Comparison is also made with the list obtained in the literature.\n", "  There are several ways to turn a superconductor into a normal conductor:\nincrease the temperature, apply a high magnetic field, or run a large current.\nHigh-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors are unusual in the sense that experiments\nsuggest that destroying superconductivity by heating the sample to temperatures\nabove T$_c$ or by applying a high magnetic field result in different 'normal'\nstates. Spectroscopic probes show that above T$_c$, in the pseudogap regime,\nthe Fermi surface is partly gapped and there are no well-defined\nquasiparticles. Transport measurements, on the contrary, reveal quantum\noscillations in high magnetic fields and at low temperatures, suggesting a more\nusual Fermi liquid state. Studying the electronic structure while suppressing\nsuperconductivity by using current, will hopefully shed new light on this\nproblem. In type II superconductors, such as the cuprates, the resistive state\ncreated by the current is a result of vortex motion. The large dissipation in\nthe flux-flow regime makes spectroscopic measurements in the presence of\ncurrent challenging. We performed angle-resolved photoemission experiments in\nthin films of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$ while running high-density current\nthrough the samples. Clear evidence was found for non-uniform flux flow,\nleaving most of the sample volume free of mobile vortices and dissipation. The\nsuper-current changes the electronic spectrum, creating quasiparticle and\nquasihole pockets. The size of these pockets as a function of the current is\nfound to be doping dependent; it depends both on the superfluid stiffness and\non the strength of interactions.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of acoustic phonons amplification in Carbon\nNanotubes (CNT). The phenomenon is via Cerenkov emission (CE) of acoustic\nphonons using intraband transitions proposed by Mensah et. al.,~\\cite{1} in\nSemiconductor Superlattices (SSL) and confirmed in ~\\cite{2}. From this, an\nasymmetric graph of $\\Gamma^{CNT}$ on $\\frac{V_d}{V_s}$ and $\\Omega\\tau$ were\nobtained where amplification ($\\Gamma_{amp}^{CNT}$) $>>$ absorption\n($\\Gamma_{abs}^{CNT}$). The ratio, $\\frac{\\vert\n\\Gamma_{amp}^{CNT}\\vert}{\\vert\\Gamma_{abs}^{CNT}\\vert}\\approx 3.5$, at $V_d =\n1.02V_s$, $\\omega_q = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{THz}$ and $T = 85\\ K$ for scattering angle\n$\\theta > 0$ . A threshold field at which $\\Gamma_{abs}^{CNT}$ switches over to\n$\\Gamma_{amp}^{CNT}$ was calculated to be $E_{z}^{dc} = 6.2\\times 10^3\\\n\\mathrm{V/m}$. This field is far less than that deduced using Bloch-Type\nOscillation (BTO)~\\cite{3} which is $E_{BTO}^{dc} = 3.0\\times 10^5\\\n\\mathrm{V/m}$. The obtained $\\Gamma_{amp}^{CNT}$ would enable the use of CNT\nfor the production of SASER.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the experimental characterization of a negative\nrefractive material NRM at Ka band using LR labyrinth Ring and wire array WA.\nWe describe in detail the the LR and wire array characterization separately,\nand after that the combined experimental results, for NRM are reported. The LRs\nanalytical and simulation study is not new but design in Ka band and different\nexperimental procedure for the characterization of the negative refractive\nindex is the novelty of this paper. For performing a negative refractive index\nexperiment we made prism of 150 Prism angle . We get enhanced transmittance of\nmore than 20 dB from background, at a negative angle of refraction. The values\nof the negative refractive index in a band of about 1 G Hz around 31 GHz are\nretrieved from the experimental data.\n", "  A result from particle tracking states that, after a microbunched electron\nbeam is kicked, its trajectory changes while the orientation of the\nmicrobunching wavefront remains as before. Experiments at the LCLS showed that\nradiation in the kicked direction is produced practically without suppression.\nThis could be explained if the orientation of the microbunching wavefront is\nreadjusted along the kicked direction. In previous papers we showed that when\nthe evolution of the electron beam modulation is treated according to\nrelativistic kinematics, the orientation of the microbunching wavefront in the\nultrarelativistic asymptotic is always perpendicular to the electron beam\nvelocity. There we refrained from using advanced theoretical concepts to\nexplain or analyze the wavefront rotation. For example, we only hinted to the\nrelation of this phenomenon with the concept of Wigner rotation. This more\nabstract view of wavefront rotation underlines its elementary nature. The\nWigner rotation is known as a fundamental effect in elementary particle\nphysics. The composition of non collinear boosts does not result in a simple\nboost but, rather, in a Lorentz transformation involving a boost and a\nrotation, the Wigner rotation. Here we show that during the LCLS experiments, a\nWigner rotation was actually directly recorded for the first time with a\nultrarelativistic, macroscopic object: an ultrarelativistic electron bunch in\nan XFEL modulated at nm-scale of the size of about 10 microns. Here we point\nout the role of Wigner rotation in the analysis and interpretation of\nexperiments with ultrarelativistic, microbunched electron beams in FELs. After\nthe beam splitting experiment at the LCLS it became clear that, in the\nultrarelativistic asymptotic, the projection of the microbunching wave vector\nonto the beam velocity is a Lorentz invariant, similar to the helicity in\nparticle physics.\n", "  This talk gives a brief introduction to open questions in jet physics and QCD\nwhich come to the fore in the high-luminosity regime characterizing the\nupcoming phase of the Large Hadron Collider and future hadron colliders.\n", "  We discuss a reduction of superconducting transition temperature by the\nintersite Coulomb repulsion for the d-wave pairing in cuprates. We compare the\nresults found for the spin-fermion model and the extended Hubbard model. We\nargue that in both the models the d-wave superconducting transition temperature\nis reduced by the Coulomb repulsion of holes in different unit cells. We also\nshow that in the strong correlation limit the s-wave superconductivity cannot\noccur due to the kinematic restriction of no double occupancy in the Hubbard\nsubbands.\n", "  Several years ago, one of us, having noticed that inexperienced scientists\ntend to make largely the same mistakes while writing their first papers, was\ncompelled to write a one-page note summarizing some dos and don'ts intended to\nhelp take care of common problems before they occur. Since these days the\nmajority of research papers are written collaboratively by groups of\nco-authors, we are compelled to extend these recommendations to collaborative\nwriting as we observe groups of co-authors falling into the same traps again\nand again.\n", "  The purpose of the present report was the study and identification of an\nunspecified sample on a work of art by means only of a microscope coupled to a\nRaman spectrometer. The origin of the fragment was unknown. The Raman spectra\non the virgin sample were giving no results because of a deteriorated surface\ntreatment, in spite of the evident blue color identified by microscopic visual\ninspection. The sample fragmentation and the preparation of a KBr pellet\nallowed the distribution of the painting layers of the different components on\na flat substrate reducing surface effects. Selecting the areas of different\ncolor and focusing there it was possible to identify the pigments from their\nRaman spectra locally acquired by selective excitation. Raman spectra were\nassigned by comparison with published databases. It was possible to connect\nCarbon Black and Orange iron oxide, as documented historically, as constituents\nof Azurite preparatory layer Morellone, according to a technique generally\nemployed to allow the use of Azurite blue pigment on frescos, consequently the\nidentification of typology of work of art was deducted and attributed to a\nfresco.\n", "  In this paper, we are analyzing the interactivity time, defined as the\nduration between two consecutive tasks such as sending emails, collecting\nfriends and followers and writing comments in online social networks (OSNs).\nThe distributions of these times are heavy tailed and often described by a\npower-law distribution. However, power-law distributions usually only fit the\nheavy tail of empirical data and ignore the information in the smaller value\nrange. Here, we argue that the durations between writing emails or comments,\nadding friends and receiving followers are likely to follow a lognormal\ndistribution.\n  We discuss the similarities between power-law and lognormal distributions,\nshow that binning of data can deform a lognormal to a power-law distribution\nand propose an explanation for the appearance of lognormal interactivity times.\nThe historical debate of similarities between lognormal and power-law\ndistributions is reviewed by illustrating the resemblance of measurements in\nthis paper with the historical problem of income and city size distributions.\n", "  A simple procedure to derive the transformation of a wavefunction under a\nchange of reference frame is applied to some examples and its relation with the\ntransformation of the Hamilton principal function is studied.\n", "  Cosmological parameter estimation is traditionally performed in the Bayesian\ncontext. By adopting an \"agnostic\" statistical point of view, we show the\ninterest of confronting the Bayesian results to a frequentist approach based on\nprofile-likelihoods. To this purpose, we have developed the Cosmological\nAnalysis with a Minuit Exploration of the Likelihood (\"CAMEL\") software.\nWritten from scratch in pure C++, emphasis was put in building a clean and\ncarefully-designed project where new data and/or cosmological computations can\nbe easily included.\n  CAMEL incorporates the latest cosmological likelihoods and gives access from\nthe very same input file to several estimation methods: (i) A high quality\nMaximum Likelihood Estimate (a.k.a \"best fit\") using MINUIT ; (ii) profile\nlikelihoods, (iii) a new implementation of an Adaptive Metropolis MCMC\nalgorithm that relieves the burden of reconstructing the proposal distribution.\n  We present here those various statistical techniques and roll out a full\nuse-case that can then used as a tutorial. We revisit the $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters determination with the latest Planck data and give results with both\nmethodologies. Furthermore, by comparing the Bayesian and frequentist\napproaches, we discuss a \"likelihood volume effect\" that affects the optical\nreionization depth when analyzing the high multipoles part of the Planck data.\n  The software, used in several Planck data analyzes, is available from\nhttp://camel.in2p3.fr. Using it does not require advanced C++ skills.\n", "  Phytoplankton photosynthesis in most natural waters is often inhibited by\nultraviolet (UV) and intense photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) but\nthe effects on ocean productivity have received little consideration aside from\npolar areas subject to periodic enhanced UV-B due to depletion of stratospheric\nozone. Here we consider responses in the temperate and tropical mid-ocean\nregions typically dominated by picophytoplankton including the prokaryotic\nlineages, $\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\\textit{Synechococcus}$. Spectral\nmodels of photosynthetic response for each lineage were constructed using model\nstrains cultured at different growth irradiances and temperatures. In the\nmodel, inhibition becomes more severe once exposure exceeds a threshold (Emax)\nrelated to repair capacity. Model parameters are presented for\n$\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ adding to those previously presented for\n$\\textit{Synechococcus}$. The models were applied to the estimation of mid-day,\nwater-column photosynthesis based on an atmospheric model of spectral incident\nradiation, satellite-derived spectral water transparency and sea surface\ntemperature. Comparing predictions integrated over the water column including\nversus excluding inhibition, production was 7-28% lower due to inhibition\ndepending on strain and site conditions. Inhibition was consistently greater\nfor $\\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ compared to two strains of\n$\\textit{Synechococcus}$. Considering only the surface mixed layer, production\nwas inhibited 7-73%. Weighted by lineage abundance and daily PAR exposure,\ninhibition of full water column production averages around 20% for the modeled\nregion of the Pacific with two-thirds of the inhibition due to UV. The results\nsuggest more consideration is needed on inhibition effects, especially due to\nUV, which are largely excluded from present models of global phytoplankton\nproduction.\n", "  This thesis is intended in part to summarize and also to contribute to the\nnewest developments in passive linear optics that have resulted, directly or\nindirectly, from the somewhat shocking discovery in 2010 that the BosonSampling\nproblem is likely hard for a classical computer to simulate. In doing so, I\nhope to provide a historic context for the original result, as well as an\noutlook on the future of technology derived from these newer developments. An\nemphasis is made in each section to provide a broader conceptual framework for\nunderstanding the consequences of each result in light of the others. This\nframework is intended to be comprehensible even without a deep understanding of\nthe topics themselves.\n  The first three chapters focus more closely on the BosonSampling result\nitself, seeking to understand the computational complexity aspects of passive\nlinear optical networks, and what consequences this may have. Some effort is\nspent discussing a number of issues inherent in the BosonSampling problem that\nlimit the scope of its applicability, and that are still active topics of\nresearch. Finally, we describe two other linear optical settings that inherit\nthe same complexity as BosonSampling. The final chapters focus on how an\nintuitive understanding of BosonSampling has led to developments in optical\nmetrology and other closely related fields. These developments suggest the\nexciting possibility that quantum sensors may be viable in the next few years\nwith only marginal improvements in technology. Lastly, some open problems are\npresented which are intended to lay out a course for future research that would\nallow for a more complete picture of the scalability of the architecture\ndeveloped in these chapters.\n", "  Within the framework of the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables\nformalism, we study the manifestations of vacuum electromagnetic nonlinearities\nin $D=3$ models. For this we consider both generalized Born-Infeld and\nPagels-Tomboulis-like electrodynamics, as well as, an Euler-Heisenberg-like\nelectrodynamics. We explicitly show that generalized Born-Infeld and\nPagels-Tomboulis-like electrodynamics are equivalent, where the static\npotential profile contains a long-range (${\\raise0.5ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle\n1$}\\kern-0.1em/\\kern-0.15em\\lower0.25ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle {{r^2}}$}}$-type)\ncorrection to the Coulomb potential. Interestingly enough, for an\nEuler-Heisenberg-like electrodynamics the interaction energy contains a linear\npotential, leading to the confinement of static charges.\n", "  Stellar evolution theory has been extraordinarily successful at explaining\nthe different phases under which stars form, evolve and die. While the\nstrongest constraints have traditionally come from binary stars, the advent of\nasteroseismology is bringing unique measures in well-characterised stars. For\nstellar populations in general, however, only photometric measures are usually\navailable, and the comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution theory\nhave mostly been qualitative. For instance, the geometrical shapes of\nisochrones have been used to infer ages of coeval populations, but without any\nproper statistical basis. In this chapter we provide a pedagogical review on a\nBayesian formalism to make quantitative inferences on the properties of single,\nbinary and small ensembles of stars, including unresolved populations. As an\nexample, we show how stellar evolution theory can be used in a rigorous way as\na prior information to measure the ages of stars between the ZAMS and the\nHelium flash, and their uncertainties, using photometric data only.\n", "  Using the narrowband all-sky imager mode of the LWA1 we have now detected 30\ntransients at 25.6 MHz, 1 at 34 MHz, and 93 at 38.0 MHz. While we have only\noptically confirmed that 37 of these events are radio afterglows from meteors,\nevidence suggests that most, if not all, are. Using the beam-forming mode of\nthe LWA1 we have also captured the broadband spectra between 22.0 and 55.0 MHz\nof four events. We compare the smooth, spectral components of these four events\nand fit the frequency dependent flux density to a power law, and find that the\nspectral index is time variable, with the spectrum steepening over time for\neach meteor afterglow. Using these spectral indices along with the narrow band\nflux density measurements of the 123 events at 25.6 and 38 MHz, we predict the\nexpected flux densities and rates for meteor afterglows potentially observable\nby other low frequency radio telescopes.\n", "  The detection of anomalies in gravitational microlensing events is nowadays\none of the main goals among the microlensing community. In the case of\nsingle-lens events, these anomalies can be caused by the finite source effects,\nthat is when the source disk size is not negligible, and by the Earth rotation\naround the Sun (the so-called parallax effect). The finite source and parallax\neffects may help to define the mass of the lens, uniquely. Free-floating\nplanets (FFPs) are extremely dim objects, and gravitational microlensing\nprovides at present the exclusive method to investigate these bodies. In this\nwork, making use of a synthetic population algorithm, we study the possibility\nof detecting the finite source and parallax effects in simulated microlensing\nevents caused by FFPs towards the Galactic bulge, taking into consideration the\ncapabilities of the space-based Euclid telescope. We find a significant\nefficiency for detecting the parallax effect in microlensing events with\ndetectable finite source effect, that turns out to be about 51% for mass\nfunction index .\n", "  Originally developed to image the shadow region of the central black hole in\nSagittarius A* and in the nearby galaxy M87, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\nprovides deep, very high angular resolution data on other AGN sources too. The\nchallenges of working with EHT data have spurred the development of new image\nreconstruction algorithms. This work briefly reviews the status of the EHT and\nits utility for observing AGN sources, with emphasis on novel imaging\ntechniques that offer the promise of better reconstructions at 1.3 mm and other\nwavelengths.\n", "  Graphene, as a semimetal with the largest known thermal conductivity, is an\nideal system to study the interplay between electronic and lattice\ncontributions to thermal transport. While the total electrical and thermal\nconductivity have been extensively investigated, a detailed first-principles\nstudy of its electronic thermal conductivity is still missing. Here, we first\ncharacterize the electron-phonon intrinsic contribution to the electronic\nthermal resistivity of graphene as a function of doping using electronic and\nphonon dispersions and electron-phonon couplings calculated from first\nprinciples at the level of density-functional theory and many-body perturbation\ntheory (GW). Then, we include extrinsic electron-impurity scattering using\nlow-temperature experimental estimates. Under these conditions, we find that\nthe in-plane electronic thermal conductivity of doped graphene is ~300 W/mK at\nroom temperature, independently of doping. This result is much larger than\nexpected, and comparable to the total thermal conductivity of typical metals,\ncontributing ~10 % to the total thermal conductivity of bulk graphene. Notably,\nin samples whose physical or domain sizes are of the order of few micrometers\nor smaller, the relative contribution coming from the electronic thermal\nconductivity is more important than in the bulk limit, since lattice thermal\nconductivity is much more sensitive to sample or grain size at these scales.\nLast, when electron-impurity scattering effects are included, we find that the\nelectronic thermal conductivity is reduced by 30 to 70 %. We also find that the\nWiedemann-Franz law is broadly satisfied at low and high temperatures, but with\nthe largest deviations of 20-50 % around room temperature.\n", "  The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an\nexciting frontier in modern physical science. We use atom-by-atom assembly to\nimplement a novel platform for the deterministic preparation of regular arrays\nof individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a measurement and\nfeedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap\noccupation and results in defect-free arrays of over 50 atoms in less than 400\nms. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers,\nwhich we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain\nthese configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a\nreservoir. This bottom-up approach enables controlled engineering of scalable\nmany-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and\nprecision measurements.\n", "  The relative influence of the capillary, Marangoni, and hydrophobic forces in\nmediating the evaporation of water from carbon foam based porous media, in\nresponse to incident solar radiation, are investigated. It is indicated that\ninducing hydrophilic interactions on the surface, through nitric acid treatment\nof the foams, has a similar effect to reduced pore diameter and the ensuing\ncapillary forces. The efficiency of water evaporation may be parameterized\nthrough the Capillary number (Ca), with a lower Ca being preferred. The\nproposed study is of much relevance to efficient solar energy utilization.\n", "  In many applications, transport of particles can be described by the\ndiffusion equation, or its convective-diffusion generalizations, in part of\nthree-dimensional space. In particular, in surface deposition or in growth of\naggregates or sediments, particles in the suspension outside the surface or\naggregate boundary can be considered as diffusing under the influence of\napplied forces, such as the double-layer interactions or gravity. However, the\ndiffusion equation cannot be used at the substrate or inside the aggregate. One\nconvenient and widely used approach has been to impose boundary conditions at\nthe surface, to supplement and completely define the diffusion problem outside\nit. This short survey describes some theoretical results on the use of such\nboundary conditions and their physical interpretation.\n", "  Random sequential adsorption (RSA) models have been studied due to their\nrelevance to deposition processes on surfaces. The depositing particles are\nrepresented by hard-core extended objects; they are not allowed to overlap.\nNumerical Monte Carlo studies and analytical considerations are reported for 1D\nand 2D models of multilayer adsorption processes. Deposition without screening\nis investigated, in certain models the density may actually increase away from\nthe substrate. Analytical studies of the late stage coverage behavior show the\ncrossover from exponential time dependence for the lattice case to the power\nlaw behavior in the continuum deposition. 2D lattice and continuum simulations\nrule out some \"exact\" conjectures for the jamming coverage. For the deposition\nof dimers on a 1D lattice with diffusional relaxation we find that the limiting\ncoverage (100%) is approached according to the ~1/t**0.5 power-law preceded,\nfor fast diffusion, by the mean-field crossover regime with the intermediate\n~1/t behavior. In case of k-mer deposition (k>3) with diffusion the void\nfraction decreases according to the power-law t**[-1/(k-1)]. In the case of RSA\nof lattice hard squares in 2D with diffusional relaxation the approach to the\nfull coverage is ~t**(-0.5).\n"]}
