This enormous disparity between the expectations\nof two of our most widely accepted theoretical frameworks demands a credible\nand self-consistent explanation, and yet even after decades of sporadic effort\na generally accepted resolution of this crisis has not surfaced. Very recently,\nhowever, a discrete self-similar cosmological paradigm based on the fundamental\nprinciple of discrete scale invariance has been found to offer a rationale for\nreducing the vacuum energy density disparity by at least 115 orders of\nmagnitude, and possibly this new paradigm offers a means of eliminating the\nvacuum energy density crisis entirely.\n", "  Discrete Scale Relativity proposes a new symmetry principle called discrete\ncosmological self-similarity which relates each class of systems and phenomena\non a given Scale of nature's discrete cosmological hierarchy to the equivalent\nclass of analogue systems and phenomena on any other Scale. The new symmetry\nprinciple can be understood in terms of discrete scale invariance involving the\nspatial, temporal and dynamic parameters of all systems and phenomena. This new\nparadigm predicts a rigorous discrete self-similarity between Stellar Scale\nvariable stars and Atomic Scale excited atoms undergoing energy-level\ntransitions and sub-threshold oscillations. Previously, methods for\ndemonstrating and testing the proposed symmetry principle have been applied to\nRR Lyrae, Delta Scuti and ZZ Ceti variable stars. In the present paper we apply\nthe same analytical methods and diagnostic tests to a new class of variable\nstars: SX Phoenicis variables. Double-mode pulsators are shown to provide an\nespecially useful means of testing the uniqueness and rigor of the conceptual\nprinciples and discrete self-similar scaling of Discrete Scale Relativity.\n", "  The paradigmatic transition from a small finite universe to an infinite\nunbounded fractal cosmos is briefly put into historical context and discussed.\n", "  The planets magnetic field has been explained based on the dynamo theory,\nwhich presents as many difficulties in mathematical terms as well as in\npredictions. It proves to be extremely difficult to calculate the dipolar\nmagnetic moment of the extrasolar planets using the dynamo theory. The aim is\nto find an empirical relationship (justifying using first principles) between\nthe planetary magnetic moment, the mass of the planet, its rotation period and\nthe electrical conductivity of its most conductive layer. Then this is applied\nto Hot Jupiters. Using all the magnetic planetary bodies of the solar system\nand tracing a graph of the dipolar magnetic moment versus body mass parameter,\nthe rotation period and electrical conductivity of the internal conductive\nlayer is obtained. An empirical, functional relation was constructed, which was\nadjusted to a power law curve in order to fit the data. Once this empirical\nrelation has been defined, it is theoretically justified and applied to the\ncalculation of the dipolar magnetic moment of the extra solar planets known as\nHot Jupiters. Almost all data calculated is interpolated, bestowing confidence\nin terms of their validity. The value for the dipolar magnetic moment, obtained\nfor the exoplanet Osiris (HD209458b), helps understand the way in which the\natmosphere of a planet with an intense magnetic field can be eroded by stellar\nwind. The relationship observed also helps understand why Venus and Mars do not\npresent any magnetic field.\n", "  We study systems of identical coupled oscillators introducing a distribution\nof delay times in the coupling. For arbitrary network topologies, we show that\nthe frequency and stability of the fully synchronized states depend only on the\nmean of the delay distribution. However, synchronization dynamics is sensitive\nto the shape of the distribution. In the presence of coupling delays, the\nsynchronization rate can be maximal for a specific value of the coupling\nstrength.\n", "  Angular correlations between charged trigger and associated particles are\nmeasured by the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon\ncentre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV for transverse momentum ranges within 0.5 <\n$p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm assoc}$ < $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$ < 4 GeV/$c$. The correlations\nare measured over two units of pseudorapidity and full azimuthal angle in\ndifferent intervals of event multiplicity, and expressed as associated yield\nper trigger particle. Two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near\nside and one on the away side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained\nin low-multiplicity events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity\nevents. The excess on the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently\nreported by the CMS collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is\nreported for the first time. The two-ridge structure projected onto azimuthal\nangle is quantified with the second and third Fourier coefficients as well as\nby near-side and away-side yields and widths. The yields on the near side and\non the away side are equal within the uncertainties for all studied event\nmultiplicity and $p_{\\rm T}$ bins, and the widths show no significant evolution\nwith event multiplicity or $p_{\\rm T}$. These findings suggest that the\nnear-side ridge is accompanied by an essentially identical away-side ridge.\n", "  I argue that European schools of thought on memory and memorization were\ncritical in enabling the growth of the scientific method. After giving a\nhistorical overview of the development of the memory arts from ancient Greece\nthrough 17th century Europe, I describe how the Baconian viewpoint on the\nscientific method was fundamentally part of a culture and a broader dialogue\nthat conceived of memorization as a foundational methodology for structuring\nknowledge and for developing symbolic means for representing scientific\nconcepts. The principal figures of this intense and rapidly evolving\nintellectual milieu included some of the leading thinkers traditionally\nassociated with the scientific revolution; among others, Francis Bacon, Renes\nDescartes, and Gottfried Leibniz. I close by examining the acceleration of\nmathematical thought in light of the art of memory and its role in 17th century\nphilosophy, and in particular, Leibniz' project to develop a universal\ncalculus.\n", "  We examine the basic assumptions in the original setup of the firewall\nparadox. The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is\nmaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with\nthe modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never\nhappens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that\nwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode\nlocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and\nblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for\nthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the\ngeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of\nHawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the\nstate of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black\nhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole\nages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from\nthe black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary\nto explain this result. We propose an infrared mechanism called {\\it icezone}\nthat is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any event\nhorizon to entangle states separated by long distances. These interactions at\nfirst provide small corrections to the thermal Hawking radiation. At the end of\nevaporation however the effect of interactions is as large as the Hawking\nradiation and information is recovered for an outside observer. We verify this\nin an explicit construction and calculation of the density matrix of a spin\nmodel.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the electronic structure of graphene and boron\nnitride (BN) lateral heterostructures, which were fabricated in recent\nexperiments. The first-principles density functional calculation demonstrates\nthat a huge intrinsic transverse electric field can be induced in the graphene\nnanoribbon region, and depends sensitively on the edge configuration of the\nlateral heterostructure. The polarized electric field originates from the\ncharge mismatch at the BN-graphene interfaces. This huge electric field can\nopen a significant bang gap in graphene nanoribbon, and lead to fully\nspinpolarized edge states and induce half-metallic phase in the lateral\nBN/Graphene/BN heterostructure with proper edge configurations.\n", "  The nonperturbative probability of pair production in electric fields\ndepending on lightfront time is given exactly by the locally constant\napproximation. We explain this by showing that the worldline path integral\ndefining the effective action contains a constraint, which localises\ncontributing paths on hypersurfaces of constant lightfront time. These paths\nare lightfront zero-modes and there can be no pair production without them; the\neffective action vanishes if they are projected out.\n", "  The Balitskii-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) multi-Pomeron model of Levin and\nRezaeian, with extension to the gluon saturation region, is applied to\nlong-range pseudorapidity correlations on relative azimuth for low momentum\nfinal-state hadrons produced in $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200~GeV and 7~TeV p+p collisions.\nThe multi-Pomeron exchange probabilities in the model were estimated by fitting\nthe minimum-bias p+p multiplicity frequency distributions. The multi-Pomeron\nmodel prediction for the amplitude of the minimum-bias average quadrupole\ncorrelation, proportional to $\\cos 2(\\phi_1 - \\phi_2)$, is consistent with the\n200~GeV data when theoretically expected gluon saturation momentum scales are\nused. Correlation predictions for the high multiplicity 7~TeV p+p collision\ndata are also consistent with the long-range pseudorapidity correlations at\nsmall relative azimuth observed in the data. The results presented here show\nthat the present application of a multiple parton-shower, gluon interference\nmechanism for generating the long-range pseudorapidity, azimuthal quadrupole\ncorrelation is not excluded by the data.\n", "  Several classes of directed acyclic graphs have been investigated in the last\ntwo decades, in the context of the Causal Set Program, in search for good\ndiscrete models of spacetime. We introduce some statistical indicators that can\nbe used for comparing these graphs and for assessing their closeness to the\nideal Lorentzian causal sets ('causets') -- those obtained by sprinkling points\nin a Lorentzian manifold. In particular, with the reversed triangular\ninequality of Special Relativity in mind, we introduce 'longest/shortest path\nplots', an easily implemented tool to visually detect the extent to which a\ngeneric causet matches the wide range of path lengths between events of\nLorentzian causets. This tool can attribute some degree of 'Lorentzianity' - in\nparticular 'non-locality' - also to causets that are not (directly) embeddable\nand that, due to some regularity in their structure, would not pass the key\ntest for Lorentz invariance: the absence of preferred reference frames. We\ncompare the discussed indicators and use them for assessing causets both of\nstochastic and of deterministic, algorithmic origin, finding examples of the\nlatter that behave optimally w.r.t. our longest/shortest path plots.\n", "  The strongest interaction between microscopic spins in magnetic materials is\nthe exchange interaction $J_\\text{ex}$. Therefore, ultrafast control of\n$J_\\text{ex}$ holds the promise to control spins on ultimately fast timescales.\nWe demonstrate that time-periodic modulation of the electronic structure by\nelectric fields can be used to reversibly control $J_\\text{ex}$ on ultrafast\ntimescales in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators. In the regime of weak\ndriving strength, we find that $J_\\text{ex}$ can be enhanced and reduced for\nfrequencies below and above the Mott gap, respectively. Moreover, for strong\ndriving strength, even the sign of $J_\\text{ex}$ can be reversed and we show\nthat this causes time reversal of the associated quantum spin dynamics. These\nresults suggest wide applications, not only to control magnetism in condensed\nmatter systems, for example, via the excitation of spin resonances, but also to\nassess fundamental questions concerning the reversibility of the quantum\nmany-body dynamics in cold atom systems.\n", "  We investigate the invariants of the $25$-dimensional real representation of\nthe group ${\\bf SO}(3)\\wr{\\bf Z}_2$ given by the left and right actions of\n${\\bf SO}(3)$ on $5\\times 5$ matrices together with matrix transposition; the\naction on column vectors is the irreducible $5$-dimensional representation of\n${\\bf SO}(3)$. The $25$-dimensional representation arises naturally in the\nstudy of nematic liquid crystals, where the second-rank orientational order\nparameters of a molecule are represented by a symmetric $3\\times3$ traceless\nsymmetric matrix, and where a rigid rotation in ${\\bf R}^3$ induces a linear\ntransformation of this space of matrices. The entropy contribution to a free\nenergy density function in this context turns out to have ${\\bf SO}(3)\\wr{\\bf\nZ}_2$ symmetry. Although it is unrealistic to expect to describe the complete\nalgebraic structure of the ring of invariants, we are able to calculate the\nMolien series giving the number of linearly independent invariants at each\nhomogeneous degree, and to express this as a rational function indicating the\ndegrees of invariant polynomials that constitute a basis of 19 primary\ninvariants. The algebra of invariants up to degree 4 is investigated in detail.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the statistical properties of\nmillimeter-size spheres floating on the surface of a turbulent flow. The flow\nis generated in a layer of liquid metal by an electromagnetic forcing. By using\ntwo magnet arrays, we are able to create one highly fluctuating flow and\nanother, more stationary flow. In both cases, we follow the motion of hundreds\nof particles floating at the deformed interface of the liquid metal. We\nevidence the clustering of floaters by a statistical study of the local\nconcentration of particles. Some dynamical properties of clusters are exposed.\nWe perform spatial correlations between particle concentration and\nhydrodynamical quantities linked with inertial effects; with vortical motion,\nand with horizontal divergence (corresponding to compressibility in the\nsurface). From comparing these correlations, we propose the so-called surface\ncompressibility as the main clustering mechanism in our system. Hence, although\nfloaters are not passive scalar and move on a deformed surface, the scenario is\nsimilar to the one reported for passive scalar on an almost flat free surface\nof a turbulent flow.\n", "  By demanding the validity of an effective field theory description during\ninflation, in this note we derive some peculiar inequalities among the three\ninteresting stringy and cosmological parameters, namely the tensor-to-scalar\nratio ($r$), the string coupling ($g_s$) and the compactification volume\n(${\\cal V}$). In deriving these inequalities, we explicitly demand that the\ninflationary scale and the Hubble parameter during inflation are well below the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale, string scale, and the four dimensional Planck\nmass. For the inflationary models developed within the framework of type IIB\norientifold comapctification, we investigate the regions of parameters space\nspanned by the three parameters $(r, g_s, {\\cal V})$ by satisfying our\ninequalities, and we find that the same can reduce the size of available\nparameter space quite significantly. Moreover, we comment on obtaining further\nconstraints on the parameters by comparing gravitino mass ($m_{3/2}$) with the\nHubble scale ($H$), which also provides a lower bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio\n($r$), for the cases when $m_{3/2} <H$. We also illustrate the outcome of our\nbounds in some specific class of string(-inspired) models.\n", "  The commonest method of characterizing a cold field electron emitter is to\nmeasure its current-voltage characteristics, and the commonest method of\nanalysing these characteristics is by means of a Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot.\nThis tutorial/review-type paper outlines a more systematic method of setting\nout the Fowler-Nordheim-type theory of cold field electron emission, and brings\ntogether and summarises the current state of work by the authors on developing\nthe theory and methodology of FN plot analysis. This has turned out to be far\nmore complicated than originally expected. Emphasis is placed in this paper on:\n(a) the interpretation of FN-plot slopes, which is currently both easier and of\nmore experimental interest than the analysis of FN-plot intercepts; and (b)\npreliminary explorations into developing methodology for interpreting\ncurrent-voltage characteristics when there is series resistance in the\nconduction path from the high-voltage generator to the emitter's emitting\nregions. This work reinforces our view that FN-plot analysis is best carried\nout on the raw measured current-voltage data, without pre-conversion into\nanother data format, particularly if series resistance is present in the\nmeasuring circuit. Relevant formulae are given for extracting\nfield-enhancement-factor values from such an analysis.\n", "  We consider a quantum mechanical three-particle system made of two identical\nfermions of mass one and a different particle of mass $ m $, where each fermion\ninteracts via a zero-range force with the different particle. In particular we\nstudy the unitary regime, i.e., the case of infinite two-body scattering\nlength. The Hamiltonians describing the system are, by definition, self-adjoint\nextensions of the free Hamiltonian restricted on smooth functions vanishing at\nthe two-body coincidence planes, i.e., where the positions of two interacting\nparticles coincide. It is known that for $ m $ larger than a critical value $\nm^* \\simeq (13.607)^{-1} $ a self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonian $ H_0 $\ncan be constructed, whose domain is characterized in terms of the standard\npoint-interaction boundary condition at each coincidence plane. Here we prove\nthat for $ m \\in( m^*,m^{**}) $, where $ m^{**} \\simeq (8.62)^{-1} $, there is\na further family of self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians $ H_{0,\\beta}\n$, $ \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R} $, describing the system. Using a quadratic form\nmethod, we give a rigorous construction of such Hamiltonians and we show that\nthe elements of their domains satisfy a further boundary condition,\ncharacterizing the singular behavior when the positions of all the three\nparticles coincide.\n", "  In this article, we revisit the century-old question of the minimal set of\nobservables needed to identify a quantum state: here, we replace the natural\ncoincidences in their spectra by effective ones, induced by an imperfect\nmeasurement. We show that if the detection error is smaller than the mean level\nspacing, then two observables with Poisson spectra will suffice, no matter how\nlarge the system is. The primary target of our findings is the integrable (i.e.\nexactly solvable) quantum systems whose spectra do obey the Poisson statistics.\nWe also consider the implications of our findings for classical pattern\nrecognition techniques.\n", "  The concept of non-Markovianity (NM) in quantum dynamics is still an open\ndebate. Understanding how to generate and measure NM in specific models may aid\nin this quest. In quantum optics, an engineered electromagnetic environment\ncoupled to a single atom can induce NM. The most common scenario of structured\nelectromagnetic environment is an optical cavity, composed by a pair of\nmirrors. Here, we show how to generate and measure NM on a two-level system\ncoupled to a one-dimensional waveguide with no mirrors required. The origin of\nthe non-Markovian behavior lies in the initial state of the field, prepared as\na single-photon packet. We analyze how NM depends on two experimentally\ncontrollable parameters, namely, the linewidth of the packet and its central\nfrequency. We relate the presence of NM to a $\\pi$-phase shift between incoming\nand emitted fields. We also show how the two output channels of the waveguide\nprovide distinct signatures of NM, both experimentally accessible.\n", "  Strongly correlated materials with strong spin-orbit coupling hold promise\nfor realizing topological phases with fractionalized excitations. Here we\npropose a chiral spin-orbital liquid as a stable phase of a realistic model for\nheavy-element double perovskites. This spin liquid state has Majorana fermion\nexcitations with a gapless spectrum characterized by nodal lines along the\nedges of the Brillouin zone. We show that the nodal lines are topological\ndefects of a non-Abelian Berry connection and that the system exhibits\ndispersing surface states. We discuss some experimental signatures of this\nstate and compare them with properties of the spin liquid candidate Ba_2YMoO_6.\n", "  We examine mixedness and entanglement of the chronology-respecting (CR)\nsystem with assuming that quantum mechanical closed timelike curves (CTCs)\nexist in nature and by introducing the qubit system and applying the general\ncontrolled operations between CR and CTC systems. We use the magnitude of Bloch\nvector as a measure of mixedness. While Deutschian-CTC (D-CTC) either preserves\nor decreases the magnitude, postselected-CTC (P-CTC) can increases it.\nNonintuitively, even the completely mixed CR-qubit can be converted into a pure\nstate after CTC-qubit travels around the P-CTC. It is also shown that while\nD-CTC cannot increase the entanglement of CR system, P-CTC can increase it.\nSurprisingly, any partially entangled state can be maximally entangled pure\nstate if P-CTC exists. Thus, distillation of P-CTC-assisted entanglement can be\neasily achieved without preparing the multiple copies of the partially\nentangled state.\n", "  Unlike the Wilson line in QED the Wilson line in QCD contains path ordering.\nIn this paper we get rid of the path ordering in the light-like Wilson line in\nQCD by simplifying all the infinite number of non-commuting terms in the SU(3)\npure gauge. We prove that the light-like Wilson line in QCD naturally emerges\nwhen path integral formulation of QCD is used to prove factorization of soft\nand collinear divergences at all order in coupling constant in QCD processes at\nhigh energy colliders.\n", "  We present visible spectroscopic and albedo data of the 2.3 Gyr old Themis\nfamily and the <10 Myr old Beagle sub-family. The slope and albedo variations\nbetween these two families indicate C-complex asteroids become redder and\ndarker in response to space weathering. Our observations of Themis family\nmembers confirm previously observed trends where phyllosilicate absorption\nfeatures are less common among small diameter objects. Similar trends in the\nalbedos of large (> 15 km) and small (< 15 km) Themis members suggest these\nphyllosilicate feature and albedo trends result from regolith variations as a\nfunction of diameter. Observations of the Beagle asteroids show a small, but\nnotable fraction of members with phyllosilicate features. The presence of\nphyllosilicates and the dynamical association of the main-belt comet\n133P/Elst-Pizarro with the Beagle family imply the Beagle parent body was a\nheterogenous mixture of ice and aqueously altered minerals.\n", "  Recently, there have been claims in the literature that the cosmological\nconstant problem can be dynamically solved by specific compactifications of\ngravity from higher-dimensional toy models. These models have the novel feature\nthat in the four-dimensional theory, the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is\nmuch smaller than the Planck density and in fact accumulates at $\\Lambda=0$.\nHere we show that while these are very interesting models, they do not properly\naddress the real cosmological constant problem. As we explain, the real problem\nis not simply to obtain $\\Lambda$ that is small in Planck units in a toy model,\nbut to explain why $\\Lambda$ is much smaller than other mass scales (and\ncombinations of scales) in the theory. Instead, in these toy models, all other\nparticle mass scales have been either removed or sent to zero, thus ignoring\nthe real problem. To this end, we provide a general argument that the included\nmoduli masses are generically of order Hubble, so sending them to zero\ntrivially sends the cosmological constant to zero. We also show that the\nfundamental Planck mass is being sent to zero, and so the central problem is\ntrivially avoided by removing high energy physics altogether. On the other\nhand, by including various large mass scales from particle physics with a high\nfundamental Planck mass, one is faced with a real problem, whose only known\nsolution involves accidental cancellations in a landscape.\n", "  The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) formalism is extended by including the\nsingle-particle continuum in order to analyse the evolution of pairing in an\nisotopic chain from stability up to the drip line. We propose a continuum\ndiscretized generalized BCS based on single-particle pseudostates (PS). These\nPS are generated from the diagonalization of the single-particle Hamiltonian\nwithin a Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) basis. The consistency of the\nresults versus the size of the basis is studied. The method is applied to\nneutron rich Oxygen and Carbon isotopes and compared with similar previous\nworks and available experimental data. We make use of the flexibility of the\nproposed model in order to study the evolution of the occupation of the\nlow-energy continuum when the system becomes weakly bound. We find a larger\ninfluence of the non-resonant continuum as long as the Fermi level approaches\nzero.\n", "  The interaction of the nonlinear internal waves with a nonuniform current\nwith a specific form, characteristic for the equatorial undercurrent, is\nstudied. The current has no vorticity in the layer, where the internal wave\nmotion takes place. We show that the nonzero vorticity that might be occuring\nin other layers of the current does not affect the wave motion. The equations\nof motion are formulated as a Hamiltonian system.\n", "  Substantial evidence points to dusty, geometrically thick tori obscuring the\ncentral engines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but so far no mechanism\nsatisfactorily explains why cool dust in the torus remains in a puffy geometry.\nNear-Eddington infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities coupled with\nhigh dust opacities at these frequencies suggest that radiation pressure on\ndust can play a significant role in shaping the torus. To explore the possible\neffects of radiation pressure, we perform three-dimensional radiative\nhydrodynamics simulations of an initially smooth torus. Our code solves the\nhydrodynamics equations, the time-dependent multi-angle group IR radiative\ntransfer (RT) equation, and the time-independent UV RT equation. We find a\nhighly dynamic situation. IR radiation is anisotropic, leaving primarily\nthrough the central hole. The torus inner surface exhibits a break in\naxisymmetry under the influence of radiation and differential rotation;\nclumping follows. In addition, UV radiation pressure on dust launches a strong\nwind along the inner surface; when scaled to realistic AGN parameters, this\noutflow travels at $\\sim 5000 (M/10^7 M_\\odot)^{1/4} [L_\\mathrm{UV}/(0.1\nL_\\mathrm E)]^{1/4} \\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm s^{-1}$ and carries $\\sim 0.1 (M/10^7\nM_\\odot)^{3/4} [L_\\mathrm{UV}/(0.1 L_\\mathrm E)]^{3/4}\nM_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, where $M$, $L_\\mathrm{UV}$, and $L_\\mathrm E$ are\nthe mass, UV luminosity, and Eddington luminosity of the central object\nrespectively.\n", "  For more than 100 years, one of the central concepts in statistical mechanics\nhas been the microcanonical ensemble, which provides a way of calculating the\nthermodynamic entropy for a specified energy. A controversy has recently\nemerged between two distinct definitions of the entropy based on the\nmicrocanonical ensemble: (1) The Boltzmann entropy, defined by the density of\nstates at a specified energy, and (2) The Gibbs entropy, defined by the sum or\nintegral of the density of states below a specified energy. A critical\ndifference between the consequences of these definitions pertains to the\nconcept of negative temperatures, which by the Gibbs definition, cannot exist.\nIn this paper, we call into question the fundamental assumption that the\nmicrocanonical ensemble should be used to define the entropy. Our argument is\nbased on a recently proposed canonical definition of the entropy as a function\nof energy. We investigate the predictions of the Boltzmann, Gibbs, and\ncanonical definitions for a variety of classical and quantum models, including\nmodels which exhibit a first-order phase transition. Our results support the\nvalidity of the concept of negative temperature, but not for all models with a\ndecreasing density of states. We find that only the canonical entropy\nconsistently predicts the correct thermodynamic properties, while\nmicrocanonical definitions of entropy, including those of Boltzmann and Gibbs,\nare correct only for a limited set of simple models.\n", "  The pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal from galaxy clusters\nis a probe of their line-of-sight momenta, and thus a potentially valuable\nsource of cosmological information. In addition to the momenta, the amplitude\nof the measured signal depends on the properties of the intra-cluster gas and\nobservational limitations such as errors in determining cluster centers and\nredshifts. In this work we simulate the pairwise kSZ signal of clusters at z<1,\nusing the output from a cosmological N-body simulation and including the\nproperties of the intra-cluster gas via a model that can be varied in\npost-processing. We find that modifications to the gas profile due to star\nformation and feedback reduce the pairwise kSZ amplitude of clusters by ~50%,\nrelative to the naive 'gas traces mass' assumption. We demonstrate that\nmis-centering can reduce the overall amplitude of the pairwise kSZ signal by up\nto 10%, while redshift errors can lead to an almost complete suppression of the\nsignal at small separations. We confirm that a high-significance detection is\nexpected from the combination of data from current-generation, high-resolution\nCMB experiments, such as the South Pole Telescope, and cluster samples from\noptical photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey. Furthermore, we\nforecast that future experiments such as Advanced ACTPol in conjunction with\ndata from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument will yield detection\nsignificances of at least 20{\\sigma}, and up to 57{\\sigma} in an optimistic\nscenario. Our simulated maps are publicly available at:\nhttp://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/ksz.html\n", "  We present and discuss the design details of an extensible, modular, open\nsource software framework called EXOSIMS, which creates end-to-end simulations\nof space-based exoplanet imaging missions. We motivate the development and\nbaseline implementation of the component parts of this software with models of\nthe WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph, and present initial results of mission simulations\nfor various iterations of the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph design. We present and\ndiscuss two sets of simulations: The first compares the science yield of\ncompletely different instruments in the form of early competing coronagraph\ndesigns for WFIRST-AFTA. The second set of simulations evaluates the effects of\ndifferent operating assumptions, specifically the assumed post-processing\ncapabilities and telescope vibration levels. We discuss how these results can\nguide further instrument development and the expected evolution of science\nyields.\n", "  We discuss two classes of non-supersymmetric interpolating solutions in N=2,\nD=4 gauged supergravity, that flow from either a z=2 Lifshitz geometry or a\nconformal AdS background to the near-horizon geometry of a Nernst brane. We\nobtain these solutions by constructing a z=2 supersymmetric Lifshitz solution\nin the STU model from a first-order rewriting of the action, then lifting it up\nto a five-dimensional background and subsequently modifying this\nfive-dimensional solution by a two-parameter family of deformations. Under\nreduction, these give four-dimensional non-supersymmetric Nernst brane\nsolutions. This is a step towards resolving the Lifshitz tidal force\nsingularity in the context of N=2 gauged supergravity and suggests an approach\nto encoding the Nernst brane in terms of the Schroedinger symmetry group of the\nholographically dual field theory.\n", "  We have obtained new estimates of the Sun's distance from the symmetry plane\nZo and the vertical disk scale height h using currently available data on\nstellar OB associations, Wolf-Rayet stars, HII regions, and Cepheids. Based on\nindividual determinations, we have calculated the mean Zo=-16+/-2 pc. Based on\nthe model of a self-gravitating isothermal disk for the density distribution,\nwe have found the following vertical disk scale heights: h = 40.2+/-2.1 pc from\nOB associations, h = 47.8+/-3.9 pc from Wolf-Rayet stars, h=48.4+/-2.5 pc from\nHII regions, and h = 66.2+/-1.6 pc from Cepheids. We have estimated the\nsurface, \\sum=6 kpc^{-2}, and volume, D(Zo) = 50.6 kpc^{-3}, densities from a\nsample of OB associations. We have found that there could be approximately 5000\nOB associations in the Galaxy.\n", "  In this paper we will present in more detail a construction using Wilson\nlines and the corresponding dual Galilean conformal field theory calculations\nfor analytically determining holographic entanglement entropy for flat space in\n$2+1$ dimensions first presented in hep-th/1410.4089. In addition we will show\nhow the construction using Wilson lines can be expanded to flat space\nhigher-spin theories and determine the thermal entropy of (spin-3 charged) flat\nspace cosmologies using this approach.\n", "  We study how one-particle correlations transfer to manifest as two-particle\ncorrelations in the context of parametric down-conversion (PDC), a process in\nwhich a pump photon is annihilated to produce two entangled photons. We work in\nthe polarization degree of freedom and show that for any two-qubit generation\nprocess that is both trace-preserving and entropy-nondecreasing, the\nconcurrence $C(\\rho)$ of the generated two-qubit state $\\rho$ follows an\nintrinsic upper bound with $C(\\rho)\\leq (1+P)/2$, where $P$ is the degree of\npolarization of the pump photon. We also find that for the class of two qubit\nstates that is restricted to have only two non-zero diagonal elements such that\nthe effective dimensionality of the two-qubit state is same as the\ndimensionality of the pump polarization state, the upper bound on concurrence\nis the degree of polarization itself, that is, $C(\\rho)\\leq P$. Our work shows\nthat the maximum manifestation of two-particle correlations as entanglement is\ndictated by one-particle correlations. The formalism developed in this work can\nbe extended to include multi-particle systems and can thus have important\nimplications towards deducing the upper bounds on multi-particle entanglement,\nfor which no universally accepted measure exists.\n", "  Single eukaryotic cells commonly sense and follow chemical gradients,\nperforming chemotaxis. Recent experiments and theories, however, show that even\nwhen single cells do not chemotax, clusters of cells may, if their interactions\nare regulated by the chemoattractant. We study this general mechanism of\n\"collective guidance\" computationally with models that integrate stochastic\ndynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells, and\ndiffusion of chemical signals between the cells. We show that if clusters of\ncells use the well-known local excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) mechanism\nto sense chemoattractant gradients, the speed of the cell cluster becomes\nnon-monotonic in the cluster's size - clusters either larger or smaller than an\noptimal size will have lower speed. We argue that the cell cluster speed is a\ncrucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both\namplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a\nfunction of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier\ntheories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts\nand strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,\nand the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.\nchemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.\nHowever, new behaviors, such as cluster rotation, may also appear in this case.\nTogether, the combination of co-attraction and adaptation allows for collective\nguidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not\nrequiring strong cell-cell adhesion.\n", "  This paper presents a dynamic model to study the impact on the economic\noutcomes in different societies during the Malthusian Era of individualism\n(time spent working alone) and collectivism (complementary time spent working\nwith others). The model is driven by opposing forces: a greater degree of\ncollectivism provides a higher safety net for low quality workers but a greater\ndegree of individualism allows high quality workers to leave larger bequests.\nThe model suggests that more individualistic societies display smaller\npopulations, greater per capita income and greater income inequality. Some\n(limited) historical evidence is consistent with these predictions.\n", "  In 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer (OT), Alice inputs numbers x_0, x_1, Bob\ninputs a bit b and outputs x_b. Secure OT requires that Alice and Bob learn\nnothing about b and x_{\\bar{b}}, respectively. We define spacetime-constrained\noblivious transfer (SCOT) as OT in Minkowski spacetime in which Bob must output\nx_b within R_b, where R_0 and R_1 are fixed spacelike separated spacetime\nregions. We show that unconditionally secure SCOT is impossible with classical\nprotocols in Minkowski (or Galilean) spacetime, or with quantum protocols in\nGalilean spacetime. We describe a quantum SCOT protocol in Minkowski spacetime,\nand we show it unconditionally secure.\n", "  We report a robust technique for laser frequency stabilisation that enables\nthe reproducible loading of in excess of 10$^{9}$ Yb atoms from a Zeeman slower\ndirectly into a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^{1}S_{0}\n\\rightarrow \\, ^{3}P_{1}$ transition, without the need for a first stage MOT on\nthe $^{1}S_{0} \\rightarrow \\, ^{1}P_{1}$ transition. We use a simple atomic\nbeam apparatus to generate narrow fluorescence signals on both the 399 nm\n$^{1}S_{0} \\rightarrow \\, ^{1}P_{1}$ transition used for the Zeeman slower and\nthe 556 nm $^{1}S_{0} \\rightarrow \\, ^{3}P_{1}$ transition. We present in\ndetail the methods for obtaining spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio and\ndemonstrate error signals suitable for robust frequency stabilisation. Finally\nwe demonstrate the stability and precision of our technique through sensitive\nmeasurements of the gravitational sag of the Yb MOT as a function of the\nintensity of the laser cooling beams, which are in good agreement with theory.\nThese results will be important for efficient loading of the atoms into an\noptical dipole trap.\n", "  Black hole dynamical instabilities have been mostly studied in specific\nmodels. We here study the general properties of the complex-frequency modes\nresponsible for such instabilities, guided by the example of a charged scalar\nfield in an electrostatic potential. We show that these modes are square\nintegrable, have a vanishing conserved norm, and appear in mode doublets or\nquartets. We also study how they appear in the spectrum and how their complex\nfrequencies subsequently evolve when varying some external parameter. When\nworking on an infinite domain, they appear from the reservoir of quasi-normal\nmodes obeying outgoing boundary conditions. This is illustrated by\ngeneralizing, in a non-positive definite Krein space, a solvable model\n(Friedrichs model) which originally describes the appearance of a resonance\nwhen coupling an isolated system to a mode continuum. In a finite spatial\ndomain instead, they arise from the fusion of two real frequency modes with\nopposite norms, through a process that closely resembles avoided crossing.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics following a global parameter quench for two 1D\nmodels with variable-range power-law interactions: a long-range transverse\nIsing model, which has recently been realised in chains of trapped ions, and a\nlong-range lattice model for spinless fermions with long-range tunnelling. For\nthe transverse Ising model, the spreading of correlations and growth of\nentanglement are computed using numerical matrix product state techniques, and\nare compared with exact solutions for the fermionic tunnelling model. We\nidentify transitions between regimes with and without an apparent linear light\ncone for correlations, which correspond closely between the two models. For\nlong-range interactions (in terms of separation distance r, decaying slower\nthan 1/r), we find that despite the lack of a light-cone, correlations grow\nslowly as a power law at short times, and that -- depending on the structure of\nthe initial state -- the growth of entanglement can also be sublinear. These\nresults are understood through analytical calculations, and should be\nmeasurable in experiments with trapped ions.\n", "  We present a new open source code for massive parallel computation of Voronoi\ntessellations(VT hereafter) in large data sets. The code is focused for\nastrophysical purposes where VT densities and neighbors are widely used. There\nare several serial Voronoi tessellation codes, however no open source and\nparallel implementations are available to handle the large number of\nparticles/galaxies in current N-body simulations and sky surveys.\nParallelization is implemented under MPI and VT using Qhull library. Domain\ndecomposition takes into account consistent boundary computation between tasks,\nand includes periodic conditions. In addition, the code computes neighbors\nlist, Voronoi density, Voronoi cell volume, density gradient for each particle,\nand densities on a regular grid.\n", "  We present a surprisingly simple three-dimensional Bloch sphere\nrepresentation of a qutrit, i.e., a single three-level quantum system. We start\nwith a symmetric state of a two-qubit system and relate it to the spin-1\nrepresentation. Using this representation we associate each qutrit state with a\nthree-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{a}$ and a metric tensor $\\mathbf{\\hat\\Gamma}$\nwhich satisfy $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat\\Gamma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\leq 1$.\nThis resembles the well known condition for qubit Bloch vectors in which case\n$\\mathbf{\\hat\\Gamma}=\\hat{I}$. In our case the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ corresponds\nto spin-1 polarisation, whereas the tensor $\\mathbf{\\hat\\Gamma}$ is a function\nof polarisation uncertainties. Alternatively, $\\mathbf{a}$ is a local Bloch\nvector of a symmetric two-qubit state and $\\mathbf{\\hat\\Gamma}$ is a function\nof the corresponding correlation tensor. We also discuss how a purity of states\nand state-dynamics is depicted in our representation.\n", "  The spin-3/2 Ising model, with nearest-neighbor interactions only, is the\nprototypical system with two different ordering species, with concentrations\nregulated by a chemical potential. Its global phase diagram, obtained in d=3 by\nrenormalization-group theory in the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation or\nequivalently as an exact solution of a d=3 hierarchical lattice, with flows\nsubtended by 40 different fixed points, presents a very rich structure\ncontaining eight different ordered and disordered phases, with more than\nfourteen different types of phase diagrams in temperature and chemical\npotential. It exhibits phases with orientational and/or positional order. It\nalso exhibits quintuple phase transition reentrances. Universality of critical\nexponents is conserved across different renormalization-group flow basins, via\nredundant fixed points. One of the phase diagrams contains a plastic crystal\nsequence, with positional and orientational ordering encountered consecutively\nas temperature is lowered. The global phase diagram also contains double\ncritical points, first-order and critical lines between two ordered phases,\ncritical endpoints, usual and unusual (inverted) bicritical points, tricritical\npoints, multiple tetracritical points, and zero-temperature criticality and\nbicriticality. The 4-state Potts permutation-symmetric subspace is contained in\nthis model.\n", "  The error propagation and statistical-noise reduction method of Reid and\nTrainor for two-point correlation applications in high-energy collisions is\nextended to include particle-pair references constructed by mixing two\nparticles from all event-pair combinations within event subsets of arbitrary\nsize. The Reid-Trainor method is also applied to other particle-pair mixing\nalgorithms commonly used in correlation analysis of particle production from\nhigh-energy nuclear collisions. The statistical-noise reduction, inherent in\nthe Reid-Trainor event-mixing procedure, is shown to occur for these other\nevent-mixing algorithms as well. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented\nwhich verify the predicted degree of noise reduction. In each case the final\nerrors are determined by the bin-wise particle-pair number, rather than by the\nbin-wise single-particle count.\n", "  We show that highly twisted minimal strips can undergo a non-singular\ntransition, unlike the singular transitions seen in the M\\\"obius strip and the\ncatenoid. If the strip is non-orientable this transition is topologically\nfrustrated, and the resulting surface contains a helical defect. Through a\ncontrolled analytic approximation the system can be mapped onto a scalar\n$\\phi^4$ theory on a non-orientable line bundle over the circle, where the\ndefect becomes a topologically protected kink soliton or domain wall, thus\nestablishing their existence in minimal surfaces. Experimental studies of soap\nfilms confirm these results and demonstrate how the position of the defect can\nbe controlled through boundary deformation.\n", "  Inert particles suspended in active fluids of self-propelled particles are\nknown to often exhibit enhanced diffusion and novel coherent structures. Here\nwe numerically investigate the dynamical behavior and self-organization in a\nsystem consisting of passive and actively rotating spheres. The particles\ninteract through direct collisions and the fluid flows generated as they move.\nIn the absence of passive particles, three states emerge in a binary mixture of\nspinning spheres depending on particle fraction: a dilute gas-like state where\nthe rotors move chaotically, a phase-separated state where like-rotors move in\nlanes or vortices, and a jammed state where crystals continuously assemble,\nmelt and move (K. Yeo, E. Lushi, and P. M. Vlahovska, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,\n188301 (2015)). Passive particles added to the rotor suspension modify the\nsystem dynamics and pattern formation: while states identified in the pure\nactive suspension still emerge, they occur at different densities and mixture\nproportions. The dynamical behavior of the inert particles is also\nnon-trivially dependent on the system composition.\n", "  The regular structures of a generic 4D symplectic map with a mixed phase\nspace are organized by one-parameter families of elliptic 1D-tori. Such\nfamilies show prominent bends, gaps, and new branches. We explain these\nfeatures in terms of bifurcations of the families when crossing a resonance.\nFor these bifurcations no external parameter has to be varied. Instead, the\nlongitudinal frequency, which varies along the family, plays the role of the\nbifurcation parameter. As an example we study two coupled standard maps by\nvisualizing the elliptic and hyperbolic 1D-tori in a 3D phase-space slice,\nlocal 2D projections, and frequency space. The observed bifurcations are\nconsistent with analytical predictions previously obtained for\nquasi-periodically forced oscillators. Moreover, the new families emerging from\nsuch a bifurcation form the skeleton of the corresponding resonance channel.\n", "  The influence of an applied shear on the planar crystal-melt interface is\nmodelled by a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation of the\ninterface fluctuations. A feature of this theory is the asymmetric destruction\nof interface fluctuations due to advection of the crystal protrusions on the\nliquid side of the interface only. We show that this model is able to\nqualitatively reproduce the nonequilibrium coexistence line found in\nsimulations. The impact of shear on spherical clusters is also addressed.\n", "  We recall some well and some less known results about the Kodama state and\nthe related $\\theta$ ambiguity in defining canonical variables. Based on them,\nwe make some comments highlighting that the Kodama state for real connection\nvariables can be given a precise meaning and that it implements a vacuum peaked\non a (in a suitable sense) maximally symmetric geometry. We also highlight the\nsimilarity of this construction with the isolated horizon boundary condition $F\n\\propto \\Sigma$ and stress that it is, in agreement with earlier work,\ninadequate to define the notion of a quantum horizon.\n", "  Cyber-physical systems are critical infrastructures that are crucial both to\nthe reliable delivery of resources such as energy, and to the stable\nfunctioning of automatic and control architectures. These systems are composed\nof interdependent physical, control and communications networks described by\ndisparate mathematical models creating scientific challenges that go well\nbeyond the modeling and analysis of the individual networks. A key challenge in\ncyber-physical defense is a fast online detection and localization of faults\nand intrusions without prior knowledge of the failure type. We describe a set\nof techniques for the efficient identification of faults from correlations in\nphysical signals, assuming only a minimal amount of available system\ninformation. The performance of our detection method is illustrated on data\ncollected from a large building automation system.\n", "  In addition to the well-known Landauer-Buttiker scattering theory and the\nnonequilibrium Green's function technique for mesoscopic transports, an\nalternative (and very useful) scheme is quantum master equation approach. In\nthis article, we review the particle-number (n)-resolved master equation (n-ME)\napproach and its systematic applications in quantum measurement and quantum\ntransport problems. The n-ME contains rich dynamical information, allowing\nefficient study of topics such as shot noise and full counting statistics\nanalysis. Moreover, we also review a newly developed master equation approach\n(and its n-resolved version) under self-consistent Born approximation. The\napplication potential of this new approach is critically examined via its\nability to recover the exact results for noninteracting systems under arbitrary\nvoltage and in presence of strong quantum interference, and the challenging\nnon-equilibrium Kondo effect.\n", "  We have identified the four most significant features in the UV velocity\ndistribution of solar neighborhood stars: H1, H2 in the Hercules stream and W1,\nW2 in the Wolf 630 stream. We have formulated the problem of determining\nseveral characteristics of the central Galactic bar independently from each of\nthe identified features by assuming that the Hercules and Wolf 630 streams are\nof a bar-induced dynamical nature. The problem has been solved by constructing\n2:1 resonant orbits in the rotating bar frame for each star in these streams.\nAnalysis of the resonant orbits found has shown that the bar pattern speed is\n45-55 km/s/kpc, while the bar angle lies within the range 40-60 degrees. The\nresults obtained are consistent with the view that the Hercules and Wolf 630\nstreams could be formed by a long-term influence of the Galactic bar leading to\na characteristic bimodal splitting of the UV velocity plane.\n", "  Dense suspensions of swimming bacteria are known to exhibit collective\nbehaviour arising from the interplay of steric and hydrodynamic interactions.\nUnconfined suspensions exhibit transient, recurring vortices and jets, whereas\nthose confinedin circular domains may exhibit order in the form of a spiral\nvortex. Here we show that confinement into a long and narrow macroscopic\n`racetrack' geometry stabilises bacterial motion to form a steady\nunidirectional circulation. This motion is reproduced in simulations of\ndiscrete swimmers that reveal the crucial role that bacteria-driven fluid flows\nplay in the dynamics. In particular, cells close to the channel wall produce\nstrong flows which advect cells in the bulk against their swimming direction.\nWe examine in detail the transition from a disordered state to persistent\ndirected motion as a function of the channel width,and show that the width at\nthe crossover point is comparable to the typical correlation length of swirls\nseen in the unbounded system. Our results shed light on the mechanisms driving\nthe collective behaviour of bacteria and other active matter systems, and\nstress the importance of the ubiquitous boundaries found in natural habitats.\n", "  We explore a model of gravity that arises from the consideration of the\nChern-Simons form in 2+1 dimensions for a spin connection with a contorsion\ndescribed by a scalar and a vector field. The effective Lagrangian presents a\nlocal Weyl symmetry allowing us to gauge the scalar field to a constant value.\nFrom a gauge field theory perspective, it is shown that the vector part of the\ntorsion (related to its trace) is a gauge field for the Weyl group, which\nallows the interpretation of the torsion as an electromagnetic field. In the\ngauge of constant scalar field we obtain Chiral Gravity coupled to a\nChern-Simons-Proca theory for the vector field, that at the level of equations\nof motion is equivalent to Topologically Massive Electrodynamics minimally\ncoupled to Chiral Gravity. Electrodynamics and gravity appear here unified as\ngeometrical features of a Riemann-Cartan manifold.\n", "  We formulate and apply a low-energy transport theory for hybrid quantum\ndevices containing junctions of topological superconductor (TS) wires and\nconventional normal (N) or superconducting (S) leads. We model TS wires as\nspinless $p$-wave superconductors and derive their boundary Keldysh Green's\nfunction, capturing both the Majorana end state and continuum quasiparticle\nexcitations in a unified manner. We also specify this Green's function for a\nfinite-length TS wire. Junctions connecting different parts of the device are\ndescribed by the standard tunneling Hamiltonian. Using this Hamiltonian\napproach, one also has the option to include many-body interactions in a\nsystematic manner. For N-TS junctions, we provide the current-voltage ($I$-$V$)\ncharacteristics at arbitrary junction transparency and give exact results for\nthe shot noise power and the excess current. For TS-TS junctions, analytical\nresults for the thermal noise spectrum and for the $I$-$V$ curve in the\nhigh-transparency low-bias regime are presented. For S-TS junctions, we compute\nthe entire $I$-$V$ curve and clarify the conditions for having a finite\nJosephson current.\n", "  The strange correlator [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 247202 (2014)] has been\nproposed as a measure of symmetry protected topological order in one- and\ntwo-dimensional systems. It takes the form of a spin-spin correlation function,\ncomputed as a mixed overlap between the state of interest and a trivial local\nproduct state. We demonstrate that it can be computed exactly (asymptotically,\nin the Monte Carlo sense) for various Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states by\ndirect evaluation of the wave function within the valence bond loop gas\nframework. We present results for lattices with chain, square, honeycomb, cube,\ndiamond, and hyperhoneycomb geometries. In each case, the spin quantum number S\nis varied such that 2S (the number of valence bonds emerging from each site)\nachieves various integer multiples of the lattice coordination number. We\nintroduce the concept of strange correlator loop winding number and point to\nits utility in testing for the presence of symmetry protected topological\norder.\n", "  We report microwave-driven photon-assisted tunneling in a suspended carbon\nnanotube double quantum dot. From the resonant linewidth at a temperature of 13\nmK, the charge dephasing time is determined to be 280 +- 30 ps. The linewidth\nis independent of driving frequency, but increases with increasing temperature.\nThe moderate temperature dependence is inconsistent with expectations from\nelectron-phonon coupling alone, but consistent with charge noise arising in the\ndevice. The extracted level of charge noise is comparable with that expected\nfrom previous measurements of a valley-spin qubit, where it was hypothesized to\nbe the main cause of qubit decoherence. Our results suggest a possible route\ntowards improved valley-spin qubits.\n", "  Chemical accuracy is difficult to achieve for systems with transition metal\natoms. Third row transition metal atoms are particularly challenging due to\nstrong electron-electron correlation in localized d-orbitals. The Cr2 molecule\nis an outstanding example, which we previously treated with highly accurate\nauxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations [Purwanto et al., J.\nChem. Phys. 142, 064302 (2015)]. Somewhat surprisingly, computational\ndescription of the isoelectronic Mo2 dimer has also, to date, been scattered\nand less than satisfactory. We present high-level theoretical benchmarks of the\nMo2 singlet ground state ($X ^1\\Sigma_g^+$) and first triplet excited state ($a\n^3\\Sigma_u^+$), using the phaseless AFQMC calculations. Extrapolation to the\ncomplete basis set limit is performed. Excellent agreement with experimental\nspectroscopic constants is obtained. We also present a comparison of the\ncorrelation effects in Cr2 and Mo2.\n", "  Optomechanical systems typically use light to control the quantum state of a\nmechanical resonator. In this paper, we propose a scheme for controlling the\nquantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled\nbeam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states\nenables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical\nresonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control,\nentangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent\namplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon\ninterference via a classically controlled beam splitter. The visibility of the\ntwo-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in\nthe mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically\ntransduced weak-force sensor.\n", "  The process $\\gamma \\gamma \\to p \\bar{p} K^+ K^-$ and its intermediate\nprocesses are measured for the first time using a 980~fb$^{-1}$ data sample\ncollected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$\ncollider. The production of $p \\bar{p} K^+ K^-$ and a\n$\\Lambda(1520)^0~(\\bar{\\Lambda}(1520)^0)$ signal in the $pK^-$~($\\bar{p} K^+$)\ninvariant mass spectrum are clearly observed. However, no evidence for an\nexotic baryon near 1540~MeV/$c^2$, denoted as\n$\\Theta(1540)^0$~($\\bar{\\Theta}~(1540)^0$) or\n$\\Theta(1540)^{++}$~($\\Theta(1540)^{--}$), is seen in the $p\nK^-$~($\\bar{p}K^+$) or $pK^+$~($\\bar{p} K^-$) invariant mass spectra. Cross\nsections for $\\gamma \\gamma \\to p \\bar{p} K^+ K^-$, $\\Lambda(1520)^0 \\bar{p}\nK^+ +c.c.$ and the products $\\sigma(\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\Theta(1540)^0 \\bar{p}\nK^+ +c.c.)\\BR(\\Theta(1540)^0 \\to p K^{-})$ and $\\sigma(\\gamma \\gamma \\to\n\\Theta(1540)^{++} \\bar{p} K^- +c.c.)\\BR(\\Theta(1540)^{++}\\to p K^{+})$ are\nmeasured. We also determine upper limits on the products of the $\\chi_{c0}$ and\n$\\chi_{c2}$ two-photon decay widths and their branching fractions to $p \\bar{p}\nK^+ K^-$ at the 90\\% credibility level.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium transport properties of a double quantum\ndot system connected in parallel to two leads, including intradot\nelectron-electron interaction. In the absence of interactions the system\nsupports a bound state in the continuum. This state is revealed as a Fano\nantiresonance in the transmission when the energy levels of the dots are\ndetuned. Using the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we find\nthat the occurrence of the Fano antiresonance survives in the presence of\nCoulomb repulsion. We give precise predictions for the experimental detection\nof bound states in the continuum. First, we calculate the differential\nconductance as a function of the applied voltage and the dot level detuning and\nfind that crossing points in the diamond structure are revealed as minima due\nto the transmission antiresonances. Second, we determine the thermoelectric\ncurrent in response to an applied temperature bias. In the linear regime,\nquantum interference gives rise to sharp peaks in the thermoelectric\nconductance. Remarkably, we find interaction induced strong current\nnonlinearities for large thermal gradients that may lead to several nontrivial\nzeros in the thermocurrent. The latter property is especially attractive for\nthermoelectric applications.\n", "  Combining the ability to prepare high-quality, intrinsic Bi$_2$Te$_3$\ntopological insulator thin films of low carrier density with in-situ protective\ncapping, we demonstrate a pronounced, gate-tunable change in transport\nproperties of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. Using a back-gate, the carrier density\nis tuned by a factor of $\\sim 7$ in Al$_2$O$_3$ capped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ sample and\nby a factor of $\\sim 2$ in Te capped Bi$_2$Te$_3$ films. We achieve full\ndepletion of bulk carriers, which allows us to access the topological transport\nregime dominated by surface state conduction. When the Fermi level is placed in\nthe bulk band gap, we observe the presence of two coherent conduction channels\nassociated with the two decoupled surfaces. Our magnetotransport results show\nthat the combination of capping layers and electrostatic tuning of the Fermi\nlevel provide a technological platform to investigate the topological\nproperties of surface states in transport experiments and pave the way towards\nthe implementation of a variety of topological quantum devices.\n", "  Spin fluctuation is presumed to be one of the key properties in understanding\nthe microscopic origin of heavy-fermion-like behavior in the class of\ntransition-metal compounds, including LiV$_2$O$_4$, Y(Sc)Mn$_2$, and\nYMn$_2$Zn$_{20}$. In this review, we demonstrate by our recent study of muon\nspin rotation/relaxation that the temperature ($T$) dependence of the\nlongitudinal spin relaxation rate ($\\lambda\\equiv 1/T_1$) in these compounds\nexhibits a common trend of leveling off to a constant value ($\\lambda\\sim\nconst$.) below a characteristic temperature, $T^*$. This is in marked contrast\nto the behavior predicted for normal metals from the Korringa relation,\n$\\lambda\\propto T/\\nu$, where the spin fluctuation rate ($\\nu$) in the Pauli\nparamagnetic state is given as a constant, $\\nu\\simeq 1/[h D(E_F)]$ [with\n$D(E_F)$ being the density of states at the Fermi energy]. Thus, the observed\nbehavior of $\\lambda$ implies that the spin fluctuation rate becomes linearly\ndependent on temperature, $\\nu\\propto T$, suggesting that heavy quasiparticles\ndevelop in a manner satisfying $D(E_F)\\propto (m^*)^{\\sigma}\\propto 1/T$ at\nlower temperatures ($\\sigma$ determined by the electronic dispersion).\nConsidering that the theory of spin correlation for intersecting Hubbard chains\nas a model of pyrochlore lattice predicts $\\nu\\propto T$, our finding strongly\nindicates the crucial role of $t_{2g}$ bands which preserve the one-dimensional\ncharacter at low energies due to the geometrical frustration specific to the\nundistorted pyrochlore lattice.\n", "  We describe a new hit-based $b$-tagging technique for high energy jets and\nstudy its performance with a Geant4-based simulation. The technique uses the\nfact that at sufficiently high energy a B meson or baryon can live long enough\nto traverse the inner layers of pixel detectors such as those in the ATLAS,\nALICE, or CMS experiments prior to decay. By first defining a \"jet\" via the\ncalorimeter, and then counting hits within that jet between pixel layers at\nincreasing radii, we show it is possible to identify jets that contain\n$b$-quarks by detecting a jump in the number of hits. We show that the\ntechnique maintains its efficiency at energies beyond the range of conventional\n$b$-taggers.\n", "  We report on observations of thickness dependent Josephson coupling and\nmultiple Andreev reflections (MAR) in vertically stacked molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2) - molybdenum rhenium (MoRe) Josephson junctions. MoRe, a chemically\ninert superconductor, allows for oxide free fabrication of high transparency\nvertical MoS2 devices. Single and bilayer MoS2 junctions display relatively\nlarge critical currents (up to 2.5 uA) and the appearance of sub-gap structure\ngiven by MAR. In three and four layer thick devices we observe orders of\nmagnitude lower critical currents (sub-nA) and reduced quasiparticle gaps due\nto proximitized MoS2 layers in contact with MoRe. We anticipate that this\ndevice architecture could be easily extended to other 2D materials.\n", "  We present a comparison of the tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect for laser\ninduced and intrinsic heating. Therefore,\nCo$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$/MgAl$_2$O$_4$ and Co$_{25}$Fe$_{55}$B$_{20}$/MgO\nmagnetic tunnel junctions have been prepared. The TMS ratio of 3\\,\\% in case of\nthe MAO MTJ agrees well with ratios found for other barrier materials, while\nthe TMS ratio of 23\\,\\% of the MgO MTJ emphasizes the influence of the CoFe\ncomposition. We find results using the intrinsic method that differ in sign and\nmagnitude in comparison to the results of the laser heating. The intrinsic\ncontributions can alternatively be explained by the Brinkman model and the\ngiven junction properties. Especially, we are able to demonstrate that the\nsymmetric contribution is solely influenced by the barrier asymmetry. Thus, we\nconclude that the symmetry analysis used for the intrinsic method is not\nsuitable to unambiguously identify an intrinsic tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect.\n", "  In the context of Einstein gravity, if the null energy condition (NEC) is\nsatisfied, the energy density in expanding space-times always decreases while\nin contracting space-times the energy density grows and the universe eventually\ncollapses into a singularity. In particular, no non-singular bounce is\npossible. It is, though, an open question if this energy condition can be\nviolated in a controlled way, i.e., without introducing pathologies, such as\nunstable negative-energy states or an imaginary speed of sound. In this paper,\nwe will re-examine the claim that the recently proposed mimetic scenario can\nviolate the NEC without pathologies. We show that mimetic cosmology is prone to\ngradient instabilities even in cases when the NEC is satisfied (except for\ntrivial examples). Most interestingly, the source of the instability is always\nthe Einstein-Hilbert term in the action. The matter stress-energy component\ndoes not contribute spatial gradient terms but instead makes the problematic\ncurvature modes dynamical. We also show that mimetic cosmology can be\nunderstood as a singular limit of known, well-behaved theories involving\nhigher-derivative kinetic terms and discuss ways of removing the instability.\n", "  The observed magnetic field on the solar surface is characterized by a very\ncomplex spatial and temporal behaviour. Although feature-tracking algorithms\nhave allowed us to deepen our understanding of this behaviour, subjectivity\nplays an important role in the identification, tracking of such features. In\nthis paper we study the temporal stochasticity of the magnetic field on the\nsolar surface \\textit{without} relying neither on the concept of magnetic\nfeature nor on subjective assumptions about their identification and\ninteraction. The analysis is applied to observations of the magnetic field of\nthe quiet solar photosphere carried out with the IMaX instrument on-board the\nstratospheric balloon {\\sc Sunrise}. We show that the joint probability\ndistribution functions of the longitudinal ($B_\\parallel$) and transverse\n($B_\\perp$) components of the magnetic field, as well as of the magnetic\npressure ($B^2=B^2_\\perp+B^2_\\parallel$), verify the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the Markov chains. Therefore we establish that the magnetic\nfield, as seen by IMaX with a resolution of 0.15\\arcsec-0.18\\arcsec and\n$33$~sec cadence, can be considered as a memoryless temporal fluctuating\nquantity.\n", "  The development and decay of a turbulent vortex tangle driven by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation is studied. Using a recently-developed accurate and\nrobust tracking algorithm, all quantised vortices are extracted from the\nfields. The Vinen's decay law for the total vortex length with a coefficient\nthat is in quantitative agreement with the values measured in Helium II is\nobserved. The topology of the tangle is then studied showing that linked rings\nmay appear during the decay. The tracking also allows for determining the\nstatistics of small-scales quantities of vortex lines, exhibiting large\nfluctuations of curvature and torsion. Finally, the temporal evolution of the\nKelvin wave spectrum is obtained providing evidence of the development of a\nweak-wave turbulence cascade.\n", "  Electronic wave-functions in the adiabatic representation acquire nontrivial\ngeometric phases (GPs) when corresponding potential energy surfaces undergo\nconical intersection (CI). These GPs have profound effects on the nuclear\nquantum dynamics and cannot be eliminated in the adiabatic representation\nwithout changing the physics of the system. To define dynamical effects arising\nfrom the GP presence the nuclear quantum dynamics of the CI containing system\nis compared with that of the system with artificially removed GP. We explore a\nnew construction of the system with removed GP via a modification of the\ndiabatic representation for the original CI containing system. Using an\nabsolute value function of diabatic couplings we remove the GP while preserving\nadiabatic potential energy surfaces and CI. We assess GP effects in dynamics of\na two-dimensional linear vibronic coupling model both for ground and excited\nstate dynamics. Results are compared with those obtained with a conventional\nremoval of the GP by ignoring double-valued boundary conditions of the real\nelectronic wave-functions. Interestingly, GP effects appear similar in two\napproaches only for the low energy dynamics. In contrast with the conventional\napproach, a new approach does not have substantial GP effects in the ultra-fast\nexcited state dynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a $D$-dimensional massive Thirring model with\n($2<D<4$). We derive an extended BRST symmetry of the theory with finite\nfield-dependent parameter. Further we compute the Jacobian of functional\nmeasure under such an extended transformation. Remarkably, we find that such\nJacobian extends the BRST exact part of the action which leads to a mapping\nbetween different gauges. We illustrate this with the help of Lorentz and\n$R_\\xi$ gauges. We also discuss the results in Batalin-Vilkovisky framework.\n", "  The influence of material inertia on neck development in a notched round bar\nis analyzed numerically. Dynamic axisymmetric calculations are carried out for\nisotropically hardening elastic-viscoplastic solids so that both material\nstrain rate sensitivity and material inertia are accounted for. The focus is on\nthe effect of bar size on whether the notch triggers necking or necking\ninitiates away from the notch. The governing equations are presented in\nnon-dimensional form and two key non-dimensional groups that involve both\nmaterial and loading parameters are identified. For both non-dimensional\ngroups, with all parameters fixed except for bar size, it is found that for\nsufficiently small bars, the notch triggers necking, whereas for sufficiently\nlarge bars necking ultimately occurs away from the notch. With material\nproperties fixed, for one non-dimensional group the transition to necking away\nfrom the notch corresponds to increasing imposed velocity whereas for the other\nnon- dimensional group this transition takes place for decreasing imposed\nstrain rate. Both these transitions correspond to increasing bar size. The\nresults indicate that this transition is governed by material inertia but the\nbar size at which it occurs depends on the material properties, particularly\nstrain hardening and strain rate hardening.\n", "  Neutron-rich light nuclei and their reactions play an important role for the\ncreation of chemical elements. Here, data from a Coulomb dissociation\nexperiment on $^{20,21}$N are reported. Relativistic $^{20,21}$N ions impinged\non a lead target and the Coulomb dissociation cross section was determined in a\nkinematically complete experiment. Using the detailed balance theorem, the\n$^{19}\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)^{20}\\mathrm{N}$ and\n$^{20}\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)^{21}\\mathrm{N}$ excitation functions and\nthermonuclear reaction rates have been determined. The\n$^{19}\\mathrm{N}(\\mathrm{n},\\gamma)^{20}\\mathrm{N}$ rate is up to a factor of 5\nhigher at $T<1$\\,GK with respect to previous theoretical calculations, leading\nto a 10\\,\\% decrease in the predicted fluorine abundance.\n", "  An interaction of upstream extra particles with a monolayer highly-ordered\ncomplex plasma is studied. A principally new abnormal turbulent wake formed\nbehind the supersonic upstream particle is discovered. An anomalous type of the\nturbulence wake clearly manifests in anomalously low thermal diffusivity and\ntwo orders of magnitude larger particle kinetic temperature compared to that of\nthe 'normal' wake (Mach cone) observed by Du et al [Europhys. Lett. 99, 55001\n(2012)].\n", "  We systematically study effects of external perturbations on models\ndescribing earthquake fault dynamics. The latter are based on the framework of\nthe Burridge-Knopoff spring-block system, including the cases of a simple\nmono-block fault, as well as the paradigmatic complex faults made up of two\nidentical or distinct blocks. The blocks exhibit relaxation oscillations, which\nare representative for the stick-slip behavior typical for earthquake dynamics.\nOur analysis is carried out by determining the phase response curves of first\nand second order. For a mono-block fault, we consider the impact of a single\nand two successive pulse perturbations, further demonstrating how the profile\nof phase response curves depends on the fault parameters. For a homogeneous\ntwo-block fault, our focus is on the scenario where each of the blocks is\ninfluenced by a single pulse, whereas for heterogeneous faults, we analyze how\nthe response of the system depends on whether the stimulus is applied to the\nblock having a shorter or a longer oscillation period.\n", "  The Sun's net radiative output varies on timescales of minutes to gigayears.\nDirect measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI) show changes in the\nspatially- and spectrally-integrated radiant energy on timescales as short as\nminutes to as long as a solar cycle. Variations of ~0.01 % over a few minutes\nare caused by the ever-present superposition of convection and oscillations\nwith very large solar flares on rare occasion causing slightly-larger\nmeasureable signals. On timescales of days to weeks, changing photospheric\nmagnetic activity affects solar brightness at the ~0.1 % level. The 11-year\nsolar cycle shows variations of comparable magnitude with irradiances peaking\nnear solar maximum. Secular variations are more difficult to discern, being\nlimited by instrument stability and the relatively short duration of the\nspace-borne record. Historical reconstructions of the Sun's irradiance based on\nindicators of solar-surface magnetic activity, such as sunspots, faculae, and\ncosmogenic isotope records, suggest solar brightness changes over decades to\nmillennia, although the magnitudes of these variations have high uncertainties\ndue to the indirect historical records on which they rely. Stellar evolution\naffects yet longer timescales and is responsible for the greatest solar\nvariabilities. In this manuscript I summarize the Sun's variability magnitudes\nover different temporal regimes and discuss the irradiance record's relevance\nfor solar and climate studies as well as for detections of exo-solar planets\ntransiting Sun-like stars.\n", "  We present a way of searching for non-transiting exoplanets with dusty tails.\nIn the transiting case, the extinction by dust during the transit removes more\nlight from the beam than is scattered into it. Thus, the forward scattering\ncomponent of the light is best seen either just prior to ingress, or just after\negress, but with reduced amplitude over the larger peak that is obscured by the\ntransit. This picture suggests that it should be equally productive to search\nfor positive-going peaks in the flux from non-transiting exoplanets with dusty\ntails. We discuss what amplitudes are expected for different orbital\ninclination angles. The signature of such objects should be distinct from\nnormal transits, starspots, and most - but not all - types of stellar\npulsations.\n", "  Multicolor photometry from the Tycho-2 and 2MASS catalogues for 11 990 OB and\n30 671 K-type red giant branch stars is used to detect systematic large-scale\nvariations of the interstellar extinction law within the nearest kiloparsec.\nThe characteristic of the extinction law, the total-to-selective extinction\nratio $R_V$, which also characterizes the size and other properties of\ninterstellar dust grains, has been calculated for various regions of space by\nthe extinction law extrapolation method. The results for the two classes of\nstars agree: the standard deviation of the \"red giants minus OB\" $R_V$\ndifferences within 500 pc of the Sun is 0.2. The detected $R_V$ variations\nbetween 2.2 and 4.4 not only manifest themselves in individual clouds but also\nspan the entire space near the Sun, following Galactic structures. In the Local\nBubble within about 100 pc of the Sun, $R_V$ has a minimum. In the inner part\nof the Gould Belt and at high Galactic latitudes, at a distance of about 150 pc\nfrom the Sun, $R_V$ reaches a maximum and then decreases to its minimum in the\nouter part of the Belt and other directions at a distance of about 500 pc from\nthe Sun, returning to its mean values far from the Sun. The detected maximum of\n$R_V$ at high Galactic latitudes is important when allowance is made for the\ninterstellar extinction toward extragalactic objects. In addition, a monotonic\nincrease in $R_V$ by 0.3 per kpc toward the Galactic center has been found near\nthe Galactic equator. It is consistent with the result obtained by Zasowski et\nal. (2009) for much of the Galaxy. Ignoring the $R_V$ variations and\ntraditionally using a single value for the entire space must lead to systematic\nerrors in the calculated distances reaching 10\\%.\n", "  The product of the previously constructed 3D maps of stellar reddening\n(Gontcharov 2010) and $R_V$ variations (Gontcharov 2012) has allowed us to\nproduce a 3D interstellar extinction map within the nearest kiloparsec from the\nSun with a spatial resolution of 50 pc and an accuracy of $0.2^m$. This map is\ncompared with the 2D reddening map by Schlegel et al. (1998), the 3D extinction\nmap at high latitudes by Jones et al. (2011), and the analytical extinction\nmodels by Arenou et al. (1992) and Gontcharov (2009). In all cases, we have\nfound good agreement and show that there are no systematic errors in the new\nmap everywhere except the direction toward the Galactic center. We have found\nthat the map by Schlegel et al. (1998) reaches saturation near the Galactic\nequator at $E_{(B-V)}>0.8^m$, has a zero-point error and systematic errors\ngradually increasing with reddening, and among the analytical models those that\ntake into account the extinction in the Gould Belt are more accurate. Our\nextinction map shows that it is determined by reddening variations at low\nlatitudes and $R_V$ variations at high ones. This naturally explains the\ncontradictory data on the correlation or anticorrelation between reddening and\n$R_V$ available in the literature. There is a correlation in a thin layer near\nthe Galactic equator, because both reddening and $R_V$ here increase toward the\nGalactic center. There is an anticorrelation outside this layer, because higher\nvalues of $R_V$ correspond to lower reddening at high and middle latitudes.\nSystematic differences in sizes and other properties of the dust grains in\ndifferent parts of the Galaxy manifest themselves in this way. The largest\nstructures within the nearest kiloparsec, including the Local Bubble, the Gould\nBelt, the Great Tunnel, the Scorpius, Perseus, Orion, and other complexes, have\nmanifested themselves in the constructed map.\n", "  Let $Z \\subset \\mathbb{A}^k$ be an affine scheme over $\\C$ and $\\J Z$ its jet\nscheme. It is well-known that $\\mathbb{C}[\\J Z]$, the coordinate ring of $\\J\nZ$, has the structure of a commutative vertex algebra. This paper develops the\norbifold theory for $\\mathbb{C}[\\J Z]$. A finite-order linear automorphism $g$\nof $Z$ acts by vertex algebra automorphisms on $\\mathbb{C}[\\J Z]$. We show that\n$\\mathbb{C}[\\J^g Z]$, where $\\J^g Z$ is the scheme of $g$--twisted jets has the\nstructure of a $g$-twisted $\\mathbb{C}[\\J Z]$ module. We consider spaces of\norbifold coinvariants valued in the modules $\\mathbb{C}[\\J^g Z]$ on orbicurves\n$[Y/G]$, with $Y$ a smooth projective curve and $G$ a finite group, and show\nthat these are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}[Z^G]$.\n", "  Online users tend to select claims that adhere to their system of beliefs and\nto ignore dissenting information. Confirmation bias, indeed, plays a pivotal\nrole in viral phenomena. Furthermore, the wide availability of content on the\nweb fosters the aggregation of likeminded people where debates tend to enforce\ngroup polarization. Such a configuration might alter the public debate and thus\nthe formation of the public opinion. In this paper we provide a mathematical\nmodel to study online social debates and the related polarization dynamics. We\nassume the basic updating rule of the Bounded Confidence Model (BCM) and we\ndevelop two variations a) the Rewire with Bounded Confidence Model (RBCM), in\nwhich discordant links are broken until convergence is reached; and b) the\nUnbounded Confidence Model, under which the interaction among discordant pairs\nof users is allowed even with a negative feedback, either with the rewiring\nstep (RUCM) or without it (UCM). From numerical simulations we find that the\nnew models (UCM and RUCM), unlike the BCM, are able to explain the coexistence\nof two stable final opinions, often observed in reality. Lastly, we present a\nmean field approximation of the newly introduced models.\n", "  We present a design of a stripline kicker for Integrable Optics Test\nAccelerator (IOTA). For its experimental program IOTA needs two full-aperture\nkickers, capable to create an arbitrary controllable kick in 2D. For that\nreason their strengths are variable in a wide range of amplitudes up to 16\nmrad, and the pulse length 100 ns is less than a revolution period for\nelectrons. In addition, the kicker should have a physical aperture of 40 mm for\na proposed operation with proton beam, and an outer size of 70 mm to fit inside\nexisting quadrupole magnets to save space in the ring. Computer simulations\nusing CST Microwave Studio show high field uniformity and wave impedance close\nto 50 {\\Omega}.\n", "  Low-energy muon beams are useful for rare decay searches, which provide\naccess to new physics that cannot be addressed at high-energy colliders.\nHowever, muons are produced within a broad energy spread unmatched to the\nlow-energy required. In this paper we outline a phase rotation method to\nsignificantly increase the intensity of low-energy muons. The muons are\nproduced from a short pulsed proton driver, and develop a time-momentum\ncorrelation in a drift space following production. A series of rf cavities is\nused to bunch the muons and phase-energy rotate the bunches to a momentum of\naround 100 MeV/c. Then another group of rf cavities is used to decelerate the\nmuon bunches to low-energy. This obtains ~0.1 muon per 8 GeV proton, which is\nsignificantly higher than currently planned Mu2e experiments, and would enable\na next generation of rare decay searches, and other intense muon beam\napplications.\n", "  We use the brick wall model to calculate the free energy of quantum scalar\nfield in a curved spacetime (D +1) dimensions. We find the thermodynamics\nproperties of quantum scalar field in several scenaries: Minkowski spacetime,\nSchwarzschild spacetime and BTZ spacetime. For the cases analysed, the\nthermodynamical properties of quantum scalar field is exactly with the\nreported. It was found that the entropy of the gas is proportional to the\nhorizon area in a gravity field strong, which is consistent with the\nholographic principle.\n", "  In a partnership with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and\nJefferson Lab, Fermilab will assemble and test 17 of the 35 total 1.3 GHz\ncryomodules for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) Project. These\ninclude a prototype built and delivered by each Lab. Another two 3.9 GHz\ncryomodules will be built, tested and transported by Fermilab to SLAC. Each\nassembly will be transported over-the-road from Fermilab or Jefferson Lab using\nspecific routes to SLAC. The transport system consists of a base frame,\nisolation fixture and upper protective truss. The strongback cryomodule lifting\nfixture is described along with other supporting equipment used for both\nover-the-road transport and local (on-site) transport at Fermilab. Initially,\nanalysis of fragile components and stability studies will be performed in order\nto assess the risk associated with over-the-road transport of a fully assembled\ncryomodule.\n", "  We report on a novel rectification phenomenon in a 2-D lattice network\nconsisting of $N\\times N$ sites with diode and AC source elements with\ncontrollable phases. A phase cascade configuration is described in which the\ncurrent ripple in a load resistor goes to zero in the large $N$ limit,\nenhancing the rectification efficiency without requiring any external capacitor\nor inductor based filters. The integrated modular configuration is\nqualitatively different from conventional rectenna arrays in which the source,\nrectifier and filter systems are physically disjoint. Exact analytical results\nderived using idealized diodes are compared to a realistic simulation of\ncommercially available diodes. Our results on nonlinear networks of\nsource-rectifier arrays are potentially of interest to a fast evolving field of\ndistributed power networks.\n", "  The Plate Archive of the Cordoba Observatory includes 20.000 photographs and\nspectra on glass plates dating from 1893 to 1983. This contribution describes\nthe work performed since the plate archive was transferred to the Observatory\nLibrary in 2011. In 2014 an interdisciplinary team was assembled and a research\ngrant from the National University of Cordoba was obtained with the objectives\nof preserving the glass plates and generate public access for astronomers and\nother audiences. The preservation work not only includes practical intervention\nto improve conservation conditions for the whole archive, but also a diagnose\nof the preservation conditions for the plates and identification of best\npractices for cleaning the plates. The access envisioned through digitization\nrequires not only the scanning of all the plates, but also careful definition\nand provision of metadata. In this regard, each institutional level involved\n-in this case: archive, library, astronomical observatory and public university\n- demands and provides different bibliographic practices, involving multiple\nstandards of description and coding.\n", "  A microscopic formalism for describing observed cross sections for deuteron\nbreakup by three-nucleon nuclei was developed on the basis of the diffraction\nnuclear model. A general formula that describes the amplitude for the reaction\nd+3He->3He+p+n and which involves only one adjustable parameter was obtained by\nusing expansions of the integrands involved in terms of a Gaussian basis. This\nformula was used to analyze experimental data on the exclusive cross sections\nfor deuteron breakup by He-3 nuclei at the projectile energy of 89.4 MeV. The\nimportance of employing, in calculations, a deuteron wave function that has a\ncorrect asymptotic behavior at large nucleon-nucleon distances was\ndemonstrated.\n", "  Intravital microscopy is an essential tool that reveals behaviours of live\ncells under conditions close to natural physiological states. So far, although\nvarious approaches for imaging cells in vivo have been proposed, most require\nthe use of labelling and also provide only qualitative imaging information.\nHolographic imaging approach based on measuring the refractive index\ndistributions of cells, however, circumvent these problems and offer\nquantitative and label-free imaging capability. Here, we demonstrate in vivo\ntwo- and three-dimensional holographic imaging of circulating blood cells in\nintact microcapillaries of live mice. The measured refractive index\ndistributions of blood cells provide morphological and biochemical properties\nincluding three-dimensional cell shape, haemoglobin concentration, and\nhaemoglobin contents at the individual cell level. With the present method,\nalterations in blood flow dynamics in live healthy and sepsis-model mouse were\nalso investigated.\n", "  The betweenness centrality of graphs using random walk paths instead of\ngeodesics is studied. A scaling collapse with no adjustable parameters is\nobtained as the graph size $N$ is varied; the scaling curve depends on the\ngraph model. A normalized random betweenness, that counts each walk passing\nthrough a node only once, is also defined. It is argued to be more useful and\nseen to have simpler scaling behavior. In particular, the probability for a\nrandom walk on a preferential attachment graph to pass through the root node is\nfound to tend to unity as $N\\rightarrow\\infty.$\n", "  In this paper, we study the exact entanglement dynamics of two two-level\natoms in a dissipative cavity. We use the Gardiner-Collett Hamiltonian to model\nthe dissipative cavity, in which, we assume that the two atoms resonantly\ninteract with the cavity field and the cavity field itself interacts with the\nsurrounding medium. Then, with the help of the Fano's technique, we show that,\nthis system can be regarded as two atoms interacting with a heat bath. In such\na case, we find that, there exists a decoherence-free state that does not\nevolve in time. At this time, there exists a so-called super-radiant state\nwhich decays in time due to dissipation. At last, we use the quantum Zeno\neffect to preserve the entanglement which already has been stored in the\nsystem.\n", "  New experimental results on bacterial growth inspire a novel top-down\napproach to study cell metabolism, combining mass balance and proteomic\nconstraints to extend and complement Flux Balance Analysis. We introduce here\nConstrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic\ncosts associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a\nsingle additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally\nobserved pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to\nbridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of\ngrowth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently\nand propose an \"ensemble averaging\" procedure to account for unknown protein\ncosts. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as\nthe growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory,\ngrowth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative\nstates with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA\nallows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion\nand growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth\nlaws.\n", "  We investigate the use of closure phase as a method to detect the HI 21cm\nsignal from the neutral IGM during cosmic reionzation. Closure quantities have\nthe unique advantage of being independent of antenna-based calibration terms.\nWe employ realistic, large area sky models from Sims et al. (2016). These\ninclude an estimate of the HI 21cm signal generated using 21cm FAST, plus\ncontinuum models of both the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission and the\nextragalactic point sources. We employ the CASA simulator and adopt the\nDillon-Parsons HERA configuration to generate a uv measurement set. We then use\nAIPS to calculate the closure phases as a function of frequency ('closure\nspectra'), and python scripts for subsequent analysis. We find that the closure\nspectra for the HI signal show dramatic structure in frequency, and based on\nthermal noise alone, the redundant HERA-331 array should detect these\nfluctuations easily. Comparatively, the frequency structure in the continuum\nclosure spectra is much smoother than that seen in the HI closure spectra.\nUnfortunately, when the line and continuum signals are combined, the continuum\ndominates the visibilities at the level of 10^3 to 10^4, and the line signal is\nlost. We have investigated fitting and removing smooth curves in frequency to\nthe line plus continuum closure spectra, and find that the continuum itself\nshows enough structure in frequency in the closure spectra to preclude\nseparation of the continuum and line based on such a process. We have also\nconsidered the subtraction of the continuum from the visibilities using a sky\nmodel, prior to calculation of the closure spectra. TRUNCATED.\n", "  In this investigation, Gd and Mn co-doped\nBi$_{0.85}$Gd$_{0.15}$Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$O$_3$ (x=0.0-0.15) nanoparticles have\nbeen prepared to report the influence of co-substitution on their structural,\noptical, magnetic and electrical properties. Due to simultaneous substitution\nof Gd and Mn in BiFeO$_3$, the crystal structure has been modified from\nrhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pn21a) and the Fe-O-Fe bond angle and Fe-O\nbond length have been changed. For Mn doping up to 10 % in\nBi$_{0.85}$Gd$_{0.15}$Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$O$_3$ nanoparticles, the saturation\nmagnetization (Ms) has been enhanced significantly, however, for a further\nincrease of doping up to 15 %, the Ms has started to reduce again. The\nco-substitution of Gd and Mn in BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles also demonstrates a\nstrong reduction in the optical band gap energy and electrical resistivity\ncompared to that of undoped BiFeO$_3$.\n", "  We investigate the effects of combining next-to-leading order QCD results\nwith parton-shower effects in $W^+W^-jj$ production via vector-boson fusion\nincluding leptonic decays. Using the Herwig 7 framework interfaced to VBFNLO 3,\nwe compare the predictions obtained from the angular-ordered and dipole-based\nparton shower algorithms combined with subtractive, MC@NLO-type, and\nmultiplicative, Powheg-type, matching. A consistent treatment of\nrenormalisation and factorisation scale variations in the hard process and the\nparton shower allows to assign more reliable theory uncertainty predictions to\nkey distributions like the central rapidity gap.\n", "  Lattice locations of 111In impurity probe atoms in intermetallic GdNi2 were\nstudied as a function of alloy composition and temperature using perturbed\nangular correlation spectroscopy (PAC). Three nuclear quadrupole interaction\nsignals were detected and their equilibrium site fractions were measured up to\n700 oC. Two signals have well-defined electric field gradients (EFGs) and are\nattributed to In-probes on Gd- and Ni-sites in a well-ordered lattice. A third,\ninhomogeneously broadened signal was observed at low temperature. This is\nattributed to trapping, or segregation, of In-probes to lattice sinks such as\ngrain boundaries (GB) that have a large multiplicity of local environments and\nEFGs. Changes in site fractions were reversible above 300oC. Measurements were\nmade on a pair of samples that were richer and poorer in Gd. Remarkably, the\nGB-site was populated only in the more Gd-rich sample. This is explained by the\nhypothesis that excess Gd segregates to the grain boundaries and provides a\nlower enthalpy environment for In-probe atoms. Observations are discussed in\nrelation to a three-level quantum system. Enthalpy differences between levels\nwere determined from measurements of temperature dependences of ratios of site\nfractions. The enthalpy of transfer of In-probes from the Gd- to Ni-sublattice\nwas found to be much smaller in the Gd-rich sample. This is attributed to a\nlarge temperature-dependence in the degeneracies of levels available to\nIn-solutes in the phase, leading to an effective transfer enthalpy that differs\ngreatly from the difference in site-enthalpies. A possible scenario is\ndiscussed. Different segregation enthalpies were measured for In-solute\ntransferring from GB sites to Gd- and Ni-sites, whereas only an average value\ncan be determined through macroscopic measurements.\n", "  Improvement in magnetic and electrical properties of multiferroic BiFeO$_3$\nin conjunction with their dependence on particle size is crucial due to its\npotential applications in multifunctional miniaturized devices. In this\ninvestigation, we report a study on particle size dependent structural,\nmagnetic and electrical properties of sol-gel derived\nBi$_{0.9}$Ba$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles of different sizes ranging from\n$\\sim$ 12 to 49 nm. The substitution of Bi by Ba significantly suppresses\noxygen vacancies, reduces leakage current density and Fe$^{2+}$ state. An\nimprovement in both magnetic and electrical properties is observed for 10 %\nBa-doped BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles compared to its undoped counterpart. The\nsaturation magnetization of Bi$_{0.9}$Ba$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles increase\nwith reducing particle size in contrast with a decreasing trend of\nferroelectric polarization. Moreover, a first order metamagnetic transition is\nnoticed for $\\sim$ 49 nm Bi$_{0.9}$Ba$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles which\ndisappeared with decreasing particle size. The observed strong size dependent\nmultiferroic properties are attributed to the complex interaction between\nvacancy induced crystallographic defects, multiple valence states of Fe,\nuncompensated surface spins, crystallographic distortion and suppression of\nspiral spin cycloid of BiFeO$_3$.\n", "  We report on progress toward computing a four-loop supersymmetric form factor\nin maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. A representative example\nparticle content from the involved supermultiplets is a stress-tensor operator\nwith two on-shell gluons. In previous work, the integrand for this form factor\nwas obtained using color-kinematic duality in a particularly simple form. Here\nthe result of applying integration-by-parts identities is discussed and\ncross-checks of the result is performed. Rational IBP relations and their\nreduction are introduced as a potentially useful aide.\n", "  Post-Newtonian equations of motion of a system of $N$ mass monopoles in the\nframework of the PPN formalism with two parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are\nderived for the case when the Strong Equivalence Principle can be violated. The\nderivation is based on the previously published general framework. The\nmultipole moments of each body are defined as a PPN-generalization of the\ncorresponding Blanchet-Damour multiple moments in a relevant local reference\nsystem defined for that body. The classical ten integrals of the derived\nequations of motion are given. A special version of the equations of motion,\nfor which seven of these integrals are exact, is discussed. The derived\nequations of motion can be used to test the Strong Equivalence Principle in\nvarious solar system experiments.\n", "  We test the robustness of the conditions required for the existence of\n(supersymmetric) warped flux anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski\nbackgrounds in supergravity theories using as examples suitable foliations of\nanti-de Sitter spaces. We find that there are supersymmetric de Sitter\nsolutions in supergravity theories including maximally supersymmetric ones in\n10- and 11-dimensional supergravities. Moreover, warped flux Minkowski\nbackgrounds can admit Killing spinors which are not Killing on the Minkowski\nsubspace and therefore cannot be put in a factorized form.\n", "  The evolution of multi-mode instabilities in a hypersonic boundary layer and\ntheir effects on aerodynamic heating are investigated. Experiments are\nconducted in a Mach 6 wind tunnel using Rayleigh-scattering flow visualization,\nfast-response pressure sensors, fluorescent temperature-sensitive paint (TSP),\nand particle image velocimetry (PIV). Calculations are also performed based on\nboth parabolized stability equations (PSE) and direct numerical simulations\n(DNS). It is found that second-mode dilatational waves, accompanied by\nhigh-frequency alternating fluid compression and expansion, produce intense\naerodynamic heating in a small region that rapidly heats the fluid passing\nthrough it. As a result, the surface temperature rapidly increases and results\nin an overshoot over the nominal transitional value. When the dilatation waves\ndecay downstream, the surface temperature decreases gradually until transition\nis completed. A theoretical analysis is provided to interpret the temperature\ndistribution affected by the aerodynamic heating.\n", "  With the discovery of a Higgs boson at LHC, all particles of the Standard\nModel seem to have been observed experimentally, yet many questions are left\nunanswered. The discovery has intensified the planning for future high-energy\ncolliders, which aim to probe the Standard Model and the mechanism of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking with higher precision and to extend and\ncomplement the search for new particles currently under way at the LHC. The\nmost mature option for such a future facility is the International Linear\nCollider ILC, an electron-positron collider with a centre-of-mass energy of 500\nGeV, and the potential for upgrades into the TeV region. The ILC will fully\nexplore the Higgs sector, including model-independent coupling and width\nmeasurements, direct measurements of the coupling to the top quark and the\nHiggs self-coupling, enable precision measurements of top quark properties and\ncouplings as well as other electroweak precision measurements and provide\nextensive discovery potential for new physics complementary to the capabilities\nof hadron colliders. This paper will give an overview of the physics case of\nthe ILC, put in context of the running scenario covering different\ncentre-of-mass energies, and discuss the current status and perspectives of\nthis global facility.\n", "  We report on telecom laser frequency stabilization to narrow iodine hyperfine\nline in the green range of the optical domain, after a frequency tripling\nprocess using two nonlinear PPLN crystals. We have generated up to 300 mW\noptical power in the green (P3w), from 800 mW of infrared power (Pw). This\nresult corresponds to an optical conversion efficiency eta= P3w/Pw ~ 36 %. To\nour knowledge, this is the best value ever demonstrated for a CW frequency\ntripling process. We have used a narrow linewidth iodine hyperfine line\n(component a1 of the 127I2 R 35 (44-0) line) to stabilize the IR laser yielding\nto frequency stability of 4.8x10-14 t-1/2 with a minimum of 6x10-15 reached\nafter 50 s of integration time. The whole optical setup is very compact and\nmostly optically fibered. This approach opens the way for efficient and elegant\narchitecture development for space applications as one of several potential\nuses.\n", "  Dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) is an experimental technique that is\ncommonly used to assess information of the strength, energy landscape, and\nlifetime of noncovalent bio-molecular interactions. DFS traditionally requires\nan applied force that increases linearly with time so that the bio-complex\nunder investigation is exposed to a constant loading rate. However, tethers or\npolymers can modulate the applied force in a nonlinear regime. For example,\nbacterial adhesion pili and polymers with worm-like chain properties are\nexamples of structures that show nonlinear force responses. In these\nsituations, the theory for traditional DFS cannot be readily applied. In this\nwork we expand the theory for DFS to also include nonlinear external forces\nwhile still maintaining compatibility with the linear DFS theory. To validate\nthe theory we modeled a bio-complex expressed on a stiff, an elastic and a\nworm-like chain polymer, using Monte Carlo methods, and assessed the\ncorresponding rupture force spectra. It was found that the nonlinear DFS\n(NLDFS) theory correctly predicted the numerical results. We also present a\nprotocol suggesting an experimental approach and analysis method of the data to\nestimate the bond length and the thermal off-rate.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the propagation of long-range surface\nplasmon-polaritons in a nobel metal stripe waveguide at an optical wavelength\nof 780 nm. To minimize propagation damping the lithographically structured\nwaveguide is produced from a thin gold stripe embedded in a dielectric polymer.\nOur waveguide geometry supports a symmetric fundamental and anti-symmetric\nfirst order mode. For the fundamental mode we measure a propagation loss of\n$(6.12^{+0.66} _{-0.54})$ dB/mm, in good agreement with numerical simulations\nusing a vectorial eigenmode solver. Our results are a promising starting point\nfor coupling fluorescence of individual solid state quantum emitters to\nintegrated plasmonic waveguide structures.\n", "  Mechanical resonators are ubiquitous in modern information technology. With\nthe ability to couple them to electromagnetic and plasmonic modes, they hold\nthe promise to be the key building blocks in future quantum information\ntechnology. Graphene based resonators are of interest for technological\napplications due to their high resonant frequencies, multiple mechanical modes,\nand low mass. The tension mediated non-linear coupling between various modes of\nthe resonator can be excited in a controllable manner. Here, we engineer a\ngraphene resonator to have large frequency tunability at low temperatures\nresulting in large intermodal coupling strength. We observe the emergence of\nnew eigenmodes and amplification of the coupled modes using red and blue\nparametric excitation respectively. We demonstrate that the dynamical\nintermodal coupling is tunable. A cooperativity of 60 between two resonant\nmodes of ~100 MHz is achieved in the strong coupling regime. The ability to\ndynamically control the coupling between high frequency eigenmodes of a\nmechanical system opens up possibility for quantum mechanical experiments at\nlow temperatures.\n", "  We discuss Drell-Yan production of dileptons at high energies in forward\nrapidity region in a hybrid high-energy approach. This approach uses\nunintegrated gluon distributions in one proton and collinear quark/antiquark\ndistributions in the second proton. Corresponding momentum-space formula for\nthe differential cross sections in high-energy approximation has been derived.\nThe relation to the commonly used dipole approach is discussed. We conclude and\nillustrate that some results of the dipole approaches are too approximate, as\nfar as kinemtics is considered, and in fact cannot be used for real\nexperiments. We find that the dipole formula is valid only in very\nforward/backward rapidity regions ($|y| >$ 5). Some differential cross sections\nfor low-mass dilepton production are shown and compared to the LHCb and ATLAS\nexperimental data. In distinction to dipole approaches, we include four\nDrell-Yan structure functions (the impact of interference structure functions\nis rather small for typical experimental cuts). We find that both side\ncontributions ($g q/\\bar q$ and $q/\\bar q g$) have to be included even for the\nLHCb rapidity coverage which is in contradiction with what is usually done in\nthe dipole approach. We present results for different unintegrated gluon\ndistributions from the literature (some of them include saturation effects). We\nsee no clear hints of saturation even at small $M_{ll}$.\n", "  We combine experiments and theory to investigate the orientational dynamics\nof dipolar ellipsoids, which self-assemble into elongated ribbon-like\nstructures due to the presence in each particle of a permanent magnetic moment\nperpendicular to the long axis. Monodisperse hematite ellipsoids are\nsynthesized via sol-gel technique, and arrange into ribbons in presence of\nstatic or time-dependent magnetic fields. We find that under an oscillating\nfield, the ribbons reorient perpendicular to the field direction, in contrast\nwith the behaviour observed under a static field. This observation is explained\ntheoretically by treating a chain of interacting ellipsoids as a single\nparticle with an orientational and demagnetizing field energy. The model allows\ndescribing the orientational behaviour of the chain and captures well its\ndynamics at different strengths of the actuating field. The understanding of\nthe complex dynamics and assembly of anisotropic magnetic colloids is a\nnecessary step towards controlling the structure formation which has direct\napplications in different fluid-based microscale technologies.\n", "  The abundant production of lepton pairs via $J/\\Psi$ creation at COMPASS,\n$\\pi ^\\pm \\, p^\\uparrow \\to J/\\Psi \\, X \\to \\ell^+ \\ell^- X$, allows a\nmeasurement of the transverse Single Spin Asymmetry generated by the Sivers\neffect. The crucial issue of the sign change of the Sivers function in lepton\npair production, with respect to Semi Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering\nprocesses, can be solved. Predictions for the expected magnitude of the Single\nSpin Asymmetry, which turns out to be large, are given.\n", "  Based on high-latitude molecular clouds with highly accurate distance\nestimates taken from the literature, we have redetermined the parameters of\ntheir spatial orientation. This system can be approximated by a 350x235x140 pc\nellipsoid inclined by the angle i=17+/-2 degrees to the Galactic plane with the\nlongitude of the ascending node l{\\Omega}=337+/-1 degrees. Based on the radial\nvelocities of the clouds, we have found their group velocity relative to the\nSun to be (u0,v0,w0) = (10.6,18.2,6.8)+/-(0.9,1.7,1.5) km/s. The trajectory of\nthe center of the molecular cloud system in the past in a time interval of ~60\nMyr has been constructed. Using data on masers associated with low-mass\nprotostars, we have calculated the space velocities of the molecular complexes\nin Orion, Taurus, Perseus, and Ophiuchus. Their motion in the past is shown to\nbe not random.\n", "  This paper discusses the behavior of electron bunch charge produced in an\nL-band normal conducting radio frequency cavity (RF gun) from Cs2Te\nphotocathodes illuminated with ps-long UV laser pulses when the laser\ntransverse distribution consists of a flat-top core with Gaussian-like decaying\nhalo. The produced charge shows a linear dependence at low laser pulse energies\nas expected in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime, while its\ndependence on laser pulse energy is observed to be much weaker for higher\nvalues, due to space charge limited emission. However, direct plug-in of\nexperimental parameters into the space charge tracking code ASTRA yields lower\noutput charge in the space charge limited regime compared to measured values.\nThe rate of increase of the produced charge at high laser pulse energies close\nto the space charge limited emission regime seems to be proportional to the\namount of halo present in the radial laser profile since the charge from the\ncore has saturated already. By utilizing core + halo particle distributions\nbased on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi-analytical\nemission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge for a wide range\nof RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement\nuncertainties.\n", "  Absolute cross sections are measured for charge-exchange, ionization, and\nexcitation within the same experimental setup for the Li$^{+}-$Ar, K$^{+}-$ Ar,\nand Na$^{+}-$ He collisions in the ion energy range $0.5-10$ keV. Results of\nour measurements along with existing experimental data and the schematic\ncorrelation diagrams are used to analyze and determine the mechanisms for these\nprocesses. The experimental results show that the charge-exchange processes are\nrealized with high probabilities and electrons are predominately captured in\nground states. The cross section ratio for charge exchange, ionization and\nexcitation processes roughly attains the value $10:2:1$, respectively. The\ncontributions of various partial inelastic channels to the total ionization\ncross sections are estimated and a primary mechanism for the process is\ndefined. The energy-loss spectrum, in addition, is applied to estimate the\nrelative contribution of different inelastic channels and to determine the\nmechanisms for the ionization and for some excitation processes of Ar resonance\nlines for the K$^{+}-$Ar collision system. The excitation function for the\nhelium, as well as for the sodium doublet lines for the Na$^{+}-$He collision\nsystem, reveals some unexpected features and a mechanism to explain this\nobservation is suggested.\n", "  We report an experimental realization of the quantum paradox of the\nseparation of a single photon from one of its properties (the so-called\n\"quantum Cheshire cat\"). We use a modified Sagnac interferometer with displaced\npaths to produce appropriately pre- and postselected states of heralded single\nphotons. Weak measurements of photon presence and circular polarization are\nperformed in each arm of the interferometer by introducing weak absorbers and\nsmall polarization rotations and analyzing changes in the postselected signal.\nThe absorber is found to have an appreciable effect only in one arm of the\ninterferometer, while the polarization rotation significantly affects the\nsignal only when performed in the other arm. We carry out both sequential and\nsimultaneous weak measurements and find good agreement between measured and\npredicted weak values. In the language of Aharonov et al. and in the sense of\nthe ensemble averages described by weak values, the experiment establishes the\nseparation of a particle from one its properties during the passage through the\ninterferometer.\n", "  The new g-2 experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment by a fourfold improvement in precision compared to the BNL\nexperiment. Achieving this goal requires the delivery of highly polarized 3.094\nGeV/c muons with a narrow +-0.5% {\\Delta}p/p acceptance to the storage ring. In\nthis study, we describe a muon capture and transport scheme that should meet\nthis requirement. First, we present the conceptual design of our proposed\nscheme wherein we describe its basic features. Then, we detail our numerical\nmodel and present a complete end-to-end simulation of all g-2 beamlines.\n", "  While one of the IAU's missions is to \"serve as the internationally\nrecognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies and surface\nfeatures on them\", the participation of the public in the naming of celestial\nobjects has been a little-known, but decade-long tradition of the IAU. While\nreiterating its opposition to having the public pay to give a name to an\nexoplanet, the IAU Executive Committee nonetheless recognized the right of\norganizations to invite public, international exoplanet naming or voting\ncampaigns. To this end, clear selection rules were to be defined by the IAU,\ninviting mutual collaboration, the goal being to sanction the campaign and\nofficially approve the resulting names, for the sake of boosting the public's\ninterest in astronomy and at the same time reaffirm the authority of the IAU.\nIn no way were these names supposed to supersede the designations in use by\nprofessional astronomers. Since the field of exoplanet research was still\n\"virgin\" for naming but is now becoming scientifically mature (with hundreds of\nwell-characterized, confirmed objects) and so appealing to the public's\ninterest and imagination, IAU decided to organize a naming contest as the\nleader of a new project with a potentially high worldwide impact, the first\nsince the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, called \"NameExoWorlds\".\n", "  The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is proposed for operation at\nFermilab. The goal of IOTA is to create practical nonlinear accelerator\nfocusing systems with a large frequency spread and stable particle motion. The\nIOTA is a 40 m circumference, 150 MeV (e-), 2.5 MeV (p+) diagnostic test ring.\nA heavy low frequency steel floor girder is proposed as the primary tier for\nIOTA device component support. Two design lengths; (8) 3.96 m and (2) 3.1 m\nlong girders with identical cross section completely encompass the ring. This\nstudy focuses on the 3.96 m length girder and the development of a working\nprototype. Hydrostatic Level Sensor (HLS), temperature, metrology and fast\nmotion measurements characterize the anticipated mechanical stability of the\nIOTA ring.\n", "  In this talk we review the recent computation of the five- and six-gluon\ntwo-loop amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory using local integrands which make the\ninfrared pole structure manifest. We make some remarks on the connection with\nBCJ relations and the all-multiplicity structure.\n", "  The prospects of phosphorene as an anode material for high performance Li-ion\nbattery was systematically investigated from the first principle calculations\nand experimental measurements. The diffusion energy barriers of a Li atom\nmoving along various orientations on phosphorene layer were calculated from the\nLi adsorption energy landscape. It was found that the diffusion mobility of a\nLi atom along the zigzag direction in the valley of phosphorene could be about\n7 to 11 orders of magnitude faster than that along the other directions,\nindicating its ultrafast and anisotropic diffusivity. The lithium insertion in\nphosphorene was studied considering various LinP16 configurations (n=1~16). It\nwas found that phosphorene could accommodate up to one Li per P atom (i.e.,\nLi16P16), and the predicted theoretical value of the Li capacity for a single\nlayered phosphorene can reach about 865 mAh/g. Our experimental measurement on\nthe Li capacity for a network of a few layered phosphorene can reach a\nreversible stable value of ~ 453 mAh/g even after 50 cycles. In particular, it\nwas found that, even at the high Li concentration (e.g., x = 1 in LixP), there\nwas no Li clustering and the structure of phosphorene is reversible during the\nlithium intercalation. Our results clearly show that phosphorene has promise as\na novel anode material for high performance Li-ion batteries.\n", "  We report the discovery by the HATSouth exoplanet survey of three hot-Saturn\ntransiting exoplanets: HATS-19b, HATS-20b, and HATS-21b. The planet host\nHATS-19 is a slightly evolved V = 13.0 G0 star with [Fe/H] = 0.240, a mass of\n1.303 Msun, and a radius of 1.75 Rsun. HATS-19b is in an eccentric orbit (e =\n0.30) around this star with an orbital period of 4.5697 days and has a mass of\n0.427 Mjup and a highly inflated radius of 1.66 Rjup. The planet HATS-20b has a\nSaturn-like mass and radius of 0.273 Mjup and 0.776 Rjup respectively. It\norbits the V = 13.8 G9V star HATS-20 (Ms = 0.910 Msun; Rs = 0.892 Rsun) with a\nperiod of 3.7993 days. Finally, HATS-21 is a V = 12.2 G4V star with [Fe/H] =\n0.300, a mass of 1.080 Msun, and a radius of 1.021 Rsun. Its accompanying\nplanet HATS-21b has a 3.5544-day orbital period, a mass of 0.332 Mjup, and a\nmoderately inflated radius of 1.123 Rjup. With the addition of these three very\ndifferent planets to the growing sample of hot-Saturns, we re-examine the\nrelations between the observed giant planet radii, stellar irradiation, and\nhost metallicity. We find a significant positive correlation between planet\nequilibrium temperature and radius, and a weak negative correlation between\nhost metallicity and radius. To assess the relative influence of various\nphysical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using\nRandom Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1 < Mp < 0.5 Mjup),\nthe planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in\ndetermining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5 < Mp < 2.0 Mjup), the most important\nparameter is equilibrium temperature alone. Finally, for irradiated higher-mass\nplanets (Mp > 2.0 Mjup), we find that equilibrium temperature dominates in\ninfluence, with smaller contributions from planet mass and host metallicity.\n", "  In this paper we study the Painlev\\'e analysis for two models of chemotaxis.\nWe find that in some cases the reductions of these models in terms of\ntravelling wave variable allow exact analytical solutions.\n", "  The fission-fragments mass-yield of 236U is obtained by an approximate\nsolution of the eigenvalue problem of the collective Hamiltonian that describes\nthe dynamics of the fission process whose degrees of freedom are: the fission\n(elongation), the neck and the mass-asymmetry mode. The macroscopic-microscopic\nmethod is used to evaluate the potential energy surface. The macroscopic energy\npart is calculated using the liquid drop model and the microscopic corrections\nare obtained using the Woods-Saxon single-particle levels. The four dimensional\nmodified Cassini ovals shape parametrization is used to describe the shape of\nthe fissioning nucleus. The mass tensor is taken within the cranking-type\napproximation. The final fragment mass distribution is obtained by weighting\nthe adiabatic density distribution in the collective space with the\nneck-dependent fission probability. The neck degree of freedom is found to play\na significant role in determining that final fragment mass distribution.\n", "  Radio Frequency (RF) power studies are in progress following the cryogenic\ncommissioning of Cryomodule #1 (CM1) at Fermilab's Superconducting Radio\nFrequency (SRF) Accelerator Test Facility. These studies are complemented by\nthe characterization of thermal acoustic effects on cavity microphonics\nmanifested by apparent noisy boiling of helium involving vapor bubble and\nliquid vibration. The thermal acoustic measurements also consider pressure and\ntemperature spikes which drive the phenomenon at low and high frequencies.\n", "  MuSim is a new user-friendly program designed to interface to many different\nparticle simulation codes, regardless of their data formats or geometry\ndescriptions. It presents the user with a compelling graphical user interface\nthat includes a flexible 3-D view of the simulated world plus powerful editing\nand drag-and-drop capabilities. All aspects of the design can be parameterized\nso that parameter scans and optimizations are easy. It is simple to create\nplots and display events in the 3-D viewer (with a slider to vary the\ntransparency of solids), allowing for an effortless comparison of different\nsimulation codes. Simulation codes: G4beamline 3.02 and MCNP 6.1; more are\ncoming. Many accelerator design tools and beam optics codes were written long\nago, with primitive user interfaces by today's standards. MuSim is specifically\ndesigned to make it easy to interface to such codes, providing a common user\nexperience for all, and permitting the construction and exploration of models\nwith very little overhead. For today's technology-driven students, graphical\ninterfaces meet their expectations far better than text based tools, and\neducation in accelerator physics is one of our primary goals.\n", "  The understanding of the non-perturbative regime of YM theories remains a\nchallenging open problem in theoretical physics. Notably, a satisfactory\ndescription of the confinement of gluons is not at our disposal so far. In this\nthesis, the RGZ framework, designed to provide a proper quantization of YM\ntheories by taking into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies is\nexplored. Successfully introduced in the Landau gauge, the RGZ set up does not\nextend easily to different gauges. The main reason is that a clear formulation\nof the analogue of the Gribov horizon in the Landau gauge is obstructed by\ntechnical difficulties when more sophisticated gauges are chosen. Moreover, the\nRGZ action breaks BRST symmetry explicitly, making the task of extracting gauge\ninvariant results even more difficult. The main goal of the present thesis is\nprecisely to provide a consistent framework to extend the RGZ action to gauges\nthat are connected to Landau gauge via a gauge parameter. Our main result is\nthe reformulation of the theory in the Landau gauge with appropriate variables\nsuch that a non-perturbative BRST symmetry is constructed. This symmetry\ncorresponds to a deformation of the standard BRST symmetry by taking into\naccount non-perturbative effects. This opens a toolbox which allow us to\nexplore what would be the Gribov horizon in different gauges as linear\ncovariant and Curci-Ferrari gauges. Consistency with gauge independence of\nphysical quantities as well as the computation of the gluon propagator in these\ngauges is provided. Remarkably, when lattice or functional methods results are\navailable, we verify very good agreement with our analytical proposal giving\nsupport that it could provide some insights about the non-perturbative regime\nof YM theories. A positivity violating gluon propagator in the infrared seems\nto be a general feature of the formalism.\n", "  Classical variable stars called RR Lyrae stars have pulsating outer envelopes\ncomprised of excited atoms. Here we demonstrate that the qualitative and\nquantitative properties of RR Lyrae variables and one subclass of their atomic\nscale constituents: singly-excited helium atoms undergoing transitions between\nRydberg states, share a remarkable degree of self-similarity. In terms of\nmasses, radii, oscillation periods, morphologies and kinematics the stellar and\natomic analogues obey a simple set of discrete self-similar scaling equations.\nThe concept of stellar/atomic self-similarity may prove useful in the search\nfor a deeper understanding of both stellar and atomic systems.\n", "  Professor Richard H. Dalitz passed away on January 13, 2006. He was almost 81\nyears old and his outstanding contributions are intimately connected to some of\nthe major breakthroughs of the 20th century in particle and nuclear physics.\nThese outstanding contributions go beyond the Dalitz Plot, Dalitz Pair and CDD\npoles that bear his name. He pioneered the theoretical study of strange baryon\nresonances, of baryon spectroscopy in the quark model, and of hypernuclei, to\nall of which he made lasting contributions. His formulation of the\n\"$\\theta-\\tau$ puzzle\" led to the discovery that parity is not a symmetry of\nthe weak interactions. A brief scientific evaluation of Dalitz's major\ncontributions to particle and nuclear physics is hereby presented, followed by\nthe first comprehensive list of his scientific publications, as assembled from\nseveral sources. The list is divided into two categories: the first, main part\ncomprises Dalitz's research papers and reviews, including topics in the history\nof particle physics, biographies and reminiscences; the second part lists book\nreviews, public lectures and obituaries authored by Dalitz, and books edited by\nhim. This provides the first necessary step towards a more systematic research\nof the Dalitz heritage in modern physics.\n  The present 2016 edition updates the original 2006 edition, published in\nNucl. Phys. A 771 (2006) 2-7, doi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2006.03.007, and 8-25,\ndoi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2006.03.008, by including for the first time a dozen or\nso of publications, found recently in a list submitted to the Royal Society by\nDalitz in 2004, that escaped our attention in the original version.\n", "  The possibility that global discrete dilation invariance is a fundamental\nsymmetry principle of nature is explored. If the discrete self-similarity\nobserved in nature is exact, then the Principle of General Covariance needs to\nbe broadened in order to accommodate this form of discrete conformal\ninvariance, and a further generalization of relativity theory is required.\n"]}
