some\nphenomena. The method we use is a competition method, $S_S/\\tau+\\sigma={\\it\nmaximum}$, where $S_S$ is system entropy, $\\sigma$ is entropy production and\n$\\tau$ is microscopic interaction time. System entropy is calculated from the\nequilibrium state by studying the flux fluctuations. The phenomena we study\ninclude ionic conduction, atomic diffusion, thermal conduction and viscosity of\na dilute gas.\n", "  Because diffusion typically involves symmetric interactions, scant attention\nhas been focused on studying asymmetric cases. However, important networked\nsystems underlain by diffusion (e.g. cortical networks and WWW) are inherently\ndirected. In the case of undirected diffusion, it can be shown that the\nsteady-state probability of the random walk dynamics is fully correlated with\nthe degree, which no longer holds for directed networks. We investigate the\nrelationship between such probability and the inward node degree, which we call\nefficiency, in modular networks. Our findings show that the efficiency of a\ngiven community depends mostly on the balance between its ingoing and outgoing\nconnections. In addition, we derive analytical expressions to show that the\ninternal degree of the nodes do not play a crucial role in their efficiency,\nwhen considering the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and Barab\\'asi-Albert models. The\nresults are illustrated with respect to the macaque cortical network, providing\nsubsidies for improving transportation and communication systems.\n", "  Recently, some studies started to unveil the wealthy of interactions that\noccur between groups of nodes when looking at the small scale of interactions\ntaking place in complex networks. Such findings claim for a new systematic\nmethodology to quantify, at node level, how a dynamics is being influenced (or\ndifferentiated) by the structure of the underlying system. Here we define a new\nmeasure that, based on dynamical characteristics obtained for a large set of\ninitial conditions, compares the dynamical behavior of the nodes present in the\nsystem. Through this measure we find that the geographic and Barab\\'asi-Albert\nmodels have high capacity for generating networks that exhibit groups of nodes\nwith distinct dynamics compared to the rest of the network. The application of\nour methodology is illustrated with respect of two real systems. In the first\nwe use the neuronal network of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to show that\nthe interneurons of the ventral cord of the nematode presents a very large\ndynamical differentiation when compared to the rest of the network. The second\napplication concerns the SIS epidemic model on an airport network, where we\nquantify how different the distribution of infection times of high and low\ndegree nodes can be, when compared to the expected value for the network.\n", "  It is known that the ionic conductivity can be obtained by using the\ndiffusion constant and the Einstein relation. We derive it here by extracting\nit from the steady electric current which we calculate in three ways, using\nstatistics analysis, an entropy method, and an entropy production approach.\n", "  We study the geometric properties of the manifold of states described as\n(uniform) matrix product states. Due to the parameter redundancy in the matrix\nproduct state representation, matrix product states have the mathematical\nstructure of a (principal) fiber bundle. The total space or bundle space\ncorresponds to the parameter space, i.e. the space of tensors associated to\nevery physical site. The base manifold is embedded in Hilbert space and can be\ngiven the structure of a K\\\"ahler manifold by inducing the Hilbert space\nmetric. Our main interest is in the states living in the tangent space to the\nbase manifold, which have recently been shown to be interesting in relation to\ntime dependence and elementary excitations. By lifting these tangent vectors to\nthe (tangent space) of the bundle space using a well-chosen prescription (a\nprincipal bundle connection), we can define and efficiently compute an inverse\nmetric, and introduce differential geometric concepts such as parallel\ntransport (related to the Levi-Civita connection) and the Riemann curvature\ntensor.\n", "  The stress-induced switching behavior of a multiferroic nanomagnet, dipole\ncoupled to a hard nanomagnet, is numerically studied by solving the stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for a single domain macro-spin state.\nDifferent factors were found to affect the switching probability in the\npresence of thermal noise at room temperature: (i) dipole coupling strength,\n(ii) stress levels, and (iii) stress withdrawal rates (ramp rates). We report\nthat the thermal broadening of the magnetization distribution causes large\nswitching error rates. This could render nanomagnetic logic schemes that rely\non dipole coupling to perform Boolean logic operations impractical whether they\nare clocked by stress or field or other means.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic nuclear polarization process by frequently\ninjecting polarized electron spins into a quantum dot. Due to the suppression\nof the direct dipolar and indirect electron-mediated nuclear spin interactions,\nby the frequently injected electron spins, the analytical predictions under the\nindependent spin approximation agree well with quantum numerical simulations.\nOur results show that the acquired nuclear polarization is highly\ninhomogeneous, proportional to the square of the local electron-nuclear\nhyperfine interaction constant, if the injection frequency is high. Utilizing\nthe inhomogeneously polarized nuclear spins as an initial state, we further\nshow that the electron-polarization decay time can be extended 100 times even\nat a relatively low nuclear polarization (<20%), without much suppression of\nthe fluctuation of the Overhauser field. Our results lay the foundation for\nfuture investigations of the effect of DNP in more complex spin systems, such\nas double quantum dots and nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds.\n", "  This article is devoted to an overview of superstring perturbation theory\nfrom the point of view of super Riemann surfaces. We aim to elucidate some of\nthe subtleties of superstring perturbation that caused difficulty in the early\nliterature, focusing on a concrete example -- the $SO(32)$ heterotic string\ncompactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold, with the spin connection embedded in the\ngauge group. This model is known to be a significant test case for superstring\nperturbation theory. Supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at 1-loop order, and\nto treat correctly the supersymmetry-breaking effects that arise at 1- and\n2-loop order requires a precise formulation of the procedure for integration\nover supermoduli space. In this paper, we aim as much as possible for an\ninformal explanation, though at some points we provide more detailed\nexplanations that can be omitted on first reading.\n", "  Long-time evolution of a weakly perturbed wavetrain near the modulational\ninstability threshold is investigated within the framework of the compact\nZakharov equation for unidirectional deep-water waves, recently derived by\nZakharov & Dyachenko (2011). Multiple-scale solutions reveal that a\nperturbation to a slightly unstable uniform wavetrain of steepness \\mu slowly\nevolves according to a Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In particular, for small\ncarrier wave steepness \\mu<\\mu_1~0.27 the perturbation dynamics is of focusing\ntype and the long-time behavior is characterized by Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\nrecurrence, the signature of breather interactions. However, the amplitude of\nbreathers and their likelihood of occurrence tend to diminish as \\mu increases\nwhile the Benjamin-Feir index decreases and becomes nil at \\mu1. Thus,\nhomoclinic orbits persist only for small values of wave steepness \\mu<<\\mu_1,\nin agreement with recent experimental and numerical observations of breathers.\nWhen the Zakharov equation is already beyond its range of nominal validity for\n\\mu>\\mu_1, predictions seem to foreshadow a dynamical trend to wave breaking.\nIn particular, the perturbation dynamics becomes of defocussing type, and\nnonlinearities tend to stabilize a linearly unstable wavetrain as\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence is suppressed. At \\mu=\\mu_c~0.577, subharmonic\nperturbations restabilize and superharmonic instability appears, possibly\nindicating that wave dynamic behavior changes at large steepness, in\nqualitative agreement with the numerical simulations of Longuet-Higgins and\nCokelet (1978) for steep waves. Indeed, for \\mu>\\mu_c a multiple-scale\nperturbation analysis reveals that a weak narrowband perturbation to a uniform\nwavetrain evolves in accord with a modified Korteweg-de Vries/Camassa-Holm type\nequation, again implying a possible mechanism conducive to initiating wave\nbreaking.\n", "  We present a polynomial-time reduction of the discrete logarithm problem in\nany periodic (a.k.a. torsion) semigroup (SGDLP) to the same problem in a\nsubgroup of the same semigroup. It follows that SGDLP can be solved in\npolynomial time by quantum computers, and that SGDLP has subexponential\nalgorithms whenever the classic DLP in the corresponding groups has\nsubexponential algorithms.\n", "  We demonstrate sub-Doppler laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the\nrare earth element Holmium. Atoms are loaded from an atomic beam source and\ncaptured in six-beam $\\sigma_+ - \\sigma_-$ molasses using a strong $J=15/2\n\\leftrightarrow J=17/2$ cycling transition at $\\lambda=410.5 \\rm nm$. Due to\nthe small difference in hyperfine splittings and Land\\'e $g$-factors in the\nlower and upper levels of the cooling transition the MOT is self-repumped\nwithout additional repump light, and deep sub-Doppler cooling is achieved with\nthe magnetic trap turned on. We measure the leakage out of the cycling\ntransition to metastable states and find a branching ratio $\\sim 10^{-5}$ which\nis adequate for state resolved measurements on hyperfine encoded qubits.\n", "  We generalize the analysis of arXiv:1210.7244 to de Sitter space \\alpha-vacua\nand compute the entanglement entropy of a free scalar for the half-sphere at\nlate time.\n", "  Recently, Banner et al. (2014) highlighted a new fundamental property of open\nocean wave groups, the so-called crest slowdown. For linear narrowband waves,\nthis is related to the geometric and dynamical phase velocities $U_d$ and $U_g$\nassociated with the parallel transport through the principal fiber bundle of\nthe wave motion with $\\mathit{U}(1)$ symmetry. The theoretical predictions are\nshown to be in fair agreement with ocean field observations, from which the\naverage crest speed $c=U_d+U_g$ with $c/U_d\\approx0.8$ and\n$U_{g}/U_d\\approx-0.2$.\n", "  We propose numerical simulations of viscoelastic fluids based on a hybrid\nalgorithm combining Lattice-Boltzmann models (LBM) and Finite Differences (FD)\nschemes, the former used to model the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations, and\nthe latter used to model the polymer dynamics. The kinetics of the polymers is\nintroduced using constitutive equations for viscoelastic fluids with finitely\nextensible non-linear elastic dumbbells with Peterlin's closure (FENE-P). The\nnumerical model is first benchmarked by characterizing the rheological\nbehaviour of dilute homogeneous solutions in various configurations, including\nsteady shear, elongational flows, transient shear and oscillatory flows. As an\nupgrade of complexity, we study the model in presence of non-ideal\nmulticomponent interfaces, where immiscibility is introduced in the LBM\ndescription using the \"Shan-Chen\" model. The problem of a confined viscoelastic\n(Newtonian) droplet in a Newtonian (viscoelastic) matrix under simple shear is\ninvestigated and numerical results are compared with the predictions of various\ntheoretical models. The proposed numerical simulations explore problems where\nthe capabilities of LBM were never quantified before.\n", "  These lecture notes have been prepared as a course in fluid mechanics up to\nthe presentation of the millennium problem listed by the Clay Mathematical\nInstitute. At the end, a very modern aspect of fluid mechanics is covered\nconcerning the subtle issue of its application to high energetic hadronic\ncollisions.\n", "  We provide a model for the prediction of the electronic and magnetic\nconfigurations of ferromagnetic Fe after an ultrafast decrease or increase of\nmagnetization. The model is based on the well-grounded assumption that, after\nthe ultrafast magnetization change, the system achieves a partial thermal\nequilibrium. With statistical arguments it is possible to show that the\nmagnetic configurations are qualitatively different in the case of reduced or\nincreased magnetization. The predicted magnetic configurations are then used to\ncompute the dielectric response at the 3p (M) absorption edge, which can be\nrelated to the changes observed in the experimental T-MOKE data. The good\nqualitative agreement between theory and experiment offers a substantial\nsupport to the existence of an ultrafast increase of magnetisation, which has\nbeen fiercely debated in the last years.\n", "  We propose a generalization of Hopf fibrations to quotient the streamwise\ntranslation symmetry of turbulent pipe flows viewed as dynamical systems. In\nparticular, we exploit the geometric structure of the associate high\ndimensional state space, which is that of a principal fiber bundle. The\nrelation between the comoving frame velocity $U_{d}$ associated with the\ndynamical phase of an orbit in the bundle and the Taylor's hypothesis is\ninvestigated. As an application, Laser-Induced-Fluorescence techniques are\nexploited to capture planar fluorescent dye concentration fields tracing a\nturbulent pipe flow at the bulk Reynolds number $\\mathfrak{\\mathsf{Re}}=3200$.\nThe symmetry reduction analysis of the experimental data reveals that the speed\n$u$ of dye concentration bursts is associated with the dynamical and geometric\nphases of the corresponding orbits in the fiber bundle. In particular, in the\nsymmetry-reduced frame we unveil a pattern-changing dynamics of the passive\nscalar structures, which explains the observed speed $u\\approx U_{d}+U_{g}$ of\nintense bursting events in terms of the geometric phase velocity\n$U_{g}\\approx0.43U_{d}$ associated with the orbits in the bundle.\n", "  We obtain the exact low-energy spectrum of two mobile holes in a t-J model\nfor an isolated layer in an iron-pnictide superconductor. The minimum d xz and\nd yz orbitals per iron atom are included, with no hybridization between the\ntwo. After tuning the Hund coupling to a putative quantum critical point (QCP)\nthat separates a commensurate spin-density wave from a hidden-order\nantiferromagnet at half filling, we find an s-wave hole-pair groundstate and a\nd-wave hole-pair excited state. Near the QCP, both alternate in sign between\nhole Fermi surface pockets at the Brillouin zone center and emergent electron\nFermi surface pockets at momenta that correspond to commensurate spin-density\nwaves (cSDW). The dependence of the energy splitting with increasing Hund\ncoupling yields evidence for a true QCP in the thermodynamic limit near the\nputative one, at which the s-wave and d-wave Cooper pairs are degenerate. A\ncollective s-to-d-wave oscillation of the macroscopic superconductor that\ncouples to orthorhombic shear strain is also identified. Its resonant frequency\nis predicted to collapse to zero at the QCP in the limit of low hole\nconcentration. This implies degeneracy of Cooper pairs with s, d and s+id\nsymmetry in the corresponding quantum critical state. We argue that the\ncritical state describes Cooper pairs in hole-doped iron superconductors at the\nLifshitz transition, where electron bands first rise above the Fermi level. We\nthereby predict that the s-to-d-wave collective mode observed by Raman\nspectroscopy in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 at optimal doping should also be observed at\nhigher doping near the Lifshitz transition.\n", "  We analyze the linear stability of an axially symmetric ideal plasma disk,\nembedded in a magnetic field and endowed with a differential rotation. This\nstudy is performed by adopting the magnetic flux function as the fundamental\ndynamical variable, in order to outline the role played by the co-rotation\ntheorem on the linear mode structure. Using some specific assumptions (e.g.\nplasma incompressibility and propagation of the perturbations along the\nbackground magnetic field), we select the Alfvenic nature of the\nMagneto-Rotational Instability and, in the geometric optics limit, we determine\nthe dispersion relation describing the linear spectrum. We show how the\nimplementation of the co-rotation theorem (valid for the background\nconfiguration) on the linear dynamics produces the cancellation of the vertical\nderivative of the disk angular velocity (we check such a feature also in the\nstandard vector formalism to facilitate comparison with previous literature,\nboth in the axisymmetric and three-dimensional case). As a result, we clarify\nthat the unstable modes have, for a stratified disk, the same morphology,\nproper of a thin disk profile, and the $z$ dependence has a simple parametric\nrole.\n", "  We prove the local existence of solutions to the Einstein-Elastic equations\nthat represent self-gravitating, relativistic elastic bodies with compact\nsupport.\n", "  The eigenvalue structure of the quantum transfer matrix is known to encode\nessential information about the elementary excitations. Here we study transfer\nmatrices of quantum states in a topological phase using the tensor network\nformalism. We demonstrate that topological quantum order requires a particular\ntype of `symmetry breaking' for the fixed point subspace of the transfer\nmatrix, and relate physical anyon excitations to domain wall excitations at the\nlevel of the transfer matrix. A topological phase transition to a trivial phase\ntriggers a change in the fixed point subspace to either a larger or smaller\nsymmetry and we explain how this relates to a condensation or confinement of\nthe corresponding anyon sectors. The tensor network formalism enables us to\ndetermine the structure of the topological sectors in two-dimensional gapped\nphases very efficiently, therefore opening novel avenues for studying\nfundamental open questions related to anyon condensation.\n", "  Noether's Theorem on constants of the motion of dynamical systems has\nrecently been extended to classical dissipative systems (Markovian semi-groups)\nby Baez and Fong. We show how to extend these results to the fully quantum\nsetting of quantum Markov dynamics. For finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we\nconstruct a mapping from observables to CP maps that leads to the natural\nanalogue of their criterion of commutativity with the infinitesimal generator\nof the Markov dynamics. Using standard results on the relaxation of states to\nequilibrium under quantum dynamical semi-groups, we are able to characterise\nthe constants of the motion under quantum Markov evolutions in the\ninfinite-dimensional setting under the usual assumption of existence of a\nstationary strictly positive density matrix. In particular, the Noether\nconstants are identified with the fixed point of the Heisenberg picture\nsemigroup.\n", "  We investigate the role played by particular field representations of an\nintermediate massive spin-1 boson in the context of spin-dependent\ninterparticle potentials between fermionic sources in the limit of low momentum\ntransfer. The comparison between the well-known case of the Proca field and\nthat of an exchanged spin-1 boson (with gauge-invariant mass) described by a\n2-form potential mixed with a 4-vector gauge field is established in order to\npursue an analysis of spin- as well as velocity-dependent profiles of the\ninterparticle potentials. We discuss possible applications and derive an upper\nbound on the product of vector and pseudo-tensor coupling constants.\n", "  Strain-clocked dipole-coupled nanomagnetic logic is an energy-efficient\nBoolean logic paradigm whose progress has been stymied by its propensity for\nhigh error rates. In an effort to mitigate this problem, we have studied the\neffect of nanomagnet geometry on error rates, focusing on elliptical and\ncylindrical geometries. We had previously reported that the out-of-plane\nexcursion of the magnetization vector during switching creates a precessional\ntorque that is responsible for high switching error probability in elliptical\nnanomagnet geometries. The absence of this torque in cylindrical magnets\nportends lower error rates, but our simulations show that the error rate\nactually does not improve significantly compared to elliptical magnets while\nthe switching becomes unacceptably slow. Here, we show that dipole coupled\nnanomagnetic logic can offer relatively high reliability (switching error\nprobability < 10^-8), moderate clock speed (~ 100 MHz) and 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude energy saving compared to CMOS devices, provided the shape anisotropy\nenergy barrier of the magnet is increased to at least ~5.5 eV to allow\nengineering a stronger dipole coupling between neighboring nanomagnets.\n", "  Starting from an action that describes a Dirac fermion, we propose and\nanalyze a model based on a low-relativistic Pauli equation coupled to a\ntorsion-like term to study Spin Hall Effect (SHE). We point out a very\nparticular connection between the modified Pauli equation and the (SHE), where\nwhat we refer to torsion as field playing an important r\\^ole in the spin-orbit\ncoupling process. In this scenario, we present a proposal of a spin-type\ncurrent, considering the tiny contributions of torsion in connection with\ngeometrical properties of the material.\n", "  A good deal of current research in complex networks involves the\ncharacterization and/or classification of the topological properties of given\nstructures, which has motivated several respective measurements. This letter\nproposes a framework for evaluating the quality of complex network measurements\nin terms of their effective resolution, degree of degeneracy and\ndiscriminability. The potential of the suggested approach is illustrated with\nrespect to comparing the characterization of several model and real-world\nnetworks by using concentric and symmetry measurements. The results indicate a\nmarkedly superior performance for the latter type of mapping.\n", "  We analyse various properties of stochastic Markov processes with\nmultiplicative white noise. We take a single-variable problem as a simple\nexample, and we later extend the analysis to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation for the stochastic dynamics of a magnetic moment. In particular, we\nfocus on the non-equilibrium transfer of angular momentum to the magnetization\nfrom a spin-polarised current of electrons, a technique which is widely used in\nthe context of spintronics to manipulate magnetic moments. We unveil two hidden\ndynamical symmetries of the generating functionals of these Markovian\nmultiplicative white-noise processes. One symmetry only holds in equilibrium\nand we use it to prove generic relations such as the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorems. Out of equilibrium, we take profit of the symmetry-breaking terms to\nprove fluctuation theorems. The other symmetry yields strong dynamical\nrelations between correlation and response functions which can notably simplify\nthe numerical analysis of these problems. Our construction allows us to clarify\nsome misconceptions on multiplicative white-noise stochastic processes that can\nbe found in the literature. In particular, we show that a first-order\ndifferential equation with multiplicative white noise can be transformed into\nan additive-noise equation, but that the latter keeps a non-trivial memory of\nthe discretisation prescription used to define the former.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit Janssen's (2003) formulation for the dynamic excess\nkurtosis of weakly nonlinear gravity waves at deep water. For narrowband\ndirectional spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that\ndepends upon the Benjamin-Feir index and the parameter\n$R=\\sigma_{\\theta}^{2}/2\\nu^{2}$, a measure of short-crestedness for the\ndominant waves with $\\nu$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta}$} denoting spectral bandwidth\nand angular spreading. Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for\nthe dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian\ntype spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogenous\nand Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows\ninitially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic\ntime scale \\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\nu^{2}\\omega_{0}t_{c}=1/\\sqrt{3R},\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad\nt_{c}/T_{0}\\approx0.13/\\nu\\sigma_{\\theta}, \\] where $\\omega_{0}=2\\pi/T_{0}$\ndenotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic excess kurtosis\ntends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a quasi-equilibrium state\ncharacterized with nonlinearities mainly due to bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant\ninteractions are dominant only in unidirectional or long-crested seas where the\nlonger-time dynamic kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound\nharmonics, especially as the Benjamin-Feir index increases. Finally, we discuss\nthe implication of these results on the prediction of rogue waves.\n", "  We characterize single qubit Clifford gate operations with randomized\nbenchmarking in a 2D array of neutral atom qubits, and demonstrate global and\nsite selected gates with high fidelity. An average fidelity of $F^2=0.9983(14)$\nis measured for global microwave driven gates applied to a 49 qubit array.\n  Single site gates are implemented with a focused laser beam to Stark shift\nthe microwaves into resonance at a selected site. At Stark selected single\nsites we observe $F^2=0.9923(7)$ and an average spin flip crosstalk error at\nother sites of $0.002(9)$.\n", "  We consider the problem of numerically solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith a potential that is quasi periodic in space and time. We introduce a\nnumerical scheme based on a newly developed multi-time scale and averaging\ntechnique. We demonstrate that with this novel method we can solve efficiently\nand with rigorous control of the error such an equation for long times. A\ncomparison with the standard split-step method shows substantial improvement in\ncomputation times, besides the controlled errors. We apply this method for a\nfree particle driven by quasi-periodic potential with many frequencies. The new\nmethod makes it possible to evolve the Schrodinger equation for times much\nlonger than was possible so far and to conclude that there are regimes where\nthe energy growth stops in-spite of the driving.\n", "  The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment has observed the disappearance of\nelectron antineutrinos from nuclear reactors at $\\sim$kilometer baselines. The\nrelative measurement of the $\\bar\\nu_e$ rate and spectrum between near and far\ndetectors allows for a precision measurement of the oscillation parameters\n$\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$ and $|\\Delta{m}^2_{ee}|$. Two new antineutrino detectors\n(ADs) were installed in summer 2012, bringing the experiment to the final 8-AD\nconfiguration. With 621 days of data, Daya Bay has measured $\\sin^22\\theta_{13}\n= 0.084 \\pm 0.005$ and $|\\Delta{m}^2_{ee}| = 2.44^{+0.10}_{-0.11} \\times\n10^{-3}$ eV$^2$. This is the most precise measurement of $\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$\nto date and the most precise measurement of $|\\Delta{m}^2_{ee}|$ in this\nchannel. Several other analyses are also performed, including an independent\nmeasurement of $\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$ using $\\bar\\nu_e$ samples tagged by neutron\ncapture on hydrogen, a search for light sterile neutrinos, and a measurement of\nthe absolute reactor antineutrino flux.\n", "  The Planck full mission cosmic microwave background(CMB) temperature and\nE-mode polarization maps are analysed to obtain constraints on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity(NG). Using three classes of optimal bispectrum estimators -\nseparable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and modal - we obtain consistent\nvalues for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes,\nquoting as our final result from temperature alone fNL^local=2.5+\\-5.7,\nfNL^equil=-16+\\-70 and fNL^ortho=-34+\\-33(68%CL). Combining temperature and\npolarization data we obtain fNL^local=0.8+\\-5.0, fNL^equil=-4+\\-43 and\nfNL^ortho=-26+\\-21 (68%CL). The results are based on cross-validation of these\nestimators on simulations, are stable across component separation techniques,\npass an extensive suite of tests, and are consistent with Minkowski functionals\nbased measurements. The effect of time-domain de-glitching systematics on the\nbispectrum is negligible. In spite of these test outcomes we conservatively\nlabel the results including polarization data as preliminary, owing to a known\nmismatch of the noise model in simulations and the data. Beyond fNL estimates,\nwe present model-independent reconstructions of the CMB bispectrum and derive\nconstraints on early universe scenarios that generate NG, including general\nsingle-field and axion inflation, initial state modifications, parity-violating\ntensor bispectra, and directionally dependent vector models. We also present a\nwide survey of scale-dependent oscillatory bispectra, and we look for\nisocurvature NG. Our constraint on the local primordial trispectrum amplitude\nis gNL^local=(-9.0+\\-7.7)x10^4 (68%CL), and we perform an analysis of\nadditional trispectrum shapes. The global picture is one of consistency with\nthe premises of the LambdaCDM cosmology, namely that the structure we observe\ntoday was sourced by adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed\nperturbations.[abridged]\n", "  In this paper, we present an explicit formula that connects the\nKontsevich-Witten tau-function and the Hodge tau-function by differential\noperators belonging to the $\\hat{GL(\\infty)}$ group. Indeed, we show that the\ntwo tau-functions can be connected using Virasoro operators. This proves a\nconjecture posted by Alexandrov in [1].\n", "  Interference effects in quantum dots between different transport channels can\nlead to a strong suppression of conductance, which cuts like a canyon through\nthe common conductance plot [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 186804 (2010)]. In the\npresent work, we consider the thermoelectric transport properties of the canyon\nof conductance suppression using the second-order von Neumann approach. We\nobserve a characteristic signal for the zeros of the thermopower. This\ndemonstrates that thermoelectric measurements are an interesting complimentary\ntool to study complex phenomena for transport through confined systems.\n", "  The superconductor at the LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interface provides a model system for\nthe study of two-dimensional superconductivity in the dilute carrier density\nlimit. Here we experimentally address the pairing mechanism in this\nsuperconductor. We extract the electron-phonon spectral function from tunneling\nspectra and conclude, without ruling out contributions of further pairing\nchannels, that electron-phonon mediated pairing is strong enough to account for\nthe superconducting critical temperatures. Furthermore, we discuss the\nelectron-phonon coupling in relation to the superconducting phase diagram. The\nelectron-phonon spectral function is independent of the carrier density, except\nfor a small part of the phase diagram in the underdoped region. The tunneling\nmeasurements reveal that the increase of the chemical potential with increasing\ncarrier density levels off and is zero in the overdoped region of the phase\ndiagram. This indicates that the additionally induced carriers do not populate\nthe band that hosts the superconducting state and that the superconducting\norder parameter therefore is weakened by the presence of charge carriers in\nanother band.\n", "  We explore the phase behavior and structure of orthogonal smectic liquid\ncrystals consisting of bent-core molecules (BCMs) by means of Monte Carlo\nmolecular simulations. A simple athermal molecular model is introduced that\ndescribes the basic features of the BCMs. Phase transitions between uniaxial\nand biaxial (antiferroelectric) orthogonal smectics are obtained. The results\nindicate the presence of local in-plane polar correlations in the uniaxial\nsmectic phase. The macroscopic uniaxial-biaxial transformation is rationalized\nin terms of local polar correlations giving rise to polar domains. The size of\nthese polar domains grows larger under the action of an external vector field\nand their internal ordering is enhanced, leading to field-induced biaxial\norder-disorder transitions.\n", "  In this paper for studying the anisotropic strange quark stars, we assume\nthat the radial pressure inside the anisotropic star is a superposition of\npressure in an isotropic case plus a Gaussian perturbation term. Considering a\nproportionality between electric charge density and the density of matter, we\nsolve the TOV equation for different cases numerically. Our results indicate\nthat anisotropy increases the maximum mass $M_{max}$ and also its corresponding\nradius $R$ for a typical strange quark star. According to our calculations, an\nanisotropy amplitude of $A=3\\times10^{33}Nm^{-2}$ with a standard deviation of\n$\\sigma=3\\times10^{3}m$ leads to a neutron star of 1.97$M_{\\odot}$.\nFurthermore, electric charge not only increases the maximum mass and its\ncorresponding radius, but also raises up the anisotropy factor. We can see that\nthe tangential pressure $p_{t}$ and anisotropy factor $\\Delta$ unlike the\nradial pressure $p_{r}$ have a maximum on the surface and this maximum\nincreases by adding electric charge effect. However, we show that anisotropy\ncan be more effective than electric charge in rasing maximum mass of strange\nquark stars.\n", "  We introduce the notion of time reversal in open quantum systems as\nrepresented by linear quantum operations, and a related generalization of\nclassical entropy production in the environment. This functional is the ratio\nof the probability to observe a transition between two states under the forward\nand the time reversed dynamics, and leads, as in the classical case, to\nfluctuation relations as tautological identities. As in classical dynamics in\ncontact with a heat bath, time reversal is not unique, and we discuss several\npossibilities. For any bistochastic map its dual map preserves the trace and\ndescribes a legitimate dynamics reversed in time, in that case the entropy\nproduction in the environment vanishes. For a generic stochastic map we\nconstruct a simple quantum operation which can be interpreted as a time\nreversal. For instance, the decaying channel, which sends the excited state\ninto the ground state with a certain probability, can be reversed into the\nchannel transforming the ground state into the excited state with the same\nprobability.\n", "  We show that the so-called flat-space rotational Killing vector method for\nmeasuring the Cartesian components of a black hole spin can be derived from the\nsurface integral of Weinberg's pseudotensor over the apparent horizon surface\nwhen using Gaussian normal coordinates in the integration. Moreover, the\nintegration of the pseudotensor in this gauge yields the Komar angular momentum\nintegral in a foliation adapted to the axisymmetry of the spacetime. As a\nresult, the method does not explicitly depend on the evolved lapse $\\alpha$ and\nshift $\\beta^i$ on the respective timeslice, as they are fixed to Gaussian\nnormal coordinates, while leaving the coordinate labels of the spatial metric\n$\\gamma_{ij}$ and the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$ unchanged. Such gauge fixing\nendows the method with coordinate invariance, which is not present in integral\nexpressions using Weinberg's pseudotensor, as they normally rely on the\nexplicit use of Cartesian coordinates.\n", "  Structure and dynamics at soft-matter interfaces play an important role in\nnature and technical applications. Optical single-molecule investigations are\nnon-invasive and capable to reveal heterogeneities at the nanoscale. In this\nwork we develop an autocorrelation function (ACF) approach to retrieve tracer\ndiffusion parameters obtained from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)\nexperiments in thin liquid films at reflecting substrates. This approach then\nis used to investigate structure and dynamics in 100 nm thick 8CB liquid\ncrystal films on silicon wafers with five different oxide thicknesses. We find\na different extension of the structural reorientation of 8CB at the\nsolid-liquid interface for thin and for thick oxide. For the thin oxides, the\nperylenediimide tracer diffusion dynamics in general agrees with the\nhydrodynamic modeling using no-slip boundary conditions with only a small\ndeviation close to the substrate, while a considerably stronger decrease of the\ninterfacial tracer diffusion is found for the thick oxides.\n", "  Quantum systems allow one to sense physical parameters beyond the reach of\nclassical statistics---with resolutions greater than $1/N$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of constituent particles independently probing a parameter. In the\ncanonical phase sensing scenario the \\emph{Heisenberg Limit} $1/N^{2}$ may be\nreached, which requires, as we show, both the relative size of the largest\nentangled block and the geometric measure of entanglement to be nonvanishing as\n$N\\to\\infty$. Yet, we also demonstrate that in the asymptotic $N$ limit any\nprecision scaling arbitrarily close to the Heisenberg Limit\n($1/N^{2-\\varepsilon}$ with any $\\varepsilon>0$) may be attained, even though\nthe system gradually becomes noisier and separable, so that both the above\nentanglement quantifiers asymptotically vanish. Our work shows that\nsufficiently large quantum systems achieve nearly optimal resolutions despite\ntheir relative amount of entanglement being arbitrarily small. In deriving our\nresults, we establish the continuity relation of the quantum Fisher information\nevaluated for a phaselike parameter, which lets us link it directly to the\ngeometry of quantum states, and hence naturally to the geometric measure of\nentanglement.\n", "  We connect between the problem of thermodynamics of localized magnetic\nmoments in a Dirac semimetal, the interaction with relativistic electrons\nleading to the effective ferromagnetic exchange between the moments, and the\nexisting theories dealing with long--range exchange interaction. We point out\nthat the results of high--temperature expansion for the free energy of a dilute\nensemble of magnetic impurities in the semimetal performed by V. Cheianov et\nal. (Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 86}, 054424 (2012)) give an indication to the existence\nof a new disordered fixed point in such model.\n", "  Navigability, an ability to find a logarithmically short path between\nelements using only local information, is one of the most fascinating\nproperties of real-life networks. However, the exact mechanism responsible for\nthe formation of navigation properties remained unknown. We show that\nnavigability can be achieved by using only two ingredients present in the\nmajority of networks: network growth and local homophily, giving a persuasive\nanswer how the navigation appears in real-life networks. A very simple\nalgorithm produces hierarchical self-similar optimally wired navigable small\nworld networks with exponential degree distribution by using only local\ninformation. Adding preferential attachment produces a scale-free network which\nhas shorter greedy paths, but worse (power law) scaling of the information\nextraction locality (algorithmic complexity of a search). Introducing\nsaturation of the preferential attachment leads to truncated scale-free degree\ndistribution that offers a good tradeoff between these parameters and can be\nuseful for practical applications. Several features of the model are observed\nin real-life networks, in particular in the brain neural networks, supporting\nthe earlier suggestions that they are navigable.\n", "  An unexpected wave is defined by Gemmrich & Garrett (2008) as a wave that is\nmuch taller than a set of neighboring waves. Their definition of \"unexpected\"\nrefers to a wave that is not anticipated by a casual observer. Clearly,\nunexpected waves defined in this way are predictable in a statistical sense.\nThey can occur relatively often with a small or moderate crest height, but\nlarge unexpected waves that are rogue are rare. Here, this concept is\nelaborated and statistically described based on a third-order nonlinear model.\nIn particular, the conditional return period of an unexpected wave whose crest\nexceeds a given threshold is developed. This definition leads to greater return\nperiods or on average less frequent occurrences of unexpected waves than those\nimplied by the conventional return periods not conditioned on a reference\nthreshold. Ultimately, it appears that a rogue wave that is also unexpected\nwould have a lower occurrence frequency than that of a usual rogue wave. As\nspecific applications, the Andrea and WACSIS rogue wave events are examined in\ndetail. Both waves appeared without warning and their crests were nearly\n$2$-times larger than the surrounding $O(10)$ wave crests, and thus unexpected.\nThe two crest heights are nearly the same as the\nthreshold~$h_{0.3\\cdot10^{6}}\\sim1.6H_{s}$ exceeded on average once\nevery~$0.3\\cdot 10^{6}$ waves, where $H_s$ is the significant wave height. In\ncontrast, the Andrea and WACSIS events, as both rogue and unexpected, would\noccur slightly less often and on average once every~$3\\cdot10^{6}$\nand~$0.6\\cdot10^6$ waves respectively.\n", "  We present the general flux tube integrand for MHV and non-MHV amplitudes, in\nplanar N = 4 SYM theory, up to a group theoretical rational factor. We find\nthat the MHV and non-MHV cases only differ by simple form factors which we\nderive. This information allows us to run the operator product expansion\nprogram for all sorts of non-MHV amplitudes and to test the recently proposed\nmap with the so called charged pentagons transitions. Perfect agreement is\nfound, on a large sample of non-MHV amplitudes, with the perturbative data\navailable in the literature.\n", "  We present new results for the SU(3) \"sextet model\" with two flavors\ntransforming according to the two-index symmetric representation of the gauge\ngroup. The simulations are performed using unimproved Wilson fermions. We\nmeasure the meson and baryon spectrum of the theory for multiple bare quark\nmasses at two different lattice spacings. To address the pressing issue of\nwhether the model is inside or below the conformal window, we compare the\nspectrum to the expectations for a theory with spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking and to those of an IR conformal theory. Regardless of the answer\n(conformal or chirally broken), the theory is a cornerstone in our\nunderstanding of near-conformal and composite dynamics, ranging from\nTechnicolor models to unparticle physics. It is also interesting for the\ncomposite dynamics of vector-like singlets with respect to the Standard Model\ninteractions.\n", "  We calculate interspecies Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strengths for the heavy\nalkalis Rb and Cs. The presence of strong F\\\"orster resonances makes\ninterspecies coupling a promising approach for long range entanglement\ngeneration. We also provide an overview of the strongest F\\\"orster resonances\nfor Rb-Rb and Cs-Cs using different principal quantum numbers for the two\natoms. We show how interspecies coupling can be used for high fidelity quantum\nnon demolition state measurements with low crosstalk in qubit arrays.\n", "  The conical function and its relativistic generalization can be viewed as\neigenfunctions of the reduced 2-particle Hamiltonians of the hyperbolic\nCalogero-Moser system and its relativistic generalization. We prove new product\nformulas for these functions. As a consequence, we arrive at explicit\ndiagonalizations of integral operators that commute with the 2-particle\nHamiltonians and reduced versions thereof. The kernels of the integral\noperators are expressed as integrals over products of the eigenfunctions and\nexplicit weight functions. The nonrelativistic limits are controlled by\ninvoking novel uniform limit estimates for the hyperbolic gamma function.\n", "  Sources of photon pairs based on the spontaneous parametric down conversion\nprocess are commonly used for long distance quantum communication. The key\nfeature for improving the range of transmission is engineering their spectral\nproperties. Following two experimental papers [Opt. Lett., 38, 697 (2013)] and\n[Opt. Lett., 39, 1481 (2014)] we analytically and numerically analyze the\ncharacteristics of a source. It is based on a $\\beta$-barium borate (BBO)\ncrystal cut for type II phase matching at the degenerated frequencies 755 nm\n$\\rightarrow$ 1550 nm + 1550 nm. Our analysis shows a way for full control of\nspectral correlation within a fiber-coupled photon pair simultaneously with\noptimal brightness.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT-10b, the first transiting exoplanet\ndiscovered using the KELT-South telescope. KELT-10b is a highly inflated\nsub-Jupiter mass planet transiting a relatively bright $V = 10.7$ star (TYC\n8378-64-1), with T$_{eff}$ = $5948\\pm74$ K, $\\log{g}$ =\n$4.319_{-0.030}^{+0.020}$ and [Fe/H] = $0.09_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$, an inferred mass\nM$_{*}$ = $1.112_{-0.061}^{+0.055}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and radius R$_{*}$ =\n$1.209_{-0.035}^{+0.047}$ R$_{\\odot}$. The planet has a radius R$_{P}$ =\n$1.399_{-0.049}^{+0.069}$ R$_{J}$ and mass M$_{P}$ = $0.679_{-0.038}^{+0.039}$\nM$_{J}$. The planet has an eccentricity consistent with zero and a semi-major\naxis $a$ = $0.05250_{-0.00097}^{+0.00086}$ AU. The best fitting linear\nephemeris is $T_{0}$ = 2457066.72045$\\pm$0.00027 BJD$_{TDB}$ and P =\n4.1662739$\\pm$0.0000063 days. This planet joins a group of highly inflated\ntransiting exoplanets with a radius much larger and a mass much less than those\nof Jupiter. The planet, which boasts deep transits of 1.4%, has a relatively\nhigh equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = $1377_{-23}^{+28}$ K, assuming zero\nalbedo and perfect heat redistribution. KELT-10b receives an estimated\ninsolation of $0.817_{-0.054}^{+0.068}$ $\\times$ 10$^9$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,\nwhich places it far above the insolation threshold above which hot Jupiters\nexhibit increasing amounts of radius inflation. Evolutionary analysis of the\nhost star suggests that KELT-10b is unlikely to survive beyond the current\nsubgiant phase, due to a concomitant in-spiral of the planet over the next\n$\\sim$1 Gyr. The planet transits a relatively bright star and exhibits the\nthird largest transit depth of all transiting exoplanets with V $<$ 11 in the\nsouthern hemisphere, making it a promising candidate for future atmospheric\ncharacterization studies.\n", "  The shock instability phenomenon is a famous problem for the shock-capturing\nscheme. By subdividing the numerical dissipation of the Roe scheme, the term of\npressure-difference-driven modification for the cell face velocity is regarded\nas a version of the momentum interpolation method (MIM), which is necessary for\nincompressible flows to suppress the pressure checkerboard problem. Through the\nanalysis and odd-even decoupling test, it is discovered that MIM plays the most\nimportant role on the shock instability. In fact, for non-linear flows MIM\nshould be completely removed, but unexpected MIM is activated on the cell face\nnearly parallel to the flow for high Mach number flows or low Mach number flows\nin shock. For such conditions, two coefficients are designed based on local\nMach number and a shock detector, respectively, and then the improved Roe\nscheme is proposed, which gives consideration to requirement of MIM for\nincompressible and compressible flows and is validated for good performance of\navoiding odd-even decoupling. Therefore, the aim of decreasing rather than\nincreasing numerical dissipation to cure the shock instability can be achieved.\n", "  As the representative of the shock-capturing scheme, the Roe scheme fails to\nLES because important turbulent characteristics cannot be reproduced such as\nthe famous k-5/3 spectral law owing to large numerical dissipation. In this\npaper, the Roe scheme is divided into five parts: , , , , and , which means\nbasic upwind dissipation, pressure-difference-driven and\nvelocity-difference-driven modification of the interface fluxes and pressure,\nrespectively. Then, the role of each part on LES is investigated by homogeneous\ndecaying turbulence. The results show that the parts , , and have little effect\non LES. It is important especially for because it is necessary for computation\nstability. The large numerical dissipation is due to and , and each of them has\nmuch larger dissipation than SGS dissipation. According to these understanding,\nan improved all-speed LES-Roe scheme is proposed, which can give enough good\nLES results for even coarse grid resolution with usually adopted\nreconstruction.\n", "  The Casimir effect for parallel plates satisfying the Dirichlet boundary\ncondition in the context of effective QED coming from a six-dimensional\nNielsen-Olesen vortex solution of the Abelian Higgs model with fermions coupled\nto gravity is studied at finite temperature. We find that the sign of the\nCasimir energy remains negative under the thermal influence. It is also shown\nthat the Casimir force between plates will be weaker in the higher-temperature\nsurroundings while keeps attractive. This Casimir effect involving the thermal\ninfluence is still inconsistent with the known experiments. We find that the\nthermal correction can not compensate or even reduce the modification from this\nkind of vortex model to make the Casimir force to be in less conflict with the\nmeasurements.\n", "  Spin models are the prime example of simplified manybody Hamiltonians used to\nmodel complex, real-world strongly correlated materials. However, despite their\nsimplified character, their dynamics often cannot be simulated exactly on\nclassical computers as soon as the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For\nthis reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of\natomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using\nultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of these\napproaches have their own assets, but also limitations. Here, we report on a\nnovel platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in\ntwo-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where\nfilling fractions range from 60 to 100% with exact knowledge of the initial\nconfiguration. When excited to Rydberg D-states, the atoms undergo strong\ninteractions whose anisotropic character opens exciting prospects for\nsimulating exotic matter. We illustrate the versatility of our system by\nstudying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field\nwith up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions,\nand for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the\nanisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement\nwith ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly\nanisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a\nmeasurable influence. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as\na versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism.\n", "  We present an approach enabling generation of narrow spin wave beams in thin\nhomogeneous ferromagnetic films. The main idea is to match the wave vector of\nthe spin wave with that corresponding to the spectral maximum of the exciting\nmicrowave magnetic field only locally, in the region of space from which the\nbeam should be launched. We show that this can be achieved with the aid of a\nproperly designed coplanar waveguide transducer generating a nonuniform\nmicrowave magnetic field. The resulting two-dimensional spin wave beams\nobtained in micromagnetic simulations propagate over distances of several\nmicrometers. The proposed approach requires neither inhomogeneity of the\nferromagnetic film nor nonuniformity of the biasing magnetic field, and it can\nbe generalized to yield multiple spin wave beams of different width at the same\nfrequency. Other possible excitation scenarios and applications of spin wave\nbeam magnonics are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate unitary operators acting on a tensor product space, with the\nproperty that the quantum channels they generate, via the Stinespring dilation\ntheorem, are of a particular type, independently of the state of the ancilla\nsystem in the Stinespring relation. The types of quantum channels we consider\nare those of interest in quantum information theory: unitary conjugations,\nconstant channels, unital channels, mixed unitary channels, PPT channels, and\nentanglement breaking channels. For some of the classes of bipartite unitary\noperators corresponding to the above types of channels, we provide explicit\ncharacterizations, necessary and/or sufficient conditions for membership, and\nwe compute the dimension of the corresponding algebraic variety. Inclusions\nbetween these classes are considered, and we show that for small dimensions,\nmany of these sets are identical.\n", "  We use the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G) 3.6\n$\\mu$m imaging to study the properties (length and strength) and fraction of\nbars at $z=0$. We use the maximum of tangential-to-radial force ratio in the\nbar region ($Q_{\\rm b}$) as a measure of the bar induced perturbation strength\nfor a sample of $\\sim 600$ barred galaxies. Bars are also characterized from\nthe maximum of the normalized m=2 Fourier density amplitude ($A_{2}^{\\rm max}$)\nand the bar maximum isophotal ellipticity ($\\varepsilon$). Combining our force\ncalculations with the HI kinematics from the literature we get an estimate of\nthe halo-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\\rm h}/M_{\\ast}$) within the optical disk,\nwhich are in good agreement with studies based on weak lensing analysis,\nabundance matching and halo occupation distribution methods. By further using\nthe Universal Rotation Curve models we obtain a first-order model of the\nrotation curve decomposition of $1128$ disk galaxies. We find that the dilution\nof $Q_{\\rm b}$ by the halo becomes important for later types, implying $\\sim\n20-25\\%$ reduction for $T = 7-10$. Whether the halo correction is included or\nnot, the mean $Q_{\\rm b}$ shows an increasing trend with $T$. Late-type bars\nare longer than previously found in the literature. We find possible evidence\nfor the growth of bars within a Hubble time, as (1) bars in early-type galaxies\nshow larger density amplitudes and disk-relative sizes than their\nintermediate-type counterparts, and (2) long bars are typically strong. We also\nobserve two clearly distinct types of bars, between early and intermediate-type\ngalaxies ($T<5$) on one side, and the late-type systems on the other, based on\nthe differences in the bar properties. Most likely this distinction is\nconnected to the larger halo-to-stellar ratio that we observe in later types,\naffecting the disk stability properties (Abridged).\n", "  Water is a life-giving source, fundamental to human existence, yet, over a\nbillion people lack access to clean drinking water. Present techniques for\nwater treatment such as piped, treated water rely on time and resource\nintensive centralized solutions. In this work, we propose a decentralized\ndevice concept that can utilize sunlight to split water into hydrogen and\nhydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide can oxidize organics while the\nhydrogen bubbles out. In enabling this device, we require an electrocatalyst\nthat can oxidize water while suppressing the thermodynamically favored oxygen\nevolution and form hydrogen peroxide. Using density functional theory\ncalculations, we show that the free energy of adsorbed OH$^*$ can be used as a\ndescriptor to screen for selectivity trends between the 2e$^-$ water oxidation\nto H$_2$O$_2$ and the 4e$^-$ oxidation to O$_2$. We show that materials that\nbind oxygen intermediates sufficiently weakly, such as SnO$_2$, can activate\nhydrogen peroxide evolution. We present a rational design principle for the\nselectivity in electrochemical water oxidation and identify new material\ncandidates that could perform H$_2$O$_2$ evolution selectively.\n", "  We show that the regular Slodowy slice to the sum of two semisimple adjoint\norbits of $GL(n,C)$ is isomorphic to the deformation of the $D_2$-singularity\nif $n=2$, the Dancer deformation of the double cover of the Atiyah-Hitchin\nmanifold if $n=3$, and to the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold itself if $n=4$. For\nhigher $n$, such slices to the sum of two orbits, each having only two distinct\neigenvalues, are either empty or biholomorphic to open subsets of the Hilbert\nscheme of points on of one the above surfaces. In particular, these open\nsubsets of Hilbert schemes of points carry complete hyperk\\\"ahler metrics. In\nthe case of the double cover of the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold this turns out to\nbe the natural $L^2$-metric on a hyperk\\\"ahler submanifold of the monopole\nmoduli space.\n", "  We derive the John-Sclavounos equations describing the motion of a fluid\nparticle on the sea surface from first principles using Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian formalisms applied to the motion of a frictionless particle\nconstrained on an unsteady surface. The main result is that vorticity generated\non a stress-free surface vanishes at a wave crest when the horizontal particle\nvelocity equals the crest propagation speed, which is the kinematic criterion\nfor wave breaking. If this holds for the largest crest, then the symplectic\ntwo-form associated with the Hamiltonian dynamics reduces instantaneously to\nthat associated with the motion of a particle in free flight, as if the surface\ndid not exist. Further, exploiting the conservation of the Hamiltonian function\nfor steady surfaces and traveling waves we show that particle velocities remain\nbounded at all times, ruling out the possibility of the finite-time blowup of\nsolutions.\n", "  We present a simplified molecular model of mesogenic dimers consisting of two\nidentical uniaxial mesogenic cores separated by a fixed-length spacer and\nallowed to assume only two, statistically equivalent, conformations which are\nnon-planar and of opposite handedness. In the mean-field approximation, with\nadditive interactions among the mesogenic cores, the model yields up to three\npositionally disordered phases, one isotropic and two nematic. The low\ntemperature nematic phase ($\\mathrm{N_X}$) has a local two-fold symmetry axis\nwhich is also a direction of molecular polar ordering and is tightly twisted\nabout a macroscopic phase axis. The onset of polar ordering generates\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, manifested primarily by the twisting of\nthe polar director and the formation of chiral domains of opposite handedness.\nWithin these domains the statistical balance between the two enantiomer\nconformations is shifted and the principal axes of the ordering tensors of the\nmolecular segments twist at constant tilt angles with the helix axis. Key\nexperimental results on the $\\mathrm{N_X}$ phase of liquid crystalline dimers\nare discussed in the light of the theoretical predictions of the model, which\nare also contrasted with the predictions of the twist-bend nematic model.\n", "  The last glacial period was punctuated by a series of abrupt climate shifts,\nthe so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. The frequency of DO events varied\nin time, supposedly because of changes in background climate conditions. Here,\nthe influence of external forcings on DO events is investigated with\nstatistical modelling. We assume two types of simple stochastic dynamical\nsystems models (double-well potential-type and oscillator-type), forced by the\nnorthern hemisphere summer insolation change and/or the global ice volume\nchange. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood\nmethod with the NGRIP Ca$^{2+}$ record. The stochastic oscillator model with at\nleast the ice volume forcing reproduces well the sample autocorrelation\nfunction of the record and the frequency changes of warming transitions in the\nlast glacial period across MISs 2, 3, and 4. The model performance is improved\nwith the additional insolation forcing. The BIC scores also suggest that the\nice volume forcing is relatively more important than the insolation forcing,\nthough the strength of evidence depends on the model assumption. Finally, we\nsimulate the average number of warming transitions in the past four glacial\nperiods, assuming the model can be extended beyond the last glacial, and\ncompare the result with an Iberian margin sea-surface temperature (SST) record\n(Martrat et al., Science, vol. 317, p. 502, 2007). The simulation result\nsupports the previous observation that abrupt millennial-scale climate changes\nin the penultimate glacial (MIS 6) are less frequent than in the last glacial\n(MISs 2-4). On the other hand, it suggests that the number of abrupt\nmillennial-scale climate changes in older glacial periods (MISs 6, 8, and 10)\nmight be larger than inferred from the SST record.\n", "  The access to an ever increasing amount of information in the modern world\ngave rise to the development of many quantitative indicators about urban\nregions in the globe. Therefore, there is a growing need for a precise\ndefinition of how to delimit urban regions, so as to allow proper respective\ncharacterization and modeling. Here we present a straightforward methodology to\nautomatically detect urban region borders around a single seed point. The\nmethod is based on a diffusion process having street crossings and terminations\nas source points. We exemplify the potential of the methodology by\ncharacterizing the geometry and topology of 21 urban regions obtained from 8\ndistinct countries. The geometry is studied by employing the lacunarity\nmeasurement, which is associated to the regularity of holes contained in a\npattern. The topology is analyzed by associating the betweenness centrality of\nthe streets with their respective class, such as motorway or residential,\nobtained from a database.\n", "  Laser-induced magnetization precessional dynamics was investigated in\nepitaxial films of Mn$_3$Ge, which is a tetragonal Heusler-like nearly\ncompensated ferrimagnet. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) mode was observed,\nthe precession frequency for which exceeded 0.5 THz and originated from the\nlarge magnetic anisotropy field of approximately 200 kOe for this ferrimagnet.\nThe effective damping constant was approximately 0.03. The corresponding\neffective Landau-Lifshitz constant of approximately 60 Mrad/s and is comparable\nto those of the similar Mn-Ga materials. The physical mechanisms for the\nGilbert damping and for the laser-induced excitation of the FMR mode were also\ndiscussed in terms of the spin-orbit-induced damping and the laser-induced\nultrafast modulation of the magnetic anisotropy, respectively.\n", "  In terms of a rephasing invariant parametrization, the set of renormalization\ngroup equations (RGE) for Dirac neutrino parameters can be cast in a compact\nand simple form. These equations exhibit manifest symmetry under flavor\npermutations. We obtain both exact and approximate RGE invariants, in addition\nto some approximate solutions and examples of numerical solutions.\n", "  We study global symmetry groups of six-dimensional superconformal field\ntheories (SCFTs). In the Coulomb branch we use field theoretical arguments to\npredict an upper bound for the global symmetry of the SCFT. We then analyze\nglobal symmetry groups of F-theory constructions of SCFTs with a\none-dimensional Coulomb branch. While in the vast majority of cases, all of the\nglobal symmetries allowed by our Coulomb branch analysis can be realized in\nF-theory, in a handful of cases we find that F-theory models fail to realize\nthe full symmetry of the theory on the Coulomb branch. In one particularly\nmysterious case, F-theory models realize several distinct maximal subgroups of\nthe predicted group, but not the predicted group itself.\n", "  Tunneling is often claimed to be the key mechanism underlying possible\nspeedups in quantum optimization via quantum annealing (QA), especially for\nproblems featuring a cost function with tall and thin barriers. We present and\nanalyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight\noptimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for\nthese problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be\nunderstood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical\npotential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then\nprovide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is\nshort and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where\ntunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime.\nHowever, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution\ninvolving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided\nlevel-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic\nQA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not\nunique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an\nexponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a\nclassical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic\nQA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic\ntransitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling\nand classical spin vector dynamics.\n", "  Ultra strong electromagnetic fields can lead to spontaneous creation of\nsingle or multiple electron-positron pairs. A quantum field theoretical\ntreatment of the pair creation process combined with numerical methods provides\na description of the fermionic quantum field state, from which all observables\nof the multiple electron-positron pairs can be inferred. This allows to study\nthe complex multi-particle dynamics of electron-positron pair creation\nin-depth, including multi-pair statistics as well as momentum distributions and\nspin. To illustrate the potential benefit of this approach, it is applied to\nthe intermediate regime of pair creation between nonperturbative Schwinger pair\ncreation and perturbative multiphoton pair creation where the creation of\nmulti-pair states becomes nonnegligible but cascades do not yet set in.\nFurthermore, it is demonstrated how spin and helicity of the created electrons\nand positrons are affected by the polarization of the counterpropagating laser\nfields, which induce the creation of electron-positron pairs.\n", "  Inspired by a significance of $2.4\\sigma$ in $h\\to \\mu \\tau$ decay observed\nby CMS at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, we investigate the Higgs lepton flavor violating\neffects in the generic two-Higgs-doublet model (GTHDM), where the lepton flavor\nchanging neutral currents are induced at tree level and arisen from Yukawa\nsector. We revisit the constraints for GTHDM by considering theoretical\nrequirements, precision measurements of $\\delta \\rho$ and oblique parameters\n$S$, $T$, $U$ and Higgs measurements. The bounds from Higgs data now play the\nmajor role. With the values of parameters that simultaneously satisfy the Higgs\nbounds and the excess of Higgs coupling to $\\mu$-$\\tau$ at CMS, we find that\nthe tree-level $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$ and loop-induced $\\tau\\to \\mu \\gamma$ could be\nconsistent with current experimental upper limits; the discrepancy in muon\n$g-2$ between experiment and standard model prediction could be solved; and an\ninteresting relation between muon $g-2$ and branching ratio (BR) for $\\mu\\to e\n\\gamma$ is found. The GTHM results that the ratio $BR(h\\to e\\tau)/BR(h\\to \\mu\n\\tau)$ should be smaller than $10^{-4}$ in order of magnitude. Additionally, we\nalso study the rare decay $Z\\to \\mu \\tau$ and get $BR(Z\\to \\mu\\tau)< 10^{-6}$.\n", "  We show that there exists an underlying manifold with a conformal metric and\ncompatible connection form, and a metric type Hamiltonian (which we call the\ngeometrical picture) that can be put into correspondence with the usual\nHamilton-Lagrange mechanics. The requirement of dynamical equivalence of the\ntwo types of Hamiltonians, that the momenta generated by the two pictures be\nequal for all times, is sufficient to determine an expansion of the conformal\nfactor, defined on the geometrical coordinate representation, in its domain of\nanalyticity with coefficients to all orders determined by functions of the\npotential of the Hamilton-Lagrange picture, defined on the Hamilton-Lagrange\ncoordinate representation, and its derivatives. Conversely, if the conformal\nfunction is known, the potential of a Hamilton-Lagrange picture can be\ndetermined in a similar way. We show that arbitrary local variations of the\norbits in the Hamilton-Lagrange picture can be generated by variations along\ngeodesics in the geometrical picture and establish a correspondence which\nprovides a basis for understanding how the instability in the geometrical\npicture is manifested in the instability of the original Hamiltonian motion.\n", "  The recently proposed relaxion models require extremely large trans-Planckian\naxion excursions as well as a potential explicitly violating the axion shift\nsymmetry. The latter property is however inconsistent with the axion\nperiodicity, which corresponds to a gauged discrete shift symmetry. A way to\nmake things consistent is to use monodromy, i.e. both the axion and the\npotential parameters transform under the discrete shift symmetry. The structure\nis better described in terms of a 3-form field $C_{\\mu \\nu \\rho}$ coupling to\nthe SM Higgs through its field strength $F_4$. The 4-form also couples linearly\nto the relaxion, in the Kaloper-Sorbo fashion. The extremely small\nrelaxion-Higgs coupling arises in a see-saw fashion as $g\\simeq F_4/f$, with\n$f$ being the axion decay constant. We discuss constraints on this type of\nconstructions from membrane nucleation and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The\nlatter requires the existence of membranes, whose too fast nucleation could in\nprinciple drive the theory out of control, unless the cut-off scale is lowered.\nThis allows to constrain relaxion models on purely theoretical grounds. We also\ndiscuss possible avenues to embed this structure into string theory.\n", "  The quantum entanglement of many states of matter can be represented by\nelectric and magnetic fields, much like those found in Maxwell's theory. These\nfields \"emerge\" from the quantum structure of the many-electron state, rather\nthan being fundamental degrees of freedom of the vacuum. I review basic aspects\nof the theory of emergent gauge fields in insulators in an intuitive manner. In\nmetals, Fermi liquid theory relies on adiabatic continuity from the free\nelectron state, and its central consequence is the existence of long-lived\nelectron-like quasiparticles around a Fermi surface enclosing a volume\ndetermined by the total density of electrons, via the Luttinger theorem.\nHowever long-range entanglement and emergent gauge fields can also be present\nin metals. I focus on the \"fractionalized Fermi liquid\" (FL*) state, which also\nhas long-lived electron-like quasiparticles around a Fermi surface; however the\nLuttinger theorem on the Fermi volume is violated, and this requires the\npresence of emergent gauge fields, and the associated loss of adiabatic\ncontinuity to the free electron state. Finally, I present a brief survey of\nsome recent experiments in the hole-doped cuprate superconductors, and\ninterpret the properties of the pseudogap regime in the framework of the FL*\ntheory.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of two-dimensional short-range quantum spin\nglasses by numerical simulations. Using a parallel tempering algorithm, we\ncalculate the Binder cumulant for the Ising spin glass in a transverse magnetic\nfield with two different short-range bond distributions, the bimodal and the\nGaussian ones. Through an exhaustive finite-size scaling analysis, we show that\nthe universality class does not depend on the exact form of the bond\ndistribution but, most important, that the quantum critical behavior is\ngoverned by an infinite randomness fixed point.\n", "  We consider entanglement swapping, a key component of quantum network\noperations and entanglement distribution. Pure entangled states, which are the\ndesired input to the swapping protocol, are typically mixed by environmental\ninteractions causing a reduction in their degree of entanglement. Thus an\nunderstanding of entanglement swapping with partially mixed states is of\nimportance. Here we present a general analytical solution for entanglement\nswapping of arbitrary two-qubit states. Our result provides a comprehensive\nmethod for analyzing entanglement swapping in quantum networks. First, we show\nthat the concurrence of a partially mixed state is conserved when this state is\nswapped with a Bell state. Then, we find upper and lower bounds on the\nconcurrence of the state resulting from entanglement swapping for various\nclasses of input states. Finally, we determine a general relationship between\nthe ranks of the initial states and the rank of the final state after swapping.\n", "  Predictions of fiducial cross sections, differential cross sections and\nlepton charge asymmetry are presented for the production of $W^{\\pm}$ bosons\nwith leptonic decay up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative\nQCD. Differential cross sections of $W^{\\pm}$ bosons and W boson lepton charge\nasymmetry are computed as a function of lepton pseudorapidity for a defined\nfiducial region in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Numerical results of\nfiducial $W^{\\pm}$ cross section predictions are presented with the latest\nmodern PDF models at next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO. It is found that the\nCT14 and NNPDF 3.0 predictions with NNLO QCD corrections are about 4$\\%$ higher\nthan the NLO CT14 and NNPDF 3.0 predictions while MMHT 2014 predictions with\nNLO QCD corrections are smaller than its NNLO QCD predictions by approximately\n6$\\%$. In addition, the NNLO QCD corrections reduce the scale variation\nuncertainty on the cross section by a factor of 3.5. The prediction of central\nvalues and considered uncertainties are obtained using FEWZ 3.1 program.\n", "  With the potential prospects of the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ data samples at the\nrunning LHC and upcoming SuperKEKB, the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\rho}$\nweak decays are studied with the pQCD approach. It is found that (1) the lion's\nshare of branching ratio comes from the longitudinal polarization helicity\namplitudes; (2) branching ratio for the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\rho}$\ndecay can reach up to ${\\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which might be hopefully measurable.\n", "  We investigate the von Neumann entanglement entropy and Schmidt gap in the\nground state of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice for square and\ncylindrical subsystems. We find that, for both the subsystems, the\nfree-fermionic contribution to the entanglement entropy $S_E$ exhibits\nsignatures of the phase transitions between the gapless and gapped phases.\nHowever, we find that $S_E$ does not show an expected monotonic behaviour as a\nfunction of the coupling $J_z$ between the suitably defined one-dimensional\nchains within the gapless phase for either geometry; moreover the system\ngenerically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase\nbefore the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is\nreached. This may be attributed to the competition between the nearest\nneighbour correlation functions of the $x-x$ and $z-z$ bonds, and to the onset\nof gapless $\\vec{k}$-modes in the bulk spectrum. On the other hand $S_E$ always\nmonotonically varies with $J_z$ in the gapped phase independent of the\nsubregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture,\nwe find that the Schmidt gap $\\Delta$ defined from the entanglement spectrum\nalso signals the topological transitions but only if there are corresponding\nzero energy Majorana edge states that simultaneously appear or disappear across\nthe transitions. We analytically corroborate some of our results on\nentanglement entropy, Schmidt gap and the bulk-edge correspondence using\nperturbation theory.\n", "  We report the development of a magnetically driven Persistent Current Switch\noperated in a dilution refrigerator. We show that it can be safely used to\ncharge a 60 mH coil with 0.5 A at 11 mK, which heats up the dilution\nrefrigerator to 60.5 mK. Measurements at 4 K on a 440 $\\mu$H coil reveal a\nresidual resistance of $R \\leqslant 3.3$ p$\\Omega$.\n", "  We explore several novel LHC signatures arising from quark or lepton flavor\nviolating couplings in the Higgs sector, and we constrain such couplings using\nLHC data. Since the largest signals are possible in channels involving top\nquarks or tau leptons, we consider in particular the following flavor violating\nprocesses: (1) $pp \\to thh$ (top plus di-Higgs final state) arising from a\ndimension six coupling of up-type quarks to three insertions of the Higgs\nfield. We develop a search strategy for this final state and demonstrate that\ndetection is possible at the high luminosity LHC if flavor violating\ntop--up--Higgs couplings are not too far below the current limit. (2) $pp \\to\ntH^0$, where $H^0$ is the heavy neutral CP-even Higgs boson in a two Higgs\ndoublet model (2HDM). We consider the decay channels $H^0 \\to tu, WW, ZZ, hh$\nand use existing LHC data to constrain the first three of them. For the fourth,\nwe adapt our search for the $thh$ final state, and we demonstrate that in large\nregions of the parameter space, it is superior to other searches, including\nsearches for flavor violating top quark decays ($t \\to hq$). (3) $H^0 \\to\n\\tau\\mu$, again in the context of a 2HDM. This channel is particularly well\nmotivated by the recent CMS excess in $h \\to \\tau\\mu$, and we use the data from\nthis search to constrain the properties of $H^0$.\n", "  We establish several relationships between the non-relativistic conformal\nsymmetries of Newton-Cartan geometry and the Schr\\\"odinger equation. In\nparticular we discuss the algebra $\\mathfrak{sch}(d)$ of vector fields\nconformally-preserving a flat Newton-Cartan spacetime, and we prove that its\ncurved generalisation generates the symmetry group of the covariant\nSchr\\\"odinger equation coupled to a Newtonian potential and generalised\nCoriolis force. We provide intrinsic Newton-Cartan definitions of Killing\ntensors and conformal Schr\\\"odinger-Killing tensors, and we discuss their\nrespective links to conserved quantities and to the higher symmetries of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Finally we consider the role of conformal symmetries in\nNewtonian twistor theory, where the infinite-dimensional algebra of holomorphic\nvector fields on twistor space corresponds to the symmetry algebra\n$\\mathfrak{cnc}(3)$ on the Newton-Cartan spacetime.\n", "  We prove that the log-determinant of the covariance matrix obeys the strong\nsubadditivity inequality for arbitrary tripartite states of multimode\ncontinuous variable quantum systems. This establishes general limitations on\nthe distribution of information encoded in the second moments of canonically\nconjugate operators. The inequality is shown to be stronger than the\nconventional strong subadditivity inequality for von Neumann entropy in a class\nof pure tripartite Gaussian states. We finally show that such an inequality\nimplies a strict monogamy-type constraint for joint Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nsteerability of single modes by Gaussian measurements performed on multiple\ngroups of modes.\n", "  Radiative subsonic heat waves, and their radiation driven shock waves, are\nimportant hydro-radiative phenomena. The high pressure, causes hot matter in\nthe rear part of the heat wave to ablate backwards. At the front of the heat\nwave, this ablation pressure generates a shock wave which propagates ahead of\nthe heat front. Although no self-similar solution of both the ablation and\nshock regions exists, a solution for the full problem was found in a previous\nwork. Here, we use this model in order to investigate the effect of the\nequation of state (EOS) on the propagation of radiation driven shocks. We find\nthat using a single ideal gas EOS for both regions, as used in previous works,\nyields large errors in describing the shock wave. We use the fact that the\nsolution is composed of two different self-similar solutions, one for the\nablation region and one for the shock, and apply two ideal gas EOS\n(binary-EOS), one for each region, by fitting a detailed tabulated EOS to power\nlaws at different regimes. By comparing the semi-analytic solution with a\nnumerical simulation using a full EOS, we find that the semi-analytic solution\ndescribes both the heat and the shock regions well.\n", "  The vorticity equation stemming from the modified Navier-Stokes equation\ngives a solution for a flat profile of the orbital speed of spiral galaxies.\nSolutions disclose existence of the Gaussian vortex clouds, the coherent\nvortices with infinite life-time, what can be a manifestation of the dark\nmatter. The solutions also disclose what we might call a breathing of the\ngalaxies - due to an exchange of the vortex energy with zero-point fluctuations\nin the vacuum. .\n", "  In the last two decades, non-equilibrium spectroscopies have evolved from\navant-garde studies to crucial tools for expanding our understanding of the\nphysics of strongly correlated materials. The possibility of obtaining\nsimultaneously spectroscopic and temporal information has led to insights that\nare complementary to (and in several cases beyond) those attainable by studying\nthe matter at equilibrium. Multiple phase transitions and new orders arising\nfrom competing interactions are benchmark examples where the interplay among\nelectrons, lattice, and spin dynamics can be disentangled because of the\ndifferent timescales that characterize the recovery of the initial ground\nstate. The nature of the broken-symmetry phases and of the bosonic excitations\nthat mediate the electronic interactions, eventually leading to\nsuperconductivity or other exotic states, can be revealed by observing the\nsub-picosecond dynamics of impulsively excited states. Recent experimental\ndevelopments have made possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the\nsingle-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as\nthose arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation.\n  Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and\ntheoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and\nmagnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the\nprototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional\nsuperconductivity or other exotic phases, even though the discussion will\nextend also to other topical systems. The necessity of extending the actual\nexperimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to\nmicroscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple\nphenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontier\nin physics.\n", "  We study the effect of a short-ranged hard-core repulsion on the stability\nand superfluid properties of the cluster crystal phase of two-dimensional (2D)\nsoft core bosons. Results of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations on a cogent test\ncase suggest that the main physical properties of the phase remain unaltered if\nthe range d of the inner repulsive core is sufficiently short, even if the\nstrength of the repulsion is several orders of magnitude greater than the outer\nsoft core barrier. Only if d is an appreciable fraction of the size of the\nclusters (> 5%) does a sufficiently strong hard core repulsion cause the\ncrystal to break down into a homogeneous superfluid; a moderate inner core\nrepulsion enhances the superfluid response of the crystalline phase.\n", "  We obtain ab initio the Hubbard parameters for Rydberg-dressed atoms in an\none-dimensional sinusoidal optical lattice in the basis of maximally localized\nwannier states. Finite range, soft-core inter-atomic interactions become the\ntrait of Rydberg admixed atoms, which can be extended over many neighbouring\nlattice sites. On contrary to dipolar gases, where the interactions follow an\ninverse cubic law, the key feature of Rydberg-dressed interactions being the\npossibility of making neighbouring couplings to the same magnitude as that of\nthe onsite ones. The maximally localized Wannier functions are typically\ncalculated via spread minimization procedure [Phys. Rev. B 56, 12847 (1997)]\nand always found to be real functions apart from a trivial global phase when\nconsidering an isolated set of Bloch bands. For an isolated single Bloch band,\nthe above procedure reduces to a simple quasi-momentum dependent unitary phase\ntransformation. Here, in stead of minimizing the spread, we employ a diagonal\nphase transformation which eliminates the imaginary part of the Wannier\nfunctions. The resulting Wannier states are found to be maximally localized and\nin exact agreement with those obtained via spread minimization procedure. Using\nthat we calculate the Hubbard couplings from the Rydberg-admixed interactions,\nincluding dominant density assisted tunnelling coefficients. In the end we\nprovide realistic lattice parameters for the state of the art experimental\nRydberg dressed Rubidium setup.\n", "  Residential mobility is deeply entangled with all aspects of hunter-gatherer\nlife ways, and is therefore an issue of central importance in hunter-gatherer\nstudies. Hunter-gatherers vary widely in annual rates of residential mobility,\nand understanding the sources of this variation has long been of interest to\nanthropologists and archaeologists. Since mobility is, to a large extent,\ndriven by the need for a continuous supply of food, a natural framework for\naddressing this question is provided by the metabolic theory of ecology. This\nprovides a powerful framework for formulating formal testable hypotheses\nconcerning evolutionary and ecological constraints on the scale and variation\nof hunter-gatherer residential mobility. We evaluate these predictions using\nextant data and show strong support for the hypotheses. We show that the\noverall scale of hunter-gatherer residential mobility is predicted by average\nhuman body size, and the limited capacity of mobile hunter-gatherers to store\nenergy internally. We then show that the majority of variation in residential\nmobility observed across cultures is predicted by energy availability in local\necosystems. Our results demonstrate that large-scale evolutionary and\necological processes, common to all plants and animals, constrain\nhunter-gatherers in predictable ways as they move through territories to\neffectively exploit resources over the course of a year. Moreover, our results\nextend the scope of the metabolic theory of ecology by showing how it\nsuccessfully predicts variation in the behavioral ecology of populations within\na species.\n", "  Following on our earlier work on leading-logarithmic (LLR) resummations for\nthe properties of jets with a small radius, R, we here examine the\nphenomenological considerations for the inclusive jet spectrum. We discuss how\nto match the NLO predictions with small-R resummation. As part of the study we\npropose a new, physically-inspired prescription for fixed-order predictions and\ntheir uncertainties. We investigate the R-dependent part of the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections, which is found to be\nsubstantial, and comment on the implications for scale choices in inclusive jet\ncalculations. We also examine hadronisation corrections, identifying potential\nlimitations of earlier analytical work with regards to their $p_t$-dependence.\nFinally we assemble these different elements in order to compare matched\n(N)NLO+LLR predictions to data from ALICE and ATLAS, finding improved\nconsistency for the R-dependence of the results relative to NLO predictions.\n", "  Modulation of stress anisotropy of magnetostrictive nanomagnets with strain\noffers an extremely energy-efficient method of magnetization reversal. The\nreversal process, however, is often incoherent and hence error-prone in the\npresence of thermal noise at room temperature. Occurrence of incoherent\nmetastable states in the potential landscape of the nanomagnet can further\nexacerbate the error. Stochastic micromagnetic simulations at room temperature\nare used to understand and calculate energy dissipations and switching error\nprobabilities in this important magnetization switching methodology. We find\nthat these quantities have an intriguing dependence on nanomagnet size: small\nnanomagnets perform better owing to the fact that they are more resilient to\nthe formation of metastable states and magnetization dynamics in them is more\ncoherent. However, for a fixed stress anisotropy energy density, smaller\nnanomagnets will also have poorer resilience against thermal instability. Thus,\nthe challenge in straintronics is to maximize the stress anisotropy energy\ndensity by developing materials and processes that yield the largest\nmagnetostriction.\n", "  We introduce an alternative approach to the polarization theory of light.\nThis is based on a set of quantum operators, constructed from two independent\nbosons, being three of them the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators, and the other\none, the Casimir operator of this algebra. By taking the expectation value of\nthese generators in a two-mode coherent state, their classical limit is\nobtained. We use these classical quantities to define the new Stokes-like\nparameters. We show that the light polarization ellipse can be written in terms\nof the Stokes-like parameters. Also, we write these parameters in terms of\nother two quantities, and show that they define a one-sheet (Poincar\\'e\nhyperboloid) of a two-sheet hyperboloid. Our study is restricted to the case of\na monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave which propagates along the $z$ axis.\n", "  We study the simplest two-body problem in asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspacetime: two, infinitely thin, concentric spherical shells of matter. We\ninclude only gravitational interaction between the two shells, but we show that\nthe dynamics of this system is highly nontrivial. We observe prompt collapse to\na black hole, delayed collapse and even perpetual oscillatory motion, depending\non the initial location of the shells (or their energy content). The system\nexhibits critical behavior, and we show strong hints that it is also chaotic.\n", "  A general and in principle exact approach for the continuous variable\nentanglement in a system of coupled harmonic oscillators in contact with a\nthermal bath is formulated. This allows a generalization to describe\nentanglement's existence between two sites in any system of this kind. It is\nemployed a method of simultaneous diagonalization of two quadratic forms to\nobtain the uncoupled quantum Hamiltonian. Making use of the transformations\nthat uncouple the system, the covariance matrix for two positions is\nconstructed, and through the positive partial transpose criterion\n(PPT-criterion), the condition that determines the existence or not of quantum\ncorrelation between the sites is obtained.\n", "  Stellar spectra are often modeled and fit by interpolating within a\nrectilinear grid of synthetic spectra to derive the stars' labels: stellar\nparameters and elemental abundances. However, the number of synthetic spectra\nneeded for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with the label space\ndimensions, precluding the simultaneous and self-consistent fitting of more\nthan a few elemental abundances. Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels\nseparately can introduce unknown systematics and do not produce correct error\ncovariances in the derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach --\nCHAT (Convex Hull Adaptive Tessellation) -- which includes several new ideas\nfor inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library, using\nlinear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A convex hull\napproximates the region where the data lie in the label space. A variety of\ntests with mock datasets demonstrate that CHAT can reduce the number of\nrequired synthetic model calculations by three orders of magnitude in an 8D\nlabel space. The reduction will be even larger for higher-dimensional label\nspaces. In CHAT the computational effort increases only linearly with the\nnumber of labels that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points\nin label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through\nlinear expansion using a set of \"gradient spectra\" that represent flux\nderivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all labels. These\ntechniques provide new opportunities to fit the full stellar spectra from large\nsurveys with 15-30 labels simultaneously.\n", "  The energy-momentum dispersion relation is a fundamental property of\nplasmonic systems. In this paper, we show that the method of dispersion\nengineering can be used for the design of ultra-compact graphene-based\nsuperscatterers. Based on the Bohr model, the dispersion relation of the\nequivalent planar waveguide is engineered to enhance the scattering cross\nsection of a dielectric cylinder. Bohr conditions with different orders are\nfulfilled in multiple dispersion curves at the same resonant frequency. Thus\nthe resonance peaks from the first and second order scattering terms are\noverlapped in the deepsubwavelength scale by delicately tuning the gap\nthickness between two graphene layers. Using this ultra-compact graphene-based\nsuperscatterer, the scattering cross section of the dielectric cylinder can be\nenhanced by five orders of magnitude.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit a visible heavy QCD axion model in light of the\nrecent reports on the $750$ GeV diphoton resonance by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments. In this model, the axion is made heavy with the help of the mirror\ncopied sector of the Standard Model while the successful Peccei-Quinn mechanism\nis kept intact. We identify the $750$ GeV resonance as the scalar boson\nassociated with spontaneous breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry which mainly\ndecays into a pair of the axions. We find that the mixings between the axion\nand $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ play important roles in its decays and the resultant\nbranching ratio into two photons. The axion decay length can be suitable for\nexplaining the diphoton excess by the di-axion production when its decay\nconstant $f_a \\simeq 1$ TeV. We also find that our model allows multiple sets\nof the extra fermions without causing the domain wall problem, which is\nadvantageous to explain the diphoton signal.\n", "  The BPS Skyrme model is a model containing an $SU(2)$-valued scalar field, in\nwhich a Bogomol'nyi-type inequality can be satisfied by soliton solutions. In\nthis model, the energy density of static configurations is the sum of the\nsquare of the topological charge density plus a potential. The topological\ncharge density is nothing else but the pull-back of the Haar measure of the\ngroup $SU(2)$ on the physical space by the field configuration. As a\nconsequence, this energy expression has a high degree of symmetry: it is\ninvariant to volume preserving diffeomorphisms both on physical space and on\nthe target space. We demonstrate here, that in the BPS Skyrme model such\nsolutions exists, that a fraction of their charge and energy densities are\nlocalised, and the remaining part can be any far away, not interacting with the\nlocalised part.\n", "  The diagonal entropy was introduced as a good entropy candidate especially\nfor isolated quantum systems out of equilibrium. Here we present an analytical\ncalculation of the average diagonal entropy for systems undergoing unitary\nevolution and an external perturbation in the form of a cyclic quench. We\ncompare our analytical findings with numerical simulations of various many-body\nquantum systems. Our calculations elucidate various heuristic relations\nproposed recently in the literature.\n", "  We introduce a novel method to determine the orientation heterogeneity (mean\ntilt angle and orientational distribution) of molecules at interfaces using\nheterodyne two-dimensional sum frequency generation spectroscopy. By doing so,\nwe not only have solved the long-standing \"magic angle\" challenge, i.e. the\nmeasurement of molecular orientation by assuming a narrow orientational\ndistribution results in ambiguities, but we also are able to determine the\norientational distribution, which is otherwise difficult to measure. We applied\nour new method to a CO2 reduction catalyst/gold interface and found that the\ncatalysts formed a monolayer with a mean tilt angle between the quasi-C3\nsymmetric axis of the catalysts and the surface normal of 53 deg, with 5 deg\norientational distribution. Although applied to a specific system, this method\nis a general way to determine the orientation heterogeneity of an\nensemble-averaged molecular interface, which can potentially be applied to a\nwide-range of energy material, catalytic and biological interfaces.\n", "  We review an approach which aims at studying discrete (pseudo-)manifolds in\ndimension $d\\geq 2$ and called random tensor models. More specifically, we\ninsist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higher\ndimensions. To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of\nsimplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building\nblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can\nin turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to\nclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to\ntheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored\ntriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at\nfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic\ntriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to\ncolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the\npossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present\nthree existing strategies to find those universality classes. The first two\nstrategies consist in building new bubbles from old ones for which the problem\ncan be solved. The third strategy is a bijection between those colored\ntriangulations and stuffed, edge-colored maps, which are some sort of hypermaps\nwhose hyperedges are replaced with edge-colored maps. We then show that the\npresent approach can lead to enumeration results and identification of\nuniversality classes, by working out the example of quartic tensor models. They\nfeature a tree-like phase, a planar phase similar to two-dimensional quantum\ngravity and a phase transition between them which is interpreted as a\nproliferation of baby universes.\n", "  In the paper a theoretical study of critical (Curie) temperature of diluted\nferromagnet based on multilayer graphene (or graphite) with hydrogen adatoms\ndeposited over carbon atoms belonging to single sublattice is presented. The\ncalculations are performed within Pair Approximation (PA) for diluted\nferromagnetic system with long-range interactions. The method is able to take\ninto account the spin-space anisotropy of coupling. The results obtained within\nMean Field Approximation (MFA) are also presented for comparison. The assumed\ninteraction between hydrogen adatom spins is inversely proportional to their\nmutual distance, with the additional exponential attenuation reflecting the\npresence of disorder in the system. The results obtained for a wide range of\nimpurity concentrations and interaction decay length are discussed. The\nstrongly non-linear behaviour of critical temperature as a function of dilution\nis predicted, at variance with MFA predictions. Moreover, MFA tends to\noverestimate heavily the critical temperature values compared to PA. An\nuniversal dependence of critical temperature on impurity concentration and\ninteraction decay length is found for strong dilution regime.\n", "  We detect the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect with a statistical\nsignificance of $4.2 \\sigma$ by combining a cluster catalogue derived from the\nfirst year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with CMB temperature maps from\nthe South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) Survey. This measurement\nis performed with a differential statistic that isolates the pairwise kSZ\nsignal, providing the first detection of the large-scale, pairwise motion of\nclusters using redshifts derived from photometric data. By fitting the pairwise\nkSZ signal to a theoretical template we measure the average central optical\ndepth of the cluster sample, $\\bar{\\tau}_e = (3.75 \\pm 0.89)\\cdot 10^{-3}$. We\ncompare the extracted signal to realistic simulations and find good agreement\nwith respect to the signal-to-noise, the constraint on $\\bar{\\tau}_e$, and the\ncorresponding gas fraction. High-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ\nsignal with future data will be able to place constraints on the baryonic\nphysics of galaxy clusters, and could be used to probe gravity on scales $\n\\gtrsim 100$ Mpc.\n", "  Quite recently, magnon Hall effect of spin excitations has been observed\nexperimentally on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. Thermal Hall conductivity\n$\\kappa^{xy}$, changes sign as a function of magnetic field or temperature on\nthe kagome lattice, and $\\kappa^{xy}$ changes sign upon reversing the sign of\nthe magnetic field on the pyrochlore lattice. Motivated by these recent\nexciting experimental observations, we theoretically propose a simple\nrealization of magnon Hall effect in a two-band model on the honeycomb lattice.\nThe magnon Hall effect of spin excitations arises in the usual way via the\nbreaking of inversion symmetry of the lattice, however, by a\nnext-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find that\n$\\kappa^{xy}$ has a fixed sign for all parameter regimes considered. These\nresults are in contrast to the Lieb, kagome and pyrochlore lattices. We further\nshow that the low-temperature dependence on the magnon Hall conductivity\nfollows a $T^{2}$ law, as opposed to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. These\nresults suggest an experimental procedure to measure thermal Hall conductivity\nwithin a class of 2D honeycomb quantum magnets and ultracold atoms trapped in\nhoneycomb optical lattice.\n", "  We show within the saturation framework that measurements of exclusive vector\nmeson production at high energy provide evidence for strong geometric\nfluctuations of the proton. In comparison, the effect of saturation scale and\ncolor charge fluctuations is weak. This knowledge will allow detailed future\nmeasurements of the incoherent cross section to tightly constrain the\nfluctuating geometry of the proton as a function of the parton momentum\nfraction $x$.\n", "  Fractals equipped with intrinsic arithmetic lead to a natural definition of\ndifferentiation, integration and complex numbers. Applying the formalism to the\nproblem of a Fourier transform on fractals we show that the resulting transform\nhas all the expected basic properties. As an example we discuss a sawtooth\nsignal on the ternary middle-third Cantor set. The formalism works also for\nfractals that are not self-similar.\n", "  Motivated by Sr2RuO4, we consider a chiral superconductor where the gap is\nstrongly suppressed along certain momentum directions. We evaluate the thermal\nHall conductivity in the gapless regime, i.e., at temperature small compared\nwith the impurity band width \\gamma, taking the simplest model of isotropic\nimpurity scattering. We find that, under favorable circumstances, this thermal\nHall conductivity can be quite significant, and is smaller than the diagonal\ncomponent (the universal thermal conductivity) only by a factor of 1/ ln(2\n\\Delta_M/\\gamma), where \\Delta_M is the maximum gap.\n", "  Using numerical and analytic methods, we study quantum tunneling from a\nMinkowski false vacuum to an anti-de Sitter true vacuum. Scanning the parameter\nspace of theories with quartic and non-polynomial potentials, we find that for\nany given potential tunneling is completely quenched if gravitational effects\nare made sufficiently strong. For potentials where $\\epsilon$, the energy\ndensity difference between the vacua, is small compared to the barrier height,\nthis occurs in the thin-wall regime studied by Coleman and De Luccia. However,\nwe find that other potentials, possibly with $\\epsilon$ much greater than the\nbarrier height, produce a new type of thin-wall bounce when gravitational\neffects become strong. We show that the critical curve that bounds the region\nin parameter space where the false vacuum is stable can be found by a\ncomputationally simple overshoot/undershoot argument. We discuss the treatment\nof boundary terms in the bounce calculation and show that, with proper\nregularization, one obtains an identical finite result for the tunneling\nexponent regardless of whether or not these are included. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss the extension of our results to transitions between anti-de Sitter\nvacua.\n", "  Dwarf satellite galaxies are ideal laboratories for identifying particle Dark\nMatter signals. When setting limits on particle Dark Matter properties from\nnull searches, it becomes however crucial the level at which the Dark Matter\ndensity profile within these systems is constrained by observations. In the\nlimit in which the spherical Jeans equation is assumed to be valid for a given\ntracer stellar population, we study the solution of this equation having the\nDark Matter mass profile as an output rather than as a trial parametric input.\nWithin our new formulation, we address to what level dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nfeature a reliable mass estimator. We assess then possible extrapolation of the\ndensity profiles in the inner regions and -- keeping explicit the dependence on\nthe orbital anisotropy profile of the tracer population -- we derive general\ntrends on the line-of-sight integral of the density profile squared, a quantity\ncommonly dubbed $J$-factor and crucial to estimate fluxes from prompt Dark\nMatter pair annihilations. Taking Ursa Minor as a study case among Milky Way\nsatellites, we perform Bayesian inference using the available kinematical data\nfor this galaxy. Contrary to all previous studies, we avoid marginalization\nover quantities poorly constrained by observations or by theoretical arguments.\nWe find minimal $J$-factors to be about 2 to 4 times smaller than commonly\nquoted estimates, approximately relaxing by the same amount the limit on Dark\nMatter pair annihilation cross section from gamma-ray surveys of Ursa Minor. At\nthe same time, if one goes back to a fixed trial parametric form for the\ndensity, e.g. using a NFW or Burkert profile, we show that the minimal $J$ can\nhardly be reduced by more than a factor of 1.5.\n", "  We modify and generalize the known solution for the electromagnetic field\nwhen a vacuum, stationary, axisymmetric black hole is immersed in a uniform\nmagnetic field to the case of nonvacuum black holes (of modified gravity) and\ndetermine all linear terms of the vector potential in powers of the magnetic\nfield and the rotation parameter.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of the magnetic field turbulence in\ncollisionless electron-positron plasma with continuous injection of new pairs,\nwhich maintains anisotropy in the particle distribution over long time. {With\nthese simulations we follow evolution of a small (and therefore uniform) region\nin the fluid comoving frame modelling} generation and decay of the magnetic\nfield in shocks, where the upstream is modified by two-photon pair production\ndue to self-absorption of the shock's high-energy radiation. We find that the\noverall picture of magnetic field build-up is consistent with development of\nWeibel instability. However, the long-term injection of anisotropic pairs in\nthe upstream leads to formation of large-scale structures in the magnetic\nfield, while the small-scale structures are almost absent. We find that being\namplified at the shock front this magnetic field mostly preserves its large\nspatial scale and then slowly decays in the downstream on a timescale\napproximately equal to duration of the injection phase. The observed decay of\nthe magnetic field is in exceptionally good agreement with predictions of the\nso-called phase mixing model. Generation of the long-lived magnetic field in\nrelativistic collisionless shocks with injection-modified upstream explains how\nthey can efficiently produce the synchrotron radiation in Gamma-Ray Bursts.\n", "  We introduce the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line\nLens Survey (BELLS) for GALaxy-Ly$\\alpha$ EmitteR sYstems (BELLS GALLERY)\nSurvey, which is a Hubble Space Telescope program to image a sample of\ngalaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidate systems with high-redshift\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) as the background sources. The goal of the BELLS\nGALLERY Survey is to illuminate dark substructures in galaxy-scale halos by\nexploiting the small-scale clumpiness of rest-frame far-UV emission in lensed\nLAEs, and to thereby constrain the slope and normalization of the\nsubstructure-mass function. In this paper, we describe in detail the\nspectroscopic strong-lens selection technique, which is based on methods\nadopted in the previous Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, BELLS, and SLACS for the\nMasses Survey. We present the BELLS GALLERY sample of the 21 highest-quality\ngalaxy--LAE candidates selected from $\\approx 1.4 \\times 10^6$ galaxy spectra\nin the BOSS of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. These systems consist of\nmassive galaxies at redshifts of approximately 0.5 strongly lensing LAEs at\nredshifts from 2--3. The compact nature of LAEs makes them an ideal probe of\ndark substructures, with a substructure-mass sensitivity that is unprecedented\nin other optical strong-lens samples. The magnification effect from lensing\nwill also reveal the structure of LAEs below 100 pc scales, providing a\ndetailed look at the sites of the most concentrated unobscured star formation\nin the universe. The source code used for candidate selection is available for\ndownload as a part of this release.\n", "  We address the impact of consistent modifications of gravity on the largest\nobservable scales, focusing on relativistic effects in galaxy number counts and\nthe cross-correlation between the matter large scale structure (LSS)\ndistribution and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our analysis applies to\na very broad class of general scalar-tensor theories encoded in the Horndeski\nLagrangian and is fully consistent on linear scales, retaining the full\ndynamics of the scalar field and not assuming quasi-static evolution. As\nparticular examples we consider self-accelerating Covariant Galileons,\nBrans-Dicke theory and parameterizations based on the effective field theory of\ndark energy, using the \\hiclass\\, code to address the impact of these models on\nrelativistic corrections to LSS observables. We find that especially effects\nwhich involve integrals along the line of sight (lensing convergence, time\ndelay and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- ISW) can be considerably\nmodified, and even lead to $\\mathcal{O}(1000\\%)$ deviations from General\nRelativity in the case of the ISW effect for Galileon models, for which\nstandard probes such as the growth function only vary by $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$.\nThese effects become dominant when correlating galaxy number counts at\ndifferent redshifts and can lead to $\\sim 50\\%$ deviations in the total signal\nthat might be observable by future LSS surveys. Because of their integrated\nnature, these deep-redshift cross-correlations are sensitive to modifications\nof gravity even when probing eras much before dark energy domination. We\nfurther isolate the ISW effect using the cross-correlation between LSS and CMB\ntemperature anisotropies and use current data to further constrain Horndeski\nmodels (abridged).\n", "  Symmetries play important roles in modern theories of physical laws. In this\npaper, we review several experimental tests of important symmetries associated\nwith the gravitational interaction, including the universality of free fall for\nself-gravitating bodies, time-shift symmetry in the gravitational constant,\nlocal position invariance and local Lorentz invariance of gravity, and\nspacetime translational symmetries. Recent experimental explorations for\npost-Newtonian gravity are discussed, of which, those from pulsar astronomy are\nhighlighted. All of these tests, of very different aspects of gravity theories,\nat very different length scales, favor to very high precision the predictions\nof the strong equivalence principle (SEP) and, in particular, general\nrelativity which embodies SEP completely. As the founding principles of\ngravity, these symmetries are motivated to be promoted to even stricter tests\nin future.\n", "  Production of K^{+} mesons in charged-current \\nu_{\\mu} interactions on\nplastic scintillator (CH) is measured using MINERvA exposed to the low-energy\nNuMI beam at Fermilab. Timing information is used to isolate a sample of 885\ncharged-current events containing a stopping K^{+} which decays at rest. The\ndifferential cross section in K^{+} kinetic energy, d\\sigma/dT_{K}, is observed\nto be relatively flat between 0 and 500 MeV. Its shape is in good agreement\nwith the prediction by the \\textsc{genie} neutrino event generator when\nfinal-state interactions are included, however the data rate is lower than the\nprediction by 15\\%.\n", "  We present a model of the lattice dynamics of the rare earth titanate\npyrochlores R2Ti2O7 (R=Tb, Dy, Ho), which are important materials in the study\nof frustrated magnetism. The phonon modes are obtained by density functional\ncalculations, and these predictions are verified by comparison with scattering\nexperiments. Single crystal inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure\nacoustic phonons along high symmetry directions for R=Tb, Ho; single crystal\ninelastic x-ray scattering is used to measure numerous optical modes throughout\nthe Brillouin zone for R=Ho; and powder inelastic neutron scattering is used to\nestimate the phonon density of states for R=Tb, Dy, Ho. Good agreement between\nthe calculations and all measurements is obtained, allowing confident\nassignment of the energies and symmetries of the phonons in these materials\nunder ambient conditions. The knowledge of the phonon spectrum is important for\nunderstanding spin-lattice interactions, and can be expected to be transferred\nreadily to other members of the series to guide the search for unconventional\nmagnetic excitations.\n", "  Plasmonic lasers (spasers) generate coherent surface-plasmon-polaritons\n(SPPs) and could be realized at subwavelength dimensions in metallic cavities\nfor applications in nanoscale optics. Plasmonic cavities are also utilized for\nterahertz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs), which are the brightest available\nsolid-state sources of terahertz radiation. A long standing challenge for\nspasers is their poor coupling to the far-field radiation. Unlike conventional\nlasers that could produce directional beams, spasers have highly divergent\nradiation patterns due to their subwavelength apertures. Here, we theoretically\nand experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing\ndistributed-feedback (DFB) that is distinct from any other previously utilized\nDFB schemes for semiconductor lasers. The so-termed antenna-feedback scheme\nleads to single-mode operation in plasmonic lasers, couples the resonant SPP\nmode to a highly directional far-field radiation pattern, and integrates hybrid\nSPPs in surrounding medium into the operation of the DFB lasers.\nExperimentally, the antenna-feedback method, which does not require the phase\nmatching to a well-defined effective index, is implemented for terahertz QCLs,\nand single-mode terahertz QCLs with beam divergence as small as 4 x 4 degree\nare demonstrated, which is the narrowest beam reported for any terahertz QCL\nto-date. Moreover, in contrast to negligible radiative-field in conventional\nphotonic band-edge lasers, in which the periodicity follows the integer\nmultiple of half-wavelength inside active medium, antenna-feedback breaks this\ninteger-limit for the first time and enhances the radiative-field of lasing\nmode. The antenna-feedback scheme is generally applicable to any plasmonic\nlaser with a Fabry-Perot cavity irrespective of its operating wavelength, and\ncould bring plasmonic lasers closer to practical applications.\n", "  Numerous loss mechanisms can limit coherence and scalability of planar and\n3D-based circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices, particularly due to\ntheir packaging. The low loss and natural isolation of 3D enclosures make them\ngood candidates for coherent scaling. We introduce a coaxial transmission line\ndevice architecture with coherence similar to traditional 3D cQED systems.\nMeasurements demonstrate well-controlled external and on-chip couplings, a\nspectrum absent of cross-talk or spurious modes, and excellent resonator and\nqubit lifetimes. We integrate a resonator-qubit system in this architecture\nwith a seamless 3D cavity, and separately pattern a qubit, readout resonator,\nPurcell filter and high-Q stripline resonator on a single chip. Device\ncoherence and its ease of integration make this a promising tool for complex\nexperiments.\n", "  We have developed a repeating pulsed magnet system which generates magnetic\nfields of about 10 T in a direction transverse to an incident beam over a\nlength of 0.8 m with a repetition rate of 0.2 Hz. Its repetition rate is by two\norders of magnitude higher than usual pulsed magnets. It is composed of four\nlow resistance racetrack coils and a 30 kJ transportable capacitor bank as a\npower supply. The system aims at axion-like particle searches with a pulsed\nlight source and vacuum birefringence measurements. We report on the details of\nthe system and its performances.\n", "  The exact closed equation of motion for microscopic distribution function of\nclassical many-body system with account of interactions retardation between\nparticles is derived. It is shown that interactions retardation leads to\nirreversible behaviour of many-body systems.\n  PACS: 05.20.Dd ; 05.60.-k; 45.20.-d\n", "  The calculation of chemical potential has traditionally been a challenge in\natomistic simulations. One of the most used approaches is Widom's insertion\nmethod in which the chemical potential is calculated by periodically attempting\nto insert an extra particle in the system. In dense systems this method fails\nsince the insertion probability is very low. In this paper we show that in a\nhomogeneous fluid the insertion probability can be increased using\nmetadynamics. We test our method on a supercooled high density binary\nLennard-Jones fluid. We find that we can obtain efficiently converged results\neven when Widom's method fails.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a new conception of pseudorandom phase ensemble\nto simulate a quantum ensemble. A pseudorandom sequence is inseparability and\nintegral that are demonstrated only for a whole sequence not for a single phase\nunit, which is similar to that of quantum ensembles and a quantum particle. By\nusing the ensemble conception, we demonstrate non-locality properties for\nclassical fields similar to quantum entanglement.\n", "  We propose a quantum bath engineering method for the initialization of\narbitrary number of flux-tunable transmon qubits with a multi-resonator circuit\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) architecture. Through the application of the\nmicrowave drives, we can prepare any number of qubits distributed among the\nnetwork into arbitrary initial states (on the Bloch sphere surface). Taking\ninto account the practically experimental parameters, we verify that the\ninitialization process could be achieved in $1 \\mu s$ with the fidelity in\nexcess of 99\\%. Moreover, due to the special structure of the circuit network,\nthe initialization efficiency is independent on the number of (ideal, provided)\nqubits, as only a definite number of bosonic modes are involved in despite of\nthe increasing number of the qubits to be initialized.\n", "  F\\\"orster resonances provide a highly flexible tool to tune both the strength\nand the angular shape of interactions between two Rydberg atoms. We give a\ndetailed explanation about how F\\\"orster resonances can be found by searching\nthrough a large range of possible quantum number combinations. We apply our\nsearch method to $SS$, $SD$ and $DD$ pair states of $^{87}$Rb with principal\nquantum numbers from 30 to 100, taking into account the fine structure\nsplitting of the Rydberg states. We find various strong resonances between\natoms with a large difference in principal quantum numbers. We quantify the\nstrength of these resonances by introducing a figure of merit $\\tilde C_3$\nwhich is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers and geometry to classify\nthe resonances by interaction strength. We further predict to what extent\nexcitation exchange is possible on different resonances and point out\nlimitations of the coherent hopping process. Finally, we discuss the angular\ndependence of the dipole-dipole interaction and its tunability near resonances.\n", "  In this work we present inelastic neutron scattering experiments which probe\nthe single ion ground states of the rare earth pyrochlores $R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$\n($R$ = Tb, Dy, Ho). Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ are dipolar spin\nices, now often described as hosts of emergent magnetic monopole excitations;\nthe low temperature state of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ has features of both spin\nliquids and spin glasses, and strong magnetoelastic coupling. We measured the\ncrystal field excitations of all three compounds and obtained a unified set of\ncrystal field parameters. Additional measurements of a single crystal of\nTb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ clarified the assignment of the crystal field levels in this\nmaterial and also revealed a new example of a bound state between a crystal\nfield level and an optical phonon mode.\n", "  We explore the phenomenon of unidirectional invisibility in two dimensions,\nexamine its optical realizations, and discuss its three-dimensional\ngeneralization. In particular we construct an infinite class of\nunidirectionally invisible optical potentials that describe the scattering of\nnormally incident transverse electric waves by an infinite planar slab with\nrefractive-index modulations along both the normal directions to the electric\nfield. A by-product of this investigation is a demonstration of nonreciprocal\ntransmission in two dimensions. To elucidate this phenomenon we state and prove\na general reciprocity theorem that applies to quantum scattering theory of real\nand complex potentials in two and three dimensions.\n", "  In this paper we perform a systematic study of vacuum spatially flat\n((3+D)+1)-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmological models. We consider\nmodels which topologically are the product of two flat isotropic subspaces with\ndifferent scale factors. One of these subspaces is 3D and represents our space\nand the other is D-dimensional and represents extra dimensions. We consider no\nansatz of the scale factors, which makes our results quite general. With both\nEinstein-Hilbert and Gauss-Bonnet contributions in play, the cases with D=1,\nD=2, D=3 and $D\\geqslant 4$ have different dynamics due to different structure\nof the equations of motion. We analytically study equations of motion in all\ncases and describe all possible regimes. It appears that the only regimes with\nnonsingular future asymptotes are the Kasner regime in GR as well as\nexponential regimes. As of the past asymptotes, for a smooth transition only\nKasner regime in Gauss-Bonnet is an option. With that at hand, we are down only\nto two viable regimes -- \"pure\" Kasner regime (transition from high- to\nlow-energy Kasner regime) and a transition from high-energy Kasner to\nanisotropic exponential solution. It appears that these regimes take place for\ndifferent signs of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\\alpha$: \"pure\" Kasner regime\noccur for $\\alpha > 0$ at low D and $\\alpha < 0$ for high D; anisotropic\nexponential regime is reached only for $\\alpha > 0$. So if we restrain\nourselves with $\\alpha > 0$ solutions, the only late-time regimes are Kasner\nfor D=1, 2 and anisotropic exponential for $D\\geqslant 2$. Also, low-energy\nKasner regimes ($a(t)\\propto t^p$) have expansion rates for (3+1)-dimensional\nsubspace (\"our Universe\") ranging from p=0.5 (D=1) to $p=1/\\sqrt{3} \\approx\n0.577$ ($D\\to\\infty$), which contradicts with dust-dominated Friedmann\nprediction (p=2/3).\n", "  We present the study of the colour-magnitude diagram of the cluster Abell\n2151 (A2151), with a particular focus on the low-mass end. The deep\nspectroscopy with AF2/WYFFOS@WHT and the caustic method enable us to obtain 360\nmembers within 1.3 R_200 and absolute magnitude M_r < M*_r+6. This nearby\ncluster shows a well defined red sequence up to M_r ~ - 18.5; at fainter\nmagnitudes only 36% of the galaxies lie on the extrapolation of the red\nsequence. We compare the red sequences of A2151 and Abell 85, which is another\nnearby cluster with similar spectroscopic data, but with different mass and\ndynamical state. Both clusters show similar red sequences at the bright end\n(M_r < -19.5), whereas large differences appear at the faint end. This result\nsuggests that the reddening of bright galaxies is independent of environment,\nunlike the dwarf population (M_r > -18.0).\n", "  We present results from three-dimensional, numerical relativity simulations\nof a {\\it tilted} black hole-thick accretion disc system. The simulations are\nanalysed using tracer particles in the disc which are advected with the flow.\nSuch tracers, which we employ in these new simulations for the first time,\nprovide a powerful means to analyse in detail the complex dynamics of tilted\nblack hole-torus systems. We show how its use helps to gain insight in the\noverall dynamics of the system, discussing the origin of the observed black\nhole precession and the development of a global non-axisymmetric $m=1$ mode in\nthe disc. Our three-dimensional simulations show the presence of quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) in the instantaneous accretion rate, with frequencies in a\nrange compatible with those observed in low mass X-ray binaries with either a\nblack hole or a neutron star component. The frequency ratio of the dominant low\nfrequency peak and the first overtone is $o_1/f \\sim 1.9$, a frequency ratio\nnot attainable when modelling the QPOs as $p$-mode oscillations in axisymmetric\ntori.\n", "  We evaluate the tunneling short-circuit current density $J_{TU}$ in a\n$p$-$i$-$n$ solar cell in which the transition metal dichalcogenide\nheterostructure (MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ superlattice) is embedded in the intrinsic $i$\nregion. The effects of varying well and barrier widths, Fermi energy levels and\nnumber of quantum wells in the $i$ region on $J_{TU}$ are examined. A similar\nanalysis is performed for the thermionic current $J_{TH}$ that arises due to\nthe escape and recapture of charge carriers between adjacent potential wells in\nthe $i$-region. The interplay between $J_{TU}$ and $J_{TH}$ in the temperature\nrange (300 K - 330 K) is examined. The thermionic current is seen to exceed the\ntunneling current considerably at temperatures beyond 310 K, a desirable\nattribute in heterostructure solar cells. This work demonstrates the\nversatility of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides when utilized as\nfabrication materials for van der Waals heterostructure solar cells.\n", "  A class of exact solutions of the geodesic equations in (anti-)de Sitter\nAdS$_4$ and dS$_4$ spacetimes is presented. The geodesics for test particles in\nAdS$_4$ and dS$_4$ spacetimes are respectively sinusoidal and hyperbolic sine\nworld lines. The world line for light rays is straight lines as known. In\nparticular, the world lines of test particles are not dependent on their\nenergy. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of AdS$_4$ spacetime provides a physical\nexplanation for arising of the virtual particle and antiparticle pairs in\nvacuum. Interestingly, the energy of a pair and the time its particles moving\nalong their geodesics can be related by a relation similar to Heisenberg\nuncertainty one pertaining quantum vacuum fluctuations. The sinusoidal\ngeodesics of AdS$_4$ spacetime can describe the world lines of the virtual\nparticles and antiparticles. The hyperbolic sine geodesics of dS$_4$ spacetime\ncan explain why galaxies move apart with positive accelerations.\n", "  In this paper, we derive a method for the second-order form of the transport\nequation that is both globally conservative and compatible with voids, using\nContinuous Finite Element Methods (CFEM). The main idea is to use the\nLeast-Squares (LS) form of the transport equation in the void regions and the\nSelf-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) form elsewhere. While the SAAF formulation is\nglobally conservative, the LS formulation need a correction in void. The price\nto pay for this fix is the loss of symmetry of the bilinear form. We first\nderive this Conservative LS (CLS) formulation in void. Second we combine the\nSAAF and CLS forms and end up with an hybrid SAAF-CLS method, having the\ndesired properties. We show that extending the theory to near-void regions is a\nminor complication and can be done without affecting the global conservation of\nthe scheme. Being angular discretization agnostic, this method can be applied\nto both discrete ordinates (SN) and spherical harmonics (PN) methods. However,\nsince a globally conservative and void compatible second-order form already\nexists for SN (Wang et al. 2014), but is believed to be new for PN, we focus\nmost of our attention on that latter angular discretization. We implement and\ntest our method in Rattlesnake within the Multiphysics Object Oriented\nSimulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Results comparing it to other methods\nare presented.\n", "  We explore the possibly that either star-spots or pulsations are the cause of\na periodic radial-velocity signal (P~400 days) from the K-giant binary nu\nOctantis (P~1050 days, e~0.25), alternatively conjectured to have a retrograde\nplanet. Our study is based on temperatures derived from 22 line-depth ratios\n(LDRs) for nu Oct and twenty calibration stars. Empirical evidence and\nstability modelling provide unexpected support for the planet since other\nstandard explanations (star-spots, pulsations and additional stellar masses)\neach have credibility problems. However, the proposed system presents\nformidable challenges to planet-formation and stability theories: it has by far\nthe smallest stellar separation of any claimed planet-harbouring binary\n(a_bin~2.6 au) and an equally unbelievable separation ratio (a_pl/a_bin~0.5),\nhence the necessity that the circumstellar orbit be retrograde.\n  The LDR analysis of 215 nu Oct spectra acquired between 2001--2007, from\nwhich the RV perturbation was first revealed, have no significant periodicity\nat any frequency. The LDRs recover the original 21 stellar temperatures with an\naverage accuracy of 45+/-25 K. The 215 nu Oct temperatures have a standard\ndeviation of only 4.2 K. Assuming the host primary is not pulsating, the\ntemperatures converted to magnitude differences strikingly mimic the very\nstable photometric Hipparcos observations 15 years previously, implying the\nlong-term stability of the star and demonstrating a novel use of LDRs as a\nphotometric gauge. Our results provide substantial new evidence that\nconventional star-spots and pulsations are unlikely causes of the RV\nperturbation. The controversial system deserves continued attention, including\nwith higher resolving-power spectra for bisector and LDR analyses.\n", "  Scientists pursue collective knowledge, but they also seek personal\nrecognition from their peers. When scientists decide whether or not to work on\na big new problem, they weigh the potential rewards of a major discovery\nagainst the costs of setting aside other projects. These self-interested\nchoices can potentially spread researchers across problems in an efficient\nmanner, but efficiency is not guaranteed. We use simple economic models to\nunderstand such decisions and their collective consequences. Academic science\ndiffers from industrial R&D in that academics often share partial solutions to\ngain reputation. This convention of Open Science is thought to accelerate\ncollective discovery, but we find that it need not do so. The ability to share\npartial results influences which scientists work on a particular problem;\nconsequently, Open Science can slow down the solution of a problem if it deters\nentry by important actors.\n", "  Type I X-ray bursts and superbursts from accreting neutron stars illuminate\nthe accretion disk and produce a reflection signal that evolves as the burst\nfades. Examining the evolution of reflection features in the spectra will give\ninsight into the burst-disk interaction, a potentially powerful probe of\naccretion disk physics. At present, reflection has been observed during only\ntwo bursts of exceptional duration. We investigate the detectability of\nreflection signatures with four of the latest well-studied X-ray observatory\nconcepts: Hitomi, NICER, Athena, and LOFT. Burst spectra are modeled for\ndifferent values for the flux, temperature, and the disk ionization parameter,\nwhich are representative for most known bursts and sources. The effective area\nand through-put of a Hitomi-like telescope are insufficient for characterizing\nburst reflection features. NICER and Athena will detect reflection signatures\nin Type I bursts with peak fluxes $\\ge 10^{-7.5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and\nalso effectively constrain the reflection parameters for bright bursts with\nfluxes of $10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in exposures of several seconds.\nThus, these observatories will provide crucial new insight into the interaction\nof accretion flows and X-ray bursts. For sources with low line-of-sight\nabsorption, the wide band-pass of these instruments allows for the detection of\nsoft X-ray reflection features, which are sensitive to the disk metallicity and\ndensity. The large collecting area that is part of the LOFT design would\nrevolutionize the field by tracing the evolution of the accretion geometry in\ndetail throughout short bursts.\n", "  The near horizon geometry of the rotating C-metric, describing accelerating\nKerr-Newman black holes, is analysed. It is shown that, at extremality, even\nthough not it is isomorphic to the extremal Kerr-Newman, it remains a warped\nand twisted product of $AdS_2 \\times S^2$. Therefore the methods of the\nKerr/CFT correspondence can successfully be applied to build a CFT dual model,\nwhose entropy reproduce, through the Cardy formula, the Beckenstein-Hawking\nentropy of the accelerating black hole. The mass of accelerating Kerr-Newman\nblack hole, which fulfil the first law of thermodynamics, is presented. Further\ngeneralisation in presence of an external Melvin-like magnetic field, used to\nregularise the conical singularity characteristic of the C-metrics, shows that\nthe Kerr/CFT correspondence can be applied also for the accelerating and\nmagnetised extremal black holes.\n", "  We provide a proof of a recently conjectured universal bound on current\nfluctuations in Markovian processes. This bound establishes a link between the\nfluctuations of an individual observable current, the cycle affinities driving\nthe system into a non-equilibrium steady state, and the topology of the\nnetwork. The proof is based on a decomposition of the network into independent\ncycles with both positive affinity and positive stationary cycle current. This\nformalism allows for a refinement of the bound for systems in equilibrium or\nwith locally vanishing affinities.\n", "  The mass of gas in protoplanetary discs is a quantity of great interest for\nassessing their planet formation potential. Disc gas masses are, however,\ntraditionally inferred from measured dust masses by applying an assumed\nstandard gas-to-dust ratio of $g/d=100$. Furthermore, measuring gas masses\nbased on CO observations has been hindered by the effects of CO freeze-out.\nHere we present a novel approach to study the mid-plane gas by combining\nC$^{18}$O line modelling, CO snowline observations and the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) and selectively study the inner tens of au where freeze-out\nis not relevant. We apply the modelling technique to the disc around the Herbig\nAe star HD 163296 with particular focus on the regions within the CO snowline\nradius, measured to be at 90 au in this disc. Our models yield the mass of\nC$^{18}$O in this inner disc region of\n$M_{\\text{C}^{18}\\text{O}}(<90\\,\\text{au})\\sim 2\\times10^{-8}$ M$_\\odot$. We\nfind that most of our models yield a notably low $g/d<20$, especially in the\ndisc mid-plane ($g/d<1$). Our only models with a more interstellar medium\n(ISM)-like $g/d$ require C$^{18}$O to be underabundant with respect to the ISM\nabundances and a significant depletion of sub-micron grains, which is not\nsupported by scattered light observations. Our technique can be applied to a\nrange of discs and opens up a possibility of measuring gas and dust masses in\ndiscs within the CO snowline location without making assumptions about the\ngas-to-dust ratio.\n", "  The optical properties of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides are\ndominated by both neutral excitons (electron-hole pairs) and charged excitons\n(trions) that are stable even at room temperature. While trions directly\ninfluence charge transport properties in optoelectronic devices, excitons may\nbe relevant through exciton-trion coupling and conversion phenomena. In this\nwork, we reveal the coherent and incoherent nature of exciton-trion coupling\nand the relevant timescales in monolayer MoSe2 using optical two-dimensional\ncoherent spectroscopy. Coherent interaction between excitons and trions is\ndefinitively identified as quantum beating of cross-coupling peaks that\npersists for a few hundred femtoseconds. For longer times up to 10 ps,\nsurprisingly, the relative intensity of the cross-coupling peaks increases,\nwhich is attributed to incoherent energy transfer likely due to phonon-assisted\nup-conversion and down-conversion processes that are efficient even at\ncryogenic temperature.\n", "  There is current interest in investigating which variables play an important\nrole in the physical processes with an open composite quan- tum system that\nranges from the foundational issues to the tasks of diverse applications in\nquantum physics and technology. In this paper we contrast the local versus the\ncollective classical-like behavior of a pair of interacting qubits immersed in\nthe mutually independent thermal baths. The qubits can be locally subjected to\nany of the standard, microscopically modelled, generalized amplitude damping\nand phase damping channel, as well as to the recently introduced generalized\ndepolarizing channel. As a criterion for the classical-like behavior we use the\nleast entropy production, i.e. the total correlation in the system. The\nclassical-like collective behavior is found for short time intervals for\nstrongly interacting qubits. Only in a certain trivial case we observe the\nsimultaneous collective and individual-qubits classical- ity. Observation\n(non-observation) of the collective (individual) classicality can reveal the\nkind and strength of the qubits interaction or the ratio of the qubits'\nenergy-gaps, while manipulating the qubits interaction (by tuning the strength\nand/or refocussing) can give rise to the desired kind of classicality.\n", "  Belief networks represent a powerful approach to problems involving\nprobabilistic inference, but much of the work in this area is software based\nutilizing standard deterministic hardware based on the transistor which\nprovides the gain and directionality needed to interconnect billions of them\ninto useful networks. This paper proposes a transistor like device that could\nprovide an analogous building block for probabilistic networks. We present two\nproof-of-concept examples of belief networks, one reciprocal and one\nnon-reciprocal, implemented using the proposed device which is simulated using\nexperimentally benchmarked models.\n", "  Recently, we have investigated the dynamics of the universe in tachyon\ncosmology with non-minimal coupling to matter \\cite{faraj}-\\cite{faraj3}. In\nparticular, for the interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), the model is\nstudied in \\cite{Ravanpak}. In the current work, a significant observational\nprogram has been conducted to unveil the model's thermodynamic properties. Our\nresult shows that the IHDE version of our model better fits the observational\ndata than $\\Lambda$CDM model. The first and generalized second thermodynamics\nlaws for the universe enveloped by cosmological apparent and event horizon are\nrevisited. From the results, both first and generalized second laws,\nconstrained by the observational data, are satisfied on cosmological apparent\nhorizon.In addition, the total entropy is verified with the observation only if\nthe horizon of the universe is taken as apparent horizon. Then, due to validity\nof generalized second law, the current cosmic acceleration is also predicted.\n", "  A search for physics beyond the Standard Model, in final states with at least\none high transverse momentum charged lepton (electron or muon) and two\nadditional high transverse momentum leptons or jets, is performed using 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider in 2015 at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The upper end of the\ndistribution of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of leptons and jets is\nsensitive to the production of high-mass objects. No excess of events beyond\nStandard Model predictions is observed. Exclusion limits are set for models of\nmicroscopic black holes with two to six extra dimensions.\n", "  We give a pedagogical introduction to the Bethe ansatz techniques in\nintegrable QFTs and spin chains. We first discuss and motivate the general\nframework of asymptotic Bethe ansatz for the spectrum of integrable QFTs in\nlarge volume, based on the exact S-matrix. Then we illustrate this method in\nseveral concrete theories. The first case we study is the SU(2) chiral\nGross-Neveu model. We derive the Bethe equations via algebraic Bethe ansatz,\nsolving in the process the Heisenberg XXX spin chain. We discuss this famous\nspin chain model in some detail, covering in particular the coordinate Bethe\nansatz, some properties of Bethe states, and the classical scaling limit\nleading to finite-gap equations. Then we proceed to the more involved SU(3)\nchiral Gross-Neveu model and derive the Bethe equations using nested algebraic\nBethe ansatz to solve the arising SU(3) spin chain. Finally we show how a\nmethod similar to the Bethe ansatz works in a completley different setting,\nnamely for the 1d oscillator in quantum mechanics.\n  This article is part of a collection of introductory reviews originating from\nlectures given at the YRIS summer school in Durham during July 2015.\n", "  This review was born as notes for a lecture given at the YRIS school on\nintegrability in Durham, in the summer of 2015. It deals with a beautiful\nmethod, developed in the mid-nineties by V.V. Bazhanov, S.L. Lukyanov and A.B.\nZamolodchikov and, as such, called BLZ. This method can be interpreted as a\nfield theory version of the quantum inverse scattering (QIS), also known as\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA). Starting with the case of conformal field\ntheories (CFT) we show how to build the field theory analogues of commuting\ntransfer T matrices and Baxter Q-operators of integrable lattice models. These\nobjects contain the complete information of the integrable structure of the\ntheory, viz. the integrals of motion, and can be used, as we will show, to\nderive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and non-linear integral (NLIE)\nequations. This same method can be easily extended to the description of\nintegrable structures of certain particular massive deformations of CFTs;\nthese, in turn, can be described as quantum group reductions of the quantum\nsine-Gordon model and it is an easy step to include this last theory in the\nframework of BLZ approach. Finally we show an interesting and surprising\nconnection of the BLZ structures with classical objects emerging from the study\nof classical integrable models via the inverse scattering transform method.\nThis connection goes under the name of ODE/IM correspondence and we will\npresent it for the specific case of quantum sine-Gordon model only.\n", "  Data from spacecrafts tracking exhibit many anomalies that suggest the\ndependence of the speed of electromagnetic radiation with the motion of its\nsource. This dependence is different from that predicted from emission theories\nthat long ago have been demonstrated to be wrong. By relating the velocity of\nlight and the corresponding Doppler effect with the velocity of the source at\nthe time of detection, instead of the time of emission, it is possible to\nexplain quantitatively and qualitatively the spacecraft anomalies. Also, a\nformulation of electromagnetism compatible with this conception is possible\n(and also compatible with the known electromagnetic phenomena). Under this\ntheory the influence of the velocity of the source in the speed of light is\nsomewhat subtle in many practical situations and probably went unnoticed in\nother phenomena.\n", "  Low-dimensional electron systems fabricated from quantum matter have in\nrecent years become available and are being explored with great intensity. This\narticle gives an overview of the fundamental properties of such systems and\nsummarizes the state of the field. We furthermore present and consider the\nconcept of artificial atoms fabricated from quantum materials, anticipating\nremarkable scientific advances and possibly important applications of this new\nfield of research. The surprising properties of these artificial atoms and of\nmolecules or even of solids assembled from them are presented and discussed.\n", "  We determine the relation between the Comptonization parameter predicted\nusing X-ray data $Y_{C,Xray}$ and the X-ray luminosity $L_X$, both magnitudes\nderived from ROSAT data, with the Comptonization parameter $Y_{C,SZ}$ measured\non {\\it Planck} 2013 foreground cleaned Nominal maps. The 560 clusters of our\nsample includes clusters with masses $M\\ge 10^{13}M_\\odot$, one order of\nmagnitude smaller than those used by the Planck Collaboration in a similar\nanalysis. It also contains eight times more clusters in the redshift interval\n$z\\le 0.3$. The prediction of the $\\beta=2/3$ model convolved with the Planck\nantenna beam agrees with the anisotropies measured in foreground cleaned Planck\nNominal maps within the X-ray emitting region, confirming the results of an\nearlier analysis (Atrio-Barandela et al. 2008). The universal pressure profile\noverestimates the signal by a 15-21\\% depending on the angular aperture. We\nshow that the discrepancy is not due to the presence of {\\it cool-core} systems\nbut it is an indication of a brake in the $L_X-M$ relation towards low mass\nsystems. We show that relation of the Comptonization parameter averaged over\nthe region that emits 99\\% of the X-ray flux and and the X-ray luminosity is\nconsistent with the predictions of the self-similar model. We confirm previous\nfindings that the scaling relations studied here do not evolve with redshift\nwithin the range probed by our catalog.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the phase coherence of electron transport in\nedge states of the integer quantum Hall effect at filling factor $\\nu=2$, in\nthe presence of disorder and inter-edge state Coulomb interaction. Within a\nFokker-Planck approach, we calculate analytically the visibility of the\nAharonov-Bohm oscillations of the current through an electronic Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer. In agreement with recent experiments, we find that the\nvisibility is independent of the energy of the current-carrying electrons\ninjected high above the Fermi sea. Instead, it is the amount of disorder at the\nedge that sets the phase space available for inter-edge state energy exchange\nand thereby controls the visibility suppression.\n", "  Energy saving mechanisms are ubiquitous in nature. Aerodynamic and\nhydrodynamic drafting, vortice uplift, Bernoulli suction, thermoregulatory\ncoupling, path following, physical hooks, synchronization, and cooperation are\nonly some of the better-known examples. While drafting mechanisms also appear\nin non-biological systems such as sedimentation and particle vortices, the\nbroad spectrum of these mechanisms appears more diversely in biological systems\nincluding bacteria, spermatozoa, various aquatic species, birds, land animals,\nsemi-fluid dwellers like turtle hatchlings, as well as human systems. We\npresent the thermodynamic framework for energy saving mechanisms, and we review\nevidence in favor of the variation range hypothesis. This hypothesis posits\nthat, as an evolutionary process, the variation range between strongest and\nweakest group members converges on the equivalent energy saving quantity that\nis generated by the energy saving mechanism. We also review self-organized\nstructures that emerge due to energy saving mechanisms, including convective\nprocesses that can be observed in many systems over both short and long time\nscales, as well as high collective output processes in which a form of\ncollective position locking occurs.\n", "  We present the first major data release of the largest single key-project in\narea carried out in open time with the Herschel Space Observatory. The Herschel\nAstrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) is a survey of 600 deg^2 in\nfive photometric bands - 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 um - with the PACS and\nSPIRE cameras. In this paper and a companion paper (Bourne et al. 2016) we\npresent the survey of three fields on the celestial equator, covering a total\narea of 161.6 deg^2 and previously observed in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly\n(GAMA) spectroscopic survey. This paper describes the Herschel images and\ncatalogues of the sources detected on the SPIRE 250 um images. The 1-sigma\nnoise for source detection, including both confusion and instrumental noise, is\n7.4, 9.4 and 10.2 mJy at 250, 350 and 500 um. Our catalogue includes 120230\nsources in total, with 113995, 46209 and 11011 sources detected at >4-sigma at\n250, 350 and 500 um. The catalogue contains detections at >3-sigma at 100 and\n160 um for 4650 and 5685 sources, and the typical noise at these wavelengths is\n44 and 49 mJy. We include estimates of the completeness of the survey and of\nthe effects of flux bias and also describe a novel method for determining the\ntrue source counts. The H-ATLAS source counts are very similar to the source\ncounts from the deeper HerMES survey at 250 and 350 um, with a small difference\nat 500 um. Appendix A provides a quick start in using the released datasets,\nincluding instructions and cautions on how to use them.\n", "  Predicting when an individual will adopt a new behavior is an important\nproblem in application domains such as marketing and public health. This paper\nexamines the perfor- mance of a wide variety of social network based\nmeasurements proposed in the literature - which have not been previously\ncompared directly. We study the probability of an individual becoming\ninfluenced based on measurements derived from neigh- borhood (i.e. number of\ninfluencers, personal network exposure), structural diversity, locality,\ntemporal measures, cascade mea- sures, and metadata. We also examine the\nability to predict influence based on choice of classifier and how the ratio of\npositive to negative samples in both training and testing affect prediction\nresults - further enabling practical use of these concepts for social influence\napplications.\n", "  We study chemotaxis in a porous medium using as a model a biased (\"hungry\")\nrandom walk on a percolating cluster. In close resemblance to the 1980s arcade\ngame Pac-Man, the hungry random walker consumes food, which is initially\ndistributed in the maze, and biases its movement towards food-filled sites. We\nobserve that, on the percolating cluster, the mean-squared displacement of the\npacman process shows anomalous dynamics, which follow a power law with a\ndynamical exponent different from both that of a self avoiding random walk as\nwell as that of an unbiased random walk. The change in dynamics with the\npropensity to move towards food is well described by a dynamical exponent that\ndepends continuously on this propensity, and results in slower differential\ngrowth when compared to the unbiased random walk.\n", "  The Quintuplet cluster is one of the most massive star clusters in the Milky\nWay, situated very close to the Galactic center. We present a new search for\nvariable stars in the vicinity of the cluster, using the five-year database of\nthe Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Public Survey in the\nnear-infrared. A total of 7586 objects were identified in the zone around $2'$\nfrom the cluster center, using 55 $K_S$-band epochs. Thirty-three stars show\n$K_S$-band variability, 24 of them being previously undiscovered. Most of the\nvariable stars found are slow/semiregular variables, long-period variables of\nthe Mira type, and OH/IR stars. In addition, a good number of our candidates\nshow variations in a rather short timescale. We also propose four Young Stellar\nObject (YSO) candidates, which could be cluster members.\n", "  After the earthquake occurred in Molise (Central Italy) on 31st October 2002\n(Ml 5.4, 29 people dead), the local Servizio Regionale per la Protezione Civile\nto ensure a better analysis of local seismic data, through a convention with\nthe Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), promoted the design\nof the Regional Seismic Network (RMSM) and funded its implementation. The 5\nstations of RMSM worked since 2007 to 2013 collecting a large amount of seismic\ndata and giving an important contribution to the study of seismic sources\npresent in the region and the surrounding territory. This work reports about\nthe dataset containing all triggers collected by RMSM since July 2007 to March\n2009, including actual seismic events; among them, all earthquakes events\nrecorded in coincidence to Rete Sismica Nazionale Centralizzata (RSNC) of INGV\nhave been marked with S and P arrival timestamps. Every trigger has been\nassociated to a spectrogram defined into a recorded time vs. frequency domain.\nThe main aim of this structured dataset is to be used for further analysis with\ndata mining and machine learning techniques on image patterns associated to the\nwaveforms.\n", "  It is generally believed that the inter-edge coupling destroys the quantum\nspin Hall (QSH) effect along with the gap opening at the Dirac points. Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we find that the quantized edge transport\npersists in the presence of inter-edge coupling in Ta intercalated epitaxial\ngraphene on SiC(0001), being a QSH insulator with the non-trivial gap of 81\nmeV. In this case, the band is characterized by two perfect Dirac cones with\ndifferent Fermi velocities, yet only one maintains the edge state feature. We\nattribute such an anomalous behavior to the orbital-dependent decay of edge\nstates into the bulk, which allows the inter-edge coupling just between one\npair of edge states rather than two.\n", "  Chitin and protein are two main building blocks for many natural\nbiomaterials. The interaction between chitin and protein critically determines\nthe properties of the composite biological materials. As living organisms\nusually encounter complex ambient conditions like water, pH and ions are\ncritical factors towards the structural integrity of biomaterials. It is\ntherefore essential to study the chitin-protein interface under different\nenvironmental conditions. Here, an atomistic model consisting of a chitin\nsubstrate and a protein filament is constructed, which is regarded as a\nrepresentative of the chitin-protein interface existing in many chitin-based\nbiomaterials. Based on this model, the mechanical properties of chitin-protein\ninterface under different moisture and pH values are investigated through\nmolecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal a weakening effect of water\ntowards the chitin-protein interface, as well as acidity, i.e. the protonated\nprotein forms a stronger adhesion to chitin than that in the alkaline\nenvironment. In addition, the effect from side-chain of protein is studied and\nit is found that certain kinds of amino acid can form hydrophobic connections\nto chitin surface, which means that these peptides partly dodge the weakening\neffect of water. Our observation indicates that terminuses and side-chains in\nprotein are of importance in forming interfacial hydrogen bonds. From our full\natomistic models, we can observe some molecular mechanisms about how protein\ninteracts with chitin in different conditions, which may spotlight the\nengineering on biomaterials with similar interfaces.\n", "  We propose the quantum mechanical description of complex systems should be\nperformed using two types of causality relation: the ordering relation ($x\\prec\ny$) and the subset relation ($A\\subseteq B$). The structures with two ordering\noperations, called the causal sites, have been already proposed in context of\nquantum gravity (Christensen and Crane, 2005). We suggest they are also common\nto biological physics and may describe how the brain works. In the spirit of\nthe Penrose ideas we identify the geometry of the space-time with universal\nfield of consciousness. The latter has its evident counterparts in ancient\nIndian philosophy and provides a framework for unification of physical and\nmental phenomena.\n", "  Automated label-free quantitative imaging of biological samples can greatly\nbenefit high throughput diseases diagnosis. Digital holographic microscopy\n(DHM) is a powerful quantitative label-free imaging tool that retrieves\nstructural details of cellular samples non-invasively. In off-axis DHM, a\nproper spatial filtering window in Fourier space is crucial to the quality of\nreconstructed phase image. Here we describe a region-recognition approach that\ncombines shape recognition with an iterative thresholding to extracts the\noptimal shape of frequency components. The region recognition technique offers\nfully automated adaptive filtering that can operate with a variety of samples\nand imaging conditions. When imaging through optically scattering biological\nhydrogel matrix, the technique surpasses previous histogram thresholding\ntechniques without requiring any manual intervention. Finally, we automate the\nextraction of the statistical difference of optical height between malaria\nparasite infected and uninfected red blood cells. The method described here\npave way to greater autonomy in automated DHM imaging for imaging live cell in\nthick cell cultures.\n", "  Resistivities of single-crystalline as well as poly-crystalline samples of\nCeOBiS2 without fluorine doping were measured at temperatures down to 0.13 K,\nand were compared with those of poly-crystalline LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2. Both\npoly-crystalline and single-crystalline CeOBiS2 exhibited zero resistivity\nbelow 1.2 K while poly-crystalline LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2 did not show zero\nresistivity down to 0.13 K. Superconducting transition temperature of CeOBiS2\nwas reduced by increasing the applied current density. The superconductivity of\nCeOBiS2 without chemical doping is likely triggered by the carriers induced by\nthe valence fluctuation between Ce3+ and Ce4+.\n", "  We study the late time flow structure of Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.\nRecent numerical work has suggested a self-similar collapse of the development\nof this instability at late times, independent of the initial surface profile.\nUsing the form of collapse suggested, we derive an analytic expression for the\nmass-velocity relation in the spikes, and a global theory for the late time\nflow structure. We compare these results with fluid dynamical simulation.\n", "  Current state-of-the-art high contrast imaging instruments take advantage of\na number of elegant coronagraph designs to suppress starlight and image nearby\nfaint objects, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The ideal\nperformance and complexity of the optical systems depends strongly on the shape\nof the telescope aperture. Unfortunately, large primary mirrors tend to be\nsegmented and have various obstructions, which limit the performance of most\nconventional coronagraph designs. We present a new family of vortex\ncoronagraphs with numerically-optimized gray-scale apodizers that provide the\nsensitivity needed to directly image faint exoplanets with large, segmented\naperture telescopes, including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) as well as\npotential next-generation space telescopes.\n", "  Embedded diagrams are drawn for investigating the black hole of Kerr and\nnon-Kerr metric. Kerr black holes are characterized by masses $M$ and spin\nparameters $a$. Non-Kerr black holes also are characterized by the deformation\nparameters $\\epsilon$, which is related to shape of the black hole, in addition\nto their masses and spins. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of\nnon-Kerr black holes compared with Kerr black holes in the parameter space of\n($a$,$\\epsilon$) using embedded diagrams. The event horizons and the naked\nsingularity of non-Kerr BHs are discussed in detail.\n", "  Extragalactic jets originating from the central supermassive black holes of\nactive galaxies are powerful, highly relativistic plasma outflows, emitting\nlight from the radio up to the gamma-ray regime. The details of their\nformation, composition and emission mechanisms are still not completely clear.\nThe combination of high-resolution observations using very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) and multiwavelength monitoring provides the best insight\ninto these objects. Here, such a combined study of sources of the TANAMI sample\nis presented, investigating the parsec-scale and high-energy properties. The\nTANAMI program is a multiwavelength monitoring program of a sample of the radio\nand gamma-ray brightest extragalactic jets in the southern sky, below -30deg\ndeclination. We obtain the first-ever VLBI images for most of the sources,\nproviding crucial information on the jet kinematics and brightness distribution\nat milliarcsecond resolution. Two particular sources are discussed in detail:\nPMN J1603-4904, which can be classified either as an atypical blazar or a\ngamma-ray loud (young) radio galaxy, and Centaurus A, the nearest radio-loud\nactive galaxy. The VLBI kinematics of the innermost parsec of Centaurus A's jet\nresult in a consistent picture of an accelerated jet flow with a spine-sheath\nlike structure.\n", "  Many of the processes that underly neural computation are carried out by ion\nchannels embedded in the plasma membrane, a two-dimensional liquid that\nsurrounds all cells. Recent experiments have demonstrated that this membrane is\npoised close to a liquid-liquid critical point in the Ising universality class.\nHere we use both exact and stochastic techniques on the lattice Ising model to\nexplore the ramifications of proximity to criticality for proteins that are\nallosterically coupled to Ising composition modes. Owing to diverging\ngeneralized susceptibilities, such a protein's activity becomes strongly\ninfluenced by perturbations that influence the two relevant parameters of the\ncritical point, especially the critical temperature. In addition, the protein's\nkinetics acquire a range of time scales from its surrounding membrane,\nnaturally leading to non-Markovian dynamics.\n", "  The critical behavior of disordered systems-from metals (1) to magnets (2)\nand superconductors (3)-is often dominated by the behavior of rare regions of a\ncorrelated phase, which control the inception and dynamics of the phase\ntransition. Yet, despite significant theoretical (3,4,5) and experimental\n(6,7,8,9) interest, there has been little direct evidence of the presence of\nthese regions, or of their role in initiating transitions. Here, we provide\ndirect evidence for rare-region effects at the onset of superconductivity in\ngranular superconducting islands. By considering the strong diameter-dependence\nof the transition, as well as observations of large fluctuations in the\ntransition temperature as island diameters decrease, we are able to show that\nsuperconducting order first appears in unusually large grains- i.e. rare\nregions- within each island and, due to proximity coupling, spreads to other\ngrains. This work thus provides a quantitative, local understanding of the\nonset of correlated order in strongly disordered systems.\n", "  If a one-phrase summary of the subject of this thesis were required, it would\nbe something like: miscellaneous large (but finite) dimensional phenomena in\nquantum information theory. That said, it could nonetheless be helpful to\nbriefly elaborate. Starting from the observation that quantum physics\nunavoidably has to deal with high dimensional objects, basically two routes can\nbe taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones,\nor try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge\nin this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to\nfollow here, and rather oscillate between one and the other. In the first part\nof this manuscript, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the complexity of\ncertain quantum processes, while of course still preserving their essential\ncharacteristics. The two types of processes we are interested in are quantum\nchannels and quantum measurements. Oppositely, the second part of this\nmanuscript is specifically dedicated to the analysis of high dimensional\nquantum systems and some of their typical features. Stress is put on\nmultipartite systems and on entanglement-related properties of theirs. In the\nthird part of this manuscript we eventually come back to a more dimensionality\nreduction state of mind. This time though, the strategy is to make use of the\nsymmetries inherent to each particular situation we are looking at in order to\nderive a problem-dependent simplification.\n", "  By bearing the Komar's definition for the mass, together with the entropic\norigin of gravity in mind, we find the Einstein field equations in\n$(n+1$)-dimensional spacetime. Then, by reflecting the ($4+1$)-dimensional\nEinstein equations on the ($3+1$)-hypersurface, we get the Einstein equations\nonto the $3$-brane. The corresponding energy conditions are also addressed.\nSince the higher dimensional considerations modify the Einstein field equations\nin the ($3+1$)-dimensions and thus the energy-momentum tensor, we get a\nrelation for the Komar mass on the brane. In addition, the strongness of this\nrelation compared with existing definition for the Komar mass on the brane is\naddressed.\n", "  Present laboratory limits on the coupling strength of anomalous pseudoscalar\nand axial interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than their scalar\nand vector analogs. Here we investigate two mechanisms which can circumvent\nthis suppression and thereby lead to improved limits.\n", "  The understanding of various types of disorders in atomically thin transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including dangling bonds at the edges, chalcogen\ndeficiencies in the bulk, and charges in the substrate, is of fundamental\nimportance for their applications in electronics and photonics. Because of the\nimperfections, electrons moving on these two-dimensional (2D) crystals\nexperience a spatially non-uniform Coulomb environment, whose effect on the\ncharge transport has not been microscopically studied. Here, we report the\nmesoscopic conductance mapping in monolayer and few-layer MoS2 field-effect\ntransistors (FETs) by microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). The spatial\nevolution of the insulator-to-metal transition is clearly resolved.\nInterestingly, as the transistors are gradually turned on, electrical\nconduction emerges initially at the edges before appearing in the bulk of MoS2\nflakes, which can be explained by our first-principles calculations. The\nresults unambiguously confirm that the contribution of edge states to the\nchannel conductance is significant under the threshold voltage but negligible\nonce the bulk of the TMD device becomes conductive. Strong conductance\ninhomogeneity, which is associated with the fluctuations of disorder potential\nin the 2D sheets, is also observed in the MIM images, providing a guideline for\nfuture improvement of the device performance.\n", "  This paper reports a relation between ionic conductivity and electric current\nfluctuations. The relation was derived using statistical analysis and entropy\napproach. The relation can be used to calculate ionic conductivity.\n", "  We have studied the effect of Al doping on the structural, magnetic and\nelectrical properties of La$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Mn$_{1-x}$Al$_x$O$_3$ ($0\\leq x \\leq\n0.25$) manganite, annealed in two 750$^oC$ and 1350$^oC$ temperatures. The XRD\nanalysis shows that the structures in all samples have single phase\nrhombohedral structure with R$\\bar{3}$c space group. The unit cell volume\nalmost decrease with increasing the Al doping in all samples. The grain growth\nwith increasing annealing temperature and Al doping also have been studied. We\nobserved that, T$_c$ temperature decreases when the Al ion substitute in Mn ion\nsite. The magnetic study of the samples via magnetic susceptibility results in\nGriffiths and spin-glass phase for samples doped with aluminium. Along the\nresistivity measurement results, the $T_{MIT}$ (metal-insulator) transition\ntemperatures decrease and the system become an insulator. The insulator-metal\ntransition occurs for L0 sample in near 165K, while this transition is weak for\nH0 sample due to oxygen non-stoichiometry.Using three models viz. 1. Adiabatic\nsmall polaron hoping, 2.Variable range hopping, and 3. Percolation model, the\nresistance have been studied.\n", "  The purpose of the present study is to search one-dimensional Cellular\nAutomata (CA) rules which will solve the density classification task (DCT)\nperfectly. The mathematical analysis of number conserving functions over binary\nstrings of length n gives an indication of its corresponding number conserving\ncellular automata rules (either uniform or non-uniform). The state transition\ndiagrams (STDs) of number conserving CA rules have been analyzed where it has\nbeen found that these STDs can generate different DCT solutions. While studying\nthe properties of STDs, an interesting classification of binary strings could\nbe made where equal weight strings form a class and the cardinality of each\nclass is same as the binomial coefficient nCk; n is the length and k is the\nweight of the binary string. Apart from STDs, other deterministic methods have\nbeen proposed to obtain the exact solution of DCT. All these exact solutions of\nDCT using different deterministic methods can be viewed as an improvement over\nthe soft computing techniques used earlier to obtain approximate solutions.\n", "  1. Parameter inference from distorted measurements is discussed. 2. Smeared\nmeasurements are unfolded without explicit regularization. The corresponding\nresults are unbiased and permit to fit parameters and to apply quantitative\ngoodness-of-fit tests. 3. Common unfolding methods (iterative EM with early\nstopping, truncated SVD, ML fits with curvature, entropy and norm penalties)\nare tested and compared to each other with the regularization parameter\nadjusted to minimize the integrated square error (ISE) in all cases. Apart from\nhistogram representations, spline approximations are considered. All\nsimulations indicate that the EM method leads to smaller ISEs than the\ncompeting approaches. Especially promising is the EM unfolding to spline\napproximations.\n  The studies are based on different distributions, event numbers, resolutions\nand enough independent simulations to obtain conclusive results. It is proposed\nto unfold data with the EM method to b-spline approximations and to supplement\nthe results with histograms and error matrices obtained by unfolding into\nrelative wide bins without explicit regularization.\n", "  We have investigated the 6Li(gamma,d) reaction theoretically for the\nformation of the eta'(958) mesic nucleus close to the recoilless kinematics. We\nhave developed the theoretical formula and reported the quantitative results of\nthe formation spectra for various cases in this article. We have found that the\nformation cross sections are reduced by the effects of the fragile deuteron\nform factor.\n", "  We present a systematic study of modified gravity (MG) models containing a\nsingle scalar field non-minimally coupled to the metric. Despite a large\nparameter space, exploiting the effective field theory of dark energy (EFT of\nDE) formulation and imposing simple physical constraints such as stability\nconditions and (sub-)luminal propagation of perturbations, we arrive at a\nnumber of generic predictions about the large scale structures.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of a high quality WSe$% _{2} $ leads to\nthe possibility of magneto-optical measurements and the manipulation of the\nspin and valley degrees of freedom. We study the influence of the very strong\nspin-orbit coupling and of the anisotropic lifting of the valley pseudospin\ndegeneracy on its magnetotransport properties. The energy spectrum of WSe$_{2}\n$ is derived and discussed in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field\n$B$. Correspondingly we evaluate the magneto-optical Hall conductivity and the\noptical longitudinal conductivity as functions of the frequency, magnetic\nfield, and Fermi energy. They are strongly influenced by the field $B$ and the\nstrong spin splitting. The former exhibits valley polarization and the latter\nbeatings of oscillations. The magneto-optical responses can be tuned in two\ndifferent regimes: the mictrowave-to-terahertz regime and the visible-frequency\none. The absorption peaks involving the $n=0$ LL appear in between these two\nregimes and show a magnetic control of the spin and valley splittings. We also\nevaluate the power absorption spectrum.\n", "  We have performed systematic large-scale all-electron correlated calculations\non boron Bn, aluminum Aln and magnesium Mgn clusters (n=2--5), to study their\nlinear optical absorption spectra. Several possible isomers of each cluster\nwere considered, and their geometries were optimized at the coupled-cluster\nsingles doubles (CCSD) level of theory. Using the optimized ground-state\ngeometries, excited states of different clusters were computed using the\nmulti-reference singles-doubles configuration interaction (MRSDCI) approach,\nwhich includes electron correlation effects at a sophisticated level. These CI\nwavefunctions were used to compute the transition dipole matrix elements\nconnecting the ground and various excited states of different clusters,\neventually leading to their linear absorption spectra. The convergence of our\nresults with respect to the basis sets, and the size of the CI expansion was\ncarefully examined. Isomers of a given cluster show a distinct signature\nspectrum, indicating a strong structure property relationship. This fact can be\nused in experiments to distinguish between different isomers of a cluster.\nOwing to the sophistication of our calculations, our results can be used for\nbenchmarking of the absorption spectra and be used to design superior\ntime-dependent density functional theoretical (TDDFT) approaches. The\ncontribution of configurations to many-body wavefunction of various excited\nstates suggests that in most cases optical excitations involved are collective,\nand plasmonic in nature. Optical absorption in planar boron clusters in wheel\nshape, B7, B8 and B9 computed using EOM-CCSD approach, have been compared to\nthe results obtained from TDDFT approach with a number of functionals. This\nbenchmarking reveals that range-separated functionals such as wB97xD and\nCAM-B3LYP give qualitatively as well as quantitatively the same results as that\nof EOM-CCSD.\n", "  In this paper we present a combined photometric, spectroscopic and orbital\nperiod study of three early-type eclipsing binary systems: XZ Aql, UX Her, and\nAT Peg. As a result, we have derived the absolute parameters of their\ncomponents and, on that basis, we discuss their evolutionary states.\nFurthermore, we compare their parameters with those of other binary systems and\nwith the theoretical models. An analysis of all available up-to-date times of\nminima indicated that all three systems studied here show cyclic orbital\nchanges, their origin is discussed in detail. Finally, we performed a frequency\nanalysis for possible pulsational behavior and as a result we suggest that XZ\nAql hosts a {\\delta} Scuti component.\n", "  In a previous work [Int. J. Mod. Phys. E 24, 1550073 (2015)], hereafter\nreferred as paper I, we have investigated the ground-state properties of Nd, Ce\nand Sm isotopes within Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with SLy5 skyrme force in\nwhich the pairing strength has been generalized with a new proposed formula.\nHowever, that formula is more appropriate for the region of Nd. In this work,\nwe have studied the ground-state properties of both even-even and odd Mo and Ru\nisotopes. For this, we have used Hartree- Fock-Bogoliubov method with SLy4\nskyrme force, and a new formula of the pairing strength which is more accurate\nfor this region of nuclei. The results have been compared with available\nexperimental data, the results of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on\nthe D1S Gogny effective nucleon-nucleon interaction and predictions of some\nnuclear models such as Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM) and Relativistic Mean\nField (RMF) theory.\n", "  The quantum rotor is shown to be supersymmetric. The supercharge $Q$, whose\nsquare equals the Hamiltonian, is constructed with reflection operators. The\nconserved quantities that commute with $Q$ form the algebra $so(3)_{-1}$, an\nanticommutator version of $so(3)$. The subduced representation of $so(3)_{-1}$\non the space of spherical harmonics with total angular momentum $j$ is\nconstructed and found to decompose into two irreducible components. Two natural\nbases for the irreducible representation spaces of $so(3)_{-1}$ are introduced\nand their overlap coefficients prove expressible in terms of orthogonal\npolynomials of a discrete variable called anti-Krawtchouk polynomials.\n", "  Lump solutions are analytical rational function solutions localized in all\ndirections in space. We analyze a class of lump solutions, generated from\nquadratic functions, to nonlinear partial differential equations. The basis of\nsuccess is the Hirota bilinear formulation and the primary object is the class\nof positive multivariate quadratic functions. A complete determination of\nquadratic functions positive in space and time is given, and positive quadratic\nfunctions are characterized as sums of squares of linear functions. Necessary\nand sufficient conditions for positive quadratic functions to solve Hirota\nbilinear equations are presented, and such polynomial solutions yield lump\nsolutions to nonlinear partial differential equations under the dependent\nvariable transformations u=2(ln f)_x and u=2(ln f)_{xx}, where x is one spatial\nvariable. Applications are made for a few generalized KP and BKP equations.\n", "  In this work, in the light of the developments for indefinite metric theories\nmade by Lee and Wick, we study perturbative unitarity in a Lorentz-invariance\nviolating QED model with higher-order operators. We show that by following the\nLee-Wick prescription it is possible to preserve unitarity in the model at\none-loop order in the coupling.\n", "  The different appearances exhibited by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are\nbelieved to be in part the result of different orientations of their main axis\nof symmetry, consistent with a flux-rope configuration. There are observational\nreports of CMEs seen along their main axis (axial perspective) and\nperpendicular to it (lateral perspective), but no simultaneous observations of\nboth perspectives from the same CME have been reported to date. The\nstereoscopic views of the telescopes onboard the $Solar$-$Terrestrial$\n$Relations$ $Observatory$ (STEREO) twin spacecraft, in combination with the\nviews from the $Solar$ $and$ $Heliospheric$ $Observatory$ (SOHO) and the\n$Solar$ $Dynamics$ $Observatory$ (SDO), allow us to study the axial and lateral\nperspectives of a CME simultaneously for the first time. In addition, this\nstudy shows that the lateral angular extent ($L$) increases linearly with time,\nwhile the angular extent of the axial perspective ($D$) presents this behavior\nonly from the low corona to $\\approx\\,$5 $R_{\\odot}$, where it slows down. The\nratio $L/D \\approx\\,$1.6 obtained here as the average over several points in\ntime is consistent with measurements of $L$ and $D$ previously performed on\nevents exhibiting only one of the perspectives from the single vantage point\nprovided by SOHO.\n", "  Charge transfer is a fundamental process that underlies a multitude of\nphenomena in chemistry and biology. Recent advances in observing and\nmanipulating charge and heat transport at the nanoscale, and recently developed\ntechniques for monitoring temperature at high temporal and spatial resolution,\nimply the need for considering electron transfer across thermal gradients.\nHere, a theory is developed for the rate of electron transfer and the\nassociated heat transport between donor-acceptor pairs located at sites of\ndifferent temperatures. To this end, through application of a generalized\nmultidimensional transition state theory, the traditional Arrhenius picture of\nactivation energy as a single point on a free energy surface is replaced with a\nbithermal property that is derived from statistical weighting over all\nconfigurations where the reactant and product states are equienergetic. The\nflow of energy associated with the electron transfer process is also examined,\nleading to relations between the rate of heat exchange among the donor and\nacceptor sites as functions of the temperature difference and the electronic\ndriving bias. In particular, we find that an open electron transfer channel\ncontributes to enhanced heat transport between sites even when they are in\nelectronic equilibrium. The presented results provide a unified theory for\ncharge transport and the associated heat conduction between sites at different\ntemperatures.\n", "  The influence of the cold nuclear matter effects on the Coulomb barriers and\nalso on the fusion cross sections of 47 fusion reactions are systematically\ninvestigated within the framework of the proximity formalism. For this purpose,\nI modify the original version of this formalism (Prox. 77) using a new\nanalytical form of the universal function which is formulated based on the\ndouble-folding model with three density-dependent versions of the M3Y-type\ninteractions, namely DDM3Y1, CDM3Y3 and BDM3Y1. It is found that when the Prox.\n77 potential is accompanied by each of the formulated universal functions, the\nagreement between the theoretical and experimental data of the barrier height\nand also the fusion cross section increase for our selected fusion systems. The\npresent study also provides appropriate conditions to explore theoretically the\nvariation effects of the NM incompressibility constant $K$ on the calculated\nresults caused by the Prox. 77 model. It is shown that the accuracy of this\npotential model for reproducing the experimental fusion data enhances by\nincreasing the strength of this constant. A discussion is also presented about\nthe role of various physical effects in the theoretical results of the\nproximity approach.\n", "  Solid embryos of the Earth and the Moon, as well as trans-Neptunian binaries,\ncould form as a result of contraction of the rarefied condensation which was\nparental for a binary. The angular momentum of the condensation needed for\nformation of a satellite system could be mainly acquired at the collision of\ntwo rarefied condensations at which the parental condensation formed. The\nminimum value of the mass of the parental condensation for the Earth-Moon\nsystem could be about 0.02 of the Earth mass. Besides the main collision, which\nwas followed by formation of the condensation that was a parent for the embryos\nof the Earth and the Moon, there could be another main collision of the\nparental condensation with another condensation. The second main collision (or\na series of similar collisions) could change the tilt of the Earth. Depending\non eccentricities of the planetesimals that collided with the embryos, the Moon\ncould acquire 0.04-0.3 of its mass at the stage of accumulation of solid bodies\nwhile the mass of the growing Earth increased by a factor of ten.\n", "  In many analyses in high energy physics, attempts are made to remove the\neffects of detector smearing in data by techniques referred to as \"unfolding\"\nhistograms, thus obtaining estimates of the true values of histogram bin\ncontents. Such unfolded histograms are then compared to theoretical\npredictions, either to judge the goodness of fit of a theory, or to compare the\nabilities of two or more theories to describe the data. When doing this, even\ninformally, one is testing hypotheses. However, a more fundamentally sound way\nto test hypotheses is to smear the theoretical predictions by simulating\ndetector response and then comparing to the data without unfolding; this is\nalso frequently done in high energy physics, particularly in searches for new\nphysics. One can thus ask: to what extent does hypothesis testing after\nunfolding data materially reproduce the results obtained from testing by\nsmearing theoretical predictions? We argue that this \"bottom-line-test\" of\nunfolding methods should be studied more commonly, in addition to common\npractices of examining variance and bias of estimates of the true contents of\nhistogram bins. We illustrate bottom-line-tests in a simple toy problem with\ntwo hypotheses.\n", "  The Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland operates the high intensity proton\naccelerator facility HIPA. A 590 MeV kinetic energy proton beam of presently up\nto 2.4 mA is sent to target stations producing pions, muons and neutrons for\nfundamental and applied physics. The beam power of 1.4 MW provides the world's\nhighest intensities of low momentum muons which can be stopped in low mass\ntargets. Rates of surface muons of up to about $10^8$/s are being provided to\nvarious unique precision particle physics experiments. Two feasibility studies\nare ongoing to considerably improve the available muon beams. The high\nintensity muon beamline, HiMB, could deliver on the order of $10^{10}$/s\nsurface muons and the stopped muon cooler, muCool, aims at a gain factor of\n$10^{10}$ in phase space quality while sacrificing only less than 3 orders of\nmagnitude in intensity for low energy $\\mu^+$. These beams will allow a new\ngeneration of precision physics experiments with stopped muons and muonium\natoms.\n", "  A common defect of the Roe scheme is the production of non-physical expansion\nshock and shock instability. An improved method with several advantages was\npresented to suppress the shock instability. However, this method cannot\nprevent expansion shock and is incompatible with the traditional curing method\nfor expansion shock. Therefore, the traditional curing mechanism is analyzed.\nThe discussion explains the effectiveness of the traditional curing method and\nidentifies several defects, one of which leads to incompatibility between\ncuring the shock instability and expansion shock. Consequently, a new improved\nRoe scheme is proposed in this study. This scheme is concise, easy to\nimplement, low computational cost, and robust. More importantly, the scheme can\nsimultaneously cure the shock instability and expansion shock without\nadditional costs.\n", "  Violations of the Lorentz and CPT symmetries can appear as observable effects\nin the direct production of top quarks and their subsequent decays. Earlier\nresults for the $q\\bar{q}$ production process for $t\\bar{t}$ pairs have been\nextended to include the gluon fusion process which dominates at the LHC. In\naddition results are obtained for testing CPT symmetry through single top quark\nproduction.\n", "  We consider the application of Koopman theory to nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations. We demonstrate that the observables chosen for\nconstructing the Koopman operator are critical for enabling an accurate\napproximation to the nonlinear dynamics. If such observables can be found, then\nthe dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be enacted to compute a\nfinite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator, including its\neigenfunctions, eigenvalues and Koopman modes. Judiciously chosen observables\nlead to physically interpretable spatio-temporal features of the complex system\nunder consideration and provide a connection to manifold learning methods. We\ndemonstrate the impact of observable selection, including kernel methods, and\nconstruction of the Koopman operator on two canonical, nonlinear PDEs: Burgers'\nequation and the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. These examples serve to\nhighlight the most pressing and critical challenge of Koopman theory: a\nprincipled way to select appropriate observables.\n", "  We give a construction of completely integrable $(2m)$-dimensional\nHamiltonian systems with cubic Hamilton functions. The construction depends on\na constant skew-Hamiltonian matrix $A$, that is, a matrix satisfying $A^{\\rm\nT}J=JA$, where $J$ is a non-degenerate skew-symmetric matrix defining the\nstandard symplectic structure on the phase space $\\mathbb R^{2m}$. Applying to\nany such system the so called Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretization scheme, we\narrive at a birational $(2m)$-dimensional map. We show that this map is\nsymplectic with respect to a symplectic structure that is a perturbation of the\nstandard symplectic structure on $\\mathbb R^{2m}$, and possesses $m$\nindependent integrals of motion, which are perturbations of the original\nHamilton functions and are in involution with respect to the invariant\nsymplectic structure. Thus, this map is completely integrable in the\nLiouville-Arnold sense. Moreover, under a suitable normalization of the\noriginal $m$-tuples of commuting vector fields, their Kahan-Hirota-Kimura\ndiscretizations also commute and share the invariant symplectic structure and\nthe $m$ integrals of motion.\n", "  We have observed a super-giant (~10,000,000%) negative magnetoresistance at\n39 mT field in Cu nanowires contacted with Au contact pads. In these nanowires,\npotential barriers form at the two Cu/Au interfaces because of Cu oxidation\nthat results in an ultrathin copper oxide layer forming between Cu and Au.\nCurrent flows when electrons tunnel through, and/or thermionically emit over,\nthese barriers. A magnetic field applied transverse to the direction of current\nflow along the wire deflects electrons toward one edge of the wire because of\nthe Lorentz force, causing electron accumulation at that edge and depletion at\nthe other. This lowers the potential barrier at the accumulated edge and raises\nit at the depleted edge, causing a super-giant magnetoresistance at room\ntemperature.\n", "  Experimental tests of the newtonian inverse square law at short range, one at\nIndiana University and the other at the Huazhong University of Science and\nTechnology, have been used to set limits on Lorentz violation in the pure\ngravity sector of the nonminimal Standard-Model Extension. In the\nnonrelativistic limit, the constraints derived for the 14 independent SME\ncoefficients for Lorentz violation acting simultaneously are of order $10^{-9}$\nm$^{2}$.\n", "  A plethora of natural, artificial and social complex systems exists which\nviolate the basic hypothesis (e.g., ergodicity) of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)\nstatistical mechanics. Many of such cases can be satisfactorily handled by\nintroducing nonadditive entropic functionals, such as $S_q\\equiv\nk\\frac{1-\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1} \\; \\Bigl(q \\in {\\cal R}; \\, \\sum_{i=1}^W\np_i=1 \\Bigr)$, with $S_1=S_{BG}\\equiv -k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i$. Each class\nof such systems can be characterized by a set of values $\\{q\\}$, directly\ncorresponding to its various physical/dynamical/geometrical properties. A most\nimportant subset is usually referred to as the $q$-triplet, namely\n$(q_{sensitivity}, q_{relaxation}, q_{stationary\\,state})$, defined in the body\nof this paper. In the BG limit we have\n$q_{sensitivity}=q_{relaxation}=q_{stationary\\,state}=1$. For a given class of\ncomplex systems, the set $\\{q\\}$ contains only a few independent values of $q$,\nall the others being functions of those few. An illustration of this structure\nwas given in 2005 [Tsallis, Gell-Mann and Sato, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. USA {\\bf\n102}, 15377; TGS]. This illustration enabled a satisfactory analysis of the\nVoyager 1 data on the solar wind. But the general form of these structures\nstill is an open question. This is so, for instance, for the challenging\n$q$-triplet associated with the edge of chaos of the logistic map. We introduce\nhere a transformation which sensibly generalizes the TGS one, and which might\nconstitute an important step towards the general solution.\n", "  In this talk, the gravity sector of the effective field theory description of\nlocal Lorentz violation is discussed, including minimal and nonminimal\ncurvature couplings. Also, recent experimental and observational analyses\nincluding solar-system ephemeris and short-range gravity tests are reviewed.\n", "  This study explores a new security problem existing in various\nstate-of-the-art quantum private comparison (QPC) protocols, where a malicious\nthird-party (TP) announces fake comparison (or intermediate) results. In this\ncase, the participants could eventually be led to a wrong direction and the QPC\nwill become fraudulent. In order to resolve this problem, a new level of\ntrustworthiness for TP is defined and a new QPC protocol is proposed, where a\nsecond TP is introduced to monitor the first one. Once a TP announces a fake\ncomparison (or intermediate) result, participants can detect the fraud\nimmediately. Besides, due to the introduction of the second TP, the proposed\nprotocol allows strangers to compare their secrets privately, whereas the\nstate-of-the-art QPCs require the involved clients to know each other before\nrunning the protocol.\n", "  We study the energy distribution in the extended resonant level model at\nequilibrium. Previous investigations [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 89}, 161306 (2014),\nPhys. Rev. B {\\bf 93}, 115318 (2016)] have found, for a resonant electronic\nlevel interacting with a thermal free electron wide-band bath, that the\nexpectation value for the energy of the interacting subsystem can be correctly\ncalculated by considering a symmetric splitting of the interaction Hamiltonian\nbetween the subsystem and the bath. However, the general implications of this\napproach were questioned [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 92}, 235440 (2015)]. Here we show\nthat already at equilibrium, such splitting fails to describe the energy\nfluctuations, as measured here by the second and third central moments (namely\nwidth and skewness) of the energy distribution. Furthermore, we find that when\nthe wide-band approximation does not hold, no splitting of the system-bath\ninteraction can describe the system thermodynamics. We conclude that in general\nno proper division subsystem of the Hamiltonian of the composite system can\naccount for the energy distribution of the subsystem. This also implies that\nthe thermodynamic effects due to local changes in the subsystem cannot in\ngeneral be described by such splitting.\n", "  The concept of stimulated emission of bosons has played an important role in\nmodern science and technology, and constitutes the working principle for\nlasers. In a stimulated emission process, an incoming photon enhances the\nprobability that an excited atomic state will transition to a lower energy\nstate and generate a second photon of the same energy. It is expected, but not\nexperimentally shown, that stimulated emission contributes significantly to the\nzero resistance current in a superconductor by enhancing the probability that\nscattered Cooper pairs will return to the macroscopically occupied condensate\ninstead of entering any other state. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy to study the initial rise of the non-equilibrium\nquasiparticle population in a Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ cuprate\nsuperconductor induced by an ultrashort laser pulse. Our finding reveals\nsignificantly slower buildup of quasiparticles in the superconducting state\nthan in the normal state. The slower buildup only occurs when the pump pulse is\ntoo weak to deplete the superconducting condensate, and for cuts inside the\nFermi arc region. We propose this is a manifestation of stimulated\nrecombination of broken Cooper pairs, and signals an important momentum space\ndichotomy in the formation of Cooper pairs inside and outside the Fermi arc\nregion.\n", "  Broken fourfold rotational (C$_4$) symmetry is observed in the experimental\nproperties of several classes of unconventional superconductors. It has been\nproposed that this symmetry breaking is important for superconducting pairing\nin these materials, but in the high superconducting transition temperature\n(high-T$_{\\mathrm{c}}$) cuprates this broken symmetry has never been observed\non the Fermi surface. We have measured a pronounced anisotropy in the angle\ndependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance of the underdoped\nhigh-T$_{\\mathrm{c}}$) superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.58}$, directly\nrevealing broken C$_4$ symmetry on the Fermi surface. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat this Fermi surface has C$_2$ symmetry of the type produced by a uniaxial\nor anisotropic density-wave phase. This establishes the central role of C$_4$\nsymmetry breaking in the Fermi surface reconstruction of\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\\delta}$, and suggests a striking degree of universality\namong unconventional superconductors.\n", "  Since the current transportation sector is the largest consumer of oil, and\nsubsequently responsible for major air pollutants, it is inevitable to use\nalternative renewable sources of energies for vehicular applications. The\nhydrogen energy seems to be a promising candidate. To explore the possibility\nof achieving a solid-state high-capacity storage of hydrogen for onboard\napplications, we have performed first principles density functional theoretical\ncalculations of hydrogen storage properties of beryllium oxide clusters\n(BeO)$_{n}$ (n=2 -- 8). We observed that polar BeO bond is responsible for\nH$_{2}$ adsorption. The problem of cohesion of beryllium atoms does not arise,\nas they are an integral part of BeO clusters. The (BeO)$_{n}$ (n=2 -- 8)\nadsorbs 8--12 H$_{2}$ molecules with an adsorption energy in the desirable\nrange of reversible hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of H$_{2}$\nadsorbed on BeO clusters meets the ultimate 7.5 wt% limit, recommended for\nonboard practical applications.\n  In conclusion, beryllium oxide clusters exhibit a remarkable solid-state\nhydrogen storage.\n", "  Protein molecules in cells are synthesized by macromolecular machines called\nribosomes. According to recent experimental data, we reduce the complexity of\nthe ribosome and propose a model to express its activity in six main states.\nUsing our model, we study the translation rate in different biological relevant\nsituations in the presence of external force, and translation through the RNA\ndouble stranded region in the absence or presence of the external force. In the\npresent study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that\nthe ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor. Our findings could\nshed some light on understanding behaviors of the ribosome in biological\nconditions.\n", "  N-dimensional B\\\"acklund transformation (BT), Cole-Hopf transformation and\nAuto-B\\\"acklund transformation (Auto-BT) of n-dimensional Burgers system are\nderived by using simplified homogeneous balance (SHB). By the Auto-BT, another\nsolution of the n-dimensional Burgers system can be obtained provided that a\nparticular solution of the Burgers system is given. Since the particular\nsolution of n-dimensional Burgers system can be given easily by the Cole-Hopf\ntransformation, then using the Auto-BT repeatedly, more solutions of\nn-dimensional Burgers system can be obtained successively\n", "  In this paper is presented explicit improved numerical generalization of\nBethe-Weizsacker mass formulae which describes the values of measured 2654\nnuclear mass in AME2012 nuclear database with accuracy less than 2.2 MeV,\nstarting from the number of protons Z=1 and number of neutrons N=1. In the\nobtained generazation of the Bethe-Weizsacker formula the influence of magic\nnumbers and boundaries of their influence between them is defined for nine\nproton (2, 8, 14, 20, 28, 50, 82, 108, 124) and ten neutron (2, 8, 14, 20, 28,\n50, 82, 124, 152, 202) magic numbers.\n", "  Astroparticle experiments such as IceCube or MAGIC require a deconvolution of\ntheir measured data with respect to the response function of the detector to\nprovide the distributions of interest, e.g. energy spectra. In this paper,\nappropriate uncertainty limits that also allow to draw conclusions on the\ngeometric shape of the underlying distribution are determined using bootstrap\nmethods, which are frequently applied in statistical applications. Bootstrap is\na collective term for resampling methods that can be employed to approximate\nunknown probability distributions or features thereof. A clear advantage of\nbootstrap methods is their wide range of applicability. For instance, they\nyield reliable results, even if the usual normality assumption is violated.\n  The use, meaning and construction of uncertainty limits to any user-specific\nconfidence level in the form of confidence intervals and levels are discussed.\nThe precise algorithms for the implementation of these methods, applicable for\nany deconvolution algorithm, are given. The proposed methods are applied to\nMonte Carlo simulations to show their feasibility and their precision in\ncomparison to the statistical uncertainties calculated with the deconvolution\nsoftware TRUEE.\n", "  Social Networks allow users to self-present by sharing personal contents with\nothers which may add comments. Recent studies highlighted how the emotions\nexpressed in a post affect others' posts, eliciting a congruent emotion. So\nfar, no studies have yet investigated the emotional coherence between wall\nposts and its comments. This research evaluated posts and comments mood of\nFacebook profiles, analyzing their linguistic features, and a measure to assess\nan excessive self-presentation was introduced. Two new experimental measures\nwere built, describing the emotional loading (positive and negative) of posts\nand comments, and the mood correspondence between them was evaluated. The\nprofiles \"empathy\", the mood coherence between post and comments, was used to\ninvestigate the relation between an excessive self-presentation and the\nemotional coherence of a profile. Participants publish a higher average number\nof posts with positive mood. To publish an emotional post corresponds to get\nmore likes, comments and receive a coherent mood of comments, confirming the\nemotional contagion effect reported in literature. Finally, the more empathetic\nprofiles are characterized by an excessive self-presentation, having more\nposts, and receiving more comments and likes. To publish emotional contents\nappears to be functional to receive more comments and likes, fulfilling needs\nof attention-seeking.\n", "  Saturn's quasi-periodic planet-encircling storms are the largest convecting\noutbursts in the Solar System. The last eruption was in 1990. A new eruption\nstarted in December 2010 and presented the first-ever opportunity to observe\nsuch episodic storms from a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn. Here, we analyze\nimages acquired with the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), which\ncaptured the storm's birth, evolution and demise. In studying the end of the\nconvective activity, we also analyze the Saturn Electrostatic Discharge (SED)\nsignals detected by the Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument.

The model is studied using the recently proposed\nresummed thermodynamic perturbation theory for central force (RTPT-CF)\nassociating potentials. The phase diagram has the fluid branch of the\nfluid-solid coexistence curve located at a temperatures lower than those of the\nsolid branch. This unusual behaviour is related to the strong dependence of the\nsystem excluded volume on the temperature, which for the model at hand\ndecreases with increasing temperature. This effect can be also seen for a wide\nfamily of fluid models with an effective interaction that combines short range\nattraction and repulsion at a larger distance. We expect that for sufficiently\nhigh repulsive barrier, such systems may show similar phase behaviour.\n", "  The observation of neutron to antineutron oscillation would be the first\nexperimental evidence to show that baryon number is not a conserved quantity.\nIt also provides an answer to the hypothesized post-sphaleron baryogenesis\nmechanism shortly after the Big Bang. The free oscillation time\n{\\tau_{n\\rightarrow\\bar{n}} has a lower limit at 8.7 x 10^7 seconds determined\nat ILL in 1994. Current beyond Standard Model theories of this oscillation time\nestimate the value to be on the order of 10^{10} seconds. A new experiment is\nproposed at the European Spallation Source that has 1000 times the sensitivity\nof the previous experiment, and would confirm the viability of those beyond\nStandard Model theories.\n", "  We examine two types of guided waves: the Love and the quasi-Rayleigh waves.\nBoth waves propagate in the same model of an elastic isotropic layer above an\nelastic isotropic halfspace. From their dispersion relations, we calculate\ntheir speeds as functions of the elasticity parameters, mass densities,\nfrequency and layer thickness. We examine the sensitivity of these relations to\nthe model and wave properties.\n", "  Non-locality is crucial to understand the plastic flow of an amorphous\nmaterial, and has been successfully described by the fluidity, along with a\ncooperativity length scale {\\xi}. We demonstrate, by applying the scaling\nhypothesis to the yielding transition, that non-local effects in non-uniform\nstress configurations can be explained within the framework of critical\nphenomena. From the scaling description, scaling relations between different\nexponents are derived, and collapses of strain rate profiles are made both in\nshear driven and pressure driven flow. We find that the cooperative length in\nnon-local flow is governed by the same correlation length in finite dimensional\nhomogeneous flow, excluding the mean field exponents. We also show that\nnon-locality also affects the finite size scaling of the yield stress,\nespecially the large finite size effects observed in pressure driven flow. Our\ntheoretical results are nicely verified by the elasto-plastic model, and\nexperimental data.\n", "  This paper describes the impedance spectroscopy adapted for analysis of small\nelectrochemical changes in fluids. To increase accuracy of measurements the\ndifferential approach with temperature stabilization of fluid samples and\nelectronics is used. The impedance analysis is performed by the single point\nDFT, signal correlation, calculation of RMS amplitudes and interference phase\nshift. For test purposes the samples of liquids and colloids are treated by\nfully shielded electromagnetic generators and passive cone-shaped structures.\nFluidic samples collected from different geological locations are also\nanalysed. In all tested cases we obtained different results for impacted and\nnon-impacted samples, moreover, a degradation of electrochemical stability\nafter treatment is observed. This method is used in laboratory analysis of weak\nemissions and ensures a high repeatability of results.\n", "  Ultracold neutrons were used to search for signals indicating the violation\nof Lorentz and CPT invariance or the existence of dark matter using the\nspectrometer to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron.\n", "  We report on mesoscopic transport fingerprints in disordered graphene caused\nby strain-field induced pseudomagnetic Landau levels (pLLs). Efficient\nnumerical real space calculations of the Kubo formula are performed for an\nordered network of nanobubbles in graphene, creating pseudomagnetic fields up\nto several hundreds of Tesla, values inaccessible by real magnetic fields.\nStrain-induced pLLs yield enhanced scattering effects across the energy\nspectrum resulting in lower mean free path and enhanced localization effects.\nIn the vicinity of the zeroth order pLL, we demonstrate an anomalous transport\nregime, where the mean free paths increases with disorder. We attribute this\npuzzling behavior to the low-energy sub-lattice polarization induced by the\nzeroth order pLL, which is unique to pseudomagnetic fields preserving\ntime-reversal symmetry. These results, combined with the experimental\nfeasibility of reversible deformation fields, open the way to tailor a\nmetal-insulator transition driven by pseudomagnetic fields.\n", "  Makespan, which is defined as the time difference between the starting time\nand the terminate time of a sequence of jobs or tasks, as the time to traverse\na belt conveyor system, is well known as one of the most important criteria in\nscheduling problems. It is often used by manufacturing firms in practice in\norder to improve the operational efficiency with respect to the order of job\nprocessing to be performed. It is known that the performance of a machine\ndepends on the particular timing of the job processing even if the job\nprocessing order is fixed. That is, the performance of a system with respect to\nflowshop processing depends on the procedure of scheduling. In this present\nwork, we first discuss the relationship between makespan and several scheduling\nprocedures in detail by using a small example and provide an algorithm for\nderiving the makespan. Using our proposed algorithm, several numerical\nexperiments are examined so as to reveal the relationship between the typical\nbehavior of makespan and the position of the fiducial machine, with respect to\nseveral distinguished distributions of the processing time. We also discuss the\nbehavior of makespan by using the properties of the shape functions used in the\ncontext of percolation theory. Our contributions are firstly giving a detail\ndiscussion on the universality of makespan in flowshop problems and obtaining\nseveral novel properties of makespan, as follows: (1) makespan possesses\nuniversality in the sense of being little affected by a change in the\nprobability distribution of the processing time, (2) makespan can be decomposed\ninto the sum of two shape functions, and (3) makespan is less affected by the\ndispatching rule than by the scheduling procedure.\n", "  We present a new FORM program for analytically evaluating four-loop massless\npropagator-type Feynman integrals in an efficient way. Our program Forcer\nimplements parametric reductions of the aforementioned class of Feynman\nintegrals into a set of master integrals and can be considered as a four-loop\nextension of the three-loop Mincer program. Since the program structure at the\nfour-loop level is highly complicated and the equations easily become lengthy,\nmost of the code was generated in an automatic way or with computer-assisted\nderivations. We have checked correctness of the program by recomputing\nalready-known quantities in the literature.\n", "  The Daya Bay reactor experiment has reported the most precise measurement of\nsin$^{2}2\\theta_{13}$ and $\\Delta m^{2}_{ee}$ by using a data set with the\nfully constructed design of 8 antineutrino detectors (ADs). We also report on a\nnew independent measurement of sin$^{2}2\\theta_{13}$ from neutron capture on\nhydrogen, which confirms the results using gadolinium caputres. Several other\nanalyses are also performed, including a measurements on the absolute reactor\nantineutrino flux and a search for light sterile neutrinos. Prospects for new\nanalyses such as searching for CPT/LI violation at Daya Bay are ongoing.\n", "  The task of predicting future relationships in a social network, known as\nlink prediction, has been studied extensively in the literature. Many link\nprediction methods have been proposed, ranging from common neighbors to\nprobabilistic models. Recent work by Yang et al. has highlighted several\nchallenges in evaluating link prediction accuracy. In dynamic networks where\nedges are both added and removed over time, the link prediction problem is more\ncomplex and involves predicting both newly added and newly removed edges. This\nresults in new challenges in the evaluation of dynamic link prediction methods,\nand the recommendations provided by Yang et al. are no longer applicable,\nbecause they do not address edge removal. In this paper, we investigate several\nmetrics currently used for evaluating accuracies of dynamic link prediction\nmethods and demonstrate why they can be misleading in many cases. We provide\nseveral recommendations on evaluating dynamic link prediction accuracy,\nincluding separation into two categories of evaluation. Finally we propose a\nunified metric to characterize link prediction accuracy effectively using a\nsingle number.\n", "  We study the persistence of localization for a strongly disordered\ntight-binding Anderson model on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, periodically driven\non each site. Under two different sets of conditions, we show that Anderson\nlocalization survives if the driving frequency is higher than some threshold\nvalue that we determine. We discuss the implication of our results for recent\ndevelopment in condensed matter physics, we compare them with the predictions\nissuing from adiabatic theory, and we comment on the connexion with Mott's law,\nderived within the linear response formalism.\n", "  In this paper one deals with the quantization of mesoscopic LC-circuits under\nthe influence of an external time dependent voltage. The canonically conjugated\nvariables, such as given by the electric charge and the magnetic flux, get\nestablished by resorting to the hamiltonian equations of motion provided by\nboth Faraday and Kirchhoff laws . This time the discretization of the electric\ncharge is accounted for, so that magnetic flux operators one looks for should\nproceed in terms of discrete derivatives. However, the flux operators one deals\nwitg are not Hermitian, which means that subsequent symmetrizations are in\norder. The eigenvalues characterizing such operators cab be readily established\nin terms of twisted boundary conditions. Besides the discrete Schrodinger\nequation with nearest-neighbor hoppings, a nontrivial next nearest neighbor\ngeneralization has also been established. Such issues open the way to the\nderivation of persistent currents in terms of effective k-dependent\nHamiltonians. Handling the time dependent voltage within the nearest neighbor\ndescription leadsto the derivation of dynamic localization effects in L-ring\nconfigurations, such as discussed before by Dunlap and Kenkre The onset of the\nmagnetic flux quantum has also been discussed in some more detail.\n", "  The stabilizing effects of enhanced edge resistivity on the low-n edge\nlocalized modes (ELMs) are reported for the first time in the context of ELM\nsuppression in H-mode discharge due to Lithium-conditioning in the National\nSpherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). Here n is the toroidal mode number. Linear\nstability analysis of the corresponding experimental equilibrium suggests that\nthe change in the equilibrium plasma density profile alone due to\nLithium-conditioning may be insufficient for a complete suppression of ELMs.\nThe enhanced resistivity due to the increased effective electric charge number\nZ eff after Lithium-conditioning can account for additional stabi- lization\neffect necessary for full ELM suppression. Remarkably, such a stabilizing\neffect of enhanced edge resistivity on the low-n ELMs only exists when\ntwo-fluid effects are considered in the MHD model.\n", "  The 'Imitation Game' is a Turing Test played with a human participant instead\nof a computer. Here the author, a sociologist, who has been immersed in the\nfield of gravitational wave physics since 1972, tried to pass an Imitation Game\nas a gravitational wave physicist. He already passed such a test in mid-2000s\nbut this test was more elaborate and compared his performance with that of\nother kinds of physicists and with other sociologists as well as gravitational\nwave physicists. The test was based on 8 technical questions about\ngravitational wave physics asked by Professor Sathyprakash of Cardiff\nUniversity. Collins marks compared well with that of the other gravitational\nwave physicists and were markedly better than that of other classes of\nrespondent. Collins also marked the test and it can be seen that the way he\nmarked was also much closer to the gravitational wave physicists than other\ncategories. Though Collins's expertise can be shown to have degraded a little\nin the last ten years it seems not to have degraded a lot. This is important\nfor his most recent book on the detection of gravitational waves from a black\nhole binary, this being Chapter 14 of this book, which is due to by published\nmy MIT Press in February 2017.\n", "  The equations governing the magnetohydrodynamic stagnation point flow toward\na non-conducting, thermally insulated, nonporous, linearly stretching sheet are\ncast in a self similar form. Consistent boundary conditions on the velocity,\nmagnetic field and temperature are invoked. The flow problem involves three\nparameters- the magnetic Prandtl number, the magnetic interaction number, and\nthe ratio of the stretching rate to the strength of the stagnation point flow.\nThe energy equation includes viscous dissipation and Joule heating, and\nintroduces the Prandtl number as a fourth parameter. Numerical solutions are\nobtained and sample results are presented.\n", "  Many have suggested that the transformation standardly referred to as 'time\nreversal' in quantum theory is not deserving of the name. I argue on the\ncontrary that the standard definition is perfectly appropriate, and is indeed\nforced by basic considerations about the nature of time in the quantum\nformalism.\n", "  We study the dynamics of local bond orientation in regular hyperbranched\npolymers modeled by Vicsek fractals. The local dynamics is investigated through\nthe temporal autocorrelation functions of single bonds and the corresponding\nrelaxation forms of the complex dielectric susceptibility. We show that the\ndynamic behavior of single segments depends on their remoteness from the\nperiphery rather than on the size of the whole macromolecule. Remarkably, the\ndynamics of the core segments (which are most remote from the periphery) shows\na scaling behavior that differs from the dynamics obtained after structural\naverage. We analyze the most relevant processes of single segment motion and\nprovide an analytic approximation for the corresponding relaxation times.\nFurthermore, we describe an iterative method to calculate the orientational\ndynamics in the case of very large macromolecular sizes.\n", "  We study an extension of QED involving a light pseudoscalar (an axion-like\nparticle), together with a very massive fermion which has Lorentz-violating\ninteractions with the photon and the pseudoscalar, including a nonminimal\nLorentz-violating coupling. We investigate the low energy effective action for\nthis model, after integration over the fermion field, and show that interesting\nresults are obtained, such as the generation of a correction to the standard\ncoupling between the axion-like particle and the photon, as well as\nLorentz-violating effects in the interaction energy involving electromagnetic\nsources such as pointlike charges, steady line currents and Dirac strings.\n", "  Nickel oxide (NiO) is a binary compound with a lot of applications in the\npresent technology. NiO thin films were deposited by reactive sputtering\nmagnetron under several voltage biases applied in the glass substrates (0, 50,\n100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 V). Films were characterized by profilometry, X-ray\ndiffraction, elemental composition and electrical resistivity at room\ntemperature and at low temperatures. The present work showed that despite the\ninsulating behavior of substrate the residual stress was reduced at high biases\nand the (111) texture was promoted. Electrical resistivity was reduced at high\nbias and at low temperatures thermal activation of p-type conduction was\ndetected.\n", "  We describe the development of an ambient-temperature continuously-rotating\nhalf-wave plate (HWP) for study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\npolarization by the POLARBEAR-2 (PB2) experiment. Rapid polarization modulation\nsuppresses 1/f noise due to unpolarized atmospheric turbulence and improves\nsensitivity to degree-angular-scale CMB fluctuations where the inflationary\ngravitational wave signal is thought to exist. A HWP modulator rotates the\ninput polarization signal and therefore allows a single polarimeter to measure\nboth linear polarization states, eliminating systematic errors associated with\ndifferencing of orthogonal detectors. PB2 projects a 365-mm-diameter focal\nplane of 7,588 dichroic, 95/150 GHz transition-edge-sensor bolometers onto a\n4-degree field of view that scans the sky at $\\sim$ 1 degree per second. We\nfind that a 500-mm-diameter ambient-temperature sapphire achromatic HWP\nrotating at 2 Hz is a suitable polarization modulator for PB2. We present the\ndesign considerations for the PB2 HWP, the construction of the HWP optical\nstack and rotation mechanism, and the performance of the fully-assembled HWP\ninstrument. We conclude with a discussion of HWP polarization modulation for\nfuture Simons Array receivers.\n", "  Use of harmonic guiding potentials is the most common method for implementing\nsteered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, performed to obtain potentials of\nmean force (PMFs) of molecular systems using non-equilibrium work (NEW)\ntheorems. Harmonic guiding potentials are also the natural choice in single\nmolecule force spectroscopy experiments. The stiff spring approximation (SSA)\nof Schulten and coworkers enables to use the work performed along SMD\ntrajectories to obtain the PMF.\n  We discuss and demonstrate how a high spring constant, k, required for the\nvalidity of the SSA can violate another requirement of this theory, i.e., the\nvalidity of Brownian dynamics of the system. Violation of the Brownian\ncondition results in the introduction of kinetic energy contributions to the\nexternal work, performed during SMD simulations. These inertial effects result\nin skewed work distributions, rather than the Gaussian distributions predicted\nby SSA. The inertial effects also result in broader work distributions, which\nworsen the effect of the skewness when calculating work averages. Remarkably,\nour results strongly suggest that the skew and width of work distributions are\nindependent of the average drift velocity and physical asymmetries.\n  The skew and broadening of work distributions result in biased estimation of\nthe PMF. The bias manifests itself in the form of a systematic error that\nincreases with simulation time. We discuss the proper upper limit for k, such\nthat the inertial effects are avoided. This limit, used together with the\nrelation for the lower limit of k, enables to conduct accurate steering while\nsatisfying the Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, we argue and demonstrate that\nusing the peak-value (rather than the statistical mean) of the work\ndistributions vastly reduces the bias in the calculated PMFs and improves the\naccuracy.\n"]}
