We follow Dziobek's\napproach to four body central configurations with a direct implicit method of\nour own in which the fundamental quantities are the quotient of the directed\narea divided by the corresponding mass and a new simple numerical algorithm is\ndeveloped to construct general four body central configurations. This tool is\napplied to obtain new properties of the symmetric and non-symmetric central\nconfigurations. The explicit continuous connection between three body and four\nbody central configurations where one of the four masses approaches zero is\nclarified. Some cases of coorbital 1+3 problems are also considered.\n", "  We evaluate the Schechter-Valle (Black Box) theorem quantitatively by\nconsidering the most general Lorentz invariant Lagrangian consisting of\npoint-like operators for neutrinoless double beta decay. It is well known that\nthe Black Box operators induce Majorana neutrino masses at four-loop level.\nThis warrants the statement that an observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay guarantees the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We calculate these\nradiatively generated masses and find that they are many orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the observed neutrino masses and splittings. Thus, some lepton\nnumber violating New Physics (which may at tree-level not be related to\nneutrino masses) may induce Black Box operators which can explain an observed\nrate of neutrinoless double beta decay. Although these operators guarantee\nfinite Majorana neutrino masses, the smallness of the Black Box contributions\nimplies that other neutrino mass terms (Dirac or Majorana) must exist. If\nneutrino masses have a significant Majorana contribution then this will become\nthe dominant part of the Black Box operator. However, neutrinos might also be\npredominantly Dirac particles, while other lepton number violating New Physics\ndominates neutrinoless double beta decay. Translating an observed rate of\nneutrinoless double beta decay into neutrino masses would then be completely\nmisleading. Although the principal statement of the Schechter-Valle theorem\nremains valid, we conclude that the Black Box diagram itself generates\nradiatively only mass terms which are many orders of magnitude too small to\nexplain neutrino masses. Therefore, other operators must give the leading\ncontributions to neutrino masses, which could be of Dirac or Majorana nature.\n", "  We study the dynamics of domain walls in a double-field model in which the\nU(1) symmetry is broken both spontaneously and explicitly. The global U(1)\nsymmetry of the system is restored when the symmetry breaking parameter\n$\\epsilon$ is set to zero. Two pairs of degenerate kinks exist in the model\nwith are related to each other by a $Z_2$ transformation. We first calculate\nthe single domain wall solutions and then investigate collision processes.\nThese include simple scattering, pair annihilation, pair capture, and other\ninteresting processes. The possibility of the domain wall being punctured by a\nstring is also investigated.\n", "  Unavoided crossings of the energy levels due to a variation of a real\nparameter are studied. It is found that after the quantum system in question\npasses through one of its energy-crossing points {\\it alias} Kato's exceptional\npoints (EP), its physical interpretation may {\\em dramatically} change even\nwhen the crossing energies themselves do not complexify. The anomalous physical\nphase-transition mechanism of the change is revealed, attributed to the\nEP-related mathematics and illustrated via several exactly solvable matrix toy\nmodels.\n", "  The stationary single vortex Marangoni convection in an axially symmetrical\nsessile drop of capillary size is considered. The detailed description of the\nfluid flows is presented for a wide range of contact angles, which takes into\naccount the boundary conditions and the mass balance equation, without\nexplicitly solving the Navier--Stokes equations. The analytical approach\ndeveloped is compared with the results of numerical simulations and\ndemonstrated to describe reasonably well the single-vortex Marangoni flows.\nThis indicates the substantial role of the boundary conditions in the problem.\n", "  We study the quantum lattice gas model in one dimension introduced by\nLesanovsky, who showed that the exact ground state and a couple of excited\nstates can be obtained analytically. The Hamiltonian of the model depends\nsolely on the parameter $z$, the meaning of which is a fugacity in the\ncorresponding classical lattice gas model. For small $z$ ($0<z<1$), we prove\nthat there is an energy gap between the ground state and the excited states by\napplying Knabe's method.\n", "  Angle-resolved upper critical field $H_{c2}$ provides an efficient tool to\nprobe the gap symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We revisit the\nbehavior of in-plane $H_{c2}$ in $d$-wave superconductors by considering both\nthe orbital effect and Pauli paramagnetic effect. After carrying out systematic\nanalysis, we show that the maxima of $H_{c2}$ could be along either nodal or\nantinodal directions of a $d$-wave superconducting gap, depending on the\nspecific values of a number of tuning parameters. This behavior is in contrast\nto the common belief that the maxima of in-plane $H_{c2}$ are along the\ndirection where the superconducting gap takes its maximal value. Therefore,\nidentifying the precise $d$-wave gap symmetry through fitting experiments\nresults of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ with model calculations at a fixed\ntemperature, as widely used in previous studies, is difficult and practically\nunreliable. However, our extensive analysis of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ show\nthat there is a critical temperature $T^{*}$: in-plane $H_{c2}$ exhibits its\nmaxima along nodal directions at $T < T^{*}$ and along antinodal directions at\n$T^{*} < T < T_c$. The concrete value of $T^{*}$ may change as other parameters\nvary, but the existence of $\\pi/4$ shift of $H_{c2}$ at $T^{\\ast}$ appears to\nbe a general feature. Thus a better method to identify the precise $d$-wave gap\nsymmetry is to measure $H_{c2}$ at a number of different temperatures, and\nexamine whether there is a $\\pi/4$ shift in its angular dependence at certain\n$T^{*}$. We further show that Landau level mixing does not change this general\nfeature. However, in the presence of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state,\nthe angular dependence of $H_{c2}$ becomes quite complicated, which makes it\nmore difficult to determine the gap symmetry by measuring $H_{c2}$.\n", "  First observations of electrostatic potential variations within the flux\nsurfaces of a toroidal magnetic confinement device are presented. Measurements\nare taken in the TJ-II stellarator with two distant Langmuir probe arrays. The\nedge floating potentials display differences of several tens of Volts in\nelectron-root wave-heated plasmas. The differences are reduced for higher\ndensities and lower electron temperatures after the ion-root electric field\nforms at the plasma edge. Neoclassical Monte Carlo simulations estimate the\ncorrect order of magnitude for the overall variation in potential and predict\nthe trend observed with the radial electric field. However, for the specific\nlocation of the probes, the simulations give differences smaller than those\nobserved experimentally.\n", "  It is shown that the toy-model-based considerations of {\\em loc. cit.} (see\nalso arXiv:1312.3395) are based on an incorrect, manifestly unphysical choice\nof the Hilbert space of admissible quantum states. A two-parametric family of\nall of the eligible correct and potentially physical Hilbert spaces of the\nmodel is then constructed. The implications of this construction are discussed.\nIn particular, it is emphasized that contrary to the conclusions of {\\em loc.\ncit.} there is no reason to believe that the current form of the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum theory should be false as a fundamental\ntheory.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) has observed a statistically significant excess in\ncosmic-rays with energies above 57 EeV in a region of approximately 1150 square\ndegrees centered on coordinates (R.A. = 146.7, Dec. = 43.2). We note that the\nlocation of this excess correlates with two of the 28 extraterrestrial\nneutrinos recently observed by IceCube. The overlap between the two IceCube\nneutrinos and the TA excess is statistically significant at the 2$\\sigma$\nlevel. Furthermore, the spectrum and intensity of the IceCube neutrinos is\nconsistent with a single source which would also produce the TA excess.\nFinally, we discuss possible source classes with the correct characteristics to\nexplain the cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes with a single source.\n", "  Acceleration sensors built into smartphones, i-pads or tablets can\nconveniently be used in the Physics laboratory. By virtue of the equivalence\nprinciple, a sensor fixed in a non-inertial reference frame cannot discern\nbetween a gravitational field and an accelerated system. Accordingly,\nacceleration values read by these sensors must be corrected for the\ngravitational component. A physical pendulum was studied by way of example, and\nabsolute acceleration and rotation angle values were derived from the\nmeasurements made by the accelerometer and gyroscope. Results were corroborated\nby comparison with those obtained by video analysis. The limitations of\ndifferent smartphone sensors are discussed.\n", "  In this paper a differential equation with noninteger order was used to model\nan anomalous luminescence decay process. Although this process is in principle\nan exponential decaying process, recent data indicates that is not the case for\nlonger observation time. The theoretical fractional differential calculus\napplied in the present work was able to describe this process at short and long\ntime, explaining, in a single equation, both exponential and non-exponential\ndecay process. The exact solution found by fractional model is given by an\ninfinite serie, the Mittag-Leffer function, with two adjusting parameters. To\nfurther illustrate this nonexponential behaviour and the fractional calculus\nframework, an stochastic analysis is also proposed.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of $N$ bosons in three dimensions. We assume the\npair interaction is given by $N^{3\\beta -1}V(N^{\\beta }\\cdot )$ . By studying\nan associated many-body wave operator, we introduce a BBGKY hierarchy which\ntakes into account all of the interparticle singular correlation structures\ndeveloped by the many-body evolution from the beginning. Assuming energy\nconditions on the $N$-body wave function, for $\\beta \\in \\left( 0,1\\right] $,\nwe derive the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy with $2$-body interaction. In\nparticular, we establish that, in the $N\\rightarrow \\infty $ limit, all\n$k$-body scattering processes vanishes if $k\\geqslant 3$ and thus provide a\ndirect answer to a question raised by Erd\\\"{o}s, Schlein, and Yau in [31].\nMoreover, this new BBGKY hierarchy shares the limit points with the ordinary\nBBGKY hierarchy strongly for $\\beta \\in \\left( 0,1\\right) $ and weakly for\n$\\beta =1$. Since this new BBGKY hierarchy converts the problem from a two-body\nestimate to a weaker three body estimate for which we have the estimates to\nachieve $\\beta <1$, it then allows us to prove that all limit points of the\nordinary BBGKY hierarchy satisfy the space-time bound conjectured by Klainerman\nand Machedon in [47] for $\\beta \\in \\left( 0,1\\right) $.\n", "  We present a purely affine gravitational model in four dimensions built up\nentirely on the bases of full diffeomorphism invariance, and power- counting\nrenormalizability. We show that its non-relativistic limit around a homogeneous\nand isotropic spacetime yields to a Newtonian gravity.\n", "  In a recent paper Arita et al. [Phys. Rev. E 90, 052108 (2014)] consider the\ntransport properties of a class of generalized exclusion processes. Analytical\nexpressions for the transport-diffusion coefficient are derived by ignoring\ncorrelations. It is claimed that these expressions become exact in the\nhydrodynamic limit. In this Comment, we point out that (i) the influence of\ncorrelations upon the diffusion does not vanish in the hydrodynamic limit, and\n(ii) the expressions for the self- and transport diffusion derived by Arita et\nal. are special cases of results derived in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 110601\n(2013)].\n", "  Observations of the extragalactic radio background have uncovered a\nsignificant isotropic emission across multiple frequencies spanning from 22 MHz\nto 10 GHz. The intensity of this non-thermal emission component significantly\nexceeds the expected contribution from known astrophysical sources.\nInterestingly, models have indicated that the annihilation of dark matter\nparticles may reproduce both the flux and spectrum of the excess. However, the\nlack of a measurable anisotropy in the residual emission remains challenging\nfor both dark matter and standard astrophysical interpretations of the ARCADE-2\ndata. We calculate the expected synchrotron anisotropy from dark matter\nannihilation and show that these models can produce very small anisotropies,\nthough this requires galaxy clusters to have large substructure contributions\nand strong magnetic fields. We show that this constraint can be significantly\nrelaxed, however, in scenarios where electrons produced via dark matter\nannihilation can be efficiently reaccelerated by Alfv\\'en waves in the\nintra-Cluster medium. Our analysis indicates that any source capable of\nexplaining the intensity and isotropy of the extragalactic radio excess must\nhave a spatial extension far larger than typical for baryons in galaxies,\nsuggesting a novel physics interpretation.\n", "  We generalize the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) method for solving\nthe corresponding Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov-de Gennes (KSBdG) equations for surfaces\nand interfaces. As an application of the newly developed theory we study the\nquasiparticle spectrum of Au overlayers on a Nb(100) host. We find that, within\nthe superconducting gap region, the quasiparticle spectrum consists of Andreev\nbound states (ABS) with a dispersion which is closely connected to the\nunderlying electronic structure of the overlayer. We also find that the\nspectrum has a strongly k-dependent induced gap. The properties of the gap is\ndiscussed in relation to the thickness of the overlayer, and it is shown that\ncertain states do not participate in the Andreev scattering process.\n", "  The aim of this PhD Thesis is to characterize a representative sample of\nSupergiant X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) formed by 4 sources: XTE J1855-026, a\nclassical SGXB with long-term stable X-ray flux; AX J1841.0-0535 and AX\nJ1845.0-0433, two supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) with the X-ray\nemission mostly dominated by flaring; and IGR J00370+6122, something in between\nthese 2 sub-groups. The physical processes that produce these observable\ndifferences are still a matter of debate. In this PhD Thesis I performed a\nstudy of these 4 different systems to provide new data to constrain the models.\nThis study consists of:(i) the determination of the orbital solution,(ii) a\nsystematic study of the wind behavior along the orbit by the measure of Halpha\nvariations,(iii) a model of stellar atmospheres of the donor star,(iv)\nestablish whether there are X-ray flux variations modulated by the orbital\nperiod. The study of the wind shows that Halpha variations are dominated by\nintrinsic wind processes. The stellar atmospheres study shows that the\nsupergiant stars that harbor these binaries have a higher projected rotational\nvelocity, higher He abundance and higher N/C ratio than that of isolated\nsupergiant stars. The results of this study show that the eccentricity of the\nbinary does not have a simple correlation with the differences in the X-ray\nflux of the different sub-groups. Therefore, the idea of a more complex\nscenario is consolidated. The discovery of a new type of system, IGR\nJ00370+6122, which properties do not fit in any of the established sub-groups,\nreinforces the idea of a continuum in the observed properties more than a\nstrict classification of systems. Furthermore, I have developed a pipeline to\nreduce spectra of the FRODOSpec spectrograph at the Liverpool Telescope\noptimized for the reduction of the red spectra of the obscured supergiants that\nwe find in these SGXBs.\n", "  The dynamics of a probe D7-brane in an asymptotically AdS-Vaidya background\nhas been investigated in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nHolographically, this is dual to the dynamical meson melting in the N = 2 super\nYang-Milles theory. If the final temperature of the system is large enough, the\nprobe D7-brane will dynamically cross the horizon (black hole embedding). By\nturning on the external magnetic field and raising it sufficiently, the final\nembedding of the corresponding D7-brane changes to Minkowski embedding. In the\nfield theory side, this means that the mesons which melt due to the raise in\nthe temperature, will form bound states again by applying an external magnetic\nfield. We will also show that the evolution of the system to its final\nequilibrium state is postponed due to the presence of the magnetic field.\n", "  We present a reinterpretation and extension of the reciprocal theorem for\nswimmers, extending its application from the motion of a single swimmer in an\nunbounded domain to the general setting, giving results for both swimmer\ninteractions and general hydrodynamics. We illustrate the method for a squirmer\nnear a planar surface, recovering standard literature results and extending\nthem to a general squirming set, to motion in the presence of a ciliated\nsurface, and expressions for the flow field throughout the domain. Finally, we\npresent exact results for the hydrodynamics in two dimensions which shed light\non the near-field behaviour.\n", "  We explore how a recently developed analytical black-hole binary spacetime\ncan be extended using numerical simulations to go beyond the slow-inspiral\nphase. The analytic spacetime solves the Einstein field equations\napproximately, with the approximation error becoming progressively smaller the\nmore separated the binary. To continue the spacetime beyond the slow-inspiral\nphase, we need to transition. Such a transition was previously explored at\nsmaller separations. Here, we perform this transition at a separation of D=20M\n(large enough that the analytical metric is expected to be accurate), and\nevolve for six orbits. We find that small constraint violations can have large\ndynamical effects, but these can be removed by using a constraint-damping\nsystem like the conformal covariant formulation of the Z4 system. We find\nagreement between the subsequent numerical spacetime and the predictions of\npost-Newtonian theory for the waveform and inspiral rate that is within the\npost-Newtonian truncation error.\n", "  We perform analytical and numerical study of static spherically symmetric\nsolutions in the context of Brans-Dicke-like cosmological model by Elizalde et\nal. with an exponential potential. In this model the phantom regime arises\nwithout the appearance of any ghost degree of freedom due to the specific form\nof coupling. For the certain parameter ranges the model contains a regular\nsolution which we interpret as a wormhole in an otherwise dS Universe. We put\nseveral bounds on the parameter values: $\\omega<0 ,\\,\\,\n\\alpha^2/|\\omega|<10^{-5},22.7\\lesssim\\!\\phi_0\\!\\lesssim25\\,$. The numerical\nsolution could mimic the Schwarzschild one, so the original model is consistent\nwith astrophysical and cosmological observational data. However differences\nbetween our solution and the Schwarzschild one can be quite large, so black\nhole candidate observations could probably place further limits on the $\\phi_0$\nvalue.\n", "  A novel algorithm and implementation of real-time identification and tracking\nof blob-filaments in fusion reactor data is presented. Similar spatio-temporal\nfeatures are important in many other applications, for example, ignition\nkernels in combustion and tumor cells in a medical image. This work presents an\napproach for extracting these features by dividing the overall task into three\nsteps: local identification of feature cells, grouping feature cells into\nextended feature, and tracking movement of feature through overlapping in\nspace. Through our extensive work in parallelization, we demonstrate that this\napproach can effectively make use of a large number of compute nodes to detect\nand track blob-filaments in real time in fusion plasma. On a set of 30GB fusion\nsimulation data, we observed linear speedup on 1024 processes and completed\nblob detection in less than three milliseconds using Edison, a Cray XC30 system\nat NERSC.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of a set of novel discrete symmetry\ntransformations in the case of an interacting N = 2 supersymmetric quantum\nmechanical model of a system of an electron moving on a sphere in the\nbackground of a magnetic monopole and establish its interpretation in the\nlanguage of differential geometry. These discrete symmetries are, over and\nabove, the usual three continuous symmetries of the theory which together\nprovide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of\ndifferential geometry. We derive the nilpotent N = 2 SUSY transformations by\nexploiting our idea of supervariable approach and provide geometrical meaning\nto these transformations in the language of Grassmannian translational\ngenerators on a (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold on which our N = 2 SUSY\nquantum mechanical model is generalized. We express the conserved supercharges\nand the invariance of the Lagrangian in terms of the supervariables (obtained\nafter the imposition of the SUSY invariant restrictions) and provide the\ngeometrical meaning to (i) the nilpotency property of the N = 2 supercharges,\nand (ii) the SUSY invariance of the Lagrangian of our N = 2 SUSY theory.\n", "  Recent advances in spatial and temporal networks have enabled researchers to\nmore-accurately describe many real-world systems such as urban transport\nnetworks. In this paper, we study the response of real-world spatio-temporal\nnetworks to random error and systematic attack, taking a unified view of their\nspatial and temporal performance. We propose a model of spatio-temporal paths\nin time-varying spatially embedded networks which captures the property that,\nas in many real-world systems, interaction between nodes is non-instantaneous\nand governed by the space in which they are embedded. Through numerical\nexperiments on three real-world urban transport systems, we study the effect of\nnode failure on a network's topological, temporal and spatial structure. We\nalso demonstrate the broader applicability of this framework to three other\nclasses of network. To identify weaknesses specific to the behaviour of a\nspatio-temporal system, we introduce centrality measures that evaluate the\nimportance of a node as a structural bridge and its role in supporting\nspatio-temporally efficient flows through the network. This exposes the complex\nnature of fragility in a spatio-temporal system, showing that there is a\nvariety of failure modes when a network is subject to systematic attacks.\n", "  Paired (or co-)teaching is an arrangement in which two faculty are\ncollaboratively responsible for all aspects of teaching a course. By pairing an\ninstructor experienced in research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) with\nan instructor with little or no experience in RBIS, paired teaching can be used\nto promote the adoption of RBIS. Using data from post-course interviews with\nthe novice instructors of four such arrangements, we seek to describe factors\nthat make for effective professional development in teaching via paired\nteaching. We suggest that the novice instructor's approach to the paired\nteaching and their previous teaching experience are two aspects which mediate\ntheir learning about teaching. Additionally, the structure of the pair-taught\ncourse and the sequence of teaching assignments for the novice both likely play\nroles in lowering the barrier to novice instructors adopting RBIS. We discuss\nthese results within the framework of cognitive apprenticeship.\n", "  Drops of active liquid crystal have recently shown the ability to\nself-propel, which was associated with topological defects in the orientation\nof active filaments [Sanchez {\\em et al.}, Nature {\\bf 491}, 431 (2013)]. Here,\nwe study the onset and different aspects of motility of a three-dimensional\ndrop of active fluid on a planar surface. We analyse theoretically how motility\nis affected by orientation profiles with defects of various types and\nlocations, by the shape of the drop, and by surface friction at the substrate.\nIn the scope of a thin drop approximation, we derive exact expressions for the\nflow in the drop that is generated by a given orientation profile. The flow has\na natural decomposition into terms that depend entirely on the geometrical\nproperties of the orientation profile, i.e. its bend and splay, and a term\ncoupling the orientation to the shape of the drop. We find that asymmetric\nsplay or bend generates a directed bulk flow and enables the drop to move, with\nmaximal speeds achieved when the splay or bend is induced by a topological\ndefect in the interior of the drop. In motile drops the direction and speed of\nself-propulsion is controlled by friction at the substrate.\n", "  We compute the spectral statistics of the sum H of two independent complex\nWishart matrices, each of which is correlated with a different covariance\nmatrix. Random matrix theory enjoys many applications including sums and\nproducts of random matrices. Typically ensembles with correlations among the\nmatrix elements are much more difficult to solve. Using a combination of\nsupersymmetry, superbosonisation and bi-orthogonal functions we are able to\ndetermine all spectral k-point density correlation functions of H for arbitrary\nmatrix size N. In the half-degenerate case, when one of the covariance matrices\nis proportional to the identity, the recent results by Kumar for the joint\neigenvalue distribution of H serve as our starting point. In this case the\nensemble has a bi-orthogonal structure and we explicitly determine its kernel,\nproviding its exact solution for finite N. The kernel follows from computing\nthe expectation value of a single characteristic polynomial. In the general\nnon-degenerate case the generating function for the k-point resolvent is\ndetermined from a supersymmetric evaluation of the expectation value of k\nratios of characteristic polynomials. Numerical simulations illustrate our\nfindings for the spectral density at finite N and we also give indications how\nto do the asymptotic large-N analysis.\n", "  We obtain the strong asymptotics of polynomials $p_n(\\lambda)$,\n$\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$, orthogonal with respect to measures in the complex\nplane of the form $$\ne^{-N(|\\lambda|^{2s}-t\\lambda^s-\\overline{t\\lambda}^s)}dA(\\lambda), $$ where\n$s$ is a positive integer, $t$ is a complex parameter and $dA$ stands for the\narea measure in the plane. Such problem has its origin from normal matrix\nmodels. We study the asymptotic behaviour of $p_n(\\lambda)$ in the limit\n$n,N\\to\\infty$ in such a way that $n/N\\to T$ constant. Such asymptotic\nbehaviour has two distinguished regimes according to the topology of the\nlimiting support of the eigenvalue distribution of the normal matrix model. If\n$0<|t|^2<T/s$, the eigenvalue distribution support is a simply connected\ncompact set of the complex plane, while for $|t|^2>T/s$ the eigenvalue\ndistribution support consists of $s$ connected components. Correspondingly the\nsupport of the limiting zero distribution of the orthogonal polynomials\nconsists of a closed contour contained in each connected component. Our\nasymptotic analysis is obtained by reducing the planar orthogonality conditions\nof the polynomials to an equivalent system of contour integral orthogonality\nconditions. The strong asymptotics for the orthogonal polynomials is obtained\nfrom the corresponding Riemann--Hilbert problem by the Deift--Zhou nonlinear\nsteepest descent method.\n", "  Precise characterization of quantum devices is usually achieved with quantum\ntomography. However, most methods which are currently widely used in\nexperiments, such as maximum likelihood estimation, lack a well-justified error\nanalysis. Promising recent methods based on confidence regions are difficult to\napply in practice or yield error bars which are unnecessarily large. Here, we\npropose a practical yet robust method for obtaining error bars. We do so by\nintroducing a novel representation of the output of the tomography procedure,\nthe \"quantum error bars\". This representation is (i) concise, being given in\nterms of few parameters, (ii) intuitive, providing a fair idea of the \"spread\"\nof the error, and (iii) useful, containing the necessary information for\nconstructing confidence regions. The statements resulting from our method are\nformulated in terms of a figure of merit, such as the fidelity to a reference\nstate. We present an algorithm for computing this representation and provide\nready-to-use software. Our procedure is applied to actual experimental data\nobtained from two superconducting qubits in an entangled state, demonstrating\nthe applicability of our method.\n", "  We study the interaction among dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder effects\nin the context of wave transmission through a discrete periodic structure,\nsubjected to continuous harmonic excitation in its stop band. We consider a\ndamped nonlinear periodic structure of finite length with disorder. Disorder is\nintroduced throughout the structure by small changes in the stiffness\nparameters drawn from a uniform statistical distribution. Dispersion effects\nforbid wave transmission within the stop band of the linear periodic structure.\nHowever, nonlinearity leads to supratransmission phenomenon, by which enhanced\nwave transmission occurs within the stop band of the periodic structure when\nforced at an amplitude exceeding a certain threshold. The frequency components\nof the transmitted waves lie within the pass band of the linear structure,\nwhere disorder is known to cause Anderson localization. There is therefore a\ncompetition between dispersion, nonlinearity, and disorder in the context of\nsupratransmission. We show that supratransmission persists in the presence of\ndisorder. The influence of disorder decreases in general as the forcing\nfrequency moves away from the pass band edge, reminiscent of dispersion effects\nsubsuming disorder effects in linear periodic structures. We compute the\ndependence of the supratransmission force threshold on nonlinearity and\nstrength of coupling between units. We observe that nonlinear forces are\nconfined to the driven unit for weakly coupled systems. This observation,\ntogether with the truncation of higher-order nonlinear terms, permits us to\ndevelop closed-form expressions for the supratransmission force threshold. In\nsum, in the frequency range studied here, disorder does not influence the\nsupratransmission force threshold in the ensemble-average sense, but it does\nreduce the average transmitted wave energy.\n", "  We study Fermi gases in two dimensions at low temperatures with attractive\ninteractions. Analytical results are derived for the equation of state and the\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature as functions of the two-body binding\nenergy and the density of the gas. Our results for the equation of state\nstrongly deviate from the mean field predictions. However, they are in\nreasonable agreement with Monte-Carlo calculations and recent experiments with\ncold atomic gases.\n", "  Tunneling-two-level-system (TTLS) model has successfully explained several\nlow-temperature glass universal properties which do not exist in their\ncrystalline counterparts. The coupling constants between longitudinal and\ntransverse phonon strain fields and two-level-systems are denoted as $\\gamma_l$\nand $\\gamma_t$. The ratio $\\gamma_l/\\gamma_t$ was observed to lie between\n$1.44$ and $1.84$ for 18 different kinds of glasses. Such universal property\ncannot be explained within TTLS model. In this paper by developing a\nmicroscopic generic coupled block model, we show that the ratio\n$\\gamma_l/\\gamma_t$ is proportinal to the ratio of sound velocity $c_l/c_t$. We\nprove that the universality of $\\gamma_l/\\gamma_t$ essentially comes from the\nmutual interaction between different glass blocks, independent of the\nmicroscopic structure and chemical compound of the amorphous materials. In the\nappendix we also give a detailed correction on the coefficient of non-elastic\nstress-stress interaction $\\Lambda_{ijkl}^{(ss')}$ which was obtained by\nJoffrin and Levelut\\cite{Joffrin1976}.\n", "  We present an extensive treatment of the generalized mode-coupling theory\n(GMCT) of the glass transition, which seeks to describe the dynamics of\nglass-forming liquids using only static structural information as input. This\ntheory amounts to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for multi-point\ndensity correlations, the lowest-order closure of which is equivalent to\nstandard mode-coupling theory. Here we focus on simplified schematic GMCT\nhierarchies, which lack any explicit wavevector-dependence and therefore allow\nfor greater analytical and numerical tractability. For one particular schematic\nmodel, we derive the unique analytic solution of the infinite hierarchy, and\ndemonstrate that closing the hierarchy at finite order leads to uniform\nconvergence as the closure level increases. We also show numerically that a\nsimilarly robust convergence pattern emerges for more generic schematic GMCT\nmodels, suggesting that the GMCT framework is generally convergent, even though\nno small parameter exists in the theory. Finally, we discuss how different\neffective weights on the high-order contributions ultimately control whether\nthe transition is continuous, discontinuous, or strictly avoided, providing new\nmeans to relate structure to dynamics in glass-forming systems.\n", "  In this paper we present a new unified theory of electromagnetic and\ngravitational interactions. By considering a four-dimensional spacetime as a\nhypersurface embedded in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime, we derive the\ncomplete set of field equations in the four-dimensional spacetime from the\nfive-dimensional Einstein field equation. Besides the Einstein field equation\nin the four-dimensional spacetime, an electromagnetic field equation is\nderived: $\\nabla_a F^{ab}-\\xi R^b_{\\;\\,a}A^a=-4\\pi J^b$ with $\\xi=-2$, where\n$F^{ab}$ is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor defined by the\npotential vector $A^a$, $R_{ab}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the\nhypersurface, and $J^a$ is the electric current density vector. The\nelectromagnetic field equation differs from the Einstein-Maxwell equation by a\ncurvature-coupled term $\\xi R^b_{\\;\\,a}A^a$, whose presence addresses the\nproblem of incompatibility of the Einstein-Maxwell equation with a universe\ncontaining a uniformly distributed net charge as discussed in a previous paper\nby the author [L.-X. Li, Gen. Relativ. Gravit. {\\bf 48}, 28 (2016)]. Hence, the\nnew unified theory is physically different from the Kaluza-Klein theory and its\nvariants where the Einstein-Maxwell equation is derived. In the\nfour-dimensional Einstein field equation derived in the new theory, the source\nterm includes the stress-energy tensor of electromagnetic fields as well as the\nstress-energy tensor of other unidentified matter. Under some conditions the\nunidentified matter can be interpreted as a cosmological constant in the\nfour-dimensional spacetime. We argue that, the electromagnetic field equation\nand hence the unified theory presented in this paper can be tested in an\nenvironment with a high mass density, e.g., inside a neutron star or a white\ndwarf, and in the early epoch of the universe.\n", "  The external field control of antiferromagnetism is a significant subject\nboth for basic science and technological applications. As a useful macroscopic\nresponse to detect magnetic states, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is known\nfor ferromagnets, but it has never been observed in antiferromagnets until the\nrecent discovery in Mn3Sn. Here we report another example of the AHE in a\nrelated antiferromagnet, namely, in the hexagonal chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Ge.\nOur single-crystal study reveals that Mn3Ge exhibits a giant anomalous Hall\nconductivity $|\\sigma_{xz}|$ ~ 60 per ohm per cm at room temperature and\napproximately 380 per ohm per cm at 5 K in zero field, reaching nearly half of\nthe value expected for the quantum Hall effect per atomic layer with Chern\nnumber of unity. Our detailed analyses on the anisotropic Hall conductivity\nindicate that in comparison with the in-plane-field components $|\\sigma_{xz}|$\nand $|\\sigma_{zy}|$, which are very large and nearly comparable in size, we\nfind $|\\sigma_{yx}|$ obtained in the field along the c axis is found to be much\nsmaller. The anomalous Hall effect shows a sign reversal with the rotation of a\nsmall magnetic field less than 0.1 T. The soft response of the AHE to magnetic\nfield should be useful for applications, for example, to develop switching and\nmemory devices based on antiferromagnets.\n", "  A background-independent quantization of the Universe near its Big Bang\nsingularity is considered using a drastically simplified toy model. Several\nconceptual issues are addressed.\n  (1) The observable spatial-geometry characteristics of our empty-space\nexpanding Universe is sampled by the time-dependent operator $Q=Q(t)$ of the\ndistance between two space-attached observers (``Alice and Bob'').\n  (2) For any pre-selected guess of the simple, non-covariant time-dependent\nobservable $Q(t)$ one of the Kato's exceptional points (viz., $t=\\tau_{(EP)}$)\nis postulated {\\em real-valued}. This enables us to treat it as the time of Big\nBang.\n  (3) During our ``Eon'' (i.e., at all $t>\\tau_{(EP)}$) the observability\nstatus of operator $Q(t)$ is mathematically guaranteed by its self-adjoint\nnature with respect to an {\\em ad hoc} Hilbert-space metric $\\Theta(t) \\neq I$.\n  (4) In adiabatic approximation (i.e., in Heisenberg picture) the passage of\nthe Universe through its $t=\\tau_{(EP)}$ singularity is interpreted as a\nquantum phase transition between the preceding and the present Eon.\n  It is worth adding that in our model the widely accepted ``Big Bounce''\nregularization of the classical Big Bang singularity after quantization gets\nreplaced by the full-fledged quantum degeneracy. At the\nquantum-phase-transition singularity, operator $Q(\\tau_{(EP)})$ becomes\nunobservable and acquires a non-diagonalizable Jordan-block structure.\n", "  If dark matter inhabits an expanded \"hidden sector\", annihilations may\nproceed through sequential decays or multi-body final states. We map out the\npotential signals and current constraints on such a framework in indirect\nsearches, using a model-independent setup based on multi-step hierarchical\ncascade decays. While remaining agnostic to the details of the hidden sector\nmodel, our framework captures the generic broadening of the spectrum of\nsecondary particles (photons, neutrinos, e+e- and antiprotons) relative to the\ncase of direct annihilation to Standard Model particles. We explore how\nindirect constraints on dark matter annihilation limit the parameter space for\nsuch cascade/multi-particle decays. We investigate limits from the cosmic\nmicrowave background by Planck, the Fermi measurement of photons from the dwarf\ngalaxies, and positron data from AMS-02. The presence of a hidden sector can\nchange the constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section by up to\nan order of magnitude in either direction (although the effect can be much\nsmaller). We find that generally the bound from the Fermi dwarfs is most\nconstraining for annihilations to photon-rich final states, while AMS-02 is\nmost constraining for electron and muon final states; however in certain\ninstances the CMB bounds overtake both, due to their approximate independence\nof the details of the hidden sector cascade. We provide the full set of cascade\nspectra considered here as publicly available code with examples at\nhttp://web.mit.edu/lns/research/CascadeSpectra.html.\n", "  We study the creation of knotted ultracold matter waves in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates via coherent two-photon Raman transitions with a $\\Lambda$ level\nconfiguration. The Raman transition allows an indirect transfer of atoms from\nthe internal state $\\left| a \\right\\rangle$ to the target state $\\left| b\n\\right\\rangle$ via an excited state $\\left| e \\right\\rangle$, that would be\notherwise dipole-forbidden. This setup enables us to imprint three-dimensional\nknotted vortex lines embedded in the the probe field to the density in the\ntarget state. We elaborate on experimental feasibility as well as on subsequent\ndynamics of the matter wave.\n", "  We study the weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons, within\nthe covariant spectator quark model, focusing on the dependence of\nfour-momentum transfer squared, Q^2. In our model the axial form factors\nG_A(Q^2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^2) (induced pseudoscalar form\nfactor), are calculated based on the constituent quark axial form factors and\nthe octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the\ntwo constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2),\nand the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^2). The baryon wave functions\nare composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative\nangular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We\nassume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2) has the same function\nform as that of the quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining\nparameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^2-dependence of\ng_P^q(Q^2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon axial form factor data\nobtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses. In this lattice QCD\nregime the meson cloud effects are small, and the physics associated with the\nvalence quarks can be better calibrated. Once the valence quark model is\ncalibrated, we extend the model to the physical regime, and use the low Q^2\nexperimental data to estimate the meson cloud contributions for G_A(Q^2) and\nG_P(Q^2). Using the calibrated quark axial form factors, and the generalization\nof the nucleon wave function for the other octet baryon members, we make\npredictions for all the possible weak interaction axial form factors G_A(Q^2)\nand G_P(Q^2) of the octet baryons. The results are compared with the\ncorresponding experimental data for G_A(0), and with the estimates of\nbaryon-meson models based on SU(6) symmetry.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of solar activity using a nonlinear\none-dimensional dynamo model and a phenomenological equation for the evolution\nof Wolf numbers. This system of equations is solved numerically. We take into\naccount the algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities of the alpha effect. The\ndynamic nonlinearity is related to the evolution of a small-scale magnetic\nhelicity, and it leads to a complicated behavior of solar activity. The\nevolution equation for the Wolf number is based on a mechanism of formation of\nmagnetic spots as a result of the negative effective magnetic pressure\ninstability (NEMPI). This phenomenon was predicted 25 years ago and has been\ninvestigated intensively in recent years through direct numerical simulations\nand mean-field simulations. The evolution equation for the Wolf number includes\nthe production and decay of sunspots. Comparison between the results of\nnumerical simulations and observational data of Wolf numbers shows a 70 %\ncorrelation over all intervals of observation (about 270 years). We determine\nthe dependence of the maximum value of the Wolf number versus the period of the\ncycle and the asymmetry of the solar cycles versus the amplitude of the cycle.\nThese dependencies are in good agreement with observations.\n", "  An accurate line list for calcium oxide is presented covering transitions\nbetween all bound ro-vibronic levels from the five lowest electronic states \\X,\n\\Ap, \\A, \\astate, and \\bstate. The ro-vibronic energies and corresponding\nwavefunctionts were obtained by solving the fully coupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. \\textit{Ab initio} potential energy, spin-orbit, and electronic\nangular momentum curves were refined by fitting to the experimental frequencies\nand experimentally derived energies available in the literature. Using our\nrefined model we could (i) reassign the vibronic states for a large portion of\nthe experimentally derived energies [van Groenendael A., Tudorie M., Focsa C.,\nPinchemel B., Bernath P. F., 2005, J. Mol. Spectrosc., 234, 255], (ii) extended\nthis list of energies to $J=79-118$ and (iii) suggest a new description of the\nresonances from the \\A--\\X\\ system. We used high level \\textit{ab initio}\nelectric dipole moments reported previously [Khalil H., Brites V., Le Quere F.,\nLeonard C., 2011, Chem. Phys., 386, 50] to compute the Einstein A coefficients.\nOur work is the first fully coupled description of this system. Our line list\nis the most complete catalogue of spectroscopic transitions available for\n$^{40}$Ca$^{16}$O and is applicable for temperatures up to at least 5000~K. CaO\nhas yet to be observed astronomically but its transitions are characterised by\nbeing particularly strong which should facilitate its detection. The CaO line\nlist is made available in an electronic form as supplementary data to this\narticle and at \\url{www.exomol.com}.\n", "  Recent hydrodynamical simulations of supernova (SN) evolution have\nhighlighted the importance of a thorough control over microscopic physics\nresponsible for such internal processes as neutrino heating. In particular, it\nhas been suggested that modifications to the neutrino-nucleon elastic cross\nsection can potentially play a crucial role in producing successful supernova\nexplosions. One possible source of such corrections can be found in a nonzero\nvalue for the nucleon's strange helicity content $\\Delta s$. In the present\nanalysis, however, we show that theoretical and experimental progress over the\npast decade has suggested a comparatively small magnitude for $\\Delta s$, such\nthat its sole effect is not sufficient to provide the physics leading to\nsupernova explosions.\n", "  We consider thermal transport in low-dimensional disordered harmonic networks\nof coupled masses. Utilizing known results regarding Anderson localization, we\nderive the actual dependence of the thermal conductance $G$ on the length $L$\nof the sample. This is required by nanotechnology implementations because for\nsuch networks Fourier's law $G \\propto 1/L^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=1$ is\nviolated. In particular we consider \"glassy\" disorder in the coupling\nconstants, and find an anomaly which is related by duality to the Lifshitz-tail\nregime in the standard Anderson model.\n", "  A Frobenius manifold is a manifold with a flat metric and a Frobenius algebra\nstructure on tangent spaces at points of the manifold such that the structure\nconstants of multiplication are given by third derivatives of a potential\nfunction on the manifold with respect to flat coordinates.\n  In this paper we present a modification of that notion coming from the theory\nof arrangements of hyperplanes. Namely, given natural numbers $n>k$, we have a\nflat $n$-dimensional manifold and a vector space $V$ with a nondegenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form and an algebra structure on $V$, depending on points of\nthe manifold, such that the structure constants of multiplication are given by\n$2k+1$-st derivatives of a potential function on the manifold with respect to\nflat coordinates. We call such a structure a {\\it Frobenius like structure}.\nSuch a structure arises when one has a family of arrangements of $n$ affine\nhyperplanes in $\\C^k$ depending on parameters so that the hyperplanes move\nparallely to themselves when the parameters change. In that case a Frobenius\nlike structure arises on the base $\\C^n$ of the family.\n", "  Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states\nare used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical\ndisplacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the\nphoton counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been\npredicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should\nproduce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the\nmechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far\nbeen hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal\nmechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the\ndelicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum\nenhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical\nsystem, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily\naccompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying\nboth the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental\ntrade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance\nwith the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement\nis further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the\nmechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be\nexploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the\namplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal\nnoise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a\nmechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne\nefficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical\nmotion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical\nlight enhances the measurement of the motion.\n", "  Topological Stone-Wales defect in carbon nanotubes plays a central role in\nplastic deformation, chemical functionalization, and superstructure formation.\nHere, we systematically investigate the formation kinetics of such defects\nwithin density functional approach coupled with the transition state theory. We\nfind that both the formation and activation energies depend critically on the\nnanotube chairality, diameter, and defect orientation. The microscopic origin\nof the observed dependence is explained with curvature induced rehybridization\nin nanotube. Surprisingly, the kinetic barrier follows an empirical\nBr{\\o}nsted-Evans-Polanyi type correlation with the corresponding formation\nenergy, and can be understood in terms of overlap between energy-coordinate\nparabolas representing the structures with and without the defect. Further, we\npropose a possible route to substantially decrease the kinetic activation\nbarrier. Such accelerated rates of defect formation are desirable in many novel\nelectronic, mechanical and chemical applications, and also facilitate the\nformation of three-dimensional nanotube superstructures.\n", "  We propose a new mechanism to generate minuscule active neutrino masses in a\nfive-dimensional~(5d) spacetime of an interval without introducing $SU(2)_L$\nsinglet neutrinos. Under asymmetric boundary conditions on the two end points,\na bulk mass for a 5d fermion allows a Dirac particle with a tiny mass\neigenvalue. Implementing this mechanism, which provides us a new tool for\nbuilding neutrino mass models, to the standard model gauge structure is\npossible when all the gauge bosons and the Higgs boson are localized on one of\nthe branes.\n", "  Duo is a general, user-friendly program for computing rotational,\nrovibrational and rovibronic spectra of diatomic molecules. Duo solves the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple\ncase of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of\nclosed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number\nand type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell\ndiatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spin-orbit, angular\nmomenta, spin-rotational and spin-spin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic\neffects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using\nso-called Born-Oppenheimer breakdown curves.\n  Duo requires user-specified potential energy curves and, if relevant, dipole\nmoment, coupling and correction curves. From these it computes energy levels,\nline positions and line intensities. Several analytic forms plus interpolation\nand extrapolation options are available for representation of the curves. Duo\ncan refine potential energy and coupling curves to best reproduce reference\ndata such as experimental energy levels or line positions. Duo is provided as a\nFortran 2003 program and has been tested under a variety of operating systems.\n", "  In this paper, we obtain exact cosmological vacuum solutions for an extended\nFLRW homogenous and isotropic Brans-Dicke (BD) universe in five dimensions for\nall values of the curvature index. Then, by employing the equations associated\nto a modified Brans-Dicke theory (MBDT) [1], we construct the physics on a\nfour-dimensional hypersurface. We show that the induced matter obeys the\nequation of state of a fluid of a barotropic type. We discuss the properties of\nsuch an induced matter for some values of the equation of state parameter and\nanalyze in detail their corresponding solutions. To illustrate the cosmological\nbehaviors of the solutions, we contrast our solutions with those present the\nstandard Brans-Dicke theory. We retrieve that, in MBDT scenario, it is\nimpossible to find a physically acceptable solution associated to the negative\ncurvature for both the dust-dominated and radiation-dominated universes.\nHowever, for a spatially flat and closed universes, we argue that our obtained\nsolutions are more general than those associated to the standard BD theory and,\nmoreover, they contain a few classes of solutions which have no analog in the\nBD cosmology. For those particular cases, we further compare the results with\nthose extracted in the context of the induced matter theory (IMT) and general\nrelativity (GR). Furthermore, we discuss in detail the time behaviors of the\ncosmological quantities and compare them with recent observational data. We\nfind a favorable range for the deceleration parameter associated to a\nmatter-dominated spatially flat universe (for the late times) which is\ncompatible with recent corresponding observational results.\n", "  Calculating molecular energies is likely to be one of the first useful\napplications to achieve quantum supremacy, performing faster on a quantum than\na classical computer. However, if future quantum devices are to produce\naccurate calculations, errors due to environmental noise and algorithmic\napproximations need to be characterized and reduced. In this study, we use the\nhigh performance qHiPSTER software to investigate the effects of environmental\nnoise on the preparation of quantum chemistry states. We simulated eighteen\n16-qubit quantum circuits under environmental noise, each corresponding to a\nunitary coupled cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular\nconfiguration. Additionally, we analyze the nature of simple gate errors in\nnoise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find that the Jordan-Wigner (JW)\nencoding produces consistently smaller errors under a noisy environment as\ncompared to the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding,\npure-dephasing noise is shown to produce substantially smaller errors than pure\nrelaxation noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends in both\nmolecular energy and electron particle number within a unitary coupled cluster\nstate preparation scheme, against changes in nuclear charge, bond length,\nnumber of electrons, noise types, and noise magnitude. These trends may prove\nto be useful in making algorithmic and hardware-related choices for quantum\nsimulation of molecular energies.\n", "  High-temperature superconductivity emerges in the CuO$_2$ plane upon doping a\nMott insulator. To ascertain the influence of Mott physics plus short-range\ncorrelations, we solve a three-band copper-oxide model in the charge-transfer\nregime using cellular dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum\nMonte Carlo as an impurity solver. We report the normal and superconducting\nphase diagram of this model as a function of doping, interaction strength and\ntemperature. Upon hole doping of the charge-transfer insulator, the phase\nboundary between pseudogap and correlated metal consists of a first-order\ntransition line at finite doping ending at a critical point, as in the one-band\nmodel. Beyond the endpoint, the phase boundary continues as a Widom crossover\nline, across which thermodynamic quantities peak. This phase boundary\ndetermines changes in the pairing mechanism and is an emergent phenomenon\ncharacteristic of doped Mott insulators, independent of many microscopic\ndetails. Broader implications are discussed.\n", "  The grand canonical formalism is employed to study the thermodynamic\nstructure of a model displaying a quantum phase transition when studied with\nrespect to the canonical formalism. A numerical survey shows that the grand\npartition function diverges following a power law when the interaction\nparameter approaches a limiting constant. The power-law exponent takes a\ndistinctive value when such limiting constant coincides with the critical point\nof the subjacent quantum phase transition. An approximated expression for the\ngrand partition function is derived analytically implementing a mean field\nscheme and a number of thermodynamic observables are obtained. The system\nobservables show signatures that can be used to track the critical point of the\nunderlying transition. This result provides a simple fact that can be exploited\nto verify the existence of a quantum phase transition avoiding the zero\ntemperature regime.\n", "  Sextic polynomial oscillator is probably the best known quantum system which\nis partially exactly {\\it alias} quasi-exactly solvable (QES), i.e., which\npossesses closed-form, elementary-function bound states $\\psi(x)$ at certain\ncouplings and energies. In contrast, the apparently simpler and\nphenomenologically more important quartic polynomial oscillator is {\\em not\\,}\nQES. A resolution of the paradox is proposed: The one-dimensional\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is shown QES after the analyticity-violating\nsymmetrization $V(x)=A|x|+B x^2+C|x|^3+x^4$ of the quartic polynomial\npotential.\n", "  The notion of the electron Fermi surface is one of the characteristic\nconcepts in the field of condensed matter physics, and it plays a crucial role\nin the understanding of the physical properties of doped Mott insulators. Based\non the t-J model, we study the nature of the electron Fermi surface in the\ncobaltates, and qualitatively reproduce the essential feature of the evolution\nof the electron Fermi surface with doping. It is shown that the underlying\nhexagonal electron Fermi surface obeys Luttinger's theorem. The theory also\npredicts a Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime, where the region of\nthe hexagonal electron Fermi surface along the \\Gamma-K direction is suppressed\nby the electron self-energy, and then six disconnected Fermi arcs located at\nthe region of the hexagonal electron Fermi surface along the \\Gamma-M direction\nemerge. However, this Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime weakens with\nthe increase of doping.\n", "  This paper presents studies of the performance of several jet-substructure\ntechniques, which are used to identify hadronically decaying top quarks with\nhigh transverse momentum contained in large-radius jets. The efficiency of\nidentifying top quarks is measured using a sample of top-quark pairs and the\nrate of wrongly identifying jets from other quarks or gluons as top quarks is\nmeasured using multijet events collected with the ATLAS experiment in 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.\nPredictions from Monte Carlo simulations are found to provide an accurate\ndescription of the performance. The techniques are compared in terms of signal\nefficiency and background rejection using simulations, covering a larger range\nin jet transverse momenta than accessible in the dataset. Additionally, a novel\ntechnique is developed that is optimized to reconstruct top quarks in events\nwith many jets.\n", "  Sulphur dioxide is well-known in the atmospheres of planets and satellites,\nwhere its presence is often associated with volcanism, and in circumstellar\nenvelopes of young and evolved stars as well as the interstellar medium. This\nwork presents a line list of 1.3 billion $^{32}$S$^{16}$O$_2$\nvibration-rotation transitions computed using an empirically-adjusted potential\nenergy surface and an ab initio dipole moment surface. The list gives complete\ncoverage up to 8000 cm$^{-1}$ (wavelengths longer than 1.25 $\\mu$m) for\ntemperatures below 2000 K. Infrared absorption cross sections are recorded at\n300 and 500 C are used to validated the resulting ExoAmes line list. The line\nlist is made available in electronic form as supplementary data to this article\nand at www.exomol.com.\n", "  Inspired by the string axiverse idea, it has been suggested that the recent\ntransition from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion is driven by an\naxion-like quintessence field with a sub-Planckian decay constant. The scenario\nrequires that the axion field be rather near the maximum of its potential, but\nis less finely tuned than other explanations of cosmic acceleration. The model\nis parametrized by an axion decay constant $f$, the axion mass $m$, and an\ninitial misalignment angle $|\\theta_i|$ which is close to $\\pi$. In order to\ndetermine the $m$ and $\\theta_{i}$ values consistent with observations, these\nparameters are mapped onto observables: the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at and\nangular diameter distance $d_{A}(z)$ to redshift $z= 0.57$, as well as the\nangular sound horizon of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Measurements of\nthe baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at $z\\simeq 0.57$ by the BOSS\nsurvey and Planck measurements of CMB temperature anisotropies are then used to\nprobe the $\\left\\{m,f,\\theta_i\\right\\}$ parameter space. With current data, CMB\nconstraints are the most powerful, allowing a fraction of only $\\sim 0.2$ of\nthe parameter-space volume. Measurements of the BAO scale made using the\nSPHEREx or SKA experiments could go further, observationally distinguishing all\nbut $\\sim 10^{-2}$ or $\\sim 10^{-5}$ of the parameter-space volume (allowed by\nsimple priors) from the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  We discuss the microscopic mechanisms by which low-temperature amorphous\nstates, such as ultrastable glasses, transform into equilibrium fluids, after a\nsudden temperature increase. Experiments suggest that this process is similar\nto the melting of crystals, thus differing from the behaviour found in ordinary\nglasses. We rationalize these observations using the physical idea that the\ntransformation process takes place very close to a `hidden' equilibrium\nfirst-order phase transition, which is observed in systems of coupled replicas.\nWe illustrate our views using simulation results for a simple two-dimensional\nplaquette spin model, which is known to exhibit a range of glassy behaviour.\nOur results suggest that nucleation-and-growth dynamics, as found near ordinary\nfirst-order transitions, is also the correct theoretical framework to analyse\nthe melting of ultrastable glasses. Our approach provides a unified\nunderstanding of multiple experimental observations, such as propagating\nmelting fronts, large kinetic stability ratios, and `giant' dynamic\nlengthscales.\n", "  We propose the concept of a quantized single-electron source based on the\ninterplay between Coulomb blockade and magnetic flux-controllable\nsuperconducting proximity effect. We show that flux dependence of the induced\nenergy gap in the density of states of a nanosized metallic wire can be\nexploited as an efficient tunable energy barrier which enables charge pumping\nconfigurations with enhanced functionalities. This control parameter strongly\naffects the charging landscape of a normal metal island with non-negligible\nCoulombic energy. Under a suitable evolution of a time-dependent magnetic flux\nthe structure behaves likewise a turnstile for single electrons in a fully\nelectrostatic regime.\n", "  We consider a massive vector field with derivative interactions that\npropagates only the 3 desired polarizations (besides two tensor polarizations\nfrom gravity) with second-order equations of motion in curved space-time. The\ncosmological implications of such generalized Proca theories are investigated\nfor both the background and the linear perturbation by taking into account the\nLagrangian up to quintic order. In the presence of a matter fluid with a\ntemporal component of the vector field, we derive the background equations of\nmotion and show the existence of de Sitter solutions relevant to the late-time\ncosmic acceleration. We also obtain conditions for the absence of ghosts and\nLaplacian instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations in the\nsmall-scale limit. Our results are applied to concrete examples of the general\nfunctions in the theory, which encompass vector Galileons as a specific case.\nIn such examples, we show that the de Sitter fixed point is always a stable\nattractor and study viable parameter spaces in which the no-ghost and stability\nconditions are satisfied during the cosmic expansion history.\n", "  We give a complete description of the anti-involutions that preserve the\nprincipal gradation of the algebra of matrix quantum pseudodifferential\noperators and we describe the Lie subalgebras of its minus fixed points.\n", "  We consider the observable effects of CP-violating anomalous $ZZh$\ninteraction arising from gauge invariant dimension-6 operators at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC), with the purpose of distinguishing them from not only\nthe standard model effects but also those of CP-even anomalous interactions of\nsimilar nature. The postulation of a gauge invariant origin makes various\ncouplings of this kind interrelated. The updated constraints from the LHC as\nwell as limits from neutron and electron dipole moments are used in selecting\nthe benchmark interaction strengths. We use some asymmetry parameters that have\nno contribution from standard or CP-even anomalous interactions. Parton\nshowering and detector level simulation is included to make our analysis as\nrealistic as possible. On the whole, we conclude that gauge invariant\ninteraction of strength $\\geq 40/\\rm TeV^{2} $ can be successfully isolated\nusing integrated luminosities in the 1.5-3.0 $\\rm ab^{-1}$ range.\n", "  In this contribution we study the Klein-Gordon oscillator on the curved\nbackground within the Kaluza-Klein theory. The problem of interaction between\nparticles coupled harmonically with a topological defects in Kaluza-Klein\ntheory is studied. We consider a series of topological defects, that treat the\nKlein-Gordon oscillator coupled to this background and find the energy levels\nand corresponding eigenfunctions in these cases. We show that the energy levels\ndepend on the global parameters characterizing these spacetimes. We also\ninvestigate a quantum particle described by the Klein-Gordon oscillator\ninteracting with a cosmic dislocation in Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime in the\npresence of homogeneous magnetic field in a Kaluza-Klein theory. In this case,\nthe spectrum of energy is determined, and we observe that these energy levels\nare the sum of the term related with Aharonov-Bohm flux and of the parameter\nassociated to the rotation of the spacetime.\n", "  The relaxation process of a diffusive ring becomes under-damped if the bias\n(so called affinity) exceeds a critical threshold value, aka delocalization\ntransition. This is related to the spectral properties of the pertinent\nstochastic kernel. We find the dependence of the relaxation rate on the\naffinity and on the length of the ring. Additionally we study the implications\nof introducing a weak-link into the circuit, and illuminate some subtleties\nthat arise while taking the continuum limit of the discrete model.\n", "  Current {\\gamma}-ray telescopes based on photon conversions to\nelectron-positron pairs, such as Fermi, use tungsten converters. They suffer of\nlimited angular resolution at low energies, and their sensitivity drops below 1\nGeV. The low multiple scattering in a gaseous detector gives access to higher\nangular resolution in the MeV-GeV range, and to the linear polarisation of the\nphotons through the azimuthal angle of the electron-positron pair.\n  HARPO is an R&D program to characterise the operation of a TPC (Time\nProjection Chamber) as a high angular-resolution and sensitivity telescope and\npolarimeter for {\\gamma} rays from cosmic sources. It represents a first step\ntowards a future space instrument. A 30 cm cubic TPC demonstrator was built,\nand filled with 2 bar argon-based gas. It was put in a polarised {\\gamma}-ray\nbeam at the NewSUBARU accelerator in Japan in November 2014. Data were taken at\ndifferent photon energies from 1.7 MeV to 74 MeV, and with different\npolarisation configurations. The electronics setup is described, with an\nemphasis on the trigger system. The event reconstruction algorithm is quickly\ndescribed, and preliminary measurements of the polarisation of 11 MeVphotons\nare shown.\n", "  Anyons have garnered substantial interest theoretically as well as\nexperimentally. Due to the intricate nature of their interactions, however,\neven basic notions such as the equation of state for any kind of anyon gas have\neluded a profound understanding so far. Using holography as a guiding\nprinciple, we propose a general method for an alternative quantization of\nelectromagnetic degrees of freedom in the gravitational dual to obtain an\neffective physical description of strongly correlated anyonic systems. We then\ndemonstrate the application of this prescription in a toy model of an anyonic\nfluid at finite charge density and magnetic field, dual to a dyonic black brane\nin AdS_4, and compute the equation of state and various transport coefficients\nexplicitly.\n", "  We review the recent progress in the understanding of the relaxation of\nisolated near-integrable quantum many-body systems. Focusing on\nprethermalization and universal dynamics following a quench, we describe the\nexperiments with ultracold atomic gases that illustrate these phenomena and\nsummarize the essential theoretical concepts employed to interpret them. Our\ndiscussion highlights the key topics that link the different approaches to this\ninterdisciplinary field, including the generalized Gibbs ensemble, non-thermal\nfixed points, critical slowing and universal scaling. Finally, we point to new\nexperimental challenges demonstrating these fundamental features of many-body\nquantum systems out of equilibrium.\n", "  We discuss single inclusive hadron production from a high energy quark\nscattering off a strong target color field in the Color Glass Condensate\nformalism. Recent calculations of this process at the next-to-leading order\naccuracy have led to negative cross sections at large transverse momenta. We\nidentify the origin of this problem as an oversubtraction of the rapidity\ndivergence into the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation for the target. We\npropose a new way to implement the kinematical restriction on the emitted\ngluons to overcome this difficulty.\n", "  The differential decay rates of the processes $J/\\psi\\to p\\bar{p}\\pi^{0}$ and\n$J/\\psi\\to p\\bar{p}\\eta$ close to the $p\\bar{p}$ threshold are calculated with\nthe help of the $N\\bar{N}$ optical potential. The same calculations are made\nfor the decays of $\\psi(2S)$. We use the potential which has been suggested to\nfit the cross sections of $N\\bar{N}$ scattering together with $N\\bar{N}$ and\nsix pion production in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation close to the $p\\bar{p}$\nthreshold. The $p\\bar{p}$ invariant mass spectra is in agreement with the\navailable experimental data. The anisotropy of the angular distributions, which\nappears due to the tensor forces in the $N\\bar{N}$ interaction, is predicted\nclose to the $p\\bar{p}$ threshold. This anisotropy is large enough to be\ninvestigated experimentally. Such measurements would allow one to check the\naccuracy of the model of $N\\bar{N}$ interaction.\n", "  Stationary states of random walks with finite induced drift velocity on\none-dimensional lattices with aperiodic disorder are investigated by scaling\nanalysis. Three aperiodic sequences, the Thue-Morse (TM), the paperfolding\n(PF), and the Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences, are used to construct the aperiodic\ndisorder. These are binary sequences, composed of two symbols A and B, and the\nratio of the number of As to that of Bs converges to unity in the infinite\nsequence length limit, but their effects on diffusional behavior are different.\nFor the TM model, the stationary distribution is extended, as in the case\nwithout current, and the drift velocity is independent of the system size. For\nthe PF model and the RS model, as the system size increases, the hierarchical\nand fractal structure and the localized structure, respectively, are broken by\na finite current and changed to an extended distribution if the system size\nbecomes larger than a certain threshold value. Correspondingly, the drift\nvelocity is saturated in a large system while in a small system it decreases as\nthe system size increases.\n", "  We study a single-mode cavity weakly coupled to a voltage-biased quantum\npoint contact. In a perturbative analysis, the lowest order predicts a thermal\nstate for the cavity photons, driven by the emission noise of the conductor.\nThe cavity is thus emptied as all transmission probabilities of the quantum\npoint contact approach one or zero. Two-photon processes are identified at\nhigher coupling, and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias\nvoltages. As a result, the number of cavity photons, the cavity damping rate\nand the second order coherence $g^{(2)}$ are all reduced and exhibit less\nbunching than the thermal state. These results are obtained with a Keldysh path\nintegral formulation and reproduced with rate equations. They can be seen as a\nbackaction of the cavity measuring the electronic noise. Extending the standard\n$P(E)$ theory to a steady-state situation, we compute the modified noise\nproperties of the conductor and find quantitative agreement with the\nperturbative calculation.\n", "  We review in a tutorial fashion some of the causes of impurity density\nvariations along field lines and radial impurity transport in the moment\napproach framework. An explicit and compact form of the parallel inertia force\nvalid for arbitrary toroidal geometry and magnetic coordinates is derived and\nshown to be non-negligible for typical TJ-II plasma conditions. In the second\npart of the article, we apply the fluid model including main ion-impurity\nfriction and inertia to observations of asymmetric emissivity patterns in\nneutral beam heated plasmas of the TJ-II stellarator. The model is able to\nexplain qualitatively several features of the radiation asymmetry, both in\nstationary and transient conditions, based on the calculated in-surface\nvariations of the impurity density.\n", "  An effective supersymmetric QCD light-front Hamiltonian for hadrons composed\nof light quarks, which includes a spin-spin interaction between the hadronic\nconstituents, is constructed by embedding superconformal quantum mechanics into\nAdS space. A specific breaking of conformal symmetry inside the graded algebra\ndetermines a unique effective quark-confining potential for light hadrons, as\nwell as remarkable connections between the meson and baryon spectra. The\nresults are consistent with the empirical features of the light-quark hadron\nspectra, including a universal mass scale for the slopes of the meson and\nbaryon Regge trajectories and a zero-mass pion in the limit of massless quarks.\nOur analysis is consistently applied to the excitation spectra of the $\\pi,\n\\rho, K, K^*$ and $\\phi$ meson families as well as to the $N, \\Delta, \\Lambda,\n\\Sigma, \\Sigma^*, \\Xi$ and $\\Xi^*$ in the baryon sector. We also predict the\nexistence of tetraquarks which are degenerate in mass with baryons with the\nsame angular momentum. The mass of light hadrons is expressed in a universal\nand frame-independent decomposition in the semiclassical approximation\ndescribed here.\n", "  We report the discovery of three new substellar companions to solar-type\nstars, HD191806, HD214823, and HD221585, based on radial velocity measurements\nobtained at the Haute-Provence Observatory. Data from the SOPHIE spectrograph\nare combined with observations acquired with its predecessor, ELODIE, to detect\nand characterise the orbital parameters of three new gaseous giant and brown\ndwarf candidates. Additionally, we combine SOPHIE data with velocities obtained\nat the Lick Observatory to improve the parameters of an already known giant\nplanet companion, HD16175 b. Thanks to the use of different instruments, the\ndata sets of all four targets span more than ten years. Zero-point offsets\nbetween instruments are dealt with using Bayesian priors to incorporate the\ninformation we possess on the SOPHIE/ELODIE offset based on previous studies.\n  The reported companions have orbital periods between three and five years and\nminimum masses between 1.6 Mjup and 19 Mjup. Additionally, we find that the\nstar HD191806 is experiencing a secular acceleration of over 11 \\ms\\ per year,\npotentially due to an additional stellar or substellar companion. A search for\nthe astrometric signature of these companions was carried out using Hipparcos\ndata. No orbit was detected, but a significant upper limit to the companion\nmass can be set for HD221585, whose companion must be substellar.\n  With the exception of HD191806 b, the companions are located within the\nhabitable zone of their host star. Therefore, satellites orbiting these objects\ncould be a propitious place for life to develop.\n", "  Absorption, photoluminescence, and photoluminescence excitation spectra of\nsolutions and thin films of N-vinylcarbazole polymers and copolymers with\nvarious substituents directly on the carbazole moiety and on the polymer chain\nwere studied comprehensively. Polymers that were used previously to develop\npolymer composites with polymethine dyes having photosensitivity over a broad\nspectral range including the visible and near-IR regions were selected for the\nstudies.\n", "  The capability of optical resonators to extend the effective radiation-matter\ninteraction length originates from a multipass effect, hence is intrinsically\nlimited by the resonator quality factor. Here, we show that this constraint can\nbe overcome by combining the concepts of resonant interaction and coherent\nperfect absorption. We demonstrate and investigate super-resonant coherent\nabsorption in a coupled Fabry-Perot-ring cavity structure. At the FP resonant\nwavelengths, the described phenomenon gives rise to split modes with a\nnearly-transparent peak and a peak whose transmission is exceptionally\nsensitive to the intracavity loss. For small losses, the effective interaction\npathlength of these modes is proportional respectively to the ratio and the\nproduct of the individual finesse coefficients of the two resonators. The\nresults presented extend the conventional definition of resonant absorption and\npoint to a way of circumventing the technological limitations of\nultrahigh-quality resonators in spectroscopy and optical sensing schemes\n", "  The carbon dimer, the $^{12}$C$_2$ molecule, is ubiquitous in astronomical\nenvironments. Experimental-quality rovibronic energy levels are reported for\n$^{12}$C$_2$, based on rovibronic transitions measured for and among its\nsinglet, triplet, and quintet electronic states, reported in 42 publications.\nThe determination utilizes the Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy\nLevels (MARVEL) technique. The 23,343 transitions measured experimentally and\nvalidated within this study determine 5,699 rovibronic energy levels, 1,325,\n4,309, and 65 levels for the singlet, triplet, and quintet states investigated,\nrespectively. The MARVEL analysis provides rovibronic energies for six singlet,\nsix triplet, and two quintet electronic states. For example, the lowest\nmeasurable energy level of the \\astate\\ state, corresponding to the $J=2$ total\nangular momentum quantum number and the $F_1$ spin-multiplet component, is\n603.817(5) \\cm. This well-determined energy difference should facilitate\nobservations of singlet--triplet intercombination lines which are thought to\noccur in the interstellar medium and comets. The large number of highly\naccurate and clearly labeled transitions that can be derived by combining\nMARVEL energy levels with computed temperature-dependent intensities should\nhelp a number of astrophysical observations as well as corresponding laboratory\nmeasurements. The experimental rovibronic energy levels, augmented, where\nneeded, with {\\it ab initio} variational ones based on empirically adjusted and\nspin-orbit coupled potential energy curves obtained using the \\Duo\\ code, are\nused to obtain a highly accurate partition function, and related thermodynamic\ndata, for $^{12}$C$_2$ up to 4,000 K.\n", "  A Fourier Transform (FT) absorption spectrum of room temperature NH3 in the\nregion 7400 - 8600 cm-1 is analysed using a variational line list and ground\nstate energies determined using the MARVEL procedure. The spectrum was measured\nby Dr Catherine de Bergh in 1980 and is available from the Kitt Peak data\ncenter. The centers and intensities of 8468 ammonia lines were retrieved using\na multiline fitting procedure. 2474 lines are assigned to 21 bands providing\n1692 experimental energies in the range 7000 - 9000 cm-1. The spectrum was\nassigned by the joint use of the BYTe variational line list and combination\ndifferences. The assignments and experimental energies presented in this work\nare the first for ammonia in the region 7400 - 8600 cm-1, considerably\nextending the range of known vibrational-excited states\n", "  The latest and most precise top quark measurements at the LHC and Tevatron\nare used to establish new limits on the $Wtb$ vertex. Recent results on the\nmeasurements of the $W$-boson helicity fractions and single top quark\nproduction cross section are combined in order to establish new limits at 95%\nCL (confidence level). The allowed regions for these limits are presented, for\nthe first time, in three-dimensional graphics, for both real and imaginary\ncomponents of the different anomalous couplings, providing a new perspective on\nthe impact of the combination of different physics observables. These results\nare also combined with the prospected future measurement of the single top\nquark production cross section and $W$-boson helicity fractions at the LHC.\n", "  Blandford-Znajek process, the steady electromagnetic energy extraction from a\nrotating black hole (BH), is widely believed to work for driving relativistic\njets in active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts and Galactic microquasars,\nalthough it is still under debate how the Poynting flux is causally produced\nand how the rotational energy of the BH is reduced. We generically discuss the\nKerr BH magnetosphere filled with a collisionless plasma screening the electric\nfield along the magnetic field, extending the arguments of Komissarov and our\nprevious paper, and propose a new picture for resolving the issues. For the\nmagnetic field lines threading the equatorial plane in the ergosphere, we find\nthat the inflow of particles with negative energy as measured in the coordinate\nbasis is generated near that plane as a feedback from the Poynting flux\nproduction, which appears to be a similar process to the mechanical Penrose\nprocess. For the field lines threading the event horizon, we first show that\nthe concept of the steady inflow of negative electromagnetic energy is not\nphysically essential, partly because the sign of the electromagnetic energy\ndensity depends on the coordinates. Then we build an analytical toy model of a\ntime-dependent process both in the Boyer-Lindquist and Kerr-Schild coordinate\nsystems in which the force-free plasma injected continuously is filling a\nvacuum, and suggest that the structure of the steady outward Poynting flux is\ncausally constructed by the displacement current and the cross-field current at\nthe in-going boundary between the plasma and the vacuum. In the steady state,\nthe Poynting flux is maintained without any electromagnetic source.\n", "  Band renormalization effects (BRE) are comprehensively studied for a mixed\nstate of dx2-y2-wave superconducting (d-SC) and antiferromagnetic (AF) orders,\nin addition to simple d-SC, AF, and normal (paramagnetic) states, by applying a\nvariational Monte Carlo method to a two-dimensional Hubbard (t-t'-U) model. In\na weakly correlated regime (U=t<~6), BRE are negligible on all the states\nstudied. As previously shown, the effective band of d-SC is greatly\nrenormalized but the modifications of physical quantities, including energy\nimprovement, are negligible. In contrast, BRE on the AF state considerably\naffects various features of the system. Because the energy is markedly improved\nfor t'/t<0, the AF state occupies almost the whole underdoped regime in phase\ndiagrams. A doped metallic AF state undergoes a kind of Lifshitz transition at\nt'= t'L~-0.05t as t'/t varies, irrespective of the values of U/t and delta\n(doping rate). Pocket Fermi surfaces arise around (pi,0)[(pi/2,pi/2)] for\nt'>t'L [t'<t'L], which corresponds to the electron-hole asymmetry observed in\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra. The coexistent state\nof the two orders is possible basically for t'>t'L, because the existence of\nFermi surfaces near (pi,0) is a requisite for the electron scattering of\nq=(pi,pi). Actually, the coexistent state appears mainly for t'L/t<t'/t<~0.2 in\nthe mixed state. Nevertheless, the AF and coexisting states become unstable\ntoward phase separation for -0.05<~t'/t<~0.2 but become stable at other values\nof t'/t owing to the energy reduction by the diagonal hopping of doped holes.\nWe show that this instability does not directly correlate with the strength of\nd-SC.\n", "  We present a microwave quantum refrigeration principle based on the Josephson\neffect. When a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is pierced\nby a time-dependent magnetic flux, it induces changes in the macroscopic\nquantum phase and an effective finite bias voltage appears across the SQUID.\nThis voltage can be used to actively cool well below the lattice temperature\none of the superconducting electrodes forming the interferometer. The\nachievable cooling performance combined with the simplicity and scalability\nintrinsic to the structure pave the way to a number of applications in quantum\ntechnology.\n", "  This paper presents the measurement of the relative width difference $\\Delta\n\\Gamma_d / \\Gamma_d$ of the $B^0$-$\\bar B^0$ system using the data collected by\nthe ATLAS experiment at the LHC in $p p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25.2\nfb$^{-1}$. The value of $\\Delta \\Gamma_d / \\Gamma_d$ is obtained by comparing\nthe decay-time distributions of $B^0 \\to J/\\psi K_S$ and $B^0 \\to J/\\psi\nK^{*0}(892)$ decays. The result is $\\Delta \\Gamma_d / \\Gamma_d = (-0.1 \\pm\n1.1~\\mbox{(stat.)} \\pm 0.9~\\mbox{(syst.)}) \\times 10^{-2}$. Currently, this is\nthe most precise single measurement of $\\Delta \\Gamma_d / \\Gamma_d$. It agrees\nwith the Standard Model prediction and the measurements by other experiments.\n", "  Superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) are in general antagonistic,\nwhich makes their coexistence very rare. Following our recent discovery of\nrobust coexistence of SC and FM in RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ [Y. Liu et al., arXiv:\n1605.04396 (2016)], here we report another example of such a coexistence in its\nsister compound CsEuFe$_4$As$_4$, synthesized for the first time. The new\nmaterial exhibits bulk SC at 35.2 K and Eu$^{2+}$-spin ferromagnetic ordering\nat 15.5 K, demonstrating that it is a new robust ferromagnetic superconductor.\n", "  We study the behavior of the $s$-wave partial cross section $\\sigma(k)$, the\nWigner-Smith time delay $\\tau(k)$, and the trapping probability $P(k)$ as\nfunction of the wave number $k$. The $s$-wave central square well is used for\nconcreteness, simplicity, and to elucidate the controversy whether it shows\ntrue resonances. It is shown that, except for very sharp structures, the\nresonance part of the cross section, the trapping probability, and the time\ndelay, reach their local maxima at different values of $k$. We show numerically\nthat $\\tau(k)>0$ at its local maxima, occuring just before the resonant part of\nthe cross section reaches its local maxima. These results are discussed in the\nlight of the standard definition of resonance.\n", "  We discuss homogeneous baryonic matter in the decompactified limit of the\nSakai-Sugimoto model, improving existing approximations based on flat-space\ninstantons. We allow for an anisotropic deformation of the instantons in the\nholographic and spatial directions and for a density-dependent distribution of\narbitrarily many instanton layers in the bulk. Within our approximation, the\nbaryon onset turns out to be a second-order phase transition, at odds with\nnature, and there is no transition to quark matter at high densities, at odds\nwith expectations from QCD. This changes when we impose certain constraints on\nthe shape of single instantons, motivated by known features of holographic\nbaryons in the vacuum. Then, a first-order baryon onset and chiral restoration\nat high density are possible, and at sufficiently large densities two instanton\nlayers are formed dynamically. Our results are a further step towards\ndescribing realistic, strongly interacting matter over a large density regime\nwithin a single model, desirable for studies of compact stars.\n", "  We analyse strong gravitational field time delay for photons coupled to the\nWeyl tensor in a Schwarzschild black hole. By making use of the method of\nstrong deflection limit, we find that these time delays between relativistic\nimages are significantly affected by polarization directions of such a\ncoupling. A practical problem about determination of the polarization direction\nby observations is investigated. It is found that if the first and second\nrelativistic images can be resolved, the measurement of time delay can more\neffectively improve detectability of the polarization direction.\n", "  Tsirelson's problem asks whether the commuting operator model for two-party\nquantum correlations is equivalent to the tensor-product model. We give a\nnegative answer to this question by showing that there are non-local games\nwhich have perfect commuting-operator strategies, but do not have perfect\ntensor-product strategies. The weak Tsirelson problem, which is known to be\nequivalent to Connes embedding problem, remains open.\n  The examples we construct are instances of (binary) linear system games. For\nsuch games, previous results state that the existence of perfect strategies is\ncontrolled by the solution group of the linear system. Our main result is that\nevery finitely-presented group embeds in some solution group. As an additional\nconsequence, we show that the problem of determining whether a linear system\ngame has a perfect commuting-operator strategy is undecidable.\n", "  In this work we study a 3-state ($+1$, $-1$, $0$) opinion model in the\npresence of noise and disorder. We consider pairwise competitive interactions,\nwith a fraction $p$ of those interactions being negative (disorder). Moreover,\nthere is a noise $q$ that represents the probability of an individual\nspontaneously change his opinion to the neutral state. Our aim is to study how\nthe increase/decrease of the fraction of neutral agents affects the critical\nbehavior of the system and the evolution of opinions. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the order parameter of the model, as well as for the stationary\nfraction of each opinion, and we show that there are distinct phase\ntransitions. One is the usual ferro-paramagnetic transition, that is in the\nIsing universality class. In addition, there are para-absorbing and\nferro-absorbing transitions, presenting the directed percolation universality\nclass. Our results are complemented by numerical simulations.\n", "  Quantum effects on a Landau-type system associated with a moving atom with a\nmagnetic quadrupole moment subject to confining potentials are analysed. It is\nshown that the spectrum of energy of the Landau-type system can be modified,\nwhere the degeneracy of the energy levels can be broken. In three particular\ncases, it is shown that the analogue of the cyclotron frequency is modified,\nand the possible values of this angular frequency of the system are determined\nby the quantum numbers associated with the radial modes and the angular\nmomentum and by the parameters associated with confining potentials in order\nthat bound states solutions can be achieved.\n", "  This paper reviews the recent results in high-resolution spectroscopy on cold\nmolecules. Laser spectroscopy of cold molecules addresses issues of symmetry\nviolation, like in the search for the electric dipole moment of the electron\nand the studies on energy differences in enantiomers of chiral species; tries\nto improve the precision to which fundamental physical constants are known and\ntests for their possible variation in time and space; tests quantum\nelectrodynamics, and searches for a fifth force. Further, we briefly review the\nrecent technological progresses in the fields of cold molecules and\nmid-infrared lasers, which are the tools that mainly set the limits for the\nresolution that is currently attainable in the measurements.\n", "  A study of nonreciprocal transverse-spin angular-momentum-density shifts for\nevanescent waves in magneto-optic waveguide media is presented. Their\nfunctional relation to electromagnetic spin- and orbital-momenta is presented\nand analyzed. It is shown that the magneto-optic gyrotropy can be\nre-interpreted as the nonreciprocal electromagnetic spin-density shift per unit\nenergy flux, thus providing an interesting alternative physical picture for the\nmagneto-optic gyrotropy. The transverse spin-density shift is found to be\nthickness-dependent in slab optical waveguides. This dependence is traceable to\nthe admixture of minority helicity components in the transverse spin angular\nmomentum. It is also shown that the transverse spin is magnetically tunable. A\nformulation of electromagnetic spin-orbit coupling in magneto-optic media is\npresented, and an alternative source of spin-orbit coupling to non-paraxial\noptics vortices is proposed. It is shown that magnetization-induced\nelectromagnetic spin-orbit coupling is possible, and that it leads to spin to\norbital angular momentum conversion in magneto-optic media evanescent waves.\n", "  We present new solution of the the connection problem for local solutions to\nthe general Heun equation. Our approach is based on the symmetric form of the\nHeun's differential equation \\cite{Fiziev14,Fiziev16} with four different\nregular singular points $z_{1,2,3,4}$. The four special regular points in the\ncomplex plane: $Z_{123},Z_{234},Z_{341},Z_{412}$ are the centers of the\ncircles, defined by the different triplets $\\{z_k,z_l,z_m\\}$ with corresponding\ndifferent indexes and play fundamental role, since the coefficients of the\nconnection matrix can be expressed using the values of local solutions of the\ngeneral Heun's equation at these points. A special case when all coefficients\ncan be calculated using only one of the points $Z_{klm}$ is also considered.\n", "  An approximate neutrino mixing matrix is formutated by using the standard\nneutrino mixing matrix as a basis and experimental data of neutrino\noscillations as inputs. By using the resulted approximate neutrino mixing\nmatrix to proceed the neutrino mass matrix and constraining the resulted\nneutrino mass matrix with zero texture:\n$M_{\\nu}(1,1)=M_{\\nu}(1,3)=M_{\\nu}(3,1)=0$, we can have neutrino masses as\nfunction of mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ with normal hierarchy:\n$m_{1}<m_{2}<m_{3}$. By taking the central value of mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}=9^{o}$ that gives $\\epsilon=0.16$ and using the squared mass\ndifference: $\\Delta m_{32}^{2}$ for normal hierarchy, we then obtained neutrino\nmasses: $m_{1}=0.00847$ eV, $m_{2}=0.01215$ eV, and $m_{3}=0.05062$ eV which\ncan predict the squared mass difference for solar neutrino precisely with the\nexperimental result: $\\Delta m_{21}^{2}=7.59\\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm eV^{2}}$\n", "  The electronic structure of transition metal oxides featuring correlated\nelectrons can be rationalized within the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework.\nFollowing a brief description of the present paradigms of electronic behavior,\nwe focus on the physics of rare earth nickelates as an archetype of complexity\nemerging within the charge transfer regime. The intriguing prospect of\nrealizing the physics of high $T_c$ cuprates through heterostructuring resulted\nin a massive endeavor to epitaxially stabilize these materials in ultra-thin\nform. A plethora of new phenomena unfolded in such artificial structures due to\nthe effect of epitaxial strain, quantum confinement, and interfacial charge\ntransfer. Here we review the present status of artificial rare-earth nickelates\nin an effort to uncover the interconnection between the electronic and magnetic\nbehavior and the underlying crystal structure. We conclude by discussing future\ndirections to disentangle the puzzle regarding the origin of the\nmetal-insulator transition, the role of oxygen holes, and the true nature of\nthe antiferromagnetic spin configuration in the ultra-thin limit.\n", "  We report on a comparative study of the electronic structure, phonon spectra,\nand superconducting properties for recently discovered superconducting\nhydrides, H3S and H3P. While the electronic structures of these two materials\nare similar, there are notable changes in the phonon spectra and\nelectron-phonon coupling. The low-frequency bond-bending modes are softened in\nH3P and their coupling to the electrons at the Fermi surface is enhanced\nrelative to H3S. Nevertheless, coupling to the high-frequency modes is reduced\nso the resulting calculated superconducting transition temperature is reduced\nfrom ~166 K in H3S to ~76 K in H3P.\n", "  We introduce a new coarse-graining algorithm, tensor network skeletonization,\nfor the numerical computation of tensor networks. This approach utilizes a\nstructure-preserving skeletonization procedure to remove short-range\ncorrelations effectively at every scale. This approach is first presented in\nthe setting of 2D statistical Ising model and is then extended to higher\ndimensional tensor networks and disordered systems. When applied to the\nEuclidean path integral formulation, this approach also gives rise to new\nefficient representations of the ground states for 1D and 2D quantum Ising\nmodels.\n", "  This paper investigates an acoustic prism for continuous acoustic beam\nsteering by a simple frequency sweep. This idea takes advantages of acoustic\nwave velocity shifting in metamaterials in the vicinity of local resonance. We\napply this concept into the piezoelectric metamaterial consisting of host\nmedium and piezoelectric LC shunt. Theoretical modeling and FEM simulations are\ncarried out. It is shown that the phase velocity of acoustic wave changes\ndramatically in the vicinity of local resonance. The directions of acoustic\nwave can be adjusted continuously between 2 to 16 degrees by a simple sweep of\nthe excitation frequency. Such an electro-mechanical coupling system has a\nfeature of adjusting local resonance without altering the mechanical part of\nthe system.\n", "  In this talk we present the first calculation of next-to-leading-order QCD\ncorrections for the production of $W^+W^-$ pairs in association with three jets\nat the LHC. We show the observed improvement in the dependence of total and\ndifferential cross sections on the unphysical renormalization and factorization\nscales. We study the radiation pattern for configurations associated to\nvector-boson fusion and the impact that the QCD corrections have on them.\n", "  Recently, there have been considerable efforts to use online data to\ninvestigate international migration. These efforts show that Web data are\nvaluable for estimating migration rates and are relatively easy to obtain.\nHowever, existing studies have only investigated flows of people along\nmigration corridors, i.e. between pairs of countries. In our work, we use data\nabout \"places lived\" from millions of Google+ users in order to study migration\n\"clusters\", i.e. groups of countries in which individuals have lived. For the\nfirst time, we consider information about more than two countries people have\nlived in. We argue that these data are very valuable because this type of\ninformation is not available in traditional demographic sources which record\ncountry-to-country migration flows independent of each other. We show that\nmigration clusters of country triads cannot be identified using information\nabout bilateral flows alone. To demonstrate the additional insights that can be\ngained by using data about migration clusters, we first develop a model that\ntries to predict the prevalence of a given triad using only data about its\nconstituent pairs. We then inspect the groups of three countries which are more\nor less prominent, compared to what we would expect based on bilateral flows\nalone. Next, we identify a set of features such as a shared language or\ncolonial ties that explain which triple of country pairs are more or less\nlikely to be clustered when looking at country triples. Then we select and\ncontrast a few cases of clusters that provide some qualitative information\nabout what our data set shows. The type of data that we use is potentially\navailable for a number of social media services. We hope that this first study\nabout migration clusters will stimulate the use of Web data for the development\nof new theories of international migration that could not be tested\nappropriately before.\n", "  There is a huge abundance of viruses and membrane vesicles in seawater. We\ndescribe a new full-field, incoherently illuminated, shot-noise limited,\ncommon-path interferometric detection method that we couple with the analysis\nof Brownian motion to detect, quantify, and differentiate biotic nanoparticles.\nWe validated the method with calibrated nanoparticles and homogeneous DNA or\nRNA.viruses. The smallest virus size that we characterized with a suitable\nsignal-to-noise ratio was around 30 nm in diameter. Analysis of Brownian\nmotions revealed anisotropic trajectories for myoviruses.We further applied the\nmethod for vesicles detection and for analysis of coastal and oligotrophic\nsamples from Tara Oceans circumnavigation.\n", "  The existence of travelling waves for a model of concentration waves of\nbacteria is investigated. The model consists in a kinetic equation for the\nbiased motion of cells following a run-and-tumble process, coupled with two\nreaction-diffusion equations for the chemical signals. Strong mathematical\ndifficulties arise in comparison with the diffusive regime which was studied in\na previous work. The cornerstone of the proof consists in establishing\nmonotonicity properties of the spatial density of cells. Travelling waves exist\nunder certain conditions on the parameters. Counter-examples to both existence\nand uniqueness are found numerically after careful analysis of the discrete\nvelocity problem.\n", "  Community detection aims to reveal the community structure in a social\nnetwork, which is one of the fundamental problems. In this paper we investigate\nthe community detection problem based on the concept of terminal set. A\nterminal set is a group of users within which any two users belong to different\ncommunities. Although the community detection is hard in general, the terminal\nset can be very helpful in designing effective community detection algorithms.\nWe first present a 2-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time for the\noriginal community detection problem. In the other issue, in order to better\nsupport real applications we further consider the case when extra restrictions\nare imposed on feasible partitions. For such customized community detection\nproblems, we provide two randomized algorithms which are able to find the\noptimal partition with a high probability. Demonstrated by the experiments\nperformed on benchmark networks the proposed algorithms are able to produce\nhigh-quality communities.\n", "  Using a four-band Hamiltonian, we study the phase boundary of\nspin-polarized-current state (SPCS) of interacting electrons in bilayer\ngraphene. The model of spin-polarized-current state has previously been shown\nto resolve a number of experimental puzzles in bilayer graphene. The phase\nboundaries of the SPCS with and without the external voltage between the two\nlayers are obtained in this work. An unusual phase boundary where there are two\ntransition temperatures for a given carrier concentration is found at finite\nexternal voltage. The physics of this phenomenon is explained.\n", "  We employed the SERENDIP III system with the Arecibo radio telescope to\nsearch for possible artificial extraterrestrial signals. Over the four years of\nthis search we covered 93% of the sky observable at Arecibo at least once and\n44% of the sky five times or more with a sensitivity of ~3E-25 W/m2. The data\nwere sent to a 4 million channel spectrum analyzer. Information was obtained\nfrom over 1E+14 independent data points and the results were then analyzed via\na suite of pattern detection algorithms to identify narrow band spectral power\npeaks that were not readily identifiable as the product of human activity. We\nseparately selected data coincident with interesting nearby G dwarf stars that\nwere encountered by chance in our sky survey for suggestions of excess power\npeaks. The peak power distributions in both these data sets were consistent\nwith random noise. We report upper limits on possible signals from the stars\ninvestigated and provide examples of the most interesting candidates identified\nin the sky survey. This paper was intended for publication in 2000 and is\npresented here without change from the version submitted to ApJS in 2000.\n", "  By using the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method and\nfull potential local orbital minimum basis (FP-LOMB) method within generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA), we studied the electronic structures and magnetic\nproperties of nickel and chromium single dopants in polytypes of silicon\ncarbide (SiC). The magnetic phases of defects are found to be strongly\ndependent on the external stress on the supercell. In 3C-SiC, the Ni single\ndopant exhibits an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition at\na moderate compressive and tensile hydrostatic strain in Si-sub and C-sub\ncases. In contrast, the Ni single dopant in 4H-SiC is stably in the nonmagnetic\nphase under external stress. The Cr single dopant is also insensitive to the\napplied stress but stably in the magnetic phase. This strain controlled\nmagnetic transition makes the Ni single dopant a novel scheme of qubit.\n", "  Distributed storage plays an essential role in realizing robust and secure\ndata storage in a network over long periods of time. A distributed storage\nsystem consists of a data owner machine, multiple storage servers and channels\nto link them. In such a system, secret sharing scheme is widely adopted, in\nwhich secret data are split into multiple pieces and stored in each server. To\nreconstruct them, the data owner should gather plural pieces. Shamir's (k,\nn)-threshold scheme, in which the data are split into n pieces (shares) for\nstorage and at least k pieces of them must be gathered for reconstruction,\nfurnishes information theoretic security, that is, even if attackers could\ncollect shares of less than the threshold k, they cannot get any information\nabout the data, even with unlimited computing power. Behind this scenario,\nhowever, assumed is that data transmission and authentication must be perfectly\nsecure, which is not trivial in practice. Here we propose a totally information\ntheoretically secure distributed storage system based on a user-friendly\nsingle-password-authenticated secret sharing scheme and secure transmission\nusing quantum key distribution, and demonstrate it in the Tokyo metropolitan\narea.\n", "  Two transitions were found by ellipsometry in freestanding high molecular\nweight PS films by Pye and Roth (PR). PR suggested that the upper and the lower\ntransitions both came from the segmental a-relaxation, and the upper transition\noccurs in 90% of the material. In this paper we use dielectric relaxation data\nof freestanding films to rule out their suggestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nby experimental evidences that the sub-Rouse modes are coupled to density, and\nrespond to physical aging to validate our interpretation and can explain the\nupper transition.\n", "  A computed line list for hydrogen peroxide, H$_2{}^{16}$O$_2$, applicable to\ntemperatures up to $T=1250$~K is presented. A semi-empirical high accuracy\npotential energy surface is constructed and used with an {\\it ab initio} dipole\nmoment surface as input TROVE to compute 7.5 million rotational-vibrational\nstates and around 20 billion transitions with associated Einstein-$A$\ncoefficients for rotational excitations up to $J=85$. The resulting APTY line\nlist is complete for wavenumbers below 6~000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\lambda <\n1.67$~$\\mu$m) and temperatures up to 1250~K. Room-temperature spectra are\ncompared with laboratory measurements and data currently available in the\nHITRAN database and literature. Our rms with line positions from the literature\nis 0.152 \\cm\\ and our absolute intensities agree better than 10\\%. The full\nline list is available from the CDS databas\n", "  This work presents the AYT2 line list: a comprehensive list of 114 million\n$^{1}$H$_2$$^{32}$S vibration-rotation transitions computed using an\nempirically-adjusted potential energy surface and an {\\it ab initio} dipole\nmoment surface. The line list gives complete coverage up to 11000 \\cm\\\n(wavelengths longer than 0.91 $\\mu$m) for temperatures up to 2000 K. Room\ntemperature spectra can be simulated up to 20000 \\cm\\ (0.5 $\\mu$m) but the\npredictions at visible wavelengths are less reliable. AYT2 is made available in\nelectronic form as supplementary data to this article and at\n\\url{www.exomol.com}.\n", "  In spite of significant advances in replication technologies, methods to\nproduce well-defined three dimensional structures are still at its infancy.\nSuch a limitation would be evident if we were to produce a large array of\nsimple and, especially, compound convex lenses, also guaranteeing that their\nsurfaces would be molecularly smooth. Here, we report a novel method to produce\nsuch structures by cloning the 3D shape of nectar drops, found widely in\nnature, using conventional soft lithography.The elementary process involves\ntransfer of a thin patch of the sugar solution coated on a glass slide onto a\nhydrophobic substrate on which this patch evolves into a microdroplet. Upon the\nabsorption of water vapor, such a microdroplet grows linearly with time and its\nfinal size can be controlled by varying its exposure time to water vapor. At\nany stage of the evolution of the size of the drop, its shape can be cloned\nonto a soft elastomer by following the well-known methods of molding and\ncrosslinking the same. A unique new science that emerges in our attempt to\nunderstand the transfer of the sugar patch and its evolution to a spherical\ndrop is the elucidation of the mechanics underlying the contact of a deformable\nsphere against a solid support intervening a thin liquid film. A unique aspect\nof this work is to demonstrate that higher level structures can also be\ngenerated by transferring even smaller nucleation sites on the surface of the\nprimary lenses and then allowing them to grow by absorption of water vapor.\nWhat results at the end is either a well-controlled distribution of smooth\nhemispherical lenses or compound structures that could have potential\napplications in the fundamental studies of contact mechanics, wettability and\neven in optics.\n", "  The general and practical inversion of diffraction data-producing a computer\nmodel correctly representing the material explored - is an important unsolved\nproblem for disordered materials. Such modeling should proceed by using our\nfull knowledge base, both from experiment and theory. In this paper, we\ndescribe a robust method to jointly exploit the power of ab initio atomistic\nsimulation along with the information carried by diffraction data. The method\nis applied to two very different systems: amorphous silicon and two\ncompositions of a solid electrolyte memory material silver-doped GeSe3 . The\ntechnique is easy to implement, is faster and yields results much improved over\nconventional simulation methods for the materials explored. By direct\ncalculation, we show that the method works for both poor and excellent glass\nforming materials. It offers a means to add a priori information in first\nprinciples modeling of materials, and represents a significant step toward the\ncomputational design of non-crystalline materials using accurate interatomic\ninteractions and experimental information.\n", "  We demonstrate that time-domain ptychography, a recently introduced ultrafast\npulse reconstruction modality, has properties ideally suited for the temporal\ncharacterization of complex light pulses with large time-bandwidth products as\nit achieves temporal resolution on the scale of a single optical cycle using\nlong probe pulses, low sampling rates, and an extremely fast and robust\nalgorithm. In comparison to existing techniques, ptychography minimizes the\ndata to be recorded and processed, and drastically reduces the computational\ntime of the reconstruction. Experimentally we measure the temporal waveform of\nan octave-spanning, 3.5~ps long supercontinuum pulse generated in photonic\ncrystal fiber, resolving features as short as 5.7~fs with sub-fs resolution and\n30~dB dynamic range using 100~fs probe pulses and similarly large delay steps.\n", "  Inducing magnetic moment in otherwise nonmagnetic two-dimensional\nsemiconducting materials is the key first step to design spintronic materials.\nHere, we study the absorption of transition-metals on pristine and defected\nsingle-layer phosphorene, within density functional theory. We predict that\nincreased transition-metal diffusivity on pristine phosphorene would hinder any\npossibility of controlled magnetism, and thus any application. In contrast, the\npoint-defects will anchor metals, and exponentially reduce the diffusivity.\nSimilar to other two-dimensional materials, metals bind strongly on both\npristine and defected phosphorene, and we provide a microscopic description of\nbonding, which explain the qualitative trend with increasing number of valence\nelectrons. We further argue that the divacancy complex is imperative in any\npractical purpose due to their increased thermodynamic stability over\nmonovacancy. For most cases, the defect-transition metal complexes retain the\nintrinsic semiconduction properties, and also induce a local magnetic moment\nwith large exchange-splitting and spin-flip energies, which are necessary for\nspintronic applications. Specifically, the V/Mn/Fe absorbed at the divacancy\nhave tremendous promise in this regard. Further, we provide a simple\nmicroscopic model to describe the local moment formation in these transition\nmetal and defect complexes.\n", "  We demonstrate here that the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) obtained in micellar\nsolutions are susceptible to the precursor complex nature and specific\ncounterion effects controlling the reaction kinetics, particles size and shape.\nThe tested approach consisted in reducing the HAuCl4 complex with ascorbic acid\nor citric acid in dodecyltrimethylammonium (DTA) solutions, at 318 K, in the\npresence of bromide (Br), methanesulfonate (Ms), trifluoroacetate (TFA) or\ntrifluoromethanesulfonate (Tf) ions. Bromide ions replaced the chloride ions in\nthe precursor gold complex, and no nanoparticle formation could be observed in\nDTA-Br media, in the absence of seeds. In contrast, scanning electron\nmicroscopy images and atomic force microscopy measurements showed that\nquasi-spherical AuNPs were formed in DTA-Ms and DTA-TFA solutions, while flat\ndisk-like or triangular AuNPs were obtained in DTA-Tf solutions, with no need\nof adding seeds in all such cases. The results indicated that the reduction of\nthe precursor gold complex takes place at the micellar interface and that the\nspecific counterion effects should be taken into account for controlling\nnanoparticles formation in micellar media.\n", "  An approximate solution to the two dimensional Navier Stokes equation with\nperiodic boundary conditions is obtained by representing the x any y components\nof fluid velocity with complex Fourier basis vectors. The chosen space of basis\nvectors is finite to allow for numerical calculations, but of variable size.\nComparisons of the resulting approximate solutions as they vary with the size\nof the chosen vector space allow for extrapolation to an infinite basis vector\nspace. Results suggest that such a solution, with the full basis vector space\nand which would give the exact solution, would fail for certain initial\nvelocity configurations when initial velocity and time t exceed certain limits.\n", "  Data assimilation has been applied to coastal hydrodynamic models to better\nestimate system states or parameters by incorporating observed data into the\nmodel. Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most studied data assimilation methods\nwhose application is limited to linear systems. For nonlinear systems such as\nhydrodynamic models a variation of the KF called Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)\nis applied to update the system state in the context of Monte Carlo simulation.\nIn this research, a dual EnKF approach is used to simultaneously estimate state\n(water surface elevation) and parameters (bottom roughness and bathymetry) of\nthe shallow water models. The sensitivity of the filter to 1) the quantity and\nprecision of the observations, and 2) the initial estimation of parameters is\ninvestigated in a 1-D shallow water problem located in the Gulf of Mexico.\nResults show that starting from an initial estimate of bottom roughness and\nbathymetry within a logical range and utilizing observations available at a\nlimited number of gages the dual EnKF is able to improve the bottom roughness\nand bathymetry fields. The performance of the filter is sensitive to the\nprecision of measured data, especially in the case of estimating Mannings n and\nbathymetry simultaneously.\n", "  Lattice stability and metastability, as well as melting, are important\nfeatures of the physics and chemistry of dense hydrogen. Using ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD), the classical superheating limit and melting line of\nmetallic hydrogen are investigated up to 1.5 TPa. The computations show that\nthe classical superheating degree is about 100 K, and the classical melting\ncurve becomes flat at a level of 350 K when beyond 500 GPa. This information\nallows us to estimate the well depth and the potential barriers that must be\novercome when the crystal melts. Inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQE)\nusing path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) predicts that both superheating\nlimit and melting temperature are lowered to below room temperature, but the\nlatter never reach absolute zero. Detailed analysis indicates that the melting\nis thermally activated, rather than driven by pure zero-point motion (ZPM).\nThis argument was further supported by extensive PIMD simulations,\ndemonstrating the stability of Fddd structure against liquefaction at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We show that the Quantum State Distinguishability (QSD), which is a\nQSZK-complete problem, and the Quantum Circuit Distinguishability (QCD), which\nis a QIP-complete problem, can be solved by the verifier who can perform only\nsingle-qubit measurements. To show these results, we use measurement-based\nquantum computing: the honest prover sends a graph state to the verifier, and\nthe verifier can perform universal quantum computing on it with only\nsingle-qubit measurements. If the prover is malicious, he does not necessarily\ngenerate the correct graph state, but the verifier can verify the correctness\nof the graph state by measuring the stabilizer operators.\n", "  This review is on the phase field modelling studies in elastic stress effects\non microstructural instabilities. We will focus primarily on four elastic\nstress driven instabilities: (i) Spinodal phase separation; (ii) Particle\nsplitting; (iii) Rafting; and, (iv) Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld (ATG) instabilities.\nThis review is organised as follows: in Section 1, we briefly describe some of\nthe important and interesting experimental observations on elastic stress\neffects on microstructural instabilities; in Section 2, we describe, in\nreasonable detail, the theoretical developments in understanding the effects of\nelastic stress on microstructural instabilities in solids. Both Section 1 and 2\nare neither comprehensive nor complete; however, they are helpful in setting\nthe stage for discussion of (and, in giving a perspective on) phase field\nmodelling studies that will be discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, we\nconclude with a summary and indication of future directions.\n", "  We study single inclusive forward hadron production in high energy\nproton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order in the Color Glass\nCondensate framework. Recent studies have shown that the next-to-leading order\ncorrections to this process are large and negative at large transverse\nmomentum, leading to negative cross sections. We propose to overcome this\ndifficulty by introducing an explicit rapidity factorization scale when\nsubtracting the rapidity divergence into the evolution of the target.\n", "  The nuclear suppression of forward $J/\\psi$ production in high energy\nproton-nucleus collisions can be used as a probe of gluon saturation at small\n$x$. In an earlier work we studied this suppression in minimum bias collisions\nin the Color Glass Condensate formalism, relying on the optical Glauber model\nto obtain the dipole cross section of the nucleus from the one of the proton\nfitted to HERA DIS data. Here we study how the impact parameter dependence of\nthis model can be used to compare our results with recent LHC data on the\ncentrality dependence of this suppression.\n", "  Coherently manipulating multipartite quantum correlations leads to remarkable\nadvantages in quantum information processing. A fundamental question is whether\nsuch quantum advantages persist only by exploiting multipartite correlations,\nsuch as entanglement. Recently, Dale, Jennings, and Rudolph negated the\nquestion by showing that a randomness processing, quantum Bernoulli factory,\nusing quantum coherence, is strictly more powerful than the one with classical\nmechanics. In this Letter, focusing on the same scenario, we propose a\ntheoretical protocol that is classically impossible but can be implemented\nsolely using quantum coherence without entanglement. We demonstrate the\nprotocol by exploiting the high-fidelity quantum state preparation and\nmeasurement with a superconducting qubit in the circuit quantum electrodynamics\narchitecture and a nearly quantum-limited parametric amplifier. Our experiment\nshows the advantage of using quantum coherence of a single qubit for\ninformation processing even when multipartite correlation is not present.\n", "  Metal-insulator transition is observed in the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 thin films with\nthickness larger than 5 unit cells. Insulating phase at lower temperature\nappeared in the ultrathin films with thickness ranging from 6 unit cells to 10\nunit cells and it is found that the Mott variable range hopping conduction\ndominates in this insulating phase at low temperature with a decrease of\nlocalization length in thinner films. A deficiency of oxygen content and a\nresulted decrease of the Mn valence have been observed in the ultrathin films\nwith thickness smaller than or equal to 10 unit cells by studying the\naberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy of the films. These results suggest that the existence\nof the oxygen vacancies in thinner films suppresses the double-exchange\nmechanism and contributes to the enhancement of disorder, leading to a decrease\nof the Curie temperature and the low temperature insulating phase in the\nultrathin films. In addition, the suppression of the magnetic properties in\nthinner films indicates stronger disorder of magnetic moments, which is\nconsidered to be the reason for this decrease of the localization length.\n", "  MoS2 monolayers exhibit excellent light absorption and large thermoelectric\npower, which are, however, accompanied with very strong exciton binding energy\n- resulting in complex photoresponse characteristics. We study the electrical\nresponse to scanning photo-excitation on MoS2 monolayer (1L) and bilayer (2L)\ndevices, and also on monolayer/bilayer (1L/2L) planar heterojunction and\nmonolayer/few-layer/multi-layer (1L/FL/ML) planar double heterojunction devices\nto unveil the intrinsic mechanisms responsible for photocurrent generation in\nthese materials and junctions. Strong photoresponse modulation is obtained by\nscanning the position of the laser spot, as a consequence of controlling the\nrelative dominance of a number of layer dependent properties, including (i)\nphotoelectric effect (PE), (ii) photothermoelectric effect (PTE), (iii)\nexcitonic effect, (iv) hot photo-electron injection from metal, and (v) carrier\nrecombination. The monolayer and bilayer devices show peak photoresponse when\nthe laser is focused at the source junction, while the peak position shifts to\nthe monolayer/multi-layer junction in the heterostructure devices. The\nphotoresponse is found to be dependent on the incoming light polarization when\nthe source junction is illuminated, although the polarization sensitivity\ndrastically reduces at the monolayer/multi-layer heterojunction. Finally, we\ninvestigate laser position dependent transient response of photocurrent to\nreveal trapping of carriers in SiO2 at the source junction is the critical\nfactor to determine the transient response in 2D photodetectors, and also show\nthat, by systematic device design, such trapping can be avoided in the\nheterojunction devices, resulting in fast transient response. The insights\nobtained will play an important role in designing fast 2D TMDs based\nphotodetector and related optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.\n", "  Pairs of extrasolar giant planets in a mean motion commensurability are\ncommon with 2:1 resonance occurring most frequently. Disc-planet interaction\nprovides a mechanism for their origin. However, the time scale on which this\ncould operate in particular cases is unclear. We perform 2D and 3D numerical\nsimulations of pairs of giant planets in a protoplanetary disc as they form and\nmaintain a mean motion commensurability. We consider systems with current\nparameters similar to those of HD 155358, 24 Sextantis and HD 60532, and disc\nmodels of varying mass, decreasing mass corresponding to increasing age. For\nthe lowest mass discs, systems with planets in the Jovian mass range migrate\ninwards maintaining a 2:1 commensurability. Systems with the inner planet\ncurrently at around 1 au from the central star could have originated at a few\nau and migrated inwards on a time scale comparable to protoplanetary disc\nlifetimes. Systems of larger mass planets such as HD 60532 attain 3:1 resonance\nas observed. For a given mass accretion rate, results are insensitive to the\ndisc model for the range of viscosity prescriptions adopted, there being good\nagreement between 2D and 3D simulations. However, in a higher mass disc a pair\nof Jovian mass planets passes through 2:1 resonance before attaining a\ntemporary phase lasting a few thousand orbits in an unstable 5:3 resonance\nprior to undergoing a scattering. Thus finding systems in this commensurability\nis unlikely.\n", "  Understanding turbulence is critical for a wide range of terrestrial and\nastrophysical applications. Here we present first results of the world's\nhighest-resolution simulation of turbulence ever done. The current simulation\nhas a grid resolution of 10048^3 points and was performed on 65536 compute\ncores on SuperMUC at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ). We present a\nscaling test of our modified version of the FLASH code, which updates the\nhydrodynamical equations in less than 3 micro seconds per cell per time step. A\nfirst look at the column density structure of the 10048^3 simulation is\npresented and a detailed analysis is provided in a forthcoming paper.\n", "  We predict the cross-section for diffractive $\\phi$ electroproduction within\nthe dipole model, using a holographic meson wavefunction for the $\\phi$. For\nthe dipole cross-section, we use the Color Glass Condensate dipole model whose\nparameters are fitted to the latest 2015 combined HERA data on Deep Inelastic\nScattering. Choosing a strange quark mass of $0.14$ GeV, we find good agreement\nwith the available data.\n", "  We define and study the Cauchy problem for a 1-D nonlinear Dirac equation\nwith nonlinearities concentrated at one point. Global well-posedness is\nprovided and conservation laws for mass and energy are shown. Several examples,\nincluding nonlinear Gesztesy-\\v{S}eba models and the concentrated versions of\nthe Bragg Resonance, Gross-Neveu, and Soler type models, all within the scope\nof the present paper, are given. The key point of the proof consists in the\nreduction of the original equation to a nonlinear integral equation for an\nauxiliary, space-independent variable (the \"charge\").\n", "  The observed mass excesses of analog nuclear states with the same mass number\n$A$ and isospin $T$ can be used to test the isobaric multiplet mass equation\n(IMME), which has, in most cases, been validated to a high degree of precision.\nA recent measurement [Kankainen et al., Phys. Rev. C 93 041304(R) (2016)] of\nthe ground-state mass of $^{31}$Cl led to a substantial breakdown of the IMME\nfor the lowest $A = 31, T = 3/2$ quartet. The second-lowest $A = 31, T = 3/2$\nquartet is not complete, due to uncertainties associated with the identity of\nthe $^{31}$S member state. Using a fast $^{31}$Cl beam implanted into a plastic\nscintillator and a high-purity Ge $\\gamma$-ray detection array, $\\gamma$ rays\nfrom the $^{31}$Cl$(\\beta\\gamma)$$^{31}$S sequence were measured. Shell-model\ncalculations using USDB and the recently-developed USDE interactions were\nperformed for comparison. Isospin mixing between the $^{31}$S isobaric analog\nstate (IAS) at 6279.0(6) keV and a nearby state at 6390.2(7) keV was observed.\nThe second $T = 3/2$ state in $^{31}$S was observed at $E_x = 7050.0(8)$ keV.\nIsospin mixing in $^{31}$S does not by itself explain the IMME breakdown in the\nlowest quartet, but it likely points to similar isospin mixing in the mirror\nnucleus $^{31}$P, which would result in a perturbation of the $^{31}$P IAS\nenergy. USDB and USDE calculations both predict candidate $^{31}$P states\nresponsible for the mixing in the energy region slightly above $E_x = 6400$\nkeV. The second quartet has been completed thanks to the identification of the\nsecond $^{31}$S $T = 3/2$ state, and the IMME is validated in this quartet.\n", "  The induced two-dimensional topological N=1 supersymmetric sigma model on a\ndifferential Poisson manifold M presented in arXiv:1503.05625 is shown to be a\nspecial case of the induced Poisson sigma model on the bi-graded supermanifold\nT[0,1]M. The bi-degree comprises the standard N-valued target space degree,\ncorresponding to the form degree on the worldsheet, and an additional Z-valued\nfermion number, corresponding to the degree in the differential graded algebra\nof forms on M. The N=1 supersymmetry stems from the compatibility between the\n(extended) differential Poisson bracket and the de Rham differential on M. The\nlatter is mapped to a nilpotent vector field Q of bi-degree (0,1) on\nT*[1,0](T[0,1]M), and the covariant Hamiltonian action is Q-exact. New extended\nsupersymmetries arise as inner derivatives along special bosonic Killing\nvectors on M that induce Killing supervector fields of bi-degree (0,-1) on\nT*[1,0](T[0,1]M).\n", "  There currently exists a number of different schemes for laser based ion\nacceleration in the literature. Some of these schemes are also partly\noverlapping, making a clear distinction between the schemes difficult in\ncertain parameter regimes. Here, we provide a systematic numerical comparison\nbetween the following schemes and their analytical models: light-sail\nacceleration, Coulomb explosions, hole boring acceleration, and target normal\nsheath acceleration (TNSA). We study realistic laser parameters and various\ndifferent target designs, each optimized for one of the acceleration schemes,\nrespectively. As a means of comparing the schemes, we compute the ion current\ndensity generated at different laser powers, using two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and benchmark the particular analytical\nmodels for the corresponding schemes against the numerical results. Finally, we\ndiscuss the consequences for attaining high fluxes through the studied laser\nion-acceleration schemes.\n", "  We study the resonances of a two-by-two semiclassical system of one\ndimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators, near an energy where the two potentials\nintersect transversally, one of them being bonding, and the other one\nanti-bonding. Assuming that the interaction is a vector-field, we obtain\noptimal estimates on the location and on the widths of these resonances.\n", "  We discuss the envelope modulation assumption of frequency-domain models of\ntraveling wave tubes (TWTs) and test its consistency with the Maxwell\nequations. We compare the predictions of usual frequency-domain models with\nthose of a new time domain model of the TWT.\n", "  Studies of vertical and interhemispheric coupling during Sudden Stratospheric\nWarmings (SSWs) suggest that gravity wave (GW) momentum flux divergence plays a\nkey role in forcing the middle atmosphere, although observational validation of\nGW forcing is limited. We present a whole atmosphere view of zonal winds from\nthe surface to 100 km during the January 2013 major SSW, together with observed\nGW momentum fluxes in the mesopause region derived from uninterrupted\nhigh-resolution meteor radar observations from an All-Sky Interferometric\nMeteor Radar system located at Trondheim, Norway (63.4 $^{\\circ}$N, 10.5\n$^{\\circ}$E). Observations show GW momentum flux divergence 6 days prior to the\nSSW onset, producing an eastward forcing with peak values of $\\sim$+145 $\\pm$\n60m $s^{-1}$ $d^{-1}$. As the SSW evolves, GW forcing turns westward, reaching\na minimum of $\\sim$-240 $\\pm$ 70 m $s^{-1}$ $d^{-1}$ $\\sim$+18 days after the\nSSW onset. These results are discussed in light of previous studies and\nsimulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with Specified\nDynamics.\n", "  The nuclear quadruple moment is a fundamental character associated to the\nnuclei, this moment is related to the not purely spherical distribution in the\nnuclei, indeed its measure allows us to survey the geometric deformation of the\nnuclei of its spherical shape. The measurement methods of the quadruple moment\nis to study the electrical energy hyperfine interaction between the quadruple\nmoment and the electric field gradient due to atomics electrons, one of the\nmethods is the nuclear quadruple resonance NQR which is observed at the\ntransitions between energy levels splits by the effect of the quadruple\ninteraction and induced by a radio frequency field.\n", "  The combination is presented of all inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross\nsections previously published by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at HERA for\nneutral and charged current $ep$ scattering for zero beam polarisation. The\ndata were taken at proton beam energies of 920, 820, 575 and 460 GeV and an\nelectron beam energy of 27.5 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of about 1 fb$^{-1}$ and span six orders of magnitude in negative\nfour-momentum-transfer squared, $Q^2$, and Bjorken $x$. The correlations of the\nsystematic uncertainties were evaluated and taken into account for the\ncombination. The combined cross sections were input to QCD analyses at leading\norder, next-to-leading order and at next-to-next-to-leading order, providing a\nnew set of parton distribution functions, called HERAPDF2.0. Additionally, the\ninclusion of jet-production cross sections made a simultaneous and precise\ndetermination of parton distributions and the strong coupling constant\npossible. Brief highlights of the results are presented.\n", "  Let $E \\rightarrow M$ be a smooth vector bundle with a bilinear product on\n$\\Gamma(E)$ satisfying the Jacobi identity. Assuming only the existence of an\nanchor map $\\mathfrak{a}$ we show that $\\mathfrak{a}([X,Y]) =\n[\\mathfrak{a}X,\\mathfrak{a}Y]_c$. This gives the redundancy of the homomorphism\ncondition in the definition of Leibniz algebroid (in particular if it arises\nfrom a Nambu-Poisson manifold); an aspect not addressed in the literature. We\napply our result to the brackets of Hagiwara, Ibanez et. al; we settle an old\nquery of Uchino on redundancy for Courant bracket.\n", "  We propose that the diphoton resonance signal indicated by the recent LHC\ndata might also arise from the pair productions of vector-like heavy down-type\nquarks with mass around $750$ GeV and above. The vector-like quark decays into\nan ordinary light quark and a Standard Model singlet scalar. The subsequent\ndecay of scalar singlet produces the diphoton excess. Both the vector-like\nquark and singlet scalars appear naturally in the $E_6$, and their masses can\nbe in the TeV scale with a suitable choice of symmetry breaking pattern. The\nprediction of such a proposal would be to see an accompanying dijet signal at\nthe same mass with similar cross section in the $2\\gamma + 2j$ final state and\ntwo dijet resonances at the same mass for a $4j$ final state with a cross\nsection, about 100 times larger. Both predictions can be tested easily as the\nluminosity accumulates in the upcoming runs of the LHC.\n", "  Different economical configurations, due for instance to the relative cost of\nthe fuel it consumes, can push a heat engine into operating whether at maximum\nefficiency or at maximum power produced. Any relevant design of such system\nhence needs to be based, at least partly, on the knowledge of its specific\n\"power vs. efficiency\" characteristic curve. However, even when a simple model\nis used to describe the engine, obtained for example thanks to Finite\nDimensions Thermodynamics, such characteristic curve is often difficult to\nobtain and takes an explicit form only for the simplest of these models. When\nmore realistic models are considered, including complex internal subsystems or\nprocesses, an explicit expression for this curve is practically impossible to\nobtain. In this paper, we propose to use the called Graham's scan algorithm in\norder to directly obtain the power vs. efficiency curve of a realistic Stirling\nengine model, which includes heat leakage, regenerator effectiveness, as well\nas internal and external irreversibilities. Coupled with an adapted\noptimization routine, this approach allows to design and optimize the same way\nsimple or complex heat engine models. Such method can then be useful during the\npractical design task of any thermal power converter, almost regardless to its\nown internal complexity.\n", "  We report the design of a radio-frequency induction-heated rod casting\nfurnace that permits the preparation of polycrystalline ingots of intermetallic\ncompounds under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions. The central part of\nthe system is a bespoke water-cooled Hukin crucible supporting a casting mold.\nDepending on the choice of mold, typical rods have a diameter between 6 mm and\n10 mm and a length up to 90 mm, suitable for single-crystal growth by means of\nfloat-zoning. The setup is all-metal sealed and may be baked out. We find that\nthe resulting ultra-high vacuum represents an important precondition for\nprocessing compounds with high vapor pressures under a high-purity argon\natmosphere up to 3 bar. Using the rod casting furnace, we succeeded to prepare\nlarge high-quality single crystals of two half-Heusler compounds, namely the\nitinerant antiferromagnet CuMnSb and the half-metallic ferromagnet NiMnSb.\n", "  The review is concerned with the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) in\nthe presence of disorder. Disorder leads to localization in the form of the\nlocalized Anderson modes (AM), while nonlinearity is responsible for the\ninteraction between the AMs and transport. The dynamics of an initially\nlocalized wave packets are concerned in both classical and quantum cases. In\nboth cases, there is a subdiffusive spreading, which is explained in the\nframework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW), and it is shown that\nsubdiffusion is due to the transitions between those AMs, which are strongly\noverlapped. This overlapping being a common feature of both classical and\nquantum dynamics, leads to the clustering with an effective trapping of the\nwave packet inside each cluster. Therefore, the dynamics of the wave packet\ncorresponds to the CTRW, where the basic mechanism of subdiffusion is an\nentrapping of the wave packet with delay, or waiting, times distributed by the\npower law $w(t)\\sim 1/t^{1+\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is the transport exponent.\nIt is obtained that $\\alpha=1/3$ for the classical NLSE and $\\alpha=1/2$ for\nthe quantum NLSE.\n", "  Plyades: A Python Library for Space Mission Design Designing a space mission\nis a computation-heavy task. Software tools that conduct the necessary\nnumerical simulations and optimizations are therefore indispensable. The\nusability of existing software, written in Fortran and MATLAB, suffers because\nof high complexity, low levels of abstraction and out-dated programming\npractices. We propose Python as a viable alternative for astrodynamics tools\nand demonstrate the proof-of-concept library Plyades which combines powerful\nfeatures with Pythonic ease of use.\n", "  In this second part of our survey on the social and natural distributions, we\ninvestigate some models, which intend to explain the statistical regularity of\nthe natural and social distributions. There is a large variety of models and in\ntheir majority, they look for a power law, at least in the tail, although there\nare several real distributions which are not described by a power law. Among\nthe power law models, we discuss a) the two basic models and their variants:\nthe random multiplicative model and the preferential attachment model; b)\nmodels based on the BoseEinstein statistics; c) geographical, economical, and\ncriticality models. We present also some models, which do not intend to explain\na power law, and among them lognormal-like distributions, exponential and\nstretched exponential distributions. The interesting findings of this survey\nare that there are few models giving a power law for the complete distribution\nand that among them, the Zipf exponent 1 is rare.\n", "  We discuss briefly the first numerical implementation of the Loop-Tree\nDuality (LTD) method. We apply the LTD method in order to calculate ultraviolet\nand infrared finite multi-leg one-loop Feynman integrals. We attack scalar and\ntensor integrals with up to six legs (hexagons). The LTD method shows an\nexcellent performance independently of the number of external legs.\n", "  We analyse the Friedmann-Einstein equations for the Universe evolution with\nthe expansion parameter $a$ dependent on time only in the Einstein gravity with\nthe chameleon field, changing its mass in dependence of a density of its\nenvironment. We show that the chameleon field can be identified with\nquintessence (a canonical scalar field responsible for the late-time\nacceleration of the Universe expansion and dark energy dynamics) if and only if\nthe radiation rho_r(a) and matter rho_m(a) (dark and baryon matter) densities\nin the Universe evolution differ from their standard dependence on the\nexpansion parameter a, i.e. rho_r(a) ~ a^{-4} and rho_m ~ a^{-3}, respectively,\nand these deviations are caused by the conformal factor, relating the Einstein\nand Jordan frames and defining the interaction of the chameleon field with its\nenvironment.\n", "  Sunspot groups are the main source of solar flares, with the energy to power\nthem being supplied by magnetic-field evolution (e.g. flux emergence or\ntwisting/shearing). To date, few studies have investigated the statistical\nrelation between sunspot-group evolution and flaring, with none considering\nevolution in the McIntosh classification scheme. Here we present a statistical\nanalysis of sunspot groups from Solar Cycle 22, focusing on 24-hour changes in\nthe three McIntosh classification components. Evolution-dependent >C1.0, >M1.0,\nand >X1.0 flaring rates are calculated, leading to the following results: (i)\nflaring rates become increasingly higher for greater degrees of upward\nevolution through the McIntosh classes, with the opposite found for downward\nevolution; (ii) the highest flaring rates are found for upward evolution from\nlarger, more complex, classes (e.g. Zurich D- and E-classes evolving upward to\nF-class produce >C1.0 rates of 2.66 +/- 0.28 and 2.31 +/- 0.09 flares per 24\nhours, respectively); (iii) increasingly complex classes give higher rates for\nall flare magnitudes, even when sunspot groups do not evolve over 24 hours.\nThese results support the hypothesis that injection of magnetic energy by flux\nemergence (i.e. increasing in Zurich or compactness classes) leads to a higher\nfrequency and magnitude of flaring.\n", "  We present an implementation of the coherent dedispersion algorithm capable\nof dedispersing high-time-resolution radio observations to many different\ndispersion measures (DMs). This approach allows the removal of the dispersive\neffects of the interstellar medium and enables searches for pulsed emission\nfrom pulsars and other millisecond-duration transients at low observing\nfrequencies and/or high DMs where time broadening of the signal due to\ndispersive smearing would otherwise severely reduce the sensitivity. The\nimplementation, called 'cdmt', for Coherent Dispersion Measure Trials, exploits\nthe parallel processing capability of general-purpose graphics processing units\nto accelerate the computations. We describe the coherent dedispersion algorithm\nand detail how cdmt implements the algorithm to efficiently compute many\ncoherent DM trials. We present the concept of a semi-coherent dedispersion\nsearch, where coherently dedispersed trials at coarsely separated DMs are\nsubsequently incoherently dedispersed at finer steps in DM. The software is\nused in an ongoing LOFAR pilot survey to test the feasibility of performing\nsemi-coherent dedispersion searches for millisecond pulsars at 135MHz. This\npilot survey has led to the discovery of a radio millisecond pulsar -- the\nfirst at these low frequencies. This is the first time that such a broad and\ncomprehensive search in DM-space has been done using coherent dedispersion, and\nwe argue that future low-frequency pulsar searches using this approach are both\nscientifically compelling and feasible. Finally, we compare the performance of\ncdmt with other available alternatives.\n", "  Review of lepton dipole moments produced for the Physics In Collision 2015\nconference.\n", "  The intrinsic flexible character of polymeric materials also causes\nremarkable strain deformations along directions perpendicular to the applied\nstress. Here the biaxial response in the shear piezoelectricity of\npolyvinylidenefluoride copolymers is analyzed and their full piezoelectric\ntensors are provided. The microscopic shear is exploited in single suspended\nnanowires bent by localized loading to couple flexural deformation and\ntransverse piezoelectric response.\n", "  Bayesian estimation of a mixed quantum state can be approximated via maximum\nlikelihood (MaxLike) estimation when the likelihood function is sharp around\nits maximum. Such approximations rely on asymptotic expansions of\nmulti-dimensional Laplace integrals. When this maximum is on the boundary of\nthe integration domain, as it is the case when the MaxLike quantum state is not\nfull rank, such expansions are not standard. We provide here such expansions,\neven when this maximum does not belong to the smooth part of the boundary, as\nit is the case when the rank deficiency exceeds two. These expansions provide,\naside the MaxLike estimate of the quantum state, confidence intervals for any\nobservable. They confirm the formula proposed and used without precise\nmathematical justifications by the authors in an article recently published in\nPhysical Review A.\n", "  It is shown that a recent result regarding the average rate of evolution of a\ndynamical system at equilibrium in combination with the quantization of\ngeometric areas coming from LQG, implies the validity of Kepler's Second Law of\nplanetary motion.\n", "  We study a recently proposed new cosmological phase where a scalar field\nmoves periodically in an expanding spatially-flat Friedmann universe. This\nphase corresponds to a limiting cycle of the equations of motion and can be\nconsidered as a cosmological realization of a \"time-crystal\". We show that this\nphase is only possible, provided the Null Energy Condition is violated and the\nso-called Phantom divide is crossed. We prove that in general k-essence models:\ni) this crossing causes infinite growth of quantum perturbations on short\nscales, and ii) exactly periodic solutions are only possible, provided the\nlimiting cycle encircles a singularity in the phase plane. The configurations\nneighboring this singular curve in the phase space are linearly unstable on one\nside of the curve and superluminal on the other side. Moreover, the increment\nof the instability is infinitely growing for each mode by approaching the\nsingularity, while for the configurations on the other side, the sound speed is\ngrowing without limit. We illustrate our general results by analytical and\nnumerical studies of a particular class of such k-essence models.\n", "  These notes show and comment the examples that have been used to validate the\nCosmicFish code. We compare the results obtained with the code to several other\nresults available in literature finding an overall good level of agreement.

The\nCosmicFish code and the package to produce all the validation results presented\nhere are publicly available at http://cosmicfish.github.io. The present version\nis based on CosmicFish Jun16.\n", "  We present a renormalization group (RG) procedure which works naturally on a\nwide class of interacting one-dimension models based on perturbed (possibly\nstrongly) continuum conformal and integrable models. This procedure integrates\nKenneth Wilson's numerical renormalization group with Al. B. Zamolodchikov's\ntruncated conformal spectrum approach. Key to the method is that such theories\nprovide a set of completely understood eigenstates for which matrix elements\ncan be exactly computed. In this procedure the RG flow of physical observables\ncan be studied both numerically and analytically. To demonstrate the approach,\nwe study the spectrum of a pair of coupled quantum Ising chains and correlation\nfunctions in a single quantum Ising chain in the presence of a magnetic field.\n", "  After providing an extensive overview of the conceptual elements -- such as\nEinstein's `hole argument' -- that underpin Penrose's proposal for\ngravitationally induced quantum state reduction, the proposal is constructively\ncriticised. Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of\nquantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an\nill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound\nconflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here\nit is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the\nbreakdown of quantum mechanics is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the\ncollapse time of superpositions reduces to T --> oo (E --> 0) in the strictly\nNewtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate\nthe effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular,\nrecognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning in the domain of full `quantum\ngravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in\nprinciple corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is\nnot the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but\na Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions\nin relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the\ndistinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically\ndistinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an\naside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum\nmechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical\ncommutation relations [Q, P] = ih.\n", "  This is a review of ``Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-at-a-Distance:\nQuantum Mechanical Studies for Abner Shimony, Volume Two''.
