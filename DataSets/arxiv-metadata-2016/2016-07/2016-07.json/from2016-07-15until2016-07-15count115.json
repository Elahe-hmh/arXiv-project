Our data expose the inadequacy of any\nexisting theory to describe the minimum conductivity of graphene and indicate\nthat a more complete testing of the impurity scattering calculations will\nrequire improving the experimental capabilities by minimizing the contribution\nfrom the substrate-bound charged impurities and developing an ability to count\nthe number of adsorbates while measuring transport.\n", "  We present a novel microfield approach for studying the dependence of the\norientational polarization of the water in aqueous electrolyte solutions upon\nthe salt concentration and temperature. The model takes into account the\norientation of the solvent dipoles due to the electric field created by ions,\nand the effect of thermal fluctuations. The model predicts a dielectric\nfunctional dependence of the form $\\varepsilon(c)=\\varepsilon_w-\\beta L(3\\alpha\nc/\\beta),\\quad\\beta=\\varepsilon_w-\\varepsilon_{\\rm ms}$, where $L$ is the\nLangevin function, $c$ is the salt concentration, $\\varepsilon_w$ is the\ndielectric of pure water, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm ms}$ is the dielectric of the\nelectrolyte solution at the molten salt limit, and $\\alpha$ is the total excess\npolarization of the ions. The functional form gives a remarkably accurate\ndescription of the dielectric constant for a variety of salts and a wide range\nof concentrations.\n", "  In this paper, we will try to find out the relationship between separating\nand cyclic vectors in the theory of von Neumann algebra and entangled states in\nthe theory of quantum information. The corresponding physical interpretation is\npresented as well.\n", "  A simple exposition of the rarely discussed fact that a set of free boson\nfields describing different, i.e. kinematically different particle types can be\nquantized with mutual anticommutation relations is given by the explicit\nconstruction of the Klein transformations changing anticommutation relations\ninto commutation relations. The q-analog of the presented results is also\ntreated. The analogous situation for two independent free fermion fields with\nmutual commutation or anticommutation relations is briefly investigated.\n", "  It is well-known that maximally entangled states such as the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, with the Bell states as the simplest\nexamples, are widely exploited in quantum information and computation. We study\nthe application of such maximally entangled states from the viewpoint of the\nGHZ transform, which is a unitary basis transformation from the product states\nto the GHZ states. The algebraic structure of the GHZ transform is made clear\nand representative examples for it are verified as multi-qubit Clifford gates.\nIn this paper, we focus on the Bell transform as the simplest example of the\nGHZ transform and apply it to the reformulation of quantum circuit model of\nteleportation and the reformulation of the fault-tolerant construction of\nsingle-qubit gates and two-qubit gates in teleportation-based quantum\ncomputation. We clearly show that there exists a natural algebraic structure\ncalled the teleportation operator in terms of the Bell transform to catch\nessential points of quantum teleportation, and hence we expect that there would\nalso exist interesting algebraic structures in terms of the GHZ transform to\nplay important roles in quantum information and computation.\n", "  Using direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection (RBC),\nwe perform a comparative study of the spectra and fluxes of energy and entropy,\nand the scaling of large-scale quantities for large and infinite Prandtl\nnumbers in two (2D) and three (3D) dimensions. We observe close similarities\nbetween the 2D and 3D RBC, in particular the kinetic energy spectrum $E_u(k)\n\\sim k^{-13/3}$, and the entropy spectrum exhibits a dual branch with a\ndominant $k^{-2}$ spectrum. We showed that the dominant Fourier modes in the 2D\nand 3D flows are very close. Consequently, the 3D RBC is quasi two-dimensional,\nwhich is the reason for the similarities between the 2D and 3D RBC for large-\nand infinite Prandtl numbers.\n", "  There is an increasing interest in accurate dark matter relic density\npredictions, which requires next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations. The\nmethod applied up to now uses zero-temperature NLO calculations of annihilation\ncross sections in the standard Boltzmann equation for freeze-out, and is\nconceptually problematic, since it ignores the finite-temperature infrared (IR)\ndivergences from soft and collinear radiation and virtual effects. We address\nthis problem systematically by starting from non-equilibrium quantum field\ntheory, and demonstrate on a realistic model that soft and collinear\ntemperature-dependent divergences cancel in the collision term. Our analysis\nprovides justification for the use of the freeze-out equation in its\nconventional form and determines the leading finite-temperature correction to\nthe annihilation cross section. This turns out to have a remarkably simple\nstructure.\n", "  We present a characterization of short-term stability of random Boolean\nnetworks under \\emph{arbitrary} distributions of transfer functions. Given any\ndistribution of transfer functions for a random Boolean network, we present a\nformula that decides whether short-term chaos (damage spreading) will happen.\nWe provide a formal proof for this formula, and empirically show that its\npredictions are accurate. Previous work only works for special cases of\nbalanced families. It has been observed that these characterizations fail for\nunbalanced families, yet such families are widespread in real biological\nnetworks.\n", "  In this work, we describe a method to realize 3D Weyl semimetal by coupling\nmultilayers of honeycomb optical lattice in the presence of a pair of Raman\nlasers. The Raman lasers render each isolated honeycomb layer a Chern\ninsulator. With finite interlayer coupling, the bulk gap of the system closes\nat certain out-of-plane momenta due to Raman assisted tunnelling and result in\nthe Weyl semimetal phase. Using experimentally relevant parameters, we show\nthat both one and two pairs of Weyl points can be realized by tuning the\ninterlayer coupling strength. We suggest that Landau-Zener tunnelling can be\nused to detect Weyl points and show that the transition probability increases\ndramatically when Weyl point emerges. The realization of chiral anomaly by\nusing a magnetic field gradient is also discussed.\n", "  The recent measurements of temperature and polarization of Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) have improved our understanding of the Universe and are in\nremarkable agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. However, scale\ndependent features like power suppression in the angular power spectrum and\nCosmic Hemispherical Asymmetry (CHA) in the temperature field of CMB at large\nangular scales, hinting at possible departure from the $\\Lambda$CDM model\npersist in the CMB data. In this paper we present a physical mechanism linked\nto possible initial inhomogeneities in the inflationary scalar field that could\ngenerate CHA in both scalar and tensor sector within the frame work of single\nfield inflationary model with an initial fast-roll phase. The modulation\namplitude of CHA in both scalar and tensor perturbations are related and depend\nupon the initial shape of the inflaton potential. By using the observed value\nof CHA and obeying the isotropy of the temperature field of CMB, we obtain the\ntheoretical upper bound on the amplitude of CHA for tensor perturbations within\nthe framework of single field initial fast roll inflation models. The bound\nindicates that a maximum of $0.05\\%$ modulation in tensor sector is possible\nand hence within the measurability of future mission, tensor perturbations\nshould be statistically isotropic.\n", "  A calculation of the melting temperatures of heavy quarkonium states with the\nholographic potential was introduced in a previous work. In this paper, we\nconsider the holographic potential at sub-leading order, which permits finite\ncoupling corrections to be taken into account. It is found that this correction\nlowers the dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonium.\n", "  We investigate the universe evolution from inflation to late-time\nacceleration in a unified way, using a two-component fluid constituted from\nextended Chaplygin gas alongside a phantom scalar field. We extract solutions\nfor the various cosmological eras, focusing on the behavior of the scale\nfactor, the various density parameters and the equation-of-state parameter.\nFurthermore, we extract and discuss bouncing solutions. Finally, we examine the\nperturbations of the model, ensuring about their stability and extracting the\npredictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  Like ants, some microorganisms are known to leave trails on surfaces to\ncommunicate. We explore how trail-mediated self-interaction could affect the\nbehavior of individual microorganisms when diffusive spreading of the trail is\nnegligible on the timescale of the microorganism using a simple\nphenomenological model for an actively moving particle and a finite-width\ntrail. The effective dynamics of each microorganism takes on the form of a\nstochastic integral equation with the trail interaction appearing in the form\nof short-term memory. For moderate coupling strength below an emergent critical\nvalue, the dynamics exhibits effective diffusion in both orientation and\nposition after a phase of superdiffusive reorientation. We report experimental\nverification of a seemingly counterintuitive perpendicular alignment mechanism\nthat emerges from the model.\n", "  The notion of a part of phase space containing desired (or allowed) states of\na dynamical system is important in a wide range of complex systems research. It\nhas been called the safe operating space, the viability kernel or the sunny\nregion. In this paper we define the notion of survivability: Given a random\ninitial condition, what is the likelihood that the transient behaviour of a\ndeterministic system does not leave a region of desirable states. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this novel stability measure by considering models\nfrom climate science, neuronal networks and power grids. We also show that a\nsemi-analytic lower bound for the survivability of linear systems allows a\nnumerically very efficient survivability analysis in realistic models of power\ngrids. Our numerical and semi-analytic work underlines that the type of\nstability measured by survivability is not captured by common asymptotic\nstability measures.\n", "  In this article, we have analysed the behaviour of scalar field and\ncosmological constant in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. Here, we have considered\nthe simplest form of $f(R,T)$ i.e. $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$, where $R$ is the Ricci\nscalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy momentum tensor and explored the\nspatially homogeneous and anisotropic Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS)\nBianchi type-I cosmological model. It is assumed that the Universe is filled\nwith two non-interacting matter sources namely scalar field (normal or phantom)\nwith scalar potential and matter contribution due to $f(R,T)$ action. We have\ndiscussed two cosmological models according to power law and exponential law of\nthe volume expansion along with constant and exponential scalar potential as\nsub models. Power law models are compatible with normal (quintessence) and\nphantom scalar field whereas exponential volume expansion models are compatible\nwith only normal (quintessence) scalar field. The values of cosmological\nconstant in our models are in agreement with the observational results.\nFinally, we have discussed some physical and kinematical properties of both the\nmodels.\n", "  A new class of cost functionals for optimal control of quantum systems which\nproduces controls which are sparse in frequency and smooth in time is proposed.\nThis is achieved by penalizing a suitable time-frequency representation of the\ncontrol field, rather than the control field itself, and by employing norms\nwhich are of $L^1$ or measure form with respect to frequency but smooth with\nrespect to time.\n  We prove existence of optimal controls for the resulting nonsmooth\noptimization problem, derive necessary optimality conditions, and rigorously\nestablish the frequency-sparsity of the optimizers. More precisely, we show\nthat the time-frequency representation of the control field, which a priori\nadmits a continuum of frequencies, is supported on only \\textit{ finitely many}\nfrequencies.\n  These results cover important systems of physical interest, including\n(infinite-dimensional) Schr\\\"odinger dynamics on multiple potential energy\nsurfaces as arising in laser control of chemical reactions. Numerical\nsimulations confirm that the optimal controls, unlike those obtained with the\nusual $L^2$ costs, concentrate on just a few frequencies, even in the\ninfinite-dimensional case of laser-controlled chemical reactions.\n", "  Dephasing and relaxation of the nuclear spins coupled to the nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) center during optical initialization and readout is an important issue for\nvarious applications of this hybrid quantum register. Here we present both an\nanalytical description and a numerical simulation for this process, which agree\nreasonably with the experimental measurements. For the NV center under cyclic\noptical transition, our analytical formula not only provide a clear physics\npicture, but also allows controlling the nuclear spin dissipation by tuning an\nexternal magnetic field. For more general optical pumping, our analytical\nformula reveals significant contribution to the nuclear spin dissipation due to\nelectron random hopping into/out of the $m=0$ (or $m=\\pm1$) subspace. This\ncontribution is not suppressed even under saturated optical pumping and/or\nvanishing magnetic field, thus providing a possible solution to the puzzling\nobservation of nuclear spin dephasing in zero perpendicular magnetic field [M.\nV. G. Dutt \\textit{et al}., Science \\textbf{316}, 1312 (2007)]. It also implies\nthat enhancing the degree of spin polarization of the nitrogen-vacancy center\ncan reduce the effect of optical induced nuclear spin dissipation.\n", "  We propose a method of detecting non-self-correcting information cascades in\nexperiments in which subjects choose an option sequentially by observing the\nchoices of previous subjects. The method uses the correlation function $C(t)$\nbetween the first and the $t+1$-th subject's choices. $C(t)$ measures the\nstrength of the domino effect, and the limit value $c\\equiv \\lim_{t\\to\n\\infty}C(t)$ determines whether the domino effect lasts forever $(c>0)$ or not\n$(c=0)$. The condition $c>0$ is an adequate condition for a non-self-correcting\nsystem, and the probability that the majority's choice remains wrong in the\nlimit $t\\to \\infty$ is positive. We apply the method to data from two\nexperiments in which $T$ subjects answered two-choice questions: (i) general\nknowledge questions ($T_{avg}=60$) and (ii) urn-choice questions ($T=63$). We\nfind $c>0$ for difficult questions in (i) and all cases in (ii), and the\nsystems are not self-correcting.\n", "  Enhancing the polarization of nuclear spins surrounding the nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) center in diamond has attracted widespread attention recently due to its\nvarious applications. Here we present an analytical theory and comprehensive\nunderstanding on how to optimize the dynamic nuclear polarization by an\noptically pumped NV center near the ground state level anticrossing. Our\nresults not only provide a parameter-free explanation and a clearly physics\npicture for the recently observed polarization dependence on the magnetic field\nfor strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclei [H. J. Wang \\textit{et al}., Nat. Commun.\n4, 1 (2013)], but also demonstrate the possibility to strongly polarize weakly\ncoupled $^{13}$C nuclei under weak optical pumping and suitably chosen magnetic\nfield. This allows sensitive magnetic control of the $^{13}$C nuclear spin\npolarization for NMR applications and significant suppression of the $^{13}$C\nnuclear spin noise to prolong the NV spin coherence time.\n", "  Quantum repeaters rely on an interfacing of flying qubits with quantum\nmemories. The most common implementations include a narrowband single photon\nmatched in bandwidth and central frequency to an atomic system. Previously, we\ndemonstrated the compatibility of our versatile source of heralded single\nphotons, which is based on parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant\nwhispering-gallery mode resonator, with alkaline transitions [Schunk et al.,\nOptica 2, 773 (2015)]. In this paper, we analyze our source in terms of phase\nmatching, available wavelength-tuning mechanisms, and applications to\nnarrow-band atomic systems. We resonantly address the D1 transitions of cesium\nand rubidium with this optical parametric oscillator pumped above its\noscillation threshold. Below threshold, the efficient coupling of single\nphotons to atomic transitions heralded by single telecom-band photons is\ndemonstrated. Finally, we present an accurate analytical description of our\nobservations. Providing the demonstrated flexibility in connecting various\natomic transitions with telecom wavelengths, we show a promising approach to\nrealize an essential building block for quantum repeaters.\n", "  We carry out constant volume simulations of steady-state, shear driven,\nrheology in a simple model of bidisperse, soft-core, frictionless disks in two\ndimensions, using a dissipation law that gives rise to Bagnoldian rheology. We\ncarry out a detailed critical scaling analysis of our resulting data for\npressure $p$ and shear stress $\\sigma$, in order to determine the critical\nexponent $\\beta$ that describes the algebraic divergence of the Bagnold\ntransport coefficients, as the jamming transition is approached from below. We\nshow that it is necessary, for the strain rates considered in this work, to\nconsider the leading correction-to-scaling term in order to achieve a\nself-consistent analysis of our data. Our resulting value $\\beta\\approx 5.0\\pm\n0.4$ is clearly larger than the theoretical prediction by Otsuki and Hayakawa,\nand is consistent with earlier numerical results by Peyneau and Roux, and\nrecent theoretical predictions by DeGiuli et al. We have also considered the\nmacroscopic friction $\\mu\\equiv \\sigma/p$ and similarly find results consistent\nwith Peyneau and Roux, and with DeGiuli et al. Our results confirm that the\nshear driven jamming transition in Bagnoldian systems is well described by a\ncritical scaling theory (as was found previously for Newtonian systems), and we\nrelate this scaling theory to the phenomenological constituent laws for\ndilatancy and friction.\n", "  We examine the results of Chiral Effective Field Theory ($\\chi$EFT) for the\nscalar- and spin-dipole polarisabilities of the proton and neutron, both for\nthe physical pion mass and as a function of $m_\\pi$. This provides chiral\nextrapolations for lattice-QCD polarisability computations. We include both the\nleading and sub-leading effects of the nucleon's pion cloud, as well as the\nleading ones of the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance and its pion cloud. The analytic\nresults are complete at N$^2$LO in the $\\delta$-counting for pion masses close\nto the physical value, and at leading order for pion masses similar to the\nDelta-nucleon mass splitting. In order to quantify the truncation error of our\npredictions and fits as $68$\\% degree-of-belief intervals, we use a Bayesian\nprocedure recently adapted to EFT expansions. At the physical point, our\npredictions for the spin polarisabilities are, within respective errors, in\ngood agreement with alternative extractions using experiments and\ndispersion-relation theory. At larger pion masses we find that the chiral\nexpansion of all polarisabilities becomes intrinsically unreliable as $m_\\pi$\napproaches about $300\\;$MeV---as has already been seen in other observables.\n$\\chi$EFT also predicts a substantial isospin splitting above the physical\npoint for both the electric and magnetic scalar polarisabilities; and we\nspeculate on the impact this has on the stability of nucleons. Our results\nagree very well with emerging lattice computations in the realm where $\\chi$EFT\nconverges. Curiously, for the central values of some of our predictions, this\nagreement persists to much higher pion masses. We speculate on whether this\nmight be more than a fortuitous coincidence.\n", "  Loop-erased random walk and it's scaling limit, Schramm--Loewner evolution,\nhave found numerous applications in mathematics and physics. We present a 2\ndimensional analogue of LERW, the loop erased random surface. We do this by\ndefining a 2 dimensional spanning tree and declaring that LERS should have the\nsame relation to these 2 trees as LERW has to ordinary spanning trees.\nFurthermore we present numerical evidence that the growth rate for LERS on a\n$\\delta$ fine grid as $\\delta \\to 0$ is $2.5269 \\pm 0.0017$ and we hypothesize\nthat it has an exact value of 48/19. This suggests the possibility of a fractal\nlimiting object for LERS analogous to SLE for LERW.\n", "  We have measured the scattering strength of charged impurities on a\nsemiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube with known chirality. The\nresistivity of the nanotube is measured as a function of the density of\nadsorbed potassium atoms, enabling the determination of the resistance added by\nan individual potassium atom. Holes are scattered 37 times more efficiently\nthan electrons by an adsorbed potassium atom. The determined scattering\nstrength is used to reveal the spatial extent and depth of the scattering\npotential for potassium, a model Coulomb adsorbate. Our result represents an\nessential experimental input to understand adsorbate-induced scattering and\nprovides a crucial step for paving the way to rational design of nanotube-based\nsensors.\n", "  We construct small-x evolution equations which can be used to calculate quark\nand anti-quark helicity TMDs and PDFs, along with the $g_1$ structure function.\nThese evolution equations resum powers of $\\alpha_s \\, \\ln^2 (1/x)$ in the\npolarization-dependent evolution along with the powers of $\\alpha_s \\, \\ln\n(1/x)$ in the unpolarized evolution which includes saturation effects. The\nequations are written in an operator form in terms of polarization-dependent\nWilson line-like operators. While the equations do not close in general, they\nbecome closed and self-contained systems of non-linear equations in the\nlarge-$N_c$ and large-$N_c \\, \\& \\, N_f$ limits. As a cross-check, in the\nladder approximation, our equations map onto the same ladder limit of the\ninfrared evolution equations for $g_1$ structure function derived previously by\nBartels, Ermolaev and Ryskin.\n", "  We summarise the results of our recent paper (arXiv:1511.08737) highlighting\nwhat might be considered to be a Lie-algebraic derivation of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity.\n", "  We predict the electrical generation and injection of domain walls into a\nferromagnetic nano-wire without the need of an assisting magnetic field. Our\ntheory shows that above a critical current $j_{c}$ domain walls are injected\ninto the nano-wire with a period $T\\sim (j-j_{c})^{-1/2}$. In a uniaxial\nanisotropy geometry this process does not require Dzyaloshinskii-Moria or\ndipole-dipole interaction and can be done in a simple exchange ferromagnet. We\nalso show that this process and the period exponents are universal and do not\ndepend on the peculiarities of the microscopic Hamiltonian.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations of baryon forces are performed for the first time\nwith (almost) physical quark masses. $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical clover fermion gauge\nconfigurations are generated at the lattice spacing of $a \\simeq 0.085$ fm on a\n$(96 a)^4 \\simeq (8.2 {\\rm fm})^4$ lattice with quark masses corresponding to\n$(m_\\pi, m_K) \\simeq (146, 525)$ MeV. Baryon forces are calculated using the\ntime-dependent HAL QCD method. In this report, we study $\\Xi\\Xi$ and $NN$\nsystems both in $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ channels, and the results for the\ncentral and tensor forces as well as phase shifts in the $\\Xi\\Xi$ $(^1S_0)$\nchannel are presented.\n", "  Next-generation electronics calls for new materials beyond silicon for\nincreased functionality, performance, and scaling in integrated circuits.\nCarbon nanotubes and semiconductor nanowires are at the forefront of these\nmaterials, but have challenges due to the complex fabrication techniques\nrequired for large-scale applications. Two-dimensional (2D) gapless graphene\nand semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as\npromising electronic materials due to their atomic thickness, chemical\nstability and scalability. Difficulties in the assembly of 2D electronic\nstructures arise in the precise spatial control over the metallic and\nsemiconducting atomic thin films. Ultimately, this impedes the maturity of\nintegrating atomic elements in modern electronics. Here, we report the\nlarge-scale spatially controlled synthesis of the single-layer semiconductor\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) laterally in contact with conductive graphene.\nTransition electron microscope (TEM) studies reveal that the single-layer MoS2\nnucleates at the edge of the graphene, creating a lateral 2D heterostructure.\nWe demonstrate such chemically assembled 2D atomic transistors exhibit high\ntransconductance (10 uS), on-off ratios (10^6), and mobility (20 cm^2 V^-1\ns^-1). We assemble 2D logic circuits, such as a heterostructure NMOS inverter\nwith a high voltage gain, up to 70, enabled by the precise site selectivity\nfrom atomically thin conducting and semiconducting crystals. This scalable\nchemical assembly of 2D heterostructures may usher in a new era in\ntwo-dimensional electronic circuitry and computing.\n", "  We consider the radiative generation of neutrino mass through the\ninteractions of neutrinos with MeV dark matter. We construct a realistic\nrenormalizable model with one scalar doublet and one complex singlet together\nwith three light singlet Majorana fermions, all transforming under a dark U(1)\nsymmetry which breaks softly to Z_2. We study in detail the scalar sector which\nsupports this specific scenario and its rich phenomenology.\n", "  A calculation of the $R^2$ corrections to the jet quenching parameter from\nAdS/CFT correspondence is presented. These corrections are related to\ncurvature-squared corrections in the corresponding gravity dual. It is shown\nthat the corrections will increase or decrease the jet quenching parameter\ndepending on the coefficients of the high curvature terms.\n", "  Abrupt transitions are ubiquitous in the dynamics of complex systems. Finding\nprecursors, i.e. early indicators of their arrival, is fundamental in many\nareas of science ranging from electrical engineering to climate. However,\nobtaining warnings of an approaching transition well in advance remains an\nelusive task. Here we show that a functional network, constructed from spatial\ncorrelations of the system's time series, experiences a percolation transition\nway before the actual system reaches a bifurcation point due to the collective\nphenomena leading to the global change. Concepts from percolation theory are\nthen used to introduce early warning precursors that anticipate the system's\ntipping point. We illustrate the generality and versatility of our\npercolation-based framework with model systems experiencing different types of\nbifurcations and with Sea Surface Temperature time series associated to El Nino\nphenomenon.\n", "  Numerical data on scaling of the normalized Binder cumulant and the\nnormalized correlation length are shown for the Thermodynamic limit regime,\nfirst for canonical Ising ferromagnet models and then for a range of Ising spin\nglass models. A fundamental Renormalization Group Theory rule linking the\ncritical exponents for the two observables is well obeyed in the Ising models,\nbut not for the Ising spin glasses in dimensions three and four. We conclude\nthat there is a violation of a standard Josephson hyperscaling rule in Ising\nspin glasses.\n", "  All-organic-based photovoltaic solar cells have attracted considerable\nattention because of their low-cost processing and short energy payback time.\nIn such systems the primary dissociation of an optical excitation into a pair\nof photocarriers has been recently shown to be extremely rapid and efficient,\nbut the physical reason for this remains unclear. Here, two-dimensional\nphotocurrent excitation spectroscopy, a novel non-linear optical spectroscopy,\nis used to probe the ultrafast coherent decay of photoexcitations into\ncharge-producing states in a polymer:fullerene based solar cell. The\ntwo-dimensional photocurrent spectra are interpreted by introducing a\ntheoretical model for the description of the coupling of the electronic states\nof the system to an external environment and to the applied laser fields. The\nexperimental data show no cross-peaks in the two-dimensional photocurrent\nspectra, as predicted by the model for coherence times between the exciton and\nthe photocurrent producing states of 20\\,fs or less.\n", "  It is common knowledge that the Einstein-Hilbert action does not furnish a\nwell-posed variational principle. The usual solution to this problem is to add\nan extra boundary term to the action, called a counter-term, so that the\nvariational principle becomes well-posed. When the boundary is spacelike or\ntimelike, the Gibbons-Hawking-York counter-term is the most widely used. For\nnull boundaries, we had proposed a counter-term in a previous paper. In this\npaper, we extend the previous analysis and propose a counter-term that can be\nused to eliminate variations of the \"off-the-surface\" derivatives of the metric\non any boundary, regardless of its spacelike, timelike or null nature.\n", "  We prove that the force sensitivity of the conventional optomechanical\ndetector associated with the optical quadrature measurement of the output beam\nis lower bounded by the so-called ultimate quantum limit (UQL), i.e., the\nabsolute value of the imaginary part of the inverse mechanical susceptibility.\nThrough the linear response theory, we find that the force sensitivity of any\nlinear detector is lower bounded by a generalized UQL, which might beat the\nusual UQL by properly tailoring the detector-oscillator interaction. We believe\nthat our results open a new direction for improving the performance of\nhigh-sensitivity detection schemes.\n", "  Radio relics are Mpc-scale diffuse radio sources at the peripheries of galaxy\nclusters which are thought to trace outgoing merger shocks. We present\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z=0.306),\nwhich reveal the presence of a shock front 1.5 Mpc East of the cluster core.\nThe surface-brightness jump coincides with the position of a known radio relic.\nAlthough the surface-brightness jump indicates a weak shock with a Mach number\n$\\mathcal{M}=1.7_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$, the plasma in the post-shock region has been\nheated to a very high temperature ($\\sim13$ keV) by the passage of the shock\nwave. The low acceleration efficiency expected from such a weak shock suggests\nthat mildly relativistic electrons have been re-accelerated by the passage of\nthe shock front.\n", "  In his pioneering work on negative specific heat, Walter Thirring\nin\\-tro\\-duced a model that is solvable in the microcanonical ensemble. Here,\nwe give a complete description of the phase-diagram of this model in both the\nmicrocanonical and the canonical ensemble, highlighting the main features of\nensemble inequivalence. In both ensembles, we find a line of first-order phase\ntransitions which ends in a critical point. However, neither the line nor the\npoint have the same location in the phase-diagram of the two ensembles. We also\nshow that the microcanonical and canonical critical points can be analytically\nrelated to each other using a Landau expansion of entropy and free energy,\nrespectively, in analogy with what has been done in [O. Cohen, D. Mukamel, J.\nStat. Mech., P12017 (2012)]. Examples of systems with certain symmetries\nrestricting the Landau expansion have been considered in this reference, while\nno such restrictions are present in Thirring's model. This leads to a phase\ndiagram that can be seen as a prototype for what happens in systems of\nparticles with kinematic degrees of freedom dominated by long-range\ninteractions.\n", "  Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum\ninformation applications due to their bright single photon emission and\noptically accessible spin states. Furthermore, SiV centers in low-strain\ndiamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e.\nthey show very weak spectral diffusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV\ncenters interesting for sensing applications. We here report on\nphotoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy on an SiV ensemble in a low\nstrain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure the fine\nstructure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the\nSiV centers. We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and\nposition of the fine structure peaks. Our measurements reveal linewidths of\nabout 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on the order of 0.1 GHz.\nThis difference arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions\ncaused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral\nhole burning spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited\nhomogeneous linewidth of 279 MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of\ncoherent interaction in the system by driving a $\\Lambda$-scheme. Additional\nmeasurements on single emitters created by ion implantation confirm the\nhomogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate\nthe ground state splitting to the decoherence rate.\n", "  Recent studies have focused on laser-induced gaps in graphene which have been\nshown to have a topological origin, thereby hosting robust states at the sample\nedges. While the focus has remained mainly on these topological chiral edge\nstates, the Floquet bound states around defects lack a detailed study. In this\npaper we present such a study covering large defects of different shape and\nalso vacancy-like defects and adatoms at the dynamical gap at $\\hbar\\Omega/2$\n($\\hbar\\Omega$ being the photon energy). Our results, based on analytical\ncalculations as well as numerics for full tight-binding models, show that the\nbound states are chiral and appear in a number which grows with the defect\nsize. Furthermore, while the bound states exist regardless the type of the\ndefect's edge termination (zigzag, armchair, mixed), the spectrum is strongly\ndependent on it. In the case of top adatoms, the bound states quasi-energies\ndepend on the adatoms energy. The appearance of such bound states might open\nthe door to the presence of topological effects on the bulk transport\nproperties of dirty graphene.\n", "  The recent announcement of the detection of gravitational waves by the\nLIGO/Virgo collaboration has opened a new window to test the nature of\nastrophysical black holes. Konoplya & Zhidenko have shown how the LIGO data of\nGW 150914 can constrain possible deviations from the Kerr metric. In this\nletter, we compare their constraints with those that can be obtained from\naccreting black holes by fitting their reflected X-ray spectrum, the so-called\niron line method. We simulate observations with eXTP, a next generation X-ray\nmission, finding constraints much stronger than those obtained by Konoplya &\nZhidenko. Our results can at least show that, contrary to what is quite\ncommonly believed, it is not obvious that gravitational waves are the most\npowerful approach to test strong gravity. In the presence of high quality data\nand with the systematics under control, the iron line method may provide\ncompetitive constraints.\n", "  In earlier works, it was shown that the energy dependent soft time lags\nobserved in kHz QPOs of neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can be\nexplained as being due to Comptonization lags provided a significant fraction\n($\\eta \\sim 0.2$ - $0.8$) of the Comptonized photons impinge back into the soft\nphoton source. Here we use a Monte Carlo scheme to verify if such a fraction is\nviable or not. In particular we consider three different Comptonizing medium\ngeometries: (i) a spherical shell, (ii) a boundary layer like torus and (iii) a\ncorona on top of an accretion disk. Two set of spectral parameters\ncorresponding to the 'hot' and 'cold' seed photon models were explored. The\ngeneral result of the study is that for a wide range of sizes, the fraction\nlies within $\\eta \\sim 0.3$ - $0.7$, and hence compatible with the range\nrequired to explain the soft time lags. Since there is a large uncertainty in\nthe range, we cannot concretely rule out any of the geometries or spectral\nmodels, but the analysis suggests that a boundary layer type geometry with a\n'cold' seed spectral model is favoured over an accretion corona model. Better\nquality data will allow one to constrain the geometry more rigorously. Our\nresults emphasise that there is significant heating of the soft photon source\nby the Comptonized photons and hence this effect needs to be taken into account\nfor any detailed study of these sources.\n", "  We consider the particle-antiparticle pairs produced by both a strong\nelectric field and de Sitter curvature. We investigate in 1 + 1 D the\nbackreaction of the pairs on the electromagnetic field. To do so we describe\nthe canonical quantization of an electromagnetic field in de Sitter space and\nadd in the Einstein-Maxwell equation the fermionic current induced by the\npairs. After solving this equation, we find that the electric field gets either\ndamped or unaffected depending on the value of the pair mass and the gauge\ncoupling. No enhancement of the electromagnetic field to support a\nmagnetogenesis scenario is found. The physical picture is that the Schwinger\npairs locally created screen the production and amplification of the\nelectromagnetic field. However, if one considers light bosons created by the\nSchwinger mechanism, we report a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equation with\nan enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This solution could be a new path\nto primordial magnetogenesis.\n", "  The domain wall depinning from a notch in a Permalloy nanostrip on top of a\n${\\rm SiO_2/Si}$ substrate is studied theoretically under application of static\nmagnetic fields and the injection of short current pulses. The influence of\nJoule heating on current-induced domain wall depinning is explored\nself-consistently by coupling the magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnetic\nstrip to the heat transport throughout the system. Our results indicate that\nJoule heating plays a remarkable role in these processes, resulting in a\nreduction in the critical depinning field and/or in a temporary destruction of\nthe ferromagnetic order for typically injected current pulses. In agreement\nwith experimental observations, similar pinning-depinning phase diagrams can be\ndeduced for both current polarities when the Joule heating is taken into\naccount. These observations, which are incompatible with the sole contribution\nof spin transfer torques, provide a deeper understanding of the physics\nunderlying these processes and establish the real scope of the spin transfer\ntorque. They are also relevant for technological applications based on\ncurrent-induced domain-wall motion along soft strips.\n", "  The decimal logarithm of spontaneous fission half-life of the superheavy\nnucleus $^{286}$Fl experimentally determined is $\\log_{10} T_f^{exp} (s) =\n-0.632$. We present a method to calculate the half-life based on the cranking\ninertia and the deformation energy, functions of two independent surface\ncoordinates, using the best asymmetric two center shell model. In the first\nstage we study the statics. At a given mass asymmetry up to about $\\eta=0.5$\nthe potential barrier has a two hump shape, but for larger $\\eta$ it has only\none hump. The touching point deformation energy versus mass asymmetry shows the\nthree minima, produced by shell effects, corresponding to three decay modes:\nspontaneous fission, cluster decay and $\\alpha$~decay. The least action\ntrajectory is determined in the plane $(R,\\eta)$ where $R$ is the separation\ndistance of the fission fragments and $\\eta$ is the mass asymmetry. We may find\na sequence of several trajectories one of which gives the least action. The\nparametrization with two deformation coordinates $(R,\\eta)$ and the radius of\nthe light fragment, $R_2$, exponentially decreasing with $R$ is compared with\nthe simpler one, in which $R_2$~=constant. The latter is closer to the reality\nand reminds us about the alpha or cluster preformation at the nuclear surface.\n", "  In this note, I will review the opportunities offered by the hint of a new\nresonance observed at LHC for future e+e- TeV linear collider (LC) projects.\nThis discussion is mainly influenced by two specific scenarios of physics which\nassume either a (pseudo-)scalar or a tensor resonance, but these estimates can\nbe used in most scenarios. I envisage either a photon collider, which has a\nguaranteed signal with the LHC observation, or a standard e+e- collider, more\nstraightforward to implement. After a detailed study of the heavy graviton\nscenario, I conclude that at a TeV LC, high accuracy measurements, including\nrare modes, allow to unambiguously establish the origin of this resonance. Also\nenvisaged in some detail is a radion scenario which illustrates the production\nof a scalar. The role of an LC for precision measurements on Higgs and top\ncouplings is recalled in the context of the Randall Sundrum model.\n", "  We study scattering equations and formulas for tree amplitudes of various\ntheories in four dimensions, in terms of spinor helicity variables and on-shell\nsuperspace for supersymmetric theories. As originally obtained in Witten's\ntwistor string theory and other twistor-string models, the equations can take\neither polynomial or rational forms, and we clarify the simple relation between\nthem. We present new, four-dimensional formulas for all tree amplitudes in the\nnon-linear sigma model, a special Galileon theory and the maximally\nsupersymmetric completion of the Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. Furthermore, we\napply the formulas to study various double-soft theorems in these theories,\nincluding the emissions of a pair of soft photons, fermions and scalars for\nsuper-amplitudes in super-DBI theory.\n", "  We present anisotropic transport and optical spectroscopy studies on\nEuCd_2As_2. The measurements reveal that EuCd_2As_2 is a low carrier density\nsemimetal with moderate anisotropic resistivity ratio. The charge carriers\nexperience very strong scattering from Eu magnetic moments, resulting in a\nKondo-like increase of resistivity at low temperature. Below the\nantiferromagnetic transition temperature at $T_N$= 9.5 K, the resistivity drops\nsharply due to the reduced scattering from the ordered Eu moments.\nNevertheless, the anisotropic ratio of $\\rho_c/\\rho_{ab}$ keeps increasing,\nsuggesting that the antiferromagnetic coupling is along the c-axis. The optical\nspectroscopy measurement further reveals, besides an overdamped reflectance\nplasma edge at low energy, a strong coupling between phonon and electronic\ncontinuum. Our study suggests that EuCd_2As_2 is a promising candidate\ndisplaying intriguing interplay among charge, magnetism and the underlying\ncrystal lattice.\n", "  According to the second law of thermodynamics, for every transformation\nperformed on a system which is in contact with an environment of fixed\ntemperature, the extracted work is bounded by the decrease of the free energy\nof the system. However, in a single realization of a generic process, the\nextracted work is subject to statistical fluctuations which may allow for\nprobabilistic violations of the previous bound. We are interested in enhancing\nthis effect, i.e. we look for thermodynamic processes that maximize the\nprobability of extracting work above a given arbitrary threshold. For any\nprocess obeying the Jarzynski identity, we determine an upper bound for the\nwork extraction probability that depends also on the minimum amount of work\nthat we are willing to extract in case of failure, or on the average work we\nwish to extract from the system. Then we show that this bound can be saturated\nwithin the thermodynamic formalism of quantum discrete processes composed by\nsequences of unitary quenches and complete thermalizations. We explicitly\ndetermine the optimal protocol which is given by two quasi-static isothermal\ntransformations separated by a finite unitary quench.\n", "  We propose that the diphoton excess at 750 GeV reported by ATLAS and CMS is\ndue to the decay of an ${\\it exo-Higgs}$ scalar $\\eta$ associated with the\nbreaking of a new $SU(2)_e$ symmetry, dubbed ${\\it exo-spin}$. New fermions,\n${\\it exo-quarks}$ and ${\\it exo-leptons}$, get TeV-scale masses through Yukawa\ncouplings with $\\eta$ and generate its couplings to gluons and photons at\n1-loop. The matter content of our model yields a $B-L$ anomaly under $SU(2)_e$,\nwhose breaking we assume entails a first order phase transition. A non-trivial\n$B-L$ asymmetry may therefore be generated in the early universe, potentially\nproviding a baryogenesis mechanism through the Standard Model (SM) sphaleron\nprocesses. The spontaneous breaking of $SU(2)_e$ can in principle directly lead\nto electroweak symmetry breaking, thereby accounting for the proximity of the\nmass scales of the SM Higgs and the exo-Higgs. Our model can be distinguished\nfrom those comprising a singlet scalar and vector fermions by the discovery of\nTeV scale exo-vector bosons, corresponding to the broken $SU(2)_e$ generators,\nat the LHC.\n", "  By analyzing 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at $\\sqrt s=3.773$ GeV with the\nBESIII detector, we measure the absolute branching fraction ${\\mathcal\nB}(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})=(8.72 \\pm 0.07_{\\rm stat.} \\pm\n0.18_{\\rm sys.})\\%$, which is consistent with previous measurements within\nuncertainties but with significantly improved precision. Combining the Particle\nData Group values of ${\\mathcal B}(D^0\\to K^-\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)$, ${\\mathcal\nB}(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0 e^{+}\\nu_{e})$, and the lifetimes of the $D^0$ and\n$D^+$ mesons with the value of ${\\mathcal B}(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0\n\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})$ measured in this work, we determine the following ratios of\npartial widths: $\\Gamma(D^0\\to K^-\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)/\\Gamma(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar\nK^0\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})=0.963\\pm0.044$ and $\\Gamma(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0\n\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})/\\Gamma(D^{+}\\rightarrow\\bar K^0 e^{+}\\nu_{e})=0.988\\pm0.033$.\n", "  The notion of uniform and/or constant tensor fields of rank $>0$ is\nincompatible with general curved spacetimes. This work considers the\nconsequences of certain tensor-valued coefficients for Lorentz violation in the\nStandard-Model Extension varying with spacetime position. We focus on two of\nthe coefficients, $a_\\mu$ and $b_\\mu$, that characterize Lorentz violation in\nmassive fermions, particularly in those fermions that constitute ordinary\nmatter. We calculate the nonrelativistic hamiltonian describing these effects,\nand use it to extract the sensitivity of several precision experiments to\ncoefficient variation.\n", "  We study the transport properties of an impurity in a sheared granular gas,\nin the framework of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models. We\ninvestigate here the impact of a nonequilibrium phase transition found in such\nsystems, where the tracer species carries a finite fraction of the total\nkinetic energy (ordered phase). To this end, the diffusion coefficients are\nfirst obtained for a granular binary mixture in spatially inhomogeneous states\nclose to the simple shear flow. In this situation, the set of coupled Boltzmann\nequations are solved by means of a Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around the\n(local) shear flow distributions for each species, thereby retaining all the\nhydrodynamic orders in the shear rate $a$. Due to the anisotropy induced by the\nshear flow, three tensorial quantities $D_{ij}$, $D_{p,ij}$, and $D_{T,ij}$ are\nrequired to describe the mass transport process instead of the conventional\nscalar coefficients. These tensors are given in terms of the solutions of a set\nof coupled algebraic equations, which can be \\emph{exactly} solved as functions\nof the shear rate $a$, the coefficients of restitution $\\alpha_{sr}$ and the\nparameters of the mixture (masses and composition). Once the forms of $D_{ij}$,\n$D_{p,ij}$, and $D_{T,ij}$ are obtained for arbitrary mole fraction\n$x_1=n_1/(n_1+n_2)$ (where $n_r$ is the number density of species $r$), the\ntracer limit ($x_1\\to 0$) is carefully considered for the above three diffusion\ntensors. Explicit forms for these coefficients are derived showing that their\nshear rate dependence is significantly affected by the order-disorder\ntransition.\n", "  Recent technological developments in the field of experimental quantum\nannealing have made prototypical annealing optimizers with hundreds of qubits\ncommercially available. The experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for\noptimization problems has since then become a coveted, albeit elusive goal.\nRecent studies have shown that the so far inconclusive results, regarding a\nquantum enhancement, may have been partly due to the benchmark problems used\nbeing unsuitable. In particular, these problems had inherently too simple a\nstructure, allowing for both traditional resources and quantum annealers to\nsolve them with no special efforts. The need therefore has arisen for the\ngeneration of harder benchmarks which would hopefully possess the\ndiscriminative power to separate classical scaling of performance with size,\nfrom quantum. We introduce here a practical technique for the engineering of\nextremely hard spin glass Ising-type problem instances that does not require\n`cherry picking' from large ensembles of randomly generated instances. We\naccomplish this by treating the generation of hard optimization problems itself\nas an optimization problem, for which we offer a heuristic algorithm that\nsolves it. We demonstrate the genuine thermal hardness of our generated\ninstances by examining them thermodynamically and analyzing their energy\nlandscapes, as well as by testing the performance of various state-of-the art\nalgorithms on them. We argue that a proper characterization of the generated\ninstances offers a practical, efficient way to properly benchmark experimental\nquantum annealers, as well as any other optimization algorithm.\n", "  We use the fundamental-mode RR Lyr-type variable stars (RRab) from OGLE-IV\nsurvey to draw a 3D picture of the central part of the tidally disrupted\nSagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy. We estimate the line-of-sight\nthickness of the Sgr dSph stream to be FWHM_cen=2.42 kpc. Based on OGLE-IV\nobservations collected in seasons 2011-2014 we conduct a comprehensive study of\nstellar variability in the field of the globular cluster M54 (NGC 6715)\nresiding in the core of this dwarf galaxy. Among the total number of 268\ndetected variable stars we report the identification of 174 RR Lyr stars, four\nType II Cepheids, 51 semi-regular variable red giants, three SX Phe-type stars,\n18 eclipsing binary systems. Eighty-three variable stars are new discoveries.\nThe distance to the cluster determined from RRab stars is d_M54 = 26.7\n+/-0.03(stat) +/-1.3(sys) kpc. From the location of RRab stars in the\nperiod-amplitude (Bailey) diagram we confirm the presence of two old\npopulations, both in the cluster and the Sgr dSph stream.\n", "  Recent results have strongly confirmed that multiple supernovae happened at\ndistances ~100 pc consisting of two main events: one at 1.7 to 3.2 million\nyears ago, and the other at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. These events are said\nto be responsible for excavating the Local Bubble in the interstellar medium\nand depositing 60Fe on Earth and the Moon. Other events are indicated by\neffects in the local cosmic ray (CR) spectrum. Given this updated and refined\npicture, we ask whether such supernovae are expected to have had substantial\neffects on the terrestrial atmosphere and biota. In a first cut at the most\nprobable cases, combining photon and cosmic ray effects, we find that a\nsupernova at 100 pc can have only a small effect on terrestrial organisms from\nvisible light and that chemical changes such as ozone depletion are weak.\nHowever, tropospheric ionization right down to the ground due to the\npenetration of $\\geq$TeV cosmic rays will increase by nearly an order of\nmagnitude for thousands of years, and irradiation by muons on the ground and in\nthe upper ocean will increase 20-fold, which will approximately triple the\noverall radiation load on terrestrial organisms. Such irradiation has been\nlinked to possible changes in climate and increased cancer and mutation rates.\nThis may be related to a minor mass extinction around the Pliocene-Pleistocene\nboundary, and further research on the effects is needed.\n", "  The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely utilized to study\nnon-diffusive thermal transport. We find a solution of the BTE in the thin film\ntransient thermal grating (TTG) experimental geometry by using a recently\ndeveloped variational approach with a trial solution supplied by the Fourier\nheat conduction equation. We obtain an analytical expression for the thermal\ndecay rate that shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. We also\nobtain a closed form expression for the effective thermal conductivity that\ndemonstrates the full material property and heat transfer geometry dependence,\nand recovers the limits of the one-dimensional TTG expression for very thick\nfilms and the Fuchs-Sondheimer expression for very large grating spacings. The\nresults demonstrate the utility of the variational technique for analyzing\nnon-diffusive phonon-mediated heat transport for nanostructures in\nmulti-dimensional transport geometries, and will assist the probing of the mean\nfree path (MFP) distribution of materials via transient grating experiments.\n", "  The energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms are obtained from the phase-space\nquantization, one of the pillars of the old quantum theory, by three different\nmethods - (i) direct integration, (ii) Sommerfeld's original method, and (iii)\ncomplex integration. The difficulties come from the imposition of elliptical\norbits to the electron, resulting in a variable radial component of the linear\nmomentum. Details of the calculation, which constitute a recurrent gap in\ntextbooks that deal with phase-space quantization, are shown in depth in an\naccessible fashion for students of introductory quantum mechanics courses.\n", "  When a topological insulator (TI) is in contact with a ferromagnet, both time\nreversal and inversion symmetries are broken at the interface. An energy gap is\nformed at the TI surface, and its electrons gain a net magnetic moment through\nshort-range exchange interactions. Magnetic TIs can host various exotic quantum\nphenomena, such as massive Dirac fermions, Majorana fermions, the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect and chiral edge currents along the domain boundaries.\nHowever, selective measurement of induced magnetism at the buried interface has\nremained a challenge. Using magnetic second harmonic generation, we directly\nprobe both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetizations induced at the\ninterface between the ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) EuS and the\nthree-dimensional TI Bi2Se3. Our findings not only allow characterizing\nmagnetism at the TI-FMI interface but also lay the groundwork for imaging\nmagnetic domains and domain boundaries at the magnetic TI surfaces.\n", "  Thermodynamics on the cosmological apparent horizon of a flat\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric has been investigated with\nBekenstein entropy and Hawking temperature on the horizon, and Unruh\ntemperature for the fluid inside the horizon. This temperature is experienced\nby a radial comoving observer infinitesimally close to the horizon due to the\npressure exerted by the fluid bounded by the horizon. An expression for the\nentropy of the fluid has been obtained which is found to be proportional to the\nvolume of the thermodynamic system which implies that the Unruh temperature of\nthe fluid is inconsistent with the holographic principle. Further, we have been\nable to find an expression for the effective entropy of the system. Finally,\nassuming a barotropic equation of state $p=w\\rho$ ($w$ constant) for the fluid,\nit has been shown that the generalized second law holds good for a non-phantom\nw, while thermodynamic equilibrium is never possible for such a scenario.\n", "  We show for the classical Maxwell equations, including the axion\nelectromagnetic anomaly source term, that a cosmic axion field induces an\noscillating electric N-moment for any static magnetic N-moment. This is a\nstraightforward result, accessible to anyone who has taken a first year\ngraduate course in electrodynamics.\n", "  The dynamics of an elliptical galaxy within a couple of effective radii can\nbe probed effectively by stars. However, at larger distances planetary nebulae\n(PNe) replace stars as the tracer of the dynamics. Making use of the motion of\nPNe, Romanowsky et al. (2003) measured the dynamics of three luminous\nelliptical galaxies (NGC821, NGC3379, and NGC4494) at large distances from the\ngalactic center. They found that little dark matter is needed up to 6 effective\nradii. Milgrom & Sanders (2003) showed that this result can be understood in\nthe framework of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). As more data are available\nin the past decade, we revisit this problem. We combine PNe data (up to 6{8\neffective radii) and stellar data from SAURON of 7 elliptical galaxies,\nincluding those 3 galaxies in Romanowsky et al. (2003) with updated data and 4\nother galaxies which have not been analyzed before. We conclude that the\ndynamics of these galaxies can be well explained by MOND.\n", "  Although several multiferroic materials/heterostructures have been\nextensively studied, finding strong magnetoelectric couplings for the electric\nfield control of the magnetization remains challenging. Here, a novel\ninterfacial magnetoelectric coupling based on three components (ferroelectric\ndipole, magnetic moment, and antiferromagnetic order) is analytically\nformulated. As an extension of carrier-mediated magnetoelectricity, the new\ncoupling is shown to induce an electric-magnetic hysteresis loop. Realizations\nemploying BiFeO$_3$ bilayers grown along the [$111$] axis are proposed. Without\ninvolving magnetic phase transitions, the magnetization orientation can be\nswitched by the carrier modulation driven by the field effect, as confirmed\nusing first-principles calculations.\n", "  Graphene and its derivatives including hexagonal BN are notorious for their\nlarge negative thermal expansion over a wide range of temperature which is\nquite unusual. We attempt to analyze this unusual behavior on the basis of\ncharacter of the phonon modes. The linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTEC)\nof two-dimensional honeycomb structured pure graphene, h-BN and B/N doped\ngraphene are studied using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) under\nquasi harmonic approximation. The dynamical matrix and the phonon frequencies\nwere calculated using VASP code in interface with phonopy code. The approach is\nfirst applied to pure graphene to calculate thermal expansion. The results\nagree with earlier calculations using similar approach. Thereafter we have\nstudied the effect of B/N doping on LTEC and also compared it with LTEC of h-BN\nsheet. The LTEC of graphene is negative in the whole temperature range under\nstudy (0-1000K) with a room temperature (RT) value of -3.51X10-6K-1. The value\nof LTEC at room temperature becomes more negative with B/N doping in graphene\nas well as for h-BN sheet. In order to get an insight into the cause of\nnegative thermal expansion, we have computed the contribution of individual\nphonon modes of vibration. We notice that it is principally the ZA (transverse\nacoustic) mode which is responsible for negative thermal expansion. It has been\nconcluded that transverse mode in 2D hexagonal lattices have an important role\nto play in many of the thermo dynamical properties of 2D structures.\n", "  Motivated by the complex phase diagram of MnWO4, we investigate competition\nbetween anisotropy, magnetic field, and helicity for the anisotropic\nnext-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model. Apart from two competing exchanges,\nwhich favor a spiral magnetic structure, the model features the bi-axial\nsingle-ion anisotropy. The model is treated in the real-space mean-field\napproximation and the phase diagram containing various incommensurate and\ncommensurate states is obtained for different field orientations. We discuss\nsimilarities and differences of the theoretical phase diagram and the\nexperimental diagram of MnWO4.\n", "  The temperature-pressure phase diagram of the ferromagnet LaCrGe$_3$ is\ndetermined for the first time from a combination of magnetization,\nmuon-spin-rotation and electrical resistivity measurements. The ferromagnetic\nphase is suppressed near $2.1$~GPa, but quantum criticality is avoided by the\nappearance of a magnetic phase, likely modulated, AFM$_Q$. Our density\nfunctional theory total energy calculations suggest a near degeneracy of\nantiferromagnetic states with small magnetic wave vectors $Q$ allowing for the\npotential of an ordering wave vector evolving from $Q=0$ to finite $Q$, as\nexpected from the most recent theories on ferromagnetic quantum criticality.\nOur findings show that LaCrGe$_3$ is a very simple example to study this\nscenario of avoided ferromagnetic quantum criticality and will inspire further\nstudy on this material and other itinerant ferromagnets.\n", "  Here we present polarized neutron reflectometry measurements exploring thin\nfilm heterostructures comprised of a strongly correlated Mott state, GdTiO$_3$,\nembedded with SrTiO$_3$ quantum wells. Our results reveal that the net\nferromagnetism inherent to the Mott GdTiO$_3$ matrix propagates into the\nnominally nonmagnetic SrTiO$_3$ quantum wells and tracks the magnetic order\nparameter of the host Mott insulating matrix. Beyond a well thickness of 5 SrO\nlayers, the magnetic moment within the wells is dramatically suppressed,\nsuggesting that quenched well magnetism comprises the likely origin of quantum\ncritical magnetotransport in this thin film architecture. Our data demonstrate\nthat the interplay between proximate exchange fields and polarity induced\ncarrier densities can stabilize extended magnetic states within SrTiO$_3$\nquantum wells.\n", "  This thesis determines some of the implications of non-universal and emergent\nuniversal statistics on arithmetic correlations and fluctuations of arithmetic\nfunctions, in particular correlations amongst prime numbers and the variance of\nthe expected number of prime numbers over short intervals are generalised by\nassociating these concepts to $L$-functions arising from number theoretic\nobjects.\n", "  By means of first-principles calculations, we predict a new 2D QSH insulator\nin the porous allotrope of Bismuth monolayer, bismuthylene, its dynamics\nstability being confirmed by phonon spectrum and molecular dynamics\nsimulations. The analyses of electronic structures reveal that it is a native\nQSH state with a gap much as large as 0.29 eV at the {\\Gamma} point, which is\nlarger than the buckled (0.2 eV) and flattened (0.2 eV) bismuth, Bi4Br4 (0.18\neV), as well as stanene (0.1 eV), also more stable energetically than these\nsystems. Interestingly, the bismuthylene has tunable band gaps and nontrivial\nband topology under strains within -6 - 5 % and electric fields up to 0.8\neV/{\\AA}. Furthermore, a tight-binding model is constructed to explain the\nlow-energy physics behind band topology induced by spin-orbit coupling. We also\npropose a quantum well by sandwiching bismuthylene between two BN sheets and\nreveals that this structure remains topologically nontrivial with a sizeable\nband gap. This findings on QSH effect of bismuthylene provide a viable platform\nin new generation of dissipationless electronics and spintronics devices.\n", "  Dmitri Ivanenko, professor of Moscow State University, was one of the great\ntheoreticians of XX century, an author of the proton-neutron model of atomic\nnucleus. In honor of the 110th Year Anniversary.\n", "  Gender bias is an increasingly important issue in sports journalism. In this\nwork, we propose a language-model-based approach to quantify differences in\nquestions posed to female vs. male athletes, and apply it to tennis post-match\ninterviews. We find that journalists ask male players questions that are\ngenerally more focused on the game when compared with the questions they ask\ntheir female counterparts. We also provide a fine-grained analysis of the\nextent to which the salience of this bias depends on various factors, such as\nquestion type, game outcome or player rank.\n", "  Context. Very high-energy (VHE) $\\gamma$-ray measurements of distant TeV\nblazars can be nicely explained by TeV spectra induced by ultra high-energy\ncosmic rays.\n  Aims. We develop a model for a plausible origin of hard spectra in distant\nTeV blazars. Methods. In the model, the TeV emission in distant TeV blazars is\ndominated by two mixed components. The first is the internal component with the\nphoton energy around 1 TeV produced by inverse Compton scattering of the\nrelativistic electrons on the synchrotron photons (SSC) with a correction for\nextragalactic background light absorbtion and the other is the external\ncomponent with the photon energy more than 1 TeV produced by the cascade\nemission from high-energy protons propagating through intergalactic space.\n  Results. Assuming suitable model parameters, we apply the model to observed\nspectra of distant TeV blazars of 1ES 0229+200. Our results show that 1) the\nobserved spectrum properties of 1ES 0229+200, especially the TeV $\\gamma$-ray\ntail of the observed spectra, could be reproduced in our model and 2) an\nexpected TeV $\\gamma$-ray spectrum with photon energy $>$1 TeV of 1ES 0229+200\nshould be comparable with the 50-hour sensitivity goal of the Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA) and the differential sensitivity curve for the one-year\nobservation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).\n  Conclusions. We argue that strong evidence for the Bethe-Heitler cascades\nalong the line of sight as a plausible origin of hard spectra in distant TeV\nblazars could be obtained from VHE observations with CTA, LHAASO, HAWC, and\nHiSCORE.\n", "  Since the discovery of topological insulators, many topological phases have\nbeen predicted and realized in a range of different systems, providing both\nfascinating physics and exciting opportunities for devices. And although new\nmaterials are being developed and explored all the time, the prospects for\nprobing exotic topological phases would be greatly enhanced if they could be\nrealized in systems that were easily tuned. The flexibility offered by\nultracold atoms could provide such a platform. Here, we review the tools\navailable for creating topological states using ultracold atoms in optical\nlattices, give an overview of the theoretical and experimental advances and\nprovide an outlook towards realizing strongly correlated topological phases.\n", "  We develop a semi-analytical approach beyond the Born-Markov approximation to\nstudy the quench dynamics of the spin-boson model in the strong-coupling regime\n($\\alpha\\leq1/2$) for the Ohmic bath. The basic idea in our approach is to\nwrite an effective time-dependent model for the dynamics of the system coupled\nto the bosonic bath after integrating out high-frequency bath modes. By\napplying this procedure to the Heisenberg equations of motion, we derive a set\nof flow equations for the system parameters as a function of time. The final\nflow equations look similar to those of the equilibrium renormalization-group\ntheory; however, in our derivation the scaling parameter is set by the real\ntime. We solve the equations of motion with time-dependent renormalized\nparameters and show that the resulting dynamics is in decent agreement with the\nexact NRG calculations as well as the non-interacting blip approximation that\nis a well-known good solution in this limit.\n", "  The wavefunction for indistinguishable fermions is anti-symmetric under\nparticle exchange, which directly leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, and\nhence underlies the structure of atoms and the properties of almost all\nmaterials. In the dynamics of collisions between two indistinguishable fermions\nthis requirement strictly prohibits scattering into 90 degree angles. Here we\nexperimentally investigate the collisions of ultracold clouds fermionic\n$\\rm^{40}K$ atoms by directly measuring scattering distributions. With\nincreasing collision energy we identify the Wigner threshold for p-wave\nscattering with its tell-tale dumb-bell shape and no $90^\\circ$ yield. Above\nthis threshold effects of multiple scattering become manifest as deviations\nfrom the underlying binary p-wave shape, adding particles either isotropically\nor axially. A shape resonance for $\\rm^{40}K$ facilitates the separate\nobservation of these two processes. The isotropically enhanced multiple\nscattering mode is a generic p-wave threshold phenomenon, while the axially\nenhanced mode should occur in any colliding particle system with an elastic\nscattering resonance.\n", "  A model of nonlinear electromagnetic fields with a dimensional parameter\n$\\beta$ is proposed. From PVLAS experiment the bound on the parameter $\\beta$\nwas obtained. Electromagnetic fields are coupled with the gravitation field and\nwe show that the universe accelerates due to nonlinear electromagnetic fields.\nThe magnetic universe is considered and the stochastic magnetic field is a\nbackground. After inflation the universe decelerates and approaches to the\nradiation era. The range of the scale factor, when the causality of the model\nand a classical stability take place, was obtained. The spectral index, the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, and the running of the spectral index were estimated\nwhich are in approximate agreement with the PLANCK, WMAP, and BICEP2 data.\n", "  According to classical electrolyte theories interactions in dilute (low ion\ndensity) electrolytes decay exponentially with distance, with the Debye\nscreening length the characteristic length-scale. This decay length decreases\nmonotonically with increasing ion concentration, due to effective screening of\ncharges over short distances. Thus within the Debye model no long-range forces\nare expected in concentrated electrolytes. Here we reveal, using experimental\ndetection of the interaction between two planar charged surfaces across a wide\nrange of electrolytes, that beyond the dilute (Debye-Huuckel) regime the\nscreening length increases with increasing concentration. The screening lengths\nfor all electrolytes studied - including aqueous NaCl solutions, ionic liquids\ndiluted with propylene carbonate, and pure ionic liquids - collapse onto a\nsingle curve when scaled by the dielectric constant. This non-monotonic\nvariation of the screening length with concentration, and its generality across\nionic liquids and aqueous salt solutions, demonstrates an important\ncharacteristic of concentrated electrolytes of substantial relevance from\nbiology to energy storage.\n", "  We present 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of the adiabatic\ninteraction of a shock with a dense, filamentary cloud. We investigate the\neffects of various filament lengths and orientations on the interaction using\ndifferent orientations of the magnetic field, and vary the Mach number of the\nshock, the density contrast of the filament, and the plasma beta, in order to\ndetermine their effect on the evolution and lifetime of the filament. We find\nthat in a parallel magnetic field filaments have longer lifetimes if they are\norientated more 'broadside' to the shock front, and that an increase in the\ndensity contrast hastens the destruction of the cloud, in terms of the modified\ncloud-crushing time-scale, tcs. The combination of a mild shock and a\nperpendicular or oblique field provides the best condition for extending the\nlife of the filament, with some filaments able to survive almost indefinitely\nsince they are cocooned by the magnetic field. A high value for the density\ncontrast does not initiate large turbulent instabilities in either the\nperpendicular or oblique field cases but rather draws the filament out into\nlong tendrils which may eventually fragment. In addition, flux ropes are only\nformed in parallel magnetic fields. The length of the filament is, however, not\nas important for the evolution and destruction of a filament.\n", "  One of the main problems that optical quantum computing has to overcome is\nthe efficient construction of two-photon gates. Theoretically these gates can\nbe realized using Kerr-nonlinearities, but the techniques involved are\nexperimentally very difficult. We therefore employ linear optics with\nprojective measurements to generate these non-linearities. The downside is that\nthe measurement-induced nonlinearities achieved with linear optics are less\nversatile and the success rate can be quite low. This project is mainly the\nresult of a literature study but also a theoretical work on the physics behind\nquantum optical multiports which is essential for realizing two-photon gates.\nBy applying different postcorrection techniques we increase the probability of\nsuccess in a modifed non-linear sign shift gate which is foundational for the\ntwo photon controlled-NOT gate. We prove that it's not possible to correct the\nstates by only using a single beam splitter. We show that it might be possible\nto increase the probability of success using a more complex setup with at least\ntwo error-correcting beam splitters.\n", "  We extend the symbolic representation to the ring of N=1 supersymmetric\ndifferential polynomials, and demonstrate that operations on the ring, such as\nthe super derivative, Frechet derivative and super commutator, can be carried\nout in the symbolic way. Using the symbolic representation, we classify scalar\n$\\lambda$-homogeneous N=1 supersymmetric evolutionary equations with nonzero\nlinear term when $\\lambda>0$ for arbitrary order and give a comprehensive\ndescription of all such integrable equations.\n", "  We report on fabrication of large-scale arrays of suspended molybdenum\ndisulfide (MoS2) atomic layers, as two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 nanomechanical\nresonators. We employ a water-assisted lift-off process to release chemical\nvapor deposited (CVD) MoS2 atomic layers from a donor substrate, followed by an\nall-dry transfer onto microtrench arrays. The resultant large arrays of\nsuspended single- and few-layer MoS2 drumhead resonators (0.5 to 2um in\ndiameter) offer fundamental resonances (f_0) in the very high frequency (VHF)\nband (up to ~120MHz) and excellent figures-of-merit up to f_0*Q ~ 3*10^10Hz. A\nstretched circular diaphragm model allows us to estimate low pre-tension levels\nof typically ~15mN/m in these devices. Compared to previous approaches, our\ntransfer process features high yield and uniformity with minimal liquid and\nchemical exposure (only involving DI water), resulting in high-quality MoS2\ncrystals and exceptional device performance and homogeneity; and our process is\nreadily applicable to other 2D materials.\n", "  We report new measurements of the thermal expansion and thermo-optic\ncoefficients of RbTiOPO$_4$ (RTP) and KTiOPO$_4$ (KTP) crystals over the\ntemperature range 300-350 K. For RTP/KTP our coefficients of linear thermal\nexpansion at 305 K are: $\\alpha_x=9.44/7.88\\times 10^{-6}$/K,\n$\\alpha_y=12.49/9.48\\times 10^{-6}$/K, $\\alpha_z=-4.16/0.02\\times 10^{-6}$/K.\nOur normalized thermo-optic coefficients $\\beta=(1/n)dn/dT$ at 632.8 nm and 305\nK are: $\\beta_x=5.39/3.78\\times 10^{-6}$/K, $\\beta_y=7.11/5.24\\times\n10^{-6}$/K, $\\beta_z=12.35/9.34\\times 10^{-6}$/K.\n", "  An inverse scattering problems for the 3-D generalized Helmholtz equation is\nconsidered. Only the modulus of the complex valued scattered wave field is\nassumed to be measured and the phase is not measured. Uniqueness theorem is\nproved.\n", "  HR 8799 harbors arguably the first and best-studied directly-imaged planets.\nIn this brief article, I describe how the HR 8799 planetary system is a\nbenchmark system for studying the atmospheres, orbital properties, dynamical\nstability, and formation of young superjovian planets. Multi-wavelength\nphotometry and spectroscopy show that HR 8799 bcde appear to have thicker\nclouds than do field brown dwarfs of similar effective temperatures and exhibit\nevidence for non-equilibrium carbon chemistry, features that are likely\nconnected to the planets' low surface gravities. Over 17 years of astrometric\ndata constrain the planets' orbits to not be face on but possibly in multiple\norbital resonances. At orbital separations of 15--70 au and with masses of\n$\\approx$ 5--7 $M_{\\rm J}$, HR 8799 bcde probe the extremes of jovian planet\nformation by core accretion: medium-resolution spectroscopy may provide clues\nabout these planets' formation conditions. Data from the next generation of 30\nm-class telescopes should better constrain the planets' orbits, chemistry,\ngravity, and formation history.\n", "  The collisional and magnetic field quench dynamics of a coupled spin-vortex\npair in dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensates in a double well potential are\nnumerically investigated in the mean field theory. Upon a sudden release of the\npotential barrier the two layers of condensates collide with each other in the\ntrap center with the chirality of the vortex pair exchanged after each\ncollision, showing the typical signature of in-phase collision for the parallel\nspin vortex phase, and out-of-phase collision for the antiparallel phase. When\nquenching the transverse magnetic field, the vortex center in the\nsingle-layered condensate starts to make a helical motion with oval-shaped\ntrajectories and the displacement of the center position is found to exhibit a\ndamped simple harmonic oscillation with an intrinsic frequency and damping\nrate. The oscillation mode of the spin vortex pair may be tuned by the initial\nmagnetic field and the height of the Gaussian barrier, e.g. the gyrotropic\nmotions for parallel spin vortex pair are out of sync with each other in the\ntwo layers, while those for the antiparallel pair exhibit a\ndouble-helix-structure with the vortex centers moving opposite to each other\nwith the same amplitude.\n", "  Proton capture cross sections in the energy range of astrophysical interest\nfor mass region 40-54 have been calculated in the Hauser-Feshbach formalism\nwith reaction code TALYS1.6. The density dependent M3Y effective\nnucleon-nucleon interaction folded with target radial matter densities from\nrelativistic mean field approach is used to obtain the semi-microscopic optical\npotential. A definite normalization of potential-well depths has been used over\nthe entire mass region. The $(p,\\gamma)$ rates of some reactions, important in\nthe astrophysical scenario, are calculated using the potential in the relevant\nmass region.\n", "  The smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) method is the standard method for\ncomputing the electrostatic interactions in the molecular simulations. In this\nwork, the multiple staggered mesh Ewald (MSME) method is proposed to boost the\naccuracy of the SPME method. Unlike the SPME that achieves higher accuracy by\nrefining the mesh, the MSME improves the accuracy by averaging the standard\nSPME forces computed on, e.g. $M$, staggered meshes. We prove, from theoretical\nperspective, that the MSME is as accurate as the SPME, but uses $M^2$ times\nless mesh points in a certain parameter range. In the complementary parameter\nrange, the MSME is as accurate as the SPME with twice of the interpolation\norder. The theoretical conclusions are numerically validated both by a uniform\nand uncorrelated charge system, and by a three-point-charge water system that\nis widely used as solvent for the bio-macromolecules.\n", "  We propose a method to achieve strong coupling between a spin ensemble and a\nlarge Josephson junctions (LJJ). Then, the strong coupling between two spin\nensembles can be induced by a LJJ. A non-adiabatic holonomic single-qubit\nquantum gates is realized. Moreover, with the dispersive interaction between\nthe spin ensembles and the LJJ, the high-fidelity two-qubit phase gate can be\nimplemented with two spin ensembles within an operation time 0.41 ns and $\\pi$\nphase-swap gate can be realized within an operation time 103.11 ns with a high\nfidelity greater than 99%.\n", "  Quantum mechanics and general relativity have been each successfully tested\nin numerous experiments. However, the regime where both theories are jointly\nrequired to explain physical phenomena remains untested by laboratory\nexperiments, and is also not fully understood by theory. This contribution\nreviews recent ideas for a new type of experiments: quantum interference of\n\"clocks\", which aim to test novel quantum effects that arise from time\ndilation. \"Clock\" interference experiments could be realised with atoms or\nphotons in near future laboratory experiments.\n", "  Observations of the Galactic Center (GC) region in very-high-energy (VHE,\n>100 GeV) gamma rays, conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.), led to the detection of an extended region of diffuse gamma-ray\nemission in 2006. To date, the exact origin of this emission has remained\nunclear, although a tight spatial correlation between the density distribution\nof the molecular material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and the\nmorphology of the observed gamma-ray excess points towards a hadronic\nproduction scenario. In this proceeding, we present a numerical study of the\npropagation of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through a turbulent environment\nsuch as the GC region. In our analysis, we derive an energy-dependent\nparametrization for the diffusion coefficient which we use for our simulation\nof the diffuse gamma-ray emission at the GC. Assuming that hadronic CRs have\nbeen released by a single impulsive event at the center of our Galaxy, we probe\nthe question whether or not the interaction processes of the diffusing hadrons\nwith ambient matter can explain the observed diffuse gamma-ray excess. Our\nresults disfavor this scenario, as our analysis indicates that the diffusion\nprocess is, on timescales compared to the typical proton lifetime at the GC\nregion, too slow to explain the extension of the observed emission.\n", "  An effective indexing scheme for clusters that enables fast structure\ncomparison and congruence check is desperately desirable in the field of\nmathematics, artificial intelligence, materials science, etc. Here we introduce\nthe concept of minimum vertex-type sequence for the indexing of clusters on\nsquare lattice, which contains a series of integers each labeling the vertex\ntype of an atom. The minimum vertex-type sequence is orientation independent,\nand it builds a one-to-one correspondence with the cluster. By using minimum\nvertex-type sequence for structural comparison and congruence check, only one\ntype of data is involved, and the largest amount of data to be compared is n\npairs, n is the cluster size. In comparison with traditional coordinate-based\nmethods and distance-matrix methods, the minimum vertex-type sequence indexing\nscheme has many other remarkable advantages. Furthermore, this indexing scheme\ncan be easily generalized to clusters on other high-symmetry lattices. Our work\ncan facilitate cluster indexing and searching in various situations, it may\ninspire the search of other practical indexing schemes for handling clusters of\nlarge sizes.\n", "  We present an overview of our recent investigations of long-range\ninteractions in an ultracold Cs Rydberg gas. These interactions are studied by\nhigh-resolution photoassociation spectroscopy, using excitation close to\none-photon transitions into $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg states with pulsed and\ncontinuous-wave ultraviolet laser radiation, and lead to the formation of\nlong-range Cs$_2$ molecules. We observe two types of molecular resonances. The\nfirst type originates from the correlated excitation of two atoms into\nRydberg-atom-pair states interacting at long range via multipole-multipole\ninteractions. The second type results from the interaction of one atom excited\nto a Rydberg state with one atom in the electronic ground state. Which type of\nresonances is observed in the experiments depends on the laser intensity and\nfrequency and on the pulse sequences used to prepare the Rydberg states. We\nobtain insights into both types of molecular resonances by modelling the\ninteraction potentials, using a multipole expansion of the long-range\ninteraction for the first type of resonances and a Fermi-contact\npseudo-potential for the second type of resonances. We analyse the relation of\nthese long-range molecular resonances to molecular Rydberg states and ion-pair\nstates, and discuss their decay channels into atomic and molecular ions. In\nexperiments carried out with a two-colour two-photon excitation scheme, we\nobserve a large enhancement of Rydberg-excitation probability, which we\ninterpret as a saturable autocatalytic antiblockade phenomenon.\n", "  The exponential family of random graphs represents an important and\nchallenging class of network models. Despite their flexibility, conventionally\nused exponential random graphs have one shortcoming. They cannot directly model\nweighted networks as the underlying probability space consists of simple graphs\nonly. Since many substantively important networks are weighted, this limitation\nis especially problematic. We extend the existing exponential framework by\nproposing a generic common distribution for the edge weights and rigorously\nanalyze the associated phase transitions and critical phenomena. We then apply\nthese general results to get concrete answers in exponential random graph\nmodels where the edge weights are uniformly distributed.\n", "  We construct rogue wave and breather solutions of a quasi-two-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with a time-dependent interatomic interaction and\nexternal trap. We show that the trapping potential and an arbitrary functional\nparameter that present in the similarity transformation should satisfy a\nconstraint for the considered equation to be integrable and yield the desired\nsolutions. We consider two different forms of functional parameters and\ninvestigate how the density of the rogue wave and breather profiles vary with\nrespect to these functional parameters. We also construct vector localized\nsolutions of a two coupled quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate\nsystem. We then investigate how the vector localized density profiles modify in\nthe constant density background with respect to the functional parameters. Our\nresults may help to manipulate matter rogue waves experimentally in the\ntwo-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate systems.\n", "  In radio interferometry, observed visibilities are intrinsically sampled at\nsome interval in time and frequency. Modern interferometers are capable of\nproducing data at very high time and frequency resolution; practical limits on\nstorage and computation costs require that some form of data compression be\nimposed. The traditional form of compression is a simple averaging of the\nvisibilities over coarser time and frequency bins. This has an undesired side\neffect: the resulting averaged visibilities \"decorrelate\", and do so\ndifferently depending on the baseline length and averaging interval. This\ntranslates into a non-trivial signature in the image domain known as\n\"smearing\", which manifests itself as an attenuation in amplitude towards\noff-centre sources. With the increasing fields of view and/or longer baselines\nemployed in modern and future instruments, the trade-off between data rate and\nsmearing becomes increasingly unfavourable. In this work we investigate\nalternative approaches to low-loss data compression. We show that averaging of\nthe visibility data can be treated as a form of convolution by a boxcar-like\nwindow function, and that by employing alternative baseline-dependent window\nfunctions a more optimal interferometer smearing response may be induced. In\nparticular, we show improved amplitude response over a chosen field of\ninterest, and better attenuation of sources outside the field of interest. The\nmain cost of this technique is a reduction in nominal sensitivity; we\ninvestigate the smearing vs. sensitivity trade-off, and show that in certain\nregimes a favourable compromise can be achieved. We show the application of\nthis technique to simulated data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)\nand the European Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (EVN).\n", "  Up to now, experiments involving M\\\"ossbauer nuclei driven by x-rays have\nbeen restricted to the low-excitation regime. Here, a setup is proposed which\npromises significant excitation, ideally exceeding full inversion of the\nnuclear ensemble, at x-ray light sources under construction. We further\nintroduce a method to experimentally verify such inversions, in which\npopulation inversions manifest themselves in symmetry flips of suitably\nrecorded spectra. It neither requires per-shot spectra of the incoming x-ray\npulses, nor absolute measurements of the scattered light intensity.\n", "  In this article we present a particular theory of gravity in which Einstein's\nfield equations are modified by promoting Newton's constant $G$ to a covariant\ndifferential operator $G_\\Lambda(\\Box_g)$. The general idea was obviously\noutlined for the first time in [13-16] and originates from the quest of finding\na mechanism that is able to degravitate the vacuum energy on cosmological\nscales. We suggest in this manuscript a precise covariant coupling model which\nacts like a high-pass filter with a macroscopic distance filter scale\n$\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$. In the context of this specific theory of gravity we review\nsome cosmological aspects before we briefly recall the effective relaxed\nEinstein equations outlined for the first time in [1]. We present a general\nprocedure to determine the gravitational potentials for a far away wave zone\nfield point. Moreover we work out the modified orbital dynamics of a\nbinary-system as well as the effective 1.5 post-Newtonian barycentre for a\ngeneric $n$-body system. We notice that it is always possible to recover the\ncorresponding general relativistic results in the limit of vanishing nonlocal\nmodification parameters.\n", "  This article reviews recent progress in formulating double-copy constructions\nfor scattering amplitudes in supergravity theories with N=2 supersymmetry in\nfive and four spacetime dimensions. Particular attention is devoted to infinite\nfamilies of Maxwell-Einstein theories with symmetric and homogeneous target\nspaces and to Yang-Mills-Einstein theories with compact gauge groups. Extension\nof the construction to theories with spontaneously-broken gauge symmetry is\nalso discussed.\n", "  Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) is widely recognized as a\nreliable method to measure water surface velocity field in open channels and\nrivers. LSPIV technique is based on a camera view that frames the water surface\nin a sequence, and image-processing methods to compute water surface\ndisplacements between consecutive frames. Using LSPIV, high flow velocities, as\nfor example flood conditions, were accurately measured, whereas determinations\nof low flow velocities is more challenging, especially in absence of floating\nseeding transported by the flow velocity. In fact, in unseeded conditions,\ntypical surface features dynamics must be taken into account: besides surface\nstructures convected by the current, capillary-gravity waves travel in all\ndirections, with their own dynamics. Discrimination between all these phenomena\nis here discussed, providing a new method to distinguish and to correct\nunseeded LSPIV measurements associated with wavy structures, accounting for\ntheir phase speed magnitude and direction. This has been done measuring\nwavenumber vectors by using the same images exploited for PIV analysis. All\nmeasurements are performed without any flow seeding and in total absence of\nsuspended materials, using the specular reflection of the water surface as a\nkey marker. Results obtained at low-flow regimes in a straight concrete-made\nrectangular-section channel and in a river are satisfying, especially if\ncompared to those obtained from classic LSPIV application without\ndiscrimination and correction. Moreover, a novel simple and safe procedure to\northorectify images is here presented.\n", "  Proposing a combined system of a nanoparticle and a plane surface in the\npresence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, the electromagnetic and medium\nfields have been quantized. Quantum friction of nanoparticle due to the\npresence of plane surface and also electromagnetic vacuum has been discussed.\nThe possibility of synchronizing rotating bodies through the quantum friction\nbetween them are investigated. It has been shown that there is a significant\nconnection between the synchronization of the rotating bodies and their quantum\nfriction.\n", "  We study the X-ray variability of SS433 based on data from the ASCA\nobservatory and the MAXI and RXTE/ASM monitoring missions. Based on the ASCA\ndata, we have constructed the power spectrum of SS433 in the frequency range\nfrom $10^{-6}$ to 0.1 Hz, which confirms the presence of a flat portion\n(flat-topped noise) in the spectrum at frequencies $3\\times 10^{-5}$ -\n$10^{-3}$ Hz. The periodic variability (precession, nutation, eclipses) begins\nto dominate significantly over the stochastic variability at lower frequencies,\nwhich does not allow the stochastic variability to be studied reliably. The\nbest agreement with the observations is reached by the model with the flat\nportion extending to $9.5\\times10^{-6}$ Hz and a power-law spectrum with index\nof 2.6 below that frequency. The jet nutation with a period of about three days\nsuggests that the time for the passage of material through the disk is less\nthan this value. Therefore, at frequencies below $4\\times10^{-6}$ Hz, the power\nspectrum probably does not reflect the disk structure. It may depend on other\nfactors, for example, a variable mass accretion rate supplied by the donor. The\nflat portion may arise from a rapid decrease in the viscous time in the\nsupercritical or radiative disk zones. It could be related to the variability\nof the X-ray jets that are formed in the supercritical region.\n", "  We develop a galaxy cluster finding algorithm based on spectral clustering\ntechnique to identify optical counterparts and estimate optical redshifts for\nX-ray selected cluster candidates. As an application, we run our algorithm on a\nsample of X-ray cluster candidates selected from the third XMM-Newton\nserendipitous source catalog (3XMM-DR5) that are located in the Stripe 82 of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our method works on galaxies described in\nthe color-magnitude feature space. We begin by examining 45 galaxy clusters\nwith published spectroscopic redshifts in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 with a median\nof 0.36. As a result, we are able to identify their optical counterparts and\nestimate their photometric redshifts, which have a typical accuracy of 0.025\nand agree with the published ones. Then, we investigate another 40 X-ray\ncluster candidates (from the same cluster survey) with no redshift information\nin the literature and found that 12 candidates are considered as galaxy\nclusters in the redshift range from 0.29 to 0.76 with a median of 0.57. These\nsystems are newly discovered clusters in X-rays and optical data. Among them 7\nclusters have spectroscopic redshifts for at least one member galaxy.\n", "  Chameleon fields are quantum fields with an increasing mass as a function of\nthe matter density of the environment. Recently chameleon fields have been\nexploited to solve the cosmological constant problem in the Modified Fujii's\nModel - MFM [Phys Rev D82 (2010) 044006]. However, gravity has been treated\nbasically at a semiclassical level in that paper. In this article the stringy\norigin of the MFM is further discussed: as we will see, the MFM can be obtained\nfrom heterotic-M-theory. Consequently, a quantum description of gravity is\nobtained and the theory is finite because we choose the string mass as our UV\ncut-off. This stringy origin of the MFM creates stronger theoretical grounds\nfor our solution to the cosmological constant problem. In our analysis, time\nwill be compactified on a $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold and this peculiar compactification\nof time has a number of consequences. For example, as we will see, quantum\ngravity and a quantum gauge theory are actually the same theory in the sense\nthat gravity is the time-evolution of a gauge theory. This might be the key to\nobtain a non-approximated stabilizing potential for the dilaton in the string\nframe. In this paper we will further discuss the non-equivalence of different\nconformal frames at the quantum level. As we will see, in our approach we use\nbasically a unique conformal frame: the frame where the masses of particles are\nfield dependent. A word of caution is necessary: we do not take into account\nmassive string states and IR divergences.\n", "  The NA48/2 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of charged kaon decays\ninto final states with multiple charged particles in 2003--2004. A new upper\nlimit on the rate of the lepton number violating decay $K^{\\pm} \\to \\pi^{\\mp}\n\\mu^{\\pm} \\mu^{\\pm}$ obtained from this sample is reported:\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm} \\to \\pi^{\\mp} \\mu^{\\pm} \\mu^{\\pm})<8.6 \\times 10^{-11}$ at\n90\\% CL. Searches for two-body resonances in the $K^{\\pm} \\to \\pi\\mu\\mu$ decays\n(including heavy neutral leptons~$N_4$ and inflatons~$\\chi$) in the accessible\nrange of masses and lifetimes are also presented. In the absence of a signal,\nupper limits are set on the products of branching ratios~$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm}\n\\to \\mu^{\\pm} N_{4})\\mathcal{B}(N_{4} \\to \\pi^{\\mp}\\mu^{\\pm})$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm} \\to \\pi^{\\pm} \\chi)\\mathcal{B}(\\chi \\to \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})$\nas functions of the resonance mass and lifetime. These limits are in the\n$10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ range for resonance lifetimes below 100~ps.\n", "  We describe rules for computing a homology theory of knots and links in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. It is derived from the theory of framed BPS states bound to\ndomain walls separating two-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg models with (2,2)\nsupersymmetry. We illustrate the rules with some sample computations, obtaining\nresults consistent with Khovanov homology. We show that of the two\nLandau-Ginzburg models discussed in this context by Gaiotto and Witten one,\n(the so-called Yang-Yang-Landau-Ginzburg model) does not lead to topological\ninvariants of links while the other, based on a model with target space equal\nto the universal cover of the moduli space of $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles, will\nindeed produce a topologically invariant theory of knots and links.\n", "  Saturation and geometrical scaling (GS) of gluon distributions are a\nconsequence of the non-linear evolution equations of QCD. We argue that in pp\nGS holds for the inelastic cross-section rather than for the multiplicity\ndistributions. We also discuss possible fluctuations of the proton saturation\nscale in pA collisions at the LHC.\n", "  Low-dimensional quantum magnets, due to the existence of abundant exotic\nquantum phases therein and experimental feasibilities in laboratories,\ncontinues intriguing people in condensed matter physics. In this work, a\ncomprehensive study of Cu(NO$_3$)$_2$ $\\cdot$ 2.5H$_2$O (copper nitrate\nhemipentahydrate, CN), a spin chain material, is performed with multi-technique\napproach including thermal tensor network (TTN) simulations, first-principles\ncalculations, as well as magnetization measurements in experiments. Employing a\ncutting-edge TTN method developed in the present work, we determine the\ncouplings $J=5.13$ K, $\\alpha=0.23(1)$ and Land\\'e factors\n$g_{\\parallel}=2.31$, $g_{\\perp}=2.14$ in an alternating Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic chain model, with which one can fit strikingly well the\nmagnetothermodynamic properties. Part of the fitted experimental data are\nmeasured on the single-crystal CN specimens synthesized by us. Based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we reveal explicitly the spin chain scenario in\nCN by displaying the calculated electron density distributions, from which the\ndistinct superexchange paths are visualized. On top of that, we investigated\nthe magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in CN by calculating its isentropes and\nmagnetic Gr\\\"ueisen parameter (GP). Prominent quantum-criticality-enhanced MCE\nwas uncovered, the TTN simulations are in good agreements with measured\nisentropic lines in the sub-Kelvin region. We propose that CN is potentially a\nvery promising quantum critical coolant, due to the remarkably enhanced MCE\nnear both critical fields of moderate strengths as 2.87 and 4.08 T,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present a protocol to generate a large degree of squeezing of a boson\n(light) field mode strongly coupled to a two-level system in the dispersive\nregime. Our protocol exploits the strong dispersive coupling to introduce a\ntime dependent frequency change of the boson field. With an appropriately timed\nsequence of sudden frequency changes, the quantum noise fluctuations in one\nquadrature of the field can be reduced well below the standard quantum limit,\nwith a correspondingly increased uncertainty in the orthogonal quadrature. Even\nin the presence of realistic noise and imperfections, the protocol should be\ncapable of generating substantial squeezing with present experimental\ncapabilities.\n", "  We explore ways to obtain the very existence of a space-time metric from an\naction principle that does not refer to it a priori. Although there are reasons\nto believe that only a non-local theory can viably achieve this goal, we\ninvestigate here local theories that start with Schroedinger's purely affine\ntheory [21], where he gave reasons to set the metric proportional to the Ricci\ncurvature aposteriori. When we leave the context of unified field theory, and\nwe couple the non-gravitational matter using some weak equivalence principle,\nwe can show that the propagation of shock waves does not define a lightcone\nwhen the purely affine theory is local and avoids the explicit use of the Ricci\ntensor in realizing the weak equivalence principle. When the Ricci tensor is\nsubstituted for the metric, the equations seem to have only a very limited set\nof solutions. This backs the conviction that viable purely affine theories have\nto be non-local.\n", "  In this work we complete the spin dependent conservative dynamics of\ninspiralling compact binaries at the fourth post-Newtonian order, and in\nparticular the recent derivation of the next-to-next-to-leading order\nspin-squared interaction potential. We derive the physical equations of motion\nof the position and the spin from a direct variation of the action. Further, we\nderive the quadratic in spin Hamiltonians, as well as their expressions in the\ncenter of mass frame. We construct the conserved integrals of motion, which\nform the Poincare algebra. This construction provided a consistency check for\nthe validity of our result, which is crucial in particular in the current\nabsence of another independent derivation of the next-to-next-to-leading order\nspin-squared interaction. Finally, we provide here the complete gauge invariant\nrelations among the binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital frequency of\nan inspiralling binary with generic compact spinning components to the fourth\npost-Newtonian order. These high post-Newtonian orders, in particular taking\ninto account the spins of the binary constituents, will enable to gain more\naccurate information on the constituents from even more sensitive gravitational\nwave detections to come.\n", "  In this paper we extend the familiar continuum electrostatic model with a\nperturbation to the usual macroscopic boundary condition. The perturbation is\nbased on the mean spherical approximation (MSA), to derive a multiscale\nhydration-shell boundary condition (HSBC). We show that the HSBC/MSA model\nreproduces MSA predictions for Born ions in a variety of polar solvents,\nincluding both protic and aprotic solvents. Importantly, the HSBC/MSA model\npredicts not only solvation free energies accurately but also solvation\nentropies, which standard continuum electrostatic models fail to predict. The\nHSBC/MSA model depends only on the normal electric field at the dielectric\nboundary, similar to our recent development of an HSBC model for charge-sign\nhydration asymmetry, and the reformulation of the MSA as a boundary condition\nenables its straightforward application to complex molecules such as proteins.\n", "  Here we present graphene-based nanoelectromechanical switch with the vertical\ncarbon nanotube electrode via classical molecular dynamics simulations. The\ncarbon nanotube is grown in the center of the square hole and the graphene\ncovers on the hole. The potential difference between the bottom of the hole and\nthe graphene is applied to deflect the graphene. By performing classical\nmolecular dynamic simulations, we investigate the electromechanical properties\nof graphene-based nanoelectro- mechanical switch with carbon nanotube\nelectrode, which can be switched by the externally applied force. This\nsimulation work explicitly demonstrated that such devices are applicable to\nnanoscale sensors and quantum computing, as well as ultra-fast-response\nswitching devices.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a hydrogen-deficient compact binary (CXOGBS\nJ175107.6-294037) belonging to the AM CVn class in the Galactic Bulge Survey.\nDeep archival X-ray observations constrain the X-ray positional uncertainty of\nthe source to 0.57 arcsec, and allow us to uniquely identify the optical and UV\ncounterpart. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of broad,\nshallow He i absorption lines while no sign of hydrogen is present, consistent\nwith a high state system. We present the optical lightcurve from Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment monitoring, spanning 15 years. It shows no\nevidence for outbursts; variability is present at the 0.2 mag level on\ntimescales ranging from hours to weeks. A modulation on a timescale of years is\nalso observed. A Lomb-Scargle analysis of the optical lightcurves shows two\nsignificant periodicities at 22.90 and 23.22 min. Although the physical\ninterpretation is uncertain, such timescales are in line with expectations for\nthe orbital and superhump periods. We estimate the distance to the source to be\nbetween 0.5 - 1.1 kpc. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to\nestablish the orbital period, and to determine whether this source can serve as\na verification binary for the eLISA gravitational wave mission.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a mathematical model that captures some of the\nsalient features of recommender systems that are based on popularity and that\ntry to exploit social ties among the users. We show that, under very general\nconditions, the market always converges to a steady state, for which we are\nable to give an explicit form. Thanks to this we can tell rather precisely how\nmuch a market is altered by a recommendation system, and determine the power of\nusers to influence others. Our theoretical results are complemented by\nexperiments with real world social networks showing that social graphs prevent\nlarge market distortions in spite of the presence of highly influential users.\n"]}
