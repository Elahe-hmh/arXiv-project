The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.\n", "  We present a fully pseudo-spectral scheme to solve axisymmetric hyperbolic\nequations of second order. With the Chebyshev polynomials as basis functions,\nthe numerical grid is based on the Lobbato (for two spatial directions) and\nRadau (for the time direction) collocation points. The method solves two issues\nof previous algorithms which were restricted to one spatial dimension, namely,\n(i) the inversion of a dense matrix and (ii) the acquisition of a sufficiently\ngood initial-guess for non-linear systems of equations. For the first issue, we\nuse the iterative bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method, which we equip with\na pre-conditioner based on a singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (\"SDIRK\"-)\nmethod. The SDIRK-method also supplies the code with a good initial-guess. The\nnumerical solutions are correct up to machine precision and we do not observe\nany restriction concerning the time step in comparison with the spatial\nresolution. As an application, we solve general-relativistic wave equations on\na black-hole space-time in so-called hyperboloidal slices and reproduce some\nrecent results available in the literature.\n", "  Cosmology has come a long way from being based on a small number of\nobservations to being a data-driven precision science. We discuss the questions\n\"What is observable?\", \"What in the Universe is knowable?\" and \"What are the\nfundamental limits to cosmological knowledge?\". We then describe the\nmethodology for investigation: theoretical hypotheses are used to model,\npredict and anticipate results; data is used to infer theory. We illustrate\nwith concrete examples of principled analysis approaches from the study of\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and surveys of large-scale structure,\nculminating in a summary of the highest precision probe to date of the physical\norigin of cosmic structures: the Planck 2013 constraints on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity.\n", "  The radical-pair mechanism is understood to underlie the magnetic navigation\ncapability of birds and possibly other species. Experiments with birds have\nprovided indirect and in cases conflicting evidence on the actual existence of\nthis mechanism. We here propose a new experiment that can unambiguously\nidentify the presence of the radical-pair magnetoreceptor in birds and unravel\nsome of its basic properties. The proposed experiment is based on modulated\nlight excitation with a pulsed laser, combined with delayed radio-frequency\nmagnetic field pulses. We predict a resonance effect in the birds' magnetic\norientation versus the rf-pulse delay time. The resonance's position reflects\nthe singlet-triplet mixing time of the magnetoreceptor.\n", "  We show how two circular polarization components of a linearly polarized\npulse, propagating through a coherently driven dilute atomic vapor, can be well\nresolved in time domain by weak measurement. Slower group velocity of one of\nthe components due to electromagnetically induced transparency leads to a\ndifferential group delay between the two components. For low number density,\nthis delay may not be large enough to temporally resolve the two components. We\nshow how this can be enhanced in terms of mean time of arrival of the output\npulse through a post-selected polarizer. We demonstrate the idea with all the\nanalytical and numerical results, with a specific example of alkali atoms.\n", "  Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) have been proposed as a solution to the\nchallenge of assembling supermassive black holes by $z>6$ to explain the bright\nquasars observed at this epoch. The formation of a DCBH seed with $\\rm\nM_{BH}\\sim10^{4-5}\\ \\rm M_{\\odot}$ requires a pristine atomic-cooling halo to\nbe illuminated by an external radiation field that is sufficiently strong to\nentirely suppress H$_{2}$ cooling in the halo. Many previous studies have\nattempted to constrain the critical specific intensity that is likely required\nto suppress H$_{2}$ cooling, denoted as $J_{\\rm crit}$. However, these studies\nhave typically assumed that the incident external radiation field can be\nmodeled with a black-body spectrum. Under this assumption, it is possible to\nderive a {unique} value for $J_{\\rm crit}$ that depends only on the temperature\nof the black-body. In this study we consider a more realistic spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) for the external source of radiation that depends entirely\non its star formation history and age. The rate of destruction of the species\nresponsible for suppressing molecular hydrogen cooling depends on the detailed\nshape of the SED. Therefore the value of $J_{\\rm crit}$ is tied to the shape of\nthe incident SED of the neighbouring galaxy. We fit a parametric form to the\nrates of destruction of H$_2$ and H$^-$ that permit direct collapse. Owing to\nthis, we find that $J_{\\rm crit}$ is not a fixed threshold but can lie anywhere\nin the range $J_{\\rm crit} \\sim 0.5$--$10^{3}$, depending on the details of the\nsource stellar population.\n", "  Inertial fluid flow deformation around pillars in a microchannel is a new\nmethod for controlling fluid flow. Sequences of pillars have been shown to\nproduce a rich phase space with a wide variety of flow transformations.\nPrevious work has successfully demonstrated manual design of pillar sequences\nto achieve desired transformations of the flow cross-section, with experimental\nvalidation. However, such a method is not ideal for seeking out complex\nsculpted shapes as the search space quickly becomes too large for efficient\nmanual discovery. We explore fast, automated optimization methods to solve this\nproblem. We formulate the inertial flow physics in microchannels with different\nmicropillar configurations as a set of state transition matrix operations.\nThese state transition matrices are constructed from experimentally validated\nstreamtraces. This facilitates modeling the effect of a sequence of\nmicropillars as nested matrix-matrix products, which have very efficient\nnumerical implementations. With this new forward model, arbitrary micropillar\nsequences can be rapidly simulated with various inlet configurations, allowing\noptimization routines quick access to a large search space. We integrate this\nframework with the genetic algorithm and showcase its applicability by\ndesigning micropillar sequences for various useful transformations. We\ncomputationally discover micropillar sequences for complex transformations that\nare substantially shorter than manually designed sequences. We also determine\nsequences for novel transformations that were difficult to manually design.\nFinally, we experimentally validate these computational designs by fabricating\ndevices and comparing predictions with the results from confocal microscopy.\n", "  FeGa$_3$ is an unusual intermetallic semiconductor that presents intriguing\nmagnetic responses to the tuning of its electronic properties. When doped with\nGe, the system evolves from diamagnetic to paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ground\nstates that are not well understood. In this work, we have performed a joint\ntheoretical and experimental study of FeGa$_{3-x}$Ge$_x$ using Density\nFunctional Theory and magnetic susceptibility measurements. For low Ge\nconcentrations we observe the formation of localized moments on some Fe atoms\nand, as the dopant concentration increases, a more delocalized magnetic\nbehavior emerges. The magnetic configuration strongly depends on the dopant\ndistribution, leading even to the appearance of antiferromagnetic interactions\nin certain configurations.\n", "  Current and future large redshift surveys, as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV\nextended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS-IV/eBOSS) or the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), will use emission-line galaxies (ELG)\nto probe cosmological models by mapping the large-scale structure of the\nUniverse in the redshift range $0.6 < z < 1.7$. With current data, we explore\nthe halo-galaxy connection by measuring three clustering properties of\n$g$-selected ELGs as matter tracers in the redshift range $0.6 < z < 1$: (i)\nthe redshift-space two-point correlation function using spectroscopic redshifts\nfrom the BOSS ELG sample and VIPERS; (ii) the angular two-point correlation\nfunction on the footprint of the CFHT-LS; (iii) the galaxy-galaxy lensing\nsignal around the ELGs using the CFHTLenS. We interpret these observations by\nmapping them onto the latest high-resolution MultiDark Planck N-body\nsimulation, using a novel (Sub)Halo-Abundance Matching technique that accounts\nfor the ELG incompleteness. ELGs at $z\\sim0.8$ live in halos of $(1\\pm\n0.5)\\times10^{12}\\,h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ and 22.5$\\pm2.5$% of them are satellites\nbelonging to a larger halo. The halo occupation distribution of ELGs indicates\nthat we are sampling the galaxies in which stars form in the most efficient\nway, according to their stellar-to-halo mass ratio.\n", "  Topological defects play a pivotal role in the physics of liquid crystals and\nrepresent one of the most prominent and well studied aspects of mesophases.\nWhile in two-dimensional nematics, disclinations are traditionally treated as\npoint-like objects, recent experimental studies on active nematics have\nsuggested that half-strength disclinations might in fact possess a polar\nstructure. In this article, we provide a precise definition of polarity for\nhalf-strength nematic disclinations, we introduce a simple and robust method to\ncalculate this quantity from experimental and numerical data and we investigate\nhow the orientational properties of half-strength disclinations affect their\nrelaxational dynamics.\n", "  We present measurements of weak gravitational lensing cosmic shear two-point\nstatistics using Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data. We demonstrate\nthat our results are robust to the choice of shear measurement pipeline, either\nngmix or im3shape, and robust to the choice of two-point statistic, including\nboth real and Fourier-space statistics. Our results pass a suite of null tests\nincluding tests for B-mode contamination and direct tests for any dependence of\nthe two-point functions on a set of 16 observing conditions and galaxy\nproperties, such as seeing, airmass, galaxy color, galaxy magnitude, etc. We\nfurthermore use a large suite of simulations to compute the covariance matrix\nof the cosmic shear measurements and assign statistical significance to our\nnull tests. We find that our covariance matrix is consistent with the halo\nmodel prediction, indicating that it has the appropriate level of halo sample\nvariance. We compare the same jackknife procedure applied to the data and the\nsimulations in order to search for additional sources of noise not captured by\nthe simulations. We find no statistically significant extra sources of noise in\nthe data. The overall detection significance with tomography for our highest\nsource density catalog is 9.7sigma. Cosmological constraints from the\nmeasurements in this work are presented in a companion paper (DES et al. 2015).\n", "  We show that the frequency distribution of the first significant digits of\nthe numbers in the data sets generated from a large class of measures of\nquantum correlations, which are either entanglement measures, or belong to the\ninformation-theoretic paradigm, exhibit a universal behaviour. In particular,\nfor Haar uniformly simulated arbitrary two-qubit states, we find that the\nfirst-digit distribution corresponding to a collection of chosen computable\nquantum correlation quantifiers tend to follow the first-digit law, known as\nthe Benford's law, when the rank of the states increases. Considering a\ntwo-qubit state which is obtained from a system governed by paradigmatic spin\nHamiltonians, namely, the XY model in a transverse field, and the XXZ model, we\nshow that entanglement as well as information theoretic measures violate the\nBenford's law. We quantitatively discuss the violation of the Benford's law by\nusing a violation parameter, and demonstrate that the violation parameter can\nsignal quantum phase transitions occurring in these models. We also comment on\nthe universality of the statistics of first significant digits corresponding to\nappropriate measures of quantum correlations in the case of multipartite\nsystems as well as systems in higher dimensions.\n", "  Longitudinal space charge (LSC) effects are generally considered harmful in\nfree-electron lasers as they can seed unfavorable energy modulations that can\nresult in density modulations with associated emittance dilution. It was\npointed out, however, that such \"micro-bunching instabilities\" could be\npotentially useful to support the generation of broadband coherent radiation.\nTherefore there has been an increasing interest in devising accelerator beam\nlines capable of controlling LSC induced density modulations. In the present\npaper we augment these previous investigations by combining a grid-less space\ncharge algorithm with the popular particle-tracking program Elegant. This\nhigh-fidelity model of the space charge is used to benchmark conventional LSC\nmodels. We finally employ the developed model to optimize the performance of a\ncascaded longitudinal space charge amplifier using beam parameters comparable\nto the ones achievable at Fermilab Accelerator Science & Technology (FAST)\nfacility currently under commissioning at Fermilab.\n", "  We introduce a technique to calculate thermal conductivity in disordered\nnanostructures: a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of the elastic\nwave equation combined with the Green-Kubo formula. The technique captures\nphonon wave behavior and scales well to nanostructures that are too large or\ntoo surface disordered to simulate with many other techniques. We investigate\nthe role of Rayleigh waves and surface disorder on thermal transport by\nstudying graphenelike nanoribbons with free edges (allowing Rayleigh waves) and\nfixed edges (prohibiting Rayleigh waves). We find that free edges result in a\nsignificantly lower thermal conductivity than fixed ones. Free edges both\nintroduce Rayleigh waves and cause all low-frequency modes (bulk and surface)\nto become more localized. Increasing surface disorder on free edges draws\nenergy away from the center of the ribbon and toward the disordered edges,\nwhere it gets trapped in localized surface modes. These effects are not seen in\nribbons with fixed boundary conditions and illustrate the importance of phonon\nsurface modes in nanostructures.\n", "  We use particle data from the Illustris simulation, combined with individual\nkinematic constraints on the mass of the Milky Way (MW) at specific distances\nfrom the Galactic center, to infer the radial distribution of the MW's dark\nmatter halo mass. Our method allows us to convert any constraint on the mass of\nthe MW within a fixed distance to a full circular velocity profile to the MW's\nvirial radius. As primary examples, we take two recent (and discrepant)\nmeasurements of the total mass within 50 kpc of the Galaxy and find they imply\nvery different mass profiles and stellar masses for the Galaxy. The\ndark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the\neffects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on\nsmall scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to\ndark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower\nat large Galactocentric distances. We are also able to quantify how current and\nfuture constraints on the mass of the MW within specific radii will be\nreflected in uncertainties on its virial mass: even a measurement of M(<50 kpc)\nwith essentially perfect precision still results in a 20% uncertainty on the\nvirial mass of the Galaxy, while a future measurement of M(<100 kpc) with 10%\nerrors would result in the same level of uncertainty. We expect that our\ntechnique will become even more useful as (1) better kinematic constraints\nbecome available at larger distances and (2) cosmological simulations provide\neven more faithful representations of the observable Universe.\n", "  By using relative entropy of coherence, we characterize the coherence gain\ninduced by some quantum evolutions, including the cohering power of unitary\noperations and the decohering power of quantum operations. We find that the\ncohering power of the controlled unitary operation can be reduced to the\ncohering power of the corresponding unitary operation. We observe that the\nglobal coherence generated via incoherent operation applied to the system and\nan incoherent ancilla do not exceed the amount of coherence contained in the\ninitial system. Our result provides a much tighter lower bound of coherence for\nthe initial quantum state, and give an interesting chain of inequalities for\ncoherence, quantum correlation and entanglement. We also strengthen the\nrelations between quantum correlations and coherence.\n", "  The ground-state electronic configuration of three coupled bidimensional\nelectron gases has been determined using a variational Hartree-Fock approach,\nat zero magnetic field. The layers are Coulomb coupled, and tunneling is\npresent between neighboring layers. In the limit of small separation between\nlayers, the tunneling becomes the dominant energy contribution, while for large\ndistance between layers the physics is driven by the Hartree electrostatic\nenergy. Transition from tunneling to hartree dominated physics is shifted\ntowards larger layer separation values as the total bidimensional density of\nthe trilayers decreases. The inter-layer exchange helps in stabilize a\n\"balanced\" configuration, where the three layers are approximately equally\noccupied; most of the experiments are performed in the vicinity of this\nbalanced configuration. Several ground-state configurations are consequence of\na delicate interplay between tunneling and inter-subband exchange.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the effects of vacuum-induced coherence (VIC) on\nmagneto-optical rotation (MOR). We carry out a model study to show that VIC in\nthe presence of a control laser and a magnetic field can lead to large\nenhancement in the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly\npolarized weak laser with vanishing circular dichroism. This effect can be\nrealized in cold molecular gases and may be used as a sensitive probe for VIC.\nSuch a large MOR angle can also be used to detect weak magnetic field with\nlarge measurement sensitivity.\n", "  Motivated by mathematical structures which arise in string vacua and gauge\ntheories with N=2 supersymmetry, we study the properties of certain generalized\ntheta series which appear as Fourier coefficients of functions on a twisted\ntorus. In Calabi-Yau string vacua, such theta series encode instanton\ncorrections from $k$ Neveu-Schwarz five-branes. The theta series are determined\nby vector-valued wave-functions, and in this work we obtain the transformation\nof these wave-functions induced by Kontsevich-Soibelman symplectomorphisms.\nThis effectively provides a quantum version of these transformations, where the\nquantization parameter is inversely proportional to the five-brane charge $k$.\nConsistency with wall-crossing implies a new five-term relation for Faddeev's\nquantum dilogarithm $\\Phi_b$ at $b=1$, which we prove. By allowing the torus to\nbe non-commutative, we obtain a more general five-term relation valid for\narbitrary $b$ and $k$, which may be relevant for the physics of five-branes at\nfinite chemical potential for angular momentum.\n", "  In this Letter we analyze the benefit of digital compensation of fiber\nnonlinearity, where the digital signal processing is divided between the\ntransmitter and receiver. The application of the Gaussian noise model indicates\nthat, where there are two or more spans, it is always beneficial to split the\nnonlinearity compensation. The theory is verified via numerical simulations,\ninvestigating transmission of single channel 50 GBd polarization division\nmultiplexed 256-ary quadrature amplitude modulation over 100 km standard single\nmode fiber spans, using lumped amplification. For this case, the additional\nincrease in mutual information achieved over transmitter- or receiver-side\nnonlinearity compensation is approximately 1 bit for distances greater than\n2000 km. Further, it is shown, theoretically, that the SNR gain for long\ndistances and high bandwidth transmission is 1.5 dB versus transmitter- or\nreceiver-based nonlinearity compensation.\n", "  It is hard to detect important articles in a specific context. Information\nretrieval techniques based on full text search can be inaccurate to identify\nmain topics and they are not able to provide an indication about the importance\nof the article. Generating a citation network is a good way to find most\npopular articles but this approach is not context aware.\n  The text around a citation mark is generally a good summary of the referred\narticle. So citation context analysis presents an opportunity to use the wisdom\nof crowd for detecting important articles in a context sensitive way. In this\nwork, we analyze citation contexts to rank articles properly for a given topic.\nThe model proposed uses citation contexts in order to create a directed and\nweighted citation network based on the target topic. We create a directed and\nweighted edge between two articles if citation context contains terms related\nwith the target topic. Then we apply common ranking algorithms in order to find\nimportant articles in this newly created network. We showed that this method\nsuccessfully detects a good subset of most prominent articles in a given topic.\nThe biggest contribution of this approach is that we are able to identify\nimportant articles for a given search term even though these articles do not\ncontain this search term. This technique can be used in other linked documents\nincluding web pages, legal documents, and patents.\n", "  Due to the absence of tantalising hints for new physics during the LHC's run\n1, the extension of the Higgs sector by dimension six operators will provide\nthe new phenomenological standard for searches of non-resonant extensions of\nthe Standard Model. Using all dominant and subdominant Higgs production\nmechanisms at the LHC, we compute the constraints on Higgs physics-relevant\ndimension six operators in a global and correlated fit. We show in how far\nthese constraints can be improved by new Higgs channels becoming accessible at\nhigher energy and luminosity, both through inclusive cross sections as well as\nthrough highly sensitive differential distributions. This allows us to discuss\nthe sensitivity to new effects in the Higgs sector that can be reached at the\nLHC if direct hints for physics beyond the SM remain elusive and the impact of\nthese constraints on well-motivated BSM scenarios.\n", "  In the background of a flat homogeneous and isotropic space-time, we consider\na scenario of the universe driven by the gravitationally induced `adiabatic'\nparticle production with constant creation rate. We have shown that this\nuniverse attains a big bang singularity in the past and at late-time it\nasymptotically becomes de Sitter. To clarify this model universe, we perform a\ndynamical analysis and found that the universe attains a thermodynamic\nequilibrium in this late de Sitter phase. Finally, for the first time, we have\ndiscussed the possible effects of `adiabatic' particle creations in the context\nof Loop Quantum Cosmology.\n", "  We study nuclear structure properties for various isotopes of Ytterbium (Yb),\nHafnium(Hf), Tungsten(W), Osmium(Os), Platinum(Pt) and Mercury(Hg) in $Z = 70 -\n80$ drip-line region starting from $N =80$ to $N=170$ within the formalism of\nrelativistic mean field (RMF) theory. The pairing correlation is taken care by\nusing BCS approach. We compared our results with Finite Range Droplet\nModel(FRDM) and experimental data and found that the calculated results are in\ngood agreement. Neutron shell closure are obtained at $N=82$ and $126$ in this\nregion. We have also studied probable decay mechanisms of these elements.\n", "  The source-count distribution as a function of their flux, dN/dS, is one of\nthe main quantities characterizing gamma-ray source populations. We employ\nstatistical properties of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) photon counts\nmap to measure the composition of the extragalactic gamma-ray sky at high\nlatitudes (|b|>30 deg) between 1 GeV and 10 GeV. We present a new method,\ngeneralizing the use of standard pixel-count statistics, to decompose the total\nobserved gamma-ray emission into (a) point-source contributions, (b) the\nGalactic foreground contribution, and (c) a truly diffuse isotropic background\ncontribution. Using the 6-year Fermi-LAT data set (P7REP), we show that the\ndN/dS distribution in the regime of so far undetected point sources can be\nconsistently described with a power law of index between 1.9 and 2.0. We\nmeasure dN/dS down to an integral flux of ~2x10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1}, improving\nbeyond the 3FGL catalog detection limit by about one order of magnitude. The\noverall dN/dS distribution is consistent with a broken power law, with a break\nat 2.1^{+1.0}_{-1.3}x10^{-8} cm^{-2}s^{-1}. The power-law index\nn_1=3.1^{+0.7}_{-0.5} for bright sources above the break hardens to\nn_2=1.97+-0.03 for fainter sources below the break. A possible second break of\nthe dN/dS distribution is constrained to be at fluxes below 6.4x10^{-11}\ncm^{-2}s^{-1} at 95% confidence level. The high-latitude gamma-ray sky between\n1 GeV and 10 GeV is shown to be composed of ~25% point sources, ~69.3% diffuse\nGalactic foreground emission, and ~6% isotropic diffuse background.\n", "  In the context of polaritons in a ferrite-semiconductor structure which is\ninfluenced by an external static magnetic field, the gyrotropic-nihility can be\nidentified from the dispersion equation related to bulk polaritons as a\nparticular extreme state, at which the longitudinal component of the\ncorresponding constitutive tensor and bulk constant simultaneously acquire\nzero. Near the frequency of the gyrotropic-nihility state, the conditions of\nbranches merging of bulk polaritons, as well as an anomalous dispersion of bulk\nand surface polaritons are found and discussed.\n", "  It is shown that phase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channels are\nmajorization-preserving over the set of passive states of the harmonic\noscillator. This means that comparable passive states under majorization are\ntransformed into equally comparable passive states. The proof relies on a new\npreorder relation called Fock-majorization, which coincides with regular\nmajorization for passive states but also induces a mean photon number order,\nthereby connecting the concepts of energy and disorder of a quantum state. As\nan application, the consequences of majorization preservation are investigated\nin the context of the broadcast communication capacity of bosonic Gaussian\nchannels. Most of our results being independent of the bosonic nature of the\nsystem under investigation, they could be generalized to other quantum systems\nand Hamiltonians, providing a general tool that could prove useful in quantum\ninformation theory and quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  Transverse momentum spectra of different particles produced in mid-rapidity\ninterval in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions with different centrality intervals,\nmeasured by the ALICE Collaboration at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV, are conformably and approximately described by the\nTsallis distribution. The dependences of parameters (effective temperature,\nentropy index, and normalization factor) on event centrality and particle rest\nmass are obtained. The source temperature at the kinetic freeze-out is obtained\nto be the intercept in the linear relation between effective temperature and\nparticle rest mass, while the particle transverse flow velocity is\napproximately extracted to be the slope in the linear relation between mean\ntransverse momentum and particle rest mass. It is shown that the source\ntemperature increases with increase of particle rest mass, which exhibits an\nevidence of mass dependent differential kinetic freeze-out scenario or multiple\nkinetic freeze-out scenario.\n", "  Within gauge/gravity duality, we study the class of four dimensional CFTs\nwith chiral anomaly described by Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in five\ndimensions. In particular we determine the phase diagram at finite temperature,\nchemical potential and magnetic field. At high temperatures the solution is\ngiven by an electrically and magnetically charged AdS Reissner-Nordstroem black\nbrane. For sufficiently large Chern-Simons coupling and at sufficiently low\ntemperatures and small magnetic fields, we find a new phase with helical order,\nbreaking translational invariance spontaneously. For the Chern-Simons couplings\nstudied, the phase transition is second order with mean field exponents. Since\nthe entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature we are confident\nthat this is the true ground state which is the holographic version of a chiral\nmagnetic spiral.\n", "  In this paper we study static solutions with more general symmetries than the\nspherical symmetry of the five-dimensional Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity. In\nthis context, we study the coupling of the extra bosonic field $% h^{a}$ with\nordinary matter which is quantified by the introduction of an energy-momentum\ntensor field associated with $h^{a}$. It is found that exist (i) a negative\ntangential pressure zone around low-mass distributions ($\\mu <\\mu_{1}$) when\nthe coupling constant $\\alpha $ is greater than zero; (ii) a maximum in the\ntangential pressure, which can be observed in the outer region of a field\ndistribution that satisfies $\\mu <\\mu_{2}$; (iii) solutions that behave like\nthose obtained from models with negative cosmological constant. In such a\nsituation, the field $h^{a}$ plays the role of a cosmological constant.\n", "  Matrix Szego biorthogonal polynomials for quasi-definite matrices of measures\nare studied. For matrices of Holder weights a Riemann-Hilbert problem is\nuniquely solved in terms of the matrix Szego polynomials and its Cauchy\ntransforms. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is given as an appropriate framework\nfor the discussion of the Szego matrix and the associated Szego recursion\nrelations for the matrix orthogonal polynomials and its Cauchy transforms.\nPearson type differential systems characterizing the matrix of weights are\nstudied. These are linear systems of ordinary differential equations which are\nrequired to be monodromy free. Linear ordinary differential equations for the\nmatrix Szego polynomials and its Cauchy transforms are derived. It is shown how\nthese Pearson systems lead to nonlinear difference equations for the Verblunsky\nmatrices and two examples, of Fuchsian and non-Fuchsian type, are considered.\nFor both cases a new matrix version of the discrete Painlev\\'e II equation for\nthe Verblunsky matrices is found. Reductions of these matrix discrete Painleve\nII systems presenting locality are discussed.\n", "  In this work we want to simulate with the Lattice-Boltzmann method in 2D the\ncapillary infiltration into porous structures obtained from the packing of\nparticles. The experimental problem motivating our work is the densification of\ncarbon preforms by reactive melt infiltration. The aim is to determine\noptimization principles for the manufacturing of high-performance ceramics.\nSimulations are performed for packings with varying structural properties. Our\nanalysis suggests that the observed slow infiltrations can be ascribed to\ninterface dynamics. Pinning represents the primary factor retarding fluid\npenetration. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is analyzed in\ndetail. When surface growth is allowed, it is found that the phenomenon of\npinning becomes stronger. Systems trying to reproduce typical experimental\nconditions are also investigated. It turns out that the standard for accurate\nsimulations is challenging. The primary obstacle to overcome for enhanced\naccuracy seems to be the over-occurrence of pinning.\n", "  Membranes of suspended two-dimensional materials show a large variability in\nmechanical properties, in part due to static and dynamic wrinkles. As a\nconsequence, experiments typically show a multitude of nanomechanical resonance\npeaks, which makes an unambiguous identification of the vibrational modes\ndifficult. Here, we probe the motion of graphene nanodrum resonators with\nspatial resolution using a phase-sensitive interferometer. By simultaneously\nvisualizing the local phase and amplitude of the driven motion, we show that\nunexplained spectral features represent split degenerate modes. When taking\nthese into account, the resonance frequencies up to the eighth vibrational mode\nagree with theory. The corresponding displacement profiles however, are\nremarkably different from theory, as small imperfections increasingly deform\nthe nodal lines for the higher modes. The Brownian motion, which is used to\ncalibrate the local displacement, exhibits a similar mode pattern. The\nexperiments clarify the complicated dynamic behaviour of suspended\ntwo-dimensional materials, which is crucial for reproducible fabrication and\napplications.\n", "  Driven diffusive systems such as the zero-range process (ZRP) and the\npair-factorized steady states (PFSS) stochastic transport process are versatile\ntools that lend themselves to the study of transport phenomena on a generic\nlevel. While their mathematical structure is simple enough to allow significant\nanalytical treatment, they offer a variety of interesting phenomena. With\nappropriate dynamics, the ZRP and PFSS models feature a condensation transition\nwhere for a supercritical density the translational symmetry breaks\nspontaneously and excess particles form a single-site or spatially extended\ncondensate, respectively. In this paper we numerically study the typical time\nscales of the two stages of this condensation process: Nucleation and\ncoarsening. Nucleation is the first stage of condensation where the bulk system\nrelaxes to its stationary distribution and droplet nuclei form in the system.\nThese droplets then gradually grow or evaporate in the coarsening regime to\nfinally coalesce in a single condensate when the system finally relaxes to the\nstationary state.\n  We use the ZRP condensation model to discuss the choice of the estimation\nmethod for the nucleation time scale and present scaling exponents for the ZRP\nand PFSS condensation models with respect to the choice of the typical droplet\nmass. We then proceed to present scaling exponents in the coarsening regime of\nthe ZRP for partial-asymmetric dynamics and the PFSS model for symmetric and\nasymmetric dynamics.\n", "  We provide explicit upper bounds for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a\nfinite metric tree subject to standard vertex conditions. The results include\nestimates depending on the average length of the edges or the diameter. In\nparticular, we establish a sharp upper bound for the spectral gap, i.e. the\nsmallest positive eigenvalue, and show that equilateral star graphs are the\nunique maximizers of the spectral gap among all trees of a given average\nlength.\n", "  We study the polarization dynamics of a spatially expanding polariton\ncondensate under nonresonant linearly polarized optical excitation. The\nspatially and temporally resolved polariton emission reveals the formation of\nnon-trivial spin textures in the form of a quadruplet polarization pattern both\nin the linear and circular Stokes parameters, and an octuplet in the diagonal\nStokes parameter. The continuous rotation of the polariton pseudospin vector\nthrough the condensate due to TE-TM splitting exhibits an ordered pattern of\nhalf-skyrmions associated with a half-integer topological number. A theoretical\nmodel based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with an\nexciton reservoir describes the dynamics of the nontrivial spin textures\nthrough the optical spin-Hall effect.\n", "  We describe space-time using split octonions over the reals and use their\ngroup of automorphisms, the non-compact form of Cartan's exceptional Lie group\nG2, as the main geometrical group of the model. Connections of the G2-rotations\nof octonionic 8D space with the conformal transformations in 4D Minkowski\nspace-time are studied. It is shown that the dimensional constant needed in\nthese analysis naturally gives the observed value of the cosmological constant.\n", "  We study the correlation functions of su(2) invariant spin-s chains in the\nthermodynamic limit. We derive non-linear integral equations for an auxiliary\ncorrelation function $\\omega$ for any spin s and finite temperature T. For the\nspin-3/2 chain for arbitrary temperature and zero magnetic field we obtain\nalgebraic expressions for the reduced density matrix of two-sites. In the zero\ntemperature limit, the density matrix elements are evaluated analytically and\nappear to be given in terms of Riemann's zeta function values of even and odd\narguments.\n", "  We apply the confluent Heun functions to study the resonant frequencies\n(quasispectrum), the Hawking radiation and the scattering process of scalar\nwaves, in a class of spacetimes, namely, the ones generated by a\nKerr-Newman-Kasuya spacetime (dyon black hole) and a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nblack hole surrounded by a magnetic field (Ernst spacetime). In both\nspacetimes, the solutions for the angular and radial parts of the corresponding\nKlein-Gordon equations are obtained exactly, for massive and massless fields,\nrespectively. The special cases of Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes are\nanalyzed and the solutions obtained, as well as in the case of a Schwarzschild\nblack hole surrounded by a magnetic field. In all these special situations, the\nresonant frequencies, Hawking radiation and scattering are studied.\n", "  We apply the confluent Heun functions to study the resonant frequencies\n(quasispectrum), the Hawking radiation and the scattering process of scalar\nwaves, in a class of spacetimes, namely, the ones generated by a\nKerr-Newman-Kasuya spacetime (dyon black hole) and a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nblack hole surrounded by a magnetic field (Ernst spacetime).

A rapidly evolving and luminous event, it showed\neffectively hydrogen-free spectra dominated by relatively narrow helium P-Cygni\nspectral features and it was classified as a SN Ibn. In this paper we present\nphotometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2015U,\nincluding a Keck/DEIMOS spectrum (resolution $\\approx$ 5000) which fully\nresolves the optical emission and absorption features. We find that SN 2015U is\nbest understood via models of shock breakout from extended and dense\ncircumstellar material (CSM), likely created by a history of mass loss from the\nprogenitor with an extreme outburst within $\\sim$1-2 yr of core collapse (but\nwe do not detect any outburst in our archival imaging of NGC 2388). We argue\nthat the high luminosity of SN 2015U was powered not through $^{56}$Ni decay\nbut via the deposition of kinetic energy into the ejecta/CSM shock interface.\nThough our analysis is hampered by strong host-galaxy dust obscuration (which\nlikely exhibits multiple components), our dataset makes SN 2015U one of the\nbest-studied Type Ibn supernovae and provides a bridge of understanding to\nother rapidly fading transients, both luminous and relatively faint.\n", "  Polycrystalline samples of four intermetallic compounds: MV$_2$Al$_{20}$ (M =\nSc, Y, La, and Lu) were synthesized using an arc-melting technique. The crystal\nstructures were analyzed by means of powder x-ray diffraction and Rietveld\nanalysis, and the physical properties were studied by means of heat capacity,\nelectrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 0.4 K.\nFor ScV$_2$Al$_{20}$, LuV$_2$Al$_{20}$, and YV$_2$Al$_{20}$, superconductivity\nwas observed with critical temperatures T$_c$ = 1.00 K, 0.57 K, and 0.60 K,\nrespectively. Superconductivity for the Lu compound is reported for the first\ntime. Theoretical calculations of the electronic and phonon structures were\nconducted in order to analyze the superconductivity and dynamics in\nScV$_2$Al$_{20}$, YV$_2$Al$_{20}$, and LuV$_2$Al$_{20}$ and to explain the lack\nof a superconducting transition in LaV$_2$Al$_{20}$ down to 0.4 K. The results\nof the experimental and theoretical studies show that all the compounds are\nweakly-coupled type II BCS superconductors, and reveal the importance of the\nM-atom anharmonic \"rattling\" modes for the superconductivity in these\nmaterials, which seem to enhance T$_c$, especially for ScV$_2$Al$_{20}$.\n", "  The strong coupling regime is observed in a system of two-dimensional\nelectrons whose cyclotron motion is coupled to an electro-magnetic mode in a\nFabry-Perot cavity resonator. The Rabi splitting of eigenfrequencies of coupled\nmotion is observed both in the cavity reflection spectrum and ac current of\nelectrons, the latter probed by measuring their bolometric photoresponse.\nDespite the fact that similar observations of the Rabi splitting in\nmany-particle systems have been described as a quantum-mechanical effect, we\nshow that the observed splitting can be explained completely by a model based\non the classical electrodynamics.\n", "  Synchronous laser-microwave networks delivering attosecond timing precision\nare highly desirable in many advanced applications, such as geodesy,\nvery-long-baseline interferometry, high-precision navigation and\nmulti-telescope arrays. In particular, rapidly expanding photon science\nfacilities like X-ray free-electron lasers and intense laser beamlines require\nsystem-wide attosecond-level synchronization of dozens of optical and microwave\nsignals up to kilometer distances. Once equipped with such precision, these\nfacilities will initiate radically new science by shedding light on molecular\nand atomic processes happening on the attosecond timescale, such as\nintramolecular charge transfer, Auger processes and their impact on X-ray\nimaging. Here, we present for the first time a complete synchronous\nlaser-microwave network with attosecond precision, which is achieved through\nnew metrological devices and careful balancing of fiber nonlinearities and\nfundamental noise contributions. We demonstrate timing stabilization of a\n4.7-km fiber network and remote optical-optical synchronization across a 3.5-km\nfiber link with an overall timing jitter of 580 and 680 attoseconds RMS,\nrespectively, for over 40 hours. Ultimately we realize a complete\nlaser-microwave network with 950-attosecond timing jitter for 18 hours. This\nwork can enable next-generation attosecond photon-science facilities to\nrevolutionize many research fields from structural biology to material science\nand chemistry to fundamental physics.\n", "  In this work we present a micromagnetic study of the performance potential of\nbit-patterned (BP) magnetic recording media via joint optimization of the\ndesign of the media and of the magnetic write heads. Because the design space\nis large and complex, we developed a novel computational framework suitable for\nparallel implementation on compute clusters. Our technique combines advanced\nglobal optimization algorithms and finite-element micromagnetic solvers.\nTargeting data bit densities of $4\\mathrm{Tb}/\\mathrm{in}^2$, we optimize\ndesigns for centered, staggered, and shingled BP writing. The magnetization\ndynamics of the switching of the exchange-coupled composite BP islands of the\nmedia is treated micromagnetically. Our simulation framework takes into account\nnot only the dynamics of on-track errors but also of the thermally induced\nadjacent-track erasure. With co-optimized write heads, the results show\nsuperior performance of shingled BP magnetic recording where we identify two\nparticular designs achieving write bit-error rates of $1.5\\mathrm{x}10^{-8}$\nand $8.4\\mathrm{x}10^{-8}$, respectively. A detailed description of the key\ndesign features of these designs is provided and contrasted with centered and\nstaggered BP designs which yielded write bit error rates of only\n$2.8\\mathrm{x}10^{-3}$ (centered design) and $1.7\\mathrm{x}10^{-2}$ (staggered\ndesign) even under optimized conditions.\n", "  When two qubits A and B are in an appropriate state, Alice can remotely steer\nBob's system B into different ensembles by making different measurements on A.\nThis famous phenomenon is known as quantum steering, or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nsteering. Importantly, quantum steering establishes the correspondence not only\nbetween a measurement on A (made by Alice) and an ensemble of B (owned by Bob)\nbut also between each of Alice's measurement outcomes and an unnormalized\nconditional state of Bob's system. The unnormalized conditional states of B\ncorresponding to all possible measurement outcomes of Alice are called Alice's\nsteering outcomes. We show that, surprisingly, the $4$-dimensional geometry of\nAlice's steering outcomes completely determines both the non-separability of\nthe two-qubit state and its steerability from her side. Consequently, the\nproblem of classifying two-qubit states into non-separable and steerable\nclasses is equivalent to geometrically classifying certain $4$-dimensional\nskewed double-cones.\n", "  We study the ground state phase diagram of the quantum spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg\nmodel on the kagom\\'{e} lattice with first- ($J_1 < 0$), second- ($J_2 < 0$),\nand third-neighbor interactions ($J_d > 0$) by means of analytical low-energy\nfield theory and numerical density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies.\nThe results offer a consistent picture of the $J_d$-dominant regime in terms of\nthree sets of spin chains weakly coupled by the ferromagnetic inter-chain\ninteractions $J_{1,2}$. When either $J_1$ or $J_2$ is dominant, the model is\nfound to support one of two cuboctohedral phases, cuboc1 and cuboc2. These\ncuboc states host non-coplanar long-ranged magnetic order and possess finite\nscalar spin chirality. However, in the compensated regime $J_1 \\simeq J_2$, a\nvalence bond crystal phase emerges between the two cuboc phases. We find\nexcellent agreement between an analytical theory based on coupled spin chains\nand unbiased DMRG calculations, including at a very detailed level of\ncomparison of the structure of the valence bond crystal state. To our\nknowledge, this is the first such comprehensive understanding of a highly\nfrustrated two-dimensional (2d) quantum antiferromagnet. We find no evidence of\neither the one-dimensional (1d) gapless spin liquid or the chiral spin liquids,\nwhich were previously suggested by parton mean field theories.\n", "  The concept of a \"trapped rainbow\" has generated considerable interest for\noptical data storage and processing. It aims to trap different frequency\ncomponents of the wave packet at different positions permanently. However, all\nthe previously proposed structures cannot truly achieve this effect, due to the\ndifficulties in suppressing the reflection caused by strong intermodal coupling\nand distinguishing different frequency components simultaneously. In this\narticle, we found a physical mechanism to achieve a truly \"trapped rainbow\"\nstorage of electromagnetic wave. We utilize nonreciprocal waveguides under a\ntapered magnetic field to achieve this and such a trapping effect is stable\neven under fabrication disorders. We also observe hot spots and relatively long\nduration time of the trapped wave around critical positions through frequency\ndomain and time domain simulations. The physical mechanism we found has a\nvariety of potential applications ranging from wave harvesting and storage to\nnonlinearity enhancement.\n", "  Motivated by recent observation of magnetic field induced transition in\nLaCoO3 we study the effect of external field in systems close to instabilities\ntowards spin-state ordering and exciton condensation. We show that, while in\nboth cases the transition can be induced by an external field, temperature\ndependencies of the critical field have opposite slopes. Based on this result\nwe argue that the experimental observations select the exciton condensation\nscenario. We show that such condensation is possible due to high mobility of\nthe intermediate spin excitations. The estimated width of the corresponding\ndispersion is large enough to overrule the order of atomic multiplets and to\nmake the intermediate spin excitation propagating with a specific wave vector\nthe lowest excitation of the system.\n", "  In this paper we present a spectral decomposition of solutions to\nrelativistic wave equations described on horizon penetrating hyperboloidal\nslices within a given Schwarzschild-black-hole background. The wave equa- tion\nin question is Laplace-transformed which leads to a spatial differential\nequation with a complex parameter. For initial data which are analytic with\nrespect to a compactified spatial coordinate, this equation is treated with the\nhelp of the Mathematica-package in terms of a sophisticated Taylor series\nanalysis. Thereby, all ingredients of the desired spectral decomposition arise\nexplicitly to arbitrarily prescribed accuracy, including quasi normal modes,\nquasi normal mode amplitudes as well as the jump of the Laplace-transform along\nthe branch cut. Finally, all contributions are put together to obtain via the\ninverse Laplace transformation the spectral de- composition in question. The\npaper explains extensively this procedure and includes detailed discussions of\nrelevant aspects, such as the definition of quasi normal modes and the question\nregarding the contribution of infinity frequencies modes to the early time\nresponse of the black hole.\n", "  We explored a Higgs inflationary scenario in the SUGRA embedding of the MSSM\nin Einstein frame where the inflaton is contained in the $SU(2)$ Higgs doublet.\nWe include all higher order non-renormalizable terms to the MSSM superpotential\nand an appropriate K\\\"ahler potential which can provide slow-roll inflaton\npotential in the $D-$flat direction. In this model, a plateau-like inflation\npotential can be obtained if the imaginary part of the neutral Higgs acts as\nthe inflaton. The inflationary predictions of this model are consistent with\nthe latest CMB observations. The model represents a successful Higgs inflation\nscenario in the context of Supergravity and it is compatible with Minimal\nSupersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies in\na particular Horndeski model with Galileon shift symmetry, containing also a\n$\\Lambda$-term and a matter. The model, sometimes called Fab Five, admits a\nrich spectrum of solutions. Some of them describe the standard late time\ncosmological dynamic dominated by the $\\Lambda$-term and matter, while at the\nearly times the universe expands with a constant Hubble rate determined by the\nvalue of the scalar kinetic coupling. For other solutions the $\\Lambda$-term\nand matter are screened at all times but there are nevertheless the early and\nlate accelerating phases. The model also admits bounces, as well as peculiar\nsolutions describing \"the emergence of time\". Most of these solutions contain\nghosts in the scalar and tensor sectors. However, a careful analysis reveals\nthree different branches of ghost-free solutions, all showing a late time\nacceleration phase. We analyze the dynamical stability of these solutions and\nfind that all of them are stable in the future, since all their perturbations\nstay bounded at late times. However, they all turn out to be unstable in the\npast, as their perturbations grow violently when one approaches the initial\nspacetime singularity. We therefore conclude that the model has no viable\nsolutions describing the whole of the cosmological history, although it may\ndescribe the current acceleration phase. We also check that the flat space\nsolution is ghost-free in the model, but it may acquire ghost in more general\nversions of the Horndeski theory.\n", "  Particles trapped in the evanescent field of an ultrathin optical fibre\ninter-act over very long distances via multiple scattering of the fibre-guided\nfields. In ultrathin fibres that support higher order modes, these\ninterac-tions are stronger and exhibit qualitatively new behaviour due to the\ncou-pling of different fibre modes, which have different propagation\nwave-vectors, by the particles. Here, we study one dimensional longitudinal\nopti-cal binding interactions of chains of 3 {\\mu}m polystyrene spheres under\nthe influence of the evanescent fields of a two-mode microfibre. The\nobserva-tion of long-range interactions, self-ordering and speed variation of\nparti-cle chains reveals strong optical binding effects between the particles\nthat can be modelled well by a tritter scattering-matrix approach. The optical\nforces, optical binding interactions and the velocity of bounded particle\nchains are calculated using this method. Results show good agreement with\nfinite element numerical simulations. Experimental data and theoreti-cal\nanalysis show that higher order modes in a microfibre offer a promis-ing method\nto not only obtain stable, multiple particle trapping or faster particle\npropulsion speeds, but that they also allow for better control over each\nindividual trapped object in particle ensembles near the microfibre surface.\n", "  We study mass loss from the outer Lagrange point (L2) in binary stellar\nmergers and their luminous transients by means of radiative hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Previously, we showed that for binary mass ratios 0.06 < q < 0.8,\nsynchronous L2 mass loss results in a radiatively inefficient, dust-forming\nunbound equatorial outflow. A similar outflow exists irrespective of q if the\nratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is\nsufficiently large, \\epsilon = c_T/v_orb > 0.15. By contrast, for cold L2\nmass-loss (\\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the\nequatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the\nbinary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional\ntidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows. In all cases, the radiated\nluminosity reaches a fraction ~0.01 to 0.1 of Mdot v_orb^2/2, where Mdot is the\nmass outflow rate. We discuss the implications of our results for transients in\nthe luminosity gap between classical novae and supernovae, such as V1309 Sco\nand V838 Mon.\n", "  We study numerically the evolution of Bose-Einstein condensate in the Sinai\noscillator trap described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions.\nIn the absence of interactions this trap mimics the properties of Sinai\nbilliards where the classical dynamics is chaotic and the quantum evolution is\ndescribed by generic properties of quantum chaos and random matrix theory. We\nshow that, above a certain border, the nonlinear interactions between atoms\nlead to the emergence of dynamical thermalization which generates the\nstatistical Bose-Einstein distribution over eigenmodes of the system without\ninteractions. Below the thermalization border the evolution remains\nquasi-integrable. Such a Sinai oscillator trap, formed by the oscillator\npotential and a repulsive disk located in the vicinity of the center, had been\nalready realized in rst experiments with the Bose-Einstein condensate formation\nby Ketterle group in 1995 and we argue that it can form a convenient test bed\nfor experimental investigations of dynamical of thermalization. Possible links\nand implications for Kolmogorov turbulence in absence of noise are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Thanks to the impressive progress of conformal bootstrap methods we have now\nvery precise estimates of both scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients for\nseveral 3D universality classes. We show how to use this information to obtain\nsimilarly precise estimates for off-critical correlators using conformal\nperturbation. We discuss in particular the $< \\sigma (r) \\sigma (0) >$, $<\n\\epsilon (r) \\epsilon (0) >$ and $< \\sigma (r) \\epsilon (0) >$ two point\nfunctions in the high and low temperature regimes of the 3D Ising model and\nevaluate the leading and next to leading terms in the $s = t r^{\\Delta_{t}}$\nexpansion, where $t$ is the reduced temperature. Our results for $< \\sigma (r)\n\\sigma (0) >$ agree both with Monte Carlo simulations and with a set of\nexperimental estimates of the critical scattering function.\n", "  We report 1212 radial-velocity (RV) measurements obtained in the years\n2009-2013 using an iodine cell for the spectroscopic binary nu Octantis\n(K1III/IV). This system (a_bin~2.6 au, P~1050 days) is conjectured to have a\nJovian planet with a semi-major axis half that of the binary host. The extreme\ngeometry only permits long-term stability if the planet is in a retrograde\norbit. Whilst the reality of the planet (P~415 days) remains uncertain, other\nscenarios (stellar variability or apsidal motion caused by a yet unobserved\nthird star) continue to appear substantially less credible based on CCF\nbisectors, line-depth ratios and many other independent details. If this\nevidence is validated but the planet is disproved, the claims of other planets\nusing RVs will be seriously challenged.\n  We also describe a significant revision to the previously published RVs and\nthe full set of 1437 RVs now encompasses nearly 13 years. The sensitive orbital\ndynamics allow us to constrain the three-dimensional architecture with a broad\nprior probability distribution on the mutual inclination, which with posterior\nsamples obtained from an N-body Markov chain Monte Carlo is found to be 158.4\n+/- 1.2 deg. None of these samples are dynamically stable beyond 1 Myr.\nHowever, a grid search around the best-fitting solution finds a region that has\nmany models stable for 10 Myr, and includes one model within 1-sigma that is\nstable for at least 100 Myr. The planet's exceptional nature demands robust\nindependent verification and makes the theoretical understanding of its\nformation a worthy challenge.\n", "  The C60 molecule has been recently detected in a wide range of astrophysical\nenvironments through its four active intramolecular vibrational modes (T1u)\nnear 18.9, 17.4, 8.5, and 7.0 microns. The strengths of the mid-infrared\nemission bands have been used to infer astrophysical conditions in the\nfullerene-rich regions. Widely varying values of the relative intrinsic\nstrengths (RIS) of these four bands are reported in laboratory and theoretical\npapers, which impedes the derivation of the excitation mechanism of C60 in the\nastrophysical sources. The spectroscopic analysis of the C60 samples produced\nwith our method delivers highly reproducible RIS values of 100, 25 +- 1, 26 +-\n1, and 40 +- 4. A comparison of the inferred C60 emission band strengths with\nthe astrophysical data shows that the observed strengths cannot be explained in\nterms of fluorescent or thermal emission alone. The large range in the observed\n17.4/18.9 emission ratios indicates that either the emission bands contain\nsignificant contributions from emitters other than C60, or that the population\ndistribution among the C60 vibrational modes is affected by physical processes\nother than thermal or UV excitation, such as chemo-luminescence from nascent\nC60 or possibly, Poincare fluorescence resulting from an inverse internal\nenergy conversion. We have carefully analyzed the effect of the weakly-active\nfundamental modes and second order modes in the mid-infrared spectrum of C60\nand propose that neutral C60 is the carrier of the unidentified emission band\nat 6.49 microns which has been observed in fullerene-rich environments.\n", "  We argue that dark matter and dark energy phenomena associated with galactic\nrotation curves, X-ray cluster mass profiles, and type Ia supernova data can be\naccounted for via small corrections to idealized general relativistic spacetime\ngeometries due to disordered locality. Accordingly, we fit THINGS rotation\ncurve data rivaling modified Newtonian dynamics, ROSAT/ASCA X-ray cluster mass\nprofile data rivaling metric-skew-tensor gravity, and SCP Union2.1 SN Ia data\nrivaling $\\Lambda$CDM without non-baryonic dark matter or a cosmological\nconstant. In the case of dark matter, we geometrically modify proper mass\ninterior to the Schwarzschild solution. In the case of dark energy, we modify\nproper distance in Einstein-deSitter cosmology. Therefore, the phenomena of\ndark matter and dark energy may be chimeras created by an errant belief that\nspacetime is a differentiable manifold rather than a disordered graph.\n", "  We present results from the the first campaign of dedicated solar\nobservations undertaken by the \\textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray}\n({\\em NuSTAR}) hard X-ray telescope. Designed as an astrophysics mission, {\\em\nNuSTAR} nonetheless has the capability of directly imaging the Sun at hard\nX-ray energies ($>$3~keV) with an increase in sensitivity of at least two\nmagnitude compared to current non-focusing telescopes. In this paper we\ndescribe the scientific areas where \\textit{NuSTAR} will make major\nimprovements on existing solar measurements. We report on the techniques used\nto observe the Sun with \\textit{NuSTAR}, their limitations and complications,\nand the procedures developed to optimize solar data quality derived from our\nexperience with the initial solar observations. These first observations are\nbriefly described, including the measurement of the Fe K-shell lines in a\ndecaying X-class flare, hard X-ray emission from high in the solar corona, and\nfull-disk hard X-ray images of the Sun.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the effect of a magnetic field on intersubband\npolaritons in an asymmetric quantum well placed inside an optical resonator. It\nis demonstrated that the field-induced diamagnetic shift of electron subbands\nin the well increases the broadening of optical lines corresponding to\nintersubband electron transitions. As a consequence, the magnetic field can\nswitch the polariton system from the regime of strong light-matter coupling to\nthe regime of weak one. This effect paves a way to the effective control of\npolaritonic devices with a magnetic field.\n", "  We review some essential aspects of classically integrable systems. The\ndetailed outline of the lectures consists of: 1. Introduction and motivation,\nwith historical remarks; 2. Liouville theorem and action-angle variables, with\nexamples (harmonic oscillator, Kepler problem); 3. Algebraic tools: Lax pairs,\nmonodromy and transfer matrices, classical r-matrices and exchange relations,\nnon-ultralocal Poisson brackets, with examples (non-linear Schroedinger model,\nprincipal chiral field); 4. Features of classical r-matrices: Belavin-Drinfeld\ntheorems, analyticity properties, and lift of the classical structures to\nquantum groups; 5. Classical inverse scattering method to solve integrable\ndifferential equations: soliton solutions, spectral properties and the\nGel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko equation, with examples (KdV equation, Sine-Gordon\nmodel). Prepared for the Durham Young Researchers Integrability School,\norganised by the GATIS network. This is part of a collection of lecture notes.\n", "  We introduce a network valuation model (hereafter NEVA) for the ex-ante\nvaluation of claims among financial institutions connected in a network of\nliabilities. Similar to previous work, the new framework allows to endogenously\ndetermine the recovery rate on all claims upon the default of some\ninstitutions. In addition, it also allows to account for ex-ante uncertainty on\nthe asset values, in particular the one arising when the valuation is carried\nout at some time before the maturity of the claims. The framework encompasses\nas special cases both the ex-post approaches of Eisenberg and Noe and its\nprevious extensions, as well as the ex-ante approaches, in the sense that each\nof these models can be recovered exactly for special values of the parameters.\nWe characterize the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the valuation\nproblem under general conditions on how the value of each claim depends on the\nequity of the counterparty. Further, we define an algorithm to carry out the\nnetwork valuation and we provide sufficient conditions for convergence to the\nmaximal solution.\n", "  The role of the generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in higher spatial\ndimensions and by incorporating spin degrees of freedom is systematically\nexplored for a system of interacting fermions confined by a harmonic trap.\nPhysical relevance of the GPCs is confirmed by analytical means for the ground\nstate in the regime of weak couplings by finding its vector of natural\noccupation numbers close to the boundary of the allowed region. Such\nquasipinning is found to become weaker in the intermediate and strong coupling\nregime. The study of crossovers between different spatial dimensions by\ndetuning the harmonic trap frequencies suggests that quasipinning is\nessentially an effect for systems with reduced spatial dimensionality. In\naddition, we find that quasipinning becomes stronger by increasing the degree\nof spin-polarization. Consequently, the number of states available around the\nFermi level plays a key role for the occurrence of quasipinning. This suggests\nthat quasipinning emerges from the conflict between energy minimization and\nfermionic exchange symmetry.\n", "  We propose a consistent analytic approach to the efficiency of collisional\nPenrose process in the vicinity of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole. We\nfocus on a collision with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy, which occurs\nif either of the colliding particles has its angular momentum fine-tuned to the\ncritical value to enter the horizon. We show that if the fine-tuned particle is\ningoing on the collision, the upper limit of the efficiency is\n$(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{2})\\simeq 2.186$, while if the fine-tuned particle is\nbounced back before the collision, the upper limit is $(2+\\sqrt{3})^{2}\\simeq\n13.93$. Despite earlier claims, the former can be attained for inverse Compton\nscattering if the fine-tuned particle is massive and starts at rest at\ninfinity, while the latter can be attained for various particle reactions, such\nas inverse Compton scattering and pair annihilation, if the fine-tuned particle\nis either massless or highly relativistic at infinity. We discuss the\ndifference between the present and earlier analyses.\n", "  In Hall's reformulation of the uncertainty principle, the entropic\nuncertainty relation occupies a core position and provides the first nontrivial\nbound for the information exclusion principle. Based upon recent developments\non the uncertainty relation, we present new bounds for the information\nexclusion relation using majorization theory and combinatoric techniques, which\nreveal further characteristic properties of the overlap matrix between the\nmeasurements.\n", "  Let $X$ be a complex projective variety with only canonical singularities and\nwith trivial canonical bundle. Let $L$ be an ample line bundle on $X$. Assume\nthat the pair $(X,L)$ is the flat limit of a family of smooth polarized\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. Assume that for each singular point $x \\in X$ there exist\na Kahler-Einstein Fano manifold $Z$ and a positive integer $q$ dividing $K_Z$\nsuch that $-\\frac{1}{q}K_Z$ is very ample and such that the germ $(X,x)$ is\nlocally analytically isomorphic to a neighborhood of the vertex of the\nblow-down of the zero section of $\\frac{1}{q}K_{Z}$. We prove that up to\nbiholomorphism, the unique weak Ricci-flat Kahler metric representing $2\\pi\nc_1(L)$ on $X$ is asymptotic at a polynomial rate near $x$ to the natural\nRicci-flat Kahler cone metric on $\\frac{1}{q}K_Z$ constructed using the Calabi\nansatz. In particular, our result applies if $(X, \\mathcal{O}(1))$ is a nodal\nquintic threefold in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. This provides the first known examples of\ncompact Ricci-flat manifolds with non-orbifold isolated conical singularities.\n", "  We explore the dynamics and evolution of the Universe at early and late\ntimes, focusing on both dark energy and extended gravity models and their\nastrophysical and cosmological consequences. Modified theories of gravity not\nonly provide an alternative explanation for the recent expansion history of the\nuniverse, but they also offer a paradigm fundamentally distinct from the\nsimplest dark energy models of cosmic acceleration. In this review, we perform\na detailed theoretical and phenomenological analysis of different modified\ngravity models and investigate their consistency. We also consider the\ncosmological implications of well motivated physical models of the early\nuniverse with a particular emphasis on inflation and topological defects.\nAstrophysical and cosmological tests over a wide range of scales, from the\nsolar system to the observable horizon, severely restrict the allowed models of\nthe Universe. Here, we review several observational probes -- including\ngravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background temperature\nand polarization, supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements --\nand their relevance in constraining our cosmological description of the\nUniverse.\n", "  Using the time dependences for the decays Y(4S) to B0B0bar to (ell^+- X)(c\ncbar K_S,L), we determine the three CPT-sensitive parameters Re (z) and Im (z)\nin B0-B0bar mixing and |Abar/A| in B0 to c cbar K0 decays. We find Im(z) =\n0.010 +- 0.030 +- 0013, Re(z) = -0:065 +- 0.028 +- 0.014, and |Abar/A| = 0.999\n+- 0.023 +- 0.017, in agreement with CPT symmetry. The Re(z) result provides a\nlimit on one component of Lorentz-symmetry violation.\n", "  We show that by representing quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering\nfrom propylene carbonate (PC) with an explicitly heterogeneous model, we\nrecover two distinct dynamic signatures in addition to diffusive motion. The\nintermediate scattering function provides access to the time-dependence of\nthese two dynamic processes, and they appear to correspond to transitions\nbetween inherent states and between metabasins on a potential energy landscape.\nBy fitting the full q-dependence of inelastic scattering, we confirm that that\nthe Johari-Goldstein ($\\beta_{JG}$) relaxation in PC is indistinguishable from\nmetabasin transitions.\n", "  Solar active regions (ARs) are the major sources of two kinds of the most\nviolent solar eruptions, namely flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The\nlargest AR in the past 24 years, NOAA AR 12192, crossed the visible disk from\n2014 October 17 to 30, unusually produced more than one hundred flares,\nincluding 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but only one small CME. Flares and\nCMEs are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process. Why is such\na flare-rich AR so CME-poor? We compared this AR with other four ARs; two were\nproductive in both and two were inert. The investigation of the photospheric\nparameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram reveals that the flare-rich\nAR 12192, as the other two productive ARs, has larger magnetic flux, current\nand free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs, but contrast to the two\nproductive ARs, it has no strong, concentrated current helicity along both\nsides of the flaring neutral line, indicating the absence of a mature magnetic\nstructure consisting of highly sheared or twisted field lines. Furthermore, the\ndecay index above the AR 12192 is relatively low, showing strong constraint.\nThese results suggest that productive ARs are always large and have enough\ncurrent and free energy to power flares, but whether or not a flare is\naccompanied by a CME is seemingly related to (1) if there is mature sheared or\ntwisted core field serving as the seed of the CME, (2) if the constraint of the\noverlying arcades is weak enough.\n", "  We consider a spherically symmetric internal solution within the context of\nEinstein-Chern-Simons gravity and derive a generalized five-dimensional\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. It is shown that the generalized TOV\nequation leads, in a certain limit, to the standard five-dimensional TOV\nequation\n", "  We initiate the study of M-strings in the thermodynamic limit. In this limit\nthe BPS partition function of M5 branes localizes on configurations with a\nlarge number of strings which leads to a reformulation of the partition\nfunction in terms of a matrix model. We solve this matrix model and obtain its\nspectral curve which can be interpreted as the Seiberg-Witten curve associated\nto the compactified M5 brane theory.\n", "  We present a new implementation of quantum computation that treats quantum\ncomputers as a special type of Bayesian Network called a QuDot Net. QuDot Nets\nallow for the efficient representation of some qubit systems. Single qubit\nquantum gates can be implemented as edge transformations on QuDot Nets. The X,\nH, R(k), M and SWAP gates are discussed in detail and results show linear\nscaling as the number of qubits are increased. We show that measurement and\nsemi-quantum control gates can be efficiently implemented using QuDot Nets and\npresent results from a QuDot Net implementation of the terminal Quantum Fourier\nTransform. We show how QuDot Nets can implement coherent control gates using\nmulti-digraphs by labelling parallel edges. Lastly, we discuss implications to\nquantum foundations if a classical implementation of quantum computation is\nrealized.\n", "  In this work I outline a general procedure for dynamic modeling and stability\nanalysis of a magnetic bearing, which is a rotating shaft confined inside a\nchamber through electromagnetic forces alone. I consider the simplest type of\nself-propelled bearing, namely a permanent magnet synchronous motor and an\ninduction motor rotor freely suspended inside the corresponding stator, and\nhaving no eccentricity-fedback control algorithm. Writing Euler's equations for\nthe rotor mechanics and Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field leads\nto a systematic technique for analysing the dynamics of the complete system.\nPhysical arguments indicate that that two essential components for rotor\nconfinement are a spatial gradient in the stator magnetic field and a torque\nangle lying in the second quadrant. These predictions are confirmed through the\nlinear stability analysis. The direct practical utility of the results is\nmitigated by the presence of a repeated eigenvalue in the linearized equations.\nDespite this limitation, the analysis presented can act as a good starting\npoint for more accurate treatments of other magnetic bearing configurations.\n", "  We present sources selected from their Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) colors that merit future observations to image for disks and possible\nexoplanet companions. Introducing a weighted detection method, we eliminated\nthe enormous number of specious excess seen in low signal to noise objects by\nrequiring greater excess for fainter stars. This is achieved by sorting through\nthe 747 million sources of the ALLWISE database. In examining these dim stars,\nit can be shown that a non-Gaussian distribution best describes the spread\naround the main-sequence polynomial fit function. Using a gamma Probability\nDensity Function (PDF), we can best mimic the main sequence distribution and\nexclude natural fluctuations in IR excess. With this new methodology we\nre-discover 25 IR excesses and present 14 new candidates. One source\n(J053010.20-010140.9), suggests a 8.40 $\\pm$ 0.73 AU disk, a likely candidate\nfor possible direct imagining of planets that are likely fully formed. Although\nall of these sources are well within the current flux ratio limit of\n$\\sim$10$^{-6}$ (Wyatt 2008), J223423.85+403515.8 shows the highest bolometric\nflux ratio ($f_d$=0.0694) between disk and host star, providing a very good\ncandidate for direct imaging of the circumstellar disk itself. In re-examining\nthe Kepler candidate catalog (original study preformed by Kennedy and Wyatt\n2012), we found one new candidate that indicates disk like characteristics (TYC\n3143-322-1).\n", "  We report on recent measurements of W and Z boson production at CMS. These\ninclude measurements of inclusive and differential W and Z boson production\ncross sections at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 and 13 TeV, measurements of the angular\ncoefficients of Z boson production, forward-backward asymmetry of\nZ/$\\gamma^{*}$ events, and W charge asymmetry at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV. These\nmeasurements can be used to improve PDFs and refine QCD calculations of weak\nboson production processes. In addition, a W-like mass measurement using Z\nboson events has been performed to probe the experimental uncertainties\nexpected for a W mass measurement at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV.\n", "  We report the measurement of the acoustic quality factor of a gram-scale,\nkilo-hertz frequency superfluid resonator, detected through the parametric\ncoupling to a superconducting niobium microwave cavity. For temperature between\n400mK and 50mK, we observe a $T^{-4}$ temperature dependence of the quality\nfactor, consistent with a 3-phonon dissipation mechanism. We observe Q factors\nup to $1.4\\cdot10^8$, consistent with the dissipation due to dilute $^3$He\nimpurities, and expect that significant further improvements are possible.\nThese experiments are relevant to exploring quantum behavior and decoherence of\nmassive macroscopic objects, the laboratory detection of continuous wave\ngravitational waves from pulsars, and the probing of possible limits to\nphysical length scales.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical analysis on image transmission via a single\nmultimode fiber (MMF). A single MMF imaging model is developed to study the\nlight wave propagation from the light source to the camera, by using free-space\nFourier optics theory and mode-coupling theory. A mathematical expression is\nobtained for the complete single MMF imaging system, which is further validated\nby image-transmission simulations. Our model is believed to be the first\ntheoretical model to describe the complete MMF imaging system based on the\ntransmission of individual modes. Therefore, this model is robust and capable\nof analyzing MMF image transmission under specific mode-coupling conditions. We\nuse our model to study bending-induced image blur in single-MMF image\ntransmission, and the result has found a good agreement with that of existing\nexperimental studies. These should provide important insights into future MMF\nimaging system developments.\n", "  The $n$-Lie bialgebras are studied. In Section 2, the $n$-Lie coalgebra with\nrank $r$ is defined, and the structure of it is discussed. In Section 3, the\n$n$-Lie bialgebra is introduced. A triple $(L, \\mu, \\Delta)$ is an $n$-Lie\nbialgebra if and only if $\\Delta$ is a conformal $1$-cocycle on the $n$-Lie\nalgebra $L$ associated to $L$-modules $(L^{\\otimes n}, \\rho_s^{\\mu})$, $1\\leq\ns\\leq n$, and the structure of $n$-Lie bialgebras is investigated by the\nstructural constants. In Section 4, two-dimensional extension of finite\ndimensional $n$-Lie bialgebras are studied. For an $m$ dimensional $n$-Lie\nbialgebra $(L, \\mu, \\Delta)$, and an $ad_{\\mu}$-invariant symmetric bilinear\nform on $L$, the $m+2$ dimensional $(n+1)$-Lie bialgebra is constructed. In the\nlast section, the bialgebra structure on the finite dimensional simple $n$-Lie\nalgebra $A_n$ is discussed. It is proved that only bialgebra structures on the\nsimple $n$-Lie algebra $A_n$ are rank zero, and rank two.\n", "  One of the most debated subjects in Astronomy since the discovery of\nexoplanets is how can we distinguish the most massive of such objects from\nvery-low mass stars like Brown Dwarfs (BDs)? We have been looking for evidences\nof a difference in physical characteristics that could be related to different\nformation processes. Using a new diagnostic diagram that compares the baryonic\ngravitational potential (BGP) with the distances from their host stars, we have\nclassified a sample of 355 well-studied exoplanets according to their possible\nstructures. We have then compared the exoplanets to a sample of 87 confirmed\nBDs, identifying a range in BGP that could be common to both objects. By\nanalyzing the mass-radius relations (MRR) of the exoplanets and BDs in those\ndifferent BGP ranges, we were able to distinguish different characteristic\nbehaviors. By comparing with models in the literature, our results suggest that\nBDs and massive exoplanets might have similar structures dominated by liquid\nmetallic hydrogen (LMH).\n", "  A Lorentz-symmetry test with Ca$^+$ ions demonstrated the potential of using\nquantum information inspired technology for tests of fundamental physics. A\nsystematic study of atomic-system sensitivities to Lorentz violation identified\nthe ytterbium ion as an ideal system with high sensitivity as well as excellent\nexperimental controllability. A test of Lorentz-violating physics in the\nelectron-photon sector with Yb$^+$ ions has the potential to reach levels of\n10$^{-23}$, five orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current best\nbounds. Similar sensitivities may be also reached with highly charged ions.\n", "  A theoretical scheme is presented for the adiabatic generation of N-quNit\nsinglet states with $N\\geqslant3$, which may be more feasible than previous\nones in a cavity. In this proposal, the system may be robust both parameter\nfluctuations and dissipation along a dark state. In addition, quantum\ninformation is only stored in atomic ground states and there is no energy\nexchanged between atoms and photons in a cavity so as to reduce the influence\nof atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decays.\n", "  Detecting and weighing the individual nanoparticles is an important approach\nto study the behavior and properties of single particles. Here we illustrate an\neffective mass sensing scheme using optomechanical resonator system. Based on\nthe optomechanically induced transparency phenomenon, a Stokes field reference\napproach is used to sense the mass of the particle on the microresonator. The\nfield intensity of the transmission field will be changed by the effect of the\nparticle which avoids the limits of decay induced spectral width in the\nresonance shift detection. Exploiting the perturbation method, we theoretically\nevaluated the dynamical behavior of the system, and achieved the femtogram\nlevel mass sensing without the need for high cavity Q-value, and strong\ncoupling strength in the optomechanically system.\n", "  In this paper, an experimental velocity database of a bacterial collective\nmotion , e.g., \\textit{B. subtilis}, in turbulent phase with volume filling\nfraction $84\\%$ provided by Professor Goldstein at the Cambridge University UK,\nwas analyzed to emphasize the scaling behavior of this active turbulence\nsystem. This was accomplished by performing a Hilbert-based methodology\nanalysis to retrieve the scaling property without the $\\beta-$limitation. A\ndual-power-law behavior separated by the viscosity scale $\\ell_{\\nu}$ was\nobserved for the $q$th-order Hilbert moment $\\mathcal{L}_q(k)$. This\ndual-power-law belongs to an inverse-cascade since the scaling range is above\nthe injection scale $R$, e.g., the bacterial body length. The measured scaling\nexponents $\\zeta(q)$ of both the small-scale \\red{(resp. $k>k_{\\nu}$) and\nlarge-scale (resp. $k<k_{\\nu}$)} motions are convex, showing the\nmultifractality. A lognormal formula was put forward to characterize the\nmultifractal intensity. The measured intermittency parameters are $\\mu_S=0.26$\nand $\\mu_L=0.17$ respectively for the small- and large-scale motions. It\nimplies that the former cascade is more intermittent than the latter one, which\nis also confirmed by the corresponding singularity spectrum $f(\\alpha)$ vs\n$\\alpha$. Comparison with the conventional two-dimensional Ekman-Navier-Stokes\nequation, a continuum model indicates that the origin of the multifractality\ncould be a result of some additional nonlinear interaction terms, which\ndeservers a more careful investigation.\n", "  We investigate the effects of nonequilibrium phonon dynamics on the operation\nof a GaAs-based midinfrared quantum cascade laser over a range of temperatures\n(77--300 K) via a coupled ensemble Monte Carlo simulation of electron and\noptical-phonon systems. Nonequilibrium phonon effects are shown to be important\nbelow 200 K. At low temperatures, nonequilibrium phonons enhance injection\nselectivity and efficiency by drastically increasing the rate of interstage\nelectron scattering from the lowest injector state to the next-stage upper\nlasing level via optical-phonon absorption. As a result, the current density\nand modal gain at a given field are higher and the threshold current density\nlower and considerably closer to experiment than results obtained with thermal\nphonons. By amplifying phonon absorption, nonequilibrium phonons also hinder\nelectron energy relaxation and lead to elevated electronic temperatures.\n", "  Second and third harmonic signals have been usually generated by using\nnonlinear crystals, but that method suffers from the low efficiency in small\nthicknesses. Metamaterials can be used to generate harmonic signals in small\nthicknesses. Here, we introduce a new method for amplifying second and third\nharmonic generation from magnetic metamaterials. We show that by using a\ngrating structure under the metamaterial, the grating and the metamaterial form\na resonator, and amplify the resonant behavior of the metamaterial. Therefore,\nwe can generate second and third harmonic signals with high efficiency from\nthis metamaterial-based nonlinear media.\n", "  We study the vacuum behavior of an extended Higgs sector with two doublets in\na scenario with a softly broken \\texorpdfstring{$U(1)$}{lg} global symmetry.\nThe soft-violation term is introduced to avoid massless-axion particles arising\nwhen the global symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. This model has\nmetastable states through the possible presence of multiple non-degenerate\nminima, which is unwanted from the phenomenological point of view if the\nmetastable state is not long-lived enough. The analysis of this fact leads to\nfind possible exclusion limits over parameter space of quartic couplings.\nResults improve the individual behavior of initial conditions for\nrenormalization group equations; also determining unstable zones for the\neffective Higgs potential at one loop level. Besides vacuum stability analyses,\nthe influence of absence of charge violation minima is considered as a limiting\ncase excluding zones in the parameter space. Extremal cases for the model as\nwell as criticality phenomena are discussed with the aid of relation among\nHiggs masses or splittings among them. From vacuum behavior and LHC results,\nphenomenological aspects in the searching of charged and heavier Higgs bosons\nare considered to evaluate the scalar alignment regimen of the two Higgs\ndoublet model.\n", "  This work deals with the viscoelasticity of the arterial wall and its\ninfluence on the pulse waves. We describe the viscoelasticity by a non-linear\nKelvin-Voigt model in which the coefficients are fitted using experimental time\nseries of pressure and radius measured on a sheep's arterial network. We\nobtained a good agreement between the results of the nonlinear Kelvin-Voigt\nmodel and the experimental measurements. We found that the viscoelastic\nrelaxation time-defined by the ratio between the viscoelastic coefficient and\nthe Young's modulus-is nearly constant throughout the network. Therefore, as it\nis well known that smaller arteries are stiffer, the viscoelastic coefficient\nrises when approaching the peripheral sites to compensate the rise of the\nYoung's modulus, resulting in a higher damping effect. We incorporated the\nfitted viscoelastic coefficients in a nonlinear 1D fluid model to compute the\npulse waves in the network. The damping effect of viscoelasticity on the high\nfrequency waves is clear especially at the peripheral sites.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the nonholonomic Suslov problem and its\ngeneralization proposed by Chaplygin. The issue of the existence of an\ninvariant measure with singular density (having singularities at some points of\nphase space) is discussed.\n", "  This paper provides a detailed description of various reduction schemes in\nrigid body dynamics. Analysis of one of such nontrivial reductions makes it\npossible to order the cases already found and to obtain new generalizations of\nthe Kovalevskaya case to e(3). We note that the above reduction allows one to\nobtain in a natural way some singular additive terms which were proposed\nearlier by D.N. Goryachev.\n", "  We present a theory of electronic excitation energies and optical absorption\nspectra which incorporates energy-level renormalization and phonon-assisted\noptical absorption within a unified framework. Using time-independent\nperturbation theory we show how the standard approaches for studying vibronic\neffects in molecules and those for addressing electron-phonon interactions in\nsolids correspond to slightly different choices for the non-interacting\nHamiltonian. Our present approach naturally leads to the Allen-Heine theory of\ntemperature-dependent energy levels, the Franck-Condon principle, the\nHerzberg-Teller effect and to phonon-assisted optical absorption in indirect\nband gap materials. In addition, our theory predicts sub-gap phonon-assisted\noptical absorption in direct gap materials, as well as an exponential edge\nwhich we tentatively assign to the Urbach tail. We also consider a\nsemiclassical approach to the calculation of optical absorption spectra which\nsimultaneously captures energy-level renormalization and phonon-assisted\ntransitions and is especially suited to first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations. We demonstrate this approach by calculating the phonon-assisted\noptical absorption spectrum of bulk silicon.\n", "  Titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) plays a central role in the study of artificial\nphotosynthesis, owing to its ability to perform photocatalytic water splitting.\nDespite over four decades of intense research efforts in this area, there is\nstill some debate over the nature of the first water monolayer on the\ntechnologically-relevant anatase TiO$_2$ (101) surface. In this work we use\nfirst-principles calculations to reverse-engineer the experimental\nhigh-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra measured for this surface in [Walle\net al., J. Phys. Chem. C 115, 9545 (2011)], and find evidence supporting the\nexistence of a mix of dissociated and molecular water in the first monolayer.\nUsing both semilocal and hybrid functional calculations we revise the current\nunderstanding of the adsorption energetics by showing that the energetic cost\nof water dissociation is reduced via the formation of a hydrogen-bonded\nhydroxyl-water complex. We also show that such a complex can provide an\nexplanation of an unusual superstructure observed in high-resolution scanning\ntunneling microscopy experiments.\n", "  Investigating quasiparticle excitations of molecules on surfaces through\nphotoemission spectroscopy forms a major part of nanotechnology research.\nResolving spectral features at these interfaces requires a comprehensive theory\nof electron removal and addition processes in molecules and solids which\ncaptures the complex interplay of image charges, thermal effects and\nconfigurational disorder. We here develop such a theory and calculate the\nquasiparticle energy-level alignment and the valence photoemission spectrum for\nthe prototype biomimetic solar cell interface between anatase TiO2 and the N3\nchromophore. By directly matching our calculated photoemission spectrum to\nexperimental data we clarify the atomistic origin of the chromophore peak at\nlow binding energy. This case study sets a new standard in the interpretation\nof photoemission spectroscopy at complex chromophore/semiconductor interfaces.\n", "  Molecular transistors have the potential for switching with lower gate\nvoltages than conventional field-effect transistors. We have calculated the\nperformance of a single-molecule device in which there is interference between\nelectron transport through the highest occupied molecular orbital and the\nlowest unoccupied molecular orbital of a single molecule. Quantum interference\nresults in a subthreshold slope that is independent of temperature. For\nrealistic parameters the change in gate potential required for a change in\nsource-drain current of two decades is 20 mV, which is a factor of six smaller\nthan the theoretical limit for a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect\ntransistor.\n", "  Witnessing entanglement is crucial in quantum information processing. With\nproperly preparing ancillary states, it has been shown previously that genuine\nentanglement can be witnessed without trusting measurement devices. In this\nwork, we generalize the scenario and show that generic multipartite\nentanglement structures, including entanglement of subsystems and entanglement\ndepth, can be witnessed via measurement-device-independent means. As the\noriginal measurement-device-independent entanglement witness scheme exploits\nonly one out of four Bell measurement outcomes for each party, a direct\ngeneralization to multipartite quantum states will inevitably cause\ninefficiency in entanglement detection after taking account of statistical\nfluctuations. To resolve this problem, we also present a way to utilize all the\nmeasurement outcomes. The scheme is efficient for multipartite entanglement\ndetection and can be realized with state-of-the-art technologies.\n", "  Recent measurements at the T2K experiment indicate that CP violation in\nneutrino mixing may be observed in the future by long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments. We explore the physics program of an extension to the\ncurrently approved T2K running of $7.8\\times 10^{21}$ protons-on-target to\n$20\\times 10^{21}$ protons-on-target,aiming at initial observation of CP\nviolation with 3$\\,\\sigma$ or higher significance for the case of maximum CP\nviolation. With accelerator and beam line upgrades, as well as analysis\nimprovements, this program would occur before the next generation of\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments that are expected to start\noperation in 2026.\n", "  The factorization theorem for the dijet cross section is considered in\nhadron-hadron collisions near threshold with a cone-type jet algorithm. We\nfocus on the infrared finiteness of the factorized parts by carefully\ndistinguishing the ultraviolet and infrared divergences in dimensional\nregularization. The soft function, subject to a jet algorithm, shows a\ncomplicated divergence structure. It is shown that the soft function becomes\ninfrared finite only after the emission in the beam directions is included.\nAmong many partonic processes, we take $q\\overline{q} \\rightarrow gg$ as a\nspecific example to consider the dijet cross section, and verify explicitly\nthat each factorized part is infrared finite. We also compute the anomalous\ndimensions of the factorized components to next-to-leading logarithmic\naccuracy. The hard and the soft functions have nontrivial color structure,\nwhile the jet and the collinear distribution functions are diagonal in color\nspace. The dependence of the soft anomalous dimension on the jet algorithm is\ncolor diagonal and is cancelled by that of the jet functions. The sum of the\nremaining anomalous dimensions also cancels, thus the dijet cross section is\nindependent of the renormalization scale.\n", "  Active biological flow networks pervade nature and span a wide range of\nscales, from arterial blood vessels and bronchial mucus transport in humans to\nbacterial flow through porous media or plasmodial shuttle streaming in slime\nmolds. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the self-organization\nprinciples that govern flow statistics in such non-equilibrium networks. Here\nwe connect concepts from lattice field theory, graph theory, and transition\nrate theory to understand how topology controls dynamics in a generic model for\nactively driven flow on a network. Our combined theoretical and numerical\nanalysis identifies symmetry-based rules that make it possible to classify and\npredict the selection statistics of complex flow cycles from the network\ntopology. The conceptual framework developed here is applicable to a broad\nclass of non-biological far-from-equilibrium networks, including actively\ncontrolled information flows, and establishes a new correspondence between\nactive flow networks and generalized ice-type models.\n", "  Flagellated bacteria on nutrient-rich substrates can differentiate into a\nswarming state and move in dense swarms across surfaces. A recent experiment\nmeasured the flow in the fluid around an Escherichia coli swarm (Wu, Hosu and\nBerg, 2011 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 4147). A systematic chiral flow was\nobserved in the clockwise direction (when viewed from above) ahead of the swarm\nwith flow speeds of about $10~\\mu$m/s, about 3 times greater than the radial\nvelocity at the edge of the swarm. The working hypothesis is that this flow is\ndue to the action of cells stalled at the edge of a colony that extend their\nflagellar filaments outwards, moving fluid over the virgin agar. In this work\nwe quantitatively test his hypothesis. We first build an analytical model of\nthe flow induced by a single flagellum in a thin film and then use the model,\nand its extension to multiple flagella, to compare with experimental\nmeasurements. The results we obtain are in agreement with the flagellar\nhypothesis. The model provides further quantitative insight into the flagella\norientations and their spatial distributions as well as the tangential speed\nprofile. In particular, the model suggests that flagella are on average\npointing radially out of the swarm and are not wrapped tangentially.\n", "  The gravitational collapse of a spherical distribution, in a class of f(R)\ntheories of gravity, where f(R) is power function of R, is discussed. The\nspacetime is assumed to admit a homothetic Killing vector. In the collapsing\nmodes, some of the situations indeed hit a singularity, but they are all\ncovered with an apparent horizon. Some peculiar cases are observed where the\ncollapsing body settles to a constant radius at a given value of the radial\ncoordinate.\n", "  It is postulated in Einstein's relativity that the speed of light in vacuum\nis a constant for all observers. However, the effect of quantum gravity could\nbring an energy dependence of light speed. Even a tiny speed variation, when\namplified by the cosmological distance, may be revealed by the observed time\nlags between photons with different energies from astrophysical sources. From\nthe newly detected long gamma ray burst GRB~160509A, we find evidence to\nsupport the prediction for a linear form modification of light speed in\ncosmological space.\n", "  Bottom-up fabrication of graphene antidot lattices (GALs) has previously\nyielded atomically precise structures with sub-nanometer periodicity. Focusing\non this type of experimentally realized GAL, we perform density functional\ntheory calculations on the pristine structure as well as GALs with edge carbon\natoms substituted with boron or nitrogen. We show that p- and n-type doping\nlevels emerge with activation energies that depend on the level of\nhydrogenation at the impurity. Furthermore, a tight-binding parameterization\ntogether with a Green's function method are used to describe more dilute\ndoping.\n", "  A multi-resolution bead-spring model for polymer dynamics is developed as a\ngeneralization of the Rouse model. A polymer chain is described using beads of\nvariable sizes connected by springs with variable spring constants. A numerical\nscheme which can use different timesteps to advance the positions of different\nbeads is presented and analyzed. The position of a particular bead is only\nupdated at integer multiples of the timesteps associated with its connecting\nsprings. This approach extends the Rouse model to a multiscale model on both\nspatial and temporal scales, allowing simulations of localized regions of a\npolymer chain with high spatial and temporal resolution, while using a coarser\nmodelling approach to describe the rest of the polymer chain. A method for\nchanging the model resolution on-the-fly is developed using the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is shown that this approach maintains key\nstatistics of the end-to-end distance and diffusion of the polymer filament and\nmakes computational savings when applied to a model for the binding of a\nprotein to the DNA filament.\n", "  Discontinuous transition is observed in the equilibrium cluster properties of\na percolation model with suppressed cluster growth as the growth parameter g0\nis tuned to the critical threshold at sufficiently low initial seed\nconcentration rho in contrast to the previously reported results on non-\nequilibrium growth models. In the present model, the growth process follows all\nthe criteria of the original percolation model except continuously updated\noccupation probability of the lattice sites that suppresses the growth of a\ncluster according to its size. As rho varied from higher values to smaller\nvalues, a line of continuous transition points encounters a coexistence region\nof spanning and non- spanning large clusters. At sufficiently small values of\nrho (less equal 0.05), the growth parameter g0 exceeds the usual percolation\nthreshold and generates compact spanning clusters leading to discontinuous\ntransitions.\n", "  We present the correspondence between non-interacting multi-hadron fermion\nstar equation of state in the many-flavor limit and the degrees of freedom of a\nKaluza\\,--\\,Klein compact star. Many flavors can be interpreted in this\nframework as one extra compacti\\-fied spatial dimension with various,\nmore-and-more massive hadron state excitations. The effect of increasing the\ndegrees of freedom was investigated on the equation of state and in connection\nwith the mass-radius relation, $M(R)$. The maximum mass of the star,\n$M_{\\mathrm{max}}$ were also calculated as a function of the maximum number of\nexcited states, $n$ and the size of the compactified extra dimension,\n$R_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n", "  Lock-in feedback circuits are routinely used in physics laboratories all\naround the world to extract small signals out of a noisy environment. In a\nrecent paper (M. Kaptein, R. van Emden, and D. Iannuzzi, paper under review),\nwe have shown that one can adapt the algorithm exploited in those circuits to\ngain insight in behavioral economics. In this paper, we extend this concept to\na very subjective socio-philosophical concept: the concept of beauty. We run an\nexperiment on 7414 volunteers, asking them to express their opinion on the\nphysical features of an avatar. Each participant was prompted with an image\nwhose features were adjusted sequentially via a lock-in feedback algorithm\ndriven by the opinion expressed by the previous participants. Our results show\nthat the method allows one to identify the most attractive features of the\navatar.\n", "  In this contribution to the CPT'16 proceedings, we illustrate the potential\nuse of ring-laser systems in searching for Lorentz violation in the framework\nof the Standard-Model Extension. We present expressions for the\nLorentz-violating contribution to the ring-laser signal for a sample system and\nmake sensitivity estimates for the GINGER project.\n", "  Classical macroscopic space-time is pictured in terms of Rydberg states of an\nunderlying discritzed `atomic' quantum geometry at Planck scales. While quantum\ngeometry on such scales involves several very short lived transitions changing\ncurvature and topologies, the Rydberg states have very long lifetimes, going as\na high power of the quantum number n. This means space-time on macroscopic\nscales are almost infinitely stable. The large degeneracy in the Rydberg\nlevels, with high n, can also account for a large black hole entropy, as well\nas long lifetime of massive black holes to quantum decays. We have a possible\npromising paradigm to link quantum geometry at Planck scales, to classical\nspace-time.\n", "  In this volume a theory for models of transport in the presence of a free\nboundary is developed. Macroscopic laws of transport are described by PDEs.\nWhen the system is open, there are several mechanisms to couple the system with\nthe external forces. Here a class of systems where the interaction with the\nexterior takes place in correspondence of a free boundary is considered. Both\ncontinuous and discrete models sharing the same structure are analyzed. In Part\nI a free boundary problem related to the Stefan Problem is worked out in all\ndetails. For this model a new notion of relaxed solution is proposed for which\nglobal existence and uniqueness is proven. It is also shown that this is the\nhydrodynamic limit of the empirical mass density of the associated particle\nsystem. In Part II several other models are discussed. The expectation is that\nthe results proved for the basic model extend to these other cases. All the\nmodels discussed in this volume have an interest in problems arising in several\nresearch fields such as heat conduction, queuing theory, propagation of fire,\ninterface dynamics, population dynamics, evolution of biological systems with\nselection mechanisms.In general researchers interested in the relations between\nPDEs and stochastic processes can find in this volume an extension of this\ncorrespondence to modern mathematical physics.\n", "  We construct a Darboux transformation of a general $su(3)$-valued spin system\ncalled the $\\Gamma$-spin system. Using this Darboux transformation we derive a\nrecursive formula for the soliton solutions of this spin system. Then using\nthese results we present explicit expressions for the 1-soliton solution of the\ncoupled $su(2)$-valued spin systems, namely, of the coupled M-LIII equation.\n", "  We study the continuous variable entanglement of a system of two particles\nunder the influence of Earth's gravitational field. We determine a phase-space\ndescription of this bipartite system by calculating its Wigner function and\nverify its entanglement by applying a generalization of the PPT criterion for\nnon-Gaussian states. We also examine the influence of gravity on an idealized\nentanglement protocol to be shared between stations at different potentials\nbased on the correlation of states of the gravitational quantum well.\n", "  During the planet formation process, billions of comets are created and\nejected into interstellar space. The detection and characterization of such\ninterstellar comets (also known as extra-solar planetesimals or extra-solar\ncomets) would give us in situ information about the efficiency and properties\nof planet formation throughout the galaxy. However, no interstellar comets have\never been detected, despite the fact that their hyperbolic orbits would make\nthem readily identifiable as unrelated to the solar system. Moro-Mart\\'in et\nal. 2009 have made a detailed and reasonable estimate of the properties of the\ninterstellar comet population. We extend their estimates of detectability with\na numerical model that allows us to consider \"close\" interstellar comets, e.g.,\nthose that come within the orbit of Jupiter. We include several constraints on\na \"detectable\" object that allow for realistic estimates of the frequency of\ndetections expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other\nsurveys. The influence of several of the assumed model parameters on the\nfrequency of detections is explored in detail. Based on the expectation from\nMoro-Mart\\'in et al. 2009, we expect that LSST will detect 0.001-10\ninterstellar comets during its nominal 10-year lifetime, with most of the\nuncertainty from the unknown number density of small (nuclei of $\\sim$0.1-1 km)\ninterstellar comets. Using simulated LSST-like astrometric data, we study the\nproblem of orbit determination for these bodies, finding that LSST could\nidentify their orbits as hyperbolic and determine an ephemeris sufficiently\naccurate for follow-up in about 4-7 days. We give the hyperbolic orbital\nparameters of the most detectable interstellar comets. Taking the results into\nconsideration, we give recommendations to future searches for interstellar\ncomets.\n", "  We prove a general relation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in\nthe quantum setting, i.e., between strategies where the adversary can or cannot\nadaptively base its action on some auxiliary quantum side information. Our\nrelation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can\ncontrol the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its\n\"information content\". Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in\nthe analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very\npowerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it\nis sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with two examples. The\nfirst is a quantum bit commitment scheme based on 1-bit cut-and-choose. Since\nbit commitment implies oblivious transfer (in the quantum setting), and\noblivious transfer is universal for two-party computation, this implies the\nuniversality of 1-bit cut-and-choose, and thus solves the main open problem of\n[FKSZZ13]. The second example is a quantum bit commitment scheme proposed in\n1993 by Brassard et al. It was originally suggested as an unconditionally\nsecure scheme, back when this was thought to be possible. We partly restore the\nscheme by proving it secure in (a variant of) the bounded quantum storage\nmodel.\n  In both examples, the fact that the adversary holds quantum side information\nobstructs a direct analysis of the scheme, and we circumvent it by analyzing a\nnon-adaptive version, which can be done by means of known techniques, and\napplying our main result.\n", "  We show that a hairy black hole solution can provide a holographically dual\ndescription of quark confinement. There exists a one-parameter sensible metric\nwhich receives the backreaction of matter contents in the holographic action,\nwhere the scalar and gauge field are responsible for the condensation of\nchromomagnetic monopoles. This model features a preconfining phase triggered by\nsecond-order monopole condensation and a first-order confinement/deconfinement\nphase transition. To confirm the confinement, the quark-antiquark potential is\ncalculated by probing a QCD string in both phases. At last, contribution from\nKaluza-Klein monopoles in the confining phase is discussed.\n", "  We present an investigation of the magnetic field-temperature phase diagram\nof Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ based on DC magnetisation and AC susceptibility measurements\ncovering a broad frequency range of four orders of magnitude, from very low\nfrequencies reaching 0.1 Hz up to 1 kHz. The experiments were performed in the\nvicinity of $T_C=58.2$ K and around the skyrmion lattice A-phase. At the\nborders between the different phases the characteristic relaxation times reach\nseveral milliseconds and the relaxation is non-exponential. Consequently the\nborders between the different phases depend on the specific criteria and\nfrequency used and an unambiguous determination is not possible.\n", "  Boron-doped graphene was reported to be the best non-metal doped graphene\nelectrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) working at an onset\npotential of 0.035 V [JACS 136 (2014) 4394]. In the present DFT study,\nintermediates and transition structures along the possible reaction pathways\nare determined. Both Langmuir-Hinschelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms are\ndiscussed. Molecular oxygen binds the positively charged B atom and forms an\nopen shell end-on dioxygen intermediate. The associative path is favoured with\nrespect to the dissociative one. The free energy diagrams along the\nfour-reduction steps are investigated with the methodology by N{\\o}rskov and\nco. [JPC B 108 (2004) 17886] in both acidic and alkaline conditions. The pH\neffect on the stability of the intermediates of reduction is analyzed in terms\nof the Pourbaix diagram. At pH = 14 we compute an onset potential value for the\nelectrochemical ORR of U = 0.05 V, which compares very well with the\nexperimental value in alkaline conditions.\n", "  Information technologies today can inform each of us about the best\nalternatives for shortest paths from origins to destinations, but they do not\ncontain incentives or alternatives that manage the information efficiently to\nget collective benefits. To obtain such benefits, we need to have not only good\nestimates of how the traffic is formed but also to have target strategies to\nreduce enough vehicles from the best possible roads in a feasible way. The\nopportunity is that during large events the traffic inconveniences in large\ncities are unusually high, yet temporary, and the entire population may be more\nwilling to adopt collective recommendations for social good. In this paper, we\nintegrate for the first time big data resources to quantify the impact of\nevents and propose target strategies for collective good at urban scale. In the\ncontext of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, we first predict the expected\nincrease in traffic. To that end, we integrate data from: mobile phones,\nAirbnb, Waze, and transit information, with game schedules and information of\nvenues. Next, we evaluate the impact of the Olympic Games to the travel of\ncommuters, and propose different route choice scenarios during the peak hours.\nMoreover, we gather information on the trips that contribute the most to the\nglobal congestion and that could be redirected from vehicles to transit.\nInterestingly, we show that (i) following new route alternatives during the\nevent with individual shortest path can save more collective travel time than\nkeeping the routine routes, uncovering the positive value of information\ntechnologies during events; (ii) with only a small proportion of people\nselected from specific areas switching from driving to public transport, the\ncollective travel time can be reduced to a great extent. Results are presented\non-line for the evaluation of the public and policy makers.\n", "  Random Field Theory has been used in the fMRI literature to address the\nmultiple comparisons problem. The method provides an analytical solution for\nthe computation of precise p-values when its assumptions are met. When its\nassumptions are not met the thresholds generated by Random Field Theory can be\nmore conservative than Bonferroni corrections, which are arguably too stringent\nfor use in fMRI. As this has been well documented theoretically it is\nsurprising that a majority of current studies (~80%) would not meet the\nassumptions of Random Field Theory and therefore would have reduced\nsensitivity. Specifically most data is not smooth enough to meet the good\nlattice assumption. Current studies smooth data on average by twice the voxel\nsize which is rarely sufficient to meet the good lattice assumption. The amount\nof smoothing required for Random Field Theory to produce accurate p-values\nincreases with image resolution and decreases with degrees of freedom. There is\nno rule of thumb that is valid for all study designs but for typical data (3mm\nresolution, and greater than 20 subjects) residual smoothness with FWHM = 4\ntimes voxel size should produce valid results. However, it should be stressed\nthat for higher spatial resolution and lower degrees of freedom the critical\nsmoothness required will increase sharply. This implies that researchers should\ncarefully choose appropriate smoothing kernels. This can be facilitated by the\nsimulations we provide that identify the critical smoothness at which the\napplication of RFT becomes appropriate. For some applications such as\npresurgical mapping or, imaging of small structures, probing the\nlaminar/columnar structure of the cortex these smoothness requirements may be\ntoo great to preserve spatial structure. As such, this study suggests\ndevelopments are needed in Random Field Theory to fully exploit the resolution\nof modern neuroimaging.\n", "  In Part 1 of this paper, I introduce the idea of interactional expertise\nwhile in Part 2, I focus on its implications for philosophical theories of the\nimportance of the body in forming our conceptual world. I argue that the way\nphilosophers have dealt with the body turns attention away from the most\nimportant questions and that we cannot answer these questions without making\nthe notion of socialisation, and therefore interactional expertise, a central\nconcept in our thinking. This makes language at least as important, and often\nmore important than bodily practice in our understanding of the world. The\nnotion of a disembodied socialised agent leads in the direction of interesting\nquestions while the notion of an embodied but unsocialised human actor is\nunimaginable.\n"]}
