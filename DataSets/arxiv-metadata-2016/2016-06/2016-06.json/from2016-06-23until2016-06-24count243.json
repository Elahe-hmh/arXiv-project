waves with a definite 4-momentum. In\naddition to plane-wave photons, \"twisted photons\" have recently entered the\nfield of modern laser optics; these are coherent superpositions of plane waves\nwith a defined projection hbar*m of the orbital angular momentum onto the\npropagation axis, where m is integer. In this paper, we show that it is\npossible to produce high-energy twisted photons by Compton backscattering of\ntwisted laser photons off ultra-relativistic electrons. Such photons may be of\ninterest for experiments related to the excitation and disintegration of atoms\nand nuclei, and for studying the photo-effect and pair production off nuclei in\npreviously unexplored experimental regimes.\n", "  The fragmentation of neutron-rich 132Sn nuclei produced in the fission of\n238U projectiles at 950 MeV/u has been investigated at the FRagment Separator\n(FRS) at GSI. This work represents the first investigation of fragmentation of\nmedium-mass radioactive projectiles with a large neutron excess. The measured\nproduction cross sections of the residual nuclei are relevant for the possible\nuse of a two-stage reaction scheme (fission+fragmentation) for the production\nof extremely neutron-rich medium-mass nuclei in future rare-ion-beam\nfacilities. Moreover, the new data will provide a better understanding of the\n\"memory\" effect in fragmentation reactions.\n", "  A model of aluminium has been developed and implemented in an Ocean General\nCirculation Model (NEMO-PISCES). In the model, aluminium enters the ocean by\nmeans of dust deposition. The internal oceanic processes are described by\nadvection, mixing and reversible scavenging. The model has been evaluated\nagainst a number of selected high-quality datasets covering much of the world\nocean, especially those from the West Atlantic Geotraces cruises of 2010 and\n2011. Generally, the model results are in fair agreement with the observations.\nHowever, the model does not describe well the vertical distribution of\ndissolved Al in the North Atlantic Ocean. The model may require changes in the\nphysical forcing and the vertical dependence of the sinking velocity of\nbiogenic silica to account for other discrepancies. To explore the model\nbehaviour, sensitivity experiments have been performed, in which we changed the\nkey parameters of the scavenging process as well as the input of aluminium into\nthe ocean. This resulted in a better understanding of aluminium in the ocean,\nand it is now clear which parameter has what effect on the dissolved aluminium\ndistribution and which processes might be missing in the model, among which\nboundary scavenging and biological incorporation of aluminium into diatoms.\n", "  The elliptic, $v_2$, triangular, $v_3$, and quadrangular, $v_4$, azimuthal\nanisotropic flow coefficients are measured for unidentified charged particles,\npions and (anti-)protons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV\nwith the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Results obtained with the\nevent plane and four-particle cumulant methods are reported for the\npseudo-rapidity range $|\\eta|<0.8$ at different collision centralities and as a\nfunction of transverse momentum, $p_{\\rm T}$, out to $p_{\\rm T}=20$ GeV/$c$.\nThe observed non-zero elliptic and triangular flow depends only weakly on\ntransverse momentum for $p_{\\rm T}>8$ GeV/$c$. The small $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence\nof the difference between elliptic flow results obtained from the event plane\nand four-particle cumulant methods suggests a common origin of flow\nfluctuations up to $p_{\\rm T}=8$ GeV/$c$. The magnitude of the (anti-)proton\nelliptic and triangular flow is larger than that of pions out to at least\n$p_{\\rm T}=8$ GeV/$c$ indicating that the particle type dependence persists out\nto high $p_{\\rm T}$.\n", "  The process of deriving an interatomic potentials represents an attempt to\nintegrate out the electronic degrees of freedom from the full quantum\ndescription of a condensed matter system. In practice it is the derivatives of\nthe interatomic potentials which are used in molecular dynamics, as a model for\nthe forces on a system. These forces should be the derivative of the free\nenergy of the electronic system, which includes contributions from the entropy\nof the electronic states. This free energy is weakly temperature dependent, and\nalthough this can be safely neglected in many cases there are some systems\nwhere the electronic entropy plays a significant role. Here a method is\nproposed to incorporate electronic entropy in the Sommerfeld approximation into\nempirical potentials. The method is applied as a correction to an existing\npotential for titanium. Thermal properties of the new model are calculated, and\na simple method for fixing the melting point and solid-solid phase transition\ntemperature for existing models fitted to zero temperature data is presented.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the net-charge fluctuations in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, measured with the ALICE detector\nat the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The dynamical fluctuations per unit entropy\nare observed to decrease when going from peripheral to central collisions. An\nadditional reduction in the amount of fluctuations is seen in comparison to the\nresults from lower energies. We examine the dependence of fluctuations on the\npseudorapidity interval, which may account for the dilution of fluctuations\nduring the evolution of the system. We find that the fluctuations at LHC are\nsmaller compared to the measurements at the Relativistic heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC), and as such, closer to what has been theoretically predicted for the\nformation of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).\n", "  The inclusive transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) distributions of primary\ncharged particles are measured in the pseudo-rapidity range $|\\eta|<0.8$ as a\nfunction of event centrality in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=2.76$\nTeV with ALICE at the LHC. The data are presented in the $p_{\\rm T}$ range\n$0.15<p_{\\rm T}<50$ GeV/$c$ for nine centrality intervals from 70-80% to 0-5%.\nThe Pb-Pb spectra are presented in terms of the nuclear modification factor\n$R_{\\rm{AA}}$ using a pp reference spectrum measured at the same collision\nenergy. We observe that the suppression of high-$p_{\\rm T}$ particles strongly\ndepends on event centrality. In central collisions (0-5%) the yield is most\nsuppressed with $R_{\\rm{AA}}\\approx0.13$ at $p_{\\rm T}=6$-7 GeV/$c$. Above\n$p_{\\rm T}=7$ GeV/$c$, there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification\nfactor, which reaches $R_{\\rm{AA}} \\approx0.4$ for $p_{\\rm T}>30$ GeV/$c$. In\nperipheral collisions (70-80%), the suppression is weaker with $R_{\\rm{AA}}\n\\approx 0.7$ almost independently of $p_{\\rm T}$. The measured nuclear\nmodification factors are compared to other measurements and model calculations.\n", "  The charged-particle pseudorapidity density measured over 4 units of\npseudorapidity in non-single-diffractive (NSD) p-Pb collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is\npresented. The average value at midrapidity is measured to be $16.81 \\pm 0.71$\n(syst.), which corresponds to $2.14 \\pm 0.17$ (syst.) per participating\nnucleon. This is 16% lower than in NSD pp collisions interpolated to the same\ncollision energy, and 84% higher than in d-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\n= 0.2$ TeV. The measured pseudorapidity density in p-Pb collisions is compared\nto model predictions, and provides new constraints on the description of\nparticle production in high-energy nuclear collisions.\n", "  Physical quantities in QCD are independent of renormalization scheme (RS),\nbut that exact invariance is spoiled by truncations of the perturbation series.\n\"Optimization\" corresponds to making the perturbative approximant, at any given\norder, locally invariant under small RS changes. A solution of the resulting\noptimization equations is presented. It allows an efficient algorithm for\nfinding the optimized result. Example results for R(e+e-)=3(Sum q_i^2)(1+R) to\nfourth order (NNNLO) are given that show nice convergence, even down to\narbitrarily low energies. The Q=0 \"freezing\" behaviour, R=0.3+/-0.3, found at\nthird order is confirmed and made more precise; R=0.2+/-0.1. Low-energy results\nin the MS-bar scheme, by contrast, show the typical pathologies of a\nnon-convergent asymptotic series.\n", "  We propose a method of two-beam spin noise spectroscopy to test the spin\ntransport at equilibrium via analysis of correlations between time-shifted spin\nfluctuations at different space locations. This method allows one to determine\nthe strength of spin-orbit interaction and spin relaxation time and separate\nspin noise of conducting electrons from the background noise of localized\nelectrons. We formulate a theory of two-beam spin noise spectroscopy in\nsemiconductor wires with Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit interaction taking into\naccount several possible spin relaxation channels and finite size of laser\nbeams. Our theory predicts a peak shift with respect to the Larmor frequency to\nhigher or lower frequencies depending on the strength of spin orbit interaction\nand distance between the beams. The two-beam spin noise spectroscopy could find\napplications in experimental studies of semiconductors, emergent materials and\nmany other systems.\n", "  Diffusion is a fundamental graph process, underpinning such phenomena as\nepidemic disease contagion and the spread of innovation by word-of-mouth. We\naddress the algorithmic problem of finding a set of k initial seed nodes in a\nnetwork so that the expected size of the resulting cascade is maximized, under\nthe standard independent cascade model of network diffusion. Runtime is a\nprimary consideration for this problem due to the massive size of the relevant\ninput networks.\n  We provide a fast algorithm for the influence maximization problem, obtaining\nthe near-optimal approximation factor of (1 - 1/e - epsilon), for any epsilon >\n0, in time O((m+n)k log(n) / epsilon^2). Our algorithm is runtime-optimal (up\nto a logarithmic factor) and substantially improves upon the previously\nbest-known algorithms which run in time Omega(mnk POLY(1/epsilon)).\nFurthermore, our algorithm can be modified to allow early termination: if it is\nterminated after O(beta(m+n)k log(n)) steps for some beta < 1 (which can depend\non n), then it returns a solution with approximation factor O(beta). Finally,\nwe show that this runtime is optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any beta\nand fixed seed size k.\n", "  We show that memristive networks-namely networks of resistors with memory-can\nefficiently solve shortest-path optimization problems. Indeed, the presence of\nmemory (time non-locality) promotes self organization of the network into the\nshortest possible path(s). We introduce a network entropy function to\ncharacterize the self-organized evolution, show the solution of the\nshortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution\npath. Finally, we provide an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem.\nSimilar considerations apply to networks of memcapacitors and meminductors, and\nnetworks with memory in various dimensions.\n", "  We present an analytical simple formula for an approximated third integral of\nmotion associated with nearly equatorial orbits in the Galaxy:\n$I_{3}=Z\\Sigma_{I}^{1/3}$, where $Z(R)$ is the vertical amplitude of the orbit\nat galactocentric distance $R$ and $\\Sigma_{I}(R)$ is the integrated dynamical\nsurface mass density of the disk, a quantity which has recently become\nmeasurable. We also suggest that this relation is valid for disk-crossing\norbits in a wide variety of axially symmetric galactic models, which range from\nrazor-thin disks to disks with non-negligible thickness, whether or not the\nsystem includes bulges and halos. We apply our formalism to a Miyamoto-Nagai\nmodel and to a realistic model for the Milky Way. In both cases, the results\nprovide fits for the shape of nearly equatorial orbits which are better than\nthe corresponding curves obtained by the usual adiabatic approximation when the\norbits have vertical amplitudes comparable to the disk's scale height. We also\ndiscuss the role of this approximate third integral of motion in modified\ntheories of gravity.\n", "  Perturbative QCD, when optimized by the principle of minimal sensitivity at\nfourth order, yields finite results for R(e+e-)(Q) down to Q=0. For two\nmassless flavours (n_f=2) this occurs because the couplant \"freezes\" at a fixed\npoint of the optimized beta function. However, for larger n_f's, between 6.7\nand 15.2, the infrared limit arises by a novel mechanism in which the evolution\nof the optimized beta function with energy Q is crucial. The evolving beta\nfunction develops a minimum that, as Q -> 0, just touches the axis at a_p (the\n\"pinch point\"), while the infrared limit of the optimized couplant is at a\nlarger value, a^star (the \"unfixed point\"). This phenomenon results in R\napproaching its infrared limit not as a power law, but as R ->\nR^star-const./|ln Q|^2. Implications for the phase structure of QCD as a\nfunction of n_f are briefly considered.\n", "  Memory circuit elements, namely memristive, memcapacitive and meminductive\nsystems, are gaining considerable attention due to their ubiquity and use in\ndiverse areas of science and technology. Their modeling within the most widely\nused environment, SPICE, is thus critical to make substantial progress in the\ndesign and analysis of complex circuits. Here, we present a collection of\nmodels of different memory circuit elements and provide a methodology for their\naccurate and reliable modeling in the SPICE environment. We also provide codes\nof these models written in the most popular SPICE versions (PSpice, LTspice,\nHSPICE) for the benefit of the reader. We expect this to be of great value to\nthe growing community of scientists interested in the wide range of\napplications of memory circuit elements.\n", "  We show that memcapacitive (memory capacitive) systems can be used as\nsynapses in artificial neural networks. As an example of our approach, we\ndiscuss the architecture of an integrate-and-fire neural network based on\nmemcapacitive synapses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity can be simply realized with some of these\ndevices. Memcapacitive synapses are a low-energy alternative to memristive\nsynapses for neuromorphic computation.\n", "  The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has been widely used to assess student\nunderstanding of introductory mechanics concepts by a variety of educators and\nphysics education researchers. One reason for this extensive use is that many\nof the items on the FCI have strong distractor choices that correspond to\nstudents' alternate conceptions in mechanics. Instruction is unlikely to be\neffective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of\nintroductory physics students and explicitly take into account students'\ninitial knowledge state in their instructional design. Here, we discuss\nresearch involving the FCI to evaluate the pedagogical content knowledge of\nboth instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) of varying teaching experience.\nFor each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify the\nmost common incorrect answer choice of introductory physics students. We also\ndiscussed the responses individually with a few instructors. Then, we used the\nFCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory\nphysics students to assess the pedagogical content knowledge of physics\ninstructors and TAs. We find that while both physics instructors and TAs, on\naverage, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory\nstudents' difficulties with FCI content, they did not identify many common\ndifficulties that introductory physics students have, even after traditional\ninstruction. Moreover, the ability to correctly identify students' difficulties\nwas not correlated with the teaching experience of the physics instructors.\n", "  Here we suggest a novel hybrid spin noise spectroscopy technique, which is\nsensitive to the spin Hall effect. It is shown that, while the standard\nspin-spin correlation function is not sensitive to the spin Hall effect,\nspin-transverse voltage and transverse voltage-voltage correlation functions\nprovide the missing sensitivity being linear and quadratic in the spin Hall\ncoefficient, respectively. The correlation between transverse voltage and spin\nfluctuations appears as a result of spin-charge coupling fundamental for the\nspin Hall effect. We anticipate that the proposed method could find\napplications in the studies of spin-charge coupling in semiconductors.\n", "  Recently, a new notion of quantum R\\'enyi divergences has been introduced by\nM\\\"uller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and Tomamichel, J.Math.Phys. 54:122203,\n(2013), and Wilde, Winter, Yang, Commun.Math.Phys. 331:593--622, (2014), that\nhas found a number of applications in strong converse theorems. Here we show\nthat these new R\\'enyi divergences are also useful tools to obtain coding\ntheorems in the direct domain of various problems. We demonstrate this by\ngiving new and considerably simplified proofs for the achievability parts of\nStein's lemma with composite null hypothesis, universal state compression, and\nthe classical capacity of compound classical-quantum channels, based on\nsingle-shot error bounds already available in the literature, and simple\nproperties of the quantum R\\'enyi divergences. The novelty of our proofs is\nthat the composite/compound coding theorems can be almost directly obtained\nfrom the single-shot error bounds, with essentially the same effort as for the\ncase of simple null-hypothesis/single source/single channel.\n", "  We discuss the concept of unextendible product basis (UPB) and generalized\nUPB for fermionic systems, using Slater determinants as an analogue of product\nstates, in the antisymmetric subspace $\\wedge^ N \\bC^M$. We construct an\nexplicit example of generalized fermionic unextendible product basis (FUPB) of\nminimum cardinality $N(M-N)+1$ for any $N\\ge2,M\\ge4$. We also show that any\nbipartite antisymmetric space $\\wedge^ 2 \\bC^M$ of codimension two is spanned\nby Slater determinants, and the spaces of higher codimension may not be spanned\nby Slater determinants. Furthermore, we construct an example of complex FUPB of\n$N=2,M=4$ with minimum cardinality $5$. In contrast, we show that a real FUPB\ndoes not exist for $N=2,M=4$ . Finally we provide a systematic construction for\nFUPBs of higher dimensions using FUPBs and UPBs of lower dimensions.\n", "  In this short note, we give a construction of solutions to the Einstein\nconstraint equations using the well known conformal method. Our method gives a\nresult similar to the one in [15, 16, 24], namely existence when the so called\nTT-tensor $\\sigma$ is small and the Yamabe invariant of the manifold is\npositive. The method we describe is however much simpler than the original\nmethod and allows easy extensions to several other problems. Some non-existence\nresults are also considered.\n", "  The distribution of dissolved aluminium in the West Atlantic Ocean shows a\nmirror image with that of dissolved silicic acid, hinting at intricate\ninteractions between the ocean cycling of Al and Si. The marine biogeochemistry\nof Al is of interest because of its potential impact on diatom opal\nremineralisation, hence Si availability. Furthermore, the dissolved Al\nconcentration at the surface ocean has been used as a tracer for dust input,\ndust being the most important source of the bio-essential trace element iron to\nthe ocean. Previously, the dissolved concentration of Al was simulated\nreasonably well with only a dust source, and scavenging by adsorption on\nsettling biogenic debris as the only removal process. Here we explore the\nimpacts of (i) a sediment source of Al in the Northern Hemisphere (especially\nnorth of ~40{\\deg}N), (ii) the imposed velocity field, and (iii) biological\nincorporation of Al on the modelled Al distribution in the ocean. The sediment\nsource clearly improves the model results, and using a different velocity field\nshows the importance of advection on the simulated Al distribution. Biological\nincorporation appears to be a potentially important removal process. However,\nconclusive independent data to constrain the Al:Si incorporation ratio by\ngrowing diatoms are missing. Therefore, this study does not provide a\ndefinitive answer to the question of the relative importance of Al removal by\nincorporation compared to removal by adsorptive scavenging.\n", "  Motivated by the absence of any clear signal of physics beyond the Standard\nModel at the LHC after Run I, we discuss one possible slight hint of new\nphysics and one non-minimal extension of the Standard Model. In the first part\nwe provide a tentative explanation of a small excess of multilepton events,\nobserved by the CMS collaboration, by means of a simplified model of gauge\nmediated supersymmetry breaking. In the second part we discuss how the standard\nphenomenology of gauge mediation can be significantly modified if one makes the\nnon-minimal assumption that supersymmetry is broken in more than one hidden\nsector. Such multiple hidden sector models involve light neutral fermions\ncalled pseudo-goldstini and, due to the extra decay steps they induce, where\nsoft photons are emitted, these models give rise to multiphoton plus missing\nenergy signatures. We discuss why the existing LHC searches are poorly\nsensitive to these model and we propose new searches designed to probe them.\n", "  Geometric structures on $\\mathbb N Q$-manifolds, i.e.~non-negatively graded\nmanifolds with an homological vector field, encode non-graded geometric data on\nLie algebroids and their higher analogues. A particularly relevant class of\nstructures consists of vector bundle valued differential forms. Symplectic\nforms, contact structures and, more generally, distributions are in this class.\nWe describe vector bundle valued differential forms on non-negatively graded\nmanifolds in terms of non-graded geometric data. Moreover, we use this\ndescription to present, in a unified way, novel proofs of known results, and\nnew results about degree one $\\mathbb N Q$-manifolds equipped with certain\ngeometric structures, namely symplectic structures, contact structures,\ninvolutive distributions (already present in literature) and locally conformal\nsymplectic structures, and generic vector bundle valued higher order forms, in\nparticular presymplectic and multisymplectic structures (not yet present in\nliterature).\n", "  We present a new approach to the realization of hard fixed-order corrections\nin predictions for the processes probed in high energy colliding hadron beam\ndevices, with some emphasis on the LHC and the future FCC devices. We show that\nthe usual unphysical divergence of such corrections as one approaches the soft\nlimit is removed in our approach, so that we would render the standard results\nto be closer to the observed exclusive distributions. We use the single\nZ/\\gamma* production and decay to lepton pairs as our prototypical example, but\nwe stress that the approach has general applicability. In this way, we open\nanother part of the way to rigorous baselines for the determination of the\ntheoretical precision tags for LHC physics, with an obvious generalization to\nthe future FCC as well.\n", "  We study the resistivity scaling in nanometer-sized metallic wires due to\nsurface roughness and grain-boundaries, currently the main cause of electron\nscattering in nanoscaled interconnects. The resistivity has been obtained with\nthe Boltzmann transport equation, adopting the relaxation time approximation\n(RTA) of the distribution function and the effective mass approximation for the\nconducting electrons. The relaxation times are calculated exactly, using\nFermi's golden rule, resulting in a correct relaxation time for every sub-band\nstate contributing to the transport. In general, the relaxation time strongly\ndepends on the sub-band state, something that remained unclear with the methods\nof previous work. The resistivity scaling is obtained for different roughness\nand grain-boundary properties, showing large differences in scaling behavior\nand relaxation times. Our model clearly indicates that the resistivity is\ndominated by grain-boundary scattering, easily surpassing the surface roughness\ncontribution by a factor of 10.\n", "  We study equations from the area of peridynamics, which is an extension of\nelasticity. The governing equations form a system of nonlocal wave equations.\nIts governing operator is found to be a bounded, linear and self-adjoint\noperator on a Hilbert space. We study the well-posedness and stability of the\nassociated initial value problem. We solve the initial value problem by\napplying the functional calculus of the governing operator. In addition, we\ngive a series representation of the solution in terms of spherical Bessel\nfunctions. For the case of scalar valued functions, the governing operator\nturns out as functions of the Laplace operator. This result enables the\ncomparison of peridynamic solutions to those of classical elasticity as well as\nthe introduction of local boundary conditions into the nonlocal theory. The\nlatter is studied in a companion paper.\n", "  Diluted mean-field models are graphical models in which the geometry of\ninteractions is determined by a sparse random graph or hypergraph. Based on a\nnonrigorous but analytic approach called the \"cavity method\", physicists have\npredicted that in many diluted mean-field models a phase transition occurs as\nthe inverse temperature grows from $0$ to $\\infty$ [Proc. National Academy of\nSciences 104 (2007) 10318-10323]. In this paper, we establish the existence and\nasymptotic location of this so-called condensation phase transition in the\nrandom hypergraph $2$-coloring problem.\n", "  We present rigorous upper and lower bounds on the emptiness formation\nprobability for the ground state of a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg XXZ quantum spin\nsystem. For a $d$-dimensional system we find a rate of decay of the order\n$\\exp(-c L^{d+1})$ where $L$ is the sidelength of the box in which we ask for\nthe emptiness formation event to occur. In the $d=1$ case this confirms\nprevious predictions made in the integrable systems community, though our\nbounds do not achieve the precision predicted by Bethe ansatz calculations. On\nthe other hand, our bounds in the case $d \\geq 2$ are new. The main tools we\nuse are reflection positivity and a rigorous path integral expansion which is a\nvariation on those previously introduced by Toth, Aizenman-Nachtergaele and\nUeltschi.\n", "  Distinguishing hadronically decaying boosted top quarks from massive QCD jets\nis an important challenge at the Large Hadron Collider. In this paper we use\nthe power counting method to study jet substructure observables designed for\ntop tagging, and gain insight into their performance. We introduce a powerful\nnew family of discriminants formed from the energy correlation functions which\noutperform the widely used N-subjettiness. These observables take a highly\nnon-trivial form, demonstrating the importance of a systematic approach to\ntheir construction.\n", "  The Fermi surface in underdoped cuprates is reconstructed by the charge\ndensity wave (CDW) order in the pseudogap phase. Theoretical proposals can be\ndivided into two classes: one assumes the underlying Fermi surface without CDW\nas a conventional large surface; the other assumes small hole-like Fermi\npockets. In both scenarios, we theoretically study the quantum oscillation and\nfind three evenly spaced peaks in the oscillation spectra. The central dominant\npeak is induced by the CDW order. Its effective mass is strongly enhanced as\nthe CDW vanishes in agreement with experiments. But the two scenarios have\ndifferent understandings of the subdominant satellite peaks. In the\nlarge-surface scenario they are induced by the interlayer tunneling between the\nbilayer CuO$_{2}$ planes. Their effective masses are also enhanced with\ndescreasing CDW. In the small-pocket scenario one of the subdominant peaks\ncomes from the original small Fermi pockets of the pseudogap state. Its\neffective mass is nearly independent of the CDW strength and increases\nmonotonically with the doping. We propose future quantum oscillation\nexperiments to test these different predictions and thus to clarify the\nunderlying Fermi surface structure of the pseudogap state.\n", "  We present the solution of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)\nfor a light flawour non-singlet spinless meson in Minkowski space. The\nequations are solved in momentum space without the use of the auxiliary\nEuclidean space. To exhibit that Minkowski space non perturbative calculations\nare actually possible is the main purpose of presented paper. According to\nconfinement, the quark propagator is regular in momentum space, which allows us\nto look for the BSE solution directly in the Minkowski momentum space. We find\nthe Minkowski space solution for confining theories is not only numerically\naccessible, but also provides a reasonable description of the pseudoscalar\nmeson system. However, in the case of scalar mesons, the model is less reliable\nand we get more extra light states then observed experimentally.\n", "  The theory of continuous phase transitions predicts the universal collective\nproperties of a physical system near a critical point, which for instance\nmanifest in characteristic power-law behaviours of physical observables. The\nwell-established concept at or near equilibrium, universality, can also\ncharacterize the physics of systems out of equilibrium. The most fundamental\ninstance of a genuine non-equilibrium phase transition is the directed\npercolation universality class, where a system switches from an absorbing\ninactive to a fluctuating active phase. Despite being known for several decades\nit has been challenging to find experimental systems that manifest this\ntransition. Here we show theoretically that signatures of the directed\npercolation universality class can be observed in an atomic system with long\nrange interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even mesoscopic ensembles ---\nwhich are currently studied experimentally --- are sufficient to observe traces\nof this non-equilibrium phase transition in one, two and three dimensions.\n", "  The phloem vascular system facilitates transport of energy-rich sugar and\nsignaling molecules in plants, thus permitting long range communication within\nthe organism and growth of non-photosynthesizing organs such as roots and\nfruits. The flow is driven by osmotic pressure, generated by differences in\nsugar concentration between distal parts of the plant. The phloem is an\nintricate distribution system, and many questions about its regulation and\nstructural diversity remain unanswered. Here, we investigate the phloem\nstructure in the simplest possible geometry: a linear leaf, found, for example,\nin the needles of conifer trees. We measure the phloem structure in four tree\nspecies representing a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes, from 1 cm\n(\\textit{Picea omorika}) to 35 cm (\\textit{Pinus palustris}). We show that the\nphloem shares common traits across these four species and find that the size of\nits conductive elements obeys a power law. We present a minimal model that\naccounts for these common traits and takes into account the transport strategy\nand natural constraints. This minimal model predicts a power law phloem\ndistribution consistent with transport energy minimization, suggesting that\nenergetics are more important than translocation speed at the leaf level.\n", "  We continue our investigation of the Kontsevich--Penner model, which\ndescribes intersection theory on moduli spaces both for open and closed curves.\nIn particular, we show how Buryak's residue formula, which connects two\ngenerating functions of intersection numbers, appears in the general context of\nmatrix models and tau-functions. This allows us to prove that the\nKontsevich--Penner matrix integral indeed describes open intersection numbers.\nFor arbitrary $N$ we show that the string and dilaton equations completely\nspecify the solution of the KP hierarchy. We derive a complete family of the\nVirasoro and W-constraints, and using these constraints, we construct the\ncut-and-join operators. The case $N=1$, corresponding to open intersection\nnumbers, is particularly interesting: for this case we obtain two different\nfamilies of the Virasoro constraints, so that the difference between them\ndescribes the dependence of the tau-function on even times.\n", "  The magneto-ionic structures of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way and\nthe intergalactic medium are still poorly understood, especially at distances\nlarger than a few kiloparsecs from the Sun. The three-dimensional (3D)\nstructure of the Galactic magnetic field and electron density distribution may\nbe probed through observations of radio pulsars, primarily owing to their\ncompact nature, high velocities, and highly-polarized short-duration radio\npulses. Phase 1 of the SKA, i.e. SKA1, will increase the known pulsar\npopulation by an order of magnitude, and the full SKA, i.e. SKA2, will discover\npulsars in the most distant regions of our Galaxy. SKA1-VLBI will produce\nmodel-independent distances to a large number of pulsars, and wide-band\npolarization observations by SKA1-LOW and SKA1-MID will yield high precision\ndispersion measure, scattering measure, and rotation measure estimates along\nthousands of lines of sight. When combined, these observations will enable\ndetailed tomography of the large-scale magneto-ionic structure of both the\nGalactic disk and the Galactic halo. Turbulence in the interstellar medium can\nbe studied through the variations of these observables and the dynamic spectra\nof pulsar flux densities. SKA1-LOW and SKA1-MID will monitor interstellar\nweather and produce sensitive dynamic and secondary spectra of pulsar\nscintillation, which can be used to make speckle images of the ISM, study\nturbulence on scales between ~10^8 and ~10^13 m, and probe pulsar emission\nregions on scales down to $\\sim$10 km. In addition, extragalactic pulsars or\nfast radio bursts to be discovered by SKA1 and SKA2 can be used to probe the\nelectron density distribution and magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium\nbeyond the Milky Way.\n", "  The complementary wave and particle character of quantum objects (or\nquantons) was pointed out by Niels Bohr. This wave-particle duality, in the\ncontext of the two-slit experiment, is now described not just as two extreme\ncases of wave and particle characteristics, but in terms of quantitative\nmeasures of these natures. These measures of wave and particle aspects are\nknown to follow a duality relation. A very simple and intuitive derivation of a\nclosely related duality relation is presented, which should be understandable\nto the introductory student.\n", "  We propose an algorithm for detecting communities of links in networks which\nuses local information, is based on a new evaluation function, and allows for\npervasive overlaps of communities. The complexity of the clustering task\nrequires the application of a memetic algorithm that combines probabilistic\nevolutionary strategies with deterministic local searches. In Part 2 we will\npresent results of experiments with with citation networks.\n", "  For every quantized Lie algebra there exists a map from the tensor square of\nthe algebra to itself, which by construction satisfies the set-theoretic\nYang-Baxter equation. This map allows one to define an integrable discrete\nquantum evolution system on quadrilateral lattices, where local degrees of\nfreedom (dynamical variables) take values in a tensor power of the quantized\nLie algebra. The corresponding equations of motion admit the zero curvature\nrepresentation. The commuting Integrals of Motion are defined in the standard\nway via the Quantum Inverse Problem Method, utilizing Baxter's famous commuting\ntransfer matrix approach. All elements of the above construction have a\nmeaningful quasi-classical limit. As a result one obtains an integrable\ndiscrete Hamiltonian evolution system, where the local equation of motion are\ndetermined by a classical Yang-Baxter map and the action functional is\ndetermined by the quasi-classical asymptotics of the universal R-matrix of the\nunderlying quantum algebra. In this paper we present detailed considerations of\nthe above scheme on the example of the algebra $U_q(sl(2))$ leading to discrete\nLiouville equations, however the approach is rather general and can be applied\nto any quantized Lie algebra.\n", "  The strategic behaviour of pedestrians is largely determined by how they\nperceive and react to neighbouring people. This issue is addressed in this\npaper by a model which combines, in a time and space-dependent way, discrete\nand continuous effects of pedestrian interactions. Numerical simulations and\nqualitative analysis suggest that human perception, and its impact on crowd\ndynamics, can be effectively modelled as a multiscale process based on a dual\nmicroscopic/macroscopic representation of groups of agents.\n", "  We prove the large deviation principle for the trajectory of a broad class of\nmean field interacting Markov jump processes via a general analytic approach\nbased on viscosity solutions. Examples include generalized Ehrenfest models as\nwell as Curie-Weiss spin flip dynamics with singular jump rates.\n  The main step in the proof of the large deviation principle, which is of\nindependent interest, is the proof of the comparison principle for an\nassociated collection of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.\n  Additionally, we show that the large deviation principle provides a general\nmethod to identify a Lyapunov function for the associated McKean-Vlasov\nequation.\n", "  Two-atom systems in small traps are of fundamental interest, first of all for\nunderstanding the role of interactions in degenerate cold gases and for the\ncreation of quantum gates in quantum information processing with single-atom\ntraps. One of the key quantities is the inelastic relaxation (decay) time when\none of the atoms or both are in a higher hyperfine state. Here we measure this\nquantity in a heteronuclear system of $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb in a micro\noptical trap and demonstrate experimentally and theoretically the presence of\nboth fast and slow relaxation processes, depending on the choice of the initial\nhyperfine states. The developed experimental method allows us to single out a\nparticular relaxation process and, in this sense, our experiment is a\n\"superclean platform\" for collisional physics studies. Our results have also\nimplications for engineering of quantum states via controlled collisions and\ncreation of two-qubit quantum gates.\n", "  The original Pascaline was a mechanical calculator able to sum and subtract\nintegers. It encodes information in the angles of mechanical wheels and through\na set of gears, and aided by gravity, could perform the calculations. Here, we\nshow that such a concept can be realized in electronics using memory elements\nsuch as memristive systems. By using memristive emulators we have demonstrated\nexperimentally the memcomputing version of the mechanical Pascaline, capable of\nprocessing and storing the numerical results in the multiple levels of each\nmemristive element. Our result is the first experimental demonstration of\nmultidigit arithmetics with multi-level memory devices that further emphasizes\nthe versatility and potential of memristive systems for future\nmassively-parallel high-density computing architectures.\n", "  We calculate the resistivity contribution of tilted grain boundaries with\nvarying parameters in sub-10nm diameter metallic nanowires. The results have\nbeen obtained with the Boltzmann transport equation and Fermi's golden rule,\nretrieving correct state-dependent relaxation times. The standard approximation\nschemes for the relaxation times are shown to fail when grain boundary tilt is\nconsidered. Grain boundaries tilted under the same angle or randomly tilted\ninduce a resistivity decrease.\n", "  The connection between maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in a\nprime-power dimensional Hilbert space and finite phase-space geometries is well\nknown. In this article we classify MUBs according to their degree of covariance\nwith respect to the natural symmetries of a finite phase-space, which are the\ngroup of its affine symplectic transformations. We prove that there exist\nmaximal sets of MUBs that are covariant with respect to the full group only in\nodd prime-power dimensional spaces, and in this case their equivalence class is\nactually unique. Despite this limitation, we show that in even-prime power\ndimension covariance can still be achieved by restricting to proper subgroups\nof the symplectic group, that constitute the finite analogues of the oscillator\ngroup. For these subgroups, we explicitly construct the unitary operators\nyielding the covariance.\n", "  Natural dynamics is often dominated by sudden nonlinear processes such as\nneuroavalanches, gamma-ray bursts, solar flares \\emph{etc}. that exhibit\nscale-free statistics much in the spirit of the logarithmic Ritcher scale for\nearthquake magnitudes. On phase diagrams, stochastic dynamical systems (DSs)\nexhibiting this type of dynamics belong to the finite-width phase (N-phase for\nbrevity) that precedes ordinary chaotic behavior and that is known under such\nnames as noise-induced chaos, self-organized criticality, dynamical complexity\n\\emph{etc.} Within the recently formulated approximation-free supersymemtric\ntheory of stochastics, the N-phase can be roughly interpreted as the\nnoise-induced \"overlap\" between integrable and chaotic deterministic dynamics.\nAs a result, the N-phase dynamics inherits the properties of the both. Here, we\nanalyze this unique set of properties and conclude that the N-phase DSs must\nnaturally be the most efficient optimizers: on one hand, N-phase DSs have\nintegrable flows with well-defined attractors that can be associated with\ncandidate solutions and, on the other hand, the noise-induced\nattractor-to-attractor dynamics in the N-phase is effectively chaotic or\na-periodic so that a DS must avoid revisiting solutions/attractors thus\naccelerating the search for the best solution. Based on this understanding, we\npropose a method for stochastic dynamical optimization using the N-phase DSs.\nThis method can be viewed as a hybrid of the simulated and chaotic annealing\nmethods. Our proposition can result in a new generation of hardware devices for\nefficient solution of various search and/or combinatorial optimization\nproblems.\n", "  We experimentally study the effects of the anisotropic Rydberg-interaction on\n$D$-state Rydberg polaritons slowly propagating through a cold atomic sample.\nIn addition to the few-photon nonlinearity known from similar experiments with\nRydberg $S$-states, we observe the interaction-induced dephasing of Rydberg\npolaritons at very low photon input rates into the medium. We develop a model\ncombining the propagation of the two-photon wavefunction through our system\nwith nonperturbative calculations of the anisotropic Rydberg-interaction to\nshow that the observed effect can be attributed to pairwise interaction of\nindividual Rydberg polaritons.\n", "  Topology is an important degree of freedom in characterizing electronic\nsystems. Recently, it also brings new theoretical frontiers and many potential\napplications in photonics. However, the verification of the topological nature\nis highly nontrivial in photonic systems as there is no direct analog of\nquantized Hall conductance for bosonic photons. Here we propose a scheme of\ninvestigating topological photonics in superconducting quantum circuits by a\nsimple parametric coupling method, the flexibility of which can lead to the\neffective \\textit{in situ} tunable artificial gauge field for photons on a\nsquare lattice. We further study the detection of the topological phases of the\nphotons. Our idea employs the exotic properties of the edge state modes which\nresult in novel steady states of the lattice under the driving-dissipation\ncompetition. Through the pumping and the photon-number measurements of merely\nfew sites, not only the spatial and the spectral characters, but also the\nmomentums and even the integer topological quantum numbers with arbitrary\nvalues of the edge state modes can be directly probed, which reveal\nunambiguously the topological nature of photons on the lattice.\n", "  The origin of small mixing among the quarks and a large mixing among the\nneutrinos has been an open question in particle physics. In order to answer\nthis question, we postulate general relations among the quarks and the leptonic\nmixing angles at a high scale, which could be the scale of Grand Unified\nTheories. The central idea of these relations is that the quark and the\nleptonic mixing angles can be unified at some high scale either due to some\nquark-lepton symmetry or some other underlying mechanism and as a consequence,\nthe mixing angles of the leptonic sector are proportional to that of the quark\nsector. We investigate the phenomenology of the possible relations where the\nleptonic mixing angles are proportional to the quark mixing angles at the\nunification scale by taking into account the latest experimental constraints\nfrom the neutrino sector. These relations are able to explain the pattern of\nleptonic mixing at the low scale and thereby hint that these relations could be\npossible signatures of a quark-lepton symmetry or some other underlying\nquark-lepton mixing unification mechanism at some high scale linked to Grand\nUnified Theories.\n", "  A theory is constructed for dense ionic solutions near charged planar walls\nthat is valid for strong inter-ionic correlations. This theory predicts a\nfluctuation-induced, first-order transition and spontaneous charge density\nordering at the interface, in the presence of an otherwise disordered bulk\nsolution. The surface ordering is driven by applied voltage and results in an\nanomalous differential capacitance, in agreement with recent simulation results\nand consistent with experimental observations in a wide array of systems.\nExplicit forms for the charge density profile and capacitance are given. The\ntheory is compared with numerical results for the charge frustrated Ising\nmodel, which is also found to exhibit a voltage driven first-order transition.\n", "  Ando's model provides a rigorous quantum-mechanical framework for\nelectron-surface roughness scattering, based on the detailed roughness\nstructure. We apply this method to metallic nanowires and improve the model\nintroducing surface roughness distribution functions on a finite domain with\nanalytical expressions for the average surface roughness matrix elements. This\napproach is valid for any roughness size and extends beyond the commonly used\nPrange-Nee approximation. The resistivity scaling is obtained from the\nself-consistent relaxation time solution of the Boltzmann transport equation\nand is compared to Prange-Nee's approach and other known methods. The results\nshow that a substantial drop in resistivity can be obtained for certain\ndiameters by achieving a large momentum gap between Fermi level states with\npositive and negative momentum in the transport direction.\n", "  We use the multipole technique to derive four equivalent expressions for the\nbipolar expansion of the inverse distance, valid in all the regions of\nconfiguration space. Using the first-order perturbation theory, we calculate\nthe overlap correction to the long-range electrostatic energy between two\nhydrogen atoms and between a hydrogen atom and a proton.\n", "  This paper summarizes our rather lengthy paper, \"Algebra of the Infrared:\nString Field Theoretic Structures in Massive ${\\cal N}=(2,2)$ Field Theory In\nTwo Dimensions,\" and is meant to be an informal, yet detailed, introduction and\nsummary of that larger work.\n", "  We study the BCS-Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) crossover of a three\ndimensional spin polarized Fermi gas with Rashba spin-orbital-coupling (SOC).\nAt finite temperature, the effects of non-condensed pairs due to the thermal\nexcitation are considered based on the $G_0G$ pair fluctuation theory. These\nfluctuations generate a pseudogap even persistent above $T_c$. Within this\nframework, the Sarma state or the spin polarized superfluid state and polarized\npseudogap state are explored in detail. The resulting $T_c$ curves show that\nthe enhancement of pairing due to the SOC roughly cancels out the suppression\nof pairing due to the population imbalance. Thus we observed that in a large\nportion of the parameter space, the polarized superfluid state are stabilized\nby the SOC.\n", "  The entropy functional formalism allows one to recover general relativity,\nmodified gravity theories, as well as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.\nIn most approaches to quantum gravity, the Bekenstein-Hawking's entropy formula\nacquires a logarithmic correction term. As such terms occur almost universally\nin most approaches to quantum gravity, we analyze the effect of such terms on\nthe entropy functional formalism. We demonstrate that the leading correction to\nthe micro-canonical entropy in the entropy functional formalism can be used to\nrecover modified theories of gravity already obtained with an uncorrected\nmicro-canonical entropy. Furthermore, since the entropy functional formalism\nreproduces modified gravity, the rise of gravity-dependent logarithmic\ncorrections turns out to be one way to impose constraints on these theories of\nmodified gravity. The constraints found here for the simple case of an\nF(R)-gravity are the same as those obtained in the literature from cosmological\nconsiderations.\n", "  The formation of image-potential states at the interface between a graphene\nlayer and a metal surface is studied by means of model calculations. An\nanalytical one-dimensional model-potential for the combined system is\nconstructed and used to calculate energies and wave functions of the\nimage-potential states at the Gamma-point as a function of the graphene-metal\ndistance. It is demonstrated how the double series of image-potential states of\nfree-standing graphene evolves into interfacial states that interact with both\nsurfaces at intermediate distances and finally into a single series of states\nresembling those of a clean metal surface covered by a monoatomic spacer layer.\nThe model quantitatively reproduces experimental data available for\ngraphene/Ir(111) and graphene/Ru(0001), systems which strongly differ in\ninteraction strength and therefore adsorption distance. Moreover, it provides a\nclear physical explanation for the different binding energy and lifetime of the\nfirst (n=1) image-potential state in the valley and hill areas of the strongly\ncorrugated moire superlattice of graphene/Ru(0001).\n", "  We show how networks of Wilson lines realize quantum groups U_q(sl(m)), for\narbitrary m, in 3d SU(N) Chern-Simons theory. Lifting this construction to\nfoams of surface operators in 4d theory we find that rich structure of\njunctions is encoded in combinatorics of planar diagrams. For a particular\nchoice of surface operators we reproduce known mathematical constructions of\ncategorical representations and categorified quantum groups.\n", "  We investigate the effects of spin on entanglement arising in Dirac field in\nan expanding spacetime characterized by the Robertson-Walker metric. We present\na general approach that allows us to treat the case where only charge\nconservation is required, as well as the case where also angular momentum\nconservation is required. We fiend that in both situations entanglement,\nquantified by subsystem entropy, behaves the same and does not qualitatively\ndeviates from the spinless case. Differences only arise when particles and/or\nantiparticles are present in the input state.\n", "  By invoking the relativistic spectral radiance, as derived by Lee and Cleaver\n[1], the drag radiation pressure of a relativistic planar surface moving\nthrough an isotropic radiation field, with which it is in thermal equilibrium,\nis determined in inertial and non-inertial frames. The forward- and\nrearward-directed emission radiation pressures are also derived and compared. A\nfleeting (inertial frames) or ongoing (some non-inertial frames) Carnot cycle\nis shown to exist as a result of an intra-surfaces temperature gradient. The\ndrag radiation pressure on an object with an arbitrary frontal geometry is also\ndescribed.\n", "  A detailed microscopic and quantitative description of the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of Gd$^{3+}$-doped YCo$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ single crystals\n(Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$Co$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$: (0.002 $\\lesssim x \\leq $ 1.00) is\nreported through a combination of temperature-dependent electron spin resonance\n(ESR), heat capacity and $dc$ magnetic susceptibility experiments, plus\nfirst-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ESR results\nindicate that this system features an \\emph{exchange bottleneck} scenario\nwherein various channels for the spin-lattice relaxation mechanism of the\nGd$^{3+}$ ions can be identified via exchange interactions with different types\nof conduction electrons at the Fermi level. Quantitative support from the other\ntechniques allow to extract the exchange interaction parameters between the\nlocalized magnetic moments of the Gd$^{3+}$ ions and the different types of\nconduction electrons present at the Fermi level ($J_{fs}$, $J_{fp}$ and\n$J_{fd}$). Despite the complexity of the crystal structure, our combination of\nexperimental and electronic structure data establish GdCo$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ as a\nmodel RKKY system by predicting a Curie-Weiss temperature $\\theta_{C} =\n-1.2(2)$~K directly from microscopic parameters, in very good agreement with\nthe bulk value from magnetization data. The successful microscopic\nunderstanding of the electronic structure and behavior for the two end\ncompounds YCo$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ and GdCo$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ means they can be used as\nreferences to help describe the more complex electronic properties of related\nmaterials.\n", "  In this work we take a formal approach to the problem of decoupling Proca\nequations in curved space-times. We use Newman-Penrose (NP) two-spinor\nformalism to represent the Proca vector by one complex and two real scalars. We\nshow that a decoupled second order differential equation for one of the real\nscalars can be derived if and only if the background space-time admits a\ncovariantly constant null vector. Thus, the background space-time must be a\npp-wave vacuum. We evaluate the separability of Proca, Maxwell and Dirac\nequations on the resulting pp-wave background.\n", "  The intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of MoS$_2$ is an important aspect\nin the design of MoS$_2$-based nanoelectronic devices. We investigate the\nlattice dynamics properties of MoS$_2$ by first principles calculations. The\nintrinsic thermal conductivity of single-layer MoS$_2$ is calculated using the\nBoltzmann transport equation for phonons. The obtained thermal conductivity\nagrees well with the measurements. The contributions of acoustic and optical\nphonons to the lattice thermal conductivity are evaluated. The size dependence\nof thermal conductivity is investigated as well.\n", "  Many protocols of quantum information processing use entangled states. Hence,\nseparability criteria are of great importance. We propose new separability\nconditions for a bipartite finite-dimensional system. They are derived by using\nfine-grained uncertainty relations. Fine-grained uncertainty relations can be\nobtained by consideration of the spectral norms of certain positive matrices.\nOne of possible approaches to separability conditions is connected with upper\nbounds on the sum of maximal probabilities. Separability conditions are often\nformulated for measurements that have a special structure. For instance,\nmutually unbiased bases and mutually unbiased measurements can be utilized for\nsuch purposes. Using resolution of the identity for each subsystem of a\nbipartite system, we construct some resolution of the identity in the product\nof Hilbert spaces. Separability conditions are then formulated in terms of\nmaximal probabilities for a collection of specific outcomes. The presented\nconditions are compared with some previous formulations. Our results are\nexemplified with entangled states of a two-qutrit system.\n", "  Hawking radiation acts as a cosmic censor since it carries away the angular\nmomentum of the black hole, proportionally more than its mass. In this work we\nfirst show that an extremal black hole cannot exist since it will be pushed\naway from extremality by its own Hawking radiation, without being perturbed by\nany external effect. We evaluate the efficiency of Hawking radiation to prevent\noverspinning of black holes. We make an order of magnitude estimate to show\nthat evaporation can prevent overspinning of black holes with an upper limit of\nmass $M\\lesssim 10^{17}-10^{18}\\rm{g}$, when we take the interaction period to\nbe the age of the universe. Overspinning of black holes of higher masses by\ntest fields remains possible, even if evaporation is taken into account. We\nalso discuss the possibility to attribute a shorter interaction period for the\nproblem which would reduce the effect of evaporation.\n", "  A self-consistent analytical solution of the multi-subband Boltzmann\ntransport equation with collision term describing grain boundary and surface\nroughness scattering is presented to study the resistivity scaling in metal\nnanowires. The different scattering mechanisms and the influence of their\nstatistical parameters are analyzed. Instead of a simple power law relating the\nheight or width of a nanowire to its resistivity, the picture appears to be\nmore complicated due to quantum-mechanical scattering and quantization effects,\nespecially for surface roughness scattering.\n", "  A fundamental element of quantum information processing with photonic qubits\nis the nonclassical quantum interference between two photons when they bunch\ntogether via the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect. Ultimately, many such pure\nphotons must be processed in complex interferometric networks, and for this it\nis essential to synchronize the arrival times of the flying photons preserving\ntheir purity. Here we demonstrate for the first time the HOM interference of\ntwo heralded, pure optical photons synchronized through two independent quantum\nmemories. Controlled storage times up to 1.8 microseconds for about 90 events\nper second were achieved with purities sufficiently high for a negative Wigner\nfunction confirmed with homodyne measurements.\n", "  In $D-$dimensional spherically symmetric $f\\left( R\\right) $ gravity there\nare three unknown functions to be determined from the fourth order differential\nequations. It is shown that the system remarkably integrates to relate two\nfunctions through the third one to provide reduction to second order equations\naccompanied with a large class of potential solutions. The third function which\nacts as the generator of the process is $F\\left( R\\right) =\\frac{df\\left(\nR\\right) }{dR}.$ We recall that our generating function has been employed as a\nscalar field with an accompanying self-interacting potential previously which\nis entirely different from our approach. Reduction of $f\\left( R\\right) $\ntheory into system of equations seems to be efficient enough to generate a\nsolution corresponding to each generating function. As particular examples,\nbesides known ones, we obtain new black hole solutions in any dimension $D$. We\nfurther extend our analysis to cover non-zero energy-momentum tensors. Global\nmonopole and Maxwell sources are given as examples.\n", "  Quantum interference arising from superposition of states is a striking\nevidence of the validity of Quantum Mechanics, confirmed in many experiments\nand also exploited in applications. However, as for any scientific theory,\nQuantum Mechanics is valid within the limits in which it has been\nexperimentally verified. In order to extend such limits, it is necessary to\nobserve quantum interference in unexplored conditions such as moving terminals\nat large distance in Space. Here we experimentally demonstrate single photon\ninterference at a ground station due to the coherent superposition of two\ntemporal modes reflected by a rapidly moving satellite thousand kilometers\naway. The relative speed of the satellite induces a varying modulation in the\ninterference pattern. The measurement of the satellite distance in real time by\nlaser ranging allowed us to precisely predict the instantaneous value of the\ninterference phase. We then observed the interference patterns with visibility\nup to $67\\%$ with three different satellites and with path length up to 5000\nkm. Our results attest the viability of photon temporal modes for fundamental\ntests of Physics and Quantum Communications in Space.\n", "  Ando's surface roughness model is applied to metallic nanowires and extended\nbeyond small roughness size and infinite barrier limit approximations for the\nwavefunction overlaps, such as the Prange-Nee approximation. Accurate and fast\nsimulations can still be performed without invoking these overlap\napproximations by averaging over roughness profiles using finite domain\ndistribution functions to obtain an analytic solution for the scattering rates.\nThe simulations indicate that overlap approximations, while predicting a\nresistivity that agrees more or less with our novel approach, poorly estimate\nthe underlying scattering rates. All methods show that a momentum gap between\nleft- and right-moving electrons at the Fermi level, surpassing a critical\nmomentum gap, gives rise to a substantial decrease in resistivity.\n", "  We derive a consistent differential representation for the dynamics of a\nself-financing portfolio for different hedging strategies. In the basis of the\nderivation there is the so called \"retarded action principle\", which represents\nthe causality in the evolution of dependent stochastic variables. We\ndemonstrate this principle on example of a vanilla and a storage option.\n", "  State of the art detector readout electronics require high-throughput data\nacquisition (DAQ) systems. In many applications, e. g. for medical imaging, the\nfront-end electronics are set up as separate modules in a distributed DAQ. A\nstandardized interface between the modules and a central data unit is\nessential. The requirements on such an interface are varied, but demand almost\nalways a high throughput of data. Beyond this challenge, a Gigabit Ethernet\ninterface is predestined for the broad requirements of Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC)\nup to large-scale DAQ systems. We have implemented an embedded protocol stack\nfor a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) capable of high-throughput data\ntransmission and clock synchronization. A versatile stack architecture for the\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) over\nInternet Protocol (IP) such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as well as\nPrecision Time Protocol (PTP) is presented. With a point-to-point connection to\na host in a MicroTCA system we achieved the theoretical maximum data throughput\nlimited by UDP both for 1000BASE-T and 1000BASE-KX links. Furthermore, we show\nthat the random jitter of a synchronous clock over a 1000BASE-T link for a PTP\napplication is below 60 ps.\n", "  This article provides a rigorous proof of a conjecture by E.C. Bain in 1924\non the optimality of the so-called \"Bain strain\" based on a criterion of least\natomic movement. A general framework that explores several such optimality\ncriteria is introduced and employed to show the existence of optimal\ntransformations between any two Bravais lattices. A precise algorithm and a GUI\nto determine this optimal transformation is provided. Apart from the Bain\nconjecture concerning the transformation from face-centred cubic to\nbody-centred cubic, applications include the face-centred cubic to body-centred\ntetragonal transition as well as the transformation between two triclinic\nphases of Terephthalic Acid.\n  The GUI can be accessed under\nhttp://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55554-optlat\n", "  We present analysis of time-variable, shifted absorption features in far-UV\nspectra of the unusual 49 Ceti debris disk. This nearly edge-on disk is one of\nthe brightest known, and is one of the very few containing detectable amounts\nof circumstellar gas as well as dust. In our two visits of Hubble Space\nTelescope STIS spectra, variable absorption features are seen on the wings of\nlines arising from C II and C IV, but not for any of the other circumstellar\nabsorption lines. Similar variable features have long been seen in spectra of\nthe well-studied $\\beta$ Pictoris debris disk and attributed to the transits of\nstar-grazing comets. We calculate the velocity ranges and apparent column\ndensities of the 49 Cet variable gas, which appears to be moving at velocities\nof tens to hundreds of km s$^{-1}$ relative to the central star. The velocities\nof the gas in the redshifted variable event in Visit 2 show that the maximum\ndistances of the infalling gas at the time of transit are about 0.05 to 0.2 AU\nfrom the central star. A preliminary attempt at a composition analysis of the\nredshifted event suggests that the C/O ratio in the infalling gas may be\nsuper-solar, as it is in the bulk of the stable disk gas.\n", "  The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect results from Thomson scattering\nby coherent flows in the reionized intergalactic medium. We present new results\nbased on ray-tracing a 10 Gpc scale simulation at 2-3 Mpc scale resolution to\ncreate a full sky kSZ map. The simulation includes, self-consistently, the\neffects of reionization on scales corresponding to multipoles\n$10\\lesssim\\ell\\lesssim{5000}$. We separate the kSZ map into Doppler\n($\\mathbf{v}$), Ostriker-Vishniac ($\\delta\\mathbf{v}$), patchy ($x\\mathbf{v}$),\nand third-order ($x\\delta\\mathbf{v}$) components, and compute explicitly all\nthe auto and cross correlations (e.g., $\\langle\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}\\rangle$,\n$\\langle\\delta\\mathbf{v}{x}\\mathbf{v}\\rangle$, etc.) that contribute to the\ntotal power. We find a complex dependence on the duration of reionization at\n$\\ell\\sim{300}$ and evidence for a non-negligible (10-30 per cent) contribution\nfrom connected four point ionization-velocity correlations,\n$\\langle{x}\\mathbf{v}x\\mathbf{v}\\rangle_c$, that are usually neglected in\nanalytical models. We also investigate the Doppler-large scale structure (LSS)\ncorrelation, focusing on two different probes: (1) cross power spectra with\nlinearly biased tracers of LSS and (2) cold spots from infall onto large, rare\n\\ion{H}{2} regions centered on peaks in the matter distribution at redshifts\n$z>10$. Finally, the reionization history can be reconstructed at 5-10$\\sigma$\nsignificance by correlating 21-cm maps with existing CMB temperature maps at\n$\\ell\\!<\\!500$ --sophisticated velocity reconstruction methods can probe the\ndistribution of electrons in the IGM by using combined CMB and LSS measurements\nwell into the epoch of reionization. The resulting kSZ maps have been made\npublicly available at http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~malvarez/research/ksz-data.\n", "  We propose a nonperturbative gauge invariant regulator for d-dimensional\nchiral gauge theories on the lattice. The method involves simulating domain\nwall fermions in d + 1 dimensions with quantum gauge fields that reside on one\nd-dimensional surface and are extended into the bulk via gradient flow. The\nresult is a theory of gauged fermions plus mirror fermions, where the mirror\nfermions couple to the gauge fields via a form factor that becomes\nexponentially soft with the separation between domain walls. The resultant\ntheory has a local d-dimensional interpretation only if the chiral fermion\nrepresentation is anomaly free. A physical realization of this construction\nwould imply the existence of mirror fermions in the standard model that are\ninvisible except for interactions induced by vacuum topology, and which could\ngravitate differently than conventional matter.\n", "  Optical clocks are not only powerful tools for prime fundamental research,\nbut are also deemed for the re-definition of the SI base unit second as they\nnow surpass the performance of caesium atomic clocks in both accuracy and\nstability by more than an order of magnitude. However, an important obstacle in\nthis transition has so far been the limited reliability of the optical clocks\nthat made a continuous realization of a timescale impractical. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate how this situation can be resolved and that a timescale based on\nan optical clock can be established that is superior to one based on even the\nbest caesium fountain clocks. The paper also gives further proof of the\ninternational consistency of strontium lattice clocks on the $10^{-16}$\naccuracy level, which is another prerequisite for a change in the definition of\nthe second.\n", "  We investigate the finite frequency noise of a quantum point contact at\nfilling factor {\\nu} = 5/2 using a weakly coupled resonant LC circuit as a\ndetector. We show how one could spectroscopically address the fractional\ncharged excitations inspecting separately their charge and scaling dimensions.\nWe thus compare the behaviour of the Pfaffian and the anti-Pfaffian non-Abelian\nedge states models in order to give possible experimental signatures to\nidentify the appropriate model for this fractional quantum Hall states. Finally\nwe investigate how the temperature of the LC resonant circuit can be used in\norder to enhance the sensibility of the measurement scheme.\n", "  Using femtosecond time-resolved resonant magnetic x-ray diffraction at the Ho\nL3 absorption edge, we investigate the demagnetization dynamics in\nantiferromagnetically ordered metallic Ho after femtosecond optical excitation.\nTuning the x-ray energy to the electric dipole (E1, 2p -> 5d) or quadrupole\n(E2, 2p -> 4f) transition allows us to selectively and independently study the\nspin dynamics of the itinerant 5d and localized 4f electronic subsystems via\nthe suppression of the magnetic (2 1 3-tau ) satellite peak. We find\ndemagnetization timescales very similar to ferromagnetic 4f systems, suggesting\nthat the loss of magnetic order occurs via a similar spin-flip process in both\ncases. The simultaneous demagnetization of both subsystems demonstrates strong\nintra-atomic 4f-5d exchange coupling. In addition, an ultrafast lattice\ncontraction due to the release of magnetostriction leads to a transient shift\nof the magnetic satellite peak.\n", "  We consider a two level system coupled to a thermal bath and we investigate\nthe variation of energy transferred to the reservoir as a function of time. The\nphysical quantity under investigation is the time-dependent quantum average\npower. We compare quantum master equation approaches with functional influence\nmethod. Differences and similarities between the methods are analyzed, showing\ndeviations at low temperature between the functional integral approach and the\npredictions based on master equations.\n", "  We provide general sufficient conditions for the efficient classical\nsimulation of quantum-optics experiments that involve inputting states to a\nquantum process and making measurements at the output. The first condition is\nbased on the negativity of phase-space quasiprobability distributions (PQDs) of\nthe output state of the process and the output measurements; the second one is\nbased on the negativity of PQDs of the input states, the output measurements,\nand the transition function associated with the process. We show that these\nconditions provide useful practical tools for investigating the effects of\nimperfections in implementations of boson sampling. In particular, we apply our\nformalism to boson-sampling experiments that use single-photon or\nspontaneous-parametric-down-conversion sources and on-off photodetectors.\nConsidering simple models for loss and noise, we show that above some threshold\nfor the probability of random counts in the photodetectors, these\nboson-sampling experiments are classically simulatable. We identify mode\nmismatching as the major source of error contributing to random counts and\nsuggest that this is the chief challenge for implementations of boson sampling\nof interesting size.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize the rotation sensing using optical lattices\nwith laser-assisted tunneling. We demonstrate that the competition between the\nrotation and the spin-orbit coupling governs the spin-dependent response of the\ncyclotron dynamics of the spin-orbit coupled bosons. The Sagnac-type cumulative\nphase can be read out from the envelop of a beat-frequency particle current in\nthe spin-balanced system and enhanced by the cyclotron motion. We also\ntheoretically show that the sensitivity limit of the spin-orbit-coupled system\nto the rotational motion can reach 7*10^-8 rad s^-1 Hz^1/2.\n", "  We discuss the applicability of the pseudopotential-like self-interaction\ncorrection (pSIC) to the study of defect energetics and electronic structure of\nIn2O3. Our results predict that substitutional (at oxygen sites) and\ninterstitial (at antibonding positions) hydrogen, as well as oxygen vacancies\nwith charges +1 and +2, are stable configurations of defects in cubic In2O3;\nthe former form shallow levels (only as substitutional defects), whereas the\nlatter form deep levels. The band structure calculated with the pSIC shows an\nexcellent agreement with experimental data. In particular, the gap for\ndefect-free In2O3 is 2.85 eV, which compares fairly with the experimental range\n2.3-2.9 eV. The pSIC results also point to a change from indirect to direct\ngaps depending on doping. In relation to the optical properties, obtained\nwithin the random phase approximation, it is shown that they are mostly\naffected by the presence of oxygen vacancies.\n", "  We show that the first order form of the Schrodinger equation proposed in [1]\ncan be obtained from the Dirac equation in the non-relativistic limit. We also\nshow that the Pauli Hamiltonian is obtained from this equation by requiring\nlocal gauge invariance. In addition, we study the problem of a spin up particle\nincident on a finite potential barrier and show that the known quantum\nmechanical results are obtained. Finally, we consider the symmetric potential\nwell and show that the quantum mechanical expression for the quantized energy\nlevels of a particle is obtained with periodic boundary conditions. Based on\nthese conclusions, we propose that the equation introduced in [1] is the\nnon-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation and more appropriately describes\nspin 1/2 particles in the non-relativistic limit.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of highly charged\nand excited electron-hole complexes in strain-free (111) GaAs/AlGaAs quantum\ndots grown by droplet epitaxy. We address the complexes with one of the charge\ncarriers residing in the excited state, namely, the ``hot'' trions X$^{-*}$ and\nX$^{+*}$, and the doubly negatively charged exciton X$^{2-}$. Our\nmagneto-photoluminescence experiments performed on single quantum dots in the\nFaraday geometry uncover characteristic emission patterns for each excited\nelectron-hole complex, which are very different from the photoluminescence\nspectra observed in (001)-grown quantum dots. We present a detailed theory of\nthe fine structure and magneto-photoluminescence spectra of X$^{-*}$, X$^{+*}$\nand X$^{2-}$ complexes, governed by the interplay between the electron-hole\nCoulomb exchange interaction and the heavy-hole mixing, characteristic for\nthese quantum dots with a trigonal symmetry. Comparison between experiment and\ntheory of the magneto-photoluminescence allows for precise charge state\nidentification, as well as extraction of electron-hole exchange interaction\nconstants and $g$-factors for the charge carriers occupying excited states.\n", "  In a direct detection scheme we observed 7.8 dB of twin-beam squeezing for\nmulti-mode two-color squeezed vacuum generated via parametric down conversion.\nApplying post-selection, we conditionally prepared a sub-Poissonian state of\nlight containing $6.3\\cdot10^5$ photons per pulse on the average with the Fano\nfactor $0.63\\pm0.01$. The scheme can be considered as the heralded preparation\nof pulses with the mean energy varying between tens and hundreds of fJ and the\nuncertainty considerably below the shot-noise level. Such pulses can be used in\nmetrology (for instance, for radiometers calibration) as well as for probing\nmulti-mode nonlinear optical effects.\n", "  We study transmission lines made of memory capacitive (memcapacitive)\nmaterials. The transmission properties of these lines can be adjusted on demand\nusing an appropriate sequence of pulses. In particular, we demonstrate a pulse\ncombination that creates a periodic modulation of dielectric properties along\nthe line. Such a structure resembles a distributed Bragg reflector having\nimportant optical applications. We present simulation results demonstrating all\nmajor steps of such a reconfigurable device operation including reset,\nprogramming and transmission of small amplitude signals. The proposed\nreconfigurable transmission lines employ only passive memory materials and can\nbe realized using available memcapacitive devices.\n", "  We propose an efficient protocol for digital quantum simulation of quantum\nchemistry problems and enhanced digital-analog quantum simulation of transport\nphenomena in biomolecules with superconducting circuits. Along these lines, we\noptimally digitize fermionic models of molecular structure with single-qubit\nand two-qubit gates, by means of Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation. Furthermore, we address the modelling of system-environment\ninteractions of biomolecules involving bosonic degrees of freedom with a\ndigital-analog approach. Finally, we consider gate-truncated quantum algorithms\nto allow the study of environmental effects.\n", "  HD 142527A is one of the most studied Herbig Ae/Be stars with a transitional\ndisk, as it has the largest imaged gap in any protoplanetary disk: the gas is\ncleared from 30 to 90 AU. The HD142527 system is also unique in that it has a\nstellar companion with a small mass compared to the mass of the primary star.\nThis factor of ~20 in mass ratio between the two objects makes this binary\nsystem different from any other YSO. The HD142527 system could therefore\nprovide a valuable test bed. This low-mass stellar object may be responsible\nfor both the gap and dust trapping observed by ALMA at longer distances. We\nobserved this system with the NACO and GPI instruments using the aperture\nmasking technique. Aperture masking is ideal for providing high dynamic range\neven at very small angular separations. We present the spectral energy\ndistribution for HD142527A and B. Brightness of the companion is now known from\nthe R band up to the M' band. We also followed the orbital motion of HD 142527B\nover a period of more than two years. The SED of the companion is compatible\nwith a T=3000+/-100K object in addition to a 1700K blackbody environment\n(likely a circus-secondary disk). From evolution models, we find that it is\ncompatible with an object of mass 0.13+/-0.03Msun, radius 0.90+/-0.15Rsun, and\nage $1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.75}$Myr. This age is significantly younger than the age\npreviously estimated for HD142527A. Computations to constrain the orbital\nparameters found a semi major axis of $140^{+120}_{-70}$mas, an eccentricity of\n0.5+/-0.2, an inclination of 125+/-15 degrees, and a position angle of the\nright ascending node of -5+/-40 degrees. Inclination and position angle of the\nascending node are in agreement with an orbit coplanar with the inner disk, not\ncoplanar with the outer disk. Despite its high eccentricity, it is unlikely\nthat HD142527B is responsible for truncating the inner edge of the outer disk.\n", "  We present the lattice QCD studies for baryon-baryon interactions for the\nfirst time with (almost) physical quark masses. $N_f = 2+1$ gauge\nconfigurations are generated with the Iwasaki gauge action and\nnonperturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson quark action with stout smearing on\nthe lattice of $(96 a)^4 \\simeq (8.2 {\\rm fm})^4$ with $a \\simeq 0.085$ fm,\nwhere $m_\\pi \\simeq 146$ MeV and $m_K \\simeq 525$ MeV. Baryon forces are\ncalculated from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) correlation functions using the\ntime-dependent HAL QCD method. In this report, we first give the general\noverview of the theoretical frameworks essential to the physical point\ncalculation of baryon forces. We then present the numerical results for the\ntwo-nucleon central and tensor forces in $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ coupled channel and\nthe central force in $^1S_0$ channel. In particular, a clear signal is obtained\nfor the tensor force.\n", "  Quantum spin models with spatially dependent interactions, known as compass\nmodels, play an important role in the study of frustrated quantum magnetism.\nOne example is the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with spin-liquid\nground states and anyonic excitations. Another example is the geometrically\nfrustrated quantum $120^\\circ$ model on the same lattice whose ground state has\nnot been unambiguously established. To generalize the Kitaev model beyond the\nexactly solvable limit and connect it with other compass models, we propose a\nnew model, dubbed \"the tripod model\", which contains a continuum of\ncompass-type models. It smoothly interpolates the Ising model, the Kitaev\nmodel, and the quantum $120^\\circ$ model by tuning a single parameter\n$\\theta'$, the angle between the three legs of a tripod in the spin space.\nHence it not only unifies three paradigmatic spin models, but also enables the\nstudy of their quantum phase transitions. We obtain the phase diagram of the\ntripod model numerically by tensor networks in the thermodynamic limit. We show\nthat the ground state of the quantum $120^\\circ$ model has long-range dimer\norder. Moreover, we find an extended spin-disordered (spin-liquid) phase\nbetween the dimer phase and an antiferromagnetic phase. The unification and\nsolution of a continuum of frustrated spin models as outline here may be useful\nto exploring new domains of other quantum spin or orbital models.\n", "  Granular matter at the jamming transition is poised on the brink of\nmechanical stability, and hence it is possible that these random systems have\ntopologically protected surface phonons. Studying two model systems for jammed\nmatter, we find states that exhibit distinct mechanical topological classes,\nprotected surface modes, and ubiquitous Weyl points. The detailed statistics of\nthe boundary modes enable tests of a standard understanding of the detailed\nfeatures of the jamming transition, and show that parts of this argument are\ninvalid.\n", "  Electrostriction is an important material property that characterizes how\nstrain changes with the development of polarization inside a material. We show\nthat \\textit{ab initio }techniques developed in recent years can be exploited\nto compute and understand electrostriction of ferroelectric materials. Here,\nelectrostriction coefficients of ferroelectric BaTiO$_{3}$, PbTiO$_{3}$, as\nwell as dielectric BaZrO$_{3}$, are obtained and analyzed. Possible causes of\nthe difference between experimental and numerical results are discussed. We\nalso identified that relative displacements between certain ions at a given\npolarization could be a good indicator of a material's electrostriction\nproperty.\n", "  By generalising concepts from classical stochastic dynamics, we establish the\nbasis for a theory of metastability in Markovian open quantum systems. Partial\nrelaxation into long-lived metastable states - distinct from the asymptotic\nstationary state - is a manifestation of a separation of timescales due to a\nsplitting in the spectrum of the generator of the dynamics. We show here how to\nexploit this spectral structure to obtain a low dimensional approximation to\nthe dynamics in terms of motion in a manifold of metastable states constructed\nfrom the low-lying eigenmatrices of the generator. We argue that the metastable\nmanifold is in general composed of disjoint states, noiseless subsystems and\ndecoherence-free subspaces.\n", "  We study the heat conductivity in Anderson insulators in the presence of\npower-law interaction. Particle-hole excitations built on localized electron\nstates are viewed as two-level systems randomly distributed in space and energy\nand coupled due to electron-electron interaction. A small fraction of these\nstates form resonant pairs that in turn build a complex network allowing for\nenergy propagation. We identify the character of energy transport through this\nnetwork and evaluate the thermal conductivity. For physically relevant cases of\n2D and 3D spin systems with $1/r^3$ dipole-dipole interaction (originating from\nthe conventional $1/r$ Coulomb interaction between electrons), the found\nthermal conductivity $\\kappa$ scales with temperature as $\\kappa\\propto T^3 $\nand $\\kappa\\propto T^{4/3}$, respectively. Our results may be of relevance also\nto other realizations of random spin Hamiltonians with long-range interactions.\n", "  We explore the relic density of dark matter and the particle spectrum within\na constrained version of an $E_6$ inspired SUSY model with an extra $U(1)_N$\ngauge symmetry. In this model a single exact custodial symmetry forbids\ntree-level flavor-changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton\nnumber violating operators. We present a set of benchmark points showing\nscenarios that have a SM-like Higgs mass of 125 GeV and sparticle masses above\nthe LHC limits. They lead to striking new physics signatures which may be\nobserved during run II of the LHC and can distinguish this model from the\nsimplest SUSY extensions of the SM. At the same time these benchmark scenarios\nare consistent with the measured dark matter abundance and necessarily lead to\nlarge dark matter direct detection cross sections close to current limits and\nobservable soon at the XENON1T experiment.\n", "  Though electrical noise and conduction current are assigned to corpuscle-like\nelectrons drifting in solid matter, this model hardly fits in the\nFluctuation-Dissipation framework. However, fluctuations of energy due to\ndisplacements of single electrons between two close conductors lead to a\ndiscrete noise model looking like continuous in practice. The complex\nAdmittance it uses for the displacement and conduction currents between such\nconductors, allows a treatment of fluctuations and dissipations of electrical\nenergy that excels the example of Callen and Welton using the complex Impedance\nof resistors. The new model thus obtained not only unifies the phase noise of\nelectronic oscillators with the linewidth of lasers, but also explains why the\nshot noise that the drift theory assigns to conduction currents is not\nobserved.\n", "  The dynamics of relativistic (scalar and vector) bosons through nonminimal\nvector square (well and barrier) potentials is studied in the\nDuffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. We show that the problem can be mapped in\neffective Schrodinger equations for a component of the DKP spinor. An\noscillatory transmission coefficient is found and there is total reflection.\nAdditionally, the energy spectrum of bound states is obtained and reveals the\nSchiff-Snyder-Weinberg effect, for specific conditions the potential lodges\nbound states of particles and antiparticles.\n", "  We study the Kondo chain in the regime of high spin concentration where the\nlow energy physics is dominated by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction. As has been recently shown (A. M. Tsvelik and O. M. Yevtushenko,\nPhys. Rev. Lett 115, 216402 (2015)), this model has two phases with drastically\ndifferent transport properties depending on the anisotropy of the exchange\ninteraction. In particular, the helical symmetry of the fermions is\nspontaneously broken when the anisotropy is of the easy plane type (EP). This\nleads to a parametrical suppression of the localization effects. In the present\npaper we substantially extend the previous theory, in particular, by analyzing\na competition of forward- and backward- scattering, including into the theory\nshort range electron interactions and calculating spin correlation functions.\nWe discuss applicability of our theory and possible experiments which could\nsupport the theoretical findings.\n", "  We consider a generalised diffusion equation in two dimensions for modeling\ndiffusion on a comb-like structures. We analyse the probability distribution\nfunctions and we derive the mean squared displacement in $x$ and $y$\ndirections. Different forms of the memory kernels (Dirac delta, power-law, and\ndistributed order) are considered. It is shown that anomalous diffusion may\noccur along both $x$ and $y$ directions. Ultraslow diffusion and some more\ngeneral diffusive processes are observed as well. We give the corresponding\ncontinuous time random walk model for the considered two dimensional\ndiffusion-like equation on a comb, and we derive the probability distribution\nfunctions which subordinate the process governed by this equation to the Wiener\nprocess.\n", "  Borophene (two-dimensional boron sheet) is a new type of two-dimensional\nmaterial, which was recently grown successfully on single crystal Ag\nsubstrates. In this paper, we investigate the electronic structure and bonding\ncharacteristics of borophene by first-principle calculations. The band\nstructure of borophene shows highly anisotropic metallic behaviour. The\nobtained optical properties of borophene exhibit strong anisotropy as well. The\ncombination of high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity in\nborophene makes it a promising candidate for future design of transparent\nconductors used in photovoltaics. Finally, the thermodynamic properties are\ninvestigated based on the phonon properties.\n", "  We present new clean maps of the CMB temperature anisotropies (as measured by\nPlanck) constructed with a novel internal linear combination (ILC) algorithm\nusing directional, scale-discretised wavelets --- Scale-discretised,\ndirectional wavelet ILC or SILC. Directional wavelets, when convolved with\nsignals on the sphere, can separate the anisotropic filamentary structures\nwhich are characteristic of both the CMB and foregrounds. Extending previous\ncomponent separation methods, which use the frequency, spatial and harmonic\nsignatures of foregrounds to separate them from the cosmological background\nsignal, SILC can additionally use morphological information in the foregrounds\nand CMB to better localise the cleaning algorithm. We test the method on Planck\ndata and simulations, demonstrating consistency with existing component\nseparation algorithms, and discuss how to optimise the use of morphological\ninformation by varying the number of directional wavelets as a function of\nspatial scale. We find that combining the use of directional and axisymmetric\nwavelets depending on scale could yield higher quality CMB temperature maps.\nOur results set the stage for the application of SILC to polarisation\nanisotropies through an extension to spin wavelets.\n", "  It is shown that probability densities of finite-time Lyapunov exponents,\ncorresponding to chimera states, have a characteristic shape. Such\ndistributions could be used as a signature of chimera states, particularly in\nsystems for which the phases of all the oscillators cannot be measured\ndirectly. In such cases, the characteristic distribution may be obtained\nindirectly, via embedding techniques, thus making it possible to detect chimera\nstates in systems where they could otherwise exist, unnoticed.\n", "  In this paper, following the Backus (1962) approach, we examine expressions\nfor elasticity parameters of a homogeneous generally anisotropic medium that is\nlong-wave-equivalent to a stack of thin generally anisotropic layers. These\nexpressions reduce to the results of Backus (1962) for the case of isotropic\nand transversely isotropic layers.\n  In the over half-a-century since the publications of Backus (1962) there have\nbeen numerous publications applying and extending that formulation. However,\nneither George Backus nor the authors of the present paper are aware of further\nexaminations of the mathematical underpinnings of the original formulation;\nhence this paper.\n  We prove that---within the long-wave approximation---if the thin layers obey\nstability conditions then so does the equivalent medium. We examine---within\nthe Backus-average context---the approximation of the average of a product as\nthe product of averages, which underlies the averaging process.\n  In the presented examination we use the expression of Hooke's law as a tensor\nequation; in other words, we use Kelvin's---as opposed to Voigt's---notation.\nIn general, the tensorial notation allows us to conveniently examine effects\ndue to rotations of coordinate systems.\n", "  An 852nm nanosecond laser pulse chain with a high on/off ratio is generated\nby chopping a continuous-wave laser beam using a Mach-Zehnder-type\nelectro-optic intensity modulator(MZ-EOIM). The detailed dependence of the\nMZ-EOIM's on/off ratio on various parameters is characterized. By optimizing\nthe incident beam polarization and stabilizing the MZ-EOIM temperature, a\nstatic on/off ratio of 12600:1 is achieved. The dynamic on/off ratios versus\nthe pulse repetition rate and the pulse duty cycle are measured and discussed.\nThe high-on/off-ratio nanosecond pulsed laser system was used in a triggered\nsingle-photon source based on a trapped single cesium atom, which reveals clear\nantibunching.\n", "  Some instances of electron field emitters are characterized by\nfrequency-dependent hysteresis in their current-voltage characteristics. We\nargue that such emitters can be classified as memristive systems and introduce\na general framework to describe their response. As a specific example of our\napproach, we consider field emission from a carbon nanotube array. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate a low-field hysteresis, which is likely caused\nby an electrostatic alignment of some of the nanotubes in the applied field. We\nformulate a memristive model of such phenomenon whose results are in agreement\nwith the experimental results.\n", "  Starting from an axisymmetric equilibrium distribution function (DF) in\naction space, representing a Milky Way thin disc stellar population, we use the\nlinearized Boltzmann equation to explicitly compute the response to a\nthree-dimensional spiral potential in terms of the perturbed DF. This DF, valid\naway from the main resonances, allows us to investigate a snapshot of the\nvelocity distribution at any given point in three-dimensional configuration\nspace. Moreover, the first order moments of the DF give rise to non-zero radial\nand vertical bulk flows -- namely breathing modes -- qualitatively similar to\nthose recently observed in the extended Solar neighbourhood. We show that these\nanalytically predicted mean stellar motions are in agreement with the outcome\nof test-particle simulations. Moreover, we estimate for the first time the\nreduction factor for the vertical bulk motions of a stellar population compared\nto the case of a cold fluid. Such an explicit expression for the full perturbed\nDF of a thin disc stellar population in the presence of spiral arms will be\nhelpful in order to dynamically interpret the detailed information on the Milky\nWay disc stellar kinematics that will be provided by upcoming large astrometric\nand spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy.\n", "  The three-dimensional topological insulator \\ce{Bi2Te3} differs from other\ntopological insulators in the \\ce{Bi2Se3} family in that the effective\nHamiltonian of its surface states on a flat semi-infinite slab requires the\naddition of a cubic momentum hexagonal warping term in order to reproduce the\nexperimentally measured constant energy contours. In this work, we derive the\nappropriate effective Hamiltonian for the surface states of a \\ce{Bi2Te3}\n\\textit{cylinder} incorporating the corresponding hexagonal warping terms in a\ncylindrical geometry. We show that at the energy range where the surface states\ndominate, the effective Hamiltonian adequately reproduces the dispersion\nrelation obtained from a full four-band Hamiltonian, which describe both the\nbulk and surface states. As an example application of our effective\nHamiltonian, we study the transmission between two collinear \\ce{Bi2Te3}\ncylinders magnetized in different directions perpendicular to their axes. We\nshow that the hexagonal warping term results in a transmission profile between\nthe cylinders which may be of utility in a multiple state magnetic memory bit.\n", "  We introduce an alternative way of closing Maxwell like algebras. We show,\nthrough a suitable change of basis, that resulting algebras are given by the\ndirect sums of the AdS and the Maxwell algebras already known in the\nliterature. Casting the result into the $S$-expansion method framework ensures\nthe straightaway construction of the gravity theories based on a found\nenlargement.\n", "  Stochastic processes with absorbing states feature remarkable examples of\nnon-equilibrium universal phenomena. While a broad understanding has been\nprogressively established in the classical regime, relatively little is known\nabout the behavior of these non-equilibrium systems in the presence of quantum\nfluctuations. Here we theoretically address such a scenario in an open quantum\nspin model which in its classical limit undergoes a directed percolation phase\ntransition. By mapping the problem to a non-equilibrium field theory, we show\nthat the introduction of quantum fluctuations stemming from coherent, rather\nthan statistical, spin-flips alters the nature of the transition such that it\nbecomes first-order. In the intermediate regime, where classical and quantum\ndynamics compete on equal terms, we highlight the presence of a bicritical\npoint with universal features different from the directed percolation class in\nlow dimension. We finally propose how this physics could be explored within\ngases of interacting atoms excited to Rydberg states.\n", "  A search for the pair production of top squarks, each with R-parity-violating\ndecays into two Standard Model quarks, is performed using 17.4 fb$^{-1}$ of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC. Each top squark is assumed to decay to a b- and an\ns-quark, leading to four quarks in the final state. Background discrimination\nis achieved with the use of b-tagging and selections on the mass and\nsubstructure of large-radius jets, providing sensitivity to top squark masses\nas low as 100 GeV. No evidence of an excess beyond the Standard Model\nbackground prediction is observed and top squarks decaying to $\\bar{b}\\bar{s}$\nare excluded for top squark masses in the range $100 \\leq m_{\\tilde{t}} \\leq\n315$ GeV at 95% confidence level.\n", "  We investigate theories in which gravity arises as a consequence of entropy.\nWe distinguish between two approaches to this idea: holographic gravity, in\nwhich Einstein's equation arises from keeping entropy stationary in equilibrium\nunder variations of the geometry and quantum state of a small region, and\nthermodynamic gravity, in which Einstein's equation emerges as a local equation\nof state from constraints on the area of a dynamical lightsheet in a fixed\nspacetime background. Examining holographic gravity, we argue that its\nunderlying assumptions can be justified in part using recent results on the\nform of the modular energy in quantum field theory. For thermodynamic gravity,\non the other hand, we find that it is difficult to formulate a self-consistent\ndefinition of the entropy, which represents an obstacle for this approach. This\ninvestigation points the way forward in understanding the connections between\ngravity and entanglement.\n", "  We examine the evolution of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which has been shown to reproduce the\nobserved redshift z=0.1 colour-magnitude distribution well. The median u-r of\nstar-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z=2 to 0 at fixed\nstellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red\nsequence starts to build-up around z=1, due to the quenching of low-mass\nsatellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive\ncentral galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This\nleaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z=1, which is\nmostly filled in by z=0. We quantify the time-scales of colour transition due\nto satellite and AGN quenching, finding that most galaxies spend less than 2\nGyr in the 'green valley'. On examining the trajectories of galaxies in a\ncolour-stellar mass diagram, we identify three characteristic tracks that\ngalaxies follow (quiescently star-forming, quenching and rejuvenating galaxies)\nand quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track.\n", "  We make predictions for the cross sections of coherent photoproduction of\n$\\rho$, $\\phi$, $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, and $\\Upsilon(1S)$ mesons in Pb-Pb\nultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV in the kinematics\nof run 2 at the Large Hadron Collider extending the approaches successfully\ndescribing the available Pb-Pb UPC data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Our\nresults illustrate the important roles of hadronic fluctuations of the photon\nand inelastic nuclear shadowing in photoproduction of light vector mesons on\nnuclei and the large leading twist nuclear gluon shadowing in photoproduction\nof quarkonia on nuclei. We show that the ratio of $\\psi(2S)$ and $J/\\psi$\nphotoproduction cross sections in Pb-Pb UPCs is largely determined by the ratio\nof these cross sections on the proton. We also argue that UPCs with\nelectromagnetic excitations of the colliding ions followed by the forward\nneutron emission allows one to significantly increase the range of photon\nenergies accessed in vector meson photoproduction on nuclei.\n", "  Matchgates are a restricted set of two-qubit gates known to be classically\nsimulable under particular conditions. Specifically, if a circuit consists only\nof nearest-neighbour matchgates, an efficient classical simulation is possible\nif either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation\nrequires computing probabilities of multi-qubit outcomes (including also\nadaptive measurements), or (ii) if the input is an arbitrary product state, but\nthe output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend\nthese results to show that matchgates are classically simulable even in the\nmost general combination of these settings, namely, if the inputs are arbitrary\nproduct states, if the measurements are over arbitrarily many output qubits,\nand if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary\nsingle-qubit measurements, albeit only in a weaker notion of classical\nsimulation. These results make for an interesting contrast with other\nrestricted models of computation, such as Clifford circuits or (bosonic) linear\noptics, where the complexity of simulation varies greatly under similar\nmodifications.\n", "  The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum physics. It\nimplies that the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables can not\nbe predicted simultaneously. In quantum information theory, this principle can\nbe expressed in terms of entropic measures. Berta \\emph{et al}.\n[\\href{http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nphys1734}{ Nature Phys. 6, 659\n(2010) }] have indicated that uncertainty bound can be altered by considering a\nparticle as a quantum memory correlating with the primary particle. In this\narticle, we obtain a lower bound for entropic uncertainty in the presence of a\nquantum memory by adding an additional term depending on Holevo quantity and\nmutual information. We conclude that our lower bound will be tighten with\nrespect to that of Berta \\emph{et al.}, when the accessible information about\nmeasurements outcomes is less than the mutual information of the joint state.\nSome examples have been investigated for which our lower bound is tighter than\nthe Berta's \\emph{et al.} lower bound. Using our lower bound, a lower bound for\nthe entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states has obtained, as well\nas an upper bound for the regularized distillable common randomness.\n", "  By the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we have\nsystematically studied the electronic structures of recently discovered\nextremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) materials LaSb and LaBi. We find that\nboth LaSb and LaBi are semimetals with the electron and hole carriers in\nperfect balance. The calculated carrier densities in the order of $10^{20}$\ncm$^{-3}$ are in good agreement with the experimental values, implying long\nmean free time of carriers and thus high carrier mobilities. With a\nsemiclassical two-band model, the perfect charge compensation and high carrier\nmobilities naturally explain (i) the XMR observed in LaSb and LaBi; (ii) the\nnon-saturating quadratic dependence of XMR on external magnetic field; and\n(iii) the resistivity plateau in the turn-on temperature behavior at very low\ntemperatures. The explanation of these features without resorting to the\ntopological effect indicates that they should be the common characteristics of\nall perfectly electron-hole compensated semimetals.\n", "  Horndeski gravity holds a special position as the most general extension of\nEinstein's theory of general relativity with a single scalar degree of freedom\nand second-order field equations. Because of these features, Horndeski gravity\nis an attractive phenomenological playground to investigate the consequences of\nmodifications of general relativity in cosmology and astrophysics. We present a\nreview of the progress made so far in the study of compact objects (black holes\nand neutron stars) within Horndeski gravity. In particular, we review our\nrecent work on slowly rotating black holes and present some new results on\nslowly rotating neutron stars.\n", "  Results are reported of a search for new phenomena, such as supersymmetric\nparticle production, that could be observed in high-energy proton--proton\ncollisions. Events with large numbers of jets, together with missing transverse\nmomentum from unobserved particles, are selected. The data analysed were\nrecorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 using the 13 TeV centre-of-mass\nproton--proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The search selected events with various\njet multiplicities from $\\ge 7$ to $\\ge 10$ jets, and with various $b$-jet\nmultiplicity requirements to enhance sensitivity. No excess above Standard\nModel expectations is observed. The results are interpreted within two\nsupersymmetry models, where gluino masses up to 1400 GeV are excluded at 95%\nconfidence level, significantly extending previous limits.\n", "  We study optimal synchronization of networks of coupled phase oscillators. We\nextend previous theory for optimizing the synchronization properties of\nundirected networks to the important case of directed networks. We derive a\ngeneralized synchrony alignment function that encodes the interplay between\nnetwork structure and the oscillators' natural frequencies and serves as an\nobjective measure for the network's degree of synchronization. Using the\ngeneralized synchrony alignment function, we show that a network's\nsynchronization properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also\nallows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in\nparticular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal\nin- and out-degrees. For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks\nthe heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the\nheterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship\nemerges for out-degrees. We also observe that a network's synchronization\nproperties are promoted by a strong correlation between the nodal in-degrees\nand the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between\nthe nodal out-degrees and the natural frequencies has comparatively little\neffect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that\nsynchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies\nwith the left singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of\nthe Laplacian matrix.\n", "  Spin textures in k-space arising from spin-orbit coupling in\nnon-centrosymmetric crystals find numerous applications in spintronics. We\npresent a mechanism that leads to appearance of k-space spin texture due to\nspontaneous symmetry breaking driven by electronic correlations. Using\ndynamical mean-field theory we show that doping a spin-triplet excitonic\ninsulator provides a means of creating new thermodynamic phases with unique\nproperties. The numerical results are interpreted using analytic calculations\nwithin a generalized double-exchange framework.\n", "  We study critical behavior of the diluted 2D Ising model in the presence of\ndisorder correlations which decay algebraically with distance as $\\sim r^{-a}$.\nMapping the problem onto 2D Dirac fermions with correlated disorder we\ncalculate the critical properties using renormalization group up to two-loop\norder. We show that beside the Gaussian fixed point the flow equations have a\nnon trivial fixed point which is stable for $0.995<a<2$ and is characterized by\nthe correlation length exponent $\\nu= 2/a + O((2-a)^3)$. Using bosonization, we\nalso calculate the averaged square of the spin-spin correlation function and\nfind the corresponding critical exponent $\\eta_2=1/2-(2-a)/4+O((2-a)^2)$.\n", "  It is commonly assumed that if the optical metric of a dielectric medium is\nidentical to the metric of a vacuum space-time then light propagation through\nthe dielectric mimics light propagation in the vacuum. However, just as the\ncurved surface of the Earth cannot be mapped into a flat plane without\ndistortion of some surface features, so too is it impossible to project the\nbehavior of light from the vacuum into a dielectric analog residing in\nMinkowski space-time without introducing distortions. We study the covariance\nproperties of dielectric analog space-times and the kinematics of a congruence\nof light in the analog, and show how certain features can be faithfully\nemulated in the analog depending on the choice of projection, but that not all\nfeatures can be simultaneously emulated without distortion. These findings\nindicate conceptual weaknesses in the idea of using analog space-times as a\nbasis for transformation optics, and we show that a certain formulation of\ntransformation optics closely related to analog space-times resolves these\nissues.\n", "  In high energy physics, scholarly papers circulate primarily through online\npreprint archives based on a centralized repository, arXiv, that physicists\nsimply refer to as \"the archive\". This is not just a tool for preservation and\nmemory, but also a space of flows where written objects are detected and their\nauthors made available for scrutiny. In this work I analyze the reading and\npublishing practices of two subsets of high energy physicists: theorists and\nexperimentalists. In order to be recognized as legitimate and productive\nmembers of their community, they need to abide by the temporalities and\nauthorial practices structured by the archive. Theorists live in a state of\naccelerated time that shapes their reading and publishing practices around\nprecise cycles. Experimentalists turn to tactics that allow them to circumvent\nthe slowed-down time and invisibility they experience as members of large\ncollaborations. As digital platforms for the exchange of scholarly articles\nemerge in other fields, high energy physics could help shed light on general\ntransformations of contemporary scholarly communication systems.\n", "  We adapt Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the case of undirected\nnetworks, both weighted and unweighted, and investigate the measure in a\nvariety of model and real-world networks. We find that most nodes and edges in\nmodel and real networks have a negative curvature. Furthermore, the\ndistribution of Forman curvature of nodes and edges is narrow in random and\nsmall-world networks, while the distribution is broad in scale-free and\nreal-world networks. In most networks, Forman curvature is found to display\nsignificant negative correlation with degree and centrality measures. However,\nForman curvature is uncorrelated with clustering coefficient in most networks.\nImportantly, we find that both model and real networks are vulnerable to\ntargeted deletion of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature. Our results\nsuggest that Forman curvature can be employed to gain novel insights on the\norganization of complex networks.\n", "  In this paper we consider a random potential derived from the Brownian\nmotion. We obtain upper and lower bounds for the expected value of the main\neigenvalue of the associated Ruelle operator and for its quenched topological\npressure. We also exhibit an isomorphism between the space $C(\\Omega)$ endowed\nwith its standard norm and a proper closed subspace of the Skorokhod space\nwhich is used to obtain a stochastic functional equation for the main\neigenvalue and for its associated eigenfunction.\n", "  The iron chalcogenides FeSe and FeS are superconductors composed of\ntwo-dimensional sheets held together by van der Waals interactions, which makes\nthem prime candidates for the intercalation of various guest species. We review\nthe intercalation chemistry of FeSe and FeS superconductors and discuss their\nsynthesis, structure, and physical properties. Before we review the latest work\nin this area, we provide a brief background on the intercalation chemistry of\nother inorganic materials that exhibit enhanced superconducting properties upon\nintercalation, which include the transition metal dichalcogenides, fullerenes,\nand layered cobalt oxides. From past studies of these intercalated\nsuperconductors, we discuss the role of the intercalates in terms of charge\ndoping, structural distortions, and Fermi surface reconstruction. We also\nbriefly review the physical and chemical properties of the host\nmaterials---mackinawite-type FeS and $\\beta$-FeSe. The three types of\nintercalates for the iron chalcogenides can be placed in three categories: 1.)\nalkali and alkaline earth cations intercalated through the liquid ammonia\ntechnique; 2.) cations intercalated with organic amines such as\nethylenediamine; and 3.) layered hydroxides intercalated during hydrothermal\nconditions. A recurring theme in these studies is the role of the intercalated\nguest in electron doping the chalcogenide host and in enhancing the\ntwo-dimensionality of the electronic structure by spacing the FeSe layers\napart. We end this review discussing possible new avenues in the intercalation\nchemistry of transition metal monochalcogenides, and the promise of these\nmaterials as a unique set of new inorganic two-dimensional systems.\n", "  A novel mass generation procedure for an Abelian vector field is proposed.\nThis procedure is based on the construction of a class of gauge theories whose\nfree limit describes a free massless vector field and a set of massless real\nscalar fields by means of the antifield-BRST deformation technique. The\nrelationship between our results and those arising from the Higgs mechanism\nbased on the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an Abelian gauge symmetry is\nemphasized. Some examples with one, two, and three scalars are given.\n", "  We present a first QCD analysis of next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO)\ncontributions of the spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PPDFs) in\nthe nucleon and their uncertainties using the Jacobi polynomial approach.\nHaving the NNLO contributions of the quark-quark and gluon-quark splitting\nfunctions in perturbative QCD (Nucl. Phys. B 889 (2014) 351-400), one can\nobtain the evolution of longitudinally polarized parton densities of hadrons up\nto NNLO accuracy of QCD. A very large sets of recent and up-to-date\nexperimental data of spin structure functions of the proton $g_1^p$, neutron\n$g_1^n$, and deuteron $g_1^d$ have been used in this analysis. The predictions\nfor the NNLO calculations of the polarized parton distribution functions as\nwell as the proton, neutron and deuteron polarized structure functions are\ncompared with the corresponding results of the NLO approximation. We form a\nmutually consistent set of polarized PDFs due to the inclusion of the most\navailable experimental data including the recently high-precision measurements\nfrom {\\tt COMPASS16} experiments (Phys. Lett. B 753 (2016) 18-28). We have\nperformed a careful estimation of the uncertainties using the most common and\npractical method, the Hessian method, for the polarized PDFs originating from\nthe experimental errors. The proton, neutron and deuteron structure functions\nand also their first moments, $\\Gamma^{\\rm p, n, d}$, are in good agreement\nwith the experimental data at small and large momentum fraction of $x$. We will\ndiscuss how our knowledge of spin-dependence structure functions can improve at\nsmall and large value of $x$ by the recent {\\tt COMPASS16} measurements at\nCERN, the {\\tt PHENIX} and {\\tt STAR} measurements at RHIC, and at the future\nproposed colliders such as Electron-Ion collider (EIC).\n", "  This is the second in a series of papers aiming to test how the mass ($M_{\\rm\nBH}$), accretion rate ($\\dot{M}$) and spin ($a_{*}$) of super massive black\nholes (SMBHs) determine the observed properties of type-I active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). Our project utilizes a sample of 39 unobscured AGN at\n$z\\simeq1.55$ observed by VLT/X-shooter, selected to map a large range in\n$M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L/L_{\\rm edd}$ and covers the most prominent UV-optical\n(broad) emission lines, including H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, MgII, and CIV. This\npaper focuses on single-epoch, \"virial\" $M_{\\rm BH}$ determinations from broad\nemission lines and examines the implications of different continuum modeling\napproaches in line width measurements. We find that using a \"local\" power-law\ncontinuum instead of a physically-motivated thin disk continuum leads to only\nslight underestimation of the FWHM of the lines and the associated $M_{\\rm\nBH}\\left({\\rm FWHM}\\right)$. However, the line dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm line}$\nand associated $M_{\\rm BH}\\left(\\sigma_{\\rm line}\\right)$ are strongly affected\nby the continuum placement and provides less reliable mass estimates than\nFWHM-based methods. Our analysis shows that H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and MgII can be\nsafely used for virial $M_{\\rm BH}$ estimation. The CIV line, on the other\nhand, is not reliable in the majority of the cases, this may indicate that the\ngas emitting this line is not virialized. While H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ show\nvery similar line widths, the mean ${\\rm FWHM\\left(MgII\\right)}$ is about 30%\nnarrower than ${\\rm FWHM\\left(H\\beta\\right)}$. We confirm several recent\nsuggestions to improve the accuracy in CIV-based mass estimates, relying on\nother UV emission lines. Such improvements do not reduce the scatter between\nCIV-based and Balmer-line-based mass estimates.\n", "  Muon spin rotation technique is used to study magnetic ordering in ultra-pure\nsamples of SrCu$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$O$_2$, an archetypical $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg chain system with a small amount of $S=1$ defects. The ordered state\nin the parent compound is shown to be highly homogeneous, contrary to previous\nreport [M. Matsuda et al., Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{55}, R11953 (1997)]. Even\nminute amount of Ni impurities result in inhomogeneous order and a decrease of\nthe transition temperature. At as little as $0.5$~\\% Ni concentration, magnetic\nordering is entirely suppressed. The results are compared to previous\ntheoretical studies of weakly coupled spin chains with site-defects.\n", "  In this work we investigate the effects of ion accretion and size-dependent\ndust temperatures on the abundances of both gas-phase and grain-surface\nspecies. While past work has assumed a constant areal density for icy species,\nwe show that this assumption is invalid and the chemical differentiation over\ngrain sizes are significant. We use a gas-grain chemical code to numerically\ndemonstrate this in two typical interstellar conditions: dark cloud (DC) and\ncold neutral medium (CNM). It is shown that, although the grain size\ndistribution variation (but with the total grain surface area unchanged) has\nlittle effect on the gas-phase abundances, it can alter the abundances of some\nsurface species by factors up to $\\sim2-4$ orders of magnitude. The areal\ndensities of ice species are larger on smaller grains in the DC model as the\nconsequence of ion accretion. However, the surface areal density evolution\ntracks are more complex in the CNM model due to the combined effects of ion\naccretion and dust temperature variation. The surface areal density differences\nbetween the smallest ($\\sim 0.01\\mu$m) and the biggest ($\\sim 0.2\\mu$m) grains\ncan reach $\\sim$1 and $\\sim$5 orders of magnitude in the DC and CNM models,\nrespectively.\n", "  For the theoretical understanding of the reactivity of complex chemical\nsystems accurate relative energies between intermediates and transition states\nare required. Despite its popularity, density functional theory (DFT) often\nfails to provide sufficiently accurate data, especially for molecules\ncontaining transition metals. Due to the huge number of intermediates that need\nto be studied for all but the simplest chemical processes, DFT is to date the\nonly method that is computationally feasible. Here, we present a Bayesian\nframework for DFT that allows for error estimation of calculated properties.\nSince the optimal choice of parameters in present-day density functionals is\nstrongly system dependent, we advocate for a system-focused\nre-parameterization. While, at first sight, this approach conflicts with the\nfirst-principles character of DFT that should make it in principle system\nindependent, we deliberately introduce system dependence because we can then\nassign a stochastically meaningful error to the system-dependent\nparametrization that makes it non-arbitrary. By re-parameterizing a functional\nthat was derived on a sound physical basis to a chemical system of interest we\nobtain a functional that yields reliable confidence intervals for reaction\nenergies. We demonstrate our approach at the example of catalytic nitrogen\nfixation.\n", "  Searches for high-mass resonances in the dijet invariant mass spectrum with\none or two jets identified as $b$-jets are performed using an integrated\nluminosity of $3.2$ fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions with a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of anomalous phenomena is observed in\nthe data, which are used to exclude, at 95% credibility level, excited $b^{*}$\nquarks with masses from 1.1 TeV to 2.1 TeV and leptophobic $Z'$ bosons with\nmasses from 1.1 TeV to 1.5 TeV. Contributions of a Gaussian signal shape with\neffective cross sections ranging from approximately 0.4 to 0.001 pb are also\nexcluded in the mass range 1.5-5.0 TeV.\n", "  The density matrix renormalization group method is applied to obtain the\nground state phase diagram of the single impurity Anderson model on the\nhoneycomb lattice at half filling. The calculation of local static quantities\nshows that the phase diagram contains two distinct phases, the local moment\n(LM) phase and the asymmetric strong coupling (ASC) phase. These results are\nsupported by the local spin and charge excitation spectra, which exhibit\nqualitatively different behavior in these two phases and also reveal the\nexistence of the valence fluctuating point at the phase boundary. For\ncomparison, we also study the low-energy effective pseudogap Anderson model.\nAlthough the high-energy excitations are obviously different, we find that the\nground state phase diagram and the asymptotically low-energy excitations are in\ngood quantitative agreement with those for the single impurity Anderson model\non the honeycomb lattice, thus providing the first quantitative justification\nfor the previous studies based on low-energy approximate approaches.\nFurthermore, we find that the lowest entanglement level is doubly degenerate\nfor the LM phase, whereas it is singlet for the ASC phase and is accidentally\nthree fold degenerate at the valence fluctuating point. Our results therefore\nclearly demonstrate that the low-lying entanglement spectrum can be used to\ndetermine with high accuracy the phase boundary of the impurity quantum phase\ntransition.\n", "  We show that the conformal structure for the Riemannian analogues of Kerr\nblack-hole metrics can be given an ambitoric structure. We then discuss the\nproperties of the moment maps. In particular, we observe that the moment map\nimage is not locally convex near the singularity corresponding to the ring\nsingularity in the interior of the black hole. We then proceed to classify\nregular ambitoric $4$-orbifolds with some completeness assumptions. The tools\ndeveloped also allow us to prove a partial classification of compact Riemannian\n$4$-manifolds which admit a Killing $2$-form.\n", "  Chirality of materials in nature appears when there are asymmetries in their\nlattice structures or interactions in a certain environment. Recent development\nof quantum simulation technology has enabled the manipulation of qubits.\nAccordingly, chirality can be realized intentionally rather than passively\nobserved. Here we theoretically provide simple methods to create a chiral spin\nstate in a spin-1/2 qubit system on a square lattice. First, we show that\nswitching ON/OFF the Heisenberg and $XY$ interactions produces the chiral\ninteraction directly in the effective Hamiltonian without controlling local\nfields. Moreover, when initial states of spin-qubits are appropriately\nprepared, we prove that the chirality with desirable phase is dynamically\nobtained. Finally, even for the case where switching ON/OFF the interactions is\ninfeasible and the interactions are always-on, we show that, by preparing an\nasymmetric initial qubit state, the chirality whose phase is $\\pi/2$ is\ndynamically generated.\n", "  Scalar-tensor theories of gravity are extensions of General Relativity (GR)\nincluding an extra, nonminimally coupled scalar degree of freedom. A wide class\nof these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,\npredicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a\nnonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.\nThis effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling\n$\\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.\n$\\beta_0 \\lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing\nobservations.\n  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself\nas a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories\nwhere $\\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we\ninvestigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling\nfunctions with $\\beta_0>0$. This is done both through an energy balance\nanalysis of the existing equilibrium configurations, and by numerically\ndetermining the nonlinear Cauchy development of unstable initial data. We find\nthat, contrary to the $\\beta_0<0$ case, the final state of the instability is\nhighly sensitive to the details of the coupling function, varying from\ngravitational collapse to spontaneous scalarization. In particular, we show,\nfor the first time, that spontaneous scalarization can happen in theories with\n$\\beta_0>0$, which could give rise to novel astrophysical tests of the theory\nof gravity.\n", "  The CHY representation of scattering amplitudes is based on integrals over\nthe moduli space of a punctured sphere. We replace the punctured sphere by a\ndouble-cover version. The resulting scattering equations depend on a parameter\n$\\Lambda$ controlling the opening of a branch cut. The new representation of\nscattering amplitudes possesses an enhanced redundancy which can be used to\nfix, modulo branches, the location of four punctures while promoting $\\Lambda$\nto a variable. Via residue theorems we show how CHY formulas break up into sums\nof products of smaller (off-shell) ones times a propagator. This leads to a\npowerful way of evaluating CHY integrals of generic rational functions, which\nwe call the $\\Lambda$ algorithm.\n", "  The observed structure function (SF) of rotation measure (RM) varies as a\nbroken power-law function of angular scales. The systematic shallowness of its\nspectral slope is inconsistent with the standard Kolmogorov scaling. This\nmotivates us to examine the statistical analysis on RM fluctuations. The\ncorrelations of RM constructed by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2016) are demonstrated\nto be adequate in explaining the observed features of RM SFs through a direct\ncomparison between the theoretically obtained and observationally measured SF\nresults. By segregating the density and magnetic field fluctuations and\nadopting arbitrary indices for their respective power spectra, we find that\nwhen the SFs of RM and emission measure have a similar form over the same range\nof angular scales, the statistics of the RM fluctuations reflect the properties\nof density fluctuations. RM SFs can be used to evaluate the mean magnetic field\nalong the line of sight, but cannot serve as an informative source on the\nproperties of turbulent magnetic field in the interstellar medium. We identify\nthe spectral break of RM SFs as the inner scale of a shallow spectrum of\nelectron density fluctuations, which characterizes the typical size of discrete\nelectron density structures in the observed region.\n", "  We investigate circumstellar and explosion properties of Type Ibn supernovae\n(SNe) by analyzing their bolometric light curves. Bolometric light curves of\nType Ibn SNe generally have a large contrast between peak luminosity and\nlate-phase luminosity, which is much larger than those of 56Ni-powered SNe.\nThus, most of them are likely powered by the interaction between SN ejecta and\ndense circumstellar media. In addition, Type Ibn SNe decline much faster than\nType IIn SNe, and this indicates that the interaction in Type Ibn SNe ceases\nearlier than in Type IIn SNe. Thus, we argue that Type Ibn SN progenitors\nexperience high mass-loss rates in a short period just before explosion, while\nType IIn SN progenitors have high mass-loss rates sustained for a long time.\nFurthermore, we show that rise time and peak luminosity of Type Ibn and Type\nIIn SNe are similar and thus, they have similar explosion properties and\ncircumstellar density. The similar circumstellar density in the two kinds of\nSNe may indicate that mass-loss rates of Type Ibn SN progenitors are generally\nhigher than those of Type IIn as the wind velocities inferred from narrow\nspectral components are generally higher in Type Ibn SNe. We also show that\n56Ni mass and explosion energy of Type Ibn SNe may be smaller than those of\nother stripped-envelope SNe, probably because they tend to suffer large\nfallback or some of them may not even be terminal stellar explosions.\n", "  We apply the generalized Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, proposed by\nZechmeister and Kurster, to the solar neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande\n(Super-K) using data from its first five years. For each peak in the LS\nperiodogram, we evaluate the statistical significance in two different ways.\nThe first method involves calculating the False Alarm Probability (FAP) using\nnon-parametric bootstrap resampling, and the second method is by calculating\nthe difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between the null\nhypothesis, viz. the data contains only noise, compared to the hypothesis that\nthe data contains a peak at a given frequency. Using these methods, we scan the\nfrequency range between 7-14 cycles per year to look for any peaks caused by\nsolar rotation, since this is the proposed explanation for the statistically\nsignificant peaks found by Sturrock and collaborators in the Super-K dataset.\nFrom our analysis, we do confirm that similar to Sturrock et al, the maximum\npeak occurs at a frequency of 9.42/year, corresponding to a period of 38.75\ndays. The FAP for this peak is about 1.5% and the difference in BIC (between\npure white noise and this peak) is about 4.8. We note that the significance\ndepends on the frequency band used to search for peaks and hence it is\nimportant to use a search band appropriate for solar rotation. However, the\nsignificance of this peak based on the value of BIC is marginal and more data\nis needed to confirm if the peak persists and is real.\n", "  We present the design, realization and performance of a three-axis vector\nnano Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (nanoSQUID). It consists of\nthree mutually orthogonal SQUID nanoloops that allow distinguishing the three\ncomponents of the vector magnetic moment of individual nanoparticles placed at\na specific position. The device is based on Nb/HfTi/Nb Josephson junctions and\nexhibits linewidths of $\\sim 250$ nm and inner loop areas of $600 \\times 90$\nnm$^2$ and $500 \\times 500$ nm$^2$. Operation at temperature $T=4.2$ K, under\nexternal magnetic fields up to $\\sim 50$ mT is demonstrated. The experimental\nflux noise below $\\sim 250$ ${\\rm n}\\Phi_0/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ in the white noise\nlimit and the reduced dimensions lead to a total calculated spin sensitivity of\n$\\sim 630$ $\\mu_{\\rm B}/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ and $\\sim 70$ $\\mu_{\\rm B}/\\sqrt{\\rm\nHz}$ for the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the vector magnetic\nmoment, respectively. The potential of the device for studying tridimensional\nproperties of individual nanomagnets is discussed.\n", "  We develop explicit expressions for the surface second-harmonic radiation\nyield using the three layer model. We derive expressions that can be applied to\nsystems without and symmetry considerations, and then reduce them for the\n(111), (110), and (100) surface symmetries.\n", "  In the application of semiconductor detectors, the charge-sensitive amplifier\nis widely used in front-end electronics. The output signal is shaped by a\ntypical exponential decay. Depending on the feedback network, this type of\nfront-end electronics suffers from the ballistic deficit problem, or an\nincreased rate of pulse pile-ups. Moreover, spectroscopy applications require a\ncorrection of the pulse-height, while a shortened pulse-width is desirable for\nhigh-throughput applications. For both objectives, digital deconvolution of the\nexponential decay is convenient. With a general method and the signals of our\ncustom charge-sensitive amplifier for cadmium zinc telluride detectors, we show\nhow the transfer function of an amplifier is adapted to an infinite impulse\nresponse (IIR) filter. This paper investigates different design methods for an\nIIR filter in the discrete-time domain and verifies the obtained filter\ncoefficients with respect to the equivalent continuous-time frequency response.\nFinally, the exponential decay is shaped to a step-like output signal that is\nexploited by a forward-looking pulse processing.\n", "  A new numerical approach to entanglement entropies of the Renyi type is\nproposed for one-dimensional quantum field theories. The method extends the\ntruncated conformal spectrum approach and we will demonstrate that it is\nespecially suited to study the crossover from massless to massive behavior when\nthe subsystem size is comparable to the correlation length. We apply it to\ndifferent deformations of massless free fermions, corresponding to the scaling\nlimit of the Ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields. For massive\nfree fermions the exactly known crossover function is reproduced already in\nvery small system sizes. The new method treats ground states and excited states\non the same footing, and the applicability for excited states is illustrated by\nreproducing Renyi entropies of low-lying states in the transverse field Ising\nmodel.\n", "  The Turkish Atomic Energy Authority has been working on building an\nexperimental proton beamline using local resources at the Saraykoy Nuclear\nResearch and Training Center (SANAEM). The radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) was\nmanufactured after the completion of beam dynamics and 3D electromagnetic\nsimulation studies. The vanes were machined using a three axis CNC machine. A\nCMM was used for both the acceptance tests of the vanes and their assembly.\nProduction and assembly errors were found acceptable for this cavity, the very\nfirst one developed in Turkey. The aluminum vanes were copper coated by\nelectroplating. The coated vanes were bolted and bonded with eight screws,\neight pins and two different adhesives. A silver paste was used for RF sealing\nand a low vapor pressure epoxy was used for vacuum isolation. First LLRF tests\nof the RFQ were performed using the phase shift method with a bead-pull setup,\na VNA, an N-type RF coupler and a pick-up loop. Cavity quality factor was\nmeasured with 3dB method for different RF sealing stages. This study summarizes\nthe machining, assembling and the first LLRF tests of the SANAEM RFQ.\n", "  Gravitational instability (GI) features in several aspects of protostellar\ndisk evolution, most notably in angular momentum transport, fragmentation, and\nthe outbursts exemplified by FU Ori and EX Lupi systems. The outer regions of\nprotostellar discs may also be coupled to magnetic fields, which could then\nmodify the development of GI. To understand the basic elements of their\ninteraction, we perform local 2D ideal and resistive MHD simulations with an\nimposed toroidal field. In the regime of moderate plasma beta, we find that the\nsystem supports a hot gravito-turbulent state, characterised by considerable\nmagnetic energy and stress and a surprisingly large Toomre parameter $Q~10$.\nThis result has potential implications for disk structure, vertical thickness,\nionisation, etc. Our simulations also reveal the existence of long-lived and\ndense `magnetic islands' or plasmoids. Lastly, we find that the presence of a\nmagnetic field has little impact on the fragmentation criterion of the disk.\nThough our focus is on protostellar disks, some of our results may be relevant\nfor the outer radii of AGN.\n", "  In the context of high-accuracy computational thermochemistry, the valence\nCCSD correlation component of molecular atomization energies present the most\nsevere basis set convergence problem, followed by the (T) component. In the\npresent paper, we make a detailed comparison, for an expanded version of the\nW4-11 thermochemistry benchmark, between on the one hand orbital-based\nCCSD/AV{5,6}Z+d and CCSD/ACV{5,6}Z extrapolation, and on the other hand\nCCSD-F12b calculations with cc-pVQZ-F12 and cc-pV5Z-F12 basis sets. This latter\nbasis set, now available for H--He, B--Ne, and Al--Ar, is shown to be very\nclose to the basis set limit. Apparent differences (which can reach 0.35\nkcal/mol for systems like CCl4) between orbital-based and CCSD-F12b basis set\nlimits disappear if basis sets with additional radial flexibility, such as\nACV{5,6}Z, are used for the orbital calculation. Counterpoise calculations\nreveal that, while TAEs with V5Z-F12 basis sets are nearly free of BSSE,\norbital calculations have significant BSSE even with AV(6+d)Z basis sets,\nleading to non-negligible differences between raw and counterpoise-corrected\nextrapolated limits. This latter problem is greatly reduced by switching to\nACV{5,6}Z core-valence basis sets, or simply adding an additional zeta to just\nthe valence orbitals. Previous reports that all-electron approaches like HEAT\nlead to different CCSD(T) limits than valence limit+CV correction approaches\nlike FPD and W4 theory can be rationalized in terms of the greater radial\nflexibility of core-valence basis sets. W4-F12 is found to agree slightly\nbetter than W4 with ATcT (active thermochemical tables) data, at a substantial\nsaving in CPU time and especially I/O overhead. A W4-F12 calculation on benzene\nis presented as a proof of concept.\n", "  I show that a recently discovered star cluster near the center of the\nultra-faint dwarf galaxy Eridanus II provides strong constraints on massive\ncompact halo objects (MACHOs) of >~5 M_sun as the main component of dark\nmatter. MACHO dark matter will dynamically heat the cluster, driving it to\nlarger sizes and higher velocity dispersions until it dissolves into its host\ngalaxy. The stars in compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies themselves will be\nsubject to the same dynamical heating; the survival of at least ten such\ngalaxies places independent limits on MACHO dark matter of masses >~10 M_sun.\nBoth Eri II's cluster and the compact ultra-faint dwarfs are characterized by\nstellar masses of just a few thousand M_sun and half-light radii of 13 pc (for\nthe cluster) and ~30 pc (for the ultra-faint dwarfs). These systems close the\n~20--100 M_sun window of allowed MACHO dark matter and combine with existing\nconstraints from microlensing, wide binaries, and disk kinematics to rule out\ndark matter composed entirely of MACHOs from ~10$^{-7}$ M_sun up to arbitrarily\nhigh masses.\n", "  We report experimental results on nonlinear wave coupling in surface wave\nturbulence on water at scales close to the crossover between surface gravity\nwaves and capillary waves. We study 3-wave correlations either in the frequency\ndomain or in wavevector domain. We observe that in a weakly nonlinear regime,\nthe dominant nonlinear interactions correspond to waves that are collinear or\nclose to collinear. Although the resonant coupling of pure gravity waves is\nsupposed to involve 4 waves, at the capillary crossover we observe a nonlocal\ncoupling between a gravity wave and 2 capillary waves. Furthermore nonlinear\nspectral spreading permits 3-gravity wave coupling. These observations raise\nthe question of the relevance of these processes in the oceanographic context\nand in particular the range of frequencies of gravity waves that may be\nimpacted.\n", "  We explore the question of the rapid buildup of black hole mass in the early\nuniverse employing a growing black hole mass-based determination of both jet\nand disk powers predicted in recent theoretical work on black hole accretion\nand jet formation. Despite simplified, even artificial assumptions about\naccretion and mergers, we identify an interesting low probability channel for\nthe growth of one billion solar mass black holes within hundreds of millions of\nyears of the Big Bang without appealing to super Eddington accretion. This\nresult is made more compelling by the recognition of a connection between this\nchannel and an end product involving active galaxies with FRI radio morphology\nbut weaker jet powers in mildly sub-Eddington accretion regimes. While FRI\nquasars have already been shown to occupy a small region of the available\nparameter space for black hole feedback in the paradigm, we further suggest\nthat the observational dearth of FRI quasars is also related to their\nconnection to the most massive black hole growth due to both these FRIs high\nredshifts and relative weakness. Our results also allow us to construct the AGN\nluminosity function at high redshift, that agree with recent studies. In short,\nwe produce a connection between the unexplained paucity of a given family of\nactive galactic nuclei and the rapid growth of supermassive black holes, two\nheretofore seemingly unrelated aspects of the physics of active galactic\nnuclei.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall (QSH) materials are two-dimensional systems exhibiting\ninsulating bulk and helical edge states simultaneously. A QSH insulator\nprocesses topologically non-trivial edge states protected by time-reversal\nsymmetry, so that electrons can propagate unscattered. Realization of such\ntopological phases enables promising applications in spintronics,\ndissipationless transport and quantum computations. Presently, realization of\nsuch QSH-based devices are limited to complicated heterostructures. Monolayer\n1T'-WTe2 was predicted to be semimetallic QSH materials, though with a negative\nband gap. The quasi-particle spectrum obtained using hybrid functional approach\nshows directly that the quantum spin Hall gap is positive for monolayer\n1T'-WTe2. Optical measurement shows a systematic increase in the interband\nrelaxation time with decreasing number of layers, whereas transport measurement\nreveals Schottcky barrier in ultrathin samples, which is absent for thicker\nsamples. These three independent pieces of evidence indicate that monolayer\n1T'-WTe2 is likely a truly 2-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator.\n", "  We study differential equations for Feynman amplitudes and we show that the\ncorresponding D-module is isomorphic to a GKZ D-modules. We show that the sheaf\nof solutions to the D-module is isomorphic to a certain relative homology and\nthe amplitudes are periods of a relative motive. Using these ideas, we develop\na method of regularization which specializes to dimensional regularization and\nanalytic regularization.\n", "  We investigate how textual properties of scientific papers relate to the\nnumber of citations they receive. Our main finding is that correlations are\nnon-linear and affect differently most-cited and typical papers. For instance,\nwe find that in most journals short titles correlate positively with citations\nonly for the most cited papers, for typical papers the correlation is in most\ncases negative. Our analysis of 6 different factors, calculated both at the\ntitle and abstract level of 4.3 million papers in over 1500 journals, reveals\nthe number of authors, and the length and complexity of the abstract, as having\nthe strongest (positive) influence on the number of citations.\n", "  Electrons in image-potential states on the surface of bulk helium represent a\nunique model system of a two-dimensional electron gas. Here, we investigate\ntheir properties in the extreme case of reduced film thickness: a monolayer of\nhelium physisorbed on a single-crystalline (111)-oriented Cu surface. For this\npurpose we have utilized a customized setup for time-resolved two-photon\nphotoemission (2PPE) at very low temperatures under ultra-high vacuum\nconditions. We demonstrate that the highly polarizable metal substrate\nincreases the binding energy of the first (n = 1) image-potential state by more\nthan two orders of magnitude as compared to the surface of liquid helium. An\nelectron in this state is still strongly decoupled from the metal surface due\nto the large negative electron affinity of helium and we find that even one\nmonolayer of helium increases its lifetime by one order of magnitude compared\nto the bare Cu(111) surface.\n", "  The scattering cancellation technique is a powerful tool to reduce the\nscattered field from electrically small objects in a specific frequency window.\nThe technique relies on covering the object of interest with a shell that\nscatters light into the far field of equal strength as the object, but $\\pi$\nout-of-phase. The resulting destructive interference prohibits its detection in\nmeasurements that probe the scattered light. Whereas at radio or microwave\nfrequencies feasible designs have been proposed that allow to tune the\noperational frequency upon request, similar capabilities have not yet been\nexplored in the visible. However, such ability is decisive to capitalize on the\ntechnique in many envisioned applications. Here, we solve the problem and study\nthe use of small metallic nanoparticles with an ellipsoidal shape as the\nmaterial from which the shell is made to build an isotropic geometry. Changing\nthe aspect ratio of the ellipsoids allows to change the operational frequency.\nThe basic functionality is explored with two complementary analytical\napproaches. Additionally, we present a powerful multiscattering algorithm that\ncan be used to perform full wave simulations of clusters of arbitrary\nparticles. We utilize this method to analyze the scattering of the presented\ndesigns numerically. Hereby we provide useful guidelines for the fabrication of\nthis cloak with self-assembly methods by investigating the effects of disorder.\n", "  The modern picture of the neutrino as a multiple mass highly mixed neutral\nparticle has emerged over 40 years of study. Best known of the issues leading\nto this picture was the apparent loss of neutrinos coming from the sun. This\narticle describes another piece of evidence that supports the picture; the\nsubstantial reduction of high energy muon type neutrinos observed in nature.\nFor much of the 40 year period, before the modern picture emerged this\nobservation was known as the \"atmospheric neutrino anomaly\", since as will be\nseen, these neutrinos originate in the Earth's atmosphere.\n  This paper describes the discovery of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. We\nexplore the scientific context and motivations in the late 1970's from which\nthis work emerged. The gradual awareness that the observations of atmospheric\nneutrinos were not as expected took place in the 1983-1986 period.\n", "  This paper investigates the potential to detect tau neutrinos in the energy\nrange of 1-1000 PeV searching for very inclined showers with imaging Cherenkov\ntelescopes. A neutrino induced tau lepton escaping from the Earth may decay and\ninitiate an air shower which can be detected by a fluorescence or Cherenkov\ntelescope. We present here a study of the detection potential of Earth-skimming\nneutrinos taking into account neutrino interactions in the Earth crust, local\nmatter distributions at various detector sites, the development of tau-induced\nshowers in air and the detection of Cherenkov photons with IACTs. We analyzed\nsimulated shower images on the camera focal plane and implemented generic\nreconstruction chains based on Hillas parameters. We find that present IACTs\ncan distinguish air showers induced by tau neutrinos from the background of\nhadronic showers in the PeV-EeV energy range. We present the neutrino trigger\nefficiency obtained for a few configurations being considered for the\nnext-generation Cherenkov telescopes, i.e. the Cherenkov Telescope Array.\nFinally, for a few representative neutrino spectra expected from astrophysical\nsources, we compare the expected event rates at running IACTs to what is\nexpected for the dedicated IceCube neutrino telescope.\n", "  We derive a surprising correspondence between SLE$_{\\kappa}(\\rho)$ processes\nand light cones of the Gaussian free field (GFF).\n  Recall that (one-sided, chordal, origin-seeded) SLE$_\\kappa(\\rho)$ processes\nare in some sense the simplest and most natural variants of the Schramm-Loewner\nevolution. They were originally defined only for $\\rho > -2$, but one can use\nL\\'evy compensation to extend the definition to any $\\rho >\n-2-\\tfrac{\\kappa}{2}$ and to obtain qualitatively different curves. The\ntriangle $T = \\{(\\kappa, \\rho): (-2-\\tfrac{\\kappa}{2})\\vee\n(\\tfrac{\\kappa}{2}-4) < \\rho < -2 \\}$ is the primary focus of this paper. When\n$(\\kappa, \\rho) \\in T$, the SLE$_\\kappa(\\rho)$ curves are highly non-simple\n(and double points are dense) even though $\\kappa < 4$.\n  Let $h$ be an instance of the GFF. Fix $\\kappa\\in (0,4)$ and $\\chi =\n2/\\sqrt{\\kappa} - \\sqrt{\\kappa}/2$. Recall that an imaginary geometry ray is a\nflow line of $e^{i(h/\\chi +\\theta)}$ that looks locally like SLE$_\\kappa$. The\nlight cone with parameter $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ is the set of points reachable\nfrom the origin by a sequence of rays with angles in $[-\\theta/2, \\theta/2]$.\nWhen $\\theta=0$, the light cone looks like SLE$_\\kappa$, and when $\\theta =\n\\pi$ it looks like the range of an SLE$_{16/\\kappa}$. We find that when $\\theta\n\\in (0, \\pi)$ the light cones are either fractal carpets with a dense set of\nholes or space-filling regions with no holes.\n  We show that every non-space-filling light cone (with $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi]$\nand $\\kappa \\in (0,4)$) agrees in law with the range of an SLE$_\\kappa(\\rho)$\nprocess with $(\\kappa, \\rho) \\in T$. Conversely, the range of any\nSLE$_\\kappa(\\rho)$ with $(\\kappa,\\rho) \\in T$ agrees in law with a\nnon-space-filling light cone. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof that\nthese SLE$_\\kappa(\\rho)$ processes are continuous and show that they are\nnatural path-valued functions of the GFF.\n", "  Interstellar dust grains do not have a single well-defined origin. Stars are\ndemonstrably dust producers, but also efficient destroyers of cosmic dust. Dust\ndestruction in the ISM is believed to be the result of SN shocks hitting the\nambient ISM gas (and dust) and lead to an increased rate of ion sputtering,\nwhich reduces the dust mass. Grains located in cold molecular clouds can on the\nother hand grow by condensation, thus providing a replenishment mechanism or\neven a dominant channel of dust formation. In dense environments grains may\ncoagulate and form large composite grains and aggregates and if grains collide\nwith large enough energies they may be shattered, forming a range of smaller\ndebris grains. The present paper presents a statistical modelling approach\nusing the method of moments, which is computationally very inexpensive and may\ntherefore be an attractive option when combining dust processing with, e.g.,\ndetailed simulations of interstellar gas dynamics. A solar-neighbourhood-like\ntoy model of interstellar dust evolution is presented as an example.\n", "  It is commonly believed that grand unified theories (GUTs) predict proton\ndecay. This is because the exchange of extra GUT gauge bosons gives rise to\ndimension 6 proton decay operators. We show that there exists a class of GUTs\nin which these operators are absent. Many string and supergravity models in the\nliterature belong to this class.\n", "  We consider a compact Riemann surface with a holomorphic involution, two\nmarked fixed points of the involution and a divisor obeying an equation up to\nlinear equivalence of divisors involving all this data. Examples of such data\nare Fermi curves of 2-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators. We show\nthat the equation has a solution if and only if the two marked points are the\nonly fixed points of the involution.\n", "  The Hall effect is a powerful tool for investigating carrier type and\ndensity. For single-band materials, the Hall coefficient is traditionally\nexpressed simply by $R_H^{-1} = -en$, where $e$ is the charge of the carrier,\nand $n$ is the concentration. However, it is well known that in the critical\nregion near a quantum phase transition, as it was demonstrated for cuprates and\nheavy fermions, the Hall coefficient exhibits strong temperature and doping\ndependencies, which can not be described by such a simple expression, and the\ninterpretation of the Hall coefficient for Fe-based superconductors is also\nproblematic. Here, we investigate thin films of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$\nwith compressive and tensile in-plane strain in a wide range of Co doping. Such\nin-plane strain changes the band structure of the compounds, resulting in\nvarious shifts of the whole phase diagram as a function of Co doping. We show\nthat the resultant phase diagrams for different strain states can be mapped\nonto a single phase diagram with the Hall number. This universal plot is\nattributed to the critical fluctuations in multiband systems near the\nantiferromagnetic transition, which may suggest a direct link between magnetic\nand superconducting properties in the BaFe$_2$As$_2$ system.\n", "  The Darboux-Halphen system of equations have common or individual additive\nterms depending on the matrices defining Yang-Mills gauge potential fields. Tod\n(Phys. Lett. A 190 (1994) 221-224), described a conserved quantity for the\nclassical systems with no additive terms. We show that the conserved quantity\napply even for the generalized cases with common additive terms. A theory has\nbeen presented, with an example, of how to formulate conserved quantities for\nequation with individual additive terms. We also briefly shed some light on the\nissues of surface motions of fluids in conncetion to Nahm`s equation and the\nself-duality and integrability of membrane dynamics.\n", "  Channel length scaling in graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) is key in\nthe pursuit of higher performance in radio frequency electronics for both rigid\nand flexible substrates. Although two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a\nsuperior immunity to Short Channel Effects (SCEs) than bulk materials, they\ncould dominate in scaled GFETs. In this work, we have developed a model that\ncalculates electron and hole transport along the graphene channel in a\ndrift-diffusion basis, while considering the 2D electrostatics. Our model\nobtains the self-consistent solution of the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to\nthe current continuity equation, the latter embedding an appropriate model for\ndrift velocity saturation. We have studied the role played by the\nelectrostatics and the velocity saturation in GFETs with short channel lengths\nL. Severe scaling results in a high degradation of GFET output conductance. The\nextrinsic cutoff frequency follows a 1/L^n scaling trend, where the index n\nfulfills n < 2. The case n = 2 corresponds to long-channel GFETs with low\nsource/drain series resistance, that is, devices where the channel resistance\nis controlling the drain current. For high series resistance, n decreases down\nto n= 1, and it degrades to values of n < 1 because of the SCEs, especially at\nhigh drain bias. The model predicts high maximum oscillation frequencies above\n1 THz for channel lengths below 100 nm, but, in order to obtain these\nfrequencies, it is very important to minimize the gate series resistance. The\nmodel shows very good agreement with experimental current voltage curves\nobtained from short channel GFETs and also reproduces negative differential\nresistance, which is due to a reduction of diffusion current.\n", "  We generalize a binary majority-vote model on adaptive networks to a\nplurality-vote counterpart. When opinions are uniformly distributed in the\npopulation of voters in the initial state, it is found that having more\navailable opinions in the initial state actually accelerate the time to\nconsensus. In particular, we investigate the three-state plurality-vote model.\nWhile time to consensus in two state model scales exponentially with population\nsize $N$, for finite-size system, there is a non-zero probability that either\nthe population reaches the consensus state in a time that is very short and\nindependent of $N$ (in the heterophily regime), or in a time that scales\nexponentially with $N$ but is still much faster than two-state model.\n", "  Minimal mutual coherence of discrete noiselets and Haar wavelets makes this\npair of bases an essential choice for the measurement and compression matrices\nin compressed-sensing-based single-pixel detectors. In this paper we propose an\nefficient way of using complex-valued and non-binary noiselet functions for\nobject sampling in single-pixel cameras with binary spatial light modulators\nand incoherent illumination. The proposed method allows to determine m complex\nnoiselet coefficients from m+1 binary sampling measurements. Further, we\nintroduce a modification to the complex fast noiselet transform, which enables\ncomputationally-efficient real-time generation of the binary noiselet-based\npatterns using efficient integer calculations on bundled patterns. The proposed\nmethod is verified experimentally with a single-pixel camera system using a\nbinary spatial light modulator.\n", "  We report on an atomic-scale X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy study on\nFe-rich FeAl in the B2-ordered regime revealing effective <111>-exchanges of\natoms on the Al-sublattice. The diffusion mechanism responsible for these\nexchanges is the dominating process for chemical diffusion and therefore\ncontrols long-range material transport in the system. Comparison with previous\natomistic results shows that the dominance of further exchanges can be\ncharacteristic at moderate temperatures where the system is highly ordered.\n", "  We attracted attention to some peculiarities of positron production for\nlinear collider (ILC). The conversion system with many targets and low K-factor\nis our primary interest.\n", "  This article discusses the main achievements and future perspectives of the\nMAGNEX spectrometer at the INFN-LNS laboratory in Catania (Italy). MAGNEX is a\nlarge acceptance magnetic spectrometer for the detection of the ions emitted in\nnuclear collisions below Fermi energy. In the first part of the paper an\noverview of the MAGNEX features is presented. The successful application to the\nprecise reconstruction of the momentum vector, to the identification of the ion\nmasses and to the determination of the transport efficiency is demonstrated by\nin-beam tests. In the second part, an overview of the most relevant scientific\nachievements is given. Results from nuclear elastic and inelastic scattering as\nwell as from transfer and charge exchange reactions in a wide range of masses\nof the colliding systems and incident energies are shown. The role of MAGNEX in\nsolving old and new puzzles in nuclear structure and direct reaction mechanisms\nis emphasized. One example is the recently observed signature of the long\nsearched Giant Pairing Vibration. Finally, the new challenging opportunities to\nuse MAGNEX for future experiments are briefly reported. In particular, the use\nof double charge exchange reactions toward the determination of the nuclear\nmatrix elements entering in the expression of the half-life of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay is discussed. The new NUMEN project of INFN, aiming at these\ninvestigations, is introduced. The challenges connected to the major technical\nupgrade required by the project in order to investigate rare processes under\nhigh fluxes of detected heavy ions are outlined.\n", "  Our current understanding of the curved space-time around supermassive black\nholes is based on actively accreting black holes, which make up only ten per\ncent or less of the overall population. X-ray observations of that small\nfraction reveal strong gravitational redshifts that indicate that many of these\nblack holes are rapidly rotating; however, selection biases suggest that these\nresults are not necessarily reflective of the majority of black holes in the\nUniverse. Tidal disruption events, where a star orbiting an otherwise dormant\nblack hole gets tidally shredded and accreted onto the black hole, can provide\na short, unbiased glimpse at the space-time around the other ninety per cent of\nblack holes. Observations of tidal disruptions have hitherto revealed the\nformation of an accretion disk and the onset of an accretion-powered jet, but\nhave failed to reveal emission from the inner accretion flow, which enables the\nmeasurement of black hole spin. Here we report observations of reverberation\narising from gravitationally redshifted iron K photons reflected off the inner\naccretion flow in the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. From the\nreverberation timescale, we estimate the mass of the black hole to be a few\nmillion solar masses, suggesting an accretion rate of 100 times the Eddington\nlimit or more. The detection of reverberation from the relativistic depths of\nthis rare super-Eddington event demonstrates that the X-rays do not arise from\nthe relativistically moving regions of a jet, as previously thought.\n", "  The correlation between radio spectral index and redshift has been exploited\nto discover high redshift radio galaxies, but its underlying cause is unclear.\nIt is crucial to characterise the particle acceleration and loss mechanisms in\nhigh redshift radio galaxies to understand why their radio spectral indices are\nsteeper than their local counterparts. Low frequency information on scales of\n$\\sim$1 arcsec are necessary to determine the internal spectral index\nvariation. In this paper we present the first spatially resolved studies at\nfrequencies below 100 MHz of the $z = 2.4$ radio galaxy 4C 43.15 which was\nselected based on its ultra-steep spectral index ($\\alpha < -1$; $S_{\\nu} \\sim\n\\nu^{\\alpha}$ ) between 365 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Using the International Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR) Low Band Antenna we achieve sub-arcsecond imaging\nresolution at 55 MHz with VLBI techniques. Our study reveals low-frequency\nradio emission extended along the jet axis, which connects the two lobes. The\nintegrated spectral index for frequencies $<$ 500 MHz is -0.83. The lobes have\nintegrated spectral indices of -1.31$\\pm$0.03 and -1.75$\\pm$0.01 for\nfrequencies $\\geq$1.4 GHz, implying a break frequency between 500 MHz and 1.4\nGHz. These spectral properties are similar to those of local radio galaxies. We\nconclude that the initially measured ultra-steep spectral index is due to a\ncombination of the steepening spectrum at high frequencies with a break at\nintermediate frequencies.\n", "  We address the ballistic transmission of charge carriers across ordered line\ndefects in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our study reveals the\npresence of a transport gap driven by spin-orbit interactions, spin and valley\nfiltering, both stemming from a simple picture of spin and momentum\nconservation, as well as the electron-hole asymmetry of charge-carrier\ntransmission. Electronic transport properties of experimentally observed\nordered line defects in monolayer MoS$_2$, in particular, the vacancy lines and\ninversion domain boundaries, are further investigated using first-principles\nGreen's function methodology. Our calculations demonstrate the possibility of\nachieving nearly complete spin polarization of charge carriers in\nnanoelectronic devices based on engineered periodic line defects in monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, thus suggesting a practical scheme for\nall-electric control of spin transport.\n", "  Band inversion, one of the key signatures of time-reversal invariant\ntopological insulators (TIs), arises mostly due to the spin-orbit (SO)\ncoupling. Here, based on ab initio density-functional calculations, we report a\ntheoretical investigation of the SO-driven band inversion in isostructural\nbismuth and antimony chalcogenide TIs from the viewpoint of its interplay with\nthe crystal-field effect. We calculate the SO-induced energy shift of states in\nthe top valence and bottom conduction manifolds and reproduce this behavior\nusing a simple one-atom model adjusted to incorporate the crystal-field effect.\nThe crystal-field splitting is shown to compete with the SO coupling, that is,\nstronger crystal-field splitting leads to weaker SO band shift. We further show\nhow both these effects can be controlled by changing the chemical composition,\nwhereas the crystal-field splitting can be tuned by means of uniaxial strain.\nThese results provide a practical guidance to the rational design of novel TIs\nas well as to controlling the properties of existing materials.\n", "  We performed a series of direct N-body simulations with the aim to follow the\ndynamical evolution of a galaxy cluster (GC) ($M_{clus}\\simeq 10^{14}\nM_{\\odot}$) in different environment. The results show the formation of heavy\nsub-structures in the cluster centre in consequence of multiple merging among\nthe innermost galaxies. Moreover we investigate the dynamics of super-massive\nblack holes (SMBHs) residing in the centre of galaxies that form the most\nmassive sub-structure.\n", "  Urban traffic analysis is crucial for traffic forecasting systems, urban\nplanning and, more recently, various mobile and network applications. In this\npaper, we analyse urban traffic with network and statistical methods. Our\nanalysis is based on one big bus dataset containing 45 million bus arrival\nsamples in Helsinki. We mainly address following questions: 1. How can we\nidentify the areas that cause most of the traffic in the city? 2. Why there is\na urban traffic? Is bus traffic a key cause of the urban traffic? 3. How can we\nimprove the urban traffic systems? To answer these questions, first, the\nbetweenness is used to identify the most import areas that cause most traffics.\nSecond, we find that bus traffic is not an important cause of urban traffic\nusing statistical methods. We differentiate the urban traffic and the bus\ntraffic in a city. We use bus delay as an identification of the urban traffic,\nand the number of bus as an identification of the bus traffic. Third, we give\nour solutions on how to improve urban traffic by the traffic simulation on road\nnetworks. We show that adding more buses during the peak time and providing\nbetter bus schedule plan in the hot areas like railway station, metro station,\nshopping malls etc. will reduce the urban traffic.\n", "  Background: Measurements of $\\beta$ decay provide important nuclear structure\ninformation that can be used to probe isospin asymmetries and inform nuclear\nastrophysics studies. Purpose: To measure the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ decay of\n$^{26}$P and compare the results with previous experimental results and\nshell-model calculations. Method: A $^{26}$P fast beam produced using nuclear\nfragmentation was implanted into a planar germanium detector. Its\n$\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-ray emission was measured with an array of 16\nhigh-purity germanium detectors. Positrons emitted in the decay were detected\nin coincidence to reduce the background. Results: The absolute intensities of\n$^{26}$P $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-rays were determined. A total of six new\n$\\beta$-decay branches and 15 new $\\gamma$-ray lines have been observed for the\nfirst time in $^{26}$P $\\beta$-decay. A complete $\\beta$-decay scheme was built\nfor the allowed transitions to bound excited states of $^{26}$Si. $ft$ values\nand Gamow-Teller strengths were also determined for these transitions and\ncompared with shell model calculations and the mirror $\\beta$-decay of\n$^{26}$Na, revealing significant mirror asymmetries. Conclusions: A very good\nagreement with theoretical predictions based on the USDB shell model is\nobserved. The significant mirror asymmetry observed for the transition to the\nfirst excited state ($\\delta=51(10)\\%$) may be evidence for a proton halo in\n$^{26}$P.\n", "  The neutron, in addition to possibly having a permanent electric dipole\nmoment as a consequence of violation of time-reversal invariance, develops an\ninduced electric dipole moment in the presence of an external electric field.\nWe present here a unified non-relativistic description of these two phenomena,\nin which the dipole moment operator, $\\vec{\\cal D}$, is not constrained to lie\nalong the spin operator. Although the expectation value of $\\vec{\\cal D}$ in\nthe neutron is less than $10^{-13}$ of the neutron radius, $r_n$, the\nexpectation value of $\\vec {\\cal D}\\,^2$ is of order $r_n^2$. We determine the\nspin motion in external electric and magnetic fields, as employed in past and\nfuture searches for a permanent dipole moment, and show that the neutron\nelectric polarizability, although entering the neutron energy in an external\nelectric field, does not affect the spin motion. In a simple non-relativistic\nmodel we show that the expectation value of the permanent dipole is, to lowest\norder, proportional to the product of the time reversal-violating coupling\nstrength and the electric polarizability of the neutron.\n", "  We introduce the concept of black shell, consisting on a massive thin\nspherical shell contracting toward its gravitational radius from the point of\nview of an external observer far from the shell, in order to effectively model\nthe gravitational collapse. Considering complementary description of\nentanglement entropy of a black shell and according to Gibbons-Hawking\nEuclidean approach, we calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy retrieving\nhorizon integral and discarding boundary at infinity.\n", "  Recently, a novel three-dimensional entangled state called tree-type\nentanglement, which is likely to have applications for improving quantum\ncommunication security, was prepared via adiabatic passage by Song et al.\n[Phys. Rev. A 93, 062321 (2016)]. Here we propose two schemes for fast\ngenerations of tree-type three-dimensional entanglement among three spatially\nseparated atoms via shortcuts to adiabatic passage. With the help of quantum\nZeno dynamics, two kinds of different but equivalent methods, Lewis-Riesenfeld\ninvariants and transitionless quantum driving, are applied to construct\nshortcuts to adiabatic passage. The comparisons between the two methods are\ndiscussed. The strict numerical simulations show that the tree-type\nthree-dimensional entangled states can be fast prepared with quite high\nfidelities and the two schemes are both robust against the variations in the\nparameters, atomic spontaneous emissions and the cavity-fiber photon leakages.\n", "  When considering a sequent-style proof system for quantum programs, there are\ncertain elements of quantum mechanics that we may wish to capture, such as\nphase, dynamics of unitary transformations, and measurement probabilities.\nTraditional quantum logics which focus primarily on the abstract orthomodular\nlattice theory and structures of Hilbert spaces have not satisfactorily\ncaptured some of these elements. We can start from 'scratch' in an attempt to\nconceptually characterize the types of proof rules which should be in a system\nthat represents elements necessary for quantum algorithms. This present work\nattempts to do this from the perspective of the quantum circuit model of\nquantum computation. A sequent calculus based on single quantum circuits is\nsuggested, and its ability to incorporate important conceptual and dynamic\naspects of quantum computing is discussed. In particular, preserving the\nrepresentation of phase helps illustrate the role of interference as a resource\nin quantum computation. Interference also provides an intuitive basis for a\nnon-monotonic calculus.\n", "  I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state\nspace) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches\ntraditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. The quantum\nannealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical\nnumerical technique which is now obsolete. Hence, I explore strategies to use\nan annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization\nalgorithms, and additionally should be less sensitive to problem\nmis-specification then the traditional quantum annealing algorithm.\n", "  What kind of object is a quantum state? Is it an object that encodes an\nexponentially growing amount of information (in the size of the system) or more\nakin to a probability distribution? It turns out that these questions are\nsensitive to what we do with the information. For example, Holevo's bound tells\nus that n qubits only encode n bits of classical information but for certain\ncommunication complexity tasks there is an exponential separation between\nquantum and classical resources. Instead of just contrasting quantum and\nclassical physics, we can place both within a broad landscape of physical\ntheories and ask how non-quantum (and non-classical) theories are different\nfrom, or more powerful than quantum theory. For example, in communication\ncomplexity, certain (non-quantum) theories can trivialise all communication\ncomplexity tasks. In recent work [C. M. Lee and M. J. Hoban, Proc. Royal Soc. A\n472 (2190), 2016], we showed that the immense power of the information content\nof states in general (non-quantum) physical theories is not limited to\ncommunication complexity. We showed that, in general physical theories, states\ncan be taken as \"advice\" for computers in these theories and this advice allows\nthe computers to easily solve any decision problem. Aaronson has highlighted\nthe close connection between quantum communication complexity and quantum\ncomputations that take quantum advice, and our work gives further indications\nthat this is a very general connection. In this work, we review the results in\nour previous work and discuss the intricate relationship between communication\ncomplexity and computers taking advice for general theories.\n", "  Realist, no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as Everett's,\nface the probability problem: how to justify the norm-squared (Born) rule from\nthe wavefunction alone. While any basis-independent measure can only be\nnorm-squared (due to the Gleason-Busch Theorem) this fact conflicts with\nvarious popular, non-wavefunction-based phenomenological measures - such as\nobserver, outcome or world counting - that are frequently demanded of\nEverettians. These alternatives conflict, however, with the wavefunction\nrealism upon which Everett's approach rests, which seems to call for an\nobjective, basis-independent measure based only on wavefunction amplitudes. The\nability of quantum probabilities to destructively interfere with each other,\nhowever, makes it difficult to see how probabilities can be derived solely from\namplitudes in an intuitively appealing way. I argue that the use of algorithmic\nprobability can solve this problem, since the objective, single-case\nprobability measure that wavefunction realism demands is exactly what\nalgorithmic information theory was designed to provide. The result is an\nintuitive account of complex-valued amplitudes, as coefficients in an optimal\nlossy data compression, such that changes in algorithmic information content\n(entropy deltas) are associated with phenomenal transitions.\n", "  Many high-energy physics analyses require the presence of leptons from $W$,\n$Z$, or $H$ boson decay. For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons\npresent a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude\nof this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it\ncan be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the\n`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and\n`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using\nthe populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the\nefficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy\nthe criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be\nestimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the\nmatrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of\nthe fake background yield compared to an analytic solution. This implementation\nalso provides a reliable estimate of the background for cases in which the\nanalysis selection permits more loose leptons than tight leptons, potentially\nallowing for greater selection efficiency.\n", "  The widespread use of nanodiamond as a biomedical platform for drug-delivery,\nimaging, and sub-cellular tracking applications stems from their non-toxicity\nand unique quantum mechanical properties. Here, we extend this functionality to\nthe domain of magnetic resonance, by demonstrating that the intrinsic electron\nspins on the nanodiamond surface can be used to hyperpolarize adsorbed liquid\ncompounds at room temperature. By combining relaxation measurements with\nhyperpolarization, spins on the surface of the nanodiamond can be distinguished\nfrom those in the bulk liquid. These results are likely of use in signaling the\ncontrolled release of pharmaceutical payloads.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the ultrafast terahertz(THz) properties of\nmonolayer graphene. The analytical formulations of the photon carrier, electric\npolarization and optical current are obtained by solving the Bloch-equations in\npresent of the ultrafast THz Gaussian pulse. Graphene shows a large nonlinear\nand ultrafast optical response at THz frequencies due to the gapless and\nrelativistic Dirac particles with nearly linear energy dispersion. It is found\nthat the photon carrier density, electric polarization and optical current\ndensity increase with increasing the frequency of the THz pulse. These\ntheoretical results are in agreement with recent experimental findings. This\nstudy confirms further that graphene exhibits important features and is\nrelevant to the applications in the ultrafast THz fields.\n", "  The Galactic centre (GC) is a unique place to study the extreme dynamical\nprocesses occurring near a super-massive black hole (SMBH). Here we simulate a\nlarge set of binaries orbiting the SMBH while the primary member undergoes a\nsupernova (SN) explosion, in order to study the impact of SN kicks on the\norbits of stars and dark remnants in the GC. We find that SN explosions are\nefficient in scattering neutron stars and other light stars on new (mostly\neccentric) orbits, while black holes (BHs) tend to retain memory of the orbit\nof their progenitor star. SN kicks are thus unable to eject BHs from the GC: a\ncusp of dark remnants may be lurking in the central parsec of our Galaxy.\n", "  The coexistence and coupling between magnetization and electric polarization\nin multiferroic materials provide extra degrees of freedom for creating\nnext-generation memory devices. A variety of concepts of multiferroic or\nmagnetoelectric memories have been proposed and explored in the past decade.\nHere we propose a new principle to realize a multilevel nonvolatile memory\nbased on the multiple states of the magnetoelectric coefficient ({\\alpha}) of\nmultiferroics. Because the states of {\\alpha} depends on the relative\norientation between magnetization and polarization, one can reach different\nlevels of {\\alpha} by controlling the ratio of up and down ferroelectric\ndomains with external electric fields. Our experiments in a device made of the\nPMN-PT/Terfenol-D multiferroic heterostructure confirm that the states of\n{\\alpha} can be well controlled between positive and negative by applying\nselective electric fields. Consequently, two-level, four-level, and eight-level\nnonvolatile memory devices are demonstrated at room temperature. This kind of\nmultilevel magnetoelectric memory retains all the advantages of ferroelectric\nrandom access memory but overcomes the drawback of destructive reading of\npolarization. In contrast, the reading of {\\alpha} is nondestructive and highly\nefficient in a parallel way, with an independent reading coil shared by all the\nmemory cells.\n", "  Several experiments observed deviations from the Standard Model (SM) in the\nflavour sector: LHCb found a $4-5\\,\\sigma$ discrepancy compared to the SM in\n$b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ transitions (recently supported by an Belle analysis) and\nCMS reported a non-zero measurement of $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ with a significance of\n$2.4\\,\\sigma$. Furthermore, BELLE, BABAR and LHCb founds hints for the\nviolation of flavour universality in $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$. In addition, there\nis the long-standing discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\nInterestingly, all these anomalies are related to muons and taus, while the\ncorresponding electron channels seem to be SM like. This suggests that these\ndeviations from the SM might be correlated and we briefly review some selected\nmodels providing simultaneous explanations.\n", "  We show how a superconducting region (S) sandwiched between two normal leads\n(N), in the presence of barriers, can act as a lens for propagating electron\nand hole waves by virtue of the so- called crossed Andreev reflection (CAR).\nThe CAR process which is equivalent to the Cooper pair splitting into the two N\nelectrodes provides a unique possibility of constructing entangled electrons in\nsolid state systems. When electrons are locally injected from an N lead, due to\nthe CAR and normal reflection of quasiparticles by the insulating barriers at\nthe interfaces, sequences of electron and hole focuses are established inside\nanother N electrode. This behavior originates from the change of momentum\nduring electron-hole conversion beside the successive normal reflections of\nelectrons and holes due to the barriers. The focusing phenomena studied here is\nfundamentally different from the electron focusing in other systems like\ngraphene pn junctions. In particular due to the electron-hole symmetry of\nsuperconducting state, the focusing of electrons and holes are robust against\nthermal excitations. Furthermore the effect of superconducting layer width, the\ninjection point position, and barriers strength is investigated on the focusing\nbehavior of the junction. Very intriguingly, it is shown that by varying the\nbarriers strength, one can separately control the density of electrons or holes\nat the focuses.\n", "  We numerically demonstrate self-similar propagation of parabolic optical\npulses through a highly nonlinear and passive specialty photonic bandgap fiber\nat 2.8 micron. In this context, we have proposed a scheme endowed with a\nrapidly varying, but of nearly-mean-zero longitudinal dispersion and modulated\nnonlinear profile in order to achieve self-similarity of the formed parabolic\npulse propagating over longer distances. To implement the proposed scheme, we\nhave designed a segmented bandgap fiber with suitably tapered counterparts to\nrealize such customized dispersion with chalchogenide glass materials. A\nself-similar parabolic pulse with full-width-at-half-maxima of 4.12 ps and\nenergy of ~ 39 pJ as been achieved at the output. Along with a linear chirp\nspanning over the entire pulse duration, 3dB spectral broadening of about 38 nm\nat the output has been reported.\n", "  We present the results of the application of locally linear embedding (LLE)\nto reduce the dimensionality of dereddened and continuum subtracted\nnear-infrared spectra using a combination of models and real spectra of massive\nprotostars selected from the Red MSX Source survey database. A brief comparison\nis also made with two other dimension reduction techniques; Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Isomap using the same set of spectra as well as a more\nadvanced form of LLE, Hessian locally linear embedding. We find that whilst LLE\ncertainly has its limitations, it significantly outperforms both PCA and Isomap\nin classification of spectra based on the presence/absence of emission lines\nand provides a valuable tool for classification and analysis of large spectral\ndata sets.\n", "  We propose a modified spin-wave theory to study the 1/3 magnetization plateau\nof the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. By the\nself-consistent inclusion of quantum corrections, the 1/3 plateau is stabilized\nover a broad range of magnetic fields for all spin quantum numbers, S. The\nvalues of the critical magnetic fields and the widths of the magnetization\nplateaus are fully consistent with recent numerical results from exact\ndiagonalization and infinite projected entangled paired states.\n", "  The stochastic addition of either vertices or connections in a network leads\nto the observation of the percolation transition, a structural change with the\nappearance of a connected component encompassing a finite fraction of the\nsystem. Percolation has always been regarded as a substrate-dependent but\nmodel-independent process, in the sense that the critical exponents of the\ntransition are determined by the geometry of the system, but they are identical\nfor the bond and site percolation models. Here, we report a violation of such\nassumption. We provide analytical and numerical evidence of a difference in the\nvalues of the critical exponents between the bond and site percolation models\nin networks with null percolation thresholds, such as scale-free graphs with\ndiverging second moment of the degree distribution. We discuss possible\nimplications of our results in real networks, and provide additional insights\non the anomalous nature of the percolation transition with null threshold.\n", "  There exist limits of self-inspection due to self-referential paradoxes,\nincompleteness and fixed point theorems. As quantum mechanics dictates the\nexchange of discrete quanta, measurements and self-inspection of quantized\nsystems are fundamentally limited.\n", "  Recent lattice QCD results suggest that the masses of the first two positive\nparity $B_s$ mesons lie below the BK threshold, similar to the case of\n$D^*_{s0}(2317)^+$ and $D_{s1}(2460)^+$ mesons. The mass spectrum of $B_s$\nmesons seems to follow pattern of $D_s$ mass spectrum. As in the case of\ncharmed mesons, the structure of positive parity $B_s$ mesons is very\nintriguing. To shed more light on this issue, we investigate strong isospin\nviolating decays $B_s(0^+) \\to B_s^0 \\pi^0$, $B_s(1^+) \\to B_s^{*0} \\pi^0$ and\n$B_s(1^+) \\to B_s^0 \\pi \\pi$ within heavy meson chiral perturbation theory. The\ntwo body decay amplitude arises at the tree level and we show that the loop\ncorrections give significant contributions. On the other hand, in the case of\nthree body decay $B_s(1^+) \\to B_s^0 \\pi \\pi$ amplitude occurs only at the loop\nlevel. We find that the decay widths for these decays are: $\\Gamma (B_s(1^+)\n\\to B_s^0 \\pi \\pi)\\sim 10^{-3}\\,$keV and $\\Gamma (B_s(0^+) \\to B_s^0 \\pi^0)\n\\leq 55\\,$keV, $\\Gamma (B_s(1^+) \\to B_s^{*0} \\pi^0) \\leq 50\\,$keV. More\nprecise knowledge of the coupling constant describing the interaction of\npositive and negative parity heavy mesons with light pseudoscalar mesons would\nhelp to increase accuracy of our calculation.\n", "  Optical circulators are indispensable components in photonic networks that\nare aimed to route information in a unidirectional way among their N-ports1,2.\nIn general, these devices rely on magneto-optical garnets3 with appreciable\nVerdet constants that are utilized in conjunction with other elements like\npermanent magnets, wave-plates, birefringent crystals and/or beam splitters.\nConsequently, these arrangements are typically bulky and hence not conducive to\non-chip photonic integration4-6. Of interest would be to devise strategies\nthrough which miniaturized optical circulators can be monolithically fabricated\non light-emitting semiconductor platforms by solely relying on physical\nproperties that are indigenous to the material itself. By exploiting the\ninterplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity, here we demonstrate a new\nclass of chip-scale circulators on spatially modified III-V quantum well\nsystems. These garnet-free unidirectional structures are broadband (over 2.5\nTHz) at 1550 nm, effectively loss-free, color-preserving, and in\nproof-of-principle demonstrations have provided 23 dB isolation when used under\npulsed-mode conditions at milliwatt (mW) power levels.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, transition metal dichalcogenides and\nblack phosphorus, have attracted much interest from the viewpoints of\nfundamental physics and device applications. The establishment of new\nfunctionalities in anisotropic layered 2D materials is a challenging but\nrewarding frontier, owing to their remarkable optical properties and prospects\nfor new devices. Here, we report the anisotropic optical properties of layered\n2D monochalcogenide of germanium sulfide (GeS). Three Raman scattering peaks\ncorresponding to the B3g, A1g, and A2g modes with strong polarization\ndependence are demonstrated in the GeS flakes, which validates polarized Raman\nspectroscopy as an effective method for identifying the crystal orientation of\nanisotropic layered GeS. Photoluminescence (PL) is observed with a peak at\naround 1.66 eV that originates from the direct optical transition in GeS at\nroom temperature. Moreover, determination of the polarization dependent\ncharacteristics of the PL and absorption reveals an anisotropic optical\ntransition near the band edge of GeS, which is also supported by the density\nfunctional theory calculations. This anisotropic layered GeS presents the\nopportunities for the discovery of new physical phenomena and will find\napplications that exploit its anisotropic properties.\n", "  In this short note we show through simple derivation the explicit relation\nbetween information flow and the theories of the emergence of space-time and\ngravity, specifically for Newton's second law of motion. Next, in a rather\nstraightforward derivation the Heisenberg uncertainty relation is uncovered\nfrom the universal bound on information flow. A relation between the universal\nbound on information flow and the change in bulk action is also shown to exist.\n", "  Recursive distinctioning (RD) is a name coined by Joel Isaacson in his\noriginal patent document describing how fundamental patterns of process arise\nfrom the systematic application of operations of distinction and description\nupon themselves. Recursive distinctioning means just what it says. A pattern of\ndistinctions is given in a space based on a graphical structure (such as a line\nof print or a planar lattice or given graph). Each node of the graph is\noccupied by a letter from some arbitrary alphabet. A specialized alphabet is\ngiven that can indicate distinctions about neighbors of a given node. The\nneighbors of a node are all nodes that are connected to the given node by edges\nin the graph. The letters in the specialized alphabet (call it SA) are used to\ndescribe the states of the letters in the given graph and at each stage in the\nrecursion, letters in SA are written at all nodes in the graph, describing its\nprevious state. The recursive structure that results from the iteration of\ndescriptions is called recursive distinctioning.\n", "  Classical and quantum field theory provide not only realistic examples of\nextant notions of empirical equivalence, but also new notions of empirical\nequivalence, both modal and occurrent. A simple but modern gravitational case\ngoes back to the 1890s, but there has been apparently total neglect of the\nsimplest relativistic analog, with the result that an erroneous claim has taken\nroot that Special Relativity could not have accommodated gravity even if there\nwere no bending of light. The fairly recent acceptance of nonzero neutrino\nmasses shows that widely neglected possibilities for nonzero particle masses\nhave sometimes been vindicated. In the electromagnetic case, there is permanent\nunderdetermination at the classical and quantum levels between Maxwell's theory\nand the one-parameter family of Proca's electromagnetisms with massive photons,\nwhich approximate Maxwell's theory in the limit of zero photon mass. While\nYang-Mills theories display similar approximate equivalence classically,\nquantization typically breaks this equivalence. A possible exception, including\nunified electroweak theory, might permit a mass term for the photons but not\nthe Yang-Mills vector bosons. Underdetermination between massive and massless\n(Einstein) gravity even at the classical level is subject to contemporary\ncontroversy.\n", "  Obtaining a stable magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) formalism in SPH - i.e.\nsmoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) - has proven remarkably\ndifficult. To implement MHD requires two steps: a modification to the momentum\nequation and an induction equation, and both present challenges. We first\nprovide an overview of how SPMHD is implemented, and then discuss how this\nimplementation fails and the limitation of various corrective methods - with\nparticular reference to the effects of particle disorder. Although there are\nmany problems for which, with careful choice of corrective measures, good\nresults can be obtained, we then show that, at the very limits of the state of\nthe art, the ability to perform stable MHD calculations in SPH is curtailed by\nnumerical issues.\n", "  In many semiconductors, compensating defects set doping limits, decrease\ncarrier mobility, and reduce minority carrier lifetime thus limiting their\nutility in devices. Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic\ndopants may also act as their own compensation when occupying an alternate\nlattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during\nprocessing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation\nenthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge.\nExcess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the\nformation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during\ncrystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations. Herein we\ndevelop a rigorous and general model for defect formation in the presence of\nsteady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard\nquasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable\nfor any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as\nchemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier\nconcentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating\ncenters, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the\nspecific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and\nextrinsically n-type doped GaSb. The model also predicts reductions in the\nconcentration of ionized scattering centers as well as increased mobility.\nWhile our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation\nin semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the\nconcept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition.\n", "  It is argued that cluster methods provide a viable alternative to Wilson's\nmomentum shell integration technique at the early stage of renormalization in\nthe field-theoretic models with strongly coupled fields because these methods\nallow for systematic accounting of all interactions in the system irrespective\nof their strength. These methods, however, are restricted to relatively small\nspatial scales, so they ought to be supplemented with more conventional\nrenormalization-group (RG) techniques to account for large scale correlations.\nTo fulfil this goal a \"layer-cake\" renormalization scheme earlier developed for\nrotationally symmetric Hamiltonians has been generalized to the lattice case.\nThe RG technique can be naturally integrated with an appropriately modified\ncluster method so that the RG equations were used only in the presence of large\nscale fluctuations, while in their absence the approach reduced to a\nconventional cluster method. As an illustrative example the simplest\nsingle-site cluster approximation together with the local-potential RG equation\nare applied to simple cubic Ising model to calculate several non-universal\nquantities such as the magnetization curve, the critical temperature, and some\ncritical amplitudes. Good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and series\nexpansion results was found.\n", "  We use micro-Raman spectroscopy to study strain profiles in graphene\nmonolayers suspended over SiN membranes micropatterned with holes of\nnon-circular geometry. We show that a uniform differential pressure load\n$\\Delta P$ over elliptical regions of free-standing graphene yields measurable\ndeviations from hydrostatic strain conventionally observed in\nradially-symmetric microbubbles. The top hydrostatic strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}$\nwe observe is estimated to be $\\approx0.7\\%$ for $\\Delta P = 1\\,{\\rm bar}$ in\ngraphene clamped to elliptical SiN holes with axis $40$ and $20\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$.\nIn the same configuration, we report a $G_\\pm$ splitting of $10\\,{\\rm cm^{-1}}$\nwhich is in good agreement with the calculated anisotropy $\\Delta\\varepsilon\n\\approx 0.6\\%$ for our device geometry. Our results are consistent with the\nmost recent reports on the Gr\\\"uneisen parameters. Perspectives for the\nachievement of arbitrary strain configurations by designing suitable SiN holes\nand boundary clamping conditions are discussed.\n", "  Many observed globular clusters (GCs) seem to show a central overabundance of\nmass whose nature has not yet fully understood. Indeed, it is not clear whether\nit is due to a central intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or to a massive\nstellar system (MSS) composed of mass segregated stars. In this contribution we\npresent a semi-analytic approach to the problem complemented by 12 $N$-body\nsimulations in which we followed the formation of MSSs in GCs with masses up to\n$3\\times 10^5$ \\Ms. Some implications for the formation of IMBHs and\ngravitational waves emission are discussed in perspective of a future work.\n", "  According to Munoz-Gutierrez et al. (2015) the orbit of comet 1P/Halley is\nchaotic with a surprisingly small Lyapunov time scale of order its orbital\nperiod. In this work we analyse the origin of chaos in Halley's orbit and the\ngrowth of perturbations, in order to get a better understanding of this\nunusually short time scale. We perform N-body simulations to model Halley's\norbit in the Solar System and measure the separation between neighbouring\ntrajectories. To be able to interpret the numerical results, we use a\nsemi-analytical map to demonstrate different growth modes, i.e. linear,\noscillatory or exponential, and transitions between these modes. We find the\nLyapunov time scale of Halley's orbit to be of order 300 years, which is\nsignificantly longer than previous estimates in the literature. This\ndiscrepancy could be due to the different methods used to measure the Lyapunov\ntime scale. A surprising result is that next to Jupiter, also encounters with\nVenus contribute to the exponential growth in the next 3000 years. Finally, we\nnote an interesting application of the sub-linear, oscillatory growth mode to\nan ensemble of bodies moving through the Solar System. Whereas in the absence\nof encounters with a third body the ensemble spreads out linearly in time, the\naccumulation of weak encounters can increase the lifetime of such systems due\nto the oscillatory behaviour.\n", "  SPHEREx is a proposed SMEX mission selected for Phase A. SPHEREx will carry\nout the first all-sky spectral survey and provide for every 6.2\" pixel a\nspectra between 0.75 and 4.18 $\\mu$m [with R$\\sim$41.4] and 4.18 and 5.00\n$\\mu$m [with R$\\sim$135]. The SPHEREx team has proposed three specific science\ninvestigations to be carried out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation,\ninterstellar and circumstellar ices, and the extra-galactic background light.\nIt is readily apparent, however, that many other questions in astrophysics and\nplanetary sciences could be addressed with the SPHEREx data. The SPHEREx team\nconvened a community workshop in February 2016, with the intent of enlisting\nthe aid of a larger group of scientists in defining these questions. This paper\nsummarizes the rich and varied menu of investigations that was laid out. It\nincludes studies of the composition of main belt and Trojan/Greek asteroids;\nmapping the zodiacal light with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution;\nidentifying and studying very low-metallicity stars; improving stellar\nparameters in order to better characterize transiting exoplanets; studying\naliphatic and aromatic carbon-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium;\nmapping star formation rates in nearby galaxies; determining the redshift of\nclusters of galaxies; identifying high redshift quasars over the full sky; and\nproviding a NIR spectrum for most eROSITA X-ray sources. All of these\ninvestigations, and others not listed here, can be carried out with the nominal\nall-sky spectra to be produced by SPHEREx. In addition, the workshop defined\nenhanced data products and user tools which would facilitate some of these\nscientific studies. Finally, the workshop noted the high degrees of synergy\nbetween SPHEREx and a number of other current or forthcoming programs,\nincluding JWST, WFIRST, Euclid, GAIA, K2/Kepler, TESS, eROSITA and LSST.\n", "  We present a new approach for the $f(R,T)$ formalism, by exploring the extra\nterms of its effective energy-momentum tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}^{eff}$, namely\n$\\tilde{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$. Those arise from the consideration of quantum effects,\nwhich are usually neglected in general relativity and $f(R)$ theories, and are\nsummed to the usual matter energy-momentum tensor, yielding\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}^{eff}=T_{\\mu\\nu}+\\tilde{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$. Purely from the Bianchi\nidentities, the conservation of both parts of the effective energy-momentum\ntensor is obtained, rather than the non-conservation of the matter one,\noriginally approached in the $f(R,T)$ theories. In this way, the intriguing\nscenario of matter-creation, which still lacks observational evidences, is\nevaded. One is left, then, with two sets of cosmological equations to be\nsolved: the Friedmann-like equations along with the conservation of\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}$ and along with the conservation of $\\tilde{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$. We\npresent a physical interpretation for the conservation of the extra terms of\nthe effective energy-momentum tensor, which is related to the presence of stiff\nmatter in the universe. The cosmological features of this approach are\npresented and discussed as well as the benefits of evading the matter\nenergy-momentum tensor non-conservation.\n", "  The properties of iron-based superconductors (Fe-SCs) can be varied\ndramatically with the introduction of dopants and atomic defects. As a pressing\nexample, FeSe, parent phase of the highest-$T_c$ Fe-SC, exhibits prevalent\ndefects with atomic-scale \"dumbbell\" signatures as imaged by scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM). These defects spoil superconductivity when their\nconcentration exceeds 2.5%. Resolving their chemical identity is prerequisite\nto applications such as nanoscale patterning of\nsuperconducting/nonsuperconducting regions in FeSe, as well as fundamental\nquestions such as the mechanism of superconductivity and the path by which the\ndefects destroy it. We use STM and density functional theory to characterize\nand identify the dumbbell defects. In contrast to previous speculations about\nSe adsorbates or substitutions, we find that an Fe-site vacancy is the most\nenergetically favorable defect in Se-rich conditions, and reproduces our\nobserved STM signature. Our calculations shed light more generally on the\nnature of Se capping, the removal of Fe vacancies via annealing, and their\nordering into a $\\sqrt{5}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{5}$ superstructure in FeSe and related\nalkali-doped compounds.\n", "  The diphoton excess around $m_S=750$ GeV observed at ATLAS and CMS can be\ninterpreted as coming from $S=H$ and $A$, the neutral components of a second\nHiggs doublet. If so, then the consistency of the light Higgs decays with the\nStandard Model predictions provides upper bounds on the rates of $S\\to VV, hZ,\nhh$ decays. On the other hand, if $h\\to\\tau\\mu$ decay is established, then a\nlower bound on the rate of $S\\to\\tau\\mu$ decay arises. Requiring that\n$\\Gamma_S\\lesssim45$ GeV gives both an upper and a lower bound on the rotation\nangle from the Higgs basis $(\\Phi_v,\\Phi_A)$ to the mass basis\n$(\\Phi_h,\\Phi_H)$. The charged scalar, with $m_{H^\\pm}\\simeq750$ GeV, is\nproduced in association with a top quark, and can decay to $\\mu^\\pm\\nu$,\n$\\tau^\\pm\\nu$, $tb$ and $W^\\pm h$\n", "  Companies have been increasingly seeking new mechanisms for making their\nelectronic marketing campaigns to become viral, thus obtaining a cascading\nrecommendation effect similar to word-of-mouth. We analysed a dataset of a\nmagazine publisher that uses email as the main marketing strategy and found out\nthat networks emerging from those campaigns form a very sparse graph. We show\nthat online social networks can be effectively used as a means to expand\nrecommendation networks. Starting from a set of users, called seeders, we\ncrawled Google's Orkut and collected about 20 million users and 80 million\nrelationships. Next, we extended the original recommendation network by adding\nnew edges using Orkut relationships that built a much denser network.\nTherefore, we advocate that online social networks are much more effective than\nemail-based marketing campaigns\n", "  We compare the prospects for observing theories with Majorana or Dirac\ngauginos at a future 100 TeV proton-proton collider. Calculating the expected\ndiscovery and exclusion regions, we find that for heavy gluino masses the\nsquark discovery reach is significantly reduced in Dirac gluino models relative\nto the Majorana case. However, if the squark and gluino masses are close the\nreach is similar in both scenarios. We also consider the electroweak fine\ntuning of theories observable at such a collider, and the impact of existing\nconstraints from flavour and CP violating observables. Models with Majorana\ngluinos that are fine tuned to less than one part in 10,000 can typically be\ndiscovered or excluded, and Dirac models with tuning of one part in 1,000 can\nbe probed. The flavour structure of Majorana models is highly constrained if\nthey have observable squarks, while O(1) violation is possible in accessible\nDirac models. In both cases new sources of CP violation must be very\nsuppressed. Future collider searches can also give important information on\npossible dark matter candidates. We study the relation of this to indirect and\ndirect detection searches, and find that if dark matter is a neutralino, a 100\nTeV collider could probe the viable dark matter candidates in large classes of\nboth Dirac and Majorana models.\n", "  {\\it NuSTAR} has detected pulsations from the ultraluminous X-ray source X-2\nin M82 and archival {\\it Chandra} observations have given us a good idea of its\nduty cycle. The newly discovered pulsar exhibited at least 4 super-Eddington\noutbursts in the past 15 years but, in its lowest-power state, it radiates just\nbelow the Eddington limit and its properties appear to be typical of high-mass\nX-ray binaries. M82 X-2 has been described as a common neutron star with a 1~TG\nmagnetic field that occasionally accretes above the Eddington rate and as a\nmagnetar-like pulsar with a 10-100~TG magnetic field that reaches above the\nquantum limit. We argue in favor of the former interpretation. Using standard\naccretion theory and the available observations, we calculate the stellar\nmagnetic field of this pulsar in two independent ways and we show that it\ncannot exceed 3~TG in either case. We discuss the implications of our results\nfor other ultraluminous X-ray sources that occasionally exhibit similar\npowerful outbursts.\n", "  This study was started to know mysterious classicality of nuclei.\n  This time, I found a new rule for decoherence. I used a model without chaos.\nAs a result, it was shown that not only the intersection of classical\ntrajectories but also branching of classical trajectories are needed for\ndecoherence. In other words, it was shown that interactions between a main\nsystem and environments have to make enough branchings of classical\ntrajectories of the main system for decoherence.\n", "  For many power-limited networks, such as wireless sensor networks and mobile\nad hoc networks, maximizing the network lifetime is the first concern in the\nrelated designing and maintaining activities. We study the network lifetime\nfrom the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are\nassigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the\ndelivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no,\nslow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by\nconsidering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is\ngenerally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic,\nthe less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet\ngeneration rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network\nlifetime and traffic congestion.\n", "  We study one-dimensional optical lattices described by generalized\nAubry-Andr\\'e models that include both commensurate and incommensurate\nmodulations of the hopping amplitude. This brings together two interesting\nfeatures of this class of systems: Anderson localization and the existence of\ntopological edge states. We follow changes of the single-particle energy\nspectrum induced by variations of the system parameters, with focus on the\nsurvival of topological states in the localized regime.\n", "  To study an alternative to BaF2, as the crystal choice for the Mu2e\ncalorimeter, thirteen pure CsI crystals from Opto Materials and ISMA producers\nhave been characterized by determining their light yield (LY) and longitudinal\nresponse uniformity (LRU), when read with a UV extended PMT. The crystals show\na LY of ~ 100 p.e./MeV (~ 150 p.e./MeV) when wrapped with Tyvek and coupled to\nthe PMT without (with) optical grease. The LRU is well represented by a linear\nslope that is on average around -0.6 %/cm. The timing performances of the Opto\nMaterials crystal, read with a UV extended MPPC, have been evaluated with\nminimum ionizing particles. A timing resolution of ~ 330 ps (~ 440 ps) is\nachieved when connecting the photosensor to the MPPC with (without) optical\ngrease. The crystal radiation hardness to a ionization dose has also been\nstudied for one pure CsI crystal from SICCAS. After exposing it to a dose of\n900 Gy, a decrease of 33% in the LY is observed while the LRU remains\nunchanged.\n", "  We consider a notion of relative homology (and cohomology) for surfaces with\ntwo types of boundaries. Using this tool, we study a generalization of Kitaev's\ncode based on surfaces with mixed boundaries. This construction includes both\nBravyi and Kitaev's and Freedman and Meyer's extension of Kitaev's toric code.\nWe argue that our generalization offers a denser storage of quantum\ninformation. In a planar architecture, we obtain a three-fold overhead\nreduction over the standard architecture consisting of a punctured square\nlattice.\n", "  It is shown that dynamical equations for quantum tomograms retain the\nnormalization conditions of their solutions during evolution only if the\nsolutions satisfy a set of special conditions. These conditions are found\nexplicitly. On the contrary, it is also shown that the classical Liouville\nequation, Moyal equation for Wigner function, and evolution equation for Husimi\nfunction retain normalization of any initially normalized and quickly decaying\nat infinity functions on the phase space. Other necessary and sufficient\nconditions for optical and symplectic tomogram-like functions to be tomograms\nof physical states are discussed.\n", "  We present a new instrument, the \"Stellar Double Coronagraph\" (SDC), a\nflexible coronagraphic platform. Designed for Palomar Observatory's 200\" Hale\ntelescope, its two focal and pupil planes allow for a number of different\nobserving configurations, including multiple vortex coronagraphs in series for\nimproved contrast at small angles. We describe the motivation, design,\nobserving modes, wavefront control approaches, data reduction pipeline, and\nearly science results. We also discuss future directions for the instrument.\n", "  We introduce a new generic Archetype technique for source classification and\nidentification, based on the NP-complete set cover problem (SCP) in computer\nscience and operations research (OR). We have developed a new heuristic SCP\nsolver, by combining the greedy algorithm and the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR)\napproximation method. We test the performance of our code on the test cases\nfrom Beasley's OR Library and show that our SCP solver can efficiently yield\nsolutions that are on average 99% optimal in terms of the cost. We discuss how\nto adopt SCP for classification purposes and put forward a new Archetype\ntechnique. We use an optical spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic sources\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as an example to illustrate the steps\nof the technique. We show how the technique naturally selects a basis set of\nphysically-motivated archetypal systems to represent all the extragalactic\nsources in the sample. We discuss several key aspects in the technique and in\nany general classification scheme, including distance metric, dimensionality,\nand measurement uncertainties. We briefly discuss the relationships between the\nArchetype technique and other machine-learning techniques, such as the\n$k$-means clustering method. Finally, our code is publicly available and the\ntechnique is generic and easy to use and expand. We expect that it can help\nmaximize the potential for astrophysical sciences of the low-S/N spectroscopic\ndata from future dark-energy surveys, and can find applications in many fields\nof astronomy, including the formation and evolution of a variety of\nastrophysical systems, such as galaxies, stars and planets.\n", "  Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) nanosheets have many properties desirable\nfor surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). BN nanosheets have a strong\nsurface adsorption capability towards airborne hydrocarbon and aromatic\nmolecules. For maximized adsorption area and hence SERS sensitivity, atomically\nthin BN nanosheet covered gold nanoparticles have been prepared for the first\ntime. When placed on top of metal nanoparticles, atomically thin BN nanosheets\nclosely follow their contours so that the plasmonic hot spots are retained.\nElectrically insulating BN nanosheets also act as a barrier layer to eliminate\nmetal-induced disturbance in SERS. Moreover, the SERS substrates veiled by BN\nnanosheets show an outstanding reusability in the long term. As the result, the\nsensitivity, reproducibility and reusability of SERS substrates can be greatly\nimproved. We also demonstrate that large BN nanosheets produced by chemical\nvapor deposition can be used to scale up the proposed SERS substrate for\npractical application.\n", "  Metal-intercalated iron selenides are a class of superconductors that have\nreceived much attention but are less understood in comparison with their\nFeAs-based counterparts. Here, the controversial issues such as Fe vacancy, the\nreal phase responsible for superconductivity, and lattice stability have been\naddressed based on first-principles calculations. New insights into the\ndistinct features in terms of carrier doping have been revealed.\n", "  The $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped\nspace is presented. The 4D Higgs field is identified as the zero mode of the\nfifth dimensional component of the gauge potentials, or as the fluctuation mode\nof the Aharonov-Bohm phase $\\theta_H$ along the fifth dimension. Fermions are\nintroduced in the bulk in the spinor and vector representations of $SO(11)$.\n$SO(11)$ is broken to $SO(4) \\times SO(6)$ by the orbifold boundary conditions,\nwhich is broken to $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y \\times SU(3)_C$ by a brane scalar.\nEvaluating the effective potential $V_{\\rm eff} (\\theta_H)$, we show that the\nelectroweak symmetry is dynamically broken to $U(1)_{\\rm EM}$. The quark-lepton\nmasses are generated by the Hosotani mechanism and brane interactions, with\nwhich the observed mass spectrum is reproduced. The proton decay is forbidden\nthanks to the new fermion number conservation. It is pointed out that there\nappear light exotic fermions. The Higgs boson mass is determined with the\nquark-lepton masses given, which, however, turns out smaller than the observed\nvalue.\n", "  We have been represented the collective information of estimation procedures\nof parameters of the open clusters and put them together for showing the\nimportance of clusters to understand their role in stellar evolution\nphenomenon. Moreover, we have been discussed about analytic techniques to\ndetermine the structural and dynamical properties of galactic clusters. The\nmembers of clusters provide unique opportunity to determine their basic\nparameters such as: age, metallicity, distance, reddening etc. The membership\nprobabilities of stars of clusters is assigned through the various approaches\nand each approach provides different number of probable members of the cluster.\nHere, we have been briefly discussed about various approaches to determine the\nstellar membership within clusters.\n", "  BEPCII is a symmetric $e^+e^-$-collider located in Beijing running at\ncenter-of-mass energies between 2.0 and 4.6 GeV. This energy range allows the\nBESIII-experiment to measure hadron form factors both from direct\n$e^+e^-$-annihilation and from initial state radiation processes. In this\npaper, results on $e^+e^-\\rightarrow p\\bar{p}$ based on data collected by\nBESIII in 2011 and 2012 are presented. We also present preliminary results on\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\Lambda \\bar{\\Lambda}$ based on the same data samples at 4\ncenter-of-mass energies. BESIII results obtained from $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ using the initial state radiation technique at the center-of-mass\nenergy of 3.773 GeV are also summarized. Finally, expectations on the\nmeasurement of baryon electromagnetic form factors from the BESIII high\nluminosity energy scan in 2015 and from initial state radiation processes at\ndifferent center-of-mass energies are also reported.\n", "  Recent theoretical and experimental studies have given raise to new aspects\nin quantum measurements and error-disturbance uncertainty relations. After a\nbrief review of these issues, we present an experimental test of the\nerror-disturbance uncertainty relations in photon polarization measurement.\nUsing generalized, strength-variable measurement of a single photon\npolarization state, we experimentally evaluate the error and disturbance in the\nmeasurement process and demonstrate the validity of recently proposed\nuncertainty relations.\n", "  We discuss replica analytic continuation using several simple models in order\nto prove mathematically the validity of replica analysis, which is used in a\nwide range of fields related to large scale complex systems. While replica\nanalysis consists of two analytical techniques, the replica trick (or replica\nanalytic continuation) and the thermodynamical limit (and/or order parameter\nexpansion), we focus our study on replica analytic continuation, which is the\nmathematical basis of the replica trick. We apply replica analysis to solve a\nvariety of analytical models, and examine the properties of replica analytic\ncontinuation. Based on the positive results for these models we propose that\nreplica analytic continuation is a robust procedure in replica analysis.\n", "  Spin-Hall oscillators are promising sources of spin-wave signals for\nmagnonics applications, and can serve as building blocks for magnonic logic in\nultralow power computation devices. Here, we analytically and micromagnetically\nstudy magnetization dynamics excited in a Spin-Hall oscillator with oblique\nmagnetization when the spin-Hall effect and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction act simultaneously. Our key results are (i) excitation of\nnonreciprocal spin-waves propagating perpendicularly to the in-plane projection\nof the static magnetization, (ii) skyrmions generation by pure spin-current,\n(iii) excitation of a new spin-wave mode with a spiral spatial profile\noriginating from a gyrotropic rotation of a dynamical skyrmion. These results\ndemonstrate that Spin-Hall oscillators can be used as generators of magnetic\nskyrmions and different types of propagating spin-waves for magnetic data\nstorage and signal processing applications.\n", "  The results from J. Stat. Phys. 159:668-712 & 163:1350-1393, on a quadratic\nkinetic equation in the analysis of the long time asymptotics of weak\nturbulence theory for the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, are summarized and\nplaced in context. Additionally, two conjectures on self-similar solutions are\npresented, and backed with consistency analysis and numerics.\n", "  Spectra of levels and transition rates are calculated for the odd--odd\nparticle--hole neutron excess nucleus $^{132}$In in the framework of the RPA\napproach.\n", "  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative quantum communications\nprotocol which exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate\nunconditionally secure cryptographic keying material between two geographically\nseparated parties. The unique nature of QKD shows promise for high-security\napplications such as those found in banking, government, and military\nenvironments. However, QKD systems contain implementation non-idealities which\ncan negatively impact their performance and security.In particular, QKD systems\noften employ the decoy state protocol to improve system throughput and mitigate\nthe threat of Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attacks. In this work, a detailed\nanalysis of the decoy state protocol is conducted which optimizes both\nperformance in terms of quantum throughput and security with respect to\ndetecting PNS attacks. The results of this study uniquely demonstrate that the\ndecoy state protocol can ensure PNS attacks are detected with high confidence,\nwhile maximizing the secure key generation rate at no additional cost.\nAdditionally, implementation security guidance is provided for QKD system\ndevelopers and users.\n", "  The operating principle and performances of the Multi-layer Thick Gaseous\nElectron Multiplier (M-THGEM) is presented. The M-THGEM is a novel hole-type\ngaseous electron multiplier produced by multi-layer printed circuit board\ntechnology; it consists of a densely perforated assembly of multiple insulating\nsubstrate sheets (e.g., FR-4), sandwiched between thin metallic-electrode\nlayers. The electron avalanche processes occur along the successive\nmultiplication stages within the M-THGEM holes, under the action of strong\ndipole fields resulting from the application of suitable potential differences\nbetween the electrodes. The present work focuses on investigation of two\ndifferent geometries: a two-layer M-THGEM (either as single or double-cascade\ndetector) and a single three-layer M-THGEM element, tested in various\nlow-pressure He-based gas mixtures. The intrinsically robust confinement of the\navalanche volume within the M-THGEM holes provides an efficient suppression of\nthe photon-induced secondary effects, resulting in a high-gain operation over a\nbroad pressure range, even in pure noble gas. The operational principle, main\nproperties (maximum achievable gain, long-term stability, energy resolution,\netc.) under different irradiation conditions, as well as capabilities and\npotential applications are discussed.\n", "  The intrinsic nonlinearity is the most remarkable characteristic of the\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) systems. Many studies have been done on atomic\nBECs with time- and space- modulated nonlinearities, while there is few work\nconsidering the atomic-molecular BECs with space-modulated nonlinearities.\nHere, we obtain two kinds of Jacobi elliptic solutions and a family of rational\nsolutions of the atomic-molecular BECs with trapping potential and\nspace-modulated nonlinearity and consider the effect of three-body interaction\non the localized matter wave solutions. The topological properties of the\nlocalized nonlinear matter wave for no coupling are analysed: the parity of\nnonlinear matter wave functions depends only on the principal quantum number\n$n$, and the numbers of the density packets for each quantum state depend on\nboth the principal quantum number $n$ and the secondary quantum number $l$.\nWhen the coupling is not zero,the localized nonlinear matter waves given by the\nrational function, their topological properties are independent of the\nprincipal quantum number $n$, only depend on the secondary quantum number $l$.\nThe Raman detuning and the chemical potential can change the number and the\nshape of the density packets. The stability of the Jacobi elliptic solutions\ndepends on the principal quantum number $n$, while the stability of the\nrational solutions depends on the chemical potential and Raman detuning.\n", "  We characterize the equation of state for a simple three-dimensional DNA\nhairpin model using a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. This algorithm was run\nat constant temperature and fixed separation between the terminal ends of the\nstrand. From the equation of state, we compute the compressibility, thermal\nexpansion coefficient, and specific heat along with adiabatic path.\n", "  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of dementia and\ncognitive decline, independent of strokes. Several mechanisms have been\nproposed to explain this association, but altered cerebral blood flow dynamics\nduring AF has been poorly investigated: in particular, it is unknown how AF\ninfluences hemodynamic parameters of the distal cerebral circulation, at the\narteriolar and capillary level. Two coupled lumped-parameter models (systemic\nand cerebrovascular circulations, respectively) were here used to simulate\nsinus rhythm (SR) and AF. For each simulation 5000 cardiac cycles were analyzed\nand cerebral hemodynamic parameters were calculated. With respect to SR, AF\ntriggered a higher variability of the cerebral hemodynamic variables which\nincreases proceeding towards the distal circulation, reaching the maximum\nextent at the arteriolar and capillary levels. This variability led to critical\ncerebral hemodynamic events of excessive pressure or reduced blood flow: 303\nhypoperfusions occurred at the arteriolar level, while 387 hypertensive events\noccurred at the capillary level during AF. By contrast, neither hypoperfusions\nnor hypertensive events occurred during SR. Thus, the impact of AF per se on\ncerebral hemodynamics candidates as a relevant mechanism into the genesis of\nAF-related cognitive impairment/dementia.\n", "  We develop a methodology to identify finite-time Lagrangian structures from\ndata and models using an extension of the Koopman operator-theoretic methods\ndeveloped for velocity fields with simple (periodic, quasi-periodic)\ntime-dependence. To achieve this, the notion of the Finite Time Ergodic (FiTER)\npartition is developed and rigorously justified. In combination with a\nclustering-based approach, the methodology enables identification of the\ntemporal evolution of Lagrangian structures in a classic, benchmark,\noceanographic transport problem, namely the cross-stream flux induced by the\ninteraction of a meso- scale Gulf Stream Ring eddy with the main jet. We focus\non a single mixing event driven by the interaction between an energetic cold\ncore ring (a cyclone), the strong jet, and a number of smaller scale cyclones\nand anticyclones. The new methodology enab les reconstruction of Lagrangian\nstructures in three dimensions and analysis of their time-evolution.\n", "  Several significant models have been developed that enable the study of\ndiffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within\nthese established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of\nthe propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative\npossibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world\nnetworks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true\npropagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly\nmeasured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied\nmodels. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that\nhas been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical\nfor large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the\nsource node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in\nmany cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a\ndiffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends\nitself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error\nminimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,\nfor both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field\noptimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness\nover several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data\napplication, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we\npropose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a\ndistance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases\nwhere the underlying dynamics are unknown.\n", "  We examine a sample of 1495 galaxies in the CANDELS fields to determine the\nevolution of two component galaxies, including bulges and discs, within massive\ngalaxies at the epoch 1 < z < 3 when the Hubble sequence forms. We fit all of\nour galaxies' light profiles with a single S\\'ersic fit, as well as with a\ncombination of exponential and S\\'ersic profiles. The latter is done in order\nto describe a galaxy with an inner and an outer component, or bulge and disc\ncomponent. We develop and use three classification methods (visual, F-test and\nthe RFF) to separate our sample into 1-component galaxies (disc/spheroids-like\ngalaxies) and 2-component galaxies (galaxies formed by an 'inner part' or bulge\nand an 'outer part' or disc). We then compare the results from using these\nthree different ways to classify our galaxies. We find that the fraction of\ngalaxies selected as 2-component galaxies increases on average 50 per cent from\nthe lowest mass bin to the most massive galaxies, and decreases with redshift\nby a factor of four from z = 1 to z = 3. We find that single S\\'ersic\n'disc-like' galaxies have the highest relative number densities at all\nredshifts, and that 2-component galaxies have the greatest increase and become\nat par with S\\'ersic discs by z = 1. We also find that the systems we classify\nas 2-component galaxies have an increase in the sizes of their outer\ncomponents, or 'discs', by about a factor of three from z = 3 to z = 1.5, while\nthe inner components or 'bulges' stay roughly the same size. This suggests that\nthese systems are growing from the inside out, whilst the bulges or protobulges\nare in place early in the history of these galaxies. This is also seen to a\nlesser degree in the growth of single 'disc-like' galaxies vs. 'spheroid-like'\ngalaxies over the same epoch.\n", "  Exciton-polariton lattices allow to implement topologically protected\nphotonic edge states at optical frequencies. Taking advantage of the\ninteracting character of polaritons, we show that several topological phases,\nbelonging to the Quantum Anomalous Hall family, can occur in polariton graphene\nwith the TE-TM spin-orbit coupling and an effective Zeeman field. This Zeeman\nfield can be entirely controlled by the non-linearity of the macro-occupied\nmode created by circularly polarized resonant pumping. The topological phases\nfound are distinct from the ones of normal graphene in presence of a\ncombination of Rashba and Zeeman field.\n", "  The reduced density matrices of a many-body quantum system form a convex set,\nwhose three-dimensional projection $\\Theta$ is convex in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The\nboundary $\\partial\\Theta$ of $\\Theta$ may exhibit nontrivial geometry, in\nparticular ruled surfaces. Two physical mechanisms are known for the origins of\nruled surfaces: symmetry breaking and gapless. In this work, we study the\nemergence of ruled surfaces for systems with local Hamiltonians in infinite\nspatial dimension, where the reduced density matrices are known to be separable\nas a consequence of the quantum de Finetti's theorem. This allows us to\nidentify the reduced density matrix geometry with joint product numerical range\n$\\Pi$ of the Hamiltonian interaction terms. We focus on the case where the\ninteraction terms have certain structures, such that ruled surface emerge\nnaturally when taking a convex hull of $\\Pi$. We show that, a ruled surface on\n$\\partial\\Theta$ sitting in $\\Pi$ has a gapless origin, otherwise it has a\nsymmetry breaking origin. As an example, we demonstrate that a famous ruled\nsurface, known as the oloid, is a possible shape of $\\Theta$, with two boundary\npieces of symmetry breaking origin separated by two gapless lines.\n"]}
