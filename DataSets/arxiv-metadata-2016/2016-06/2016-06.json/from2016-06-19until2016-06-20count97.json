We compute the planet's internal structure using a\nHenyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the\nprotoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous\nmodels of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be\napproximately one Hill sphere radius, Rhill. However, 3-D hydrodynamic\nsimulations show that only gas within 0.25Rhill remains bound to the planet,\nwith the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the\nprotoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer\nboundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach\nthe portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller\nradius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. Thermal\npressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as\nmassive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas\nhydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a\nmoderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is\nabout equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits\nto accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. To\naccount for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's\ngrowth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of\n3Myr. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and\nthermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current\nretinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. (1979).\n", "  We determine an expression for the Type I planet migration torque involving a\nlocally isothermal disk, with moderate turbulent viscosity (~0.0005 < alpha <\n~0.05), based on three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations. The\nradial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and\ntemperature are assumed to be constant near the planet. We find that the torque\nis roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial\ngradients. Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are\nnegative. Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a\nsmoothed planet potential, used to account for the effects of the third\ndimension, do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature\ngradients on the three-dimensional torque. The results suggest that\nsubstantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk\nopacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is\nlocally isothermal. The scalings of the torque and torque density with planet\nmass and gas sound speed follow the expectations of linear theory. We also\ndetermine an improved formula for the torque density distribution that can be\nused in one-dimensional long-term evolution studies of planets embedded in\nlocally isothermal disks. This formula can be also applied in the presence of\nmildly varying radial gradients and of planets that open gaps. We illustrate\nits use in the case of migrating super-Earths and determine some conditions\nsufficient for survival.\n", "  The transverse momentum ($p_{\\mathrm T}$) distribution of primary charged\nparticles is measured in minimum bias (non-single-diffractive) p-Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The\n$p_{\\mathrm T}$ spectra measured near central rapidity in the range\n$0.5<p_{\\mathrm T}<20$ GeV/$c$ exhibit a weak pseudorapidity dependence. The\nnuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{pPb}}$ is consistent with unity for\n$p_{\\mathrm T}$ above 2 GeV/$c$. This measurement indicates that the strong\nsuppression of hadron production at high $p_{\\mathrm T}$ observed in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at the LHC is not due to an initial-state effect. The measurement is\ncompared to theoretical calculations.\n", "  Inelastic proton scattering at energies of a few hundred MeV and extreme\nforward angles selectively excites the isovector spin-flip M1 (IVSM1)\nresonance. A method based on isospin symmetry is presented to extract its\nelectromagnetic transition strength from the (p,p') cross sections. It is\napplied to 48Ca, a key case for an interpretation of the quenching phenomenon\nof the spin-isospin response, and leads to a M1 strength consistent with an\nolder (e,e') experiment excluding the almost two times larger value from a\nrecent (\\gamma,n) experiment. Good agreement with electromagnetic probes is\nobserved in 208Pb suggesting the possibility to extract systematic information\non the IVSM1 resonance in heavy nuclei.\n", "  We briefly review some current theoretical and experimental aspects of the\nproblem of a single spinless impurity in a 3D polarised atomic Fermi gas at\nzero temperature where the interactions can be tuned using a wide Feshbach\nresonance. We show that various few-body states in vacuum composed of the\nimpurity and background gas atoms (single impurity, dimer, trimer, tetramer)\ngive rise to corresponding dressed states ({\\em polaron}, {\\em dimeron}, {\\em\ntrimeron}, {\\em tetrameron}) in the gas and inherit many of their\ncharacteristics. We study the ground state focussing on the choice of wave\nfunction and its properties. We raise a few unsolved problems: whether the\npolaron and dimeron are really separate branches, what other few-body states\nmight exist, the nature of the groundstate for large numbers of particle-hole\npairs and why is the polaron ansatz so good. We then turn to the excited\nstates, and to the calculation of the effective mass. We examine the bounds on\nthe effective mass and raise a conjecture about that of composite quasiparticle\nstates.\n", "  To achieve high performance on modern computers, it is vital to map\nalgorithmic parallelism to that inherent in the hardware. From an application\ndeveloper's perspective, it is also important that code can be maintained in a\nportable manner across a range of hardware. Here we present targetDP (target\nData Parallel), a lightweight programming layer that allows the abstraction of\ndata parallelism for applications that employ structured grids. A single source\ncode may be used to target both thread level parallelism (TLP) and instruction\nlevel parallelism (ILP) on either SIMD multi-core CPUs or GPU-accelerated\nplatforms. targetDP is implemented via standard C preprocessor macros and\nlibrary functions, can be added to existing applications incrementally, and can\nbe combined with higher-level paradigms such as MPI. We present CPU and GPU\nperformance results for a benchmark taken from the lattice Boltzmann\napplication that motivated this work. These demonstrate not only performance\nportability, but also the optimisation resulting from the intelligent exposure\nof ILP.\n", "  We present calculations of the early stages of the formation of Jupiter via\ncore nucleated accretion and gas capture. The core begins as a seed body of\nabout 350 kilometers in radius and orbits in a swarm of planetesimals whose\ninitial radii range from 15 meters to 50 kilometers. The evolution of the swarm\naccounts for growth and fragmentation, viscous and gravitational stirring, and\nfor drag-assisted migration and velocity damping. During this evolution, less\nthan 9% of the mass is in planetesimals smaller than 1 kilometer in radius; <\n~25% is in planetesimals with radii between 1 and 10 kilometers; and < ~7% is\nin bodies with radii larger than 100 kilometers. Gas capture by the core\nsubstantially enhances the size-dependent cross-section of the planet for\naccretion of planetesimals. The calculation of dust opacity in the planet's\nenvelope accounts for coagulation and sedimentation of dust particles released\nas planetesimals are ablated. The calculation is carried out at an orbital\nsemi-major axis of 5.2 AU and the initial solids' surface density is 10 g/cm^2\nat that distance. The results give a core mass of nearly 7.3 Earth masses\n(Mearth) and an envelope mass of approximately 0.15 Mearth after about 4e5\nyears, at which point the envelope growth rate surpasses that of the core. The\nsame calculation without the envelope yields a core of only about 4.4 Mearth.\n", "  We present the first unbiased results for the mobility $\\mu$ of\none-dimensional Holstein polaron obtained by numerical analytic continuation\ncombined with diagrammatic and world-line Monte Carlo methods in the\nthermodynamic limit. We have identified for the first time, by the\ncharacteristic $\\omega$ and $T$ dependence in the wide region of parameters,\nseveral distinct regimes in the $\\lambda-T$ plane including band conduction\nregion, incoherent metallic region, activated hopping region, and high\ntemperature saturation region. We observe for the first time that although\nmobilities and mean free paths at different values of $\\lambda$ differ by many\norders of magnitude at small temperatures, their values at $T$ larger than the\nbandwidth become very close to each other.\n", "  N-type doping of high-resistance wide bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite\nhigh-Mg-content MgxZn1-xO for instance, has always been a fundamental\napplication-motivated research issue. Herein, we report a solution to enhancing\nthe conductivity of high-resistance Mg0.51Zn0.49O active components, which has\nbeen reliably achieved by fluorine doping via radio-frequency plasma assisted\nmolecular beam epitaxial growth. Fluorine dopants were demonstrated to be\neffective donors in Mg0.51Zn0.49O single crystal film having a solar-blind 4.43\neV bandgap, with an average concentration of 1.0E19 F/cm3.The dramatically\nincreased carrier concentration (2.85E17 cm-3 vs ~1014 cm-3) and decreased\nresistivity (129 ohm.cm vs ~10E6 ohm cm) indicate that the electrical\nproperties of semi-insulating Mg0.51Zn0.49O film can be delicately regulated by\nF doping. Interestingly, two donor levels (17 meV and 74 meV) associated with F\nwere revealed by temperature-dependent Hall measurements. A Schottky type\nmetal-semiconductor-metal ultraviolet photodetector manifests a remarkably\nenhanced photocurrent, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the undoped\ncounterpart. The responsivity is greatly enhanced from 0.34 mA/W to 52 mA/W\nunder 10 V bias. The detectivity increases from 1.89E9 cm Hz1/2/W to 3.58eE10\ncm Hz1/2/W under 10 V bias at room temperature.These results exhibit F doping\nserves as a promising pathway for improving the performance of high-Mg-content\nMgxZn1-xO-based devices.\n", "  In this paper, the BF theory method is applied to the nonrotating isolated\nhorizons in Lovelock theory. The final entropy matches the Wald entropy formula\nfor this theory. We also confirm the conclusion got by Bodendorfer et. al. that\nthe entropy is related to the flux operator rather than the area operator in\ngeneral diffeomorphic-invariant theory.\n", "  The minimum-energy configuration for the magnetic field above the solar\nphotosphere is curl-free (hence, by Ampere's law, also current-free), so can be\nrepresented as the gradient of a scalar potential. Since magnetic fields are\ndivergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an\nappropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic\nvector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet\nBCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available line-of-sight\nmagnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the\nNeumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either\nchoice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field\non the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed\nfield. We present a method to combine solutions from both Dirichlet and Neumann\nBCs to determine a hybrid, \"least-squares\" potential field, which minimizes the\nintegrated square of the residual between the potential and actual fields. This\nhas advantages in both not overfitting the radial field used for the Neumann\nBC, and maximizing consistency with the observations. We demonstrate our\nmethods with SDO/HMI vector magnetic field observations of AR 11158, and find\nthat residual discrepancies between the observed and potential fields are\nsignificant, and are consistent with nonzero horizontal photospheric currents.\nWe also analyze potential fields for two other active regions observed with two\ndifferent vector magnetographs, and find that hybrid potential fields have\nsignificantly less energy than the Neumann fields in every case --- by more\nthan 10^(32) erg in some cases. This has major implications for estimates of\nfree magnetic energy in coronal field models, e.g., non-linear force-free field\nextrapolations.\n", "  We study the evolution of planetesimals in evolved gaseous disks, which orbit\na solar-mass star and harbor a Jupiter-mass planet at a_p~5AU. The gas dynamics\nis modeled with a three-dimensional hydrodynamics code that employes\nnested-grids and achieves a resolution of one Jupiter's radius in the\ncircumplanetary disk. The code models solids as individual particles.\nPlanetesimals are subjected to gravitational forces by the star and the planet,\ndrag force by the gas, disruption via ram pressure, and mass loss through\nablation. The mass evolution of solids is calculated self-consistently with\ntheir temperature, velocity, and position. We consider icy and icy/rocky bodies\nof radius 0.1-100km, initially deployed on orbits around the star within a few\nHill radii (Rhill) of the planet's orbit. Planetesimals are scattered inward,\noutward, and toward disk regions of radius r>>a_p. Scattering can relocate\nsignificant amounts of solids, provided that regions |r-a_p|~ 3Rhill are\nreplenished with planetesimals. Scattered bodies can be temporarily captured on\nplanetocentric orbits. Ablation consumes nearly all solids at gas temperatures\n> ~220K. Super-keplerian rotation around and beyond the outer edge of the gas\ngap can segregate < ~0.1km bodies, producing solid gap edges at size-dependent\nradial locations. Capture, break-up, and ablation of solids result in a\ndust-laden circumplanetary disk with low surface densities of km-size\nplanetesimals, implying relatively long timescales for satellite formation.\nAfter a giant planet acquires most of its mass, accretion of solids is unlikely\nto alter significantly its heavy-element content. The luminosity generated by\nsolids' accretion can be of a similar order of magnitude to the contraction\nluminosity.\n", "  Classical field theory is considered as a theory of unparametrized surfaces\nembedded in a configuration space, which accommodates, in a symmetric way,\nspacetime positions and field values. Dynamics is defined by a (Hamiltonian)\nconstraint between multivector-valued generalized momenta, and points in the\nconfiguration space. Starting from a variational principle, we derive local\nequations of motion, that is, differential equations that determine classical\nsurfaces and momenta. A local Hamilton-Jacobi equation applicable in the field\ntheory then follows readily. The general method is illustrated with three\nexamples: non-relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics, De Donder-Weyl scalar field\ntheory, and string theory.\n  Throughout, we use the mathematical formalism of geometric algebra and\ngeometric calculus, which allows to perform completely coordinate-free\nmanipulations.\n", "  The invariance of physical observables under disformal transformations is\nconsidered. It is known that conformal transformations leave physical\nobservables invariant. However, whether it is true for disformal\ntransformations is still an open question. In this paper, it is shown that a\npure disformal transformation without any conformal factor is equivalent to\nrescaling the time coordinate. Since this rescaling applies equally to all the\nphysical quantities, physics must be invariant under a disformal\ntransformation, that is, neither causal structure, propagation speed nor any\nother property of the fields are affected by a disformal transformation itself.\nThis fact is presented at the action level for gravitational and matter fields\nand it is illustrated with some examples of observable quantities. We also find\nthe physical invariance for cosmological perturbations at linear and high\norders in perturbation, extending previous studies. Finally, a comparison with\nHorndeski and beyond Horndeski theories under a disformal transformation is\nmade.\n", "  Rough surfaces submerged in a liquid can remain almost dry if the liquid does\nnot fully wet the roughness and gases are sustained in roughness grooves. Such\npartially dry surfaces can help reduce drag or enhance boiling. Gases sustained\nin roughness grooves would be composed of air and the vapor phase of the liquid\nitself. The thermodynamics of sustaining vapor was considered in a prior work\n[Patankar, Soft Matter, 2010, 6:1613]. Here, the thermodynamics of sustaining\ngases (e.g. air) is considered. Governing equations are presented along with a\nsolution methodology to determine a critical condition to sustain gases. The\ncritical roughness scale to sustain gases is estimated for different degrees of\nsaturation of gases dissolved in the liquid. It is shown that roughness\nspacings of less than a micron are essential to sustain gases on surfaces\nsubmerged in water at atmospheric pressure. This is consistent with prior\nempirical data.\n", "  The dispersionless Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (dKP) equation\n$(u_t+uu_x)_x=u_{yy}$ is one of the simplest nonlinear wave equations\ndescribing two-dimensional shocks. To solve the dKP equation we use a\ncoordinate transformation inspired by the method of characteristics for the\none-dimensional Hopf equation $u_t+uu_x=0$. We show numerically that the\nsolutions to the transformed equation do not develop shocks. This permits us to\nextend the dKP solution as the graph of a multivalued function beyond the\ncritical time when the gradients blow up. This overturned solution is\nmultivalued in a lip shape region in the $(x,y)$ plane, where the solution of\nthe dKP equation exists in a weak sense only, and a shock front develops. A\nlocal expansion reveals the universal scaling structure of the shock, which\nafter a suitable change of coordinates corresponds to a generic cusp\ncatastrophe. We provide a heuristic derivation of the shock front position near\nthe critical point for the solution of the dKP equation, and study the solution\nof the dKP equation when a small amount of dissipation is added. Using\nmultiple-scale analysis, we show that in the limit of small dissipation and\nnear the critical point of the dKP solution, the solution of the dissipative\ndKP equation converges to a Pearcey integral. We test and illustrate our\nresults by detailed comparisons with numerical simulations of both the\nregularized equation, the dKP equation, and the asymptotic description given in\nterms of the Pearcey integral.\n", "  We evaluate the distribution of waiting times between electrons emitted by a\ndriven mesoscopic capacitor. Based on a wave packet approach we obtain analytic\nexpressions for the electronic waiting time distribution and the joint\ndistribution of subsequent waiting times. These semi-classical results are\ncompared to a full quantum treatment based on Floquet scattering theory and\ngood agreement is found in the appropriate parameter ranges. Our results\nprovide an intuitive picture of the electronic emissions from the driven\nmesoscopic capacitor and may be tested in future experiments.\n", "  We study two exactly solvable five-dimensional thick brane world models in\npure metric $f(R)$ gravity. Working in the Einstein frame, we show that these\nsolutions are stable against small linear perturbations, including the tensor,\nvector, and scalar modes. For both models, the corresponding gravitational zero\nmode is localized on the brane, which leads to the four-dimensional Newton's\nlaw; while the massive modes are nonlocalized and only contribute a small\ncorrection to the Newton's law at a large distance.\n", "  Microscopic robots could perform tasks with high spatial precision, such as\nacting on precisely-targeted cells in biological tissues. Some tasks may\nbenefit from robots that change shape, such as elongating to improve chemical\ngradient sensing or contracting to squeeze through narrow channels. This paper\nevaluates the energy dissipation for shape-changing (i.e., metamorphic) robots\nwhose size is comparable to bacteria. Unlike larger robots, surface forces\ndominate the dissipation. Theoretical estimates indicate that the power likely\nto be available to the robots, as determined by previous studies, is sufficient\nto change shape fairly rapidly even in highly-viscous biological fluids.\nAchieving this performance will require significant improvements in\nmanufacturing and material properties compared to current micromachines.\nFurthermore, optimally varying the speed of shape change only slightly reduces\nenergy use compared to uniform speed, thereby simplifying robot controllers.\n", "  Transitions between nonequilibrium steady states obey a generalized Clausius\ninequality, which becomes an equality in the quasistatic limit. For slow but\nfinite transitions, we show that the behavior of the system is described by a\nresponse matrix whose elements are given by a far-from-equilibrium Green-Kubo\nformula, involving the decay of correlations evaluated in the nonequilibrium\nsteady state. This result leads to a fluctuation-dissipation relation between\nthe mean and variance of the nonadiabatic entropy production, $\\Delta s_{\\rm\nna}$. Furthermore, our results extend -- to nonequilibrium steady states -- the\nthermodynamic metric structure introduced by Sivak and Crooks for analyzing\nminimal-dissipation protocols for transitions between equilibrium states.\n", "  We study photon correlations generated by scattering from three-level systems\n(3LS) in one dimension. The two systems studied are a 3LS in a semi-infinite\nwaveguide (3LS plus a mirror) and two 3LS in an infinite waveguide (double\n3LS). Our two-photon scattering approach naturally connects photon correlation\neffects with inelastically scattered photons; it corresponds to input-output\ntheory in the weak-probe limit. At the resonance where electromagnetically\ninduced transparency (EIT) occurs, we find that no photons are scattered\ninelastically and hence there are no induced correlations. Slightly away from\nEIT, the total inelastically scattered flux is large, being substantially\nenhanced due to the additional interference paths. This enhancement carries\nover to the two-photon correlation function, which exhibits non-classical\nbehavior such as strong bunching with a very long time-scale. The long time\nscale originates from the slow-light effect associated with EIT.\n", "  We present estimates for the size and the logarithmic slope of the disk\ntemperature profile of the lensed quasar Q2237+0305, independent of the\ncomponent velocities. These estimates are based on six epochs of\nmulti-wavelength narrowband images from the Nordic Optical Telescope. For each\npair of lensed images and each photometric band, we determine the microlensing\namplitude and chromaticity using pre-existing mid-IR photometry to define the\nbaseline for no microlensing magnification. A statistical comparison of the\ncombined microlensing data (6 epochs $\\times$ 5 narrow bands $\\times$ 6 image\npairs) with simulations based on microlensing magnification maps gives Bayesian\nestimates for the half-light radius of $R_{1/2}=8.5^{+7.5}_{-4.0}\\sqrt{ \\langle\nM \\rangle/0.3\\, M_\\odot}$ light-days, and $p=0.95\\pm0.33$ for the exponent of\nthe logarithmic temperature profile $T\\propto R^{ -1/p}$. This size estimate is\nin good agreement with most recent studies. Other works based on the study of\nsingle microlensing events predict smaller sizes, but could be statistically\nbiased by focusing on high-magnification events.\n", "  An incommensurate spin density wave ($Q$ phase) confined inside the\nsuperconducting state at high basal plane magnetic field is an unique property\nof the heavy fermion metal CeCoIn$_5$. The neutron scattering experiments and\nthe theoretical studies point out that this state come out from the soft mode\ncondensation of magnetic resonance excitations. We show that the fixation of\ndirection of antiferromagnetic modulations by a magnetic field reported by\nGerber et al., Nat. Phys. {\\bf 10}, 126 (2014) is explained by spin-orbit\ncoupling. This result, obtained on the basis of quite general phenomenological\narguments, is supported by the microscopic derivation of the $\\chi_{zz}$\nsusceptibility dependence on the mutual orientation of the basal plane magnetic\nfield and the direction of modulation of spin polarization in a multi-band\nmetal.\n", "  We study the force balance and resulting acceleration of gas in general\nrelativity basing on simulations of accretion on a stellar-mass, non-rotating\nblack hole. We compare properties of acceleration in an optically thin,\nradiatively inefficient disk, and in an optically thick, super-critical disk\naccreting at 10 times the Eddington rate. We study both the average forces\nacting at given location and forces acting on a gas parcel along its\ntrajectory. We show that the acceleration is not a continuous process - in most\ncases gas is accelerated only in short-lasting episodes. We find that in the\ncase of optically thin disks gas is pushed out by magnetic field in the polar\nregion and by thermal pressure and centrifugal force below the disk surface. In\ncase of optically thick, radiative accretion, it is the radiation pressure\nwhich accelerates the gas in the polar funnel and which compensates (together\nwith the centrifugal force) the gravity in the bulk of the disk. We also show\nthat the Newtonian formulae for the forces are inadequate in the innermost and\nin the highly magnetized regions.\n", "  Information diffusion and disease spreading in communication-contact layered\nnetwork are typically asymmetrically coupled with each other, in which how an\nindividual being aware of disease responds to the disease can significantly\naffect the disease spreading. Many recent studies have demonstrated that human\nbehavioral adoption is a complex and non-Markovian process, where the\nprobability of adopting one behavior is dependent on the cumulative times of\nthe received information and the social reinforcement effect of these\ncumulative information. We study the impact of such a non-Markovian vaccination\nadoption behavior on the epidemic dynamics and the control effects. We find\nthat this complex adoption behavior caused from the communication layer can\nsignificantly increase the epidemic threshold and reduce the final infection\nrate. By defining the social cost as the sum of the cost of vaccination and the\ncost of treatment, we show that there exists an optimal social reinforcement\neffect or optimal information transmission rate allowing the minimal social\ncost. We also develop a mean field based theory to verify the correctness of\nthe simulation results.\n", "  Understanding the interaction between light and matter is very relevant for\nfundamental studies of quantum electrodynamics and for the development of\nquantum technologies. The quantum Rabi model captures the physics of a single\natom interacting with a single photon at all regimes of coupling strength. We\nreport the spectroscopic observation of a resonant transition that breaks a\nselection rule in the quantum Rabi model, implemented using an $LC$ resonator\nand an artificial atom, a superconducting qubit. The eigenstates of the system\nconsist of a superposition of bare qubit-resonator states with a relative sign.\nWhen the qubit-resonator coupling strength is negligible compared to their own\nfrequencies, the matrix element between excited eigenstates of different sign\nis very small in presence of a resonator drive, establishing a sign-preserving\nselection rule. Here, our qubit-resonator system operates in the ultrastrong\ncoupling regime, where the coupling strength is 10\\% of the resonator\nfrequency, allowing sign-changing transitions to be activated and, therefore,\ndetected. This work shows that sign-changing transitions are an unambiguous,\ndistinctive signature of systems operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime\nof the quantum Rabi model. These results pave the way to further studies of\nsign-preserving selection rules in multiqubit and multiphoton models.\n", "  In the present work we investigate the existence of multiple nonequilibrium\nsteady states in a coherently driven XY lattice of dissipative two-level\nsystems. A commonly used mean-field ansatz, in which spatial correlations are\nneglected, predicts a bistable behavior with a sharp shift between low- and\nhigh-density states. In contrast one-dimensional matrix product methods reveal\nthese effects to be artifacts of the mean-field approach, with both\ndisappearing once correlations are taken fully into account. Instead, a\nbunching-antibunching transition emerges. This indicates that alternative\napproaches should be considered for higher spatial dimensions, where classical\nsimulations are currently infeasible. Thus we propose a circuit QED quantum\nsimulator implementable with current technology to enable an experimental\ninvestigation of the model considered.\n", "  We study energy flows in geometrically thick accretion discs, both optically\nthick and thin, using general relativistic, three-dimensional simulations of\nblack hole accretion flows. We find that for non-rotating black holes the\nefficiency of the total feedback from thick accretion discs is $3\\%$ - roughly\nhalf of the thin disc efficiency. This amount of energy is ultimately\ndistributed between outflow and radiation, the latter scaling weakly with the\naccretion rate for super-critical accretion rates, and returned to the\ninterstellar medium. Accretion on to rotating black holes is more efficient\nbecause of the additional extraction of rotational energy. However, the jet\ncomponent is collimated and likely to interact only weakly with the\nenvironment, whereas the outflow and radiation components cover a wide solid\nangle.\n", "  In this paper we show that the diphoton mass spectrum in proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC is sensitive to the top quark flavor changing neutral\ncurrent in the vertices of $tu\\gamma$ and $tc\\gamma$. The diphoton mass\nspectrum measured by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy\nof 8 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb$^{-1}$ is used as an example\nto set limits on these FCNC couplings. It is also shown that the angular\ndistribution of the diphotons is sensitive to anomalous $tu\\gamma$ and\n$tc\\gamma$ couplings and it is a powerful tool to probe any value of the\nbranching fraction of top quark rare decay to an up-type quark plus a photon\ndown to the order of $10^{-4}$. We also show that the $tu\\gamma$ FCNC coupling\nhas a significant contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) and\nthe upper bound on neutron EDM can be used to constrain the $tu\\gamma$ FCNC\ncoupling.\n", "  In a standard semiconductor laser, electrons and holes recombine via\nstimulated emission to emit coherent light, in a process that is far from\nthermal equilibrium. Exciton-polariton condensates -- sharing the same basic\ndevice structure as a semiconductor laser, consisting of quantum wells coupled\nto a microcavity -- have been investigated primarily at densities far below the\nMott density for signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation. At high densities\napproaching the Mott density, exciton-polariton condensates are generally\nthought to revert to a standard semiconductor laser, with the loss of strong\ncoupling. Here, we report the observation of a photoluminescence sideband at\nhigh densities that cannot be accounted for by conventional semiconductor\nlasing. This also differs from an upper-polariton peak by the observation of\nthe excitation power dependence in the peak-energy separation. Our\ninterpretation as a persistent coherent electron-hole-photon coupling captures\nseveral features of this sideband whereas many remain elusive. Understanding\nthe observation will lead to a development in non-equilibrium many-body\nphysics.\n", "  We investigate how the dynamical Casimir effect can entangle quantum systems\nin different coupling regimes of circuit quantum electrodynamics, and show the\nrobustness of such entanglement generation against dissipative effects with\ncurrent technology. We consider two qubit-resonator systems, which are coupled\nby a SQUID driven with an external magnetic field, and explore the entire range\nof coupling regimes between each qubit and its respective resonator. In this\nscheme, we derive a semianalytic explanation for the entanglement generation\nbetween both superconducting qubits when they are coupled to their resonators\nin the strong coupling regime. For the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling\nregimes, we design feasible protocols to generate maximally-entangled\npolaritonic states.\n", "  We consider the model of a quantum harmonic oscillator governed by a Lindblad\nmaster equation where the typical drive and loss channels are multi-photon\nprocesses instead of single-photon ones; this implies a dissipation operator of\norder 2k with integer k>1 for a k-photon process. We prove that the\ncorresponding PDE makes the state converge, for large time, to an invariant\nsubspace spanned by a set of k selected basis vectors; the latter physically\ncorrespond to so-called coherent states with the same amplitude and uniformly\ndistributed phases. We also show that this convergence features a finite set of\nbounded invariant functionals of the state (physical observables), such that\nthe final state in the invariant subspace can be directly predicted from the\ninitial state. The proof includes the full arguments towards the well-posedness\nof the corresponding dynamics in proper Banach spaces of Hermitian trace-class\noperators equipped with adapted nuclear norms. It relies on the Hille-Yosida\ntheorem and Lyapunov convergence analysis.\n", "  Using $\\rm Er_2Ti_2O_7$ as a motivation, we investigate finite-field\nproperties of $XY$ pyrochlore antiferromagnets. In addition to a\nfluctuation-induced six-fold anisotropy present in zero field, an external\nmagnetic field induces a combination of two-, three-, and six-fold clock terms\nas a function of its orientation providing for a rich and controllable\nmagnetothermodynamics. For $\\rm Er_2Ti_2O_7$, we predict a new phase transition\nfor ${\\bf H}\\parallel [001]$. Re-entrant transitions are also found for ${\\bf\nH}\\parallel [111]$. We extend these results to the whole family the $XY$\npyrochlore antiferromagnets and show that presence and number of low-field\ntransitions for different orientations can be used for locating a given\nmaterial in the parameter space of anisotropic pyrochlores. Finite-temperature\nclassical Monte Carlo simulations serve to confirm and illustrate these\nanalytic predictions.\n", "  In this paper we analyse tiebreak results from some tennis players in order\nto investigate whether we are able to identify some strategy in this crucial\nmoment of the game. We compared the observed results with a binomial\ndistribution considering that the probabilities of winning or losing a point\nare equal. Using a $\\chi^2$ test we found that, excepting some players, the\ngreatest part of the results agrees with our hypothesis that there is no hidden\nstrategy and the points in tiebreaks are merely aleatory.\n", "  We develop an approach to generate finite-range atomic interactions via\noptical Rydberg-state excitation and study the underlying excitation dynamics\nin theory and experiment. In contrast to previous work, the proposed scheme is\nbased on resonant optical driving and the establishment of a dark state under\nconditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Analyzing the\ndriven dissipative dynamics of the atomic gas, we show that the interplay\nbetween coherent light coupling, radiative decay and strong Rydberg-Rydberg\natom interactions leads to the emergence of sizeable effective interactions\nwhile providing remarkably long coherence times. The latter are studied\nexperimentally in a cold gas of strontium atoms for which the proposed scheme\nis most efficient. Our measured atom loss is in agreement with the theoretical\nprediction based on binary effective interactions between the driven atoms.\n", "  We calculate the ground-state properties of unpolarized two-dimensional\nattractive fermions in the range from few to many particles. Using\nfirst-principles lattice Monte Carlo methods, we determine the ground-state\nenergy, Tan's contact, momentum distribution, and single-particle correlation\nfunction. We investigate those properties for systems of $N=4,8,...,40$\nparticles and for a wide range of attractive couplings. As the attractive\ncoupling is increased, the thermodynamic limit is reached at progressively\nlower $N$ due to the dominance of the two-body sector. At large momenta $k$,\nthe momentum distribution displays the expected $k^{-4}$ behavior, but its\nonset shifts from $k \\simeq 1.8 k^{}_F$ at weak coupling towards higher $k$ at\nstrong coupling.\n", "  We study the light scalar sector up to $1.8$ GeV by using a quantum field\ntheoretical approach which includes a single kaonic state in a Lagrangian with\nboth derivative and non-derivative interactions. By performing a fit to $\\pi K$\nphase shift data in the $I=1/2,$ $J=0$ channel, we show that\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ (or $\\kappa$) emerges as a dynamically generated companion\npole of $K_{0}^{\\ast }(1430)$. This is a result of investigating quantum\nfluctuations with one kaon and one pion circulating in the loops dressing\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$. We determine the position of the poles on the complex\nplane in the context of our approach: for $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$ we get\n$(1.413\\pm0.002)-i{0.02cm}(0.127\\pm0.003)$ (in GeV), while for $\\kappa$ we get\n$(0.746\\pm0.019)-i{0.02cm}(0.262\\pm0.014)$ (in GeV). The model-dependence of\nthese results and related uncertainties are discussed in the paper. A\nlarge-$N_{c}$ study confirms that $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$ is predominantly a\nquarkonium and that $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ is a molecular-like dynamically\ngenerated state.\n", "  A central task in analyzing complex dynamics is to determine the loci of\ninformation storage and the communication topology of information flows within\na system. Over the last decade and a half, diagnostics for the latter have come\nto be dominated by the transfer entropy. Via straightforward examples, we show\nthat it and a derivative quantity, the causation entropy, do not, in fact,\nquantify the flow of information. At one and the same time they can\noverestimate flow or underestimate influence. We isolate why this is the case\nand propose several avenues to alternate measures for information flow. We also\naddress an auxiliary consequence: The proliferation of networks as a now-common\ntheoretical model for large-scale systems, in concert with the use of\ntransfer-like entropies, has shoehorned dyadic relationships into our\nstructural interpretation of the organization and behavior of complex systems.\nThis interpretation thus fails to include the effects of polyadic dependencies.\nThe net result is that much of the sophisticated organization of complex\nsystems may go undetected.\n", "  Polarization maps of the Vela C molecular cloud were obtained at 250, 350,\nand 500um during the 2012 flight of the balloon-borne telescope BLASTPol. These\nmeasurements are used in conjunction with 850um data from Planck to study the\nsubmillimeter spectrum of the polarization fraction for this cloud. The\nspectrum is relatively flat and does not exhibit a pronounced minimum at\n\\lambda ~350um as suggested by previous measurements of other molecular clouds.\nThe shape of the spectrum does not depend strongly on the radiative environment\nof the dust, as quantified by the column density or the dust temperature\nobtained from Herschel data. The polarization ratios observed in Vela C are\nconsistent with a model of a porous clumpy molecular cloud being uniformly\nheated by the interstellar radiation field.\n", "  We explain the recent excess seen by ATLAS and CMS experiments at around 750\nGeV in the di-photon invariant mass as a narrow width sneutrino decaying to\ndi-photons via a stau loop in R-parity violating Supersymmetry. The stau mass\nis predicted to be somewhere between half the resonant sneutrino mass and half\nthe sneutrino mass plus 14 GeV. The scenario also predicts further signal\nchannels at an invariant mass of 750 GeV, the most promising being into di-jets\nand $WW$. We also predict a left handed charged slepton decaying into $WZ$ and\n$W \\gamma$ at a mass 750-754 GeV.\n", "  We theoretically study the magnetoconductivity of the Weyl semimetal having a\nsurface boundary under $E$ || $B$ geometry and demonstrate that the topological\nsurface state plays an essential role in the magnetotransport. In the\nlong-range disorder limit where the scattering between the two Weyl nodes\nvanishes, the conductivity diverges in the bulk model (i.e., periodic boundary\ncondition) as usually expected, since the direct inter-node relaxation is\nabsent. In the presence of the surface, however, the inter-node relaxation\nalways takes place through the mediation by the surface states, and that\nprevents the conductivity divergence. The magnetic-field dependence becomes\nalso quite different between the two cases, where the conductivity linearly\nincreases in $B$ in the surface boundary case, in contrast to $B$-independent\nbehavior in the bulk-periodic case. This is an interesting example in which the\nsame system exhibits completely different properties in the surface boundary\ncondition and the periodic boundary condition even in the macroscopic size\nlimit. In the short-range regime where the direct intervalley scattering is\ndominant, the surface states are irrelevant and the conductivity approaches\nthat of the bulk periodic model.\n", "  We study effects of a rippling gravitational background on a scalar field\nwith a double well potential, focusing on the analogy with the well known\ndynamics of the Kapitza's pendulum. The ripples are rendered as infinitesimal\nbut rapidly oscillating perturbations of the scale factor. We find that the\nresulting dynamics crucially depends on a value of the parameter $\\xi$ in the\n$\\xi \\,R\\, \\phi^2$ vertex. For the time-dependent perturbations of a proper\nform the resulting effective action is generally covariant, and at a high\nenough frequency at $\\xi<0$ and at $\\xi>1/6$ the effective potential has a\nsingle minimum at zero, thereby restoring spontaneously broken symmetry of the\nground state. On the other side, at $0<\\xi< 1/6$ spontaneous symmetry breaking\nemerges even when it is absent in the unperturbed case.\n", "  In the past decade many charmonium-like states were observed experimentally.\nEspecially those charged charmonium-like $Z_c$ states and bottomonium-like\n$Z_b$ states can not be accommodated within the naive quark model. These\ncharged $Z_c$ states are good candidates of either the hidden-charm tetraquark\nstates or molecules composed of a pair of charmed mesons. Recently, the LHCb\nCollaboration discovered two hidden-charm pentaquark states, which are also\nbeyond the quark model. In this work, we review the current experimental\nprogress and investigate various theoretical interpretations of these\ncandidates of the multiquark states. We list the puzzles and theoretical\nchallenges of these models when confronted with the experimental data. We also\ndiscuss possible future measurements which may distinguish the theoretical\nschemes on the underlying structures of the hidden-charm multiquark states.\n", "  Pairing symmetries of iron-based superconductors are investigated\nsystematically in a five-orbital model within the different regions of\ninteraction parameters by functional renormalization group(FRG). Even for a\nfixed Fermi surface with both hole and electron pockets, it is found that\ndepending on interaction parameters, a variety of pairing symmetries, including\ntwo types of $d$-wave and two types of $s$-wave pairing symmetries, can emerge.\nOnly the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and the $s\\pm$ waves are robustly supported by the\nnearest-neighbor(NN) intra-orbital $J_1$ and the next-nearest-neighbor(NNN)\nintra-orbital $J_2$ antiferromagnetic(AFM) exchange couplings respectively.\nThis study suggests that the accurate initial input of interaction parameters\nare essential to make FRG an useful method to determine the leading channel of\nsuperconducting instability.\n", "  We provide a theory of triplon dynamics in the valence bond solid ground\nstate of the coupled spin-ladders modelled for BiCu$_2$PO$_6$. Utilizing the\nrecent high quality neutron scattering data [Nature Physics (2015), DOI:\n10.1038/NPHYS3566] as guides and a theory of interacting triplons via the bond\noperator formulation, we determine a minimal spin Hamiltonian for this system.\nIt is shown that the splitting of the low energy triplon modes and the peculiar\nmagnetic field dependence of the triplon dispersions can be explained by\nincluding substantial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and symmetric anisotropic spin\ninteractions. Taking into account the interactions between triplons and the\ndecay of the triplons to the two-triplon continuum via anisotropic spin\ninteractions, we provide a theoretical picture that can be used to understand\nthe main features of the recent neutron scattering experimental data.\n", "  The VIP (Violation of Pauli exclusion principle) experiment and its follow-up\nexperiment VIP-2 at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) search for\nX-rays from Cu atomic states that are prohibited by the Pauli Exclusion\nPrinciple (PEP). The candidate events, if they exist, will originate from the\ntransition of a $2p$ orbit electron to the ground state which is already\noccupied by two electrons. The present limit on the probability for PEP\nviolation for electron is 4.7 $\\times10^{-29}$ set by the VIP experiment. With\nupgraded detectors for high precision X-ray spectroscopy, the VIP-2 experiment\nwill improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.\n", "  A Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference model is applied to the prediction of\nreactor operation parameters of a PWR nuclear power plant. In this\nnon-perturbative framework, high-dimensional covariance information describing\nthe uncertainty of microscopic nuclear data is combined with measured reactor\noperation data in order to provide statistically sound, well founded\nuncertainty estimates of integral parameters, such as the boron letdown curve\nand the burnup-dependent reactor power distribution. The performance of this\nmethodology is assessed in a blind test approach, where we use measurements of\na given reactor cycle to improve the prediction of the subsequent cycle. As it\nturns out, the resulting improvement of the prediction quality is impressive.\nIn particular, the prediction uncertainty of the boron letdown curve, which is\nof utmost importance for the planning of the reactor cycle length, can be\nreduced by one order of magnitude by including the boron concentration\nmeasurement information of the previous cycle in the analysis. Additionally, we\npresent first results of non-perturbative nuclear-data updating and show that\npredictions obtained with the updated libraries are consistent with those\ninduced by Bayesian inference applied directly to the integral observables.\n", "  Quantum network is a set of nodes connected with channels, through which the\nnodes communicate photons and classical information. Classical structural\ncomplexity of a quantum network may be defined through its physical structure,\ni.e. mutual position of nodes and channels connecting them. We show here that\nthe classical structural complexity of a quantum network does not restrict the\nstructural complexity of entanglement graphs, which may be created in the\nquantum network with local operations and classical communication. We show, in\nparticular, that 1D quantum network can simulate both simple entanglement\ngraphs such as lattices and random graphs and complex small-world graphs.\n", "  We measured the $K$-series X-rays of the $K^{-}p$ exotic atom in the\nSIDDHARTA experiment with a gaseous hydrogen target of 1.3 g/l, which is about\n15 times the $\\rho_{\\rm STP}$ of hydrogen gas. At this density, the absolute\nyields of kaonic X-rays, when a negatively charged kaon stopped inside the\ntarget, were determined to be 0.012$^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ for $K_{\\alpha}$ and\n0.043$^{+0.012}_{-0.011}$ for all the $K$-series transitions $K_{tot}$. These\nresults, together with the KEK E228 experiment results, confirm for the first\ntime a target density dependence of the yield predicted by the cascade models,\nand provide valuable information to refine the parameters used in the cascade\nmodels for the kaonic atoms.\n", "  We study a relativistic quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime in the\npresence of a uniform magnetic field and a Coulomb-type scalar potential. It is\nshown that the radial part of this problem possesses the $su(1,1)$ symmetry. We\nobtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of this problem by using two\nalgebraic methods: the Schr\\\"odinger factorization and the tilting\ntransformation. Finally, we give the explicit form of the relativistic coherent\nstates for this problem.\n", "  Multiplicity distributions of charged particles and their event-by-event\nfluctuations have been compiled for relativistic heavy-ion collisions from the\navailable experimental data at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN and also\nby the use of an event generator. Multiplicity fluctuations are sensitive to\nQCD phase transition and to the presence of critical point in the QCD phase\ndiagram. In addition, multiplicity fluctuations provide baselines for other\nevent-by-event measurements. Multiplicity fluctuation expressed in terms of the\nscaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is an intensive quantity, but\nis sensitive to the volume fluctuation of the system. The importance of the\nchoice of narrow centrality bins and the corrections of centrality bin width\neffect for controlling volume fluctuations have been discussed. It is observed\nthat the mean and width of the multiplicity distributions monotonically\nincrease as a function of increasing centrality at all collision energies,\nwhereas the multiplicity fluctuations show minimal variations with centrality.\nThe beam energy dependence shows that the multiplicity fluctuations have a slow\nrise at lower collision energies and remain constant at higher energies.\n", "  Monolayer films of FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates are electron doped\nrelative to bulk and exhibit a significantly higher superconducting transition\ntemperatures. We present density functional calculations and a modified\nSchottky model incorporating the strong paraelectricity of SrTiO$_3$ which\ndemonstrate that the doping may be due to charge transfer from SrTiO$_3$\nimpurity bands driven by work function mismatch. Physically relevant levels of\nNb doping are shown to lead to doping of the FeSe compatible with observation.\nThe coupling of electrons in FeSe to polar phonons in the depletion regime of\nthe SrTiO$_3$ is calculated. A $\\lambda\\sim 0.4$ is found; the coupling to\nlong-wavelength phonons is found to be dominant.\n", "  We explore the overlap of two nationally-recognized learning outcomes for\nphysics lab courses, namely, the ability to model experimental systems and the\nability to troubleshoot a malfunctioning apparatus. Modeling and\ntroubleshooting are both nonlinear, recursive processes that involve using\nmodels to inform revisions to an apparatus. To probe the overlap of modeling\nand troubleshooting, we collected audiovisual data from think-aloud activities\nin which eight pairs of students from two institutions attempted to diagnose\nand repair a malfunctioning electrical circuit. We characterize the cognitive\ntasks and model-based reasoning that students employed during this activity. In\ndoing so, we demonstrate that troubleshooting engages students in the core\nscientific practice of modeling.\n", "  From theoretical point of view and not being in contradiction with current\nobservational data, the cosmic strings should have fundamentally different\norigin and are characterized by wide range of energies. The paper is devoted to\nsearch for possible cosmological observational tests on superstring theory,\namong them to identification of observational characteristics to distinguish\nbetween cosmological superstring of different types. In the brane-world\nscenario with an assumption of creation of cosmological superstrings it was\nobtained the lower limit on the superstring tension as function of deficit\nangle.\n", "  We calculate particle production during inflation and in the early stages of\nreheating after inflation in models with a charged scalar field coupled to\nAbelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. A detailed analysis of the power spectra\nof primordial electric fields, magnetic fields and charge fluctuations at the\nend of inflation and preheating is provided. We carefully account for the Gauss\nconstraints during inflation and preheating, and clarify the role of the\nlongitudinal components of the electric field. We calculate the timescale for\nthe back-reaction of the produced gauge fields on the inflaton condensate,\nmarking the onset of non-linear evolution of the fields. We provide a\nprescription for initial conditions for lattice simulations necessary to\ncapture the subsequent nonlinear dynamics. On the observational side, we find\nthat the primordial magnetic fields generated are too small to explain the\norigin of magnetic fields on galactic scales and the charge fluctuations are\nwell within observational bounds for the models considered in this paper.\n", "  We compute the terahertz third-order nonlinear conductance of metallic\narmchair graphene nanoribbons using time-dependent perturbation theory.\nSignificant enhancement of the intrinsic third-order conductance over the\nresult for instrinsic 2D single-layer graphene is observed over a wide range of\ntemperatures. We also investigate the nonlinear response of extrinsic metallic\nacGNR with |E_F|<<200 meV. We find that the third-order conductance exhibits a\nstrong Fermi level dependence at low temperatures. A third-order critical field\nstrength of between 1 and 5 kV/m is computed for the Kerr conductance as a\nfunction of temperature. For the third-harmonic conductance, the minimum\ncritical field is computed to be about about 5 kV/m.\n", "  The time-dependent energy transfer in a driven quantum system strongly\ncoupled to a heat bath is studied within an influence functional approach.\nExact formal expressions for the statistics of energy dissipation into the\ndifferent channels are derived. The general method is applied to the driven\ndissipative two-state system. It is shown that the energy flows obey a balance\nrelation, and that, for strong coupling, the interaction may constitute the\nmajor dissipative channel. Results in analytic form are presented for a\nparticular value of strong Ohmic dissipation. The energy flows show interesting\nbehaviors including driving-induced coherences and quantum stochastic\nresonances.\n", "  We introduce the concept of assemblage moment matrices, i.e., a collection of\nmatrices of expectation values, each associated with a conditional quantum\nstate obtained in a steering experiment. We demonstrate how it can be used for\nquantum states and measurements characterization in a device-independent\nmanner, i.e., without invoking any assumption about the measurement or the\npreparation device. Specifically, we show how the method can be used to lower\nbound the steerability of an underlying quantum state directly from the\nobserved correlation between measurement outcomes. Combining such\ndevice-independent quantifications with earlier results established by Piani\nand Watrous [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 060404 (2015)], our approach immediately\nprovides a device-independent lower bound on the generalized robustness of\nentanglement, as well as the usefulness of the underlying quantum state for a\ntype of subchannel discrimination problem. In addition, by proving a\nquantitative relationship between steering robustness and the recently\nintroduced incompatibility robustness, our approach also allows for a\ndevice-independent quantification of the incompatibility between various\nmeasurements performed in a Bell-type experiment. Explicit examples where such\nbounds provide a kind of self-testing of the performed measurements are\nprovided.\n", "  We report on a new technique of a Multi-Cathode Counter (MCC) developed to\nsearch for hidden photon (HP) cold dark matter (CDM) with a mass from 5 to 500\neV. The method is suggested in the assumption that HP-photon mixing causes\nemission of single electrons from a metal cathode if the mass of hidden photon\nis greater than a work function of the metal. The measured effect from HP\nshould be dependent on work function of the metal and on the structure of\nelectronic shells of the metal used as a cathode. Potentially this can be used\nfor a verification of the results obtained. Some preliminary results for the\nupper limit for mixing parameter X have been obtained for HP with a mass from 5\neV to 10 keV as a pure illustration of the potential of this technique. The\nefforts are continued to refine the procedure of data treatment and to improve\nthe work of MCC. A new detector with a more developed design is under\nconstruction.\n", "  Counter-propagating and suitably polarized light (laser) beams can provide\nconditions for pair production. Here, we consider in more detail the following\ntwo situations: (i) In the homogeneity regions of anti-nodes of linearly\npolarized ultra-high intensity laser beams, the Schwinger process is\ndynamically assisted by a second high-frequency field, e.g. by a XFEL beam.\n(ii) A high-energy probe photon beam colliding with a superposition of\nco-propagating intense laser and XFEL beams gives rise to the laser assisted\nBreit-Wheeler process. Prospects of such bi-frequent field constellations with\nrespect to the feasibility of conversion of light into matter are discussed.\n", "  We introduce $\\mathrm{Nd_{3}Sb_{3}Mg_{2}O_{14}}$ with ideal kagome lattices\nof neodymium ions in ABC stacking. Thermodynamic measurements show a\nCurie-Weiss temperature of $\\Theta_{CW}=-0.12~$K, a Nd$^{3+}$ spin-1/2 Kramers\ndoublet ground state, and a second order phase transition at $T_N=0.56(2)~$K.\nNeutron scattering reveals non-coplanar scalar chiral ${\\bf k} =0$ magnetic\norder with a correlation length exceeding 400 \\AA = 55 $a$ and an ordered\nmoment of $1.79(5)~\\mu_B$. This order includes a canted ferromagnetic component\nperpendicular to the kagome planes favored by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions.\n", "  In this work, we employ the $SO(2)$-rotations of a two-component, one-, two-\nand three-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger system at and near the Manakov\nlimit, to construct vector solitons and vortex structures. This way, stable\nstationary dark-bright solitons and their higher-dimensional siblings are\ntransformed into robust oscillatory dark-dark solitons (and generalizations\nthereof), with and without a harmonic confinement. By analogy to the\none-dimensional case, vector higher-dimensional structures take the form of\nvortex-vortex states in two dimensions and, e.g., vortex ring-vortex ring ones\nin three dimensions. We consider the effects of unequal (self- and cross-)\ninteraction strengths, where the $SO(2)$ symmetry is only approximately\nsatisfied, showing the dark-dark soliton oscillation is generally robust.\nSimilar features are found in higher dimensions too, although our case examples\nsuggest that phenomena such as phase separation may contribute to the\nassociated dynamics. These results, in connection with the experimental\nrealization of one-dimensional variants of such states in optics and\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs), suggest the potential observation of the\nhigher-dimensional bound states proposed herein.\n", "  Analytic approximations for the radial distribution function, the structure\nfactor, and the equation of state of hard-core fluids in fractal dimension $d$\n($1 \\leq d \\leq 3$) are developed as heuristic interpolations from the\nknowledge of the exact and Percus-Yevick results for the hard-rod and\nhard-sphere fluids, respectively. In order to assess their value, such\napproximate results are compared with those of recent Monte Carlo simulations\nand numerical solutions of the Percus-Yevick equation for fractal dimension [M.\nHeinen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{115}, 097801 (2015)], a good agreement\nbeing observed.\n", "  The structural and magnetic study of PrMn1-xFexO3(0 <= x <= 1) substitutional\northorhombical system, was performed on polycrystalline (x <= 0.5) as well as\non the single crystalline (0.5 <= x <= 1) samples.\n", "  We describe a superconducting three-terminal device that uses a simple\ngeometric effect known as current crowding to sense the flow of current and\nactuate a readout signal. The device consists of a \"Y\"-shaped current combiner,\nwith two currents (sense and bias) entering through the top arms of the \"Y\",\nintersecting, and then exiting through the bottom leg of the \"Y\"'. This\ngeometry--mixing two inputs at a sharp intersection point--takes its\ninspiration from Y-shaped combiners in fluid flow systems, where variations in\nthe input pressures can produce at turbulence and mixing at the intersection.\nWhen current is added to or removed from one of the arms (the sense arm), the\nsuperconducting critical current in the other arm (the bias arm) is modulated.\nThe current in the sense arm can thus be determined by measuring the critical\ncurrent of the bias arm. The dependence of the bias critical current on the\nsense current is possible because current crowding causes the sense current to\ninteract locally with the bias arm. Measurement of the critical current in the\nbias arm does not break the superconducting state of the sense arm or of the\nbottom leg, and thus the signal to be sensed is fully restored after the\nmeasurement process. This device thus has potential for broad applicability\nacross superconducting technologies and materials.\n", "  We introduce a new framework for jet definitions called p-jets that matches\nthe computational speed of the currently used anti-k_T jet algorithm, but\navoids combining much of the energy from background pileup events with signal\njets. As a first illustration of the p-jet framework, we compare the\neffectiveness of a p-jet algorithm to the anti-k_T algorithm in reconstructing\nlow energy jets from resonant Z boson production and 50 pileup events.\n", "  PoGOLite is a balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimeter dedicated to the study of\npoint sources. Compton scattered events are registered using an array of\nplastic scintillator units to determine the polarisation of incident X-rays in\nthe energy range 20 - 240 keV. In 2013, a near circumpolar balloon flight of 14\ndays duration was completed after launch from Esrange, Sweden, resulting in a\nmeasurement of the linear polarisation of the Crab emission. Building on the\nexperience gained from this Pathfinder flight, the polarimeter is being\nmodified to improve performance for a second flight in 2016. Such\noptimisations, based on Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations, take into account the\nsource characteristics, the instrument response and the background environment\nwhich is dominated by atmospheric neutrons. This paper describes the\noptimisation of the polarimeter and details the associated increase in\nperformance. The resulting design, PoGO+, is expected to improve the Minimum\nDetectable Polarisation (MDP) for the Crab from 19.8% to 11.1% for a 5 day\nflight. Assuming the same Crab polarisation fraction as measured during the\n2013 flight, this improvement in MDP will allow a 5{\\sigma} constrained result.\nIt will also allow the study of the nebula emission only (Crab off-pulse) and\nCygnus X-1 if in the hard state.\n", "  Urban structures encompass settlements, characterized by the spatial\ndistribution of built-up areas, but also transportation structures, to connect\nthese built-up areas. These two structures are very different in their origin\nand function, fulfilling complementary needs: (i) to access space, and (ii) to\noccupy space. Their evolution cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics\nof urban aggregations and transportation systems separately. Instead, existing\nbuilt-up areas feed back on the further development of transportation\nstructures, and the availability of the latter feeds back on the future growth\nof urban aggregations. To model this co-evolution, we propose an agent-based\napproach that builds on existing agent-based models for the evolution of trail\nsystems and of urban settlements. The key element in these separate approaches\nis a generalized communication of agents by means of an adaptive landscape.\nThis landscape is only generated by the agents, but once it exists, it feeds\nback on their further actions. The emerging trail system or urban aggregation\nresults as a self-organized structure from these collective interactions. In\nour co-evolutionary approach, we couple these two separate models by means of\nmeta-agents that represent humans with their different demands for housing and\nmobility. We characterize our approach as a statistical ensemble approach,\nwhich allows to capture the potential of urban evolution in a bottom-up manner,\nbut can be validated against empirical observations.\n", "  We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies (RGZ-CL\nJ0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in\nthe Radio Galaxy Zoo project. We obtained a spectroscopic redshift of\n$z=0.0897$ for the E0-type host galaxy, 2MASX J08231289+0333016, leading to\nM$_r = -22.6$ and a $1.4\\,$GHz radio luminosity density of $L_{\\rm 1.4} =\n5.5\\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. These radio and optical luminosities are typical\nfor wide-angle tailed radio galaxies near the borderline between Fanaroff-Riley\n(FR) classes I and II. The projected largest angular size of $\\approx8\\,$arcmin\ncorresponds to $800\\,$kpc and the full length of the source along the curved\njets/trails is $1.1\\,$Mpc in projection. X-ray data from the XMM-Newton archive\nyield an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of the thermal emission\nsurrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301,at $1.2-2.6\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for\nassumed intra-cluster medium temperatures of $1.0-5.0\\,$keV. Our analysis of\nthe environment surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301 indicates that RGZ\nJ082312.9+033301 lies within a poor cluster. The observed radio morphology\nsuggests that (a) the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with\nrespect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster, and that (b)\nthe source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with\n$10^7\\,$yrs in between. This reinforces the idea that an association between\nRGZ J082312.9+033301, and the newly discovered poor cluster exists.\n", "  The widespread belief that the effective action is convex and has a flat\nbottom under broken global symmetry is shown to be wrong. We show spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking necessarily accompanies non-convexity in the effective action\nfor quantum field theory, or in the free energy for statistical mechanics, and\nclarify the magnitude of non-convexity. For quantum field theory, it is also\nproved that translational invariance breaks spontaneously when the system is in\nthe non-convex region, and that different vacua of spontaneously broken\nsymmetry cannot be superposed.\n  As applications of non-convexity, we study the first-order phase transition\nwhich happens at the zero field limit of spontaneously broken symmetry, and we\npropose a simple model of phase coexistence which obeys the Born rule.\n", "  Nowadays, the interest given by the scientific community to the investigation\nof the data generated by social networks is increasing as much as the\nexponential increasing of social network data. The data structure complexity is\none among the snags, which slowdown their understanding. On the other hand,\ncommunity detection in social networks helps the analyzers to reveal the\nstructure and the underlying semantic within communities. In this paper we\npropose an interactive visualization approach relying on our application\nNLCOMS, which uses synchronous and related views for graph and community\nvisualization. Additionally, we present our algorithm for community detection\nin networks. A computation study is conducted on instances generated with the\nLFR [9]-[10] benchmark. Finally, in order to assess our approach on real-world\ndata, we consider the data of the ANR-Info-RSN project. The latter addresses\ncommunity detection in Twitter.\n", "  The phenomenological Landau theory of the spin precession has been used to\nreproduce the out-of-equilibrium properties of many magnetic systems. However,\nsuch an approach suffers from some serious limitations. The main reason is that\nthe spin and the angular momentum of the atoms are described by the classical\ntheory of the angular momentum. We derive a discrete model that extends the\nLandau theory to the quantum mechanical framework. Our approach is based on the\napplication of the quantification procedure to the classical hamiltonian of an\narray of interacting spins. The connection with the classical dynamics is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a method for growing bit patterned magnetic recording media using\ndirected growth of sputtered granular perpendicular magnetic recording media.\nThe grain nucleation is templated using an epitaxial seed layer which contains\nPt pillars separated by amorphous metal oxide. The scheme enables the creation\nof both templated data and servo regions suitable for high density hard disk\ndrive operation. We illustrate the importance of using a process that is both\ntopographically and chemically driven to achieve high quality media.\n", "  We amend Babcock's original scenario for the global dynamo process that\nsustains the Sun's 22-year magnetic cycle. The amended scenario fits\npost-Babcock observed features of the magnetic activity cycle and convection\nzone, and is based on ideas of Spruit and Roberts (1983) about magnetic flux\ntubes in the convection zone. A sequence of four schematic cartoons lays out\nthe proposed evolution of the global configuration of the magnetic field above,\nin, and at the bottom of the convection zone through sunspot Cycle 23 and into\nCycle 24. Three key elements of the amended scenario are: (1) as the net\nfollowing-polarity field from the sunspot-region omega-loop fields of an\nongoing sunspot cycle is swept poleward to cancel and replace the\nopposite-polarity polar-cap field from the previous sunspot cycle, it remains\nconnected to the ongoing sunspot cycle's toroidal source-field band at the\nbottom of the convection zone; (2) topological pumping by the convection zone's\nfree convection keeps the horizontal extent of the poleward-migrating\nfollowing-polarity field pushed to the bottom, forcing it to gradually cancel\nand replace old horizontal field below it that connects the ongoing-cycle\nsource-field band to the previous-cycle polar-cap field; (3) in each polar\nhemisphere, by continually shearing the poloidal component of the settling new\nhorizontal field, the latitudinal differential rotation low in the convection\nzone generates the next-cycle source-field band poleward of the ongoing-cycle\nband. The amended scenario is a more-plausible version of Babcock's scenario,\nand its viability can be explored by appropriate kinematic flux-transport\nsolar-dynamo simulations.\n", "  Though the problem of sequence-reversed protein folding is largely\nunexplored, one might speculate that reversed native protein sequences should\nbe significantly more foldable than purely random heteropolymer sequences. In\nthis article, we investigate how the reverse-sequences of native proteins might\nfold by examining a series of small proteins of increasing structural\ncomplexity ({\\alpha}-helix, \\b{eta}-hairpin, {\\alpha}-helix bundle, and\n{\\alpha}/\\b{eta}-protein). Employing a tandem protein structure prediction\nalgorithmic and molecular dynamics simulation approach, we find that the\nability of reverse sequences to adopt native-like folds is strongly in\ninfluenced by protein size and the flexibility of the native hydrophobic core.\nFor \\b{eta}-hairpins with reverse-sequences that fail to fold, we employ a\nsimple mutational strategy for guiding stable hairpin formation that involves\nthe insertion of amino acids into the \\b{eta}-turn region. This systematic look\nat reverse sequence duality sheds new light on the problem of protein\nsequence-structure mapping and may serve to inspire new protein design and\nprotein structure prediction protocols.\n", "  A crossover between two mechanisms destabilizing the magnetization in\nequilibrium by the spin transfer effect is found in a ferromagnetic multilayer\nconsisting of an in-plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly\nmagnetized pinned layer, where an in-plane magnetic field is applied, and\nelectric current flows from the pinned to the free layer. A fast transition\nfrom the in-plane to the out-of-plane state occurs in the low-field region,\nwhereas a slow transition with small-amplitude oscillation becomes dominant in\nthe high-field region. On the other hand, only the fast transition mechanism\nappears for the opposite current direction.\n", "  The increasing interest in complex networks research has been a consequence\nof several intrinsic features of this area, such as the generality of the\napproach to represent and model virtually any discrete system, and the\nincorporation of concepts and methods deriving from many areas, from\nstatistical physics to sociology, which are often used in an independent way.\nYet, for this same reason, it would be desirable to integrate these various\naspects into a more coherent and organic framework, which would imply in\nseveral benefits normally allowed by the systematization in science, including\nthe identification of new types of problems and the cross-fertilization between\nfields. More specifically, the identification of the main areas to which the\nconcepts frequently used in complex networks can be applied paves the way to\nadopting and applying a larger set of concepts and methods deriving from those\nrespective areas. Among the several areas that have been used in complex\nnetworks research, pattern recognition, optimization, linear algebra, and time\nseries analysis seem to play a more basic and recurrent role. In the present\nmanuscript, we propose a systematic way to integrate the concepts from these\ndiverse areas regarding complex networks research. In order to do so, we start\nby grouping the multidisciplinary concepts into three main groups, namely\nfeatures, similarity, and network connectivity. Then we show that several of\nthe analysis and modeling approaches to complex networks can be thought as a\ncomposition of maps between these three groups, with emphasis on nine main\ntypes of mappings, which are presented and illustrated. Such a systematization\nof principles and approaches also provides an opportunity to review some of the\nmost closely related works in the literature, which is also developed in this\narticle.\n", "  We report on non-volatile memory devices based on multifunctional manganites.\nThe electric field induced resistive switching of\nTi/$La_{1/3}$$Ca_{2/3}$Mn$O_3$/n-Si devices is explored using different\nmeasurement protocols. We show that using current as the electrical stimulus\n(instead of standard voltage-controlled protocols) improves the electrical\nperformance of our devices and unveils an intermediate resistance state. We\nobserve three discrete resistance levels (low, intermediate and high), which\ncan be set either by the application of current-voltage ramps or by means of\nsingle pulses. These states exhibit retention and endurance capabilities\nexceeding $10^4$ s and 70 cycles, respectively. We rationalize our experimental\nobservations by proposing a mixed scenario were a metallic filament and a\nSi$O_x$ layer coexist, accounting for the observed resistive switching. Overall\nelectrode area dependence and temperature dependent resistance measurements\nsupport our scenario. After device failure takes place, the system can be\nturned functional again by heating up to low temperature (120 C), a feature\nthat could be exploited for the design of memristive devices with self-healing\nfunctionality. These results give insight into the existence of multiple\nresistive switching mechanisms in manganite-based memristive systems and\nprovide strategies for controlling them.\n", "  A new approach was proposed to accurately determine the thickness of film,\nespecially for ultra-thin film, through spectrum fitting with the assistance of\ninterference layer. The determination limit can reach even less than 1 nm. Its\naccuracy is far better than traditional methods. This determination method is\nverified by experiments and the determination limit is at least 3.5 nm compared\nwith the results of AFM. Furthermore, double-interference-aided spectra fitting\nmethod is proposed to reduce the requirements of determination instruments,\nwhich allow one to determine the film thickness with a low precision common\nspectrometer and largely lower the cost. It is a very high precision\ndetermination method for on-site and in-situ applications, especially for\nultra-thin films.\n", "  Using network-based information to facilitate information spreading is an\nessential task for spreading dynamics in complex networks, which will benefit\nthe promotion of technical innovations, healthy behaviors, new products, etc.\nFocusing on degree correlated networks, we propose a preferential contact\nstrategy based on the local network structure and local informed density to\npromote the information spreading. During the spreading process, an informed\nnode will preferentially select a contact target among its neighbors, basing on\ntheir degrees or local informed densities. By extensively implementing\nnumerical simulations in synthetic and empirical networks, we find that when\nonly consider the local structure information, the convergence time of\ninformation spreading will be remarkably reduced if low-degree neighbors are\nfavored as contact targets. Meanwhile, the minimum convergence time depends\nnon-monotonically on degree-degree correlation, and moderate correlation\ncoefficients result in most efficient information spreading. Incorporating the\ninformed density information into contact strategy, the convergence time of\ninformation spreading can be further reduced. Finally, we show that by using\nlocal informed density is more effective as compared with the global case.\n", "  In gene expression, various kinds of proteins need to bind to specific locus\nof DNA. It is still not clear how these proteins find their target locus. In\nthis study, the mean first-passage time (FPT) of protein binding to its target\nlocus on DNA chain is discussed by a chain-space coupled model. Our results\nshow that the 1-dimensional diffusion constant has a critical value, with which\nthe mean time spent by a protein to find its target locus is almost independent\nof the binding rate of protein to DNA chain and the detachment rate from DNA\nchain. Which implies that, the frequency of protein binding to DNA and the\nsliding time on DNA chain have little influence on the search efficiency, and\ntherefore whether or not the 1-dimensional sliding on DNA chain increases the\nsearch efficiency depends on the 1-dimensional diffusion constant of the\nprotein on DNA chain. This study also finds that only protein bindings to DNA\nloci which are close to the target locus help to increase the search\nefficiency, while bindings to those loci which are far from the target locus\nmight delay the target binding process. As expected, the mean FPT increases\nwith the distance between the initial position of protein in cell space and its\ntarget locus on DNA chain. The direct binding probability, which can be\nregarded as one index to describe if the 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain\nis helpful to increase the search efficiency is calculated. Our results show\nthat the influence of 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain on the search\nprocess depends on both diffusion constants of protein in cell space and on the\n1-dimensional DNA chain.\n", "  Slow oscillations (SlO) of the in-plane magnetoresistance with a frequency\nless than 4 T are observed in the rare-earth tritellurides and proposed as an\neffective tool to explore the electronic structure in various strongly\nanisotropic quasi-two-dimensional compounds. Contrary to the usual\nShubnikov-de-Haas oscillations, SlO originate not from small Fermi-surface\npockets, but from the entanglement of close frequencies due to a finite\ninterlayer transfer integral, either between the two Te planes forming a\nbilayer or between two adjacent bilayers. From the observed angular dependence\nof the frequency and the phase of SlO we argue that they originate from the\nbilayer splitting rather than from the Fermi-surface warping. The SlO frequency\ngives the value of the interlayer transfer integral $\\approx 1$ meV for\nTbTe$_3$ and GdTe$_3$.\n", "  We show that a histogram maintained throughout the Wang-Landau (WL) sampling\nfor the energy entries visited during the simulation could be used to make the\nsimulated density of states (DOS) converge. The method is easy to be\nimplemented to the WL sampling with no extra computational cost and bears the\nadvantages of both the WL method and the multicanonical method.\n", "  Alternating current electroluminescent technology allows the fabrication of\nlarge area, flat and flexible lights. Presently the maximum size of a\ncontinuous panel is limited by the high resistivity of available transparent\nelectrode materials causing a visible gradient of brightness. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the use of the best known transparent conductor\nFeCl$_{3}$-intercalated few-layer graphene boosts the brightness of\nelectroluminescent devices by 49$\\%$ compared to pristine graphene. Intensity\ngradients observed for high aspect ratio devices are undetectable when using\nthese highly conductive electrodes. Flat lights on polymer substrates are found\nto be resilient to repeated and flexural strains.\n", "  The tetragonal YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is one of the rare examples of compounds that\nallow the investigation of a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. We report in\ndetail on two different methods which have been used to grow YbNi$_4$P$_2$\nsingle crystals from a self-flux. The first, a modified Bridgman method, using\na closed crucible system yields needle-shaped single crystals oriented along\nthe $[001]$-direction. The second method, the Czochralski growth from a\nlevitating melt, yields large single crystals which can be cut in any desired\norientation. With this crucible-free method, samples without flux inclusions\nand a resistivity ratio at 1.8 K of RR$_{1.8\\rm K}= 17$ have been grown.\n", "  We discuss the importance of mixing between glueballs -- bound states of\ngluons -- and excited $\\bar{q}q$ states for the glueball search. A preliminary\nstudy of the excited states in the Extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) suggests\ntheir masses in the scalar channel to be in the vicinity of the scalar-glueball\nmass found in Lattice QCD. This could have implications for future glueball\nsearches.\n", "  Using a $SU(4)\\rightarrow Sp(4)$ pattern of chiral symmetry breaking, we\ninvestigate the pseudo-Goldstone nature of the Higgs boson in an elementary\nrealisation that at the same time provides an ultraviolet completion. The\nrenormalizability of the model together with the perturbative corrections\ndetermine dynamically the direction of vacuum of the theory and the\ncorresponding Higgs chiral symmetry breaking scale $ f \\sim 14~$TeV. The Higgs\nboson is radiatively generated and the scalar mass spectrum, together with a\nsecond massive Higgs boson, lie in the multi-TeV range.\n", "  The time precision achievable using standard analog methods is well known.\nSeveral expressions for timing methods using digitized signals have been\nrecently proposed in workshops, conferences or training courses. Most of them\nare only partially exact. This paper presents a comprehensive calculation of\nthe timing precision for algorithms using digital treatment of digitized signal\nto mimic analog discriminator-based methods. The results of these calculations\nare discussed for various cases of correlation between samples.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment searches for the neutrino-less muon to electron\nconversion in the field of a nucleus, which is a charged lepton flavor\nviolating process. The goal of the experiment is to reach a single event\nsensitivity of 2.8 x 10^{-17}, setting an upper limit on the muon conversion\nrate at 6.7 x 10^{-17}. This corresponds to a four order of magnitude\nimprovement with respect to the existing limits.\n", "  We consider a covariant phenomenological model, which describes an\ninteraction between a pseudoscalar (axion) field and massive spinning\nparticles. The model extends the Bagrmann-Michel-Telegdy approach in\napplication to the axion electrodynamics. We present some exact solutions and\ndiscuss them in the context of experimental tests of the model and axion\ndetection.\n", "  Following [5], we analyze regularity properties of single-site probability\ndistributions of the random potential and of the Integrated Density of States\n(IDS) in the Anderson models with infinite-range interactions. In the present\nwork, we study in detail a class of polynomially decaying interaction\npotentials of rather artificial (piecewise-constant) form, and give a complete\nproof of infinite smoothness of the IDS in an arbitrarily large finite domain\nsubject to the fluctuations of the entire, infinite random environment. A\nvariant of this result, based as in [5] on the harmonic analysis of probability\nmeasures, results in a proof of spectral and dynamical Anderson localization in\nthe considered models.\n", "  A fundamental obstacle for achieving quantum computation is local\ndecoherence. One way to circumvent this problem rests on the concepts of\ntopological quantum computation using non-local information storage, for\nexample on pairs of Majorana fermions (MFs). The arguably most promising way to\ngenerate MFs relies at present on spin-triplet p-wave states of superconductors\n(SC), which are not abundant in nature, unfortunately. Thus, proposals for\ntheir engineering in devices, usually via proximity effect from a conventional\nSC into materials with strong spinorbit coupling (SOC), are intensively\ninvestigated nowadays. Here we take an alternative path, exploiting the\ndifferent connections between fields based on a quartet coupling rule for\nfields introduced by one of us, we demonstrate that, for instance, coexisting\nZeeman field with a charge current would provide the conditions to induce\np-wave pairing in the presence of singlet superconductivity. This opens new\navenues for the engineering of robust MFs in various, not necessarily\n(quasi-)one-dimensional, superconductor-ferromagnet heterostructures, including\nsuch motivated by recent pioneering experiments that report MFs, in particular,\nwithout the need of any exotic materials with special structures of intrinsic\nSOC.\n", "  Quantum interference and quantum correlation, as two main features of quantum\noptics, play an essential role in quantum information applications, such as\nmulti-particle quantum walk and boson sampling. While many experimental\ndemonstrations have been done in one-dimensional waveguide arrays, it remains\nunexplored in higher dimensions due to tight requirement of manipulating and\ndetecting photons in large-scale. Here, we experimentally observe non-classical\ncorrelation of two identical photons in a fully coupled two-dimensional\nstructure, i.e. photonic lattice manufactured by three-dimensional femtosecond\nlaser writing. Photon interference consists of 36 Hong-Ou-Mandel interference\nand 9 bunching. The overlap between measured and simulated distribution is up\nto $0.890\\pm0.001$. Clear photon correlation is observed in the two-dimensional\nphotonic lattice. Combining with controllably engineered disorder, our results\nopen new perspectives towards large-scale implementation of quantum simulation\non integrated photonic chips.\n", "  We study the evolution of embedded protoplanets in a protostellar disk using\nvery high resolution nested-grid computations. This method allows us to perform\nglobal simulations of planets orbiting in disks and, at the same time, to\nresolve in detail the dynamics of the flow inside the Roche lobe of the planet.\nThe primary interest of this work lies in the analysis of the gravitational\ntorque balance acting on the planet. For this purpose we study planets of\ndifferent masses, ranging from one Earth-mass up to one Jupiter-mass, assuming\ntypical parameters of the protostellar disk. The high resolution of the method\nallows a precise determination of the mass flow onto the planet and the\nresulting torques. The obtained migration time scales are in the range from few\ntimes 10^4 years, for intermediate mass planets, to 10^6 years, for very low\nand high mass planets. Typical growth time scales depend strongly on the\nplanetary mass, ranging from a few hundred years, in the case of Earth-type\nplanets, to several ten thousand years, in the case of Jupiter-type planets.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of protoplanets with different masses embedded\nin an accretion disk, via global fully three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We consider a range of planetary masses extending from one and a\nhalf Earth's masses up to one Jupiter's mass, and we take into account\nphysically realistic gravitational potentials of forming planets. In order to\ncalculate accurately the gravitational torques exerted by disk material and to\ninvestigate the accretion process onto the planet, the flow dynamics has to be\nthoroughly resolved on long as well as short length scales. We achieve this\nstrict resolution requirement by applying a nested-grid refinement technique\nwhich allows to greatly enhance the local resolution. Our results from\naltogether 51 simulations show that for large planetary masses, approximately\nabove a tenth of the Jupiter's mass, migration rates are relatively constant,\nas expected in type II migration regime and in good agreement with previous\ntwo-dimensional calculations. In a range between seven and fifteen Earth's\nmasses, we find a dependency of the migration speed on the planetary mass that\nyields time scales considerably longer than those predicted by linear\nanalytical theories. This property may be important in determining the overall\norbital evolution of protoplanets. The growth time scale is minimum around\ntwenty Earth-masses, but it rapidly increases for both smaller and larger mass\nvalues. Significant differences between two- and three-dimensional calculations\nare found in particular for objects with masses smaller than ten Earth-masses.\nWe also derive an analytical approximation for the numerically computed mass\ngrowth rates.\n", "  With a series of numerical simulations, we analyze the thermo-hydrodynamical\nevolution of circumstellar disks containing Jupiter-size protoplanets. In the\nframework of the two-dimensional approximation, we consider an energy equation\nthat includes viscous heating and radiative effects in a simplified, yet\nconsistent form. Multiple nested grids are used in order to study both global\nand local features around the planet. By means of different viscosity\nprescriptions, we investigate various temperature regimes. A planetary mass\nrange from 0.1 to 1 Mj is examined. Computations show that gap formation is a\ngeneral property which affects density, pressure, temperature, optical\nthickness, and radiated flux distributions. However, it remains a prominent\nfeature only when the kinematic viscosity is on the order of 10^(15) cm^2/s or\nlower. Around accreting planets, a circumplanetary disk forms that has a\nsurface density profile decaying exponentially with the distance and whose mass\nis 5-6 orders of magnitudes smaller than Jupiter's mass. Circumplanetary disk\ntemperature profiles decline roughly as the inverse of the distance from the\nplanet. Temperatures range from some 10 to ~1000 K. Planetary accretion and\nmigration rates depend on the viscosity regime, with discrepancies within an\norder of magnitude. Estimates of growth and migration time scales inferred by\nthese models are on the same orders of magnitude as those previously obtained\nwith locally isothermal simulations.\n", "  We analyze the gas accretion flow through a planet-produced gap in a\nprotoplanetary disk. We adopt the alpha disk model and ignore effects of\nplanetary migration. We develop a semi-analytic, one-dimensional model that\naccounts for the effects of the planet as a mass sink and also carry out\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a planet embedded in a disk. The\npredictions of the mass flow rate through the gap based on the semi-analytic\nmodel generally agree with the hydrodynamical simulations at the 25% level.\nThrough these models, we are able to explore steady state disk structures and\nover large spatial ranges. The presence of an accreting Jupiter-mass planet\nsignificantly lowers the density of the disk within a region of several times\nthe planet's orbital radius. The mass flow rate across the gap (and onto the\ncentral star) is typically 10% to 25% of the mass accretion rate outside the\norbit of the planet, for planet-to-star mass ratios that range from 5e-5 to\n1e-3.\n"]}
