and\nhydrodynamic conditions in the halo. Armed with such measurements, we can\nexplore how radiation escapes from the Galactic plane and how infalling gas can\nsurvive a trip through the halo. The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is one of\nthe most sensitive instruments for detecting and mapping optical emission from\nthe ISM. Here, we present recent results exploring the ionization of two\ninfallling high-velocity complexes. First, we report on our progress mapping\nH-alpha emission covering the full extent of Complex A. Intensities are faint\n(<100 mR; EM <0.2 pc cm^-6 but correlate on the sky and in velocity with 21-cm\nemission. Second, we explore the ionized component of some Anti-Center Complex\nclouds studied by Peek et al. (2007) that show dynamic shaping from interaction\nwith the Galactic halo.\n", "  We investigate models for the photoionization of the widespread diffuse\nionized gas in galaxies. In particular we address the long standing question of\nthe penetration of Lyman continuum photons from sources close to the galactic\nmidplane to large heights in the galactic halo. We find that recent\nhydrodynamical simulations of a supernova-driven interstellar medium have low\ndensity paths and voids that allow for ionizing photons from midplane OB stars\nto reach and ionize gas many kiloparsecs above the midplane. We find ionizing\nfluxes throughout our simulation grids are larger than predicted by one\ndimensional slab models, thus allowing for photoionization by O stars of low\naltitude neutral clouds in the Galaxy that are also detected in Halpha. In\nprevious studies of such clouds the photoionization scenario had been rejected\nand the Halpha had been attributed to enhanced cosmic ray ionization or\nscattered light from midplane H II regions. We do find that the emission\nmeasure distributions in our simulations are wider than those derived from\nHalpha observations in the Milky Way. In addition, the horizontally averaged\nheight dependence of the gas density in the hydrodynamical models is lower than\ninferred in the Galaxy. These discrepancies are likely due to the absence of\nmagnetic fields in the hydrodynamic simulations and we discuss how\nmagnetohydrodynamic effects may reconcile models and observations.\nNevertheless, we anticipate that the inclusion of magnetic fields in the\ndynamical simulations will not alter our primary finding that midplane OB stars\nare capable of producing high altitude diffuse ionized gas in a realistic\nthree-dimensional interstellar medium.\n", "  Ionized nebulae have been targets of interest since the introduction of the\ntelescope centuries ago. These isolated, \"classical\" H II regions gave us some\nof the earliest insight into the copious feedback energy that stars inject into\nthe interstellar medium. Their unique spectra contain information about the\nquality and quantity of the ionizing field as well as the temperature, density,\nand metallicity of these discrete locations in the Galaxy. With increasing\nsensitivity across many spectral domains, we now know that ionized gas is not\nlocalized to massive star regions in many star-forming galaxies. In particular,\nrecent observational studies allow a thorough comparison of the physical\nconditions and distribution of the well-studied classical H II regions to the\nmore widespread warm, diffuse gas. By more realistically evolving a dynamic\ninterstellar medium, models are beginning to reproduce the observed emission\nmeasure variations and provide a natural solution to the propagation of\nionizing flux from a predominantly neutral galactic disk to the distant halo.\n", "  This paper discusses the stability to linearized radial perturbations of\nspherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with a \"phantom-like\" equation of\nstate for the exotic matter at the throat: $P=\\omega\\sigma$, $\\omega<0$, where\n$\\sigma$ is the energy-density of the shell and $P$ the surface pressure. This\nequation is analogous to the generalized Chaplygin-gas equation of state used\nby E.F. Eiroa. The analysis, which differes from Eiroa's in its basic approach,\nis carried out for wormholes constructed from the following spacetimes:\nSchwarzschild, de Sitter and anti de Sitter, Reissner-Nordstrom, and regular\ncharged black-hole spacetimes, as well as from black holes in dilaton and\ngeneralized dilaton-axion gravity.\n", "  Using AdS/CFT we investigate the effect of angular-momentum-induced\nanisotropy on the instantaneous drag force of a heavy quark. The dual\ndescription is that of a string moving in the background of a Kerr-AdS black\nholes. The system exhibits the expected focussing of jets towards the impact\nparameter plane. We put forward that we can use the connection between this\nfocussing behavior and the angular momentum induced pressure gradient to\nextrapolate the pressure gradient correction to the drag force that can be used\nfor transverse elliptic flow in realistic RHIC. The result is recognizable as a\nrelativistic pressure gradient force.\n", "  We propose a scheme for entangling two photons via the quantum Zeno effect,\nwhich describes the inhibition of quantum evolution by frequent measurements\nand is based on the difference between summing amplitudes and probabilities.\nFor a given error probability $P_{\\rm error}$, our scheme requires that the\none-photon loss rate $\\xi_{1\\gamma}$ and the two-photon absorption rate\n$\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ in some medium satisfy $\\xi_{1\\gamma}/\\xi_{2\\gamma}=2P_{\\rm\nerror}^2/\\pi^2$, which is significantly improved in comparison to previous\napproaches. Again based on the quantum Zeno effect, as well as coherent\nexcitations, we present a possibility to fulfill this requirement in an\notherwise linear optics set-up.\n", "  Although ab-initio calculations of relativistic Brueckner theory lead to\nlarge scalar isovector fields in nuclear matter, at present, successful\nversions of covariant density functional theory neglect the interactions in\nthis channel. A new high precision density functional DD-ME$\\delta$ is\npresented which includes four mesons $\\sigma$, $\\omega$, $\\delta$, and $\\rho$\nwith density dependent meson-nucleon couplings. It is based to a large extent\non microscopic ab-initio calculations in nuclear matter. Only four of its\nparameters are determined by adjusting to binding energies and charge radii of\nfinite nuclei. The other parameters, in particular the density dependence of\nthe meson-nucleon vertices, are adjusted to non-relativistic and relativistic\nBrueckner calculations of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter. The\nisovector effective mass $m_{p}^{\\ast}-m_{n}^{\\ast}$ derived from relativistic\nBrueckner theory is used to determine the coupling strength of the\n$\\delta$-meson and its density dependence.\n", "  We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the excitonic insulator state\ninduced by the Coulomb interaction $U$ in the two-dimensional extended\nFalicov-Kimball model. Using the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and\nHartree-Fock approximation (HFA), we evaluate the order parameter,\nsingle-particle excitation gap, momentum distribution functions, coherence\nlength of excitons, and single-particle and anomalous excitation spectra, as a\nfunction of $U$ at zero temperature. We find that in the weak-to-intermediate\ncoupling regime, the Fermi surface plays an essential role and calculated\nresults can be understood in close correspondence with the BCS theory, whereas\nin the strong-coupling regime, the Fermi surface plays no role and results are\nconsistent with the picture of BEC. Moreover, we find that HFA works well both\nin the weak- and strong-coupling regime, and that the difference between the\nresults of VCA and HFA mostly appears in the intermediate-coupling regime. The\nreason for this is discussed from a viewpoint of the self-energy. We thereby\nclarify the excitonic insulator state that typifies either a BCS condensate of\nelectron-hole pairs (weak-coupling regime) or a Bose-Einstein condensate of\npreformed excitons (strong-coupling regime).\n", "  We study the screening length of a quark-antiquark pair moving in a hot\nplasma living in two sphere $S^2$ manifold using AdS/CFT correspondence where\nthe background metric is four dimensional Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. The\ngeodesic solution of the string ends at the boundary is given by a stationary\nmotion in the equatorial plane as such the separation length $L$ of\nquark-antiquark pair is parallel to the angular velocity $\\omega$. The\nscreening length and the bound energy are computed numerically using\nMathematica. We find that the plots are bounded from below by some functions\nrelated to the momentum transfer $P_c$ of the drag force configuration. We\ncompare the result by computing the screening length in the quark-antiquark\nreference frame where the gravity dual are \"Boost-AdS\" and Kerr-AdS black\nholes. Finding relations of the parameters of both black holes, we argue that\nthe relation between mass parameters $M_{Sch}$ of the Schwarzschild-AdS black\nhole and $M_{Kerr}$ of the Kerr-AdS black hole in high temperature is given by\n$M_{Kerr}=M_{Sch}(1-a^2l^2)^{3/2}$, where $a$ is the angular momentum\nparameter.\n", "  We show that the relativistic motion of a quantum system can be used to\ngenerate quantum gates. The nonuniform acceleration of a cavity is used to\ngenerate well-known two-mode quantum gates in continuous variables. Observable\namounts of entanglement between the cavity modes are produced through\nresonances which appear by repeating periodically any trajectory.\n", "  The Brownian motion of a heavy quark under a rotating plasma corresponds to\nBTZ black hole is studied using holographic method from string theory. The\nposition of heavy quark is represented as the end of string at the boundary of\nBTZ black hole and the corresponding rotating plasma is one dimensional compact\nspace. We requires the angular velocity of the string fluctuation to be equal\nto the ratio between inner horizon and outer horizon, called terminal angular\nvelocity, which is related to the zero total force condition. We show the\ndisplacement square of this solution behaves as a Brownian particle in\nnon-relativistic limit. For relativistic case, we argue that it is more\nappropriate to compute the leading order of low frequency limit of\nrandom-random force correlator. The Brownian motion relates this correlator\nwith physical observables: effective mass of the Brownian particle, friction\ncoefficient, and temperature of the plasma.\n", "  Left-handedness is known to provide an intrinsic and tactical advantage at\ntop level in many sports involving interactive contests. Again, most of the\nrenowned leaders of the world are known to have been left-handed. Leadership\nplays an important role in politics, sports and mentorship. In this paper we\nshow that Cricket captains who bat left-handed have a strategic advantage over\nthe right-handed captains in One Day International (ODI) and Test matches. The\npresent study involving 46 left-handed captains and 148 right-handed captains\nin ODI matches, reveal a strong relation between leader's laterality and\nteam-member performance, demonstrating the critical importance of\nleft-handedness and successful leadership. The odds for superior batting\nperformance in an ODI match under left-handed captains are 89% higher than the\nodds under right-handed captains. Our study shows that left-handed captains are\nmore successful in extracting superior performance from the batsmen and bowlers\nin ODI and Test matches; perhaps indicating left-handed leaders are better\nmotivators as leaders when compared to right-handed captains.\n", "  The concept of time-space defined in an earlier paper of the author is a\ncertain generalization of the so-called space-time. In this paper we introduce\nthe concept of time-space manifolds. In the homogeneous case, a time-space\nmanifold is a differentiable manifold with such tangent spaces which have a\ncertain fixed time-space structure. We redefine the fundamental concepts of\nglobal relativity theory with respect to this general situation. We study the\nconcepts of affine connection, parallel transport, curvature tensor and\nEinstein equation, respectively.\n", "  Periodic functions are of special importance in quantum computing,\nparticularly in applications of Shor's algorithm. We explore methods of\ncreating circuits for periodic functions to better understand their properties.\nWe introduce a method for constructing the circuit for a simple monoperiodic\nfunction, that is one-to-one within a single period, of a given period p. We\nconjecture that to create a simples periodic function of period p, where p is\nan n-bit number, one needs at most n Toffoli gates.\n", "  Emergent quasiparticles that arise from the fractionalization of the\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom have been one of the central themes in modern\ncondensed matter physics. The notion of magnetic monopoles, freely moving\nquasiparticles fragmented from local dipole excitations, has enjoyed much\nsuccess in understanding the thermodynamic, static, and transport properties of\nthe so-called spin-ice materials. The artificial version of spin ice, where a\nlattice of nanoscale magnetic dipoles is sculpted out of a ferromagnetic film,\nprovides a unique opportunity to study these unusual quasiparticles in a\nmaterial-by-design approach. Here we show that the elementary excitations in\nthe ice phase of a nano-magnetic array arranged in the pentagonal lattice are\ncomposite objects comprised of the emergent monopole and a surrounding cloud of\nopposite uncompensated magnetic charges.\n", "  An SL-invariant extension of the concurrence to higher local Hilbert-space\ndimension is due to its relation with the determinant of the matrix of a\n$d\\times d$ two qudits state, which is the only SL-invariant of polynomial\ndegree $d$. This determinant is written in terms of antilinear expectation\nvalues of the local $SL(d)$ operators. We use the permutation invariance of the\ncomb-condition for creating further local antilinear operators which are\northogonal to the original operator. It means that the symmetric group acts\ntransitively on the space of combs of a given order. This extends the mechanism\nfor writing $SL(2)$-invariants for qubits to qudits. I outline the method, that\nin principle works for arbitrary dimension $d$, explicitely for spin 1, and\nspin 3/2. There is an odd-even discrepancy: whereas for half odd integer spin a\nsituation similar to that observed for qubits is found, for integer spin the\noutcome is an asymmetric invariant of polynomial degree $2d$.\n", "  We begin with a detailed description of a low dimensional quantum channel\n($d_A=4, d_E=3$) demonstrating the symmetric form of superactivation of\none-shot zero-error quantum capacity. This means appearance of a noiseless\n(perfectly reversible) subchannel in the tensor square of a channel having no\nnoiseless subchannels.\n  Then we describe a quantum channel $\\Phi$ such that $\\,\\bar{Q}_0(\\Phi)=0$ and\n$\\,\\bar{Q}_0(\\Phi\\otimes\\Phi)\\geq\\log n\\,$ for any $\\,n\\leq+\\infty$.\n  We also show that the superactivation of one-shot zero-error quantum capacity\nof a channel can be reformulated in terms of quantum measurements theory as\nappearance of an indistinguishable subspace for tensor product of two\nobservables having no indistinguishable subspaces.\n", "  We consider contribution of the radiation damping in the quantum hydrodynamic\nequations for spinless particles. We discuss possibility of obtaining of\ncorresponding non-linear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) for the macroscopic wave\nfunction. We compare contribution of the radiation damping with weakly (or\nsemi-) relativistic effects appearing in the second order by v/c. The radiation\ndamping appears in the third order by v/c. So it might be smaller than weakly\nrelativistic effects, but it gives damping of the Langmuir waves which can be\nconsiderable.\n", "  Entanglement lies at the core of quantum algorithms designed to solve\nproblems that are intractable by classical approaches. One such algorithm,\nquantum annealing (QA), provides a promising path to a practical quantum\nprocessor. We have built a series of scalable QA processors consisting of\nnetworks of manufactured interacting spins (qubits). Here, we use qubit\ntunneling spectroscopy to measure the energy eigenspectrum of two- and\neight-qubit systems within one such processor, demonstrating quantum coherence\nin these systems. We present experimental evidence that, during a critical\nportion of QA, the qubits become entangled and that entanglement persists even\nas these systems reach equilibrium with a thermal environment. Our results\nprovide an encouraging sign that QA is a viable technology for large-scale\nquantum computing.\n", "  An unexpected connection exists between compatibility criteria for quantum\nstates and symmetric informationally complete POVMs. Beginning with Caves,\nFuchs and Schack's \"Conditions for compatibility of quantum state assignments\"\n[Phys. Rev. A 66 (2002), 062111], I show that a qutrit SIC-POVM studied in\nother contexts enjoys additional interesting properties. Compatibility criteria\nprovide a new way to understand the relationship between SIC-POVMs and mutually\nunbiased bases, as calculations in the SIC representation of quantum states\nmake clear. This, in turn, illuminates the resources necessary for magic-state\nquantum computation, and why hidden-variable models fail to capture the\nvitality of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Very fast variability on scales of minutes is regularly observed in Blazars.\nThe assumption that these flares are emerging from the dominant emission zone\nof the very high energy (VHE) radiation within the jet challenges current\nacceleration and radiation models. In this work we use a spatially resolved and\ntime dependent synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model that includes the full time\ndependence of Fermi-I acceleration. We use the (apparent) orphan $\\gamma$-ray\nflare of \\textit{Mrk501} during MJD 54952 and test various flare scenarios\nagainst the observed data. We find that a rapidly variable external radiation\nfield can reproduce the high energy lightcurve best. However, the effect of the\nstrong inverse Compton (IC) cooling on other bands and the X-ray observations\nare constraining the parameters to rather extreme ranges. Then again other\nscenarios would require parameters even more extreme or stronger physical\nconstraints on the rise and decay of the source of the variability which might\nbe in contradiction with constraints derived from the size of the black hole's\nergosphere.\n", "  We study the quantum metrology for a pair of entangled Unruh-Dewitt detectors\nwhen one of them is accelerated and coupled to a massless scalar field.\nComparing with previous schemes, our model requires only local interaction and\navoids the use of cavities in the probe state preparation process. We show that\nthe probe state preparation and the interaction between the accelerated\ndetector and the external field have significant effects on the value of\nquantum Fisher information, correspondingly pose variable ultimate limit of\nprecision in the estimation of Unruh effect. We find that the precision of the\nestimation can be improved by a larger effective coupling strength and a longer\ninteraction time. Alternatively, the energy gap of the detector has a range\nthat can provide us a better precision. Thus we may adjust those parameters and\nattain a higher precision in the estimation. We also find that an extremely\nhigh acceleration is not required in the quantum metrology process.\n", "  I generalize the concept of balancedness to qudits with arbitrary dimension\n$d$. It is an extension of the concept of balancedness in New J. Phys. {\\bf\n12}, 075025 (2010) [1]. At first, I define maximally entangled states as being\nthe stochastic states (with local reduced density matrices $\\id/d$ for a\n$d$-dimensional local Hilbert space) that are not product states and show that\nevery so-defined maximal genuinely multi-qudit entangled state is balanced.\nFurthermore, all irreducibly balanced states are genuinely multi-qudit\nentangled and are locally equivalent with respect to $SL(d)$ transformations\n(i.e. the local filtering transformations (LFO)) to a maximally entangled\nstate. In particular the concept given here gives the maximal genuinely\nmulti-qudit entangled states for general local Hilbert space dimension $d$. All\ngenuinely multi-qudit entangled states are an element of the partly balanced\n$SU(d)$-orbits.\n", "  We consider random deposition of debris or blocks on a line, with block sizes\nfollowing a rigorous hierarchy: the linear size equals $1/\\lambda^n$ in\ngeneration $n$, in terms of a rescaling factor $\\lambda$. Without interactions\nbetween the blocks, this model is described by a logarithmic fractal, studied\npreviously, which is characterized by a constant increment of the length, area\nor volume upon proliferation. We study to what extent the logarithmic\nfractality survives, if each block is equipped with an Ising (pseudo-)spin\n$s=\\pm 1$ and the interactions between those spins are switched on (ranging\nfrom antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic). It turns out that the dependence of\nthe surface topology on the interaction sign and strength is not trivial. For\ninstance, deep in the ferromagnetic regime, our numerical experiments and\nanalytical results reveal a sharp crossover from a Euclidean transient,\nconsisting of aggregated domains of aligned spins, to an asymptotic logarithmic\nfractal growth. In contrast, deep into the antiferromagnetic regime the surface\nroughness is important and is shown analytically to be controlled by vacancies\ninduced by frustrated spins. Finally, in the weak interaction regime, we\ndemonstrate that the non-interacting model is extremal in the sense that the\neffect of the introduction of interactions is only quadratic in the magnetic\ncoupling strength. In all regimes, we demonstrate the adequacy of a mean-field\napproximation whenever vacancies are rare. In sum, the logarithmic fractal\ncharacter is robust with respect to the introduction of spatial correlations in\nthe hierarchical deposition process.\n", "  According to current prognosis studies of pancreatic cancer, survival rate\nnowadays is still as low as 6% mainly due to late detections. Taking into\naccount the location of the disease within the body and making use of the level\nof miniaturization in radiation detectors that can be achieved at the present\ntime, EndoTOFPET-US collaboration aims at the development of a multimodal\nimaging technique for endoscopic pancreas exams that combines the benefits of\nhigh resolution metabolic information from Time-Of- Flight (TOF) Positron\nEmission Tomography (PET) and anatomical information from ultrasound (US). A\nsystem with such capabilities calls for an application-specific\nhigh-performance Data Acquisition System (DAQ) able to control and readout data\nfrom two different detectors.\n", "  In arXiv:1306.2117, we found explicit Lax pairs for the soft edge of beta\nensembles with even integer values of $\\beta$. Using this general result, the\ncase $\\beta=6$ is further considered here. This is the smallest even $\\beta$,\nwhen the corresponding Lax pair and its relation to Painlev\\'e II (PII) have\nnot been known before, unlike cases $\\beta=2$ and $4$. It turns out that again\neverything can be expressed in terms of the Hastings-McLeod solution of PII. In\nparticular, a second order nonlinear ODE for the logarithmic derivative of\nTracy-Widom distribution for $\\beta=6$ involving the PII function in the\ncoefficients, is found, which allows one to compute asymptotics for the\ndistribution function. The ODE is a consequence of a linear system of three\nODEs for which the local singularity analysis yields series solutions with\nexponents in the set $4/3$, $1/3$ and $-2/3$.\n", "  We report a nonlocal interferometer capable of detecting entanglement and\nidentifying Bell states statistically. This is possible due to the\ninterferometer's unique correlation dependence on the anti-diagonal elements of\nthe density matrix, which have distinct bounds for separable states and unique\nvalues for the four Bell states. The interferometer consists of two spatially\nseparated balanced Mach-Zehnder or Sagnac interferometers that share a\npolarization entangled source. Correlations between these interferometers\nexhibit non-local interference, while single photon interference is suppressed.\nThis interferometer also allows for a unique version of the CHSH-Bell test\nwhere the local reality is the photon polarization. We present the relevant\ntheory and experimental results.\n", "  We investigate Rabi oscillation of an atom ensemble in Gaussian spatial\ndistribution. By using the ultrafast laser interaction with the cold atomic\nrubidium vapor spatially confined in a magneto-optical trap, the oscillatory\nbehavior of the atom excitation is probed as a function of the laser pulse\npower. Theoretical model calculation predicts that the oscillation peaks of the\nensemble-atom Rabi flopping fall on the simple Rabi oscillation curve of a\nsingle atom and the experimental result shows good agreement with the\nprediction. We also test the the three-pulse composite interaction\n$R_x(\\pi/2)R_y(\\pi)R_x(\\pi/2)$ to develop a robust method to achieve a higher\nfidelity population inversion of the atom ensemble.\n", "  The Katz-Klemm-Vafa conjecture expresses the Gromov-Witten theory of K3\nsurfaces (and K3-fibred 3-folds in fibre classes) in terms of modular forms.\nIts recent proof gives the first non-toric geometry in dimension greater than 1\nwhere Gromov-Witten theory is exactly solved in all genera.\n  We survey the various steps in the proof. The MNOP correspondence and a new\nPairs/Noether-Lefschetz correspondence for K3-fibred 3-folds transform the\nGromov-Witten problem into a calculation of the full stable pairs theory of a\nlocal K3-fibred 3-fold. The stable pairs calculation is then carried out via\ndegeneration, localisation, vanishing results, and new multiple cover formulae.\n", "  We study the secular gravitational dynamics of quadruple systems consisting\nof a hierarchical triple system orbited by a fourth body. These systems can be\ndecomposed into three binary systems with increasing semimajor axes, binaries\nA, B and C. The Hamiltonian of the system is expanded in ratios of the three\nbinary separations, and orbit-averaged. Subsequently, we numerically solve the\nequations of motion. We study highly hierarchical systems that are well\ndescribed by the lowest-order terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that the\nqualitative behaviour is determined by the ratio $\\mathcal{R}_0$ of the initial\nKozai-Lidov (KL) time-scales of the binary pairs AB and BC. If\n$\\mathcal{R}_0\\ll 1$, binaries AB remain coplanar if this is initially the\ncase, and KL eccentricity oscillations in binary B are efficiently quenched. If\n$\\mathcal{R}_0\\gg 1$, binaries AB become inclined, even if initially coplanar.\nHowever, there are no induced KL eccentricity oscillations in binary A. Lastly,\nif $\\mathcal{R}_0\\sim 1$, complex KL eccentricity oscillations can occur in\nbinary A that are coupled with the KL eccentricity oscillations in B. Even if\nbinaries A and B are initially coplanar, the induced inclination can result in\nvery high eccentricity oscillations in binary A. These extreme eccentricities\ncould have significant implications for strong interactions such as tidal\ninteractions, gravitational wave dissipation, and collisions and mergers of\nstars and compact objects. As an example, we apply our results to a planet+moon\nsystem orbiting a central star, which in turn is orbited by a distant and\ninclined stellar companion or planet, and to observed stellar quadruples.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are novel, gapped two-dimensional\nmaterials. Toward device applications, we consider MoS$_2$ layers on\ndielectrics, in particular in this work, the effect of vacancies on the\nelectronic structure. In density-functional based simulations, we consider the\neffects of near-interface O vacancies in the oxide slab, and Mo or S vacancies\nin the MoS$_2$ layer. Band structures and atom-projected densities of states\nfor each system and with differing oxide terminations were calculated, as well\nas those for the defect-free MoS$_2$-dielectrics system and for isolated\ndielectric layers for reference. Among our results, we find that with O\nvacancies, both the Hf-terminated HfO$_2$-MoS$_2$ system, and the O-terminated\nand H-passivated Al$_2$O$_3$-MoS$_2$ systems appear metallic due to doping of\nthe oxide slab followed by electron transfer into the MoS$_2$, in manner\nanalogous to modulation doping. The n-type doping of monolayer MoS$_2$ by\nhigh-k oxides with oxygen vacancies then is experimentally demonstrated by\nelectrically and spectroscopically characterizing back-gated monolayer MoS$_2$\nfield effect transistors encapsulated by oxygen deficient alumina and hafnia.\n", "  Recently ACTPol has measured the cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode and\nE-mode polarizations and obtained TE, EE, BB, TB and EB power spectra in the\nmultipole range 225-8725. In our previous paper (Ap. J. 792 (2014) 35 [Paper\nI]), we have analyzed jointly the results of three experiments on the CMB\nB-mode polarization -- SPTpol, POLARBEAR and BICEP2 to include in the model, in\naddition to the gravitational lensing and the inflationary gravitational waves\ncomponents, also the fluctuation effects induced by the cosmic polarization\nrotation (CPR), if it exists within the upper limits at the time. In this\npaper, we fit both the mean CPR angle <{\\alpha}> and its fluctuation\n<{\\delta}{\\alpha}2> from the new ACTPol data, and update our fitting of CPR\nfluctuations using BICEP2 data taking the new Planck dust measurement results\ninto consideration. We follow the method of Paper I. The mean CPR angle is\nconstrained from the EB correlation power spectra to |<{\\alpha}>| < 14 mrad\n(0.8{\\deg}) and the fluctuation (rms) is constrained from the BB correlation\npower spectra to <{\\delta}{\\alpha}2>1/2 < 29.3 mrad (1.68{\\deg}). Assuming that\nthe polarization angle of Tau A does not change from 89.2 to 146 GHz, the\nACTPol data give <{\\alpha}> = 1.0 {\\pm} 0.63{\\deg}. These results suggest that\nthe inclusion of the present ACTPol data is consistent with no CPR detection.\nWith the new Planck dust measurement, we update our fits of the BICEP2 CPR\nfluctuation constraint to be 32.8 mrad (1.88{\\deg}). The joint\nACTpol-BICEP2-POLARBEAR CPR fluctuation constraint is 23.7 mrad (1.36{\\deg}).\n", "  The anisotropic electron transport in the (001) plane of sublimation-grown\nCl$_{2}$-NDI (naphthalene diimide) single crystals is analysed over a\ntemperature range between 175 K and 300 K. Upon cooling from room temperature\nto 175 K the electron mobility along the direction of preferred transport\nmonotonously increases from 1.5 cm$^{2}$/Vs to 2.8 cm$^{2}$/Vs according to a\ndistinct temperature relation of $~T^{-1.3}$. At first glance, these\ncharacteristics allude to a coherent, i.e. band-like charge carrier transport\npredominantly governed by inelastic scattering with accoustic phonons. However,\nas we will demonstrate, the experimental mobility data can be consistently\ndescribed within the framework of incoherent, hopping-type transport modeled by\nLevich-Jortner rates, explicitly accounting for the inner and outer relaxation\nenergies related to thermally induced lattice effects and enhanced\nelectron-phonon interaction at elevated temperatures. Complementary\nband-structure calculations yielding temperature dependent effective mass\ntensors deviate stronger from experimentally observed spatially anisotropic\ntransport behavior. Thus, these results hint at the fact that by the particular\ninterplay of the transport energies the mobility of a given organic\nsemiconducting material might appear to be band-like in a certain temperature\nregime even though the underlying charge carrier transport can be of\nincoherent, hopping-type nature. Building on this description, we further\nexplore the role of the intermolecular electronic coupling and develop a\nprocedure to distinguish between its dependence on static and dynamic lattice\ndeformation upon temperature variation.\n", "  In previous works we have demonstrated how the energy distribution of\nmassless decay products in two body decays can be used to measure the mass of\ndecaying particles. In this work we show how such results can be generalized to\nthe case of multi-body decays. The key ideas that allow us to deal with\nmulti-body final states are an extension of our previous results to the case of\nmassive decay products and the factorization of the multi-body phase space. The\nmass measurement strategy that we propose is distinct from alternative methods\nbecause it does not require an accurate reconstruction of the entire event, as\nit does not involve, for instance, the missing transverse momentum, but rather\nrequires measuring only the visible decay products of the decay of interest. To\ndemonstrate the general strategy, we study a supersymmetric model wherein\npair-produced gluinos each decay to a stable neutralino and a bottom\nquark-antiquark pair via an off-shell bottom squark. The combinatorial\nbackground stemming from the indistinguishable visible final states on both\ndecay sides can be treated by an \"event mixing\" technique, the performance of\nwhich is discussed in detail. Taking into account dominant backgrounds, we are\nable to show that the mass of the gluino and, in favorable cases, that of the\nneutralino can be determined by this mass measurement strategy.\n", "  We present an algorithm to solve a system of diagonal polynomial equations\nover finite fields when the number of variables is greater than some fixed\npolynomial of the number of equations whose degree depends only on the degree\nof the polynomial equations. Our algorithm works in time polynomial in the\nnumber of equations and the logarithm of the size of the field, whenever the\ndegree of the polynomial equations is constant. As a consequence we design\npolynomial time quantum algorithms for two algebraic hidden structure problems:\nfor the hidden subgroup problem in certain semidirect product p-groups of\nconstant nilpotency class, and for the multi-dimensional univariate hidden\npolynomial graph problem when the degree of the polynomials is constant.\n", "  We study the effect of newly emerged solar active regions (ARs) on the\nlarge-scale magnetic environment of pre-existing ARs (PEARs). We first present\na theoretical approach to quantify the \"interaction energy\" between new ARs and\nPEARs as the difference between (i) the summed magnetic energies of their\nindividual potential fields and (ii) the energy of their superposed potential\nfields. We expect that this interaction energy can, depending upon the relative\narrangements of newly emerged and PEAR magnetic flux, indicate the existence of\n\"topological\" free magnetic energy in the global coronal field that is\nindependent of any \"internal\" free magnetic energy due to coronal electric\ncurrents flowing within the newly emerged and PEAR flux systems. We then\nexamine the interaction energy in two well-studied cases of flux emergence, but\nfind that the predicted energetic perturbation is relatively small compared to\nenergies released in large solar flares. Next, we present an observational\nstudy on the influence of the emergence of new ARs on flare statistics in\nPEARs, using NOAA's Solar Region Summary and GOES flare databases. As part of\nan effort to precisely determine the emergence time of ARs in a large event\nsample, we find that emergence in about half of these regions exhibits a\ntwo-stage behavior, with an initial gradual phase followed by a more rapid\nphase. Regarding flaring, we find that the emergence of new ARs is associated\nwith a significant increase in the occurrence rate of X- and M-class flares in\nPEARs. This effect tends to be more significant when PEARs and new emerging ARs\nare closer. Given the relative weakness of the interaction energy, this effect\nsuggests that perturbations in the large-scale magnetic field, such as topology\nchanges invoked in the \"breakout\" model of coronal mass ejections, might play a\nsignificant role in the occurrence of some flares.\n", "  We use a recent {\\it on-shell} Bogomol'nyi method, developed\nin~\\cite{Atmaja:2014fha}, to construct Bogomol'nyi equations of the\ntwo-dimensional generalized Maxwell-Higgs model~\\cite{Bazeia:2012uc}. The\nformalism can generate a large class of Bogomol'nyi equations parametrized by a\nconstant $C_0$. The resulting equations are classified into two types,\ndetermined by $C_0=0$ and $C_0\\neq0$. We identify that the ones obtained by\nBazeia {\\it et al}~\\cite{Bazeia:2012uc} are of the type $C_0=0$. We also\nreveal, as in the case of ordinary vortex, that this theory does not admit\nBogomol'nyi equations in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield limit in its\nspectrum. However, when the vacuum energy is lifted up by adding some constant\nto the energy density then the existence of such equation is possible. Another\npossibility whose energy is equal to the vacuum is also discussed in brief. As\na future of the \\textit{on-shell} method, we find another new Bogomol'nyi\nequations, for $C_0\\neq0$, which are related to a non-trivial function defined\nas a difference between energy density of potential term of the scalar field\nand kinetic term of the gauge field.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) are characterized by\nspin-polarized Dirac-cone surface states that are protected from backscattering\nby time-reversal symmetry. Control of the spin polarization of topological\nsurface states (TSSs) using femtosecond light pulses opens novel perspectives\nfor the generation and manipulation of dissipationless surface spin currents on\nultrafast timescales. Using time-, spin-, and angle-resolved spectroscopy, we\ndirectly monitor for the first time the ultrafast response of the spin\npolarization of photoexcited TSSs to circularly-polarized femtosecond pulses of\ninfrared light. We achieve all-optical switching of the transient out-of-plane\nspin polarization, which relaxes in about 1.2 ps. Our observations establish\nthe feasibility of ultrafast optical control of spin-polarized Dirac fermions\nin TIs and pave the way for novel optospintronic applications at ultimate\nspeeds.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann theory, we explore the\nfeasibility to maximize the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of topological\ninsulator Bi2Te3 films in the few-quintuple layer regime. We discover that the\ndelicate competitions between the surface and bulk contributions, coupled with\nthe overall quantum size effects, lead to a novel and generic non-monotonous\ndependence of ZT on the film thickness. In particular, when the system crosses\ninto the topologically non-trivial regime upon increasing the film thickness,\nthe much longer surface relaxation time associated with the robust nature of\nthe topological surface states results in a maximal ZT value, which can be\nfurther optimized to ~2.0 under physically realistic conditions. We also reveal\nthe appealing potential of bridging the long-standing ZT asymmetry of p- and\nn-type Bi2Te3 systems.\n", "  The pole extrapolation method is applied to the semi-inclusive inelastic\nelectron scattering off the deuteron with tagged spectator protons to extract\nthe high-x structure function of the neutron. This approach is based on the\nextrapolation of the measured cross sections at different momenta of the\nspectator proton to the non-physical pole of the bound neutron in the deuteron.\nThe advantage of the method is in the possibility of suppression of the nuclear\neffects in a maximally model-independent way. The neutron structure functions\nobtained in this way demonstrate a surprising x dependence at $x\\ge 0.6$ and\n$1.6 \\leq Q^2 \\leq 3.38$ GeV$^2$, indicating a possible rise of the neutron to\nproton structure function ratio. If the observed rise is valid in the true deep\ninelastic region then it may indicate new dynamics in the generation of high-x\nquarks in the nucleon. One such mechanism we discuss is the possible dominance\nof short-range isosinglet quark-quark correlations that can enhance the d-quark\ndistribution in the proton.\n", "  Transiting circumbinary planets are more easily detected around short-period\nthan long-period binaries, but none have yet been observed by {\\it Kepler}\norbiting binaries with periods shorter than seven days. In triple systems,\nsecular Kozai-Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF) have been shown to reduce\nthe inner orbital period from $\\sim 10^4$ to a few days. Indeed, the majority\nof short-period binaries are observed to possess a third stellar companion.\nUsing secular evolution analysis and population synthesis, we show that KLCTF\nmakes it unlikely for circumbinary transiting planets to exist around\nshort-period binaries. We find the following outcomes. (1) Sufficiently massive\nplanets in tight and/or coplanar orbits around the inner binary can quench the\nKL evolution because they induce precession in the inner binary. The KLCTF\nprocess does not take place, preventing the formation of a short-period binary.\n(2) Secular evolution is not quenched and it drives the planetary orbit into a\nhigh eccentricity, giving rise to an unstable configuration, in which the\nplanet is most likely ejected from the system. (3) Secular evolution is not\nquenched but the planet survives the KLCTF evolution. Its orbit is likely to be\nmuch wider than the currently observed inner binary orbit, and is likely to be\neccentric and inclined with respect to the inner binary. These outcomes lead to\ntwo main conclusions: (1) it is unlikely to find a massive planet on a tight\nand coplanar orbit around a short-period binary, and (2) the properties of\ncircumbinary planets in short-period binaries are constrained by secular\nevolution.\n", "  A new non-Hermitian E2-quasi-exactly solvable model is constructed containing\ntwo previously known models of this type as limits in one of its three\nparameters. We identify the optimal finite approximation to the double scaling\nlimit to the complex Mathieu Hamiltonian. A detailed analysis of the vicinity\nof the exceptional points in the parameter space is provided by discussing the\nbranch cut structures responsible for the chirality when exceptional points are\nsurrounded and the structure of the corresponding energy eigenvalue loops\nstretching over several Riemann sheets. We compute the Stieltjes measure and\nmomentum functionals for the coefficient functions that are univariate weakly\northogonal polynomials in the energy obeying three-term recurrence relations.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental observation of an hydrostatic pressure\ninduced transition from semiconductor to semimetal in black phosphorus [Chen et\nal. in arXiv:1504.00125], we present the first principles calculation on the\npressure effect of the electronic structures of black phosphorus. It is found\nthat the band crossover and reversal at the Z point occur around the critical\npressure Pc1=1.23 Gpa, and the band inversion evolves into 4 twofold-degenerate\nDirac cones around the Z point, suggesting a 3D Dirac semimetal. With further\nincreasing pressure the Dirac cones in the Gamma-Z line move toward the Gamma\npoint and evolve into two hole-type Fermi pockets, and those in the Z-M lines\nmove toward the M point and evolve into 2 hole-type Fermi pockets up to P=4.0\nGpa. It demonstrates clearly that the Lifshitz transition occurs at $P_{c1}$\nfrom semiconductor to 3D Dirac semimetal protected by the nonsymmorphic space\nsymmetry of bulk. This suggests the bright perspective of black phosphorus for\noptoelectronic and electronic devices due to its easy modulation by pressure.\n", "  In many real world networks agents are initially unsure of each other's\nqualities and must learn about each other over time via repeated interactions.\nThis paper is the first to provide a methodology for studying the dynamics of\nsuch networks, taking into account that agents differ from each other, that\nthey begin with incomplete information, and that they must learn through past\nexperiences which connections/links to form and which to break. The network\ndynamics in our model vary drastically from the dynamics in models of complete\ninformation. With incomplete information and learning, agents who provide high\nbenefits will develop high reputations and remain in the network, while agents\nwho provide low benefits will drop in reputation and become ostracized. We\nshow, among many other things, that the information to which agents have access\nand the speed at which they learn and act can have a tremendous impact on the\nresulting network dynamics. Using our model, we can also compute the ex ante\nsocial welfare given an arbitrary initial network, which allows us to\ncharacterize the socially optimal network structures for different sets of\nagents. Importantly, we show through examples that the optimal network\nstructure depends sharply on both the initial beliefs of the agents, as well as\nthe rate of learning by the agents. Due to the potential negative consequences\nof ostracism, it may be necessary to place agents with lower initial\nreputations at less central positions within the network.\n", "  We give two constructions of grading-restricted vertex (super)algebras. We\nfirst give a new construction of a class of grading-restricted vertex\n(super)algebras originally obtained by Meurman and Primc using a different\nmethod. This construction is based on a new definition of vertex operators and\na new method. Our second construction is a generalization of the author's\nconstruction of the moonshine module vertex operator algebra and a related\nvertex operator superalgebra. This construction needs properties of\nintertwining operators formulated and proved by the author.\n", "  Real-time controls based on quantum measurements are powerful tools for\nvarious quantum protocols. However, their experimental realization have been\nlimited by mode-mismatch between temporal mode of quadrature measurement and\nthat heralded by photon detection. Here, we demonstrate real-time quadrature\nmeasurement of a single-photon wavepacket induced by a photon detection, by\nutilizing continuous temporal-mode-matching between homodyne detection and an\nexponentially rising temporal mode. Single photons in exponentially rising\nmodes are also expected to be useful resources for interactions with other\nquantum systems.\n", "  Since horizon formation in global anti-de Sitter spacetime is dual to\nthermalization of a conformal field theory on a compact space, whether generic\ninitial data is stable or unstable against gravitational collapse is of great\ninterest. We argue that all the known stable initial data for massless scalars\nare dominated by single scalar eigenmodes, specifically providing strong\nnumerical evidence consistent with the interpretation that initial data with\nequal energies in two modes collapse on time scales of order the inverse square\nof the amplitude. We further scan the parameter space for massive scalar field\ninitial data and present evidence for a novel class of stable or quasi-stable\nsolutions for massive scalars with energy spread through several eigenmodes.\n", "  A common perception assumes that magnetic memories require ferromagnetic\nmaterials with a non-zero net magnetic moment. However, it has been recently\nproposed that compensated antiferromagnets with a zero net moment may represent\na viable alternative to ferromagnets. So far, experimental research has focused\non bistable memories in antiferromagnetic metals. In the present work we\ndemonstrate a multiple-stable memory device in epitaxial manganese telluride\n(MnTe) which is an antiferromagnetic counterpart of common II-VI\nsemiconductors. Favorable micromagnetic characteristics of MnTe allow us to\ndemonstrate a smoothly varying antiferromagnetic anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(AMR) with a harmonic angular dependence on the applied magnetic field,\nanalogous to ferromagnets. The continuously varying AMR provides means for the\nelectrical read-out of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states which we\nset by heat-assisted magneto-recording and by changing the angle of the writing\nfield. We explore the dependence of the magnitude of the zero-field read-out\nsignal on the strength of the writing field and demonstrate the robustness of\nthe antiferromagnetic memory states against strong magnetic field\nperturbations. We ascribe the multiple-stability in our antiferromagnetic\nmemory to different distributions of domains with the N\\'eel vector aligned\nalong one of the three $c$-plane magnetic easy axes in the hexagonal MnTe film.\nThe domain redistribution is controlled during the heat-assisted recording by\nthe strength and angle of the writing field and freezes when sufficiently below\nthe N\\'eel temperature.\n", "  We unveil the existence of a non-trivial Berry phase associated to the\ndynamics of a quantum particle in a one dimensional box with moving walls. It\nis shown that a suitable choice of boundary conditions has to be made in order\nto preserve unitarity. For these boundary conditions we compute explicitly the\ngeometric phase two-form on the parameter space. The unboundedness of the\nHamiltonian describing the system leads to a natural prescription of\nrenormalization for divergent contributions arising from the boundary.\n", "  Potentiality of the presence of traversable wormholes in the outer/inner\nregions of the halos of galaxies, situated on the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\ndensity profile and Universal Rotation Curve (URC) dark matter models have been\ninvestigated recently. Since this covers our own galaxy also as a possible home\nfor traversable wormholes it prompts us to further the subject by considering\nalternative density distributions. From this token herein we make use of the\nEinasto model to describe the density profiles for the same purpose. Our choice\nfor the latter is based on the fact that theoretical dark matter halos produced\nin computer simulations are best described by such a profile. For technical\nreasons we trim the number of parameters in the Einasto profile to a possible\nminimum. Based on such a model it is shown that traversable wormholes in the\nouter regions of spiral galaxies are possible while the inner part regions\nprohibit such formations.\n", "  The Madelung equations map the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrodinger\nequation into hydrodynamic equations of a virtual fluid. Here we show that an\nincrease of the Boltzmann entropy of this Madelung fluid is proportional to the\nexpectation value of its velocity divergence. Hence, entropy growth is\naccompanied by expansion resulting from the ability of the Madelung fluid to be\ncompressible. The compressibility itself reflects superposition of solutions of\nthe Schrodinger equation. Thus, in unitary processes where the Madelung fluid\nexpands and then shrinks, the Boltzmann entropy may, correspondingly, grow and\nthen decrease. The notion of entropy growth due to expansion is common in\ndiffusive processes, however in the latter the process is irreversible. Much\nunlike the Boltzmann entropy, the von Neumann entropy, does not vary with time.\nTo elucidate the physical underpinning of the Boltzmann entropy, we examine\nseveral specific examples. We demonstrate that, for classical diffusive\nprocesses, the \"force\" accelerating diffusion has the form of the positive\ngradient of the quantum Bohm potential. In the Madelung fluid, the advective\nand the diffusive velocities correspond respectively to the the real and\nimaginary parts of the complex momentum. We find that the diffusion coefficient\nprovides a lower bound of Heisenberg uncertainty type product between the gas\nmean free path and the Brownian momentum.\n", "  The Voronoi cell of any atom in a lattice is identical. If atoms are\nperturbed from their lattice coordinates, then the topologies of the Voronoi\ncells of the atoms will change. We consider the distribution of Voronoi cell\ntopologies in two-dimensional perturbed systems. These systems can be thought\nof as simple models of finite-temperature crystals. We give analytical results\nfor the distribution of Voronoi topologies of points in two-dimensional Bravais\nlattices under infinitesimal perturbations and present a discussion with\nnumerical results for finite perturbations.\n", "  The mathematics of gauge theories lies behind many of the most profound\nadvances in physics in the last 200 years, from Maxwell's theory of\nelectromagnetism to Einstein's theory of general relativity. More recently it\nhas become clear that gauge theories also emerge in condensed matter, a prime\nexample being the spin ice materials which host an emergent electromagnetic\ngauge field. In spin ice, the underlying gauge structure is revealed by the\npresence of pinch-point singularities in neutron-scattering measurements. Here\nwe report the discovery of a spin liquid where the low-temperature physics is\nnaturally described by the fluctuations of a tensor field with a continuous\ngauge freedom. This gauge structure underpins an unusual form of spin\ncorrelations, giving rise to pinch-line singularities--- line-like analogues of\nthe pinch-points observed in spin ice. Remarkably, these features may already\nhave been observed in the pyrochlore material Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.\n", "  We investigate the FMR characteristics of a magnetic dimer composed of two\nchains of iron nanoparticles coupled by dipolar interactions. The latter are\ntreated beyond the point-dipole approximation taking into account the finite\nsize and arbitrary shape of the nano-elements. The resonance frequency is\ncalculated as a function of the amplitude of the applied magnetic field and the\nresonance field is computed as a function of the direction of the applied\nfield, varied both in the plane of the two chains and perpendicular to it. We\nhighlight a critical value of the magnetic field which marks a state transition\nthat should be important in magnetic recording media.\n", "  In this short paper we provide an overview of new results from the ATLAS\nphysics program at the LHC as of spring 2015. We separately summarize the\nresults from p+Pb collisions and Pb+Pb collisions along with some of their\ninterpretations.\n", "  We develop, in the context of general relativity, the notion of a geoid -- a\nsurface of constant \"gravitational potential\". In particular, we show how this\nidea naturally emerges as a specific choice of a previously proposed, more\ngeneral and operationally useful construction called a quasilocal frame -- that\nis, a choice of a two-parameter family of timelike worldlines comprising the\nworldtube boundary of the history of a finite spatial volume. We study the\ngeometric properties of these geoid quasilocal frames, and construct solutions\nfor them in some simple spacetimes. We then compare these results -- focusing\non the computationally tractable scenario of a non-rotating body with a\nquadrupole perturbation -- against their counterparts in Newtonian gravity (the\nsetting for current applications of the geoid), and we compute\ngeneral-relativistic corrections to some measurable geometric quantities.\n", "  The expression of the free energy of a liquid in terms of an explicit\ndecomposition of the particle configurations into local coordination clusters\nis examined. We argue that the major contribution to the entropy associated\nwith structural fluctuations arises from the local athermal constraints imposed\nby the overlap of adjacent coordination shells. In the context of the recently\ndeveloped Favoured Local Structure model [Soft Matt. 11, 3322 (2015)], we\nderive explicit expressions for the structural energy and entropy in the high\ntemperature limit, compare this approximation with simulation data and consider\nthe extension of this free energy to the case of spatial inhomogeneity in the\ndistribution of local structures.\n", "  We studied the spatial coherence of a Bosonic two-dimensional multi-mode\ncondensate both through measurements and simulations. It is shown that\ncondensates with a constant spatial density must be described as the\nsuperposition of several quantized modes which reduces the overall coherence.\nIn this case, the spatial coherence can appear to decay faster than allowed by\nthe Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory. However, we find through\nspectroscopic measurements that the individual modes show a slower decay of the\nspatial coherence than the overall system.\n", "  Bolometric detectors are excellent devices for the investigation of\nneutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$). The observation of such\ndecay would demonstrate the violation of lepton number, and at the same time it\nwould necessarily imply that neutrinos have a Majorana character. The\nsensitivity of cryogenic detectors based on TeO$_2$ is strongly limited by the\nalpha background in the region of interest for the 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ of\n$^{130}$Te. It has been demonstrated that particle discrimination in TeO$_2$\nbolometers is possible measuring the Cherenkov light produced by particle\ninteractions. However an event-by-event discrimination with NTD-based light\ndetectors has to be demonstrated. We will discuss the performance of a\nhighly-sensitive light detector exploiting the Neganov-Luke effect for signal\namplification. The detector, being operated with NTD-thermistor and coupled to\na 750 g TeO$_2$ crystal, shows the ability for an event-by-event identification\nof electron/gamma and alpha particles. The extremely low detector baseline\nnoise, RMS 19 eV, demonstrates the possibility to enhance the sensitivity of\nTeO$_2$-based 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiment to an unprecedented level.\n", "  Quantum chemistry simulations on a quantum computer suffer from the overhead\nneeded for encoding the fermionic problem in a bosonic system of qubits. By\nexploiting the block diagonality of a fermionic Hamiltonian, we show that the\nnumber of required qubits can be reduced by a factor of two or more. There is\nno need to go into the basis of the Hilbert space for this reduction because\nall operations can be performed in the operator space. The scheme is conceived\nas a pre-computational step that would be performed on a classical computer\nprior to the actual quantum simulation. We apply this scheme to reduce the\nnumber of qubits necessary to simulate both the Hamiltonian of the two-site\nFermi-Hubbard model and the hydrogen molecule. Both quantum systems can then be\nsimulated with a two-qubit quantum computer.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger model with\nhopping to the first and a selected N-th neighbor, motivated by a helicoidal\narrangement of lattice sites. We provide a detailed analysis of the\nmodulational instability properties of this equation, identifying distinctive\nmulti-stage instability cascades due to the helicoidal hopping term.\nBistability is a characteristic feature of the intrinsically localized breather\nmodes, and it is shown that information on the stability properties of weakly\nlocalized solutions can be inferred from the plane-wave modulational\ninstability results. Based on this argument, we derive analytical estimates of\nthe critical parameters at which the fundamental on-site breather branch of\nsolutions turns unstable. In the limit of large N, these estimates predict the\nemergence of an effective threshold behavior, which can be viewed as the result\nof a dimensional crossover to a two-dimensional square lattice.\n", "  We consider a simple model of the quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas\nconfined in the one-dimensional square well potential. All dipoles are assumed\nto be oriented along the confining axis. By means of hydrodynamic approach it\nis shown that the general structure of the low-lying excitations can be\nanalyzed exactly. We demonstrate that the problem significantly simplifies in\nthe high-density limit for which the density profile in the confined direction\nas well as the leading-order contribution to the ground-state energy and\nspectrum of elementary excitations are calculated. The low-temperature result\nfor the damping rate of the phonon mode is also presented.\n", "  A new computational method for finite-temperature properties of strongly\ncorrelated electrons is proposed by extending the variational Monte Carlo\nmethod originally developed for the ground state. The method is based on the\npath integral in the imaginary-time formulation, starting from the\ninfinite-temperature state that is well approximated by a small number of\ncertain random initial states. Lower temperatures are progressively reached by\nthe imaginary-time evolution. The algorithm follows the framework of the\nquantum transfer matrix and finite-temperature Lanczos methods, but we extends\nthem to treat much larger system sizes without the negative sign problem by\noptimizing the truncated Hilbert space on the basis of the time-dependent\nvariational principle (TDVP). This optimization algorithm is equivalent to the\nstochastic reconfiguration (SR) method that has been frequently used for the\nground state to optimally truncate the Hilbert space. The obtained\nfinite-temperature states allow an interpretation based on the thermal pure\nquantum (TPQ) state instead of the conventional canonical-ensemble average. Our\nmethod is tested for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models and its\naccuracy and efficiency are demonstrated.\n", "  Recently the presence of topologically protected edge-states in\nBi$_{14}$Rh$_3$I$_9$ was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy\nconsolidating this compound as a weak 3D topological insulator (TI). Here, we\npresent a density-functional-theory-based study on a family of TIs derived from\nthe Bi$_{14}$Rh$_3$I$_9$ parent structure via substitution of Ru, Pd, Os, Ir\nand Pt for Rh. Comparative analysis of the band-structures throughout the\nentire series is done by means of a unified minimalistic tight-binding model\nthat evinces strong similarity between the quantum-spin-Hall (QSH) layer in\nBi$_{14}$Rh$_3$I$_9$ and graphene in terms of $p_z$-molecular orbitals.\nTopologically non-trivial energy gaps are found for the Ir-, Rh-, Pt- and\nPd-based systems, whereas the Os- and Ru-systems remain trivial. Furthermore,\nthe energy position of the metal $d$-band centre is identified as the parameter\nwhich governs the evolution of the topological character of the band structure\nthrough the whole family of TIs. The $d$-band position is shown to correlate\nwith the chemical bonding within the QSH layers, thus revealing how the\nchemical nature of the constituents affects the topological band character.\n", "  Sea-level rise (SLR) causes estimates of flood risk made under the assumption\nof stationary mean sea level to be biased low. However, adjustments to flood\nreturn levels made assuming fixed increases of sea level are also inaccurate\nwhen applied to sea level that is rising over time at an uncertain rate. To\naccommodate both the temporal dynamics of SLR and their uncertainty, we develop\nan Average Annual Design Life Level (AADLL) metric and associated Design Life\nSLR (DL-SLR) allowances. The AADLL is the flood level corresponding to a\ntime-integrated annual expected probability of occurrence (AEP) under\nuncertainty over the design life of an asset; DL-SLR allowances are the\nadjustment from 2000 levels that maintain current average probability over the\ndesign life. Given non-stationary and uncertain sea-level rise, AADLL flood\nlevels and DL-SLR allowances provide estimates of flood protection heights and\noffsets for different planning horizons and different levels of confidence in\nSLR projections in coastal areas. Here we employ probabilistic sea-level rise\nprojections to illustrate the calculation of AADLL flood levels and DL-SLR\nallowances for a set of long-duration tide gauges along U.S. coastlines.\n", "  We report a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of the\nsuperconducting state in the quasi-two-dimensional organic superconductor\n$\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br. Applying spin-fluctuation theory to a\nlow-energy material-specific Hamiltonian derived from ab initio density\nfunctional theory we calculate the quasiparticle density of states in the\nsuperconducting state. We find a distinct three-peak structure that results\nfrom a strongly anisotropic mixed-symmetry superconducting gap with eight nodes\nand twofold rotational symmetry. This theoretical prediction is supported by\nlow-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy on in situ cleaved single\ncrystals of $\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br with the tunneling direction\nparallel to the layered structure.\n", "  We present a method for studying the secular gravitational dynamics of\nhierarchical multiple systems consisting of nested binaries, which is valid for\nan arbitrary number of bodies and arbitrary hierarchical structure. We derive\nthe Hamiltonian of the system and expand it in terms of the -- assumed to be --\nsmall ratios $x_i$ of binary separations. At the lowest nontrivial expansion\norder (quadrupole order, second order in $x_i$), the Hamiltonian consists of\nterms which, individually, depend on binary pairs. At higher orders, in\naddition to terms depending on binary pairs, we also find terms which,\nindividually, depend on more than two binaries. In general, at order $n$ in\n$x_i$, individual terms depend on at most $n-1$ binaries. We explicitly derive\nthe Hamiltonian including all terms up and including third order in $x_i$\n(octupole order), and including the binary pairwise terms up and including\nfifth order in $x_i$. These terms are orbit averaged, and we present a new\nalgorithm for efficiently solving the equations of motion. This algorithm is\nhighly suitable for studying the secular evolution of hierarchical systems with\ncomplex hierarchies, making long-term integrations of such systems feasible. We\nshow that accurate results are obtained for multiplanet systems with semimajor\naxis ratios as large as $\\approx 0.4$, provided that high-order terms are\nincluded. In addition to multiplanet systems with a single star, we apply our\nresults to multistar systems with multiple planets.\n", "  A major challenge in quantum computing is to solve general problems with\nlimited physical hardware. Here, we implement digitized adiabatic quantum\ncomputing, combining the generality of the adiabatic algorithm with the\nuniversality of the digital approach, using a superconducting circuit with nine\nqubits. We probe the adiabatic evolutions, and quantify the success of the\nalgorithm for random spin problems. We find that the system can approximate the\nsolutions to both frustrated Ising problems and problems with more complex\ninteractions, with a performance that is comparable. The presented approach is\ncompatible with small-scale systems as well as future error-corrected quantum\ncomputers.\n", "  We report the discovery and confirmation of two sub-Saturn planets orbiting a\nbright (V = 11.3), metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.42 $\\pm$ 0.04 dex) G3 dwarf in the K2\nCampaign 2 field. The planets are 5.68 $\\pm$ 0.56 Earth-radii and 7.82 $\\pm$\n0.72 Earth-radii and have orbital periods of 20.8851 $\\pm$ 0.0003 d and\n42.3633$\\pm$0.0006 d, near to the 2:1 mean-motion resonance. We obtained 32\nradial velocities (RVs) with Keck/HIRES and detected the reflex motion due to\nEPIC-203771098b and c. These planets have masses of 21.0 $\\pm$ 5.4 Earth-masses\nand 27.0 $\\pm$ 6.9 Earth-masses, respectively. With low densities of 0.63 $\\pm$\n0.25 g/cc and 0.31 $\\pm$ 0.12 g/cc, respectively, the planets require thick\nenvelopes of H/He to explain their large sizes and low masses. Interior\nstructure models predict that the planets have fairly massive cores of 17.6\n$\\pm$ 4.3 Earth-masses and 16.1 $\\pm$ 4.2 Earth-masses, respectively. They may\nhave formed exterior to their present locations, accreted their H/He envelopes\nat large orbital distances, and migrated in as a resonant pair. The proximity\nto resonance, large transit depths, and host star brightness offer rich\nopportunities for TTV follow-up. Finally, the low surface gravities of the\nEPIC-203771098 planets make them favorable targets for transmission\nspectroscopy by HST, Spitzer, and JWST.\n", "  We show how lattice Quantum Monte Carlo can be applied to the electronic\nproperties of carbon nanotubes in the presence of strong electron-electron\ncorrelations. We employ the path-integral formalism and use methods developed\nwithin the lattice QCD community for our numerical work. Our lattice\nHamiltonian is closely related to the hexagonal Hubbard model augmented by a\nlong-range electron-electron interaction. We apply our method to the\nsingle-quasiparticle spectrum of the (3,3) armchair nanotube configuration, and\nconsider the effects of strong electron-electron correlations. Our approach is\nequally applicable to other nanotubes, as well as to other carbon\nnanostructures. We benchmark our Monte Carlo calculations against the two- and\nfour-site Hubbard models, where a direct numerical solution is feasible.\n", "  Recent years have brought more precise temperature measurements of the\nlow-density intergalactic medium (IGM). These new measurements constrain the\nprocesses that heated the IGM, such as the reionization of H I and of He II. We\npresent a semi-analytical model for the thermal history of the IGM that follows\nthe photoheating history of primordial gas. Our model adopts a multizone\napproach that, compared to previous models, more accurately captures the\ninhomogeneous heating and cooling of the IGM during patchy reionization. We\ncompare our model with recent temperature measurements spanning z = 1.6-4.8,\nfinding that these measurements are consistent with scenarios in which the He\nII was reionized at z = 3-4 by quasars. Significantly longer duration or higher\nredshift He II reionization scenarios are ruled out by the measurements. For\nhydrogen reionization, we find that only low-redshift and high-temperature\nscenarios are excluded. For example, a model in which the IGM was heated to 30\n000 K when an ionization front passed, and with hydrogen reionization occurring\nover 6 < z < 9, is ruled out. Finally, we place constraints on how much heating\ncould owe to TeV blazars, cosmic rays, and other non-standard mechanisms. We\nfind that by z = 2, a maximum of 1 eV of additional heat could be injected per\nbaryon over standard photoheating-only models, with this limit becoming <~0.5\neV at z > 3.\n", "  We discuss the diboson excess seen by the ATLAS detector around 2 TeV in the\nLHC run I at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. We explore the possibility that such an excess\ncan arise from a $Z'$ boson which acquires mass through a $U(1)_X$ Stueckelberg\nextension. The corresponding $Z'$ gauge boson is leptophobic with a mass of\naround 2 TeV and has interactions with $SU(2)_L$ Yang-Mills fields and gauge\nfields of the hypercharge. The analysis predicts $Z'$ decays into $WW$ and $ZZ$\nas well as into $Z\\gamma$. Further three-body as well as four-body decays of\nthe $Z'$ such as $WWZ, WW\\gamma, WWZZ$ etc are predicted. In the analysis we\nuse the helicity formalism which allows us to exhibit the helicity structure of\nthe $Z'$ decay processes in an transparent manner. In particular, we are able\nto show the set of vanishing helicity amplitudes in the decay of the massive\n$Z'$ into two vector bosons due to angular momentum conservation with a special\nchoice of the reference momenta. The residual set of non-vanishing helicity\namplitudes are identified. The parameter space of the model compatible with the\ndiboson excess seen by the ATLAS experiment at $\\sqrt s=8$ TeV is exhibited.\nEstimate of the diboson excess expected at $\\sqrt s= 13$ TeV with 20 fb$^{-1}$\nof integrated luminosity at LHC run II is also given. It is shown that the\n$WW$, $ZZ$ and $Z\\gamma$ modes are predicted to be in the approximate ratio\n$1:\\cos^2\\theta_W (1+ \\alpha \\tan^2\\theta_W)^2/2: (1-\\alpha)^2\\sin^2\\theta_W/2$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the relative strength of the couplings of hypercharge gauge\nfields to the couplings of the Yang-Mills gauge fields. Thus observation of the\n$Z\\gamma$ mode as well as three-body and four-body decay modes of the $Z'$ will\nprovide a definite test of the model and of a possible new source of\ninteraction beyond the standard model.\n", "  Motivated by quantum quenches in spin chains, a one-dimensional toy-model of\nfermionic particles evolving in imaginary-time from a domain-wall initial state\nis solved. The main interest of this toy-model is that it exhibits the arctic\ncircle phenomenon, namely a spatial phase separation between a critically\nfluctuating region and a frozen region. Large-scale correlations inside the\ncritical region are expressed in terms of correlators in a (euclidean)\ntwo-dimensional massless Dirac field theory. It is observed that this theory is\ninhomogenous: the metric is position-dependent, so it is in fact a Dirac field\ntheory in curved space. The technique used to solve the toy-model is then\nextended to deal with the transfer matrices of other models: dimers on the\nhoneycomb and square lattice, and the six-vertex model at the free fermion\npoint ($\\Delta=0$). In all cases, explicit expressions are given for the\nlong-range correlations in the critical region, as well as for the underlying\nDirac action. Although the setup developed here is heavily based on fermionic\nobservables, the results can be translated into the language of height\nconfigurations and of the gaussian free field, via bosonization. Correlations\nclose to the phase boundary and the generic appearance of Airy processes in all\nthese models are also briefly revisited in the appendix.\n", "  The demonstration of strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes of cavity QED\nwith polyatomic molecules has opened new routes to control chemical dynamics at\nthe nanoscale. We show that strong resonant coupling of a cavity field with an\nelectronic transition can effectively decouple collective electronic and\nnuclear degrees of freedom in a disordered molecular ensemble, even for\nmolecules with high-frequency quantum vibrational modes having strong\nelectron-vibration interactions. This type of polaron decoupling can be used to\ncontrol chemical reactions. We show that the rate of electron transfer\nreactions in a cavity can be orders of magnitude larger than in free space, for\na wide class of organic molecular species.\n", "  The Complex singlet extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) is the simplest\nextension that provides scenarios for Higgs pair production with different\nmasses. The model has two interesting phases: the dark matter phase, with a\nStandard Model-like Higgs boson, a new scalar and a dark matter candidate; and\nthe broken phase, with all three neutral scalars mixing. In the latter phase\nHiggs decays into a pair of two different Higgs bosons are possible. In this\nstudy we analyse Higgs-to-Higgs decays in the framework of singlet extensions\nof the Standard Model (SM), with focus on the CxSM. After demonstrating that\nscenarios with large rates for such chain decays are possible we perform a\ncomparison between the NMSSM and the CxSM. We find that, based on\nHiggs-to-Higgs decays, the only possibility to distinguish the two models at\nthe LHC run 2 is through final states with two different scalars. This\nconclusion builds a strong case for searches for final states with two\ndifferent scalars at the LHC run 2. Finally, we propose a set of benchmark\npoints for the real and complex singlet extensions to be tested at the LHC run\n2. They have been chosen such that the discovery prospects of the involved\nscalars are maximised and they fulfil the dark matter constraints. Furthermore,\nfor some of the points the theory is stable up to high energy scales. For the\ncomputation of the decay widths and branching ratios we developed the Fortran\ncode, sHDECAY, which is based on the implementation of the real and complex\nsinglet extensions of the SM in HDECAY.\n", "  We study the conditions when mixtures of entangled pure states with maximally\nmixed one-qudit reduced density matrices remain entangled. We found that the\nresulting mixed state remains entangled when the number of entangled pure\nstates to be mixed is less than or equal to the dimension of the pure states.\nFor the latter case of mixing a number of pure states equal to their dimension,\nwe found that the mixed state is entangled provided that the entangled pure\nstates to be mixed are not equally weighted. We also found that one can\nrestrict the set of pure states that one can mix from in order to ensure that\nthe resulting mixed state is genuinely entangled.\n", "  The exponential family of random graphs has been a topic of continued\nresearch interest. Despite the relative simplicity, these models capture a\nvariety of interesting features displayed by large-scale networks and allow us\nto better understand how phases transition between one another as tuning\nparameters vary. As the parameters cross certain lines, the model\nasymptotically transitions from a very sparse graph to a very dense graph,\ncompletely skipping all intermediate structures. We delve deeper into this near\ndegenerate tendency and give an explicit characterization of the asymptotic\ngraph structure as a function of the parameters.\n", "  Student learning in instructional physics labs represents a growing area of\nresearch that includes investigations of students' beliefs and expectations\nabout the nature of experimental physics. To directly probe students'\nepistemologies about experimental physics and support broader lab\ntransformation efforts at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) and\nelsewhere, we developed the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey\nfor Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Previous work with this assessment has\nincluded establishing the accuracy and clarity of the instrument through\nstudent interviews and preliminary testing. Several years of data collection at\nmultiple institutions has resulted in a growing national data set of student\nresponses. Here, we report on results of the analysis of these data to\ninvestigate the statistical validity and reliability of the E-CLASS as a\nmeasure of students' epistemologies for a broad student population. We find\nthat the E-CLASS demonstrates an acceptable level of both validity and\nreliability on measures of, item and test discrimination, test-retest\nreliability, partial-sample reliability, internal consistency, concurrent\nvalidity, and convergent validity. We also examine students' responses using\nPrincipal Component Analysis and find that, as expected, the E-CLASS does not\nexhibit strong factors.\n", "  The study of transfer-induced gamma-decay probabilities is very useful for\nunderstanding the surrogate-reaction method and, more generally, for\nconstraining statistical-model calculations. One of the main difficulties in\nthe measurement of gamma-decay probabilities is the determination of the\ngamma-cascade detection efficiency. In [Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 700, 59 (2013)]\nwe developed the Extrapolated Efficiency Method (EXEM), a new method to measure\nthis quantity. In this work, we have applied, for the first time, the EXEM to\ninfer the gamma-cascade detection efficiency in the actinide region. In\nparticular, we have considered the 238U(d,p)239U and 238U(3He,d)239Np\nreactions. We have performed Hauser-Feshbach calculations to interpret our\nresults and to verify the hypothesis on which the EXEM is based. The\ndetermination of fission and gamma-decay probabilities of 239Np below the\nneutron separation energy allowed us to validate the EXEM.\n", "  We investigate the Einstein static universe (ESU) and the emergent universe\nscenario in the framework of Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz-like $F(R)$ gravity. We first\nperform a dynamical analysis in the phase space, and amongst others we show\nthat a spatially open universe filled with matter satisfying the strong energy\ncondition can exhibit a stable static phase. Additionally, we examine the\nbehavior of the scenario under scalar perturbations and extract the conditions\nunder which it is free of perturbative instabilities, showing that the obtained\nbackground ESU solutions are free of such instabilities. However, in order for\nthe Einstein static universe to give rise to the emergent universe scenario we\nneed to have an exotic matter sector that can lead the universe to depart from\nthe stable static state and enter into its usual expanding thermal history.\n", "  We show that the recently observed 750 GeV diphoton excess at LHC can be due\nto the decay of a $SU(2)_L$ singlet scalar particle having 3 units of charge\nunder gauged $B - L$ symmetry. Such a particle arises as an essential\ningredient of recently studied gauged $B -L$ extension of the Standard Model\nwith unconventional charge assignment for right handed neutrinos. Apart from\nbeing one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model, the model also\ncontains a dark matter candidate and Dirac neutrinos with naturally small\nmasses.\n", "  Energetic feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is likely to play an\nimportant role in the observed anti-hierarchical trend in the evolution of\ngalaxies, and yet the energy injected into the circumgalactic medium by this\nprocess is largely unknown. One promising approach to constrain this feedback\nis through measurements of CMB spectral distortions due to the thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, whose magnitude is directly proportional to\nthe energy input by AGN. Here we co-add South Pole Telescope SZ (SPT-SZ) survey\ndata around a large set of massive quiescent elliptical galaxies at z >= 0.5.\nWe use data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey and VISTA Hemisphere Survey to\ncreate a large catalog of galaxies split up into two redshift bins, with 3394\ngalaxies at 0.5 <= z <= 1.0 and 924 galaxies at 1.0 <= z <= 1.5, with typical\nstellar masses of 1.5 x 10^11 M_Sun. We then co-add the emission around these\ngalaxies, resulting in a measured tSZ signal at 2.2 sigma significance for the\nlower redshift bin and a contaminating signal at 1.1 sigma for the higher\nredshift bin. To remove contamination due to dust emission, we use SPT-SZ\nsource counts to model a contaminant source population in both the SPT-SZ bands\nand Planck high-frequency bands for a subset of 937 low-redshift galaxies and\n240 high-redshift galaxies. This increases our detection to 3.6 sigma for low\nredshifts and 0.9 sigma for high redshifts. We find the mean\nangularly-integrated Compton-y values to be 2.2 (-0.7+0.9) x 10^-7 Mpc^2 for\nlow redshifts and 1.7 (-1.8+2.2) x 10^-7 Mpc^2 for high redshifts,\ncorresponding to total thermal energies of 7.6 (-2.3+3.0) x 10^60 ergs and 6.0\n(-6.3+7.7) x 10^60 ergs, respectively. These numbers are higher than expected\nfrom simple theoretical models that do not include AGN feedback, and serve as\nconstraints that can be applied to current simulations of massive galaxy\nformation. (abridged)\n", "  A Josephson junction made of a generic magnetic material sandwiched between\ntwo conventional superconductors is studied in the ballistic semi-classic\nlimit. The spectrum of Andreev bound states is obtained from the\nsingle-valuedness of a particle-hole spinor over closed orbits generated by\nelectron-hole reflections at the interfaces between superconducting and normal\nmaterials. The semiclassical quantization condition is shown to depend only on\nthe angle mismatch between initial and final spin directions along such closed\ntrajectories. For the demonstration, an Andreev-Wilson loop in the composite\nposition/particle-hole/spin space is constructed, and shown to depend on only\ntwo parameters, namely a magnetic phase shift and a local precession axis for\nthe spin. The details of the Andreev-Wilson loop can be extracted via measuring\nthe spin-resolved density of states. A Josephson junction can thus be viewed as\nan analog computer of closed-path-ordered exponentials.\n", "  We measured the optical reflectivity of [001]-oriented $n$-doped\nCd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ in a broad frequency range (50 - 22000 cm$^{-1}$) for\ntemperatures from 10 to 300 K. The optical conductivity, $\\sigma(\\omega) =\n\\sigma_{1}(\\omega) + {\\rm i}\\sigma_{2}(\\omega)$, is isotropic within the (001)\nplane; its real part follows a power law, $\\sigma_{1}(\\omega) \\propto\n\\omega^{1.65}$, in a large interval from 2000 to 8000 cm$^{-1}$. This behavior\nis caused by interband transitions between two Dirac bands, which are\neffectively described by a sublinear dispersion relation, $E(k) \\propto \\lvert\nk \\rvert ^{0.6}$. The momentum-averaged Fermi velocity of the carriers in these\nbands is energy dependent and ranges from $1.2 \\times 10^{5}$ to $3 \\times\n10^{5}$ m/s, depending on the distance from the Dirac points. We detect a\ngaplike feature in $\\sigma_{1}(\\omega)$ and associate it with the Fermi level\npositioned around $100$ meV above the Dirac points.\n", "  The weak coupling asymptotics, to order $(c/\\rho)^2$, of the ground state\nenergy of the delta-function Bose gasmis derived. Here $2c\\ge 0$ is the\ndelta-function potential amplitude and $\\rho$ the density of the gas in the\nthermodynamic limit. The analysis uses the electrostatic interpretation of the\nLieb-Liniger integral equation.\n", "  Realizing new classes of ground states in strongly correlated electron\nsystems continues to be at the forefront of condensed matter physics.\nHeavy-fermion materials, whose electronic structure is essentially\nthree-dimensional, are one of the most suitable systems for obtaining novel\nelectronic states because they demonstrate many fascinating properties.\nRecently, a state-of-the-art MBE technique has been developed to reduce the\ndimensionality of the heavy electrons by fabricating heavy fermion\nsuperlattices, which can produce new electronic states present in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) heavy fermion system. In superlattices of\nantiferromagnetic heavy fermion CeIn3 and conventional metal LaIn3, the\nmagnetic order is suppressed by reducing the thickness of the CeIn3 layers. The\n2D confinement of heavy fermion also leads to the enhancement of the effective\nmass and the deviation from the Fermi liquid properties, which are associated\nwith the dimensional tuning of quantum criticality. In superconducting\nsuperlattices of heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 and nonmagnetic metal\nYbCoIn5, superconductivity is realized even at one-unit-cell-thick layer of\nCeCoIn5. The thickness reduction of the CeCoIn5 layers drastically changes the\ntemperature and angular dependencies of the upper critical field. This result\nwould be attributed to a suppression of the Pauli pair-breaking effect through\nthe local inversion symmetry breaking (ISB) at the interfaces of CeCoIn5 block\nlayers. The importance of the ISB in this system has also been supported by\nsite-selective nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, recent\nexperiment of CeCoIn5/YbCoIn5 superlattices have shown that the degree of the\nISB are controllable, which offers the prospect of achieving even more\nfascinating superconducting states. These Kondo superlattices, thus, pave the\nway for exploring unusual metallic and superconducting states.\n", "  We study the global structure of some exact scalar hairy dynamical black\nholes which were constructed in Einstein gravity either minimally or\nnon-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We find that both the apparent horizon\nand the local event horizon (measured in luminosity coordinate) monotonically\nincrease with the advanced time as well as the Vaidya mass. At late advanced\ntimes, the apparent horizon approaches the event horizon and gradually becomes\nfuture outer. Correspondingly, the space-time arrives at stationary black hole\nstates with the relaxation time inversely proportional to the $1/(n-1)$ power\nof the final black hole mass, where $n$ is the space-time dimension. These\nresults strongly support the solutions describing the formation of black holes\nwith scalar hair. We also obtain new charged dynamical solutions in the\nnon-minimal theory by introducing an Maxwell field which is non-minimally\ncoupled to the scalar.\n  The presence of the electric charge strongly modifies the dynamical evolution\nof the space-time.\n", "  We investigate the optical conductivity of Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$RuO$_3$ across the\nferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition that occurs at $x=0.8$. The thin films\nwere grown by metalorganic aerosol deposition with $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ onto\nNdGaO$_3$ substrates. We performed THz frequency domain spectroscopy in a\nfrequency range from 3~cm$^{-1}$ to 40~cm$^{-1}$ (100~GHz to 1.4~THz) and at\ntemperatures ranging from 5~K to 300~K, measuring transmittivity and phase\nshift through the films. From this we obtained real and imaginary parts of the\noptical conductivity. The end-members, ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic\nCaRuO$_3$, show a strongly frequency-dependent metallic response at\ntemperatures below 20~K. Due to the high quality of these samples we can access\npronounced intrinsic electronic contributions to the optical scattering rate,\nwhich at 1.4~THz exceeds the residual scattering rate by more than a factor of\nthree. Deviations from a Drude response start at about 0.7~THz for both\nend-members in a remarkably similar way. For the intermediate members a higher\nresidual scattering originating in the compositional disorder leads to a\nfeatureless optical response, instead. The relevance of low-lying interband\ntransitions is addressed by a calculation of the optical conductivity within\ndensity functional theory in the local density approximation (LDA).\n", "  A general mathematical method is presented for the systematic construction of\ncoupled map lattices (CMLs) out of deterministic cellular automata (CAs). The\nentire CA rule space is addressed by means of a universal map for CAs that we\nhave recently derived and that is not dependent on any freely adjustable\nparameters. The CMLs thus constructed are termed real-valued deterministic\ncellular automata (RDCA) and encompass all deterministic CAs in rule space in\nthe asymptotic limit $\\kappa \\to 0$ of a continuous parameter $\\kappa$. Thus,\nRDCAs generalize CAs in such a way that they constitute CMLs when $\\kappa$ is\nfinite and nonvanishing. In the limit $\\kappa \\to \\infty$ all RDCAs are shown\nto exhibit a global homogeneous fixed-point that attracts all initial\nconditions. A new bifurcation is discovered for RDCAs and its location is\nexactly determined from the linear stability analysis of the global quiescent\nstate. In this bifurcation, fuzziness gradually begins to intrude in a purely\ndeterministic CA-like dynamics. The mathematical method presented allows to get\ninsight in some highly nontrivial behavior found after the bifurcation.\n", "  The physics of Josephson tunnel junctions drastically depends on their\ngeometrical configurations and here we show that also tiny geometrical details\nplay a determinant role. More specifically, we develop the theory of short and\nlong confocal annular Josephson tunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane\nmagnetic field of arbitrary orientations. The behavior of a circular annular\nJosephson tunnel junction is then seen to be simply a special case of the above\nresult. For junctions having a normalized perimeter less than one the threshold\ncurves are derived and computed even in the case with trapped Josephson\nvortices. For longer junctions a numerical analysis is carried out after the\nderivation of the appropriate motion equation for the Josephson phase. We found\nthat the system is modeled by a modified and perturbed sine-Gordon equation\nwith a space dependent effective Josephson penetration length inversely\nproportional to the local junction width. Both the fluxon statics and dynamics\nare deeply affected by the non-uniform annulus width. Static zero-field\nmultiple-fluxon solutions exist even in presence of a large bias current. The\ntangential velocity of a traveling fluxon is not determined by the balance\nbetween the driving and drag forces due to the dissipative losses. Furthermore,\nthe fluxon motion is characterized by a strong radial inward acceleration which\ncauses electromagnetic radiation concentrated at the ellipse equatorial points.\n", "  We investigate electrical transport in a three-dimensional massless Dirac\nfermion model that describes a Dirac semimetal state realized in topological\nmaterials. We derive a set of interdependent diffusion equations with eight\nlocal degrees of freedom, including the electric charge density and the spin\ndensity, that respond to an external electric field. By solving the diffusion\nequations for a system with a boundary, we demonstrate that a spin Hall effect\nwith spin accumulation occurs even though the conventional spin current\noperator is zero. The Noether current associated with chiral symmetry, known as\nthe axial current, is also discussed. We demonstrate that the axial current\nflows near the boundary and that it is perpendicular to the electric current.\n", "  We mainly study real Klein-Gordon theory on Anti de Sitter spacetimes, and\napply the General Boundary Formulation (GBF) of Quantum Theory in order to\ncompute a radial S-matrix. We consider first the classical theory, giving a\ncomplete list of Klein-Gordon solutions and the actions of the isometries of\nAdS on them. We study two symplectic structures on spaces of such solutions,\nand show that they are invariant under all isometries' actions. We also\ncalculate the flat limits of the involved quantities, and find that it\nreproduces the respective counterparts of the theory on Minkowski spacetime. We\nproceed applying Holomorphic Quantization, whose amplitudes are determined by\nan inner product which is induced by the symplectic structure together with a\ncomplex structure on the space of classical solutions. We construct this\ncomplex structure such that the inner product becomes positive-definite, and\nits induced amplitudes are invariant under time-translations and spatial\nrotations. Further, our complex structure makes these radial amplitudes agree\nwith the amplitudes of states on equal-time hypersurfaces, and also reproduce\nthe amplitudes of the theory on Minkowski spacetime in the flat limit. (There\nis also a more detailed summary at the beginning of the document.)\n", "  We have studied by muon spin resonance ({\\mu}SR) the helical ground state and\nfluctuating chiral phase recently observed in the MnGe chiral magnet. At low\ntemperature, the muon polarization shows double period oscillations at short\ntime scales. Their analysis, akin to that recently developed for MnSi [A. Amato\net al., Phys. Rev. B 89, 184425 (2014)], provides an estimation of the field\ndistribution induced by the Mn helical order at the muon site. The refined muon\nposition agrees nicely with ab initio calculations. With increasing\ntemperature, an inhomogeneous fluctuating chiral phase sets in, characterized\nby two well separated frequency ranges which coexist in the sample. Rapid and\nslow fluctuations, respectively associated with short range and long range\nordered helices, coexist in a large temperature range below T$_{N}$ = 170 K. We\ndiscuss the results with respect to MnSi, taking the short helical period,\nmetastable quenched state and peculiar band structure of MnGe into account.\n", "  We describe the design of a 20-liter test stand constructed to study\nfundamental properties of liquid argon (LAr). This system utilizes a simple,\ncost-effective gas argon (GAr) purification to achieve high purity, which is\nnecessary to study electron transport properties in LAr. An electron drift\nstack with up to 25 cm length is constructed to study electron drift,\ndiffusion, and attachment at various electric fields. A gold photocathode and a\npulsed laser are used as a bright electron source. The operational performance\nof this system is reported.\n", "  We study the DC conductivity of a weakly disordered 2D electron gas with two\nbands and spectral nodes, employing the field theoretical version of the\nKubo--Greenwood conductivity formula. Disorder scattering is treated within the\nstandard perturbation theory by summing up ladder and maximally crossed\ndiagrams. The emergent gapless (diffusion) modes determine the behavior of the\nconductivity on large scales. We find a finite conductivity with an\nintermediate logarithmic finite-size scaling towards smaller conductivities but\ndo not obtain the logarithmically divergence of the weak-localization approach.\nOur results agree with the experimentally observed logarithmic scaling of the\nconductivity in graphene with the formation of a plateau near $e^2/\\pi h$.\n", "  We present an improved version of a light curve model, which is able to\nestimate the physical properties of different types of core-collapse supernovae\nhaving double-peaked light curves, in a quick and efficient way. The model is\nbased on a two-component configuration consisting of a dense, inner region and\nan extended, low-mass envelope. Using this configuration, we estimate the\ninitial parameters of the progenitor via fitting the shape of the\nquasi-bolometric light curves of 10 SNe, including Type IIP and IIb events,\nwith model light curves. In each case we compare the fitting results with\navailable hydrodynamic calculations, and also match the derived expansion\nvelocities with the observed ones. Furthermore, we also compare our\ncalculations with hydrodynamic models derived by the SNEC code, and examine the\nuncertainties of the estimated physical parameters caused by the assumption of\nconstant opacity and the inaccurate knowledge of the moment of explosion.\n", "  The geodesic-light-cone (GLC) coordinates are a useful tool to analyse light\npropagation and observations in cosmological models. In this article, we\npropose a detailed, pedagogical, and rigorous introduction to this coordinate\nsystem, explore its gauge degrees of freedom, and emphasize its interest when\ngeometric optics is at stake. We then apply the GLC formalism to the\nhomogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi I cosmology. More than a simple\nillustration, this application (i) allows us to show that the Weinberg\nconjecture according to which gravitational lensing does not affect the proper\narea of constant-redshift surfaces is significantly violated in a globally\nanisotropic universe; and (ii) offers a glimpse into new ways to constrain\ncosmic isotropy from the Hubble diagram.\n", "  The premise of this note is the following observation: the formalism of\nBohrification is a natural place for the interpretation of general\nnon-signalling theories. We demonstrate it through an analysis of so-called\nbox-worlds, a popular framework for the discussion of systems exhibiting\nsuper-quantum correlations. In particular, we show that non-signalling\nbox-world states are precisely the internal probability valuations on an\ninternal frame in a Kripke topos naturally associated with a given box world.\n", "  We present an off-lattice statistical model of a single polymer chain in\nmixed solvent media. Taking into account a polymer conformational entropy,\nrenormalization of solvent composition near the polymer backbone, the universal\nintermolecular excluded volume and Van-der-Waals interactions within the\nself-consistent field theory the reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition\n(co-nonsolvency) has been described in this paper. For convenience we split the\nsystem volume in two parts: the volume occupied by the polymer chain and the\nvolume of bulk solution. Considering the equilibrium between two sub-volumes,\nthe polymer solvation free energy as a function of radius of gyration and\nco-solvent mole fraction within internal polymer volume has been obtained.\nMinimizing the free energy of solvation with respect to its arguments, we show\ntwo qulitatively different regimes of co-nonsolvency. Namely, at sufficiently\nhigh temperature a reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition proceeds\nsmoothly. On the contrary, when the temperature drops below a certain threshold\nvalue a coil-globule transition occurs in the regime of first-order phase\ntransition, i.e., discontinuous changes of the radius of gyration and the local\nco-solvent mole fraction near the polymer backbone. We show that, when the\ncollapse of polymer chain takes place, the entropy and enthalpy contributions\nto the solvation free energy of globule strongly grow. From the first\nprinciples of statistical thermodynamics we confirm earlier speculations based\non the MD simulations results that the co-nonsolvency is the essentially\nenthalpic-entropic effect and caused by enthalpy-entropy compensation. We show\nthat the temperature dependences of solution heat capacity change due to the\nsolvation of polymer chain are in qualitative agreement with the Differential\nscanning calorimetry data for PNIPAM in aqueous methanol.\n", "  Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key\ncryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for\nquantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on\nsecret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider\nattacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic\nprimitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a\nlot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless\npossible to build secure cryptosystems in it.\n  We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the\nsimplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric\ncryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we\nshow that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be\ndramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires\n$\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen\nwith some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the\nquantum model.\n  We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most\nwidely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption\ne.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security\nmodel. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ,\nCOPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the\nsituation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are\nsecure with a quantum-secure PRF.\n  Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks,\nleading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis\ntechnique in the quantum model.\n", "  We propose a new quantity which describes the confinement-deconfinement\ntransition based on topological properties of QCD. The quantity which we call\nthe quark number holonomy is defined as the integral of the quark number\nsusceptibility along the closed loop of $\\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the\ndimensionless imaginary chemical potential. Expected behavior of the quark\nnumber holonomy at finite temperature is discussed and its asymptotic behaviors\nare shown.\n", "  Magnetic nanoparticles (MnPs) are relevant to a wide range of applications\nincluding high density information storage and magnetic resonance imaging to\nname but a few. Among the materials available to prepare MnPs, FePt is\nattracting growing attention. However, to harvest the strongest magnetic\nproperties of FePt MnPs, a thermal annealing is often required to convert\nface-centered cubic as synthesized nPs into its tetragonal phase. Rarely\naddressed are the potential side effects of such treatments on the magnetic\nproperties. In this study, we focus on the impact of silica shells often used\nin strategies aiming at overcoming MnP coalescence during the thermal\nannealing. While we show that this shell does prevent sintering, and that\nfcc-to-fct conversion does occur, we also reveal the formation of silicide,\nwhich can prevent the stronger magnetic properties of fct-FePt MnPs from being\nfully realised. This report therefore sheds lights on poorly investigated and\nunderstood interfacial phenomena occurring during the thermal annealing of MnPs\nand, by doing so, also highlights the benefits of developing new strategies to\navoid silicide formation.\n", "  We present results of an infrared study of the molecular cloud Lynds 1340,\nforming three groups of low and intermediate-mass stars. Our goals are to\nidentify and characterise the young stellar population of the cloud, study the\nrelationships between the properties of the cloud and the emergent stellar\ngroups, and integrate L1340 into the picture of the star-forming activity of\nour Galactic environment. We selected candidate young stellar objects from the\nSpitzer and WISE data bases using various published color criteria, and\nclassified them based on the slope of the spectral energy distribution. We\nidentified 170 Class II, 27 Flat SED, and Class 0/I sources. High angular\nresolution near-infrared observations of the RNO 7 cluster, embedded in L1340,\nrevealed eight new young stars of near-infrared excess. The surface density\ndistribution of young stellar objects shows three groups, associated with the\nthree major molecular clumps of L1340, each consisting of less than 100\nmembers, including both pre-main sequence stars and embedded protostars. New\nHerbig--Haro objects were identified in the Spitzer images. Our results\ndemonstrate that L1340 is a prolific star-forming region of our Galactic\nenvironment in which several specific properties of the intermediate-mass mode\nof star formation can be studied in detail.\n", "  We have performed an optical spectroscopic and photometric search for young\nstellar objects associated with the molecular cloud Lynds 1340, and examined\nthe structure of the cloud by constructing an extinction map, based on SDSS\ndata. The new extinction map suggests a shallow, strongly fragmented cloud,\nhaving a mass of some 3700~Msun. Longslit spectroscopic observations of the\nbrightest stars over the area of L1340 revealed that the most massive star\nassociated with L1340 is a B4 type, about 5 solar mass star. The new\nspectroscopic and photometric data of the intermediate mass members led to a\nrevised distance of 825 (+110 /-80) pc, and revealed seven members of the young\nstellar population with M > 2 solar masses. Our search for H alpha emission\nline stars, conducted with the Wide Field Grism Spectrograph 2 on the 2.2-meter\ntelescope of the University of Hawaii and covering a 30 arcmin x 40 arcmin\narea, resulted in the detection of 75 candidate low-mass pre-main sequence\nstars, 58 of which are new. We constructed spectral energy distributions of our\ntarget stars, based on SDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer, and WISE photometric data, derived\ntheir spectral types, extinctions, and luminosities from BVRIJ fluxes,\nestimated masses by means of pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and\nexamined the disk properties utilizing the 2-24 micron interval of the spectral\nenergy distribution. We measured the equivalent width of the H alpha lines and\nderived accretion rates. The optically selected sample of pre-main sequence\nstars has a median effective temperature of 3970 K, stellar mass 0.7 Msun, and\naccretion rate of 7.6 10^{-9} Msun/yr.\n", "  We explore the scale-dependence and correlations of jet substructure\nobservables to improve upon existing techniques in the identification of highly\nLorentz-boosted objects. Modified observables are designed to remove\ncorrelations from existing theoretically well-understood observables, providing\npractical advantages for experimental measurements and searches for new\nphenomena. We study such observables in $W$ jet tagging and provide\nrecommendations for observables based on considerations beyond signal and\nbackground efficiencies.\n", "  21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations promise to transform our\nunderstanding of galaxy formation, but these observations are impossible\nwithout unprecedented levels of instrument calibration. We present end-to-end\nsimulations of a full EoR power spectrum analysis including all of the major\ncomponents of a real data processing pipeline: models of astrophysical\nforegrounds and EoR signal, frequency-dependent instrument effects, sky-based\nantenna calibration, and the full PS analysis. This study reveals that\ntraditional sky-based per-frequency antenna calibration can only be implemented\nin EoR measurement analyses if the calibration model is unrealistically\naccurate. For reasonable levels of catalog completeness, the calibration\nintroduces contamination in otherwise foreground-free power spectrum modes,\nprecluding a PS measurement. We explore the origin of this contamination and\npotential mitigation techniques. We show that there is a strong joint\nconstraint on the precision of the calibration catalog and the inherent\nspectral smoothness of antennae, and that this has significant implications for\nthe instrumental design of the SKA and other future EoR observatories.\n", "  We report the results of a study aimed at quantifying the impact on the\noscillation analysis of the uncertainties associated with the description of\nthe neutrino-nucleus cross section in the two-particle--two-hole sector. The\nresults of our calculations, based on the kinematic method of energy\nreconstruction and carried out comparing two data-driven approaches, show that\nthe existing discrepancies in the neutrino cross sections have a sizable effect\non the extracted oscillation parameters, particularly in the antineutrino\nchannel.\n", "  We propose a tight-binding model to investigate electronic transport\nproperties of single helical protein molecules incorporating both the helical\nsymmetry and the possibility of multiple charge transfer pathways. Our study\nreveals that due to existence of both the multiple charge transfer pathways and\nhelical symmetry, the transport properties are quite rigid under influence of\nenvi- ronmental fluctuations which indicates that these biomolecules can serve\nas better alternatives in nanoelectronic devices than its other biological\ncounterparts e.g., single-stranded DNA.\n", "  The extent of hydrogen coverage of the Si(001)c(4x2) surface in the presence\nof hydrogen gas has been studied with dispersion corrected density functional\ntheory. Electronic energy contributions are well described using a hybrid\nfunctional. The temperature dependence of the coverage in thermodynamic\nequilibrium was studied computing the phonon spectrum in a supercell approach.\nAs an approximation to these demanding computations, an interpolated phonon\napproach was found to give comparable accuracy. The simpler ab initio\nthermodynamic approach is not accurate enough for the system studied, even if\ncorrections by the Einstein model for surface vibrations are considered. The\non-set of H2 desorption from the fully hydrogenated surface is predicted to\noccur at temperatures around 750 K. Strong changes in hydrogen coverage are\nfound between 1000 and 1200 K in good agreement with previous reflectance\nanisotropy spectroscopy experiments. These findings allow a rational choice for\nthe surface state in the computational treatment of chemical reactions under\ntypical metal organic vapor phase epitaxy conditions on Si(001).\n", "  Multiferroic materials have attracted great interests but are rare in nature.\nIn many transitional metal oxides, charge ordering and magnetic ordering\ncoexist, so that a method of engineering charge-ordered materials into\nferroelectric materials would lead to a large class of multiferroic materials.\nWe propose a strategy for designing new ferroelectric or even multiferroic\nmaterials by inserting a spacing layer into each two layers of charge-ordered\nmaterials and artificially making a superlattice. One example of the model\ndemonstrated here is the perovskite (LaFeO$_3$)$_2$/LaTiO$_3$ (111)\nsuperlattice, in which the LaTiO$_3$ layer acts as the donor and the spacing\nlayer, and the LaFeO$_3$ layer is half doped and performs charge ordering. The\ncollaboration of the charge ordering and the spacing layer breaks the space\ninversion symmetry, resulting in a large ferroelectric polarization. As the\ncharge ordering also leads to a ferrimagnetic structure, the\n(LaFeO$_3$)$_2$/LaTiO$_3$ is multiferroic. It is expected that this work can\nencourage the designing and experimentally implementation of a large class of\nmultiferroic structures with novel properties.\n", "  This paper reports the first example of the degradable ROMP thermosetting\nmaterials catalysed by bio-derived acids and cutinase from Thermobifida\ncellulosilytica (Thc_Cut1). The ROMP thermosetting materials are based on\nnorbornene dicarboximides containing acetal ester groups only in the crosslink\nmoiety. The insoluble cross-linked materials were subjected to acid-catalysed\nhydrolysis using bio-derived acetic and citric acids as well as enzymatic\ndegradation using Thc_Cut1, resulting in the materials becoming completely\nsoluble in dichloromethane. 1H NMR and rheological analysis performed on\nmaterials after acid-catalysed hydrolysis showed characteristics\nindistinguishable to that of the linear polymer analogues. These analyses\nconfirmed the cleavage of the crosslink moiety upon degradation with the main\nbackbone chains remaining intact. The glass transition temperatures of the\npolymer materials after acid-catalysed hydrolysis were the same of those\nobserved for the linear polymer analogue. TGA showed that the cross-linked\npolymers thermally stable to 150 {\\deg}C, beyond which showed weight losses due\nto the thermal cleavage of the acetal ester linkages.\n", "  In this paper, an extension of the classification of flipped SU(5)\nheterotic-string vacua from [1] with a variation of the SO(10) breaking\n$\\alpha$ basis vector is presented. A statistical sampling in the space of\n$2^{45}$ flipped SU(5) vacua is explored, where $10^{11}$ distinct GGSO\nprojection configurations are scanned in comparison to the $10^{12}$ GGSO\ndistinct coefficients scanned in the space of $2^{44}$ vacua in [1]. A JAVA\ncode, akin to the one used for the classification in [1], was implemented to\nexplore these. Results presented here indicate that no three generation\nexophobic vacua exist, which was also found to be the case in [1] as all odd\ngenerations were projected out. This paper will also study the details on the\ncomparison between the two classifications achieved and then reflect on future\ndirections in the quest for finding three generation exophobic flipped SU(5)\nheterotic-string models.\n", "  We investigate the role of short-ranged electron-electron interactions in a\nparadigmatic model of three dimensional topological insulators, using dynamical\nmean-field theory and focusing on non magnetically ordered solutions. The\nnon-interacting band-structure is controlled by a mass term M, whose value\ndiscriminates between three different insulating phases, a trivial band\ninsulator and two distinct topologically non-trivial phases. We characterize\nthe evolution of the transitions between the different phases as a function of\nthe local Coulomb repulsion U and find a remarkable dependence of the U -M\nphase diagram on the value of the local Hund's exchange coupling J. However,\nregardless the value of J, following the evolution of the topological\ntransition line between a trivial band insulator and a topological insulator,\nwe find a critical value of U separating a continuous transition from a\nfirst-order one. When the Hund's coupling is significant, a Mott insulator is\nstabilized at large U . In proximity of the Mott transition we observe the\nemergence of an anomalous \"Mott-like\" strong topological insulating state.\n", "  We report on gate hysteresis in resistance on high quality graphene/h-BN\ndevices. We observe a thermal activated hysteretic behavior in resistance as a\nfunction of the applied gate voltage at temperatures above 375K. In order to\ninvestigate the origin of the hysteretic phenomenon, we design heterostructures\ninvolving graphene/h-BN devices with different underlying substrates such as:\nSiO2/Si and graphite; where heavily doped silicon and graphite are used as a\nback gate electrodes, respectively. The gate hysteretic behavior of the\nresistance shows to be present only in devices with an h-BN/SiO2 interface and\nis dependent on the orientation of the applied gate electric field and sweep\nrate. Finally, we suggest a phenomenological model, which captures all of our\nfindings based on charges trapped at the h-BN/SiO2. Certainly, such hysteretic\nbehavior in graphene resistance represents a technological problem for the\napplication of graphene devices at high temperatures, but conversely, it can\nopen new routes for applications on digital electronics and graphene memory\ndevices.\n", "  Considering the quantum dynamics of 2DEG exposed to both a stationary\nmagnetic field and an intense high-frequency electromagnetic wave, we found\nthat the wave decreases the scattering-induced broadening of Landau levels.\nTherefore, various magnetoelectronic properties of two-dimensional\nnanostructures (density of electronic states at Landau levels,\nmagnetotransport, etc) are sensitive to the irradiation by light. Thus, the\nelaborated theory paves a way to optical controlling magnetic properties of\n2DEG.\n", "  We present an open geometry Fourier modal method based on a new combination\nof open boundary conditions and an efficient $k$-space discretization. The open\nboundary of the computational domain is obtained using basis functions that\nexpand the whole space, and the integrals subsequently appearing due to the\ncontinuous nature of the radiation modes are handled using a discretization\nbased on non-uniform sampling of the $k$-space. We apply the method to a\nvariety of photonic structures and demonstrate that our method leads to\nsignificantly improved convergence with respect to the number of degrees of\nfreedom, which may pave the way for more accurate and efficient modeling of\nopen nanophotonic structures.\n", "  We discuss the soundness of inflationary scenarios in theories beyond the\nStarobinsky model, namely a class of theories described by arbitrary functions\nof the Ricci scalar and the K-essence field. We discuss the pathologies\nassociated with higher-order equations of motion which will be shown to\nconstrain the stability of this class of theories. We provide a general\nframework to calculate the slow-roll parameters and the corresponding mappings\nto the theory parameters. For paradigmatic gravitational models within the\nclass of theories under consideration we illustrate the power of the\nPlanck/Bicep2 latest results to constrain such gravitational Lagrangians.\nFinally, bounds for potential deviations from Starobinsky-like inflation are\nderived.\n", "  The semiconducting two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides MX$_{2}$\nshow an abundance of one-dimensional metallic edges and grain boundaries.\nStandard techniques for calculating edge states typically model nanoribbons,\nand require the use of supercells. In this paper we formulate a Green$'$s\nfunction technique for calculating edge states of (semi-)infinite\ntwo-dimensional systems with a single well-defined edge or grain boundary. We\nexpress Green$'$s functions in terms of Bloch matrices, constructed from the\nsolutions of a quadratic eigenvalue equation. The technique can be applied to\nany localized basis representation of the Hamiltonian. Here we use it to\ncalculate edge states of MX$_{2}$ monolayers by means of tight-binding models.\nBesides the basic zigzag and armchair edges, we study edges with a more general\norientation, structurally modifed edges, and grain boundaries. A simple\nthree-band model captures an important part of the edge electronic structures.\nAn eleven-band model comprising all valence orbitals of the M and X atoms, is\nrequired to obtain all edge states with energies in the MX$_{2}$ band gap. Here\nstates of odd symmetry with respect to a mirror plane through the layer of M\natoms have a dangling-bond character, and tend to pin the Fermi level.\n", "  1ES 1011+496 $(z=0.212)$ was discovered in very high energy (VHE, E >100 GeV)\n$\\gamma$-rays with MAGIC in 2007. The absence of simultaneous data at lower\nenergies led to a rather incomplete characterization of the broadband spectral\nenergy distribution (SED). We study the source properties and the emission\nmechanisms, probing whether a simple one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)\nscenario is able to explain the observed broadband spectrum. We analyzed VHE to\nradio data from 2011 and 2012 collected by MAGIC, $Fermi$-LAT, $Swift$, KVA,\nOVRO, and Mets\\\"ahovi in addition to optical polarimetry data and radio maps\nfrom the Liverpool Telescope and MOJAVE. The VHE spectrum was fit with a simple\npower law with a photon index of $3.69\\pm0.22$ and a flux above 150 GeV of\n$(1.46\\pm0.16)\\times10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. 1ES 1011+496 was found to\nbe in a generally quiescent state at all observed wavelengths, showing only\nmoderate variability from radio to X-rays. A low degree of polarization of less\nthan 10% was measured in optical, while some bright features polarized up to\n60% were observed in the radio jet. A similar trend in the rotation of the\nelectric vector position angle was found in optical and radio. The radio maps\nindicated a superluminal motion of $1.8\\pm0.4\\,c$, which is the highest speed\nstatistically significantly measured so far in a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac.\nFor the first time, the high-energy bump in the broadband SED of 1ES 1011+496\ncould be fully characterized from 0.1 GeV to 1 TeV which permitted a more\nreliable interpretation within the one-zone SSC scenario. The polarimetry data\nsuggest that at least part of the optical emission has its origin in some of\nthe bright radio features, while the low polarization in optical might be due\nto the contribution of parts of the radio jet with different orientations of\nthe magnetic field to the optical emission.\n", "  A search for the decays of the $B_c^+$ meson to $p\\bar p\\pi^+$ is performed\nfor the first time using a data sample corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3.0 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$\ncollisions at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8$ TeV. No signal is found\nand an upper limit, at 95\\% confidence level, is set,\n$\\frac{f_c}{f_u}\\times\\mathcal{B}(B_c^+\\to p\\bar p\\pi^+)<3.6\\times10^{-8}$ in\nthe kinematic region $m(p\\bar p)<2.85\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^2$,\n$p_{\\rm T}(B)<20\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c$ and $2.0<y(B)<4.5$, where\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is the branching fraction and $f_c$ ($f_u$) is the fragmentation\nfraction of the $b$ quark into a $B_c^+$ ($B^+$) meson.\n", "  By combining the tetrahedron method with the cluster perturbation theory\n(CPT), we present an accurate method to numerically calculate the density of\nstates of interacting fermions without introducing the Lorentzian broadening\nparameter $\\eta$ or the numerical extrapolation of $\\eta \\to 0$. The method is\nconceptually based on the notion of the effective single-particle Hamiltonian\nwhich can be subtracted in the Lehmann representation of the single-particle\nGreen's function within the CPT. Indeed, we show the general correspondence\nbetween the self-energy and the effective single-particle Hamiltonian which\ndescribes exactly the single-particle excitation energies of interacting\nfermions. The detailed formalism is provided for two-dimensional multi-orbital\nsystems and a benchmark calculation is performed for the two-dimensional\nsingle-band Hubbard model. The method can be adapted straightforwardly to\nsymmetry broken states, three-dimensional systems, and finite-temperature\ncalculations.\n", "  The theoretical formulation and numerical evaluation of the vertex\ncorrections in multiorbital techniques of theories of electronic properties of\nrandom alloys are analyzed. It is shown that current approaches to static\ntransport properties within the so-called conserving approximations lead to the\ninversion of a singular matrix as a direct consequence of the Ward identity\nrelating the vertex corrections to one-particle self-energies. We propose a\nsimple removal of the singularity for quantities (operators) with vanishing\naverage values for electron states at the Fermi energy, such as the velocity or\nthe spin torque; the proposed scheme is worked out in details in the\nself-consistent Born approximation and the coherent potential approximation.\nApplications involve calculations of the residual resistivity for various\nrandom alloys, including spin-polarized and relativistic systems, treated on an\nab initio level, with particular attention paid to the role of different\nsymmetries (inversion of space and time).\n", "  Neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering provides a unique laboratory to study the\nquantum mechanical coherency effects in electroweak interactions, towards which\nseveral experimental programs are being actively pursued. We report results of\nour quantitative studies on the transitions towards decoherency. A parameter\n($\\alpha$) is identified to describe the degree of coherency, and its\nvariations with incoming neutrino energy, detector threshold and target nucleus\nare studied. The ranges of $\\alpha$ which can be probed with realistic neutrino\nexperiments are derived, indicating complementarity between projects with\ndifferent sources and targets. Uncertainties in nuclear physics and in $\\alpha$\nwould constrain sensitivities in probing physics beyond the standard model. The\nmaximum neutrino energies corresponding to $\\alpha$>0.95 are derived.\n", "  Stimulated by recent studies of superconductivity and magnetism with local\nand global broken inversion symmetry, we investigate the superconductivity in\nmagnetic multipole states in locally noncentrosymmetric metals. We consider a\none-dimensional zigzag chain with sublattice-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling and suppose three magnetic multipole orders: monopole order, dipole\norder, and quadrupole order. It is demonstrated that the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state, the pair-density wave (PDW) state, and the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state are stabilized by these multipole\norders, respectively. We show that the PDW state is a topological\nsuperconducting state specified by the nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ number and\nwinding number. The origin of the FFLO state without macroscopic magnetic\nmoment is attributed to the asymmetric band structure induced by the magnetic\nquadrupole order and spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We apply the higher-order tensor renormalization group to the lattice\nCP($N-1$) model in two dimensions. A tensor network representation of the\nCP($N-1$) model in the presence of the $\\theta$ term is derived. We confirm\nthat the numerical results of the CP(1) model without the $\\theta$ term using\nthis method are consistent with that of the O(3) model which is analyzed by the\nsame method in the region $\\beta \\gg 1$ and that obtained by the Monte Carlo\nsimulation in a wider range of $\\beta$. The numerical computation including the\n$\\theta$ term is left for future challenges.\n", "  We performed magnetic susceptibility and neutron powder diffraction\nexperiments on the ternary compound Pr5Ru3Al2. It belongs to the\nnoncentrosymmetric and nonmirrorsymmetric cubic I213 space group. The\npreviously reported ferromagnetic transition at 24 K was not detected in our\nimproved quality samples. Instead, magnetic ordering was observed in the DC\nmagnetic susceptibility at 3.8 K. Neutron powder diffraction further indicates\nthat an incommensurate magnetic structure is established below 3.8 K, with the\nmagnetic modulation vector (0.066, 0.066, 0.066) (r.l.u.). Using the magnetic\nrepresentation analysis, we propose the block helical structure as a candidate\nfor the incommensurate magnetic structure.\n", "  Orthogonal Mueller matrices can be considered either as corresponding to\nretarders or to generalized transformations of the polarization basis for the\nrepresentation of Stokes vectors, so that they constitute the only type of\nMueller matrices that preserve the degree of polarization and the intensity of\nany partially-polarized input Stokes vector. The physical quantities which\nremain invariant when a nondepolarizing Mueller matrix is transformed through\nits product by different types of orthogonal Mueller matrices are identified\nand interpreted, providing a better knowledge of the information contained in a\nnondepolarizing Mueller matrix.\n", "  We study the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect on the noncommutative space.\nBecause there is no net Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in the time-dependent case on\nthe commutative space, therefore, a tiny deviation from zero indicates new\nphysics. Based on the Seiberg-Witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and\nLorentz covariant Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative\nspace. We find there are two kinds of contribution: momentum-dependent and\nmomentum-independent corrections. For the momentum-dependent correction, there\nis a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts, just like the\ncase on the commutative space. However, there is a non-trivial contribution in\nthe momentum-independent correction. This is true for both the time-independent\nand time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effects on the noncommutative space. However,\nfor the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, there is no overwhelming\nbackground which exists in the time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect on both\ncommutative and noncommutative space. Therefore, the time-dependent\nAharonov-Bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity. \\draftnote{The\nnet correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through\nthe fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $\\theta$, and\nthrough the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle.} More\ninterestingly, there is an anti-collinear relation between the logarithms of\nthe magnetic field $B$ and the averaged flux $\\Phi/N$ (N is the number of\nfringes shifted). This nontrivial relation can also provide a way to test the\nspatial noncommutativity. For $B\\Phi/N\\sim 1$, our estimation on the\nexperimental sensitivity shows that it can reach the $\\rm 10GeV$ scale. This\nsensitivity can be enhanced by using stronger magnetic field strength, larger\nmagnetic flux, as well as higher experimental precision on the phase shift.\n", "  A submerged body subject to a sudden shape-change experiences large forces\ndue to the variation of added-mass energy. While this phenomenon has been\nstudied for single actuation events, application to sustained propulsion\nrequires studying \\textit{periodic} shape-change. We do so in this work by\ninvestigating a spring-mass oscillator submerged in quiescent fluid subject to\nperiodic changes in its volume. We develop an analytical model to investigate\nthe relationship between added-mass variation and viscous damping and\ndemonstrate its range of application with fully coupled fluid-solid\nNavier-Stokes simulations at large Stokes number. Our results demonstrate that\nthe recovery of added-mass kinetic energy can be used to completely cancel the\nviscous damping of the fluid, driving the onset of sustained oscillations with\namplitudes as large as four times the average body radius $r_0$. A quasi-linear\nrelationship is found to link the terminal amplitude of the oscillations $X$,\nto the extent of size change $a$, with $X/a$ peaking at values from 4 to 4.75\ndepending on the details of the shape-change kinematics. In addition, it is\nfound that pumping in the frequency range of\n$1-\\frac{a}{2r_0}<\\omega^2/\\omega_n^2<1+\\frac{a}{2r_0}$ is required for\nsustained oscillations. The results of this analysis shed light on the role of\nadded-mass recovery in the context of shape-changing bodies and\nbiologically-inspired underwater vehicles.\n", "  We investigate the one-loop entanglement entropy of two short intervals with\nsmall cross ratio $x$ on a complex plane in two-dimensional conformal field\ntheory (CFT) using operator product expansion of twist operators. We focus on\nthe one-loop entanglement entropy instead of the general order $n$ R\\'enyi\nentropy, and this makes the calculation much easier. We consider the\ncontributions of stress tensor to order $x^{10}$, contributions of $W_3$\noperator to order $x^{12}$, and contributions of $W_4$ operator to order\n$x^{14}$. The CFT results agree with the ones in gravity.\n", "  In this work, we consider wormhole geometries in third-order Lovelock gravity\nand investigate the possibility that these solutions satisfy the energy\nconditions. In this framework, by applying a specific equation of state, we\nobtain exact wormhole solutions, and by imposing suitable values for the\nparameters of the theory, we find that these geometries satisfy the weak energy\ncondition in the vicinity of the throat, due to the presence of higher order\ncurvature terms. Finally, we trace out a numerical analysis, by assuming a\nspecific redshift function, and find asymptotically flat solutions that satisfy\nthe weak energy condition throughout the spacetime.\n", "  The production of weak gauge bosons in association with heavy flavored mesons\nat the LHCb conditions is considered, and a detailed study of the different\ncontributing processes is presented including single (SPS) and double (DPS)\nparton scattering mechanisms. We find that the usual DPS factorization formula\nneeds to be corrected for the limited partonic phase space, and that including\nthe relevant corrections reduces discrepancies in the associated $ZD$\nproduction. We conclude finally that double parton scattering dominates the\nproduction of same-sign $W^\\pm D^\\pm$ states, as well as the production of\n$W^-$ bosons associated with $B$-mesons. The latter processes can thus be\nregarded as new useful DPS indicators.\n", "  With the aid of an improved short-range approximation, the bound state\nenergies and the scattering phase shifts for a Hulth\\'en- type potential plus\nYukawa potential are calculated within the framework of Nikiforov-Uvarov and\nstandard methods, respectively. Our numerical calculations show that the\npresence of Yukawa potential has a significant influence on bound state\nenergies and the wave number-dependent phase shifts for any arbitrary values of\nthe screening parameter {\\alpha} and angular momentum l.\n", "  We present velocity-resolved maps taken with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper\n(WHAM) in H{\\alpha}, [S II] {\\lambda}6716, and [N II] {\\lambda}6583 around the\nwell-known O8 III star {\\lambda} Ori A (HD 36861) (l = 185{\\deg} to 205{\\deg},\nb = -24{\\deg} to -1{\\deg}). The integrated intensity (v(LSR) = -80 to +80\nkm/s), I(H{\\alpha}), within WHAM's one-degree beams varies from ~ 190 R near\nthe center to ~ 10 R on the periphery of the nebula where it becomes comparable\nto foreground and/or background emission in this complex region. Intensity\nratios for [N II]/H{\\alpha} and [S II]/H{\\alpha} average 0.28 and 0.35,\nrespectively. In both ratios, higher values are found preferentially at larger\nradii from {\\lambda} Ori, although the behavior of [N II]/H{\\alpha} is\ncomplicated near the edges of the nebula. The [S II]/[N II] intensity ratio\nranges from ~ 0.5 to ~ 1.0, with the value increasing toward larger radii (and\nlower H{\\alpha} intensities). Variations of [S II]/H{\\alpha}, [N II]/H{\\alpha},\nand [S II]/[N II] line ratios in this diffuse region show some similar trends\nto those seen in the warm ionized medium (WIM) but with generally lower\nmetal-line ratios. As with the WIM, the trends are driven by changes in the\nunderlying physical parameters, most notably the ionization states and gas\ntemperature. We use these extremely high signal-to-noise observations to\nconstruct a map of temperature and non-thermal velocity throughout the nebula.\nUsing the line widths of H{\\alpha} and [S II], we separate thermal and\nnon-thermal components and find spatial trends of these parameters within the\nnebula.\n", "  We investigate the new special class of the finite string on a plane, after\nthe reduction from the relativistic $4D$ case. The suggested special form of\nthe phase space allows to define the extended Galilei group as a group of the\nspace - time symmetry for the considered system. The definition of the energy\nfor the studied non-relativistic string through the Cazimir function of this\ngroup is suggested. The concept of the effective mass for the investigated\ndynamical system is introduced. The appearance of strong correlations between\nthe degrees of freedom even on the classical level is discussed.\n", "  The development of novel functional materials in experimental labs combined\nwith computer-based compound simulation brings the vision of materials design\non a microscopic scale continuously closer to reality. For many applications\ninterface and surface phenomena rather than bulk properties are key. One of the\nmost fundamental qualities of a material-vacuum interface is the energy\nrequired to transfer an electron across this boundary, i.e. the work function.\nIt is a crucial parameter for numerous applications, including organic\nelectronics, field electron emitters, and thermionic energy converters. Being\ngenerally very resistant to degradation at high temperatures, transition metal\noxides present a promising materials class for such devices. We have performed\na systematic study for perovskite oxides that provides reference values and,\nequally important, reports on materials trends and the tunability of work\nfunctions. Our results identify and classify dependencies of the work function\non several parameters including specific surface termination, surface\nreconstructions, oxygen vacancies, and heterostructuring.\n", "  Two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of a recent encounter\nof the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) with an electron diffusion\nregion at the magnetopause are presented. While the two-dimensional simulation\nis laminar, turbulence develops at both the x-line and along the magnetic\nseparatrices in the three-dimensional simulation. The turbulence is strong\nenough to make the magnetic field around the reconnection island chaotic and\nproduces both anomalous resistivity and anomalous viscosity. Each contribute\nsignificantly to breaking the frozen-in condition in the electron diffusion\nregion. A surprise is that the crescent-shaped features in velocity space seen\nboth in MMS observations and in two-dimensional simulations survive, even in\nthe turbulent environment of the three-dimensional system. This suggests that\nMMS's measurements of crescent distributions do not exclude the possibility\nthat turbulence plays an important role in magnetopause reconnection.\n", "  There has been a huge increase of interests in two-dimensional van der Waals\nmaterials over the past ten years or so with the conspicuous absence of one\nparticular class of materials: magnetic van der Waals systems. In this\nViewpoint, we point it out and illustrate how we might be able to benefit from\nexploring these so-far neglected materials.\n", "  The performance characteristics of a heat rectifier and a heat pump are\nstudied in a non Markovian framework. The device is constructed from a molecule\nconnected to a hot and cold reservoir. The heat baths are modelled using the\nstochastic surrogate Hamiltonian method. The molecule is modelled by an\nasymmetric double-well potential. Each well is semi-locally connected to a heat\nbath composed of spins. The dynamics is driven by a combined system-bath\nHamiltonian. The temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath\ncomposed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium. A random swap operation\nexchange spins between the primary and secondary baths. The combined system is\nstudied in various system-bath coupling strengths. In all cases the average\nheat current always flows from the hot towards the cold bath in accordance to\nthe second law of thermodynamics. The asymmetry of the double well generates a\nrectifying effect meaning that when the left and right baths are exchanged the\nheat current follows the hot to cold direction. The heat current is larger when\nthe high frequency is coupled to the hot bath. Adding an external driving field\ncan reverse the transport direction. Such a refrigeration effect is modelled by\na periodic driving field in resonance with the frequency difference of the two\npotential wells. A minimal driving amplitude is required to overcome the heat\nleak effect. In the strong driving regime the cooling power is non-monotonic\nwith the system-bath coupling.\n", "  Mucociliary clearance in the lung is the primary defense mechanism that\nprotects the airways from inhaled toxicants and infectious agents. The system\nconsists of a viscoelastic mucus layer driven by motile cilia in a periciliary\nlayer underneath the mucus layer. Under healthy conditions, the thickness of\nthe periciliary layer is comparable to cilia length. Perturbations to this\nsystem, whether due to a genetic disorder or acquired causes, are directly\nlinked to infection and disease. For example, depletion of the periciliary\nlayer is typically observed in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease and cystic fibrosis. Clinical evidence connects the periciliary layer\ndepletion to reduced rates of mucus clearance. In this work, we develop a novel\ncomputational model to study mucociliary transport in a microfluidic channel\nconsisting of a mucus layer (viscoelastic fluid) atop a periciliary layer\n(nearly-viscous fluid). We systematically vary the viscoelastic properties and\nthickness of the mucus layer to emulate healthy and diseased conditions. We\nassess cilia performance in terms of three metrics: flow transport, internal\npower expended by the cilia, and transport efficiency. We find that, compared\nto a control case with no mucus, a healthy mucus layer enhances cilia\nperformance in all three metrics. That is to say, a healthy mucus layer not\nonly improves flow transport, resulting in better clearance of harmful\nsubstances, but it does so at an energetic advantage to the cilia. In healthy\nstates, an increase in the mucus elastic properties enhances transport\nefficiency. In contrast, under diseased conditions where the periciliary layer\nis depleted, mucus hinders transport... (trimmed by length restriction)\n", "  Gauge coupling unification is studied within the framework where there are\nextra Higgs doublets and $E_6$ exotic fields. Supersymmetric models and\nnonsupersymmetric models are investigated, and a catalog of models with gauge\ncoupling unification is presented.\n", "  We consider restrictions placed by geodesic completeness on spacetimes\npossessing a null parallel vector field, the so-called Brinkmann spacetimes.\nThis class of spacetimes includes important idealized gravitational wave models\nin General Relativity, namely the plane-fronted waves with parallel rays, or\npp-waves, which in turn have been intensely and fruitfully studied in the\nmathematical and physical literatures for over half a century. More concretely,\nwe prove a restricted version of a conjectural analogue for Brinkmann\nspacetimes of a rigidity result obtained by M.T. Anderson for stationary\nspacetimes. We also highlight its relation with a long-standing 1962 conjecture\nby Ehlers and Kundt. Indeed, it turns out that the subclass of Brinkmann\nspacetimes we consider in our main theorem is enough to settle an important\nspecial case of the Ehlers-Kundt conjecture in terms of the well known class of\nCahen-Wallach spaces.\n", "  The existence of critical points for the peculiar velocity field is a natural\nfeature of the correlated vector field. These points appear at the junctions of\nvelocity domains with different orientations of their averaged velocity\nvectors. Since peculiar velocities are the important cause of the scatter in\nthe Hubble expansion rate, we propose that a more precise determination of the\nHubble constant can be made by restricting analysis to a subsample of\nobservational data containing only the zones around the critical points of the\npeculiar velocity field, associated with voids and saddle points. On\nlarge-scales the critical points, where the first derivative of the\ngravitational potential vanishes, can easily be identified using the density\nfield and classified by the behavior of the Hessian of the gravitational\npotential. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions\nare stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions.\nFurthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially\nminimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of\nvanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging\nindiscriminately using the full data sets, as is the common approach.\n", "  Collective chaos is shown to emerge, via a period-doubling cascade, from\nquasiperiodic partial synchronization in a population of identical inhibitory\nneurons with delayed global coupling. This system is thoroughly investigated by\nmeans of an exact model of the macroscopic dynamics, valid in the thermodynamic\nlimit. The collective chaotic state is reproduced numerically with a finite\npopulation, and persists in the presence of weak heterogeneities. Finally, the\nrelationship of the model's dynamics with fast neuronal oscillations is\ndiscussed.\n", "  From the results of a comprehensive asteroid population evolution model, we\nconclude that the YORP-induced rotational fission hypothesis can be consistent\nwith the observed population statistics of small asteroids in the main belt\nincluding binaries and contact binaries. The foundation of this model is the\nasteroid rotation model of Marzari et al. (2011), which incorporates both the\nYORP effect and collisional evolution. This work adds to that model the\nrotational fission hypothesis and the binary evolution model of Jacobson &\nScheeres (2011). The asteroid population evolution model is highly constrained\nby these and other previous works, and therefore it has only two significant\nfree parameters: the ratio of low to high mass ratio binaries formed after\nrotational fission events and the mean strength of the binary YORP (BYORP)\neffect. We successfully reproduce characteristic statistics of the small\nasteroid population: the binary fraction, the fast binary fraction,\nsteady-state mass ratio fraction and the contact binary fraction. We find that\nin order for the model to best match observations, rotational fission produces\nhigh mass ratio ($> 0.2$) binary components with four to eight times the\nfrequency as low mass ratio ($< 0.2$) components, where the mass ratio is the\nmass of the secondary component divided by the mass of the primary component.\nThis is consistent with post-rotational fission binary system mass ratio being\ndrawn from either a flat or a positive and shallow distribution, since the high\nmass ratio bin is four times the size of the low mass ratio bin; this is in\ncontrast to the observed steady-state binary mass ratio, which has a negative\nand steep distribution. This can be understood in the context of the\nBYORP-tidal equilibrium hypothesis, which predicts that low mass ratio binaries\nsurvive for a significantly longer period of time than high mass ratio systems.\n", "  The quality of ground based astronomical observations are significantly\naffected by telluric conditions, and the search for best sites has led to the\nconstruction of observatories at remote locations, including recent initiatives\non the high plateaus of E Antarctica where the calm, dry and cloud free\nconditions during winter are recognized as amongst the best. Site selection is\nan important phase of any observatory development project, and candidate sites\nmust be tested with specialized equipment, a process both time consuming and\ncostly. A potential screening of site locations before embarking on field\ntesting is through the use of climate models. Here, we describe the application\nof the Polar version of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to the\npreliminary site suitability assessment of an unstudied region in W Antarctica.\nNumerical simulations with WRF were carried out for the winter of 2011 at 3 km\nand 1 km spatial resolution over a region centered on the Ellsworth mountain\nrange. Comparison with observations of surface wind speed and direction,\ntemperature and specific humidity at nine automatic weather stations indicate\nthat the model succeed in capturing the mean and time variability of these\nvariables. Credible features shown by the model include zones of high winds\nover the southernmost part of the Ellsworth Mntns, a deep thermal inversion\nover the Ronne-Fincher Ice Shelf and strong west to east moisture gradient\nacross the entire study area. Comparison of simulated cloud fraction with a\nspacebourne Lidar climatology indicates that the model may underestimate cloud\noccurrence, a problem that has been noted in previous studies. A simple scoring\nsystem was applied to reveal the most promising locations. The results of this\nstudy indicate that the WRF model is capable of providing useful guidance\nduring the initial site selection stage of project development.\n", "  Moir\\'e superlattices in graphene supported on various substrates have opened\na new avenue to engineer graphene's electronic properties. Yet, the exact\ncrystallographic structure on which their band structure depends remains highly\ndebated. In this scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory\nstudy, we have analysed graphene samples grown on multilayer graphene prepared\nonto SiC and on the close-packed surfaces of Re and Ir with ultra-high\nprecision. We resolve small-angle twists and shears in graphene, and identify\nlarge unit cells comprising more than 1,000 carbon atoms and exhibiting\nnon-trivial nanopatterns for moir\\'e superlattices, which are commensurate to\nthe graphene lattice. Finally, a general formalism applicable to any hexagonal\nmoir\\'e is presented to classify all reported structures.\n", "  The exceptionally long lifetime of surface nanobubbles remains one of the\nbiggest questions in the field. One of the proposed mechanisms for the\nstability is the \\emph{dynamic equilibrium} model, which describes a constant\nflux of gas in and out of the bubble. Here, we describe results from particle\ntracking experiments to measure this flow. The results are analysed by\nmeasuring the Vorono\\\"i cell size distribution, the diffusion, and speed of the\ntracer particles. We show that there is no detectable difference in the\nmovement of particles above nanobubble-laden surfaces, as compared to\nnanobubble-free surfaces.\n", "  The analogy between evaporating surface droplets in air to dissolving\nlong-chain alcohol droplets in water is worked out. We show that next to the\nthree known modi for surface droplet evaporation or dissolution (constant\ncontact angle mode, constant contact radius mode, and stick-slide mode), a\nfourth mode exists for small droplets on supposedly smooth substrates, namely\nthe stick-jump mode: intermittent contact line pinning causes the droplet to\nswitch between sticking and jumping during the dissolution. We present\nexperimental data and compare them to theory to predict the dissolution time in\nthis stick-jump mode. We also explain why these jumps were easily observed for\nmicroscale droplets but not for larger droplets.\n", "  Recent progresses in the description of glassy relaxation and ageing are\nreviewed for the wide class of network-forming materials such as $GeO_2$,\nGe$_x$Se$_{1-x}$, silicates (SiO$_2$-Na$_2$O) or borates (B$_2$O$_3$-Li$_2$O),\nall of them having an important usefulness in domestic, geological or\noptoelectronic applications. A brief introduction of the glass transition\nphenomenology is given, together with the salient features that are revealed\nboth from theory and experiments. Standard experimental methods used for the\ncharacterization of the slowing down of the dynamics are reviewed. We then\ndiscuss the important role played by aspect of network topology and rigidity\nfor the understanding of the relaxation of the glass transition, while also\npermitting analytical predictions of glass properties from simple and\ninsightful models based on the network structure. We also emphasize the great\nutility of computer simulations which probe the dynamics at the molecular\nlevel, and permit to calculate various structure-related functions in\nconnection with glassy relaxation and the physics of ageing which reveals the\noff-equilibrium nature of glasses. We discuss the notion of spatial variations\nof structure which leads to the picture of \"{\\em dynamic heterogeneities}\", and\nrecent results of this important topic for network glasses are also reviewed.\n", "  The primary attribute of interest of surface nanobubbles is their unusual\nstability and a number of theories trying to explain this have been put\nforward. Interestingly, the dissolution of nanobubbles is a topic that did not\nreceive a lot of attention yet. In this work we applied two different\nexperimental procedures which should cause gaseous nanobubbles to completely\ndissolve. In our experiments we nucleated nanobubble-like objects by putting a\ndrop of water on HOPG using a plastic syringe and disposable needle. In method\nA, the nanobubble-like objects were exposed to a flow of degassed water (1.17\nmg/l) for 96 hours. In method B, the ambient pressure was lowered in order to\ndegas the liquid and the nanobubble-like objects. Interestingly, the\nnanobubble-like objects remained stable after exposure to both methods. After\nthorough investigation of the procedures and materials used during our\nexperiments, we found that the nanobubble-like object were induced by the use\nof disposable needles in which PDMS contaminated the water. It is very\nimportant for the nanobubble community to be aware of the fact that, although\nfeatures look and behave like nanobubbles, in some cases they might in fact be\nor induced by contamination. The presence of contamination could also resolve\nsome inconsistencies found in the nanobubble literature.\n", "  In their recent study Neelam, Shubhchintak, and Chatterjee have claimed that\n\"it would certainly be useful to perform a Coulomb dissociation experiment to\nfind the low energy capture cross section for the reaction\"\n$^{15}$N(n,$\\gamma$)$^{16}$N. However, it is obvious that a Coulomb\ndissociation experiment cannot constrain this capture cross section because the\ndominating branchings of the capture reaction lead to excited states in\n$^{16}$N which do not contribute in a Coulomb dissociation experiment. An\nestimate of the total $^{15}$N(n,$\\gamma$)$^{16}$N cross section from Coulomb\ndissociation of $^{16}$N requires a precise knowledge of the $\\gamma$-ray\nbranchings in the capture reaction. Surprisingly, the calculation of Neelam,\nShubhchintak, and Chatterjee predicts a strongly energy-dependent ground state\nbranching of the order of 0.05\\% to 0.6\\% at energies between 100 and 500 keV\nwhich is almost 2 orders of magnitude below calculations in the direct capture\nmodel. Additionally, this calculation of Neelam, Shubhchintak, and Chatterjee\ndeviates significantly from the expected energy dependence for $p$-wave\ncapture.\n", "  Heavy flavor production is important in heavy ion collisions to study both\ncold and hot nuclear matter effects. The LHCb experiment can make unique\ncontribution to heavy ion physics, owing to the full particle identification of\nthe detector in the forward region and the ability to collect fixed target data\nwith proton or lead beams. This report describes recent results with\nproton-lead collision data collected in 2013 and the prospect of heavy-ion\nstudies at LHCb.\n", "  Continuous progress in data quality from HST, recent multiwavelength high\nresolution spectroscopy and high contrast imaging from ground adaptive optics\non large telescopes need modeling of R136 to understand its nature and\nevolutionary stage. To produce the best synthesized multiwavelength images of\nR136 we need to simulate the effect of dynamical and stellar evolution, mass\nsegregation and binary stars fraction on the survival of young massive clusters\nwith the initial parameters of R136 in the LMC, being set to the present\nknowledge of this famous cluster. We produced a series of 32 young massive\nclusters using the NBODY6 code. Each cluster was tracked with adequate temporal\nsamples to follow the evolution of R136 during its early stages. To compare the\nNBODY6 simulations with observational data, we created the synthetic images\nfrom the output of the code. We used the TLUSTY and KURUCZ model atmospheres to\nproduce the fluxes in HST/ WFPC2 filters. GENEVA isochrones were used to track\nthe evolution of stars. Then, we derived the observable parameters from\nsynthetic scenes at the spatial resolution of HST/WFPC2 in the F814W filter\n(790.48nm). Surface brightness profile of the cluster, half-light radius, mass\nfunction and neighbor radius were used to select the best representation of\nR136. We compared the simulations of R136 to its HST imagery by creating\nsynthetic scenes at the same resolution, pixel scale and FOV of the HST. We\napplied the same photometric analysis of the images as of the real ones. Having\nextracted the stellar sources, we estimated the mass-function, the surface\nbrightness profile, the half-light radius and the neighbor radius across R136.\nThe interpretation of these criteria point to the fact that an initially\nnon-segregated cluster scenario is more representative of R136. This result\npleads for the formation of massive stars by accretion instead of collision.\n", "  We demonstrate the quantum Talbot effect using pairs of single photons\nproduced by parametric down conversion. In contrast to the previous works, we\nuse a programmable spatial light modulator to behave as a diffraction grating.\nThus, the investigation of the Talbot diffraction patterns under the variation\nof grating structure can be easily performed. The influence of spectral\nbandwidth of the down-converted photons on the diffraction pattern is also\ninvestigated. A theoretical model based on the wave nature of photons is\npresented to explain the Talbot diffraction pattern under varying conditions.\nThe measured diffraction patterns are in good agreement with the theoretical\nprediction. We are convinced that our study improves the understanding of the\nquantum Talbot effect.\n", "  Accurate prediction of the macroscopic flow parameters needed to describe\nflow in porous media relies on a good knowledge of flow field distribution at a\nmuch smaller scale---in the pore spaces. The extent of the inertial effect in\nthe pore spaces can not be underestimated yet is often ignored in large-scale\nsimulations of fluid flow. We present a multiscale method for solving Oseen's\napproximation of incompressible flow in the pore spaces amid non-periodic grain\npatterns. The method is based on the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM\n[Hou and Wu, 1997]) and is built in the vein of Crouzeix-Raviart elements\n[Crouzeix and Raviart, 1973]. Simulations of inertial flow in highly\nnon-periodic settings are conducted and presented. Convergence studies in terms\nof numerical errors relative to the reference solution are given to demonstrate\nthe accuracy of our method. The weakly enforced continuity across coarse\nelement edges is shown to maintain accurate solutions in the vicinity of the\ngrains without the need for any oversampling methods. The penalization method\nis employed to allow a complicated grain pattern to be modeled using a simple\nCartesian mesh. This work is a stepping stone towards solving the more\ncomplicated Navier-Stokes equations with a non-linear inertial term.\n", "  We have examined an isovalent Rh substitution effect on the transport\nproperties of the thermoelectric oxide Ca$_3$Co$_{4}$O$_9$ using\nsingle-crystalline form. With increasing Rh content $x$, both the electrical\nresistivity and the Seebeck coefficient change systematically up to $x=0.6$ for\nCa$_3$Co$_{4-x}$Rh$_{x}$O$_9$ samples. In the Fermi-liquid regime where the\nresistivity behaves as $\\rho=\\rho_0+AT^2$ around 120 K, the $A$ value decreases\nwith increasing Rh content, indicating that the correlation effect is weakened\nby Rh $4d$ electrons with extended orbitals. We find that, in contrast to such\na weak correlation effect observed in the resistivity of Rh-substituted\nsamples, the low-temperature Seebeck coefficient is increased with increasing\nRh content, which is explained with a possible enhancement of a pseudogap\nassociated with the short-range order of spin density wave. In high-temperature\nrange above room temperature, we show that the resistivity is largely\nsuppressed by Rh substitution while the Seebeck coefficient becomes almost\ntemperature-independent, leading to a significant improvement of the power\nfactor in Rh-substituted samples. This result is also discussed in terms of the\ndifferences in the orbital size and the associated spin state between Co $3d$\nand Rh $4d$ electrons.\n", "  Biophysical force spectroscopy tools - for example optical tweezers, magnetic\ntweezers, atomic force microscopy, - have been used to study elastic,\nmechanical, conformational and dynamic properties of single biological\nspecimens from single proteins to whole cells to reveal information not\naccessible by ensemble average methods such as X-ray crystallography, mass\nspectroscopy, gel electrophoresis and so on. Here we review the application of\nthese tools on a range of infection-related questions from antibody-inhibited\nprotein processivity to virus-cell adhesion. In each case we focus on how the\ninstrumental design tailored to the biological system in question translates\ninto the functionality suitable for that particular study. The unique insights\nthat force spectroscopy has gained to complement knowledge learned through\npopulation averaging techniques in interrogating biomolecular details prove to\nbe instrumental in therapeutic innovations such as those in structure-based\ndrug design.\n", "  The SMC complex, MukBEF, is important for chromosome organization and\nsegregation in Escherichia coli. Fluorescently tagged MukBEF forms distinct\nspots (or 'foci') in the cell, where it is thought to carry out most of its\nchromosome associated activities. This chapter outlines the technique of\nFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) as a method to study the\nproperties of YFP-tagged MukB in fluorescent foci. This method can provide\nimportant insight into the dynamics of MukB on DNA and be used to study its\nbiochemical properties in vivo.\n", "  Single-molecule narrowfield microscopy is a versatile tool to investigate a\ndiverse range of protein dynamics in live cells and has been extensively used\nin bacteria. Here, we describe how these methods can be extended to larger\neukaryotic, yeast cells, which contain sub-cellular compartments. We describe\nhow to obtain single-molecule microscopy data but also how to analyse these\ndata to track and obtain the stoichiometry of molecular complexes diffusing in\nthe cell. We chose glucose mediated signal transduction of live yeast cells as\nthe system to demonstrate these single-molecule techniques as transcriptional\nregulation is fundamentally a single molecule problem - a single repressor\nprotein binding a single binding site in the genome can dramatically alter\nbehaviour at the whole cell and population level.\n", "  It is investigated how two (standard or generalized) $\\lambda-$symmetries of\na given second-order ordinary differential equation can be used to solve the\nequation by quadratures. The method is based on the construction of two\ncommuting generalized symmetries for this equation by using both\n$\\lambda-$symmetries. The functions used in that construction are related with\nintegrating factors of the reduced and auxiliary equations associated to the\n$\\lambda-$symmetries. These functions can also be used to derive a Jacobi last\nmultiplier and two integrating factors for the given equation.\n  Some examples illustrate the method; one of them is included in the XXVII\ncase of the Painlev\\'e-Gambier classification. An explicit expression of its\ngeneral solution in terms of two fundamental sets of solutions for two related\nsecond-order linear equations is also obtained.\n", "  We consider diffusion caused by a combined influence of the Hall effect and\nelectric currents, and argue that such diffusion forms chemical inhomogeneities\nin plasma. The considered mechanism can be responsible for the formation of\nelement spots in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Such current-driven\ndiffusion can be accompanied by the propagation of a particular type of waves\nwhich have not been considered earlier. In these waves, the impurity number\ndensity oscillare alone and their frequency is determined by the electric\ncurrents and sort of impurity ions. These compositional waves exist if the\nmagnetic pressure in plasma is much greater than the gas pressure. Such waves\nlead to local variations of chemical composition and, hence, can manifest\nthemselves by variations of the emission in spectral lines.\n", "  This paper presents a method to validate the true patrons of a brand, group,\nartist or any other entity on the social networking site Twitter. We analyze\nthe trend of total number of tweets, average retweets and total number of\nfollowers for various nodes for different social and political backgrounds. We\nargue that average retweets to follower ratio reveals the overall value of the\nindividual accounts and helps estimate the true to fake account ratio.\n", "  In this letter, we consider the theory of $F(R)$ gravity with the lagrangian\ndensity $ \\pounds = R+\\alpha R^2 + \\beta R^2 \\ln \\beta R $. We obtain the\nconstant curvature solutions and find the scalar potential of the gravitational\nfield. We also obtain the mass squared of a scalaron in the Einstein$^,$s\nframe. We find cosmological parameters corresponding to the recent Plank 2015\nresults. Finally, we analyze the critical points and stability of the new\nmodified theory of gravity and find that logarithmic correction is necessary to\nhave successful model.\n", "  Phonon calculations based on first principle electronic structure theory,\nsuch as the Kohn-Sham density functional theory, have wide applications in\nphysics, chemistry and material science. The computational cost of first\nprinciple phonon calculations typically scales steeply as $\\mathcal{O}(N_e^4)$,\nwhere $N_e$ is the number of electrons in the system. In this work, we develop\na new method to reduce the computational complexity of computing the full\ndynamical matrix, and hence the phonon spectrum, to $\\mathcal{O}(N_e^3)$. The\nkey concept for achieving this is to compress the polarizability operator\nadaptively with respect to the perturbation of the potential due to the change\nof the atomic configuration. Such adaptively compressed polarizability operator\n(ACP) allows accurate computation of the phonon spectrum. The reduction of\ncomplexity only weakly depends on the size of the band gap, and our method is\napplicable to insulators as well as semiconductors with small band gaps. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method using one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional model problems.\n", "  In this short mostly expository note, we sketch a program for gauging fully\nextended topological field theories in 3 dimensions. One begins with the\nspherical fusion category with which one wants to do Levin-Wen or Turaev-Viro.\nOne then computes a homotopic space with certain $\\pi_\\bullet$ given by\nautoequivalences, invertible objects and the ground (algebraic) field. Then for\neach desired symmetry group $G$ one looks at mapping $BG$ into that. This\nclassifies equivalence classes of G-extended fusion categories. This is an\nequivalence at a fully extended level so will allow many defects rather than\nonly evaluating partition functions on closed manifolds. We can now use these\ncategories to build a new fully extended 3d topological field theory, but now\npossibly with extra data. This is the result of permeating defect walls and\nsaying how that affects the assignment to the point strata.\n", "  The recently discovered 'light (photons) with half-integral spin' is\ninterpreted as q-Fermions proposed by us in 1991, as these q-Fermions satisfy\nq-deformed anti-commutation relations (pertaining to spin half) and have the\nproperty that more than one q-Fermion can occupy a given quantum state. In this\narticle, in view of the recent discovery, we recall the construction of\nq-Fermions and give the statistical properties of q-Fermion gas, based on our\npreprint in 1992.\n", "  We construct the positive invertible map of the mixed states of a single\nqutrit onto the states of two identical fermions. It is shown that using this\none-to-one correspondence between qutrit states and states of two identical\nthree-dimensional fermions (the unphysical odd dimension is picked for\nsimplicity) one may attribute hidden entanglement to a single mixed state of\nqutrit.\n", "  With the discussion of three examples, we aim at clarifying the concept of\nenergy transfer associated with dissipation in mechanics and in thermodynamics.\nThe dissipation effects due to dissipative forces, such as the friction force\nbetween solids or the drag force in motions in fluids, lead to an internal\nenergy increase of the system and/or to a heat transfer to the surrounding.\nThis heat flow is consistent with the second law, which states that the entropy\nof the universe should increase when those forces are present because of the\nirreversibility always associated with their actions. As far as mechanics is\nconcerned the effects of the dissipative forces are include in the Newton's\nequations as impulses and pseudo-works.\n", "  We experimentally show octave-spanning supercontinuum generation in a\nnon-stoichiometric silicon-rich nitride waveguide when pumped by femtosecond\npulses from an erbium fiber laser. The pulse energy and bandwidth are\ncomparable to results achieved in stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides,\nbut our material platform is simpler to manufacture. We also observe\nwave-breaking supercontinuum generation by using orthogonal pumping in the same\nwaveguide. Additional analysis reveals that the waveguide height is a powerful\ntuning parameter for generating mid-infrared dispersive waves while keeping the\npump in the telecom band.\n", "  A formal description of a quantum abacus based encoding system is presented.\nThis way of representing data for processing purposes is based on a quantum\nalgorithm for counting qubits introduced by Lesovik et al.\n\\cite{LesovikEtal2010} and Suslov et al. \\cite{SuslovEtal2011}, but formally\ndeveloped in this work. Finally, in order to illustrate the potential of this\nproposal, the implementation of the basic quantum array operations through this\nencoding system is presented.\n", "  An indentation experiment involves five variables: indenter shape, material\nbehavior of the substrate, contact size, applied load and indentation depth.\nOnly three variable are known afterwards, namely, indenter shape, plus load and\ndepth as function of time. As the contact size is not measured and the\ndetermination of the material properties is the very aim of the test; two\nequations are needed to obtain a mathematically solvable system.\n  For elastic materials, the contact size can always be eliminated once and for\nall in favor of the depth; a single relation between load, depth and material\nproperties remains with the latter variable as unknown.\n  For viscoelastic materials where hereditary integrals model the constitutive\nbehavior, the relation between depth and contact size usually depends also on\nthe (time-dependent) properties of the material. Solving the inverse problem,\ni.e., determining the material properties from the experimental data, therefore\nneeds both equations. Extending Sneddon's analysis of the indentation problem\nfor elastic materials to include viscoelastic materials, the two equations\nmentioned above are derived. To find the time dependence of the material\nproperties the feasibility of Golden and Graham's method of decomposing\nhereditary integrals (J.M. Golden and G.A.C. Graham. Boundary value problems in\nlinear viscoelasticity, Springer, 1988) is investigated and applied to a single\nload-unload process and to sinusoidally driven stationary state indentation\nprocesses.\n", "  One of the ultimate goals of the study of iron-based superconductors is to\nidentify the common feature that produces the high critical temperature (Tc).\nIn the early days, based on a weak-coupling viewpoint, the nesting between\nhole- and electron-like Fermi surfaces (FSs) leading to the so-called $s\\pm$\nstate was considered to be one such key feature. However, this theory has faced\na serious challenge ever since the discovery of alkali-metal-doped FeSe (AFS)\nsuperconductors, in which only electron-like FSs with a nodeless\nsuperconducting gap are observed. Several theories have been proposed, but a\nconsistent understanding is yet to be achieved. Here we show experimentally\nthat a hole-like band exists in KxFe2-ySe2, which presumably forms a hole-like\nFermi surface. The present study suggests that AFS can be categorized in the\nsame group as iron arsenides with both hole- and electron-like FSs present.\nThis result provides a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the\nsuperconductivity in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  To resolve the quantum measurement problem, we propose an objective collapse\ntheory in which both the wavefunction and the process of collapse are regarded\nas ontologically objective. The theory, which we call the\nentangling-speed-threshold theory, postulates that collapse occurs when the\nentangling speed of a system reaches a threshold, and the collapse basis is\ndetermined so as to eliminate the entangling speed and to minimize its\nincreasing rate. Using this theory, we provide answers to the questions of\nwhere and when collapse occurs, how the collapse basis is determined, what\nsystems are (in other words, what the actual tensor product structure is), and\nwhat determines the observables. We also explain how deterministic classical\ndynamics emerges from indeterministic quantum collapse, explaining the\nquantum-to-classical transition. In addition, we show that the theory\nguarantees energy conservation to a high accuracy. We apply the theory to a\nmacroscopic flying body such as a bullet in the air, and derive a satisfactory\ncollapse basis that is highly localized in both position and momentum,\nconsistent with our everyday observation. Finally, we suggest an experiment\nthat can verify the theory.\n", "  The paper provides mathematics and physics considerations concerning a\nspecial class of electron spin manipulating structures for future Electron-Ion\nCollider (EIC) projects. These structures, which we call Universal Synchronous\nSpin Rotators (USSR), consist of a sequence of standard basic spin manipulating\nelements or cells built with two solenoids and one bending magnet between them.\nWhen integrated into the ring arcs, USSR structures do not affect the central\nparticle orbit, and their spin transformation functions can be described by a\nlinear mathematical model. In spite of being relatively simple, the model\nallows one to design spin rotators, which are able to perform spin direction\nchanges from vertical to longitudinal and vice versa in significant continuous\nintervals of the electron energy. This makes USSR especially valuable tools for\nEIC nuclear physics experiments.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of the new hydride superconductor\nCaFeAsH, which superconducts up to 47 K when electron-doped with La, and the\nisovalent alloy system CaFeAsH$_{1-x}$F$_x$ are investigated using density\nfunctional based methods. The $\\vec Q = (\\pi,\\pi,0)$ peak of the nesting\nfunction $\\xi(\\vec q)$ is found to be extremely strong and sharp, and\nadditional structure in $\\xi(\\vec q)$ associated with the near-circular Fermi\nsurfaces (FSs) that may impact low energy excitations is quantified. The\nunusual band introduced by H, which shows strong dispersion perpendicular to\nthe FeAs layers, is shown to be connected to a peculiar van Hove singularity\njust below the Fermi level. This band provides a three dimensional electron\nellipsoid Fermi surface not present in other Fe-based superconducting materials\nnor in CaFeAsF. Electron doping by 25\\% La or Co has minor affect on this\nellipsoid Fermi surface, but suppresses FS nesting strongly, consistent with\nthe viewpoint that eliminating strong nesting and the associated magnetic order\nallows high T$_c$ superconductivity to emerge. Various aspects of the isovalent\nalloy system CaFeAsH$_{1-x}$F$_x$ and means of electron doping are discussed in\nterms of influence of incipient bands.\n", "  CdS samples were synthesized on amorphous glass and conductive glass\nsubstrates at room temperature using spin coating technique and subsequently\nannealed at five different temperatures in air for one hour. The speed and time\nof spin coating were varied initially to optimize the properties of the\nsamples. FTIR spectroscopy was used in this experiment to analyze CdS bond\nformation variation with annealing temperature. A liquid junction photocell\nwith KI/I2 electrolyte was prepared to measure the photovoltaic properties.\nPhotovoltage, photocurrent and corresponding output power were measured in\norder to determine the output power.\n", "  Significant progress has been made towards laser-driven fusion ignition via\ndifferent schemes, including direct and indirect central ignition, fast\nignition, shock ignition, and impact ignition schemes. However, to reach\nignition conditions, there are still various technical and physical challenges\nto be solved for all these schemes. Here, our multi-dimensional integrated\nsimulation shows that the fast-ignition conditions could be achieved when two\n2.8 petawatt heating laser pulses counter-propagate along a 3.5 kilotesla\nexternal magnetic field. Within a period of 5 picoseconds, the laser pulses\nheat a nuclear fuel to reach the ignition conditions. Furthermore, we present\nthe parameter windows of lasers and magnetic fields required for ignition for\nexperimental test.\n", "  We describe extension of the pyritohedral symmetry to 4-dimensional Euclidean\nspace and present the group elements in terms of quaternions. It turns out that\nit is a maximal subgroup of both the rank-4 Coxeter groups W(F4) and W(H4)\nimplying that it is a group relevant to the crystallography as well as\nquasicrystallographic structures in 4-dimensions. First we review the\npyritohedral symmetry in 3 dimensional Euclidean space which is a maximal\nsubgroup both in the Coxeter-Weyl groups W(B3)=Aut(D3) and W(H3). The related\npolyhedra in 3-dimensions are the two dual polyhedra pseudoicosahedron-\npyritohedron and the pseudo icosidodecahedron. In quaternionic representations\nit finds a natural extension to the 4-dimensions.The related polytopes turn out\nto be the pseudo snub 24-cell and its dual polytope expressed in terms of a\nparameter x leading to snub 24-cell and its dual in the limit where the\nparameter x takes the golden ratio. It turns out that the relevant lattice is\nthe root lattice of W(D4).\n", "  Wavenumber-frequency spectra of the streamwise velocity component obtained\nfrom large-eddy simulations are presented. Following a recent paper [Wilczek et\nal., J. Fluid. Mech., 769:R1, 2015] we show that the main features, a Doppler\nshift and a Doppler broadening of frequencies, are captured by an advection\nmodel based on the Tennekes-Kraichnan random-sweeping hypothesis with\nadditional mean flow. In this paper, we focus on the height-dependence of the\nspectra within the logarithmic layer of the flow. We furthermore benchmark an\nanalytical model spectrum that takes the predictions of the random-sweeping\nmodel as a starting point and find good agreement with the LES data. We also\nquantify the influence of LES grid resolution on the wavenumber-frequency\nspectra.\n", "  The spectra of spin models have been investigated in computation experiments.\nFor the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Edwards-Anderson models we have determined\nthe basic spectral characteristics: the average depth of a local minimum, the\nspectrum width, the depth of the global minimum. The experimental data are used\nto build the relations between these quantities and the model dimensionality N\nand find their asymptotic values for N goes to infinity.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetoelectric (ME) effect in layered composite\nrings subjected to circumferential AC magnetic fields and DC magnetic fields in\nradial, axial or circumferential directions. Bilayer samples were obtained\ncombining different grades of commercial Mn-Zn ferrites or Ni-Zn ferrites with\ncommercial lead zirconate titanate (PZT). Mn-Zn ferrites with low\nmagnetostriction saturation () and low magneto-crystalline anisotropy constants\nshow high ME capabilities when associated with PZT in ring structures. In\ncertain conditions, these ME effects are higher than those obtained with\nTerfenol-D/PZT composites in the same layered ring structure. Magnetostrictive\nand mechanical characterizations have given results that explain these high ME\nperformances. Nevertheless, Mn-Zn ferrite/PZT composites exhibit voltages\nresponses with low linearity especially at high signal level. Based on the\nparticular structure of the ME device, a method to decrease the nonlinear\nharmonic distortion of the ME voltages is proposed. Harmonic distortion\nanalysis of ME voltages measured in different configurations allows us to\nexplain the phenomenon.\n", "  Several recent new measurements of the top-quark mass that use alternative\nobservables and reconstruction techniques are presented, performed by the ATLAS\nand CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC. Alternative observables can help\nprovide insight by presenting different systematic sensitivities and by\nconstraining prevailing systematic uncertainties of standard measurements, such\nas jet energy calibrations. Furthermore, the top-quark mass is extracted from\ntheoretically well-defined observables, such as the inclusive production cross\nsection for top quark pairs. Finally, the mass is measured in event topologies\ndominated by electroweak-mediated single top production by both experiments.\nThe results of different techniques and production modes are found to be\nconsistent with what is obtained in standard measurements.\n", "  We analyze the influence of fractal structure of the interstellar matter\n(ISM) density on the parameter values for the radio surface brightness to\ndiameter ($\\Sigma-D$) relation for supernovae remnants (SNRs). We model a dense\nISM as a molecular cloud with fractal density structure. SNRs are modelled as\nspheres of different radius scattered in the modelled ISM. The surface\nbrightness of the SNRs is calculated from the simple relation $\\Sigma \\propto\n\\rho^{0.5}D^{-3.5}$ and also from the parametrized more general form $\\Sigma\n\\propto \\rho^{\\eta}D^{-\\beta_0}$. Our results demonstrate that empirical\n$\\Sigma-D$ slopes that are steeper than the ones derived from theory, might be\npartly explained with the fractal structure of the ambient medium into which\nSNRs expand. The slope of the $\\Sigma-D$ relation steepens if the density of\nthe regions where SNRs are formed is higher. The simple geometrical effects\ncombined with the fractal structure of the ISM can contribute to a steeper\nempirical $\\Sigma-D$ slopes, especially for older remnants, and this is more\npronounced if $\\Sigma$ has a stronger dependence on ambient density.\n", "  The physics of Josephson tunnel junctions drastically depends on their\ngeometrical configurations. The shape of the junction determines the specific\nform of the magnetic-field dependence of the its Josephson current. Here we\naddress the magnetic diffraction patterns of specially shaped planar Josephson\ntunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field of arbitrary\norientations. We focus on a wide ensemble of junctions whose shape is invariant\nunder point reflection. We analyze the implications of this type of isometry\nand derive the threshold curves of junctions whose shape is the union or the\nrelative complement of two point symmetric plane figures.\n", "  We investigate vibron-assisted electron transport in single-molecule\ntransistors containing an individual Fe4 Single-Molecule Magnet. We observe a\nstrong suppression of the tunneling current at low bias in combination with\nvibron-assisted excitations. The observed features are explained by a strong\nelectron-vibron coupling in the framework of the Franck-Condon model supported\nby density-functional theory.\n", "  Despite the significant experimental effort made in the last decades, the\norigin of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays is still largely unknown. Key\nastrophysical information to identify where these energetic particles come from\nis provided by their chemical composition. It is well known that a very\nsensitive tracer of the primary particle type is the muon content of the\nshowers generated by the interaction of the cosmic rays with air molecules. We\nintroduce a likelihood function to reconstruct particle densities using\nsegmented detectors with time resolution. As an example of this general method,\nwe fit the muon distribution at ground level using an array of counters like\nAMIGA, one of the Pierre Auger Observatory detectors. For this particular case\nwe compare the reconstruction performance against a previous method. With the\nnew technique, more events can be reconstructed than before. In addition the\nstatistical uncertainty of the measured number of muons is reduced, allowing\nfor a better discrimination of the cosmic ray primary mass.\n", "  We propose a simple yet effective route to the design of superalkalis, by\nsuccessive alkali metal substitution in borazine (B3N3H6). Using Li atoms, our\ndensity functional calculations demonstrate that the vertical ionization energy\n(VIE) of B3N3H6-xLix decreases with the increase in x for x equals 1-6. For x\nequals 4, the VIE of B3N3H6-xLix becomes lower than that of Li atom, thereby\nindicating their superalkali nature. More interestingly, all these species are\nplanar such that NICSzz value at the rings center is reduced. These novel\nsuperalkalis are expected to stimulate further interests in this field.\n", "  Tables of ab-initio total cross sections, probabilities at zero impact\nparameter, and impact parameter moments are presented concerning the ionization\nof Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe by proton impact in the energy range (0.1-10) MeV.\nCalculations correspond to the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state\napproximation (CDW-EIS) for energies up to 1MeV, and to the first Born\napproximation for larger energies. Results displayed in the tables are\ndisaggregated for the different initial bound states, considering all shells\nfor Ne and Ar, L-M-N shells of Kr and M-N-O shells of Xe. Our inner-shell\nionization cross sections are compared with the available experimental data and\nwith the ECPSSR results.\n", "  Under the right conditions, self sustaining fission waves can form in fertile\nnuclear materials. These waves result from the transport and absorption of\nneutrons and the resulting production of fissile isotopes. When these fission,\nadditional neutrons are produced and the chain reaction propagates until it is\npoisoned by the buildup of fission products. It is typically assumed that\nfission waves are soliton-like and self stabilizing. However, we show that in\nuranium, coupling of the neutron field to the 239U->239Np->239Pu decay chain\ncan lead to a Hopf bifurcation. The fission reaction then ramps up and down,\nalong with the wave velocity. The critical driver for the instability is a\ndelay, caused by the half-life of 239U, between the time evolution of the\nneutron field and the production of 239Pu. This allows the 239Pu to accumulate\nand burn out in a self limiting oscillation that is characteristic of a Hopf\nbifurcation. Time dependent results are obtained using a numerical\nimplementation of a reduced order reaction-diffusion model for a fast neutron\nfield. Monte Carlo simulations in combination with a linear stability analysis\nare used to confirm the results for the full system and to establish the\nparameter space where the Hopf occurs.\n", "  We have demonstrated effective fringe field control of one-dimensional\nelectron gas (1-DEG) in AlGaN/GaN lateral nanowires. The nanowires are site\ncontrolled and formed by a combination of dry and anisotropic wet etching. The\nnanowire dimensions are well controlled and can have a very high length/width\naspect ratio of 10 um/5 nm or larger. The transport is controlled by a fringe\ngate and shows room temperature quantum transport where gradual filling of 1-D\nsubbands gets manifested as oscillations in the transconductance. The fringe\ngate threshold voltage for depletion of one-dimensional electron gas is found\nto increase with increasing drain voltage indicating efficient control of\n1-DEG. The transport characteristics and fringe field operation are explained\nby taking into account quantum capacitance in addition to the conventional\ngeometric capacitance. The effect of nanowire width and fringe gate position is\nalso discussed.\n", "  For theories with multiple couplings the perturbative $\\beta$-functions for\nscalar, Yukawa couplings are expressible in terms of contributions\ncorresponding to one particle irreducible graphs and also contributions which\nare one particle reducible depending on the anomalous dimension. Here we\ndiscuss redefinitions, or changes of scheme, which preserve this structure. The\nredefinitions allow for IPR contributions of a specific form, as is necessary\nto encompass the relation between MS and momentum subtraction renormalisation\nschemes. Many multiply 1PR terms in the transformed $\\beta$-function are\ngenerated but these can all be absorbed into antisymmetric contributions to the\nanomalous dimensions which are essentially arbitrary and can be discarded. As\nan illustration the results are applied to the scheme dependence of the\nanomalous dimension, which determines the $\\beta$-function, for ${\\cal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric scalar fermion theories in four dimensions up to four loops.\n", "  We review different electron transport methods to probe the magnetic\nproperties, such as the magnetic anisotropy, of an individual Fe4 SMM. The\ndifferent approaches comprise first and higher order transport through the\nmolecule. Gate spectroscopy, focusing on the charge degeneracy-point, is\npresented as a robust technique to quantify the longitudinal magnetic\nanisotropy of the SMM in different redox states. We provide statistics showing\nthe robustness and reproducibility of the different methods. In addition,\nconductance measurements typically show high-energy excited states well beyond\nthe ground spin multiplet of SMM. Some of these excitations have their origin\nin excited spin multiplets, others in vibrational modes of the molecule. The\ninterplay between vibrations, charge and spin may yield a new approach for spin\ncontrol.\n", "  In this work, the reliability of the Landau expression for the nuclear level\ndensity calculations is tested, for the first-time, to describe nuclear level\ndensities of some light, intermediate mass and heavy nuclei at excitations\ncorresponding to discrete and s-wave neutron resonance energies. The chi-2\nminimizing method is used in treatment of the experimental data for the two\nsuggested energy range of discrete energies given by Nuclear Data Sheet [1] and\nby the systematic for nuclear level density parametrization in [2]. Our\ncomparison with the related data in the discrete energy range has shown that\nthe results obtained by the Landau expression are better than those of\nback-shifted Fermi-gas model and constant temperature approximation. This\nresult is also valid for some nuclei of interest when the s-wave neutron\nresonance level density is included to check theoretical prescriptions in the\nenergy range from initial bound states to unbound states near the neutron\nbinding energy.\n", "  Physics beyond the Standard Model, realized above the electroweak scale, can\nbe incorporated in a model independent way in the Wilson coefficients of higher\ndimensional gauge invariant operators. In these proceedings we review the\nmatching of the $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant\ndimension-six operators on the effective Hamiltonian governing $b\\to s$ and\n$b\\to c$ transitions, including the leading 1-loop effects.\n", "  We analyze the motion of stars in the direction perpendicular to the galactic\nplane following a spiral arm passage. We show that the fast change in the\nvertical galactic potential causes a thermalized distribution to develop a\ndistinctive \"ringing\"-like non-thermal signature. We use A and F-stars from the\nextended Hipparocos catalogue to show that a spiral arm passage (or passages),\nwith an amplitude (or randomly combined amplitudes) of at least {\\delta}{\\rho}\n/ {\\rho} > ~0.15 must have taken place in the past (with {\\rho} being the total\nbackground density). Presently, the local stellar distribution within ~100 pc\nof the plane, appears (at the 2.5{\\sigma} level) to be contracting towards it.\n", "  We present a data-driven approach to determine the memory kernel and random\nnoise in generalized Langevin equations. To facilitate practical\nimplementations, we parameterize the kernel function in the Laplace domain by a\nrational function, with coefficients directly linked to the equilibrium\nstatistics of the coarse-grain variables. We show that such an approximation\ncan be constructed to arbitrarily high order and the resulting generalized\nLangevin dynamics can be embedded in an extended stochastic model without\nexplicit memory. We demonstrate how to introduce the stochastic noise so that\nthe second fluctuation-dissipation theorem is exactly satisfied. Results from\nseveral numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n", "  Studies of social structures has been grown on the last years, because its\nsharing form and content creation attracted the public in general. Such\nstructures are observed, as an example, in literary pieces. A featured author\nis J.R.R. Tolkien, with his books that describe a fictional world and its\ninhabitants. These books bring a narrative of the creation of the Middle-Earth\nand all of its mythology. His main pieces are: The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and\nThe Lord of the rings, The objective of this article is the analysis of the\nsocial structures emerging of the conjunction of these works, where the social\nrelations are described by the reference criteria, shared events and direct\nbonds, with the major centrality measures together with the structural entropy\nof first order. Enabling the doing of an analogy with the canonic ensemble of\nthe mechanics statistics and enabling analyzing the degree of homogeneity of\nthe bonds between the formed communities.\n", "  We study the local field enhancement properties of self-similar nanolenses\nand compare the obtained results with the performance of standard dimer\nnanoantennas. We report that, despite the additional structural complexity,\nself-similar nanolenses are unable to provide significant improvements over the\nfield enhancement performance of standard plasmonic dimers.\n", "  Magnetic perturbations on ground at high latitudes are directly associated\nonly with the divergence-free component of the height-integrated horizontal\nionospheric current, $\\textbf{J}_{\\perp,df}$. Here we show how\n$\\textbf{J}_{\\perp,df}$ can be expressed as the total horizontal current\n$\\textbf{J}_\\perp$ minus its curl-free component, the latter being completely\ndetermined by the global Birkeland current pattern. Thus in regions where\n$\\textbf{J}_\\perp = 0$, the global Birkeland current distribution alone\ndetermines the local magnetic perturbation. We show with observations from\nground and space that in the polar cap, the ground magnetic field perturbations\ntend to align with the Birkeland current contribution in darkness but not in\nsunlight. We also show that in sunlight, the magnetic perturbations are\ntypically such that the equivalent overhead current is anti-parallel to the\nconvection, indicating that the Hall current system dominates. Thus the ground\nmagnetic field in the polar cap relates to different current systems in\nsunlight and in darkness.\n", "  We present a new quantitative technique that determines the times and\ndurations of substorm expansion and recovery phases and possible growth phases\nbased on percentiles of the rate of change of auroral electrojet indices. By\nbeing able to prescribe different percentile values, we can determine the onset\nand duration of substorm phases for smaller or larger variations of the auroral\nindex or indeed any auroral zone ground-based magnetometer data. We apply this\ntechnique to the SuperMAG AL (SML) index and compare our expansion phase onset\ntimes with previous lists of substorm onsets. We find that more than 50% of\nevents in previous lists occur within 20 min of our identified onsets. We also\npresent a comparison of superposed epoch analyses of SML based on our onsets\nidentified by our technique and existing onset lists and find that the general\ncharacteristics of the substorm bay are comparable. By prescribing user-defined\nthresholds, this automated, quantitative technique represents an improvement\nover any visual identification of substorm onsets or indeed any fixed threshold\nmethod.\n", "  In this paper we study how GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo navigation signals are\ncompromised by strong irregularities causing severe phase scintillation\n($\\mathit{\\sigma }_{\\phi }$ > 1) in the nightside high-latitude ionosphere\nduring a substorm on 3 November 2013. Substorm onset and a later\nintensification coincided with polar cap patches entering the auroral oval to\nbecome auroral blobs. Using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\nreceivers and optical data, we show severe scintillation driven by intense\nauroral emissions in the line of sight between the receiver and the satellites.\nDuring substorm expansion, the area of scintillation followed the intense\npoleward edge of the auroral oval. The intense auroral emissions were colocated\nwith polar cap patches (blobs). The patches did not contain strong\nirregularities, neither before entering the auroral oval nor after the aurora\nhad faded. Signals from all three GNSS constellations were similarly affected\nby the irregularities. Furthermore, two receivers spaced around 120km apart\nreported highly different scintillation impacts, with strong scintillation on\nhalf of the satellites in one receiver and no scintillation in the other. This\nshows that areas of severe irregularities in the nightside ionosphere can be\nhighly localized. Amplitude scintillations were low throughout the entire\ninterval.\n", "  By using 7 years optical auroral observations obtained at Yellow River\nStation (magnetic latitude $76.24\\,^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$N) at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard,\nwe performed the first extensive survey for the dayside diffuse auroras (DDAs)\nand acquired observational results as follows. (1) The DDAs can be classified\ninto two broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The\nunstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in the morning and afternoon, but the\nstructured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN).\n(2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously\ndifferent properties. The afternoon ones are much stable and seldom show\npulsating property. (3) The DDAs are more easily observed under geomagnetically\nquiet times. (4) The structured DDAsmainly show patchy, stripy, and irregular\nforms and are often pulsating and drifting. The drifting directions are mostly\nwestward (with speed $\\sim$5km/s), but there are cases showing eastward or\npoleward drifting. (5) The stripy DDAs are exclusively observed near theMLN\nand,most importantly, their alignments are confirmed to be consistent with the\ndirection of ionospheric convection near the MLN. (6) A new auroral form,\ncalled throat aurora, is found to be developed from the stripy DDAs. Based on\nthe observational results and previous studies, we proposed our explanations to\nthe DDAs. We suggest that the unstructured DDAs observed in the morning are\nextensions of the nightside diffuse aurora to the dayside, but that observed in\nthe afternoon are predominantly caused by proton precipitations.\n$\\textit{(Abstract continues in PDF).}$\n", "  We present two examples from the cusp ionosphere over Svalbard,where poleward\nmoving auroral forms (PMAFs) are causing significant phase scintillation in\nsignals from navigation satellites. The data were obtained using a combination\nof ground-based optical instruments and a newly installed multiconstellation\nnavigation signal receiver at Longyearbyen. Both events affected signals from\nGPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). When one intense PMAF\nappeared, the signal from one GPS spacecraft also experienced a temporary loss\nof signal lock. Although several polar cap patches were also observed in the\narea as enhancements in total electron content, the most severe scintillation\nand loss of signal lock appear to be attributed to very intense PMAF activity.\nThis shows that PMAFs are locations of strong ionospheric irregularities, which\nat times may cause more severe disturbances in the cusp ionosphere for\nnavigation signals than polar cap patches.\n", "  The overall morphology and dynamics of magnetospheric substorms is well\nestablished in terms of the observed qualitative auroral features seen in\nground-based magnetometers. This paper focuses on the quantitative\ncharacterization of substorm dynamics captured by ground-based magnetometer\nstations. We present the first analysis of substorms using dynamical networks\nobtained from the full available set of ground-based magnetometer observations\nin the Northern Hemisphere. The stations are connected in the network when the\ncorrelation between the vector magnetometer time series from pairs of stations\nwithin a running time window exceeds a threshold. Dimensionless parameters can\nthen be obtained that characterize the network and by extension, the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of the substorm under observation. We analyze four\nisolated substorm test cases as well as a steady magnetic convection (SMC)\nevent and a day in which no substorms occur. These test case substorms are\nfound to give a consistent characteristic network response at onset in terms of\ntheir spatial correlation. Such responses are differentiable from responses to\nthe SMC event and nonsubstorm times. We present a method to optimize network\nparametrization with respect to the different individual station responses, the\nspatial inhomogeneity of stations in the Northern Hemisphere, and the choice of\ncorrelation window sizes. Our results suggest that dynamical network analysis\nhas potential to quantitatively categorize substorms.\n", "  Recent results by the Van Allen Probes mission showed that the occurrence of\nenergetic ion injections inside geosynchronous orbit could be very frequent\nthroughout the main phase of a geomagnetic storm. Understanding, therefore, the\nformation and evolution of energetic particle injections is critical in order\nto quantify their effect in the inner magnetosphere. We present a case study of\na substorm event that occurred during a weak storm $\\textit{ Dst }$ $\\sim$\n-40nT on 14 July 2013. Van Allen Probe B, inside geosynchronous orbit, observed\ntwo energetic proton injections within 10min, with different dipolarization\nsignatures and duration. The first one is a dispersionless, short-timescale\ninjection pulse accompanied by a sharp dipolarization signature, while the\nsecond one is a dispersed, longer-timescale injection pulse accompanied by a\ngradual dipolarization signature. We combined ground magnetometer data from\nvarious stations and in situ particle and magnetic field data from multiple\nsatellites in the inner magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet to determine\nthe spatial extent of these injections, their temporal evolution, and their\neffects in the inner magnetosphere. Our results indicate that there are\ndifferent spatial and temporal scales at which injections can occur in the\ninner magnetosphere and depict the necessity of multipoint observations of both\nparticle and magnetic field data in order to determine these scales.\n", "  In this data report we discuss reprocessing of the Space Technology 5 (ST5)\nmagnetometer database for inclusion in NASA's Coordinated Data Analysis Web\n(CDAWeb) virtual observatory. The mission consisted of three spacecraft flying\nin elliptical orbits, from 27 March to 27 June 2006. Reprocessing includes (1)\ntransforming the data into the Modified Apex Coordinate System for projection\nto a common reference altitude of 110km, (2) correcting gain jumps, and (3)\nvalidating the results. We display the averaged magnetic perturbations as a\nkeogram, which allows direct comparison of the full-mission data with the solar\nwind values and geomagnetic indices.With the data referenced to a common\naltitude, we find the following: (1) Magnetic perturbations that track the\npassage of corotating interaction regions and high-speed solar wind; (2)\nunexpectedly strong dayside perturbations during a solstice magnetospheric\nsawtooth oscillation interval characterized by a radial interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) component that may have enhanced the accompanying modest southward\nIMF; and (3) intervals of reduced magnetic perturbations or \"calms,\" associated\nwith periods of slow solar wind, interspersed among variable-length episodic\nenhancements. These calms aremost evidentwhen the IMF is northward or\nprojectswith a northward component onto the geomagnetic dipole. The reprocessed\nST5 data are in very good agreement with magnetic perturbations from the\nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, which we also map\nto 110km. We briefly discuss the methods used to remap the ST5 data and the\nmeans of validating the results against DMSP. Our methods form the basis for\nfuture intermission comparisons of space-based magnetometer data.\n", "  High-resolution in situ measurements from the three Swarm spacecraft, in a\nstring-of-pearls configuration, provide new insights about the combined role of\nflow channel events and particle impact ionization in creating $\\textit{F}$\nregion electron density structures in the northern Scandinavian dayside cusp.\nWe present a case of polar cap patch formation where a reconnection-driven\nlow-density relative westward flow channel is eroding the dayside solar-ionized\nplasma but where particle impact ionization in the cusp dominates the initial\nplasma structuring. In the cusp, density features are observed which are twice\nas dense as the solar-ionized background. These features then follow the polar\ncap convection and become less structured and lower in amplitude. These are the\nfirst in situ observations tracking polar cap patch evolution from creation by\nplasma transport and enhancement by cusp precipitation, through entrainment in\nthe polar cap flow and relaxation into smooth patches as they approach the\nnightside auroral oval.\n", "  We study coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in a perfectly conducting\nvacuum chamber of rectangular cross section, in a formalism allowing an\narbitrary sequence of bends and straight sections. We apply the paraxial method\nin the frequency domain, with a Fourier development in the vertical coordinate\nbut with no other mode expansions. A line charge source is handled numerically\nby a new method that rids the equations of singularities through a change of\ndependent variable. The resulting algorithm is fast compared to earlier\nmethods, works for short bunches with complicated structure, and yields all six\nfield components at any space-time point. As an example we compute the\ntangential magnetic field at the walls. From that one can make a perturbative\ntreatment of the Poynting flux to estimate the energy deposited in resistive\nwalls. The calculation was motivated by a design issue for LCLS-II, the\nquestion of how much wall heating from CSR occurs in the last bend of a bunch\ncompressor and the following straight section. Working with a realistic\nlongitudinal bunch form of r.m.s. length $10.4~\\mu$m and a charge of 100 pC we\nconclude that the radiated power is quite small (28 W at a 1 MHz repetition\nrate), and all radiated energy is absorbed in the walls within 7 m along the\nstraight section.\n", "  It is an observation of Kontsevich and Soibelman that generating series that\nproduce certain (generalized) Donaldson Thomas invariants are secretly\nalgebraic functions over the rationals. From a physical perspective this\nobservation arises naturally for DT invariants that appear as BPS indices in\ntheories of class S[A]: explicit algebraic equations (that completely determine\nthese series) can be derived using (degenerate) spectral networks. In this\npaper, we conjecture an algebraic equation associated to DT invariants for the\nKronecker 3-quiver with dimension vectors (3n,2n), n>0 in the non-trivial\nregion of its stability parameter space. Using a functional equation due to\nReineke, we show algebraicity of generating series for Euler characteristics of\nstable moduli for the Kronecker m-quiver assuming algebraicity of generating\nseries for DT invariants. In the latter part of the paper we deduce very\nexplicit results on the asymptotics of DT invariants/Euler characteristics\nunder the assumption of algebraicity of their generating series; explicit large\nn asymptotics are deduced for dimension vectors (3n,2n) for the Kronecker\n3-quiver. The algebraic equation is derived using spectral network techniques\ndeveloped by Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke, but the main results can be understood\nwithout knowledge of spectral networks.\n", "  This paper explores the spatial and temporal diffusion of political violence\nin North and West Africa. It does so by endeavoring to represent the mental\nlandscape that lives in the back of a group leader's mind as he contemplates\nstrategic targeting. We assume that this representation is a combination of the\nphysical geography of the target environment, and the mental and physical cost\nof following a seemingly random pattern of attacks. Focusing on the distance\nand time between attacks and taking into consideration the transaction costs\nthat state boundaries impose, we wish to understand what constrains a group\nleader to attack at a location other than the one that would seem to yield the\ngreatest overt payoff. By its very nature, the research problem defies the\ncollection of a full set of structural data. Instead, we leverage functional\ndata from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) dataset\nthat, inter alia, meticulously catalogues violent extremist incidents in North\nand West Africa since 1997, to generate a network whose nodes are\nadministrative regions. These nodes are connected by edges of qualitatively\ndifferent types: undirected edges representing geographic distance, undirected\nedges representing borders, and directed edges representing consecutive attacks\nby the same group at the two endpoints. We analyze the resulting network using\nnovel spectral embedding techniques that are able to account fully for the\ndifferent types of edges. The result is a map of North and West Africa that\ndepicts the permeability to violence. A better understanding of how location,\ntime, and borders condition attacks enables planning, prepositioning, and\nresponse.\n", "  This article examines the structure and spatial patterns of violent political\norganizations in the Sahel-Sahara, a region characterized by growing political\ninstability over the last 20 years. Drawing on a public collection of\ndisaggregated data, the article uses network science to represent alliances and\nconflicts of 179 organizations that were involved in violent events between\n1997 and 2014. To this end, we combine two spectral embedding techniques that\nhave previously been considered separately: one for directed graphs\n(relationships are asymmetric), and one for signed graphs (relationships are\npositive or negative). Our result show that groups that are net attackers are\nindistinguishable at the level of their individual behavior, but clearly\nseparate into pro- and anti-political violence based on the groups to which\nthey are close. The second part of the article maps a series of 389 events\nrelated to nine Trans-Saharan Islamist groups between 2004 and 2014. Spatial\nanalysis suggests that cross-border movement has intensified following the\nestablishment of military bases by AQIM in Mali but reveals no evidence of a\nborder sanctuary. Owing to the transnational nature of conflict, the article\nshows that national management strategies and foreign military interventions\nhave profoundly affected the movement of Islamist groups.\n", "  Curved thin sheets are ubiquitously found in nature and manmade structures.\nWithin the framework of classical thin plate theory, the stiffness of thin\nsheets is independent of its bending state. This assumption, however, goes\nagainst intuition. Simple experiments with a cantilever sheet made of paper\nshow that the cantilever stiffness largely increases with the transversal\ncurvature. We here demonstrate by using simple geometric arguments that thin\nsheets subject to two-dimensional bending necessarily develop internal\nstresses. The coupling between the internal stresses and the bending moments\ncan increase the stiffness of the plate by several times. We develop a theory\nthat describes the stiffness of curved thin sheets with simple equations in\nterms of the longitudinal and transversal curvatures. The theory perfectly fits\nexperimental results with a macroscopic cantilever sheet as well as numerical\nsimulations by the finite element method. The results shed new light on plant\nand insect wing biomechanics and provide an easy route to engineer micro- and\nnanomechanical structures based on ultrathin materials with extraordinary\nstiffness tunability.\n", "  We propose a quantum algorithm that emulates the action of an unknown unitary\ntransformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown\nsample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The\nalgorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be\nemulated, or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown\nunitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs\nin a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic\nin D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d,\nthe dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore,\nthe sample complexity of the algorithm, i.e. the total number of copies of the\nsample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm, is independent of D, and\npolynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and the sample complexity of\nincoherent methods, i.e. methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The\nalgorithm is blind, in the sense that at the end it does not learn anything\nabout the given samples, or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as\na subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.\n", "  We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to\nsolve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth\nParticle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared/distributed-memory architectures.\nSWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on\nboth commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0\nsystems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized\naccelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational\napproaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which\nprovides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers\nof cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to\ndecompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the\ndata, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed\nacross all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which\ncommunication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme,\nsending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from\nother nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to\nbe re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the\ntask-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60% parallel\nefficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores\n512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.\n", "  Data analysis of the next generation effective antineutrino mass measurement\nexperiment KATRIN requires reliable knowledge of systematic corrections. In\nparticular, the width of the daughter molecular ion excitation spectrum\nrovibrational band should be known with a better then 1% precision. Very\nprecise ab initio quantum calculations exist, and we compare them with the well\nknown tritium molecule parameters within the framework of a phenomenological\nmodel. The rovibrational band width with accuracy of a few percent is\ninterpreted as a result of the zero-point atomic oscillation in the harmonic\npotential. The Morse interatomic potential is used to investigate the impact of\nanharmonic atomic oscillations. The calculated corrections cannot account for\nthe difference between the ab initio quantum calculations and the\nphenomenological model.\n", "  The article considers an opportunity of simultaneous pulsed acceleration of\nseven proton beams with current one hundred milliamps in each beam. The\naccelerator consists of two parts. In the first part of the accelerator having\nthe length five meters, the protons are accelerated to the energy of mega\nelectron Volts. Consumption of high-frequency power by this part of the\naccelerator is equal to mega Watts. In the second part of the accelerator\nhaving the length fifty meters, the protons are accelerated to the finite\nenergy eighty mega electron Volts. Consumption of the high frequency power by\nthe second part of the accelerator is seventy fours mega Watts. The radial\nfocus of the proton beam in the first and second parts of the accelerator is\ncarried out with the magnetic field ten Tesla which is generated by a\nsuperconducting solenoid.\n", "  We propose a multiple descriptor multiple kernel (MultiDK) method for\nefficient molecular discovery using machine learning. We show that the MultiDK\nmethod improves both the speed and the accuracy of molecular property\nprediction. We apply the method to the discovery of electrolyte molecules for\naqueous redox flow batteries. Using \\emph{multiple-type - as opposed to\nsingle-type - descriptors}, more relevant features for machine learning can be\nobtained. Following the principle of the 'wisdom of the crowds', the\ncombination of multiple-type descriptors significantly boosts prediction\nperformance. Moreover, MultiDK can exploit irregularities between molecular\nstructure and property relations better than the linear regression method by\nemploying multiple kernels - more than one kernel functions for a set of the\ninput descriptors. The multiple kernels consist of the Tanimoto similarity\nfunction and a linear kernel for a set of binary descriptors and a set of\nnon-binary descriptors, respectively. Using MultiDK, we achieve average\nperformance of $r^2 = 0.92$ with a set of molecules for solubility prediction.\nWe also extend MultiDK to predict pH-dependent solubility and apply it to\nsolubility estimation of quinone molecules with ionizable functional groups as\nstrong candidates of flow battery electrolytes.\n", "  The present work theoretically studies the possibility to hinder the\nformation of a \"dead\" layer at the interfaces in manganite superlattices. We\nshowed that this goal can be reached by using alkaline-earth simple oxides as\nalternating layers in very thin superlattices. Indeed, such alternating layer\npromotes the contraction of manganite layers at the interfaces and\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ preferred $e_g$ orbital occupancy, while Boltzman's transport\ncalculations show an increase in conductivity. This result hold for different\nmanganites, different alkaline-earth simple oxides as well as different\nthicknesses of the two layers.\n", "  Optical coatings are widespread in everyday life, from camera lenses to\nglasses, to complex optics experiments. A simple, reliable device that can\nquickly and inexpensively analyze optical coatings is a valuable laboratory\ntool. Such a device can identify unknown or mislabelled optics, and\ncharacterize the transmission spectra of optical elements used in an\nexperiment. We present the design and characterization of a LED-based\nspectrophotometer, and demonstrate its ability to identify different optical\ncoatings. Our approach uses ten LEDs that cover a spectrum from 365 nm to 1000\nnm. A small servomotor and microcontroller rotates a LED board to sequentially\nposition each LED over an optical sample, and the transmitted light\ncorresponding to each LED is measured with a silicon photodetector. The device\nis automated, portable, inexpensive, user-friendly and simple to build.\n", "  The inner boundary of a black hole accretion disk is often set to the\nmarginally stable circular orbit (or the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO)\naround the black hole. It is important for the theories of black hole accretion\ndisks and their applications to astrophysical black hole systems.\nTraditionally, the marginally stable circular orbit is obtained by considering\nthe equatorial motion of a test particle around a black hole. However, in\nreality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the\npressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid\npressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black\nholes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the\nthermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location\nof marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test\nparticle case. However, we demonstrate that in some special cases the\nmarginally stable circular orbit can be different when the fluid pressure is\nlarge and the thermal energy becomes non-negligible comparing with the rest\nenergy. We present our results for both the cases of non-spinning and spinning\nblack holes. The influences of our results on the black hole spin parameter\nmeasurement in X-ray binaries and the energy release efficiency of accretion\nflows around black holes are discussed.\n", "  The appearance of a fundamental long-time asymptotic regime in the two space\none time dimensional hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (HNLS) equation is\ndiscussed. Based on analytical and extensive numerical simulations an\napproximate self-similar solution is found for a wide range of initial\nconditions -- essentially for initial lumps of small to moderate energy. Even\nrelatively large initial amplitudes, which imply strong nonlinear effects,\neventually lead to local structures resembling those of the self-similar\nsolution, with appropriate small modifications. These modifications are\nimportant in order to properly capture the behavior of the phase of the\nsolution. This solution has aspects that suggest it is a universal attractor\nemanating from wide ranges of initial data.\n", "  Amorphous nanoparticles (NPs) of diacetylene (DA) molecules were prepared by\nusing a reprecipitation method. After crystallization through solvent-vapor\nannealing process, the highly crystalline DA NPs show different structural and\noptical characteristics compared with the amorphous DA NPs. The single crystal\nstructure of DA NPs was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HR-TEM) and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The luminescence\ncolor and photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of the DA NPs were measured\nusing color charge-coupled device (CCD) images and high-resolution laser\nconfocal microscope (LCM). The crystalline DA NPs emit bright green light\nemission compared with amorphous DA NPs and the main PL peak of the crystalline\nDA NPs exhibits relative narrow and blue shift phenomena due to enhanced\ninteraction between DA molecular in the nano-size crystal structure.\n", "  In this paper we construct a special class of four dimensional axissymmetric\nstationary spacetimes whose Ricci scalar is constant in the Boyer-Lindquist\ncoordinates. The first step is to construct Einstein metric by solving a\nmodified Ernst equation for nonzero cosmological constant. Then, we modify the\nprevious result by adding two additional functions to the metric to obtain a\nmore general metric of constant scalar curvature which are not Einstein.\n", "  The fundamental solution of the Dirac equation for an electron in an\nelectromagnetic field with harmonic dependence on space-time coordinates is\nobtained. The field is composed of three standing plane harmonic waves with\nmutually orthogonal phase planes and the same frequency. Each standing wave\nconsists of two eigenwaves with different complex amplitudes and opposite\ndirections of propagation. The fundamental solution is obtained in the form of\nthe projection operator defining the subspace of solutions to the Dirac\nequation. It is illustrated by the analysis of the ground state and the spin\nprecession of the Dirac electron in the field of two counterpropagating plane\nwaves with left and right circular polarizations. Interrelations between the\nfundamental solution and approximate partial solutions is discussed and a\ncriterion for evaluating accuracy of approximate solutions is suggested.\n", "  We proposed a new way, adding intertube atoms, to enhance interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) between SiC-carbon nanotube (CNT) array structure.\nNon-equilibrium molecular dynamics method was used to study the ITC. The\nresults show that the intertube atoms can significantly enhance the ITC. The\ndependence of ITC on both the temperature and the number of intertube atoms are\nshown. The mechanism is analyzed by calculating probability distributions of\natomic forces and vibrational density of states. Our study may provide some\nguidance on enhancing the ITC of CNT-based composites.\n", "  The spreading of a thin film of suspension on a spinning disk and the\naccompanying contact line instability is studied through flow visualization\nexperiments. The critical radius for the onset of instability shows an increase\nwith increase in the particle fraction ($\\phi_{p}$) before decreasing slightly\nat the highest value of $\\phi_{p}$ studied, while the instability wavelength\n($\\lambda$) exhibits a non-monotonic dependence. The value of $\\lambda$ is\nclose to that for a partially wetting liquid at lower $\\phi_{p}$, it decreases\nwith increasing $\\phi_{p}$ to a minimum before increasing again at largest\n$\\phi_{p}$. The non-monotonic trends observed for $\\lambda$ are discussed in\nlight of the linear stability analysis of thin film equations derived for\nsuspensions by Cook {\\it et al.} [Linear stability of particle-laden thin\nfilms, Eur. Phys. J.: Spec. Top. {\\bf 166}, 77 (2009)] and Balmforth {\\it et\nal.} [Surface tension driven fingering of a viscoplastic film, J. Non Newtonian\nFluid Mech. {\\bf 142}, 143 (2007)].\n", "  The coordination polyhedra around the cations are the building blocks of\nionic solids. In context of amorphous InGaZn oxide (a-IGZO), even though the\ncoordination polyhedra are irregularly arranged, it will be beneficial to\nidentify them. In this work, we address the questions, (a) is it possible to\nclassify all the polyhedra that occur in a-IGZO into only a few distinct\ngroups? and (b) are these the same polyhedral motifs as those observed in the\ncrystalline indium gallium zinc oxide (c-IGZO) or other related crystalline\noxides of indium, gallium and zinc? Therefore, in this first principles based\nstudy, a large number (ten) of equivalent samples of a-IGZO were prepared by ab\ninitio melt-and-quench molecular dynamics, so that several distinct samples of\nthe amorphous landscape are obtained. The combination of all these structures\nthus obtained is a better representation of a real a-IGZO sample. For the ten\nsamples containing 360 cations, we propose a simpler and more accurate method\nfor determining the coordination number of each polyhedron, which was verified\nby charge density plots. Based on a method of comparing bond angles between\nmetal and oxygen atoms, the identified polyhedra were matched to the polyhedral\nmotifs present in the related crystalline systems, such as, InGaZnO4, In2O3,\nGa2O3 and ZnO. We find, the a-IGZO primarily consists of the following\npolyhedra: a tetrahedron from space group 199 and an octahedron from space\ngroup 206 of In2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 12 and an octahedron from\nspace group 167 of Ga2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 186 of ZnO; zinc and\ngallium trigonal bipyramids from c-IGZO; and one zinc 4-fold, one zinc 5-fold\nand one indium 5-fold coordination polyhedra that occur only in the amorphous\nphase. We are able to reduce the description of structure from 360 to 10 groups\nof polyhedra. The benefits of this identification could be enormous.\n", "  We describe a method to compute the inverse Mellin transform of holonomic\nsequences, that is based on a method to compute the Mellin transform of\nholonomic functions. Both methods are implemented in the computer algebra\npackage HarmonicSums.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of Janus\nparticles, micro- or nanoparticles which are not spherically symmetric, in the\nuniform flow of a simple liquid. In particular we consider spheres with an\nasymmetry in the solid-liquid interaction over their surfaces and calculate the\nforces and torques experienced by the particles as a function of their\norientation with respect to the flow. We also examine particles that are\ndeformed slightly from a spherical shape. We compare the simulation results to\nthe predictions of a previously introduced theoretical approach, which computes\nthe forces and torques on particles with variable slip lengths or aspherical\ndeformations that are much smaller than the particle radius. We find that there\nis good agreement between the forces and torques computed from our simulations\nand the theoretical predictions, when the slip condition is applied to the\nfirst layer of liquid molecules adjacent to the surface.\n", "  Using a recent geochemical reconstruction of the Phanerozoic climate which\nexhibits a 32 Ma oscillation with a phase and the secondary modulation expected\nfrom the vertical the motion of the solar system perpendicular to the galactic\nplane (shaviv et al. 2014), we show that a kinematically cold strongly\ninteracting disk dark matter (dDM) component is necessarily present in the\ndisk. It has a local density $\\rho_\\mathrm{dDM} = 0.11 \\pm 0.03$\nM$_{\\odot}/$pc$^3$. It is also consistent with the observed constraints on the\ntotal gravitating mass and the baryonic components, and it is the natural value\nborne from the Toomre stability criterion. It also has surface density\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{dDM} = 15 \\pm 5$ M$_{\\odot}/$pc$^2$ and a vertical velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_{W} = 8.0 \\pm 4.5$ km/s. A dense (\"dinosaur killing\")\nthin disk is ruled out. The \"normal\" halo dark matter (hDM) component should\nthen have a local density $\\rho_\\mathrm{hDM} \\lesssim 0.01$ M$_{\\odot}/$pc$^3$.\nIf the dDM component follows the baryons, its average density parameter is\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{dDM} = 1.5 \\pm 0.5\\%$ and it comprises about 1/8 to 1/4 of\nMilky Way (MW) mass within the solar circle.\n", "  Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study of air-physisorbed defective\ncarbon nano-onions evidences in favor of microwave assisted formation of\nweakly-bound paramagnetic complexes comprising negatively-charged O2- ions and\nedge carbon atoms carrying pi-electronic spins. These complexes being located\non the graphene edges are stable at low temperatures but irreversibly\ndissociate at temperatures above 50-60 K. These EPR findings are justified by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrating transfer of an\nelectron from the zigzag edge of graphene-like material to oxygen molecule\nphysisorbed on the graphene sheet edge. This charge transfer causes changing\nthe spin state of the adsorbed oxygen molecule from S = 1 to S = 1/2 one. DFT\ncalculations show significant changes of adsorption energy of oxygen molecule\nand robustness of the charge transfer to variations of the graphene-like\nsubstrate morphology (flat and corrugated mono- and bi-layered graphene) as\nwell as edges passivation. The presence of H- and COOH- terminated edge carbon\nsites with such corrugated substrate morphology allows formation of ZE-O2-\nparamagnetic complexes characterized by small (<50 meV) binding energies and\nalso explains their irreversible dissociation as revealed by EPR.\n", "  We present the analysis of the spin vector orientation of 5$\\,$987 SDSS\ngalaxies having negative redshift from $-$87.6 to $-$0.3 km$\\,$s$^{-1}$. Two\ndimensional observed parameters are used to compute three dimensional galaxy\nrotation axes by applying `position angle--inclination' method. We aim to\nexamine the non-random effects in the spatial orientation of blue-shifted\ngalaxies. We generate 5$\\times$10$^6$ virtual galaxies to find expected\nisotropic distributions by performing numerical simulations. We have written\nMATLAB program to facilitate the simulation process and eliminate the manual\nerrors in the process. Chi-square, auto-correlation, and the Fourier tests are\nused to examine non-random effects in the polar and azimuthal angle\ndistributions of the galaxy rotation axes. In general, blue-shifted galaxies\nshow no preferred alignments of galaxy rotation axes. Our results support\nHierarchy model, which suggests a random orientation of angular momentum\nvectors of galaxies. However, local effects are noted suggesting gravitational\ntidal interaction between neighboring galaxies.\n", "  Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (UOT) is a technique that images\noptical contrast deep inside scattering media. Heterodyne holography is a\npromising tool able to detect the UOT tagged photons with high efficiency. In\nthis work, we describe theoretically the detection of the tagged photon in\nheterodyne holography based UOT, show how to filter the untagged photon\ndiscuss, and discuss the effect of speckle decorrelation. We show that optimal\ndetection sensitivity can obtain, if the frame exposure time is of the order of\nthe decorrelation time.\n", "  We suggest other decays which can more effectively identify the effect of\nrotational motion and presence of the magnetic field, compared to\n$\\Lambda,\\bar\\Lambda$ hyperon decayse used so far.\n", "  Direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets requires high contrast imaging\ncapability and high angular resolution. Primary mirror segmentation is a key\ntechnological solution for large-aperture telescopes because it opens the path\ntoward significantly increasing the angular resolution. The segments are kept\naligned by an active optics system that must reduce segment misalignments below\ntens of nm RMS to achieve the high optical quality required for astronomical\nscience programs. The development of cophasing techniques is mandatory for the\nnext generation of space- and ground-based segmented telescopes, which both\nshare the need for increasing spatial resolution. We propose a new focal plane\ncophasing sensor that exploits the scientific image of a coronagraphic\ninstrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments. The\nself-coherent camera phasing sensor (SCC-PS) adequately combines the SCC\nproperties to segmented telescope architectures with adapted segment\nmisalignment estimators and image processing. An overview of the system\narchitecture, and a thorough performance and sensitivity analysis, including a\nclosed-loop efficiency, are presented by means of numerical simulations. The\nSCC-PS estimates simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments and corrects\nthem in closed-loop operation. The SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the\nsignal at the segment boundaries or any dedicated optical path. It has a\nmoderate sensitivity to misalignments, virtually none to pupil shear, and is\ninsensitive to segment gaps and edge effects. Primary mirror phasing can be\nachieved with bright natural guide star. The SCC-PS is a noninvasive concept\nand an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. It is an attractive\ncandidate for segment cophasing at the instrument level or alternatively at the\ntelescope level, as usually envisioned in current space- and ground-based\nobservatories.\n", "  Electron tomography in materials science has flourished with the demand to\ncharacterize nanoscale materials in three dimensions (3D). Access to\nexperimental data is vital for developing and validating reconstruction methods\nthat improve resolution and reduce radiation dose requirements. This work\npresents five high-quality scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)\ntomography datasets in order to address the critical need for open access data\nin this field. The datasets represent the current limits of experimental\ntechnique, are of high quality, and contain materials with structural\ncomplexity. Included are tomographic series of a hyperbranched Co2P\nnanocrystal, platinum nanoparticles on a carbon nanofibre imaged over the\ncomplete 180{\\deg} tilt range, a platinum nanoparticle and a tungsten needle\nboth imaged at atomic resolution by equal slope tomography, and a through-focal\ntilt series of PtCu nanoparticles. A volumetric reconstruction from every\ndataset is provided for comparison and development of post-processing and\nvisualization techniques. Researchers interested in creating novel data\nprocessing and reconstruction algorithms will now have access to state of the\nart experimental test data.\n", "  The difference between quantum isoenergetic process and quantum isothermal\nprocess comes from the violation of the law of equipartition of energy in the\nquantum regime. To reveal an important physical meaning of this fact, here we\nstudy a special type of quantum heat engine consisting of three processes:\nisoenergetic, isothermal and adiabatic processes. Therefore, this engine works\nbetween the energy and heat baths. Combining two engines of this kind, it is\npossible to realize the quantum Carnot engine. Furthermore, considering finite\nvelocity of change of the potential shape, here an infinite square well with\nmoving walls, the power output of the engine is discussed. It is found that the\nefficiency and power output are both closely dependent on the initial and final\nstates of the quantum isothermal process. The performance of the engine cycle\nis shown to be optimized by control of the occupation probability of the ground\nstate, which is determined by the temperature and the potential width. The\nrelation between the efficiency and power output is also discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the pure bending of plates within the framework of\nmodified couple stress theory (M-CST) and consistent couple stress theory\n(C-CST). In this development, it is demonstrated that M-CST does not describe\npure bending of a plate properly. Particularly, M-CST predicts no\ncouple-stresses and no size effect for the pure bending of the plate into a\nspherical shell. This contradicts our expectation that couple stress theory\nshould predict some size effect for such a deformation pattern. Therefore, this\nresult clearly demonstrates another inconsistency of indeterminate symmetric\nmodified couple stress theory (M-CST), which is based on considering the\nsymmetric torsion tensor as the curvature tensor. On the other hand, the fully\ndeterminate skew-symmetric consistent couple stress theory (C-CST) predicts\nresults for pure plate bending that tend to agree with mechanics intuition and\nexperimental evidence. Particularly, C-CST predicts couple-stresses and size\neffects for the pure bending of the plate into a spherical shell, which\nrepresents an additional illustration of its consistency.\n", "  Stability of oxygen point defects in Ruddlesden-Popper oxides\n(La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$)$_{2}$MO$_{4{\\pm}{\\delta}}$ (M = Co, Ni, Cu) is studied\nwith density functional theory calculations to determine their stable sites,\ncharge states, and energetics as functions of Sr content ($x$), transition\nmetal (M) and defect concentration ({\\delta}). We demonstrate that the dominant\nO point defects can change between oxide interstitials, peroxide interstitials,\nand vacancies. Generally, increasing $x$ and atomic number of M stabilizes\nperoxide over oxide interstitials, as well as vacancies over both peroxide and\noxide interstitials; increasing {\\delta} destabilizes both oxide interstitials\nand vacancies, but affects little peroxide interstitials. We also demonstrate\nthat the O 2$p$-band center is a powerful descriptor for these materials and\ncorrelates linearly with the formation energy of all the defects. The trends of\nformation energy versus $x$, M and {\\delta} and the correlation with O\n2$p$-band center are explained in terms of oxidation chemistry and electronic\nstructure.\n", "  In a study of the role that voltage-dependent K+ channels may have in the\nmechanosensation of living cells (Schmidt et al. Proc Soc Natl Acad Sci USA\n109: 10352-10357. 2012), the data were as conventionally done fitted by a\nBoltzmann function. However, as also found for other data for ion channels,\nthis interpretation must be rejected in favor of a multiphasic profile, a\nseries of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions, quite often in\nthe form of noncontiguities (jumps). The data points in the present study are\noften very unevenly distributed around the curvilinear profiles. Thus, for 43\nof the 75 profiles, the probability is less than 5% that the uneven\ndistribution is due to chance, for 26 the probability is less than 1%, and for\n12 the probability is less than 0.1%, giving a vanishingly low overall\nprobability for all profiles. Especially at low voltages, the differences\nbetween the fits to curvilinear and multiphasic profiles may be huge. In the\nmultiphasic profiles, adjacent lines are quite often parallel or nearly so, in\nwhich case the transitions are, necessarily, in the form of jumps. The lines in\nthe multiphasic profiles appear to be perfectly straight, with no indication of\nany curvilinearity. The r values are for the most part high, quite often\nexceedingly high. In addition to activation of ion channels, a wide variety of\nbiological as well as non-biological processes and phenomena involving binding,\npH, folding/unfolding and effect of chain length can be well represented by\nmultiphasic profiles (Nissen 2015a,b, 2016. Posted on arXiv.org with Paper ID\narXiv: 1511.06601, 1512.02561 and 1603.05144). Introduction\n", "  We investigate the continuous-variable entanglement swapping protocol in a\nnon-Gaussian setting, with non- Gaussian states employed either as entangled\ninputs and/or as swapping resources. The quality of the swapping protocol is\nassessed in terms of the teleportation fidelity achievable when using the\nswapped states as shared entangled resources in a teleportation protocol. We\nthus introduce a two-step cascaded quantum communication scheme that includes a\nswapping protocol followed by a teleportation protocol. The swapping protocol\nis fed by a general class of tunable non-Gaussian states, the squeezed Bell\nstates, which, by means of controllable free parameters, allows for a\ncontinuous morphing from Gaussian twin beams up to maximally non-Gaussian\nsqueezed number states. In the realistic instance, taking into account the\neffects of losses and imperfections, we show that as the input two-mode\nsqueezing increases, optimized non-Gaussian swapping resources allow for a\nmonotonically increasing enhancement of the fidelity compared to the\ncorresponding Gaussian setting. This result implies that the use of\nnon-Gaussian resources is necessary to guarantee the success of\ncontinuous-variable entanglement swapping in the presence of decoherence.\n", "  Molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, has recently gained considerable attention as a\nlayered material where neighboring layers are only weakly interacting and can\neasily slide against each other. Therefore, mechanical exfoliation allows the\nfabrication of single and multi-layers and opens the possibility to generate\natomically thin crystals with outstanding properties. In contrast to graphene,\nit has an optical gap of 1.9 eV. This makes it a prominent candidate for\ntransistor and opto-electronic applications. Single-layer MoS$_2$ exhibits\nremarkably different physical properties compared to bulk MoS$_2$ due to the\nabsence of interlayer hybridization. For instance, while the band gap of bulk\nand multi-layer MoS$_2$ is indirect, it becomes direct with decreasing number\nof layers. In this review, we analyze from a theoretical point of view the\nelectronic, optical, and vibrational properties of single-layer, few-layer and\nbulk MoS$_2$. In particular, we focus on the effects of spin-orbit interaction,\nnumber of layers, and applied tensile strain on the vibrational and optical\nproperties. We examine the results obtained by different methodologies, mainly\nab initio approaches. We also discuss which approximations are suitable for\nMoS$_2$ and layered materials. The effect of external strain on the band gap of\nsingle-layer MoS$_2$ and the crossover from indirect to direct band gap is\ninvestigated. We analyze the excitonic effects on the absorption spectra. The\nmain features, such as the double peak at the absorption threshold and the\nhigh-energy exciton are presented. Furthermore, we report on the phonon\ndispersion relations of single-layer, few-layer and bulk MoS$_2$. Based on the\nlatter, we explain the behavior of the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ and $E^1_{2g}$\nmodes as a function of the number of layers.\n", "  In this paper we investigate a class of natural Hamiltonian systems with two\ndegrees of freedom. The kinetic energy depends on coordinates but the system is\nhomogeneous. Thanks to this property it admits, in a general case, a particular\nsolution. Using this solution we derive necessary conditions for the\nintegrability of such systems investigating differential Galois group of\nvariational equations.\n", "  We study the optical counterparts of ultraluminous X-ray sources NGC4559 X-10\nand NGC4395 ULX-1. Their absolute magnitudes, after taking the reddening into\naccount, are $M_V \\approx -5.3$ and $M_V \\approx -6.2$, respectively. The\nspectral energy distribution of the NGC4559 X-10 counterpart is well fitted by\na spectrum of an F-type star, whereas NGC4395 ULX-1 has a blue power-law\nspectrum. Optical spectroscopy of NGC4395 ULX-1 has shown a broad and variable\nHeII~$\\lambda$4686 emission, which puts this object in line with all the other\nspectrally-studied ULXs. Using the Swift archival X-ray data for NGC4395 ULX-1,\nwe have found a period of $62.8\\pm 2.3$ days. The X-ray phase curve of the\nsource is very similar to the precession curve of SS433. The optical variation\nof the counterpart (between two accurate measurements) amounts to 0.10 mag.\nAnalyzing the absolute magnitudes of 16 well-studied ULX counterparts one may\nsuggest that as the original accretion rate decreases (but nevertheless remains\nsupercritical), the optical luminosity of the wind becomes dimmer and the donor\nstar dominates. However, an observational bias may also influence the\ndistribution.\n", "  The project OptoTracker aims to investigate a new approach to track charged\nparticles in a scintillating material, by using the optical signal. Our idea is\nto reconstruct the trajectory of a charged particle by collecting the\nscintillation light emitted along the path with pixelized photo-detectors. This\nwould permit to obtain an image of the track, similarly to what is done in a\nphotographic camera. Full 3D reconstruction is performed by using both the\ncharge distribution and the hit time information folded in a sophisticated\nreconstruction algorithm.\n  This solution, compared to \"traditional\" tracking methods, exploits the\nfastest information carrier within a material: the light. Therefore, an optical\ntracking detector would be intrinsically capable of sustaining a very high\ninteraction rate. Moreover, the intrinsic resolution would not be limited by\ncarriers diffusion, as happens in charge-transport based detectors. This new\ntechnology could have a very large impact both on beam experiments, thanks to\nthe possible increase in the acquisition rate, and in rare-physics experiments\n(double-$\\beta$ decay, dark-matter searches, neutrino oscillation searches),\nwhere the enhanced particle-id and directionality capability can provide\nsignificant background reduction.\n  This project has been presented to the INFN-Gruppo 5 call for young\nscientists in 2014, with positive result. It has been founded for the years\n2015-2016.\n", "  This paper seeks to find an explanation of the galactic cosmic ray B/C ratio\nnewly measured in cosmic rays between ~10 MeV/nuc and 1 TeV/nuc. Voyager\nmeasurements of this ratio at low energies and AMS-2 measurements at high\nenergies are used in this study. These measurements both considerably exceed at\nboth low and high energies the ratio predicted using a simple Leaky Box Model\nfor propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. Between 1-70 GeV/nuc, however,\nthis same model provides an excellent fit (within +2-3%) to the new AMS-2\nmeasurements using an escape length ~P-0.45. This would imply a diffusion\ncoefficient ~P0.45, very close to the Kraichian cascade value of 0.50 for the\nexponent. Extending this same diffusion dependence to high energies, still in a\nLBM, along with a truncation of short path lengths in the galaxy will predict a\nB/C ratio of 4.5% at ~800 GeV/nuc which is very close to the AMS-2 measurement\nat that energy. This would indicate that the amount of material traversed near\nthe source in a Nested LBM, for example, is less than about 0.5 g/cm2 at these\nenergies since this process, with additional matter near the sources, would\nincrease the B/C ratio. At low energies, however, the B/C ratio of 14% +3% at\n~10 MeV/nuc measured by Voyager is more difficult to explain. The same\nparameters used in a LBM that fit the high energy B/C measurements predicts a\nB/C ratio of only ~4% at 10 MeV/nuc where the path length is about 1.5 g/cm2.\nIf the cosmic rays have traversed ~10 g/cm2 of material in the galaxy at low\nenergies the prediction for B/C is still only 8%, which is between 2.0-3.0\nsigma below the measurement and its errors.\n", "  Short duration Gamma-Ray Bursts are thought to originate from the coalescence\nof neutron stars in binary systems. They are detected as a brief ($<$ 2s),\nintense flash of gamma-ray radiation followed by a weaker, rapidly decreasing\nafterglow. They are expected to be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo when\ntheir sensitivity will be low enough. In a recent study we identified a\npopulation of short Gamma-Ray Bursts that are intrinsically faint and nearby.\nHere we provide evidence in favor of the existence of this new population that\ncan hardly be reproduced with a model of field neutron star binary\ncoalescences. We propose that these systems may be produced dynamically in\nglobular clusters, and may result from the merger of a black hole and a neutron\nstar. The advanced LIGO and Virgo observation of a high rate of NSBH mergers\ncompatible with the dynamical formation in globular clusters would be a\nconfirmation of this hypothesis and would enable for the derivation of the mass\nfunction of black holes inside globular clusters, as well as the luminosity\nfunction of faint short GRBs.\n", "  The realistic probability distributions of a previous article are applied to\nthe reconstruction of tracks in constant magnetic field. The complete forms and\ntheir schematic approximations produce excellent momentum estimations,\ndrastically better than standard fits. A simplified derivation of one of our\nprobability distributions is illustrated. The momentum reconstructions are\ncompared with standard fits (least squares) with two different position\nalgorithms: the eta-algorithm and the two-strip center of gravity. The quality\nof our results are expressed as the increase of the magnetic field and\nsignal-to-noise ratio that overlap the standard fit reconstructions with ours\nbest distributions. The data and the simulations are tuned on the tracker of a\nrunning experiment and its double sided microstrip detectors, here each\ndetector side is simulated to measure the magnetic bending. To overlap with our\nbest distributions, the magnetic field must be increased by a factor 1.5 for\nthe least squares based on the eta-algorithm and 1.8 for the two-strip center\nof gravity for the low noise side, and 1.8 and 2.0 for the high noise side. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio must be increased by 1.6 for the low noise side and 2.2\nfor the high noise side (eta-algorithms). The fits, built on the positioning\nwith the center of gravity, are not modified by a reduction of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio.}\n", "  Optics is an important subfield of physics required for instrument design and\nused in a variety of other disciplines, including materials science, physics,\nand life sciences such as developmental biology and cell biology. It is\nimportant to educate students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds in\nthe basics of optics in order to train the next generation of interdisciplinary\nresearchers and instrumentalists who will push the boundaries of discovery. In\nthis paper, we present an experimental system developed to teach students in\nthe basics of geometric optics, including ray and wave optics. The students\nlearn these concepts through designing, building, and testing a home-built\nlight microscope made from component parts. We describe the experimental\nequipment and basic measurements students can perform to learn principles,\ntechnique, accuracy, and resolution of measurement. Students find the\nmagnification and test the resolution of the microscope system they build. The\nsystem is open and versatile to allow advanced building projects, such as\nepi-fluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence, and optical trapping.\nWe have used this equipment in an optics course, an advanced laboratory course,\nand graduate-level training modules.\n", "  We provide the first demonstration that a neutron far-field interferometer\ncan be employed to measure the microstructure of a sample. The interferometer\nis based on the moir\\'e pattern of two phase modulating gratings which was\npreviously realized in hard x-ray and visible light experiments. The\nautocorrelation length of this interferometer, and hence the microstructure\nlength scale that is probed, is proportional to the grating spacing and the\nneutron wavelength, and can be varied over several orders of magnitude for one\npair of gratings. We compare our measurements of the change in visibility from\nmonodisperse samples with calculations which show reasonable agreement. The\npotential advantages of a far-field neutron interferometer include high fringe\nvisibility in a polychromatic beam (over 30 %), no requirement for an absorbing\ngrating to resolve the interference fringes, and the ability to measure the\nmicrostructure in the length scale range of 100 nm to 10 \\mum by varying either\nthe grating spacing or neutron wavelength with a broad wavelength range and\nsingle set of gratings.\n", "  The icy mantles of interstellar dust grains are the birthplaces of the\nprimordial prebiotic molecular inventory that may eventually seed nascent solar\nsystems and the planets and planetesimals that form therein. Here, we present a\nstudy of two of the most abundant species in these ices after water: carbon\ndioxide (CO2) and methanol (CH3OH) using TeraHertz (THz) time-domain\nspectroscopy and mid-infrared spectroscopy. We study pure and mixed-ices of\nthese species, and demonstrate the power of the THz region of the spectrum to\nelucidate the long-range structure (i.e. crystalline versus amorphous) of the\nice, the degree of segregation of these species within the ice, and the thermal\nhistory of the species within the ice. Finally, we comment on the utility of\nthe THz transitions arising from these ices for use in astronomical\nobservations of interstellar ices.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the effect of different underground materials on\nvery-low and low frequency magnetic fields used in the contexts of\nmagneto-inductive localization and communication applications, respectively. We\ncalculate the attenuation that these magnetic fields are subject to while\npassing through most common rocks and minerals. Knowing the attenuation\nproperties is crucial in the design of underground magneto-inductive\ncommunication systems. In addition, we provide means to predict the distortions\nin the magnetic field that impair localization systems. The proposed work\noffers basic design guidelines for communication and localization systems in\nterms of channel path-loss, operation frequencies and bandwidth. For the sake\nof the reproducibility of the results, we provide the raw data and processing\nsource code to be used by the two research communities.\n", "  Let $A$ and $B$ be two $N$ by $N$ deterministic Hermitian matrices and let\n$U$ be an $N$ by $N$ Haar distributed unitary matrix. It is well known that the\nspectral distribution of the sum $H=A+UBU^*$ converges weakly to the free\nadditive convolution of the spectral distributions of $A$ and $B$, as $N$ tends\nto infinity. We establish the optimal convergence rate ${\\frac{1}{N}}$ in the\nbulk of the spectrum.\n", "  We construct the asymptotic approximation to the first eigenvalue and\ncorresponding eigensolution of Laplace's operator inside a domain containing a\ncloud of small rigid inclusions. The separation of the small inclusions is\ncharacterised by a small parameter which is much larger compared with the\nnominal size of inclusions. Remainder estimates for the approximations to the\nfirst eigenvalue and associated eigenfield are presented. Numerical\nillustrations are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the asymptotic\napproach compared to conventional numerical techniques, such as the finite\nelement method, for three-dimensional solids containing clusters of small\ninclusions.\n", "  (Abridged) We show that sizeable fractions of incident ionizing radiation\nfrom stochastic astrophysical sources can be redistributed to biologically and\nchemically important UV wavelengths, a significant fraction of which can reach\nthe surface. This redistribution is mediated by secondary electrons, resulting\nfrom Compton scattering and X-ray photoabsorption, with energies low enough to\nexcite atmospheric molecules and atoms, resulting in a rich aurora-like\nspectrum. We calculate the fraction of energy redistributed into biologically\nand chemically important wavelength regions for spectra characteristic of\nstellar flares and supernovae using a Monte-Carlo transport code written for\nthis problem and then estimate the fraction of this energy that is transmitted\nfrom the atmospheric altitudes of redistribution to the surface for a few\nillustrative cases. Redistributed fractions are found to be of order 1%, even\nin the presence of an ozone shield. This result implies that planetary\norganisms will be subject to mutationally significant, if intermittent,\nfluences of UV-B and harder radiation even in the presence of a narrow-band UV\nshield like ozone. We also calculate the surficial transmitted fraction of\nionizing radiation and redistributed ultraviolet radiation for two illustrative\nevolving Mars atmospheres whose initial surface pressures were 1 bar. Our\nresults suggest that coding organisms on planets orbiting low-mass stars (and\non the early Earth) may evolve very differently than on contemporary Earth,\nwith diversity and evolutionary rate controlled by a stochastically varying\nmutation rate and frequent hypermutation episodes.\n", "  We conduct molecular dynamics simulations of 887 and 1389-atom decahedral\nplatinum nanoparticles using an embedded atom potential. By constructing\nmicrocanonical caloric curves, we identify structural transitions from\ndecahedral to fcc in the particles prior to melting. The transitions take place\nduring phase coexistence and appear to occur via melting of the decahedral\nstructure and subsequent recrystallisation into the fcc structure.\n", "  We discuss the space-time structure for the process of decay of a bubble of\nhypothetic phase -- disoriented chiral condensate (DCC). The evolution of the\ninitial classical field configuration corresponding to the bubble of DCC is\nstudied both numerically and analytically. The process of decay of this initial\nconfiguration depends crucially on selfinteraction of the pionic fields. It is\nshown that in some cases this selfinteraction leads to the formation of sort of\nbreather solution, formed from pionic fields situated in the center of the\ninitial bubble of DCC. This breather looks like a long-lived source of pionic\nfields.\n", "  We investigate the interaction of two two-level atoms with a single mode\ncavity field. One of the atoms is exactly at resonance with the field, while\nthe other is well far from resonance and hence is treated in the dispersive\nlimit. We find that the presence of the non-resonant atom produces a shift in\nthe Rabi frequency of the resonant atom, as if it was detuned from the field.\nWe focus on the discussion of the evolution of the state purity of each atom.\n"]}
