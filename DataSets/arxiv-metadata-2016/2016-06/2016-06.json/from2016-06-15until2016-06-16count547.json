theory/particle experiment. We summarize the\nimportant progress made in recent years towards understanding high energy\nastrophysical processes and we survey the state of the art regarding the\nconcordance model of cosmology.\n", "  In the weak coupling limit, we establish the phase diagram of a two-leg\nladder with a unit cell containing both Cu and O atoms, as a function of\ndoping. We use bosonization and design a specific RG procedure to handle the\nadditional degrees of freedom. Significant differences are found with the\nsingle orbital case; for purely repulsive interactions, a completely massless\nquantum critical region is obtained at intermediate carrier concentrations\n(well inside the bands) where the ground state consists of an incommensurate\npattern of orbital currents plus a spin density wave (SDW) structure.\n", "  In the weak coupling limit, we investigate two-leg ladders with a unit cell\ncontaining both Cu and O atoms, as a function of doping. For purely repulsive\ninteractions, using bosonization, we find significant differences with the\nsingle orbital case: a completely massless quantum critical regime is obtained\nfor a finite range of carrier concentration. In a broad region of the phase\ndiagram the ground state consists of a pattern of orbital currents plus a\ndensity wave. NMR properties of the Cu and O nuclei are presented for the\nvarious phases.\n", "  Following two dictums roadmap of Einstein (one, for incorporation of maximum\nof empirical facts, and the other, on long continued experimental verifications\nfor perfecting a scientific theory) for future generations to make his General\nRelativity Theory (GRT) evolve to perfection, it is necessary to experimentally\nconfirm his concept on General relativistic nature of speed of light, c, which\nrelates to the variation of c under the influence of gravitational field, and\nwhose experimental confirmation is long overdue.\n  This paper gives the Execution and some Additional Details for the Space\nExperiment Proposed for GRT, so that any of the Space research organizations\n(viz., NASA, ESA, ASI, ISRO, etc.) would conduct this low cost experiment,\nduring Space missions to Mercury, Venus, or the sun, or may choose to conduct\nit as an independent space mission as the cost may be brought down by sending\nmicro satellites using the launch sharing facility of any other lending\ncountry. Even an advanced country may conduct this experiment at low cost by\nsending a micro satellite (called a co-passenger satellite) by arranging with\nthe Space research organization of any lending country, which is sending a\nprimary satellite for a space mission to any of the desired locations.\n  At present, even a small country interested in making a historic contribution\nfor making GRT of Einstein evolve, but not having a Space research\norganization, may contract with an experienced organization, or hire the\nservices of an experienced project director who\n  * can organize the planning, procurement, and launching of a micro satellite\ncarrying the laser device, from launch pad of another country (adopting the\npiggy back launching method), and\n  * can guide (else, can hire the services of a Principal Investigator, from\nsome renowned institute) remote operation of the laser device for a few days.\n", "  We study the influence of non magnetic impurities on the phase diagram of\ndoped two-leg Hubbard Cu-O ladders. In the absence of impurities this system\nposseses d-wave superconducting states and orbital current states depending on\nthe doping. A single, strong, scatterer modifies its environment locally and\nthis effect is assessed using a renormalization group analysis. At high doping,\ndisorder causes intraband instabilities and at low doping it promotes interband\ninstabilities. In the former case, we extend the boundary conformal field\ntheory method, developed in the context of single chains, to handle the ladder\nproblem, and we find exact closed-form analytical expressions for the\ncorrelation functions. This allows us to compute experimentally measurable\nlocal quantities such as the nuclear magnetic resonance line broadenings and\nscanning tunnelling microscope profiles. We also discuss the low doping regime\nwhere Kondo physics is at play, making qualitative predictions about its\nnature. Insight into collective effects is also given in the many weak\nimpurities case, based on an RG approach. In this regime, one sees the\ninterplay between interactions and disorder. We emphasize the influence of the\nO atoms on disorder effects both for the single- and for the many-defect\nsituations.\n", "  Non-minimally coupled scalar field models suffer of unstable growing modes at\nthe linear perturbation level. The nature of these instabilities depends on the\ndynamical state of the scalar field. In particular in systems which admit\nadiabatic solutions, large scale instabilities are suppressed by the slow-roll\ndynamics of the field. Here we review these results and present a preliminary\nlikelihood data analysis suggesting that along adiabatic solutions coupled\nmodels with coupling of order of gravitational strength can provide viable\ncosmological scenarios satisfying constraints from SN Ia, CMB and large scale\nstructure data.\n", "  We investigate the physical consequences of orbital current patterns (OCP) in\ndoped two-leg Cu-O Hubbard ladders. The internal symmetry of the pattern, in\nthe case of the ladder structure, differs slightly from that suggested so far\nfor cuprates. We focus on this OCP and look for measurable signatures of its\nexistence. We compute the magnetic field produced by the OCP at each lattice\nsite, and estimate its value in view of a possible experimental detection.\nUsing a renormalization group (RG) analysis, we determine the changes that are\ncaused by the SU(2) spin-rotational symmetry breaking which occurs when the OCP\nis present in the ground state phase diagram. The most signifcant one is an\nin-plane SDW gap opening in an otherwise critical phase, at intermediate\ndopings. We estimate the value of this gap, give an analytic expression for the\ncorrelation functions and examine some of the magnetic properties of this new\nphase which can be revealed in measurements. We compute the conductance in the\npresence of a single impurity, using an RG analysis. A discussion of the\nvarious sources of SU(2) symmetry breaking underscores the specificity of the\nOCP induced effects.\n", "  Cybersusy is a new mechanism for SUSY breaking. When the auxiliary fields are\nintegrated in any theory like the SSM, certain special new composite\nsuperfields arise. Spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry, like SU(2) X U(1)\nto U(1), gives rise to a new realization of SUSY for these new superfields.\nThis realization mixes elementary and composite states. In the resulting\neffective action, if the new superfield has mass, then there are SUSY\nanomalies. Since there are no massless supermultiplets, the SUSY anomalies must\nbe present. They generate a spectrum for SUSY breaking that is consistent with\nthe known particles. Supergravity does not couple to the anomalies because it\ndoes not couple to composite states. So unitarity is not violated. There is no\ncosmological constant generated, because SUSY is not spontaneously broken.\n", "  Multiplicity, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of hadrons\nproduced both in inelastic and nondiffractive $pp$ collisions at energies from\n$\\sqrt{s} = 200$\\,GeV to 14\\,TeV are studied within the Monte Carlo quark-gluon\nstring model (QGSM). Good agreement with the available experimental data up to\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13$\\,TeV is obtained, and predictions are made for the collisions\nat top LHC energy $\\sqrt{s} = 14$\\,TeV. The model indicates that Feynman\nscaling and extended longitudinal scaling remain valid in the fragmentation\nregions, whereas strong violation of Feynman scaling is observed at\nmidrapidity. The Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling in multiplicity\ndistributions is violated at LHC also. The origin of both maintenance and\nviolation of the scaling trends is traced to short range correlations of\nparticles in the strings and interplay between the multistring processes at\nultrarelativistic energies.\n", "  A proof of concept detector is presented for scintillation light detection in\nliquid argon using Silicon Photo-Multipliers. The aim of the work is to build\nan anti-Compton veto for germanium detectors operated directly in liquid argon\nlike in the GERDA experiment. Properties of the Multi-Pixel Photon Counter\n(MPPC) are studied at cryogenic temperatures. To increase the light collection\nefficiency of the MPPCs wavelength shifting fibers were used. A veto efficiency\ncomparable to a similar setup with a Photo-Multiplier Tube was achieved.\n", "  We examine the influence of collective excitations on the transport\nproperties (resistivity, magneto- optical conductivity) for semimetals,\nfocusing on the case of bismuth. We show, using an RPA approximation, that the\nproperties of the system are drastically affected by the presence of an\nacoustic plasmon mode, consequence of the presence of two types of carriers\n(electrons and holes) in this system. We found a crossover temperature T*\nseparating two different regimes of transport. At high temperatures T > T* we\nshow that Baber scattering explains quantitatively the DC resistivity\nexperiments, while at low temperatures T < T* interactions of the carriers with\nthis collective mode lead to a T^5 behavior of the resistivity. We examine\nother consequences of the presence of this mode, and in particular predict a\ntwo plasmon edge feature in the magneto-optical conductivity. We compare our\nresults with the experimental findings on bismuth. We discuss the limitations\nand extensions of our results beyond the RPA approximation, and examine the\ncase of other semimetals such as graphite or 1T-TiSe_2.\n", "  A hypothetical equation of motion is proposed for Kerr-Newman particles. It\nis obtained by analytic continuation of the Lorentz-Dirac equation into complex\nspace-time. A new class of \"runaway\" solutions are found which are similar to\nZitterbewegung. Electromagnetic fields generated by these motions are studied,\nand it is found that the retarded times are multi-sheeted functions of the\nfield points. This leads to non-uniqueness for the generated fields. It is\nfound that with fixed weighting factors for these multiple roots, the solutions\nradiate electromagnetic energy. If the weighting factors are allowed to be\nposition dependent, however, then it is possible to suppress radiation by\nsolving a differential equation for these factors which ensures that the\nsolution is a non-radiating electromagnetic source. Motion in response to\nexternal forces are also considered. Radiation suppression is possible here too\nin some cases. These results are relevant for the idea that Kerr-Newman\nsolutions provide insight into elementary particles and into emergent quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  A higher-order dispersive equation is introduced as a candidate for the\ngoverning equation of a field theory. A new class of solutions of the\nthree-dimensional field equation are considered, which are not localized\nfunctions in the sense of the integrability of the square of the profile over\nan infinite domain. For this new class of solutions, the gradient and/or the\nHessian/Laplacian are square integrable. In the linear limiting case, an\nanalytical expression for the pseudolocalized solution is found and the method\nof variational approximation is applied to find the dynamics of the centers of\nthe quasi-particles (QPs) corresponding to these solutions. A discrete\nLagrangian can be derived due to the localization of the gradient and the\nLaplacian of the profile. The equations of motion of the QPs are derived from\nthe discrete Lagrangian. The pseudomass (\"wave mass\") of a QP is defined as\nwell as the potential of interaction. The most important trait of the new QPs\nis that at large distances, the force of attraction is proportional to the\ninverse square of the distance between the QPs. This can be considered\nanalogous to the gravitational force in classical mechanics.\n", "  Molybdenum purple bronze Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$ is an exceptional\nmaterial known to exhibit one dimensional (1D) properties for energies down to\na few meV. This fact seems to be well established both in experiments and in\nband structure theory. We use the unusual, very 1-dimensional band dispersion\nobtained in \\emph{ab-initio} DFT-LMTO band calculations as our starting point\nto study the physics emerging below 300meV. A dispersion perpendicular to the\nmain dispersive direction is obtained and investigated in detail. Based on\nthis, we derive an effective low energy theory within the Tomonaga Luttinger\nliquid (TLL) framework. We estimate the strength of the possible interactions\nand from this deduce the values of the TLL parameters for charge modes. Finally\nwe investigate possible instabilities of TLL by deriving renormalization group\n(RG) equations which allow us to predict the size of potential gaps in the\nspectrum. While $2k_F$ instabilities strongly suppress each other, the $4k_F$\ninstabilities cooperate, which paves the way for a possible CDW at the lowest\nenergies. The aim of this work is to understand the experimental findings, in\nparticular the ones which are certainly lying within the 1D regime. We discuss\nthe validity of our 1D approach and further perspectives for the lower energy\nphases.\n", "  A brief review is given of all the Hamiltonians and effective potentials\ncalculated hitherto covering the post-Newtonian (pN) dynamics of a two body\nsystem. A method is presented to compare (conservative) reduced Hamiltonians\nwith nonreduced potentials directly at least up to the next-to-leading-pN\norder.\n", "  We explicitly derive the proper time $(\\tau)$ principal Lyapunov exponent\n($\\lambda_{p}$) and coordinate time ($t$) principal Lyapunov exponent\n($\\lambda_{c}$) for Reissner Nordstr{\\o}m (RN) black hole (BH) . We also\ncompute their ratio. For RN space-time, it is shown that the ratio is\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}=\\frac{r_{0}}{\\sqrt{r_{0}^2-3Mr_{0}+2Q^2}}$ for\ntime-like circular geodesics and for Schwarzschild BH it is\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{r_{0}}}{\\sqrt{r_{0}-3M}}$. We\nfurther show that their ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}$ may vary from\norbit to orbit. For instance, Schwarzschild BH at innermost stable circular\norbit(ISCO), the ratio is\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}\\mid_{r_{ISCO}=6M}=\\sqrt{2}$ and at marginally\nbound circular orbit (MBCO) the ratio is calculated to be\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}\\mid_{r_{mb}=4M}=2$. Similarly, for extremal RN\nBH the ratio at ISCO is\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{p}}{\\lambda_{c}}\\mid_{r_{ISCO}=4M}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe also further analyse the geodesic stability via this exponent. By evaluating\nthe Lyapunov exponent, it is shown that in the eikonal limit , the real and\nimaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes of RN BH is given by the frequency\nand instability time scale of the unstable null circular geodesics.\n", "  The energy spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays above 10$^{18}$ eV is\nmeasured using the hybrid events collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory\nbetween November 2005 and September 2010. The large exposure of the Observatory\nallows the measurement of the main features of the energy spectrum with high\nstatistics. Full Monte Carlo simulations of the extensive air showers (based on\nthe CORSIKA code) and of the hybrid detector response are adopted here as an\nindependent cross check of the standard analysis (Phys. Lett. B 685, 239\n(2010)). The dependence on mass composition and other systematic uncertainties\nare discussed in detail and, in the full Monte Carlo approach, a region of\nconfidence for flux measurements is defined when all the uncertainties are\ntaken into account. An update is also reported of the energy spectrum obtained\nby combining the hybrid spectrum and that measured using the surface detector\narray.\n", "  Some low surface brightness galaxies are known to have extremely thin stellar\ndisks with the vertical to planar axes ratio 0.1 or less, often referred to as\nsuperthin disks. Although their existence is known for over three decades, the\nphysical origin for the thin distribution is not understood. We model the\nstellar thickness for a two-component (gravitationally coupled stars and gas)\ndisk embedded in a dark matter halo, for a superthin galaxy UGC 7321 which has\na dense, compact halo, and compare with a typical dwarf galaxy HoII which has a\nnon-compact halo. We show that while the presence of gas does constrain the\ndisk thickness, it is the compact dark matter halo which plays the decisive\nrole in determining the superthin disk distribution in low-mass disks. Thus the\ncompact dark matter halo significantly affects the disk structure and this\ncould be important for the early evolution of galaxies.\n", "  With focus on anharmonic chains, we develop a nonlinear version of\nfluctuating hydrodynamics, in which the Euler currents are kept to second order\nin the deviations from equilibrium and dissipation plus noise are added. The\nrequired model-dependent parameters are written in such a way that they can be\ncomputed numerically within seconds, once the interaction potential, pressure,\nand temperature are given. In principle the theory is applicable to any\none-dimensional system with local conservation laws. The resulting nonlinear\nstochastic field theory is handled in the one-loop approximation. Some of the\nlarge scale predictions can still be worked out analytically. For more details\none has to rely on numerical simulations of the corresponding mode-coupling\nequations. In this way we arrive at detailed predictions for the equilibrium\ntime correlations of the locally conserved fields of an anharmonic chain.\n", "  Beta-ensembles of random matrices are naturally considered as quantum\nintegrable systems, in particular, due to their relation with conformal field\ntheory, and more recently appeared connection with quantized Painlev\\'e\nHamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that, at least for {\\it even integer} beta,\nthese systems are classically integrable, e.g. there are Lax pairs associated\nwith them, which we explicitly construct. To come to the result, we show that a\nsolution of every Fokker-Planck equation in one space (and one time) dimensions\ncan be considered as a component of an eigenvector of a Lax pair. The explicit\nfinding of the Lax pair depends on finding a solution of a governing system --\na closed system of two nonlinear PDEs of hydrodynamic type. This result\nsuggests that there must be a solution for all values of beta. We find the\nsolution of this system for even integer beta in the particular case of quantum\nPainlev\\'e II related to the soft edge of the spectrum for beta-ensembles. The\nsolution is given in terms of Calogero system of $\\beta/2$ particles in an\nadditional time-dependent potential. Thus, we find another situation where\nquantum integrability is reduced to classical integrability.\n", "  We relate the collective dynamic internal geometric degrees of freedom to the\ngauge fluctuations in $\\nu=1/m$(m odd) fractional quantum Hall effects. In this\nway, in the lowest Landau level, a highly nontrivial quantum geometry in\ntwo-dimensional guiding center space emerges from these internal geometric\nmodes. Using the Dirac bracket method, we find that this quantum geometric\nfield theory is a topological non-commutative Chern-Simons theory.Topological\nindices, such as the guiding center angular momentum (also called the shift)\nand the guiding center spin, which characterize the fractional quantum Hall\n(FQH) states besides the filling factor, are naturally defined. A\nnoncommutative K-matrix Chern-Simons theory is proposed as a generalization to\na large class of Abelian FQH topological orders.\n", "  Starbugs are miniature piezoelectric 'walking' robots with the ability to\nsimultaneously position many optical fibres across a telescope's focal plane.\nTheir simple design incorporates two piezoceramic tubes to form a pair of\nconcentric 'legs' capable of taking individual steps of a few microns, yet with\nthe capacity to move a payload several millimetres per second. The Australian\nAstronomical Observatory has developed this technology to enable fast and\naccurate field reconfigurations without the inherent limitations of more\ntraditional positioning techniques, such as the 'pick and place' robotic arm.\nWe report on our recent successes in demonstrating Starbug technology, driven\nprincipally by R&D efforts for the planned MANIFEST (many instrument\nfibre-system) facility for the Giant Magellan Telescope. Significant\nperformance gains have resulted from improvements to the Starbug system,\nincluding i) the use of a vacuum to attach Starbugs to the underside of a\ntransparent field plate, ii) optimisation of the control electronics, iii) a\nsimplified mechanical design with high sensitivity piezo actuators, and iv) the\nconstruction of a dedicated laboratory 'test rig'. A method of reliably\nrotating Starbugs in steps of several arcminutes has also been devised, which\nintegrates with the pre-existing x-y movement directions and offers greater\nflexibility while positioning. We present measured performance data from a\nprototype system of 10 Starbugs under full (closed-loop control), at field\nplate angles of 0-90 degrees.\n", "  We analyze the connectivity of an $M$-layer network over a common set of\nnodes that are active only in a fraction of the layers. Each layer is assumed\nto be a subgraph (of an underlying connectivity graph $G$) induced by each node\nbeing active in any given layer with probability $q$. The $M$-layer network is\nformed by aggregating the edges over all $M$ layers. We show that when $q$\nexceeds a threshold $q_c(M)$, a giant connected component appears in the\n$M$-layer network---thereby enabling far-away users to connect using `bridge'\nnodes that are active in multiple network layers---even though the individual\nlayers may only have small disconnected islands of connectivity. We show that\n$q_c(M) \\lesssim \\sqrt{-\\ln(1-p_c)}\\,/{\\sqrt{M}}$, where $p_c$ is the bond\npercolation threshold of $G$, and $q_c(1) \\equiv q_c$ is its site percolation\nthreshold. We find $q_c(M)$ exactly for when $G$ is a large random network with\nan arbitrary node-degree distribution. We find $q_c(M)$ numerically for various\nregular lattices, and find an exact lower bound for the kagome lattice.\nFinally, we find an intriguingly close connection between this multilayer\npercolation model and the well-studied problem of site-bond percolation, in the\nsense that both models provide a smooth transition between the traditional site\nand bond percolation models. Using this connection, we translate known\nanalytical approximations of the site-bond critical region, which are functions\nonly of $p_c$ and $q_c$ of the respective lattice, to excellent general\napproximations of the multilayer connectivity threshold $q_c(M)$.\n", "  Using the most advanced model of the hadron resonance gas we reveal, at\nchemical freeze-out, remarkable irregularities such as an abrupt change of the\neffective number of degrees of freedom and plateaus in the collision-energy\ndependence of the entropy per baryon, total pion number per baryon, and thermal\npion number per baryon at laboratory energies 6.9-11.6 AGeV. On the basis of\nthe generalized shock adiabat model we show that these plateaus give evidence\nfor the thermodynamic anomalous properties of the mixed phase at its boundary\nto the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). A new signal for QGP formation is suggested\nand justified.\n", "  Spin models are used in many studies of complex systems---be it condensed\nmatter physics, neural networks, or economics---as they exhibit rich\nmacroscopic behaviour despite their microscopic simplicity.\n  Here we prove that all the physics of every classical spin model is\nreproduced in the low-energy sector of certain `universal models'.\n  This means that (i) the low energy spectrum of the universal model reproduces\nthe entire spectrum of the original model to any desired precision, (ii) the\ncorresponding spin configurations of the original model are also reproduced in\nthe universal model, (iii) the partition function is approximated to any\ndesired precision, and (iv) the overhead in terms of number of spins and\ninteractions is at most polynomial.\n  This holds for classical models with discrete or continuous degrees of\nfreedom.\n  We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a spin model to be\nuniversal, and show that one of the simplest and most widely studied spin\nmodels, the 2D Ising model with fields, is universal.\n", "  Social learning -by observing and copying others- is a highly successful\ncultural mechanism for adaptation, outperforming individual information\nacquisition and experience. Here, we investigate social learning in the context\nof the uniquely human capacity for reflective, analytical reasoning. A hallmark\nof the human mind is our ability to engage analytical reasoning, and suppress\nfalse associative intuitions. Through a set of lab-based network experiments,\nwe find that social learning fails to propagate this cognitive strategy. When\npeople make false intuitive conclusions, and are exposed to the analytic output\nof their peers, they recognize and adopt this correct output. But they fail to\nengage analytical reasoning in similar subsequent tasks. Thus, humans exhibit\nan 'unreflective copying bias,' which limits their social learning to the\noutput, rather than the process, of their peers' reasoning -even when doing so\nrequires minimal effort and no technical skill. In contrast to much recent work\non observation-based social learning, which emphasizes the propagation of\nsuccessful behavior through copying, our findings identify a limit on the power\nof social networks in situations that require analytical reasoning.\n", "  The Church-Turing thesis is one of the pillars of computer science; it\npostulates that every classical system has equivalent computability power to\nthe so-called Turing machine. While this thesis is crucial for our\nunderstanding of computing devices, its implications in other scientific fields\nhave hardly been explored. Here we start this research programme in the context\nof quantum physics and show that computer science laws have profound\nimplications for some of the most fundamental results of the theory. We first\nshow how they question our knowledge on what a mixed quantum state is, as we\nidentify situations in which ensembles of quantum states defining the same\nmixed state, indistinguishable according to the quantum postulates, do become\ndistinguishable when prepared by a computer. We also show a new loophole for\nBell-like experiments: if some of the parties in a Bell-like experiment use a\ncomputer to decide which measurements to make, then the computational resources\nof an eavesdropper have to be limited in order to have a proper observation of\nnon-locality. Our work opens a new direction in the search for a framework\nunifying computer science and quantum physics.\n", "  Neutrino signals in electron-capture decays of hydrogen-like parent ions P in\nstorage-ring experiments at GSI are reconsidered, with special emphasis placed\non the storage-ring quasi-circular motion of the daughter ions D in two-body\ndecays P --> D + e-neutrino. It is argued that to the extent that daughter ions\nare detected, these detection rates might exhibit modulations with periods of\norder seconds, similar to those reported in the GSI storage-ring experiments\nfor two-body decay rates [1,2]. New dedicated experiments in storage rings, or\nusing traps, could explore these modulations.\n", "  The orbital motion of a binary system is characterized by various\ncharacteristic temporal intervals which, by definition, are different from each\nother: the draconitic, anomalistic and sidereal periods. They all coincide in\nthe Keplerian case. Such a degeneracy is removed, in general, when a\npost-Keplerian acceleration is present. We analytically work out the\ncorrections to such otherwise Keplerian periods which are induced by general\nrelativity (Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring) and, at the Newtonian level, by\nthe quadrupole of the primary. In many astronomical and astrophysical systems,\nlike exoplanets, one of the most accurately determined quantities is just the\ntime span characterizing the orbital revolution, which is often measured\nindependently with different techniques like the transit photometry and the\nradial velocities. Thus, our results could be useful, in principle, to either\nconstrain the physical properties of the central body and/or perform new tests\nof general relativity, especially when no other standard observables like,\ne.g., the orbital precessions are accessible to observations. The difference of\ntwo independently measured periods would cancel out the common Keplerian term\nleaving just a post-Keplerian correction. Furthermore, by comparing the\ntheoretically predicted post-Keplerian expressions $T^{(\\textrm{pK})}$ with the\nexperimental accuracy $\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}$ in measuring the orbital\nperiod(s) it is possible to identify those systems whose observations should be\nre-processed with genuine post-Keplerian models if\n$T^{(\\textrm{pK})}>\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}$. It seems just the case for WASP-33\nb since $\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}=0.04$ s, while $3$ s$\\leq\nT_\\textrm{dra}^{(J_2)}\\leq 9.5$ s, $T_\\textrm{dra}^{(\\textrm{GE)}}=0.36$ s.\n", "  Although random cell complexes occur throughout the physical sciences, there\ndoes not appear to be a standard way to quantify their statistical similarities\nand differences. The various proposals in the literature are usually motivated\nby the analysis of particular physical systems and do not necessarily apply to\ngeneral situations. The central concepts in this paper---the swatch and the\ncloth---provide a description of the local topology of a cell complex that is\ngeneral (any physical system that may be represented as a cell complex is\nadmissible) and complete (any statistical question about the local topology may\nbe answered from the cloth). Furthermore, this approach allows a distance to be\ndefined that measures the similarity of the local topology of two cell\ncomplexes. The distance is used to identify a steady state of a model\ndislocation network evolving by energy minimization, and then to rigorously\nquantify the approach of the simulation to this steady state.\n", "  In this research we obtain the classical r-matrices of real two and three\ndimensional Jacobi-Lie bialgebras. In this way, we classify all non-isomorphic\nreal two and three dimensional coboundary Jacobi-Lie bialgebras and their types\n(triangular and quasitriangular). Also, we obtain the generalized Sklyanin\nbracket formula by use of which, we calculate the Jacobi structures on the\nrelated Jacobi-Lie groups. Finally, we present a new method for constructing\nclassical integrable systems using coboundary Jacobi-Lie bialgebras.\n", "  We investigate thin films of conducting aluminium-oxide, also known as\ngranular aluminium, as a material for superconducting high quality, high\nkinetic inductance circuits. The films are deposited by an optimised reactive\nDC magnetron sputter process and characterised using microwave measurement\ntechniques at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We show that, by precise control of\nthe reactive sputter conditions, a high room temperature sheet resistance and\ntherefore high kinetic inductance at low temperatures can be obtained. For a\ncoplanar waveguide resonator with 1.5\\,k$\\Omega$ sheet resistance and a kinetic\ninductance fraction close to unity, we measure a quality factor in the order of\n700\\,000 at 20\\,mK. Furthermore, we observe a sheet resistance reduction by\ngentle heat treatment in air. This behaviour is exploited to study the kinetic\ninductance change using the microwave response of a coplanar wave guide\nresonator. We find the correlation between the kinetic inductance and the sheet\nresistance to be in good agreement with theoretical expectations.\n", "  We develop a scenario to engineer a topological phase with Majorana edge\nstates based on an integer quantum Hall (QH) system proximity coupled to a\nsuperconductor (SC). Due to the vortices in the SC order parameter, the SC - QH\nhybrid system is described by a Bloch problem with ten unpaired momenta,\ncorresponding to the maxima and saddle points of the SC order parameter. For\nexternal potentials respecting the symmetry of the vortex lattice, the states\nwith unpaired momenta have degeneracies such that the system always is in a\ntrivial phase. However, an incommensurate potential can lift the degeneracies\nand drive the system into a topologically nontrivial phase.\n", "  Future dark energy experiments will require better and more accurate\ntheoretical predictions for the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) signature\nin the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. Here, we use large N-body\nsimulations of the \\LambdaCDM Planck cosmology to study any possible systematic\nshifts and damping in BAO due to the impact of nonlinear gravitational growth\nof structure, scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-space\ndistortions. The effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing the\ntracer power spectrum by that from a BAO-free simulation starting with the same\nphases. This permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%\nfor dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine BAO\nwavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the\npower spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.\nFor dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of\n\\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor D(z). For halo samples, with\nbias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a typical BAO shift of ~0.25%,\nobserved in real-space, which does not show an appreciable evolution with\nredshift within the uncertainties. Moreover, we report a constant shift as a\nfunction of halo bias. We find a different evolution of the damping of the\nacoustic feature in all halo samples as compared to dark matter with haloes\nsuffering less damping, and also find some weak dependence on bias. A larger\nBAO shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can be well explained\nby linear theory due to redshift-space distortions. A clear modulation in phase\nwith the acoustic scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to the\npresence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.\n", "  We present a scheme for the construction of quantum states of vortex like\ntopological excitations corresponding to spin- 1/2 strongly XY anisotropic\nnearest neighbor Heisenberg Ferromagnet on two dimensional lattice. The\nprocedure involving Pauli spin basis states is carried out corresponding to\nboth infinite dilute limit and finite density limit of vortex/anti-vortex. It\nis found that the corresponding quantum mechanical states representing charge 1\nquantum vortices/ anti-vortices can be expressed as linear combinations of\nsingle magnon states, composite multi-magnon states and the ground state.\nDetailed calculations show that these states are quantum mechanically stable\nstates of the Hamiltonian only when the system size exceeds certain threshold\nvalue. Our analysis indicates that the interactions between different magnon\nmodes can very well generate these topological excitations. Possible\napplications of our calculations to real magnetic systems are also discussed.\nMagnetic measurements probing spin dynamics may be undertaken to verify the\nexistence of the threshold size for the stability of vortices.\n", "  We analyze the low energy NN interaction by confronting statistical vs\nsystematic uncertainties. This is carried out with the help of model potentials\nfitted to the Granada-2013 database where a statistically meaningful partial\nwave analysis comprising a total of $6713$ np and pp published scattering data\nfrom 1950 till 2013 below $350 {\\rm MeV}$ has been made. We extract threshold\nparameters uncertainties from the coupled channel effective range expansion up\nto $j \\le 5$. We find that for threshold parameters systematic uncertainties\nare generally at least an order of magnitude larger than statistical\nuncertainties. Similar results are found for np phase-shifts and amplitude\nparameters.\n", "  Accurately predicting structural properties of dark matter halos is one of\nthe fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the new suite of MultiDark\ncosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density\nprofiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. The MultiDark simulations\ncover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15Msun and volumes upto 50Gpc**3. The\ntotal number of dark matter halos in all the simulations exceeds 60 billion. We\nfind that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make\n~1% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo\nconcentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius\nto the core radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density\nprofile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the\ncore radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation.\nCombining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show\nthat halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They start as rare\ndensity peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial\ninfall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo.\nHere, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the\nconcentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core\nradius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion\nbecomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region.\nNow the concentration does not depend on halo mass. (3) Once the rate of\naccretion slows down, halos move into the domain of declining\nconcentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the\nvirial radius while the core radius is staying constant. We provide accurate\nanalytical fits to the numerical results for halo density profiles and\nconcentrations.\n", "  We have proposed a scheme of multi-qubit \\textit{quantum random access\nmemory} (qRAM) based on the impedance matched photon echo quantum memory\nincorporated together with the control three-level atom in two coupled QED\ncavities. A set of matching conditions for basic physical parameters of the\nqRAM scheme that provides an efficient quantum control of the fast single\nphoton storage and read-out has been found. In particular, it was found that\nthe qRAM operation is determined by the properties of the photonic molecular\nrealized in the qRAM dynamics. Herein, the maximal efficiency of the qRAM is\nachieved when the cooperativety parameter of the photonic molecular equals to\nunity that can be easily experimentally implemented. The quantum address of the\nstored photonic qubits can be put into practice when the address is encoded in\nphotonic multi-time-bin state. We discuss the advantages of the qRAM in terms\nof working with multi-qubit states and the implementation by current quantum\ntechnologies in the optical and microwave domains.\n", "  Open many-body quantum systems play an important role in quantum optics and\ncondensed-matter physics, and capture phenomena like transport, interplay\nbetween Hamiltonian and incoherent dynamics, and topological order generated by\ndissipation. We introduce a versatile and practical method to numerically\nsimulate one-dimensional open quantum many-body dynamics using tensor networks.\nIt is based on representing mixed quantum states in a locally purified form,\nwhich guarantees that positivity is preserved at all times. Moreover, the\napproximation error is controlled with respect to the trace norm. Hence, this\nscheme overcomes various obstacles of the known numerical open-system evolution\nschemes. To exemplify the functioning of the approach, we study both stationary\nstates and transient dissipative behaviour, for various open quantum systems\nranging from few to many bodies.\n", "  There is longstanding fundamental interest in 6-fold coordinated $d^6$\n($t_{2g}^6$) transition metal complexes such as [Ru(bpy)$_3$]$^{2+}$ and\nIr(ppy)$_3$, particularly their phosphorescence. This interest has increased\nwith the growing realisation that many of these complexes have potential uses\nin applications including photovoltaics, imaging, sensing, and light-emitting\ndiodes. In order to design new complexes with properties tailored for specific\napplications a detailed understanding of the low-energy excited states,\nparticularly the lowest energy triplet state, $T_1$, is required. Here we\ndescribe a model of pseudo-octahedral complexes based on a pseudo-angular\nmomentum representation and show that the predictions of this model are in\nexcellent agreement with experiment - even when the deviations from octahedral\nsymmetry are large. This model gives a natural explanation of zero-field\nsplitting of $T_1$ and of the relative radiative rates of the three sublevels\nin terms of the conservation of time-reversal parity and total angular momentum\nmodulo two. We show that the broad parameter regime consistent with the\nexperimental data implies significant localization of the excited state.\n", "  We show how in principle a coherent coupling between two superconductors of\nopposite parity can be realized in a three-layer oxide heterostructure. Due to\nstrong intraionic spin-orbit coupling in the middle layer, singlet Cooper pairs\nare converted into triplet ones and vice versa. This results in a large\nenhancement of the triplet superconductivity, persisting well above the native\ntriplet critical temperature.\n", "  We calculate the phase diagram of the SU($N$) Hubbard model describing\nfermionic alkaline earth atoms in a square optical lattice with on-average one\natom per site, using a slave-rotor mean-field approximation. We find that the\nchiral spin liquid predicted for $N\\ge5$ and large interactions passes through\na fractionalized state with a spinon Fermi surface as interactions are\ndecreased before transitioning to a weakly interacting metal. We also show that\nby adding an artificial uniform magnetic field with flux per plaquette\n$2\\pi/N$, the chiral spin liquid becomes the ground state for all $N\\ge 3$ at\nlarge interactions, persists to weaker interactions, and its spin gap\nincreases, suggesting that the spin liquid physics will persist to higher\ntemperatures. We discuss potential methods to realize the artificial gauge\nfields and detect the predicted phases.\n", "  We calculate the Kadowaki-Woods ratio (KWR) in Fermi liquids with arbitrary\nband structures. We find that, contrary to the single band case, the ratio is\nnot generally independent of the effects of electronic correlations\n(universal). This is very surprising given the experimental findings of a near\nuniversal KWR in many multiband metals. We identify a limit where the\nuniversality of the ratio, which has been observed experimentally in many\nstrongly correlated electron systems, is recovered. We discuss the KWR in Dirac\nsemimetals in two and three dimensions. In the two-dimensional case we also\ngeneralize the KWR to account for the logarithmic factor in the self-energy. In\nboth cases we find that the KWR is independent of correlations, but strongly\ndependent on the doping of the system: for massless fermions the KWR is\nproportional to the inverse square of the carrier density, whereas the KWR for\nsystems with massive quasiparticles is proportional to the inverse of the\ncarrier density.\n", "  Recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (Tc = 190 K) in sulfur\nhydrides at megabar pressures breaks the traditional belief on the Tc limit of\n40 K for conventional superconductors, and open up the doors in searching new\nhigh-temperature superconductors in compounds made up of light elements.\nSelenium is a sister and isoelectronic element of sulfur, with a larger atomic\ncore and a weaker electronegativity. Whether selenium hydrides share similar\nhigh-temperature superconductivity remains elusive, but it is a subject of\nconsiderable interest. First-principles swarm structure predictions are\nperformed in an effort to seek for energetically stable and metallic selenium\nhydrides at high pressures. We find the phase diagram of selenium hydrides is\nrather different from its sulfur analogy, which is indicates by the emergence\nof new phases and the change of relative stabilities. Three stable and metallic\nspecies with stoichiometries of HSe2, HSe and H3Se are identified above ~120\nGPa and they all exhibit superconductive behaviors, of which the hydrogen-rich\nHSe and H3Se phases show high Tc in the range of 40-110 K. Our simulations\nestablished the high-temperature superconductive nature of selenium hydrides\nand provided useful route for experimental verification.\n", "  We consider a vector bundle $E$ over a compact Riemannian manifold\n$M$=$M^{n}$,$n\\geq 4$,and $A$ is a Yang-Mills connection with $L^{\\frac{n}{2}}$\ncurvature $F_{A}$ on $E$.Then we prove a mean value inequality for the density\n$|F_{A}|^{\\frac{n}{2}}$.This inequality give rise to an energy concentrate\nprinciple for sequences of solutions that have bounded energy.We also proof\nthat the energy must be bounded from below by some positive constant unless $E$\nis a flat bundle.\n", "  Scaling up linear-optics quantum computing will require multi-photon gates\nwhich are compact, phase-stable, exhibit excellent quantum interference, and\nhave success heralded by the detection of ancillary photons. We investigate\nimplementation of the optimal known gate design which meets these requirements:\nthe Knill controlled-Z gate, implemented in integrated laser-written waveguide\narrays. We show that device performance is more sensitive to the small\ndeviations in the coupler reflectivity, arising due to the tolerance values of\nthe fabrication method, than phase variations in the circuit. The mode fidelity\nwas also shown to be less sensitive to reflectivity and phase errors than\nprocess fidelity. Our best device achieves a fidelity of 0.931+/-0.001 with the\nideal 4x4 unitary circuit and a process fidelity of 0.680+/-0.005 with the\nideal computational-basis process.\n", "  The ratio of total mass $M$ to surface radius $R$ of spherical perfect fluid\nball has an upper bound, $M/R < B$. Buchdahl obtained $B = 4/9$ under the\nassumptions; non-increasing mass density in outward direction, and barotropic\nequation of states. Barraco and Hamity decreased the Buchdahl's bound to a\nlower value $B = 3/8$ $(< 4/9)$ by adding the dominant energy condition to\nBuchdahl's assumptions. In this paper, we further decrease the Barraco-Hamity's\nbound to $B \\simeq 0.3636403$ $(< 3/8)$ by adding the subluminal\n(slower-than-light) condition of sound speed. In our analysis, we solve\nnumerically Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and the mass-to-radius ratio\nis maximized by variation of mass, radius and pressure inside the fluid ball as\nfunctions of mass density.\n", "  We provide an approximate zero $\\widetilde{S}(g,L)$ for the hyperbolic\nKepler's equation $S-g\\, {\\rm asinh} (S)-L=0$ for $g\\in(0,1)$ and\n$L\\in[0,\\infty)$. We prove, by using Smale's $\\alpha$-theory, that Newton's\nmethod starting at our approximate zero produces a sequence that converges to\nthe actual solution $S(g,L)$ at quadratic speed, i.e. if $S_n$ is the value\nobtained after $n$ iterations, then $|S_n-S|\\leq 0.5^{2^n-1}|\\widetilde{S}-S|$.\nThe approximate zero $\\widetilde{S}(g,L)$ is a piecewise-defined function\ninvolving several linear expressions and one with cubic and square roots. In\nbounded regions of $(0,1) \\times [0,\\infty)$ that exclude a small neighborhood\nof $g=1, L=0$, we also provide a method to construct simpler starters involving\nonly constants.\n", "  The so-called black hole shadow is a dark region which is expected to appear\nin a fine image of optical observation of black holes. It is essentially an\nabsorption cross section of black hole, and the boundary of shadow is\ndetermined by unstable circular orbits of photons (UCOP). If there exists a\ncompact object possessing UCOP but no black hole horizon, it can provide us\nwith the same shadow image with black holes, and a detection of shadow image\ncannot be a direct evidence of black hole existence. Then, this paper examine\nwhether or not such compact objects can exist under some suitable conditions.\nWe investigate thoroughly the static spherical polytropic ball of perfect fluid\nwith single polytrope index, and then investigate a representative example of\nthe piecewise polytropic ball. Our result is that the spherical polytropic ball\nwhich we have investigated cannot possess UCOP, if the sound speed at center is\nsubluminal (slower-than-light). This means that, if the polytrope treated in\nthis paper is a good model of stellar matter in compact objects, the detection\nof shadow image is regarded as a good evidence of black hole existence. As a\nby-product, we have found the upper bound of the mass-to-radius radio (M/R) of\npolytropic ball with single index, M/R < 0.281, under the\nsubluminal-sound-speed condition.\n", "  For spherical symmetry, we provide expressions for the radial null-null\ncomponents of the generalized Einstein tensor $E_{ab}$ for Lovelock models for\ndiagonal $E_{ab}$ in terms of the metric and of the radial null-null components\nof the Ricci tensor. We show they can be usefully employed for example in\nobtaining the Birkhoff-like theorem for Lovelock models, as well as in\nproviding a relation between the null energy and null convergence conditions\nfor the same models.\n", "  We study the superfluidity of single component dipolar Fermi gases in three\ndimensions within a pairing fluctuation theory. The transition temperature\n$T_{c}$ for the dominant $p_z$ wave superfluidity exhibits a remarkable\nre-entrant behavior as a function of the pairing strength induced by the\ndipole-dipole interaction (DDI), which leads to an anisotropic pair dispersion.\nThe anisotropy and the long range nature of the DDI cause $T_c$ to vanish for a\nnarrow range of intermediate interaction strengths, where a pair density wave\nstate emerges as the ground state. The superfluid density and thermodynamics\nbelow $T_{c}$, along with the density profiles in a harmonic trap, are\ninvestigated as well, throughout the BCS-BEC crossover. Implications for\nexperiments are discussed.\n", "  In this paper we study the nonlinear current response of $U(1)$ spin liquids\nwith large spinon Fermi surfaces under the perturbation of a time-dependent ac\nelectric field $\\mathbf{E}(t)$ within the framework of an effective $U(1)$\ngauge theory. In particular, the third-order nonlinear current response to ac\nelectric fields is derived. We show that as in the case of linear current\nresponse, an in-gap power-law ($\\sim\\omega^{\\eta}$) response is found for the\nnonlinear current at low frequency. The nonlinear susceptibility may also\ninduce through process of third harmonic generation propagating EM wave with\nfrequency $3\\omega$ inside the spin liquids.\n", "  The first direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the ground-based\ninterferometers is expected to occur within the next few years. These\ninterferometers will detect the mergers of compact object binaries composed of\nneutron stars and/or black holes to a fiducial distance of ~200 Mpc and a\nlocalization region of ~100 sq. deg. To maximize the science gains from such GW\ndetections it is essential to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The\nmost promising such counterpart is optical/IR emission powered by the\nradioactive decay of r-process elements synthesized in the neutron-rich merger\nejecta - a \"kilonova\". Here we present detailed simulated observations that\nencompass a range of strategies for kilonova searches during GW follow-up. We\nassess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them\nfrom a wide range of contaminating transients. We find that if pre-existing\ntemplate images for the localization region are available, then nightly\nobservations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%\ndetection rate; observations that commence within 12 hours of trigger will also\ncapture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta\nproperties. We also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other\ntypes of transients utilizing cuts on color (i-z > 0 mag) and rise time (< 4\ndays). In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1\nmag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of\ncontaminants can still be achieved. Motivated by the results of our simulations\nwe discuss the expected performance of current and future wide-field telescopes\nin achieving these observational goals, and find that prior to LSST the Dark\nEnergy Camera on the Blanco 4-m telescope and Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru\n8-m telescope offer the best kilonova discovery potential.\n", "  We present an analysis of anomaly detection for machine learning redshift\nestimation. Anomaly detection allows the removal of poor training examples,\nwhich can adversely influence redshift estimates. Anomalous training examples\nmay be photometric galaxies with incorrect spectroscopic redshifts, or galaxies\nwith one or more poorly measured photometric quantity. We select 2.5 million\n'clean' SDSS DR12 galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and 6730\n'anomalous' galaxies with spectroscopic redshift measurements which are flagged\nas unreliable. We contaminate the clean base galaxy sample with galaxies with\nunreliable redshifts and attempt to recover the contaminating galaxies using\nthe Elliptical Envelope technique. We then train four machine learning\narchitectures for redshift analysis on both the contaminated sample and on the\npreprocessed 'anomaly-removed' sample and measure redshift statistics on a\nclean validation sample generated without any preprocessing. We find an\nimprovement on all measured statistics of up to 80% when training on the\nanomaly removed sample as compared with training on the contaminated sample for\neach of the machine learning routines explored. We further describe a method to\nestimate the contamination fraction of a base data sample.\n", "  It is notoriously difficult to apply statistical mechanics to generally\ncovariant systems, because the notions of time, energy and equilibrium are\nseriously modified in this context. We discuss the conditions under which\nweaker versions of these notions can be defined, sufficient for statistical\nmechanics. We focus on reparametrization-invariant systems without additional\ngauges. The key is to reconstruct statistical mechanics from the ergodic\ntheorem. We find that a suitable split of the system into two non interacting\ncomponents is sufficient for generalizing statistical mechanics. While\nequilibrium acquires sense only when the system admits a suitable split into\nthree weakly interacting components ---roughly: a clock and two systems among\nwhich a generalization of energy is equi-partitioned. This allows the\napplication of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics as an additivity\ncondition of such generalized energy.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on the quantum-spin-liquid candidate material\nLiZn2Mo3O8, we study a single-band extended Hubbard model on an anisotropic\nKagome lattice with the 1/6 electron filling. Due to the partial filling of the\nlattice, the inter-site repulsive interaction is necessary to generate Mott\ninsulators, where electrons are localized in clusters, rather than at lattice\nsites. It is shown that these cluster Mott insulators are generally U(1)\nquantum spin liquids with spinon Fermi surfaces. The nature of charge\nexcitations in cluster Mott insulators can be quite different from conventional\nMott insulator and we show that there exists a novel cluster Mott insulator\nwhere charge fluctuations around the hexagonal cluster induce a plaquette\ncharge order (PCO). The spinon excitation spectrum in this spin-liquid cluster\nMott insulator is reconstructed due to the PCO so that only 1/3 of the total\nspinon excitations are magnetically active. Based on these results, we propose\nthat the two Curie-Weiss regimes of the spin susceptibility in LiZn2Mo3O8 may\nbe explained by finite-temperature properties of the cluster Mott insulator\nwith the PCO as well as fractionalized spinon excitations. Existing and\npossible future experiments on LiZn2Mo3O8, and other Mo-based cluster magnets\nare discussed in light of these theoretical predictions.\n", "  We provide the solution of the classical theory for the Higgs sector of the\nStandard Model obtaining the exact Green function for the broken phase. Solving\nthe Dyson-Schwinger equations for the Higgs field we show that the propagator\ncoincides with that of the classical theory confirming the spectrum also at the\nquantum level. In this way we obtain a proof of triviality using the\nK\\\"allen-Lehman representation. This has as a consequence that higher excited\nstates must exist for the Higgs particle, representing an internal spectrum for\nit. Higher excited states have exponentially smaller amplitudes and so, their\nproduction rates are significantly depressed.\n", "  We consider a two-component asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a\nfinite lattice with reflecting boundary conditions. For this process, which is\nequivalent to the ASEP with second-class particles, we construct the\nrepresentation matrices of the quantum algebra $U_q[\\mathfrak{gl}(3)]$ that\ncommute with the generator. As a byproduct we prove reversibility and obtain in\nexplicit form the reversible measure. A review of the algebraic techniques used\nin the proofs is given.\n", "  We propose a new method to estimate the photometric redshift of galaxies by\nusing the full galaxy image in each measured band. This method draws from the\nlatest techniques and advances in machine learning, in particular Deep Neural\nNetworks. We pass the entire multi-band galaxy image into the machine learning\narchitecture to obtain a redshift estimate that is competitive with the best\nexisting standard machine learning techniques. The standard techniques estimate\nredshifts using post-processed features, such as magnitudes and colours, which\nare extracted from the galaxy images and are deemed to be salient by the user.\nThis new method removes the user from the photometric redshift estimation\npipeline. However we do note that Deep Neural Networks require many orders of\nmagnitude more computing resources than standard machine learning\narchitectures.\n", "  The conformally invariant symmetric traceless field $A$ is considered on\nconformally flat Einstein space-time. If $d=4$ this field possess a scalar\ngauge invariance. In that case, we provide a conformally invariant gauge\ncondition which generalizes in a simple manner, on those space-time, the\nEastwood-Singer gauge condition. A field strength $F$ is built upon the\npotential $A$, its properties are worked out in details, giving raise to a new\nset of conformally invariant equations.\n", "  We extend recent results on scalar-tensor theories to the case of an\nO(N)-invariant multiplet. Some exact fixed point solutions of the RG flow\nequations are discussed. We find that also in the functional context, on\nemploying a standard \"type-I\" cutoff, too many scalars destroy the\ngravitational fixed point. For d=3 we show the existence of the gravitationally\ndressed Wilson-Fisher fixed point also for N>1. We discuss also the results of\nthe analysis for a different, scalar-free, coarse-graining scheme.\n", "  Generalised Hagedorn wave packets appear as exact solutions of Schr\\\"odinger\nequations with quadratic, possibly complex, potential, and are given by a\npolynomial times a Gaussian. We show that the Wigner transform of generalised\nHagedorn wave packets is a wave packet of the same type in phase space. The\nproofs build on a parametrisation via Lagrangian frames and a detailed analysis\nof the polynomial prefactors, including a novel Laguerre connection. Our\nfindings directly imply the recently found tensor product structure of the\nWigner transform of Hagedorn wave packets.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of a trapped ion immersed in a\nspatially localized buffer gas. For a homogeneous buffer gas, the ion reaches a\nstable equilibrium only if the mass ratio of the buffer gas atom to the ion is\nbelow a critical value. We show how this limitation can be overcome by using\nmultipole traps and a spatially confined buffer gas. Using a generalized model\nfor elastic collisions of the ion with the buffer gas atoms, the ion's energy\ndistribution is derived for arbitrary buffer gas distributions and trap\nparameters. Three regimes characterized by the analytical form of the ion's\nenergy distribution are found. Final ion temperatures down to the millikelvin\nregime can be achieved even for heavy buffer gases by actively controlling the\nsize of the buffer gas or the trap voltage (forced sympathetic cooling).\n", "  Although quantum walks exhibit peculiar properties that distinguish them from\nrandom walks, classical behavior can be recovered in the asymptotic limit by\ndestroying the coherence of the pure state associated to the quantum system.\nHere I show that this is not the only way: I introduce a quantum walk driven by\nan inhomogeneous, time-dependent coin operator, which mimics the statistical\nproperties of a random walk at all time scales. The quantum particle undergoes\nunitary evolution and, in fact, the high correlation evidenced by the\ncomponents of the wave function can be used to revert the outcome of an\naccidental measurement of its chirality.\n", "  Thermodynamics provides powerful constraints on physical and chemical systems\nin equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium dynamics depends explicitly on\nmicroscopic properties, requiring an understanding beyond thermodynamics.\nRemarkably, in dilute gases, a set of universal relations is known to connect\nthermodynamics directly with microscopic properties. So far, these \"contact\"\nrelations have been established only for interactions with $s$-wave symmetry,\ni.e., without relative angular momentum. We report measurements of two new\nphysical quantities, the \"$p$-wave contacts\", and present evidence that they\nencode the universal aspects of $p$-wave interactions through recently proposed\nrelations. Our experiments use an ultracold Fermi gas of $^{40}$K, in which\n$s$-wave interactions are suppressed by polarising the sample, while $p$-wave\ninteractions are enhanced by working near a scattering resonance. Using\ntime-resolved spectroscopy, we study how correlations in the system develop\nafter \"quenching\" the atoms into an interacting state. Combining\nquasi-steady-state measurements with new contact relations, we infer an\nattractive $p$-wave interaction energy as large as half the Fermi energy. Our\nresults reveal new ways to understand and characterise the properties of a\nresonant $p$-wave quantum gas.\n", "  We study spin-orbit coupling in metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the\nmany-body Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework. For a well defined\nsub-class of metallic CNTs, that contains both achiral zig-zag as well as a\nsub-set of chiral tubes, an effective low energy field theory description is\nderived. We aim to describe system at finite dopings, but close to the charge\nneutrality point (commensurability). A new regime is identified where\nspin-orbit coupling leads to an inverted hierarchy of mini-gaps of bosonic\nmodes. We then add a proximity coupling to a superconducting (SC) substrate and\nshow that the only order parameter that is supported within the novel,\nspin-orbit induced phase is a topologically trivial s-SC.\n", "  The current hierarchical merging paradigm and $\\Lambda$CDM predict that the\n$z \\sim 4-8$ universe should be a time in which the most massive galaxies are\ntransitioning from their initial halo assembly to the later baryonic evolution\nseen in star-forming galaxies and quasars. However, no evidence of this\ntransition has been found in many high redshift galaxy surveys including\nCFHTLS, CANDELS and SPLASH, the first studies to probe the high-mass end at\nthese redshifts. Indeed, if halo mass to stellar mass ratios estimated at\nlower-redshift continue to $z \\sim 6-8$, CANDELS and SPLASH report several\norders of magnitude more $M \\sim 10^{12-13} M_\\odot$ halos than are possible to\nhave formed by those redshifts, implying these massive galaxies formed\nimpossibly early. We consider various systematics in the stellar synthesis\nmodels used to estimate physical parameters and possible galaxy formation\nscenarios in an effort to reconcile observation with theory. Although known\nuncertainties can greatly reduce the disparity between recent observations and\ncold dark matter merger simulations, even taking the most conservative view of\nthe observations, there remains considerable tension with current theory.\n", "  We model driven, compressible, isothermal, turbulence with Mach numbers\nranging from the subsonic ($\\mathcal{M} \\approx 0.65$) to the highly supersonic\nregime ($\\mathcal{M}\\approx 16 $). The forcing scheme consists both solenoidal\n(transverse) and compressive (longitudinal) modes in equal parts. We find a\nrelation $\\sigma_{s}^2 = \\mathrm{b}\\log{(1+\\mathrm{b}^2\\mathcal{M}^2)}$ between\nthe Mach number and the standard deviation of the logarithmic density with\n$\\mathrm{b} = 0.457 \\pm 0.007$. The density spectra follow\n$\\mathcal{D}(k,\\,\\mathcal{M}) \\propto k^{\\zeta(\\mathcal{M})}$ with scaling\nexponents depending on the Mach number. We find $\\zeta(\\mathcal{M}) = \\alpha\n\\mathcal{M}^{\\beta}$ with a coefficient $\\alpha$ that varies slightly with\nresolution, whereas $\\beta$ changes systematically. We extrapolate to the limit\nof infinite resolution and find $\\alpha = -1.91 \\pm 0.01,\\, \\beta =-0.30\\pm\n0.03$. The dependence of the scaling exponent on the Mach number implies a\nfractal dimension $D=2+0.96 \\mathcal{M}^{-0.30}$. We determine how the scaling\nparameters depend on the wavenumber and find that the density spectra are\nslightly curved. This curvature gets more pronounced with increasing Mach\nnumber. We propose a physically motivated fitting formula $\\mathcal{D}(k) =\n\\mathcal{D}_0 k^{\\zeta k^{\\eta}}$ by using simple scaling arguments. The fit\nreproduces the spectral behaviour down to scales $k\\approx 80$. The density\nspectrum follows a single power-law $\\eta = -0.005 \\pm 0.01$ in the low Mach\nnumber regime and the strongest curvature $\\eta = -0.04 \\pm 0.02$ for the\nhighest Mach number. These values of $\\eta$ represent a lower limit, as the\ncurvature increases with resolution.\n", "  We present a new decoding protocol to realize transmission of classical\ninformation through a quantum channel at asymptotically maximum capacity,\nachieving the Holevo bound and thus the optimal communication rate. At variance\nwith previous proposals, our scheme recovers the message bit by bit, making use\nof a series \"yes-no\" measurements, organized in bisection fashion, thus\ndetermining which codeword was sent in log(N) steps, N being the number of\ncodewords.\n", "  The maximally entangled state can be in a mixed state as well as the\nwell-known pure state. Taking the negativity as a measure of entanglement, we\nstudy the entanglement dynamics of bipartite, mixed maximally entangled states\n(MMESs) in multipartite cavity-reservoir systems. It is found that the MMES can\nexhibit the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death, which is quite different\nfrom the asymptotic decay of the pure-Bell-state case. We also find that\nmaximal entanglement cannot guarantee maximal nonlocality and the MMES does not\ncorrespond to the state with maximal measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN). In\nfact, the value and dynamic behavior of the MIN for the MMESs are dependent on\nthe mixed state probability. In addition, we investigate the distributions of\nnegativity and the MIN in a multipartite system, where the two types of\ncorrelations have different monogamous properties.\n", "  The production of J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ was measured with the ALICE\ndetector in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The measurement was performed at\nforward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4 $) down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm\nT}$) in the dimuon decay channel. Inclusive J/$\\psi$ yields were extracted in\ndifferent centrality classes and the centrality dependence of the average\n$p_{\\rm T}$ is presented. The J/$\\psi$ suppression, quantified with the nuclear\nmodification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$), was studied as a function of centrality,\ntransverse momentum and rapidity. Comparisons with similar measurements at\nlower collision energy and theoretical models indicate that the J/$\\psi$\nproduction is the result of an interplay between color screening and\nrecombination mechanisms in a deconfined partonic medium, or at its\nhadronization. Results on the $\\psi(2S)$ suppression are provided via the ratio\nof $\\psi(2S)$ over J/$\\psi$ measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions.\n", "  This is a comment to the paper, Limitations on the superposition principle:\nsuperselection rules in non-relativistic quantum mechanics by C Cisneros et al\n1998 Eur. J. Phys. 19 237. doi:10.1088/0143-0807/19/3/005. The proof that the\nauthors construct for the limitation on the superposition of state vectors\ncorresponding to different sectors of the Hilbert space, partitioned by a\nsuperoperator has a flaw as outlined below.\n", "  We present results on gas flows in the halo of a Milky Way-like galaxy at\nz=0.413 based on high-resolution spectroscopy of a background galaxy. This is\nthe first study of circumgalactic gas at high spectral resolution towards an\nextended background source (i.e., a galaxy rather than a quasar). Using\nlongslit spectroscopy of the foreground galaxy, we observe spatially extended H\nalpha emission with circular rotation velocity v=270 km/s. Using echelle\nspectroscopy of the background galaxy, we detect Mg II and Fe II absorption\nlines at impact parameter rho=27 kpc that are blueshifted from systemic in the\nsense of the foreground galaxy's rotation. The strongest absorber EW(2796) =\n0.90 A has an estimated column density (N_H>10^19 cm-2) and line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion (sigma=17 km/s) that are consistent with the observed\nproperties of extended H I disks in the local universe. Our analysis of the\nrotation curve also suggests that this r=30 kpc gaseous disk is warped with\nrespect to the stellar disk. In addition, we detect two weak Mg II absorbers in\nthe halo with small velocity dispersions (sigma<10 km/s). While the exact\ngeometry is unclear, one component is consistent with an extraplanar gas cloud\nnear the disk-halo interface that is co-rotating with the disk, and the other\nis consistent with a tidal feature similar to the Magellanic Stream. We can\nplace lower limits on the cloud sizes (l>0.4 kpc) for these absorbers given the\nextended nature of the background source. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for models of the geometry and kinematics of gas in the circumgalactic\nmedium.\n", "  We study the dynamics given by the iteration of a (half-line) CMV matrix with\nsparse, high barriers. Using an approach of Tcheremchantsev, we are able to\nexplicitly compute the transport exponents for this model in terms of the given\nparameters. In light of the connection between CMV matrices and quantum walks\non the half-line due to Cantero-Gr\\\"unbaum-Moral-Vel\\'azquez, our result also\nallows us to compute transport exponents corresponding to a quantum walk which\nis sparsely populated with strong reflectors. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis provides the first rigorous example of a quantum walk which exhibits\nquantum intermittency, i.e., nonconstancy of the transport exponents. When\ncombined with the CMV version of the Jitomirskaya-Last theory of subordinacy\nand the general discrete-time dynamical bounds from Damanik-Fillman-Vance, we\nare able to exactly compute the Hausdorff dimension of the associated spectral\nmeasure.\n", "  Properties of random mixed states of order $N$ distributed uniformly with\nrespect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure are investigated. We show that for large\n$N$, due to the concentration of measure, the trace distance between two random\nstates tends to a fixed number ${\\tilde D}=1/4+1/\\pi$, which yields the\nHelstrom bound on their distinguishability. To arrive at this result we apply\nfree random calculus and derive the symmetrized Marchenko--Pastur distribution,\nwhich is shown to describe numerical data for the model of two coupled quantum\nkicked tops. Asymptotic values for the fidelity, Bures and transmission\ndistances between two random states are obtained. Analogous results for quantum\nrelative entropy and Chernoff quantity provide other bounds on the\ndistinguishablity of both states in a multiple measurement setup due to the\nquantum Sanov theorem.\n", "  The role of species interactions in controlling the interplay between the\nstability of an ecosystem and its biodiversity is still not well understood.\nThe ability of ecological communities to recover after a small perturbation of\nthe species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied,\nwhereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the interactions are\naltered (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to\nunderstand the effects of diversity, interaction strenghts and ecological\nnetwork structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible\nequilibria, i.e., ones in which all populations have positive abundances. We\ndevelop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for\nfeasible coexistence in both mutualistic and consumer-resource systems. Using\nanalytical and numerical methods, we show that feasibility is determined by\njust a handful of quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial\ncomplexity-feasibility relationship. Analyzing more than 100 empirical\nnetworks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic\nsystems can be analytically predicted by means of a null model of random\ninteractions, whereas food webs are characterized by smaller coexistence\ndomains than those expected by chance. Finally, we characterize the geometric\nshape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of\nperturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions. Interestingly, the\nstructure of mutualistic interactions leads to very heterogeneous responses to\nperturbations, making those systems more fragile than expected by chance.\n", "  Scaling laws are powerful summaries of the variations of urban attributes\nwith city size. However, the validity of their universal meaning for cities is\nhampered by the observation that different scaling regimes can be encountered\nfor the same territory, time and attribute, depending on the criteria used to\ndelineate cities. The aim of this paper is to present new insights concerning\nthis variation, coupled with a sensitivity analysis of urban scaling in France,\nfor several socio-economic and infrastructural attributes from data collected\nexhaustively at the local level. The sensitivity analysis considers different\naggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census.\nWe produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by\naggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of\nthree definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs.\nWe then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to\ncity definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple\npopulation cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given\nsystem and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of\nthe attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the\nurban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria).\nBecause of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and of the heterogeneous\nmorphologies and social landscapes in the cities internal space, scaling\nestimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions\non which generative models are based. We conclude that examining scaling\nvariations might be an opportunity to understand better the inner composition\nof cities with regard to their size, i.e. to link the scales of the city-system\nwith the system of cities.\n", "  We construct Schroedinger-like solutions of the Vasiliev higher spin theory\nin D>3 dimension. Symmetries of such solutions and the linearised equation of\nmotion for the scalar on such backgrounds are analysed. We further propose\nGalilean invariant bosonic and fermionic field theories that could be dual to\nthe two parity invariant higher spin theories on the Schroedinger-like\nbackground respectively. The discussion is phrased mainly in D=4 dimension,\nwhile similar constructions follow straightforwardly in higher dimensions.\n", "  Using the adiabatic connection, we formulate the free energy in terms of the\ncorrelation function of a fictitious system, $h_{\\lambda}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')$,\nwhere $\\lambda$ determines the interaction strength. To obtain\n$h_{\\lambda}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')$ we use the Ornstein-Zernike equation, and the\ntwo equations constitute a general liquid-state framework for treating\ninhomogeneous fluids. As the two equations do not form a closed set, an\napproximate closure relation is required and it determines a type of an\napproximation. In the present work we investigate the random phase\napproximation (RPA) closure. We determine that this approximation is identical\nto the variational Gaussian approximation derived within the framework of the\nfield-theory. We then apply our generalized RPA approximation to the Gaussian\ncore model and Coulomb charges.\n", "  We study Hall-Littlewood polynomials using an integrable lattice model of\n$t$-deformed bosons. Working with row-to-row transfer matrices, we review the\nconstruction of Hall-Littlewood polynomials (of the $A_n$ root system) within\nthe framework of this model. Introducing appropriate double-row transfer\nmatrices, we extend this formalism to Hall-Littlewood polynomials based on the\n$BC_n$ root system, and obtain a new combinatorial formula for them. We then\napply our methods to prove a series of refined Cauchy and Littlewood identities\ninvolving Hall-Littlewood polynomials. The last two of these identities are\nnew, and relate infinite sums over hyperoctahedrally symmetric Hall-Littlewood\npolynomials with partition functions of the six-vertex model on finite domains.\n", "  We propose a description of nonequilibrium systems via a simple protocol that\ncombines exchange-correlation potentials from density functional theory with\nself-energies of many-body perturbation theory. The approach, aimed to avoid\ndouble counting of interactions, is tested against exact results in\nHubbard-type systems, with respect to interaction strength, perturbation speed\nand inhomogeneity, and system dimensionality and size. In many regimes, we find\nsignificant improvement over adiabatic time dependent density functional theory\nor second Born nonequilibrium Green's function approximations. We briefly\ndiscuss the reasons for the residual discrepancies, and directions for future\nwork.\n", "  Cardiovascular networks span the body by branching across many generations of\nvessels. The resulting structure delivers blood over long distances to supply\nall cells with oxygen via the relatively short-range process of diffusion at\nthe capillary level. The structural features of the network that accomplish\nthis density and ubiquity of capillaries are often called space-filling. There\nare multiple strategies to fill a space, but some strategies do not lead to\nbiologically adaptive structures by requiring too much construction material or\nspace, delivering resources too slowly, or using too much power to move blood\nthrough the system. We empirically measure the structure of real networks (18\nhumans and 1 mouse) and compare these observations with predictions of model\nnetworks that are space-filling and constrained by a few guiding biological\nprinciples. We devise a numerical method that enables the investigation of\nspace-filling strategies and determination of which biological principles\ninfluence network structure. Optimization for only a single principle creates\nunrealistic networks that represent an extreme limit of the possible structures\nthat could be observed in nature. We first study these extreme limits for two\ncompeting principles, minimal total material and minimal path lengths. We\ncombine these two principles and enforce various thresholds for balance in the\nnetwork hierarchy, which provides a novel approach that highlights the\ntrade-offs faced by biological networks and yields predictions that better\nmatch our empirical data.\n", "  We place the hyperbolic quantum Ruijsenaars-Schneider system with an\nexponential Morse term on a lattice and diagonalize the resulting $n$-particle\nmodel by means of multivariate continuous dual $q$-Hahn polynomials that arise\nas a parameter reduction of the Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials. This allows\nto compute the $n$-particle scattering operator, to identify the bispectral\ndual system, and to confirm the quantum integrability in a Hilbert space\nset-up.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos are SU(2) singlets that mix with active neutrinos via a\nmass matrix, its diagonalization leads to mass eigenstates that couple via\nstandard model vertices. We study the cosmological production of heavy\nneutrinos via standard model charged and neutral current vertices under a\nminimal set of assumptions: i) the mass basis contains a hierarchy of heavy\nneutrinos, ii) these have very small mixing angles with the active (flavor)\nneutrinos, iii) standard model particles, including light (active-like)\nneutrinos are in thermal equilibrium. The same weak interaction processes that\nproduce active-like neutrinos also produce the heavier species. We introduce\nthe kinetic equations that describe their production, freeze out and decay and\ndiscuss the various processes that lead to their production in a wide range of\ntemperatures assessing their feasibility as dark matter candidates. We identify\nprocesses in which finite temperature collective excitations lead to the\nproduction of the heavy species. As a specific example, we consider the\nproduction of heavy neutrinos from pion decay shortly after the QCD crossover\nincluding finite temperature corrections to the pion form factors and mass. We\nconsider the different decay channels that allow for the production of heavy\nneutrinos showing that their frozen distribution functions exhibit effects from\n\"kinematic entanglement\" and argue for their viability as mixed dark matter\ncandidates. We discuss abundance, phase space density and stability constraints\nand argue that heavy neutrinos with lifetime $\\tau> 1/H_0$ freeze out of local\nthermal equilibrium, and \\emph{conjecture} that those with lifetimes $\\tau \\ll\n1/H_0$ may undergo cascade decay into lighter DM candidates and/or inject\nnon-LTE neutrinos into the cosmic neutrino background. We provide a comparison\nwith non-resonant production via active-sterile mixing.\n", "  We describe the algorithm used to select the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample\nfor the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) using photometric data from both the SDSS and\nthe Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). LRG targets are required to\nmeet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL\nmagnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects\nroughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in\nthe redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that\nour methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and\nlower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data\nfrom SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target\nselection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS\nspectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the\ntarget sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the\nuniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean\nenough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher\nredshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached.\n", "  The Parker hypothesis (Parker (1972)) assumes that heating of coronal loops\noccurs due to reconnection, induced when photospheric motions braid field lines\nto the point of current sheet formation. In this contribution we address the\nquestion of how the nature of photospheric motions affects heating of braided\ncoronal loops. We design a series of boundary drivers and quantify their\nproperties in terms of complexity and helicity injection. We examine a series\nof long-duration full resistive MHD simulations in which a simulated coronal\nloop, consisting of initially uniform field lines, is subject to these\nphotospheric flows. Braiding of the loop is continually driven until\ndifferences in behaviour induced by the drivers can be characterised. It is\nshown that heating is crucially dependent on the nature of the photospheric\ndriver - coherent motions typically lead to fewer large energy release events,\nwhile more complex motions result in more frequent but less energetic heating\nevents.\n", "  Motivated by their application to holographic RG flows and hairy black holes\nin Einstein-scalar systems, we present a collection of superpotentials driving\nthe dynamics of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\\mathcal{N}=1$ four-dimensional\nsupergravities. These theories arise as consistent truncations of the\nelectric/magnetic families of $\\textrm{CSO}(p,q,r)_{c}$ maximal supergravities,\nwith ${p+q+r=8}$, discovered by Dall'Agata et al. The $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ truncations describe $\\textrm{SU}(3)$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\n\\times \\textrm{SO}(3)$ invariant sectors, respectively, and contain AdS$_4$\nsolutions preserving $\\mathcal{N}=1,2,3,4$ supersymmetry within the full\ntheories, as well as various gauge symmetries. Realisations in terms of\nnon-geometric type IIB as well as geometric massive type IIA backgrounds are\nalso discussed. The aim of this note is to provide easy to handle\nsuperpotentials that facilitate the study of gravitational and gauge aspects of\nthe $\\textrm{CSO}(p,q,r)_{c}$ maximal supergravities avoiding the\ntechnicalities required in their construction.\n", "  Based on a simple geometrical approach, we analyze the evolution of the\nKozai-Lidov mechanism for stars around shrinking massive black hole binaries on\ncircular orbits. We find that, due to a peculiar bifurcation pattern induced by\nthe Newtonian potential of stellar clusters, the orbit of stars could become\nhighly eccentric. This transition occurs abruptly for stars with small initial\neccentricities. Our approach would be also useful for studying the Kozai-Lidov\nmechanism in various astrophysical contexts.\n", "  We showcase machine learning (ML) inspired target selection algorithms to\ndetermine which of all potential targets should be selected first for\nspectroscopic follow up. Efficient target selection can improve the ML redshift\nuncertainties as calculated on an independent sample, while requiring less\ntargets to be observed. We compare the ML targeting algorithms with the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) target order, and with a random targeting algorithm.\nThe ML inspired algorithms are constructed iteratively by estimating which of\nthe remaining target galaxies will be most difficult for the machine learning\nmethods to accurately estimate redshifts using the previously observed data.\nThis is performed by predicting the expected redshift error and redshift offset\n(or bias) of all of the remaining target galaxies. We find that the predicted\nvalues of bias and error are accurate to better than 10-30% of the true values,\neven with only limited training sample sizes. We construct a hypothetical\nfollow-up survey and find that some of the ML targeting algorithms are able to\nobtain the same redshift predictive power with 2-3 times less observing time,\nas compared to that of the SDSS, or random, target selection algorithms. The\nreduction in the required follow up resources could allow for a change to the\nfollow-up strategy, for example by obtaining deeper spectroscopy, which could\nimprove ML redshift estimates for deeper test data.\n", "  We propose a new method to model cluster scaling relations in modified\ngravity. Using a suite of non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations, we show\nthat the scaling relations of cumulative gas quantities, such as the Sunyaev\nZel'dovich effect (Compton-y parameter) and the x-ray Compton-Y parameter, can\nbe accurately predicted using the known results in the $\\Lambda$CDM model with\na precision of $\\sim3\\%$. This method provides a reliable way to analyze the\ngas physics in modified gravity using the less-demanding and much more\nefficient pure cold dark matter simulations. Our results therefore have\nimportant theoretical and practical implications in constraining gravity using\ncluster surveys.\n", "  A search for a charged Higgs boson is performed with a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 +/- 0.5 inverse femtobarns\ncollected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV.\nThe charged Higgs boson is searched for in top quark decays for m(H+/-) < m(t)\n- m(b), and in the direct production pp -> t (b) H+/- for m(H+/-) > m(t) -\nm(b). The H+/- -> tau+/- nu[tau] and H+/- -> t b decay modes in the final\nstates tau[h]+jets, mu tau[h], l+jets, and ll' (l = e, mu) are considered in\nthe search. No signal is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits are set\non the charged Higgs boson production. A model-independent upper limit on the\nproduct branching fraction B( t -> H+/- b ) B( H+/- -> tau+/- nu[tau] )=\n1.2-0.15% is obtained in the mass range m(H+/-) = 80-160 GeV, while the upper\nlimit on the cross section times branching fraction sigma( pp -> t (b) H+/- )\nB( H+/- -> tau+/- nu[tau] ) = 0.38-0.025 pb is set in the mass range m(H+/-) =\n180-600 GeV. Here, cross section sigma( pp -> t (b) H+/- ) stands for the sum\nsigma( pp -> t-bar (b) H+ ) + sigma( pp -> t (b-bar) H- ). Assuming B( H+/- ->\nt b ) = 1, an upper limit on sigma ( pp -> t (b) H+/- ) of 2.0-0.13 pb is set\nfor m(H+/-) = 180-600 GeV. The combination of all considered decay modes and\nfinal states is used to set exclusion limits in the m(H+/-)-tan(beta) parameter\nspace in different MSSM benchmark scenarios.\n", "  Self-organized structures in networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity\n(STDP) are likely to play a central role for information processing in the\nbrain. In the present study we derive a reaction-diffusion-like formalism for\nplastic feed-forward networks of nonlinear rate neurons with a correlation\nsensitive learning rule inspired by and being qualitatively similar to STDP.\nAfter obtaining equations that describe the change of the spatial shape of the\nsignal from layer to layer, we derive a criterion for the non-linearity\nnecessary to obtain stable dynamics for arbitrary input. We classify the\npossible scenarios of signal evolution and find that close to the transition to\nthe unstable regime meta-stable solutions appear. The form of these dissipative\nsolitons is determined analytically and the evolution and interaction of\nseveral such coexistent objects is investigated.\n", "  An intense, 120 GeV proton beam incident on an extremely long, iron target\ngenerates enormous numbers of light-mass particles that also decay within that\ntarget. If one of these particles decays to a final state with a hidden gauge\nboson, or if such a particle is produced as a result of the initial collision,\nthen that weakly interacting, hidden-sector particle may traverse the remainder\nof the target and be detected downstream through its possible decay to an\n$e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, or $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ final state. These conditions can be\nrealized through an extension of the SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab, and in\nthis initial investigation we consider how it can serve as an ultrasensitive\nprobe of hidden vector gauge forces, both Abelian and non-Abelian. A light,\nweakly coupled hidden sector may well explain the dark matter established\nthrough astrophysical observations, and the proposed search can provide\ntangible evidence for its existence --- or, alternatively, constrain a \"sea\" of\npossibilities.\n", "  We consider the universal sector of a $d$-dimensional large-$N$\nstrongly-interacting holographic CFT on a black hole spacetime background $B$.\nWhen our CFT$_d$ is coupled to dynamical Einstein-Hilbert gravity with Newton\nconstant $G_{d}$, the combined system can be shown to satisfy a version of the\nthermodynamic Generalized Second Law (GSL) at leading order in $G_{d}$. The\nquantity $S_{CFT} + \\frac{A(H_{B, \\text{perturbed}})}{4G_{d}}$ is\nnon-decreasing, where $A(H_{B, \\text{perturbed}})$ is the (time-dependent) area\nof the new event horizon in the coupled theory. Our $S_{CFT}$ is the notion of\n(coarse-grained) CFT entropy outside the black hole given by causal holographic\ninformation -- a quantity in turn defined in the AdS$_{d+1}$ dual by the\nrenormalized area $A_{ren}(H_{\\rm bulk})$ of a corresponding bulk causal\nhorizon. A corollary is that the fine-grained GSL must hold for finite\nprocesses taken as a whole, though local decreases of the fine-grained\ngeneralized entropy are not obviously forbidden. Another corollary, given by\nsetting $G_{d} = 0$, states that no finite process taken as a whole can\nincrease the renormalized free energy $F = E_{out} - T S_{CFT} - \\Omega J -\n\\Phi Q$, with $T, \\Omega, \\Phi$ constants set by ${H}_B$. This latter corollary\nconstitutes a 2nd law for appropriate non-compact AdS event horizons.\n", "  We study the effect of dilute pinning on the jamming transition. Pinning\nreduces the average contact number needed to jam unpinned particles and shifts\nthe jamming threshold to lower densities, leading to a pinning susceptibility,\n$\\chi_p$. Our main results are that this susceptibility obeys scaling form and\ndiverges in the thermodynamic limit as $\\chi_p \\propto |\\phi -\n\\phi_c^\\infty|^{-\\gamma_p}$ where $\\phi_c^\\infty$ is the jamming threshold in\nthe absence of pins. Finite-size scaling arguments yield these values with\nassociated statistical (systematic) errors $\\gamma_p = 1.018 \\pm 0.026 (0.291)\n$ in $d=2$ and $\\gamma_p =1.534 \\pm 0.120 (0.822)$ in $d=3$. Logarithmic\ncorrections raise the exponent in $d=2$ to close to the $d=3$ value, although\nthe systematic errors are very large.\n", "  We present an initial report on 160 simulations of a highly simplified model\nof the post-bounce core-collapse supernova environment in three spatial\ndimensions (3D). We set different values of a parameter characterizing the\nimpact of nuclear dissociation at the stalled shock in order to regulate the\npost-shock fluid velocity, thereby determining the relative importance of\nconvection and the stationary accretion shock instability (SASI). While our\nconvection-dominated runs comport with the paradigmatic notion of a `critical\nneutrino luminosity' for explosion at a given mass accretion rate (albeit with\na nontrivial spread in explosion times just above threshold), the outcomes of\nour SASI-dominated runs are much more stochastic: a sharp threshold critical\nluminosity is `smeared out' into a rising probability of explosion over a $\\sim\n20\\%$ range of luminosity. We also find that the SASI-dominated models are able\nto explode with 3 to 4 times less efficient neutrino heating, indicating that\nprogenitor properties, and fluid and neutrino microphysics, conducive to the\nSASI would make the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism more robust.\n", "  The van Leeuwen proof of linear-response time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT) is generalized to thermal ensembles. This allows generalization\nto finite temperatures of the Gross-Kohn relation, the exchange-correlation\nkernel of TDDFT, and fluctuation dissipation theorem for DFT. This produces a\nnatural method for generating new thermal exchange-correlation (XC)\napproximations.\n", "  Applying our recently-developed generalized version of the high-latitude\nemission theory to the observations of X-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),\nwe present here clear observational evidence that the X-ray flare emission\nregion is undergoing rapid bulk acceleration as the photons are emitted. We\nshow that both the observed X-ray flare light curves and the photon index\nevolution curves can be simultaneously reproduced within a simple physical\nmodel invoking synchrotron radiation in an accelerating emission region far\nfrom the GRB central engine. Such an acceleration process demands an additional\nenergy dissipation source other than kinetic energy, which points towards a\nsignificant Poynting-flux in the emission region of X-ray flares. As the X-ray\nflares are believed to share a similar physical mechanism as the GRB prompt\nemission, our finding here hints that the GRB prompt emission jets may also\ncarry a significant Poynting-flux in their emitting region.\n", "  We use femtosecond time-resolved hard x-ray scattering to detect coherent\nacoustic phonons excited during ultrafast laser demagnetization of bcc Fe\nfilms. We determine the lattice strain propagating through the film through\nanalysis of the oscillations in the x-ray scattering signal as a function of\nmomentum transfer. The width of the strain wavefront is ~100 fs, similar to\ndemagnetization timescales. First-principles calculations show that the\nhigh-frequency Fourier components of the strain, which give rise to the sharp\nwavefront, could in part originate from non-thermal dynamics of the lattice not\nconsidered in the two-temperature model.\n", "  We have performed temperature dependent tunneling spectroscopy on an\nimpurity-free surface area of a LiFeAs single crystal. Our data reveal a highly\nunusual temperature evolution of superconductivity: at $T_c^*=18$~K a partial\nsuperconducting gap opens, as is evidenced by subtle, yet clear features in the\ntunneling spectra, i.e. particle-hole symmetric coherence peaks, and a dip-hump\nstructure which signals strong-coupling superconductivity. At $T_c=16$~K, these\nfeatures substantiate dramatically and become characteristic of full\nsuperconductivity. Remarkably, this is accompanied by an almost jump-like\nincrease of the gap energy at $T_c$ to about 87\\% of its low-temperature gap\nvalue. The energy of the bosonic mode as measured by the distance between the\ncoherence peak and the higher-energy dip remains practically constant in the\nwhole temperature regime $T\\leq T_c^*$. The comparison of these findings with\nestablished experimental and theoretical results lead us to suggest that the\nbosonic mode is not directly related to incommensurate spin fluctuations that\nhave previously been observed in inelastic neutron scattering.\n", "  Even when cooled through its transition temperature in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field, a superconductor can expel nearly all external\nmagnetic flux. This Letter presents an experimental study to identify the\nparameters that most strongly influence flux trapping in high purity niobium\nduring cooldown. This is critical to the operation of superconducting\nradiofrequency cavities, in which trapped flux degrades the quality factor and\ntherefore cryogenic efficiency. Flux expulsion was measured on a large survey\nof 1.3 GHz cavities prepared in various ways. It is shown that both spatial\nthermal gradient and high temperature treatment are critical to expelling\nexternal magnetic fields, while surface treatment has minimal effect. For the\nfirst time, it is shown that a cavity can be converted from poor expulsion\nbehavior to strong expulsion behavior after furnace treatment, resulting in a\nsubstantial improvement in quality factor. Future plans are described to build\non this result in order to optimize treatment for future cavities.\n", "  The hot and dense matter generated in heavy-ion collisions may contain\ndomains which are not invariant under P and CP transformations. Moreover,\nheavy-ion collisions can generate extremely strong magnetic fields as well as\nelectric fields. The interplay between the electromagnetic field and triangle\nanomaly leads to a number of macroscopic quantum phenomena in these P- and\nCP-odd domains known as the anomalous transports. The purpose of the article is\nto give a pedagogical review of various properties of the electromagnetic\nfields, the anomalous transports phenomena, and their experimental signatures\nin heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Originally designed as a new nuclear reactor monitoring device, the Nucifer\ndetector has successfully detected its first neutrinos. We provide the second\nshortest baseline measurement of the reactor neutrino flux. The detection of\nelectron antineutrinos emitted in the decay chains of the fission products,\ncombined with reactor core simulations, provides an new tool to assess both the\nthermal power and the fissile content of the whole nuclear core and could be\nused by the Inter- national Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) to enhance the\nSafeguards of civil nuclear reactors. Deployed at only 7.2m away from the\ncompact Osiris research reactor core (70MW) operating at the Saclay research\ncentre of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA),\nthe experiment also exhibits a well-suited configuration to search for a new\nshort baseline oscillation. We report the first results of the Nucifer\nexperiment, describing the performances of the 0.85m3 detector remotely\noperating at a shallow depth equivalent to 12m of water and under intense\nbackground radiation conditions. Based on 145 (106) days of data with reactor\nON (OFF), leading to the detection of an estimated 40760 electron\nantineutrinos, the mean number of detected antineutrinos is 281 +- 7(stat) +-\n18(syst) electron antineutrinos/day, in agreement with the prediction 277(23)\nelectron antineutrinos/day. Due the the large background no conclusive results\non the existence of light sterile neutrinos could be derived, however. As a\nfirst societal application we quantify how antineutrinos could be used for the\nPlutonium Management and Disposition Agreement.\n", "  The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated\nmechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand, the\ncollective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively\nsmall number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary\nApproximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological\nmodels from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black\nboxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this\nway, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions,\ncharacterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same\nrange of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that\nfunction as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the\nprocedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48\nparameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a\nsingle adaptation parameter $\\tau$ characterizing the ratio of time scales for\nthe initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be\nexpressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten\nconstants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling\nin physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized\ninto simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters. The\nproposed method additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for\nnon-universal features of the behavior.\n", "  We compute the isospin-asymmetry dependence of microscopic optical model\npotentials from realistic chiral two- and three-body interactions over a range\nof resolution scales $\\Lambda \\simeq 400-500$\\,MeV. We show that at moderate\nprojectile energies, $E_{\\rm inv} = 110 - 200$\\,MeV, the real isovector part of\nthe optical potential changes sign, a phenomenon referred to as isospin\ninversion. We also extract the strength and energy dependence of the imaginary\nisovector optical potential and find no evidence for an analogous phenomenon\nover the range of energies, $E \\leq 200$\\,MeV, considered in the present work.\nFinally, we compute for the first time the leading corrections to the Lane\nparametrization for the isospin-asymmetry dependence of the optical potential\nand observe an enhanced importance at low scattering energies.\n", "  With a radio continuum galaxy survey by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a\nphotometric galaxy survey by Euclid and their combination, we forecast future\nconstraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. We focus on the potential impact of\nlocal-type higher-order nonlinear parameters on the parameter estimation and\nparticularly the confirmation of the inflationary consistency inequality.\nNonstandard inflationary models, such as multifield models, introduce the\nscale-dependent stochastic clustering of galaxies on large scales, which is a\nunique probe of mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations. Our\nFisher matrix analysis indicates that a deep and wide survey provided by SKA is\nmore advantageous to constrain $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$, while Euclid has a strong\nconstraining power for $f_{\\rm NL}$ due to the redshift information, suggesting\nthat the joint analysis between them is quite essential to break the degeneracy\nbetween the nonlinear parameters. The combination of the full SKA and Euclid\nwill achieve the precision level needed to confirm the consistency inequality\neven for $f_{\\rm NL}\\approx 1.5$ and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}\\approx 17$, though it is\nstill hard for a single survey to confirm it when $f_{\\rm NL}\\lesssim 2.7$.\n", "  Semi-metals are characterized by nodal band structures that give rise to\nexotic electronic properties. The stability of Dirac semi-metals, such as\ngraphene in two spatial dimensions (2D), requires the presence of lattice\nsymmetries, while akin to the surface states of topological band insulators,\nWeyl semi-metals in three spatial dimensions (3D) are protected by band\ntopology. Here we show that in the bulk of topological band insulators,\nself-organized topologically protected semi-metals can emerge along a grain\nboundary, a ubiquitous extended lattice defect in any crystalline material. In\naddition to experimentally accessible electronic transport measurements, these\nstates exhibit valley anomaly in 2D influencing edge spin transport, whereas in\n3D they appear as graphene-like states that may exhibit an odd-integer quantum\nHall effect. The general mechanism underlying these novel semi-metals -- the\nhybridization of spinon modes bound to the grain boundary -- suggests that\ntopological semi-metals can emerge in any topological material where lattice\ndislocations bind localized topological modes.\n", "  The Birkhoff's theorem states that any doubly stochastic matrix lies inside a\nconvex polytope with the permutation matrices at the corners. It can be proven\nthat a similar theorem holds for unitary matrices with equal line sums for\nprime dimensions.\n", "  Based on the completeness relation for the squared solutions of the Lax\noperator $L$ we show that a subset of nonlocal equations from the hierarchy of\nnonlocal nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations (NLS) is a completely integrable\nsystem. The spectral properties of the Lax operator indicate that there are two\ntypes of soliton solutions. The relevant action-angle variables are\nparametrized by the scattering data of the Lax operator. The notion of the\nsymplectic basis, which directly maps the variations of the potential of $L$ to\nthe variations of the action-angle variables has been generalized to the\nnonlocal case. We also show that the inverse scattering method can be viewed as\na generalized Fourier transform. Using the trace identities and the symplectic\nbasis we construct the hierarchy Hamiltonian structures for the nonlocal NLS\nequations.\n", "  Recent work has shown that the entropy of the non-rotating BTZ black hole can\nbe derived from a dual conformal description at any spatial location. In this\nfollowup it is shown that a dual conformal description exists at any spatial\nlocation for the rotating BTZ black hole as well. As in the non-rotating case,\ntwo copies of the central charge $c^{\\pm} = 3\\ell/2G$ are recovered and the\nmicrocanonical Cardy formula yields the correct Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  We investigate supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged supergravity in\nfive dimensions, in the timelike class. We propose an ansatz based on a\nfour-dimensional local orthotoric Kaehler metric and reduce the problem to a\nsingle sixth-order equation for two functions, each of one variable. We find an\nanalytic, asymptotically locally AdS solution comprising five parameters. For a\nconformally flat boundary, this reduces to a previously known solution with\nthree parameters, representing the most general solution of this type known in\nthe minimal theory. We discuss the possible relevance of certain topological\nsolitons contained in the latter to account for the supersymmetric Casimir\nenergy of dual superconformal field theories on S^3 x R. Although we obtain a\nnegative response, our analysis clarifies several aspects of these solutions.\nIn particular, we show that there exists a unique regular topological soliton\nin this family.\n", "  Superconductors close to quantum phase transitions often exhibit a\nsimultaneous increase of electronic correlations and superconducting transition\ntemperatures. Typical examples are given by the recently discovered iron-based\nsuperconductors. We investigated the band-specific quasiparticle masses of\nAFe2As2 single crystals with A = K, Rb, and Cs and determined their pressure\ndependence. The evolution of electronic correlations could be tracked as a\nfunction of volume and hole doping. The results indicate that with increasing\nalkali-metal ion radius a quantum critical point is approached. The critical\nfluctuations responsible for the enhancement of the quasiparticle masses appear\nto suppress the superconductivity.\n", "  We study in detail how neutrino perturbations can be followed in linear\ntheory by using only terms up to $l=2$ in the Boltzmann hierarchy. We provide a\nnew approximation to the third moment and demonstrate that the neutrino power\nspectrum can be calculated to a precision of better than $\\sim$ 5% for masses\nup to $\\sim$ 1 eV. The matter and CMB power spectra can be calculated far more\nprecisely and typically at least a factor of a few better than with existing\napproximations. We then proceed to study how the neutrino power spectrum can be\nreliably calculated even in the presence of non-linear gravitational clustering\nby using the full non-linear gravitational potential derived from semi-analytic\nmethods based on $N$-body simulations in the Boltzmann evolution hierarchy. Our\nresults agree extremely well with results derived from $N$-body simulations.\n", "  The motion of superfluid vortices in a neutron star crust is at the heart of\nmost theories of pulsar glitches. Pinning of vortices to ions can decouple the\nsuperfluid from the crust and create a reservoir of angular momentum. Sudden\nlarge scale unpinning can lead to an observable glitch. In this paper we\ninvestigate the scattering of a free vortex off a pinning potential and\ncalculate its mean free path, in order to assess whether unpinned vortices can\nskip multiple pinning sites and come close enough to their neighbours to\ntrigger avalanches, or whether they simply hop from one pinning site to another\ngiving rise to a more gradual creep. We find that there is a significant range\nof parameter space in which avalanches can be triggered, thus supporting the\nhypothesis that they may lie at the origin of pulsar glitches. For realistic\nvalues of the pinning force and superfluid drag parameters we find that\navalanches are more likely in the higher density regions of the crust where\npinning is stronger. Physical differences in stellar parameters, such as mass\nand temperature, may lead to a switch between creep-like motion and avalanches,\nexplaining the different characteristics of glitching pulsars.\n", "  Entanglement is at the heart of most quantum information tasks, and therefore\nconsiderable effort has been made to find methods of deciding the entanglement\ncontent of a given bipartite quantum state. Here, we prove a fundamental\nlimitation to deciding if an unknown state is entangled or not: we show that\nany quantum measurement which can answer this question necessarily gives enough\ninformation to identify the state completely. Therefore, only prior information\nregarding the state can make entanglement detection less expensive than full\nstate tomography in terms of the demanded quantum resources. We also extend our\ntreatment to other classes of correlated states by considering the problem of\ndeciding if a state is NPT, discordant, or fully classically correlated.\nRemarkably, only the question related to quantum discord can be answered\nwithout resorting to full state tomography.\n", "  Recently three dimensional topological quantum materials with gapless energy\nspectra have attracted considerable interests in many branches of physics.\nBesides the celebrated example, Dirac and Weyl points which possess gapless\npoint structures in the underlying energy dispersion, the topologically\nprotected gapless spectrum can also occur along a ring, named Dirac and Weyl\nnodal rings. Ultra-cold atomic gases provide an ideal platform for exploring\nnew topological materials with designed symmetries. However, whether Dirac and\nWeyl rings can exist in the single-particle spectrum of cold atoms remains\nelusive. Here we propose a realistic model for realizing Dirac and Weyl rings\nin the single-particle band dispersion of a cold atom optical lattice. Our\nscheme is based on previously experimentally already implemented Raman coupling\nsetup for realizing spin-orbit coupling. Without the Zeeman field, the model\npreserves both pseudo-time-reversal and inversion symmetries, allowing Dirac\nrings. The Dirac rings split into Weyl rings with a Zeeman field that breaks\nthe pseudo-time-reversal symmetry. We examine the superfluidity of attractive\nFermi gases in this model and also find Dirac and Weyl rings in the\nquasiparticle spectrum.\n", "  Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and spin Hall effect (SHE) are fundamental\nphenomena, and their potential for application is great. However, we understand\nthe interaction effects unsatisfactorily, and should have clarified issues\nabout the roles of the Fermi sea term and Fermi surface term of the\nconductivity of the intrinsic AHE or SHE of an interacting multiorbital metal\nand about the effects of spin-Coulomb drag on the intrinsic SHE. Here we\nresolve the first issue and provide the first step about the second issue by\ndeveloping a general formalism in the linear response theory with appropriate\napproximations and using analytic arguments. The most striking result is that\neven without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,\nplays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures. In particular, this\nFermi surface term causes the temperature dependence of the dc anomalous Hall\nor spin Hall conductivity due to the interaction-induced quasiparticle damping\nand the correction of the dc spin Hall conductivity due to the spin-Coulomb\ndrag. Those results revise our understanding of the intrinsic AHE and SHE. We\nalso find that the differences between the dc anomalous Hall and longitudinal\nconductivities arise from the difference in the dominant multiband excitations.\nThis not only explains why the Fermi sea term such as the Berry-curvature term\nbecomes important in clean and low-temperature case only for interband\ntransports but also provides the useful principles on treating the\nelectron-electron interaction in an interacting multiorbital metal for general\nformalism of transport coefficients. Several correspondences between our\nresults and experiments are finally discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we address a possible impact of radiative corrections from a\nheavy scalar field $\\chi$ on the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$. Integrating\nout $\\chi$, we derive the effective action for $\\zeta$, which includes the loop\ncorrections of the heavy field $\\chi$. When the mass of $\\chi$ is much larger\nthan the Hubble scale $H$, the loop corrections of $\\chi$ only yield a local\ncontribution to the effective action and hence the effective action simply\ngives an action for $\\zeta$ in a single field model, where, as is widely known,\n$\\zeta$ is conserved in time after the Hubble crossing time. Meanwhile, when\nthe mass of $\\chi$ is comparable to $H$, the loop corrections of $\\chi$ can\ngive a non-local contribution to the effective action. Because of the non-local\ncontribution from $\\chi$, in general, $\\zeta$ may not be conserved, even if the\nclassical background trajectory is determined only by the evolution of the\ninflaton. In this paper, we derive the condition that $\\zeta$ is conserved in\ntime in the presence of the radiative corrections from $\\chi$. Namely, we show\nthat when the scaling symmetry, which is a part of the diffeomorphism\ninvariance, is preserved at the quantum level, the loop corrections of the\nmassive field $\\chi$ do not disturb the constant evolution of $\\zeta$ at super\nHubble scales. In this discussion, we show the Ward-Takahashi identity for the\nscaling symmetry, which yields a consistency relation for the correlation\nfunctions of the massive field $\\chi$.\n", "  The following issue is addressed: how the addition of a Gauss-Bonnet term\n(generically coming from most fundamental theories, as string and M theories),\nto a viable model, can change the specific properties, and even the physical\nnature, of the corresponding cosmological solutions? Specifically, brand new\noriginal dark energy models are obtained in this way with quite interesting\nproperties, which exhibit, in a unified fashion, the three distinguished\npossible cosmological phases corresponding to phantom matter, quintessence, and\nordinary matter, respectively. A model, in which the equation of state\nparameter, $w$, is a function of time, is seen to lead either to a singularity\nof the Big Rip kind or to a bouncing solution which evolves into a de Sitter\nuniverse with $w=-1$. Moreover, new Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity models with\nbouncing behavior in the early stages of the universe evolution are obtained\nand tested for the validity and stability of the corresponding solutions. They\nallow for a remarkably natural, unified description of a bouncing behavior at\nearly times and accelerated expansion at present.\n", "  We briefly review the super-natural supersymmetry (SUSY), which provides a\nmost promising solution to the SUSY electroweak fine-tuning problem. In\nparticular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale\ninvariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge\nsymmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for\nsuper-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we\nconsider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on\n$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of\nmoduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the\nK\\\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of\nM-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY\nelectroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,\nstau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest\nneutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are\naround 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV\nor larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks. In the dilaton dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the qualitative picture remain the same but we have heavier\nspectra as compared to moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenario. In addition to\nit, we have Higgs $H_{2}/A_{1}$-resonance solutions for dark matter (DM). In\nboth scenarios, the minimal value of DM relic density is about 0.2. To obtain\nthe observed DM relic density, we can consider the dilution effect from\nsupercritical string cosmology or introduce the axino as the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle.\n", "  A theory determining the evolution of general Rayleigh-Taylor mixing fronts\nis established to reproduce firstly all of the documented experiments conducted\nfor diverse acceleration histories and all density ratios. The theory is\nestablished in terms of the fundamental conservation and symmetry principles,\nwith special consideration given to the symmetry breaking of the density fields\noccurring in actual flows. The results reveal the sensitivity/insensitivity of\nthe evolution of a mixing front neighbouring light/heavy fluid to the degree of\nsymmetry breaking, and also explain the distinct evolutions in two experiments\nwith the same configurations.\n", "  The propagation of domain walls in a ferromagnetic film is largely determined\nby domain wall pinning at defects in the material. In this letter we map the\neffective potential landscape for domain wall pinning in Permalloy films by\nraster scanning a single ferromagnetic vortex and monitoring the hysteretic\nvortex displacement vs. applied magnetic field. The measurement is carried out\nusing a differential magneto-optical microscopy technique which yields spatial\nsensitivity $\\sim 10$ nm. We present a simple algorithm for extracting an\neffective pinning potential from the measurement of vortex displacement vs.\napplied field. The resulting maps of the pinning potential reveal distinct\ntypes of pinning sites, which we attribute to quasi-zero-, one-, and\ntwo-dimensional defects in the Permalloy film.\n", "  We develop a form factor bootstrap program to determine the matrix elements\nof local, boundary condition changing operators. We propose axioms for these\nform factors and determine their solutions in the free boson and Lee-Yang\nmodels. The sudden change in the boundary condition, caused by an operator\ninsertion, can be interpreted as a local quench and the form factors provide\nthe overlap of any state before the quench with any outgoing state after the\nquench.\n", "  It is often argued that inflation erases all the information about what took\nplace before it started. Quantum gravity, relevant in the Planck era, seems\ntherefore mostly impossible to probe with cosmological observations. In\ngeneral, only very ad hoc scenarios or hyper fine-tuned initial conditions can\nlead to observationally testable theories. Here we consider a well-defined and\nwell motivated candidate quantum cosmology model that predicts inflation. Using\nthe most recent observational constraints on the cosmic microwave background B\nmodes, we show that the model is excluded for all its parameter space, without\nany tuning. Some important consequences are drawn for the deformed algebra\napproach to loop quantum cosmology. We emphasize that neither loop quantum\ncosmology in general nor loop quantum gravity are disfavored by this study but\ntheir falsifiability is established.\n", "  We compute the Renyi entropy and the supersymmetric Renyi entropy for the\nsix-dimensional free (2,0) tensor multiplet. We make various checks on our\nresults, and they are consistent with the previous results about the (2,0)\ntensor multiplet. As a by-product, we have established a canonical way to\ncompute the Renyi entropy for p-form fields in d-dimensions.\n", "  Entanglement, one of the central mysteries of quantum mechanics, plays an\nessential role in numerous applications of quantum information theory. A\nnatural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether\nuniversal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography. In\nthis work, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for any\nnon-adaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine\nin detail a previously implemented experiment, which claimed to detect\nentanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without\nfull state tomography. By performing the experiment and analyzing the data, we\ndemonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct\nthe state. These results reveal a fundamental limit for single-copy\nmeasurements in entanglement detection, and provides a general framework to\nstudy the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as\nthe positivity of partial transpose and the $k$-symmetric extendibility.\n", "  The chromoelectric field generated by a static quark-antiquark pair, with its\npeculiar tube-like shape, can be nicely described, at zero temperature, within\nthe dual superconductor scenario for the QCD confining vacuum. In this work we\ninvestigate, by lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the SU(3) pure gauge theory,\nthe fate of chromoelectric flux tubes across the deconfinement transition. We\nfind that, as the temperature is increased towards and above the deconfinement\ntemperature $T_c$, the amplitude of the field inside the flux tube gets\nsmaller, while the shape of the flux tube does not vary appreciably across\ndeconfinement. This scenario with flux-tube \"evaporation\" above $T_c$ has no\ncorrespondence in ordinary (type-II) superconductivity, where instead the\ntransition to the phase with normal conductivity is characterized by a\ndivergent fattening of flux tubes as the transition temperature is approached\nfrom below. We present also some evidence about the existence of flux-tube\nstructures in the magnetic sector of the theory in the deconfined phase.\n", "  We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at $z\\sim4$.\nUsing the hierarchical galaxy formation model GALFORM, we predict, for the\nfirst time using a semi-analytical model with feedback from active galactic\nnuclei (AGN), the angular correlation function (ACF) of LBGs and find agreement\nwithin $3\\,\\sigma$ with new measurements of the ACF from surveys including the\nHubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) and CANDELS field. Our simulations confirm the\nconclusion reached using independent models that although the predicted ACFs\nreproduce the trend of increased clustering with luminosity, the dependence is\nless strong than observed. We find that for the detection limits of the XDF\nfield central LBGs at $z\\sim 4$ predominantly reside in haloes of mass $\\sim\n10^{11}-10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\\rm \\odot}$ and that satellites reside in larger haloes\nof mass $\\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\\rm \\odot}$. The model predicts fewer\nbright satellite LBGs at $z\\sim4$ than is inferred from measurements of the ACF\nat small scales. By analysing the halo occupation distribution (HOD) predicted\nby the model, we find evidence that AGN feedback affects the HOD of central\nLBGs in massive haloes. This is a new high-redshift test of this important\nfeedback mechanism. We investigate the effect of photometric errors in the\nobservations on the ACF predictions. We find that the observational uncertainty\nin the galaxy luminosity reduces the clustering amplitude and that this effect\nincreases towards faint galaxies, particularly on small scales. To compare\nproperties of model with observed LBGs this uncertainty must be considered.\n", "  We present VIMOS-VLT spectroscopy of the Frontier Fields cluster\nMACS~J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397). Taken as part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the large\nspectroscopic campaign provided more than 4000 reliable redshifts, including\n~800 cluster member galaxies. The unprecedented sample of cluster members at\nthis redshift allows us to perform a highly detailed dynamical and structural\nanalysis of the cluster out to ~2.2$r_{200}$ (~4Mpc). Our analysis of\nsubstructures reveals a complex system composed of a main massive cluster\n($M_{200}$~0.9$\\times 10^{15} M_{\\odot}$) presenting two major features: i) a\nbimodal velocity distribution, showing two central peaks separated by $\\Delta\nV_{rf}$~1100 km s$^{-1}$ with comparable galaxy content and velocity\ndispersion, ii) a projected elongation of the main substructures along the\nNE-SW direction, with a prominent subclump ~600 kpc SW of the center and an\nisolated BCG approximately halfway between the center and the SW clump. We also\ndetect a low mass structure at z~0.390, ~10' S of the cluster center, projected\nat ~3Mpc, with a relative line-of-sight velocity of $\\Delta V_{rf}$~-1700 km\ns$^{-1}$. The cluster mass profile that we obtain through our dynamical\nanalysis deviates significantly from the \"universal\" NFW, being best fit by a\nSoftened Isothermal Sphere model instead. The mass profile measured from the\ngalaxy dynamics is found to be in relatively good agreement with those obtained\nfrom strong and weak lensing, as well as with that from the X-rays, despite the\nclearly unrelaxed nature of the cluster. Our results reveal overall a complex\ndynamical state of this massive cluster and support the hypothesis that the two\nmain subclusters are being observed in a pre-collisional phase, in line with\nrecent findings from radio and deep X-ray data. With this article we also\nrelease the entire redshift catalog of 4386 sources in the field of this\ncluster.\n", "  Oscillations between photons and axion-like particles (ALP) travelling in\nintergalactic magnetic fields have been invoked to explain a number of\nastrophysical phenomena, or used to constrain ALP properties using\nobservations. One example is the anomalous transparency of the universe to TeV\ngamma-rays. The intergalactic magnetic field is usually modeled as patches of\ncoherent domains, each with a uniform magnetic field, but the field orientation\nchanges randomly from one domain to the next (\"discrete-$\\varphi$ model\"). We\nshow in this paper that in more realistic situations, when the magnetic field\ndirection varies continuously along the propagation path, the photon-to-ALP\nconversion probability $P$ can be significantly different from the\ndiscrete-$\\varphi$ model. In particular, $P$ has a distinct dependence on the\nphoton energy and ALP mass, and can be as large as 100 percent. This result may\naffect previous constraints on ALP properties based on ALP-photon propagation\nin intergalactic magnetic fields.\n", "  In this Comment, we argue that the behavior of the overlap functions reported\nin the commented paper can be fully understood in terms of the physics of\nsimple liquids in contact with disordered substrates, without appealing to any\nparticular glassy phenomenology. This suggestion is further supported by an\nanalytic study of the one-dimensional Ising model provided as Supplementary\nMaterial.\n", "  In this work, we study the $T\\bar{T}$-type molecular systems systematically\nvia one pion exchange model, where $T$ denotes the narrow $J^P=1^+$ $D_1$ meson\nor $2^+$ $D_2^*$ meson and $\\bar{T}$ is its antiparticle. With the effective\npotentials, we try to find the bound state solutions of the corresponding\nsystems, which provide crucial information of whether there exist the\n$T\\bar{T}$-type molecular states. According to our analysis, we predict some\n$T\\bar{T}$-type molecular states which may be accessible at future experiments\nlike LHCb and forthcoming BelleII.\n", "  We present the Born-Markov approximated Redfield quantum master equation\n(RQME) description for an open system of non-interacting particles (bosons or\nfermions) on an arbitrary lattice of $N$ sites in any dimension and weakly\nconnected to multiple reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical\npotentials. The RQME can be reduced to the Lindblad equation, of various forms,\nby making further approximations. By studying the $N=2$ case, we show that RQME\ngives results which agree with exact analytical results for steady state\nproperties and with exact numerics for time-dependent properties, over a wide\nrange of parameters. In comparison, the Lindblad equations have a limited\ndomain of validity in non-equilibrium. We conclude that it is indeed justified\nto use microscopically derived full RQME to go beyond the limitations of\nLindblad equations in out-of-equilibrium systems. We also derive closed form\nanalytical results for out-of-equilibrium time dynamics of two-point\ncorrelation functions. These results explicitly show the approach to steady\nstate and thermalization. These results are experimentally relevant for cold\natoms, cavity QED and far-from-equilibrium quantum dot experiments.\n", "  The retrieval of black hole information was recently presented in two\ninteresting proposals in the 'Hawking Radiation' conference: a revised version\nby G. 't Hooft of a proposal he initially suggested 20 years ago and, a new\nproposal by S. Hawking. Both proposals address the problem of black hole\ninformation loss at the classical level and derive an expression for the\nscattering matrix. The former uses gravitation back reaction of incoming\nparticles that imprints its information on the outgoing modes. The latter uses\nsupertranslation symmetry of horizons to relate a phase delay of the outgoing\nwave packet compared to their incoming wave partners. The difficulty in both\nproposals is that the entropy obtained from them appears to be infinite.\n  By including quantum effects into the Hawking and 't Hooft's proposals, I\nshow that a subtlety arising from the inescapable measurement process, the\nQuantum Zeno Effect, not only tames divergences but it actually recovers the\ncorrect $1/4$ of the area Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law of black holes.\n", "  In dRGT massive gravity, to get the equations of motion, the square root\ntensor is assumed to be invertible in the variation of the action. However,\nthis condition can not be fulfilled when the reference metric is degenerate.\nThis implies that the resulting equations of motion might be different from the\ncase where the reference metric has full rank. In this paper, by generalizing\nthe Moore-Penrose inverse to the symmetric tensor on Lorentz manifolds, we get\nthe equations of motion of the theory with degenerate reference metric. It is\nfound that the equations of motion are a little bit different from those in the\nnon-degenerate cases. Based on the result of the equations of motion, for the\n$(2+n)$-dimensional solutions with the symmetry of $n$-dimensional maximally\nsymmetric space, we prove a generalized Birkhoff theorem in the case where the\ndegenerate reference metric has rank $n$, i.e., we show that the solutions must\nbe Schwarzschild-type or Nariai-Bertotti-Robinson-type under the assumptions.\n", "  Molecular cloud observations show that clouds have non-thermal velocity\ndispersions that scale with the cloud size as $\\sigma\\propto R^{1/2}$ at\nconstant surface density, and for varying surface density scale with both the\ncloud`s size and surface density, $\\sigma^2 \\propto R \\Sigma$. The energy\nsource driving these chaotic motions remains poorly understood. We describe the\nvelocity dispersions observed in a cloud population formed in a\nkiloparsec-scale numerical simulation of a magnetized, supernova-driven,\nself-gravitating, interstellar medium, including diffuse heating and radiative\ncooling. We compare the relationships between velocity dispersion, size, and\nsurface density measured in the simulated cloud population to those found in\nobservations of Galactic molecular clouds. We find that external supernova\nexplosions can not drive turbulent motions of the observed magnitudes within\ndense clouds. On the other hand, self-gravity also induces non-thermal motions\nas gravitationally bound clouds begin to collapse in our model, and by doing so\ntheir internal velocity dispersions recover the observed relations. Energy\nconservation suggests that the observed behavior is consistent with the kinetic\nenergy being proportional to the gravitational energy. However, the clouds in\nour model show no sign of reaching a stable equilibrium state at any time, even\nfor strongly magnetized clouds. We conclude that gravitationally bound\nmolecular clouds are always in a state of gravitational collapse and their\nproperties are a natural result of this chaotic collapse. In order to agree\nwith observed star formation efficiencies, this process must be terminated by\nthe early destruction of the clouds, presumably from internal stellar feedback.\n", "  We have analyzed a $U(1)$ model which is broken explicitly to a $Z_2$ model.\nThe model results in generating two stable domain walls, in contrast with the\nmore common $N_{DW}=1$ version which is prevalently used to explain axion\ninvisibility for $U_{PQ}(1)$ model. We have been meticulous to take into\naccount any possible relation with previous studies, even if they apparently\nbelong to different lines of research. Then we have scrutinized the domain wall\nproperties of the model,proposing a rigorous approximate solution which fully\nsatisfies boundary conditions and the static virial theorem simultaneously.\nInvoking the mentioned approximation, we have been able to obtain an analytical\ninsight about the effect of parameters on the domain wall features,\nparticularly on their surface energy density which is of great importance in\ncosmological studies when one tries to avoid domain wall energy domination\nproblem. Next, we have mainly focused on the likely inflationary scenarios of\nthe model, including saddle point inflation, again insisting on analytical\ndiscussions to be able to follow the role of parameters. We have tried to\ncategorize any inflationary scenario into the known categories to take\nadvantage of the previous detailed studies under the inflationary topic over\nthe decades. We have concluded that any successful inflationary scenario\nrequires large fields definition for the model. Calculations are mainly done\nanalytically and numerical results are used as supportive material.\n", "  A detailed discussion of the long-range one-pion exchange (Yukawa potential)\ncontribution to the 2S hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen which had, until\nrecently, been disregarded is presented. We evaluate the relevant vertex\namplitudes, in particular $\\pi^0\\mu^+\\mu^-$, combining low energy chiral\nexpansions together with experimental data on $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ decays into\ntwo leptons. A value of $\\Delta{E}^\\pi_{HFS}= -(0.09 \\pm 0.06)\\ \\mu\\rm{eV}$ is\nobtained for this contribution.\n", "  The Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in five dimensions is extended by scalar\nfields and the corresponding equations are reduced to a system of non-linear\ndifferential equations. A large family of regular solutions of these equations\nis shown to exist. Generically, these solutions are spinning black holes with\nscalar hairs. They can be characterized (but not uniquely) by an horizon and an\nangular velocity on this horizon. Taking particular limits the black holes\napproach boson star or become extremal, in any case the limiting configurations\nremain hairy.\n", "  We use the effective field theory (EFT) framework to calculate the tail\neffect in gravitational radiation reaction, which enters at 4PN order in the\ndynamics of a binary system. The computation entails a subtle interplay between\nthe near (or potential) and far (or radiation) zones. In particular, we find\nthat the tail contribution to the effective action is non-local in time, and\nfeatures both a dissipative and a `conservative' term. The latter includes a\nlogarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an\ninfrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone. The origin of\nthis behavior in the long-distance EFT is due to the point-particle limit\n-shrinking the binary to a point- which transforms a would-be infrared\nsingularity into an ultraviolet divergence. This is a common occurrence in an\nEFT approach, which furthermore allows us to use renormalization group (RG)\ntechniques to resum the resulting logarithmic contributions. We then derive the\nRG evolution for the binding potential and total mass/energy, and find\nagreement with the results obtained imposing the conservation of the (pseudo)\nstress-energy tensor in the radiation theory. While the calculation of the\nleading tail contribution to the effective action involves only one diagram,\nfive are needed for the one-point function. This suggests logarithmic\ncorrections may be easier to incorporate in this fashion. We conclude with a\nfew remarks on the nature of these IR/UV singularities, the (lack of)\nambiguities recently discussed in the literature, and the completeness of the\nanalytic Post-Newtonian framework.\n", "  We study Gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in the background of a\nSchwarzschild black hole. We present a Gaussian channel description of quantum\nstate evolution under the influence of the Hawking radiation. We find that\nthermal noise introduced by Hawking effect will destroy the steerability\nbetween an inertial observer Alice and an accelerated observer Bob who hovers\noutside the event horizon, while it generates steerability between Bob and a\nhypothetical observer anti-Bob inside the event horizon. Unlike entanglement\nbehaviors in curved spacetime, here the steering from Alice to Bob suffers from\na \"sudden death\" and the steering from anti-Bob to Bob experiences a \"sudden\nbirth\" with increasing Hawking temperature. We also find that the Gaussian\nsteering is always asymmetric and the maximum steering asymmetry cannot exceed\n$\\ln 2$, which means the state never evolves to an extremal asymmetry state.\nFurthermore, we obtain the parameter settings that maximize steering asymmetry\nand find that (i) $s=arccosh(\\frac{\\cosh^2 r}{1-\\sinh^2r})$ is the critical\npoint of steering asymmetry, and (ii) the attainment of maximal steering\nasymmetry indicates the transition between one-way steerability and both-way\nsteerability for the two-mode Gaussian state under the influence of Hawking\nradiation.\n", "  A scenario of moduli stabilisation based on the interplay between closed and\nopen string sectors is explored in a bottom-up approach. We study N=1 effective\nsupergravities inspired by type IIB orientifold constructions that include\nbackground fluxes and non-perturbative effects. The former generate the\nstandard flux superpotential for the axiodilaton and complex structure moduli.\nThe latter can be induced by gaugino condensation in a non-Abelian sector of\nD7-branes and involve the overall Kaehler modulus of the compactification as\nwell as matter fields. We analyse the dynamics of this coupled system and show\nthat it is compatible with single-step moduli stabilisation in a metastable de\nSitter vacuum. A novelty of the scenario is that the F-term potential suffices\nto generate a positive cosmological constant and to stabilise all moduli,\nexcept for a flat direction that can be either lifted by a mass term or eaten\nup by an anomalous U(1).\n", "  In this paper we present a large database of weak lensing light cones\nconstructed using different snapshots from the Big MultiDark simulation\n(BigMDPL). The ray-tracing through different multiple planes has been performed\nwith the GLAMER code accounting both for single source redshifts and for\nsources distributed along the cosmic time. This first paper presents weak\nlensing forecasts and results according to the geometry of the VIPERS-W1 and\nVIPERS-W4 field of view. Additional fields will be available on our database\nand new ones can be run upon request. Our database also contains some tools for\nlensing analysis. In this paper we present results for convergence power\nspectra, one point and high order weak lensing statistics useful for forecasts\nand for cosmological studies. Covariance matrices have also been computed for\nthe different realisations of the W1 and W4 fields. In addition we compute also\ngalaxy-shear and projected density contrasts for different halo masses at two\nlens redshifts according to the CFHTLS source redshift distribution both using\nstacking and cross-correlation techniques, finding very good agreement.\n", "  We study the scaling and universal behavior of temperature-driven first-order\nphase transitions in scalar models. These transitions are found to exhibit rich\nphenomena, though they are controlled by a single complex-conjugate pair of the\nimaginary fixed points of a $\\phi^3$ theory. Scaling theories and\nrenormalization-group theories are developed to account for the phenomena.\nSeveral universality classes with their own hysteresis exponents are found\nincluding a field-like thermal class, a partly thermal class, and a purely\nthermal class, designated respectively as Thermal Class I, II, and III. The\nfirst two classes arise from the opposite limits of the scaling forms proposed\nand may cross over to each other depending on the temperature sweep rate. They\nare both described by a massless model and a purely massive model, both of\nwhich are equivalent and are derived from the $\\phi^3$ theory via symmetry.\nThermal Class III characterizes the cooling transitions in the absence of\napplied external fields and is described by purely thermal models, which\nincludes cases in which the order parameters possess different symmetries and\nthus exhibiting different universality classes. For the purely thermal models\nwhose free energies contain odd-symmetry terms, Thermal Class III emerges only\nin mean-field level and is identical with Thermal Class II. Fluctuations change\nthe model into the other two models. Using the extant three- and two-loop\nresults for the static and dynamic exponents for the Yang-Lee edge singularity,\nwhich falls into the same universality class to the $\\phi^3$ theory, we\nestimate the thermal hysteresis exponents of the various classes to the same\nprecisions. Comparisons with numerical results and experiments are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  The electronic nematic state without magnetization emerges in various\nstrongly correlated metals such as Fe-based and cuprate superconductors. To\nunderstand this universal phenomenon, we focus on the nematic state in\nTi-oxypnictide BaTi2(As,Sb)2O, which is expressed as the three-dimensional\n10-orbital Hubbard model. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are caused by the\nFermi surface nesting. Interestingly, we find the spin-fluctuation-driven\norbital order due to the strong orbital-spin interference, which is described\nby the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction (AL-VC). The predicted\nintra-unit-cell nematic orbital order is consistent with the recent\nexperimental reports on BaTi2(As,Sb)2O. Thus, the spin-fluctuation-driven\norbital order due to the AL-VC mechanism is expected to be universal in various\ntwo- and three-dimensional multiorbital metals.\n", "  In this article, we describe a new estimate of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) intensity map reconstructed by a joint analysis of the full\nPlanck 2015 data (PR2) and WMAP nine-years. It provides more than a mere update\nof the CMB map introduced in (Bobin et al. 2014b) since it benefits from an\nimprovement of the component separation method L-GMCA (Local-Generalized\nMorphological Component Analysis) that allows the efficient separation of\ncorrelated components (Bobin et al. 2015). Based on the most recent CMB data,\nwe further confirm previous results (Bobin et al. 2014b) showing that the\nproposed CMB map estimate exhibits appealing characteristics for astrophysical\nand cosmological applications: i) it is a full sky map that did not require any\ninpainting or interpolation post-processing, ii) foreground contamination is\nshowed to be very low even on the galactic center, iii) it does not exhibit any\ndetectable trace of thermal SZ contamination. We show that its power spectrum\nis in good agreement with the Planck PR2 official theoretical best-fit power\nspectrum. Finally, following the principle of reproducible research, we provide\nthe codes to reproduce the L-GMCA, which makes it the only reproducible CMB\nmap.\n", "  Recent studies have established that extreme dwarf galaxies --whether\nsatellites or field objects-- suffer from the so called \"too big to fail\"\n(TBTF) problem. Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is\ndifficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed\nnumber density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions\nto the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization\nand baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to\nhost dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the\ndark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this\narticle we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into\naccount the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization\nfeedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in\nquestion are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which\nprofile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends\non the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature\nsample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of\natomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite\nbaryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample\nunder consideration is representative of the general population of field\ndwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be\nas small as a factor of ~ 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the galactic velocity function. Both of these caveats highlight\nthe importance of upcoming uniform surveys with HI interferometers for\nadvancing our understanding of the issue.\n", "  The layered semiconductor black phosphorus has attracted attention as a 2D\natomic crystal that can be prepared in ultra-thin layers for operation as field\neffect transistors. Despite the susceptibility of black phosphorus to\nphoto-oxidation, improvements to the electronic quality of black phosphorus\ndevices has culminated in the observation of the quantum Hall effect. In this\nwork, we demonstrate the room temperature operation of a dual gated black\nphosphorus transistor operating as a velocity modulated transistor, whereby\nmodification of hole density distribution within a black phosphorus quantum\nwell leads to a two-fold modulation of hole mobility. Simultaneous modulation\nof Schottky barrier resistance leads to a four-fold modulation of transcon-\nductance at a fixed hole density. Our work explicitly demonstrates the critical\nrole of charge density distribution upon charge carrier transport within 2D\natomic crystals.\n", "  Analysis of the correlation between the angular positions of distant radio\ngalaxies on the sky and the orientations of their polarization vectors with\nrespect to their major axes, indicates a dipolar anisotropy in the large scale.\nWe consider a single mode of large-scale scalar perturbation to the FRW metric.\nUsing Newman-Penrose formalism, we calculate the rotation of the galaxy major\naxis with respect to the polarization vector as the elliptic image and the\npolarization vector are carried through the perturbed space-time. The\ndependence of the rotation on the polar angular coordinate of the galaxy, is\nqualitatively similar to the claimed dipole pattern.\n", "  In recent years there has been significant debate on whether the edge type of\ngraphene nanoflakes (GNF) or graphene quantum dots (GQD) are relevant for their\nelectronic structure, thermal stability and optical properties. Using computer\nsimulations, we have proven that there is a fundamental difference in the\ncalculated absorption spectra between samples of the same shape, similar size\nbut different edge type, namely, armchair or zigzag edges. These can be\nexplained by the presence of electronic structures near the Fermi level which\nare localized on the edges. These features are also evident from the dependence\nof band gap on the GNF size, which shows three very distinct trends for\ndifferent shapes and edge geometries.\n", "  Magnetization measurements of LaCoO$_{3}$ have been carried out up to 133 T\ngenerated with a destructive pulse magnet at a wide temperature range from 2 to\n120 K. A novel magnetic transition was found at $B>100$ T and $T>T^{*}=32\\pm 5$\nK which is characterized by its transition field increasing with increasing\ntemperature. At $T<T^{*}$, the previously reported transition at $B\\sim65$ T\nwas observed. Based on the obtained $B$-$T$ phase diagram and the\nClausius-Clapeyron relation, the entropy of the high-field phase at 80 K is\nfound to be smaller for about $1.5$ J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$ than that of the\nlow-field phase. We suggest that the observed two high-field phases may\noriginate in different spatial orders of the spin states and possibly other\ndegrees of freedom such as orbitals. An inherent strong correlation of spin\nstates among cobalt sites should have triggered the emergence of the ordered\nphases in LaCoO$_{3}$ at high magnetic fields.\n", "  We study relativistic stars in the simplest model of the de\nRham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity which describes the massive graviton\nwithout ghost propagating mode. We consider the hydrostatic equilibrium, and\nobtain the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the constraint\nequation coming from the potential terms in the gravitational action. We give\nanalytical and numerical results for quark and neutron stars and discuss the\ndeviations compared with General Relativity and $F(R)$ gravity. It is shown\nthat theory under investigation leads to small deviation from the General\nRelativity in terms of density profiles and mass-radius relation. Nevertheless,\nsuch deviation may be observable in future astrophysical probes.\n", "  The extent to which active matter might be described by effective equilibrium\nconcepts like temperature and pressure is currently being discussed intensely.\nHere we study the simplest model, an ideal gas of non-interacting active\nBrownian particles. While the mechanical pressure exerted onto confining walls\nhas been linked to correlations between particles' positions and their\norientations, we show that these correlations are entirely controlled by\nboundary effects. We also consider a definition of local pressure, which\ndescribes interparticle forces in terms of momentum exchange between different\nregions of the system. We present three pieces of analytical evidence which\nindicate that such a local pressure exists, and we show that its bulk value\ndiffers from the mechanical pressure exerted on the walls of the system. We\nattribute this difference to the fact that the local pressure in the bulk does\nnot depend on boundary effects, contrary to the mechanical pressure. We\ncarefully examine these boundary effects using a channel geometry, and we show\na virial formula for the pressure correctly predicts the mechanical pressure\neven in finite channels. However, this result no longer holds in more complex\ngeometries, as exemplified for a channel that includes circular obstacles.\n", "  New nonresonance approach of photon accumulation in two spherical mirrors has\nbeen experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we have received a high\naccumulation coefficient and shown good effectiveness of this technique for\ncreating photo neutralizer of negative ion beams. This efficiency in such\nconcept is generally determined by reflectance mirrors and is practically not\ndependent of input emission quality and does not require high precision\nadjusting the optical elements.\n", "  We describe a method for realizing a high-performance Space-Time Reference\n(STR) using a stable atomic clock in a precisely defined orbit and\nsynchronizing the orbiting clock to high-accuracy atomic clocks on the ground.\nThe synchronization would be accomplished using a two-way lasercom link between\nground and space. The basic concept is to take advantage of the\nhighest-performance cold-atom atomic clocks at national standards laboratories\non the ground and to transfer that performance to an orbiting clock that has\ngood stability and that serves as a \"frequency-flywheel\" over time-scales of a\nfew hours. The two-way lasercom link would also provide precise range\ninformation and thus precise orbit determination (POD). With a well-defined\norbit and a synchronized clock, the satellite cold serve as a high-accuracy\nSpace-Time Reference, providing precise time worldwide, a valuable reference\nframe for geodesy, and independent high-accuracy measurements of GNSS clocks.\nWith reasonable assumptions, a practical system would be able to deliver\npicosecond timing worldwide and millimeter orbit determination.\n", "  The membrane paradigm of black hole is studied in the Chern-Simons modified\ngravity. Derived with the action principle a la Parikh-Wilczek, the stress\ntensor of membrane manifests a rich structure arising from the Chern-Simons\nterm. The membrane stress tensor, if related to the bulk stress tensor in a\nspecial form, obeys the low-dimensional fluid continuity equation and the\nNavier-Stokes equation. This paradigm is applied to spherically symmetric\nstatic geometries, and in particular, the Schwarzschild black hole, which is a\nsolution of a large class of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.\n", "  After its introduction (initially within a group field theory framework) in\n[Tanasa A., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45 (2012), 165401, 19 pages,\narXiv:1109.0694], the multi-orientable (MO) tensor model grew over the last\nyears into a solid alternative of the celebrated colored (and colored-like)\nrandom tensor model. In this paper we review the most important results of the\nstudy of this MO model: the implementation of the $1/N$ expansion and of the\nlarge $N$ limit ($N$ being the size of the tensor), the combinatorial analysis\nof the various terms of this expansion and finally, the recent implementation\nof a double scaling limit.\n", "  We develop new pulse schemes to significantly speed up adiabatic state\ntransfer protocols. Our general strategy involves adding corrections to an\ninitial control Hamiltonian which harness non-adiabatic transitions. These\ncorrections define a set of dressed states that the system follows exactly\nduring the state transfer. We apply this approach to STIRAP protocols and show\nthat a suitable choice of dressed states allows one to design fast protocols\nthat do not require additional couplings, while simultaneously minimizing the\noccupancy of the \"intermediate\" level.\n", "  Using diagrammatic methods we derive an effective interaction between a low\nenergy collective movement of fermionic liquid (acoustic plasmon) and acoustic\nphonon. We show that the coupling between the plasmon and the lattice has a\nvery non-trivial, resonant structure. When real and imaginary parts of the\nacoustic plasmon's velocity are of the same order as the phonon's velocity, the\nresonance qualitatively changes the nature of phonon-drag. In the following we\nstudy how magneto-thermoelectric properties are affected. Our result suggests\nthat the novel mechanism of energy transfer between electron liquid and crystal\nlattice can be behind the huge Nernst effect in bismuth.\n", "  We study the Josephson current in long ballistic superconductor-monolayer\ngraphene-superconductor junctions. As a first step, we have developed an\nefficient computational approach to calculate the Josephson current in\ntight-binding systems. This approach can be particularly useful in the long\njunction limit, which has hitherto attracted less theoretical interest but has\nrecently become experimentally relevant. We use this computational approach to\nstudy the dependence of the critical current on the junction geometry, doping\nlevel, and an applied perpendicular magnetic field. In zero magnetic field we\nfind a good qualitative agreement with the recent experiment of Ben Shalom et\nal. (Reference[12]) for the length dependence of the critical current. For\nhighly doped samples our numerical calculations show a broad agreement with the\nresults of the quasiclassical formalism. In this case the critical current\nexhibits Fraunhofer-like oscillations as a function of the magnetic field.\nHowever, for lower doping levels, where the cyclotron orbit becomes comparable\nto the characteristic geometrical length scales of the system, deviations from\nthe results of the quasiclassical formalism appear. We argue that due to the\nexceptional tunability and long mean free path of graphene systems a new regime\ncan be explored where geometrical and dynamical effects are equally important\nto understand the magnetic field dependence of the critical current.\n", "  The correlation energy of the homogeneous electron gas is evaluated by\nsolving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) beyond the Tamm-Dancoff approximation\nfor the electronic polarisation propagator. The BSE is expected to improve upon\nthe random phase approximation, owing to the inclusion of exchange diagrams.\nFor instance, since the BSE reduces in second order to M{\\o}ller-Plesset\nperturbation theory, it is self-interaction free in second order. Results for\nthe correlatione energy are compared with Quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks and\nexcellent agreement is observed. For low densities, however, we find imaginary\neigenmodes in the polarisation propagator. To avoid the occurence of imaginary\neigenmodes, an approximation to the BSE kernel is proposed, which allows to\ncompletely remove this issue in the low electron density region. We refer to\nthis approximation as the random phase approximation with screened exchange\n(RPAsX). We show that this approximation even slightly improves upon the\nstandard BSE kernel.\n", "  Low-temperature grid generated turbulence is investigated by using numerical\nsimulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The statistics of regularized\nvelocity increments are studied. Increments of the incompressible velocity are\nfound to be skewed for turbulent states. Results are later confronted with the\n(quasi) homogeneous and isotropic Taylor-Green flow, revealing the universality\nof the statistics. For this flow, the statistics are found to be intermittent\nand a Kolmogorov constant close to the one of classical fluid is found for the\nsecond order structure function.\n", "  After a brief historical introduction and recalling basic concepts of stellar\noscillation theory, I focus my review on interpretation of secondary\nperiodicities found in RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids as a manifestation of\nnonradial mode excitation.\n", "  Coupled map lattices are paradigmatic models of many collective phenomena.\nHowever, quite different patterns can emerge depending on the updating scheme.\nWhile in early versions, maps were updated synchronously, there has been in\nrecent years a concern to consider more realistic updating schemes where\nelements do not change all at once. Asynchronous updating schemes and the\ninclusion of time delays are seen as more realistic than the traditional\nparallel dynamics, and, in diverse works, either one or the other has been\nimplemented separately. But are they actually distinct cases? For coupled map\nlattices with adjustable range of interactions, we prove, using both numerical\nand analytical tools, that an adequate delayed dynamics leads to the same\ncompletely synchronized states as an asynchronous update, providing a unified\nframework to identify the stability conditions for complete synchronization.\n", "  We present the K-band luminosity-halo mass relation, $L_{K,500}-M_{500,WL}$,\nfor a subsample of 20 of the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey observed\nwith WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). For the first time,\nwe have measured this relation via weak-lensing analysis down to $M_{500,WL}\n=3.5 \\times 10^{13}\\,M_\\odot$. This allows us to investigate whether the slope\nof the $L_K-M$ relation is different for groups and clusters, as seen in other\nworks. The clusters in our sample span a wide range in mass, $M_{500,WL}\n=0.35-12.10 \\times 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$, at $0<z<0.6$. The K-band luminosity\nscales as $\\log_{10}(L_{K,500}/10^{12}L_\\odot) \\propto \\beta\nlog_{10}(M_{500,WL}/10^{14}M_\\odot)$ with $\\beta = 0.85^{+0.35}_{-0.27}$ and an\nintrinsic scatter of $\\sigma_{lnL_K|M} =0.37^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. Combining our\nsample with some clusters in the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS)\npresent in the literature, we obtain a slope of $1.05^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ and an\nintrinsic scatter of $0.14^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. The flattening in the $L_K-M$ seen\nin previous works is not seen here and might be a result of a bias in the mass\nmeasurement due to assumptions on the dynamical state of the systems. We also\nstudy the richness-mass relation and find that group-sized halos have more\ngalaxies per unit halo mass than massive clusters. However, the brightest\ncluster galaxy (BCG) in low-mass systems contributes a greater fraction to the\ntotal cluster light than BCGs do in massive clusters; the luminosity gap\nbetween the two brightest galaxies is more prominent for group-sized halos.\nThis result is a natural outcome of the hierarchical growth of structures,\nwhere massive galaxies form and gain mass within low-mass groups and are\nultimately accreted into more massive clusters to become either part of the BCG\nor one of the brighter galaxies. [Abridged]\n", "  This article belongs to the first series of XXL publications. It presents\nmultifibre spectroscopic observations of three 0.55 sq.deg. fields in the XXL\nSurvey, which were selected on the basis of their high density of\nX-ray-detected clusters. The observations were obtained with the\nAutoFib2+WYFFOS (AF2) wide-field fibre spectrograph mounted on the 4.2m William\nHerschel Telescope. The paper first describes the scientific rationale, the\npreparation, the data reduction, and the results of the observations, and then\npresents a study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) within three superclusters. We\nobtained redshifts for 455 galaxies in total, 56 of which are counterparts of\nX-ray point-like sources. We were able to determine the redshift of the merging\nsupercluster XLSSC-e, which consists of six individual clusters at z~0.43, and\nwe confirmed the redshift of supercluster XLSSC-d at z~0.3. More importantly,\nwe discovered a new supercluster, XLSSC-f, that comprises three galaxy clusters\nalso at z~0.3. We find a significant 2D overdensity of X-ray point-like sources\nonly around the supercluster XLSSC-f. This result is also supported by the\nspatial (3D) analysis of XLSSC-f, where we find four AGN with compatible\nspectroscopic redshifts and possibly one more with compatible photometric\nredshift. In addition, we find two AGN (3D analysis) at the redshift of\nXLSSC-e, but no AGN in XLSSC-d. Comparing these findings with the optical\ngalaxy overdensity we conclude that the total number of AGN in the area of the\nthree superclusters significantly exceeds the field expectations. The\ndifference in the AGN frequency between the three superclusters cannot be\nexplained by the present study because of small number statistics. Further\nanalysis of a larger number of superclusters within the 50 sq. deg. of the XXL\nis needed before any conclusions on the effect of the supercluster environment\non AGN can be reached.\n", "  One major problem of current theoretical models of galaxy formation is given\nby their inability to reproduce the apparently `anti-hierarchical' evolution of\ngalaxy assembly: massive galaxies appear to be in place since $z\\sim 3$, while\na significant increase of the number densities of low mass galaxies is measured\nwith decreasing redshift. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of the\ninfluence of different stellar feedback schemes, carried out in the framework\nof GAEA, a new semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. It includes a\nself-consistent treatment for the timings of gas, metal and energy recycling,\nand for the chemical yields. We show this to be crucial to use observational\nmeasurements of the metallicity as independent and powerful constraints for the\nadopted feedback schemes. The observed trends can be reproduced in the\nframework of either a strong ejective or preventive feedback model. In the\nformer case, the gas ejection rate must decrease significantly with cosmic time\n(as suggested by parametrizations of the cosmological `FIRE' simulations).\nIrrespective of the feedback scheme used, our successful models always imply\nthat up to 60-70 per cent of the baryons reside in an `ejected' reservoir and\nare unavailable for cooling at high redshift. The same schemes predict physical\nproperties of model galaxies (e.g. gas content, colour, age, and metallicity)\nthat are in much better agreement with observational data than our fiducial\nmodel. The overall fraction of passive galaxies is found to be primarily\ndetermined by internal physical processes, with environment playing a secondary\nrole.\n", "  The nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) stands out as the dispersive\nnonlinear partial differential equation that plays a prominent role in the\nmodeling and understanding of the wave phenomena relevant to many fields of\nnonlinear physics. The question of random input problems in the one-dimensional\nand integrable NLSE enters within the framework of integrable turbulence, and\nthe specific question of the formation of rogue waves (RWs) has been recently\nextensively studied in this context. The determination of exact analytic\nsolutions of the focusing 1D-NLSE prototyping RW events of statistical\nrelevance is now considered as the problem of central importance. Here we\naddress this question from the perspective of the inverse scattering transform\n(IST) method that relies on the integrable nature of the wave equation. We\ndevelop a conceptually new approach to the RW classification in which\nappropriate, locally coherent structures are specifically isolated from a\nglobally incoherent wave train to be subsequently analyzed by implementing a\nnumerical IST procedure relying on a spatial periodization of the object under\nconsideration. Using this approach we extend the existing classifications of\nthe prototypes of RWs from standard breathers and their collisions to more\ngeneral nonlinear modes characterized by their nonlinear spectra.\n", "  Quadratic gravity presents us with a renormalizable, asymptotically free\ntheory of quantum gravity. When its couplings grow strong at some scale, as in\nQCD, then this strong scale sets the Planck mass. QCD has a gluon that does not\nappear in the physical spectrum. Quadratic gravity has a spin-2 ghost that we\nconjecture does not appear in the physical spectrum. We discuss how the QCD\nanalogy leads to this conjecture and to the possible emergence of general\nrelativity. Certain aspects of the QCD path integral and its measure are also\nsimilar for quadratic gravity. With the addition of the Einstein-Hilbert term,\nquadratic gravity has a dimensionful parameter that seems to control a quantum\nphase transition and the size of a mass gap in the strong phase.\n", "  In biorthogonal quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of a quasi-Hermitian\noperator and those of its adjoint are biorthogonal and complete and the\nprobability for a transition from a quantum state to any one of these\neigenvectors is positive definite. We apply this formalism to the long standing\nproblem of the position observable in quantum field theory. The dual bases are\npositive and negative frequency one-particle states created by the field\noperator and its conjugate and biorthogonality is a consequence of their\ncommutation relations. In these biorthogonal bases the position operator is\ncovariant and the Klein-Gordon wave function is localized. We find that the\ninvariant probability for a transition from a one-photon state to a position\neigenvector is the first order Glauber correlation function, bridging the gap\nbetween photon counting and the sensitivity of light detectors to\nelectromagnetic energy density.\n", "  A 750 GeV resonance has been observed at the Run 2 LHC in the diphoton\nchannel. In this paper, we explain this resonance as a CP-even scalar, S, that\ntriggers the spontaneous breaking of local $U(1)_B$ or $U(1)_{B+L}$ gauge\nsymmetries. S couples to gluon and photon pairs at the one-loop level, where\nparticles running in the loop are originally introduced to cancel anomalies.\nThe gluon fusion is the dominate production channel of S at the LHC. The model\nautomatically contains a scalar dark matter candidate, stabilized by the new\ngauge symmetry. Our study shows that both the observed production cross section\nat the LHC and the best fit decay width of S can be explained in this concrete\nmodel, without conflicting with any experimental data. Constraints on couplings\nof S are studied, which shows a negligible mixing with the standard model Higgs\nboson but sizable coupling with the dark matter.\n", "  The search for extra dimensions has so far yielded no positive results at the\nLHC. Along with the discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs boson, this implies a moderate\ndegree of fine tuning in the parameter space of the Randall-Sundrum model.\nWithin a 6-dimensional warped compactification scenario, with its own\ninteresting phenomenological consequences, the parameters associated with the\nadditional spatial direction can be used to eliminate the need for fine tuning.\nWe examine the constraints on this model due to the 8 TeV LHC data and survey\nthe parameter space that could be probed at the 14 TeV run of the LHC. We also\nidentify the region of parameter space that is consistent with the recently\nreported excess in the diphoton channel in the 13 TeV data. Finally, as an\nalternative explanation for the observed excess, we discuss a scenario with\nbrane-localized Einstein-Hilbert terms with Standard Model fields in the bulk.\n", "  We present the results of a study of the amount and distribution of cold\natomic gas, as well its correlation with recent star formation in a sample of\nextremely faint dwarf irregular galaxies. Our sample is drawn from the Faint\nIrregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) and its extension, FIGGS2. We use two\ndifferent methods to identify cold atomic gas. In the first method,\nline-of-sight HI spectra were decomposed into multiple Gaussian components and\nnarrow Gaussian components were identified as cold HI. In the second method,\nthe brightness temperature (T_B) is used as a tracer of cold HI. We find that\nthe amount of cold gas identified using the T_B method is significantly larger\nthan the amount of gas identified using Gaussian decomposition. We also find\nthat a large fraction of the cold gas identified using the T_B method is\nspatially coincident with regions of recent star formation, although the\nconverse is not true. That is only a small fraction of the regions with recent\nstar formation are also covered by cold gas. For regions where the star\nformation and the cold gas overlap, we study the relationship between the star\nformation rate density and the cold \\HI column density. We find that the star\nformation rate density has a power law dependence on the HI column density, but\nthat the slope of this power law is significantly flatter than that of the\ncanonical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\n", "  We combine and extend the analyses of effective scalar, vector, Majorana and\nDirac fermion Higgs portal models of dark matter (DM), in which DM couples to\nthe Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson via an operator of the form\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\textrm{DM}}\\, H^\\dagger H$. For the fermion models, we take an\nadmixture of scalar $\\overline{\\psi} \\psi$ and pseudoscalar $\\overline{\\psi}\ni\\gamma_5 \\psi$ interaction terms. For each model, we apply constraints on the\nparameter space based on the Planck measured DM relic density and the LHC\nlimits on the Higgs invisible branching ratio. For the first time, we perform a\nconsistent study of the indirect detection prospects for these models based on\nthe WMAP7/Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background, a combined\nanalysis of 15 dwarf spheroidal galaxies by Fermi-LAT and the upcoming\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We also perform a correct treatment of the\nmomentum-dependent direct search cross section that arises from the\npseudoscalar interaction term in the fermionic DM theories. We find, in line\nwith previous studies, that current and future direct search experiments such\nas LUX and XENON1T can exclude much of the parameter space, and we demonstrate\nthat a joint observation in both indirect and direct searches is possible for\nhigh mass weakly interacting massive particles. In the case of a pure\npseudoscalar interaction of a fermionic DM candidate, future gamma-ray searches\nare the only class of experiment capable of probing the high mass range of the\ntheory.\n", "  It has recently been proposed and experimentally demonstrated that it is\npossible to generate large thermoelectric effects in ferromagnet/superconductor\nstructures due to a spin-dependent particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we\ntheoretically show that quasiparticle tunneling between two spin-split\nsuperconductors enhances the thermoelectric response manyfold compared to when\nonly one such superconductor is used, generating Seebeck coefficients\n($\\mathcal{S} > 1$ mV/K) and figures of merit ($ZT \\simeq 40$) far exceeding\nthe best bulk thermoelectric materials, and also becomes more resilient toward\ninelastic scattering processes. We present a generalized Onsager\nresponse-matrix which takes into account spin-dependent voltage and temperature\ngradients. Moreover, we show that thermally induced spin currents created in\nsuch junctions, even in the absence of a polarized tunneling barrier, also\nbecome largest in the case where a spin-dependent particle-hole asymmetry\nexists on both sides of the barrier. We determine how these thermal spin\ncurrents can be tuned both in magnitude and sign by several parameters,\nincluding the external field, temperature, and the superconducting\nphase-difference.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of spontaneous and\nstimulated forward Brillouin scattering. This general treatment incorporates\nthe optomechanical coupling produced by boundary-induced radiation pressures\n(boundary motion) and material-induced electrostrictive forces (photo-elastic\neffects), permitting straightforward application to a range of emerging micro-\nand nano-scale optomechanical systems. Through a self-consistent fully coupled\nnonlinear treatment, developed within a general Hamiltonian framework, we\nestablish the connection between the power spectral density of spontaneously\nscattered light in forward Brillouin interactions and the nonlinear coupling\nstrength. We show that, in sharp contrast to backward Brillouin scattering,\nnoise-initiated stimulated forward Brillouin scattering is forbidden in the\nmajority of experimental systems. In fact, the single-pass gain, which\ncharacterizes the threshold for energy transfer in back-scattering processes,\nis negative for a large class of forward Brillouin devices. Beyond this\nfrequent experimental case, we explore mechanisms for dispersive symmetry\nbreaking that lead to amplification and dynamics reminiscent of backward\nBrillouin scattering.\n", "  We show that a tiny correction to the inflaton potential can make critical\nchanges in the inflationary observables for some types of inflation models.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a Fock-state filter based on\nthe photon-number dependent group delay in cavity induced transparency proposed\nin Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 013601 (2010). We derive a general expression for the\npropagation velocity of different photon-number components of a light pulse\ninteracting with an optically dense ensemble of three-level atoms coupled to a\nresonator mode under conditions of cavity induced transparency. These\npredictions are compared to numerical simulations of the propagation of few\nphoton wave packets, and an estimation for experimental realization is made.\n", "  In 1985 Haken, Kelso and Bunz proposed a system of coupled nonlinear\noscillators as a model of rhythmic movement patterns in human bimanual\ncoordination. Since then, the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model has become a\nmodelling paradigm applied extensively in all areas of movement science,\nincluding interpersonal motor coordination. However all previous studies have\nfollowed the line of analysis based on the slow varying amplitude and rotating\nwave approximations. These approximations lead to a reduced system comprised of\na single differential equation representing the evolution of the relative phase\nof the two coupled oscillators. Here we take a different approach and\nsystematically investigate the behaviour of the HKB model in the full\nfour-dimensional state space. We perform detailed numerical bifurcation\nanalyses and reveal that the HKB model supports previously unreported dynamical\nregimes as well as bi-stability between a variety of coordination patterns.\nFurthermore, we identify the stability boundaries of distinct coordination\nregimes in the model and discuss the applicability of our findings to\ninterpersonal coordination and other joint-action tasks.\n", "  We study the dual CFT description of the $d+1$-dimensional\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-Anti de Sitter (RN-AdS$_{d+1}$) black hole in the large\ndimension (large $d$) limit, both for the extremal and nonextremal cases. The\ncentral charge of the dual CFT$_2$ (or chiral CFT$_1$) is calculated for the\nnear horizon near extremal geometry which possess an AdS$_2$ structure.\nBesides, the $Q$-picture hidden conformal symmetry in the nonextremal\nbackground can be naturally obtained by a probe charged scalar field in the\nlarge $d$ limit, without the need to input the usual limits to probe the hidden\nconformal symmetry. Furthermore, an new dual CFT description of the nonextremal\nRN-AdS$_{d+1}$ black hole is found in the large $d$ limit and the duality is\nanalyzed by comparing the entropies, the absorption cross sections and the\nretarded Green's functions obtained both from the gravity and the dual CFT\nsides.\n", "  With the help of linear pulsation models we briefly discuss the peculiar\nperiod ratios characteristic for modulated double-mode RR Lyrae stars.\n", "  A hint of a new resonance at a mass of 750\\,GeV has been observed in the\ndiphoton channel of LHC Run 2 at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The signal rate is too\nlarge to interpret it as a new Higgs boson in the context of weakly-coupled\nrenormalizable models. One way is to reduce its total decay rate, which is\npossible if the CP-even heavy Higgs boson $H^0$ in the aligned two Higgs\ndoublet model becomes top-phobic. To ensure sufficient gluon fusion production,\nwe introduce vector-like quarks (VLQ). The Higgs precision data as well as the\nexclusion limits from no excesses in other 8 TeV LHC searches of $Z\\gamma$,\n$b\\bar{b}$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and $jj$ channels are simultaneously included. In\nType I, top-phobic $H^0$ cannot explain the 750\\,GeV diphoton signal and the\nHiggs precision data simultaneously since the universal Yukawa couplings of the\nup-type and down-type VLQs always make more contribution to $h^0$ than to\n$H^0$. In Type II, small Yukawa coupling of the up-type VLQ but sizable Yukawa\ncoupling for the down-type VLQ is shown to explain the signal while satisfying\nother LHC exclusion limits.\n", "  We study the possibility of a heavy scalar or pseudoscalar in TeV-scale\nbeyond the Standard Model scenarios being the inflaton of the early universe in\nlight of the recent O(750) GeV diphoton excess at the LHC. We consider a\nscenario in which the new scalar or pseudoscalar couples to the Standard Model\ngauge bosons at the loop level through new massive Standard Model charged\nvectorlike fermions with or without dark fermions. We calculate the\nrenormalization group running of both the Standard Model and the new scalar\ncouplings, and present two different models that are perturbative and with a\nstabilized vacuum up to near the Planck scale. Thus, the Standard Model Higgs\nand this possible new resonance may still preserve the minimalist features of\nHiggs inflation.\n", "  The first data from the LHC Run-2 have shown a possible excess in diphoton\nevents with invariant mass $\\sim 750$ GeV, suggesting the existence of a new\nresonance which may decay dominantly into dark matter (DM) particles. We show\nin a simple model that the reported diphoton excess at the LHC is consistent\nwith another photon excess, the $2$ GeV excess in cosmic gamma-ray fluxes\ntowards the Galactic Center observed by the Fermi-LAT. Both the excesses can be\nsimultaneously explained by a $\\sim 60$ GeV scalar DM particle annihilating\ndominantly into two gluons with a typical thermal annihilation cross section,\nwhich leads to the prediction of a large width to mass ratio $\\Gamma/M\\approx\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ of the resonance. The upper limit on the dijet search at\nLHC Run-1 leads to a $lower$ limit on the predicted cross section for DM\nannihilating into $\\gamma\\gamma$ final states $\\langle\\sigma\nv\\rangle_{\\gamma\\gamma}\n\\gtrsim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-30})~\\mbox{cm}^{3}\\mbox{s}^{-1}$. Both the predictions\ncan be tested by the LHC, Fermi-LAT and future experiments.\n", "  We report the first lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic vacuum\npolarization disconnected contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment at\nphysical pion mass. The calculation uses a refined noise-reduction technique\nwhich enabled the control of statistical uncertainties at the desired level\nwith modest computational effort. Measurements were performed on the $48^3\n\\times 96$ physical-pion-mass lattice generated by the RBC and UKQCD\ncollaborations. We find $a_\\mu^{\\rm HVP~(LO)~DISC} = -9.6(3.3)(2.3)\\times\n10^{-10}$, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic.\n", "  Photometric surveys produce large-area maps of the galaxy distribution, but\nwith less accurate redshift information than is obtained from spectroscopic\nmethods. Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy\nmagnitudes, or colors, that are obtained through multi-band imaging to produce\na probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used\nsimulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to\nassign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular\nclustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire\nPDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are\nless biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin\nwidths are $\\Delta z=0.1$, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical\nmeasurement bias from 5%, when using single point estimates, to 3%.\n", "  Penning ionization reactions in merged beams with precisely controlled\ncollision energies have been shown to accurately probe quantum mechanical\neffects in reactive collisions. A complete microscopic understanding of the\nreaction is, however, faced with two major challenges---the highly excited\ncharacter of the reaction's entrance channel and the limited precision of even\nthe best state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, we suggest\nphotoassociation spectroscopy as a tool to identify the character of orbiting\nresonances in the entrance channel and probe the ionization width as a function\nof inter-particle separation. We introduce the basic concept and discuss the\ngeneral conditions under which this type of spectroscopy will be successful.\n", "  A large spin-accumulation voltage of more than 1.5 mV at 1 mA, i.e., a\nmagnetoresistance of 1.5 {\\Omega}, was measured by means of the local\nthree-terminal magnetoresistance in nondegenerate Si-based lateral spin valves\n(LSVs) at room temperature. This is the largest spin-accumulation voltage\nmeasured in semiconductor-based LSVs. The modified spin drift-diffusion model,\nwhich successfully accounts for the spin drift effect, explains the large\nspin-accumulation voltage and significant bias-current-polarity dependence. The\nmodel also shows that the spin drift effect enhances the spin-dependent\nmagnetoresistance in the electric two terminal scheme. This finding provides a\nuseful guiding principle for spin metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect\ntransistor (MOSFET) operations.\n", "  It has recently been shown that BMS supertranslation symmetries imply an\ninfinite number of conservation laws for all gravitational theories in\nasymptotically Minkowskian spacetimes. These laws require black holes to carry\na large amount of soft ($i.e.$ zero-energy) supertranslation hair. The presence\nof a Maxwell field similarly implies soft electric hair. This paper gives an\nexplicit description of soft hair in terms of soft gravitons or photons on the\nblack hole horizon, and shows that complete information about their quantum\nstate is stored on a holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon.\nCharge conservation is used to give an infinite number of exact relations\nbetween the evaporation products of black holes which have different soft hair\nbut are otherwise identical. It is further argued that soft hair which is\nspatially localized to much less than a Planck length cannot be excited in a\nphysically realizable process, giving an effective number of soft degrees of\nfreedom proportional to the horizon area in Planck units.\n", "  We present a simple extension of the standard model (SM) to explain the\ndiphoton excess, reported by CMS and ATLAS at CERN LHC. The SM is extended by a\ndark sector including a vector-like lepton doublet and a singlet of zero\nelectromagnetic charge, which are odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. These vector-like\nleptons assist the additional scalar, different from SM Higgs, to decay to\ndi-photons of invariant mass around 750 GeV and thus explaining the excess\nobserved at LHC. The admixture of neutral component of the vector-like lepton\ndoublet and singlet constitute the dark matter component of the Universe. We\nshow the relevant parameter space for correct relic density and direct\ndetection of dark matter.\n", "  We consider a cosmologically consistent scenario with a heavy Polonyi field.\nThe Polonyi field with a mass of ${\\cal O}(100){\\rm\\,TeV}$ decays before the\nBig-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and avoids the severe constraint from the BBN.\nHowever, the abundance of the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) produced\nfrom the decay often exceeds the observed dark matter density. In our scenario,\nthe dark matter density is obtained by the LSP abundance with an aid of entropy\nproduction, and baryon asymmetry is generated by the Affleck-Dine mechanism. We\nshow that the observed baryon-to-dark matter ratio of ${\\cal\nO}(0.1\\mathchar`-1)$ is naturally explained in sequestering models with a QCD\naxion.\n", "  The magnetic excitations in electron doped (Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_2$IrO$_4$ with\n$x = 0.03$ were measured using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at the Ir\n$L_3$-edge. Although much broadened, well defined dispersive magnetic\nexcitations were observed. Comparing with the magnetic dispersion from the\nparent compound, the evolution of the magnetic excitations upon doping is\nhighly anisotropic. Along the anti-nodal direction, the dispersion is almost\nintact. On the other hand, the magnetic excitations along the nodal direction\nshow significant softening. These results establish the presence of strong\nmagnetic correlations in electron doped Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_2$IrO$_4$ with close\nanalogies to the hole doped cuprates, further motivating the search for high\ntemperature superconductivity in this system.\n", "  With the advent of digital astronomy, new benefits and new challenges have\nbeen presented to the modern day astronomer. No longer can the astronomer rely\non manual processing, instead the profession as a whole has begun to adopt more\nadvanced computational means. This paper focuses on the construction and\napplication of a novel time-domain signature extraction methodology and the\ndevelopment of a supporting supervised pattern classification algorithm for the\nidentification of variable stars. A methodology for the reduction of stellar\nvariable observations (time-domain data) into a novel feature space\nrepresentation is introduced. The methodology presented will be referred to as\nSlotted Symbolic Markov Modeling (SSMM) and has a number of advantages which\nwill be demonstrated to be beneficial; specifically to the supervised\nclassification of stellar variables. It will be shown that the methodology\noutperformed a baseline standard methodology on a standardized set of stellar\nlight curve data. The performance on a set of data derived from the LINEAR\ndataset will also be shown\n", "  In both scotogenic neutrino and flavor dark matter models, the dark sector\ncommunicates with the standard model fermions via Yukawa portal couplings. We\npropose an economic scenario that scotogenic neutrino and flavored mediator\nshare the same inert Higgs doublet and all are charged under a hidden gauged\n$U(1)$ symmetry. The dark Z2 symmetry in dark sector is regarded as the remnant\nof this hidden $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. In particular, we investigate a dark\n$U(1)_D$ (and also a $U(1)_{B-L}$) model which unifies scotogenic neutrino and\ntop-flavored mediator. In this model dark tops and dark neutrinos are the\nstandard model fermion partners, and the dark matter could be inert Higgs or\nthe lightest dark neutrino. This model has rich collider signatures on dark\ntops, inert Higgs and Z' gauge boson, etc. Moreover, the scalar associated to\nthe $U(1)_D$ (and also $U(1)_{B-L}$) symmetry breaking could explain the 750\nGeV diphoton excess reported by ATLAS and CMS recently.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of the properties of the finite-range tensor\nterm associated with the Gogny and M3Y effective interactions. In particular,\nby using a partial wave decomposition of the equation of state of symmetric\nnuclear matter, we show how we can extract their tensor parameters directly\nfrom microscopic results based on bare nucleon-nucleon interactions.\nFurthermore, we show that the zero-range limit of both finite-range\ninteractions has the form of the N3LO Skyrme pseudo-potential, which thus\nconstitutes a reliable approximation in the density range relevant for finite\nnuclei. Finally, we use Brueckner-Hartree-Fock results to fix the tensor\nparameters for the three effective interactions.\n", "  We present the basic idea, implementation, measured performance and\nperformance model of FDPS (Framework for developing particle simulators). FDPS\nis an application-development framework which helps the researchers to develop\nparticle-based simulation programs for large-scale distributed-memory parallel\nsupercomputers. A particle-based simulation program for distributed-memory\nparallel computers needs to perform domain decomposition, redistribution of\nparticles, and gathering of particle information for interaction calculation.\nAlso, even if distributed-memory parallel computers are not used, in order to\nreduce the amount of computation, algorithms such as Barnes-Hut tree method\nshould be used for long-range interactions. For short-range interactions, some\nmethods to limit the calculation to neighbor particles are necessary. FDPS\nprovides all of these necessary functions for efficient parallel execution of\nparticle-based simulations as \"templates\", which are independent of the actual\ndata structure of particles and the functional form of the interaction. By\nusing FDPS, researchers can write their programs with the amount of work\nnecessary to write a simple, sequential and unoptimized program of O(N^2)\ncalculation cost, and yet the program, once compiled with FDPS, will run\nefficiently on large-scale parallel supercomputers. A simple gravitational\nN-body program can be written in around 120 lines. We report the actual\nperformance of these programs and the performance model. The weak scaling\nperformance is very good, and almost linear speedup was obtained for up to the\nfull system of K computer. The minimum calculation time per timestep is in the\nrange of 30 ms (N=10^7) to 300 ms (N=10^9). These are currently limited by the\ntime for the calculation of the domain decomposition and communication\nnecessary for the interaction calculation. We discuss how we can overcome these\nbottlenecks.\n", "  Unidirectional flow is the simplest phenomenon of fluid mechanics. Its\nmathematical description, the Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation in two\ndimensions with constant forcing, arises in many physical contexts, such as the\ntorsion of elastic beams, first solved by de Saint-Venant for complex shapes.\nHere, the literature is unified and extended by identifying seventeen physical\nanalogies for unidirectional flow and describing their common mathematical\nstructure. Besides classical analogies in fluid and solid mechanics,\napplications are discussed in stochastic processes (first passage in two\ndimensions), pattern formation (river growth by erosion), and electrokinetics\n(ion transport in nanochannels), which also involve Poisson's equation with\nnon-constant forcing. Methods are given to construct approximate geometries\nthat admit exact solutions, by adding harmonic functions to quadratic forms or\nby truncating eigenfunction expansions. Exact solutions for given geometries\nare also derived by conformal mapping. We prove that the remarkable geometrical\ninterpretation of Poiseuille flow in an equilateral triangular pipe (the\nproduct of the distances from an interior point to the sides) is only shared by\nparallel plates and unbounded equilateral wedges (with the third side hidden\nbehind the apex). We also prove Onsager reciprocity for linear electrokinetic\nphenomena in straight pores of arbitrary shape and surface charge, based on the\nmathematics of unidirectional flow.\n", "  We study a topological superconductor capable of exchanging particles with an\nenvironment. This additional interaction breaks particle-number symmetry and\ncan be modelled by means of an integrable Hamiltonian, building on the class of\nRichardson-Gaudin pairing models. The isolated system supports zero-energy\nmodes at a topological phase transition, which disappear when allowing for\nparticle exchange with an environment. However, it is shown from the exact\nsolution that these still play an important role in system-environment particle\nexchange, which can be observed through resonances in low-energy and -momentum\nlevel occupations. These fluctuations signal topologically protected Read-Green\npoints and cannot be observed within traditional mean-field theory.\n", "  In this work we consider a singlet scalar propagating in a flat large extra\ndimension. The first Kaluza-Klein mode associated to this singlet scalar will\nbe a viable dark matter candidate. The tower of new particles enriches the\ncalculation of the relic density due effect of coannihilation. For large mass\nsplitting, the model converges to the predictions of the singlet dark matter\nmodel. For nearly degenerate mass spectrum, coannihilations increase the cross\nsections used for direct and indirect dark matter searches. We investigate the\nimpact of the Kaluza-Klein tower associated to singlet scalar for indirect and\ndirect detection of dark matter.\n", "  We present the first multiscalar singlet extension of the 3-3-1 model with\nright-handed neutrinos, based on the $\\Delta \\left( 27\\right) $ family\nsymmetry, supplemented by the $Z_{4}\\otimes Z_{8}\\otimes Z_{14}$ flavor group,\nconsistent with current low energy fermion flavor data. In the model under\nconsideration, the light active neutrino masses are generated from a double\nseesaw mechanism and the observed pattern of charged fermion masses and quark\nmixing angles is caused by the breaking of the $\\Delta \\left( 27\\right) \\otimes\nZ_{4}\\otimes Z_{8}\\otimes Z_{14}$ discrete group at very high energy. Our model\nhas only 14 effective free parameters, which are fitted to reproduce the\nexperimental values of the 18 physical observables in the quark and lepton\nsectors. The obtained physical observables for the quark sector agree with\ntheir experimental values, whereas those ones for the lepton sector also do,\nonly for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. The normal neutrino mass\nhierarchy scenario of the model is disfavored by the neutrino oscillation\nexperimental data. We find an effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter of\nneutrinoless double beta decay of $m_{\\beta \\beta }=$ 22 meV, a leptonic Dirac\nCP violating phase of $34^{\\circ }$ and a Jarlskog invariant of about $10^{-2}$\nfor the inverted neutrino mass spectrum.\n", "  Measuring the thermodynamic properties of open quantum systems poses a major\nchallenge. A calorimetric detection has been proposed as a feasible\nexperimental scheme to measure work and fluctuation relations in open quantum\nsystems. However, the detection requires a finite size for the environment,\nwhich influences the system dynamics. This process cannot be modeled with the\nstandard stochastic approaches. We develop a quantum jump model suitable for\nsystems coupled to a finite-size environment. With the method we study the\ncommon fluctuation relations and prove that they are satisfied.\n", "  We demonstrate how a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate with a movable barrier\ncan be used to realize an atomtronic SQUID. The magnitude of the barrier\nheight, which creates the analogue of an SNS junction, is of crucial\nimportance, as well as its ramp-up and -down protocol. For too low of a\nbarrier, the relaxation of the system is dynamically suppressed, due to the\nsmall rate of phase slips at the barrier. For a higher barrier, the phase\ncoherence across the barrier is suppressed due to thermal fluctuations, which\nare included in our Truncated Wigner approach. Furthermore, we show that the\nramp-up protocol of the barrier can be improved by ramping up its height first,\nand its velocity after that. This protocol can be further improved by\noptimizing the ramp-up and ramp-down time scales, which is of direct practical\nrelevance for on-going experimental realizations.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the orientation of the magnetic field and the\norientation of a quantum dot, with respect to crystallographic coordinates, on\nthe quality of an electrically controlled qubit realized in a gated\nsemiconductor quantum dot. We find that, due to the anisotropy of the\nspin-orbit interactions, varying the two orientations it is possible to tune\nthe qubit in the sense of optimizing the ratio of its couplings to phonons and\nto a control electric field. We find conditions under which such optimal setup\ncan be reached by solely reorienting the magnetic field, and when a specific\npositioning of the dot is required. We also find that the knowledge of the\nrelative sign of the spin-orbit interactions strengths allows to choose a\nrobust optimal dot geometry, with the dot main axis along [110], or\n[1$\\overline{1}$0], where the qubit can be always optimized by reorienting the\nmagnetic field.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations of rotating disk play important roles in the field\nof astrophysical and planetary science. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)\nhas been widely used for such simulations. It, however, has been known that\nwith SPH, a cold and thin Kepler disk breaks up due to the unwanted angular\nmomentum transfer. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this breaking\nup of the disk; the artificial viscosity (AV) and the numerical error in the\nevaluation of pressure gradient in SPH. Which one is dominant has been still\nunclear. In this paper, we investigate the reason for this rapid breaking up of\nthe disk. We implemented most of popular formulations of AV and switches and\nmeasured the angular momentum transfer due to both AV and the error of SPH\nestimate of pressure gradient. We found that the angular momentum transfer due\nto AV at the inner edge triggers the breaking up of the disk. We also found\nthat the classical von-Neumann-Richtmyer-Landshoff type AV with a high order\nestimate for $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v}$ can maintain the disk for $\\sim 100$ orbits\neven when used with the standard formulation of SPH.\n", "  We examine the late-time (t > 200 days after peak brightness) spectra of Type\nIax supernovae (SNe Iax), a low-luminosity, low-energy class of thermonuclear\nstellar explosions observationally similar to, but distinct from, Type Ia\nsupernovae. We present new spectra of SN 2014dt, resulting in the most complete\npublished late-time spectral sequence of a SN Iax. At late times, SNe Iax have\ngenerally similar spectra, all with a similar continuum shape and strong\nforbidden-line emission. However, there is also significant diversity where\nsome late-time SN Iax spectra display narrow P-Cygni features and a continuum\nindicative of a photosphere in addition to strong narrow forbidden lines, while\nothers have no obvious P-Cygni features, strong broad forbidden lines, and weak\nnarrow forbidden lines. Finally, some SNe Iax have spectra intermediate to\nthese two varieties with weak P-Cygni features and broad/narrow forbidden lines\nof similar strength. We find that SNe Iax with strong broad forbidden lines\nalso tend to be more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at peak\nbrightness. We estimate blackbody and kinematic radii of the late-time\nphotosphere, finding the latter an order of magnitude larger than the former.\nWe propose a two-component model that solves this discrepancy and explains the\ndiversity of the late-time spectra of SNe Iax. In this model, the broad\nforbidden lines originate from the SN ejecta, while the photosphere, P-Cygni\nlines, and narrow forbidden lines originate from a wind launched from the\nremnant of the progenitor white dwarf and is driven by the radioactive decay of\nnewly synthesized material left in the remnant. The relative strength of the\ntwo components accounts for the diversity of late-time SN Iax spectra. This\nmodel also solves the puzzle of a long-lived photosphere and slow late-time\ndecline of SNe Iax. (Abridged)\n", "  Using an efficient cluster approach, we study the physics of two-dimensional\nlattice bosons in a strong magnetic field in the regime where the tunneling is\nmuch weaker than the on-site interaction strength. We study both dilute, hard\ncore bosons at filling factors much smaller than unity occupation per site, and\nthe physics in the vicinity of the superfluid-Mott lobes as the density is\ntuned away from unity. For hardcore bosons, we carry out extensive numerics for\na fixed flux per plaquette $\\phi=1/5$ and $\\phi = 1/3$. At large flux, the\nlowest energy state is a strongly correlated superfluid, analogous to He-$4$,\nin which the order parameter is dramatically suppressed, but non-zero. At\nfilling factors $\\nu=1/2,1$, we find competing incompressible states which are\nmetastable. These appear to be commensurate density wave states. For small\nflux, the situation is reversed, and the ground state at $\\nu = 1/2$ is an\nincompressible density-wave solid. Here, we find a metastable lattice\nsupersolid phase, where superfluidity and density-wave order coexist. We then\nperform careful numerical studies of the physics near the vicinity of the Mott\nlobes for $\\phi = 1/2$ and $\\phi = 1/4$. At $\\phi = 1/2$, the superfluid ground\nstate has commensurate density-wave order. At $\\phi = 1/4$, incompressible\nphases appear outside the Mott lobes at densities $n = 1.125$ and $n = 1.25$,\ncorresponding to filling fractions $\\nu = 1/2$ and $1$ respectively. These\nphases, which are absent in single-site mean-field theory are metastable, and\nhave slightly higher energy than the superfluid, but the energy difference\nbetween them shrinks rapidly with increasing cluster size, suggestive of an\nincompressible ground state. We thus explore the interplay between Mott\nphysics, magnetic Landau levels, and superfluidity, finding a rich phase\ndiagram of competing compressible and incompressible states.\n", "  The minimal seesaw extension of the Standard Model requires two electroweak\nsinglet fermions in order to accommodate the neutrino oscillation parameters at\ntree level. Here we consider a next to minimal extension where light neutrino\nmasses are generated radiatively by two electroweak fermions: one singlet and\none triplet under SU(2). These should be odd under a parity symmetry and their\nmixing gives rise to a stable weakly interactive massive particle dark matter\ncandidate. For mass in the GeV-TeV range, it reproduces the correct relic\ndensity, and provides an observable signal in nuclear recoil direct detection\nexperiments. The fermion triplet component of the dark matter has gauge\ninteractions, making it potentially detectable at present and near future\ncollider experiments.\n", "  The radio emission from Sgr A$^\\ast$ is thought to be powered by accretion\nonto a supermassive black hole of $\\sim\\! 4\\times10^6~ \\rm{M}_\\odot$ at the\nGalactic Center. At millimeter wavelengths, Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) observations can directly resolve the bright innermost accretion region\nof Sgr A$^\\ast$. Motivated by the addition of many sensitive, long baselines in\nthe north-south direction, we developed a full VLBI capability at the Large\nMillimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT). We successfully detected Sgr\nA$^\\ast$ at 3.5~mm with an array consisting of 6 Very Long Baseline Array\ntelescopes and the LMT. We model the source as an elliptical Gaussian\nbrightness distribution and estimate the scattered size and orientation of the\nsource from closure amplitude and self-calibration analysis, obtaining\nconsistent results between methods and epochs. We then use the known scattering\nkernel to determine the intrinsic two dimensional source size at 3.5 mm:\n$(147\\pm7~\\mu\\rm{as}) \\times (120\\pm12~\\mu\\rm{as})$, at position angle\n$88^\\circ\\pm7^\\circ$ east of north. Finally, we detect non-zero closure phases\non some baseline triangles, but we show that these are consistent with being\nintroduced by refractive scattering in the interstellar medium and do not\nrequire intrinsic source asymmetry to explain.\n", "  We discuss the Giardin\\`a-Kurchan-Peliti population dynamics method for\nevaluating large deviations of time averaged quantities in Markov processes\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{96}, 120603 (2006)]. This method exhibits systematic\nerrors which can be large in some circumstances, particularly for systems with\nweak noise, with many degrees of freedom, or close to dynamical phase\ntransitions. We show how these errors can be mitigated by introducing control\nforces within the algorithm. These forces are determined by an\niteration-and-feedback scheme, inspired by multicanonical methods in\nequilibrium sampling. We demonstrate substantially improved results in a simple\nmodel and we discuss potential applications to more complex systems.\n", "  Recently, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations report excesses around $750$ GeV\nin the diphoton channels. This might be the evidence which reveals new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we consider models with a $750$ GeV\nscalar and vector-like particles, which couple each other through Yukawa\ncouplings. The diphoton decay of the scalar is enhanced by the loop diagrams\ninvolving the extra colored particles. We investigate not only the setup\nrequired by the excesses, but also the LHC constraints, especially concerned\nwith the vector-like particles. We consider the scenario that the extra colored\nparticles decay to quarks and a dark matter (DM) via Yukawa couplings. Then,\nthe signals from the vector-like particles are dijet, $b\\overline{b}$ and/or\n$t\\overline{t}$ with large missing energy. We discuss two possibilities for the\nsetups: One is a model with vector-like fermions and a scalar DM, and the other\nis a model with vector-like scalars and a fermionic DM. We suggest the\nparameter region favored by the excess in the each case, and study the\nconstraints based on the latest LHC results at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and $13$ TeV.\nWe conclude that the favored region is almost excluded by the LHC bounds,\nespecially when the $750$ GeV scalar dominantly decays to DMs. The mass\ndifferences between the vector-like particles and the DM should be less than\n${\\cal O}(100)$ GeV (${\\cal O}(10)$ GeV) to realize the large diphoton signal\nand the large decay width, if the extra colored particle only decays to a top\n(bottom) quark and a DM. Otherwise, these scenarios are already excluded by the\nlatest LHC results.\n", "  We consider theoretically surface plasmon polaritons in Weyl semimetals.\nThese materials contain pairs of band touching points - Weyl nodes - with a\nchiral topological charge, which induces an optical anisotropy and anomalous\ntransport through the chiral anomaly. We show that these effects, which are not\npresent in ordinary metals, have a direct fundamental manifestation in the\nsurface plasmon dispersion. The retarded Weyl surface plasmon dispersion\ndepends on the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and momentum space. For\nWeyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry, the distance between the\nnodes acts as an effective applied magnetic field in momentum space, and the\nWeyl surface plasmon polariton dispersion is strikingly similar to\nmagnetoplasmons in ordinary metals. In particular, this implies the existence\nof nonreciprocal surface modes. In addition, we obtain the nonretarded Weyl\nmagnetoplasmon modes, which acquire an additional longitudinal magnetic-field\ndependence. These predicted surface plasmon results are observable\nmanifestations of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and might have\ntechnological applications.\n", "  We introduce the concept of entropic nonsignaling correlations, i.e.,\nentropies arising from probabilistic theories that are compatible with the fact\nthat we cannot transmit information instantaneously. We characterize and show\nthe relevance of these entropic correlations in a variety of different\nscenarios, ranging from typical Bell experiments to more refined descriptions\nsuch as bilocality and information causality. In particular, we apply the\nframework to derive the first entropic inequality testing genuine tripartite\nnonlocality in quantum systems of arbitrary dimension and also prove the first\nknown monogamy relation for entropic Bell inequalities. Further, within the\ncontext of complex Bell networks, we show that entropic nonlocal correlations\ncan be activated.\n", "  We study instability of plasmons in a dual-grating-gate graphene field-effect\ntransistor induced by dc current injection using self-consistent simulations\nwith the Boltzmann equation. With only the acoustic-phonon-limited electron\nscattering, it is demonstrated that a total growth rate of the plasmon\ninstability, with the terahertz/mid-infrared range of the frequency, can exceed\n$4\\times10^{12}$ s$^{-1}$ at room temperature, which is an order of magnitude\nlarger than in two-dimensional electron gases based on usual semiconductors. By\nComparing the simulation results with existing theory, it is revealed that the\ngiant total growth rate originates from simulataneous occurence of the\nso-called Dyakonov-Shur and Ryzhii-Satou-Shur instabilities.\n", "  We use a damped mass-spring model within an N-body code to simulate the tidal\nevolution of the spin and orbit of a self-gravitating viscoelastic spherical\nbody moving around a point-mass perturber. The damped mass-spring model\nrepresents a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic solid. We measure the tidal quality\nfunction (the dynamical Love number $\\,k_2\\,$ divided by the tidal quality\nfactor $\\,Q\\,$) from the numerically computed tidal drift of the semimajor axis\nof the binary. The shape of $\\,k_2/Q\\,$, as a function of the principal tidal\nfrequency, reproduces the kink shape predicted by Efroimsky (2012a; CeMDA\n112$\\,:\\,$283) for the tidal response of near-spherical homogeneous\nviscoelastic rotators. We demonstrate that we can directly simulate the tidal\nevolution of spinning viscoelastic objects. In future, the mass-spring N-body\nmodel can be generalised to inhomogeneous and/or non-spherical bodies.\n", "  We analyze theoretically the Coulomb scattering processes of highly excited\nexcitons in the direct bandgap semiconductor quantum wells. We find that\ncontrary to the interaction of ground state excitons the electron and hole\nexchange interaction between excited excitons has an attractive character both\nfor $s$- and $p$-type 2D excitons. Moreover, we show that similarly to the\nthree-dimensional (3D) highly excited excitons, the direct interaction of 2D\nRydberg excitons exhibits van der Waals type long-range interaction. The\nresults predict the linear growth of the absolute value of exchange interaction\nstrength with an exciton principal quantum number, and point the way towards\nenhancement of optical nonlinearity in 2D excitonic systems.\n", "  We consider thin fluid films placed on thermally conductive substrates and\nexposed to time-dependent spatially uniform heat source. The evolution of the\nfilms is considered within the long-wave framework in the regime such that both\nfluid/substrate interaction, modeled via disjoining pressure, and Marangoni\nforces, are relevant. We analyze the problem by the means of linear stability\nanalysis as well as by time-dependent nonlinear simulations. The main finding\nis that when self-consistent computation of the temperature field is performed,\na complex interplay of different instability mechanisms results. This includes\neither monotonous or oscillatory dynamics of the free surface. In particular,\nwe find that the oscillatory behavior is absent if the film temperature is\nassumed to be slaved to the current value of the film thickness. The results\nare discussed within the context of liquid metal films, but are of relevance to\ndynamics of any thin film involving variable temperature of the free surface,\nsuch that the temperature and the film interface itself evolve on comparable\ntime scales.\n", "  We propose a scheme that enables the deterministic generation of single\nphonons at GHz frequencies triggered by single photons in the near infrared.\nThis process is mediated by a quantum dot embedded on-chip in an\nopto-mechanical circuit, which allows for the simultaneous control of the\nrelevant photonic and phononic frequencies. We devise new opto-mechanical\ncircuit elements that constitute the necessary building blocks for the proposed\nscheme and are readily implementable within the current state-of-the-art of\nnano-fabrication. This will open new avenues for implementing quantum\nfunctionalities based on phonons as an on-chip quantum bus.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a parallel analysis to the model proposed in [25].\nBy considering the central co-tetrad (instead of the central metric), we\ninvestigate the modifications in the gravitational metrics coming from the\nnoncommutative spacetime of the $\\kappa$-Minkowski type in four dimensions. The\ndifferential calculus corresponding to a class of Jordanian\n$\\kappa$-deformations provides metrics, which lead either to cosmological\nconstant or spatial curvature type solutions of non-vacuum Einstein equations.\nAmong vacuum solutions, we find pp-wave type.\n", "  A metamaterial formed by superconducting circuits or quantum dots can serve\nas active lasing medium when coupled to a microwave resonator. For these\nartificial atoms, in contrast to real atoms, variations in their parameters\ncannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such\na multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a\nself-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The\nreason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to\nresonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms.\nNot only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the\nwidth of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are\nfound for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual\ncoupling. We present relations how the allowed disorder scales with the number\nof atoms and confirm it by a numerical analysis. We also provide estimates for\nthe sample-to-sample variations to be expected for setups with moderate numbers\nof atoms.\n", "  Atomically precise superlattices involving transition metal oxides provide a\nunique opportunity to engineer correlated electron physics using strain\n(modulated by choice of substate) and quantum confinement (controlled by layer\nthickness). Here we use the combination of density functional theory and\ndynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) to study Ni E$_g$ $d$-orbital\npolarization in strained LaNiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ superlattices consisting of four\nlayers of nominally metallic NiO$_2$ and four layers of insulating AlO$_2$\nseparated by LaO layers. The layer-resolved orbital polarization is calculated\nas a function of strain and analyzed in terms of structural, quantum\nconfinement, and correlation effects. The effect of strain is determined from\nthe dependence of the results on the Ni-O bond-length ratio and the octahedral\nrotation angles; quantum confinement is studied by comparison to bulk\ncalculations with similar degrees of strain; correlation effects are inferred\nby varying interaction parameters within our DFT+DMFT calculations. The\ncalculated dependence of orbital polarization on strain in superlattices is\nqualitatively consistent with recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant\nreflectometry data. However, interesting differences of detail are found\nbetween theory and experiment. Under tensile strain, the two inequivalent Ni\nions display orbital polarization similar to that calculated for strained bulk\nLaNiO$_3$ and observed in experiment. Compressive strain produces a larger\ndependence of orbital polarization on Ni position and even the inner Ni layer\nexhibits orbital polarization different from that calculated for strained bulk\nLaNiO$_3$.\n", "  A scalable readout system (SRS) is designed to provide a general solution for\ndifferent micro-pattern gas detectors. The system mainly consists of three\nkinds of modules: the ASIC card, the Adapter card and the Front-End Card (FEC).\nThe ASIC cards, mounted with particular ASIC chips, are designed for receiving\ndetector signals. The Adapter card is in charge of digitizing the output\nsignals from several ASIC cards. The FEC, edged-mounted with the Adapter, has a\nFPGA-based reconfigurable logic and I/O interfaces, allowing users to choose\nvarious ASIC cards and Adapters for different types of detectors. The FEC\ntransfers data through Gigabit Ethernet protocol realized by a TCP processor\n(SiTCP) IP core in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). The readout system\ncan be tailored to specific sizes to adapt to the experiment scales and readout\nrequirements. In this paper, two kinds of multi-channel ASIC chips, VA140 and\nAGET, are applied to verify the concept of this SRS architecture. Based on this\nVA140 or AGET SRS, one FEC covers 8 ASIC (VA140) cards handling 512 detector\nchannels, or 4 ASIC (AGET) cards handling 256 detector channels. More FECs can\nbe assembled in chassis to handle thousands of detector channels.\n", "  We have used photometry from the WASP-South instrument to identify 5 stars\nshowing planet-like transits in their light curves. The planetary nature of the\ncompanions to these stars has been confirmed using photometry from the EulerCam\ninstrument on the Swiss Euler 1.2-m telescope and the TRAPPIST telescope, and\nspectroscopy obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph. The planets discovered are\nhot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range 2.17 to 5.75 days, masses\nfrom 0.3M$_{\\rm Jup}$ to 1.2M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and with radii from 1R$_{\\rm Jup}$ to\n1.5R$_{\\rm Jup}$. These planets orbit bright stars (V = 11-13) with spectral\ntypes in the range F9 to G4. WASP-126 is the brightest planetary system in this\nsample and hosts a low-mass planet with a large radius (0.3 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ ,\n0.95R$_{\\rm Jup}$), making it a good target for transmission spectroscopy. The\nhigh density of WASP-129 A suggests that it is a helium-rich star similar to\nHAT-P-11 A. WASP-133 has an enhanced surface lithium abundance compared to\nother old G-type stars, particularly other planet host stars. These planetary\nsystems are good targets for follow-up observations with ground-based and\nspace-based facilities to study their atmospheric and dynamical properties.\n", "  The unitary equal-mass Fermi gas with zero-range interactions constitutes a\nparadigmatic model system that is relevant to atomic, condensed matter,\nnuclear, particle, and astro physics. This work determines the fourth-order\nvirial coefficient $b_4$ of such a strongly-interacting Fermi gas using a\ncustomized \\textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm. In\ncontrast to earlier theoretical results, which disagreed on the sign and\nmagnitude of $b_4$, our $b_4$ agrees within error bars with the experimentally\ndetermined value, thereby resolving an ongoing literature debate. Utilizing a\ntrap regulator, our PIMC approach determines the fourth-order virial\ncoefficient by directly sampling the partition function. An on-the-fly\nanti-symmetrization avoids the Thomas collapse and, combined with the use of\nthe exact two-body zero-range propagator, establishes an efficient general\nmeans to treat small Fermi systems with zero-range interactions.\n", "  A theoretical formalism for the description of the interaction of microwave\nphotons with a thin (compared to the photon wavelength) magnetic metasurface\ncomprised of dipolarly interacting nano-scale magnetic elements is developed. A\nscattering matrix describing the processes of photon transmission and\nreflection at the metasurface boundary is derived. As an example of the use of\nthe developed formalism, it is demonstrated, that the introduction of a\nmagnetic metasurface inside a microstrip electromagnetic waveguide\nquantitatively changes the dispersion relation of the fundamental waveguide\nmode, opening a non-propagation frequency band gap in the waveguide spectrum.\nThe frequency position and the width of the band gap are dependent on the\nwaveguide thickness, and can be controlled dynamically by switching the\nmagnetic ground state of the metasurface. For sufficiently thin waveguides the\nposition of the band gap is shifted from the resonance absorption frequency of\nthe metasurface. In such a case, the magnetic metasurface inside a waveguide\nworks as an efficient reflector, as the energy absorption in the metasurface is\nsmall, and most of the electromagnetic energy inside the non-propagation band\ngap is reflected.\n", "  We consider a quantum particle in a one-dimensional disordered lattice with\nAnderson localization, in the presence of multi-frequency perturbations of the\nonsite energies. Using the Floquet representation, we transform the eigenvalue\nproblem into a Wannier-Stark basis. Each frequency component contributes either\nto a single channel or a multi-channel connectivity along the lattice,\ndepending on the control parameters. The single channel regime is essentially\nequivalent to the undriven case. The multi-channel driving substantially\nincreases the localization length for slow driving, showing two different\nscaling regimes of weak and strong driving, yet the localization length stays\nfinite for a finite number of frequency components.\n", "  We investigate non-linear elastic deformations in the phase field crystal\nmodel and derived amplitude equations formulations. Two sources of\nnon-linearity are found, one of them based on geometric non-linearity expressed\nthrough a finite strain tensor. It reflects the Eulerian structure of the\ncontinuum models and correctly describes the strain dependence of the\nstiffness. In general, the relevant strain tensor is related to the left\nCauchy-Green deformation tensor. In isotropic one- and two-dimensional\nsituations the elastic energy can be expressed equivalently through the right\ndeformation tensor. The predicted isotropic low temperature non-linear elastic\neffects are directly related to the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with bulk\nmodulus derivative $K'=4$ for bcc. A two-dimensional generalization suggests\n$K'_{2D}=5$. These predictions are in agreement with ab initio results for\nlarge strain bulk deformations of various bcc elements and graphene. Physical\nnon-linearity arises if the strain dependence of the density wave amplitudes is\ntaken into account and leads to elastic weakening. For anisotropic deformations\nthe magnitudes of the amplitudes depend on their relative orientation to the\napplied strain.\n", "  It has been shown that a realistic level of magnetization of dense molecular\ncloud cores can suppress the formation of a rotationally supported disk (RSD)\nthrough catastrophic magnetic braking in the axisymmetric ideal MHD limit. In\nthis study, we present conditions for the formation of RSDs through non-ideal\nMHD effects computed self-consistently from an equilibrium chemical network. We\nfind that removing from the standard MRN distribution the large population of\nvery small grains (VSGs) of ~10 $\\AA$ to few 100 $\\AA$ that dominate the\ncoupling of the bulk neutral matter to the magnetic field increases the\nambipolar diffusivity by ~1--2 orders of magnitude at densities below 10$^{10}$\ncm$^{-3}$. The enhanced ambipolar diffusion (AD) in the envelope reduces the\namount of magnetic flux dragged by the collapse into the circumstellar\ndisk-forming region. Therefore, magnetic braking is weakened and more angular\nmomentum can be retained. With continuous high angular momentum inflow, RSDs of\ntens of AU are able to form, survive, and even grow in size, depending on other\nparameters including cosmic-ray ionization rate, magnetic field strength, and\nrotation speed. Some disks become self-gravitating and evolve into rings in our\n2D (axisymmetric) simulations, which have the potential to fragment into\n(close) multiple systems in 3D. We conclude that disk formation in magnetized\ncores is highly sensitive to chemistry, especially to grain sizes. A moderate\ngrain coagulation/growth to remove the large population of VSGs, either in the\nprestellar phase or during free-fall collapse, can greatly promote AD and help\nformation of tens of AU RSDs.\n", "  Now that ALMA is reaching its full capabilities, observations of sub-mm\nemission line deep fields become feasible. We couple a semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation with a radiative transfer code to make predictions for the\nluminosity function of CO J=1-0 up to CO J=6-5 and [CII] at redshifts z=0-6. We\nfind that: 1) our model correctly reproduces the CO and [CII] emission of low-\nand high-redshift galaxies and reproduces the available constraints on the CO\nluminosity function at z<2.75; 2) we find that the CO and [CII] luminosity\nfunctions of galaxies increase from z = 6 to z = 4, remain relatively constant\ntill z = 1 and rapidly decrease towards z = 0. The galaxies that are brightest\nin CO and [CII] are found at z~2; 3) the CO J=3-2 emission line is most\nfavourable to study the CO luminosity and global H2 mass content of galaxies,\nbecause of its brightness and observability with currently available sub-mm and\nradio instruments; 4) the luminosity functions of high-J CO lines show stronger\nevolution than the luminosity functions of low-J CO lines; 5) our model barely\nreproduces the available constraints on the CO and [CII] luminosity function of\ngalaxies at z>1.5 and the CO luminosity of individual galaxies at intermediate\nredshifts. We argue that this is driven by a lack of cold gas in galaxies at\nintermediate redshifts as predicted by cosmological simulations of galaxy\nformation.\n", "  We have performed magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, neutron powder\ndiffraction, and muon spin relaxation experiments to investigate the magnetic\nground states of the 5$d^2$ double perovskites Sr$_2$YReO$_6$ and\nSr$_2$InReO$_6$. We find that Sr$_2$YReO$_6$ is a spin glass, while\nSr$_2$InReO$_6$ hosts a non-magnetic singlet state. By making detailed\ncomparisons with other 5$d^2$ double perovskites, we argue that a delicate\ninterplay between spin-orbit coupling, non-cubic crystal fields, and exchange\ninteractions plays a key role in the great variation of magnetic ground states\nobserved for this family of materials.\n", "  We study the Drell-Yan process at the Large Hadron Collider in presence of\nthe noncommutative extension of standard model. Using the Seiberg-Witten map,\nwe calculate the production cross-section to the first order in the\nnoncommutative parameter $\\Theta_{\\mu\\nu}$. Although this idea is evolving for\nlong, limited amount of phenomenological analysis was done so far and\ndominantly in the context of linear collider. Some outstanding feature from\nthis non-minimal noncommutative standard model not only modify the couplings\nover SM production channel, also allow additional nonstandard vertices which\ncan play a significant role. Hence in the Drell-Yan process, as studied in\npresent analysis, one also needs to account for gluon fusion process at the\ntree level. Some of the characteristic signatures such as oscillatory azimuthal\ndistributions are outcome of the momentum dependent effective couplings. We\nexplore the noncommutative scale $\\Lambda_{NC} \\ge 0.4~\\rm{TeV}$ considering\ndifferent machine energy ranging from $7~\\rm{TeV}$ to $13~\\rm{TeV}$.\n", "  Recent asteroseismic analyses have revealed the presence of strong (B\n$\\gtrsim 10^5$ G) magnetic fields in the cores of many red giant stars. Here,\nwe examine the implications of these results for the evolution of stellar\nmagnetic fields, and we make predictions for future observations. Those stars\nwith suppressed dipole modes indicative of strong core fields should exhibit\nmoderate but detectable quadrupole mode suppression. The long magnetic\ndiffusion times within stellar cores ensure that dynamo-generated fields are\nconfined to mass coordinates within the main sequence convective core, and the\nobserved sharp increase in dipole mode suppression rates above $1.5 \\, M_\\odot$\nmay be explained by the larger convective core masses and faster rotation of\nthese more massive stars. In clump stars, core fields of $\\sim10^5 \\, {\\rm G}$\ncan suppress dipole modes, whose visibility should be equal to or less than the\nvisibility of suppressed modes in ascending red giants. High dipole mode\nsuppression rates in low-mass ($M \\lesssim 2 \\, M_\\odot$) clump stars would\nindicate that magnetic fields generated during the main sequence can withstand\nsubsequent convective phases and survive into the compact remnant phase.\nFinally, we discuss implications for observed magnetic fields in white dwarfs\nand neutron stars, as well as the effects of magnetic fields in various types\nof pulsating stars.\n", "  The influence of the laser pulse temporal shape on the Nonlinear Thomson\nScattering on-axis photon spectrum is analyzed in detail. Using the classical\ndescription, analytical expressions for the temporal and spectral structure of\nthe scattered radiation are obtained for the case of symmetric laser pulse\nshapes. The possibility of reconstructing the incident laser pulse from the\nscattered spectrum averaged over interference fringes in the case of high peak\nintensity and symmetric laser pulse shape is discussed.\n", "  The uplift of SO(8) gauged N=8 supergravity to 11-dimensional supergravity is\nwell studied in the literature. It is given by consistent relations between the\nrespective vector and scalar fields of both theories. For example, recent work\nprovided non-linear uplift Ans\\\"atze for the scalar degrees of freedom on the\ninternal manifold: the inverse metric and the three-form flux with mixed index\nstructure. However, one always found the metric of the compactified manifold by\ninverting the inverse metric --- a task that was only possible in particular\ncases, e.g. for the G$_2$, SO(3)$\\times$SO(3) or SU(3)$\\times$U(1)$\\times$U(1)\ninvariant solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity.\n  In this paper, I present a direct non-linear uplift Ansatz for the internal\nmetric in terms of the four-dimensional scalars and the Killing forms on the\ncompactified background manifold. Based on this formula, I also find new uplift\nAns\\\"atze for the warp factor and the full three-form flux. Finally, I provide\na direct non-linear uplift Ansatz for the internal four-form field-strength in\nterms of the metric, the flux as well as the four-dimensional scalars and\nbackground Killing forms. This new formula does not require to calculate the\nderivative of the flux.\n  My results may be generalized to other compactifications, e.g. the reduction\nfrom type IIB supergravity to five dimensions.\n", "  We report on a device to electronically stabilize the optical injection lock\nof a semiconductor diode laser. Our technique uses as discriminator the peak\nheight of the laser's transmission signal on a scanning Fabry-Perot cavity and\nfeeds back to the diode current, thereby maintaining maximum optical power in\nthe injected mode. A two-component feedback algorithm provides constant\noptimization of the injection lock, keeping it robust to slow thermal drifts\nand allowing fast recovery from sudden failures such as temporary occlusion of\nthe injection beam. We demonstrate the successful performance of our\nstabilization method in a diode laser setup at 399 nm used for laser cooling of\nYb atoms. The device eases the requirements on passive stabilization and can\nbenefit any diode laser injection lock application, particularly those where\nseveral such locks are employed.\n", "  The time-local master equation for a driven boson system interacting with a\nboson environment is derived by way of a time-local Heisenberg--Langevin\nequation. Extension to the driven qubit fails---except for weak\nexcitation---due to the lost linearity of the system-environment interaction.\nWe show that a reported time-local master equation for the driven qubit is\nincorrect. As a corollary to our demonstration, we also uncover odd asymptotic\nbehavior in the \"repackaged\" time-local dynamics of a system driven to a\nfar-from-equilibrium steady state: the density operator becomes steady while\ntime-dependent coefficients oscillate (with periodic singularities) forever.\n", "  A scheme for the detection of low-intensity optical coherent signals was\nstudied which uses a probabilistic amplifier operated in the non-heralded\nversion, as the underlying non-linear operation to improve the detection\nefficiency. This approach allows us to improve the statistics by keeping track\nof all possible outcomes of the amplification stage (including failures). When\ncompared with an optimized Kennedy receiver, the resulting discrimination\nsuccess probability we obtain presents a gain up to ~1.85% and it approaches\nthe Helstrom bound appreciably faster than the Dolinar receiver, when employed\nin an adaptive strategy. We also notice that the advantages obtained can be\nultimately associated with the fact that, in the high gain limit, the\nnon-heralded version of the probabilistic amplifier induces a partial dephasing\nwhich preserves quantum coherence among low energy eigenvectors while removing\nit elsewhere. A proposal to realize such transformation based on an optical\ncavity implementation is presented.\n", "  Pure {\\it compact} $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory exhibits a phase transition at\ngauge coupling $g \\sim {\\cal{O}}(1)$ separating a familiar weak coupling\nCoulomb phase, having free massless photons, from a strong coupling phase.\nHowever, the phase transition was found to be of first order, ruling out any\nnontrivial theory resulting from a continuum limit from the strong coupling\nside. In this work, a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory is studied with\naddition of a dimension-two mass counterterm and a higher derivative (HD) term\nthat ensures a unique vacuum and produces a covariant gauge-fixing term in the\nnaive continuum limit. For a reasonably large coefficient of the HD term, now\nthere exists a continuous transition from a regular ordered phase to a\nspatially modulated ordered phase. For weak gauge couplings, a continuum limit\nfrom the regular ordered phase results in a familiar theory consisting of free\nmassless photons. For strong gauge couplings with $g\\ge {\\cal{O}}(1)$, this\ntransition changes from first order to continuous as the coefficient of the HD\nterm is increased, resulting in tricritical points which appear to be a\ncandidate in this theory for a possible nontrivial continuum limit.\n", "  Context. Detailed high resolution studies of AGN with mid-infrared (MIR)\ninterferometry have revealed parsec-sized dust emission elongated in the polar\ndirection in four sources.\n  Aims. Using a larger, coherently analyzed sample of AGN observed with MIR\ninterferometry, we aim to identify elongated mid-infrared emission in a\nstatistical sample of sources. More specifically we wish to determine if there\nis indeed a preferred direction of the elongation and whether this direction is\nconsistent with a torus-like structure or with a polar emission.\n  Methods. We investigate the significance of the detection of an elongated\nshape in the MIR emission by fitting elongated Gaussian models to the\ninterferometric data at 12 um. We pay special attention to 1) the uncertainties\ncaused by an inhomogeneous (u,v) coverage, 2) the typical errors in the\nmeasurements and 3) the spatial resolution achieved for each object.\n  Results. From our sample of 23 sources we are able to find elongated\nparsec-scale MIR emission in five sources: three type 2s, one type 1i and one\ntype 1. Elongated emission in four of these sources has been published before;\nNGC5506 is a new detection. The observed axis ratios are typically around 2 and\nthe position angle of the 12 um emission for all the elongated sources seems to\nbe always closer to the polar axis of the system than to the equatorial axis.\nTwo other objects, NGC4507 and MCG-5-23-16 with a reasonably well mapped (u,v)\ncoverage and good signal-to-noise ratios, appear to have a less elongated 12 um\nemission.\n  Conclusions. Our finding that sources showing elongated mid-infrared emission\nare preferentially extended in polar direction sets strong constraints on torus\nmodels or implies that both the torus and the NLR/outflow region have to be\nmodeled together. Especially also models used for SED fitting will have to be\nrevised to include emission from polar dust.\n", "  To gain some sense about the likelihood of measuring the Higgs boson quartic\ncoupling, we calculate the contribution to the triple Higgs production cross\nsection from the subprocesses $q\\bar{q}\\to ZHHH$ and $q\\bar{q}'\\to WHHH$. Our\nresults illustrate that determining this coupling, or even providing\nexperimental evidence that it exists, will be very difficult.\n", "  We study the symmetry-broken phases in two- and three-orbital Hubbard models\nwith lifted orbital degeneracy using dynamical mean field theory. On the\ntechnical level, we explain how symmetry relations can be exploited to measure\nthe four-point correlation functions needed for the calculation of the lattice\nsusceptibilities. In the half-filled two-orbital model with crystal field\nsplitting, we find an instability of the metallic phase to spin-orbital order\nwith neither spin nor orbital moment. This ordered phase is shown to be related\nto the recently discovered fluctuating-moment induced spin-triplet\nsuperconducting state in the orbitally degenerate model with shifted chemical\npotential. In the three-orbital case, we consider the effect of a crystal field\nsplitting on the spin-triplet superconducting state in the model with positive\nHund coupling, and the spin-singlet superconducting state in the case of\nnegative Hund coupling. It is demonstrated that for certain crystal field\nsplittings the higher energy orbitals instead of the lower ones are relevant\nfor superconductivity, and that $T_c$ can be enhanced by the crystal field\neffect. We comment on the implications of our results for the superconductivity\nin strontium ruthenates, and for the recently reported light-enhanced\nsuperconducting state in alkali-doped fullerides.\n", "  We present a physical picture for the emergence of the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya\n(DM) interaction based on the idea of the Doppler shift by an intrinsic spin\ncurrent induced by spin--orbit interaction under broken inversion symmetry. The\npicture is confirmed by a rigorous effective Hamiltonian theory, which reveals\nthat the DM coefficient is given by the magnitude of the intrinsic spin\ncurrent. The expression is directly applicable to first principles calculations\nand clarifies the relation between the interaction and the electronic band\nstructures. Quantitative agreement with experimental results is obtained for\nthe skyrmion compounds Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge.\n", "  To study the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on spin-transfer torque in\nmagnetic materials, we have implemented two theoretical formalisms that can\naccommodate SOC. Using the \"charge-pumping\" formalism, we find two\ncontributions to the out-of-plane spin-transfer torque parameter $\\beta$ in\nballistic Ni domain walls (DWs). For short DWs, the nonadiabatic reflection of\nconduction electrons caused by the rapid spatial variation of the exchange\npotential results in an out-of-plane torque that increases rapidly with\ndecreasing DW length. For long DWs, the Fermi level conduction channel\nanisotropy that gives rise to an intrinsic DW resistance in the presence of SOC\nleads to a linear dependence of $\\beta$ on the DW length. To understand this\ncounterintuitive divergence of $\\beta$ in the long DW limit, we use the\n\"nonequilibrium magnetization\" formalism to examine the spatially resolved\nspin-transfer torque. The SOC-induced out-of-plane torque in ballistic DWs is\nfound to be quantitatively consistent with the values obtained using the\ncharge-pumping calculations indicating the equivalence of the two theoretical\nmethods.\n", "  We show that the black hole binary (BHB) coalescence rates inferred from the\nadvanced LIGO (aLIGO) detection of GW150914 imply an unexpectedly loud GW sky\nat milli-Hz frequencies accessible to the evolving Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (eLISA), with several outstanding consequences. First, up to thousands\nof BHB will be individually resolvable by eLISA; second, millions of non\nresolvable BHBs will build a confusion noise detectable with signal-to-noise\nratio of few to hundreds; third -- and perhaps most importantly -- up to\nhundreds of BHBs individually resolvable by eLISA will coalesce in the aLIGO\nband within ten years. eLISA observations will tell aLIGO and all\nelectromagnetic probes weeks in advance when and where these BHB coalescences\nare going to occur, with uncertainties of <10s and <1deg^2. This will allow the\npre-pointing of telescopes to realize coincident GW and multi-wavelength\nelectromagnetic observations of BHB mergers. Time coincidence is critical\nbecause prompt emission associated to a BHB merger will likely have a duration\ncomparable to the dynamical time-scale of the systems, and is only possible\nwith low frequency GW alerts.\n", "  We consider Langevin equation with dichotomously fluctuating diffusivity,\nwhere the diffusion coefficient changes dichotomously in time, in order to\nstudy fluctuations of time-averaged observables in temporary heterogeneous\ndiffusion process. We find that occupation time statistics is a powerful tool\nfor calculating the time-averaged mean square displacement in the model. We\nshow that the time-averaged diffusion coefficients are intrinsically random\nwhen the mean sojourn time for one of the states diverges. Our model provides\nanomalous fluctuations of time-averaged diffusivity, which have relevance to\nlarge fluctuations of the diffusion coefficient in single-particle-tracking\nexperiments.\n", "  The accumulation of quantum phase in response to a signal is the central\nmechanism of quantum sensing, as such, loss of phase information presents a\nfundamental limitation. For this reason approaches to extend quantum coherence\nin the presence of noise are actively being explored. Here we experimentally\nprotect a room-temperature hybrid spin register against environmental\ndecoherence by performing repeated quantum error correction whilst maintaining\nsensitivity to signal fields. We use a long-lived nuclear spin to correct\nmultiple phase errors on a sensitive electron spin in diamond and realize\nmagnetic field sensing beyond the timescales set by natural decoherence. The\nuniversal extension of sensing time, robust to noise at any frequency,\ndemonstrates the definitive advantage entangled multi-qubit systems provide for\nquantum sensing and offers an important complement to quantum control\ntechniques. In particular, our work opens the door for detecting minute signals\nin the presence of high frequency noise, where standard protocols reach their\nlimits.\n", "  We explore the computation of high-harmonic generation spectra by means of\nGaussian basis sets in approaches propagating the time-dependent\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger equation. We investigate the efficiency of Gaussian functions\nspecifically designed for the description of the continuum proposed by Kaufmann\net al. [J. Phys. B 22, 2223 (1989)]. We assess the range of applicability of\nthis approach by studying the hydrogen atom, i.e. the simplest atom for which\n\"exact\" calculations on a grid can be performed. We notably study the effect of\nincreasing the basis set cardinal number, the number of diffuse basis\nfunctions, and the number of Gaussian pseudo-continuum basis functions for\nvarious laser parameters. Our results show that the latter significantly\nimprove the description of the low-lying continuum states, and provide a\nsatisfactory agreement with grid calculationsfor laser wavelengths $\\lambda$0 =\n800 and 1064 nm. The Kaufmann continuum functions therefore appear as a\npromising way of constructing Gaussian basis sets for studying molecular\nelectron dynamics in strong laser fields using time-dependent quantum-chemistry\napproaches.\n", "  We consider a two parameter family of instantons, which is studied in [Sadun\nL., Comm. Math. Phys. 163 (1994), 257-291], invariant under the irreducible\naction of ${\\rm SU}_2$ on $S^4$, but which are not globally defined. We will\nsee that these instantons produce solutions to a one parameter family of\nPainlev\\'e VI equations ($\\text{P}_{\\text{VI}}$) and we will give an explicit\nexpression of the map between instantons and solutions to\n$\\text{P}_{\\text{VI}}$. The solutions are algebraic only for that values of the\nparameters which correspond to the instantons that can be extended to all of\n$S^4$. This work is a generalization of [Mu\\~niz Manasliski R., Contemp. Math.,\nVol. 434, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2007, 215-222] and [Mu\\~niz\nManasliski R., J. Geom. Phys. 59 (2009), 1036-1047, arXiv:1602.07221], where\ninstantons without singularities are studied.\n", "  In this paper we investigate spectral and phase coherence properties of\nmagnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the spectral transition from large,\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) to sub-ion scales using in-situ measurements of the\nWind spacecraft in a fast stream. For the time interval investigated by Leamon\net al. (1998) the phase-coherence analysis shows the presence of sporadic\nquasi-parallel Alfv\\'en Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves as well as coherent\nstructures in the form of large-amplitude, quasi-perpendicular Alfv\\'en\nvortex-like structures and current sheets. These waves and structures\nimportantly contribute to the observed power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations\naround ion scales; AIC waves contribute to the spectrum in a narrow frequency\nrange whereas the coherent structures contribute to the spectrum over a wide\nfrequency band from the inertial range to the sub-ion frequency range. We\nconclude that a particular combination of waves and coherent structures\ndetermines the spectral shape of the magnetic field spectrum around ion scales.\nThis phenomenon provides a possible explanation for a high variability of the\nmagnetic power spectra around ion scales observed in the solar wind.\n", "  It has been shown that perfect photon absorption can occur in the linear\nexcitation regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), in which photons\nfrom two identical light fields coupled into two ends of the cavity are\ncompletely absorbed and result in excitation of the polariton state of the CQED\nsystem. The output light from the cavity is totally suppressed by the\ndestructive interference and the polariton state can only decay incoherently\nback to the ground state. Here we analyze the perfect photon absorption and\nonset of optical bistability in the nonlinear regime of the CQED and show that\nthe perfect photon absorption persists in the nonlinear regime of the CQED\nbelow the threshold of the optical bistability. Therefore the perfect photon\nabsorption is a phenomenon that can be observed in both linear and nonlinear\nregimes of CQED. Furthermore, our study reveals for the first time that the\noptical bistability is influenced by the input-light interference and can be\nmanipulated by varying the relative phase of the two input fields.\n", "  The transition from quantum to classical physics remains an intensely debated\nquestion even though it has been investigated for more than a century. Further\nclarifications could be obtained by preparing macroscopic objects in spatial\nquantum superpositions and proposals for generating such states for\nnano-mechanical devices either in a transient or a probabilistic fashion have\nbeen put forward. Here we introduce a method to deterministically obtain\nspatial superpositions of arbitrary lifetime via dissipative state preparation.\nIn our approach, we engineer a double-well potential for the motion of the\nmechanical element and drive it towards the ground state, which shows the\ndesired spatial superposition, via optomechanical sideband cooling. We propose\na specific implementation based on a superconducting circuit coupled to the\nmechanical motion of a lithium-decorated monolayer graphene sheet, introduce a\nmethod to verify the mechanical state by coupling it to a superconducting\nqubit, and discuss its prospects for testing collapse models for the quantum to\nclassical transition.\n", "  We have employed both Z-vector method and the expectation value approach in\nthe relativistic coupled-cluster framework to calculate the scalar-pseudoscalar\n(S-PS) P, T -odd interaction constant (W_s) and the effective electric field\n(Eeff) experienced by the unpaired electron in the ground electronic state of\nRaF. Further, the magnetic hyperfine structure constants of ^{223}Ra in RaF and\n^{223}Ra+ are also calculated and compared with the experimental values\nwherever available to judge the extent of accuracy obtained in the employed\nmethods. The outcome of our study reveals that the Z-vector method is superior\nthan the expectation value approach in terms of accuracy obtained for the\ncalculation of ground state property. The Z-vector calculation shows that RaF\nhas a high E_eff (52.5 GV/cm) and W_s (141.2 kHz) which makes it a potential\ncandidate for the eEDM experiment.\n", "  We present an analysis of the morphological classification of 89 luminous\ninfrared galaxies (LIRGs) from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey\n(GOALS) sample using non-parametric coefficients and compare their morphology\nas a function of wavelength. We rely on images obtained in the optical (B- and\nI-band) as well as in the infrared (H-band and 5.8$\\mu$m). Our classification\nis based on the calculation of $Gini$ and the second order of light ($M_{20}$)\nnon-parametric coefficients which we explore as a function of stellar mass\n($M_\\star$), infrared luminosity ($L_{IR}$) and star formation rate (SFR). We\ninvestigate the relation between $M_{20}$, the specific SFR (sSFR) and the dust\ntemperature ($T_{dust}$) in our galaxy sample. We find that $M_{20}$ is a\nbetter morphological tracer than $Gini$, as it allows to distinguish systems\nformed by double systems from isolated and post-merger LIRGs. The\nmulti-wavelength analysis allows us to identify a region in the $Gini$-$M_{20}$\nparameter space where ongoing mergers reside, regardless of the band used to\ncalculate the coefficients. In particular when measured in the H-band, this\nregion can be used to identify ongoing mergers, with a minimal contamination\nfrom LIRGs in other stages. We also find that while the sSFR is positively\ncorrelated with $M_{20}$ when measured in the mid-infrared, i.e. star-bursting\ngalaxies show more compact emission, it is anti-correlated with the B-band\nbased $M_{20}$. We interpret this as the spatial decoupling between obscured\nand un-obscured star formation, whereby the ultraviolet/optical size of a LIRGs\nexperience an intense dust enshrouded central starburst is larger than in the\none in the mid-infrared since the contrast between the nuclear to the extended\ndisk emission is smaller in the mid-infrared. This has important implications\nfor high redshift surveys of dusty sources. [abridged]\n", "  We analyse the vacuum static spherically symmetric space-time for a specific\nclass of non-conservative theories of gravity based on the Rastall's theory. We\nobtain a new vacuum solution which has the same structure as the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter solution in the General Relativity theory obtained with\na cosmological constant playing the r\\^ole of source. We further discuss the\nstructure (in particular, the coupling to matter fields) and some cosmological\naspects of the underline non-conservative theory\n", "  We have revealed general physical conditions for the {\\it maximization} of\nthe network throughput at which free flow conditions are ensured, i.e., traffic\nbreakdown cannot occur in the whole traffic or transportation network. A\nphysical measure of the network -- {\\it network capacity} is introduced that\ncharacterizes general features of the network with respect to the maximization\nof the network throughput. The network capacity allows us also to make a\ngeneral proof of the deterioration of traffic system occurring when dynamic\ntraffic assignment is performed in a network based on the classical Wardrop'\nuser equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) equilibrium.\n", "  Resonant energy transfer, energy transfer upconversion, and energy pooling\nare considered within optical cavities to elucidate the relationship between\nexciton dynamics and donor/acceptor separation distance. This is accomplished\nusing perturbation theory to derive analytic expressions for the electric\ndipole coupling tensors of perfect planar and rectangular channel\nreflectors---directly related to a number of important energy transfer\nprocesses. In the near field, the separation dependence along the cavity axis\nis not influenced by the cavity and is essentially the same as for\nthree-dimensional, free space. This is in sharp contrast to the reduced\nsensitivity to separation found in idealized low-dimensional settings. The\ncavity dynamics only correspond to their reduced dimensional counterparts in\nthe far field where such excitonic processes are not typically of interest.\nThere is an intermediate regime, though, where sufficiently small cavities\ncause a substantial decrease in separation sensitivity that results in one\ncomponent of the dipole-dipole coupling tensor being much larger than those of\nfree space.\n", "  We propose a general coarse-graining method to derive a continuity equation\nthat describes any dissipative system of repulsive particles interacting\nthrough short-ranged potentials. In our approach, the effect of\nparticle-particle correlations is incorporated to the overall balance of\nenergy, and a non-linear diffusion equation is obtained to represent the\noverdamped dynamics. In particular, when the repulsive interaction potential is\na short-ranged power-law, our approach reveals a distinctive correspondence\nbetween particle-particle energy and the generalized thermostatistics of\nTsallis for any non-positive value of the entropic index q. Our methodology can\nalso be applied to microscopic models of superconducting vortices and complex\nplasma, where particle-particle correlations are pronounced at low\nconcentrations. The resulting continuum descriptions provide elucidating and\nuseful insights on the microdynamical behavior of these physical systems. The\nconsistency of our approach is demonstrated by comparison with molecular\ndynamics simulations.\n", "  We have studied the high energy gamma-rays produced in the reaction\n$^{19}$F(p,$\\alpha\\gamma$)$^{16}$O for incident proton energies from 1.5 to 4.0\nMeV over NaF/Ag and CaF$_2$/Ag thin targets in two different sets of data.\nGamma-rays were detected with a High Purity Ge detector with an angle of\n130$^{o}$ with respect to the beam axis. The cross-sections for the high energy\ngamma-rays of 6.129, 6.915 and 7.115 MeV have been measured for the whole group\nbetween 5 and 7.2 MeV with accuracy better than 10\\%. A new energy range was\ncovered and more points are included in the cross-sections data base expanding\nthe existing set of data. Results are in agreement with previous measurements\nin similar conditions.\n", "  The $\\phi$-$\\Lambda(1520)$ interference effect in the $\\gamma p\\to K^+K^-p$\nreaction has been measured for the first time in the energy range from 1.673 to\n2.173 GeV. The relative phases between $\\phi$ and $\\Lambda(1520)$ production\namplitudes were obtained in the kinematic region where the two resonances\noverlap. The measurement results support strong constructive interference when\n$K^+K^-$ pairs are observed at forward angles, but destructive interference for\nproton emission at forward angles. Furthermore, the observed interference\neffect does not account for the $\\sqrt{s}=2.1$ GeV bump structure in forward\ndifferential cross sections for $\\phi$ photoproduction. This fact suggests\npossible exotic structures such as a hidden-strangeness pentaquark state, a new\nPomeron exchange and rescattering processes via other hyperon states.\n", "  The width of the newly observed exotic state $X_b(5568)$ is calculated via\nits dominant strong decay to $% B_s^{0} \\pi^{+}$ using the QCD sum rule method\non the light-cone in conjunction with the soft-meson approximation. To this\nend, the vertex $X_{b}B_{s}\\pi$ is studied and the strong coupling\n$g_{X_{b}B_{s}\\pi}$ is computed employing for $X_b(5568)$ state the\ninterpolating diquark-antidiquark current of the\n$[su][\\overline{b}\\overline{d}]$ type. The obtained prediction for the decay\nwidth of $X_b(5568)$ is confronted and a nice agreement found with the\nexperimental data of the D0 Collaboration.\n", "  The source of CPT-violation in the photon sector of the Standard Model\nExtension arises from a Chern-Simons-like contribution that involves a coupling\nto a fixed background vector field $k_{AF}^\\mu$. These Lorentz- and\nCPT-violating photons have well-known theoretical issues that arise from\nmissing states at low momenta when $k_{AF}^\\mu$ is timelike. In order to make\nthe theory consistent, a tiny mass for the photon can be introduced, well below\ncurrent experimental bounds. The implementation of canonical quantization can\nthen be implemented as in the CPT-preserving case by using the St\\\"uckelberg\nmechanism. We explicitly construct a covariant basis of properly-normalized\npolarization vectors at fixed three-momentum satisfying the momentum space\nfield equations, in terms of which the vector field can be expanded. As an\napplication of the theory, we calculate the Cherenkov radiation rate for the\ncase of purely timelike $k_{AF}^\\mu$, and find a radiation rate at high\nenergies that has a contribution that does not depend on the mass used to\nregulate the photons.\n", "  We consider the proximity effect between Dirac states at the surface of a\ntopological insulator and a ferromagnet with easy plane anisotropy, which is\ndescribed by the \\emph{XY}-model and undergoes a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. The surface states of\nthe topological insulator interacting with classical magnetic fluctuations of\nthe ferromagnet can be mapped onto the problem of Dirac fermions in a random\nmagnetic field. However, this analogy is only partial in the presence of\nelectron-hole asymmetry or warping of the Dirac dispersion, which results in\nscreening of magnetic fluctuations. Scattering at magnetic fluctuations\ninfluences the behavior of the surface resistivity as a function of\ntemperature. Near the BKT phase transition temperature we find that the\nresistivity of surface states scales linearly with temperature and has a clear\nmaximum which becomes more pronounced as the Fermi energy decreases.\nAdditionally at low temperatures we find linear resistivity, usually associated\nwith non-Fermi liquid behavior, however here it appears entirely within the\nFermi liquid picture.\n", "  The spectacular detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from GW 150914 and its\nreported association with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) offer new insights into the\nevolution of massive stars. Here it is shown that no single star of any mass\nand credible metallicity is likely to produce the observed GW signal. Stars\nwith helium cores in the mass range 35 to 133 solar masses encounter the pair\ninstability and either explode or pulse until the core mass is less than 40\nsolar masses, smaller than the combined mass of the observed black holes. The\nrotation of more massive helium cores is either braked by interaction with a\nslowly rotating hydrogen envelope, if one is present, or by mass loss, if one\nis not. The very short interval between the GW signal and the observed onset of\nthe putative GRB in GW 150914 is also too short to have come from a single\nstar. A more probable model for making the gravitational radiation is the\ndelayed merger of two black holes made by 70 and 90 solar mass stars in a\nbinary system. The more massive component was a pulsational-pair instability\nsupernova before making the first black hole.\n", "  We study the structure of the number projected BCS (PBCS) wave function in\nthe particle-hole basis, displaying its similarities with coupled clusters\ntheory (CCT). The analysis of PBCS together with several modifications\nsuggested by the CCT wave function is carried out for the exactly solvable\nRichardson model involving a pure pairing hamiltonian acting in a space of\nequally-spaced doubly-degenerate levels. We point out the limitations of PBCS\nto describe the non-superconducting regime and suggest possible avenues for\nimprovement.\n", "  One century ago pioneering dielectric results obtained for water and\nn-alcohols triggered the advent of molecular rotation diffusion theory\nconsidered by Debye to describe the primary dielectric absorption in these\nliquids. Comparing dielectric, viscoelastic, and light scattering results we\nunambiguously demonstrate that the structural relaxation appears only as a\nhigh-frequency shoulder in the dielectric spectra of water. In contrast, the\nmain dielectric peak is related to a supramolecular structure, analogous to the\nDebye-like peak observed in mono-alcohols.\n", "  We report on the timing and spectral analysis of two Suzaku observations with\ndifferent flux levels of the high-mass X-ray binary KS 1947+300 during its 2013\noutburst. In agreement with simultaneous NuSTAR observations, the continuum is\nwell described by an absorbed power law with a cut-off and an additional black\nbody component. In addition we find fluorescent emission from neutral, He-like,\nand even H-like iron. We determine a pulse period of ~18.8 s with the source\nshowing a spin-up between the two observations. Both Suzaku observations show a\nvery similar behavior of the pulse profile, which is strongly energy dependent,\nwith an evolution from a profile with one peak at low energies to a profile\nwith two peaks of different widths towards higher energies seen in both, the\nSuzaku and NuSTAR data. Such an evolution to a more complex profile at higher\nenergies is rarely seen in X-ray pulsars, most cases show the opposite\nbehavior. Pulse phase-resolved spectral analysis shows a variation in the\nabsorbing column density, NH , over pulse phase. Spectra taken during the pulse\nprofile minima are intrinsically softer compared to the pulse phase-averaged\nspectrum.\n", "  We introduce a generalised relaxation-time-approximation form of the\ncollision term in the Boltzmann kinetic equation that allows for using\ndifferent relaxation times for elastic and inelastic collisions. The efficacy\nof the proposed framework is demonstrated with the numerical calculations that\ndescribe systems with different relations between the two relaxation times and\nthe evolution time of the system.\n", "  We construct, in the work, chiral $SU(3)$ Lagrangian with $D$ mesons of spin\n$J^P=0^-$ and $J^P=1^-$ and charmed baryons of spin $J^P=1/2^+$ and\n$J^P=3/2^+$. There are 42 leading two-body counter-terms involving two charmed\nbaryon fields and two $D$ meson fields in the constructed Lagrangian. The\nheavy-quark spin symmetry leads to 35 sum rules while the large-$N_c$ operator\nanalysis predicts 29 ones at the next-to leading order of $1/N_c$ expansion.\nThe combination of the sum rules from both the heavy-quark symmetry and the\nlarge-$N_c$ analysis results in 38 independent sum rules which reduces the\nnumber of free parameters in the chiral Lagrangian down to 4 only. This is a\nremarkable result demonstrating the consistency of the heavy-quark symmetry and\nlarge-$N_c$ operator analysis.\n", "  Junction systems of odd-frequency (OF) superconductors are investigated based\non a mean-field Hamiltonian formalism. One-dimensional two-channel Kondo\nlattice (TCKL) is taken as a concrete example of OF superconductors. Properties\nof normal and Andreev reflections are examined in a normal metal/superconductor\njunction. Unlike conventional superconductors, normal reflection is always\npresent due to the normal self energy that necessarily appears in the present\nOF pairing state. The conductance reflects the difference between repulsive and\nattractive potentials located at the interface, which is in contrast with the\npreexisting superconducting junctions. Josephson junction is also constructed\nby connecting TCKL with the other types of superconductors. The results can be\nunderstood from symmetry of the induced Cooper pairs at the edge in the\npresence of spin/orbital symmetry breaking. It has also been demonstrated that\nthe symmetry argument for Cooper pairs is useful in explaining Meissner\nresponse in bulk.\n", "  We study the degree to which the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be\nused to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity involving one tensor and two\nscalar fluctuations, focusing on the correlation of one polarization $B$ mode\nwith two temperature modes. In the simplest models of inflation, the\ntensor-scalar-scalar primordial bispectrum is non-vanishing and is of the same\norder in slow-roll parameters as the scalar-scalar-scalar bispectrum. We\ncalculate the $\\langle BTT\\rangle$ correlation arising from a primordial\ntensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum, and show that constraints from an experiment\nlike CMB-Stage IV using this observable are more than an order of magnitude\nbetter than those on the same primordial coupling obtained from temperature\nmeasurements alone. We argue that $B$-mode non-Gaussianity opens up an\nas-yet-unexplored window into the early Universe, demonstrating that\nsignificant information on primordial physics remains to be harvested from CMB\nanisotropies.\n", "  We construct a potential obtained by one-pion exchange for the coupled\nchannel $\\Sigma_c^\\ast$$\\bar{D}$-$\\Sigma_c$$\\bar{D}^\\ast$, and solve the\ncoupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations to determine the binding energy. We find that\nthere exists one or two bound states with the binding energy of several MeV\nbelow the threshold of $\\Sigma_c^\\ast$ and $\\bar{D}$, dominantly made from a\n$\\Sigma_c^\\ast$ baryon and a $\\bar{D}$ meson, with the size of about $1.5$fm\nfor wide parameter region. We also study the pentaquark states including a $b$\nquark and/or an anti-$b$ quark. We show that there exist pentaquarks including\n$c\\bar{b}$, $b\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$, all of which lie at about $10$MeV below\nthe corresponding threshold and have size of about $1.5$fm.\n", "  We explore the collective excitations of optical lattices filled with\ntwo-species Bose-Einstein condensates (TBECs). We use a set of coupled discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations to describe the system, and employ\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory with the Popov approximation to analyze\nthe quasiparticle spectra at zero temperature. The ground state geometry,\nevolution of quasiparticle energies, structure of quasiparticle amplitudes, and\ndispersion relations are examined in detail. The trends observed are in stark\ncontrast to the case of TBECs only with a harmonic confining potential. One key\nobservation is the quasiparticle energies are softened as the system is tuned\ntowards phase separation, but harden after phase separation and mode\ndegeneracies are lifted.\n", "  We used the new ESO VLT instrument MUSE to obtain spectral and imaging\ncoverage of NGC 4710. The wide area and excellent sampling of the MUSE integral\nfield spectrograph allows us to investigate the dynamical properties of the\nX-shaped bulge of NGC 4710 and compare it with the properties of the Milky\nWay's own X-shaped bulge. We measured the radial velocities, velocity\ndispersion, and stellar populations using a penalized pixel full spectral\nfitting technique adopting simple stellar populations models, on a 1' x 1' area\ncentred on the bulge of NGC 4710. We have constructed the velocity maps of the\nbulge of NGC 4710 and we investigated the presence of vertical metallicity\ngradients. These properties were compared to those of the Milky Way bulge and\nas well as to a simulated galaxy with boxy/peanut bulge. We find the\nline-of-sight velocity maps and 1D rotation curves of the bulge of NGC 4710 to\nbe remarkably similar to those of the Milky Way bulge. Some specific\ndifferences that were identified are in good agreement with the expectations\nfrom variations in the bar orientation angle. The bulge of NGC 4710 has a\nboxy-peanut morphology with a pronounced X-shape, showing no indication of any\nadditional spheroidally distributed bulge population, in which we measure a\nvertical metallicity gradient of 0.35 dex/kpc. The general properties of NGC\n4710 are very similar to those observed in the MW bulge. However, it has been\nsuggested that the MW bulge has an additional component that is comprised of\nthe oldest, most metal-poor stars and which is not part of the boxy-peanut\nbulge structure. Such a population is not observed in NGC 4710, but could be\nhidden in the integrated light we observed.\n", "  We describe a scheme for entangling mechanical resonators which is efficient\nalso beyond the resolved sideband regime. It employs the radiation pressure\nforce of the squeezed light produced by a degenerate optical parametric\noscillator, which acts as a reservoir of quantum correlations (squeezed\nreservoir), and it is effective when the spectral bandwidth of the reservoir\nand the fields frequencies are appropriately selected. It allows for the steady\nstate preparation of mechanical resonatrs in entangled EPR states and can be\nextended to the preparation of many entangled pairs of resonators which\ninteract with the same light field, in a situation in which the optomechanical\nsystem realizes a star-like harmonic network.\n", "  X-ray extragalactic surveys are ideal laboratories for the study of the\nevolution and clustering of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The XXL Survey spans\ntwo fields of a combined 50 $deg^2$ observed for more than 6Ms with XMM-Newton,\noccupying the parameter space between deep surveys and very wide area surveys;\nat the same time it benefits from a wealth of ancillary data. This paper marks\nthe first release of the XXL point source catalogue selected in the 2-10 keV\nenergy band with limiting flux\n$F_{2-10keV}=4.8\\cdot10^{-14}\\rm{erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$. We use both public and\nproprietary data sets to identify the counterparts of the X-ray point-like\nsources and improved upon the photometric redshift determination for AGN by\napplying a Random Forest classification trained to identify for each object the\noptimal photometric redshift model library. We also assign a probability to\neach source to be a star or an outlier. We model with Bayesian analysis the\nX-ray spectra assuming a power-law model with the presence of an absorbing\nmedium. We find an average unabsorbed photon index of $\\Gamma=1.85$ and average\nhydrogen column density $\\log{N_{H}}=21.07 cm^{-2}$. We find no trend of\n$\\Gamma$ or $N_H$ with redshift and a fraction of 26% absorbed sources ($\\log\nN_{H}>22$). We show that the XXL-1000-AGN number counts extended the number\ncounts of the COSMOS survey to higher fluxes and are fully consistent with the\nEuclidean expectation. We constrain the intrinsic luminosity function of AGN in\nthe 2-10 keV energy band where the unabsorbed X-ray flux is estimated from the\nX-ray spectral fit up to z=3. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of a\nsupercluster size structure at redshift 0.14, identified by means of\npercolation analysis of the XXL-1000-AGN sample. The XXL survey, reaching a\nmedium flux limit and covering a wide area is a stepping stone between current\ndeep fields and planned wide area surveys.\n", "  Motivated by a high Spitzer IRAC oversubscription rate, we present a new\ntechnique of randomly and sparsely sampling phase curves of hot Jupiters.\nSnapshot phase curves are enabled by technical advances in precision pointing\nas well as careful characterization of a portion of the central pixel on the\narray. This method allows for observations which are a factor of roughly two\nmore efficient than full phase curve observations, and are furthermore easier\nto insert into the Spitzer observing schedule. We present our pilot study from\nthis program using the exoplanet WASP-14b. Data of this system were taken both\nas a sparsely sampled phase curve as well as a staring mode phase curve. Both\ndatasets as well as snapshot style observations of a calibration star are used\nto validate this technique. By fitting our WASP-14b phase snapshot dataset, we\nsuccessfully recover physical parameters for the transit and eclipse depths as\nwell as amplitude and maximum and minimum of the phase curve shape of this\nslightly eccentric hot Jupiter. We place a limit on the potential phase to\nphase variation of these parameters since our data are taken over many phases\nover the course of a year. We see no evidence for eclipse depth variations\ncompared to other published WASP-14b eclipse depths over a 3.5 year baseline.\n", "  New propagation regimes for light arise from the ability to tune the\ndielectric permittivity to extremely low values. Here we demonstrate a\nuniversal approach based on the low linear permittivity values attained in the\nepsilon-near-zero (ENZ) regime for enhancing the nonlinear refractive index,\nwhich enables remarkable light-induced changes of the material properties.\nExperiments performed on Al-doped ZnO (AZO) thin films show a six-fold increase\nof the Kerr nonlinear refractive index ($n_2$) at the ENZ wavelength, located\nin the 1300 nm region. This in turn leads to ultrafast light-induced refractive\nindex changes of the order of unity, thus representing a new paradigm for\nnonlinear optics.\n", "  In the probe limit, we investigate holographic paramagnetism-ferromagnetism\nphase transition in the four-dimensional (4D) and five-dimensional(5D) Lifshitz\nblack holes by means of numerical and semi-analytical methods, which is\nrealized by introducing a massive 2-form field coupled to the Maxwell field. We\nfind that the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$ contributes evidently to magnetic\nmoment and hysteresis loop of single magnetic domain quantitatively not\nqualitatively. Concretely, in the case without external magnetic field, the\nspontaneous magnetization and ferromagnetic phase transition happen when the\ntemperature gets low enough, and the critical exponent for the magnetic moment\nis always $1/2$, which is in agreement with the result from mean field theory.\nAnd the increasing $z$ enhances the phase transition and increases the DC\nresistivity which behaves as the colossal magnetic resistance effect in some\nmaterials. Furthermore, in the presence of the external magnetic field, the\nmagnetic susceptibility satisfies the Cure-Weiss law with a general $z$. But\nthe increase of $z$ will result in shortening the period of the external\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The interplay between Hubbard interaction, long-range hopping and disorder on\npersistent current in a mesoscopic one-dimensional conducting ring threaded by\na magnetic flux $\\phi$ is analyzed in detail. Two different methods, exact\nnumerical diagonalization and Hartree-Fock mean field theory, are used to\nobtain numerical results from the many-body Hamiltonian. The current in a\ndisordered ring gets enhanced as a result of electronic correlation and it\nbecomes more significant when contributions from higher order hoppings, even if\nthey are too small compared to nearest-neighbor hopping, are taken into\naccount. Certainly this can be an interesting observation in the era of\nlong-standing controversy between theoretical and experimental results of\npersistent current amplitudes. Along with these we also find half-flux quantum\nperiodic current for some typical electron fillings and kink-like structures at\ndifferent magnetic fluxes apart from $\\phi=0$ and $\\pm \\phi_0/2$. The scaling\nbehavior of current is also discussed for the sake of completeness of our\npresent analysis.\n", "  We consider how QCD axions produced by the misalignment mechanism could form\ngalactic dark matter halos. We recall that stationary, gravitationally stable\naxion field configurations have the size of an asteroid with masses of order\n$10^{-13} $ solar masses (because gradient pressure is insufficient to support\na larger object). We call such field configurations \"drops\". We explore whether\nrotating drops could be larger, and find that their mass could increase by a\nfactor ~ 10. Remarkably this mass is comparable to the mass of miniclusters\ngenerated from misalignment axions in the scenario where the axion is born\nafter inflation. We speculate that misalignment axions today are in the form of\ndrops, contributing to dark matter like a distribution of asteroids (and not as\na coherent oscillating background field). We consider some observational\nsignatures of the drops, which seem consistent with a galactic halo made of\naxion dark matter.\n", "  We present precise lattice computations for the b-quark mass, the quark mass\nratios mb/mc and mb/ms as well as the leptonic B-decay constants. We employ\ngauge configurations with four dynamical quark flavors, up/down, strange and\ncharm, at three values of the lattice spacing (a ~ 0.06 - 0.09 fm) and for pion\nmasses as low as 210 MeV. Interpolation in the heavy quark mass to the bottom\nquark point is performed using ratios of physical quantities computed at nearby\nquark masses exploiting the fact that these ratios are exactly known in the\nstatic quark mass limit. Our results are also extrapolated to the physical pion\nmass and to the continuum limit and read: mb(MSbar, mb) = 4.26(10) GeV, mb/mc =\n4.42(8), mb/ms = 51.4(1.4), fBs = 229(5) MeV, fB = 193(6) MeV, fBs/fB =\n1.184(25) and (fBs/fB)/(fK/fpi) = 0.997(17).\n", "  We establish the connection between the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and the dwarf\ngalaxy candidates discovered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) by building a\ndynamical model of the MC satellite populations, based on an extensive suite of\ntailor-made numerical simulations. Our model takes into account the response of\nthe Galaxy to the MCs infall, the dynamical friction experienced by the MCs and\nthe disruption of the MC satellites by their hosts. The simulation suite\nsamples over the uncertainties in the MC's proper motions, the masses of the MW\nand the Clouds themselves and allows for flexibility in the intrinsic volume\ndensity distribution of the MC satellites. As a result, we can accurately\nreproduce the DES satellites' observed positions and kinematics. Assuming that\nMilky Way (MW) dwarfs follow the distribution of subhaloes in $\\Lambda$CDM, we\nfurther demonstrate that, of 14 observed satellites, the MW halo contributes\nfewer than 4 (8) of these with 68% (95%) confidence and that 7 (12) DES dwarfs\nhave probabilities greater than 0.7 (0.5) of belonging to the LMC.\nMarginalising over the entire suite, we constrain the total number of the\nMagellanic satellites at ~70, the mass of the LMC around $10^{11}M_\\odot$ and\nshow that the Clouds have likely endured only one Galactic pericentric passage\nso far. Finally, we give predictions for the line-of-sight velocities and the\nproper motions of the satellites discovered in the vicinity of the LMC.\n", "  The Universe's largest galaxy clusters likely built the majority of their\nmassive $>10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxies in simultaneous, short-lived bursts of\nactivity well before virialization. This conclusion is reached from emerging\ndatasets on $z>2$ proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member\ngalaxies, in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). The most challenging observational hurdle in identifying such\nstructures is their very large volumes, $\\sim10^{4}$ comoving Mpc$^3$ at $z>2$,\nsubtending areas $\\sim$half a degree on the sky. Thus the contrast afforded by\nan overabundance of very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more\neasily distinguish overdense structures from the surrounding, normal density\nfield. Five $2<z<3$ proto-clusters from the literature are discussed in detail\nand are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies\neach, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense\nenvironments. Measurements of gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed\nshort-lived on $\\sim$100 Myr timescales, and the probability of finding a\nstructure containing more than 8 such systems is $\\sim$0.2\\%, unless their\n`triggering' is correlated on very large spatial scales, $\\sim$10 Mpc across.\nThe volume density of starburst-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable\nto all $>10^{15} M_\\odot$ galaxy clusters in the nearby Universe, a factor of\nfive larger than expected in some simulations. Some tension yet exists between\nmeasurements of their volume density of starburst-rich proto-clusters and the\nexpectation that they are generated via short-lived episodes. However, improved\nobservations of proto-clusters over large regions of sky will certainly shed\nmore light on the assembly of galaxy clusters, and whether or not they build\ntheir galaxies through episodic bursts as suggested here. [abridged]\n", "  We present analytical results for the distribution of shortest path lengths\nbetween random pairs of nodes in configuration model networks. The results,\nwhich are based on recursion equations, are shown to be in good agreement with\nnumerical simulations for networks with degenerate, binomial and power-law\ndegree distributions. The mean, mode and variance of the distribution of\nshortest path lengths are also evaluated. These results provide expressions for\ncentral measures and dispersion measures of the distribution of shortest path\nlengths in terms of moments of the degree distribution, illuminating the\nconnection between the two distributions.\n", "  The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of an organic photovoltaic device (OPV)\nis proportional to the number of free charge carriers generated and their\nconductivity, per absorbed photon. However, both the IQE and the quantities\nthat determine it, for example, electron-hole binding, charge separation,\nelectron-hole recombination, and conductivity, can only be inferred indirectly\nfrom experiments. Using density functional theory, we calculate the\nexcited-state formation energy, charge transfer, and zero-bias conductance in\nthe singlet ground state and triplet excited state across polymer/fullerene and\npolymer/single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) OPV donor/acceptor bulk\nheterojunctions. Specifically, we compare polythiophene (PT) and\npoly(3-methylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3MT) as donors and C$_{60}$ chains with\n(6,4), (6,5), and (10,5) SWNTs as acceptors. We find the conductivity increases\nsubstantially for both the excited triplet relative to the singlet ground state\nand for PT compared with P3MT due to the increased charge transfer and the\nresulting improvement in donor/acceptor level alignment. Similarly, the (6,4)\nSWNT, with a larger SWNT band gap and greater conductivity than fullerenes,\nprovides the highest conductivities of 5 and 9\\% of the theoretical maximum for\nelectron and hole carriers, respectively. This work has important implications\nfor both the optimization of polymer/SWNT bulk heterojunctions and the design\nof new OPV bulk heterojunctions in silico.\n", "  Since its inception about two centuries ago thermodynamics has sparkled\ncontinuous interest and fundamental questions. According to the second law no\nheat engine can have an efficiency larger than Carnot's efficiency. The latter\ncan be achieved by the Carnot engine, which however ideally operates in\ninfinite time, hence delivers null power. A currently open question is whether\nthe Carnot efficiency can be achieved at finite power. Most of the previous\nworks addressed this question within the Onsager matrix formalism of linear\nresponse theory. Here we pursue a different route based on finite-size-scaling\ntheory. We focus on quantum Otto engines and show that when the working\nsubstance is at the verge of a second order phase transition diverging energy\nfluctuations can enable approaching the Carnot point without sacrificing power.\nThe rate of such approach is dictated by the critical indices, thus showing the\nuniversal character of our analysis.\n", "  It is known by now that amorphous solids at zero temperature do not possess a\nnonlinear elasticity theory: besides the shear modulus which exists, all the\nhigher order coefficients do not exist in the thermodynamic limit. Here we show\nthat the same phenomenon persists up to temperatures comparable to the glass\ntransition. The zero temperature mechanism due to the prevalence of dangerous\nplastic modes of the Hessian matrix is replaced by anomalous stress\nfluctuations that lead to the divergence of the variances of the higher order\nelastic coefficients. The conclusion is that in amorphous solids elasticity can\nnever be decoupled from plasticity: the nonlinear response is very\nsubstantially plastic.\n", "  Anomalous microwave emission (AME) is an important Galactic foreground of\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. It is believed that the AME arises\nfrom rotational emission by spinning polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in\nthe interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we assume that a population of\nultrasmall silicate grains may exist in the ISM, and quantify rotational\nemissivity from these tiny particles and its polarization spectrum. We found\nthat spinning silicate nanoparticles can produce strong rotational emission\nwhen those small grains follow a log-normal size distribution. The polarization\nfraction of spinning dust emission from tiny silicates increases with\ndecreasing the dipole moment per atom ($\\beta$) and can reach $P\\sim 20\\%$ for\n$\\beta\\sim 0.1$D at grain temperature of 60 K. We identify a parameter space\n$(\\beta,Y_{Si})$ for silicate nanoparticles in which its rotational emission\ncan adequately reproduce both the observed AME and the polarization of the AME,\nwithout violating the observational constraints by the ultraviolet extinction\nand polarization of starlight. Our results reveal that rotational emission from\nspinning silicate may be an important source of the AME.\n", "  The distribution of Helium in the intracluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy\nclusters is not well constrained due to the very high plasma temperature.\nTherefore, the plasma is often assumed to be homogeneous. A non-uniform Helium\ndistribution can however lead to biases when measuring key cluster parameters.\nThis has motivated one-dimensional models that evolve the ICM composition\nassuming that the effects of magnetic fields can be parameterized or ignored.\nSuch models for non-isothermal clusters show that Helium can sediment in the\ncluster core leading to a peak in concentration offset from the cluster center.\nThe resulting profiles have recently been shown to be linearly unstable when\nthe weakly-collisional character of the magnetized plasma is considered. In\nthis paper, we present a modified version of the MHD code Athena, which makes\nit possible to evolve a weakly-collisional plasma subject to a gravitational\nfield and stratified in both temperature and composition. We thoroughly test\nour implementation and confirm excellent agreement against several analytical\nresults. In order to isolate the effects of composition, in this initial study\nwe focus our attention on isothermal plasmas. We show that plasma\ninstabilities, feeding off gradients in composition, can induce turbulent\nmixing and saturate by re-arranging magnetic field lines and alleviating the\ncomposition gradient. Composition profiles that increase with radius lead to\ninstabilities that saturate by driving the average magnetic field inclination\nto roughly $45^{\\circ}$. We speculate that this effect may alleviate the core\ninsulation observed in homogeneous settings, with potential consequences for\nthe associated cooling flow problem.\n", "  We analyze conditions for the observation of a low energy SU(4) fixed point\nin capacitively coupled quantum dots. One problem, due to dots with different\ncouplings to their baths, has been considered by Tosi, Roura-Bas and Aligia\n(2015). They showed how symmetry can be effectively restored via the adjustment\nof individual gates voltages, but they make the assumption of infinite on-dot\nand inter-dot interaction strengths. A related problem is the difference in the\nmagnitudes between the on-dot and interdot strengths for capacitively coupled\nquantum dots. Here we examine both factors, based on a two site Anderson model,\nusing the numerical renormalization group to calculate the local spectral\ndensities on the dots and the renormalized parameters that specify the low\nenergy fixed point. Our results support the conclusions of Tosi et al. that low\nenergy SU(4) symmetry can be restored, but asymptotically achieved only if the\ninter-dot interaction $U_{12}$ is greater than or of the order of the band\nwidth of the coupled conduction bath $D$, which might be difficult to achieve\nexperimentally. By comparing the SU(4) Kondo results for a total dot occupation\n$n_{\\rm tot}=1$ and $n_{\\rm tot}=2$ we conclude that the temperature dependence\nof the conductance is largely determined by the constraints of the Friedel sum\nrule rather than the SU(4) symmetry and suggest that an initial increase of the\nconductance with temperature is a distinguishing characteristic feature of an\n$n_{\\rm tot}=1$ universal SU(4) fixed point.\n", "  We present post-cryogenic Spitzer imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC) of the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area\n(SHELA) survey. SHELA covers $\\sim$deg$^2$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n\"Stripe 82\" region, and falls within the footprints of the Hobby-Eberly\nTelescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) and the Dark Energy Survey. The\nHETDEX blind R $\\sim$ 800 spectroscopy will produce $\\sim$ 200,000 redshifts\nfrom the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission for galaxies in the range 1.9 < z < 3.5, and\nan additional $\\sim$200,000 redshifts from the [OII] emission for galaxies at z\n< 0.5. When combined with deep ugriz images from the Dark Energy Camera, K-band\nimages from NEWFIRM, and other ancillary data, the IRAC photometry from Spitzer\nwill enable a broad range of scientific studies of the relationship between\nstructure formation, galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, AGN, and environment over\na co-moving volume of $\\sim$0.5 Gpc$^3$ at 1.9 < z < 3.5. Here, we discuss the\nproperties of the SHELA IRAC dataset, including the data acquisition,\nreduction, validation, and source catalogs. Our tests show the images and\ncatalogs are 80% (50%) complete to limiting magnitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag in\nthe detection image, which is constructed from the weighted sum of the IRAC 3.6\nand 4.5 micron images. The catalogs reach limiting sensitivities of 1.1 $\\mu$Jy\nat both 3.6 and 4.5 micron (1$\\sigma$, for R=2 arcsec circular apertures). As a\ndemonstration of science, we present IRAC number counts, examples of highly\ntemporally variable sources, and galaxy surface density profiles of rich galaxy\nclusters. In the spirit of Spitzer Exploratory programs we provide all images\nand catalogs as part of the publication.\n", "  In this paper, we show the existence of static and rotating universal\nhorizons and black holes in gravitational theories with the broken Lorentz\ninvariance. We pay particular attention on the ultraviolet regime, and show\nthat universal horizons and black holes exist not only in low energy scales but\nalso in the UV scales. This is realized by presenting various static and\nstationary exact solutions of the full theory of the projectable Ho\\v{r}ava\ngravity with an extra U(1) symmetry in (2+1)-dimensions, which, by\nconstruction, is power-counting renormalizable.\n", "  We study the kinetic decoupling of light (lesssim 10 GeV) magnetic dipole\ndark matter (DM). We find that present bounds from collider, direct DM\nsearches, and structure formation allow magnetic dipole DM to remain in thermal\nequilibrium with the early universe plasma until as late as the\nelectron-positron annihilation epoch. This late kinetic decoupling leads to a\nminimal mass for the earliest dark protohalos of thousands of solar masses, in\ncontrast to the conventional weak scale DM scenario where they are of order\n10^{-6} solar masses.\n", "  We investigate the poles of the retarded Green's functions of strongly\ncoupled field theories exhibiting a variety of phase structures from a\ncrossover up to different first order phase transitions. These theories are\nmodeled by a dual gravitational description. The poles of the holographic\nGreen's functions appear at the frequencies of the quasinormal modes of the\ndual black hole background. We focus on quantifying linearized level dynamical\nresponse of the system in the critical region of phase diagram. Generically\nnon-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom are important for the low energy physics in\nthe vicinity of a phase transition. For a model with linear confinement in the\nmeson spectrum we find degeneracy of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes\nclose to the minimal black hole temperature, and we establish a region of\ntemperatures with unstable non-hydrodynamic modes in a branch of black hole\nsolutions.\n", "  We consider the problem of how to determine the force laws in an amorphous\nsystem of interacting particles. Given the positions of the centers of mass of\nthe constituent particles we propose a new algorithm to determine the\ninter-particle force-laws. Having $n$ different types of constituents we\ndetermine the coefficients in the Laurent polynomials for the $n(n+1)/2$\npossibly different force-laws. A visual providing the particle positions in\naddition to a measurement of the pressure is all that is required. The\nalgorithm proposed includes a part that can correct for experimental errors in\nthe positions of the particles. Such a correction of unavoidable measurement\nerrors is expected to benefit many experiments in the field.\n", "  Measurements of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial density field have the\npower to considerably improve our understanding of the physics of inflation.\nIndeed, if we can increase the precision of current measurements by an order of\nmagnitude, a null-detection would rule out many classes of scenarios for\ngenerating primordial fluctuations. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys\nrepresent experiments that hold the promise to realise this goal. Thus, we\nmodel the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe\nthe parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$, which represents the degree of primordial\nlocal-type non Gaussianity. Specifically, we address the problem of modelling\nredshift space distortions (RSD) in the tree-level galaxy bispectrum including\n$f_{\\rm NL}$. We find novel contributions associated with RSD, with the\ncharacteristic large scale amplification induced by local-type non-Gaussianity.\nThese RSD effects must be properly accounted for in order to obtain un-biased\nmeasurements of $f_{\\rm NL}$ from the galaxy bispectrum. We propose an analytic\ntemplate for the monopole which can be used to fit against data on large\nscales, extending models used in the recent measurements. Finally, we perform\nidealised forecasts on $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm NL}}$ -- the accuracy of the\ndetermination of local non-linear parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ -- from measurements\nof the galaxy bispectrum. Our findings suggest that current surveys can in\nprinciple provide $f_{\\rm NL}$ constraints competitive with Planck, and future\nsurveys could improve them further.\n", "  We carry out a joint spatial-kinematical-metallicity analysis of globular\nclusters (GCs) around the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), using a homogeneous,\nhigh-quality spectroscopic dataset. In particular, we remove the contaminating\nyoung clusters that have plagued many previous analyses. We find that the\nclusters can be divided into three major metallicity groups based on their\nradial distributions: (1) an inner metal-rich group ([Fe/H] > -0.4), (2) a\ngroup with intermediate metallicity (with median [Fe/H]=-1), (3) and a\nmetal-poor group, with [Fe/H] < -1.5. The metal-rich group has kinematics and\nspatial properties like the disk of M31, while the two more metal-poor groups\nshow mild prograde rotation overall, with larger dispersions - in contrast to\nprevious claims of stronger rotation. The metal-poor GCs are the least\nconcentrated group; such clusters occur five times less frequently in the\ncentral bulge than do clusters of higher metallicity. Despite some well-known\ndifferences between the M31 and Milky Way GC systems, our revised analysis\npoints to remarkable similarities in their chemodynamical properties, which\ncould help elucidate the different formation stages of galaxies and their GCs.\nIn particular, the M31 results motivate further exploration of a metal-rich GC\nformation mode in situ, within high-redshift, clumpy galactic disks.\n", "  We describe a new kind of self-propelling motion of bacteria based on the\ncooperative action of rotating flagella on the surface of bacteria. Describing\nthe ensemble of rotating flagella in the framework of the hydrodynamics with\nspin the reciprocal theorem of Stokesian hydrodynamics is generalized\naccordingly. The velocity of the self-propulsion is expressed in terms of the\ncharacteristics of the vector field of flagella orientation and it is shown\nthat unusually high velocities of \\textit{Thiovulum majus} bacteria may be\nexplained by the cooperative action of the rotating flagella. The expressions\nobtained enable us to estimate the torque created by the rotary motors of the\nbacterium and show quantitative agreement with the existing experimental data.\n", "  The behavior of a spin undergoing Larmor precession in the presence of\nfluctuating fields is of interest to workers in many fields. The fluctuating\nfields cause frequency shifts and relaxation which are related to their power\nspectrum, which can be determined by taking the Fourier transform of the\nauto-correlation functions of the field fluctuations. Recently we have shown\nhow to calculate these correlation functions for all values of mean free path\n(ballistic to diffusive motion) in finite bounded regions, using the model of\npersistent continuous time random walks (CTRW) for particles subject to\nscattering by fixed (frozen) scattering centers so that the speed of the moving\nparticles is not changed by the collisions. In this work we show how scattering\nwith energy exchange from an ensemble of scatterers in thermal equilibrium can\nbe incorporated into the CTRW. We present results for 1,2 and 3 dimensions. The\nresults agree for all these cases contrary to the previously studied 'frozen'\nmodels. Our results for the velocity autocorrelation function show a long time\ntail $\\left( \\sim t^{-1/2}\\right) $, which we also obtain from conventional\ndiffusion theory, with the same power, independent of dimensionality. Our\nresults are valid for any Markovian scattering kernel as well as any kernel\nbased on a scattering cross section $\\sim1/v.$\n", "  In magnetic trilayer structures, a contribution to the Gilbert damping of\nferromagnetic resonance arises from spin currents pumped from one layer to\nanother. This contribution has been demonstrated for layers with weakly\ncoupled, separated resonances, where magnetization dynamics are excited\npredominantly in one layer and the other layer acts as a spin sink. Here we\nshow that trilayer structures in which magnetizations are excited\nsimultaneously, antisymmetrically, show a spin-pumping effect roughly twice as\nlarge. The antisymmetric (optical) mode of antiferromagnetically coupled\nNi$_{79}$Fe$_{21}$(8nm)/Ru/Ni$_{79}$Fe$_{21}$(8nm) trilayers shows a Gilbert\ndamping constant greater than that of the symmetric (acoustic) mode by an\namount as large as the intrinsic damping of Py ($\\Delta\n\\alpha\\simeq\\textrm{0.006}$). The effect is shown equally in field-normal and\nfield-parallel to film plane geometries over 3-25 GHz. The results confirm a\nprediction of the spin pumping model and have implications for the use of\nsynthetic antiferromagnets (SAF)-structures in GHz devices.\n", "  The rate of tidal circularization is predicted to be faster for relatively\ncool stars with convective outer layers, compared to hotter stars with\nradiative outer layers. Observing this effect is challenging, because it\nrequires large and well-characterized samples including both hot and cool\nstars. Here we seek evidence for the predicted dependence of circularization\nupon stellar type, using a sample of 945 eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler.\nThis sample complements earlier studies of this effect, which employed smaller\nsamples of better-characterized stars. For each Kepler binary we measure\n$e\\cos\\omega$ based on the relative timing of the primary and secondary\neclipses. We examine the distribution of $e\\cos\\omega$ as a function of period\nfor binaries composed of hot stars, cool stars, and mixtures of the two types.\nAt the shortest periods, hot-hot binaries are most likely to be eccentric; for\nperiods shorter than 4 days, significant eccentricities occur frequently for\nhot-hot binaries, but not for hot-cool or cool-cool binaries. This is in\nqualitative agreement with theoretical expectations based on the slower\ndissipation rates of hot stars. However, the interpretation of our results is\ncomplicated by the largely unknown ages and evolutionary states of the stars in\nour sample.\n", "  Standing long-period (with the periods longer than several minutes)\noscillations in large hot (with the temperature higher than 3 MK) coronal loops\nhave been observed as the quasi-periodic modulation of the EUV and microwave\nintensity emission and the Doppler shift of coronal emission lines, and have\nbeen interpreted as standing slow magnetoacoustic (longitudinal) oscillations.\nQuasi-periodic pulsations of shorter periods, detected in thermal and\nnon-thermal emissions in solar flares could be produced by a similar mechanism.\nWe present theoretical modelling of the standing slow magnetoacoustic mode,\nshowing that this mode of oscillation is highly sensitive to peculiarities of\nthe radiative cooling and heating function. We generalised the theoretical\nmodel of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in a hot plasma, including\nthe effects of the radiative losses, and accounting for plasma heating. The\nheating mechanism is not specified and taken empirically to compensate the\ncooling by radiation and thermal-conduction. It is shown that the evolution of\nthe oscillations is described by a generalised Burgers equation. Numerical\nsolution of an initial value problem for the evolutionary equation demonstrates\nthat different dependences of the radiative cooling and plasma heating on the\ntemperature lead to different regimes of the oscillations, including growing,\nquasi-stationary and rapidly decaying. Our findings provide a theoretical\nfoundation for probing the coronal heating function, and may explain the\nobservations of decayless long-period quasi-periodic pulsations in flares. The\nhydrodynamic approach employed in this study should be considered with caution\nin the modelling of non-thermal emission associated with flares, as it misses\npotentially important non-hydrodynamic effects.\n", "  During an intensive Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph\n(COS) UV monitoring campaign of the Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC 5548 performed from\n2014 February to July, the normally highly correlated far-UV continuum and\nbroad emission-line variations decorrelated for ~60 to 70 days, starting ~75\ndays after the first HST/COS observation. Following this anomalous state, the\nflux and variability of the broad emission lines returned to a more normal\nstate. This transient behavior, characterised by significant deficits in flux\nand equivalent width of the strong broad UV emission lines, is the first of its\nkind to be unambiguously identified in an active galactic nucleus reverberation\nmapping campaign. The largest corresponding emission-line flux deficits\noccurred for the high-ionization collisionally excited lines, C IV and Si IV(+O\nIV]), and also He II(+O III]), while the anomaly in Ly-alpha was substantially\nsmaller. This pattern of behavior indicates a depletion in the flux of photons\nwith E_{\\rm ph} > 54 eV, relative to those near 13.6 eV. We suggest two\nplausible mechanisms for the observed behavior: (i) temporary obscuration of\nthe ionizing continuum incident upon BLR clouds by a moving veil of material\nlying between the inner accretion disk and inner BLR, perhaps resulting from an\nepisodic ejection of material from the disk, or (ii) a temporary change in the\nintrinsic ionizing continuum spectral energy distribution resulting in a\ndeficit of ionizing photons with energies > 54 eV, possibly due to a transient\nrestructuring of the Comptonizing atmosphere above the disk. Current evidence\nappears to favor the latter explanation.\n", "  We present a first-principles study of the electronic, magnetic, and\ntransport properties of the topological insulator Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ doped with\nMn atoms in substitutional (Mn$_{\\rm Bi}$) and interstitial van der Waals gap\npositions (Mn$_{\\rm i}$), which act as acceptors and donors, respectively. The\neffect of native Bi$_{\\rm Te}$- and Te$_{\\rm Bi}$-antisite defects and their\ninfluence on calculated electronic transport properties is also investigated.\nWe have studied four models representing typical cases, namely (i)\nBi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ with and without native defects, (ii) Mn$_{\\rm Bi}$ defects\nwith and without native defects, (iii) the same but for Mn$_{\\rm i}$ defects,\nand (iv) the combined presence of Mn$_{\\rm Bi}$ and Mn$_{\\rm i}$. It was found\nthat lattice relaxations around Mn$_{\\rm Bi}$ defects play an important role\nfor both magnetic and transport properties. The resistivity is strongly\ninfluenced by the amount of carriers, their type, and by the relative positions\nof the Mn-impurity energy levels and the Fermi energy. Our results indicate\nstrategies to tune bulk resistivities, and also help to uncover the location of\nMn atoms in measured samples. Calculations indicate that at least two of the\nconsidered defects have to be present simultaneously in order to explain the\nexperimental observations, and the role of interstitials may be more important\nthan expected.\n", "  X-ray variability is very common in active galactic nuclei (AGN), but these\nvariations may not occur similarly in different families of AGN. We aim to\ndisentangle the structure of low ionization nuclear emission line regions\n(LINERs) compared to Seyfert 2s by the study of their spectral properties and\nX-ray variations. We assembled the X-ray spectral parameters and variability\npatterns, which were obtained from simultaneous spectral fittings. Major\ndifferences are observed in the X-ray luminosities, and the Eddington ratios,\nwhich are higher in Seyfert 2s. Short-term X-ray variations were not detected,\nwhile long-term changes are common in LINERs and Seyfert 2s. Compton-thick\nsources generally do not show variations, most probably because the AGN is not\naccesible in the 0.5--10 keV energy band. The changes are mostly related with\nvariations in the nuclear continuum, but other patterns of variability show\nthat variations in the absorbers and at soft energies can be present in a few\ncases. We conclude that the X-ray variations may occur similarly in LINERs and\nSeyfert 2s, i.e., they are related to the nuclear continuum, although they\nmight have different accretion mechanisms. Variations at UV frequencies are\ndetected in LINER nuclei but not in Seyfert 2s. This is suggestive of at least\nsome LINERs having an unobstructed view of the inner disc where the UV emission\nmight take place, being UV variations common in them. This result might be\ncompatible with the disappeareance of the torus and/or the broad line region in\nat least some LINERs.\n", "  The most massive baryonic component of galaxy clusters is the \"intracluster\nmedium\" (ICM), a diffuse, hot, weakly magnetized plasma that is most easily\nobserved in the X-ray band. Despite being observed for decades, the macroscopic\ntransport properties of the ICM are still not well-constrained. A path to\ndetermine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of \"cold\nfronts\". These were observed as sharp discontinuities in surface brightness and\ntemperature in the ICM, with the property that the brighter (and denser) side\nof the discontinuity is the colder one. The high spatial resolution of the\nChandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,\nthey should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they\nappear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface\nbetween the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the\nparticles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction. From the\ntime of their discovery, it was realized that these special characteristics of\ncold fronts may be used to probe the physical properties of the cluster plasma.\nIn this review, we will discuss the recent simulations of cold front formation\nand evolution in galaxy clusters, with a focus on those which have attempted to\nuse these features to constrain the physics of the ICM. In particular, we will\nfocus on the effects of magnetic fields, viscosity, and thermal conductivity on\nthe stability properties and long-term evolution of cold fronts. We conclude\nwith a discussion on what important questions remain unanswered, and the future\nrole of simulations and the next generation of X-ray observatories.\n", "  We present measurements of the dynamical response of thermal noise to an ac\nexcitation in conductors at low temperature. From the frequency dependence of\nthis response function - the noise thermal impedance - in the range 1 kHz-1 GHz\nwe obtain direct determinations of the inelastic relaxation times relevant in\nmetallic wires at low temperature: the electron-phonon scattering time and the\ndiffusion time of electrons along the wires. Combining these results with that\nof resistivity provides a measurement of heat capacity of samples made of thin\nfilm. The simplicity and reliability of this technique makes it very promising\nfor future applications in other systems.\n", "  Solar dynamics and turbulence occur at all heights of the solar atmosphere\nand could be described as stochastic processes. We propose that finite lifetime\ntransients recurring at a certain place could trigger quasi-periodic processes\nin the associated structures. In this study, we developed a mathematical model\nfor finite lifetime and randomly occurring transients, and found that\nquasi-periodic processes, with period longer than the time scale of the\ntransients, are detectable intrinsically in form of trains. We simulate their\npropagation in an empirical solar atmospheric model with chromosphere,\ntransition region and corona. We found that, due to the filtering effect of the\nchromospheric cavity, only the resonance period of the acoustic resonator is\nable to propagate to the upper atmosphere, such a scenario is applicable to\nslow magnetoacoustic waves in sunspots and active regions. If the thermal\nstructure of the atmosphere is less wild and acoustic resonance does not take\neffect, the long period oscillations could propagate to the upper atmosphere.\nSuch case would be more likely to occur at polar plumes.\n", "  To compute the SFR of galaxies from the rest-frame UV it is essential to take\ninto account the obscuration by dust. To do so, one of the most popular methods\nconsists in combining the UV with the emission from the dust itself in the IR.\nYet, different studies have derived different estimators, showing that no such\nhybrid estimator is truly universal. In this paper we aim at understanding and\nquantifying what physical processes drive the variations between different\nhybrid estimators. Doing so, we aim at deriving new universal UV+IR hybrid\nestimators to correct the UV for dust attenuation, taking into account the\nintrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We use the CIGALE code to model the\nspatially-resolved FUV to FIR SED of eight nearby star-forming galaxies drawn\nfrom the KINGFISH sample. This allows us to determine their local physical\nproperties, and in particular their UV attenuation, average SFR, average\nspecific SFR (sSFR), and their stellar mass. We then examine how hybrid\nestimators depend on said properties. We find that hybrid UV+IR estimators\nstrongly depend on the stellar mass surface density (in particular at 70 and\n100 micron) and on the sSFR (in particular at 24 micron and the TIR).\nConsequently, the IR scaling coefficients for UV obscuration can vary by almost\nan order of magnitude. This result contrasts with other groups who found\nrelatively constant coefficients with small deviations. We exploit these\nvariations to construct a new class of hybrid estimators based on observed UV\nto near-IR colours and near-IR luminosity densities per unit area. We find that\nthey can reliably be extended to entire galaxies. The new estimators provide\nbetter estimates of attenuation-corrected UV emission than classical hybrid\nestimators. Naturally taking into account the variable impact of dust heated by\nold stellar populations, they constitute a step towards universal estimators.\n", "  In a survey of 65 galaxies, Gao & Solomon (2004) found a tight linear\nrelation between the infrared luminosity ($L_{\\rm{IR}}$, a proxy for the star\nformation rate) and the HCN(1-0) luminosity ($L_{\\rm{HCN}}$). Wu et al. (2005,\n2010) found that this relation extends from these galaxies to the much less\nluminous Galactic molecular high-mass star-forming clumps ($\\sim$1 pc scales),\nand posited that there exists a characteristic ratio $L_{\\rm{IR}}$\n/$L_{\\rm{HCN}}$ for high-mass star-forming clumps. The Gao-Solomon relation for\ngalaxies could then be explained as a summation of large numbers of high-mass\nstar-forming clumps, resulting in the same $L_{\\rm{IR}}$ /$L_{\\rm{HCN}}$ ratio\nfor galaxies. We test this explanation and other possible origins of the\nGao-Solomon relation using high-density tracers (including HCN(1-0),\nN$_2$H$^+$(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0), HNC(1-0), HC$_3$N(10-9), and C$_2$H(1-0)) for\n$\\sim$300 Galactic clumps from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz\n(MALT90) survey. The MALT90 data show that the Gao-Solomon relation in galaxies\ncannot be satisfactorily explained by the blending of large numbers of\nhigh-mass clumps in the telescope beam. Not only do the clumps have a large\nscatter in the $L_{\\rm{IR}}$/$L_{\\rm{HCN}}$ ratio, but also far too many\nhigh-mass clumps are required to account for the Galactic IR and HCN\nluminosities. We suggest that the scatter in the $L_{\\rm{IR}}$/$L_{\\rm{HCN}}$\nratio converges to the scatter of the Gao-Solomon relation at some size-scale\n$\\gtrsim$1 kpc. We suggest that the Gao-Solomon relation could instead result\nfrom of a universal large-scale star formation efficiency, initial mass\nfunction, core mass function, and clump mass function.\n", "  This letter provides a superfield based approach to constructing a collinear\nslice of $\\mathcal{N}$ = 1 superspace. The strategy is analogous to integrating\nout anti-collinear fermionic degrees-of-freedom as was developed in the context\nof soft-collinear effective theory. The resulting Lagrangian can be understood\nas an integral over collinear superspace, where half the supercoordinates have\nbeen integrated out. The application to $\\mathcal{N}$ = 1 super Yang-Mills is\npresented. Collinear superspace provides the foundation for future explorations\nof supersymmetric soft-collinear effective theory.\n", "  We present new near-infrared spectra, obtained at Gemini Observatory, for two\nY dwarfs: WISE J035000.32-565830.2 (W0350) and WISEP J173835.52+273258.9\n(W1738). A FLAMINGOS-2 R=540 spectrum was obtained for W0350, covering 1.0 <\nlambda um < 1.7, and a cross-dispersed GNIRS R=2800 spectrum was obtained for\nW1738, covering 0.993-1.087 um, 1.191-1.305 um, 1.589-1.631 um, and 1.985-2.175\num, in four orders. We also present revised YJH photometry for W1738, using new\nNIRI Y and J imaging, and a re-analysis of the previously published NIRI H band\nimages. We compare these data, together with previously published data for\nlate-T and Y dwarfs, to cloud-free models of solar metallicity, calculated both\nin chemical equilibrium and with disequilibrium driven by vertical transport.\nWe find that for the Y dwarfs the non-equilibrium models reproduce the\nnear-infrared data better than the equilibrium models. The remaining\ndiscrepancies suggest that fine-tuning the CH_4/CO and NH_3/N_2 balance is\nneeded. Improved trigonometric parallaxes would improve the analysis. Despite\nthe uncertainties and discrepancies, the models reproduce the observed\nnear-infrared spectra well. We find that for the Y0, W1738, T_eff = 425 +/- 25\nK and log g = 4.0 +/- 0.25, and for the Y1, W0350, T_eff = 350 +/- 25 K and log\ng = 4.0 +/- 0.25. W1738 may be metal-rich. Based on evolutionary models, these\ntemperatures and gravities correspond to a mass range for both Y dwarfs of 3-9\nJupiter masses, with W0350 being a cooler, slightly older, version of W1738;\nthe age of W0350 is 0.3-3 Gyr, and the age of W1738 is 0.15-1 Gyr.\n", "  We present gas flow models for the Milky Way based on high-resolution\ngrid-based hydrodynamical simulations. The basic galactic potential we use is\nfrom a N-body model constrained by the density of red clump giants in the\nGalactic bulge. We augment this potential with a nuclear bulge, two pairs of\nspiral arms and additional mass at the bar end to represent the long bar\ncomponent. With this combined model we can reproduce many features in the\nobserved ($l,v$) diagram with a bar pattern speed of $33\\; {\\rm km}\\;{\\rm\ns}^{-1}\\;{\\rm kpc}^{-1}$ and a spiral pattern speed of $23\\; {\\rm km}\\;{\\rm\ns}^{-1}\\;{\\rm kpc}^{-1}$. The shape and kinematics of the nuclear ring, Bania's\nClump 2, the Connecting arm, the Near and Far 3-kpc arms, the Molecular Ring,\nand the spiral arm tangent points in our simulations are comparable to those in\nthe observations. Our results imply that a low pattern speed model for the bar\nin our Milky Way reproduces the observations for a suitable Galactic potential.\nOur best model gives a better match to the ($l,v$) diagram than previous high\npattern speed hydrodynamical simulations.\n", "  We construct the Hamiltonians and symmetry generators of Calogero-oscillator\nand Calogero-Coulomb models on the N-dimensional sphere within the matrix-model\nreduction approach. Our method also produces the integrable\nCalogero-Coulomb-Stark model on the sphere and proves the integrability of the\nspin extensions of all these systems.\n", "  We consider the quantum mechanics of Calogero models in an oscillator or\nCoulomb potential on the N-dimensional sphere. Their Hamiltonians are obtained\nby an appropriate Dunkl deformation of the oscillator/Coulomb system on the\nsphere and its restriction to (Coxeter reflection) symmetric wave functions. By\nthe same method we also find the symmetry generators and compute their\nalgebras.\n", "  We report on the site-resolved observation of characteristic states of the\ntwo-dimensional repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model, using ultracold $^{40}$K atoms\nin an optical lattice. By varying the tunneling, interaction strength, and\nexternal confinement, we realize metallic, Mott-insulating, and band-insulating\nstates. We directly measure the local moment, which quantifies the degree of\non-site magnetization, as a function of temperature and chemical potential.\nEntropies per particle as low as $0.99(6)\\,k_B$ indicate that nearest-neighbor\nantiferromagnetic correlations should be detectable using spin-sensitive\nimaging.\n", "  Observed hard X-ray spectra of intermediate polars are determined mainly by\nthe accretion flow velocity at the white dwarf surface, which is normally close\nto the free-fall velocity. This allows to estimate the white dwarf masses as\nthe white dwarf mass-radius relation M-R and the expected free-fall velocities\nat the surface are well known. This method is widely used, however, derived\nwhite dwarf masses M can be systematically underestimated because the accretion\nflow is stopped at and re-accelerates from the magnetospheric boundary R_m, and\ntherefore, its velocity at the surface will be lower than free-fall.To avoid\nthis problem we computed a two-parameter set of model hard X-ray spectra, which\nallows to constrain a degenerate M - R_m dependence. On the other hand,\nprevious works showed that power spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars and\nintermediate polars exhibit breaks at the frequencies corresponding to the\nKeplerian frequencies at the magnetospheric boundary. Therefore, the break\nfrequency \\nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation\nin the M - R_m plane. The intersection of the two dependences allows,\ntherefore, to determine simultaneously the white dwarf mass and the\nmagnetospheric radius. To verify the method we analyzed the archival Suzaku\nobservation of EX Hya obtaining M /M_sun= 0.73 \\pm 0.06 and R_ m / R = 2.6 \\pm\n0.4 consistent with the values determined by other authors. Subsequently, we\napplied the same method to a recent NuSTAR observation of another intermediate\npolar GK~Per performed during an outburst and found M/M_sun = 0.86 \\pm 0.02 and\nR_ m / R = 2.8 \\pm 0.2. The long duration observations of GK Per in quiescence\nperformed by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL observatories indicate increase of\nmagnetosphere radius R_m at lower accretion rates.\n", "  The Libbrecht--Hall circuit is a well-known, low-noise current driver for\nnarrow-linewidth diode lasers. An important feature of the circuit is a current\nlimit to protect the laser diode. As the current approaches the maximum limit,\nhowever, the noise in the laser current increases dramatically. This paper\ndocuments this behavior and explores simple circuit modifications to alleviate\nthis issue.\n", "  Context. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are a common feature of the power\nspectrums of X-ray binaries. Currently it is not possible to unambiguously\ndifferentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena\nthrough existing observations.\n  Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that\ngenerates flux modulation: a spiral instability rotating in a thin accretion\ndisk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model\nfor low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the\ninclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model.\n  Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which\nfeatures a spiral instability. The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation,\nwhich is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power\nspectra as observed from infinity.\n  Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the\nspiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse\nprofile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a\nconsequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse\nharmonic signature in the power spectrum.\n  Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the\nflux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk. We also include new\nobservables that could potentially differentiate between models, such as the\npulse profile and the harmonic content of the power spectra of high-inclination\nsources that exhibit LFQPOs. These might be important observables to explore\nwith existing and new instruments.\n", "  Massive WR stars are evolved massive stars characterized by strong mass-loss.\nHypothetically, they can form either as single stars or as mass donors in close\nbinaries. About 40% of the known WR stars are confirmed binaries, raising the\nquestion as to the impact of binarity on the WR population. By performing a\nspectral analysis of all multiple WR systems in the SMC, we obtain the full set\nof stellar parameters for each individual component. Mass-luminosity relations\nare tested, and the importance of the binary evolution channel is assessed. The\nspectral analysis is performed with the PoWR model atmosphere code by\nsuperimposing model spectra that correspond to each component. Evolutionary\nchannels are constrained using the BPASS evolution tool. Significant Hydrogen\nmass fractions (0.1 - 0.4) are detected in all WN components. A comparison with\nmass-luminosity relations and evolutionary tracks implies that the majority of\nthe WR stars in our sample are not chemically homogeneous. The WR component in\nthe binary AB 6 is found to be very luminous (Log L ~ 6.3 [Lsun]) given its\norbital mass (~10 Msun), presumably because of observational contamination by a\nthird component. Evolutionary paths derived for our objects suggest that Roche\nlobe overflow had occurred in most systems, affecting their evolution. However,\nthe implied initial masses are large enough for the primaries to have entered\nthe WR phase, regardless of binary interaction. Together with the results for\nthe putatively single SMC WR stars, our study suggests that the binary\nevolution channel does not dominate the formation of WR stars at SMC\nmetallicity.\n", "  The band structure of a type-II Weyl semimetal has pairs of electron and hole\npockets that coexist over a range of energies and touch at a topologically\nprotected conical point. We identify signatures of this Weyl point in the\nmagnetic quantum oscillations of the density of states, observable in\nthermodynamic properties. Tunneling between the electron and hole pockets in a\nmagnetic field is the momentum space counterpart of Klein tunneling at a p-n\njunction in real space. This magnetic breakdown happens at a characteristic\nfield that vanishes when the Fermi level approaches the Weyl point.\nTopologically distinct, connected or disconnected, pairs of type-II Weyl cones\ncan be distinguished by the qualitatively different dependence of the quantum\noscillations on the direction of the magnetic field.\n", "  The nature of dark energy may be probed by the derivative\n$Q=\\left.dq(z)/dz\\right|_0$ at redshift $z=0$ of the deceleration parameter\n$q(z)$. It is probably static if $Q<1$ or dynamic if $Q>2.5$, supporting\n$\\Lambda$CDM or, respectively, $\\Lambda=(1-q)H^2$, where $H$ denotes the Hubble\nparameter. We derive $q=1-\\left(4\\pi a_0/cH\\right)^{2}$, enabling a\ndetermination of $q(z)$ by measurement of Milgrom's parameter $a_0(z)$ in\ngalaxy rotation curves, equivalent to the coefficient $A$ in the Tully-Fisher\nrelation $V^4_c=AM_b$ between rotation velocity $V_c$ and baryonic mass $M_b$.\nWe infer that dark matter should be extremely light with clustering limited to\nthe size of galaxy clusters. The associated transition radius to non-Newtonian\ngravity may conceivably be probed in a free fall Cavendish type experiment in\nspace.\n", "  We consider the possibility of an enlarged QCD color group, SU(3+$N^\\prime$)\nspontaneously broken to SU(3)$_c\\times$SU($N^\\prime$) with extra vector-like\nquarks transforming in the fundamental representation. When the heavy quarks\nare integrated out below the PQ-breaking scale, they generate an axion coupling\nwhich simultaneously solves the strong CP problem for both gauge groups.\nHowever, the axion mass now receives a new nonperturbative contribution from\nthe SU($N^\\prime$) confinement scale, which can be substantially larger than\nthe QCD scale. This can increase the axion mass to be at or above the\nelectroweak scale. This visible axion can then decay into gluons and photons\ngiving rise to observable signals at Run-II of the LHC. In particular, if the\nmass is identified with the 750 GeV diphoton resonance then the new confinement\nscale is $\\sim$ TeV and the PQ-breaking scale is $\\sim$ 10 TeV. This predicts\nvector-like quarks and a PQ scalar resonance in the multi-TeV range, with the\npossibility that dark matter is an SU($N^\\prime$) baryon.\n", "  We study the effect of cavity damping asymmetries on backaction in a\n\"membrane-in-the-middle\" optomechanical system, where a mechanical mode\nmodulates the coupling between two photonic modes. We show that in the\nadiabatic limit, this system generically realizes a dissipative optomechanical\ncoupling, with an effective position-dependent photonic damping rate. The\nresulting quantum noise interference can be used to ground-state cool a\nmechanical resonator in the unresolved sideband regime. We explicitly\ndemonstrate how quantum noise interference controls linear backaction effects,\nand show that this interference persists even outside the adiabatic limit. For\na one-port cavity in the extreme bad-cavity limit, the interference allows one\nto cancel all linear backaction effects. This allows continuous measurements of\nposition-squared, with no stringent constraints on the single-photon\noptomechanical coupling strength. In contrast, such a complete cancellation is\nnot possible in the good cavity limit. This places strict bounds on the\noptomechanical coupling required for quantum non-demolition measurements of\nmechanical energy, even in a one-port device.\n", "  Using data from the ALFALFA Arecibo HI survey of galaxies and the Virgo\ncluster X-ray pressure profiles from XMM-Newton, we investigate the possibility\nthat starless dark HI clumps, also known as \"dark galaxies\", are supported by\nexternal pressure in the surrounding intercluster medium. We find that the\nstarless HI clump masses, velocity dispersions and positions allow these clumps\nto be in pressure equilibrium with the X-ray gas near the virial radius of the\nVirgo cluster. We predict the sizes of these clumps to range from 1-10 kpc, in\nagreement with the range of sizes found for spatially resolved HI starless\nclumps outside of Virgo. Based on the predicted HI surface density of the Virgo\nsources, as well as a sample of other similar resolved ALFALFA HI dark clumps\nwith follow up optical/radio observations, we predict that most of the HI dark\nclumps are on the cusp of forming stars. These HI sources therefore mark the\ntransition between starless HI clouds and dwarf galaxies with stars.\n", "  Surface differential rotation (SDR) plays a key role in dynamo models. SDR\nestimates are therefore essential for constraining theoretical models. We\nmeasure a lower limit to SDR in a sample of solar-like stars belonging to young\nassociations with the aim of investigating how SDR depends on global stellar\nparameters in the age range (4-95 Myr). The rotation period of a solar-like\nstar can be recovered by analyzing the flux modulation caused by dark spots and\nstellar rotation. The SDR and the latitude migration of dark-spots induce a\nmodulation of the detected rotation period. We employ long-term photometry to\nmeasure the amplitude of such a modulation and to compute the quantity\nDeltaOmega_phot =2p/P_min -2pi/P_max that is a lower limit to SDR. We find that\nDeltaOmega_phot increases with the stellar effective temperature and with the\nglobal convective turn-over time-scale tau_c. We find that DeltaOmega_phot is\nproportional to Teff^2.18pm 0.65 in stars recently settled on the ZAMS. This\npower law is less steep than those found by previous authors, but closest to\nrecent theoretical models. We find that DeltaOmega_phot steeply increases\nbetween 4 and 30 Myr and that itis almost constant between 30 and 95 Myr in a 1\nM_sun star. We find also that the relative shear increases with the Rossby\nnumber Ro. Although our results are qualitatively in agreement with\nhydrodynamical mean-field models, our measurements are systematically higher\nthan the values predicted by these models. The discrepancy between\nDeltaOmega_phot measurements and theoretical models is particularly large in\nstars with periods between 0.7 and 2 d. Such a discrepancy, together with the\nanomalous SDR measured by other authors for HD 171488 (rotating in 1.31 d),\nsuggests that the rotation period could influence SDR more than predicted by\nthe models.\n", "  Complex cryptographic protocols are often constructed from simpler\nbuilding-blocks. In order to advance quantum cryptography, it is important to\nstudy practical building-blocks that can be used to develop new protocols. An\nexample is quantum retrieval games (QRGs), which have broad applicability and\nhave already been used to construct quantum money schemes. In this work, we\nintroduce a general construction of quantum retrieval games based on the hidden\nmatching problem and show how they can be implemented in practice using\navailable technology. More precisely, we provide a general method to construct\n(1-out-of-k) QRGs, proving that their cheating probabilities decrease\nexponentially in $k$. In particular, we define new QRGs based on coherent\nstates of light, which can be implemented even in the presence of experimental\nimperfections. Our results constitute a new tool in the arsenal of the\npractical quantum cryptographer.\n", "  Most meteorites are fragments from recent collisions experienced in the\nasteroid belt. In such a hyper-velocity collision, the smaller collision\npartner is destroyed, whereas a crater on the asteroid is formed or it is\nentirely disrupted, too. The present size distribution of the asteroid belt\nsuggests that an asteroid with 100 km radius is encountered $10^{14}$ times\nduring the lifetime of the Solar System by objects larger than 10 cm in radius;\nthe formed craters cover the surface of the asteroid about 100 times. We\npresent a Monte Carlo code that takes into account the statistical bombardment\nof individual infinitesimally small surface elements, the subsequent compaction\nof the underlying material, the formation of a crater and a regolith layer. For\nthe entire asteroid, 10,000 individual surface elements are calculated. We\ncompare the ejected material from the calculated craters with the shock stage\nof meteorites with low petrologic type and find that these most likely stem\nfrom smaller parent bodies that do not possess a significant regolith layer.\nFor larger objects, which accrete a regolith layer, a prediction of the\nthickness depending on the largest visible crater can be made. Additionally, we\ncompare the crater distribution of an object initially 100 km in radius with\nthe shape model of the asteroid (21) Lutetia, assuming it to be initially\nformed spherical with a radius that is equal to its longest present ellipsoid\nlength. Here, we find the shapes of both objects to show resemblance to each\nother.\n", "  Recently the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported evidence of a\ndiphoton excess which may be interpreted as a pseudoscalar boson S with a mass\naround 750 GeV. To explain the diphoton excess, such a boson is coupled to the\nStandard Model gauge fields via SFF-dual operators. In this work, we consider\nthe implications of this state for early universe cosmology; in particular, the\nS field can acquire a large vacuum expectation value due to quantum\nfluctuations during inflation. During reheating, it then relaxes to its\nequilibrium value, during which time the same operators introduced to explain\nthe diphoton excess induce a nonzero chemical potential for baryon and lepton\nnumber. Interactions such as those involving right-handed neutrinos allow the\nsystem to develop a non-zero lepton number, and therefore, this state may also\nbe responsible for the observed cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry.\n", "  We perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity (GRMHD)\nof quasi-circular, equal-mass, binary neutron stars that undergo merger. The\ninitial stars are irrotational, $n=1$ polytropes and are magnetized. We explore\ntwo types of magnetic-field geometries: one where each star is endowed with a\ndipole magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a\npulsar, and the other where the dipole field is initially confined to the\ninterior. In both cases the adopted magnetic fields are initially dynamically\nunimportant. The merger outcome is a hypermassive neutron star that undergoes\ndelayed collapse to a black hole (spin parameter $a/M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 0.74$)\nimmersed in a magnetized accretion disk. About $4000M \\sim 60(M_{\\rm\nNS}/1.625M_\\odot)$ ms following merger, the region above the black hole poles\nbecomes strongly magnetized, and a collimated, mildly relativistic outflow ---\nan incipient jet --- is launched. The lifetime of the accretion disk, which\nlikely equals the lifetime of the jet, is $\\Delta t \\sim 0.1 (M_{\\rm\nNS}/1.625M_\\odot)$ s. In contrast to black hole--neutron star mergers, we find\nthat incipient jets are launched even when the initial magnetic field is\nconfined to the interior of the stars.\n", "  Constraining the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies is\ncrucial to understanding the mechanisms that regulate their evolution. Here, we\ncombine multi-wavelength (ultraviolet, optical, and infrared) measurements of a\nvery large sample of galaxies (~230,000) at z<0.16, with physically motivated\nmodels of galaxy spectral energy distributions to extract constraints on galaxy\nphysical parameters (such as stellar mass and star formation rate) as well as\nindividual SFHs. In particular, we set constraints on the timescales in which\ngalaxies form a certain percentage of their total stellar mass (namely, 10, 50\nand 90%). The large statistics allows us to average such measurements over\ndifferent populations of galaxies (quiescent and star-forming) and in narrow\nranges of stellar mass. As in the downsizing scenario, we confirm that low-mass\ngalaxies have more extended SFHs than high-mass galaxies. We also find that at\nthe same observed stellar mass, galaxies that are now quiescent evolve more\nrapidly than galaxies that are currently still forming stars. This suggests\nthat stellar mass is not the only driver of galaxy evolution, but plays along\nwith other factors such as merger events and other environmental effects.\n", "  We develop a method to measure the amount of compositeness of a resonance,\nmostly made as a bound state of two hadrons, by simultaneously measuring the\nrate of production of the resonance and the mass distribution of the two\nhadrons close to threshold. By using different methods of analysis we conclude\nthat the method allows one to extract the value of 1-Z with about $0.1$ of\nuncertainty. The method is applied to the case of the $\\bar B^0_s \\to J/\\psi\nf_1(1285)$ decay, by looking at the resonance production and the mass\ndistribution of $K \\bar K^*$.\n", "  The quantum transport properties of a graphene kirigami similar to those\nstudied in recent experiments are calculated in the regime of elastic,\nreversible deformations. Our results show that, at low electronic densities,\nthe conductance profile of such structures replicates that of a system of\ncoupled quantum dots, characterized by a sequence of minibands and stop-gaps.\nThe conductance and I-V curves have different characteristics in the distinct\nstages of elastic deformation that characterize the elongation of these\nstructures. Notably, the effective coupling between localized states is\nstrongly reduced in the small elongation stage, whereas in the large elongation\nregime the development of strong, localized pseudomagnetic field barriers can\nreinforce the coupling and reestablish resonant tunneling across the kirigami.\nThis provides an interesting example of interplay between geometry and\npseudomagnetic field-induced confinement. The alternating miniband and\nstop-gaps in the transmission lead to I-V characteristics with negative\ndifferential conductance in well defined energy/doping ranges. These effects\nshould be stable in a realistic scenario that includes edge roughness and\nCoulomb interactions, as these are expected to further promote localization of\nstates at low energies in narrow segments of graphene nanostructures.\n", "  We revisit hydrogen shell burning on white dwarfs (WDs) with higher mass\naccretion rates than the stability limit, \\dot M_stable, above which hydrogen\nburning is stable. Novae occur with mass accretion rates below the limit. For\nan accretion rate > \\dot M_stable, a first hydrogen shell flash occurs followed\nby steady nuclear burning, so the shell burning will not be quenched as long as\nthe WD continuously accretes matter. On the basis of this picture, some\npersistent supersoft X-ray sources can be explained by binary models with high\naccretion rates. In some recent studies, however, the claim has been made that\nno steady hydrogen shell burning exists even for accretion rates > \\dot M_{\\rm\nstable}. We demonstrate that, in such cases, repetitive flashes occurred\nbecause mass accretion was artificially controlled. If we stop mass accretion\nduring the outburst, no new nuclear fuel is supplied, so the shell burning will\neventually stop. If we resume mass accretion after some time, the next outburst\neventually occurs. In this way, we can design the duration of outburst and\ninterpulse time with manipulated mass accretion. We call such a controlled nova\na \"forced nova.\" These forced novae, if they exist, could have much shorter\nrecurrence periods than \"natural novae.\" We have obtained the shortest\nrecurrence periods for forced novae for various WD masses. Based on the\nresults, we revisit WD masses of some recurrent novae including T Pyx.\n", "  Transiting circumbinary planets discovered by Kepler provide unique insight\ninto binary star and planet formation. Several features of this new found\npopulation, for example the apparent pile-up of planets near the innermost\nstable orbit, may distinguish between formation theories. In this work, we\ndetermine how planet-planet scattering shapes planetary systems around binaries\nas compared to single stars. In particular, we look for signatures that arise\ndue to differences in dynamical evolution in binary systems. We carry out a\nparameter study of N-body scattering simulations for four distinct planet\npopulations around both binary and single stars. While binarity has little\ninfluence on the final system multiplicity or orbital distribution, the\npresence of a binary dramatically effects the means by which planets are lost\nfrom the system. Most circumbinary planets are lost due to ejections rather\nthan planet-planet or planet-star collisions. The most massive planet in the\nsystem tends to control the evolution. Systems similar to the only observed\nmulti-planet circumbinary system, Kepler-47, can arise from much more tightly\npacked, unstable systems. Only extreme initial conditions introduce differences\nin the final planet populations. Thus, we suggest that any intrinsic\ndifferences in the populations are imprinted by formation.\n", "  The classical Cepheid $l$ Carinae is an essential calibrator of the Cepheid\nLeavitt Law as a rare long-period Galactic Cepheid. Understanding the\nproperties of this star will also constrain the physics and evolution of\nmassive ($M \\ge 8$ $M_\\odot$) Cepheids. The challenge, however, is precisely\nmeasuring the star's pulsation period and its rate of period change. The former\nis important for calibrating the Leavitt Law and the latter for stellar\nevolution modeling. In this work, we combine previous time-series observations\nspanning more than a century with new observations to remeasure the pulsation\nperiod and compute the rate of period change. We compare our new rate of period\nchange with stellar evolution models to measure the properties of $l$ Car, but\nfind models and observations are, at best, marginally consistent. The results\nimply that $l$ Car does not have significantly enhanced mass-loss rates like\nthat measured for $\\delta$ Cephei. We find that the mass of $l$ Car is about 8\n- 10 $M_\\odot$. We present Hubble Space Telescope COS observations that also\ndiffer from measurements for $\\delta$ Cep, and $\\beta$ Dor. These measurements\nfurther add to the challenge of understanding the physics of Cepheids, but do\nhint at the possible relation between enhanced mass loss and ultraviolet\nemission, perhaps both due to the strength of shocks propagating in the\natmospheres of Cepheids.\n", "  Magnetic clouds (MCs) are the interplanetary counterpart of coronal magnetic\nflux ropes. They can provide valuable information to reveal the flux rope\ncharacteristics at their eruption stage in the corona, which are unable to be\nexplored in situ at present. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey of\nthe average iron charge state (<Q>Fe) distributions inside 96 MCs for solar\ncycle 23 using ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) data. As the <Q>Fe in the\nsolar wind are typically around 9+ to 11+, the Fe charge state is defined as\nhigh when the <Q>Fe is larger than 12+, which implies the existence of a\nconsiderable amount of Fe ions with high charge states (e.g., \\geq 16+). The\nstatistical results show that the <Q>Fe distributions of 92 (~ 96%) MCs can be\nclassified into four groups with different characteristics. In group A (11\nMCs), the <Q>Fe shows a bimodal distribution with both peaks higher than 12+.\nGroup B (4 MCs) presents a unimodal distribution of <Q>Fe with its peak higher\nthan 12+. In groups C (29 MCs) and D (48 MCs), the <Q>Fe remains higher and\nlower than 12+ throughout ACE passage through the MC, respectively. Possible\nexplanations to these distributions are discussed.\n", "  We present a determination of the $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi\\to\\pi\\gamma^\\star$\ntransition amplitude from lattice quantum chromodynamics. Matrix elements of\nthe vector current in a finite-volume are extracted from three-point\ncorrelation functions, and from these we determine the infinite-volume\namplitude using a generalization of the Lellouch-L\\\"uscher formalism. We\ndetermine the amplitude for a range of discrete values of the $\\pi\\pi$ energy\nand virtuality of the photon, and observe the expected dynamical enhancement\ndue to the $\\rho$ resonance. Describing the energy dependence of the amplitude,\nwe are able to analytically continue into the complex energy plane and from the\nresidue at the $\\rho$ pole extract the $\\rho\\to \\pi \\gamma^\\star$ transition\nform factor. This calculation, at $m_\\pi\\approx 400$ MeV, is the first to\ndetermine the form factor of an unstable hadron within a first principles\napproach to QCD.\n", "  Most bipolar outflows are associated with individual young stellar objects\nand have small opening angles. Here we report the discovery of an extremely\nwide-angle ($\\sim$180$\\arcdeg$) bipolar outflow (\"EWBO\") in a cluster forming\nregion AFGL 5142 from low-velocity emission of the HCN (3-2) and HCO$^{+}$\n(3-2) lines. This bipolar outflow is along a north-west to south-east direction\nwith a line-of-sight flow velocity of about 3 km~s$^{-1}$ and is spatially\nconnected to the high-velocity jet-like outflows. It seems to be a collection\nof low-velocity material entrained by the high-velocity outflows due to\nmomentum feedback. The total ejected mass and mass loss rate due to both high\nvelocity jet-like outflows and the \"EWBO\" are $\\sim$24.5 M$_{\\sun}$ and\n$\\sim1.7\\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Global collapse of\nthe clump is revealed by the \"blue profile\" in the HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) line. A\nhierarchical network of filaments was identified in NH$_{3}$ (1,1) emission.\nClear velocity gradients of the order of 10 km~s$^{-1}$~pc$^{-1}$ are found\nalong filaments, indicating gas inflow along the filaments. The sum of the\naccretion rate along filaments and mass infall rate along the line of sight is\n$\\sim$3.1$\\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$, which exceeds the total mass\nloss rate, indicating that the central cluster is probably still gaining mass.\nThe central cluster is highly fragmented and 22 condensations are identified in\n1.1 mm continuum emission. The fragmentation process seems to be determined by\nthermal pressure and turbulence. The magnetic field may not play an important\nrole in fragmentation.\n", "  Two-body charmed meson decays $D\\to VP$ are studied within the framework of\nthe diagrammatic approach. Under flavor SU(3) symmetry, all the flavor\namplitude sizes and their associated strong phases are extracted by performing\na $\\chi^2$ fit. Thanks to the recent measurement of $D_s^+\\to\\pi^+\\rho^0$, the\nmagnitudes and the strong phases of the $W$-annihilation amplitudes $A_{P,V}$\nhave been extracted for the first time. As a consequence, the branching\nfractions of all the $D\\to VP$ decays are predicted, especially those modes\nthat could not be predicted previously due to the unknown $A_{P,V}$. Our\nworking assumption, the flavor SU(3) symmetry, is tested by comparing our\npredictions with experiment for the singly and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay\nmodes based on the flavor amplitudes extracted from the Cabibbo-favored decays\nusing the current data. The predictions for the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed\nchannels are in good agreement with the data, while those for the singly\nCabibbo-suppressed decay modes are seen to have flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking\neffects. We find that the inclusion of SU(3) symmetry breaking in color-allowed\nand color-suppressed tree amplitudes is needed in general in order to have a\nbetter agreement with experiment. Nevertheless, the exact flavor\nSU(3)-symmetric approach alone is adequate to provide an overall explanation\nfor the current data.\n", "  We extend an existing Born approximation method for calculating the linear\nsensitivity of helioseismic travel times to flows from Cartesian to spherical\ngeometry. This development is necessary for using the Born approximation for\ninferring large-scale flows in the deep solar interior. In a first sanity\ncheck, we compare two $f-$mode kernels from our spherical method and from an\nexisting Cartesian method. The horizontal and total integrals agree to within\n0.3 %. As a second consistency test, we consider a uniformly rotating Sun and a\ntravel distance of 42 degrees. The analytical travel-time difference agrees\nwith the forward-modelled travel-time difference to within 2 %. In addition, we\nevaluate the impact of different choices of filter functions on the kernels for\na meridional travel distance of 42 degrees. For all filters, the sensitivity is\nfound to be distributed over a large fraction of the convection zone. We show\nthat the kernels depend on the filter function employed in the data analysis\nprocess. If modes of higher harmonic degree ($90\\lesssim l \\lesssim 170$) are\npermitted, a noisy pattern of a spatial scale corresponding to $l\\approx 260$\nappears near the surface. When mainly low-degree modes are used\n($l\\lesssim70$), the sensitivity is concentrated in the deepest regions and it\nvisually resembles a ray-path-like structure. Among the different low-degree\nfilters used, we find the kernel for phase-speed filtered measurements to be\nbest localized in depth.\n", "  We first study the charmless two-body $\\Lambda_b$ decays with the scalar\nmesons as the final states and predict that ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\nf_0(980,1500))=(2.9\\pm 0.7,12.4\\pm 3.8)\\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to p K^{*-}_0(800,1430))=(1.9\\pm 0.5,14.1\\pm 4.5)\\times 10^{-6}$.\nWith the resonant $f_0(980,1500)\\to (\\pi^+\\pi^-,K^+K^-)$ and $K^{*-}_0\\to \\bar\nK^0 \\pi^-$ decays, we then obtain ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\n(\\pi^+\\pi^-,K^+K^-))=(4.2\\pm 1.0,3.5\\pm0.7)\\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to p\\bar K^0 \\pi^-)=(10.4\\pm2.9)\\times 10^{-6}$, in comparison\nwith the data of $(4.6\\pm 1.9,15.9\\pm2.6)\\times 10^{-6}$ and $(12.6\\pm\n4.0)\\times 10^{-6}$ from LHCb, respectively. Our results for $\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\Lambda_b\\to p\\bar K^0 \\pi^-$ would be regarded as the\nfirst evidences of the scalar meson productions in the anti-triplet $b$-baryon\ndecays. The smaller predicted value of ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda K^+K^-)$\nindicates the existences of other resonant contributions to the decay, such as\n$\\Lambda_b\\to K^-(N^{*+}\\to)\\Lambda K^+$.\n", "  High resolution soft X-ray spectroscopy of the prototype accretion disk wind\nquasar, PDS 456, is presented. Here, the XMM-Newton RGS spectra are analyzed\nfrom the large 2013-2014 XMM-Newton campaign, consisting of 5 observations of\napproximately 100 ks in length. During the last observation (hereafter OBS. E),\nthe quasar is at a minimum flux level and broad absorption line profiles are\nrevealed in the soft X-ray band, with typical velocity widths of $\\sigma_{\\rm\nv}\\sim 10,000$ km s$^{-1}$. During a period of higher flux in the 3rd and 4th\nobservations (OBS. C and D, respectively), a very broad absorption trough is\nalso present above 1 keV. From fitting the absorption lines with models of\nphotoionized absorption spectra, the inferred outflow velocities lie in the\nrange $\\sim 0.1-0.2c$. The absorption lines likely originate from He and H-like\nneon and L-shell iron at these energies. Comparison with earlier archival data\nof PDS 456 also reveals similar absorption structure near 1 keV in a 40 ks\nobservation in 2001, and generally the absorption lines appear most apparent\nwhen the spectrum is more absorbed overall. The presence of the soft X-ray\nbroad absorption lines is also independently confirmed from an analysis of the\nXMM-Newton EPIC spectra below 2 keV. We suggest that the soft X-ray absorption\nprofiles could be associated with a lower ionization and possibly clumpy phase\nof the accretion disk wind, where the latter is known to be present in this\nquasar from its well studied iron K absorption profile and where the wind\nvelocity reaches a typical value of 0.3$c$.\n", "  We report on observations of the neutron star (NS) residing in the low-mass\nX-ray binary 1RXS J180408.9-34205 taken 2015 March by $\\emph{NuSTAR}$ and\n$\\emph{XMM-Newton}$ while the source was in the hard spectral state. We find\nmultiple reflection features (Fe K$_{\\alpha}$ detected with $\\emph{NuSTAR}$; N\nVII, O VII, and O VIII detected in the RGS) from different ionization zones.\nThrough joint fits using the self consistent relativistic reflection model {\\sc\nrelxill}, we determine the inner radius to be $\\leq 11.1\\ R_{g}$. For a 1.4\nM$_{\\odot}$ NS with a spin of $a_{*}=0$, this is an inner disk radius of\n$\\leq22.2$ km. We find the inclination of the system to be between\n$18^{\\circ}$-$29^{\\circ}$. If the disk is truncated at a radius greater than\nthe neutron star radius, it could be truncated by a boundary layer on the\nneutron star surface. It is also possible that the disk is truncated at the\nmagnetospheric radius; conservative estimates would then imply $B\\leq(0.3\n-1.0)\\times10^{9}$ G at the magnetic poles, though coherent pulsations have not\nbeen detected and the source is not identified as a pulsar.\n", "  We explore the possibility that GW150914, the binary black hole merger\nrecently detected by Advanced LIGO, was formed by gravitational interactions in\nthe core of a dense star cluster. Using models of globular clusters with\ndetailed $N$-body dynamics and stellar evolution, we show that a typical\ncluster with a mass of $3\\times10^5M_{\\odot}$ to $6\\times10^5M_{\\odot}$ is\noptimal for forming GW150914-like binary black holes that will merge in the\nlocal universe. We identify the most likely dynamical processes for forming\nGW150914 in such a cluster, and we show that the detection of GW150914 is\nconsistent with the masses and merger rates expected for binary black hole\nmergers from globular clusters. Our results show that dynamical processes\nprovide a significant and well-understood pathway for forming binary black hole\nmergers in the local universe. Understanding the contribution of dynamics to\nthe binary black hole merger problem is a critical step in unlocking the full\npotential of gravitational-wave astronomy.\n", "  We estimate the merger rate of double degenerate binaries containing\nextremely low mass (ELM) <0.3 Msun white dwarfs in the Galaxy. Such white\ndwarfs are detectable for timescales of 0.1 Gyr -- 1 Gyr in the ELM Survey; the\nbinaries they reside in have gravitational wave merger times of 0.001 Gyr --\n100 Gyr. To explain the observed distribution requires that most ELM white\ndwarf binary progenitors detach from the common envelope phase with <1 hr\norbital periods. We calculate the local space density of ELM white dwarf\nbinaries and estimate a merger rate of 3e-3/yr over the entire disk of the\nMilky Way; the merger rate in the halo is 10 times smaller. The ELM white dwarf\nbinary merger rate exceeds by a factor of 40 the formation rate of stable mass\ntransfer AM CVn binaries, marginally exceeds the rate of underluminous\nsupernovae, and is identical to the formation rate of R CrB stars. On this\nbasis, we conclude that ELM white dwarf binaries can be the progenitors of all\nobserved AM CVn and possibly underluminous supernovae, however the majority of\nHe+CO white dwarf binaries go through unstable mass transfer and merge, e.g.\ninto single massive ~1 Msun white dwarfs.\n", "  We present a model for the classification of Coronal-Line Forest Active\nGalactic Nuclei (CLiF AGN). CLiF AGN are of special interest due to their\nremarkably large number of emission lines, especially forbidden high ionization\nlines (FHILs). Rose et al. (2015a) suggest that their emission is dominated by\nreflection from the inner wall of the obscuring region rather than direct\nemission from the accretion disk. This makes CLiF AGN laboratories to test\nAGN-torus models. Modeling AGN as an accreting supermassive black hole,\nsurrounded by a cylinder of dust and gas, we show a relationship between\nviewing angle and the revealed area of the inner wall. From the revealed area,\nwe can determine the amount of FHIL emission at various angles. We calculate\nthe strength of [FeVII]{\\lambda}6087 emission for a number of intermediate\nangles (30$^{\\circ}$, 40$^{\\circ}$, and 50$^{\\circ}$) and compare the results\nwith the luminosity of the observed emission line from six known CLiF AGN. We\nfind that there is good agreement between our model and the observational\nresults. The model also enables us to determine the relationship between the\ntype 2 : type 1 AGN fraction vs the ratio of torus height to radius, h/r.\n", "  Optical spectropolarimetry carried out by Kishimoto et al. (2004) has shown\nthat several luminous type 1 quasars show a strong decrease of the polarized\ncontinuum flux in the rest-frame near-UV wavelengths of $\\lambda<4000$\\AA. In\nthe literature, this spectral feature is interpreted as evidence of the\nbroadened hydrogen Balmer absorption edge imprinted in the accretion disk\nthermal emission due to the disk atmospheric opacity effect. On the other hand,\nthe quasar flux variability studies have shown that the variable continuum\ncomponent in UV-optical spectra of quasars, which is considered to be a good\nindicator of the intrinsic spectral shape of the accretion disk emission,\ngenerally have significantly flat spectral shape throughout the near-UV to\noptical spectral range. To examine whether the disk continuum spectral shapes\nrevealed as the polarized flux and as the variable component spectra are\nconsistent with each other, we carry out multi-band photometric monitoring\nobservations for a sample of four polarization-decreasing quasars of Kishimoto\net al. (2004) (4C09.72, 3C323.1, Ton 202, and B2 1208+32) to derive the\nvariable component spectra and compare the spectral shape of them with that of\nthe polarized flux spectra. Contrary to expectation, we confirm that the two\nspectral components of these quasars have totally different spectral shape in\nthat the variable component spectra are significantly bluer compared to the\npolarized flux spectra. This discrepancy in the spectral shape may imply either\n(1) the decrease of polarization degree in the rest-frame UV wavelengths is not\nindicating the Balmer absorption edge feature but is induced by some unknown\n(de)polarization mechanisms, or (2) the UV-optical flux variability is\noccurring preferentially at the hot inner radii of the accretion disk and thus\nthe variable component spectra do not reflect the whole accretion disk\nemission.\n", "  We analyze a roughly 20 yr set of spectroscopic observations for the\nsymbiotic binary EG And. Radial velocities derived from echelle spectra are\nbest-fit with a circular orbit having orbital period P = 483.3 +- 1.6 days and\nsemi-amplitude K = 7.34 +- 0.07 km/sec. Combined with previous data, these\nobservations rule out an elliptical orbit at the 10-sigma level. Equivalent\nwidths of H~I Balmer emission lines and various absorption features vary in\nphase with the orbital period. Relative to the radius of the red giant primary,\nthe apparent size of the H II region is consistent with a model where a hot\nsecondary star with effective temperature of roughly 75,000 K ionizes the wind\nfrom the red giant.\n", "  The intensities of photoelectron satellite lines, corresponding to double\ncore hole (DCH) states of Ar 1s ionization by hard X-rays are calculated using\nthe many-body-perturbation theory. Calculations support the interpretation of\nthe most intense lines as the shake-up excitations 2p 4p. It is demonstrated\nthat the intensities of the spectrum lines corresponding to 4s (and 3d) excited\nstates in DCH field can be explained only taking into account the direct\nknock-up process 2p 3d along with shake-up process 1s 4s that accompanies 2p\nphotoionization.\n", "  We calculate the density shift and broadening of selected dipole transition\nlines of pionic helium in gaseous helium at low temperatures up to T=12 K and\npressure up to a few bar. In the approximation of binary collisions the shift\nand broadening depend linearly on the density; we evaluate the slope of this\nlinear dependence for a few spectral lines of known experimental interest, and\nalso investigate its temperature dependence. We find a blue shift of the\nresonance frequencies of the $(n,l)=(16,15) \\rightarrow (16,14)$, $(17,16)\n\\rightarrow (17,15)$, and $(16,15)\\rightarrow(17,14)$ unfavored transitions,\nand a red shift for the favored one $(17,16) \\rightarrow (16,15)$. The results\nare intended to significantly increase the efficiency of the laser spectroscopy\ninvestigations of pionic helium and help the interpretation of the experimental\ndata.\n", "  Observationally, the quenching of star-forming galaxies appears to depend\nboth on their mass and environment. The exact cause of the environmental\ndependence is still poorly understood, yet semi-analytic models (SAMs) of\ngalaxy formation need to parameterise it to reproduce observations of galaxy\nproperties. In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the\nquenching of disk galaxies through ram-pressure stripping (RPS) as they fall\ninto galaxy clusters with the goal of characterising the importance of this\neffect for the reddening of disk galaxies. Our set-up employs a live model of a\ngalaxy cluster that interacts with infalling disk galaxies on different orbits.\nWe use the moving-mesh code AREPO, augmented with a special refinement strategy\nto yield high resolution around the galaxy on its way through the cluster in a\ncomputationally efficient way. Our direct simulations differ substantially from\nstripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the\nmass loss from RPS. Furthermore, after pericentre passage, as soon as ram\npressure becomes weaker, gas that remains bound to the galaxy is redistributed\nto the outer parts, an effect that is not captured in simplified treatements of\nRPS. Star formation in our model galaxies is quenched mainly because the hot\ngas halo is stripped, depriving the galaxy of its gas supply. The cold gas disk\nis only stripped completely in extreme cases, leading to full quenching and\nsignificant reddening on timescale of ~200 Myr. On the other hand, galaxies\nexperiencing only mild ram pressure actually show an enhanced star formation\nrate that is consistent with observations and are quenched on timescales > 1\nGyr. Stripped gas in the wake is mixed efficiently with intracluster gas\nalready a few tens of kpc behind the disk, and this gas is free of residual\nstar formation.\n", "  Using the nonperturbative renormalization group, we study the existence of\nbound states in the symmetry-broken phase of the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in all\ndimensions between two and four and as a function of the temperature. The\naccurate description of the momentum dependence of the two-point function,\nrequired to get the spectrum of the theory, is provided by means of the\nBlaizot--M\\'endez-Galain--Wschebor approximation scheme. We confirm the\nexistence of a bound state in dimension three, with a mass within 1% of\nprevious Monte-Carlo and numerical diagonalization values.\n", "  We investigate the UV continuum slope $\\alpha$ of a large quasar sample from\nSDSS DR7. By using specific continuum windows, we build two samples at lower\n($0.71<z<1.19$) and higher ($1.90<z<3.15$) redshifts, which correspond to the\ncontinuum slopes at longer (NUV) and shorter (FUV) rest wavelength ranges\nrespectively. Overall, the average continuum slopes are $-0.36$ and $-0.51$ for\n$\\alpha_{\\rm NUV}$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm FUV}$ with similar dispersions\n$\\sigma_{\\alpha} \\sim 0.5$. For both samples, we confirm the luminosity\ndependence of the continuum slope, i.e., fainter quasars have redder spectra.\nWe further find that both $\\alpha_{\\rm NUV}$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm FUV}$ have a\ncommon upper limit ($\\sim 1/3$) which is almost independent of the quasar\nluminosity $L_{\\rm bol}$. This finding implies that the intrinsic quasar\ncontinuum (or the bluest quasar), at any luminosity, obey the standard thin\ndisk model. We propose that the other quasars with redder $\\alpha$ are caused\nby the reddening from the dust {\\it locally}. With this assumption, we employ\nthe dust extinction scenario to model the observed $L_{\\rm bol}-\\alpha$\nrelation. We find that, a typical value of $E(B-V)\\sim0.1$ to $0.3$ mag\n(depending on the types of extinction curve) of the quasar {\\it local} dust is\nenough to explain the discrepancy of $\\alpha$ between the observation\n($\\sim-0.5$) and the standard accretion disk model prediction ($\\sim 1/3$).\n", "  We show that with a system of electrically-gated wide quantum wells embedded\ninside a simple dielectric waveguide structure, it is possible to excite,\ncontrol, and observe waveguided exciton polaritons that carry an electric\ndipole moment. We demonstrate that the energy of the propagating dipolariton\ncan be easily tuned using local electrical gates, that their excitation and\nextraction can be easily done using simple evaporated metal gratings, and that\nthe dipolar interactions between polaritons and between polaritons and excitons\ncan also be controlled by the applied electric fields. This system of gated\nflying dipolaritons thus exhibit the ability to locally control both the single\npolariton properties as well as the interactions between polaritons, which\nshould open up opportunities for constructing complex polaritonic circuits and\nfor studying strongly-interacting, correlated polariton gases.\n", "  We describe the X-ray emission as observed with Suzaku from five symbiotic\nstars that we selected for deep Suzaku observations after their initial\ndetection with ROSAT, ASCA and Swift. We find that the X-ray spectra of all\nfive sources can be adequately fit with absorbed, optically thin thermal plasma\nmodels, with either single- or multi-temperature plasmas. These models are\ncompatible with the X-ray emission originating in the boundary layer between an\naccretion disk and a white dwarf. The high plasma temperatures of kT$~>3$ keV\nfor all five targets were greater than expected for colliding winds. Based on\nthese high temperatures, as well as previous measurements of UV variability and\nUV luminosity, and the large amplitude of X-ray flickering in 4 Dra, we\nconclude that all five sources are accretion-powered through predominantly\noptically thick boundary layers. Our X-ray data allow us to observe a small,\noptically thin portion of the emission from these boundary layers. Given the\ntime between previous observations and these observations, we find that the\nintrinsic X-ray flux and the intervening absorbing column can vary by factors\nof three or more on a time scale of years. However, the location of the\nabsorber and the relationship between changes in accretion rate and absorption\nare still elusive.\n", "  Context. As a star evolves, the planet orbits change with time due to tidal\ninteractions, stellar mass losses, friction and gravitational drag forces, mass\naccretion and evaporation on/by the planet. Stellar rotation modifies the\nstructure of the star and therefore the way these different processes occur.\nChanges of the orbits, at their turn, have an impact on the rotation of the\nstar.\n  Aims. Models accounting in a consistent way for these interactions between\nthe orbital evolution of the planet and the evolution of the rotation of the\nstar are still missing. The present work is a first attempt to fill this gap.\n  Methods. We compute the evolution of stellar models including a comprehensive\ntreatment of rotational effects together with the evolution of planetary\norbits, so that the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the\nplanetary orbit are treated in a self-consistent way. The evolution of the\nrotation of the star accounts for the angular momentum exchange with the planet\nand also follows the effects of the internal transport of angular momentum and\nchemicals.\n  Results. We show that rotating stellar models without tidal interactions can\nwell reproduce the surface rotations of the bulk of the red giants. However,\nmodels without any interactions cannot account for fast rotating red giants in\nthe upper part of the red giant branch, where, such models, whatever the\ninitial rotation considered on the ZAMS, always predict very low velocities.\nFor those stars some interaction with a companion is highly probable and the\npresent rotating stellar models with planets confirm that tidal interaction can\nreproduce their high surface velocities. We show also that the minimum distance\nbetween the planet and the star on the ZAMS that will allow the planet to avoid\nengulfment and survive is decreased around faster rotating stars. [abridged]\n", "  We construct supersymmetric Janus solutions using four-dimensional $N=3$\ngauged supergravity with $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$ gauge group. The $N=3$\nsupersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacuum with unbroken $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$, identified\nwith the compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity on $AdS_4\\times\nN^{010}$, provides a gravity dual of supersymmetric $N=3$ Chern-Simons-Matter\ntheory in three dimensions with $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry. The Janus solutions\naccordingly describe supersymmetric conformal interfaces within this\nChern-Simons-Matter theory via the AdS/CFT holography. We find two classes of\nJanus solutions preserving respectively $(2,1)$ and $(0,1)$ supersymmetry on\nthe $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal defects. The solution with $(2,1)$\nsupersymmetry preserves $SO(2)\\times SO(2)\\times SO(2)\\subset SO(3)\\times\nSU(3)$ symmetry while the $(0,1)$ supersymmetric solution is invariant under a\nlarger $SO(2)\\times SU(2)\\times SO(2)$ symmetry.\n", "  We present measurements of the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass function in\na 3.71 deg$^2$ (0.3 Mpc$^2$) area in the core of the Virgo cluster, based on\n$ugriz$ data from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). The galaxy\nsample consists of 352 objects brighter than $M_g=-9.13$ mag, the 50%\ncompleteness limit of the survey. Using a Bayesian analysis, we find a best-fit\nfaint end slope of $\\alpha=-1.33 \\pm 0.02$ for the g-band luminosity function;\nconsistent results are found for the stellar mass function as well as the\nluminosity function in the other four NGVS bandpasses. We discuss the\nimplications for the faint-end slope of adding 92 ultra compact dwarfs galaxies\n(UCDs) -- previously compiled by the NGVS in this region -- to the galaxy\nsample, assuming that UCDs are the stripped remnants of nucleated dwarf\ngalaxies. Under this assumption, the slope of the luminosity function (down to\nthe UCD faint magnitude limit, $M_g = -9.6$ mag) increases dramatically, up to\n$\\alpha = -1.60 \\pm 0.06$ when correcting for the expected number of disrupted\nnon-nucleated galaxies. We also calculate the total number of UCDs and globular\nclusters that may have been deposited in the core of Virgo due to the\ndisruption of satellites, both nucleated and non-nucleated. We estimate that\n~150 objects with $M_g\\lesssim-9.6$ mag and that are currently classified as\nglobular clusters, might, in fact, be the nuclei of disrupted galaxies. We\nfurther estimate that as many as 40% of the (mostly blue) globular clusters in\nthe core of Virgo might once have belonged to such satellites; these same\ndisrupted satellites might have contributed ~40% of the total luminosity in\ngalaxies observed in the core region today. Finally, we use an updated Local\nGroup galaxy catalog to provide a new measurement of the luminosity function of\nLocal Group satellites, $\\alpha=-1.21\\pm0.05$.\n", "  We investigate the effects of ram pressure on the ordered magnetic field of a\ngalaxy hosting a radio halo and strong nuclear outflows. New radio images in\ntotal and polarized intensity of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC\\,4388 were\nobtained within the CHANG-ES EVLA project. The unprecedented noise level\nreached allows us to detect striking new features of the ordered magnetic\nfield. The nuclear outflow extends far into the halo to about 5\\,kpc from the\ncenter and is spatially correlated with the $\\rm{H}\\alpha$ and X-ray emission.\nFor the first time, the southern outflow is detected. Above and below both\nspiral arms we find extended blobs of polarized emission with an ordered field\noriented perpendicular to the disk. The synchrotron lifetime of the cosmic ray\nelectrons (CREs) in these regions yields a mean outflow velocity of\n$(270\\pm70)\\kms$, in agreement with a galactic wind scenario. The observed\nsymmetry of the polarized halo features in NGC 4388 excludes a compression of\nthe halo gas by the ram pressure of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The\nassumption of equilibrium between the halo pressure and the ICM ram pressure\nyields an estimate of the ICM density that is consistent with both the ICM\ndensity derived from X-ray observations and the recent \\textit{Planck}\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements. The detection of a faint radio halo around\ncluster galaxies could thus be used for an estimate of ICM ram pressure.\n", "  We have performed a specific observational test to measure the effect that\nthe zodiacal light can have on measurements of the spatial fluctuations of the\nnear-IR background. Previous estimates of possible fluctuations caused by\nzodiacal light have often been extrapolated from observations of the thermal\nemission at longer wavelengths and low angular resolution, or from IRAC\nobservations of high latitude fields where zodiacal light is faint and not\nstrongly varying with time. The new observations analyzed here target the\nCOSMOS field, at low ecliptic latitude where the zodiacal light intensity\nvaries by factors of $\\sim2$ over the range of solar elongations at which the\nfield can be observed. We find that the white noise component of the spatial\npower spectrum of the background is correlated with the modeled zodiacal light\nintensity. Roughly half of the measured white noise is correlated with the\nzodiacal light, but a more detailed interpretation of the white noise is\nhampered by systematic uncertainties that are evident in the zodiacal light\nmodel. At large angular scales ($\\gtrsim100\"$) where excess power above the\nwhite noise is observed, we find no correlation of the power with the modeled\nintensity of the zodiacal light. This test clearly indicates that the large\nscale power in the infrared background is not being caused by the zodiacal\nlight.\n", "  In order to match observed properties of the solar cycle, flux-transport\ndynamo models require the toroidal magnetic flux to be stored in a region of\nlow magnetic diffusivity, typically located at or below the bottom of the\nconvection zone.\n  We infer the turbulent magnetic diffusivity affecting the toroidal field on\nthe basis of empirical data.\n  We consider the time evolution of mean latitude and width of the activity\nbelts of solar cycles 12--23 and their dependence on cycle strength. We\ninterpret the decline phase of the cycles as a diffusion process.\n  The activity level of a given cycle begins to decline when the centers of its\nequatorward propagating activity belts come within their width (at half\nmaximum) from the equator. This happens earlier for stronger cycles because\ntheir activity belts are wider. From that moment on, the activity and the belt\nwidth decrease in the same manner for all cycles, independent of their maximum\nactivity level. In terms of diffusive cancellation of opposite-polarity\ntoroidal flux across the equator, we infer the turbulent diffusivity\nexperienced by the toroidal field, wherever it is located, to be in the range\n150--450~km$^2$s$^{-1}$. Strong diffusive latitudinal spreading of the toroidal\nflux underneath the activity belts can be inhibited by an inflow towards the\ntoroidal field bands in the convection zone with a magnitude of several meters\nper second.\n  The inferred value of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity affecting the\ntoroidal field agrees, to order of magnitude, with estimates based on\nmixing-length models for the solar convection zone. This is at variance with\nthe requirement of flux-transport dynamo models. The inflows required to keep\nthe toroidal field bands together before they approach the equator are similar\nto the inflows towards the activity belts observed with local helioseismology.\n", "  The $f_1(1285)$ meson with mass $1281.0 \\pm 0.8$ MeV/$c^2$ and width $18.4\n\\pm 1.4$ MeV (FWHM) was measured for the first time in photoproduction from a\nproton target using CLAS at Jefferson Lab. Differential cross sections were\nobtained via the $\\eta\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, $K^+\\bar{K}^0\\pi^-$, and $K^-K^0\\pi^+$\ndecay channels from threshold up to a center-of-mass energy of 2.8 GeV. The\nmass, width, and an amplitude analysis of the $\\eta\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ final-state\nDalitz distribution are consistent with the axial-vector $J^P=1^+$ $f_1(1285)$\nidentity, rather than the pseudoscalar $0^-$ $\\eta(1295)$. The production\nmechanism is more consistent with $s$-channel decay of a high-mass $N^*$ state,\nand not with $t$-channel meson exchange. Decays to $\\eta\\pi\\pi$ go dominantly\nvia the intermediate $a_0^\\pm(980)\\pi^\\mp$ states, with the branching ratio\n$\\Gamma(a_0\\pi \\text{ (no} \\bar{K} K\\text{)}) / \\Gamma(\\eta\\pi\\pi \\text{(all)})\n= 0.74\\pm0.09$. The branching ratios $\\Gamma(K \\bar{K} \\pi)/\\Gamma(\\eta\\pi\\pi)\n= 0.216\\pm0.033$ and $\\Gamma(\\gamma\\rho^0)/\\Gamma(\\eta\\pi\\pi) = 0.047\\pm0.018$\nwere also obtained. The first is in agreement with previous data for the\n$f_1(1285)$, while the latter is lower than the world average.\n", "  Obscuring circumnuclear dust is a well-established constituent of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). Traditionally referred to as the receding dusty torus,\nits inner radius and angular extension should depend on the photo-ionizing\nluminosity of the central source. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we simulate the\nradiative transfer between the multiple components of an AGN adopting model\nconstraints from the bright Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We compare our model\nresults to the observed near-IR to UV polarization of the source and predict\nits X-ray polarization. We find that the 2-8 keV polarization fraction of a\nstandard AGN model varies from less then a few percent along polar viewing\nangles up to tens of percent at equatorial inclinations. At viewing angles\naround the type-1/type-2 transition the X-ray polarization variability differs\nbetween a static or a receding torus scenario. In the former case, the expected\n2-8 keV polarization of NGC 4151 is found to be 1.21% +/- 0.34% with a constant\npolarization position angle, while in the later scenario it varies from 0.1% to\n6% depending on the photon index of the primary radiation. Additionally, an\northogonal rotation of the polarization position angle with photon energy\nappears for very soft primary spectra. Future X-ray polarimetry missions will\nbe able to test if the receding model is valid for Seyfert galaxies seen at a\nviewing angle close to the torus horizon. The overall stability of the\npolarization position angle for photon indexes softer than {\\Gamma} = 1.5\nensures that reliable measurements of X-ray polarization are possible. We\nderive a long-term observational strategy for NGC 4151 assuming observations\nwith a small to medium-size X-ray polarimetry satellite.\n", "  Context: When crossing the Hertzsprung gap, intermediate-mass stars develop a\nconvective envelope. Fast rotators on the main sequence, or Ap star\ndescendants, are expected to become magnetic active subgiants during this\nevolutionary phase. Aims: We compare the surface magnetic fields and activity\nindicators of two active, fast rotating red giants with similar masses and\nspectral class but diferent rotation rates - OU And (Prot=24.2 d) and 31 Com\n(Prot=6.8 d) - to address the question of the origin of their magnetism and\nhigh activity.\n  Methods: Observations were carried out with the Narval spectropolarimeter in\n2008 and 2013.We used the least squares deconvolution technique to extract\nStokes V and I profiles to detect Zeeman signatures of the magnetic field of\nthe stars. We provide Zeeman-Doppler imaging, activity indicator monitoring,\nand a precise estimation of stellar parameters. We use stellar evolutionary\nmodels to infer the evolutionary status and the initial rotation velocity on\nthe main sequence.\n  Results: The detected magnetic field of OU And is a strong one. Its\nlongitudinal component Bl reaches 40 G and presents an about sinusoidal\nvariation with reversal of the polarity. The magnetic topology of OU And is\ndominated by large scale elements and is mainly poloidal with an important\ndipole component, and a significant toroidal component. The detected magnetic\nfield of 31 Com is weaker, with a magnetic map showing a more complex field\ngeometry, and poloidal and toroidal components of equal contributions. The\nevolutionary models show that the progenitors of OU And and 31 Com must have\nbeen rotat\n  Conclusions: OU And appears to be the probable descendant of a magnetic Ap\nstar, and 31 Com the descendant of a relatively fast rotator on the main\nsequence.\n", "  High-resolution addressing of individual ultracold atoms, trapped ions or\nsolid state emitters allows for exquisite control in quantum optics\nexperiments. This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics\nthat project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance.\nWe use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror\ndevice to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and\namplitude control. The system self-corrects for aberrations of up to several\n$\\lambda$ and reduces them to $\\lambda/50$, leading to light patterns with a\nprecision on the $10^{-4}$ level. We demonstrate aberration-compensated beam\nshaping in an optical lattice experiment and perform single-site addressing in\na quantum gas microscope for $^{87}$Rb.\n", "  We study negative thermal expansion (NTE) in model lattices with multiple\natoms per cell and first- and second-nearest neighbor interactions using the\n(anharmonic) Morse potential. By exploring the phase space of neighbor\ndistances and thermal expansion rates of the bonds, we determine the conditions\nunder which NTE emerges. By permitting all bond lengths to expand at different\nrates, we find that NTE is possible without appealing to fully rigid units.\nNearly constant, large-amplitude, isotropic NTE is observed up to the melting\ntemperature in a classical molecular dynamics model of a $\\mathrm{ReO}_3$-like\nstructure when the rigidity of octahedral units is almost completely\neliminated. Only weak NTE, changing over to positive expansion is observed when\nthe corner-linked octahedra are rigid, with flexible second-neighbor bonds\nbetween neighboring octahedra permitting easy rotation. We observe similar\nchanges to thermal expansion behavior for the diamond lattice: NTE when\nsecond-neighbor interactions are weak to positive thermal expansion when\nsecond-neighbor interactions are strong. From these observations, we suggest\nthat the only essential local conditions for NTE are atoms with low\ncoordination numbers along with very low energies for changing bond angles\nrelative to bond-stretching energies.\n", "  This paper reports the analysis of the X-ray spectra of the Galactic diffuse\nX-ray emission (GDXE) in the Suzaku archive. The fluxes of the Fe I K alpha\n(6.4 keV), Fe XXV,He alpha (6.7 keV) and Fe XXVI Ly alpha (6.97 keV) lines are\nseparately determined. From the latitude distributions, we confirm that the\nGDXE is decomposed into the Galactic center (GCXE), the Galactic bulge (GBXE)\nand the Galactic ridge (GRXE) X-ray emissions. The scale heights (SHs) of the\nFe XXV He alpha line of the GCXE, GBXE and GRXE are determined to be ~40, ~310\nand ~140 pc, while those of the Fe I K alpha line are ~30, ~160 and ~70 pc,\nrespectively. The mean equivalent widths (EWs) of the sum of the Fe XXV He\nalpha and Fe XXVI Ly alpha lines are ~750 eV, ~600 eV and ~550 eV, while those\nof the Fe I K alpha line are ~150~eV, ~60~eV and ~100~eV for the GCXE, GBXE and\nGRXE, respectively. The origin of the GBXE, GRXE and GCXE is separately\ndiscussed based on the new results of the SHs and EWs, in comparison with those\nof the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), Active Binaries (ABs) and Coronal Active\nstars (CAs).\n", "  In Ca1-xRExFeAs2 (RE= rare earth), an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase as well\nas a structural transition has been reported, even in the electron-overdoped\nregime. Here we investigated the temperature-dependent in-plane optical\nspectroscopy of overdoped Ca0.77Nd0.23FeAs2. Upon entering the AFM state, we\nfound an abrupt reduction of low-frequency (500-2 000 cm-1) spectral weight in\nthe optical conductivity. In sharp contrast to the parent compounds of 122\nsystem, where spin-density-wave gaps have been clearly observed in the AFM\nstate, a gap signature is absent in Ca0.77Nd0.23FeAs2. This may be a\nconsequence of the poor nesting condition between hole and electron pockets.\nHowever, a spectral weight analysis shows that the reduced spectral weight at\nlow frequency is transferred to the high frequency range (> 4 000 cm-1),\npointing to a localization effect. These observations suggest that the AFM\norder in Ca0.77Nd0.23FeAs2 is most likely to originate from a localized nature\nrather than Fermi surface nesting.\n", "  We present a theoretical investigation of the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) in a 4-level system consisting of\nvee and ladder subsystems. The four levels are coupled using one weak probe\nfield, and two strong control fields. We consider an experimental realization\nusing energy levels of Rb. This necessitates dealing with different conditions\nof wavelength mismatch---near-perfect match where all three wavelengths are\napproximately equal; partial mismatch where the wavelength of one control field\nis less than the other fields; and complete mismatch where all three\nwavelengths are unequal. We present probe absorption profiles with Doppler\naveraging at room temperature to account for experiments in a room temperature\nRb vapor cell. Our analysis shows that EIA resonances can be studied using\nRydberg states excited with diode lasers.\n", "  We study the envelope approximation and its applicability to first-order\nphase transitions in the early universe. We demonstrate that the power laws\nseen in previous studies exist independently of the nucleation rate. We also\ncompare the envelope approximation prediction to results from large-scale phase\ntransition simulations. For phase transitions where the contribution to\ngravitational waves from scalar fields dominates over that from the coupled\nplasma of light particles, the envelope approximation is in agreement, giving a\npower spectrum of the same form and order of magnitude. In all other cases the\nform and amplitude of the gravitational wave power spectrum is markedly\ndifferent and new techniques are required.\n", "  We present deep imaging of the most distant dwarf discovered by the Dark\nEnergy Survey, Eridanus II (Eri II). Our Magellan/Megacam stellar photometry\nreaches $\\sim$$3$ mag deeper than previous work, and allows us to confirm the\npresence of a stellar cluster whose position is consistent with Eri II's\ncenter. This makes Eri II, at $M_V=-7.1$, the least luminous galaxy known to\nhost a (possibly central) cluster. The cluster is partially resolved, and at\n$M_V=-3.5$ it accounts for $\\sim$$4\\%$ of Eri II's luminosity. We derive\nupdated structural parameters for Eri II, which has a half-light radius of\n$\\sim$$280$ pc and is elongated ($\\epsilon$$\\sim$$0.48$), at a measured\ndistance of $D$$\\sim$$370$ kpc. The color-magnitude diagram displays a blue,\nextended horizontal branch, as well as a less populated red horizontal branch.\nA central concentration of stars brighter than the old main sequence turnoff\nhints at a possible intermediate-age ($\\sim$$3$ Gyr) population; alternatively,\nthese sources could be blue straggler stars. A deep Green Bank Telescope\nobservation of Eri II reveals no associated atomic gas.\n", "  We study the effects of curvature in the expansion of the logarithm of the\ndifferential elastic scattering cross section near $t=0$ as\n$d\\sigma(s,t)/dt=d\\sigma(s,0)/dt\\,\\times\\exp(Bt+Ct^2+Dt^3\\cdots)$ in an eikonal\nmodel for $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering, and use the results to discuss the\nextrapolation of measured differential cross sections and the slope parameters\n$B$ to $t=-q^2=0$. We find that the curvature effects represented by the\nparameters $C$ and $D$, while small, lead to significant changes in the forward\nslope parameter relative to that determined in a purely exponential fit, and to\nsmaller but still significant changes in the forward elastic scattering and\ntotal cross sections. Curvature effects should therefore be considered in\nfuture analyses or reanalyses of the elastic scattering data.\n", "  We aim to constrain the temperature and velocity structures, and H2O\nabundances in the winds of a sample of M-type AGB stars. We further aim to\ndetermine the effect of H2O line cooling on the energy balance in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope. We use two radiative-transfer codes to model molecular\nemission lines of CO and H2O towards four M-type AGB stars. We focus on\nspectrally resolved observations of CO and H2O from HIFI. The observations are\ncomplemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and\nH2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity\nstructure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO\nintensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O\nobservations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally,\nthe radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE,\nin principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles\nonly set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower\nacceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by\ndynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the\ntemperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was\nonly possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an\nad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme\ncooling in the inner CSE. H2O line cooling was therefore excluded from the\nmodels. The constraints set on the temperature profile by the CO lines\nnevertheless allowed us to derive H2O abundances. The derived H2O abundances\nconfirm previous estimates and are consistent with chemical models. However,\nthe uncertainties in the derived abundances are relatively large, in particular\nfor p-H2O, and consequently the derived o/p-H2O ratios are not well\nconstrained.\n", "  The design of better heterogeneous catalysts for applications such as fuel\ncells and electrolyzers requires a mechanistic understanding of\nelectrocatalytic reactions and the dependence of their activity on operating\nconditions such as pH. A satisfactory explanation for the unexpected pH\ndependence of electrochemical properties of platinum surfaces has so far\nremained elusive, with previous explanations resorting to complex co-adsorption\nof multiple species and resulting in limited predictive power. This knowledge\ngap suggests that the fundamental properties of these catalysts are not yet\nunderstood, limiting systematic improvement. Here, we analyze the change in\ncharge and free energies upon adsorption using density-functional theory (DFT)\nto establish that water adsorbs on platinum step edges across a wide voltage\nrange, including the double-layer region, with a loss of approximately 0.2\nelectrons upon adsorption. We show how this as-yet unreported change in net\nsurface charge due to this water explains the anomalous pH variations of the\nhydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) and the potentials of zero total\ncharge (PZTC) observed in published experimental data. This partial oxidation\nof water is not limited to platinum metal step edges, and we report the charge\nof the water on metal step edges of commonly used catalytic metals, including\ncopper, silver, iridium, and palladium, illustrating that this partial\noxidation of water broadly influences the reactivity of metal electrodes.\n", "  In this brief note we investigate the conditions under which a Schwarzschild\nde Sitter black hole spacetime is a solution of the mimetic $F(R)$ gravity with\nLagrange multiplier and potential. As we demonstrate, the resulting mimetic\n$F(R)$ gravity is a slight modification of the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case,\nhowever the resulting perturbation equations are not in all cases identical to\nthe ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case. In the latter case, the perturbation\nequations are identical to the ones corresponding to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nanti-de Sitter black hole.\n", "  We revisit the HI size-mass (D$_{\\rm HI}$-M$_{\\rm HI}$) relation of galaxies\nwith a sample of more than 500 nearby galaxies covering over five orders of\nmagnitude in HI mass and more than ten $B$-band magnitudes. The relation is\nremarkably tight with a scatter $\\sigma \\sim$0.06 dex, or 14%. The scatter does\nnot change as a function of galaxy luminosity, HI richness or morphological\ntype. The relation is linked to the fact that dwarf and spiral galaxies have a\nhomogenous radial profile of HI surface density in the outer regions when the\nradius is normalised by D$_{\\rm HI}$. The early-type disk galaxies typically\nhave shallower HI radial profiles, indicating a different gas accretion\nhistory. We argue that the process of atomic-to-molecular gas conversion or\nstar formation cannot explain the tightness of the D$_{\\rm HI}$-M$_{\\rm HI}$\nrelation. This simple relation puts strong constraints on simulation models for\ngalaxy formation.\n", "  Solar pores are active regions with large magnetic field strengths and\napparent simple magnetic configurations. Their properties resemble the ones\nfound for the sunspot umbra although pores do not show penumbra. Therefore,\nsolar pores present themselves as an intriguing phenomenon that is not\ncompletely understood. We examine in this work a solar pore observed with\nHinode/SP using two state of the art techniques. The first one is the spatial\ndeconvolution of the spectropolarimetric data that allows removing the stray\nlight contamination induced by the spatial point spread function of the\ntelescope. The second one is the inversion of the Stokes profiles assuming\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium that let us to infer the atmospheric physical\nparameters. After applying these techniques, we found that the spatial\ndeconvolution method does not introduce artefacts, even at the edges of the\nmagnetic structure, where large horizontal gradients are detected on the\natmospheric parameters. Moreover, we also describe the physical properties of\nthe magnetic structure at different heights finding that, in the inner part of\nthe solar pore, the temperature is lower than outside, the magnetic field\nstrength is larger than 2 kG and unipolar, and the LOS velocity is almost null.\nAt neighbouring pixels, we found low magnetic field strengths of same polarity\nand strong downward motions that only occur at the low photosphere, below the\ncontinuum optical depth $\\log \\tau=-1$. Finally, we studied the spatial\nrelation between different atmospheric parameters at different heights\ncorroborating the physical properties described before.\n", "  We report the discovery of two Li-rich giants, with A(Li) ~ 1.50, in an\nanalysis of a sample of 40 giants of the open cluster Trumpler 20 (with turnoff\nmass ~ 1.8 Msun). The cluster was observed in the context of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. The atmospheric parameters and Li abundances were derived using\nhigh-resolution UVES spectra. The Li abundances were corrected for nonlocal\nthermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE) effects. Only upper limits of the Li\nabundance could be determined for the majority of the sample. Two giants with\ndetected Li turned out to be Li rich: star MG 340 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.54 \\pm\n0.21 dex and star MG 591 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.60 \\pm 0.21 dex. Star MG 340 is\non average ~ 0.30 dex more rich in Li than stars of similar temperature, while\nfor star MG 591 this difference is on average ~ 0.80 dex. Carbon and nitrogen\nabundances indicate that all stars in the sample have completed the first\ndredge-up. The Li abundances in this unique sample of 40 giants in one open\ncluster clearly show that extra mixing is the norm in this mass range. Giants\nwith Li abundances in agreement with the predictions of standard models are the\nexception. To explain the two Li-rich giants, we suggest that all events of\nextra mixing have been inhibited. This includes rotation-induced mixing during\nthe main sequence and the extra mixing at the red giant branch luminosity bump.\nSuch inhibition has been suggested in the literature to occur because of fossil\nmagnetic fields in red giants that are descendants of main-sequence Ap-type\nstars.\n", "  We present the results of a densely sampled spectroscopic survey of the SSA22\nprotocluster at $z\\approx 3.09$. Our sample with Keck/LRIS spectroscopy\nincludes 106 Ly$\\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs) and 40 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at\n$z=3.05-3.12$. These galaxies are contained within the $9'\\times9'$ region in\nwhich the protocluster was discovered, which also hosts the maximum galaxy\noverdensity in the SSA22 region. The redshift histogram of our spectroscopic\nsample reveals two distinct peaks, at $z=3.069$ (blue, 43 galaxies) and\n$z=3.095$ (red, 103 galaxies). Furthermore, objects in the blue and red peaks\nare segregated on the sky, with galaxies in the blue peak concentrating towards\nthe western half of the field. These results suggest that the blue and red\nredshift peaks represent two distinct structures in physical space. Although\nthe double-peaked redshift histogram is traced in the same manner by LBGs and\nLAEs, and brighter and fainter galaxies, we find that nine out of 10 X-ray AGNs\nin SSA22, and all seven spectroscopically-confirmed giant Ly$\\alpha$ \"blobs,\"\nreside in the red peak. We combine our dataset with sparsely sampled\nspectroscopy from the literature over a significantly wider area, finding\npreliminary evidence that the double-peaked structure in redshift space extends\nbeyond the region of our dense spectroscopic sampling. In order to fully\ncharacterize the three-dimensional structure, dynamics, and evolution of\nlarge-scale structure in the SSA22 overdensity, we require the measurement of\nlarge samples of LAE and LBG redshifts over a significantly wider area, as well\nas detailed comparisons with cosmological simulations of massive cluster\nformation.\n", "  We study cold dilute gases made of bosonic atoms, showing that in the\nmean-field one-dimensional regime they support stable out-of-equilibrium\nstates. Starting from the 3D Boltzmann-Vlasov equation with contact\ninteraction, we derive an effective 1D Landau-Vlasov equation under the\ncondition of a strong transverse harmonic confinement. We investigate the\nexistence of out-of-equilibrium states, obtaining stability criteria similar to\nthose of classical plasmas.\n", "  We present metallicity and photometric parallax calibrations for the F and G\ntype dwarfs with photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic data. The sample\nconsists of 168 dwarf stars covering the colour, iron abundance and absolute\nmagnitude intervals $0.30<(B-V)_0<0.68$ mag, $-2.0<[Fe/H]<0.4$ dex and\n$3.4<M_V<6.0$ mag, respectively. The means and standard deviations of the\nmetallicity and absolute magnitude residuals are small, i.e.\n$\\langle\\Delta[Fe/H]_{res}\\rangle=0$ and $\\sigma=0.134$ dex, and $\\langle\\Delta\n(M_V)_{res}\\rangle=0$ and $\\sigma=0.174$ mag, respectively, which indicate\naccurate metallicity and photometric parallax estimations.\n", "  The progenitors of some supernovae (SNe) exhibit outbursts with\nsuper-Eddington luminosities prior to their final explosions. This behavior is\ncommon among Type IIn SNe, but the driving mechanisms of these precursors are\nnot yet well understood. SNHunt 275 was announced as a possible new SN during\nMay 2015. Here we report on pre-explosion observations of the location of this\nevent by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and report the detection of a\nprecursor about 500 days prior to the 2015 May activity (PTF 13efv). The\nobserved velocities in the 2015 transient and its 2013 precursor absorption\nspectra are low (1000-2000 km/s), so it is not clear yet if the recent activity\nindeed marks the final disruption of the progenitor. Regardless of the nature\nof this event, we use the PTF photometric and spectral observations, as well as\nSwift-UVOT observations, to constrain the efficiency of the radiated energy\nrelative to the total kinetic energy of the precursor. We find that, using an\norder-of-magnitude estimate and under the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nratio of the radiated energy to the kinetic energy is in the range of 0.04 to\n3400.\n", "  Babar, Belle and recently LHCb has reported an excess in the measurements of\n$R(D^{*})$, $R(D)$ and $\\mathcal{B}r(B \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau} )$ than\nexpected from SM, a possible signature of lepton flavor universality violating\nNP. In this work we analyze the phenomenological implications for these decay\nmodes in a Flipped/Lepton-Specific 2HDM with anomalously enhanced Yukawa\ncoupling of $H^{\\pm}$ to $\\tau$/b. When experimental and theoretical errors are\nadded in quadrature, we conclude that this phenomenological extension of SM can\ngive results in agreement within 1$\\sigma$ deviation for the combination of\n$R(D^{(*)})$ and $\\mathcal{B}r(B \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu_{\\tau})$ compare to about\n4$\\sigma$ deviation from SM from the latest combined[Babar,Belle,LHCb]\nexperimental data for these observables.\n", "  The effects of many physical processes in the intracluster medium of galaxy\nclusters imprint themselves in X-ray surface brightness images. It is therefore\nimportant to choose optimal methods for extracting information from and\nenhancing the interpretability of such images. We describe in detail a gradient\nfiltering edge detection method that we previously applied to images of the\nCentaurus cluster of galaxies. The Gaussian gradient filter measures the\ngradient in the surface brightness distribution on particular spatial scales.\nWe apply this filter on different scales to Chandra X-ray observatory images of\ntwo clusters with AGN feedback, the Perseus cluster and M87, and a merging\nsystem, A3667. By combining filtered images on different scales using radial\nfilters spectacular images of the edges in a cluster are produced. We describe\nhow to assess the significance of features in filtered images. We find the\ngradient filtering technique to have significant advantages for detecting many\nkinds of features compared to other analysis techniques, such as\nunsharp-masking. Filtering cluster images in this way in a hard energy band\nallows shocks to be detected.\n", "  Compared to cubic metals, whose primary slip mode includes twelve equivalent\nsystems, the lower crystalline symmetry of hexagonal close-packed metals\nresults in a reduced number of equivalent primary slips and anisotropy in\nplasticity, leading to brittleness at the ambient temperature. At higher\ntemperatures, the ductility of hexagonal close-packed metals improves owing to\nthe activation of secondary c+a pyramidal slip systems. Thus understanding the\nfundamental properties of corresponding dislocations is essential for the\nimprovement of ductility at the ambient temperature. Here, we present the\nresults of large-scale ab-initio calculations for c+a pyramidal screw\ndislocations in Mg and show that their slip behavior is a stark counterexample\nto the conventional wisdom that a slip plane is determined by the stacking\nfault plane of dislocations. A stacking fault between dissociated partial\ndislocations can assume a non-planar shape with a negligible energy cost and\ncan migrate normal to its plane by a local shuffling of atoms. Partial\ndislocations dissociated on a {2-1-12} plane \"slither\" in the {01-11} plane,\ndragging the stacking fault with them in response to an applied shear stress.\nThis finding resolves the apparent discrepancy that both {2-1-12} and {01-11}\nslip traces are observed in experiments while ab-initio calculations indicate\nthat dislocations preferably dissociate in the {01-11} planes.\n", "  We here report the properties of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars in 14 locations in\nthe nearby spiral galaxy M81. These locations were found serendipitously while\nanalysing the slit spectra of a sample of ~150 star-forming complexes, taken\nusing the long-slit and Multi-Object spectroscopic modes of the OSIRIS\ninstrument at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Colours and magnitudes of\nthe identified point sources in the Hubble Space Telescope images compare well\nwith those of individual W-R stars in the Milky Way. Using templates of\nindividual W-R stars, we infer that the objects responsible for the observed\nW-R features are single stars in 12 locations, comprising of 3 WNLs, 3 WNEs, 2\nWCEs and 4 transitional WN/C types. In diagrams involving bump luminosities and\nthe width of the bumps, the W-R stars of the same sub-class group together,\nwith the transitional stars occupying locations intermediate between the WNE\nand WCE groups, as expected from the evolutionary models. However, the observed\nnumber of 4 transitional stars out of our sample of 14 is statistically high as\ncompared to the 4% expected in stellar evolutionary models.\n", "  We investigate the shallow increase in globular cluster half-light radii with\nprojected galactocentric distance $R_{gc}$ observed in the giant galaxies M87,\nNGC 1399, and NGC 5128. To model the trend in each galaxy, we explore the\neffects of orbital anisotropy and tidally under-filling clusters. While a\nstrong degeneracy exists between the two parameters, we use kinematic studies\nto help constrain the distance $R_\\beta$ beyond which cluster orbits become\nanisotropic, as well as the distance $R_{f\\alpha}$ beyond which clusters are\ntidally under-filling. For M87 we find $R_\\beta > 27$ kpc and $20 < R_{f\\alpha}\n< 40$ kpc and for NGC 1399 $R_\\beta > 13$ kpc and $10 < R_{f\\alpha} < 30$ kpc.\nThe connection of $R_{f\\alpha}$ with each galaxy's mass profile indicates the\nrelationship between size and $R_{gc}$ may be imposed at formation, with only\ninner clusters being tidally affected. The best fitted models suggest the\ndynamical histories of brightest cluster galaxies yield similar present-day\ndistributions of cluster properties. For NGC 5128, the central giant in a small\ngalaxy group, we find $R_\\beta > 5$ kpc and $R_{f\\alpha} > 30$ kpc. While we\ncannot rule out a dependence on $R_{gc}$, NGC 5128 is well fitted by a tidally\nfilling cluster population with an isotropic distribution of orbits, suggesting\nit may have formed via an initial fast accretion phase. Perturbations from the\nsurrounding environment may also affect a galaxy's orbital anisotropy profile,\nas outer clusters in M87 and NGC 1399 have primarily radial orbits while outer\nNGC 5128 clusters remain isotropic.\n", "  Information on the spectral types of stars is of great interest in view of\nthe exploitation of space-based imaging surveys. In this article, we\ninvestigate the classification of stars into spectral types using only the\nshape of their diffraction pattern in a single broad-band image. We propose a\nsupervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed\nwith image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid\nVIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,\nassuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the\npossibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine\nlearning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in\nwhich the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars\nfrom a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.\nWe use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral\ntype and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral\nsubclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a\nhigh success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a\nspectral class. Although more detailed simulations would be needed to assess\nthe performance of the algorithm on a specific survey, this shows that stellar\nclassification from single-band images is well possible.\n", "  We present results of a photometric study into the cluster population of NGC\n1566, a nearby grand design spiral galaxy, sampled out to a Galactocentric\nradius of $\\approx 5.5$ kpc. The shape of the mass-limited age distribution\nshows negligible variation with radial distance from the centre of the galaxy,\nand demonstrates three separate sections, with a steep beginning, flat middle\nand steep end. The luminosity function can be approximated by a power law at\nlower luminosities with evidence of a truncation at higher luminosity. The\npower law section of the luminosity function of the galaxy is best fitted by an\nindex $\\approx -2$, in agreement with other studies, and is found to agree with\na model luminosity function, which uses an underlying Schechter mass function.\nThe recovered power law slope of the mass distribution shows a slight\nsteepening as a function of galactocentric distance, but this is within error\nestimates. It also displays a possible truncation at the high mass end.\nAdditionally, the cluster formation efficiency ($\\Gamma$) and the specific\nU-band luminosity of clusters ($T_L(U)$) are calculated for NGC 1566 and are\nconsistent with values for similar galaxies. A difference in NGC 1566, however,\nis that the fairly high star formation rate is in contrast with a low\n$\\Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\\Gamma$, indicating that $\\Gamma$ can only be said to\ndepend strongly on $\\Sigma_{SFR}$, not the star formation rate.\n", "  We measure the forward-backward asymmetries $A_{\\rm FB}$ of charged $\\Xi$ and\n$\\Omega$ baryons produced in $p \\bar{p}$ collisions recorded by the D0 detector\nat the Fermilab Tevatron collider at $\\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV as a function of the\nbaryon rapidity $y$. We find that the asymmetries $A_{\\rm FB}$ for charged\n$\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ baryons are consistent with zero within statistical\nuncertainties.\n", "  Nowadays, strict finite size effects must be taken into account in condensed\nmatter problems when treated through models based on lattices or graphs. On the\nother hand, the cases of directed bonds or links are known as highly relevant,\nin topics ranging from ferroelectrics to quotation networks. Combining these\ntwo points leads to examine finite size random matrices. To obtain basic\nmaterials properties, the Green function associated to the matrix has to be\ncalculated. In order to obtain the first finite size correction a perturbative\nscheme is hereby developed within the framework of the replica method. The\naveraged eigenvalue spectrum and the corresponding Green function of Wigner\nrandom sign real symmetric N x N matrices to order 1/N are in fine obtained\nanalytically. Related simulation results are also presented. The comparison\nbetween the analytical formulae and finite size matrices numerical\ndiagonalization results exhibits an excellent agreement, confirming the\ncorrectness of the first order finite size expression.\n", "  We discuss the potential of the gravitational microlensing method as a unique\ntool to detect unambiguous signals caused by intermediate-mass black holes in\nglobular clusters. We select clusters near the line of sight to the Galactic\nBulge and the Small Magellanic Cloud, estimate the density of background stars\nfor each of them, and carry out simulations in order to estimate the\nprobabilities of detecting the astrometric signatures caused by black hole\nlensing. We find that for several clusters, the probability of detecting such\nan event is significant with available archival data from the Hubble Space\nTelescope. Specifically, we find that M 22 is the cluster with the best chances\nof yielding an IMBH detection via astrometric microlensing. If M 22 hosts an\nIMBH of mass $10^5M_\\odot$, then the probability that at least one star will\nyield a detectable signal over an observational baseline of 20 years is $\\sim\n86\\%$, while the probability of a null result is around $14\\%$. For an IMBH of\nmass $10^6M_\\odot$, the detection probability rises to $>99\\%$. Future\nobserving facilities will also extend the available time baseline, improving\nthe chance of detections for the clusters we consider.\n", "  Resonance, defined as the oscillation of a system when the temporal frequency\nof an external stimulus matches a natural frequency of the system, is important\nin both fundamental physics and applied disciplines. However, the spatial\ncharacter of oscillation is not considered in the definition of resonance. In\nthis work, we reveal the creation of spatial resonance when the stimulus\nmatches the space pattern of a normal mode in an oscillating system. The\ncomplete resonance, which we call multidimensional resonance, is a combination\nof both the spatial and the conventionally defined (temporal) resonance and can\nbe several orders of magnitude stronger than the temporal resonance alone. We\nfurther elucidate that the spin wave produced by multidimensional resonance\ndrives considerably faster reversal of the vortex core in a magnetic nanodisk.\nOur findings provide insight into the nature of wave dynamics and open the door\nto novel applications.\n", "  New calculations for rotational excitation of cyanoacetylene by collisions\nwith hydrogen molecules are performed to include the lowest 38 rotational\nlevels of HC3N and kinetic temperatures to 300 K. Calculations are based on the\ninteraction potential of Wernli et al. A&A, 464, 1147 (2007) whose accuracy is\nchecked against spectroscopic measurements of the HC3N-H2 complex. The quantum\ncoupled-channel approach is employed and complemented by quasi-classical\ntrajectory calculations. Rate coefficients for ortho-H2 are provided for the\nfirst time. Hyperfine resolved rate coefficients are also deduced. Collisional\npropensity rules are discussed and comparisons between quantum and classical\nrate coefficients are presented. This collisional data should prove useful in\ninterpreting HC3N observations in the cold and warm ISM, as well as in\nprotoplanetary disks.\n", "  We present the results of a search for amplitude modulation of pulsation mode\nfrequencies in 983 $\\delta$ Sct stars, which have effective temperatures\nbetween 6400 $\\leq T_{\\rm eff} \\leq$ 10 000 K in the Kepler Input Catalogue and\nwere continuously observed by the Kepler Space Telescope for 4 yr. We\ndemonstrate the diversity in pulsational behaviour observed, in particular\nnonlinearity, which is predicted for $\\delta$ Sct stars. We analyse and discuss\nexamples of $\\delta$ Sct stars with constant amplitudes and phases; those that\nexhibit amplitude modulation caused by beating of close-frequency pulsation\nmodes; those that exhibit pure amplitude modulation (with no associated phase\nvariation); those that exhibit phase modulation caused by binarity; and those\nthat exhibit amplitude modulation caused by nonlinearity. Using models and\nexamples of individual stars, we demonstrate that observations of the changes\nin amplitude and phase of pulsation modes can be used to distinguish among the\ndifferent scenarios. We find that 603 $\\delta$ Sct stars (61.3 per cent)\nexhibit at least one pulsation mode that varies significantly in amplitude over\n4 yr. Conversely, many $\\delta$ Sct stars have constant pulsation amplitudes so\nshort-length observations can be used to determine precise frequencies,\namplitudes and phases for the most coherent and periodic $\\delta$ Sct stars. It\nis shown that amplitude modulation is not restricted to a small region on the\nHR diagram, therefore not necessarily dependent on stellar parameters such as\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ or $\\log\\,g$. Our catalogue of 983 $\\delta$ Sct stars will be\nuseful for comparisons to similar stars observed by K2 and TESS, because the\nlength of the 4-yr Kepler data set will not be surpassed for some time.\n", "  The Milky Way presents the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem that there are two\nobserved satellite galaxies with maximum circular velocity larger than 55km/s,\nand others have velocity less than 25km/s, but the cold dark matter model\npredicts there should be more than 10 subhaloes with velocity larger than\n25km/s. Those massive subhaloes with $25km/s<V_{max}<55km/s$ should not have\nfailed to form stars. The TBTF problem severely challenges the CDM model. Most\nefforts are seeking the effects of baryonic feedback, decreasing the mass of\nthe Milky Way, changing the properties of dark matter, so as to assign the\nobserved low-velocity satellites into the massive subhaloes found in\nsimulations. However, the TBTF problem can be avoided if the MW have not\naccreted subhaloes with velocity between $25km/s<V_{max}<55km/s$ although the\nprobability of such a gap is lower as $\\sim 1\\%$ and can not be tested against\nobservations. In this work we study the gap in stellar mass of satellite\ngalaxies using the SDSS group catalogue and a semi-analytical model. We find\nthat there are 1-2\\% of galaxy groups with a large gap in the stellar mass of\ntheir satellites. These 'big gap' groups have accreted less massive subhaloes\nin their formation history and naturally display a gap between their satellite\ngalaxies. If extrapolating our results to the Milky Way is appropriate, we\nconclude that it is very likely that our Milky Way has not accreted enough\nmassive subhaloes to host those low-velocity satellites, and the TBTF problem\nis naturally avoided.\n", "  Quantized spin waves, or magnons, in a magnetic insulator are assumed to\ninteract weakly with the surroundings, and to flow with little dissipation or\ndrag, producing exceptionally long diffusion lengths and relaxation times. In\nanalogy to Coulomb drag in bilayer two dimensional electron gases, in which the\ncontribution of the Coulomb interaction to the electric resistivity is studied\nby measuring the interlayer resistivity (transresistivity), we predict a\nnonlocal drag of magnons in a ferromagnetic bilayer structure based on\nsemiclassical Boltzmann equations. Nonlocal magnon drag depends on magnetic\ndipolar interactions between the layers and manifests in the magnon current\ntransresistivity and the magnon thermal transresistivity, whereby a magnon\ncurrent in one layer induces a chemical potential gradient and/or a temperature\ngradient in the other layer. The largest drag effect occurs when the magnon\ncurrent flows parallel to the magnetization, however for oblique magnon\ncurrents a large transverse current of magnons emerges. We examine the effect\nfor practical parameters, and find that the predicted induced temperature\ngradient is readily observable.\n", "  We discover a robust coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in\nan iron arsenide RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$. The new material crystallizes in an\nintergrowth structure of RbFe$_2$As$_2$ and EuFe$_2$As$_2$, such that the Eu\nsublattice turns out to be primitive instead of being body-centered in\nEuFe$_2$As$_2$. The FeAs layers, featured by asymmetric As coordinations, are\nhole doped due to charge homogenization. Our combined measurements of\nelectrical transport, magnetization and heat capacity unambiguously and\nconsistently indicate bulk superconductivity at 36.5 K in the FeAs layers and\nferromagnetism at 15 K in the Eu sublattice. Interestingly, the Eu-spin\nferromagnetic ordering belongs to a rare third-order transition, according to\nthe Ehrenfest classification of phase transition. We also identify an\nadditional anomaly at $\\sim$ 5 K, which is possibly associated with the\ninterplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.\n", "  The nature of the metallicity gradient inside the solar circle (R_GC < 8 kpc)\nis poorly understood, but studies of Cepheids and a small sample of open\nclusters suggest that it steepens in the inner disk. We investigate the\nmetallicity gradient of the inner disk using a sample of inner disk open\nclusters that is three times larger than has previously been studied in the\nliterature to better characterize the gradient in this part of the disk. We\nused the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) [Fe/H] values and stellar parameters for stars\nin 12 open clusters in the inner disk from GES-UVES data. Cluster mean [Fe/H]\nvalues were determined based on a membership analysis for each cluster. Where\nnecessary, distances and ages to clusters were determined via comparison to\ntheoretical isochrones. The GES open clusters exhibit a radial metallicity\ngradient of -0.10+-0.02 dex/kpc, consistent with the gradient measured by other\nliterature studies of field red giant stars and open clusters in the range R_GC\n~ 6-12 kpc. We also measure a trend of increasing [Fe/H] with increasing\ncluster age, as has also been found in the literature. We find no evidence for\na steepening of the inner disk metallicity gradient inside the solar circle as\nearlier studies indicated. The age-metallicity relation shown by the clusters\nis consistent with that predicted by chemical evolution models that include the\neffects of radial migration, but a more detailed comparison between cluster\nobservations and models would be premature.\n", "  Ly-alpha blobs (LABs) offer insight into the complex interface between\ngalaxies and their circumgalactic medium. Whilst some LABs have been found to\ncontain luminous star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei that could\npotentially power the Ly-alpha emission, others appear not to be associated\nwith obvious luminous galaxy counterparts. It has been speculated that LABs may\nbe powered by cold gas streaming on to a central galaxy, providing an\nopportunity to directly observe the `cold accretion' mode of galaxy growth.\nStar-forming galaxies in LABs could be dust obscured and therefore detectable\nonly at longer wavelengths. We stack deep SCUBA-2 observations of the SSA22\nfield to determine the average 850um flux density of 34 LABs. We measure S_850\n= 0.6 +/- 0.2mJy for all LABs, but stacking the LABs by size indicates that\nonly the largest third (area > 1794 kpc^2) have a mean detection, at 4.5 sigma,\nwith S_850 = 1.4 +/- 0.3mJy. Only two LABs (1 and 18) have individual SCUBA-2 >\n3.5 sigma detections at a depth of 1.1mJy/beam. We consider two possible\nmechanisms for powering the LABs and find that central star formation is likely\nto dominate the emission of Ly-alpha, with cold accretion playing a secondary\nrole.\n", "  In this work we introduce a new semi-implicit second order correction scheme\nto the kinetic Kohn-Sham lattice model. The new approach is validated by\nperforming realistic exchange-correlation energy calculations of atoms and\ndimers of the first two rows of the periodic table finding good agreement with\nthe expected values. Additionally we simulate the ethane molecule where we\nrecover the bond lengths and compare the results with standard methods.\nFinally, we discuss the current applicability of pseudopotentials within the\nlattice kinetic Kohn-Sham approach.\n", "  We study the stress developed during the drying of a colloidal drop of silica\nnanoparticles. In particular, we use the wrinkling instability of a thin\nfloating sheet to measure the net stress applied by the deposit on the\nsubstrate and we focus on the effect of the particle polydispersity. In the\ncase of a bidisperse suspension, we show that a small number of large particles\nsubstantially decreases the expected stress, which we interpret as the\nformation of lower hydrodynamic resistance paths in the porous material. As\ncolloidal suspensions are usually polydisperse, we show for different average\nparticle sizes that the stress is effectively dominated by the larger particles\nof the distribution and not by the average particle size.\n", "  The variational cluster approximation is used to study the ground-state\nproperties and single-particle spectra of the three-component fermionic Hubbard\nmodel defined on the two-dimensional square lattice at half filling. First, we\nshow that either a paired Mott state or color-selective Mott state is realized\nin the paramagnetic system, depending on the anisotropy in the interaction\nstrengths, except around the SU(3) symmetric point, where a paramagnetic\nmetallic state is maintained. Then, by introducing Weiss fields to observe\nspontaneous symmetry breakings, we show that either a color-density-wave state\nor color-selective antiferromagnetic state is realized depending on the\ninteraction anisotropy and that the first-order phase transition between these\ntwo states occurs at the SU(3) point. We moreover show that these staggered\norders originate from the gain in potential energy (or Slater mechanism) near\nthe SU(3) point but originate from the gain in kinetic energy (or Mott\nmechanism) when the interaction anisotropy is strong. The staggered orders near\nthe SU(3) point disappear when the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters are\nintroduced, indicating that these orders are fragile, protected only by the\nFermi surface nesting.\n", "  Neural networks of the brain form one of the most complex systems we know.\nMany qualitative features of the emerging collective phenomena, such as\ncorrelated activity, stability, response to inputs, chaotic and regular\nbehavior, can, however, be understood in simple models that are accessible to a\ntreatment in statistical mechanics, or, more precisely, classical statistical\nfield theory.\n  This tutorial presents the fundamentals behind contemporary developments in\nthe theory of neural networks of rate units that are based on methods from\nstatistical mechanics of classical systems with a large number of interacting\ndegrees of freedom. In particular we will focus on a relevant class of systems\nthat have quenched (time independent) disorder. In neural networks, the main\nsource of disorder arises from random synaptic couplings between neurons. These\nsystems are in many respects similar to spin glasses. The tutorial therefore\nalso explains the methods for these disordered systems as far as they are\napplied in neuroscience.\n  The presentation consists of two parts. In the first part we introduce\nstochastic differential equations in the Martin - Siggia - Rose - De Dominicis\n- Janssen path integral formalism. In the second part we employ this language\nto derive the dynamic mean-field theory for deterministic random networks, the\nbasis of the seminal work by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, Sommers 1988, as well as a\nrecent extension to stochastic dynamics.\n", "  Surface characterizations of an organophosphorus (OP) gas detector based on\nchemically functionalized silicon nanoribbon field-effect transistor (SiNR-FET)\nwere performed by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and ToF-SIMS, and\ncorrelated with changes in the current-voltage characteristics of the devices.\nKPFM measurements on FETs allow (i) to investigate the contact potential\ndifference (CPD) distribution of the polarized device as function of the gate\nvoltage and the exposure to OP traces and, (ii) to analyze the CPD hysteresis\nassociated to the presence of mobile ions on the surface. The CPD measured by\nKPFM on the silicon nanoribbon was corrected due to side capacitance effects in\norder to determine the real quantitative surface potential. Comparison with\nmacroscopic Kelvin probe (KP) experiments on larger surfaces was carried out.\nThese two approaches were quantitatively consistent. An important increase of\nthe CPD values (between + 399 mV and + 302 mV) was observed after the OP sensor\ngrafting, corresponding to a decrease of the work function, and a weaker\nvariation after exposure to OP (between - 14 mV and - 61 mV) was measured.\nMolecular imaging by ToF-SIMS revealed OP presence after SiNR-FET exposure. The\nOP molecules were essentially localized on the Si-NR confirming effectiveness\nand selectivity of the OP sensor. A prototype was exposed to Sarin vapors and\nsucceeded in the detection of low vapor concentrations (40 ppm).\n", "  The Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation, during which collapsed structures\nproduce the first ionising photons and proceed to reionise the intergalactic\nmedium, span a large range in redshift (z~30-6) and time (t_{age} ~\n0.1-1.0~Gyr). Exploration of these epochs using the redshifted 21~cm emission\nline from neutral hydrogen is currently limited to statistical detection and\nestimation metrics (e.g., the power spectrum) due to the weakness of the\nsignal. Brightness temperature fluctuations in the line-of-sight (LOS)\ndimension are probed by observing the emission line at different frequencies,\nand their structure is used as a primary discriminant between the cosmological\nsignal and contaminating foreground extragalactic and Galactic continuum\nemission. Evolution of the signal over the observing bandwidth leads to the\n`line cone effect' whereby the HI structures at the start and end of the\nobserving band are not statistically consistent, yielding a biased estimate of\nthe signal power, and potential reduction in signal detectability. We implement\na wavelet transform to wide bandwidth radio interferometry experiments to probe\nthe local statistical properties of the signal. We show that use of the wavelet\ntransform yields estimates with improved estimation performance, compared with\nthe standard Fourier Transform over a fixed bandwidth. With the suite of\ncurrent and future large bandwidth reionisation experiments, such as with the\n300~MHz instantaneous bandwidth of the Square Kilometre Array, a transform that\nretains local information will be important.\n", "  New charge transfer crystals of $\\pi$-conjugated, aromatic molecules\n(phenanthrene and picene) as donors were obtained by physical vapor transport.\nThe melting behavior, optimization of crystal growth and the crystal structure\nis reported for charge transfer salts with (fluorinated)\ntetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ-F$_x$, x=0, 2, 4), which was used as acceptor\nmaterial. The crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray\ndiffraction. Growth conditions for different vapor pressures in closed ampules\nwere applied and the effect of these starting conditions for crystal size and\nquality is reported. The process of charge transfer was investigated by\ngeometrical analysis of the crystal structure and by infrared spectroscopy on\nsingle crystals. With these three different acceptor strengths and the two sets\nof donor materials, it is possible to investigate the distribution of the\ncharge transfer systematically. This helps to understand the charge transfer\nprocess in this class of materials with $\\pi$-conjugated donor molecules.\n", "  We study properties of the zero energy Andreev bound state in a\nsuperconductor-normal metal-superconductor(SNS) junction consisting of two\nintrinsic degrees of freedom. The superconductors on either sides of the normal\nmetal are assumed to have two sublattices with an $intra$-sublattice pairing\nwith a phase of zero or $\\pi$ between the two sublattices. In addition, we add\na uniform $inter$-sublattice pairing and study its effect on the local density\nof states (LDOS). In particular, we find that as the inter-sublattice pairing\nis turned on, the zero bias peak (ZBP) is unstable (robust) when the phase\ndifference across the sublattices is $\\pi$ (zero). We discuss the relevance of\nour results to the recently proposed odd parity $-\\eta$ pairing ground states\nin Iron based superconductors (FeSCs).\n", "  In this expository note we discuss some arithmetic aspects of the mirror\nsymmetry for plane cubic curves. We also explain how the Picard-Fuchs equation\ncan be used to reveal part of these arithmetic properties. The application of\nPicard-Fuchs equations in studying the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of\nmore general Calabi-Yau varieties and the Weil-Petersson geometry on their\nmoduli spaces will also be discussed.\n", "  The ground and first excited 0+ states of the {156-172}Er isotopes are\nanalyzed in the framework of the generator coordinate method. The shape\nparameter beta is used to generate wave functions with different deformations\nwhich together with the two-quasiparticle states built on them provide a set of\nstates. An angular momentum and particle number projection of the latter spawn\nthe basis states of the generator coordinate method. With this ansatz and using\nthe separable pairing plus quadrupole interaction we obtain a good agreement\nwith the experimental spectra and E2 transition rates up to moderate spin\nvalues. The structure of the wave functions suggests that the first excited 0+\nstates in the soft Er isotopes are dominated by shape fluctuations, while in\nthe well deformed Er isotopes the two-quasiparticle states are more relevant.\nIn between both degrees of freedom are necessary .\n", "  Accidental matter models are scenarios where the beyond-the-standard model\nphysics preserves all the standard model accidental and approximate symmetries\nup to a cutoff scale related with lepton number violation. We study such\nscenarios assuming that the new physics plays an active role in neutrino mass\ngeneration, and show that this unavoidably leads to radiatively induced\nneutrino masses. We systematically classify all possible models and determine\ntheir viability by studying electroweak precision data, big bang\nnucleosynthesis and electroweak perturbativity, finding that the latter places\nthe most stringent constraints on the mass spectra. These results allow the\nidentification of minimal radiative accidental matter models for which\nperturbativity is lost at high scales. We calculate radiative charged-lepton\nflavor violating processes in these setups, and show that $\\mu\\to e \\gamma$ has\na rate well within MEG sensitivity provided the lepton-number violating scale\nis at or below $10^6$ GeV, a value (naturally) assured by the radiative\nsuppression mechanism. Sizeable $\\tau\\to \\mu \\gamma$ branching fractions within\nSuperKEKB sensitivity are possible for lower lepton-number breaking scales. We\nthus point out that these scenarios can be tested not only in direct searches\nbut also in lepton-flavor violating experiments.\n", "  Recent observations of debris discs, believed to be made up of remnant\nplanetesimals, brought a number of surprises. Debris disc presence does not\ncorrelate with the host star's metallicity, and may anti-correlate with the\npresence of gas giant planets. These observations contradict both assumptions\nand predictions of the highly successful Core Accretion model of planet\nformation. Here we explore predictions of the alternative Tidal Downsizing (TD)\nscenario of planet formation. In TD, small planets and planetesimal debris is\nmade only when gas fragments, predecessors of giant planets, are tidally\ndisrupted. We show that these disruptions are rare in discs around high\nmetallicity stars but release more debris per disruption than their low [M/H]\nanalogs. This predicts no simple relation between debris disc presence and host\nstar's [M/H], as observed. A detected gas giant planet implies in TD that its\npredecessor fragment was not disputed, potentially explaining why DDs are less\nlikely to be found around stars with gas giants. Less massive planets should\ncorrelate with DD presence, and sub-Saturn planets ($M_{p} \\sim 50\n\\M_{\\oplus}$) should correlate with DD presence stronger than sub-Neptunes\n($M_{p} \\leq 15 \\M_{\\oplus}$). These predicted planet-DD correlations will be\ndiluted and weakened in observations by planetary systems' long term evolution\nand multi-fragment effects neglected here. Finally, although presently\ndifficult to observe, DDs around M dwarf stars should be more prevalent than\naround Solar type stars.\n", "  We demonstrate Anderson localisation of visible light on a chip and report\nquality factors exceeding highly engineered two-dimensional cavities. Our\nresults reverse the trend, observed so far, of the quality of disorder-induced\nlight confinement being orders of magnitude lower than engineered devices.\nFurthermore, by implementing a sensitive imaging technique, we directly\nvisualise the localised modes, determine their position on the device and\nmeasure their spatial extension. Our findings prove the potential of\ndisorder-induced localised light for scalable, room temperature, optical\ndevices, operating in the visible range of wavelengths.\n", "  Studying the population of faint hard X-ray sources along the plane of the\nGalaxy is challenging because of high-extinction and crowding, which make the\nidentification of individual sources more difficult. IGR J18293-1213 is part of\nthe population of persistent sources which have been discovered by the INTEGRAL\nsatellite. We report on NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of this source,\nperformed on 2015 September 11. We detected three eclipsing intervals in the\nNuSTAR light curve, allowing us to constrain the duration of these eclipses,\n$\\Delta t = 30.8^{+6.3}_{-0.0}$ min, and the orbital period of the system, $T =\n6.92\\pm0.01$ hr. Even though we only report an upper limit on the amplitude of\na putative spin modulation, the orbital period and the hard thermal\nBremsstrahlung spectrum of IGR J18293-1213 provide strong evidence that this\nsource is a magnetic Cataclysmic Variable (CV). Our NuSTAR and Swift/XRT joint\nspectral analysis places strong constraints on the white dwarf mass $M_{\\rm wd}\n= 0.78^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ M$_\\odot$. Assuming that the mass to radius ratio of\nthe companion star $M_* / R_* = 1$ (solar units) and using $T$, $\\Delta t$ and\n$M_{\\rm wd}$, we derived the mass of the companion star $M_* = 0.82\\pm0.01$\nM$_\\odot$, the orbital separation of the binary system $a=2.14\\pm0.04$\nR$_\\odot$, and its orbital inclination compared to the line of sight\n$i=(72.2^{+2.4}_{-0.0})\\pm1.0^\\circ$.\n", "  We report here on the discovery of faint extended wings of H\\alpha\\ observed\nout to an apparent velocity of ~ 7600 km/s in the Orion Nebula (M42) and in\nfive HII regions in the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds. We show that,\nthese wings are caused by Raman scattering of both the O I and Si II resonance\nlines and stellar continuum UV photons with H I followed by radiative decay to\nthe H I n=2 level. The broad wings also seen in H\\beta\\ and in H\\gamma\\ result\nfrom Raman scattering of the UV continuum in the H I n=4 and n=5 levels\nrespectively.The Raman scattering fluorescence is correlated with the intensity\nof the narrow permitted lines of O I and Si II. In the case of Si II, this is\nexplained by radiative pumping of the same 1023.7\\AA\\ resonance line involved\nin the Raman scattering by the Ly\\beta\\ radiation field. The subsequent\nradiative cascade produces enhanced Si II 5978.9, 6347.1$ and 6371.4\\AA\\\npermitted transitions. Finally we show that in O I, radiative pumping of the\n1025.76\\AA\\ resonance line by the Lyman series radiation field is also the\ncause of the enhancement in the permitted lines of this species lying near\nH\\alpha\\ in wavelength, but here the process is a little more complex. We argue\nthat all these processes are active in the zone of the HII region near the\nionisation front\n", "  In this work, we aim to characterise high-mass clumps with infall motions. We\nselected 327 clumps from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90-GHz (MALT90)\nsurvey, and identified 100 infall candidates. Combined with the results of He\net al. (2015), we obtained a sample of 732 high-mass clumps, including 231\nmassive infall candidates and 501 clumps where infall is not detected. Objects\nin our sample were classified as pre-stellar, proto-stellar, HII or\nphoto-dissociation region (PDR). The detection rates of the infall candidates\nin the pre-stellar, proto-stellar, HII and PDR stages are 41.2%, 36.6%, 30.6%\nand 12.7%, respectively. The infall candidates have a higher H$_{2}$ column\ndensity and volume density compared with the clumps where infall is not\ndetected at every stage. For the infall candidates, the median values of the\ninfall rates at the pre-stellar, proto-stellar, HII and PDR stages are\n2.6$\\times$10$^{-3}$, 7.0$\\times$10$^{-3}$, 6.5$\\times$10$^{-3}$ and\n5.5$\\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. These values indicate\nthat infall candidates at later evolutionary stages are still accumulating\nmaterial efficiently. It is interesting to find that both infall candidates and\nclumps where infall is not detected show a clear trend of increasing mass from\nthe pre-stellar to proto-stellar, and to the HII stages. The power indices of\nthe clump mass function (ClMF) are 2.04$\\pm$0.16 and 2.17$\\pm$0.31 for the\ninfall candidates and clumps where infall is not detected, respectively, which\nagree well with the power index of the stellar initial mass function (2.35) and\nthe cold Planck cores (2.0).\n", "  We present both binarity and pulsation of KIC 6220497 from the {\\it Kepler}\nobservations. The light curve synthesis shows that the eclipsing system is a\nsemi-detached Algol with parameters of $q$ = 0.243$\\pm$0.001, $i$ =\n77.3$\\pm$0.3 deg, and $\\Delta T$ = 3,372$\\pm$58 K, in which the detached\nprimary component fills its Roche lobe by $\\sim$87\\%. A multiple frequency\nanalysis of the eclipse-subtracted light residuals reveals 33 frequencies in\nthe range of 0.75$-$20.22 d$^{-1}$ with amplitudes between 0.27 and 4.56 mmag.\nAmong these, four are pulsation frequencies in fundamental ($f_1$, $f_5$) and\n$p$ ($f_2$, $f_7$) modes, and six are orbital frequency ($f_8$, $f_{31}$) and\nits harmonics ($f_6$, $f_{11}$, $f_{20}$, $f_{24}$), which can be attributed to\ntidally excited modes. For the pulsation frequencies, the pulsation constants\nof 0.16$-$0.33 d and the period ratios of $P_{\\rm pul}/P_{\\rm orb}$ =\n0.042$-$0.089 indicate that the primary component is a $\\delta$ Sct pulsating\nstar and, thus, KIC 6220497 is an oscillating eclipsing Algol (oEA) star. The\ndominant pulsation period of 0.1174051$\\pm$0.0000004 d is significantly longer\nthan that expected from empirical relations that link the pulsation period with\nthe orbital period. The surface gravity of $\\log g_1$ = 3.78$\\pm$0.03 is\nclearly smaller than those of the other oEA stars with similar orbital periods.\nThe pulsation period and the surface gravity of the pulsating primary\ndemonstrate that KIC 6220497 would be the more evolved EB, compared with normal\noEA stars.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the hydrodynamic permeance of water through\ngraphene-based membranes, inspired by recent experimental findings on\ngraphene-oxide membranes. We consider the flow across multiple graphene layers\nhaving nanoslits in a staggered alignment, with an inter-layer distance ranging\nfrom sub- nanometer to a few nanometers. We compare results for the\npermeability obtained by means of molecular dynamics simulations to continuum\npredictions obtained by using the lattice Boltzmann calculations and\nhydrodynamic modelization. This highlights that, in spite of extreme\nconfinement, the permeability across the graphene-based membrane is\nquantitatively predicted on the basis of a continuum expression, taking\nproperly into account entrance and slippage effects of the confined water flow.\nOur predictions refute the breakdown of hydrodynamics at small scales in these\nmembrane systems. They constitute a benchmark to which we compare published\nexperimental data.\n", "  We present a high-resolution study of five high-velocity clouds in the\nMagellanic Leading Arm region. This is a follow-up study of our widefield\nParkes survey of the region in order to probe the multiphase structures of the\nclouds and to give an insight to their origin, evolution and distance.\nHigh-resolution data were obtained from the Australia Telescope Compact Array.\nBy combining with single-dish data from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS), we\nare able to probe compact and diffuse emission simultaneously. We identify\nresolved and unresolved clumps. Physical parameters were derived for both\ndiffuse structure and compact clumps. The latter are cold with typical velocity\nlinewidths of 5 km/s. We find a gradient in thermal halo pressure, hydrogen\ndensity and HI column density of HVC as a function of Galactic latitude. This\nis possibly the first observational evidence of varying distance in the Leading\nArm region, with the leading part of the Leading Arm (LA II and III) probably\nbeing closer to the Galactic disc than the trailing end (LA I).\n", "  This paper presents a component-level comparison of the polarized v=1 J =1-0,\nv=2 J=1-0 and v=1 J=2-1 SiO maser emission towards the supergiant star VY CMa\nat milliarcsecond-scale, as observed using the VLBA at $\\lambda=7$mm and\n$\\lambda=3$mm. An earlier paper considered overall maser morphology and\nconstraints on SiO maser excitation and pumping derived from these data. The\ngoal of the current paper is to use the measured polarization properties of\nindividual co-spatial components detected across multiple transitions to\nprovide constraints on several competing theories for the transport of\npolarized maser emission. This approach minimizes the significant effects of\nspatial blending. We present several diagnostic tests designed to distinguish\nkey features of competing theoretical models for maser polarization. The number\nof coincident features is limited by sensitivity however, particularly in the\nv=1 J=2-1 transition at 86 GHz, and deeper observations are needed. Preliminary\nconclusions based on the current data provide some support for: i)\nspin-independent solutions for linear polarization; ii) the influence of\ngeometry on the distribution of fractional linear polarization with intensity;\nand, iii) $\\pi/2$ rotations in linear polarization position angle arising from\ntransitions across the Van Vleck angle ($\\sin^2{\\theta}=2/3$) between the maser\nline-of-sight and magnetic field. There is weaker evidence for several\nenumerated non-Zeeman explanations for circular polarization. The expected 2:1\nratio in circular polarization between J=1-0 and J=2-1 predicted by standard\nZeeman theory cannot unfortunately be tested conclusively due to insufficient\ncoincident components.\n", "  We investigate the role of magnetic helicity in promoting cyclic magnetic\nactivity in a global, 3D, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a convective\ndynamo. This simulation is characterized by coherent bands of toroidal field\nthat exist within the convection zone, with opposite polarities in the northern\nand southern hemispheres. Throughout most of the cycle, the magnetic helicity\nin these bands is negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the\nsouthern hemisphere. However, during the declining phase of each cycle, this\nhemispheric rule reverses. We attribute this to a global restructuring of the\nmagnetic topology that is induced by the interaction of the bands across the\nequator. This band interaction appears to be ultimately responsible for, or at\nleast associated with, the decay and subsequent reversal of both the toroidal\nbands and the polar fields. We briefly discuss the implications of these\nresults within the context of solar observations, which also show some\npotential evidence for toroidal band interactions and helicity reversals.\n", "  The prompt Gamma-Ray Bursts' (GRBs) efficiency is an important clue on the\nemission mechanism producing the $\\gamma$-rays. Previous estimates of the\nkinetic energy of the blast waves, based on the X-ray afterglow luminosity\n$L_X$, suggested that this efficiency is large, with values above 90\\% in some\ncases. This poses a problem to emission mechanisms and in particular to the\ninternal shocks model. These estimates are based, however, on the assumption\nthat the X-ray emitting electrons are fast cooling and that their Inverse\nCompton (IC) losses are negligible. The observed correlations between $L_X$\n(and hence the blast wave energy) and $E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$, the isotropic\nequivalent energy in the prompt emission, has been considered as observational\nevidence supporting this analysis. It is reasonable that the prompt gamma-ray\nenergy and the blast wave kinetic energy are correlated and the observed\ncorrelation corroborates, therefore, the notion $L_X$ is indeed a valid proxy\nfor the latter. Recent findings suggest that the magnetic field in the\nafterglow shocks is significantly weaker than was earlier thought and its\nequipartition fraction, $\\epsilon_B$, could be as low as $10^{-4}$ or even\nlower. Motivated by these findings we reconsider the problem, taking now IC\ncooling into account. We find that the observed $L_X-E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$\ncorrelation is recovered also when IC losses are significant. For small\n$\\epsilon_B$ values the blast wave must be more energetic and we find that the\ncorresponding prompt efficiency is significantly smaller than previously\nthought. For example, for $\\epsilon_B\\sim10^{-4}$ we infer a typical prompt\nefficiency of $\\sim15\\%$.\n", "  We present nucleosynthesis predictions (HeCNOCl) from asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) models, with diffusive overshooting from all the convective borders, in\nthe metallicity range Z/4 < Z < 2Zsun. They are compared to recent precise\nnebular abundances in a sample of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) that is\ndivided among double-dust chemistry (DC) and oxygen-dust chemistry (OC)\naccording to the infrared dust features. Unlike the similar subsample of\nGalactic carbon-dust chemistry PNe recently analysed by us, here the individual\nabundance errors, the higher metallicity spread, and the uncertain dust\ntypes/subtypes in some PNe do not allow a clear determination of the AGB\nprogenitor masses (and formation epochs) for both PNe samples; the comparison\nis thus more focussed on a object-by-object basis. The lowest metallicity OC\nPNe evolve from low-mass (~1 Msun) O-rich AGBs, while the higher metallicity\nones (all with uncertain dust classifications) display a chemical pattern\nsimilar to the DC PNe. In agreement with recent literature, the DC PNe mostly\ndescend from high-mass (M > 3.5 Msun) solar/supersolar metallicity AGBs that\nexperience hot bottom burning (HBB), but other formation channels in low-mass\nAGBs like extra mixing, stellar rotation, binary interaction, or He\npre-enrichment cannot be disregarded until more accurate C/O ratios would be\nobtained. Two objects among the DC PNe show the imprint of advanced CNO\nprocessing and deep second dredge-up, suggesting progenitors masses close to\nthe limit to evolve as core collapse supernovae (above 6 Msun). Their actual\nC/O ratio, if confirmed, indicate contamination from the third dredge-up,\nrejecting the hypothesis that the chemical composition of such high-metallicity\nmassive AGBs is modified exclusively by HBB.\n", "  The $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg model is a \"canonical\" model in the field of\nquantum magnetism in order to study the interplay between frustration and\nquantum fluctuations as well as quantum phase transitions driven by\nfrustration. Here we apply the Coupled Cluster Method (CCM) to study the\nspin-half $J_1$--$J_2$ model with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor bonds $J_1\n>0$ and next-nearest-neighbor bonds $J_2 >0$ for the simple cubic (SC) and\nbody-centered cubic (BCC) lattices. In particular, we wish to study the\nground-state ordering of these systems as a function of the frustration\nparameter $p=z_2J_2/z_1J_1$, where $z_1$ ($z_2$) is the number of nearest\n(next-nearest) neighbors. We wish to determine the positions of the phase\ntransitions using the CCM and we aim to resolve the nature of the phase\ntransition points. We consider the ground-state energy, order parameters,\nspin-spin correlation functions as well as the spin stiffness in order to\ndetermine the ground-state phase diagrams of these models. We find a direct\nfirst-order phase transition at a value of $p = 0.528$ from a state of\nnearest-neighbor N\\'eel order to next-nearest-neighbor N\\'eel order for the BCC\nlattice. For the SC lattice the situation is more subtle. CCM results for the\nenergy, the order parameter, the spin-spin correlation functions and the spin\nstiffness indicate that there is no direct first-order transition between\nground-state phases with magnetic long-range order, rather it is more likely\nthat two phases with antiferromagnetic long-range are separated by a narrow\nregion of a spin-liquid like quantum phase around $p=0.55$. Thus the strong\nfrustration present in the $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the SC lattice may\nopen a window for an unconventional quantum ground state in this\nthree-dimensional spin model.\n", "  We present an overview of beyond mean field theories (BMFT) based on the\ngenerator coordinate method (GCM) and the recovery of symmetries used in\nnuclear physics with effective forces. After a reminder of the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory a discussion of the shortcomings of any\nmean field approximation (MFA) is presented. The recovery of the symmetries\nspontaneously broken in the HFB approach, in particular the angular momentum,\nis necessary, among others, to describe excited states and transitions.\nParticle number projection is needed to guarantee the right number of protons\nand neutrons. Furthermore a projection before the variation prevents the\npairing collapse in the weak pairing regime. The lack of fluctuations around\nthe average values of the MFA is a shortcoming of this approach. To build in\ncorrelations in BMFT one selects the relevant degrees of freedom: quadrupole,\noctupole and the pairing vibrations as well as the single particle ones. In the\nGCM the operators representing these degrees of freedom are used as coordinates\nto generate a collective subspace. The highly correlated GCM wave function is\nfinally written as a linear combination of a projected basis of this space. The\nvariation of the coefficients of the linear combination leads to the\nHill-Wheeler equation. We discuss the classical beta and gamma vibrations by\nconsidering the quadrupole operators as coordinates. We present pairing\nfluctuations by considering the pairing gaps as generator coordinates. Lastly\nthe explicit consideration of the time reversal symmetry breaking in the HFB\nwave function by the cranking procedure allows the alignment of nucleon pairs\nopening a new dimension in the BMFT calculations. Abundant calculations with\nthe Gogny force illustrate the state-of-the-art of BMFTs with density\nfunctionals. We conclude with a thorough discussion on the potential poles of\nthe theory.\n", "  PKS 1424+240 is a distant very high energy gamma-ray BL Lac object with\nredshift $z=0.601$. It was found that pure synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\nprocess normally need extreme input parameters (e.g., very low magnetic field\nintensity and extraordinarily large Doppler factor) to explain its\nmulti-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs). To avoid the extreme\nmodel parameters, different models have been proposed (e.g., two-zone SSC model\nor lepto-hadronic model). In this work, we employ the traditional one-zone\nleptonic model after including a weak external Compton component to re-explore\nthe simultaneous multi-wavelength SEDs of PKS 1424+240 in both high (2009) and\nlow (2013) states. We find that the input parameters of magnetic field and\nDoppler factor are roughly consistent with those of other BL Lacs if a weak\nexternal photon field from either broad line region (BLR) or the dust torus.\nHowever, the required energy density of seed photons from BLR or torus is about\n3 orders of magnitude less than that constrained in luminous quasars (e.g.,\nflat-spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs). This result suggests that the BLR/torus in\nBL Lacs is much weaker than that of luminous FSRQs (but not fully disappear),\nand the inverse-Compton of external photons from BLR/torus may still play a\nrole even in high synchrotron peaked blazars.\n", "  Objects transiting near or within the disruption radius of both main sequence\n(e.g. KOI 1843) and white dwarf (WD 1145+017) stars are now known. Upon\nfragmentation or disintegration, these planets or asteroids may produce\nco-orbital configurations of nearly equal-mass objects. However, as evidenced\nby the co-orbital objects detected by transit photometry in the WD 1145+017\nsystem, these bodies are largely unconstrained in size, mass, and total number\n(multiplicity). Motivated by potential future similar discoveries, we perform\nN-body simulations to demonstrate if and how debris masses and multiplicity may\nbe bounded due to second-to-minute deviations and the resulting accumulated\nphase shifts in the osculating orbital period amongst multiple co-orbital equal\npoint masses. We establish robust lower and upper mass bounds as a function of\norbital period deviation, but find the constraints on multiplicity to be weak.\nWe also quantify the fuzzy instability boundary, and show that mutual\ncollisions occur in less than 5%, 10% and 20% of our simulations for masses of\n10^{21}, 10^{22} and 10^{23} kg. Our results may provide useful initial rough\nconstraints on other stellar systems with multiple co-orbital bodies.\n", "  We study the global structure of optically thin, advection dominated,\nmagnetized accretion flow around black holes. We consider the magnetic field to\nbe turbulent in nature and dominated by the toroidal component. With this, we\nobtain the complete set of accretion solutions for dissipative flows where\nbremsstrahlung process is regarded as the dominant cooling mechanism. We show\nthat rotating magnetized accretion flow experiences virtual barrier around\nblack hole due to centrifugal repulsion that can trigger the discontinuous\ntransition of the flow variables in the form of shock waves. We examine the\nproperties of the shock waves and find that the dynamics of the post-shock\ncorona (PSC) is controlled by the flow parameters, namely viscosity, cooling\nrate and strength of the magnetic field, respectively. We separate the\neffective region of the parameter space for standing shock and observe that\nshock can form for wide range of flow parameters. We obtain the critical\nviscosity parameter that allows global accretion solutions including shocks. We\nestimate the energy dissipation at the PSC from where a part of the accreting\nmatter can deflect as outflows and jets. We compare the maximum energy that\ncould be extracted from the PSC and the observed radio luminosity values for\nseveral super-massive black hole sources and the observational implications of\nour present analysis are discussed.\n", "  The two-dimensional organic conductor $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ undergoes\na metal-insulator transition at $T_{\\rm CO}=135$ K due to electronic charge\nordering. We have conducted time-resolved investigations of its electronic\nproperties in order to explore the field- and temperature-dependent dynamics.\nAt a certain threshold field, the system switches from low-conducting to a\nhigh-conducting state, accompanied by a negative differential resistance. Our\ntime-dependent infrared investigations indicate that close to $T_{\\rm CO}$ the\nstrong electric field pushes the crystal into a metallic state with optical\nproperties similar to the one for $T>T_{\\rm CO}$. Well into the insulating\nstate, however, at $T=80$ K, the spectral response evidences a completely\ndifferent electronically-induced high-conducting state. Applying a two-state\nmodel of hot electrons explains the observations by excitation of charge\ncarriers with a high mobility. They resemble the Dirac-like charge-carriers\nwith a linear dispersion of the electronic bands found in\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ at high-pressure. Extensive numerical simulations\nquantitatively reproduce our experimental findings in all details.\n", "  The past decade and a half has seen the design and execution of several\nground-based spectroscopic surveys, both Galactic and Extra-galactic.\nAdditionally, new surveys are being designed that extend the boundaries of\ncurrent surveys. In this context, many important considerations must be done\nwhen designing a spectrograph for the future. Among these is the determination\nof the optimum wavelength coverage. In this work, we present a new code for\ndetermining the wavelength ranges that provide the optimal amount of\ninformation to achieve the required science goals for a given survey. In its\nfirst mode, it utilizes a user-defined list of spectral features to compute a\nfigure-of-merit for different spectral configurations. The second mode utilizes\na set of flux-calibrated spectra, determining the spectral regions that show\nthe largest differences among the spectra. Our algorithm is easily adaptable\nfor any set of science requirements and any spectrograph design. We apply the\nalgorithm to several examples, including 4MOST, showing the method yields\nimportant design constraints to the wavelength regions.\n", "  We present the results of a detailed study of the X-ray power spectra density\n(PSD) functions of twelve X-ray bright AGN, using almost all the archival\nXMM-Newton data. The total net exposure of the EPIC-pn light curves is larger\nthan 350 ks in all cases (and exceeds 1 Ms in the case of 1H 0707-497). In a\nphysical scenario in which X-ray reflection occurs in the inner part of the\naccretion disc of AGN, the X-ray reflection component should be a filtered echo\nof the X-ray continuum signal and should be equal to the convolution of the\nprimary emission with the response function of the disc. Our primary objective\nis to search for these reflection features in the 5-7 keV (iron line) and 0.5-1\nkeV (soft) bands, where the X-ray reflection fraction is expected to be\ndominant. We fit to the observed periodograms two models: a simple bending\npower law model (BPL) and a BPL model convolved with the transfer function of\nthe accretion disc assuming the lamp-post geometry and X-ray reflection from a\nhomogeneous disc. We do not find any significant features in the best-fitting\nBPL model residuals either in individual PSDs in the iron band, soft and full\nband (0.3-10 keV) or in the average PSD residuals of the brightest and more\nvariable sources (with similar black hole mass estimates). The typical\namplitude of the soft and full-band residuals is around 3-5 per cent. It is\npossible that the expected general relativistic effects are not detected\nbecause they are intrinsically lower than the uncertainty of the current PSDs,\neven in the strong relativistic case in which X-ray reflection occurs on a disc\naround a fast rotating black hole having an X-ray source very close above it.\nHowever, we could place strong constrains to the X-ray reflection geometry with\nthe current data sets if we knew in advance the intrinsic shape of the X-ray\nPSDs, particularly its high frequency slope.\n", "  We present the first results from an integral field (IFU) spectroscopic\nsurvey of a 75kpc region around three Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs),\ncombining over 100 IFU fibres to study the intracluster light (ICL). We fit\npopulation synthesis models to estimate age and metallicity. For Abell 85 and\nAbell 2457, the ICL is best-fit with a fraction of old, metal-rich stars like\nin the BCG, but requires 30-50% young and metal-poor stars, a component not\nfound in the BCGs. This is consistent with the ICL having been formed by a\ncombination of interactions with less massive, younger, more metal-poor cluster\nmembers in addition to stars that form the BCG. We find that the three galaxies\nare in different stages of evolution and may be the result of different\nformation mechanisms. The BCG in Abell 85 is near a relatively young,\nmetal-poor galaxy, but the dynamical friction timescale is long and the two are\nunlikely to be undergoing a merger. The outer regions of Abell 2457 show a\nhigher relative fraction of metal-poor stars, and we find one companion, with a\nhigher fraction of young, metal-poor stars than the BCG, which is likely to\nmerge within a gigayear. Several luminous red galaxies are found at the centre\nof the cluster IIZw108, with short merger timescales, suggesting the system is\nabout to embark on a series of major mergers to build up a dominant BCG. The\nyoung, metal-poor component found in the ICL is not found in the merging\ngalaxies.\n", "  We have measured the absolute proper motion of the Draco dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy using Subaru Suprime-Cam images taken at three epochs, with time\nbaselines of 4.4 and 7 years. The magnitude limit of the proper-motion study is\ni=25, thus allowing for thousands of background galaxies and Draco stars to be\nused to perform extensive astrometric tests and to derive the correction to an\ninertial reference frame. The derived proper motion is (mu_alpha, mu_delta)\n=(-0.284 +- 0.047, -0.289 +-0.041) mas/yr. This motion implies an orbit that\ntakes Draco to a pericenter of $\\sim 20$ kpc; a somewhat disruptive orbit\nsuggesting that tides might account for the rising velocity-dispersion profile\nof Draco seen in line-of-sight velocity studies. The orbit is only marginally\nconsistent with Draco's membership to the vast polar structure of Galactic\nsatellites, in contrast to a recent HST proper-motion measurement that finds\nalignment very likely. Our study is a test case to demonstrate that deep\nimaging with mosaic cameras of appropriate resolution can be used for\nhigh-accuracy, ground-based proper-motion measurement. As a useful by-product\nof the study, we also identify two faint brown-dwarf candidates in the\nforeground field.\n", "  In the absence of detectable pulsations in the eclipsing High Mass X-ray\nbinary 4U 1700-37, the orbital period decay is necessarily determined from the\neclipse timing measurements. We have used the earlier reported mid-eclipse time\nmeasurements of 4U 1700-37 together with the new measurements from long term\nlight curves obtained with the all sky monitors RXTE-ASM, Swift-BAT and\nMAXI-GSC, as well as observations with RXTE-PCA, to measure the long term\norbital evolution of the binary. The orbital period decay rate of the system is\nestimated to be ${\\dot{P}}/P = -(4.7 \\pm 1.9) \\times 10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$,\nsmaller compared to its previous estimates. We have also used the mid-eclipse\ntimes and the eclipse duration measurements obtained from 10 years long X-ray\nlight-curve with Swift-BAT to separately put constraints on the eccentricity of\nthe binary system and attempted to measure any apsidal motion. For an apsidal\nmotion rate greater than 5 degrees per year, the eccentricity is found to be\nless than 0.008, which limits our ability to determine the apsidal motion rate\nfrom the current data. We discuss the discrepancy of the current limit of\neccentricity with the earlier reported values from radial velocity measurements\nof the companion star.\n", "  We report on the identification of the new Galactic Center (GC) transient\nSwift J174540.7-290015 as a likely low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) located at only\n16 arcsec from Sgr A*. This transient was detected on 2016 February 6th during\nthe Swift GC monitoring, and it showed long-term spectral variations compatible\nwith a hard to soft state transition. We observed the field with XMM-Newton on\nFebruary 26th for 35 ks, detecting the source in the soft state, characterised\nby a low level of variability and a soft X-ray thermal spectrum with a high\nenergy tail (detected by INTEGRAL up to ~50 keV), typical of either accreting\nneutron stars or black holes. We observed: i) a high column density of neutral\nabsorbing material, suggesting that Swift J174540.7-290015 is located near or\nbeyond the GC and; ii) a sub-Solar Iron abundance, therefore we argue that Iron\nis depleted into dust grains. The lack of detection of FeK absorption lines,\neclipses or dipping suggests that the accretion disc is observed at a low\ninclination angle. Radio (VLA) observations did not detect any radio\ncounterpart to Swift J174540.7-290015. No evidence for X-ray or radio\nperiodicity is found. The location of the transient was observed also in the\nnear-IR with GROND at MPG/ESO La Silla 2.2m telescope and VLT/NaCo pre- and\npost-outburst. Within the Chandra error region we find multiple objects that\ndisplay no significant variations.\n", "  We present the results of three dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations of interaction of AGN jets with a dense turbulent two-phase\ninterstellar medium, which would be typical of high redshift galaxies. We\ndescribe the effect of the jet on the evolution of the density of the turbulent\nISM. The jet driven energy bubble affects the gas to distances up to several\nkiloparsecs from the injection region. The shocks resulting from such\ninteractions create a multi-phase ISM and radial outflows. One of the striking\nresult of this work is that low power jets (P_jet < 10^{43} erg/s) although\nless efficient in accelerating clouds, are trapped in the ISM for a longer time\nand hence affect the ISM over a larger volume. Jets of higher power drill\nthrough with relative ease. Although the relativistic jets launch strong\noutflows, there is little net mass ejection to very large distances, supporting\na galactic fountain scenario for local feedback.\n", "  Secular period variations, $\\beta=\\dot{P}$, in 76 RR Lyrae stars in the\nglobular cluster M5 are analysed using our most recent CCD $V$ photometry and\nthe historical photometric database available in the literature since 1889.\nThis provides a time baseline of up to 118 years for these variables. The\nanalysis was performed using two independent approaches: first, the classical\n$O-C$ behaviour of the time of maximum light, and second, via a grid\n$(P,\\beta)$, where the solution producing the minimum scatter in the phased\nlight curve is chosen. The results of the two methods agree satisfactorily.\nThis allowed a new interpretation of the nature of the period changes in many\nRR Lyrae stars in M5. It is found that in $96\\%$ of the stars studied no\nirregular or stochastic variations need to be claimed, but that $66\\%$ of the\npopulation shows steady period increases or decreases, and that $34\\%$ of the\nperiods seem to have been stable over the last century.\n  The lack of systematic positive or negative period variations in RR Lyrae\nstars in other globular clusters is addressed, and the paradigm of period\nchanges being a consequence of stellar evolution is discussed in terms of\nchemical variations near the stellar core and of multiple stellar populations.\nIn M5 we found a small positive average value of $\\beta$ and a small surplus of\nRRab stars with a period increase. Nevertheless, in M5 we have been able to\nisolate a group of likely evolved stars that systematically show positive, and\nin some cases large, period change rates.\n", "  Historically, compact group catalogues vary not only in their identification\nalgorithms and selection functions, but also in their photometric bands.\nDifferences between compact group catalogues have been reported. However, it is\ndifficult to assess the impact of the photometric band in these differences\ngiven the variety of identification algorithms. We used the mock lightcone\nbuilt by Henriques et al. (2012) to identify and compare compact groups in\nthree different photometric bands: $K$, $r$, and $u$. We applied the same\nselection functions in the three bands, and found that compact groups in the\nu-band look the smallest in projection, the difference between the two\nbrightest galaxies is the largest in the K-band, while compact groups in the\nr-band present the lowest compactness. We also investigated the differences\nbetween samples when galaxies are selected only in one particular band (pure\ncompact groups) and those that exist regardless the band in which galaxies were\nobserved (common compact groups). We found that the differences between the\ntotal samples are magnified, but also some others arise: pure-r compact groups\nare the largest in projection; pure-u compact groups have the brightest first\nranked galaxies, and the most similar two first ranked galaxies; pure-K compact\ngroups have the highest compactness and the most different two first ranked\ngalaxies; and common compact groups show the largest percentage of physically\ndense groups. Therefore, without a careful selection and identification of the\nsamples, the characteristic features of group properties in a particular\nphotometric band could be overshadowed.\n", "  We present an analysis of recent X-ray observations of the symbiotic star AG\nPeg. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed with Swift in 2015 shows\nconsiderable variability on time scale of days as variability on shorter time\nscales might be present as well. Analysis of the X-ray spectra obtained in 2013\nand 2015 confirms that AG Peg is an X-ray source of class $\\beta$ of the X-ray\nsources amongst the symbiotic stars. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed\nwith ROSAT (1993 June) might well originate from colliding stellar winds (CSW)\nin binary system. On the other hand, the characteristics of the X-ray emission\nof AG Peg in 2013 and 2015 (Swift) are hard to accommodate in the framework of\nthe CSW picture. Analysis of the light curves in 2015 shows that the power\nspectrum of the X-ray variability in AG Peg resembles that of the flicker noise\n(or flickering) being typical for accretion processes in astronomical objects.\nThis is a sign that CSWs did not play a key role for the X-ray emission from AG\nPeg in 2013-2015 and a different mechanism (probably accretion) is also getting\ninto play.\n", "  We present new high-resolution, multi-epoch, VLBA radio images of the\nGalactic microquasar SS 433. We are able to observe plasma knots in the\nmilliarcsecond-scale jets more than 50 days after their launch. This\nunprecedented baseline in time allows us to determine the bulk launch speed of\nthe radio-emitting plasma during a radio flare, using a new method which we\npresent here, and which is completely independent of optical spectroscopy. We\nalso apply this method to an earlier sequence of 39 short daily VLBA\nobservations, which cover a period in which SS 433 moved from quiescence into a\nflare. In both datasets we find, for the first time at radio wavebands, clear\nevidence that the launch speeds of the milliarcsecond-scale jets rise as high\nas 0.32c during flaring episodes. By comparing these images of SS 433 with\nphotometric radio monitoring from the RATAN telescope, we explore further\nproperties of these radio flares.\n", "  This paper presents a self-consistent model for the evolution of gas produced\nin the debris disc of $\\beta$ Pictoris. Our model proposes that atomic carbon\nand oxygen are created from the photodissociation of CO, which is itself\nreleased from volatile-rich bodies in the debris disc due to grain-grain\ncollisions or photodesorption. While the CO lasts less than one orbit, the\natomic gas evolves by viscous spreading resulting in an accretion disc inside\nthe parent belt and a decretion disc outside. The temperature, ionisation\nfraction and population levels of carbon and oxygen are followed with the\nphotodissociation region model Cloudy, which is coupled to a dynamical viscous\n$\\alpha$ model. We present new gas observations of $\\beta$ Pic, of C I observed\nwith APEX and O I observed with Herschel, and show that these along with\npublished C II and CO observations can all be explained with this new model.\nOur model requires a viscosity $\\alpha$ > 0.1, similar to that found in\nsufficiently ionised discs of other astronomical objects; we propose that the\nmagnetorotational instability is at play in this highly ionised and dilute\nmedium. This new model can be tested from its predictions for high resolution\nALMA observations of C I. We also constrain the water content of the\nplanetesimals in $\\beta$ Pic. The scenario proposed here might be at play in\nall debris discs and this model could be used more generally on all discs with\nC, O or CO detections.\n", "  Despite their reputation as being \"red and dead\", the unique environment\ninhabited by Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) can often lead to a\nself-regulated feedback cycle between radiatively cooling intracluster gas and\nstar formation and AGN activity in the BCG. However the prevalence of \"active\"\nBCGs, and details of the feedback involved, are still uncertain. We have\nperformed an optical, UV and Mid-IR photometric analysis of the BCGs in 981\nclusters at 0.03 < z < 0.5, selected from the ROSAT All Sky Survey. Using\nPan-STARRS PS1 3pi, GALEX and WISE survey data we look for BCGs with\nphotometric colours which deviate from that of the bulk population of passive\nBCGs - indicative of AGN and/or star formation activity within the BCG. We find\nthat whilst the majority of BCGs are consistent with being passive, at least\n14% of our BCGs show a significant colour offset from passivity in at least one\ncolour index. And, where available, supplementary spectroscopy reveals the\nmajority of these particular BCGs show strong optical emission lines. On\ncomparing BCG \"activity\" with the X-ray luminosity of the host cluster, we find\nthat BCGs showing a colour offset are preferentially found in the more X-ray\nluminous clusters, indicative of the connection between BCG \"activity\" and the\nintracluster medium.\n", "  We introduce a new transit search and vetting pipeline for observations from\nthe K2 mission, and present the candidate transiting planets identified by this\npipeline out of the targets in Campaigns 5 and 6. Our pipeline uses the\nGaussian Process-based K2SC code to correct for the K2 pointing systematics and\nsimultaneously model stellar variability. The systematics-corrected,\nvariability-detrended light curves are searched for transits with the Box Least\nSquares method, and a period-dependent detection threshold is used to generate\na preliminary candidate list. Two or three individuals vet each candidate\nmanually to produce the final candidate list, using a set of\nautomatically-generated transit fits and assorted diagnostic tests to inform\nthe vetting. We detect 147 single-planet system candidates and 5 multi-planet\nsystems, independently recovering the previously-published hot~Jupiters EPIC\n212110888b, WASP-55b (EPIC 212300977b) and Qatar-2b (EPIC 212756297b). We also\nreport the outcome of reconnaissance spectroscopy carried out for all\ncandidates with Kepler magnitude Kp < 13, identifying 12 targets as likely\nfalse positives. We compare our results to those of other K2 transit search\npipelines, noting that ours performs particularly well for variable and/or\nactive stars, but that the results are very similar overall. All the light\ncurves and code used in the transit search and vetting process are publicly\navailable, as are the follow-up spectra.\n", "  Interferometric radio astronomy data require the effects of limited coverage\nin the Fourier plane to be accounted for via a deconvolution process. For the\nlast 40 years this process, known as `cleaning', has been performed almost\nexclusively on all Stokes parameters individually as if they were independent\nscalar images. However, here we demonstrate for the case of the linear\npolarisation $\\mathcal{P}$, this approach fails to properly account for the\ncomplex vector nature resulting in a process which is dependant on the axis\nunder which the deconvolution is performed. We present here an improved method,\n`Generalised Complex CLEAN', which properly accounts for the complex vector\nnature of polarised emission and is invariant under rotations of the\ndeconvolution axis. We use two Australia Telescope Compact Array datasets to\ntest standard and complex CLEAN versions of the H\\\"{o}gbom and SDI CLEAN\nalgorithms. We show that in general the Complex CLEAN version of each algorithm\nproduces more accurate clean components with fewer spurious detections and\nlower computation cost due to reduced iterations than the current methods. In\nparticular we find that the Complex SDI CLEAN produces the best results for\ndiffuse polarised sources as compared with standard CLEAN algorithms and other\nComplex CLEAN algorithms. Given the move to widefield, high resolution\npolarimetric imaging with future telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array,\nwe suggest that Generalised Complex CLEAN should be adopted as the\ndeconvolution method for all future polarimetric surveys and in particular that\nthe complex version of a SDI CLEAN should be used.\n", "  An open question in cosmology and the theory of structure formation is to\nwhat extent does environment affect the properties of galaxies and haloes. The\npresent paper aims at shedding light on this problem. The paper focuses on the\nanalysis of a dark matter only simulation and it addresses the issue of how the\nenvironment affects the abundance of haloes, which are are assigned four\nattributes: their virial mass, an ambient density calculated with an aperture\nthat scales with $R_{vir}$ ($\\Delta_M$), a fixed-aperture ($\\Delta_R$) ambient\ndensity, and a cosmic web classification (i.e. voids, sheets, filaments, and\nknots, as defined by the V--web algorithm). $\\Delta_M$ is the mean density\naround a halo evaluated within a sphere of a radius of $5$\\rvir, where \\rvir\\\nis the virial radius. $\\Delta_R$ is the density field Gaussian smoothed with\n$R=4h^{-1}$Mpc, evaluated at the center of the halo.\n  The main result of the paper is that the difference between haloes in\ndifferent web elements stems from the difference in their mass functions, and\ndoes not depend on their adaptive-aperture ambient density. A dependence on the\nfixed-aperture ambient density is induced by the cross correlation between the\nmass of a halo and its fixed-aperture ambient density.\n", "  We report on the evidenced orbital mediated electron phonon coupling and band\ngap tuning in HoFe1-xCrxO3 compounds. From the room temperature Raman\nscattering, it is apparent that the electron-phonon coupling is sensitive to\nthe presence of both the Fe and Cr at the B-site. Essentially, an Ag like local\noxygen breathing mode is activated due to the charge transfer between Fe3+ -\nCr3+ at around 670 cm-1, this observation is explained on the basis of\nFranck-Condon (FC) mechanism. Optical absorption studies infer that there\nexists a direct band gap in the HoFe1-xCrxO3 compounds. Decrease in band gap\nuntil x = 0.5 is ascribed to the broadening of the oxygen p orbitals as a\nresult of the induced spin disorder due to Fe3+ and Cr3+ at B site. In\ncontrast, the increase in band gap above x = 0.5 is explained on the basis of\nthe reduction in the available unoccupied d - orbitals of Fe3+ at the\nconduction band. We believe that above results would be helpful for the\ndevelopment of the optoelectronic devices based on the ortho-ferrites.\n", "  In this paper we show how tomographic imaging (Zeeman Doppler Imaging, ZDI)\ncan be used to characterize stellar activity and magnetic field topologies,\nultimately allowing to filter out the radial velocity (RV) activity jitter of\nM-dwarf moderate rotators. This work is based on spectropolarimetric\nobservations of a sample of five weakly-active early M-dwarfs (GJ 205, GJ 358,\nGJ 410, GJ479, GJ 846) with HARPS-Pol and NARVAL. These stars have v sin i and\nRV jitters in the range 1-2 km/s and 2.7-10.0 m/s rms respectively. Using a\nmodified version of ZDI applied to sets of phase-resolved Least-Squares- Decon-\nvolved (LSD) profiles of unpolarized spectral lines, we are able to\ncharacterize the distribution of active regions at the stellar surfaces. We\nfind that darks spots cover less than 2% of the total surface of the stars of\nour sample. Our technique is e cient at modeling the rotationally mod- ulated\ncomponent of the activity jitter, and succeeds at decreasing the amplitude of\nthis com- ponent by typical factors of 2-3 and up to 6 in optimal cases. From\nthe rotationally modulated time-series of circularly polarized spectra and with\nZDI, we also reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field topology. These fields\nsuggest that bi-stability of dynamo processes observed in active M dwarfs may\nalso be at work for moderately active M dwarfs. Comparing spot distributions\nwith field topologies suggest that dark spots causing activity jitter\nconcentrate at the magnetic pole and/or equator, to be confirmed with future\ndata on a larger sample.\n", "  Classical novae are the product of thermonuclear runaway-initiated explosions\noccurring on accreting white dwarfs. V339 Del (Nova Delphinus 2013) was one of\nthe brightest classical novae of the last hundred years. Spectroscopy and\nphotometry are available from $\\gamma$-rays through infrared at stages that\nhave frequently not been well observed. The complete data set is intended to\nprovide a benchmark for comparison with modeling and for understanding more\nsparsely monitored historical classical and recurrent novae. This paper is the\nfirst in the series of reports on the development of the nova. We report here\non the early stages of the outburst, through the X-ray active stage. A time\nsequence of optical, flux calibrated high resolution spectra was obtained with\nthe Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) using FIES simultaneously, or\ncontemporaneously, with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard\nthe Hubble Space Telescope during the early stages of the outburst. These were\nsupplemented with MERCATOR/HERMES optical spectra. High resolution IUE\nultraviolet spectra of OS And 1986, taken during the Fe curtain phase, served\nas a template for the distance determination. We used standard plasma\ndiagnostics (e.g., [O III] and [N II] line ratios, and the H$\\beta$ line flux)\nto constrain electron densities and temperatures of the ejecta. Using Monte\nCarlo modeling of the ejecta, we derived the structure, filling factor, and\nmass from comparisons of the optical and ultraviolet line profiles.\n", "  The scaling relations between global asteroseismic observables and stellar\nproperties are widely used to estimate masses and radii of stars exhibiting\nsolar-like oscillations. Since the mass and radius of the Sun are known\nindependently, the Sun is commonly used as a reference to scale to. However,\nthe validity of the scaling relations depends on the homology between the star\nunder study and the reference star. Solar-like oscillators span a wide range of\nmasses and metallicities, as well as evolutionary phases. Most of these stars\nare therefore not homologous to the Sun. This leads to errors of up to 10% (5%)\nin mass (radius) when using the asteroseismic scaling relations with the Sun as\nthe reference. In this paper we derive a reference function to replace the\nsolar-reference value used in the large-frequency-separation scaling relation.\nOur function is the first that depends on both effective temperature and\nmetallicity, and is applicable from the end of the main sequence to just above\nthe bump on the red giant branch. This reference function improves the\nestimates of masses and radii determined through scaling relations by a factor\nof 2, i.e. allows masses and radii to be recovered with an accuracy of 5% and\n2%, respectively.\n", "  We report a heat switch effect in single crystals of an antiferromagnet\nCo$_3$V$_2$O$_8$, that is, the thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$) can be changed\nwith magnetic field in an extremely large scale. Due to successive magnetic\nphase transitions at 12--6 K, the zero-field $\\kappa(T)$ displays a deep\nminimum at 6.7 K and rather small magnitude at low temperatures. Both the\ntemperature and field dependencies of $\\kappa$ demonstrate that the phonons are\nstrongly scattered at the regime of magnetic phase transitions. Magnetic field\ncan suppress magnetic scattering effect and significantly recover the phonon\nthermal conductivity. In particular, a 14 T field along the $a$ axis increases\nthe $\\kappa$ at 7.5 K up to 100 times. For $H \\parallel c$, the magnitude of\n$\\kappa$ can be suppressed down to $\\sim$ 8% at some field-induced transition\nand can be enhanced up to 20 times at 14 T. The present results demonstrate\nthat it is possible to design a kind of heat switch in the family of magnetic\nmaterials.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss some of the consequences of the CGPM (1983)\ndefinition of meter and, in particular, we discuss giving the speed of light an\nexact value. It is shown that this act touches the fundamental paradigms, such\nas the second postulate of the special theory of relativity (STR), the\nc-equivalence principle and the method of time synchronization. In order to\nfill the arising logical gaps, we suggest, among others, to weaken the second\npostulate of STR to a form directly confirmed by experiments and make new\nmeasurements of Maxwell's constant with accuracy comparable with that of the\nspeed of light.\n", "  Stars form when filaments and dense cores in molecular clouds fragment and\ncollapse due to self-gravity. In the most basic analyses of gravitational\nstability, the competition between self-gravity and thermal pressure sets the\ncritical (i.e. maximum stable) mass of spheres and the critical line density of\ncylinders. Previous work has considered additional support from magnetic fields\nand turbulence. Here, we consider the effects of non-ionizing radiation,\nspecifically the inward radiation pressure force that acts on dense structures\nembedded in an isotropic radiation field. Using hydrostatic, isothermal models,\nwe find that irradiation lowers the critical mass and line density for\ngravitational collapse, and can thus act as a trigger for star formation. For\nstructures with moderate central densities, $\\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, the\ninterstellar radiation field in the Solar vicinity has an order unity effect on\nstability thresholds. For more evolved objects with higher central densities, a\nsignificant lowering of stability thresholds requires stronger irradiation, as\ncan be found closer to the Galactic center or near stellar associations. Even\nwhen strong sources of ionizing radiation are absent or extincted, our study\nshows that interstellar irradiation can significantly influence the star\nformation process.\n", "  Narrow-band HST imaging has resolved the detailed internal structure of the\n10 kpc diameter H alpha+[NII] emission line nebulosity in NGC4696, the central\ngalaxy in the nearby Centaurus cluster, showing that the dusty, molecular,\nfilaments have a width of about 60pc. Optical morphology and velocity\nmeasurements indicate that the filaments are dragged out by the bubbling action\nof the radio source as part of the AGN feedback cycle. Using the drag force we\nfind that the magnetic field in the filaments is in approximate pressure\nequipartition with the hot gas. The filamentary nature of the cold gas\ncontinues inward, swirling around and within the Bondi accretion radius of the\ncentral black hole, revealing the magnetic nature of the gas flows in massive\nelliptical galaxies. HST imaging resolves the magnetic, dusty, molecular\nfilaments at the centre of the Centaurus cluster to a swirl around and within\nthe Bondi radius.\n", "  The Halpha and optical broadband images of 25 nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies\nare presented. The WR galaxies are known to have the presence of a recent\n($\\le$10 Myr) and massive star formation episode. The photometric Halpha fluxes\nare estimated, and corrected for extinction and line contamination in the\nfilter pass-bands. The star formation rates (SFRs) are estimated using Halpha\nimages and from the archival data in the far-ultraviolet (FUV), far-infrared\n(FIR) and 1.4 GHz radio continuum wave-bands. A comparison of SFRs estimated\nfrom different wavebands is made after including similar data available in\nliterature for other WR galaxies. The Halpha based SFRs are found to be tightly\ncorrelated with SFRs estimated from the FUV data. The correlations also exist\nwith SFRs estimates based on the radio and FIR data. The WR galaxies also\nfollow the radio-FIR correlation known for normal star forming galaxies,\nalthough it is seen here that majority of dwarf WR galaxies have radio\ndeficiency. An analysis using ratio of non-thermal to thermal radio continuum\nand ratio of FUV to Halpha SFR indicates that WR galaxies have lesser\nnon-thermal radio emission compared to normal galaxies, most likely due to lack\nof supernova from the very young star formation episode in the WR galaxies. The\nmorphologies of 16 galaxies in our sample are highly suggestive of an ongoing\ntidal interaction or a past merger in these galaxies. This survey strengthens\nthe conclusions obtained from previous similar studies indicating the\nimportance of tidal interactions in triggering star-formation in WR galaxies.\n", "  Epsilon Eridani is a nearby, young Sun-like star that hosts a ring of cool\ndebris analogous to the solar system's Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Early\nobservations at (sub-)mm wavelengths gave tentative evidence of the presence of\ninhomogeneities in the ring, which have been ascribed to the effect of a\nputative low eccentricity planet, orbiting close to the ring. The existence of\nthese structures have been recently challenged by high resolution\ninterferometric millimeter observations. Here we present the deepest\nsingle-dish image of Epsilon Eridani at millimeter wavelengths, obtained with\nthe Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT). The main goal of these\nLMT observations is to confirm (or refute) the presence of non-axisymmetric\nstructure in the disk. The dusty ring is detected for the first time along its\nfull projected elliptical shape. The radial extent of the ring is not spatially\nresolved and shows no evidence, to within the uncertainties, of dust density\nenhancements. Additional features of the 1.1 mm map are: (i) the presence of\nsignificant flux in the gap between the ring and the star, probably providing\nthe first exo-solar evidence of Poynting-Robertson drag, (ii) an unambiguous\ndetection of emission at the stellar position with a flux significantly above\nthat expected from Epsilon Eridani's photosphere, and (iii) the identification\nof numerous unresolved sources which could correspond to background dusty\nstar-forming galaxies.\n", "  The construction of the KAT-7 array in the Karoo region of the Northern Cape\nin South Africa was intended primarily as an engineering prototype for\ntechnologies and techniques applicable to the MeerKAT telescope. This paper\nlooks at the main engineering and scien- tific highlights from this effort, and\ndiscusses their applicability to both MeerKAT and other next-generation radio\ntelescopes. In particular we found that the composite dish surface works well,\nbut it becomes complicated to fabricate for a dish lacking circular symmetry;\nthe Stir- ling cycle cryogenic system with ion pump to achieve vacuum works but\ndemands much higher maintenance than an equivalent Gifford-McMahon cycle\nsystem; the ROACH (Recon- figurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware)-based\ncorrelator with SPEAD (Stream- ing Protocol for Exchanging Astronomical Data)\nprotocol data transfer works very well and KATCP (Karoo Array Telescope Control\nProtocol) control protocol has proven very flexible and convenient. KAT-7 has\nalso been used for scientific observations where it has a niche in mapping low\nsurface-brightness continuum sources, some extended HI halos and OH masers in\nstar-forming regions. It can also be used to monitor continuum source\nvariability, observe pulsars, and make VLBI observations\n", "  The LHC diphoton excess 750 GeV is discussed in a string-inspired\nstandard-like model. Precisely, a singlet scalar-extended SM from a vacua of\nfour stacks of intersecting D6-branes giving rise to a large gauge symmetry is\nconsidered. Besides its relevant couplings to the SM sector, the involved\nscales allow for a scalar mass near to the reported diphoton excess.\n", "  We study the long term orbital evolution of a terrestrial planet under the\ngravitational perturbations of a giant planet. In particular, we are interested\nin situations where the two planets are in the same plane and are relatively\nclose. We examine both possible configurations: the giant planet orbit being\neither outside or inside the orbit of the smaller planet. The perturbing\npotential is expanded to high orders and an analytical solution of the\nterrestrial planetary orbit is derived. The analytical estimates are then\ncompared against results from the numerical integration of the full equations\nof motion and we find that the analytical solution works reasonably well. An\ninteresting finding is that the new analytical estimates improve greatly the\npredictions for the timescales of the orbital evolution of the terrestrial\nplanet compared to an octupole order expansion. Finally, we briefly discuss\npossible applications of the analytical estimates in astrophysical problems.\n", "  A correction to the Jeans stability criterion due to heat conduction is\nestablished for the case of high temperature gases. This effect is only\nrelevant for relativistic fluids and includes an additional term due to a\ndensity gradient driven heat flux. The result is obtained by thoroughly\nanalyzing the exponentially growing modes present in the dynamics of density\nfluctuations in the linearized relativistic Navier-Stokes regime. The\ncorrections to the corresponding Jeans mass and wavenumber are explicitly\nobtained and are compared to the non-relativistic and non-dissipative values\nusing the transport coefficients obtained in the BGK approximation.\n", "  The 3-part appearance of many CMEs arising from erupting filaments emerges\nfrom a large magnetic flux tube structure, consistent with the form of the\nerupting filament system. Other CMEs arising from erupting filaments lack a\nclear 3-part structure and reasons for this have not been researched in detail.\nThis paper aims to further establish the link between CME structure and the\nstructure of the erupting filament system and to investigate whether CMEs which\nlack a 3-part structure have different eruption characteristics. A survey is\nmade of 221 near-limb filament eruptions observed from 2013/05/03-2014/06/30 by\nEUV imagers and coronagraphs. 92 filament eruptions are associated with 3-part\nstructured CMEs, 41 eruptions are associated with unstructured CMEs. The\nremaining 88 are categorized as failed eruptions. For 34% of the 3-part CMEs,\nprocessing applied to EUV images reveals the erupting front edge is a\npre-existing loop structure surrounding the filament, which subsequently erupts\nwith the filament to form the leading bright front edge of the CME. This\nconnection is confirmed by a flux-rope density model. Furthermore, the\nunstructured CMEs have a narrower distribution of mass compared to structured\nCMEs, with total mass comparable to the mass of 3-part CME cores. This study\nsupports the interpretation of 3-part CME leading fronts as the outer\nboundaries of a large pre-existing flux tube. Unstructured (non 3-part) CMEs\nare a different family to structured CMEs, arising from the eruption of\nfilaments which are compact flux tubes in the absence of a large system of\nenclosing closed field.\n", "  Human agents happen to judge that a conjunction of two terms is more probable\nthan one of the terms, in contradiction with the rules of classical\nprobabilities---this is the conjunction fallacy. One of the most discussed\naccounts of this fallacy is currently the quantum-like explanation, which\nrelies on models exploiting the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The aim of\nthis paper is to investigate the empirical adequacy of major quantum-like\nmodels which represent beliefs with quantum states. We first argue that they\ncan be tested in three different ways, in a question order effect configuration\nwhich is different from the traditional conjunction fallacy experiment. We then\ncarry out our proposed experiment, with varied methodologies from experimental\neconomics. The experimental results we get are at odds with the predictions of\nthe quantum-like models. This strongly suggests that this quantum-like account\nof the conjunction fallacy fails. Future possible research paths are discussed.\n", "  We establish the full global non-linear stability of the Kerr-de Sitter\nfamily of black holes, as solutions of the initial value problem for the\nEinstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant, for small\nangular momenta, and without any symmetry assumptions on the initial data. We\nachieve this by extending the linear and non-linear analysis on black hole\nspacetimes described in a sequence of earlier papers by the authors: We develop\na general framework which enables us to deal systematically with the\ndiffeomorphism invariance of Einstein's equations. In particular, the iteration\nscheme used to solve Einstein's equations automatically finds the parameters of\nthe Kerr-de Sitter black hole that the solution is asymptotic to, the\nexponentially decaying tail of the solution, and the gauge in which we are able\nto find the solution; the gauge here is a wave map/DeTurck type gauge, modified\nby source terms which are treated as unknowns, lying in a suitable\nfinite-dimensional space.\n", "  Over the last few years the GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics\nProcessing Units) paradigm represented a remarkable development in the world of\ncomputing. Computing for High-Energy Physics is no exception: several works\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of the integration of GPU-based systems in\nhigh level trigger of different experiments. On the other hand the use of GPUs\nin the low level trigger systems, characterized by stringent real-time\nconstraints, such as tight time budget and high throughput, poses several\nchallenges. In this paper we focus on the low level trigger in the CERN NA62\nexperiment, investigating the use of real-time computing on GPUs in this\nsynchronous system. Our approach aimed at harvesting the GPU computing power to\nbuild in real-time refined physics-related trigger primitives for the RICH\ndetector, as the the knowledge of Cerenkov rings parameters allows to build\nstringent conditions for data selection at trigger level. Latencies of all\ncomponents of the trigger chain have been analyzed, pointing out that\nnetworking is the most critical one. To keep the latency of data transfer task\nunder control, we devised NaNet, an FPGA-based PCIe Network Interface Card\n(NIC) with GPUDirect capabilities. For the processing task, we developed\nspecific multiple ring trigger algorithms to leverage the parallel architecture\nof GPUs and increase the processing throughput to keep up with the high event\nrate. Results obtained during the first months of 2016 NA62 run are presented\nand discussed.\n", "  This article explores the Conformal Ricci Collineations (CRCs) for the\nplane-symmetric static spacetime. The non-linear coupled CRC equations are\nsolved to get the general form of conformal Ricci symmetries. In the\nnon-degenerate case, it turns out that the dimension of the Lie algebra of CRCs\nis finite. In the case were the Ricci tensor is degenerate, it found that the\nalgebra of CRCs for the plane-symmetric static spacetime is mostly, but not\nalways, infinite dimensional. In one case of degenerate Ricci tensor, we solved\nthe differential constraints completely and a spacetime metric is obtained\nalong with CRCs. We found ten possible cases of finite and infinite dimensional\nLie algebras of CRCs for the considered spacetime.\n", "  In complex materials, numerous intertwined phenomena underlie the overall\nresponse at macroscale. These phenomena can pertain to different engineering\nfields (mechanical , chemical, electrical), occur at different scales, can\nappear as uncertain, and are nonlinear. Interacting with complex materials thus\ncalls for developing nonlinear computational approaches where multi-scale\ntechniques that grasp key phenomena at the relevant scale need to be mingled\nwith stochastic methods accounting for uncertainties. In this chapter, we\ndevelop such a computational approach for modeling the mechanical response of a\nrepresentative volume of concrete in uniaxial cyclic loading. A mesoscale is\ndefined such that it represents an equivalent heterogeneous medium: nonlinear\nlocal response is modeled in the framework of Thermodynamics with Internal\nVariables; spatial variability of the local response is represented by\ncorrelated random vector fields generated with the Spectral Representation\nMethod. Macroscale response is recovered through standard ho-mogenization\nprocedure from Micromechanics and shows salient features of the uniaxial cyclic\nresponse of concrete that are not explicitly modeled at mesoscale.\n", "  We present a virtual ionic crystal (VIC) method to calculate energies of\ncharged point defects on surfaces. No artificial charge but an actual\nzero-dimensional (0D) species is introduced to charge a defect. Effect of\ndielectric substrate on lattice energy is depressed through suitable\nconfiguration of the unit cell. The lattice energy approximates to Madelung\nenergy with defect and 0D species considered as point charges in vacuum. Energy\nrequired to charge the defect is derived from charge quantity on the defect in\nVIC, energy of unit cell, and energy required to charge the 0D species.\n", "  This manuscript is inspired by the paper [2]. In the paper, they investigate\na method to detect existence of an object with arbitrarily small interaction.\nBelow, we sketch their protocol to motivate the present manuscript. The object\nof their protocol is to detect whether the given blackbox interact with input\nstates or not, with negligible distortion of the blackbox, and high detection\nprobability. In this paper, we do two things. First, we prove the above\nmentioned protocol is optimal in a certain setting. The main tool here is\nadversary method, a classical method in query complexity. Second, we present a\nprotocol to detect unitary operations with negligible error and no distortion\nof the input at all.\n", "  In this paper, we analyse a Vector Penalty Projection Scheme (see [1]) to\ntreat the displacement of a moving body in incompressible viscous flows in the\ncase where the interaction of the fluid on the body can be neglected. The\npresence of the obstacle inside the computational domain is treated with a\npenalization method introducing a parameter $\\eta$. We show the stability of\nthe scheme and that the pressure and velocity converge towards a limit when the\npenalty parameter $\\epsilon$, which induces a small divergence and the time\nstep $\\delta$t tend to zero with a proportionality constraint $\\epsilon$ =\n$\\lambda$$\\delta$t. Finally, when $\\eta$ goes to 0, we show that the problem\nadmits a weak limit which is a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations\nwith no-sleep condition on the solid boundary. R{\\'e}sum{\\'e} Dans ce travail\nnous analysons un sch{\\'e}ma de projection vectorielle (voir [1]) pour traiter\nle d{\\'e}placement d'un corps solide dans un fluide visqueux incompressible\ndans le cas o` u l'interaction du fluide sur le solide est n{\\'e}gligeable.

The emission of\nCr-doped quantum dots and their evolution in magnetic field reveal a large\nmagnetic anisotropy of the Cr spin induced by local strain. This results in the\nzero field splitting of the 0, +-1 and +-2 Cr spin states and in a\nthermalization on the magnetic ground states 0 and +-1. The observed strong\nspin to strain coupling of Cr is of particular interest for the development of\nhybrid spin-mechanical devices where coherent mechanical driving of an\nindividual spin in an oscillator is needed. The magneto-optical properties of\nCr-doped quantum dots are modelled by a spin Hamiltonian including the\nsensitivity of the Cr spin to the strain and the influence of the quantum dot\nsymmetry on the carrier-Cr spin coupling.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically investigate the displacement and momentum\nfluctuations spectra of the movable mirror in a standard optomechanical system\ndriven by a finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum light accompanying a coherent\nlaser field. Two cases in which the squeezed vacuum is generated by degenerated\nand non-degenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We\nfind that for the case of finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection, the two\nspectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband\nsqueezing excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a\nfour-peaked structure, respectively, for the squeezing injection from DPO and\nNDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as\nsqueezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be\nhighly sensitive to the squeezing parameters and the temperature of the mirror.\nWe also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum\nquadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the squeezing\nparameters of the input field on the mechanical squeezing. It will be shown\nthat the parameters of driven squeezed vacuum affects the squeezing. We find\nthe optimal mechanical squeezing is achievable via finite bandwidth squeezed\nvacuum injection which is affected by the intensity of squeezed vacuum. We also\nshow that the phase of incident squeezed vacuum determines whether position or\nmomentum squeezing occurs. Our proposed scheme not only provides a feasible\nexperimental method to detect and characterize squeezed light by optomechanical\nsystems, but also suggests a way for controllable transfer of squeezing from an\noptical field to a mechanical oscillator.\n", "  The so-called Maryland model is a linear version of the quantum kicked rotor;\nit exhibits Anderson localization in momentum space. By turning the kicks into\na Markovian stochastic process, the dynamics becomes a dissipative quantum\nprocess described by a discrete family of completely positive maps that allows\nto explicitly study the relation between divisibility of the maps and the\ndegree of memory of the process.\n", "  In this paper we present a simulator allowing to perform policy experiments\nrelative to the air traffic management. Different SESAR solutions can be\nimplemented in the model to see the reaction of the different stakeholders as\nwell as other relevant metrics (delays, safety, etc). The model describes both\nthe strategic phase associated to the planning of the flight trajectories and\nthe tactical modifications occurring in the en-route phase. An implementation\nof the model is available as open-source and freely accessible by any user.\n  More specifically, different procedures related to business trajectories and\nfree-routing are tested and we illustrate the capabilities of the model on\nairspace implementing these concepts. After performing numerical simulations\nwith the model, we show that in a free-routing scenario the controllers perform\nless operations although they are dispersed over a larger portion of the\nairspace. This can potentially increase the complexity of conflict detection\nand resolution for controllers.\n  In order to investigate this specific aspect, we consider some metrics used\nto measure traffic complexity. We first show that in non-free-routing\nsituations our simulator deals with complexity in a way similar to what humans\nwould do. This allows us to be confident that the results of our numerical\nsimulations relative to the free-routing can reasonably forecast how human\ncontrollers would behave in this new situation. Specifically, our numerical\nsimulations show that most of the complexity metrics decrease with\nfree-routing, while the few metrics which increase are all linked to the flight\nlevel changes. This is a non-trivial result since intuitively the complexity\nshould increase with free-routing because of problematic geometries and more\ndispersed conflicts over the airspace.\n", "  We present an alternate origin scenario to explain the observed phenomena of\n(1) counter-rotation between different galaxy components and (2) the formation\nof ring galaxies. We suggest that these are direct consequences of the galaxy\nbeing acted upon by a torque which causes a change in its primordial spin\nangular momentum first observed as changes in the gas kinematics or\ndistribution. We suggest that this torque is exerted by the gravitational force\nbetween nearby galaxies. This origin requires the presence of at least one\ncompanion galaxy in the vicinity - we find a companion galaxy within 750 kpc\nfor 51/57 counter-rotating galaxies and literature indicates that all ring\ngalaxies have a companion galaxy thus giving observable credence to this\norigin. Moreover in these 51 galaxies, we find a kinematic offset between\nstellar and gas heliocentric velocities $>50$ kms$^{-1}$ for several galaxies\nif the separation between the galaxies $<$ 100 kpc. This, we suggest, indicates\na change in the orbital angular momentum of the torqued galaxies. A major\ndifference between the torque origin suggested here and the existing model of\ngas accretion/galaxy collision, generally used to explain the above two\nphenomena, is that the torque acts on the matter of the same galaxy whereas in\nthe latter case gas, with different properties, is brought in from outside. An\nimportant implication of our study is that mutual gravity torques acting on the\ngalaxy can explain the formation of warps, polar ring galaxies and lenticular\ngalaxies. We conclude that mutual gravity torques play an important role in the\ndynamical evolution of galaxies and that they naturally explain several galaxy\nobservables.\n", "  In this paper we describe the performance of a light detector for Ar\nscintillation light made of wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers connected to\nSilicon-Photomultipliers (SiPM). The setup was conceived to be used as\nanti-Compton veto for high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors operated directly\nin liquid Argon (LAr). Background suppression efficiencies for different\nradioactive sources were measured in a test cryostat with about 800 kg LAr.\nThis work was part of the R\\&D effort for the GERDA experiment.\n", "  The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part the low-energy limit\nof quantum gravity is analysed, whereas in the second we deal with the\nhigh-energy domain. In the first part, by applying the effective field theory\npoint of view to the quantization of general relativity, detectable, though\ntiny, quantum effects in the position of Newtonian Lagrangian points of the\nEarth-Moon system are found. In order to make more realistic the quantum\ncorrected model proposed, the full three-body problem where the Earth and the\nMoon interact with a generic massive body and the restricted four-body problem\ninvolving the perturbative effects produced by the gravitational presence of\nthe Sun in the Earth-Moon system are also studied. After that, a new quantum\ntheory having general relativity as its classical counterpart is analysed. By\nexploiting this framework, an innovative interesting prediction involving the\nposition of Lagrangian points within the context of general relativity is\ndescribed. Furthermore, the new pattern provides quantum corrections to the\nrelativistic coordinates of Earth-Moon libration points of the order of few\nmillimetres. The second part of the thesis deals with the Riemannian curvature\ncharacterizing the boosted form assumed by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric.\nThe analysis of the Kretschmann invariant and the geodesic equation shows that\nthe spacetime possesses a \"scalar curvature singularity\" within a 3-sphere and\nthat it is possible to define what we here call \"boosted horizon\", a sort of\nelastic wall where all particles are surprisingly pushed away, suggesting that\nsuch \"boosted geometries\" are ruled by a sort of \"antigravity effect\".\nEventually, the equivalence with the coordinate shift method is invoked in\norder to demonstrate that all $\\delta^2$ terms appearing in the Riemann\ncurvature tensor give vanishing contribution in distributional sense.\n", "  We investigate the current-induced spin-orbit torque in antiferromangnetic\nmaterials in the presence of Rashba spin orbit coupling using both the linear\nresponse theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique implemented\non a tight-binding model. We show that a staggered spin density arises from\ninterband contributions. The effect of the disorder is restricted to the\ndiminution of the torque magnitude and does not bring any anomalous behavior to\nthe dependences of the torque on the spin orbit strength and the exchange\ninteraction between the antiferromagnetic local moments and the itinerant\nelectrons spins. We prove that the spin orbit torque is robust against the\napplication of the disorder compared to the case of the antiferromagnetic\nspin-valve spin transfer torque.\n", "  The article discusses the demarcation problem; how to distinguish between\nscience and pseudoscience. It then examines the string theory under various\ndemarcation criteria to conclude that string theory cannot be considered as\nscience.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmological explosions which carry valuable\ninformation from the distant past of the expanding universe. One of the\ngreatest discoveries in modern cosmology is the finding of the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe using Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) as standard candles.\nHowever, due to the interstellar extinction SN Ia can be seen only up to a\nredshift $z\\sim 1.5$. GRBs are considered as the potential alternative to push\nthis limit to as high as $z\\sim 10$, a redshift regime corresponding to an\nepoch when the universe just started to form the first structures. There exist\nseveral correlations between the energy and an observable of a GRB which can be\nused to derive luminosity distance. In recent works, we have studied spectral\nevolution within the individual pulses and obtained such correlations within\nthe pulses. Here we summarize our results of the pulse-wise GRB correlation\nstudy. It is worth mentioning that all GRB correlations are still empirical,\nand we cannot use them in cosmology unless we understand the basic physics of\nGRBs. To this end, we need to investigate the prompt emission spectrum which is\nso far generally described by the empirical Band function. We shall discuss our\ncurrent understanding of the radiation process particularly the finding of two\nblackbodies and a powerlaw (the 2BBPL model) as the generic spectral model and\nits implication. This is a work in progress and we expect to obtain the most\nfundamental GRB correlation based on our improved spectral model.\n", "  On the base of more general model we assessed accuracy of method that is\nwidely used for post- tuning accelerator sections. Our consideration has shown\nthat for wide range of disk loaded waveguide (DLW) parameters using simple\ntuning coefficients gives appropriate characteristics of DLWs. For injector\nsections, in which phase velocity and amplitude change, there are some\ndeviation from the desired characteristics. It is necessary to evaluate the\ninfluence of additional phase shift on beam characteristics at the injector\nexit.\n", "  The adhesion of cell membranes is mediated by the binding of\nmembrane-anchored receptor and ligand proteins. In this article, we review\nrecent results from simulations and theory that lead to novel insights on how\nthe binding equilibrium and kinetics of these proteins is affected by the\nmembranes and by the membrane anchoring and molecular properties of the\nproteins. Simulations and theory both indicate that the binding equilibrium\nconstant K2D and the on- and off-rate constants of anchored receptors and\nligands in their 'two-dimensional' (2D) membrane environment strongly depend on\nthe membrane roughness from thermally excited shape fluctuations on nanoscales.\nRecent theory corroborated by simulations provides a general relation between\nK2D} and the binding constant K3D of soluble variants of the receptors and\nligands that lack the membrane anchors and are free to diffuse in three\ndimensions (3D).\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of magnetized plasma\nthat may cause severe geomagnetic storms if Earth-directed. Here we report a\nrare instance with comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observa- tions of a\nCME combining white-light, radio, and plasma measurements from four different\nvantage points. For the first time, we have successfully applied a radio\ndirection-finding technique to an interplanetary type II burst detected by two\nidentical widely separated radio receivers. The derived locations of the type\nII and type III bursts are in general agreement with the white light CME recon-\nstruction. We find that the radio emission arises from the flanks of the CME,\nand are most likely associated with the CME-driven shock. Our work demon-\nstrates the complementarity between radio triangulation and 3D reconstruction\ntechniques for space weather applications.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of the\nwall temperature on the behavior of oblique shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer\ninteractions at freestream Mach number $2.28$ and shock angle of the wedge\ngenerator $\\varphi = 8^{\\circ}$. Five values of the\nwall-to-recovery-temperature ratio ($T_w/T_r$) are considered, corresponding to\ncold, adiabatic and hot wall thermal conditions. We show that the main effect\nof cooling is to decrease the characteristic scales of the interaction in terms\nof upstream influence and extent of the separation bubble. The opposite\nbehavior is observed in the case of heating, that produces a marked dilatation\nof the interaction region. The distribution of the Stanton number shows that a\nstrong amplification of the heat transfer occurs across the interaction, and\nthe maximum values of thermal and dynamic loads are found in the case of cold\nwall. The analysis reveals that the fluctuating heat flux exhibits a strong\nintermittent behavior, characterized by scattered spots with extremely high\nvalues compared to the mean. Furthermore, the analogy between momentum and heat\ntransfer, typical of compressible, wall-bounded, equilibrium turbulent flows\ndoes not apply for most part of the interaction domain. The pre-multiplied\nspectra of the wall heat flux do not show any evidence of the influence of the\nlow-frequency shock motion, and the primary mechanism for the generation of\npeak heating is found to be linked with the turbulence amplification in the\ninteraction region.\n", "  Topological protection allows robust transport of localized phenomena such as\nquantum information, solitons, and dislocations. The transport can be either\ndissipative or non-dissipative. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and\ntheoretically explain the topologically protected dissipative motion of\ncolloidal particles above a periodic hexagonal magnetic pattern. By driving the\nsystem with periodic modulation loops of an external and spatially homogeneous\nmagnetic field, we achieve total control over the motion of diamagnetic and\nparamagnetic colloids. We can transport simultaneously and independently each\ntype of colloid along any of the six crystallographic directions of the pattern\nvia adiabatic or deterministic ratchet motion. Both types of motion are\ntopologically protected. As an application, we implement an automatic\ntopologically protected quality control of a chemical reaction between\nfunctionalized colloids. Our results are relevant to other systems with the\nsame symmetry.\n", "  In this note we present some results concerning photon blockade and\nantibunching in a system consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity.\nWe give analytic conditions for resonant and non-resonant photon blockade,\nvalid for small values of the external pump amplitude. Starting from these\nresults, we discuss the quantum states characteristics of the system within a\nmaster equation formalism and highlight quantities like stationary second order\ncorrelations both static and dynamic and one-photon purity.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown by Lobo, Parsaei and Riazi (LPR) that phantom\nenergy with $\\omega =p_{r}/\\rho <-1$ could support phantom wormholes. Several\nclasses of such solutions have been derived by them. While the inner spacetime\nis represented by asymptotically flat phantom wormhole that have repulsive\ngravity, it is most likely to be unstable to perturbations. Hence, we consider\na situation, where a phantom wormhole is somehow trapped inside a Schwarzschild\nsphere across a thin shell. Applying the method developed by Garcia, Lobo and\nVisser (GLV), we shall exemplify that the shell can possess zones of stability\ndepending on certain constraints. It turns out that zones corresponding to\n\"force\" constraint are more restrictive than those from the \"mass\" constraint.\nWe shall also enumerate the interior energy content by using the gravitational\nenergy integral proposed by Lynden-Bell, Katz and Bi% \\v{c}\\'ak. It turns out\nthat, even though the interior mass is positive, the integral implies repulsive\nenergy. This is consistent with the phantom nature of interior matter.\n", "  We consider an extension of Weyl geometry with the most general connection\nlinearly determined by a vector field. We discuss some of the geometrical\nproperties within this framework and then we construct gravitational theories\nleading to an interesting class of vector-tensor theories with cosmological\napplications.\n", "  One of the simplest multilevel cellular automata - the hodgepodge machine -\nwas modified to best match the chemical trajectory observed in the\nBelousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Noise introduces watersheding of the central\nregular pattern into the circular target pattern. This article analyzes\ninfluences of the neighborhood and internal excitation kinds of noise. We have\nfound that configurations of ignition points, which give circular waves -\ntarget patterns, occur only in the interval of the neighborhood excitation\nnoise from 30% to 34% and at the internal excitation noise of 12%. Noisy\nhodgepodge machine with these parameters is the best approximation to the\nexperimental Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.\n", "  A combination of experiments and extensive modelling, including a chemical\nkinetics analysis, was performed for a CO$_2$/H$_2$O plasma in a dielectric\nbarrier discharge. This provides a better understanding of the mechanisms\nrelated to the reactivity of the plasma and of the conversions into value-added\nproducts, such as methanol.\n", "  This paper proposes a new method to analyze the spatial structure of urban\nsystems using ideas from fractals. Regarding a system of cities as a set of\n\"particles\" distributed randomly on a triangular lattice, we construct a\nspatial correlation function of cities. Suppose that the spatial correlation\nfollows the power law. It can be proved that the correlation exponent is the\nsecond order generalized dimension. The spatial correlation model is applied to\nthe system of cities in China. The results show that the Chinese urban system\ncan be described by the correlation dimension ranging from 1.3 to 1.6. The\nfractality of self-organized network of cities in both the conventional\ngeographic space and the \"time\" space is revealed with the empirical evidence.\nThe spatial correlation analysis is significant in that it is applicable to\nboth large and small sizes of samples and can be used to link different fractal\ndimensions in urban study, including box dimension and radial dimension.\n", "  Urban population density always follows the exponential distribution and can\nbe described with Clark's model. Because of this, the spatial distribution of\nurban population used to be regarded as non-fractal pattern. However, Clark's\nmodel differs from the exponential function in mathematics because that urban\npopulation is distributed on the fractal support of landform and land-use form.\nBy using mathematical transform and empirical evidence, we argue that there are\nself-affine scaling relations and local power laws behind the exponential\ndistribution of urban density. The scale parameter of Clark's model indicating\nthe characteristic radius of cities is not a real constant, but depends on the\nurban field we defined. So the exponential model suggests local fractal\nstructure with two kinds of fractal parameters. The parameters can be used to\ncharacterize urban space filling, spatial correlation, self-affine properties,\nand self-organized evolution. The case study of the city of Hangzhou, China, is\nemployed to verify the theoretical inference. Based on the empirical analysis,\na three-ring model of cities is presented and a city is conceptually divided\ninto three layers from core to periphery. The scaling region and non-scaling\nregion appear alternately in the city. This model may be helpful for future\nurban studies and city planning.\n", "  The general scheme of power installations based on nuclear reactions of\nfission and synthesis activated by external sources is analyzed. The external\nactivation makes possible to support nuclear reactions at temperatures and\npressures lower than needed for chain reactions, so simplifies considerably\npractical realization of power installations. The possibility of operation on\nsubcritical masses allows making installations compact and safe at emergency\nsituations. Installations are suitable for transmutation of radioactive\nnuclides, what solves the problem of utilization of nuclear waste products. It\nis proposed and considered schemes of power installations based on nuclear\nreactions of fission and fusion, activated by external sources, different from\nADS systems. Variants of activation of nuclear reactions of fission (U-235,\n238, Pu-239) and fusion (Li-6,7, B-10,11) are considered.\n", "  We present large-scale submm observations towards the Sgr A Complex covering\n~300 arcmin2. These data were obtained in the frame of the HEXGAL Program with\nthe Herschel-HIFI satellite and are complemented with submm observations\nobtained with the NANTEN2/SMART telescope as part of the NANTEN2/SMART Central\nNuclear Zone Survey. The observed species are CO(4-3) observed with the\nNANTEN2/SMART telescope, and [CI](1-0), [CI](2-1), [NII](1-0), and\n[CII](3/2-1/2) observed with the Herschel-HIFI satellite. The observations are\npresented in a 1 km/s spectral resolution and a spatial resolution ranging from\n46\" to 28\". The spectral coverage of the three lower frequency lines is +-200\nkm/s, while in the two high frequency lines, the upper LSR velocity limit is\n+94 km/s and +145 km/s for the [NII] and [CII] lines, respectively. The spatial\ndistribution of the emission in all lines is very widespread. The bulk of the\nCO emission is found towards Galactic latitudes below the Galactic plane, and\nall the known molecular clouds are identified. Both neutral atomic carbon lines\nhave their brightest emission associated with the +50 km/s cloud. Their spatial\ndistribution at this LSR velocity describes a crescent-shape structure, which\nis probably the result of interaction with the energetic event (one or several\nsupernovae explosions) that gave origin to the non-thermal Sgr A-East source.\nThe [CII] and [NII] emissions have most of their flux associated with the\nthermal Arched-Filaments and the H Region and bright spots in [CII] emission\ntowards the Central Nuclear Disk (CND) are detected. Warm Gas at very high\n(|Vlsr| > 100 km/s) LSR velocities is also detected towards the line of sight\nto the Sgr A Complex, and it is most probably located outside the region, in\nthe X1 orbits.\n", "  Distributions of transverse kinematic imbalance in neutrino-nucleus\ninteractions in the few GeV regime are sensitive to nuclear effects. We present\na study comparing the latest predictions of transverse kinematic imbalance from\nthe interaction simulations, NuWro and GENIE. We dis- cuss the differences\nbetween the model predictions.\n", "  Graph generators learn a model from a source graph in order to generate a new\ngraph that has many of the same properties. The learned models each have\nimplicit and explicit biases built in, and its important to understand the\nassumptions that are made when generating a new graph. Of course, the\ndifferences between the new graph and the original graph, as compared by any\nnumber of graph properties, are important indicators of the biases inherent in\nany modelling task. But these critical differences are subtle and not\nimmediately apparent using standard performance metrics. Therefore, we\nintroduce the infinity mirror test for the analysis of graph generator\nperformance and robustness. This stress test operates by repeatedly,\nrecursively fitting a model to itself. A perfect graph generator would have no\ndeviation from the original or ideal graph, however the implicit biases and\nassumptions that are cooked into the various models are exaggerated by the\ninfinity mirror test allowing for new insights that were not available before.\nWe show, via hundreds of experiments on 6 real world graphs, that several\ncommon graph generators do degenerate in interesting and informative ways. We\nbelieve that the observed degenerative patterns are clues to future development\nof better graph models.\n", "  This report uses a few well documented cases of Ball Lightning (or BL for\nshort) observations to demonstrate a correlation between BL and positive\nlightning, especially strong positive lightning. This allows to draw\nconclusions and predictions about future BL observations and the pro- duction\nof these objects in the laboratory. Contrary to many current BL theories, these\nobjects can be created without direct contact to a lightning channel. Very high\nelectric fields appear to be essential for the creation, together with the\nproper temporal structure of the field. So far no experiments have been\nperformed along the ideas presented in this report.\n", "  With the increasing size and complexity of data produced by large scale\nnumerical simulations, it is of primary importance for scientists to be able to\nexploit all available hardware in heterogenous High Performance Computing\nenvironments for increased throughput and efficiency. We focus on the porting\nand optimization of Splotch, a scalable visualization algorithm, to utilize the\nXeon Phi, Intel's coprocessor based upon the new Many Integrated Core\narchitecture. We discuss steps taken to offload data to the coprocessor and\nalgorithmic modifications to aid faster processing on the many-core\narchitecture and make use of the uniquely wide vector capabilities of the\ndevice, with accompanying performance results using multiple Xeon Phi. Finally\nperformance is compared against results achieved with the GPU implementation of\nSplotch.\n", "  Recently, in [Class. Quantum Grav. 33 (2016) 045005], the authors proposed a\nnew approach extending the framework of statistical mechanics to\nreparametrization-invariant systems with no additional gauges. In this work,\nthe approach is generalized to systems defined by more than one Hamiltonian\nconstraints (multi-fingered time). We show how well known features as the\nEhrenfest- Tolman effect and the J\\\"uttner distribution for the relativistic\ngas can be consistently recovered from a covariant approach in the\nmulti-fingered framework. Eventually, the crucial role played by the\ninteraction in the definition of a global notion of equilibrium is discussed.\n", "  To fully deploy the potential of semiconductor nanocrystal films as low-cost\nelectronic materials, a better understanding of the amount of dopants required\nto make their conductivity metallic is needed. In bulk semiconductors, the\ncritical concentration of electrons at the metal-insulator transition is\ndescribed by the Mott criterion. Here, we theoretically derive the critical\nconcentration $n_c$ for films of heavily doped nanocrystals devoid of ligands\nat their surface and in direct contact with each other. In the accompanying\nexperiments, we investigate the conduction mechanism in films of\nphosphorus-doped, ligand-free silicon nanocrystals. At the largest electron\nconcentration achieved in our samples, which is half the predicted $n_c$, we\nfind that the localization length of hopping electrons is close to three times\nthe nanocrystals diameter, indicating that the film approaches the\nmetal-insulator transition.\n", "  In the Kuramoto model of globally coupled oscillators, partially locked\nstates (PLS) are stationary solutions that incorporate the emergence of partial\nsynchrony when the interaction strength increases. While PLS have long been\nconsidered, existing results on their stability are limited to neutral\nstability of the linearized dynamics in strong topology, or to specific\ninvariant subspaces (obtained via the so-called Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz) with\nspecific frequency distributions for the oscillators. In the mean field limit,\nthe Kuramoto model shows various ingredients of the Landau damping mechanism in\nthe Vlasov equation. This analogy has been a source of inspiration for\nstability proofs of regular Kuramoto equilibria. Besides, the major\nmathematical issue with PLS asymptotic stability is that these states consist\nof heterogeneous and singular measures. Here, we establish an explicit\ncriterion for their spectral stability and we prove their local asymptotic\nstability in weak topology, for a large class of analytic frequency marginals.\nThe proof strongly relies on a suitable functional space that contains (Fourier\ntransforms of) singular measures, and for which the linearized dynamics is well\nunder control. For illustration, the stability criterion is evaluated in some\nstandard examples. We show in particular that no loss of generality results in\nassuming the OA ansatz. To our best knowledge, our result provides the first\nproof of Landau damping to heterogeneous and irregular equilibria, in absence\nof dissipation.\n", "  Fabricating an electrically switchable cylindrical Fresnel lens based on\nholographic polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (H-PDLC) using a Michelson\ninterferometer is reported. Simplicity of the method and possibility of\nfabricating different focal length lenses in a single set up are among the\nadvantages of the method. It is demonstrated that the Fresnel structured zone\nplate acts as a cylindrical lens and focuses light in one dimension. Its\nelectro-optical switching properties are also studied and it is found that at\nan applied electric field of E=6 Vrms/{\\mu}m across the sample, focusing\nproperty of the sample eliminates with a response of about 1 ms in a reversible\nmanner.\n", "  We discuss a self-consistent scheme for treating the optical response of\nlarge, hybrid networks of semiconducting quantum dots (SQDs) and plasmonic\nmetallic nanoparticles (MNPs). Our method is efficient and scalable and becomes\nexact in the limiting case of weakly interacting SQDs. The self-consistent\nequations obtained for the steady state are analogous to the von Neumann\nequations of motion for the density matrix of a SQD placed in an effective\nelectric field computed within the discrete dipole approximation. Illustrative\napplications of the theory to square and honeycomb SQD, MNP, and hybrid SDQ-MNP\nlattices as well as SQD-MNP dimers are presented. Our results demonstrate that\nhybrid SQD-MNP lattices can provide flexible platforms for light manipulation\nwith tunable resonant characteristics.\n", "  We develop a computationally inexpensive model to examine the dynamics of\nboson-assisted electron relaxation in solids, studying nonequilibrium dynamics\nin a metal, in a nodal superconductor with a stationary density of states, and\nin a nodal superconductor where the gap dynamically opens. In the metallic\nsystem, the electron population resembles a thermal population at all times,\nbut the presence of even a fixed nodal gap both invalidates a purely thermal\ntreatment and sharply curtails relaxation rates. For a gap that is allowed to\nopen as electron relaxation proceeds, effects are even more pronounced, and gap\ndynamics become coupled to the dynamics of the electron population. Comparisons\nto experiments reveal that phase-space restrictions in the presence of a gap\nare likely to play a significant role in the widespread observation of\ncoexisting femtosecond and picosecond dynamics in the cuprate high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Superconductivity in cuprates peaks in the doping regime between a metal at\nhigh p and an insulator at low p. Understanding how the material evolves from\nmetal to insulator is a fundamental and open question. Early studies in high\nmagnetic fields revealed that below some critical doping an insulator-like\nupturn appears in the resistivity of cuprates at low temperature, but its\norigin has remained a puzzle. Here we propose that this 'metal-to-insulator\ncrossover' is due to a drop in carrier density n associated with the onset of\nthe pseudogap phase at a critical doping p*. We use high-field resistivity\nmeasurements on LSCO to show that the upturns are quantitatively consistent\nwith a drop from n=1+p above p* to n=p below p*, in agreement with high-field\nHall data in YBCO. We demonstrate how previously reported upturns in the\nresistivity of LSCO, YBCO and Nd-LSCO are explained by the same universal\nmechanism: a drop in carrier density by 1.0 hole per Cu atom.\n", "  In this paper we present photometric CCD observations of the globular cluster\nNGC 6093 (M80) in filters B, V , R and I. We produce the colour-magnitude\ndiagrams for this object and obtain values for its metallicity [Fe/H],\nreddening E(V-B), E(V-I) and distance modulus (m - M)_0.\n", "  The nature of the relationship between low-level supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) activity and galactic cold gas, if any, is currently unclear. Here, we\ntest whether central black holes may feed at higher rates in gas-rich galaxies,\nprobing SMBH activity well below the active regime down to Eddington ratios of\n~1e-7. We use a combination of radio data from the ALFALFA survey and from the\nliterature, along with archival X-ray flux measurements from the Chandra X-ray\nobservatory, to investigate this potential relationship. We construct a sample\nof 129 late-type galaxies, with MB<-18 out to 50 Mpc, that have both HI masses\nand sensitive X-ray coverage. Of these, 75 host a nuclear X-ray source, a 58%\ndetection fraction. There is a highly significant correlation between nuclear\nX-ray luminosity LX and galaxy stellar mass Mstar with a slope of 1.7+/-0.3,\nand a tentative correlation (significant at the 2.8 sigma level) between LX and\nHI gas mass MHI. However, a joint fit to LX as a function of both Mstar and MHI\nfinds no significant dependence on MHI (slope 0.1+/00.3), and similarly the\nresiduals of LX-LX(Mstar) show no trend with MHI; the apparent correlation\nbetween LX and MHI seems to be entirely driven by Mstar. We demonstrate\nquantitatively that these results are robust against X-ray binary\ncontamination. We conclude that the galaxy-wide cold gas content in these\nspirals does not strongly correlate with their low-level supermassive black\nhole activity, and suggest fueling is a localized process.\n", "  Finite Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebras are diagram-algebra quotients of (the\ngroup algebra of) the famous Artin's braid group $B_N$, while the affine TL\nalgebras arise as diagram algebras from a generalized version of the braid\ngroup. We study asymptotic `$N\\to\\infty$' representation theory of these\nquotients (parametrized by $q\\in\\mathbb{C}^{\\times}$) from a perspective of\nbraided monoidal categories. Using certain idempotent subalgebras in the finite\nand affine algebras, we construct infinite `arc' towers of the diagram algebras\nand the corresponding direct system of representation categories, with terms\nlabeled by $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$. The corresponding direct-limit category is our\nmain object of studies.\n  For the case of the finite TL algebras, we prove that the direct-limit\ncategory is abelian and highest-weight at any $q$ and endowed with braided\nmonoidal structure. The most interesting result is when $q$ is a root of unity\nwhere the representation theory is non-semisimple. The resulting braided\nmonoidal categories we obtain at different roots of unity are new and\ninterestingly they are not rigid. We observe then a fundamental relation of\nthese categories to a certain representation category of the Virasoro algebra\nand give a conjecture on the existence of a braided monoidal equivalence\nbetween the categories. This should have powerful applications to the study of\nthe `continuum' limit of critical statistical mechanics systems based on the TL\nalgebra.\n  We also introduce a novel class of embeddings for the affine Temperley-Lieb\nalgebras and related new concept of fusion or bilinear $\\mathbb{N}$-graded\ntensor product of modules for these algebras. We prove that the fusion rules\nare stable with the index $N$ of the tower and prove that the corresponding\ndirect-limit category is endowed with an associative tensor product. We also\nstudy the braiding properties of this affine TL fusion.\n", "  We report a facile and novel method for the fabrication of Cu2O@PNIPAM\ncore-shell nanoreactors using Cu2O nanocubes as the core. The PNIPAM shell not\nonly effectively protects the Cu2O nanocubes from oxidation, but also improves\nthe colloidal stability of the system. The Cu2O@PNIPAM core-shell microgels can\nwork efficiently as photocatalyst for the decomposition of methyl orange under\nvisible light. A significant enhancement in the catalytic activity has been\nobserved for the core-shell microgels compared with the pure Cu2O nanocubes.\nMost importantly, the photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O nanocubes can be\nfurther tuned by the thermosensitive PNIPAM shell, as rationalized by our\nrecent theory.\n", "  We report the discovery of two new transiting extrasolar planets orbiting\nmoderately bright (V = 10.7 and 12.2 mag) F stars (masses of 1.39 Msun and 1.10\nMsun, respectively). The planets have periods of P = 4.7322 d and 4.4087 d, and\nmasses of 0.21 MJ and 0.17 MJ which are almost half-way between those of\nNeptune and Saturn. With radii of 1.31 RJ and 1.13 RJ, these very low density\nplanets are the two lowest mass planets with radii in excess that of Jupiter.\nComparing with other recent planet discoveries, we find that sub-Saturns\n(0.18MJ < Mp < 0.3MJ) and super-Neptunes (0.05MJ < Mp < 0.18MJ) exhibit a wide\nrange of radii, and their radii exhibit a weaker correlation with irradiation\nthan higher mass planets. The two planets are both suitable for measuring the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect and for atmospheric characterization. Measuring the\nformer effect would allow an interesting test of the theory that star-planet\ntidal interactions are responsible for the tendency of close-in giant planets\naround convective envelope stars to be on low obliquity orbits. Both planets\nfall on the edge of the short period Neptunian desert in the semi-major\naxis-mass plane.\n", "  We explore connections between surficial deltaic processes (e.g. avulsion,\ndeposition) and the stratigraphic record using a simple numerical model of\ndelta-plain evolution, with the aim of constraining these connections and thus\nimproving prediction of subsurface features. The model represents channel\ndynamics using a simple but flexible cellular approach, and is unique in that\nit explicitly includes backwater effects that are known to be important in\nlow-gradient channel networks. The patterns of channel deposits in the\nstratigraphic record vary spatially due to variation in avulsion statistics\nwith radial distance from the delta's source of water and sediment. We\nintroduce channel residence time as an important statistical measure of the\nsurface channel kinematics. The model suggests that the mean channel residence\ntime anywhere within the delta is nicely described by a power law distribution\nshowing a cutoff that depends on radial distance. Thicknesses of channel\ndeposits are not uniquely determined by the residence time of channelization.\nThe channel residence time distributions at given radial distances from the\nsource are found to be approximately lognormally distributed, a finding\nconsistent with the scale-dependent radial structure of channel deposits in the\nstratigraphic record.\n", "  Mega-pixel charge-integrating detectors are common in near-IR imaging\napplications. Optimal signal-to-noise ratio estimates of the photocurrents,\nwhich are particularly important in the low-signal regime, are produced by\nfitting linear models to sequential reads of the charge on the detector.\nAlgorithms that solve this problem have a long history, but can be\ncomputationally intensive. Furthermore, the cosmic ray background is\nappreciable for these detectors in Earth orbit, particularly above the Earth's\nmagnetic poles and the South Atlantic Anomaly, and on-board reduction routines\nmust be capable of flagging affected pixels. In this paper we present an\nalgorithm that generates optimal photocurrent estimates and flags random\ntransient charge generation from cosmic rays, and is specifically designed to\nfit on a computationally restricted platform. We take as a case study the\nSpectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and\nIces Explorer (SPHEREx), a NASA Small Explorer astrophysics experiment concept,\nand show that the algorithm can easily fit in the resource-constrained\nenvironment of such a restricted platform. Detailed simulations of the input\nastrophysical signals and detector array performance are used to characterize\nthe fitting routines in the presence of complex noise properties and charge\ntransients. We use both Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera-3 and\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to develop an empirical understanding of\nthe susceptibility of near-IR detectors in low earth orbit and build a model\nfor realistic cosmic ray energy spectra and rates. We show that our algorithm\ngenerates an unbiased estimate of the true photocurrent that is identical to\nthat from a standard line fitting package, and characterize the rate, energy,\nand timing of both detected and undetected transient events.\n", "  Imaging of a weak target hidden behind a scattering medium can be\nsignificantly confounded by glare. We report a method, termed coherence gated\nnegation (CGN), that uses destructive optical interference to suppress glare\nand allow improved imaging of a weak target. As a demonstration, we show that\nby permuting through a set range of amplitude and phase values for a reference\nbeam interfering with the optical field from the glare and target reflection,\nwe can suppress glare by an order of magnitude, even when the optical wavefront\nis highly disordered. This strategy significantly departs from conventional\ncoherence gating methods in that CGN actively 'gates out' the unwanted optical\ncontributions while conventional methods 'gate in' the target optical signal.\nWe further show that the CGN method can outperform conventional coherence\ngating image quality in certain scenarios by more effectively rejecting\nunwanted optical contributions.\n", "  We advocate meaningful support of sustained education-outreach partnerships\nbetween regional metropolitan undergraduate institutions and astronomical clubs\nand societies. We present our experience as an example, in which we have grown\na partnership between the University of Michigan-Dearborn (hereafter UM-D, a\n4-year primarily undergraduate institution or PUI), Henry Ford College\n(hereafter HFC, a 2-year undergraduate college), and maintained a strong\ncollaboration with the Ford Amateur Astronomy Club (FAAC), which is highly\nactive in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. By allowing each organization to play\nto its strengths, we have developed a continuum of education-outreach efforts\nat all levels, with connecting tissue between the previously disparate efforts.\nTo-date, faculty and staff effort on these initiatives has been nearly entirely\nvoluntary and somewhat ad-hoc. Here we suggest an initiative to sustain the\ncontinuum of education-outreach for the long-term. There are two levels to the\nsuggested initiative. Firstly, partner institutions should dedicate at least\nhalf an FTE of faculty or staff effort specifically to education and outreach\ndevelopment. Secondly, professional societies like the AAS now have a great\nopportunity to support the education-outreach continuum at a national level, by\nfacilitating communication between institutions and clubs that are considering\na long-term partnership, by acting as a central resource for such partnerships,\nand possibly by convening or sponsoring events such as professional meetings\namong the metropolitan educational community.\n", "  We report the observation of a superconducting state below 8K coexistent with\na spin-glass state caused by atomic disorder in Ce substituted Ca3Rh4Sn13.\nMeasurements of specific heat, resistivity, and magnetism reveal the existence\nof inhomogeneous superconductivity in samples doped with Ce with\nsuperconducting critical temperatures Tc higher than those observed in the\nparent compound. For Ca3Rh4Sn13, the negative value of the change in\nresistivity with pressure P, correlates well with the calculated decrease in\nthe density of states at the Fermi energy with P. Based on band structure\ncalculations performed under pressure, we demonstrate how the change in DOS\nwould affect Tc of Ca3Rh4Sn13 under negative lattice pressure in samples that\nare strongly defected by quenching.\n", "  We present a new method for solving the Schrodinger equation using the\nLossless Transmission Line Model (LTL). The LTL model although extensively used\nin fiber optics and optical fiber design, it has not yet found application in\nsolid state problems. We develop the transformation theory mapping the wave\nequation to LTL and we apply the model to the case of a solid state periodic\nlattice. We extend the theory with an additional Wannier-Stark term and we show\nwith results the flexibility and the strength of the technique. The advantages\nof the method for arbitrary potentials are also stressed.\n", "  We study the $n$-component priority asymmetric simple exclusion process\n($n$-ASEP) with reflecting boundaries. We obtain all invariant measures in\nexplicit form and prove reversibility. Using the symmetry of the generator of\nthe process under the quantum algebra $U_q[\\mathfrak{gl}(n+1)]$ we construct\nduality functions with respect to which the $n$-ASEP is self-dual, both for the\nfinite and the infinite integer lattice. For the $n$-ASEP on the infinite\nlattice we use self-duality to derive in explicit form the time evolution of a\nfamily of measures with $K$ shocks in terms of the transition probability of\n$K$ coloured particles in a shock exclusion process with particle-dependent\nhopping rates and nearest-neighbour colour exchange. This process is a gas of\nparticles that forms a bound state, corresponding to shock coalescence on\nmacroscopic scale.\n", "  We investigate the productiong of $f_2(1270)$ and $f_2^{'}(1525)$ mesons in\nthe $K^{-}p\\to\\Lambda{}f_2(1270)$,$K^{-}p\\to\\Lambda{}f^{'}_2(1525)$ and\n$K^{-}p\\to{}K^{+}K^{-}\\Lambda$ reactions within an effective Lagrangian\napproach. For $K^{-}p\\to{}f_2\\Lambda$ reaction, by considering the\ncontributions from the $t$-channel $K^{+}$ exchange and $u$-channel nucleon\npole, we get a fairly good description of the experimental measurements about\nthe total and differential cross sections. Based on the studies of the\n$K^{-}p\\to{}f_2\\Lambda$ reaction, we investigate $K^{-}p\\to{}K^{+}K^{-}\\Lambda$\nreaction including the contributions from the $f_2(1270)$ and $f'_2(1525)$\nmesons decaying into $K^+K^-$ pair. The total cross sections and invariant mass\ndistribution of the $K p \\to K^+K^- \\Lambda$ reaction are predicted. The\nresults can be tested in future experiments and therefore offer new clues on\nthe nature of these tensor states.\n", "  The linear gyrokinetic stability properties of magnetically confined\nelectron-positron plasmas are investigated in the parameter regime most likely\nto be relevant for the first laboratory experiments involving such plasmas,\nwhere the density is small enough that collisions can be ignored and the Debye\nlength substantially exceeds the gyroradius. Although the plasma beta is very\nsmall, electromagnetic effects are retained, but magnetic compressibility can\nbe neglected. The work of a previous publication (Helander, 2014) is thus\nextended to include electromagnetic instabilities, which are of importance in\nclosed-field-line configurations, where such instabilities can occur at\narbitrarily low pressure. It is found that gyrokinetic instabilities are\ncompletely absent if the magnetic field is homogeneous: any instability must\ninvolve magnetic curvature or shear. Furthermore, in dipole magnetic fields,\nthe stability threshold for interchange modes with wavelengths exceeding the\nDebye radius coincides with that in ideal MHD. Above this threshold, the\nquasilinear particle flux is directed inward if the temperature gradient is\nsufficiently large, leading to spontaneous peaking of the density profile.\n", "  Magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ of the polycrystalline sample of samarium\nmonosulfide was measured as a function of the hydrostatic pressure $P$ up to 2\nkbar at liquid nitrogen and room temperatures using a pendulum-type\nmagnetometer. A pronounced magnitude of the pressure effect is found to be\npositive in sign and strongly temperature dependent: the pressure derivatives\nof $\\chi$, d\\,ln$\\chi$/d$P$, are $6.3\\pm0.5$ and $14.2\\pm1$ Mbar$^{-1}$ at 300\nand 78 K, respectively. The obtained experimental results are discussed within\nphenomenological approaches.\n", "  We present a series of $N$-body simulations representing the evolution of a\ngalactic nucleus and its stellar content in a nearly one-to-one representation.\nThe aim of this suite of simulations is to shed light on the interplay between\nnuclear clusters (NCs), super-massive black holes (SMBH) and the galactic\nnuclei in which they are contained. We modelled galaxies with masses from few\ntimes $10^8$ to $10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$, hosting in their nucleus a number of\nglobular clusters and, in some cases, a central SMBH.\n", "  We present the high precession photometric studies in V band and\nspectroscopic studies centered around H-alpha line for two extreme mass-ratio\nshort period contact binaries ASAS J082243+1927.0 (V1) and ASAS J085710+1856.8\n(V2). The variables in study are in the direction of open cluster Praesepe.\nFrom the light curve analysis V1 was found to be a low mass-ratio over-contact\nbinary of A-type, with a mass ratio q 0.121 and fill-out factor f 72%, and V2\nwas found to be a low mass contact binary of W-type, with a mass-ratio q 1.29\nand fill-out factor f 11% (marginal contact). The study of H-alpha absorption\nline profile of both the variables shows variation in equivalent widths (EWs)\nwith orbital phases. The mean EWs of the H-alpha line were obtained as\n1.6+or-0.13 A and 1.18+or-0.12 A for V1 and V2 respectively. The variation of\nH-alpha absorption with respect to phase is explained to be due to\nchromospheric activity in V1, as evident from the O Connell effect and that due\nto chromospheric flares, winds or photospheric source in V2. The parameters for\nboth the binaries are also studied with respect to the large sample of\nwell-studied contact binaries and possible mechanisms for merger in contact\nbinaries of both low and high mass ratios emphasized.\n", "  Co4Nb2O9 (CNO) having {\\alpha}-Al2O3 crystal structure with Co chains along\nc-direction shows gigantic magnetoelelctric coupling below antiferromagnetic\nordering temperature of 27 K but above a spin flop field of 1.6 T. We have\ninvestigated structural, magnetic and magnetoelectric properties of Fe\nsubstituted (10% and 20%) samples and compared with the parent one. In fact\nmagnetic and specific heat measurements have revealed an additional magnetic\ntransition below 10 K and presence of short range magnetic ordering above ~ 50\nK in parent as well as in Fe substituted samples. Linear magnetoelelctric and\nferroelectric behaviours are evidenced in the Fe substituted samples where an\nelectric field of 5 kV/m is sufficient to align the dipoles and the\nmagnetoelelctric coupling is ensured for magnetic fields as low as 0.25 T, far\nbelow the spin flop field.\n", "  The beam transport experiments in toroidal magnets were first described in\nEPAC08 [1] within the framework of a proposed low energy ion storage ring at\nFrankfurt University. The experiments with two room temperature 30 degree\ntoroids are needed to design the accumulator ring with closed longitudinal\nmagnetic field levels up to 6-8 T. The test setup aims on developing a ring\ninjection system. The primary beam line for the experiments was installed and\nsuccessfully commissioned in 2009. A special probe for ion beam detection was\ninstalled. This modular technique allows online diagnostics of the ion beam\nalong the beam path. In this paper, we present new results on beam transport\nexperiments and discuss transport and transverse beam injection properties of\nthat system.\n", "  The basic processes of the formation of the first stars in the primordial\nUniverse are outlined and the implications for cosmological structure formation\ndiscussed. By employing theoretical and numerical models of cosmic structure\nevolution embedded within N-body hydrodynamical chemistry simulations,\npredictions for the production of the first heavy elements in the Universe are\ngiven. These results are then compared against measured data of UV luminosities\nand metal abundances in different kinds of observations in order to draw\nconclusions on the chemical and thermal state of the cosmic medium at different\ncosmological epochs.\n", "  In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 89, 125418 (2014)], the authors argue that it\nis possible to map the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene to\nthose of bilayer graphene in an in-plane magnetic field. However, their\ndescription of the low-energy dynamics of twisted bilayer graphene is\nrestricted to the extended zone scheme and therefore neglects the effects of\nthe superperiodic structure. If the energy spectrum is studied in the supercell\nBrillouin zone, we find that the comparison with an in-plane magnetic field\nfails because (i) the energy spectra of the two situations exhibit different\nsymmetries and (ii) the low-energy spectra are very different.\n", "  The behaviour of a neutral particle (atom, molecule) with an induced electric\ndipole moment in a region with a uniform effective magnetic field under the\ninfluence of the Kratzer potential [A. Kratzer, Z. Phys. 3, 289 (1920)] and\nrotating effects is analysed. It is shown that the degeneracy of the\nLandau-type levels is broken and the angular frequency of the system acquires a\nnew contribution that stems from the rotation effects. Moreover, in the search\nfor bound states solutions, then, it is shown that the possible values of this\nangular frequency of the system are determined by the quantum numbers\nassociated with the radial modes and the angular momentum, the angular velocity\nof the rotating frame and by the parameters associated with the Kratzer\npotential.\n", "  It is shown that the spin-fermion model found to be an effective low-energy\nimplementation of the three-band Emery model after Wannier transformation of\n$p_x$- and $p_y$-orbitals in the oxygen ions subsystem is reduced to the\ngeneralized Kondo lattice model. Its essential feature is the presence of\nspin-correlated hoppings of the current carriers between distant cells.\nNumerical calculations of the spin-polaron spectrum demonstrate the important\nrole of the distant hoppings.\n", "  A study of the the main features of low- and high amplitude steady streamwise\nwall transpiration applied to pipe flow is presented. The effect of the two\ntranspiration parameters, amplitude and wavenumber, on the flow have been\ninvestigated by means of direct numerical simulation at a moderate turbulent\nReynolds number. The behaviour of the three identified mechanisms that act in\nthe flow: modification of Reynolds shear stress, steady streaming and\ngeneration of non-zero mean streamwise gradients, have been linked to the\ntranspiration parameters. The observed trends have permitted the identification\nof wall transpiration configurations able to reduce or increase the overall\nflow rate in -36.1% and 19.3% respectively. A resolvent analysis has been\ncarried out to obtain a description of the reorganization of the flow\nstructures induced by the transpiration.\n", "  Both active and sterile sub-eV neutrinos can form the cosmic neutrino\nbackground in the early Universe. We consider the beta-decaying (e.g., $^3$H)\nand EC-decaying (e.g., $^{163}$Ho) nuclei as the promising targets to capture\nrelic neutrinos in the laboratory. We calculate the capture rates of relic\nelectron neutrinos and antineutrinos against the corresponding beta decay or\nelectron capture (EC) decay backgrounds in the (3+$N_{\\rm s}$) flavor mixing\nscheme, and discuss the future prospect in terms of the PTOLEMY project. We\nstress that such direct measurements of hot DM might not be hopeless in the\nlong term.\n", "  A novel reduced-order model for nonlinear flows is presented. The model\narises from a resolvent decomposition in which the nonlinear advection terms of\nthe Navier-Stokes equation are considered as the input to a linear system in\nFourier space. Results show that Taylor-G\\\"ortler-like vortices can be\nrepresented from a low-order resolvent decomposition of a nonlinear lid-driven\ncavity flow. The present approach provides an approximation of the fluctuating\nvelocity given the time-mean and the time history of a single velocity probe.\n", "  A number of studies, referring to the observed Trojan asteroids of various\nplanets in our Solar System, or to hypothetical Trojan bodies in extrasolar\nplanetary systems, have emphasized the importance of so-called secondary\nresonances in the problem of the long term stability of Trojan motions. Such\nresonances describe commensurabilities between the fast, synodic, and secular\nfrequency of the Trojan body, and, possibly, additional slow frequencies\nproduced by more than one perturbing bodies. The presence of secondary\nresonances sculpts the dynamical structure of the phase space. Hence,\nidentifying their location is a relevant task for theoretical studies. In the\npresent paper we combine the methods introduced in two recent papers (Paez &\nEfthymiopoulos, 2015, Paez & Locatelli, 2015) in order to analytically predict\nthe location of secondary resonances in the Trojan problem (SEE FILE FOR\nCOMPLETE ABSTRACT)\n", "  Besides the traditional strong and electromagnetic decay modes,\n${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ meson can also decay through the weak interactions within the\nstandard model of elementary particle. With anticipation of copious\n${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ data samples at the running LHC and coming SuperKEKB\nexperiments, the two-body nonleptonic bottom-changing ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$\n$B_{c}^{\\ast}{\\pi}$, $B_{c}^{\\ast}K$ decays ($n$ $=$ 1, 2, 3) are investigated\nwith perturbative QCD approach firstly. The absolute branching ratios for\n${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}^{\\ast}{\\pi}$ and $B_{c}^{\\ast}K$ decays are\nestimated to reach up to about $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-11}$, respectively, which\nmight possibly be measured by the future experiments.\n", "  The purpose of this document is to find an analytical solution for the\ngyrokinetic equation under specific, simplificative hypotheses. The case I am\nconsidering is that of a collisional plasma in the presence of a chain of\nmagnetic islands. The presence of the magnetic islands causes the onset of\nperturbative fields, in particular an electrostatic field, with a gradient\nlength-scale comparable with the island's width. When the island's width w\nbecomes comparable with the ion Larmor radius rho_i , the drift-kinetic\nequation is inadequate to treat the transport and the calculation of the\nneoclassical effects. Nevertheless, I'm going to solve the equation with the\nmethods described by S. P. Hirshman and D. J. Sigmar in the review paper\n\"Neoclassical transport of impurities in tokamak plasmas\", which was developed\nto solve the drift-kinetic equation in different regimes of collisionality. I'm\ngoing to remind first the drift-kinetic theory, which was largely used to study\nclassical and neoclassical transport in magnetized plasmas. Then I'm moving to\nthe gyrokinetic theory, which brings to a more complicated kinetic equation,\nand I'm going to solve it by applying the approach used previously by Hirshman\n& Sigmar.\n", "  After the discovery of laser therapy it was realized it has useful\napplication of wound healing and reduce pain, but due to the poor understanding\nof the mechanism and dose response this technique remained to be controversial\nfor therapeutic applications. In order to understand the working and\neffectiveness different experiments were performed to determine the laser beam\neffect at the cellular and tissue level. This article discusses the mechanism\nof beam interaction at tissues and cellular level with different light sources\nand dosimetry principles for clinical application of low level laser therapy.\nDifferent application techniques and methods currently in use for clinical\ntreatment has also been reviewed.\n", "  This note is aimed at an introductory presentation of experimental\ncharacteristics of charged tachyons, deduced under the assumption that the\ntachyons possess standard electromagnetic interactions. In particular,\nCherenkov radiation by tachyons, their ionization loss in tracking devices and\nthe bremsstrahlung loss in electromagnetic calorimeters are considered.\n", "  We report on the results of a $\\sim$40 d multi-wavelength monitoring of the\nBe X-ray binary system IGR J05007-7047 (LXP 38.55). During that period the\nsystem was monitored in the X-rays using the Swift telescope and in the optical\nwith multiple instruments. When the X-ray luminosity exceeded $10^{36}$ erg/s\nwe triggered an XMM-Newton ToO observation. Timing analysis of the photon\nevents collected during the XMM-Newton observation reveals coherent X-ray\npulsations with a period of 38.551(3) s (1 {\\sigma}), making it the 17$^{th}$\nknown high-mass X-ray binary pulsar in the LMC. During the outburst, the X-ray\nspectrum is fitted best with a model composed of an absorbed power law ($\\Gamma\n=0.63$) plus a high-temperature black-body (kT $\\sim$ 2 keV) component. By\nanalysing $\\sim$12 yr of available OGLE optical data we derived a 30.776(5) d\noptical period, confirming the previously reported X-ray period of the system\nas its orbital period. During our X-ray monitoring the system showed limited\noptical variability while its IR flux varied in phase with the X-ray\nluminosity, which implies the presence of a disk-like component adding cooler\nlight to the spectral energy distribution of the system.\n", "  The functioning of 2D d2, d3, and d4 transition metal carbides as CO2\nconversion catalysts has been proved by well resolved density functional theory\n(DFT) and DFT+U theoretical calculations. Whilst MXenes from the d2 series (M =\nTi, Zr, and Hf) have demonstrated active behaviors for the capture of CO2, the\nV3C2, Nb3C2, Cr3C2, and Mo3C2 materials exhibit the most promising results for\ntheir application in the selective CO2 conversion into CH4, with limiting\nreaction energies of 1.55, 1.75, 0.69, and 1.24 eV, respectively, at DFT+U\ncomputational level plus explicit DFT-D3 dispersion corrections, and specially\nhighlighting the role of Cr3C2 due to its theoretically predicted low over\npotential. Moreover, important features have been predicted during the first\nhydrogenation step towards the formation of the OCHO and HOCO radical species,\nexhibiting spontaneous reaction energies in the OCHO obtaining for such\npromising carbides from the d3 and d4 groups. Our re-sults provide novel\ninsights in the computer-aided searching of high performance catalysts and the\nunderstanding of reaction mech-anisms for CO2. Finally, it is hypothesized that\nthe capture of CO2 along the early step of the reaction is spontaneously\nproduced without pass from a physisorbed state, being the strength of such\ncapture larger than the computed binding energies for the chemi-sorption of\nH2O, offering encouraging perspectives for the experimental testing of our\nmaterials in water environment\n", "  Recently we introduced a new technique for computing the average free energy\nof a system with quenched randomness. The basic tool of this technique is a\ndistributional zeta-function. The distributional zeta-function is a complex\nfunction whose derivative at the origin yields the average free energy of the\nsystem as the sum of two contributions: the first one is a series in which all\nthe integer moments of the partition function of the model contribute; the\nsecond one, which can not be written as a series of the integer moments, can be\nmade as small as desired. In this paper we present a mathematical rigorous\nproof that the average free energy of one disordered $\\lambda\\varphi^{4}$ model\ndefined in a zero-dimensional space can be obtained using the distributional\nzeta-function technique. We obtain an analytic expression for the average free\nenergy of the model.\n", "  We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the\ncoalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed\nby the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was\ninitially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting\nbinary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a\nnetwork signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 $\\sigma$.\nThe signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s,\nincreasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz,\nand reached a peak gravitational strain of $3.4_{-0.9}^{+0.7} \\times 10^{-22}$.\nThe inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are $14.2_{-3.7}^{+8.3}\nM_{\\odot}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3} M_{\\odot}$ and the final black hole mass is\n$20.8_{-1.7}^{+6.1} M_{\\odot}$. We find that at least one of the component\nblack holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity\ndistance of $440_{-190}^{+180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift\n$0.09_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. All uncertainties define a 90 % credible interval. This\nsecond gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar\npopulations and on deviations from general relativity.\n", "  We propose here a multiplex network approach to investigate simultaneously\ndifferent types of dependency in complex data sets. In particular, we consider\nmultiplex networks made of four layers corresponding respectively to linear,\nnon-linear, tail, and partial correlations among a set of financial time\nseries. We construct the sparse graph on each layer using a standard network\nfiltering procedure, and we then analyse the structural properties of the\nobtained multiplex networks. The study of the time evolution of the multiplex\nconstructed from financial data uncovers important changes in intrinsically\nmultiplex properties of the network, and such changes are associated with\nperiods of financial stress. We observe that some features are unique to the\nmultiplex structure and would not be visible otherwise by the separate analysis\nof the single-layer networks corresponding to each dependency measure.\n", "  A method combining video imaging in parallel microchannels with a\nsemi-empirical mathematical model provides non-intrusive, high-throughput\nmeasurements of time-varying biofilm viscosity. The approach is demonstrated\nfor early growth Pseudomonas sp. biofilms exposed to constant flow streams of\nnutrient solutions with different ionic strengths. The ability to measure\nviscosities at early growth stages, without inducing a shear-thickening\nresponse, enabled measurements that are among the lowest reported to date. In\naddition, good time resolution enabled the detection of a rapid thickening\nphase, which occurred at different times after the exponential growth phase\nfinished, depending on the ionic strength. The technique opens the way for a\ncombinatorial approach to beter understand the complex dynamical response of\nbiofilm mechanical properties under well-controlled physical, chemical and\nbiological growth conditions and time-limited perturbations.\n", "  We explore various models for the pattern forming instability in a\nlaser-driven cloud of cold two-level atoms with a plane feedback mirror. Focus\nis on the combined treatment of nonlinear propagation in a diffractively thick\nmedium and the boundary condition given by feedback. The combined presence of\npurely transverse transmission gratings and reflection gratings on wavelength\nscale is addressed. Different truncation levels of the Fourier expansion of the\ndielectric susceptibility in terms of these gratings are discussed and compared\nto literature. A formalism to calculate the exact solution for the homogenous\nstate in presence of absorption is presented. The relationship between the\ncounterpropagating beam instability and the feedback instability is discussed.\nFeedback reduces the threshold by a factor of two under optimal conditions.\nEnvelope curves which bound all possible threshold curves for varying mirror\ndistances are calculated. The results are comparing well to experimental\nresults regarding the observed length scales and threshold conditions. It is\nclarified where the assumption of a diffractively thin medium is justified.\n", "  Previous research shows that women are more altruist than men in dictator\ngame experiments. Yet, little is known whether women are expected to be more\naltruist than men. Here we elicit third-parties' beliefs about dictators'\ndonations conditional on knowing the gender of the dictator. Our data provide\nevidence of three main findings: (i) women are expected to be more altruist\nthan men; (ii) both men and women have correct beliefs about the level of\naltruism among men; and (iii) both men and women overestimate the level of\naltruism among women. In doing so, our results uncover a perception gap\naccording to which, although women are more altruist than men, they are\nexpected to be even more altruist than they actually are.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons are prone to in-plane bending even when supported on\nflat substrates. However, the amount of bending that ribbons can stably\nwithstand remains poorly known. Here, by using molecular dynamics simulations,\nwe study the stability limits of 0.5-1.9 nm wide armchair and zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons subject to bending. We observe that the limits for maximum stable\ncurvatures are below ~10 deg/nm, in case the bending is externally forced and\nthe limit is caused by buckling instability. Furthermore, it turns out that the\nlimits for maximum stable curvatures are also below ~10 deg/nm, in case the\nbending is not forced and the limit arises only from the corrugated potential\nenergy landscape due to the substrate. Both of the stability limits lower\nrapidly when ribbons widen. These results agree with recent experiments and can\nbe understood by means of transparent elasticity models.\n", "  In net-neutral systems correlations between charge fluctuations generate\nstrong attractive thermal Casimir forces and engineering these forces to\noptimize nanodevice performance is an important challenge. We show how the\nnormal and lateral thermal Casimir forces between two plates containing\nBrownian charges can be modulated by decorrelating the system through the\napplication of an electric field, which generates a nonequilibrium steady state\nwith a constant current in one or both plates, reducing the ensuing\nfluctuation-generated normal force while at the same time generating a lateral\ndrag force. This hypothesis is confirmed by detailed numerical simulations as\nwell as an analytical approach based on stochastic density functional theory.\n", "  Computer running human machine interfaces are fast supplanting conventional\nhardware dedicated to monitoring and supervising tasks. This kind of approach\nwas successfully employed to develop a new monitoring and control software,\nrunning on a conventional laptop computer, for a small size helium liquefier.\nThis software was realized with a SCADA development package and hallowed to\nmanage all the liquefier functionalities. Being conceived as an open structure\nsuitable for further upgrades, this liquefier HMI can be tailored on demand to\nsatisfy specific needs of the end-user, even if not provided by the original\nmanufacturer project.\n", "  We consider a class of one-dimensional compass models with XYZ$-$YZX-type of\nthree-site exchange interaction in an external magnetic field. We present the\nexact solution derived by means of Jordan-Wigner transformation, and study the\nexcitation gap, spin correlations, and establish the phase diagram. Besides the\ncanted antiferromagnetic and polarized phases, the three-site interactions\ninduce two distinct chiral phases, corresponding to gapless spinless-fermion\nsystems having two or four Fermi points. We find that the $z$ component of\nscalar chirality operator can act as an order parameter for these chiral\nphases. We also find that the thermodynamic quantities including the Wilson\nratio can characterize the liquid phases. Finally, a nontrivial magnetoelectric\neffect is explored, and we show that the polarization can be manipulated by the\nmagnetic field in the absence of electric field.\n", "  Low-energy pi+ (E < 35 MeV) from 12C+197Au collisions at incident energies\nfrom 300 to 1800 MeV per nucleon were detected with the Si-Si(Li)-CsI(Tl)\ncalibration telescopes of the INDRA multidetector. The inclusive angular\ndistributions are approximately isotropic, consistent with multiple\nrescattering in the target spectator. The multiplicity correlations of the\nlow-energy pions and of energetic protons (E > 150 MeV) with intermediate-mass\nfragments were determined from the measured coincidence data. The deduced\ncorrelation functions 1 + R \\approx 1.3 for inclusive event samples reflect the\nstrong correlations evident from the common impact-parameter dependence of the\nconsidered multiplicities. For narrow impact-parameter bins (based on\ncharged-particle multiplicity), the correlation functions are close to unity\nand do not indicate strong additional correlations. Only for pions at high\nparticle multiplicities (central collisions) a weak anticorrelation is\nobserved, probably due to a limited competition between these emissions.\nOverall, the results are consistent with the equilibrium assumption made in\nstatistical multifragmentation scenarios. Predictions obtained with\nintranuclear cascade models coupled to the Statistical Multifragmentation Model\nare in good agreement with the experimental data.\n"]}
