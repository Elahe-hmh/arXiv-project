accurate, multi-domain spectral code is used in order to construct\nsequences of general relativistic, differentially rotating neutron stars in\naxisymmetry and stationarity. For bodies with a spheroidal topology and a\nhomogeneous or an N=1 polytropic equation of state, we investigate the solution\nspace corresponding to broad ranges of degree of differential rotation and\nstellar densities. In particular, starting from static and spherical\nconfigurations, we analyse the changes of the corresponding surface shapes as\nthe rate of rotation is increased. For a sufficiently weak degree of\ndifferential rotation, the sequences terminate at a mass-shedding limit, while\nfor moderate and strong rates of differential rotation, they exhibit a\ncontinuous parametric transition to a regime of toroidal fluid bodies. In this\narticle, we concentrate on the appearance of this transition, analyse in detail\nits occurrence and show its relevance for the calculation of astrophysical\nsequences. Moreover, we find that the solution space contains various types of\nspheroidal configurations, which were not considered in previous work, mainly\ndue to numerical limitations.\n", "  We examine the HI content and environment of all of the Local Group dwarf\ngalaxies (M_tot < 10^10 M_solar), including the numerous newly discovered\nsatellites of the Milky Way and M31. All of the new dwarfs, with the exception\nof Leo T, have no detected HI. The majority of dwarf galaxies within ~270 kpc\nof the Milky Way or Andromeda are undetected in HI (< 10^5 M_solar for Milky\nWay dwarfs), while those further than ~270 kpc are predominantly detected with\nmasses ~10^5 to 10^8 M_solar. Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with\nvelocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo\ndensity of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained\nto be greater than 2-3 x 10^-4 cm^-3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This\nis broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky\nWay-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of\na galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count,\ngas-less dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 x 10^8 M_solar of HI\ngas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation\nfuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era.\n", "  We briefly discuss the history of X-ray polarimetry for astronomical\napplications including a guide to the appropriate statistics. We also provide\nan introduction to some of the new techniques discussed in more detail\nelsewhere in these proceedings. We conclude our discussion with our concerns\nover adequate ground calibration, especially with respect to unpolarized beams,\nand at the system level.\n", "  The soft X-ray emission in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) is dominated\nby emission lines, produced in a gas photoionized by the nuclear continuum and\nlikely spatially coincident with the optical narrow line region (NLR). However,\na fraction of the observed soft X-ray flux appears like a featureless power law\ncontinuum. If the continuum underlying the soft X-ray emission lines is due to\nThomson scattering of the nuclear radiation, it should be very highly\npolarized. We calculated the expected amount of polarization assuming a simple\nconical geometry for the NLR, combining these results with the observed\nfraction of the reflected continuum in bright obscured AGN.\n", "  We present new calculations of X-ray polarization from black hole accretion\ndisks in the thermally-dominated state, using a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing code in\nfull general relativity. In contrast to many previously published studies, our\napproach allows us to include returning radiation that is deflected by the\nstrong-field gravity of the BH and scatters off of the disk before reaching a\ndistant observer. Although carrying a relatively small fraction of the total\nobserved flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highly polarized and in a\ndirection perpendicular to the direct radiation. We show how these new features\nof the polarization spectra may be developed into a powerful tool for measuring\nblack hole spin and probing the gas flow in the innermost disk.\n", "  We present our results of Monte-Carlo simulations of polarized Compton X-rays\nfrom magnetic cataclysmic variables, with realistic density, temperature and\nvelocity structures in the accretion flow. Our study has shown that the X-ray\nlinear polarization may reach about 8% for systems with high accretion rates\nviewed at a high viewing inclination angle. This value is roughly twice the\nmaximum value obtained by previous studies which assumed a cold, static\nemission region with a uniform density. We also investigate the X-ray\npolarization properties of ultra-compact double-degenerate binaries for the\nunipolar-inductor and direct-impact accretor models. Our study has shown\nnegligible X-ray polarization for the unipolar-induction model. However, the\ndirect-impact accretor model may give X-ray polarization levels similar to that\npredicted for the magnetic cataclysmic variables.\n", "  We investigate the polarization of Compton scattered X-rays from relativistic\njets in active galactic nuclei using Monte Carlo simulations. We consider three\nscenarios: scattering of photons from an accretion disk, scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons, and synchrotron self-Comptonization (SSC)\nwithin the jet. For Comptonization of thermal disk photons or CMB photons the\nmaximum linear polarization attained is slightly over 20% at viewing angles\nclose to 90 degrees. The value decreases with the viewing inclination. For SSC,\nthe maximum value may exceed 80%. The angle dependence is complicated, and it\nvaries with the photon injection sites. Our study demonstrates that X-ray\npolarization, in addition to multi-wavelength spectra, can distinguish certain\nmodels for emission and particle acceleration in relativistic jets.\n", "  Accretion onto black holes often proceeds via an accretion disc or a\ntemporary disc-like pattern. Variability features, observed in the light curves\nof such objects, and theoretical models of accretion flows suggest that\naccretion discs are inhomogeneous and non-axisymmetric. Fast orbital motion of\nthe individual clumps can modulate the observed signal. If the emission from\nthese clumps is partially polarized, which is likely the case, then rapid\npolarization changes of the observed signal are expected as a result of general\nrelativity effects.\n", "  We study oscillations of accretion torus with azimuthal magnetic field. For\nseveral lowest-order modes we calculate eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions and\ncalculate corresponding intensity and polarization light curves using advanced\nray-tracing methods.\n", "  The degree and the temporal evolution of linear polarization in the prompt\nand afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts is a very robust diagnostic of some\nkey features of gamma-ray bursts jets and their micro and macro physics. In\nthis contribution, I review the current status of the theory of polarized\nemission from GRB jets during the prompt, optical flash, and afterglow\nemission. I compare the theoretical predictions to the available observations\nand discuss the future prospect from both the theoretical and observational\nstandpoints.\n", "  We review the polarization properties of X-ray emission from highly\nmagnetized neutron stars, focusing on emission from the stellar surfaces. We\ndiscuss how x-ray polarization can be used to constrain neutron star magnetic\nfield and emission geometry, and to probe strong-field quantum electrodynamics\nand possibly constrain the properties of axions.\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows are thought to be produced by an\nultrarelativistic jet. One of the most important open questions is the outflow\ncomposition: the energy may be carried out from the central source either as\nkinetic energy (of baryons and/or pairs), or in electromagnetic form (Poynting\nflux). While the total observable flux may be indistinguishable in both cases,\nits polarization properties are expected to differ markedly. The later time\nevolution of afterglow polarization is also a powerful diagnostic of the jet\ngeometry. Again, with subtle and hardly detectable differences in the output\nflux, we have distinct polarization predictions.\n", "  Radiation of X-ray bursts and of accretion shocks in weakly magnetized\nneutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries is produced in plane-parallel\natmospheres dominated by electron scattering. We first discuss polarization\nproduced by single (non-magnetic) Compton scattering, in particular the\ndepolarizing effect of high electron temperature, and then the polarization due\nto multiply electron scattering in a slab. We further predict the X-ray pulse\nprofiles and polarization properties of nuclear- and accretion-powered\nmillisecond pulsars. We introduce a relativistic rotation vector model, which\nincludes the effect of rotation of polarization plane due to the rapid motion\nof the hot spot as well as the light bending. Future observations of the X-ray\npolarization will provide a valuable tool to test the geometry of the emission\nregion in pulsars and its physical characteristics.\n", "  The specific problem we address in these lectures is the problem of transport\nand localization in disordered systems, when interference is present, as\ncharacteristic for waves, with a focus on realizations with ultracold atoms.\n", "  We consider the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation driven by mollified space-time\nwhite noise. We show that, as the mollifier is removed, the solutions converge\nweakly to 0, independently of the initial condition. If the intensity of the\nnoise simultaneously converges to 0 at a sufficiently fast rate, then the\nsolutions converge to those of the deterministic equation. At the critical\nrate, the limiting solution is still deterministic, but it exhibits an\nadditional damping term.\n", "  The gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral contains\ninformation on the nuclear equation of state. This information is contained in\na combination of the tidal polarizability parameters of the two neutron stars\nand is clearest in the late inspiral, just before merger. We use the recently\ndefined tidal extension of the effective one-body formalism to construct a\ncontrolled analytical description of the frequency-domain phasing of neutron\nstar inspirals up to merger. Exploiting this analytical description we find\nthat the tidal polarizability parameters of neutron stars can be measured by\nthe advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network from gravitational wave signals having\na reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of $\\rho=16$. This measurability result\nseems to hold for all the nuclear equations of state leading to a maximum mass\nlarger than $1.97M_\\odot$. We also propose a promising new way of extracting\ninformation on the nuclear equation of state from a coherent analysis of an\nensemble of gravitational wave observations of separate binary merger events.\n", "  This text is intended as an introduction to magnetohydrodynamics in\nastrophysics, emphasizing a fast path to the elements essential for physical\nunderstanding. It assumes experience with concepts from fluid mechanics: the\nfluid equation of motion and the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of fluid\nflow. In addition, the basics of vector calculus and elementary special\nrelativity are needed. Not much knowledge of electromagnetic theory is\nrequired. In fact, since MHD is much closer in spirit to fluid mechanics than\nto electromagnetism, an important part of the learning curve is to overcome\nintuitions based on the vacuum electrodynamics of one's high school days. The\nfirst chapter (only 39 pp) is meant as a practical introduction including\nexercises. This is the `essential' part. The exercises are important as\nillustrations of the points made in the text (especially the less intuitive\nones). Almost all are mathematically unchallenging. The supplement in chapter 2\ncontains further explanations, more specialized topics and connections to the\noccasional topic somewhat outside MHD. The emphasis is on physical\nunderstanding by the visualization of MHD processes, as opposed to more formal\napproaches.\n", "  In this work we calculate pulsar kick velocity of magnetized neutron star\ncomposed of degenerate quark matter core with non-Fermi liquid (NFL)\ncorrection. Both the leading order (LO) and next to leading order (NLO)\ncorrections to the kick velocity have been incorporated. In addition, the NFL\ncorrections to the specific heat of magnetized quark matter have been\npresented. This has been taken into account to calculate the kick velocity of\nthe neutron star. Results show significant departure from the normal Fermi\nliquid estimates. The relation between radius and temperature has been shown\nwith kick velocity of $100\\, km/s$ with and without NFL corrections.\n", "  The standard analysis for type Ia supernovae uses a set of templates to\novercome the intrinsic variation of the supernova light curves with wavelength.\nThis paper shows that standard templates contain an anomaly in that the width\nof the template light curve is proportional to the emitted wavelength.\nFurthermore this anomaly is exactly what would be produced if epoch differences\nwere not subject to time dilation and yet time dilation corrections were\napplied. It is the specific nature of this anomaly that is evidence for a\nstatic universe. The lack of time dilation is verified by direct analysis of\nthe original supernovae data.\n", "  Finding a quantitative description of the rate of collisions between small\nparticles suspended in mixing flows is a long-standing problem. Here we\ninvestigate the validity of a parameterisation of the collision rate for\nidentical particles subject to Stokes force, based on results for relative\nvelocities of heavy particles that were recently obtained within a statistical\nmodel for the dynamics of turbulent aerosols. This model represents the\nturbulent velocity fluctuations by Gaussian random functions. We find that the\nparameterisation gives quantitatively good results in the limit where the \\lq\nghost-particle approximation' applies. The collision rate is a sum of two\ncontributions due to \\lq caustics' and to \\lq clustering'. Within the\nstatistical model we compare the relative importance of these two collision\nmechanisms. The caustic formation rate is high when the particle inertia\nbecomes large, and we find that caustics dominate the collision rate as soon as\nthey form frequently. We compare the magnitude of the caustic contribution to\nthe collision rate to the formation rate of caustics.\n", "  The mass spectra of $D_s$ meson is obtained in the framework of relativistic\nindependent quark model using Martin like potential for the quark confinement.\nThe predicted excited states are in good agreement with the experimental\nresults as well as with the lattice and other theoretical predictions. The\nspectroscopic parameters are employed further to compute the decay constant,\nelectromagnetic transition and leptonic decay widths. The present result for\nits decay constant, $f_P$ (252.82 MeV) is in excellent agreement with the value\n252.6 $\\pm$ 11.1 MeV reported by CLEO-c and the predicted branching ratios for\n$(D_s \\rightarrow \\tau \\bar{\\nu}_\\tau, \\mu \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu)$ ($5.706 \\times\n10^{-2}, 5.812 \\times 10^{-3}$) are in close agreement with the PDG values ($\n(5.43 \\pm 0.31)\\times 10^{-2}, (5.90 \\pm 0.33)\\times 10^{-3} $) respectively.\n", "  In this paper, we examine a static gravitational field with axial symmetry\nover probe particles in the solar system. Using the Weyl conformastatic\nsolution as a model, we find a non-standard expression to perihelion advance\ndue to the constraints imposed by the topology of the local gravitational\nfield. We show that the application of the slow motion condition to the\ngeodesic equations without altering Einstein's equations does not necessarily\nlead to the Newtonian limit; rather it leads to an intermediate\nnearly-newtonian gravitational stage, which can be applied to astrophysical\nproblems in solar scale. We apply the model to the perihelion advance of inner\nplanets and minor objects (NEO asteroids and the comets). As a result, we\nobtain an expression of a non-standard relativistic precession that reveals a\nclose agreement to observational data calibrated with the Ephemerides of the\nPlanets and the Moon (EPM2011). The study of perihelion advance of eight small\ncelestial bodies (asteroids and comets) is also considered.\n", "  We study the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation driven by a noise term with\nintensity $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ and correlation length $\\delta$ in two and three\nspatial dimensions. We study diagonal limits $\\delta, \\varepsilon \\to 0$ and\ndescribe fully the large deviation behaviour depending on the relationship\nbetween $\\delta$ and $\\varepsilon$.\n  The recently developed theory of regularity structures allows to fully\nanalyse the behaviour of solutions for vanishing correlation length $\\delta$\nand fixed noise intensity $\\varepsilon$. One key fact is that in order to get\nnon-trivial limits as $\\delta \\to 0$, it is necessary to introduce diverging\ncounterterms. The theory of regularity structures allows to rigorously analyse\nthis renormalisation procedure for a number of interesting equations.\n  Our main result is a large deviation principle for these renormalised\nsolutions. One interesting feature of this result is that the diverging\nrenormalisation constants disappear at the level of the large deviations rate\nfunction. We apply this result to derive a sharp condition on $\\delta,\n\\varepsilon$ that guarantees a large deviation principle for diagonal schemes\n$\\varepsilon, \\delta \\to 0$ for the equation without renormalisation.\n", "  We study a quantum spin system with local bilinear interactions and without\nquenched disorder which seems to display characteristic signatures of a\nmany-body localisation (MBL) transition. From direct diagonalisation of small\nsystems, we find a change in certain dynamical and spectral properties at a\ncritical value of a coupling, from those characteristic of a thermalising phase\nto those characteristic of a MBL phase. The system we consider is known to have\na quantum phase transition in its ground-state in the limit of large size,\nrelated to a first-order active-to-inactive phase transition in the stochastic\ntrajectories of an associated classical model of glasses. Our results here\nsuggest that this transition is present throughout the spectrum of the system\nin the large size limit. These findings may help understand the connection\nbetween MBL and structural glass transitions.\n", "  We revisit the problem of transport of a harmonically driven inertial\nparticle moving in a {\\it symmetric} periodic potential, subjected to {\\it\nunbiased} non-equilibrium generalized white Poissonian noise and coupled to\nthermal bath. Statistical asymmetry of Poissonian noise is sufficient to induce\ntransport and under presence of external harmonic driving this system exhibits\na phenomenon of multiple velocity reversals. Consequently, one can manipulate\nthe direction of transport just by adjusting the parameters of externally\napplied forces.\n", "  The honeycomb lattice possesses a novel energy band structure, which is\ncharacterized by two distinct Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, dominating\nmost of the physical properties of the honeycomb structure materials. However,\nup till now, the origin of the Dirac points is unclear yet. Here, we discover a\nhidden symmetry on the honeycomb lattice and prove that the existence of Dirac\npoints is exactly protected by such hidden symmetry. Furthermore, the moving\nand merging of the Dirac points and a quantum phase transition, which have been\ntheoretically predicted and experimentally observed on the honeycomb lattice,\ncan also be perfectly explained by the parameter dependent evolution of the\nhidden symmetry.\n", "  We present PICsar -- a new Particle in Cell code geared towards efficiently\nsimulating the magnetosphere of the aligned rotator. PICsar is a special\nrelativistic, electromagnetic, charge conservative code that can be used to\nsimulate arbitrary electromagnetics problems in axisymmetry. It features\nstretchable body-fitted coordinates that follow the surface of a sphere,\nsimplifying the application of boundary conditions in the case of the aligned\nrotator; a radiation absorbing outer boundary, which allows a steady state to\nbe set up dynamically and maintained indefinitely from transient initial\nconditions; and algorithms for injection of charged particles into the\nsimulation domain. The code is parallelized using MPI and scales well to a\nlarge number of processors. We discuss the numerical methods used in PICsar and\npresent tests of the code. In particular, we show that PICsar can accurately\nand efficiently simulate the magnetosphere of the aligned monopole rotator in\nthe force free limit. We present simulations of the aligned dipole rotator in a\nforthcoming paper.\n", "  One of the key challenges in developing quantum networks is to generate\nsingle photons with high brightness, purity, and long temporal coherence.\nSemiconductor quantum dots potentially satisfy these requirements; however, due\nto imperfections in the surrounding material, the coherence generally degrades\nwith increasing excitation power yielding a broader emission spectrum. Here we\novercome this power broadening regime and demonstrate the longest coherence at\nexciton saturation where the detection count rates are highest. We detect\nsingle-photon count rates of 460,000 counts per second under pulsed laser\nexcitation while maintaining a single-photon purity of greater than 99%.\nImportantly, the enhanced coherence is attained with quantum dots in ultraclean\nwurtzite InP nanowires, where the surrounding charge traps are filled by\nexciting above the wurtzite InP nanowire bandgap. By raising the excitation\nintensity, the number of possible charge configurations in the quantum dot\nenvironment is reduced, resulting in a narrower emission spectrum. Via Monte\nCarlo simulations we explain the observed narrowing of the emission spectrum\nwith increasing power. Cooling down the sample to 300 mK, we further enhance\nthe single-photon coherence two-fold as compared to operation at 4.5 K,\nresulting in a homogeneous coherence time, T2, of 1.2 ns.\n", "  The neutrino propagation through the Earth is investigated in the framework\nof the democratic neutrino theory. In this theory the neutrino mixing angle\ntheta-1-3 is approximately determined, which allows one to make a well defined\nneutrino oscillogram driven by the 1-3 mixing in the matter of the Earth.\nSignificant differences in this oscillogram from the case of models with\nrelatively small theta-1-3 are discussed.\n", "  We study the possibility that the universe is subjected to a deformation,\nbesides its expansion described by Friedmann's equations. The concept of smooth\ndeformation of a riemannian manifolds associated with the extrinsic curvature\nis applied the standard FLRW cosmology. Starting from the resulting modified\nFriedman's equation we study two possible solutions with six models for each\none in low redshift. In other to constrain the models, we calculate\ndeceleration, jerk and Hubble parameters and compare with different data as the\nlatest BAO/CMB + SNIa constraints, SNLS SNIa, x-ray galaxy clusters and the\ngold sample (SNIa). As a result, we obtain a set of proper models compatible\nwith the current observational data.\n", "  We extend the description of the isotropic and anisotropic random component\nof the small-scale magnetic field within the existing magnetic field model of\nthe Milky Way from Jansson&Farrar, by including random realizations of the\nsmall-scale component. Using a magnetic-field power spectrum with Gaussian\nrandom fields, the NE2001 model for the thermal electrons and the Galactic\ncosmic-ray electron distribution from the current GALPROP model we derive\nfull-sky maps for the total and polarized synchrotron intensity as well as the\nFaraday rotation-measure distribution. While previous work assumed that\nsmall-scale fluctuations average out along the line-of-sight or which only\ncomputed ensemble averages of random fields, we show that these fluctuations\nneed to be carefully taken into account. Comparing with observational data we\nobtain not only good agreement with 408 MHz total and WMAP7 22 GHz polarized\nintensity emission maps, but also an improved agreement with Galactic\nforeground rotation-measure maps and power spectra, whose amplitude and shape\nstrongly depend on the parameters of the random field. We demonstrate that a\ncorrelation length of ~220pc (50pc being a 5\\sigma lower limit) is needed to\nmatch the slope of the observed power spectrum of Galactic foreground\nrotation-measure maps. Using multiple realizations allows us also to infer\nerrors on individual observables. We find that previously-used amplitudes for\nrandom and anisotropic random magnetic field components need to be rescaled by\nfactors of ~0.3 and 0.6 to account for the new small-scale contributions. Our\nmodel predicts a rotation measure of -2.8\\pm7.1 rad/m^2 and 4.4\\pm11.0 rad/m^2\nfor the north and south Galactic poles respectively, in good agreement with\nobservations. Applying our model to deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic\nrays we infer a mean deflection of ~3.5\\pm1.1 degree for 60 EeV protons\narriving from CenA.\n", "  In many countries poker is one of the most popular card games. Although each\nvariant of poker has its own rules, all involve the use of money to make the\nchallenge meaningful. Nowadays, in the collective consciousness, some variants\nof poker are referred to as games of skill, others as gambling. A poker table\ncan be viewed as a psychology lab, where human behavior can be observed and\nquantified. This work provides a preliminary analysis of the role of\nrationality in poker games, using a stylized version of Texas Hold'em. In\nparticular, we compare the performance of two different kinds of players, i.e.,\nrational vs irrational players, during a poker tournament. Results show that\nthese behaviors (i.e., rationality and irrationality) affect both the outcomes\nof challenges and the way poker should be classified.\n", "  We present a fully flavour-covariant formalism for transport phenomena and\napply it to study the flavour-dynamics of Resonant Leptogenesis (RL). We show\nthat this formalism provides a complete and unified description of RL,\nconsistently accounting for three distinct physical phenomena: (i) resonant\nmixing and (ii) coherent oscillations between different heavy-neutrino\nflavours, as well as (iii) quantum decoherence effects in the charged-lepton\nsector. We describe the necessary emergence of higher-rank tensors in flavour\nspace, arising from the unitarity cuts of partial self-energies. Finally,\nwithin a Resonant $\\tau$-Genesis model, we illustrate the importance of this\nformalism by showing that the final lepton asymmetry can vary by as much as an\norder of magnitude between partially flavour-dependent treatments, which do not\ncapture all of the pertinent flavour effects.\n", "  Spectral functions do not fully describe quasielastic electron and neutrino\nscattering from nuclei because they only model the initial state. Final state\ninteractions distort the shape of the differential cross section at the peak\nand increase the cross section at the tails of the distribution. We show that\nthe kinematic distributions predicted by the $\\psi'$ superscaling formalism can\nbe well described with a modified {\\it {effective spectral function}} (ESF). By\nconstruction, models using ESF in combination with the transverse enhancement\ncontribution correctly predict electron QE scattering data. Our values for the\nbinding energy parameter $\\Delta$ are smaller than $\\overline{\\epsilon}$\nextracted within the Fermi gas model from pre 1971 data by Moniz, probably\nbecause these early cross sections were not corrected for coulomb effects.\n", "  We present a selection of recent heavy flavor results from the STAR\nexperiment. Measurements of $D^0$ and $D^*$ meson production in $\\sqrt{s}$=200\nand 500 GeV p+p, as well as in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV d+Au, Au+Au and 193 \\GeV\nU+U collisions are presented and implications on the production mechanism are\ndiscussed. We report on the production and elliptic flow of electrons from\nsemi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons in \\snn{}=39, 62.4 and 200 GeV\nAu+Au collisions. Nuclear modification of $J/\\psi$ production in\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=39, 62.4 and 200 GeV Au+Au, and 193 GeV U+U, and of $\\Upsilon$\nin 200 GeV d+Au, Au+Au, and 193 GeV U+U collisions are compared to theoretical\nmodels. Finally we discuss the prospects of heavy flavor measurements with the\nrecent detector upgrades.\n", "  We present preliminary results of a bayesian fit to the Wilson coefficients\nof the Standard Model gauge invariant dimension-6 operators involving one or\nmore Higgs fields, using data on electroweak precision observables and Higgs\nboson signal strengths.\n", "  The DEAP-3600 experiment is located 2 km underground at SNOLAB, in Sudbury,\nOntario. It is a single-phase detector that searches for dark matter particle\ninteractions within a 1000-kg fiducial mass target of liquid argon. A first\ngeneration prototype detector (DEAP-1) with a 7-kg liquid argon target mass\ndemonstrated a high level of pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) for reducing\n$\\beta$/$\\gamma$ backgrounds and helped to develop low radioactivity techniques\nto mitigate surface-related $\\alpha$ backgrounds. Construction of the DEAP-3600\ndetector is nearly complete and commissioning is starting in 2014. The target\nsensitivity to spin-independent scattering of Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs) on nucleons of 10$^{-46}$ cm$^2$ will allow one order of\nmagnitude improvement in sensitivity over current searches at 100 GeV WIMP\nmass. This paper presents an overview and status of the DEAP-3600 project and\ndiscusses plans for a future multi-tonne experiment, DEAP-50T.\n", "  We establish a connection between gaps problems in Diophantine approximation\nand the frequency spectrum of patches in cut and project sets with special\nwindows. Our theorems provide bounds for the number of distinct frequencies of\npatches of size r, which depend on the precise cut and project sets being used,\nand which are almost always less than a power of log r. Furthermore, for a\nsubstantial collection of cut and project sets we show that the number of\nfrequencies of patches of size r remains bounded as r tends to infinity. The\nlatter result applies to a collection of cut and project sets of full Hausdorff\ndimension.\n", "  We consider the time evolution of quantum states by many-body Schr\\\"odinger\ndynamics and study the rate of convergence of their reduced density matrices in\nthe mean field limit. If the prepared state at initial time is of coherent or\nfactorized type and the number of particles $n$ is large enough then it is\nknown that $1/n$ is the correct rate of convergence at any time. We show in the\nsimple case of bounded pair potentials that the previous rate of convergence\nholds in more general situations with possibly correlated prepared states. In\nparticular, it turns out that the coherent structure at initial time is\nunessential and the important fact is rather the speed of convergence of all\nreduced density matrices of the prepared states. We illustrate our result with\nseveral numerical simulations and examples of multi-partite entangled quantum\nstates borrowed from quantum information.\n", "  We use weak-value amplification to enhance the polarization-sensitive\nfast-light effect from induced Raman absorption in hot rubidium vapor. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that projecting the output signal into an\nappropriate polarization state enables a pulse advancement of 4.2 {\\mu}s, which\nis 15 times larger than that naturally caused by dispersion. More\nsignificantly, we show that combining weak-value amplification with the\ndispersive response of an atomic system provides a clear advantage in terms of\nthe maximum pulse advancement achievable for a given value of loss. This\ntechnique has potential applications for designing novel\nquantum-information-processing gates and optical buffers for telecommunication\nsystems.\n", "  When birds come together to form a flock, the distribution of their\nindividual velocities narrows around the mean velocity of the flock. We argue\nthat, in a broad class of models for the joint distribution of positions and\nvelocities, this narrowing generates an entropic force that opposes the\ncohesion of the flock. The strength of this force depends strongly on the\nnature of the interactions among birds: if birds are coupled to a fixed number\nof neighbors, the entropic forces are weak, while if they couple to all other\nbirds within a fixed distance, the entropic forces are sufficient to tear a\nflock apart. Similar entropic forces should occur in other non-equilibrium\nsystems. For the joint distribution of protein structures and amino-acid\nsequences, these forces favor the occurrence of \"highly designable\" structures.\n", "  We propose a \"feature-scattering\" mechanism to explain the cosmic microwave\nbackground cold spot seen from WMAP and Planck maps. If there are hidden\nfeatures in the potential of multi-field inflation, the inflationary trajectory\ncan be scattered by such features. The scattering is controlled by the amount\nof isocurvature fluctuations, and thus can be considered as a mechanism to\nconvert isocurvature fluctuations into curvature fluctuations. This mechanism\npredicts localized cold spots (instead of hot ones) on the CMB. In addition, it\nmay also bridge a connection between the cold spot and a dip on the CMB power\nspectrum at $\\ell \\sim 20$.\n", "  We study complex Chern-Simons theory on a Seifert manifold $M_3$ by embedding\nit into string theory. We show that complex Chern-Simons theory on $M_3$ is\nequivalent to a topologically twisted supersymmetric theory and its partition\nfunction can be naturally regularized by turning on a mass parameter. We find\nthat the dimensional reduction of this theory to 2d gives the low energy\ndynamics of vortices in four-dimensional gauge theory, the fact apparently\noverlooked in the vortex literature. We also generalize the relations between\n1) the Verlinde algebra, 2) quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian, 3)\nChern-Simons theory on $\\Sigma\\times S^1$ and 4) index of a spin$^c$ Dirac\noperator on the moduli space of flat connections to a new set of relations\nbetween 1) the \"equivariant Verlinde algebra\" for a complex group, 2) the\nequivariant quantum K-theory of the vortex moduli space, 3) complex\nChern-Simons theory on $\\Sigma \\times S^1$ and 4) the equivariant index of a\nspin$^c$ Dirac operator on the moduli space of Higgs bundles.\n", "  Single component pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model has been widely\napplied in multiphase simulation due to its simplicity and stability. In many\nresearch, it has been claimed that this model can be stable for density ratios\nlarger than 1000, however, the application of the model is still limited to\nsmall density ratios when the contact angle is considered. The reason is that\nthe original contact angle adjustment method influences the stability of the\nmodel. Moreover, simulation results in present work show that, by applying the\ncontact angle adjustment method, the density distribution near the wall is\nartificially changed, and the contact angle is dependent on the surface\ntension. Hence, it is very inconvenient to apply this method with a fixed\ncontact angle, and the accuracy of the model cannot be guaranteed. To solve\nthese problems, a contact angle adjustment method based on the geometry\nanalysis is proposed and numerically compared with the original method.\nSimulation results show that, with the new contact angle adjustment method, the\nstability of the model is highly improved when the density ratio is relatively\nlarge, and it is independent of the surface tension.\n", "  We show that the decay of the inflaton field may be incomplete, while\nnevertheless successfully reheating the universe and leaving a stable remnant\nthat accounts for the present dark matter abundance. We note, in particular,\nthat since the mass of the inflaton decay products is field-dependent, one can\nconstruct models, endowed with an appropriate discrete symmetry, where inflaton\ndecay is kinematically forbidden at late times and only occurs during the\ninitial stages of field oscillations after inflation. We show that this is\nsufficient to ensure the transition to a radiation-dominated era and that\ninflaton particles typically thermalize in the process. They eventually\ndecouple and freeze out, yielding a thermal dark matter relic. We discuss\npossible implementations of this generic mechanism within consistent\ncosmological and particle physics scenarios, for both single-field and hybrid\ninflation.\n", "  We present a refined and improved study of the influence of screening on the\neffective fine structure constant of graphene, $\\alpha^*$, as measured in\ngraphite using inelastic x-ray scattering. This follow-up to our previous study\n[J. P. Reed, et al., Science 330, 805 (2010)] was carried out with two times\nbetter energy resolution, five times better momentum resolution, and improved\nexperimental setup with lower background. We compare our results to RPA\ncalculations and evaluate the relative importance of interlayer hopping,\nexcitonic corrections, and screening from high energy excitations involving the\n$\\sigma$ bands. We find that the static, limiting value of $\\alpha^*$ falls in\nthe range 0.25 to 0.35, which is higher than our previous result of 0.14, but\nstill below the value expected from RPA. We show the reduced value is not a\nconsequence of interlayer hopping effects, which were ignored in our previous\nanalysis, but of a combination of excitonic effects in the $\\pi \\rightarrow\n\\pi^*$ particle-hole continuum, and background screening from the\n$\\sigma$-bonded electrons. We find that $\\sigma$-band screening is extremely\nstrong at distances of the order of a few nm, and should be highly effective at\nscreening out short-distance, Hubbard-like interactions in graphene, as well as\nother carbon allotropes.\n", "  In this article, we present a numerical study of the optical properties of a\nmetal nanowire interacting with a localized cavity in a two dimensional\nphotonic crystal. The nature of the modes, their wavelength and width are\ninvestigated as a function of the particle radius. It is shown in particular\nthat a particle with diameter about the lattice constant presents very narrow\nresonances corresponding to hybrid photonic-plasmonic modes, where increased\nlifetime is attributed to the decrease of the radiative losses by interaction\nwith the photonic crystal. These results open interesting applications in areas\nwhere narrow plasmonic resonances are required, as in LSP-resonance based\nbiosensing.\n", "  This review gives an overview of the quantum phase transition (QPT) problem\nin metallic ferromagnets, discussing both experimental and theoretical aspects.\nThese QPTs can be classified with respect to the presence and strength of\nquenched disorder: Clean systems generically show a discontinuous, or\nfirst-order, QPT from the ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic one as a\nfunction of some control parameter, as predicted by theory. Disordered systems\nare much more complicated, depending on the disorder strength and the distance\nfrom the QPT. In many disordered materials the QPT is continuous, or second\norder, and Griffiths-phase effects coexist with QPT singularities near the\ntransition. In other systems the transition from the ferromagnetic state at low\ntemperatures is to a different type of long-range order, such as an\nantiferromagnetic or a spin-density-wave state. In still other materials a\ntransition to a state with glass-like spin dynamics is suspected. The review\nprovides a comprehensive discussion of the current understanding of these\nvarious transitions, and of the relation between experimental and theoretical\ndevelopments.\n", "  We present a probabilistic proof of the mean field limit and propagation of\nchaos $N$-particle systems in three dimensions with positive (Coulomb) or\nnegative (Newton) $1/r$ potentials scaling like $1/N$ and an $N$-dependent\ncut-off which scales like $N^{-1/3+ \\epsilon}$. In particular, for typical\ninitial data, we show convergence of the empirical distributions to solutions\nof the Vlasov-Poisson system with either repulsive electrical or attractive\ngravitational interactions.\n", "  Inertial particles are often observed to be trapped, temporarily or\npermanently, by recirculation cells which are ubiquitous in natural or\nindustrial flows. In the limit of small particle inertia, determining the\nconditions of trapping is a challenging task, as it requires a large number of\nnumerical simulations or experiments to test various particle sizes or\ndensities. Here, we investigate this phenomenon analytically and numerically in\nthe case of heavy particles (e.g. aerosols) at low Reynolds number, to derive a\ntrapping criterion that can be used both in analytical and numerical velocity\nfields. The resulting criterion allows to predict the characteristics of\ntrapped particles as soon as single-phase simulations of the flow are\nperformed. Our analysis is valid for two-dimensional particle-laden flows in\nthe vertical plane, in the limit where the particle inertia, the free-fall\nterminal velocity, and the flow unsteadiness can be treated as perturbations.\nThe weak unsteadiness of the flow generally induces a chaotic tangle near\nheteroclinic or homoclinic cycles if any, leading to the apparent diffusion of\nfluid elements through the boundary of the cell. The critical particle Stokes\nnumber Stc below which aerosols also enter and exit the cell in a complex\nmanner has been derived analytically, in terms of the flow characteristics. It\ninvolves the non-dimensional curvature-weighted integral of the squared\nvelocity of the steady fluid flow along the dividing streamline of the\nrecirculation cell. When the flow is unsteady and St > Stc, a regular motion\ntakes place due to gravity and centrifugal effects, like in the steady case.\nParticles driven towards the interior of the cell are trapped permanently. In\ncontrast, when the flow is unsteady and St < Stc, particles wander in a chaotic\nmanner in the vicinity of the border of the cell, and can escape the cell.\n", "  We report on a scale determination with gradient-flow techniques on the\n$N_f=2+1+1$ highly improved staggered quark ensembles generated by the MILC\nCollaboration. The ensembles include four lattice spacings, ranging from\napproximately 0.15 to 0.06 fm, and both physical and unphysical values of the\nquark masses. The scales $\\sqrt{t_0}/a$ and $w_0/a$ and their tree-level\nimprovements, $\\sqrt{t_{0,{\\rm imp}}}$ and $w_{0,{\\rm imp}}$, are computed on\neach ensemble using Symanzik flow and the cloverleaf definition of the energy\ndensity $E$. Using a combination of continuum chiral-perturbation theory and a\nTaylor-series ansatz for the lattice-spacing and strong-coupling dependence,\nthe results are simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated\nto physical quark masses. We determine the scales $\\sqrt{t_0} =\n0.1416({}_{-5}^{+8})$ fm and $w_0 = 0.1714({}_{-12}^{+15})$ fm, where the\nerrors are sums, in quadrature, of statistical and all systematic errors. The\nprecision of $w_0$ and $\\sqrt{t_0}$ is comparable to or more precise than the\nbest previous estimates, respectively. We then find the continuum mass\ndependence of $\\sqrt{t_0}$ and $w_0$, which will be useful for estimating the\nscales of new ensembles. We also estimate the integrated autocorrelation length\nof $\\langle E(t) \\rangle$. For long flow times, the autocorrelation length of\n$\\langle E \\rangle$ appears to be comparable to that of the topological charge.\n", "  In this article we study an intermediate inflationary model in the context of\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) cosmology caused by a tachyon scalar field.\nConsidering slow-roll inflation we discuss the dynamics of the Universe. Using\nperturbation theory, we estimate some of the model parameters numerically and\ncompare them with the recent results from Planck satellite.\n", "  In the light of the Planck 2015 results, we update simple inflationary models\nbased on the quadratic, quartic, Higgs and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the\ncontext of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world cosmology. Brane-world cosmological\neffect alters the inflationary predictions of the spectral index ($n_s$) and\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) from those obtained in the standard cosmology.\nIn particular, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is enhanced in the presence of the\n5th dimension. In order to maintain the consistency with the Planck 2015\nresults for the inflationary predictions in the standard cosmology, we find a\nlower bound on the five-dimensional Planck mass ($M_5$). On the other hand, the\ninflationary predictions laying outside of the Planck allowed region can be\npushed into the allowed region by the brane-world cosmological effect with a\nsuitable choice of $M_5$.\n", "  Electron-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots plays a significant\nrole in determining the optical properties of excited excitons, especially the\nspectral nature of emitted photons. This paper presents a comprehensive theory\nand analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled\nto structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons, when excited with\nincoherent pump fields. As specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose\na Lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide, which are of current\nexperimental interest. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare\nand contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat\nelectron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian polaron master equation, a\nnon-Markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear\nsusceptibility approach, and we point out the limitations of these models. For\nthe cavity-QED polaron master equation, we give closed form analytical\nsolutions to the phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation\napproximation, fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning and\ncavity dot coupling. We show explicitly why the semiclassical linear\nsusceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon-mediated cavity\nfeeding. For weakly coupled cavities, we calculate the optical spectra using a\nmore general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above\napproaches in the low Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We subsequently use this\ngeneral reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled\nto slow-light photonic crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of\nstriking photon-phonon coupling effects. Our quantum theory can be applied to a\nwide range of photonic structures including photonic molecules and\ncoupled-cavity waveguide systems.\n", "  We confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-539b (aka Kepler object of interest\nK00372.01), a giant transiting exoplanet orbiting a solar-analogue G2 V star.\nThe mass of Kepler-539b was accurately derived thanks to a series of precise\nradial velocity measurements obtained with the CAFE spectrograph mounted on the\nCAHA 2.2m telescope. A simultaneous fit of the radial-velocity data and Kepler\nphotometry revealed that Kepler-539b is a dense Jupiter-like planet with a mass\nof Mp = 0.97 Mjup and a radius of Rp = 0.747 Rjup, making a complete circular\nrevolution around its parent star in 125.6 days. The semi-major axis of the\norbit is roughly 0.5 au, implying that the planet is at roughly 0.45 au from\nthe habitable zone. By analysing the mid-transit times of the 12 transit events\nof Kepler-539b recorded by the Kepler spacecraft, we found a clear modulated\ntransit time variation (TTV), which is attributable to the presence of a planet\nc in a wider orbit. The few timings available do not allow us to precisely\nestimate the properties of Kepler-539c and our analysis suggests that it has a\nmass between 1.2 and 3.6 Mjup, revolving on a very eccentric orbit (0.4<e<0.6)\nwith a period larger than 1000 days. The high eccentricity of planet c is the\nprobable cause of the TTV modulation of planet b. The analysis of the CAFE\nspectra revealed a relatively high photospheric lithium content, A(Li)=2.48\ndex, which, together with both a gyrochronological and isochronal analysis,\nsuggests that the parent star is relatively young.\n", "  We present basic properties of $\\sim$3,300 emission line galaxies detected by\nthe FastSound survey, which are mostly H$\\alpha$ emitters at $z \\sim$ 1.2-1.5\nin the total area of about 20 deg$^2$, with the H$\\alpha$ flux sensitivity\nlimit of $\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{-16} \\rm erg \\ cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ at 4.5 sigma. This\npaper presents the catalogs of the FastSound emission lines and galaxies, which\nwill be open to the public in the near future. We also present basic properties\nof typical FastSound H$\\alpha$ emitters, which have H$\\alpha$ luminosities of\n$10^{41.8}$-$10^{43.3}$ erg/s, SFRs of 20--500 $M_\\odot$/yr, and stellar masses\nof $10^{10.0}$--$10^{11.3}$ $M_\\odot$. The 3D distribution maps for the four\nfields of CFHTLS W1--4 are presented, clearly showing large scale clustering of\ngalaxies at the scale of $\\sim$ 100--600 comoving Mpc. Based on 1,105 galaxies\nwith detections of multiple emission lines, we estimate that contamination of\nnon-H$\\alpha$ lines is about 4% in the single-line emission galaxies, which are\nmostly [OIII]$\\lambda$5007. This contamination fraction is also confirmed by\nthe stacked spectrum of all the FastSound spectra, in which H$\\alpha$,\n[NII]$\\lambda \\lambda$6548,6583, [SII]$\\lambda \\lambda$6717, 6731, and\n[OI]$\\lambda \\lambda$6300,6364 are seen.\n", "  We calculate the baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) dependence of\nthermodynamic observables, i.e., pressure, baryon number density and\nsusceptibility by lattice QCD using the canonical approach. We compare the\nresults with those by the multi parameter reweighting (MPR) method; Both\nmethods give very consistent values in the regions where errors of the MPR are\nunder control. The canonical method gives reliable results over $\\mu_\nB/T=3$,with $T$ being temperature. Multiple precision operations play an\nimportant roll in the evaluation of canonical partition functions.\n", "  We study diffusion of the Josephson phase in the asymmetric SQUID subjected\nto a time-periodic current and pierced by an external magnetic flux. We analyze\na relation between phase diffusion and quality of transport characterized by\nthe dc voltage across the SQUID and efficiency of the device. In doing so, we\nconcentrate on the previously reported regime [J. Spiechowicz and J. {\\L}uczka,\nNew J. Phys. \\textbf{17}, 023054 (2015)] for which efficiency of the SQUID\nattains a global maximum. For long times, the mean-square displacement of the\nphase is a linear function of time, meaning that diffusion is normal. Its\ncoefficient is small indicating rather regular phase evolution. However, it can\nbe magnified \\emph{several times} by tailoring experimentally accessible\nparameters like amplitudes of the ac current or external magnetic flux.\nFinally, we prove that in the deterministic limit this regime is essentially\n\\emph{non-chaotic} and possesses an unexpected simplicity of attractors.\n", "  We examine the electromagnetic fields in the neighbourhood of a \"point\ncharge\" in arbitrary motion and thereby determine the Poynting flux across a\nspherical surface of vanishingly small radius surrounding the charge. We show\nthat the radiative power losses from a point charge turn out to be proportional\nto the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity and the first\ntime-derivative of the acceleration of the charge. This may seem to be in\ndiscordance with the familiar Larmor's formula where the instantaneous power\nradiated from a charge is proportional to the square of acceleration. However,\nit seems that the root cause of the discrepancy actually lies in the Larmor's\nformula which is derived using the acceleration fields but without a due\nconsideration for the Poynting flux associated with the velocity-dependent\nself-fields \"co-moving\" with the charge. Further, while deriving Larmor's\nformula one equates the Poynting flux through a surface at some later time to\nthe radiation loss by the enclosed charge at the retarded time. Poynting's\ntheorem, on the other hand, relates the outgoing radiation flux from a closed\nsurface to the rate of energy decrease within the enclosed volume, all\ncalculated {\\em for the same given instant} only. Here we explicitly show the\nabsence of any Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of an instantly stationary\npoint charge, implying no radiative losses from such a charge, which is in\ncomplete conformity with energy conservation. We further show how Larmor's\nformula is still able to serve our purpose in vast majority of cases. It is\nfurther shown that Larmor's formula in general violates momentum conservation\nand in the case of synchrotron radiation leads to a potentially wrong\nconclusion about the pitch angle changes of the radiating charges, and that\nonly the radiation reaction formula yields a correct result, consistent with\nthe special relativity.\n", "  The annihilation of massive scalar particles in one photon on de Sitter\nexpanding universe is studied, using perturbation theory. The amplitude and\nprobability corresponding to this process is computed using the exact solutions\nof the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell equations on de Sitter geometry. Our results\nshow that the expression of the total probability of photon emission is a\nfunction dependent on the ratio mass/expansion\\, factor. We perform a graphical\nstudy of the total probability in terms of the parameter mass/expansion factor,\nshowing that this effect is significant only in strong gravitational fields. We\nalso obtain that the total probability for this process vanishes in the\nMinkowski limit.\n", "  The Dalgarno's method of perturbation is used to solve the Schrodinger's\nequation with the Cornell potential $V(r)=-\\frac{4\\alpha_s}{3r}+br+c$. The\nshort range and long range effect of the potential is incorporated in the same\nwave function by using two scales $r^S$ and $r^L$ as an integration limit. The\nresults for bounds on r.m.s. radii of various heavy flavored mesons are\nreported. We have also showed the relation between r.m.s. and charge radius of\nmesons.\n", "  Exploiting the correspondence between Wigner distribution function and a\nfrequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) measurement, we experimentally\ndemonstrate existence of the chessboard-like interference patterns with a\ntime-bandwidth product smaller than that of a transform-limited pulse in the\nphase space representation of compass states. Using superpositions of four\nelectric pulses as realization of compass states, we have shown via direct\nmeasurements that displacements leading to orthogonal states can be smaller\nthan limits set by uncertainty relations. In the experiment we observe an\nexactly chronocyclic correspondence to the sub-Planck structure in the\ninterference pattern appearing for superposition of two Sch\\\"{o}dinger-cat-like\nstates in a position-momentum phase space.\n", "  We study diffusion in ratchet systems. As a particular experimental\nrealization we consider an asymmetric SQUID subjected to an external ac current\nand a constant magnetic flux. We analyze mean-square displacement of the\nJosephson phase and find that within selected parameter regimes it evolves in\nthree distinct stages: initially as superdiffusion, next as subdiffusion and\nfinally as normal diffusion in the asymptotic long-time limit. We show how\ncrossover times that separates these stages can be controlled by temperature\nand an external magnetic flux. The first two stages can last many orders longer\nthan characteristic time scales of the system thus being comfortably detectable\nexperimentally. The origin of abnormal behavior is noticeable related to the\nratchet form of the potential revealing an entirely new mechanism of emergence\nof anomalous diffusion. Moreover, a normal diffusion coefficient exhibits\nnon-monotonic dependence on temperature leading to an intriguing phenomenon of\nthermal noise suppressed diffusion. The proposed setup for experimental\nverification of our findings provides a new and promising testing ground for\ninvestigating anomalies in diffusion phenomena.\n", "  A proposal to detect the purported canted antiferromagnet order for the\n$\\nu=0$ quantum Hall state of graphene based on a two-terminal spin transport\nsetup is theoretically discussed. In the presence of a magnetic field normal to\nthe graphene plane, a dynamic and inhomogeneous texture of the N\\'eel vector\nlying within the plane should mediate (nearly dissipationless) superfluid\ntransport of spin angular momentum polarized along the $z$ axis, which could\nserve as a strong support for the canted antiferromagnet scenario. Spin\ninjection and detection can be achieved by coupling two spin-polarized edge\nchannels of the $|\\nu|=2$ quantum Hall state on two opposite ends of the\n$\\nu=0$ region. A simple kinetic theory and Onsager reciprocity are invoked to\nmodel the spin injection and detection processes, and the transport of spin\nthrough the antiferromagnet is accounted for using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nphenomenology.\n", "  Properties of the tensor glueball are discussed in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto\nModel, a top-down holographic approach to the non-perturbative region of\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n", "  A new approach of using distributed transmission line analogy for solving\ntransport equations for ballistic nanostructures is applied for solving the\nthree dimensional problem of the electron transport in gated ballistic\nnanostructures with periodically changing width. The structures with the\nvarying width allow for modulation of the electron drift velocity while keeping\nthe plasma velocity constant. We predict that in such structures biased by a\nconstant current, a periodic modulation of the electron drift velocity due the\nvarying width results in the instability of the plasma waves if the electron\ndrift velocity to plasma wave velocity ratio changes from below to above unity.\nThe physics of such instability is similar to that of the sonic boom, but, in\nthe periodically modulated structures, this analog of the sonic boom is\nrepeated many times leading to a larger increment of the instability. The\nconstant plasma velocity in the sections of different width leads to the\nresonant excitation of the unstable plasma modes with the varying bias current.\nThis effect (that we refer to as the super plasmonic boom condition) results in\na strong enhancement of the instability. The predicted instability involves the\noscillating dipole charge carried by the plasma waves. The plasmons can be\nefficiently coupled to the terahertz (THz) electromagnetic radiation due to the\nperiodic geometry of the gated structure. Our estimates show that the analyzed\ninstability should enable powerful tunable terahertz electronic sources.\n", "  We study the behaviour of ultracold bosonic gas in the critical region above\nthe Bose-Einstein condensation in the presence of an artificial magnetic field,\n$B_\\mathrm{art}$. We show that the condensate fluctuations above the critical\ntemperature $T_c$ cause the fluctuational susceptibility, $\\chi _\\mathrm{fl}$,\nof a uniform gas to have a stronger power-law divergence than in an analogous\nsuperconducting system. Measuring such a divergence opens new ways of exploring\ncritical properties of the ultracold gas and an opportunity of an accurate\ndetermination of $T_c$. We describe a method of measuring $\\chi _\\mathrm{fl}$\nwhich requires a constant gradient in $B_\\mathrm{art}$ and suggest a way of\ncreating such a field in experiment.\n", "  Given two Hilbert spaces, $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$, we introduce an\nabstract unitary operator $U$ on $\\mathcal{H}$ and its discriminant $T$ on\n$\\mathcal{K}$ induced by a coisometry from $\\mathcal{H}$ to $\\mathcal{K}$ and a\nunitary involution on $\\mathcal{H}$. In a particular case, these operators $U$\nand $T$ become the evolution operator of the Szegedy walk on a graph, possibly\ninfinite, and the transition probability operator thereon. We show the spectral\nmapping theorem between $U$ and $T$ via the Joukowsky transform. Using this\nresult, we have completely detemined the spectrum of the Grover walk on the\nSierpi\\'nski lattice, which is pure point and has a Cantor-like structure.\n", "  These two accompanying papers treat two mode entanglement for systems of\nidentical massive bosons and the relationship to spin squeezing and other\nquantum correlation effects. Entanglement is a key quantum feature of composite\nsystems where the probabilities for joint measurements on the composite\nsub-systems are no longer determined from measurement probabilities on the\nseparate sub-systems. We focus on the meaning of entanglement, the quantum\nparadoxes associated with entangled states, and important tests that allow an\nexperimentalist to determine whether a quantum state - in particular, one for\nmassive bosons is entangled. Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the\nsymmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive\nparticles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the\nconclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously\ndemonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).\n  In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of\nidentical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators\nmust satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection\nrules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing\nparticle numbers. We fully justify these requirements. In the second\nquantisation approach, both the system and sub-systems are modes (or sets of\nmodes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different mode\noccupancies.\n  In the accompanying review paper (II), we consider spin squeezing and other\ntests for entanglement for two-mode bosonic systems. Starting from paper (I) we\ndetermine which tests are useful for detecting entanglement in massive bosonic\n(BEC), as opposed to photonic, systems. Several new inequalities are derived,\nand recent key experiments are analysed.\n", "  Globular Clusters (GCs) and Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) are typically\ncomposed by several stellar populations, characterized by different chemical\ncompositions. Different populations show different ages in NSCs but not\nnecessarily in GCs. The youngest populations in NSCs appear to reside in\ndisk-like structures, as observed in our Galaxy and in M31. Gas infall followed\nby formation of second generation (SG) stars in GCs may similarly form\ndisk-like structures in the clusters nuclei. Here we explore this possibility\nand follow the long term evolution of stellar disks embedded in GCs, and study\ntheir effects on the evolution of the clusters. We study disks with different\nmasses by means of detailed N-body simulations and explore their morphological\nand kinematic signatures on the GC structures. We find that as a second\ngeneration disk relaxes, the old, first generation, stellar population flattens\nand becomes more radially anisotropic, making the GC structure become more\nelliptical. The second generation stellar population is characterized by a\nlower velocity dispersion, and a higher rotational velocity, compared with the\nprimordial older population. The strength of these kinematic signatures depends\nboth on the relaxation time of the system and on the fractional mass of the\nsecond generation disk. We therefore conclude that SG populations formed in\nflattened configurations will give rise to two systematic trends: (1) Positive\ncorrelation between GC ellipticity and fraction of SG population (2) Positive\ncorrelation between GC relaxation time and ellipticity. Thereby GC\nellipticities and rotation could be related to the formation of SG stars and\ntheir initial configuration.\n", "  We use analytic (current) density-potential maps of time-dependent (current)\ndensity functional theory (TD(C)DFT) to inverse engineer analytically solvable\ntime-dependent quantum problems. In this approach the driving potential (the\ncontrol signal) and the corresponding solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nare parametrized analytically in terms of the basic TD(C)DFT observables. We\ndescribe the general reconstruction strategy and illustrate it with a number of\nexplicit examples. First we consider the real space one-particle dynamics\ndriven by a time-dependent electromagnetic field and recover, from the general\nTDDFT reconstruction formulas, the known exact solution for a driven oscillator\nwith a time-dependent frequency. Then we use analytic maps of the lattice\nTD(C)DFT to control quantum dynamics in a discrete space. As a first example we\nconstruct a time-dependent potential which generates prescribed dynamics on a\ntight-binding chain. Then our method is applied to the dynamics of spin-1/2\ndriven by a time dependent magnetic field. We design an analytic control pulse\nthat transfers the system from the ground to excited state and vice versa. This\npulse generates the spin flip thus operating as a quantum NOT gate.\n", "  In this paper we consider the issue of paradigm evaluation by applying Bayes'\ntheorem along the following nested hierarchy of progressively more complex\nstructures: i) parameter estimation (within a model), ii) model selection and\ncomparison (within a paradigm), iii) paradigm evaluation. In such a hierarchy\nthe Bayesian evidence works both as the posterior's normalization at a given\nlevel and as the likelihood function at the next level up. Whilst raising no\nobjections to the standard application of the procedure at the two lowest\nlevels, we argue that it should receive a considerable modification when\nevaluating paradigms, when testability and fitting data are equally important.\nBy considering toy models we illustrate how models and paradigms that are\ndifficult to falsify are always favoured by the Bayes factor. We argue that the\nevidence for a paradigm should not only be high for a given dataset, but\nexceptional with respect to what it would have been, had the data been\ndifferent. With this motivation we propose a measure which we term\npredictivity, as well as a prior to be incorporated into the Bayesian\nframework, penalising unpredictivity as much as not fitting data. We apply this\nmeasure to inflation seen as a whole, and to a scenario where a specific\ninflationary model is hypothetically deemed as the only one viable as a result\nof information alien to cosmology (e.g. Solar System gravity experiments, or\nparticle physics input). We conclude that cosmic inflation is currently hard to\nfalsify, but that this could change were external/additional information to\ncosmology to select one of its many models. We also compare this state of\naffairs to bimetric varying speed of light cosmology.\n", "  We study the effect of two simultaneous local quenches on the evolution of\nLoschmidt echo and entanglement entropy of a one dimensional transverse Ising\nmodel. In this work, one of the local quenches involves the connection of two\nspin-1/2 chains at a certain time and the other local quench corresponds to a\nsudden change in the magnitude of the transverse field at a given site in one\nof the spin chains. We numerically calculate the dynamics associated with the\nLoschmidt echo and the entanglement entropy as a result of such double\nquenches, and discuss various timescales involved in this problem using the\npicture of quasiparticles generated as a result of such quenches.\n", "  Refined constraints on chameleon theories are calculated for\natom-interferometry experiments, using a numerical approach consisting in\nsolving for a four-region model the static and spherically symmetric\nKlein-Gordon equation for the chameleon field. By modeling not only the test\nmass and the vacuum chamber but also its walls and the exterior environment,\nthe method allows to probe new effects on the scalar field profile and the\ninduced acceleration of atoms. In the case of a weakly perturbing test mass,\nthe effect of the wall is to enhance the field profile and to lower the\nacceleration inside the chamber by up to one order of magnitude. In the\nthin-shell regime, results are found to be in good agreement with the\nanalytical estimations, when measurements are realized in the immediate\nvicinity of the test mass. Close to the vacuum chamber wall, the acceleration\nbecomes negative and potentially measurable. This prediction could be used to\ndiscriminate between fifth-force effects and systematic experimental\nuncertainties, by doing the experiment at several key positions inside the\nvacuum chamber. For the chameleon potential $V(\\phi) = \\Lambda^{4+\\alpha} /\n\\phi^\\alpha$ and a coupling function $A(\\phi) = \\exp(\\phi /M)$, one finds $M\n\\gtrsim 7 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{GeV}$, independently of the power-law index.\nFor $V(\\phi) = \\Lambda^4 (1+ \\Lambda/ \\phi)$, one finds $M \\gtrsim 10^{14}\n\\mathrm{GeV}$. A sensitivity of $a\\sim 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m/s^2} $ would probe\nthe model up to the Planck scale. Finally, a proposal for a second experimental\nset-up, in a vacuum room, is presented. In this case, Planckian values of $M$\ncould be probed provided that $a \\sim 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m/s^2}$, a limit\nreachable by future experiments. Our method can easily be extended to constrain\nother models with a screening mechanism, such as symmetron, dilaton and f(R)\ntheories.\n", "  Sports are spontaneous generators of stories. Through skill and chance, the\nscript of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out\npossible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a\ngiven sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's\ncapacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with\nrandom walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of\n1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games\nexhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show\nhow coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute\ncomeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with\nbiased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of\nmotifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative\nappeal of real games.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breakings, metal-insulator transitions, and transport\nproperties of magnetic-domain-wall states in pyrochlore iridium oxides are\nstudied by employing a symmetry adapted effective hamiltonian with a slab\nperpendicular to the (111) direction of the pyrochlore lattice. Emergent\nmetallic domain wall, which has unconventional topological nature with a\ncontrollable and mobile metallic layer, is shown to host Fermi surfaces with\nmodulated helical spin textures resembling Rashba metals. The helical nature of\nthe domain-wall Fermi surfaces is experimentally detectable by anomalous Hall\nconductivity, circular dichroism, and optical Hall conductivity under external\nmagnetic fields. Possible applications of the domain-wall metals to\nspin-current generation and \"half-metallic\" conduction are also discussed.\n", "  We study the stability of three-dimensional incompressible Weyl semimetals in\nthe presence of random quenched charge impurities. Combining numerical analysis\nand scaling theory we show that in the presence of sufficiently weak randomness\n(i) Weyl semimetal remains stable, while (ii) double-Weyl semimetal gives rise\nto compressible diffusive metal where the mean density of states at zero energy\nis finite. At stronger disorder, Weyl semimetal undergoes a quantum phase\ntransition and enter into a metallic phase. Mean density of states at zero\nenergy serves as the order parameter and displays single-parameter scaling\nacross such disorder driven quantum phase transition. We numerically determine\nvarious exponents at the critical point, which appear to be insensitive to the\nnumber of Weyl pairs. We also extract the extent of the quantum critical regime\nin disordered Weyl semimetal and the phase diagram of dirty double Weyl\nsemimetal at finite energies.\n", "  The electrical properties of a set of seven-helix transmembrane proteins,\nwhose space arrangement (3D structure) is known, are investigated by using\nregular arrays of the amino acids. These structures, specifically cubes, have\ntopological features similar to those shown by the chosen proteins. The\ntheoretical results show a good agreement between the predicted current-voltage\ncharacteristics obtained from a cubic array and those obtained from a detailed\n3D structure. The agreement is confirmed by available experiments on\nbacteriorhodopsin. Furthermore, all the analyzed proteins are found to share\nthe same critical behaviour of the voltage-dependent conductance and of its\nvariance. In particular, the cubic arrangement evidences a short plateau of the\nexcess conductance and its variance at high voltages. The results of the\npresent investigation show the possibility to predict the I-V characteristics\nof multiple-protein sample even in the absence of a detailed knowledge of their\n3D structure.\n", "  A magnetic field applied to type-II superconductors introduces quantized\nvortices that locally quench superconductivity, providing a unique opportunity\nto investigate electronic orders that may compete with superconductivity. This\nis especially true in cuprate superconductors in which mutual relationships\namong superconductivity, pseudogap, and broken-spatial-symmetry states have\nattracted much attention. Here we observe energy and momentum dependent\nbipartite electronic superstructures in the vortex core of\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ using spectroscopic-imaging scanning\ntunneling microscopy (SI-STM). In the low-energy range where the nodal\nBogoliubov quasiparticles are well-defined, we show that the quasiparticle\nscattering off vortices generates the electronic superstructure known as\n\"vortex checkerboard\". In the high-energy region where the pseudogap develops,\nvortices amplify the broken-spatial-symmetry patterns that preexist in zero\nfield. These data reveal canonical d-wave superconductivity near the node, yet\ncompetition between superconductivity and broken-spatial-symmetry states near\nthe antinode.\n", "  We show that for a general four derivative theory of gravity, only the\nholographic entanglement entropy functionals obey the second law at linearized\norder in perturbations. We also derive bounds on the higher curvature couplings\nin several examples, demanding the validity of the second law for higher order\nperturbations. For the five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory in the context of\nAdS/CFT, the bound arising from black branes coincides with there being no\nsound channel instability close to the horizon. Repeating the analysis for\ntopological black holes, the bound coincides with the tensor channel causality\nconstraint (which is responsible for the viscosity bound). Furthermore, we show\nhow to recover the holographic c-theorems in higher curvature theories from\nsimilar considerations based on the Raychaudhuri equation.\n", "  In the context of Gross-Pitaevskii theory, we investigate the unconventional\nBose-Einstein condensations in the two-species mixture with $p$-wave symmetry\nin the second band of a bipartite optical lattice. A new imaginary-time\npropagation method is developed to numerically determine the $p$-orbital\ncondensation. Different from the single-species case, the two-species boson\nmixture exhibits two non-equivalent complex condensates in the\nintraspecies-interaction-dominating regime, exhibiting the vortex-antivortex\nlattice configuration in the charge and spin channels, respectively. When the\ninterspecies interaction is tuned across the SU(2) invariant point, the system\nundergoes a quantum phase transition toward a checkerboard-like spin density\nwave state with a real-valued condensate wavefunction. The influence of lattice\nasymmetry on the quantum phase transition is addressed. Finally, we present a\nphase-sensitive measurement scheme for experimentally detecting the UBEC in our\nmodel.\n", "  We have measured the response of a torsional oscillator containing\npolycrystalline hcp solid $^{4}$He to applied steady rotation in an attempt to\nverify the observations of several other groups that were initially interpreted\nas evidence for macroscopic quantum effects. The geometry of the cell was that\nof a simple annulus, with a fill line of relatively narrow diameter in the\ncentre of the torsion rod. Varying the angular velocity of rotation up to\n2\\,rad\\,s$^{-1}$ showed that there were no step-like features in the resonant\nfrequency or dissipation of the oscillator and no history dependence, even\nthough we achieved the sensitivity required to detect the various effects seen\nin earlier experiments on other rotating cryostats. All small changes during\nrotation were consistent with those occurring with an empty cell. We thus\nobserved no effects on the samples of solid $^4$He attributable to steady\nrotation.\n", "  We study the structural evolution of Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ as a function of\npressure using x-ray diffraction. At a pressure of 54 GPa at room temperature,\nwe observe a first-order structural phase transition, associated with a change\nfrom tetragonal to monoclinic symmetry, and accompanied by a 4% volume\ncollapse. Rietveld refinement of the high-pressure phase reveals a novel\nmodification of the Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which adopts an altered\nstacking sequence of the perovskite bilayers. As the positions of the oxygen\natoms could not be reliably refined from the data, we use density functional\ntheory (local-density approximation+$U$+spin orbit) to optimize the crystal\nstructure, and to elucidate the electronic and magnetic properties of\nSr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ at high pressure. In the low-pressure tetragonal phase, we\nfind that the in-plane rotation of the IrO$_6$ octahedra increases with\npressure. The calculations further indicate that a bandwidth-driven\ninsulator-metal transition occurs at $\\sim$20 GPa, along with a quenching of\nthe magnetic moment. In the high-pressure monoclinic phase, structural\noptimization resulted in complex tilting and rotation of the oxygen octahedra,\nand strongly overlapping $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ bands. The $t_{2g}$ bandwidth\nrenders both the spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations ineffectual in\nopening an electronic gap, resulting in a robust metallic state for the\nhigh-pressure phase of Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$.\n", "  We introduce a new method for treating Comptonization in computational fluid\ndynamics. By construction, this method conserves the number of photons. Whereas\nthe traditional \"blackbody Comptonization\" approach assumes that the radiation\nis locally a perfect blackbody and therefore uses a single parameter, the\nradiation temperature, to describe the radiation, the new \"photon-conserving\nComptonization\" approach treats the photon gas as a Bose-Einstein fluid and\nkeeps track of both the radiation temperature and the photon number density. We\nhave implemented photon-conserving Comptonization in the general relativistic\nradiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL and we describe its impact on\nsimulations of mildly super-critical black hole accretion disks. We find that\nblackbody Comptonization underestimates the gas and radiation temperature by up\nto a factor of two compared to photon-conserving Comptonization. This\ndiscrepancy could be serious when computing spectra. The photon-conserving\nsimulation indicates that the spectral color correction factor of the escaping\nradiation in the funnel region of the disk could be as large as 5.\n", "  Symmetry-protected topological phases (SPT) are short-range entangled gapped\nstates protected by global symmetry. Nontrivial SPT phases cannot be\nadiabatically connected to the trivial disordered state(or atomic insulator) as\nlong as certain global symmetry $G$ is unbroken. At low energies, most of\ntwo-dimensional SPTs with Abelian symmetry can be described by topological\nquantum field theory (TQFT) of multi-component Chern-Simons type. However, in\ncontrast to the fractional quantum Hall effect where TQFT can give rise to\ninteresting bulk anyons, TQFT for SPTs only supports trivial bulk excitations.\nThe essential question in TQFT descriptions for SPTs is to understand how the\nglobal symmetry is implemented in the partition function. In this paper, we\nsystematically study TQFT of three-dimensional SPTs with unitary Abelian\nsymmetry (e.g., $\\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\\times\\cdots$). In\naddition to the usual multi-component $BF$ topological term at level-$1$, we\nfind that there are new topological terms with quantized coefficients (e.g.,\n$a^1\\wedge a^2\\wedge d a^2$ and $a^1\\wedge a^2\\wedge a^3\\wedge a^4$) in TQFT\nactions, where $a^{1},a^2,\\cdots$ are 1-form U(1) gauge fields. These\nadditional topological terms cannot be adiabatically turned off as long as $G$\nis unbroken. By investigating symmetry transformations for the TQFT partition\nfunction, we end up with the classification of SPTs that is consistent with the\nwell-known group cohomology approach. We also discuss how to gauge the global\nsymmetry and possible TQFT descriptions of Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory.\n", "  We present a field formulation for defects that draws from the classical\nrepresentation of the cores as force dipoles. We write these dipoles as\nsingular distributions. Exploiting the key insight that the variational setting\nis the only appropriate one for the theory of distributions, we arrive at\nuniversally applicable weak forms for defects in nonlinear elasticity.\nRemarkably, the standard, Galerkin finite element method yields numerical\nsolutions for the elastic fields of defects that, when parameterized suitably,\nmatch very well with classical, linearized elasticity solutions. The true\npotential of our approach, however, lies in its easy extension to generate\nsolutions to elastic fields of defects in the regime of nonlinear elasticity,\nand even more notably for Toupin's theory of gradient elasticity at finite\nstrains(Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 11, 385, 1962). In computing these solutions we\nadopt recent numerical work on an isogeometric analytic framework that enabled\nthe first three-dimensional solutions to general boundary value problems of\nToupin's theory (Rudraraju et al. Comp. Meth. App. Mech. Engr., 278, 705,\n2014). We first present exhaustive solutions to point defects, edge and screw\ndislocations, and a study on the energetics of interacting dislocations. Then,\nto demonstrate the generality and potential of our treatment, we apply it to\nother complex dislocation configurations, including loops and low-angle grain\nboundaries.\n", "  By analysing K2 short-cadence observations we detect starspots on WASP-85A,\nthe host star of the hot Jupiter WASP-85Ab. The detection of recurring starspot\noccultation events indicates that the planet's orbit is aligned with the star's\nrotational axis ($\\lambda<14^{\\circ}$) and suggests a stellar rotational period\nof $15.1 \\pm 0.6$ d. The K2 lightcurve reveals a rotational modulation with a\nperiod of $13.6 \\pm 1.6$ d, consistent with the period determined from\nstarspots. There are no significant transit-timing variations and thus no\nevidence of any additional planet in the system. Given the pronounced\nrotational modulation we are only able to place an upper limit of 100 parts per\nmillion for any phase-curve modulations and the secondary eclipse.\n", "  Using the recently developed polarization tensor in (2+1) dimensions for the\nelectronic excitations of graphene, we investigate the influence of temperature\non the surface plasmons on graphene. We consider non-zero mass gap, but zero\nchemical potential. Plasmons may exist for both polarizations, TE and TM, of\nthe electromagnetic field. For TE, the momentum region, where the dispersion\nfunction is real, appears bounded from below, whereas for TM it is bounded from\nabove. We discuss the similarities of these features with those found\npreviously in the case with non-zero chemical potential, but zero temperature.\n", "  Nature of the fractional quantum Hall state at Landau level filling factor\n5/2 remains elusive despite intensive experimental and theoretical work. While\nthe leading theoretical candidates are Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) and its\nparticle-hole conjugate anti-Pfaffian (APf), neither received unambiguous\nexperimental support. We show that a state that is intermediate between them,\nmade of alternating stripes of Pf and APf in the bulk, is a viable candidate.\nSuch a state is shown to be incompressible and thus a charge insulator in the\nbulk, but a heat conductor due to the presence of gapless neutral bulk modes.\nWe argue that properties of such a state is consistent with existing numerical\nand experimental work, and discuss possible experimental probes of its\npresence.\n", "  Searching for the signature of the violation of chiral charge conservation in\nsolids has inspired a growing passion on the magneto-transport in topological\nsemimetals. One of the open questions is how the conductivity depends on\nmagnetic fields in a semimetal phase when the Fermi energy crosses the Weyl\nnodes. Here, we study both the longitudinal and transverse magnetoconductivity\nof a topological Weyl semimetal near the Weyl nodes with the help of a two-node\nmodel that includes all the topological semimetal properties. In the semimetal\nphase, the Fermi energy crosses only the 0th Landau bands in magnetic fields.\nFor a finite potential range of impurities, it is found that both the\nlongitudinal and transverse magnetoconductivity are positive and linear at the\nWeyl nodes, leading to an anisotropic and negative magnetoresistivity. The\nlongitudinal magnetoconductivity depends on the potential range of impurities.\nThe longitudinal conductivity remains finite at zero field, even though the\ndensity of states vanishes at the Weyl nodes. This work establishes a relation\nbetween the linear magnetoconductivity and the intrinsic topological Weyl\nsemimetal phase.\n", "  The adiabatic connection formula of ground-state density functional theory\nrelates the correlation energy to a coupling-constant integral over a purely\npotential contribution, and is widely used to understand and improve\napproximations. The corresponding formula for thermal density functional theory\nis cast as an integral over temperatures instead, ranging upward from the\nsystem's physical temperature. We also show how to relate different different\ncorrelation components to each other, either in terms of temperature- or\ncoupling-constant integrations. We illustrate our results on the uniform\nelectron gas.\n", "  The distribution of particles inside hadronic jets produced in the decay of\nboosted $W$ and $Z$ bosons can be used to discriminate such jets from the\ncontinuum background. Given that a jet has been identified as likely resulting\nfrom the hadronic decay of a boosted $W$ or $Z$ boson, this paper presents a\ntechnique for further differentiating $Z$ bosons from $W$ bosons. The variables\nused are jet mass, jet charge, and a b-tagging discriminant. A likelihood\ntagger is constructed from these variables and tested in the simulation of\n$W'\\rightarrow WZ$ for bosons in the transverse momentum range 200 GeV\n$<p_{T}<$ 400 GeV in $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector\nat the LHC. For $Z$-boson tagging efficiencies of $\\epsilon_Z=$ 90%, 50%, and\n10%, one can achieve $W^+$-boson tagging rejection factors ($1/\\epsilon_{W^+}$)\nof 1.7, 8.3 and 1000, respectively. It is not possible to measure these\nefficiencies in the data due to the lack of a pure sample of high $p_{T}$,\nhadronically decaying $Z$ bosons. However, the modelling of the tagger inputs\nfor boosted $W$ bosons is studied in data using a $t\\bar{t}$-enriched sample of\nevents in 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. The inputs are well\nmodelled within uncertainties, which builds confidence in the expected tagger\nperformance.\n", "  We propose a new protocol for thr manipulation of a three-level artificial\natom in Lambda ($\\Lambda$) configuration in the absence of a direct pump\ncoupling. It allows faithful, selective and robust population transfer\nanalogous to stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ($\\Lambda$-STIRAP), in highly\nnoise protected superconducting artificial atoms. It combines the use of a\ntwo-photon pump pulse with suitable advanced control, operated by a slow\nmodulation of the phase of the external fields, leveraging on the stability of\nsemiclassical microwave drives. This protocol is a building block for novel\ntasks in complex quantum architectures. Its demonstration would be a benchmark\nfor the implementation of a class of multilevel advanced control procedures for\nquantum computation and microwave quantum photonics in systems based on\nartificial atoms.\n", "  Observations of quasars at $ z > 6$ suggest the presence of black holes with\na few times $\\rm 10^9 ~M_{\\odot}$. Numerous models have been proposed to\nexplain their existence including the direct collapse which provides massive\nseeds of $\\rm 10^5~M_{\\odot}$. The isothermal direct collapse requires a strong\nLyman-Werner flux to quench $\\rm H_2$ formation in massive primordial halos. In\nthis study, we explore the impact of trace amounts of metals and dust\nenrichment. We perform three dimensional cosmological simulations for two halos\nof $\\rm > 10^7~M_{\\odot}$ with $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot}= 10^{-4}-10^{-6}$ illuminated\nby an intense Lyman Werner flux of $\\rm J_{21}=10^5$. Our results show that\ninitially the collapse proceeds isothermally with $\\rm T \\sim 8000$ K but dust\ncooling becomes effective at densities of $\\rm 10^{8}-10^{12} ~cm^{-3}$ and\nbrings the gas temperature down to a few 100-1000 K for $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot} \\geq\n10^{-6}$. No gravitationally bound clumps are found in $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot} \\leq\n10^{-5}$ cases by the end of our simulations in contrast to the case with $\\rm\nZ/Z_{\\odot} = 10^{-4}$. Large inflow rates of $\\rm \\geq 0.1~M_{\\odot}/yr$ are\nobserved for $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot} \\leq 10^{-5}$ similar to a zero-metallicity case\nwhile for $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot} = 10^{-4}$ the inflow rate starts to decline earlier\ndue to the dust cooling and fragmentation. For given large inflow rates a\ncentral star of $\\rm \\sim 10^4~M_{\\odot}$ may form for $\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot} \\leq\n10^{-5}$.\n", "  Pressure induced interaction between core electrons, the core level crossing\n(CLC) transition has been observed in hcp Os at P~400 GPa [L. Dubrovinksy, et\nal., Nature 525, 226-229 (2015)]. In this work, we carry out a systematic study\nof the influence of pressure on the electronic structure in all metals of the\n5d series (Hf,Ta,W,Re,Os,Ir,Pt,Au) using first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations. We have found that CLC is a general effect for this series of\nmetals. While in Pt it occurs at ~1500 GPa, at a pressure substantially higher\nthan in Os, in Ir it occurs already at 80 GPa. Moreover, we predict that in Re\nthe CLC transition may appear at ambient pressure. We analyze the shifts of the\nCLC transition pressure across the series within the Thomas-Fermi model, and\nshow that the effect has many common features to the atomic collapse in the\nrare-earth elements.\n", "  We describe the details of the binned bispectrum estimator as used for the\nofficial 2013 and 2015 analyses of the temperature and polarization CMB maps\nfrom the ESA Planck satellite. The defining aspect of this estimator is the\ndetermination of a map bispectrum (3-point correlator) that has been binned in\nharmonic space. For a parametric determination of the non-Gaussianity in the\nmap (the so-called fNL parameters), one takes the inner product of this binned\nbispectrum with theoretically motivated templates. However, as a complementary\napproach one can also smooth the binned bispectrum using a variable smoothing\nscale in order to suppress noise and make coherent features stand out above the\nnoise. This allows one to look in a model-independent way for any statistically\nsignificant bispectral signal. This approach is useful for characterizing the\nbispectral shape of the galactic foreground emission, for which a theoretical\nprediction of the bispectral anisotropy is lacking, and for detecting a\nserendipitous primordial signal, for which a theoretical template has not yet\nbeen put forth. Both the template-based and the non-parametric approaches are\ndescribed in this paper.\n", "  Cosmic inflation is commonly assumed to be driven by quantum fields. Quantum\nmechanics predicts phenomena such as quantum fluctuations and tunneling of the\nfield. Here we show an example of a quantum interference effect which goes\nbeyond the semi-classical treatment and which may be of relevance in the early\nuniverse. We study the quantum coherent dynamics for a tilted, periodic\npotential, which results in genuine quantum oscillations of the inflaton field,\nanalogous to Bloch oscillations in condensed matter and atomic systems. Our\nresults show that quantum interference phenomena may be of relevance in\ncosmology.\n", "  The influence of disorder, both structural (non-diagonal) and on-site\n(diagonal), is studied through the inhomogeneous Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)\ntheory in narrow-band disordered superconductors with a view towards\nunderstanding superconductivity in boron doped diamond (BDD) and boron- doped\nnanocrystalline diamond (BNCD) films. We employ the attractive Hubbard model\nwithin the mean field approximation, including the Coulomb interaction between\nholes in the narrow acceptor band. We study substitutional boron incorporation\nin a triangular lattice, with disorder in the form of random potential\nfluctuations at the boron sites. The role of structural disorder was studied\nthrough non-uniform variation of the tight-binding coupling parameter where,\nfollowing ex- perimental findings, we incorporate the concurrent increase in\nstructural disorder with increasing boron concentration. We illustrate stark\ndifferences between the effects of structural and on-site disorder and show\nthat structural disorder has a much greater effect on the density of states,\nmean pairing amplitude and superfluid density than on-site potential disorder.\nWe show that structural disorder can increase the mean pairing amplitude while\nthe spectral gap in the density of states decreases with states eventually\nappearing within the spectral gap for high levels of disorder. This study\nillustrates how the effects of structural disorder can explain some of the\nfeatures found in superconducting BDD and BNCD films such as a tendency towards\nsaturation of the T_{c} with boron doping and deviations from the expected BCS\ntheory in the temperature dependence of the pairing amplitude and spectral gap.\n", "  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are promising targets for the indirect\ndetection of dark matter through gamma-ray emission due to their proximity,\nlack of astrophysical backgrounds and high dark matter density. They are often\nused to place restrictive bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section.\nIn this paper, we analyze six years of {\\it Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray data from 19\ndSphs that are satellites of the Milky Way, and derive from a stacked analysis\nof 15 dSphs, robust 95\\% confidence level lower limits on the dark matter\nlifetime for several decay channels and dark matter masses between $\\sim 1$GeV\nand $10$TeV. Our findings are based on a bin-by-bin maximum likelihood analysis\ntreating the J-factor as a nuisance parameter using PASS 8 event-class. Our\nconstraints from this ensemble are among the most stringent and solid in the\nliterature, and competitive with existing ones coming from the extragalactic\ngamma-ray background, galaxy clusters, AMS-02 cosmic ray data, Super-K and\nICECUBE neutrino data, while rather insensitive to systematic uncertainties. In\nparticular, among gamma-ray searches, we improve existing limits for dark\nmatter decaying into $\\bar{b}b$, ($\\mu^+\\mu^-$) for DM masses below $\\sim 30\\,\n(200)$~GeV, demonstrating that dSphs are compelling targets for constraining\ndark matter decay lifetimes.\n", "  Searches for dark matter (DM) constituents are presently mainly focused on\naxions and WIMPs despite the fact that far higher mass constituents are viable.\nWe discuss and dispute whether axions exist and those arguments for WIMPs which\narise from electroweak supersymmetry. We focus on the highest possible masses\nand argue that, since if they constitute all DM they cannot be baryonic, they\nmust uniquely be primordial black holes. Observational constraints require them\nto be of intermediate masses mostly between a hundred and a hundred thousand\nsolar masses. Known search strategies include wide binaries, CMB distortion\nand, most promisingly, extended microlensing experiments.\n", "  Matter Neutrino Resonances (MNRs) can drastically modify neutrino flavor\nevolution in astrophysical environments and may significantly impact\nnucleosynthesis. Here we further investigate the underlying physics of MNR type\nflavor transitions. We provide generalized resonance conditions and make\nanalytical predictions for the behavior of the system. We discuss the adiabatic\nevolution of these transitions, considering both Symmetric and Standard\nscenarios. Symmetric MNR transitions differ from Standard MNR transitions in\nthat both neutrinos and antineutrinos can completely transform to other flavors\nsimultaneously. We provide an example of the simplest system in which such\ntransitions can occur with a neutrino and an antineutrino having a single\nenergy and emission angle. We further apply linearized stability analysis to\npredict the location of self-induced nutation type (or bipolar) oscillations\ndue to neutrino-neutrino interactions in the regions where MNR is ineffective.\nIn all cases, we compare our analytical predictions to numerical calculations.\n", "  We propose a quantum algorithm for solving the following problem: given the\nHamiltonian of a physical system and one of its eigenvalues, how to obtain the\ncorresponding eigenstate? The algorithm is based on the resonance phenomena.\nFor a probe qubit coupled to a quantum system, the system exhibits a resonance\ndynamics when the frequency of the probe qubit matches a transition frequency\nin the system. Therefore the system can be guided to evolve to the eigenstate\nwith known eigenvalue by inducing resonance between the probe qubit and a\ndesigned transition in the system. This algorithm can also be used to obtain\nthe energy spectrum of a physical system and can achieve even a quadratic\nspeedup over the phase estimation algorithm.\n", "  The IceCube telescope has detected diffuse neutrino emission, 20 events of\nwhich were reported to be above 60~TeV. In this paper, we fit the diffuse\nneutrino spectrum using Poisson statistics, which are the most appropriate for\nthe low counts per energy bin. We extend the fitted energy range and exploit\nthe fact that no neutrinos were detected above 2~PeV, despite the high detector\nsensitivity around the Glashow resonance at 6.3\\,PeV and beyond. A best-fit\npower-law slope of $\\alpha=2.9\\pm 0.3$ is found with no evidence for a\nhigh-energy cutoff. This slope is steeper than $\\alpha=2.3\\pm 0.3$ found by the\nIceCube team using a different fitting method. Such a steep spectrum\nfacilitates the identification of high energy ($\\gg$ PeV) neutrinos, if\ndetected, to be due to the GZK effect of cosmic-ray protons interacting with\nthe Extragalactic Background Light. We use the ratio of EeV to PeV neutrinos in\nGZK models to show that the currently detected PeV neutrinos could not be due\nto the GZK effect, because this would imply many more higher-energy neutrinos\nthat should have been detected, but were not. The non-detection of GZK\nneutrinos by IceCube despite more than essentially 1200 observing days, has\nalready ruled out (at 95\\% confidence) models that predict rates of $\\sim1$\nneutrino/yr or more. We use this non-detection to quantify the confidence at\nwhich GZK models are ruled out, and compute the additional IceCube and (in the\nfuture) ARA observing time that would rule them out with 95\\% confidence if no\ndetection is made.\n", "  The unitarization of the longitudinal vector boson scattering (VBS) cross\nsection by the Higgs boson is a fundamental prediction of the Standard Model\nwhich has not been experimentally verified. One of the most promising ways to\nmeasure VBS uses events containing two leptonically-decaying\nsame-electric-charge $W$ bosons produced in association with two jets. However,\nthe angular distributions of the leptons in the $W$ boson rest frame, which are\ncommonly used to fit polarization fractions, are not readily available in this\nprocess due to the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. In this paper\nwe present a method to alleviate this problem by using a deep machine learning\ntechnique to recover these angular distributions from measurable event\nkinematics and demonstrate how the longitudinal-longitudinal scattering\nfraction could be studied. We show that this method doubles the expected\nsensitivity when compared to previous proposals.\n", "  By means of first principles calculations we investigate the nature of\nexchange coupling in ferromagnetic bcc Fe on a microscopic level. Analyzing the\nbasic electronic structure reveals a drastic difference between the $3d$\norbitals of $E_g$ and $T_{2g}$ symmetries. The latter ones define the shape of\nthe Fermi surface, while the former ones form weakly-interacting impurity\nlevels. We demonstrate that, as a result of this, in Fe the $T_{2g}$ orbitals\nparticipate in exchange interactions, which are only weakly dependent on the\nconfiguration of the spin moments and thus can be classified as\nHeisenberg-like. These couplings are shown to be driven by Fermi surface\nnesting. In contrast, for the $E_g$ states the Heisenberg picture breaks down,\nsince the corresponding contribution to the exchange interactions is shown to\nstrongly depend on the reference state they are extracted from. Our analysis of\nthe nearest-neighbour coupling indicates that the interactions among $E_g$\nstates are mainly proportional to the corresponding hopping integral and thus\ncan be attributed to be of double-exchange origin.\n", "  Optical frequency conversion has applications ranging from tunable light\nsources to telecommunications-band interfaces for quantum information science.\nHere, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise frequency conversion on a\nnanophotonic chip through four-wave-mixing Bragg scattering in compact\n(footprint < 0.5 x 10^-4 cm^2) Si3N4 microring resonators. We investigate three\nfrequency conversion configurations: (1) spectral translation over a few\nnanometers within the 980 nm band, (2) upconversion from 1550 nm to 980 nm, and\n(3) downconversion from 980 nm to 1550 nm. With conversion efficiencies ranging\nfrom 25 % for the first process to > 60 % for the last two processes, a signal\nconversion bandwidth > 1 GHz, < 60 mW of continuous-wave pump power needed, and\nbackground noise levels between a few fW and a few pW, these devices are\nsuitable for quantum frequency conversion of single photon states from InAs\nquantum dots. Simulations based on coupled mode equations and the\nLugiato-Lefever equation are used to model device performance, and show\nquantitative agreement with measurements.\n", "  We consider two ultracold particles confined in spherically symmetric\nharmonic trap and interacting via isotropic potential with absorbing boundary\nconditions at short range that models reactive scattering. First, we apply the\ncontact pseudopotential with complex scattering length and investigate the\nproperties of eigenergies and eigenfunctions for different trap states as a\nfunction of real and imaginary part of the scattering length. In the analyzed\ncase the eigenenergies take complex values, and their imaginary part can be\ninterpreted in terms of decay rates. Then we introduce the model of a square\nwell with absorbing boundary conditions that is later used to investigate the\neffects of the finite range of interaction on the properties of a reactive\nscattering in the trap. Finally, we analyze the decay rates for some reactive\nalkali dimer molecules assuming short-range probability of reaction equal to\nunity. In this case the complex scattering length is given by universal value\nrelated to the mean scattering length of van der Waals interaction between\nmolecules.\n", "  We consider five-dimensional AdS-axion-dilaton gravity with a Gauss-Bonnet\nterm and use a black brane solution displaying spatial anisotropy as the\ngravity dual of a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma. We compute several\nobservables relevant to the study of the plasma, namely, the drag force, the\njet quenching parameter, the quarkonium potential and the thermal photon\nproduction. The effects of higher derivative corrections and of the anisotropy\nare discussed and compared with previous results.\n", "  Recently, West and Fong [New J. Phys. 14, 083002 (2012)] introduced an echo\nscheme for an exchange-only qubit, which relies entirely on the\nexchange-interaction. Here, we compare two different exchange-based sequences\nand two optimization strategies, Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) and optimized\nfilter function dynamical decoupling (OFDD), which were introduced for a\nsingle-spin qubit and are applied in this paper to the three-spin exchange-only\nqubit. The calculation shows that the adaption of the optimization concepts can\nbe achieved by straight-forward calculation. We consider two types of noise\nspectra, Lorentzian and Ohmic noise. For both spectra, the results reveal a\nslight dependence of the performance on the choice of the echo sequence.\n", "  We show how the $q^2$-dependence of the triple Higgs boson HHH form factor\ncan reveal the presence of various types of new physics contributions, like new\nparticles coupled to the Higgs boson or Higgs boson constituents, without\ndirectly observing them. We compare the effect of such new contributions to the\none of higher order SM corrections to the point-like HHH coupling, due to\ntriangle, 4-leg and s.e. diagrams. We establish simple analytic expressions\ndescribing accurately at high energy these SM corrections, as well as the\nexamples of new physics contributions.\n", "  We study the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model on a layered triangular lattice by means of a numerical\ncluster mean-field method with a scaling scheme (CMF+S). It has been known that\nantiferromagnetic spins on a two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice with\nquantum fluctuations exhibit a one-third magnetization plateau in the\nmagnetization curve under magnetic field. We demonstrate that the CMF+S\nquantitatively reproduces the magnetization curve including the stabilization\nof the plateau. {We also discuss the effects of a finite interlayer coupling,\nwhich is unavoidable in real quasi-2D materials. It has been recently argued\nfor a model of the layered-triangular-lattice compound Ba3CoSb2O9 that such\ninterlayer coupling can induce an additional first-order transition at a strong\nfield. We present the detailed CMF+S results for the magnetization and\nsusceptibility curves of the fundamental Heisenberg Hamiltonian in the presence\nof magnetic field and weak antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. The extra\nfirst-order transition appears as a quite small jump in the magnetization curve\nand a divergence in the susceptibility at a strong magnetic field ~ 0.712 of\nthe saturation field.\n", "  We review the Reshetikhin-Turaev approach to construction of non-compact knot\ninvariants involving R-matrices associated with infinite-dimensional\nrepresentations, primarily those made from Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm. The\ncorresponding formulas can be obtained from modular transformations of\nconformal blocks as their Kontsevich-Soibelman monodromies and are presented in\nthe form of transcendental integrals, where the main issue is manipulation with\nintegration contours. We discuss possibilities to extract more explicit and\nhandy expressions which can be compared with the ordinary (compact) knot\npolynomials coming from finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie\nalgebras, with their limits and properties. In particular, the quantum\nA-polynomials, difference equations for colored Jones polynomials should be the\nsame, just in non-compact case the equations are homogeneous, while they have a\nnon-trivial right-hand side for ordinary Jones polynomials.\n", "  We investigate the formation of metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) at the\ncenter of two dark matter halos with $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim4\\times10^7 M_\\odot$ at\n$z>10$ using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We find that\nvery compact ($\\lesssim$ 1 pc) and massive ($\\sim6\\times10^5 M_\\odot$) clusters\nform rapidly when pristine gas collapses isothermally with the aid of efficient\nLy$\\alpha$ emission during the transition from molecular-cooling halos to\natomic-cooling halos. Because the local free-fall time of dense star-forming\ngas is very short ($\\ll 1\\,{\\rm Myr}$), a large fraction of the collapsed gas\nis turned into stars before stellar feedback processes blow out the gas and\nshut down star formation. Although the early stage of star formation is limited\nto a small region of the central star-forming disk, we find that the disk\nquickly fragments due to metal enrichment from supernovae. Sub-clusters formed\nin the fragmented clouds eventually merge with the main cluster at the center.\nThe simulated clusters closely resemble the local GCs in mass and size but show\na metallicity spread that is much wider than found in the local GCs. We discuss\na role of pre-enrichment by Pop III and II stars as a potential solution to the\nlatter issue. Although not without shortcomings, it is encouraging that a naive\nblind (not tuned) cosmological simulation presents a possible channel for the\nformation of at least some massive GCs.\n", "  A large fraction of the dwarf satellites orbiting the Andromeda galaxy are\nsurprisingly aligned in a thin, extended and apparently kinematically coherent\nplanar structure. Such a structure is not easily found in simulations based on\nthe Cold Dark Matter model ({\\Lambda}CDM). Using 21 high resolution\ncosmological simulations we analyse the kinematics of planes of satellites\nsimilar to the one around Andromeda. We find good agreement when co-rotation is\ncharacterized by the line-of-sight velocity. At the same time, when co-rotation\nis inferred by the angular momenta of the satellites, the planes are in\nagreement with the plane around our Galaxy. We find such planes to be common in\nour high concentration haloes. The number of co-rotating satellites obtained\nfrom the sign of the line-of-sight velocity shows large variations depending on\nthe viewing angle and is consistent with that obtained from a sample with\nrandom velocities. We find that the clustering of angular momentum vectors of\nthe satellites in the plane is a better measure of the kinematic coherence.\nThus we conclude that the line-of- sight velocity is not well suited as a proxy\nfor the kinematical coherence of the plane. Analysis of the kinematics of our\nplanes shows a fraction of $\\sim$30% chance aligned satellites. Tracking the\nsatellites in the plane back in time reveals that these planes are a transient\nfeature and not kinematically coherent as would appear at first sight. Thus we\nexpect some of the satellites in the plane around Andromeda to have high\nvelocities perpendicular to the plane.\n", "  Precision measurements of the large scale structure of the Universe require\nlarge numbers of high fidelity mock catalogs to accurately assess, and account\nfor, the presence of systematic effects. We introduce and test a scheme for\ngenerating mock catalogs rapidly using suitably derated N-body simulations. Our\naim is to reproduce the large scale structure and the gross properties of dark\nmatter halos with high accuracy, while sacrificing the details of the internal\nstructure of the halos. By adjusting global and local time-steps in an N-body\ncode, we demonstrate that we recover halo masses to better than 0.5% and the\npower spectrum to better than 1% both in real and redshift space for k =\n1h/Mpc, while requiring a factor of 4 less CPU time. We also calibrate the\nredshift spacing of outputs required to generate simulated light cones. We find\nthat outputs separated by every z = 0.05 allow us to interpolate particle\npositions and velocities to reproduce the real and redshift space power spectra\nto better than 1% (out to k = 1h/Mpc). We apply these ideas to generate a suite\nof simulations spanning a range of cosmologies, motivated by the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) but broadly applicable to future large\nscale structure surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As an initial demonstration\nof the utility of such simulations, we calibrate the shift in the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation peak position as a function of galaxy bias with higher\nprecision than has been possible so far. This paper also serves to document the\nsimulations, which we make publicly available.\n", "  Firstly, we study the final masses of giant planets growing in protoplanetary\ndisks through capture of disk gas, by employing an empirical formula for the\ngas capture rate and a shallow disk gap model, which are both based on\nhydrodynamical simulations. The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous\nevolution with a moderate viscosity of $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas\naccretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the\nsolid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \\sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of\nthe disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets\nof our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In\nparticular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets\nbecomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid\ngas capture by themselves.\n", "  There are many open questions about prebiotic chemistry in both planetary and\nexoplanetary environments. The increasing number of known exoplanets and other\nultra-cool, substellar objects has propelled the desire to detect life and\nprebiotic chemistry outside the solar system. We present an ion-neutral\nchemical network constructed from scratch, Stand2015, that treats hydrogen,\nnitrogen, carbon and oxygen chemistry accurately within a temperature range\nbetween 100 K and 30000 K. Formation pathways for glycine and other organic\nmolecules are included. The network is complete up to H6C2N2O3. Stand2015 is\nsuccessfully tested against atmospheric chemistry models for HD209458b, Jupiter\nand the present-day Earth using a simple 1D photochemistry/diffusion code. Our\nresults for the early Earth agree with those of Kasting (1993) for CO2, H2, CO\nand O2, but do not agree for water and atomic oxygen. We use the network to\nsimulate an experiment where varied chemical initial conditions are irradiated\nby UV light. The result from our simulation is that more glycine is produced\nwhen more ammonia and methane is present. Very little glycine is produced in\nthe absence of any molecular nitrogen and oxygen. This suggests that production\nof glycine is inhibited if a gas is too strongly reducing. Possible\napplications and limitations of the chemical kinetics network are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built\nthe largest moderately high-resolution (R=22, 500) spectroscopic map of the\nstars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE\nStellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software\ndeveloped for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines\natmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by\ncomparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2\nminimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a\nfortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper IDL code for\nbook-keeping and data handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP\ncomponents and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests\ndesigned to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective\ntemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and\n0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants.\nIt also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels\nof precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000\nstars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.\n", "  The origin of cosmic rays is one of the long-standing mysteries in physics\nand astrophysics. Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray\npopulation below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown\nthat these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the\nobserved flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption\nthat all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\\ they all have the same energy\nbudget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if\na realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as\nit is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio\nwavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz\n& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these\n21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced\nvia $\\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the\nsupernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray\nspectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and\nmaximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total\nclass of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs\nshould be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the\ncosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code\nfor cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched\nwell for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\\propto E^{0.3}$. A\nstronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at\nEarth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget\ncannot be matched, in particular toward high energies.\n", "  In this paper we address the cosmic frequency of technological species.\nRecent advances in exoplanet studies provide strong constraints on all\nastrophysical terms in the Drake Equation. Using these and modifying the form\nand intent of the Drake equation we show that we can set a firm lower bound on\nthe probability that one or more additional technological species have evolved\nanywhere and at any time in the history of the observable Universe. We find\nthat as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a\ntechnological species is larger than ~$10^{-24}$, then humanity is not the only\ntime technological intelligence has evolved. This constraint has important\nscientific and philosophical consequences.\n", "  We point out that the cosmological abundance of ${}^7$Li can be reduced down\nto observed values if during its formation Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is modified\nby the presence of light electrically neutral particles $X$ that have\nsubstantial interactions with nucleons. We find that the lithium problem can be\nsolved without affecting the precisely measured abundances of deuterium and\nhelium if the following conditions are satisfied: the mass and lifetimes of\nsuch particles are bounded by $ 1.6~{\\rm MeV}\\leq m_X \\leq 20~{\\rm MeV}$ and $\n{\\rm few}~100~{\\rm s} \\lesssim \\tau_X \\lesssim 10^4~{\\rm s}$, and the abundance\ntimes the absorption cross section by either deuterium or ${}^7$Be are\ncomparable to the Hubble rate, $n_X \\sigma_{\\rm abs} v \\sim H$, at the time of\n${}^7$Be formation. We include $X$-initiated reactions into the primordial\nnucleosynthesis framework, observe that it leads to a substantial reduction of\nthe freeze-out abundances of ${}^7$Li+${}^7$Be, and find specific model\nrealizations of this scenario. Concentrating on the axion-like-particle case,\n$X=a$, we show that all these conditions can be satisifed if the coupling to\n$d$-quarks is in the range of $f_d^{-1} \\sim {\\rm TeV}^{-1}$, which can be\nprobed at intensity frontier experiments.\n", "  We present analysis of fast variability of Very Large Telescope/ISAAC\n(infra-red), \\textit{XMM-Newton}/OM (optical) and EPIC-pn (X-ray), and RXTE/PCA\n(X-ray) observations of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 in a rising hard\nstate of its outburst in 2010. We report the first detection of a Quasi\nPeriodic Oscillation (QPO) in the infra-red band (IR) of a black hole X-ray\nbinary. The QPO is detected at 0.08 Hz in the IR as well as two optical bands\n(U and V). Interestingly, these QPOs are at half the X-ray QPO frequency at\n0.16 Hz, which is classified as the type-C QPO; a weak sub-harmonic close to\nthe IR and optical QPO frequency is also detected in X-rays. The broad band\nsub-second time scale variability is strongly correlated in IR/X-ray bands,\nwith X-rays leading the IR by over 100 ms. This short time delay, shape of the\ncross correlation function and spectral energy distribution strongly indicate\nthat this broad band variable IR emission is the synchrotron emission from the\njet. A jet origin for the IR QPO is strongly favoured, but cannot be\ndefinitively established with the current data. The spectral energy\ndistribution indicates a thermal disc origin for the bulk of the optical\nemission, but the origin of the optical QPO is unclear. We discuss our findings\nin the context of the existing models proposed to explain the origin of\nvariability.\n", "  We compute the vacuum one-loop quark-gluon vertex correction at zero\ntemperature in the presence of a magnetic field. From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications\nof these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed.\n", "  The modelling of neutrino nucleus interactions is one of the limiting\nsystematic errors in long base line neutrino oscillation experiments. The\naccurate modelling of the neutrino interactions requires more experimental\nobservables to determine its accuracy. Adler Angles are observables carrying\ninformation about the polarization of the ?{\\Delta} resonance and the\ninterference with the non-resonant single pion production. These observables\nwere measured with limited statistics in bubble chamber experiments. We discuss\nthe possibility of measuring the angles in neutrino interactions with nucleus.\n", "  We revisit non-interacting string partition functions in Rindler space by\nsumming over fields in the spectrum. In field theory, the total partition\nfunction splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain surface terms\nand a piece consisting of solely the so-called edge states. For open strings,\nwe illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond\nto open strings piercing the Rindler origin, unifying the higher spin surface\ncontributions in string language. For closed strings, we demonstrate that the\nstring partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition\nfunctions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present\nfor the latter. Next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the\nsurface terms. Using recent results of JHEP 1505 (2015) 106, this construction,\nfirst done by Emparan, can be put on much firmer ground. We generalize to type\nII and heterotic superstrings and demonstrate modular invariance. All of these\nexhibit an IR divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration\nclose to the black hole horizon. Ultimately, since these partition functions\nare only part of the full story, divergences here should not be viewed as a\nfailure of string theory: maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty\ntreatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum. We comment on the\nrelevance of this to Solodukhin's recent proposal. A possible link with the\nfirewall paradox is apparent.\n", "  The photo-dissociation of H$_2$ by a nearby anisotropic source of radiation\nis seen as a critical component in creating an environment in which a direct\ncollapse black hole may form. Employing radiative transfer we model the effect\nof multi-frequency (0.76 eV - 60 eV) radiation on a collapsing halo at high\nredshift. We vary both the shape of the spectrum which emits the radiation and\nthe distance to the emitting galaxy. We use blackbody spectra with temperatures\nof $\\rm{T = 10^4\\ K}$ and $\\rm{T = 10^5\\ K}$ and a realistic stellar spectrum.\nWe find that an optimal zone exists between 1 kpc and 4 kpc from the emitting\ngalaxy. If the halo resides too close to the emitting galaxy the photo-ionising\nradiation creates a large HII region which effectively disrupts the collapsing\nhalo, too far from the source and the radiation flux drops below the level of\nthe expected background and the H$_2$ fraction remains too high. When the\nemitting galaxy is initially placed between 1 kpc and 2 kpc from the collapsing\nhalo, with a spectral shape consistent with a star-forming high redshift\ngalaxy, then a large central core forms. The mass of the central core is\nbetween 5000 and 10000 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ at a temperature of approximately 1000\nK. This core is however surrounded by a reservoir of hotter gas at\napproximately 8000 K which leads to mass inflow rates of the order of $\\sim\n0.1$ $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ yr$^{-1}$. This environment has the potential to form a\nmassive primordial star which can then lead to the formation of a direct\ncollapse black hole.\n", "  A local and deterministic model of quantum correlations is always possible,\nas shown explicitly by Brans in 1988: one simply needs the physical systems\nbeing measured to have a suitable statistical correlation with the physical\nsystems performing the measurement, via some common cause. Hence, to derive\nno-go results such as Bell inequalities, an assumption of measurement\nindependence is crucial. It is a surprisingly strong assumption -- less than\n1/15 bits of prior correlation suffice for a local model of the singlet state\nof two qubits -- with ramifications for the security of quantum communication\nprotocols. Indeed, without this assumption, any statistical correlations\nwhatsoever -- even those which appear to allow explicit superluminal signalling\n-- have a corresponding local deterministic model. It is argued that 'quantum\nnonlocality' is bad terminology, and that measurement independence does not\nequate to 'experimental free will'. Brans' 1988 model is extended to show that\nno more than 2 log d bits of prior correlation are required for a local\ndeterministic model of the correlations between any two d-dimensional quantum\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a complex short pulse equation of both focusing and\ndefocusing types, which governs the propagation of ultra-short pulses in\nnonlinear optical fibers. It can be viewed as an analogue of the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation in the ultra-short pulse regime. Furthermore, we\nconstruct the multi-dark soliton solution for the defocusing complex short\npulse equation through the Darboux transformation and reciprocal (hodograph)\ntransformation. One- and two-dark soliton solutions are given explicitly, whose\nproperties and dynamics are analyzed and illustrated.\n", "  We present simulations of star forming filaments incorporating - to our\nknowledge - the largest chemical network used to date on-the-fly in a 3D-MHD\nsimulation. The network contains 37 chemical species and about 300 selected\nreaction rates. For this we use the newly developed package KROME (Grassi et\nal. 2014). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using such a complex\nchemical network in 3D-MHD simulations on modern supercomputers. We perform\nsimulations with different strengths of the interstellar radiation field and\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate and find chemical and physical results in\naccordance with observations and other recent numerical work.\n", "  To understand massive star formation requires study of its initial\nconditions. Two massive starless core candidates, C1-N & C1-S, have been\ndetected in IRDC G028.37+00.07 in $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) with $ALMA$. From their\nline widths, either the cores are subvirial and are thus young structures on\nthe verge of near free-fall collapse, or they are threaded by $\\sim1$ mG\n$B$-fields that help support them in near virial equilibrium and potentially\nhave older ages. We modeled the deuteration rate of $\\rm N_2H^+$ to constrain\ncollapse rates of the cores. First, to measure their current deuterium\nfraction, $D_{\\rm\n  frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}$ $\\equiv [\\rm N_2D^+]/[N_2H^+]$, we observed multiple\ntransitions of $\\rm N_2H^+$ and $\\rm N_2D^+$ with $CARMA$, $SMA$, $JCMT$,\n$NRO~45m$ and $IRAM~30m$, to complement the $ALMA$ data. For both cores we\nderived $D_{\\rm\n  frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}\\sim0.3$, several orders of magnitude above the cosmic\n[D]/[H] ratio. We then carried out chemodynamical modeling, exploring how\ncollapse rate relative to free-fall, $\\alpha_{\\rm ff}$, affects the level of\n$D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}$ that is achieved from a given initial condition. To\nreach the observed $D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm\n  N_2H^+}$, most models require slow collapse with $\\alpha_{\\rm\n  ff}\\sim0.1$, i.e., $\\sim1/10$th of free-fall. This makes it more likely that\nthe cores have been able to reach a near virial equilibrium state and we\npredict that strong $B$-fields will eventually be detected. The methods\ndeveloped here will be useful for measurement of the pre-stellar core mass\nfunction.\n", "  We apply the Sternberg et al. (2014) theoretical model to analyze HI and H2\nobservations in the Perseus molecular cloud. We constrain the physical\nproperties of the HI shielding envelopes and the nature of the HI-to-H2\ntransitions. Our analysis (Bialy et al. 2015) implies that in addition to cold\nneutral gas (CNM), less dense thermally-unstable gas (UNM) significantly\ncontributes to the shielding of the H2 cores in Perseus.\n", "  We investigate magnetoresistance in spin valves involving CoPd-contacted\ncarbon nanotubes. Both temperature and bias voltage dependence clearly indicate\ntunneling magnetoresistance as the origin. We show that this effect is\nsignificantly affected by the tunnel barrier strength, which appears to be one\nreason for the variation between devices previously detected in similar\nstructures. Modeling the data by means of the scattering matrix approach, we\nfind a non-trivial dependence of the magnetoresistance on the barrier strength.\nFurthermore, analysis of the spin precession observed in a nonlocal Hanle\nmeasurement yields a spin lifetime of $\\tau_s = 1.1\\,$ns, a value comparable\nwith those found in silicon- or graphene-based spin valve devices.\n", "  We have developed a crowdsourcing web application for image quality control\nemployed by the Dark Energy Survey. Dubbed the \"DES exposure checker\", it\nrenders science-grade images directly to a web browser and allows users to mark\nproblematic features from a set of predefined classes. Users can also generate\ncustom labels and thus help identify previously unknown problem classes. User\nreports are fed back to hardware and software experts to help mitigate and\neliminate recognized issues. We report on the implementation of the application\nand our experience with its over 100 users, the majority of which are\nprofessional or prospective astronomers but not data management experts. We\ndiscuss aspects of user training and engagement, and demonstrate how problem\nreports have been pivotal to rapidly correct artifacts which would likely have\nbeen too subtle or infrequent to be recognized otherwise. We conclude with a\nnumber of important lessons learned, suggest possible improvements, and\nrecommend this collective exploratory approach for future astronomical surveys\nor other extensive data sets with a sufficiently large user base. We also\nrelease open-source code of the web application and host an online demo version\nat http://des-exp-checker.pmelchior.net\n", "  In this manuscript we show that the geometrical localization mechanism\nimplies a four dimensional mass for the photon. The consistence of the model\nprovides a mass given exactly by $m_{\\gamma}=\\sqrt{R}/4$ where $R$ is the Ricci\nscalar. As a consequence, the cosmological photon has a mass related to the\nvacuum solution of the Einstein equation. At the present age of the universe we\nhave a dS vacuum with $R=4\\Lambda$, where Lambda is a positive cosmological\nconstant. With this we find that $m_{\\gamma}\\approx 2\\times 10^{-69}$ kg, which\nis below the present experimental upper bounds, and such correction may be\nobserved in the next years with more precise measurements. By considering the\nvalue of $R$ inside some astrophysical sources and environments we find that\nthe bound is also satisfied. The experimental verification of this mass, beyond\npointing to the existence of extra dimensions, would imply in a fundamental\nchange in cosmology, astrophysics and in particle physics since the same\nmechanism is valid for non-abelian gauge fields.\n", "  The nearest neighbor distribution (Chandrasekhar 1943) is generalized to\nfractal stellar systems.For such systems an asymptotic distribution of the\nmagnitude of large random forces and a formula for the effective mean\ninterparticle spacing are derived. It is shown that in the case of a power-law\ndistribution of conditional density the derived asymptotic fully agrees with\nthe results obtained in terms of a general approach. It is concluded that large\nrandom forces in a fractal stellar medium are due entirely to the nearest\nneighbors (clumps) located inside the sphere of the effective radius determined\nfrom the generalized Holtsmark distribution.\n", "  We study the quark flavor violating Higgs-boson decay $h \\rightarrow \\bar b s\n+ b \\bar s$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The decay is\nanalyzed first in a model independent, and in a second step in the minimal\nflavor violationg (MFV) Constrained MSSM. The experimental constraints from\n$B$-Physics observables (BPO) and electroweak precision observables (EWPO) are\nalso calculated and imposed on the parameter space. It is shown that in some\ncases the EWPO restrict the flavor violating parameter space stronger than the\nBPO. In the model independent analysis values of ${\\cal O}(10^{-4})$ can be\nfound for ${\\rm BR}(h \\rightarrow \\bar b s + b \\bar s)$. In the MFV CMSSM such\nresults can only be obtained in very restricted parts of the parameter space.\nThe results show that it is not excluded to observe the decay $h \\rightarrow\n\\bar b s + b \\bar s$ in the MSSM at future $e^+e^-$ colliders.\n", "  In order to understand how molecular clouds form in the Galactic interstellar\nmedium, we would like to be able to map the structure and kinematics of the gas\nflows responsible for forming them. However, doing so is observationally\nchallenging. CO, the workhorse molecule for studies of molecular clouds, traces\nonly relatively dense gas and hence only allows us to study those portions of\nthe clouds that have already assembled. Numerical simulations suggest that the\ninflowing gas that forms these clouds is largely composed of CO-dark H2. These\nsame simulations allow us to explore the usefulness of different tracers of\nthis CO-dark molecular material, and we use them here to show that the [CII]\nfine structure line is potentially a very powerful tracer of this gas and\nshould be readily detectable using modern instrumentation.\n", "  Consecutive proton irradiation of iron pnictides reduces the superconducting\ntransition temperature to decrease monotonically. Our systematic optical THz\ninvestigations of Ba(Fe$_{0.9}$Co$_{0.1}$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films reveal,\nhowever, that the low-energy superconducting gap is first suppressed, but\nrecovers for higher irradiation doses. At the same time the decrease of the\nsuperfluid density with disorder comes to a halt. These observations are in\nexcellent agreement with theoretical calculations, which predict a\ndisorder-induced transition of the order parameter from $s_{\\pm}$ to $s_{++}$\nsymmetry. Thereby we solve the longstanding puzzle of the iron pnictides gap\nsymmetry in favor of $s_{\\pm}$-symmetry and demonstrate THz spectroscopy as a\ntool to determine the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter.\n", "  Shocks are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium of galaxies, where they\ncontribute to the energetic balance and to the cycle of matter, and where they\nare thought to be the primary sites for cosmic rays acceleration. Most of the\ntime: in jets and outflows, supernova remnants, or colliding flows, they are\nlinked with star formation. The study of shocks is hence a powerful tool to\nprobe the evolution of the interstellar medium and to better understand star\nformation. To these aims, the most precise observations must be compared with\nthe most precise models of shocks. The SOFIA/GREAT instrument represents a\npowerful observational tool to support our progresses, as it allows to observe\nnumerous shock tracers in the far-infrared range.\n", "  The distributions of stars and prestellar cores by mass (initial and dense\ncore mass functions, IMF/DCMF) are among the key factors regulating star\nformation and are the subject of detailed theoretical and observational\nstudies. Results from numerical simulations of star formation qualitatively\nresemble an observed mass function, a scale-free power law with a sharp decline\nat low masses. However, most analytic IMF theories critically depend on the\nempirically chosen input spectrum of mass fluctuations which evolve into dense\ncores and, subsequently, stars, and on the scaling relation between the\namplitude and mass of a fluctuation. Here we propose a new approach exploiting\nthe techniques from the field of network science. We represent a system of\ndense cores accreting gas from the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium\n(ISM) as a spatial network growing by preferential attachment and assume that\nthe ISM density has a self-similar fractal distribution following the\nKolmogorov turbulence theory. We effectively combine gravoturbulent and\ncompetitive accretion approaches and predict the accretion rate to be\nproportional to the dense core mass: $dM/dt \\propto M$. Then we describe the\ndense core growth and demonstrate that the power-law core mass function emerges\nindependently of the initial distribution of density fluctuations by mass. Our\nmodel yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the\nISM and accreting gas. With a proper choice of the low-mass cut-off, it\nreproduces observations over three decades in mass. We also rule out a low-mass\nstar dominated \"bottom-heavy\" IMF in a single star-forming region.\n", "  The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation lensing is a promising tool\nto study the physics of early universe. In this work we probe the imprints of\ndeviations from isotropy and scale invariance of primordial curvature\nperturbation power spectrum on CMB lensing potential and convergence.\nSpecifically, we consider a scale-dependent hemispherical asymmetry in\nprimordial power spectrum. We show that the CMB lensing potential and\nconvergence and also the cross-correlation of the CMB lensing and late time\ngalaxy convergence can probe the amplitude and the scale dependence of the\ndipole modulation. As another example, we consider a primordial power spectrum\nwith local feature. We show that the CMB lensing and the cross-correlation of\nthe CMB lensing and galaxy lensing can probe the amplitude and the shape of the\nlocal feature. We show that the cross correlation of CMB lensing convergence\nand galaxy lensing is capable to probe the effects of local features in power\nspectrum on smaller scales than the CMB lensing. Finally we showed that the\ncurrent data can constrain the amplitude and moment dependence of dipole\nasymmetry.\n", "  Rising interest in Mars colonization from both private and public sectors\nnecessitates a renewed discussion about sovereignty in space. The\nnon-appropriation principle of the Outer Space Treaty currently prohibits any\nsovereign claims to celestial bodies, but it remains unclear how this principle\nshould be applied to the peaceful colonization of Mars. Here we develop a\npragmatic approach to guide the settlement of Mars, which is based upon a\n\"bounded first possession\" model with mandatory planetary parks. Scientists,\nexperts, and leaders will establish planetary park locations and regulations\nthrough worldwide community solicitation in order to protect sites of\nscientific, aesthetic, historical, cultural, environmental, spiritual value.\nColonization parties may occupy limited plots of martian land and may claim\nexclusive economic rights within this zone, while still refraining from any\nclaims to sovereignty. All colonists remain under the legal jurisdiction of\ntheir host nation, with conflicts to be resolved diplomatically or through a\ntemporary tribunal system composed of representatives from other Mars colonies.\nWe also propose the formation of a Mars Secretariat as an administrative body\nwith limited power to facilitate communication among parties. Our model for\nMars colonization remains consistent with the Outer Space Treaty, but we also\nrecommend revisiting or amending the non-appropriation and province of mankind\nprinciples to resolve the ambiguity of how nations, corporations, and\nindividuals may utilize the resources of space.\n", "  Long-distance quantum communication relies on the ability to efficiently\ngenerate and prepare single photons at telecom wavelengths. In many\napplications these photons must also be indistinguishable such that they\nexhibit interference on a beamsplitter, which implements effective\nphoton-photon interactions. However, deterministic generation of\nindistinguishable single photons with high brightness remains a challenging\nproblem. We demonstrate two-photon interference at telecom wavelengths using an\nInAs/InP quantum dot in a nanophotonic cavity. The cavity enhances the quantum\ndot emission, resulting in a nearly Gaussian transverse mode profile with high\nout-coupling efficiency exceeding 36% after multi-photon correction. We also\nobserve Purcell enhanced spontaneous emission rate up to 4. Using this source,\nwe generate linearly polarized, high purity single photons at 1.3 micron\nwavelength and demonstrate the indistinguishable nature of the emission using a\ntwo-photon interference measurement, which exhibits indistinguishable\nvisibilities of 18% without post-selection and 67% with post-selection. Our\nresults provide a promising approach to generate bright, deterministic single\nphotons at telecom wavelength for applications in quantum networking and\nquantum communication.\n", "  We generalize an efficient decomposition method for diagonal operators by\nWelch et al. to qudit systems. The phase-context aware method focusses on\ncascaded entanglers whose decomposition into multi-controlled INC-gates can be\noptimized by the choice of a proper signed base-$d$ representation for the\nnatural numbers.\n  While the gate count of the best known decomposition method for general\ndiagonal operators on qubit systems scales with $\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$, the\ncircuits synthesized by the Welch algorithm for diagonal operators with $k$\ndistinct phases are upper-bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$, which is generalized\nto $\\mathcal{O}(dn^2k)$ for the qudit case in this paper.\n", "  The RENO experiment has analyzed about 500 live days of data to observe an\nenergy dependent disappearance of reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ by comparison of\ntheir prompt signal spectra measured in two identical near and far detectors.\nIn the period between August 2011 and January 2013, the far (near) detector\nobserved 31541 (290775) electron antineutrino candidate events with a\nbackground fraction of 4.9\\% (2.8\\%). The measured prompt spectra show an\nexcess of reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ around 5 MeV relative to the prediction\nfrom a most commonly used model. A clear energy and baseline dependent\ndisappearance of reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ is observed in the deficit of the\nobserved number of $\\overline{\\nu}_e$. Based on the measured far-to-near ratio\nof prompt spectra, we obtain $\\sin^2 2 \\theta_{13} = 0.082 \\pm 0.009({\\rm\nstat.}) \\pm 0.006({\\rm syst.})$ and $|\\Delta m_{ee}^2|\n=[2.62_{-0.23}^{+0.21}({\\rm stat.}) _{-0.13}^{+0.12}({\\rm syst.})]\\times\n10^{-3}$~eV$^2$.\n", "  Variation of the phase of the beam transmitted through a crystalline material\nas a function of the rocking angle is a well known dynamical effect in x-ray\nscattering. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to measure directly these phase\nvariations in a conventional scattering experiment. It was recently suggested\nthat the transmitted phase can be directly measured in ptychography experiments\nperformed on nanocrystal samples. Results of such experiment for different\ncrystal thickness, reflections and incoming photon energies, in principle, can\nbe fully described in the frame of dynamical theory. However, dynamical theory\ndoes not provide a simple analytical expression for the further analysis. We\ndevelop here quasi-kinematical theory approach that allows to describe\ncorrectly the phase of the transmitted beam for the crystal thickness less than\nextinction length that is beyond applicability of the conventional kinematical\ntheory.\n", "  The construction of stationary axisymmetric multiwormhole solutions to\ngravitating field theories admitting toroidal reductions to three-dimensional\ngravitating sigma models is reviewed. We show that, as in the multi-black hole\ncase, strut singularities always appear in this construction, except for very\nspecial configurations with an odd number of centers. We also review the\nanalytical continuation of the multicenter solution across the $n$ cuts\nassociated with the wormhole mouths. The resulting Riemann manifold has $2^n$\nsheets interconnected by $2^{n-1}n$ wormholes. We find that the maximally\nextended multicenter solution can never be asymptotically locally flat in all\nthe Riemann sheets.\n", "  NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory is delivering vector field observations of\nthe full solar disk with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution;\nhowever, the satellite is in a highly inclined geostationary orbit. The\nrelative spacecraft-Sun velocity varies by $\\pm3$~km/s over a day which\nintroduces major orbital artifacts in the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager data. We\ndemonstrate that the orbital artifacts contaminate all spatial and temporal\nscales in the data. We describe a newly-developed three stage procedure for\nmitigating these artifacts in the Doppler data derived from the Milne-Eddington\ninversions in the HMI Pipeline. This procedure was applied to full disk images\nof AR11084 to produce consistent Dopplergrams. The data adjustments reduce the\npower in the orbital artifacts by 31dB. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the\ncorrected images and show that our procedure greatly improve the temporal and\nspectral properties of the data without adding any new artifacts. We conclude\nthat this new and easily implemented procedure makes a dramatic improvement in\nthe consistency of the HMI data and in its usefulness for precision scientific\nstudies.\n", "  We propose a continuum model of percolation in two dimensions for overlapping\ndisks with spin. In this model the existence of bonds is determined by the\ndistance between the centers of the disks, and by the scalar product of the\n(randomly) directed spin with the direction of the vector connecting the\ncenters of neighboring disks. The direction of a single spin is controlled by a\n\"temperature\", representing the amount of polarization of the spins in the\ndirection of an external field. Our model is inspired by biological neuronal\nnetworks and aims to characterize their topological properties when axonal\nguidance plays a major role. We numerically study the phase diagram of the\nmodel observing the emergence of a giant strongly connected component,\nrepresenting the portion of neurons that are causally connected. We provide\nstrong evidence that the critical exponents depend on the temperature.\n", "  In the supersymmetric standard model which is not minimal, the Higgs\npotential does not conserve CP symmetry generally. Assuming that there exists\nan SU(2)-triplet Higgs field, we discuss resultant CP-violating effects on the\nHiggs bosons. The experimentally observed Higgs boson, which should be CP-even\nin the standard model, could decay into two photons of CP-odd polarization\nstate non-negligibly. For the second lightest Higgs boson, in sizable region of\nparameter space, the dominant decay modes are different from those expected by\nthe standard model. The two-photon decay could yield both even and odd CP final\nstates at a ratio of oder of unity.\n", "  We highlight distinct and systematic observational features of magnetic field\nmorphologies in polarized submm dust continuum. We illustrate this with\nspecific examples and show statistical trends from a sample of 50 star-forming\nregions.\n", "  Conformal higher spin (CHS) field theory, which is a solid part of recent\nadvanced checks of AdS/CFT correspondence, finds applications in cosmology.\nHidden sector of weakly interacting CHS fields suggests a resolution of the\nhierarchy problem in the model of initial conditions for inflationary cosmology\ndriven by a conformal field theory. These initial conditions are set by thermal\ngarland type cosmological instantons in the sub-planckian energy range for the\nmodel of CHS fields with a large positive coefficient $\\beta$ of the\nGauss-Bonnet term in their total conformal anomaly and a large number of their\npolarizations $\\mathbb{N}$. The upper bound of this range $M_P/\\sqrt\\beta$ is\nshown to be much lower than the gravitational cutoff $M_P/\\sqrt\\mathbb{N}$\nwhich is defined by the requirement of smallness of the perturbatively\nnonrenormalizable graviton loop contributions. In this way we justify the\napproximation scheme in which the nonrenormalizable graviton sector is subject\nto effective field theory under this cutoff, whereas the renormalizable sector\nof multiple CHS fields is treated beyond perturbation theory and dynamically\ngenerates the bound on the inflation scale of the CFT cosmology\n$M_P/\\sqrt\\beta\\ll M_P/\\sqrt\\mathbb{N}$. This confirms recent predictions for\nthe origin of the Starobinsky $R^2$ and Higgs inflation models from the CHS\ncosmology, which occurs at the energy scale three or four orders of magnitude\nbelow the gravitational cutoff, $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{N}/\\beta}\\sim 10^{-3}\\div\n10^{-4}$. We also consider cosmological models dominated by fermionic CHS\nfields with a negative $\\beta$ and anomaly free models of infinite towers of\nCHS fields with $\\beta=0$ and briefly discuss the status of unitarity in CHS\nmodels.\n", "  We investigate the generation of magnetic fields from non-linear effects\naround recombination. As tight-coupling is gradually lost when approaching\n$z\\simeq 1100$, the velocity difference between photons and baryons starts to\nincrease, leading to an increasing Compton drag of the photons on the\nelectrons. The protons are then forced to follow the electrons due to the\nelectric field created by the charge displacement; the same field, following\nMaxwell's laws, eventually induces a magnetic field on cosmological scales.\nSince scalar perturbations do not generate any magnetic field as they are\ncurl-free, one has to resort to second-order perturbation theory to compute the\nmagnetic field generated by this effect. We reinvestigate this problem\nnumerically using the powerful second-order Boltzmann code SONG. We show that:\ni) all previous studies do not have a high enough angular resolution to reach a\nprecise and consistent estimation of the magnetic field spectrum; ii) the\nmagnetic field is generated up to $z\\simeq 10$; iii) it is in practice\nimpossible to compute the magnetic field with a Boltzmann code for scales\nsmaller than $1\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Finally we confirm that for scales of a few ${\\rm\nMpc}$, this magnetic field is of order $2\\times 10^{-29}{\\rm G}$, many orders\nof magnitude smaller than what is currently observed on intergalactic scales.\n", "  Obtaining the exciton dynamics of large photosynthetic complexes by using\nmixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is computationally\ndemanding. We propose a machine learning technique, multi-layer perceptrons, as\na tool to reduce the time required to compute excited state energies. With this\napproach we predict time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) excited\nstate energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)\ncomplex. Additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations\nfrom the predictions. Different methods to determine multi-layer perceptron\ntraining sets are introduced, leading to several initial data selections. In\naddition, we compute spectral densities and exciton populations. Once\nmulti-layer perceptrons are trained, predicting excited state energies was\nfound to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We\nshowed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of\nQM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors\ncontained within 0.01 eV (0.5%). Spectral densities and exciton dynamics are\nalso in agreement with the TDDFT results. The acceleration and accurate\nprediction of dynamics strongly encourage the combination of machine learning\ntechniques with ab-initio methods.\n", "  We investigate relations between spatial properties of the free energy and\nthe radius of Gaussian curvature of the underlying curved lattice geometries.\nFor this purpose we derive recurrence relations for the analysis of the free\nenergy normalized per lattice site of various multistate spin models in the\nthermal equilibrium on distinct non-Euclidean surface lattices of the infinite\nsizes. Whereas the free energy is calculated numerically by means of the Corner\nTransfer Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, the radius of curvature has an\nanalytic expression. Two tasks are considered in this work. First, we search\nfor such a lattice geometry, which minimizes the free energy per site. We\nconjecture that the only Euclidean flat geometry results in the minimal free\nenergy per site regardless of the spin model. Second, the relations among the\nfree energy, the radius of curvature, and the phase transition temperatures are\nanalyzed. We found out that both the free energy and the phase transition\ntemperature inherit the structure of the lattice geometry and asymptotically\napproach the profile of the Gaussian radius of curvature. This achievement\nopens new perspectives in the AdS-CFT correspondence theories.\n", "  We discuss the role of protostellar outflow feedback in clustered star\nformation using the observational data of recent molecular outflow surveys\ntoward nearby cluster-forming clumps. We found that for almost all clumps, the\noutflow momentum injection rate is significantly larger than the turbulence\ndissipation rate. Therefore, the outflow feedback is likely to maintain\nsupersonic turbulence in the clumps. For less massive clumps such as B59,\nL1551, and L1641N, the outflow kinetic energy is comparable to the clump\ngravitational energy. In such clumps, the outflow feedback probably affects\nsignificantly the clump dynamics. On the other hand, for clumps with masses\nlarger than about 200 M$_\\odot$, the outflow kinetic energy is significantly\nsmaller than the clump gravitational energy. Since the majority of stars form\nin such clumps, we conclude that outflow feedback cannot destroy the whole\nparent clump. These characteristics of the outflow feedback support the\nscenario of slow star formation.\n", "  We calculate near-threshold bound states and Feshbach resonance positions for\natom + rigid-rotor models of the highly anisotropic systems Li+CaH and Li+CaF.\nWe perform statistical analysis on the resonance positions to compare with the\npredictions of random matrix theory. For Li+CaH with total angular momentum\n$J=0$ we find fully chaotic behavior in both the nearest-neighbor spacing\ndistribution and the level number variance. However, for $J>0$ we find\ndifferent behavior due to the presence of a nearly conserved quantum number.\nLi+CaF ($J=0$) also shows apparently reduced levels of chaotic behavior despite\nits stronger effective coupling. We suggest this may indicate the development\nof another good quantum number relating to a bending motion of the complex.\nHowever, continuously varying the rotational constant over a wide range shows\nunexpected structure in the degree of chaotic behavior, including a dramatic\nreduction around the rotational constant of CaF. This demonstrates the\ncomplexity of the relationship between coupling and chaotic behavior.\n", "  In this paper we apply the tools of the dynamical systems theory in order to\nuncover the whole asymptotic structure of the vacuum interactions of a galileon\nmodel with a cubic derivative interaction term. It is shown that, contrary to\nwhat occurs in the presence of background matter, the galileon interactions of\nvacuum appreciably modify the late-time cosmic dynamics. In particular, a local\nlate-time attractor representing phantom behavior arises which is inevitably\nassociated with a big rip singularity. It seems that the gravitational\ninteractions of the background matter with the galileon screen the effects of\nthe gravitational self-interactions of the galileon, thus erasing any potential\nmodification of the late-time dynamics by the galileon vacuum processes. Unlike\nother galileon models inspired in the DGP scenario, self-accelerating solutions\ndo not arise in this model.\n", "  Future space borne gravitational wave detectors will require a precise\ndefinition of calibration signals to ensure the achievement of their design\nsensitivity. The careful design of the test signals plays a key role in the\ncorrect understanding and characterisation of these instruments. In that sense,\nmethods achieving optimal experiment designs must be considered as\ncomplementary to the parameter estimation methods being used to determine the\nparameters describing the system. The relevance of experiment design is\nparticularly significant for the LISA Pathfinder mission, which will spend most\nof its operation time performing experiments to characterise key technologies\nfor future space borne gravitational wave observatories. Here we propose a\nframework to derive the optimal signals ---in terms of minimum parameter\nuncertainty--- to be injected to these instruments during its calibration\nphase. We compare our results with an alternative numerical algorithm which\nachieves an optimal input signal by iteratively improving an initial guess. We\nshow agreement of both approaches when applied to the LISA Pathfinder case.\n", "  NEXT-100 is an electroluminescent high-pressure xenon gas time projection\nchamber that will search for the neutrinoless double beta ($\\beta \\beta 0 \\nu$)\ndecay of Xe-136. The detector possesses two features of great value for $\\beta\n\\beta 0 \\nu$ searches: energy resolution better than 1\\% FWHM at the $Q$ value\nof Xe-136 and track reconstruction for the discrimination of signal and\nbackground events. This combination results in excellent sensitivity, as\ndiscussed in this paper. Material-screening measurements and a detailed Monte\nCarlo detector simulation predict a background rate for NEXT-100 of at most\n$4\\times10^{-4}$ counts keV$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. Accordingly, the\ndetector will reach a sensitivity to the \\bbonu-decay half-life of\n$2.8\\times10^{25}$ years (90\\% CL) for an exposure of 100\n$\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{year}$, or $6.0\\times10^{25}$ years after a run of 3\neffective years.\n", "  We study the quench dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate under a\nRaman-assisted synthetic spin-orbit coupling. To model the dynamical process,\nwe adopt a self-consistent Bogoliubov approach, which is equivalent to applying\nthe time-dependent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations. We investigate the dynamics\nof the condensate fraction as well as the momentum distribution of the Bose gas\nfollowing a sudden change of system parameters. Typically, the system evolves\ninto a steady state in the long-time limit, which features an oscillating\nmomentum distribution and a stationary condensate fraction which is dependent\non the quench parameters. We investigate how different quench parameters such\nas the inter- and intra-species interactions and the spin-orbit-coupling\nparameters affect the condensate fraction in the steady state. Furthermore, we\nfind that the time average of the oscillatory momentum distribution in the\nlong-time limit can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble with two\nbranches of momentum-dependent Gibbs temperatures. Our study is relevant to the\nexperimental investigation of dynamical processes in a spin-orbit coupled\nBose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate dc and ac electric voltage generation due to\nspinmotive forces originating from domain wall motion and magnetic resonance,\nrespectively, in two-sublattice antiferromagnets. Our theory accounts for the\ncanting between the sublattice magnetizations, the nonadiabatic electron spin\ndynamics, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with the inter-sublattice\nelectron dynamics treated as a perturbation. This work suggests a new way to\nobserve and explore the dynamics of antiferromagnetic textures by electrical\nmeans, an important aspect in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic\nspintronics, where both manipulation and detection of antiferromagnets are\nneeded.\n", "  Improving the capabilities of detecting faint X-ray sources is fundamental to\nincrease the statistics on faint high-z AGN and star-forming galaxies. We\nperformed a simultaneous Maximum Likelihood PSF fit in the [0.5-2] keV and\n[2-7] keV energy bands of the 4 Ms{\\em Chandra} Deep Field South (CDFS) data at\nthe position of the 34930 CANDELS H-band selected galaxies. For each detected\nsource we provide X-ray photometry and optical counterpart validation. We\nvalidated this technique by means of a raytracing simulation. We detected a\ntotal of 698 X-ray point-sources with a likelihood $\\mathcal{L}$$>$4.98 (i.e.\n$>$2.7$\\sigma$). We show that the prior knowledge of a deep sample of\nOptical-NIR galaxies leads to a significant increase of the detection of faint\n(i.e. $\\sim$10$^{-17}$ cgs in the [0.5-2] keV band) sources with respect to\n\"blind\" X-ray detections. By including previous X-ray catalogs, this work\nincreases the total number of X-ray sources detected in the 4 Ms CDFS, CANDELS\narea to 793, which represents the largest sample of extremely faint X-ray\nsources assembled to date. Our results suggest that a large fraction of the\noptical counterparts of our X-ray sources determined by likelihood ratio\nactually coincides with the priors used for the source detection. Most of the\nnew detected sources are likely star-forming galaxies or faint absorbed AGN. We\nidentified a few sources sources with putative photometric redshift z$>$4.\nDespite the low number statistics and the uncertainties on the photo-z, this\nsample significantly increases the number of X--ray selected candidate high-z\nAGN.\n", "  Topological insulators, first observed in electronic systems, have inspired\nmany analogues in photonic and phononic crystals in which remarkable one-way\npropagation edge states are supported by topologically nontrivial bandgaps.\nSuch bandgaps can be achieved by breaking the time-reversal symmetry to lift\nthe degeneracy associated with Dirac cones at the corners of the Brillouin\nzone. Here, we report on our construction of a phononic crystal exhibiting a\nDirac-like cone in the Brillouin zone center. We demonstrate that\nsimultaneously breaking the time-reversal symmetry and altering the geometric\nsize of the unit cell result in a topological transition that is verified by\nthe Chern number calculation and edge mode analysis. The topology of the\nbandgap is tunable by varying both the velocity field and the geometric size;\nsuch tunability may dramatically enrich the design and use of acoustic\ntopological insulators.\n", "  I review (1) Physics of Star Formation & Open Questions; (2) Structure &\nDynamics of Star-Forming Clouds & Young Clusters; (3) Star Formation Rates:\nObservations & Theoretical Implications.\n", "  We quantitatively illustrate the fundamental limit that exciton-exciton\nannihilation (EEA) may impose to the light emission of monolayer transition\nmetal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials. The EEA in TMDC monolayers shows\ndependence on the interaction with substrates as its rate increases from 0.1\ncm2/s (0.05 cm2/s) to 0.3 cm2/s (0.1 cm2/s) with the substrates removed for WS2\n(MoS2) monolayers. It turns to be the major pathway of exciton decay and\ndominates the luminescence efficiency when the exciton density is beyond 1010\ncm-2 in suspended monolayers or 1011 cm-2 in supported monolayers. This sets an\nupper limit on the density of injected charges in light emission devices for\nthe realization of optimal luminescence efficiency. The strong EEA rate also\ndictates the pumping threshold for population inversion in the monolayers to be\n12-18 MW/cm2 (optically) or 2.5-4x105 A/cm2 (electrically).\n", "  We propose a scheme for triggering a dissipation dominated highly efficient\nexcitation transfer from a single photon wave packet to a single quantum\nemitter. This single photon induced optical pumping turns dominant dissipative\nprocesses, such as spontaneous photon emission by the emitter or cavity decay,\ninto valuable tools for quantum information processing and quantum\ncommunication. It works for an arbitrarily shaped single photon wave packet\nwith sufficiently small bandwidth provided a matching condition is satisfied\nwhich balances the dissipative rates involved. Our scheme does not require\nadditional laser pulses or quantum feedback and is not restricted to highly\nmode selective cavity quantum electrodynamical architectures. In particular, it\ncan be used to enhance significantly the coupling of a single photon to a\nsingle quantum emitter implanted in a one dimensional waveguide or even in a\nfree space scenario. We demonstrate the usefulness of our scheme for building a\ndeterministic quantum memory and a deterministic frequency converter between\nphotonic qubits of different wavelengths.\n", "  We demonstrate that measurements of rapidity differential anisotropic flow in\nheavy ion collisions can constrain the temperature dependence of the shear\nviscosity to entropy density ratio {\\eta}/s of QCD matter. Comparing results\nfrom hydrodynamic calculations with experimental data from RHIC, we find\nevidence for a small {\\eta}/s $\\approx$ 0.04 in the QCD cross-over region and a\nstrong temperature dependence in the hadronic phase. A temperature independent\n{\\eta}/s is disfavored by the data. We further show that measurements of the\nevent-by-event flow as a function of rapidity can be used to independently\nconstrain the initial state fluctuations in three dimensions and the\ntemperature dependent transport properties of QCD matter.\n", "  We study the efficiency of heat engines that perform mechanical work via the\npdV terms present in the First Law in extended gravitational thermodynamics. We\nuse charged black holes as the working substance, for a particular choice of\nengine cycle. The context is Einstein gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant and a Born-Infeld non-linear electrodynamics sector. We compare the\nresults for these `holographic' heat engines to previous results obtained for\nEinstein-Maxwell black holes, and for the case where there is a Gauss-Bonnet\nsector.\n", "  We consider a non-equilibrium system of interacting emitters described by the\nXXZ model, whose excitonic transitions are spatially and spectrally coupled to\na single mode cavity. We demonstrate that the output radiation field is\nsensitive to an interplay between the hopping ($J$) and the interactions ($U$)\nof the excitons. Moderate values of the short-ranged interaction are shown to\ninduce laser with maximal output at the Heisenberg point ($U=J$). In the laser\nregime, charge-charge correlations emerge and they are shown to strongly depend\non the interaction-hopping ratio. In particular, the system shows\ncharge-density correlations below the Heisenberg point and ferromagnetic\ncorrelations beyond the Heisenberg point. This contrast to the equilibrium\nbehavior of the XXZ chain occurs since the laser explores highly excited states\nof the emitters.\n", "  Recently M.E. Shirokov introduced the non-commutative operator graph\ndepending on the complex parameter $\\theta $ to construct channels with\npositive quantum zero-error capacity having vanishing n-shot capacity. We study\nthe algebraic structure of this graph. The relations for the algebra generated\nby the graph are derived. In the limiting case $\\theta =\\pm1$ the graph becomes\nabelian and degenerates into the direct sum of four one-dimensional irreducible\nrepresentations of the Klein group.\n", "  Close tidal encounters among large planetesimals and moons should have been\nmore common than grazing or normal impacts. Using a mass spring model within an\nN-body simulation, we simulate the deformation of the surface of an elastic\nspherical body caused by a close parabolic tidal encounter with a body that has\nsimilar mass as that of the primary body. Such an encounter can induce\nsufficient stress on the surface to cause brittle failure of an icy crust and\nsimulated fractures can extend a large fraction of the radius of body. Strong\ntidal encounters may be responsible for the formation of long graben complexes\nand chasmata in ancient terrain of icy moons such as Dione, Tethys, Ariel and\nCharon.\n", "  Distributions of transverse momentum $p_T^{ll}$ and the angular variable\n$\\phi^*_\\eta$ of Drell--Yan lepton pairs are measured in 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC. Measurements in electron-pair and muon-pair final states are corrected for\ndetector effects and combined. Compared to previous measurements in\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, these new measurements benefit\nfrom a larger data sample and improved control of systematic uncertainties.\nMeasurements are performed in bins of lepton-pair mass above, around and below\nthe Z-boson mass peak. The data are compared to predictions from perturbative\nand resummed QCD calculations. For values of $\\phi^*_\\eta < 1$ the predictions\nfrom the Monte Carlo generator ResBos are generally consistent with the data\nwithin the theoretical uncertainties. However, at larger values of\n$\\phi^*_\\eta$ this is not generally the case. Monte Carlo generators based on\nthe parton-shower approach are unable to describe the data over the full range\nof $p_T^{ll}$ and the fixed-order prediction of DYNNLO falls below the data at\nhigh values of $p_T^{ll}$. ResBos and the parton-shower Monte Carlo generators\nprovide a much better description of the evolution of the $\\phi^*_\\eta$ and\n$p_T^{ll}$ distributions as a function of lepton-pair mass and rapidity.\n", "  With an increased appreciation for the role of gas in galaxy evolution, there\nis renewed interest in measuring gas masses for galaxies. I review some of the\nbasic concepts in using CO to determine molecular masses, and discuss some of\nthe recent work.\n", "  The recent observation of a transmitted Thz pulse oscillating at three times\nthe frequency of the incident light paves the way to a new protocol to access\nresonant excitations in a superconductor. Here we show that this non-linear\noptical process is dominated by light-induced excitation of Cooper pairs, in\nanalogy with a standard Raman experiment. The collective amplitude (Higgs)\nfluctuations of the superconducting order parameter give in general a smaller\ncontribution, unless one designs the experiment by combining properly the light\npolarization with the lattice symmetry.\n", "  We study radiative processes of uniformly accelerated entangled atoms,\ninteracting with an electromagnetic field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum\nstate. We discuss the structure of the rate of variation of the atomic energy\nfor two atoms travelling in different hyperbolic world lines. We identify the\ncontributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the generation\nof entanglement as well as to the decay of entangled states. Our results\nresemble the situation in which two inertial atoms are coupled individually to\ntwo spatially separated cavities at different temperatures. In addition, for\nequal accelerations we obtain that one of the maximally entangled antisymmetric\nBell state is a decoherence-free state.\n", "  We describe an analytical method for computing the orbital parameters of a\nplanet from the periodogram of a radial velocity signal. The method is very\nefficient and provides a good approximation of the orbital parameters. The\naccuracy is mainly limited by the accuracy of the computation of the Fourier\ndecomposition of the signal which is sensitive to sampling and noise. Our\nmethod is complementary with more accurate (and more expensive in computer\ntime) numerical algorithms (e.g. Levenberg-Marquardt, Markov chain Monte Carlo,\ngenetic algorithms). Indeed, the analytical approximation can be used as an\ninitial condition to accelerate the convergence of these numerical methods. Our\nmethod can be applied iteratively to search for multiple planets in the same\nsystem.\n", "  The naming game has become an archetype for linguistic evolution and\nmathematical social behavioral analysis. In the model presented here, there are\n$N$ individuals and $K$ words. Our contribution is developing a robust method\nthat handles the case when $K = O(N)$. The initial condition plays a crucial\nrole in the ordering of the system. We find that the system with high Shannon\nentropy has a higher consensus time and a lower critical fraction of zealots\ncompared to low-entropy states. We also show that the critical number of\ncommitted agents decreases with the number of opinions and grows with the\ncommunity size for each word. These results complement earlier conclusions that\ndiversity of opinion is essential for evolution; without it, the system\nstagnates in the status quo [S. A. Marvel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 118702\n(2012)]. In contrast, our results suggest that committed minorities can more\neasily conquer highly diverse systems, showing them to be inherently unstable.\n", "  The existence of a minimum measurable length could deform not only the\nstandard quantum mechanics but also classical physics. The effects of the\nminimal length on classical orbits of particles in a gravitation field have\nbeen investigated before, using the deformed Poisson bracket or Schwarzschild\nmetric. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to study motions of\nparticles in the context of deformed Newtonian mechanics and general\nrelativity. Specifically, the precession of planetary orbits, deflection of\nlight, and time delay in radar propagation are considered in this paper. We\nalso set limits on the deformation parameter by comparing our results with the\nobservational measurements. Finally, comparison with results from previous\npapers is given at the end of this paper.\n", "  We study fluctuation properties of embedded random matrix ensembles of\nnon-interacting particles. For ensemble of two non-interacting particle\nsystems, we find that unlike the spectra of classical random matrices,\ncorrelation functions are non-stationary. In the locally stationary region of\nspectra, we study the number variance and the spacing distributions. The\nspacing distributions follow the Poisson statistics which is a key behavior of\nuncorrelated spectra. The number variance varies linearly as in the Poisson\ncase for short correlation lengths but a kind of regularization occurs for\nlarge correlation lengths, and the number variance approaches saturation\nvalues. These results are known in the study of integrable systems but are\nbeing demonstrated for the first time in random matrix theory. We conjecture\nthat the interacting particle cases, which exhibit the characteristics of\nclassical random matrices for short correlation lengths, will also show\nsaturation effects for large correlation lengths.\n", "  One examines putative corrections to the Bell operator due to the\nnoncommutativity in the phase-space. Starting from a Gaussian squeezed envelop\nwhose time evolution is driven by commutative (standard quantum mechanics) and\nnoncommutative dynamics respectively, one concludes that, although the time\nevolving covariance matrix in the noncommutative case is different from the\nstandard case, the squeezing parameter dominates and there are no noticeable\nnoncommutative corrections to the Bell operator. This indicates that, at least\nfor squeezed states, the privileged states to test Bell correlations,\nnoncommutativity versions of quantum mechnics remains as non-local as quantum\nmechanics itself.\n", "  We analyze the coagulation of dust in and around a gap opened by a\nJupiter-mass planet. To this end, we carry out a high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the gap environment, which is turbulent\ndue to the magnetorotational instability. From the MHD simulation, we obtain\nvalues of the gas velocities, densities and turbulent stresses a) close to the\ngap edge, b) in one of the two gas streams that accrete onto the planet, c)\ninside the low-density gap, and d) outside the gap. The MHD values are then\nsupplied to a Monte Carlo dust coagulation algorithm, which models grain\nsticking and compaction. We consider two dust populations for each region: one\nwhose initial size distribution is monodisperse, with monomer radius equal to 1\n$\\mu$m, and another one whose initial size distribution follows the\nMathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck distribution for interstellar dust grains, with an\ninitial range of monomer radii between 0.5 and 10 $\\mu$m. Our Monte Carlo\ncalculations show initial growth of dust aggregates followed by compaction in\nall cases but one, that of aggregates belonging to the initially monodisperse\npopulation subject to gas conditions outside the gap. In this latter case, the\nmass-weighted (MW) average porosity of the population reaches extremely high\nfinal values of 98\\%. The final MW porosities in all other cases range between\n30\\% and 82\\%. The efficiency of compaction is due to high turbulent relative\nspeeds between dust particles. Future studies will need to explore the effect\nof different planet masses and electric charge on grains.\n", "  We explore a prototypical two-dimensional model of the nonlinear Dirac type\nand examine its solitary wave and vortex solutions. In addition to identifying\nthe stationary states, we provide a systematic spectral stability analysis,\nillustrating the potential of spinor solutions consisting of a soliton in one\ncomponent and a vortex in the other to be neutrally stable in a wide parametric\ninterval of frequencies. Solutions of higher vorticity are generically unstable\nand split into lower charge vortices in a way that preserves the total\nvorticity. These results pave the way for a systematic stability and dynamics\nanalysis of higher dimensional waveforms in a broad class of nonlinear Dirac\nmodels and a comparison revealing nontrivial differences with respect to their\nbetter understood non-relativistic analogue, the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n", "  We performed high-resolution, 3D MHD simulations and we compared to\nobservations of translucent molecular clouds. We show that the observed\npopulations of rotational levels of H2 can arise as a consequence of the\nmulti-phase structure of the ISM.\n", "  We analyze the gravitational dynamics of a classical scalar field coupled to\ngravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which leads to black hole formation on\nthe shortest nonlinear time scale for some initial conditions. We show that the\nobserved collapse cannot be described by the well-known process of a\nrandom-phase cascade in the theory of weak turbulence. This implies that the\ndynamics on this time scale is highly sensitive to the phases of modes. We\nexplore the alternative possibility of a coherent phase cascade and\nanalytically find stationary solutions with completely coherent phases and\npower-law energy spectra. We show that these power-law spectra lead to\ndiverging geometric backreaction, which is the likely precursor to black hole\nformation. In 4+1 dimensions, our stationary solution has the same power law\nenergy spectrum as the final state right before collapse observed in numerical\nsimulations. We conjecture that our stationary solutions describe the system\nshortly before collapse in other dimensions, and predict the energy spectrum.\n", "  LaOBiS2-type materials have drawn much attention recently because of various\ninteresting physical properties, such as low-temperature superconductivity,\nhidden spin polarization, and electrically tunable Dirac cones. However, it was\ngenerally assumed that each LaOBiS2-type compound has a unique and specific\ncrystallographic structure (with a space group P4/nmm) separated from other\nphases. Using first-principles total energy and stability calculations we\nconfirm that the previous assignment of the centrosymetric P4/nmm structure to\nLaOBiS2 is incorrect as a phonon instability renders this structure impossible.\nFurthermore, we find that the unstable structure is replaced by a family of\nenergetically closely spaced modifications (polytypes) differing by the layer\nsequences and orientations. We find that the local Bi-S distortion leads to\nthree polytypes of LaOBiS2 with different stacking patterns of the distorted\nBiS2 layers. The energy difference between the polytypes of LaOBiS2 is merely\n~1 meV/u.c., indicating the possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real\nsample and that the particular distribution of polytypes may be growth-induced.\nThe in-plane distortion can be suppressed by pressure, leading to a phase\ntransition from polytypes to the high-symmetry P4/nmm structure with a pressure\nlarger than 2.5 GPa. In addition, different choices of the intermediate atoms\n(replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) could also manifest different ground\nstate structures. One can thus tune the distortion and the ground state by\npressure or substituting covalence atoms in LaOBiS2-family.\n", "  The origin of massive stars is a fundamental open issue in modern\nastrophysics. Pre-ALMA interferometric studies reveal precursors to early B to\nlate O type stars with collapsing envelopes of 15-20 M$_\\odot$ on 1000-3000 AU\nsize-scales. To search for more massive envelopes we selected the most massive\nnearby young clumps from the ATLASGAL survey to study their protostellar\ncontent with ALMA. Our first results using the intermediate scales revealed by\nthe ALMA ACA array providing 3-5\" angular resolution, corresponding to\n$\\sim$0.05-0.1 pc size-scales, reveals a sample of compact objects. These\nmassive dense cores are on average two-times more massive than previous studies\nof similar types of objects. We expect that once the full survey is completed,\nit will provide a comprehensive view on the origin of the most massive stars.\n", "  We investigate the ground state properties of the gaseous mixture of a single\nspecies of bosons and fermions at zero temperature, where bosons are major in\npopulation over fermions, and form the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The\nboson-boson and boson-fermion interactions are assumed to be weakly repulsive\nand attractive respectively, while the fermion-fermion interaction is absent\ndue to the Pauli exclusion for the low energy $s$-wave scattering. We treat\nfermions as a gas of polarons dressed with Bogoliubov phonons, which is an\nelementary excitation of the BEC, and evaluate the ground state properties with\nthe method developed by Lemmens, Devreese, and Brosens (LDB) originally for the\nelectron polaron gas, and also with a general extension of the Lee-Low-Pines\ntheory for many-body systems (eLLP), which incorporates the phonon drag effects\nas in the original LLP theory. The formulation of eLLP is developed and\ndiscussed in the present paper. The binding (interaction) energy of the polaron\ngas is calculated in these methods, and shown to be finite (negative) for the\ndilute gas of heavy fermions with attractive boson-fermion interactions, though\nthe suppression by the many-body effects exists.\n", "  We investigated the spin coherence of high-mobility two-dimensional electron\ngases confined in multilayer GaAs quantum wells. The dynamics of the spin\npolarization was optically studied using pump-probe techniques: time-resolved\nKerr rotation and resonant spin amplification. For double and triple quantum\nwells doped beyond the metal-to-insulator transition, the spin-orbit\ninteraction was tailored by the sample parameters of structural symmetry\n(Rashba constant), width and electron density (Dresselhaus linear and cubic\nconstants) which allows us to attain long dephasing times in the nanoseconds\nrange. The determination of the scales: transport scattering time,\nsingle-electron scattering time, electron-electron scattering time, and spin\npolarization decay time further supports the possibility of using n-doped\nmultilayer systems for developing spintronic devices.\n", "  We scrutinise the evidences recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations for compatible 750 GeV resonances which appear in the di-photon\nchannels of the two experiments in both the 8 TeV and 13 TeV datasets. Similar\nresonances in di-boson, di-lepton, di-jet and $t\\bar t$ final states are\ninstead not detected. After discussing the properties and the compatibility of\nthe reported signals, we study the implications on the physics beyond the\nStandard Model with particular emphasis on possible scalar extensions of the\ntheory such as singlet extensions and the two Higgs doublet models. We also\nanalyse the significance of the new experimental indications within the\nframeworks of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and of technicolour\nmodels. Our results show that a simple effective singlet extension of the SM\nachieves phenomenological viability with a minimal number of free parameters.\nThe minimal supersymmetric model and the two Higgs doublet model, on the other\nhand, cannot explain the 750 GeV di-photon excess. Compatibility with the\nobserved signal requires the extension of the particle content of these models,\nfor instance by heavy vector quarks in the case of the two Higgs doublet model.\n", "  We interpret $\\gamma$-ray flares from the Crab Nebula as the signature of\nturbulence in the pulsar's electromagnetic outflow. Turbulence is triggered\nupstream by dynamical instability of the wind's oscillating magnetic field, and\naccelerates non-thermal particles. On impacting the wind termination shock,\nthose particles emit a distinct synchrotron component $F_{\\nu,\\rm flare}$,\nwhich is constantly modulated by intermittency of the upstream plasma flow.\nFlares are observed when the high-energy cutoff of $F_{\\nu,\\rm flare}$ emerges\nabove the fast-declining nebular emission around 0.1 - 1 GeV. Simulations\ncarried out in the force-free electrodynamics approximation predict the striped\nwind to become fully turbulent well ahead of the wind termination shock,\nprovided its terminal Lorentz factor is $\\lesssim 10^4$.\n", "  We construct a new global, fully analytic, approximate spacetime which\naccurately describes the dynamics of non-precessing, spinning black hole\nbinaries during the inspiral phase of the relativistic merger process. This\napproximate solution of the vacuum Einstein's equations can be obtained by\nasymptotically matching perturbed Kerr solutions near the two black holes to a\npost-Newtonian metric valid far from the two black holes. This metric is then\nmatched to a post-Minkowskian metric even farther out in the wave zone. The\nprocedure of asymptotic matching is generalized to be valid on all spatial\nhypersurfaces, instead of a small group of initial hypersurfaces discussed in\nprevious works. This metric is well suited for long term dynamical simulations\nof spinning black hole binary spacetimes prior to merger, such as studies of\ncircumbinary gas accretion which requires hundreds of binary orbits.\n", "  This paper presents a new method of reconstructing the individual charged and\nneutral hadrons in tau decays with the ATLAS detector. The reconstructed\nhadrons are used to classify the decay mode and to calculate the visible\nfour-momentum of reconstructed tau candidates, significantly improving the\nresolution with respect to the calibration in the existing tau reconstruction.\nThe performance of the reconstruction algorithm is optimised and evaluated\nusing simulation and validated using samples of $Z\\to\\tau\\tau$ and\n$Z(\\to\\mu\\mu)$+jets events selected from proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 5 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Density functional theory is currently the most widely applied method in\nelectronic structure theory. The Kohn-Sham method, based on a fictitious system\nof non-interacting particles, is the work horse of the theory. The particular\nform of the Kohn-Sham wavefunction admits only idem-potent one electron density\nmatrices whereas wavefunctions of correlated electrons in post-Hartree-Fock\nmethods invariably have fractional occupation numbers. Here we show that by\ngeneralizing the orbital concept, and introducing a suitable dot-product as\nwell as a probability density a non-interacting system can be chosen that can\nrepresent the one-electron density matrix of any system, even one with\nfractional occupation numbers. This fictitious system ensures that the exact\nelectron density is accessible within density functional theory. It can also\nserve as the basis for reduced density matrix functional theory. Moreover, to\naid the analysis of the results the orbitals may be assigned energies from a\nmean-field Hamiltonian. This produces energy levels that are akin to\nHartree-Fock orbital energies such that conventional analyses based on Koopmans\ntheorem are available. Finally, this system is convenient in formalisms that\ndepend on creation and annihilation operators as they are trivially applied to\nsingle determinant wavefunctions.\n", "  We present the seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog, which is the first to\nbe based on the entire, uniformly processed, 48 month Kepler dataset. This is\nthe first fully automated catalog, employing robotic vetting procedures to\nuniformly evaluate every periodic signal detected by the Q1-Q17 Data Release 24\n(DR24) Kepler pipeline. While we prioritize uniform vetting over the absolute\ncorrectness of individual objects, we find that our robotic vetting is overall\ncomparable to, and in most cases is superior to, the human vetting procedures\nemployed by past catalogs. This catalog is the first to utilize artificial\ntransit injection to evaluate the performance of our vetting procedures and\nquantify potential biases, which are essential for accurate computation of\nplanetary occurrence rates. With respect to the cumulative Kepler Object of\nInterest (KOI) catalog, we designate 1,478 new KOIs, of which 402 are\ndispositioned as planet candidates (PCs). Also, 237 KOIs dispositioned as false\npositives (FPs) in previous Kepler catalogs have their disposition changed to\nPC and 118 PCs have their disposition changed to FP. This brings the total\nnumber of known KOIs to 8,826 and PCs to 4,696. We compare the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI\ncatalog to previous KOI catalogs, as well as ancillary Kepler catalogs, finding\ngood agreement between them. We highlight new PCs that are both potentially\nrocky and potentially in the habitable zone of their host stars, many of which\norbit solar-type stars. This work represents significant progress in accurately\ndetermining the fraction of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of\nSun-like stars. The full catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet\nArchive.\n", "  Creating accurate, analytic atom--atom potentials for small organic molecules\nfrom first principles can be a time-consuming and computationally intensive\ntask, particularly if we also require them to include explicit polarization\nterms, which are essential in many systems. In this first part of a two-part\ninvestigation, we describe how the {\\sc CamCASP} suite of programs can be used\nto generate such potentials using some of the most accurate electronic\nstructure methods currently applicable. In particular, we derive the long-range\nterms from monomer properties, and determine the short-range anisotropy\nparameters by a novel and robust method based on the iterated stockholder atom\napproach. We use the techniques described here to develop distributed multipole\nmodels for the electrostatic, polarization and dispersion interactions in the\npyridine dimer. In the second part of this work we will apply these methods to\ndevelop a series of many-body potentials for the pyridine system.\n", "  In Part I of this two-part investigation we described a methodology for the\ndevelopment of robust, analytic, many-body atom-atom potentials for small\norganic molecules from first principles and demonstrated how the CamCASP\nprogram can be used to derive the damped, distributed multipole models for\npyridine. Here we demonstrate how the theoretical ideas for the short-range\nmodels described in Part I, which are implemented in the CamCASP suite of\nprograms, can be used to develop a series of many-body potentials for the\npyridine system. Even the simplest of these potentials exhibit r.m.s. errors of\nonly about 0.6kJ mol-1 for the low-energy pyridine dimers, significantly\nsurpassing the best empirical potentials. Our best model is shown to support\neight stable minima, four of which have not been reported in the literature\nbefore. Further, the functional form can be made systematically more elaborate\nso as to improve the accuracy without a significant increase in the human-time\nspent in their generation. We investigate the effects of anisotropy, rank of\nmultipoles, and choice of polarizability and dispersion models.\n", "  A scheme is presented here to cancel out the topologically unfactorized\ninfrared divergences in the inclusive production of heavy quarkonia, which\naffect the NRQCD factorization of these processes. The heavy quarkonia are\ndefined as resonance states of QCD instead of color singlet heavy quark pair.\nThus the final heavy quark pair is nor necessarily to be color singlet. In\naddition, the heavy quarkonia are reconstructed by their decay products. As the\nresult, transition between states containing containing heavy quarks caused by\nexchanges of soft gluons are also taken into account here. Such cancellation is\ncrucial for the NRQCD factorization of these processes.\n", "  Precision timing of highly stable milli-second pulsars is a promising\ntechnique for the detection of very low frequency sources of gravitational\nwaves. In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as\nan additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,\nand so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of\npulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays. Here we consider how the prospects for detection are\ndiminished when the statistical isotropy of the timing array or the\ngravitational wave signal is broken by having a finite number of pulsars and a\nfinite number of sources. We find the standard tensor-correlation analysis to\nbe remarkably robust, with a mild impact on detectability compared to the\nisotropic limit. Only when there are very few sources and very few pulsars does\nthe standard analysis begin to fail. Having established that the tensor\ncorrelations are a robust signature for detection, we study the use of\n\"sky-scrambles\" to break the correlations as a way to increase confidence in a\ndetection. This approach is analogous to the use of \"time-slides\" in the\nanalysis of data from ground based interferometric detectors.\n", "  Superconducting MgB$\\_2$ shows an E$\\_{2g}$ zone center phonon, as measured\nby Raman spectroscopy, that is very broad in energy and temperature dependent.\nThe Raman shift and lifetime show large differences with the values elsewhere\nin the Brillouin Zone measured by Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS), where its\ndispersion can be accounted for by standard harmonic phonon theory, adding only\na moderate electron-phonon coupling. Here we show that the effects rapidly\ndisappear when electron-phonon coupling is switched off by Al substitution on\nthe Mg sites. Moreover, using IXS with very high wave-vector resolution in\nMgB$\\_2$, we can follow the dispersion connecting the Raman and the IXS signal,\nin agreement with a theory using only electron-phonon coupling but without\nstrong anharmonic terms. The observation is important in order to understand\nthe effects of electron-phonon coupling on zone center phonons modes in\nMgB$\\_2$, but also in all metals characterized by a small Fermi velocity in a\nparticular direction, typical for layered compounds.\n", "  We extend the formalism of the Einstein-Hilbert unimodular gravity in the\ncontext of modified $F(R)$ gravity. After appropriately modifying the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in a way that it becomes compatible to the\nunimodular condition of having a constant metric determinant, we derive the\nequations of motion of the unimodular $F(R)$ gravity by using the metric\nformalism of modified gravity with Lagrange multiplier constraint. The\nresulting equations are studied in frames of reconstruction method, which\nenables us to realize various cosmological scenarios, which was impossible to\nrealize in the standard Einstein-Hilbert unimodular gravity. Several unimodular\n$F(R)$ inflationary scenarios are presented, and in some cases, concordance\nwith Planck and BICEP2 observational data can be achieved.\n", "  The formation of bound states involving multiple particles underlies many\ninteresting quantum physical phenomena, such as Efimov physics or\nsuperconductivity. In this work we show the existence of an infinite number of\nsuch states for some boson impurity models. They describe free bosons coupled\nto an impurity and include some of the most representative models in quantum\noptics. We also propose a family of wavefunctions to describe the bound states\nand verify that it accurately characterizes all parameter regimes by comparing\nits predictions with exact numerical calculations for a one-dimensional\ntight-binding Hamiltonian. For that model, we also analyze the nature of the\nbound states by studying the scaling relations of physical quantities such as\nthe ground state energy and localization length, and find a non-analytical\nbehavior as a function of the coupling strength. Finally, we discuss how to\ntest our theoretical predictions in experimental platforms such as photonic\ncrystal structures and cold atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  We report the analysis of the three-body e+e- => B B-bar pi, B B*-bar pi, and\nB* B*-bar pi processes, including the first observation of the Zb+-(10610) =>[B\nB*-bar+c.c.]+- and Zb+-(10650) => [B*B*-bar]+- transitions. We measure visible\ncross sections for the three-body production of sigma_vis(e+e- => [B\nB*-bar+c.c.]+-pi-+=(11.2+-1.0(stat.)+-1.2(syst.)) pb and sigma_vis(e+e- =>\n[B*B*-bar]+-pi-+)=(5.61+-0.73(stat.)+-0.66(syst.)) pb and set a 90% C.L. upper\nlimit of sigma_vis(e+e- => [BB-bar]+-pi-+)<2.1 pb. The results are based on a\n121.4 1/fb data sample collected with the Belle detector at a center-of-mass\nenergy near the Y(5S) peak.\n", "  X-ray structure factors from four-component molecular wave functions have\nbeen calculated for the model systems $M$(C$_2$H$_2$) ($M$= Ni, Pd, Pt).\nRelativistic effects on the structure factors are investigated by the\ncomparison to results obtained from a non-relativistic reference and in order\nto systematically analyse the effect of different quasi-relativistic\napproximations, we also included the DKH2 and the ZORA Hamiltonian in our\nstudy. We show, that the overall effects of relativity on the structure factors\non average amount to 0.47, 0.80 and 1.27% for the three model systems under\ninvestigation, but that for individual reflections or reflection series the\neffects can be orders of magnitude larger. Employing the DKH2 or ZORA\nHamiltonian takes these effects into account to a large extend, reducing the\naccording differences by one order of magnitude. In order to determine the\nexperimental significance of the results, the magnitude of the relativistic\neffects on the structure factors is compared to the according changes due to\ncharge transfer and chemical bonding.\n", "  We explore several perturbative scenarios in which the di-photon excess at\n750 GeV can potentially be explained: a scalar singlet, a two Higgs doublet\nmodel (2HDM), a 2HDM with an extra singlet, and the decays of heavier\nresonances, both vector and scalar. We draw the following conclusions: (i) due\nto gauge invariance a 750 GeV scalar singlet can accommodate the observed\nexcess more readily than a scalar SU(2)_L doublet; (ii) scalar singlet\nproduction via gluon fusion is one option, however, vector boson fusion can\nalso provide a large enough rate, (iii) 2HDMs with an extra singlet and no\nextra fermions can only give a signal in a severely tuned region of the\nparameter space; (iv) decays of heavier resonances can give a large enough\ndi-photon signal at 750 GeV, while simultaneously explaining the absence of a\nsignal at 8 TeV.\n", "  Existing high-order variational drift kinetic theories contain unphysical\nrapidly varying modes that are not seen at low-orders. These unphysical modes,\nwhich may be rapidly oscillating, damped, or growing, are ushered in by a\nfailure of conventional high-order drift kinetic theory to preserve the\nstructure of its parent model's initial value problem (Vlasov-Poisson for\nelectrostatics, Vlasov-Darwin or Vlasov-Maxwell for electromagnetics.) In\nshort, the system phase space is unphysically enlarged in conventional\nhigh-order variational drift kinetic theory. I present an alternative,\n\"renormalized\" variational approach to drift kinetic theory that manifestly\nrespects the parent model's initial value problem. The basic philosophy\nunderlying this alternate approach is that high-order drift kinetic theory\nought to be derived by truncating the all-orders system phase space Lagrangian\ninstead of the usual \"field+particle\" Lagrangian. For the sake of clarity, this\nstory is told first through the lens of a finite-dimensional toy model of\nhigh-order variational drift kinetics, the analogous full-on drift kinetic\nresults are discussed subsequently. The renormalized drift kinetic system,\nwhile just as accurate as conventional formulations, does not support the\ntroublesome rapidly varying mode.\n", "  The diffusion of a molecular motor in the presence of a constant external\nforce is considered on the basis of a simple theoretical model. The motor is\nrepresented by a Brownian particle moving in a series of parabolic potentials\nplaced periodically on a line, and the potential is switched stochastically\nfrom one parabola to another by a chemical reaction, which corresponds to the\nATP hydrolysis or synthesis in motor proteins. It is found that the diffusion\ncoefficient as a function of the force exhibits peaks. The mechanism of this\ndiffusion enhancement and the possibility of observing it in F1-ATPase, a\nbiological rotary motor, are discussed.\n", "  Several stellar systems (white dwarfs, red giants, horizontal branch stars\nand possibly the neutron star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A) show a\nmild preference for a non-standard cooling mechanism when compared with\ntheoretical models. This exotic cooling could be provided by Weakly Interacting\nSlim Particles (WISPs), produced in the hot cores and abandoning the star\nunimpeded, contributing directly to the energy loss. Taken individually, these\nexcesses do not show a strong statistical weight. However, if one mechanism\ncould consistently explain several of them, the hint could be significant. We\nanalyze the hints in terms of neutrino anomalous magnetic moments, minicharged\nparticles, hidden photons and axion-like particles (ALPs). Among them, the ALP\nor a massless HP represent the best solution. Interestingly, the hinted ALP\nparameter space is accessible to the next generation proposed ALP searches,\nsuch as ALPS II and IAXO and the massless HP requires a multi TeV energy scale\nof new physics that might be accessible at the LHC.\n", "  We investigate oscillating solutions of the equation of motion for the Higgs\npotential. The solutions are described by Jacobian elliptic functions.\nClassifying the classical solutions, we evaluate a possible parameter-space for\nthe initial conditions. In order to construct the field theory around the\noscillating solutions quantum fluctuations are introduced. This alternative\nperturbation method is useful to describe the non-trivial quantum theory around\nthe oscillating state. This perturbation theory reduces to the standard one if\nwe take the solution at the vacuum expectation value. It is shown that the\ntransition probability between the vacuum and multi-quanta states is finite as\nlong as the initial field configuration does not start from the true vacuum.\n", "  This study is purposed to derive the equation of motion for geodesics in\nvicinity of spacetime of a (2 + 1)-dimensional charged BTZ black hole. In this\npaper, we solve geodesics for both massive and massless particles in terms of\nWeierstrass elliptic and Kleinian sigma hyper-elliptic functions. Then we\ndetermine different trajectories of motion for particles in terms of conserved\nenergy and angular momentum and also using effective potential.\n", "  The skewness and the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions are computed\nwithin QCD-improved low energy effective models including quantum thermal and\ndensity fluctuations. The results are compared with the Beam Energy Scan\nexperiment at RHIC. The theoretical results agree with the experimental\nmeasurements up to errors, for the collision energy $\\sqrt{s}\\ge\n19.6\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. For smaller collision energies a discrepancy between\ntheoretical and experimental results develops. This discrepancy partially\nrelates to the lack of precision of the current setup for small collision\nenergies. It is outlined how this deficiency can be overcome.\n", "  In AdS5/CFT4 integrability the Bethe ansatz gives the spectrum of long\nstrings, accurate up to exponentially small corrections. This is no longer true\nin AdS3, as we demonstrate here by studying Luscher F-terms with a massless\nparticle running in the loop. We apply this to the classic test of Hernandez &\nLopez, in which the su(2) sector Bethe equations (including one-loop dressing\nphase) should match the semiclassical string theory result for a circular\nspinning string. These calculations did not agree in AdS3xS3xT4, and we show\nthat the sum of all massless Luscher F-terms can reproduce the difference.\n", "  Gauge/Gravity duality as a theory of matter needs a systematic way to\ncharacterise a system. We suggest a `dimensional lifting' of the least\nirrelevant interaction to the bulk theory. As an example, we consider the\nspin-orbit interaction, which causes magneto-electric interaction term. We show\nthat its lifting is an axionic coupling. We present an exact and analytic\nsolution describing diamagnetic response. Experimental data on annealed\ngraphite shows a remarkable similarity to our theoretical result. We also find\nan analytic formulas of DC transport coefficients, according to which, the\nanomalous Hall coefficient interpolates between the coherent metallic regime\nwith $\\rho_{xx}^{2}$ and incoherent metallic regime with $\\rho_{xx}$ as we\nincrease the disorder parameter $\\beta$. The strength of the spin-orbit\ninteraction also interpolates between the two scaling regimes.\n", "  We analyse the energy spectra of Dirac fermions in the presence of rotation\nand magnetic field. We find that the Landau degeneracy is resolved by rotation.\nA drastic change in the energy dispersion relation leads to the \"rotational\nmagnetic inhibition\" that is a novel phenomenon analogous to the inverse\nmagnetic catalysis in a magnetic system at finite chemical potential.\n", "  We study the equilibration of a class of far-from-equilibrium strongly\ninteracting systems using gauge/gravity duality. The systems we analyse are 2+1\ndimensional and have a four dimensional gravitational dual. A prototype example\nof a system we analyse is the equilibration of a two dimensional fluid which is\ntranslational invariant in one direction and is attached to two different heat\nbaths with different temperatures at infinity in the other direction. We\nrealise such setup in gauge/gravity duality by joining two semi-infinite\nasymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black branes of different temperatures,\nwhich subsequently evolve towards equilibrium by emitting gravitational\nradiation towards the boundary of AdS. At sufficiently late times the solution\nconverges to a similarity solution, which is only sensitive to the left and\nright equilibrium states and not to the details of the initial conditions. This\nattractor solution not only incorporates the growing region of equilibrated\nplasma but also the outwardly-propagating transition regions, and can be\nconstructed by solving a single ordinary differential equation.\n", "  We report on the first realization of an integrated optical memory for light\nbased on a laser written waveguide in a doped crystal. Using femto-second laser\nmicromachining, we fabricate waveguides in Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. We\ndemonstrate that the waveguide inscription does not affect the coherence\nproperties of the material and that the light confinement in the waveguide\nincreases the interaction with the active ions by a factor 6. We also\ndemonstrate that, analogously to the bulk crystals, we can operate the optical\npumping protocols necessary to prepare the population in atomic frequency\ncombs, that we use to demonstrate light storage in excited and spin states of\nthe Praseodymium ions. Our results represent the first realization of laser\nwritten waveguides in a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal and the first\nimplementation of an integrated on-demand spin wave optical memory. They open\nnew perspectives for integrated quantum memories.\n", "  We measure the redshift evolution of galaxy bias for a magnitude-limited\ngalaxy sample by combining the galaxy density maps and weak lensing shear maps\nfor a $\\sim$116 deg$^{2}$ area of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science\nVerification data. This method was first developed in Amara et al. (2012) and\nlater re-examined in a companion paper (Pujol et al. 2016) with rigorous\nsimulation tests and analytical treatment of tomographic measurements. In this\nwork we apply this method to the DES SV data and measure the galaxy bias for a\ni$<$22.5 galaxy sample. We find the galaxy bias and 1$\\sigma$ error bars in 4\nphotometric redshift bins to be 1.12$\\pm$0.19 (z=0.2-0.4), 0.97$\\pm$0.15\n(z=0.4-0.6), 1.38$\\pm$0.39 (z=0.6-0.8)), and 1.45$\\pm$0.56 (z=0.8-1.0). These\nmeasurements are consistent at the 2$\\sigma$ level with measurements on the\nsame dataset using galaxy clustering and cross-correlation of galaxies with CMB\nlensing, with most of the redshift bins consistent within the 1{\\sigma} error\nbars. In addition, our method provides the only $\\sigma_8$-independent\nconstraint among the three. We forward-model the main observational effects\nusing mock galaxy catalogs by including shape noise, photo-z errors and masking\neffects. We show that our bias measurement from the data is consistent with\nthat expected from simulations. With the forthcoming full DES data set, we\nexpect this method to provide additional constraints on the galaxy bias\nmeasurement from more traditional methods. Furthermore, in the process of our\nmeasurement, we build up a 3D mass map that allows further exploration of the\ndark matter distribution and its relation to galaxy evolution.\n", "  The production mechanism of a 750 GeV diphoton resonance, either via gluon or\nphoton fusion, can be probed by studying kinematic observables in the diphoton\nevents. We perform a detector study of the two production modes of a\nhypothetical scalar or tensor diphoton resonance in order to characterize the\nfeatures of the two scenarios. The nature of the resonance production can be\ndetermined from the jet multiplicity, the jet and diphoton rapidities, the rate\nof central pseudorapidity gaps, or the possible detection of forward protons\nfrom elastic photoproduction for events in the signal region. Kinematic\ndistributions for both signals and expected irreducible diphoton background\nevents are provided for comparison along with a study of observables useful for\ndistinguishing the two scenarios at an integrated luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$.\nWe find that decay photons from a 750 GeV scalar resonance have a preference\nfor acceptance in the central detector barrel, while background events are more\nlikely to give accepted photons in the detector end caps. This disfavors the\ninterpretation of the large number of excess events found by the the Run-2 CMS\ndiphoton search with one photon detected in the end cap as a wide spin-0\nresonance signal. However, one expects more end cap photons in the case of\nspin-2 resonance.\n", "  Since the announcement in 2011 of the Materials Genome Initiative by the\nObama administration, much attention has been given to the subject of materials\ndesign to accelerate the discovery of new materials that could have\ntechnological implications. Although having its biggest impact for more applied\nmaterials like batteries, there is increasing interest in applying these ideas\nto predict new superconductors. This is obviously a challenge, given that\nsuperconductivity is a many body phenomenon, with whole classes of known\nsuperconductors lacking a quantitative theory. Given this caveat, various\nefforts to formulate materials design principles for superconductors are\nreviewed here, with a focus on surveying the periodic table in an attempt to\nidentify cuprate analogues.\n", "  We present temporal intensity correlation measurements of light scattered by\na hot atomic vapor. Clear evidence of photon bunching is shown at very short\ntime-scales (nanoseconds) imposed by the Doppler broadening of the hot vapor.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that relevant information about the scattering\nprocess, such as the ratio of single to multiple scattering, can be deduced\nfrom the measured intensity correlation function. These measurements confirm\nthe interest of temporal intensity correlation to access non-trivial spectral\nfeatures, with potential applications in astrophysics.\n", "  We study a model of bacterial dynamics where two interacting random walkers\nperform run-and-tumble motion on a one-dimensional lattice under mutual\nexclusion and find an exact expression for the probability distribution in the\nsteady state. This stationary distribution has a rich structure comprising\nthree components: a jammed component, where the particles are adjacent and\nblock each other; an attractive component, where the probability distribution\nfor the distance between particles decays exponentially; and an extended\ncomponent in which the distance between particles is uniformly distributed. The\nattraction between the particles is sufficiently strong that even in the limit\nwhere continuous space is recovered for a finite system, the two walkers spend\na finite fraction of time in a jammed configuration. Our results potentially\nprovide a route to understanding the motility-induced phase separation\ncharacteristic of active matter from a microscopic perspective.\n", "  We revisit the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, which has\nbeen predicted to be a chiral spin liquid by mean-field theory [G. Szirmai et\nal., Phys. Rev. A 84, 011611 (2011)]. Using exact diagonalizations of finite\nclusters, infinite projected entangled pair states simulations, and variational\nMonte Carlo simulations based on Gutzwiller projected wave functions, we\nprovide strong evidence in favour of the competing plaquette state, which was\nreported to be higher but close by in energy according to mean-field theory.\nThis is further confirmed by the investigation of the model with a ring\nexchange term, which shows that there is a transition between the plaquette\nstate and the chiral state at a finite value of the ring exchange term.\n", "  Topological effects continue to fascinate physicists since more than three\ndecades. One of their main applications are high-precision measurements of the\nresistivity. We propose to make also use of the spatially separated edge\nstates. It is possible to realize strongly direction-dependent group\nvelocities. They can also be tuned over orders of magnitude so that robust\ndelay lines and interference devices are within reach.\n", "  Colloidal quantum dots are promising next-generation phosphors to enhance the\ncolor rendition of light-emitting devices (LEDs) while minimizing the\nbrightness drop. In order to exploit the beneficial tunability of quantum dots\nfor highly efficient devices, optimization and determination of the performance\nlimit are of crucial importance. In this work, a facile preparation process of\nred-emission quantum dot films and simulation algorithm for fitting this film\nwith two commercial LED flat lamps to the optimized performance are developed.\nBased on the algorithm, one lamp improves from cold-white light (8669 K) with\npoor color rendition ($R_{a}=72$) and luminous efficacy (85 lm/W) to warm-white\nlight (2867 K) with $R_{a}=90.8$ and $R_{9}=74.9$, and the other reaches\n$R_{a}=93\\sim95$. Impressively, the brightness drop is only about $15\\sim20\\%$.\nFurthermore, our device shows reliability over 1000 hours with only PET\n(polyethylene-terephthalate) films as the barrier, indicating that this\nauxiliary red-emission film can be easily applied to improve the color\nrendition of most commercial LED flat lamps.\n", "  We provide several examples and an intuitive diagrammatic representation\ndemonstrating the use of two-qubit unitary transformations for mapping coupled\nspin Hamiltonians to simpler ones and vice versa. The corresponding dualities\nmay be exploited to identify phase transition points or to aid the\ndiagonalization of such Hamiltonians. For example, our method shows that a\nsuitable one-parameter family of coupled Hamiltonians whose ground states\ntransform from an initially factorizing state to a final cluster state on a\nlattice of arbitrary dimension is dual to a family of trivial decoupled\nHamiltonians containing local on-site terms only. As a consequence, the minimum\nenery gap (which determines the adiabatic run-time) does not scale with system\nsize, which facilitates an efficient and simple adiabatic preparation of e.g.\nthe two-dimensional cluster state used for measurement-based quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  The rich phenomenology of plasmonic excitations in the dichalcogenides is\nanalyzed as a function of doping. The many-body polarization, the dielectric\nresponse function and electron energy loss spectra are calculated using an ab\ninitio based model involving material-realistic Coulomb interactions, band\nstructure and spin-orbit coupling. Focusing on the representative case of\nMoS$_2$, a plethora of plasmon bands are observed, originating from scattering\nprocesses within and between the conduction or valence band valleys. We discuss\nthe resulting square-root and linear collective modes, arising from long-range\nversus short-range screening of the Coulomb potential. We show that the\nmulti-orbital nature of the bands and spin-orbit coupling strongly affects\ninter-valley scattering processes by gapping certain two-particle modes at\nlarge momentum transfer.\n", "  We study the proximity effect between an s-wave superconductor (SC) and the\nsurface states of a Weyl semimetal. An interesting two-dimensional SC forms in\nsuch an interface with properties resembling in certain aspects the Fu-Kane\nsuperconductor with some notable differences. In a Weyl semimetal with unbroken\ntime reversal symmetry the interface SC supports completely flat Majorana bands\nin a linear Josephson junction with a {\\pi} phase difference. We discuss\nstability of these bands against disorder and propose ways in which they can be\nobserved experimentally.\n", "  Weinberg's asymptotic safety scenario provides an elegant mechanism to\nconstruct a quantum theory of gravity within the framework of quantum field\ntheory based on a non-Gau{\\ss}ian fixed point of the renormalization group\nflow. In this work we report novel evidence for the validity of this scenario,\nusing functional renormalization group techniques to determine the\nrenormalization group flow of the Einstein-Hilbert action supplemented by the\ntwo-loop counterterm found by Goroff and Sagnotti. The resulting system of beta\nfunctions comprises three scale-dependent coupling constants and exhibits a\nnon-Gau{\\ss}ian fixed point which constitutes the natural extension of the one\nfound at the level of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The fixed point exhibits two\nultraviolet attractive and one repulsive direction supporting a low-dimensional\nUV-critical hypersurface. Our result vanquishes the longstanding criticism that\nasymptotic safety will not survive once a \"proper perturbative counterterm\" is\nincluded in the projection space.\n", "  Demonstrating how microscopic dynamics cause large systems to approach\nthermal equilibrium remains an elusive, longstanding, and actively-pursued goal\nof statistical mechanics. We identify here a dynamical mechanism for\nthermalization in a general class of two-component dynamical Lorentz gases, and\nprove that each component, even when maintained in a non-equilibrium state\nitself, can drive the other to a thermal state with a well-defined effective\ntemperature.\n", "  We study the supersymmetry projection rules on exotic branes in type II\nstring theories and M-theory. They justify the validity of the exotic duality\nbetween standard branes and exotic branes of codimension two. By virtue of the\nsupersymmetry projection rules on various branes, we can consider a system that\ninvolves multiple non-parallel exotic branes in the nongeometric background.\n", "  Using the Vakarchuk formulae for the density matrix, we calculate the number\nN_k of atoms with momentum \\hbar k for the ground state of a uniform\none-dimensional periodic system of interacting bosons. We obtain for\nimpenetrable point bosons N_0 = 2\\sqrt{N} and N_{k=2\\pi j/L} =\n0.31N_{0}/\\sqrt{|j|}. That is, there is no condensate or quasicondensate on low\nlevels at large N. For almost point bosons with weak coupling\n(\\beta=\\frac{\\nu_{0}m}{\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}n} \\ll 1), we obtain N_{0}/N =\n(\\frac{2}{N\\sqrt{\\beta}})^{\\sqrt{\\beta}/2} and N_{k=2\\pi j/L} =\n\\frac{N_0\\sqrt{\\beta}}{4|j|^{1-\\sqrt{\\beta}/2}}. In this case, the\nquasicondensate exists on the level with k=0 and on low levels with k\\neq 0, if\nN is large and $\\beta$ is small (e.g., for N = 10^{10}, \\beta = 0.01). A method\nof measurement of such fragmented quasicondensate is proposed.\n", "  We give expressions for all generalized polylogarithms up to weight four in\nterms of the functions log, $\\text{Li}_n$, and $\\text{Li}_{2,2}$, valid for\narbitrary complex variables. Furthermore we provide algorithms for manipulation\nand numerical evaluation of $\\text{Li}_n$ and $\\text{Li}_{2,2}$, and add codes\nin Mathematica and C++ implementing the results. With these results we\ncalculate a number of previously unknown integrals, which we add in App. C.\n", "  The formation environment of stars in massive stellar clusters is similar to\nthe environment of stars forming in galaxies at a redshift of 1 - 3, at the\npeak star formation rate density of the Universe. As massive clusters are still\nforming at the present day at a fraction of the distance to high-redshift\ngalaxies they offer an opportunity to understand the processes controlling star\nformation and feedback in conditions similar to those in which most stars in\nthe Universe formed. Here we describe a system of massive clusters and their\nprogenitor gas clouds in the centre of the Milky Way, and outline how detailed\nobservations of this system may be able to: (i) help answer some of the\nfundamental open questions in star formation and (ii) quantify how stellar\nfeedback couples to the surrounding interstellar medium in this high-pressure,\nhigh-redshift analogue environment.\n", "  Long-term X-ray variability of the black hole binary, Cygnus X-1, was studied\nwith five years of MAXI data from 2009 to 2014, which include substantial\nperiods of the high/soft state, as well as the low/hard state. In each state,\nNormalized Power Spectrum densities (NPSDs) were calculated in three energy\nbands of 2-4 keV, 4-10 keV and 10-20 keV. The NPSDs in a frequency from 1e-7 Hz\nto 1e-4 Hz are all approximated by a power-law function with an index -1.35 ~\n-1.29. The fractional RMS variation ($\\eta$), calculated in the above frequency\nrange, was found to show the following three properties; (1) $\\eta$ slightly\ndecreases with energy in the low/hard state; (2) $\\eta$ increases towards\nhigher energies in the high/soft state; and (3) in the 10-20 keV band, $\\eta$\nis 3 times higher in the high/soft state than in the low/hard state. These\nproperties were confirmed through studies of intensity-correlated changes of\nthe MAXI spectra. Of these three findings, the first one is consistent with\nthat seen in the short-term variability during the LHS. The latter two can be\nunderstood as a result of high variability of the hard-tail component seen in\nthe high/soft state with the above very low frequency range, although the\norigin of the variability remains inconclusive.\n", "  Following a methodology similar to \\cite{Alishahiha:2015rta}, we derive a\nholographic complexity for two dimensional holographic superconductors\n(gauge/string superconductors) with backreactions. Applying a perturbation\nmethod proposed by Kanno in Ref. \\cite{kanno}, we study behaviors of the\ncomplexity for a dual quantum system near critical points. We show that when a\nsystem moves from the normal phase ($T>T_c$) to the superconductor phase\n($T<T_c$), the holographic complexity will be divergent.\n", "  Ellerman bombs are transient brightenings of the wings of the Balmer lines\nthat uniquely mark reconnection in the solar photosphere. They are also bright\nin strong Ca II and ultraviolet lines and in ultraviolet continua, but they are\nnot visible in the optical continuum and the Na I D and Mg I b lines. These\ndiscordant visibilities invalidate all published Ellerman bomb modeling. I\nargue that the assumption of Saha-Boltzmann lower-level populations is\ninformative to estimate bomb-onset opacities for these diverse diagnostics,\neven and especially for H-alpha, and employ such estimates to gauge the\nvisibilities of Ellerman bomb onsets in all of them. They constrain Ellerman\nbomb formation to temperatures 10,000 - 20,000 K and hydrogen densities around\n10^15 cm^-3. Similar arguments likely hold for H-alpha visibility in other\ntransient phenomena with hot and dense onsets.\n", "  The Spinning Effective One Body-Numerical Relativity (SEOBNR) series of\ngravitational wave approximants are among the best available for Advanced LIGO\ndata analysis. Unfortunately, SEOBNR codes as they currently exist within\nLALSuite are generally too slow to be directly useful for standard Markov-Chain\nMonte Carlo-based parameter estimation (PE). Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) of\nSEOBNR have been developed for this purpose, but there is no known way to make\nROMs of the full eight-dimensional intrinsic parameter space more efficient for\nPE than the SEOBNR codes directly. So as a proof of principle, we have sped up\nthe original LALSuite SEOBNRv2 approximant code, which models waveforms from\naligned-spin systems, by nearly 300x. Our optimized code shortens the timescale\nfor conducting PE with this approximant to months, assuming a purely serial\nanalysis, so that even modest parallelization combined with our optimized code\nwill make running the full PE pipeline with SEOBNR codes directly a realistic\npossibility. A number of our SEOBNRv2 optimizations have already been applied\nto SEOBNRv3, a new approximant capable of modeling sources with all eight\n(precessing) intrinsic degrees of freedom. We anticipate that once all of our\noptimizations have been applied to SEOBNRv3, a similar speed-up may be\nachieved.\n", "  The spin fluctuations of electron and hole doped self-assembled quantum dot\nensembles are measured optically in the low-intensity limit of a probe laser in\nabsence and presence of longitudinal or transverse static magnetic fields. The\nexperimental results are modeled by two complementary approaches based either\non semiclassical or quantum mechanical descriptions. This allows us to\ncharacterize the hyperfine interaction of electron and hole spins with the\nsurrounding bath of nuclei on time scales covering several orders of magnitude.\nOur results demonstrate (i) the intrinsic precession of the electron spin\nfluctuations around the effective nuclear Overhauser field caused by the host\nlattice nuclear spins, (ii) the comparably long time scales for electron and\nhole spin decoherence, as well as (iii) the dramatic enhancement of the spin\nlifetimes induced by a longitudinal magnetic field due to the decoupling of\nnuclear and charge carrier spins.\n", "  We report on radio timing and multiwavelength observations of the 4.66 ms\nredback pulsar J1048+2339, which was discovered in an Arecibo search targeting\nthe Fermi-LAT source 3FGLJ1048.6+2338. Two years of timing allowed us to derive\nprecise astrometric and orbital parameters for the pulsar. PSR J1048+2339 is in\na 6-hour binary, and exhibits radio eclipses over half the orbital period and\nrapid orbital period variations. The companion has a minimum mass of 0.3 solar\nmasses, and we have identified a $V \\sim 20$ variable optical counterpart in\ndata from several surveys. The phasing of its $\\sim 1$~mag modulation at the\norbital period suggests highly efficient and asymmetric heating by the pulsar\nwind, which may be due to an intrabinary shock that is distorted near the\ncompanion, or to the companion's magnetic field channeling the pulsar wind to\nspecific locations on its surface. We also present gamma-ray spectral analysis\nof the source and preliminary results from searches for gamma-ray pulsations\nusing the radio ephemeris.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the supercurrent in a clean carbon nanotube\nquantum dot, close to orbital degeneracy, connected to superconducting leads in\na regime of strong competition between local electronic correlations and\nsuperconducting proximity effect. For an odd occupancy of the dot and\nintermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the\nnormal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to\nsinglet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a\nsingle-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to\nnegative (0 to $\\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between\nthe Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature\nequals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first\norder quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across\nthe junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase\nrelations. In addition, the very specific electronic configuration of clean\ncarbon nanotubes, with two nearly orbitally degenerated states, leads to\ndifferent physics depending whether only one or both quasi-degenerate upper\nlevels of the dots participate to transport, which is determined by their\noccupancy and relative widths. When the transport of Cooper pairs takes place\nthrough only one of these levels, we find that the phase diagram of the\nphase-dependent 0-$\\pi$ transition is a universal characteristic of a\ndiscontinuous level-crossing quantum transition at zero temperature. In the\ncase were two levels participate to transport, the nanotube Josephson current\nexhibits a continuous 0-$\\pi$ transition, independent of the superconducting\nphase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the transition.\n", "  Coherent conversion of microwave and optical photons in the single-quantum\nlevel can significantly expand our ability to process signals in various\nfields. Efficient up-conversion of a feeble signal in the microwave domain to\nthe optical domain will lead to quantum-noise-limited microwave amplifiers.\nCoherent exchange between optical photons and microwave photons will also be a\nstepping stone to realize long-distance quantum communication. Here we\ndemonstrate bidirectional and coherent conversion between microwave and light\nusing collective spin excitations in a ferromagnet. The converter consists of\ntwo harmonic oscillator modes, a microwave cavity mode and a magnetostatic mode\ncalled Kittel mode, where microwave photons and magnons in the respective modes\nare strongly coupled and hybridized. An itinerant microwave field and a\ntravelling optical field can be coupled through the hybrid system, where the\nmicrowave field is coupled to the hybrid system through the cavity mode, while\nthe optical field addresses the hybrid system through the Kittel mode via\nFaraday and inverse Faraday effects. The conversion efficiency is theoretically\nanalyzed and experimentally evaluated. The possible schemes for improving the\nefficiency are also discussed.\n", "  We show that when a supernova explodes, a nearby pulsar signal goes through a\nvery specific change. The observed period first changes smoothly, then is\nfollowed by a sudden change in the time derivative. A stable millisecond pulsar\ncan allow us to measure such an effect. This may improve our measurement of the\ntotal energy released in neutrinos and also the orientation of the\nsupernova-pulsar system.\n", "  We develop a new semiclassical approach, which starts with the density matrix\ngiven by the Euclidean time path integral with fixed coinciding endpoints, and\nproceed by identifying classical (minimal Euclidean action) path, to be\nreferred to as {\\it flucton}, which passes through this endpoint. Fluctuations\naround flucton path are included, by standard Feynman diagrams, previously\ndeveloped for instantons. We calculate the Green function and evaluate the one\nloop determinant both by direct diagonalization of the fluctuation equation,\nand also via the trick with the Green functions. The two-loop corrections are\nevaluated by explicit Feynman diagrams, and some curious cancellation of\nlogarithmic and polylog terms is observed. The results are fully consistent\nwith large-distance asymptotics obtained in quantum mechanics. Two classic\nexamples -- quartic double-well and sine-Gordon potentials -- are discussed in\ndetail, while power-like potential and quartic anharmonic oscillator are\ndiscussed in brief. Unlike other semiclassical methods, like WKB, we do not use\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, and all the steps generalize to multi-dimensional\nor quantum fields cases straightforwardly.\n", "  We obtain T--duality invariant second order differential equations satisfied\nby the $D^8\\mathcal{R}^4$ and $D^{10} \\mathcal{R}^4$ interactions from the low\nenergy expansion of the one loop four graviton amplitude in toroidally\ncompactified type II string theory. The eigenvalues of these equations are\ncompletely determined by the structure of the one loop integrands. Unlike the\nBPS interactions, these non--BPS interactions satisfy Poisson equations having\nsource terms that receive contributions from both the bulk and boundary of the\nworldsheet moduli space. We explicitly solve these equations in nine\ndimensions.\n", "  Typical behavior of the linear programming (LP) problem is studied as a\nrelaxation of the minimum vertex cover, a type of integer programming (IP)\nproblem. A lattice-gas model on the Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random graphs of\n$\\alpha$-uniform hyperedges is proposed to express both the LP and IP problems\nof the min-VC in the common statistical-mechanical model with a one-parameter\nfamily. Statistical-mechanical analyses reveal for $\\alpha=2$ that the LP\noptimal solution is typically equal to that given by the IP below the critical\naverage degree $c=e$ in the thermodynamic limit. The critical threshold for\ngood accuracy of the relaxation extends the mathematical result $c=1$, and\ncoincides with the replica symmetry-breaking threshold of the IP. The LP\nrelaxation for the minimum hitting sets with $\\alpha\\geq 3$, minimum vertex\ncovers on $\\alpha$-uniform random graphs, is also studied. Analytic and\nnumerical results strongly suggest that the LP relaxation fails to estimate\noptimal values above the critical average degree $c=e/(\\alpha-1)$ where the\nreplica symmetry is broken.\n", "  In this work, we use charge extraction via organic overlayer deposition to\nlower the chemical potential of topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin films into\nthe intrinsic (bulk-insulating) regime. We demonstrate the tuning and\nstabilization of intrinsic topological insulators at high mobility with\nlow-cost organic films. With the protection of the organic charge extraction\nlayers tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane(F4TCNQ) or\ntris(acetylacetonato)cobalt(III) (Co(acac)3), the sample is stable in the\natmosphere with chemical potential ~135 meV above the Dirac point (85 meV below\nthe conduction band minimum, well within the topological insulator regime)\nafter four months, which is an extraordinary level of environmental stability.\nThe Co complex represents the first use of an organometallic for modulating TI\ncharge density. The mobility of surface state electrons is enhanced as high as\n~2000 cm2/Vs. Even at room temperature, a true topologically insulating state\nis realized and stabilized for months' exposure to the atmosphere.\n", "  In this article, we present an approach for the thermodynamics of phase\noscillators induced by an internal multiplicative noise. We analytically derive\nthe free energy, entropy, internal energy, and specific heat. In this\nframework, the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics requires the\ndefinition of a synchronization field acting on the phase oscillators. By\nintroducing the synchronization field, we have consistently obtained the\nsusceptibility and analyzed its behavior. This allows us to characterize\ndistinct phases in the system, which we have denoted as synchronized and\nparasynchronized phases, in analogy with magnetism. The system also shows a\nrich complex behavior, exhibiting ideal gas characteristics for low\ntemperatures and susceptibility anomalies that are similar to those present in\ncomplex fluids such as water.\n", "  We searched for precursive soft X-ray flashes (SXFs) associated with\noptically-discovered classical or recurrent novae in the data of five-years\nall-sky observations with\n  Gas Slit Camera (GSC) of the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). We first\ndeveloped a tool to measure fluxes of point sources by fitting the event\ndistribution with the model that incorporates the point-spread function\n(PSF-fit) to minimize the potential contamination from nearby sources. Then we\napplied the PSF-fit tool to 40 classical/recurrent novae that were discovered\nin optical observations from 2009 August to 2014 August. We found no precursive\nSXFs with significance above $3 \\sigma$ level in the energy range of 2$-$4 keV\nbetween $t_{d}-10$d and $t_{d}$, where $t_{d}$ is the date when each nova was\ndiscovered. We obtained the upper limits for the bolometric luminosity of SXFs,\nand compared them with the theoretical prediction and that observed for MAXI\nJ0158$-$744. This result could constrain the population of massive white dwarfs\nwith a mass of roughly 1.40 solar mass, or larger, in binary systems.\n", "  We study the response of high-critical current proximity Josephson junctions\nto a microwave excitation. Electron over-heating in such devices is known to\ncreate hysteretic dc voltage-current characteristics. Here we demonstrate that\nit also strongly influences the ac response. The interplay of electron\nover-heating and ac Josephson dynamics is revealed by the evolution of the\nShapiro steps with the microwave drive amplitude. Extending the resistively\nshunted Josephson junction model by including a thermal balance for the\nelectronic bath coupled to phonons, a strong electron over-heating is obtained.\n", "  Topological phases with large Chern numbers have important implications. They\nwere previously predicted to exist by considering fabricated long-range\ninteractions or multi-layered materials. Stimulated by recent wide interests in\nFloquet topological phases, here we propose a scheme to engineer\nlarge-Chern-number phases with ease by periodic quenching. Using a two-band\nsystem as an example, we theoretically show how a variety of topological phases\nwith widely tunable Chern numbers can be generated by periodic quenching\nbetween two simple Hamiltonians that otherwise give low Chern numbers. The\nobtained large Chern numbers are explained through the emergence of multiple\nDirac cones in the Floquet spectra. The transition lines between different\ntopological phases in the two-band model are also explicitly found, thus\nestablishing a class of easily solvable but very rich systems useful for\nfurther understandings and applications of topological phases in periodically\ndriven systems.\n", "  Using Floquet theory, we illustrate that Floquet Weyl fermions can be created\nin circularly-polarised-light-irradiated three-dimensional stacked graphene\nsystems. One or two semi-Dirac points can be formed due to overlapping of\nFloquet sub-bands. Each pair of Weyl points have a two-component semi-Dirac\npoint parent, instead of a four-component Dirac point parent. Decreasing the\nlight frequency will make the Weyl points move in the momentum space, and the\nWeyl points can approach to the Dirac points when the frequency becomes very\nsmall. The frequency-amplitude phase diagram is worked out. It is shown that\nthere exist Fermi arcs in the surface Brillouin zones in\ncircularly-polarised-light-irradiated semi-infinitely-stacked and\nfinitely-multilayered graphene systems. The Floquet Weyl points emerging due to\nthe overlap of Floquet sub-bands provide a new platform to study Weyl fermions.\n", "  We present a real-time supernova neutrino burst monitor at Super-Kamiokande\n(SK). Detecting supernova explosions by neutrinos in real time is crucial for\ngiving a clear picture of the explosion mechanism. Since the neutrinos are\nexpected to come earlier than light, a fast broadcasting of the detection may\ngive astronomers a chance to make electromagnetic radiation observations of the\nexplosions right at the onset. The role of the monitor includes a fast\nannouncement of the neutrino burst detection to the world and a determination\nof the supernova direction. We present the online neutrino burst detection\nsystem and studies of the direction determination accuracy based on simulations\nat SK.\n", "  Helioseismology revealed an increase in the rotation rate with depth just\nbeneath the solar surface. The relative magnitude of the radial shear is almost\nconstant with latitude. This rotational state can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of two conditions characteristic of the near-surface convection:\nthe smallness of convective turnover time in comparison with the rotation\nperiod and absence of a horizontal preferred direction of convection\nanisotropy. The latter condition is violated in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. This raises the question of whether the subphotospheric fields can be\nprobed with measurements of near-surface rotational shear. The shear is shown\nto be weakly sensitive to magnetic fields but can serve as a probe for\nsufficiently strong fields of the order of one kilogauss. It is suggested that\nthe radial differential rotation in extended convective envelopes of red giants\nis of the same origin as the near-surface rotational shear of the Sun.\n", "  Coherent scattering of light from ultracold atoms involves an exchange of\nenergy and momentum introducing a wealth of non-linear dynamical phenomena. As\na prominent example particles can spontaneously form stationary periodic\nconfigurations which simultaneously maximize the light scattering and minimize\nthe atomic potential energy in the emerging optical lattice. Such self-ordering\neffects resulting in periodic lattices via bimodal symmetry breaking have been\nexperimentally observed with cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\ninside an optical resonator. Here we study a new regime of periodic pattern\nformation for an atomic BEC in free space, driven by far off-resonant\ncounterpropagating and non-interfering lasers of orthogonal polarization. In\ncontrast to previous works, no spatial light modes are preselected by any\nboundary conditions and the transition from homogeneous to periodic order\namounts to a crystallization of both light and ultracold atoms breaking a\ncontinuous translational symmetry. In the crystallized state the BEC acquires a\nphase similar to a supersolid with an emergent intrinsic length scale whereas\nthe light-field forms an optical lattice allowing phononic excitations via\ncollective back scattering, which are gapped due to the infinte-range\ninteractions. The studied system constitutes a novel configuration allowing the\nsimulation of synthetic solid state systems with ultracold atoms including\nlong-range phonon dynamics.\n", "  The Brownian force model (BFM) is a mean-field model for the local velocities\nduring avalanches in elastic interfaces of internal space dimension $d$, driven\nin a random medium. It is exactly solvable via a non-linear differential\nequation. We study avalanches following a kick, i.e. a step in the driving\nforce. We first recall the calculation of the distributions of the global size\n(total swept area) and of the local jump size for an arbitrary kick amplitude.\nWe extend this calculation to the joint density of local and global sizes\nwithin a single avalanche, in the limit of an infinitesimal kick. When the\ninterface is driven by a single point we find new exponents $\\tau_0=5/3$ and\n$\\tau=7/4$, depending on whether the force or the displacement is imposed. We\nshow that the extension of a single avalanche along one internal direction\n(i.e. the total length in $d=1$) is finite and we calculate its distribution,\nfollowing either a local or a global kick. In all cases it exhibits a\ndivergence $P(\\ell) \\sim \\ell^{-3}$ at small $\\ell$. Most of our results are\ntested in a numerical simulation in dimension $d=1$.\n", "  In this paper, we study non-local $F(R)$-mimetic gravity. We implement\nmimetic gravity in the framework of non-local $F(R)$-theories of gravity. Given\nsome specific class of models and using a potential on the mimetic field, we\ninvestigate some scenarios related to the early-time universe, namely the\ninflation and the cosmological bounce, compatibly with Einstein's gravity with\ncold dark matter at the late-time.\n", "  We apply the Bayesian framework to assess the presence of a correlation\nbetween two quantities. To do so, we estimate the probability distribution of\nthe parameter of interest, $\\rho$, characterizing the strength of the\ncorrelation. We provide an implementation of these ideas and concepts using\npython programming language and the pyMC module in a very short ($\\sim$130\nlines of code, heavily commented) and user-friendly program.\n  We used this tool to assess the presence and properties of the correlation\nbetween planetary surface gravity and stellar activity level as measured by the\nlog($R'_{\\mathrm{HK}}$) indicator. The results of the Bayesian analysis are\nqualitatively similar to those obtained via p-value analysis, and support the\npresence of a correlation in the data. The results are more robust in their\nderivation and more informative, revealing interesting features such as\nasymmetric posterior distributions or markedly different credible intervals,\nand allowing for a deeper exploration.\n  We encourage the reader interested in this kind of problem to apply our code\nto his/her own scientific problems. The full understanding of what the Bayesian\nframework is can only be gained through the insight that comes by handling\npriors, assessing the convergence of Monte Carlo runs, and a multitude of other\npractical problems. We hope to contribute so that Bayesian analysis becomes a\ntool in the toolkit of researchers, and they understand by experience its\nadvantages and limitations.\n", "  We review the design, theory, and applications of two dimensional periodic\nlattices hosting conical intersections in their energy-momentum spectrum. The\nbest known example is the Dirac cone, where propagation is governed by an\neffective Dirac equation, with electron spin replaced by a \"fermionic\"\nhalf-integer pseudospin. However, in many systems such as metamaterials, modal\nsymmetries result in the formation of higher order conical intersections with\ninteger or \"bosonic\" pseudospin. The ability to engineer lattices with these\nqualitatively different singular dispersion relations opens up many\napplications, including superior slab lasers, generation of orbital angular\nmomentum, zero-index metamaterials, and quantum simulation of exotic phases of\nrelativistic matter.\n", "  Coalescing binary black holes are among the primary science targets for\nsecond generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Reliable GW\nmodels are central to detection of such systems and subsequent parameter\nestimation. This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of\nrecent waveform models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing a\nnew set of $84$ high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. Our analysis\ncovers comparable mass binaries ($1\\le m_1/m_2\\le 3$), and samples\nindependently both black hole spins up to dimensionless spin-magnitude of $0.9$\nfor equal-mass binaries and $0.85$ for unequal mass binaries. Furthermore, we\nfocus on the high-mass regime (total mass $\\gtrsim 50M_\\odot$). The two most\nrecent waveform models considered (PhenomD and SEOBNRv2) both perform very well\nfor signal detection, losing less than 0.5\\% of the recoverable signal-to-noise\nratio $\\rho$, except that SEOBNRv2's efficiency drops mildly for both black\nhole spins aligned with large magnitude. For parameter estimation, modeling\ninaccuracies of SEOBNRv2 are found to be smaller than systematic uncertainties\nfor moderately strong GW events up to roughly $\\rho\\lesssim 15$. PhenomD's\nmodeling errors are found to be smaller than SEOBNRv2's, and are generally\nirrelevant for $\\rho\\lesssim 20$. Both models' accuracy deteriorates with\nincreased mass-ratio, and when at least one black hole spin is large and\naligned. The SEOBNRv2 model shows a pronounced disagreement with the numerical\nrelativity simulation in the merger phase, for unequal masses and\nsimultaneously both black hole spins very large and aligned. Two older waveform\nmodels (PhenomC and SEOBNRv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than the\nmore recent PhenomD and SEOBNRv2 models. Finally, we quantify the bias expected\nfrom all GW models during parameter estimation for recovery of binary's masses\nand spins.\n", "  Ward-Green-Takahashi (WGT) identities play a crucial role in hadron physics,\ne.g. imposing stringent relationships between the kernels of the one- and\ntwo-body problems, which must be preserved in any veracious treatment of mesons\nas bound-states. In this connection, one may view the dressed gluon-quark\nvertex, $\\Gamma_\\mu^a$, as fundamental. We use a novel representation of\n$\\Gamma_\\mu^a$, in terms of the gluon-quark scattering matrix, to develop a\nmethod capable of elucidating the unique quark-antiquark Bethe-Salpeter kernel,\n$K$, that is symmetry-consistent with a given quark gap equation. A strength of\nthe scheme is its ability to expose and capitalise on graphic symmetries within\nthe kernels. This is displayed in an analysis that reveals the origin of\n$H$-diagrams in $K$, which are two-particle-irreducible contributions,\ngenerated as two-loop diagrams involving the three-gluon vertex, that cannot be\nabsorbed as a dressing of $\\Gamma_\\mu^a$ in a Bethe-Salpeter kernel nor\nexpressed as a member of the class of crossed-box diagrams. Thus, there are no\ngeneral circumstances under which the WGT identities essential for a valid\ndescription of mesons can be preserved by a Bethe-Salpeter kernel obtained\nsimply by dressing both gluon-quark vertices in a ladder-like truncation; and,\nmoreover, adding any number of similarly-dressed crossed-box diagrams cannot\nimprove the situation.\n", "  Contrary to the original expectation, Na$_2$IrO$_3$ is not a Kitaev's quantum\nspin liquid (QSL) but shows a zig-zag-type antiferromagnetic order in\nexperiments. Here we propose experimental clues and criteria to measure how a\nmaterial in hand is close to the Kitaev's QSL state. For this purpose, we\nsystematically study thermal and spin excitations of a generalized\nKitaev-Heisenberg model studied by Chaloupka $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n110, 097204 (2013) and an effective ab initio Hamiltonian for Na$_2$IrO$_3$\nproposed by Yamaji $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 107201 (2014), by\nemploying a numerical diagonalization method. We reveal that closeness to the\nKitaev's QSL is characterized by the following properties, besides trivial\ncriteria such as reduction of magnetic ordered moments and Neel temperatures:\n(1) Two peaks in the temperature dependence of specific heat at $T_{\\ell}$ and\n$T_h$ caused by the fractionalization of spin to two types of Majorana\nfermions. (2) In between the double peak, prominent plateau or shoulder pinned\nat $(R/2)\\ln 2$ in the temperature dependence of entropy, where $R$ is the gas\nconstant. (3) Failure of the linear spin wave approximation at the low-lying\nexcitations of dynamical structure factors. (4) Small ratio $T_{\\ell}/T_h$\nclose to or less than 0.03. According to the proposed criteria, Na$_2$IrO$_3$\nis categorized to a compound close to the Kitaev's QSL, and is proven to be a\npromising candidate for the realization of the QSL if the relevant material\nparameters can further be tuned by making thin film of Na$_2$IrO$_3$ on various\nsubstrates or applying axial pressure perpendicular to the honeycomb networks\nof iridium ions. Applications of these characterization to\n(Na$_{1-x}$Li$_x$)$_2$IrO$_3$ and other related materials are also discussed.\n", "  We study the behavior of magnetic superconductors which involve a local\nattractive interaction between electrons, and a coupling between local moments\nand the electrons. We solve this `Hubbard-Kondo' model through a variational\nminimization at zero temperature and validate the results via a Monte Carlo\nbased on static auxiliary field decomposition of the Hubbard interaction. Over\na magnetic coupling window that widens with increasing attractive interaction\nthe ground state supports simultaneous magnetic and superconducting order. The\npairing amplitude remains s-wave like, without significant spatial modulation,\nwhile the magnetic phase evolves from a ferromagnet, through non-collinear\n`spiral' states, to a Neel state with increasing density and magnetic coupling.\nWe find that at intermediate magnetic coupling the\nantiferromagnetic-superconducting state is gapless, except for the regime of\nNeel order. We map out the phase diagram in terms of density, magnetic coupling\nand attractive interaction, establish the electron dispersion and effective\n`Fermi surface' in the ground state, provide an estimate of the magnetic and\nsuperconducting temperature scales via Monte Carlo, and compare our results to\navailable data on the borocarbides.\n", "  Results are presented for the occupation probabilities and current densities\nof bulk and edge states of half-filled graphene in a cylindrical geometry, and\nirradiated by a circularly polarized laser. It is assumed that the system is\nclosed, and that the laser has been switched on as a quench. Laser parameters\ncorresponding to some representative topological phases are studied: one where\nthe Chern number of the Floquet bands equals the number of chiral edge modes, a\nsecond where anomalous edge states appear in the Floquet Brillouin zone\nboundaries, and a third where the Chern number is zero, yet topological edge\nstates appear at the center and boundaries of the Floquet Brillouin zone.\nQualitative differences are found for the high frequency off-resonant and low\nfrequency on-resonant laser with edge states arising due to resonant processes\noccupied with a high effective temperature on the one hand, while edge states\narising due to off-resonant processes occupied with a low effective temperature\non the other. For an ideal half-filled system where only one of the bands in\nthe Floquet Brillouin zone is occupied and the other empty, particle-hole and\ninversion symmetry of the Floquet Hamiltonian implies zero current density.\nHowever the laser switch-on protocol breaks the inversion symmetry, resulting\nin a net cylindrical sheet of current density at steady-state. Due to the\nunderlying chirality of the system, this current density profile is associated\nwith a net charge imbalance between the top and bottom of the cylinders.\n", "  The two-fluid model is a phenomenological description of the gradual change\nof the itinerant and local characters of the f-electrons with temperature and\nother tuning parameters and has been quite successful in explaining many\nunusual and puzzling experimental observations in heavy electron materials. We\nreview some of these results and discuss possible implications of the two-fluid\nmodel in understanding the microscopic origin of heavy electron physics.\n", "  Cyclic Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) and adiabatic noncyclic geometric (ANG)\neffects are investigated in a single electron orbital system connected to two\nmetal contacts with externally driven chemical potential and/or\ntemperatures.The PB contribution does not affect the density matrix evolution,\nbut has quantitative effect on the statistics (fluctuations) of electron\ntransfer. The ANG contribution, on the other hand, affects the net flux across\nthe junction. Unlike the PB, the ANG contribution is non-zero when two\nparameters are identically driven. Closed analytical expressions are derived\nfor the ANG contribution to the flux, and the PB contribution to the first two\nleading order fluctuations. Fluctuations can be modified by manipulating the\nrelative phases of the drivings. Interestingly, we find that the fluctuations\nof the pumped charge do not satisfy the steady state fluctuation theorem in\npresence of nonzero geometric contribution, but can be recovered for a\nvanishing geometric contribution even in presence of the external driving.\n", "  Topologically ordered phase has emerged as one of most exciting concepts that\nnot only broadens our understanding of phases of matter, but also has been\nfound to have potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The\ndirect measurement of topological properties, however, is still a challenge\nespecially in interacting quantum system. Here we realize one-dimensional\nHeisenberg spin chains using nuclear magnetic resonance simulators and observe\nthe interaction-induced topological transitions, where Berry curvature in the\nparameter space of Hamiltonian is probed by means of dynamical response and\nthen the first Chern number is extracted by integrating the curvature over the\nclosed surface. The utilized experimental method provides a powerful means to\nexplore topological phenomena in quantum systems with many-body interactions.\n", "  In the present-day cosmic ray data, the strongest indication of anisotropy of\nthe ultrahigh energy cosmic rays is the 20-degree hotspot observed by the\nTelescope Array with the statistical significance of 3.4\\sigma. In this work,\nwe study the possibility of detecting such a spot by space-based all-sky\nobservatories. We show that if the detected luminosity of the hotspot is\nattributed to a physical effect and not a statistical fluctuation, the KLYPVE\nand JEM-EUSO experiments would need to collect ~300 events with E>57 EeV in\norder to detect the hotspot at the 5\\sigma\\ confidence level with the 68%\nprobability. We also study the dependence of the detection prospects on the\nhotspot luminosity.\n", "  We demonstrate that the melting points and other thermodynamic quantities of\nthe alkali metals can be calculated based on static crystalline properties. To\ndo this we derive analytic interatomic potentials for the alkali metals fitted\nprecisely to cohesive and vacancy energies, elastic moduli, lattice parameter\nand crystal stability. These potentials are then used to calculate melting\npoints by simulating the equilibration of solid and liquid samples in thermal\ncontact at ambient pressure. With the exception of lithium, remarkably good\nagreement is found with experimental values. The instability of the bcc\nstructure in Li and Na at low temperatures is also reproduced, and, unusually,\nis not due to a soft T1N phonon mode. No forces or finite temperature\nproperties are included in the fit, so this demonstrates a surprisingly high\nlevel of intrinsic transferrability in the simple potentials. Currently, there\nare few potentials available for the alkali metals, so in, addition to\ndemonstrating trends in behaviour, we expect that the potentials will be of\nbroad general use.\n", "  Placing a nanomechanical object in the evanescent near-field of a high-$Q$\noptical microcavity gives access to strong gradient forces and\nquantum-noise-limited displacement readout, offering an attractive platform for\nprecision sensing technology and basic quantum optics research. Robustly\nimplementing this platform is challenging, however, as it requires separating\noptically smooth surfaces by $\\lesssim\\lambda/10$. Here we describe a\nfully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a\nhigh-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$\nmicrodisk cavity. Employing a novel vertical integration technique based on\nplanarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm\nwhile maintaining mechanical $Q\\times f>10^{12}$ Hz and intrinsic optical\n$Q\\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry\nresult in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by\nradio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100\nkHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency\n(displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\\surd$Hz. In conjunction with\nthe high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise,\nthe transducer operates particularly well as a sensor. Deploying it in a 4 K\ncryostat, we recently demonstrated a displacement imprecision 40 dB below that\nat the standard quantum limit (SQL) with an imprecision-back-action product\n$<5\\cdot\\hbar$. In this report we provide a comprehensive description of device\ndesign, fabrication, and characterization, with an emphasis on extending\nHeisenberg-limited readout to room temperature. Towards this end, we describe a\nroom temperature experiment in which a displacement imprecision 30 dB below\nthat at the SQL and an imprecision-back-action product $<75\\cdot\\hbar$ is\nachieved.\n", "  Lyman- and Werner-band absorption of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is detected\nin $\\sim$50% of low redshift ($z<1$) DLAs/sub-DLAs with $N$(H$_2$) >\n10$^{14.4}$ cm$^{-2}$. However the true origin(s) of the H$_2$ bearing gas\nremain elusive. Here we report a new detection of an H$_{2}$ absorber at $z=$\n0.4298 in the HST/COS spectra of quasar PKS 2128-123. The total $N$(HI) of\n10$^{19.50\\pm0.15}$ cm$^{-2}$ classifies the absorber as a sub-DLA. H$_{2}$\nabsorption is detected up to the $J=3$ rotational level with a total $\\log\nN$(H$_{2}$) = 16.36$\\pm$0.08 corresponding to a molecular fraction of log\n$f$(H$_{2}$) = $-$2.84$\\pm$0.17. The excitation temperature of $T_{ex}$ =\n206$\\pm$6K indicates the presence of cold gas. Using detailed ionization\nmodelling we obtain a near-solar metallicity (i.e., [O/H]= $-$0.26$\\pm$0.19)\nand a dust-to-gas ratio of $\\log \\kappa \\sim -0.45$ for the H$_{2}$ absorbing\ngas. The host-galaxy of the sub-DLA is detected at an impact parameter of $\\rho\n\\sim$ 48 kpc with an inclination angle of $i \\sim$ 48 degree and an azimuthal\nangle of $\\Phi \\sim$ 15 degree with respect to the QSO sightline. We show that\nco-rotating gas in an extended disk cannot explain the observed kinematics of\nMg II absorption. Moreover, the inferred high metallicity is not consistent\nwith the scenario of gas accretion. An outflow from the central region of the\nhost-galaxy, on the other hand, would require a large opening angle (i.e.,\n2$\\theta>$150 degree), much larger than the observed outflow opening angles in\nSeyfert galaxies, in order to intercept the QSO sightline. We thus favor a\nscenario in which the H$_2$ bearing gas is stemming from a dwarf-satellite\ngalaxy, presumably via tidal and/or ram-pressure stripping. Detection of a\ndwarf galaxy candidate in the HST/WFPC2 image at an impact parameter of\n$\\sim$12 kpc reinforces such an idea.\n", "  We provide a simple discussion of our results on the backreaction effects of\ndensity inhomogeneities in cosmology, without mentioning one-parameter families\nor weak limits. Emphasis is placed on the manner in which \"averaging\" is done\nand the fact that one is solving Einstein's equation. The key assumptions and\nresults that we rigorously derived within our original mathematical framework\nare thereby explained in a heuristic way.\n", "  We describe the electroproduction ratios of baryon-meson states from nucleon,\ninferring from the sea quarks in the nucleon using an extension of the quark\nmodel that takes into account the sea. As a result we provide, with no\nadjustable parameters, the predictions of ratios of exclusive meson-baryon\nfinal states:$\\Lambda K^+$, $\\Sigma ^{*}K$, $\\Sigma K$, $p\\pi^0$, and $n\\pi^+$.\nThese predictions are in agreement with the new Jlab experimental data showing\nthat sea quarks play an important role in the electroproduction. We also\npredicted further ratios of exclusive reactions that can be measured and tested\nin future experiments. In particular, we suggested new experiments on deuterium\nand tritium. Such measurements can provide crucial test of different\npredictions concerning the structure of nucleon and its sea quarks helping to\nsolve an outstanding problem. Finally, we computed the so called strangeness\nsuppression factor, $\\lambda_s$, that is the suppression of strange\nquark-antiquarks compared to nonstrange pairs, and we found that our finding\nwith this simple extension of the quark model is in good agreement with the\nresults of Jlab and CERN experiments.\n", "  The exchange-correlation potential experienced by an electron in the free\nspace adjacent to a solid surface or to a low-dimensional system defines the\nfundamental image states and is generally important in surface- and\nnano-science. Here we determine the potential near the two- and one-dimensional\nelectron gases (EG), doing this analytically at the level of the exact exchange\nof the density-functional theory (DFT). We find that, at $r_\\perp\\gg k_F^{-1}$,\nwhere $r_\\perp$ is the distance from the EG and $k_F$ is the Fermi radius, the\npotential obeys the already known asymptotic $-e^2/r_\\perp$, while at $r_\\perp\n\\lesssim k_F^{-1}$, but {\\em still in vacuum}, qualitative and quantitative\ndeviations of the exchange potential from the asymptotic law occur. The\nplayground of the excitations to the low-lying image states falls into the\nlatter regime, causing significant departure from the Rydberg series. In\ngeneral, our analytical exchange potentials establish benchmarks for numerical\napproaches in the low-dimensional science, where DFT is by far the most common\ntool.\n", "  We demonstrate, for the first time, the realization of an entirely\nguided-wave squeezing experiment at a telecom wavelength. The state generation\nrelies on waveguide non-linear optics technology while squeezing collection and\ntransmission are implemented by using only telecom fibre components. We observe\nup to $-1.83\\pm0.05$ dB of squeezing emitted at 1542 nm in CW pumping regime.\nThe compactness and stability of the experiment, compared to free-space\nconfigurations, represent a significant step towards achieving out-of-the-lab\nCV quantum communication, fully compatible with existing telecom fibre\nnetworks. We believe that this work stands as a promising approach for real\napplications as well as for \"do-it-yourself\" experiments\n", "  We report the results of detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the performance\nexpected both at balloon altitudes and at the probable satellite orbit of a\nhard X-ray coded-aperture camera being developed for the MIRAX mission. Based\non a thorough mass model of the instrument and detailed specifications of the\nspectra and angular dependence of the various relevant radiation fields at both\nthe stratospheric and orbital environments, we have used the well-known package\nGEANT4 to simulate the instrumental background of the camera. We also show\nsimulated images of source fields to be observed and calculated the detailed\nsensitivity of the instrument in both situations. The results reported here are\nespecially important to researchers in this field considering that we provide\nimportant information, not easily found in the literature, on how to prepare\ninput files and calculate crucial instrumental parameters to perform GEANT4\nsimulations for high-energy astrophysics space experiments.\n", "  The role played by gravity in the transfer of interstellar matter from\nmolecular cloud scales to protostellar scales is still highly debated. Only\ndetailed studies on the kinematics of large samples of star-forming clouds will\nsettle the issue. We present new IRAM 30m observations of a sample of 27\ninfrared dark clouds covering a large range of sizes, masses, and aspect\nratios. Preliminary results suggest that gravity is regulating the dynamical\nevolution of these clouds on a couple of parsec scales.\n", "  We present predictions from the string melting version of a multi-phase\ntransport model on various observables in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt\n{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We use the same version of the model as an earlier study\nthat reasonably reproduced dN/dy, $p_{\\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic flow of\ncharged pions and kaons at low-$p_{\\rm T}$ for central and semi-central heavy\nion collisions at 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV. While we compare with the\nalready-available centrality dependence data on charged particle $dN/d\\eta$ at\nmid-pseudorapidity in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, we make predictions on\nidentified particle dN/dy, $p_{\\rm T}$-spectra, azimuthal anisotropies $v_n\n(n=2,3,4)$, and factorization ratios $r_{n}(\\eta^{a},\\eta^{b}) (n=2,3)$ for\nlongitudinal correlations.\n", "  We have determined the nematic-isotropic transition temperature as a function\nof applied magnetic field in three different thermotropic liquid crystalline\ndimers. These molecules are comprised of two rigid calamitic moieties joined\nend to end by flexible spacers with odd numbers of methylene groups. They show\nan unprecedented magnetic field enhancement of nematic order in that the\ntransition temperature is increased by up to 15K when subjected to 22T magnetic\nfield. The increase is conjectured to be caused by a magnetic field-induced\ndecrease of the average bend angle in the aliphatic spacers connecting the\nrigid mesogenic units of the dimers.\n", "  We discuss the possible connection between superconductivity (SC) and quantum\ncritical points (QCP) for any QCP that is tunable by isotopic mass\nsubstitution. We find a distinct contribution to the isotope exponent, due to\nthe proximity to a QCP, which can be used as an experimental signature for the\nrelation between SC and QCP. The relation is demonstrated in a scenario where\nthe SC pairing is due to modes related to a structural instability. Within this\nmodel the isotope exponent is derived in terms of microscopic parameters.\n", "  We present an expression for the QCD amplitude for a general hard scattering\nprocess with any number of soft gluon emissions, to one-loop accuracy. The\namplitude is written in two different but equivalent ways: as a product of\noperators ordered in dipole transverse momentum and as a product of\nloop-expanded currents. We hope that these results will help in the development\nof an all-orders algorithm for multiple emissions that includes the full colour\nstructure and both the real and imaginary contributions to the amplitude.\n", "  We consider the transformation properties of fermions under the discrete\nsymmetries CPT, CP, and C in the presence of B-L violation. We thus generalize\nthe analysis of the known properties of Majorana neutrinos, probed via\nneutrinoless double beta decay, to include the case of Dirac fermions with B-L\nviolation, which can be probed via neutron-antineutron oscillations. We show\nthat the resulting CPT phase has implications for the interplay of\nneutron-antineutron oscillations with external fields and sources and consider\nthe differences in the Majorana dynamics of neutrinos and neutrons in the\ncontext of theories with self-conjugate isospin I=0 and I=1/2 fields.\n", "  New operation mode, \"separated flow mode\", has been developed for in-flight\nproton decay experiments with the SHARAQ spectrometer. In the separated flow\nmode, the protons and the heavy-ion products are separated and measured in\ncoincidence at two different focal planes of SHARAQ. The ion-optical properties\nof the new mode were studied by using a proton beam at $246~{\\rm MeV}$, and the\nmomentum vector was properly reconstructed from the parameters measured in the\nfocal plane of SHARAQ. In the experiment with the $({}^{16}{\\rm O},{}^{16}{\\rm\nF})$ reaction at a beam energy of $247~{\\rm MeV/u}$, the outgoing ${}^{15}{\\rm\nO}+p$ produced by the decay of ${}^{16}{\\rm F}$ were measured in coincidence\nwith SHARAQ. High energy resolutions of $100~{\\rm keV}$ (FWHM) and $\\sim 2~{\\rm\nMeV}$ were achieved for the relative energy of $535~{\\rm keV}$, and the\n${}^{16}{\\rm F}$ energy of $3940~{\\rm MeV}$, respectively.\n", "  Kinetic particle-in-cell simulations are used to identify signatures of the\nelectron diffusion region (EDR) and its surroundings during asymmetric magnetic\nreconnection. A \"shoulder\" in the sunward pointing normal electric field (EN >\n0) at the reconnection magnetic field reversal is a good indicator of the EDR,\nand is caused by magnetosheath electron meandering orbits in the vicinity of\nthe x-line. Earthward of the X-line, electrons accelerated by EN form strong\ncurrents and crescent-shaped distribution functions in the plane perpendicular\nto B. Just downstream of the X-line, parallel electric fields create\nfield-aligned crescent electron distribution functions. In the immediate\nupstream magnetosheath, magnetic field strength, plasma density, and\nperpendicular electron temperatures are lower than the asymptotic state. In the\nmagnetosphere inflow region, magnetosheath ions intrude resulting in an\nEarthward pointing electric field and parallel heating of magnetospheric\nparticles. Many of the above properties persist with a guide field of at least\nunity.\n", "  We study models in which the 750 GeV diphoton excess is due to a scalar\ndecaying to two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons that subsequently decay into two\npairs of highly boosted photons, misidentified as individual photons.\nPerforming a model independent analysis we find that, with axion mass around\n$200$ MeV, this class of theories can naturally explain the observed signal\nwith a large width, without violating monojet constraints. At the same time the\nrequirement of a prompt axion decay can be satisfied only with a relatively\nlarge axion-photon coupling, leading to many new charged particles at the TeV\nscale. However, the required multiplicities of such fields is still moderately\nreduced relative to models with direct diphoton production.\n", "  The polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides a plethora\nof information about the early universe. Most notably, gravitational waves from\nthe Inflationary epoch (the leading explanation of the origin of the universe)\ncreate a unique CMB polarization $B$-mode signal. An unambiguous detection of\nthe inflationary $B$-mode signal would be a window into the physics of the\nuniverse as it was $10^{-36}$ seconds after the Big Bang, at energy scales many\norders of magnitude larger than what the LHC can produce. However, there are\nseveral instrumental and astrophysical sources that can obfuscate the\ninflationary $B$-mode signal. One of the most difficult parameters to calibrate\nfor CMB telescopes is the absolute orientation of the antenna's polarization\nsensitive axis. A miscalibration of the polarization orientation rotates the\nmuch brighter $E$-mode signal, producing a false $B$-mode signal. The current\nbest uncertainty on polarization orientation in the CMB community is\n$0.5^\\circ$, set from extrapolating IRAM measurements of the Crab Nebula\nsupernova remnant at 90 GHz to 150 GHz, where the CMB signals peak. This\naccuracy is not sufficient to convincingly detect $B$-modes predicted by\ncurrently allowable models of Inflation. We suggest to precisely measure the\nCrab Nebula's polarization, which can be calibrated absolutely to $0.1^\\circ$\nfrom measurements of the polarized emission of Mars, and use these data to\ncalibrate current and upcoming CMB experiments. In addition to inflationary\n$B$-modes, more precise calibration will allow us to better constrain the sum\nof the neutrino masses and set limits on exotic physics such as parity\nviolation through cosmic polarization rotation.\n", "  The detectability lemma is a useful tool for probing the structure of gapped\nground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians of lattice spin models. The\nlemma provides an estimate on the error incurred by approximating the ground\nspace projector with a product of local projectors. We provide a new, simpler\nproof for the detectability lemma, which applies to an arbitrary ordering of\nthe local projectors, and show that it is tight up to a constant factor. As an\napplication we show how the lemma can be combined with a strong converse by Gao\nto obtain local spectral gap amplification: we show that by coarse-graining a\nlocal frustration-free Hamiltonian with a spectral gap $\\gamma>0$ to a length\nscale $O(\\gamma^{-1/2})$, one gets an Hamiltonian with an $\\Omega(1)$ spectral\ngap.\n", "  We present an analytic description of numerical results for the ghost\npropagator G(p^2) in minimal Landau gauge on the lattice. The data were\nproduced in the SU(2) case using the largest lattice volumes to date, for d =\n2, 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. Our proposed form for G(p^2) is derived from\nthe one-loop relation between ghost and gluon propagators, considering a\ntree-level ghost-gluon vertex and our previously obtained gluon-propagator\nresults \\cite{Cucchieri:2011ig}. Although this one-loop expression is not a\ngood description of the data, it leads to a one-parameter fit of our\nghost-propagator data with a generally good value of \\chi^2/dof, comparable to\nother fitting forms used in the literature. At the same time, we present a\nsimple parametrization of the difference between the lattice data and the\none-loop predictions.\n", "  We study the influence of reflective boundaries on time-dependent responses\nof one-dimensional quantum fluids at zero temperature beyond the low-energy\napproximation. Our analysis is based on an extension of effective mobile\nimpurity models for nonlinear Luttinger liquids to the case of open boundary\nconditions. For integrable models, we show that boundary autocorrelations\noscillate as a function of time with the same frequency as the corresponding\nbulk autocorrelations. This frequency can be identified as the band edge of\nelementary excitations. The amplitude of the oscillations decays as a power law\nwith distinct exponents at the boundary and in the bulk, but boundary and bulk\nexponents are determined by the same coupling constant in the mobile impurity\nmodel. For nonintegrable models, we argue that the power-law decay of the\noscillations is generic for autocorrelations in the bulk, but turns into an\nexponential decay at the boundary. Moreover, there is in general a nonuniversal\nshift of the boundary frequency in comparison with the band edge of bulk\nexcitations. The predictions of our effective field theory are compared with\nnumerical results obtained by time-dependent density matrix renormalization\ngroup (tDMRG) for both integrable and nonintegrable critical spin-$S$ chains\nwith $S=1/2$, $1$ and $3/2$.\n", "  Anion substitution with bismuth (Bi) in III-V semiconductors is an effective\nmethod for experimental engineering of the band gap Eg at low Bi\nconcentrations, in particular in gallium arsenide (GaAs). The inverse\nBi-concentration dependence of Eg has been found to be linear at low\nconcentrations x and dominated by a valence band-defect level anticrossing\nbetween As and Bi occupied p levels. This dependence breaks down at high\nconcentrations where empirical models accounting only for the As-Bi interaction\nare not applicable. Predictive models for the valence band hybridization\nrequire a first-principle understanding which can be obtained by density\nfunctional theory with the main challenges being the proper description of Eg\nand the spin-orbit coupling. By using an efficient method to include these\neffects, it is shown here that at high concentrations Eg is modified mainly by\na Bi-Bi p orbital interaction and by the large Bi atom-induced strain. This\npoints to the role of different atomic configurations obtained by varying the\nexperimental growth conditions in engineering arsenide band gaps, in particular\nfor telecommunication laser technology.\n", "  Current-generation low frequency interferometers constructed with the\nobjective of detecting the high-redshift 21 cm background, aim to generate\npower spectra of the brightness-temperature contrast of neutral hydrogen in\nprimordial intergalactic medium. Two-dimensional power spectra (power in\nFourier modes parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight) formed from\ninterferometric visibilities have been shown to delineate a boundary between\nspectrally-smooth foregrounds (known as the wedge) and spectrally-structured 21\ncm background emission (the EoR-window). However, polarized foregrounds are\nknown to possess spectral structure due to Faraday rotation, which can leak\ninto the EoR window. In this work, we create and analyze 2D power spectra from\nthe PAPER-32 imaging array in Stokes I, Q, U and V. These allow us to observe\nand diagnose systematic effects in our calibration at high signal-to-noise\nwithin the Fourier space most relevant to EoR experiments. We observe\nwell-defined windows in the Stokes visibilities, with Stokes Q, U and V power\nspectra sharing a similar wedge shape to that seen in Stokes I. With modest\npolarization calibration, we see no evidence that polarization calibration\nerrors move power outside the wedge in any Stokes visibility, to the noise\nlevels attained. Deeper integrations will be required to confirm that this\nbehavior persists to the depth required for EoR detection.\n", "  In this paper we consider the four dimensional N=2 supergravity theory\narising from the compactification of type IIA string theory on a Calabi-Yau\nmanifold. We analyse the supersymmetric flow equations for static, spherically\nsymmetric, single-centered black holes. These flow equations are solved by a\nset of algebraic equations involving the holomorphic sections and harmonic\nfunctions. We examine black hole configurations with D0-D4-D6 charge for which\nthe most general solution of these algebraic equations are considered. Though\nthe black hole solution is unique for a given value of the charges, we find new\nphases of the black hole solutions upon varying them.\n", "  During or towards the end of inflation, the Standard Model (SM) Higgs forms a\ncondensate with a large amplitude. Following inflation, the condensate\noscillates, decaying non-perturbatively into the rest of the SM species. The\nresulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics converts a fraction of the energy\navailable into gravitational waves (GW). We study this process using classical\nlattice simulations in an expanding box, following the energetically dominant\nelectroweak gauge bosons $W^\\pm$ and $Z$. We characterize the GW spectrum as a\nfunction of the running couplings, Higgs initial amplitude, and\npost-inflationary expansion rate. As long as the SM is decoupled from the\ninflationary sector, the generation of this background is universally expected,\nindependently of the nature of inflation. Our study demonstrates the efficiency\nof GW emission by gauge fields undergoing parametric resonance. The initial\nenergy of the Higgs condensate represents however, only a tiny fraction of the\ninflationary energy. Consequently, the resulting background is very suppressed,\nwith an amplitude $h^2 \\Omega_{\\rm GW}^{(o)} \\lesssim 10^{-29}$ today. The\namplitude can be boosted to $h^2 \\Omega_{\\rm GW}^{(o)} \\lesssim 10^{-16}$, if\nfollowing inflation the universe undergoes a kination-domination stage; however\nthe background is shifted in this case to high frequencies $f_p \\lesssim\n10^{11} {\\rm Hz}$. In all cases the signal is out of the range of current or\nplanned GW detectors. This background will therefore remain, most likely, as a\ncuriosity of the SM.\n", "  We present some cosmological models which unify the late and early-time\nacceleration eras with the radiation and the matter domination era, and we\nrealize the cosmological models by using the theoretical framework of $F(R)$\ngravity. Particularly, the first model unifies the late and early-time\nacceleration with the matter domination era, and the second model unifies all\nthe evolution eras of our Universe. The two models are described in the same\nway at early and late times, and only the intermediate stages of the evolution\nhave some differences. Each cosmological model contains two Type IV\nsingularities which are chosen to occur one at the end of the inflationary era\nand one at the end of the matter domination era. The cosmological models at\nearly times are approximately identical to the $R^2$ inflation model, so these\ndescribe a slow-roll inflationary era which ends when the slow-roll parameters\nbecome of order one. The inflationary era is followed by the radiation era and\nafter that the matter domination era follows, which lasts until the second Type\nIV singularity, and then the late-time acceleration era follows. The models\nproduce a nearly scale invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature\nperturbations and a scalar-to-tensor ratio which are compatible with the most\nrecent observational data and it seems that the deceleration acceleration\ntransition is crucially affected by the presence of the second Type IV\nsingularity which occurs at the end of the matter domination era. We perform an\nanalysis of the Hubble horizon evolution, and in addition, we investigate which\n$F(R)$ gravity can successfully realize each of the four cosmological epochs.\n", "  Some empirical parametrizations of the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1535)$ transition\namplitudes violates the Siegert's theorem, that relates the longitudinal and\nthe transverse amplitudes, in the pseudo-threshold limit (nucleon and resonance\nat rest). In the case of the electromagnetic transition from the nucleon (mass\n$M$) to the resonance $N(1525)$ (mass $M_R$), the Siegert's theorem is\nsometimes expressed by the relation $|{\\bf q}| A_{1/2}= \\lambda S_{1/2}$ in the\npseudo-threshold limit, when the photon momentum $|{\\bf q}|$ vanishes, and\n$\\lambda = \\sqrt{2} (M_R -M)$. In this article, we argue that the Siegert's\ntheorem should be expressed by the relation $A_{1/2} = \\lambda \\frac{S_{1/2}}{\n|{\\bf q}|}$, in the limit $|{\\bf q}| \\to 0$. This result is a consequence of\nthe relation $S_{1/2} \\propto |{\\bf q}|$, when $|{\\bf q}| \\to 0$, as suggested\nby the analysis of the transition form factors and by the orthogonality between\nthe nucleon and $N(1535)$ states. We propose then new empirical\nparametrizations for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1535)$ helicity amplitudes, that\nare consistent with the data and the Siegert's theorem. The proposed\nparametrization follow closely the MAID2007 parametrization, except for a small\ndeviation in the amplitudes $A_{1/2}$ and $S_{1/2}$ when $Q^2 < 1.5$ GeV$^2$.\n", "  Learning in neural networks poses peculiar challenges when using discretized\nrather then continuous synaptic states. The choice of discrete synapses is\nmotivated by biological reasoning and experiments, and possibly by hardware\nimplementation considerations as well. In this paper we extend a previous large\ndeviations analysis which unveiled the existence of peculiar dense regions in\nthe space of synaptic states which accounts for the possibility of learning\nefficiently in networks with binary synapses. We extend the analysis to\nsynapses with multiple states and generally more plausible biological features.\nThe results clearly indicate that the overall qualitative picture is unchanged\nwith respect to the binary case, and very robust to variation of the details of\nthe model. We also provide quantitative results which suggest that the\nadvantages of increasing the synaptic precision (i.e.~the number of internal\nsynaptic states) rapidly vanish after the first few bits, and therefore that,\nfor practical applications, only few bits may be needed for near-optimal\nperformance, consistently with recent biological findings. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how the theoretical analysis can be exploited to design efficient\nalgorithmic search strategies.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the properties of a weak link between two\nsuperconducting leads, which has the form of a non-superconducting nanowire\nwith a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling caused by an electric field. In the\nCoulomb blockade regime of single-electron tunneling, we find that such a weak\nlink acts as a \"spin splitter\" of the spin states of Cooper pairs tunneling\nthrough the link, to an extent that depends on the direction of the electric\nfield. We show that the Josephson current is sensitive to interference between\nthe resulting two transmission channels, one where the spins of both members of\na Cooper pair are preserved and one where they are both flipped. As a result,\nthe current is a periodic function of the strength of the spin-orbit\ninteraction and of the bending angle of the nanowire (when mechanically bent);\nan identical effect appears due to strain-induced spin-orbit coupling. In\ncontrast, no spin-orbit induced interference effect can influence the current\nthrough a single weak link connecting two normal metals.\n", "  We use holography to analyze the evolution of an ensemble of jets, with an\ninitial probability distribution for their energy and opening angle as in\nproton-proton (pp) collisions, as they propagate through an expanding cooling\ndroplet of strongly coupled plasma as in heavy ion collisions. We identify two\ncompeting effects: (i) each individual jet widens as it propagates; (ii) the\nopening angle distribution for jets emerging from the plasma within any\nspecified range of energies has been pushed toward smaller angles, comparing to\npp jets with the same energies. The second effect arises because small-angle\njets suffer less energy loss and because jets with a higher initial energy are\nless probable in the ensemble. We illustrate both effects in a simple\ntwo-parameter model, and find that their consequence in sum is that the opening\nangle distribution for jets in any range of energies contains fewer narrow and\nwide jets. Either effect can dominate in the mean opening angle, for not\nunreasonable values of the parameters. So, the mean opening angle for jets with\na given energy can easily shift toward smaller angles, as experimental data may\nindicate, even while every jet in the ensemble broadens.\n", "  Entanglement between different regions in momentum space is studied for\nground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in\na transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases,\nentanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an\nanisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In\nthe ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy\nbetween left- and right-moving modes which is independent on the external\nfield. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space.\nIn the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between\nenergy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size,\nwith a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth\nof the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size provides an\nexplanation for the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum\nspace.\n", "  A quantum flywheel is studied with the purpose of storing useful work in\nquantum levels, while additional power is extracted continuously from the\ndevice. The flywheel gains its energy form a quantum heat engine. Generally,\nwhen a work repository is quantized the work exchange with the engine is\naccompanied with heat exchange, which may degrade the charging efficiency. In\nthe particular realization of a quantum harmonic oscillator work repository,\nquantum and thermal fluctuations dominates the dynamics. Quantum monitoring and\nfeedback control are applied to the flywheel, as it is shown to be an essential\npart of stabilizing and regulating its state of operation, and bringing the\nsystem to a steady state. A particular balance between information gained by\nmeasuring the system and the information fed back to the system is found to\nmaximize the charging efficiency. The dynamics of the flywheel are described by\na stochastic master equation that accounts for the engine, the external\ndriving, the measurement, and the feedback operations.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has an instantaneous field of view\ncovering $\\sim 1/5$ of the sky and completes a survey of the full sky every ~3\nhours. It provides a continuous, all-sky survey of high-energy gamma-rays,\nenabling searches for transient phenomena over timescales from milliseconds to\nyears. Among these phenomena could be electromagnetic counterparts to\ngravitational wave sources. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the\nLAT observations relevant to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave\nObservatory (LIGO) event GW150904 (Abbott et al. 2016), which is the first\ndirect detection of gravitational waves and has been interpreted as due to\ncoalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The localization region for\nGW150904 was outside the LAT field of view at the time of the gravitational\nwave signal. However, as part of routine survey observations, the LAT observed\nthe entire LIGO localization region within ~70 minutes of the trigger, and thus\nenabled a comprehensive search for a gamma-ray counterpart to GW150904. The\nstudy of the LAT data presented here did not find any potential counterparts to\nGW150904, but it did provide limits on the presence of a transient counterpart\nabove 100 MeV on timescales of hours to days over the entire GW150904\nlocalization region.\n", "  Motivated by indirect observational evidence for strongly magnetized\naccretion discs around black holes, and the novel theoretical properties of\nsuch solutions, we investigate how a strong magnetization state can develop and\npersist. To this end, we perform local simulations of accretion discs with an\ninitially purely toroidal magnetic field of equipartition strength. We\ndemonstrate that discs with zero net vertical magnetic flux and realistic\nboundary conditions cannot sustain a strong toroidal field. However, a magnetic\npressure-dominated disc can form from an initial configuration with a\nsufficient amount of net vertical flux and realistic boundary conditions. Our\nresults suggest that poloidal flux is a necessary prerequisite for the\nsustainability of strongly magnetized accretion discs.\n", "  We show that the covariant analytic mechanics (CAM) is closely related to the\nDe Donder-Weyl (DW) theory. To treat space and time on an equal footing, the DW\ntheory introduces $D$ conjugate fields ($D$ is the dimension of space-time) for\neach field and the CAM regards the differential forms as the basic variables.\nThe generalization of the canonical equations is called the DW equations.\nAlthough one of the DW equations is not correct for the gauge field and the\ngravitational field, we show the way to improve it. By rewriting the canonical\nequations of the CAM, which are manifestly general coordinate covariant and\ngauge covariant, using the components of the tensors, we show that these are\nequivalent to the improved DW equations. Additionally, we investigate the Dirac\nfield. We present a modified Hamilton formalism which regards only the Dirac\nfields as the basic variables and show that it provides the Dirac equations\ncorrectly.\n", "  We theoretically study the quantum anomalies in the superconducting Weyl\nmetals based on the topological field theory. It is demonstrated that the Fermi\narc and the surface Andreev bound state, characteristic of the superconducting\nWeyl metals, are the manifestations of two underlying phenomenon, namely the\nchiral anomaly and the parity-like anomaly, respectively. The first anomaly is\ninherited from the Berry curvature around the original Weyl points, while the\nsecond is the result of the superconductivity. We show that, all the\nfascinating topological behavior of the superconducting Weyl metals, either\nintranode FFLO or the internode BCS pairing state, can be satisfactorily\ndescribed and predicted by our topological field theory.\n", "  We present the results of a search for z=9-10 galaxies within the first 8\npointings of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) (4 clusters plus 4 parallel\nfields) and 20 cluster fields from the CLASH survey. Combined with our previous\nanalysis of the Hubble Ultra-Deep field (HUDF), we have now completed a search\nfor z=9-10 galaxies over ~130 sq. arcmin, across 29 HST WFC3/IR pointings. As\nin our recent study of the first two HFF fields, we confine our primary search\nfor high-redshift candidates in the HFF imaging to the uniformly deep (i.e.\nsigma_160>30 AB mag in 0.5-arcsec diameter apertures), relatively low\nmagnification regions. In the CLASH fields our search was confined to uniformly\ndeep regions where sigma_160>28.8 AB mag. Our SED fitting analysis unveils a\nsample of 33 galaxy candidates at z_phot>=8.4, five of which have primary\nphotometric redshift solutions in the range 9.6<z_phot<11.2. By calculating a\nde-lensed effective volume for each candidate, the improved statistics and\nreduced cosmic variance provided by our new sample allows a more accurate\ndetermination of the UV-selected galaxy luminosity function (LF) at z~9. Our\nnew results strengthen our previous conclusion that the LF appears to evolve\nsmoothly from z=8 to z=9, an evolution which can be equally well modelled by a\nfactor of ~2 drop in density, or a dimming of ~0.5 mag in M*. Moreover, based\non our new sample, we are able to place initial constraints on the z=10 LF,\nfinding that the number density at M_1500 ~ -19.7 is log(phi) = -4.1\n(+0.2,-0.3), a factor of ~2 lower than at z=9. Finally, we use our new results\nto re-visit the issue of the decline in UV luminosity density at z>=8. We\nconclude that the data continue to support a smooth decline in rho_UV over the\nredshift interval 6<z<10, in agreement with simple models of early galaxy\nevolution driven by the growth in the underlying dark matter halo mass\nfunction.\n", "  We study the energy transport in a system of two half-infinite XXZ chains\ninitially kept separated at different temperatures, and later connected and let\nfree to evolve unitarily. By changing independently the parameters of the two\nhalves, we highlight, through bosonisation and time-dependent\nmatrix-product-state simulations, the different contributions of low-lying\nbosonic modes and of fermionic quasi-particles to the energy transport. In the\nsimulations we also observe that the energy current reaches a finite value\nwhich only slowly decays to zero. The general pictures that emerges is the\nfollowing. Since integrability is only locally broken in this model, a\npre-equilibration behaviour may appear. In particular, when the sound\nvelocities of the bosonic modes of the two halves match, the low-temperature\nenergy current is almost stationary and described by a formula with a\nnon-universal prefactor interpreted as a transmission coefficient.\nThermalisation, characterized by the absence of any energy flow, occurs only on\nlonger time-scales which are not accessible with our numerics.\n", "  Hadrons in lattice QCD are usually created employing smeared interpolators.\nWe introduce a new quark smearing that allows us to maintain small statistical\nerrors and good overlaps of hadronic wavefunctions with the respective ground\nstates, also at high spatial momenta. The method is successfully tested for the\npion and the nucleon at a pion mass $m_{\\pi}\\approx 295$ MeV and momenta as\nhigh as 2.8 GeV. We compare the results obtained to dispersion relations and\nsuggest further optimizations.\n", "  There is growing evidence of star formation in the vicinity of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. A viable scenario for this process\nassumes infall of a massive gas cloud towards the SMBH and subsequent formation\nof a dense accretion disc which gives birth to the young stars. Numerical\nhydrodynamical models indicate that this star formation process is rather fast\nand it precedes full circularization of the accretion flow, i.e. the new stars\nare born on elliptic orbits. By means of direct numerical N-body modeling, we\nshow in this paper that the non-zero eccentricity of the stellar discs around\nthe SMBH leads to an onset of various types of the Kozai-Lidov oscillations of\na non-negligible subset of individual orbits in the disc, showing a remarkable\nrobustness of this classical mechanism. Among others, we demonstrate that under\ncertain circumstances, presence of an additional spherical cluster (which is\ngenerally known to damp Kozai-Lidov oscillations) may trigger such oscillations\ndue to affecting the internal flow of the angular momentum through the disc. We\nconclude that the Kozai-Lidov oscillations are capable to substantially modify\nthe initial structure of the disc (its thickness and distribution of\neccentricities, in particular).\n", "  In recent work we proposed a novel theory of dark matter (DM) superfluidity\nthat matches the successes of the LambdaCDM model on cosmological scales while\nsimultaneously reproducing MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology on\ngalactic scales. The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are\nsuperfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we\npropose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM\nsuperfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the\nsuperfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve\ngradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the\ngravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is\nfully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron\nmechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large\nacceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein\ngravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the\naction reduces to MONDian gravity. Cosmologically, however, the universe is\nalways in the Einstein-gravity, symmetry-restoring phase. The expansion history\nand linear growth of density perturbations are therefore indistinguishable from\nLambdaCDM cosmology.\n", "  Recently Ru-Yin Chen et al. (Phys. Lett. A 379 (2015) 2169-2173) presented\nresults on the absolute negative mobility (ANM) in a one-dimensional overdamped\nsystem and claimed that a new minimal model of ANM was proposed. We suggest\nthat the authors introduced a mistake in their calculations. Then we perform a\nprecise numerical simulation of the corresponding Langevin equation to show\nthat the ANM phenomenon does not occur in the considered system.\n", "  SrRuO3 is a highly interesting material due to its anomalous-metal properties\nrelated with ferromagnetism and its relevance as conductive perovskite layer or\nsubstrate in heterostructure devices. We have used optical floating zone\ntechnique in an infrared image furnace to grow large single crystals of SrRuO3\nwith volumes attaining several hundred mm3. Crystals obtained for optimized\ngrowth parameters exhibit a high ferromagnetic Curie temperature of 165 K and a\nlow-temperature magnetization of 1.6 muB at a magnetic field of 6 T. The high\nquality of the crystals is further documented by large residual resistance\nratios of 75 and by crystal structure and chemical analyzes. With these\ncrystals the magnetic anisotropy could be determined.\n", "  Motivated by recent advances in Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) of\nastrophysical phenomena such as out of equilibrium jets, we perform a Direct\nNumerical Simulation (DNS) of the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI)\nunder the generalised quasilinear approximation (GQL). This approximation\ngeneralises the quasilinear approximation (QL) to include the self-consistent\ninteraction of large-scale modes, interpolating between fully nonlinear DNS and\nQL DNS whilst still remaining formally linear in the small scales. In this\npaper we address whether GQL can more accurately describe low-order statistics\nof axisymmetric HMRI when compared with QL by performing DNS under various\ndegrees of GQL approximation. We utilise various diagnostics, such as energy\nspectra in addition to first and second cumulants, for calculations performed\nfor a range of Reynolds and Hartmann numbers (describing rotation and imposed\nmagnetic field strength respectively). We find that GQL performs significantly\nbetter than QL in describing the statistics of the HMRI even when relatively\nfew large-scale modes are kept in the formalism. We conclude that DSS based on\nGQL (GCE2) will be significantly more accurate than that based on QL (CE2).\n", "  The topological property of SrRu$_2$O$_6$ and isostructural CaOs$_2$O$_6$\nunder various strain conditions is investigated using density functional\ntheory. Based on an analysis of parity eigenvalues, we anticipate that a\nthree-dimensional strong topological insulating state should be realized when\nband inversion is induced at the A point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone. For\nSrRu$_2$O$_6$, such a transition requires rather unrealistic tuning, where only\nthe $c$ axis is reduced while other structural parameters are unchanged.\nHowever, given the larger spin-orbit coupling and smaller lattice constants in\nCaOs$_2$O$_6$, the desired topological transition does occur under uniform\ncompressive strain. Our study paves a way to realize a topological insulating\nstate in a complex oxide, which has not been experimentally demonstrated so\nfar.\n", "  We report a study on the complete spin-wave spectrum inside a vortex state\nnano-disk. Transformation of this spectrum is continuously monitored as the\nnano-disk becomes gradually magnetized by a perpendicular magnetic field and\nencouters a second order phase transition to the uniformly magnetized state.\nThis reveals the bijective relationship that exists between the eigen-modes in\nthe vortex state with the ones in the saturated state. It is found that the\ngyrotropic mode can be continuously viewed as a uniform phase precession, which\nuniquely softens (its frequency vanishes) at the saturation field to transform\nabove into the Kittel mode. By contrast the other spin-wave modes remain finite\nas a function of the applied field while their character is altered by level\nanti-crossing.\n", "  Accurate modeling of physical and chemical processes in the interstellar\nmedium requires detailed knowledge of how atoms and molecule adsorb on dust\ngrains. However, the sticking coefficient, a number between 0 and 1 that\nmeasures the first step in the interaction of a particle with a surface, is\nusually assumed in simulations of ISM environments to be either 0.5 or 1. Here\nwe report on the determination of the sticking coefficient of H$_2$, D$_2$,\nN$_2$, O$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$ on non-porous amorphous solid water\n(np-ASW). The sticking coefficient was measured over a wide range of surface\ntemperatures using a highly collimated molecular beam. We showed that the\nstandard way of measuring the sticking coefficient --- the King-Wells method\n--- leads to the underestimation of trapping events in which there is\nincomplete energy accommodation of the molecule on the surface. Surface\nscattering experiments with the use of a pulsed molecular beam are used instead\nto measure the sticking coefficient. Based on the values of the measured\nsticking coefficient we suggest a useful general formula of the sticking\ncoefficient as a function of grain temperature and molecule-surface binding\nenergy. We use this formula in a simulation of ISM gas-grain chemistry to find\nthe effect of sticking on the abundance of key molecules both on grains and in\nthe gas-phase.\n", "  Motivated by recent results from the LHCb, BABAR and Belle collaborations on\nB\\to D^{(*)}\\ell^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell decays, which significantly deviate from the\nStandard Model and hint the possible new physics beyond the Standard Model, we\nprobe the R-parity violating supersymmetric effects in B^-_c\\to\n\\ell^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell and B\\to D^{(*)}\\ell^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell decays. We find that\n(i) \\mathcal{B}(B^-_c\\to e^- \\bar{\\nu}_e) and\n\\mathcal{B}(B^-_c\\to\\mu^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu) are sensitive to the constrained\nslepton exchange couplings; (ii) the normalized forward-backward asymmetries of\nB\\to De^-\\bar{\\nu}_{e} decays have been greatly affected by the constrained\nslepton exchange couplings, and their signs could be changed; (iii) all\nrelevant observables in the exclusive b\\to c\\tau^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\tau decays and the\nratios \\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)}) are sensitive to the slepton exchange coupling,\n\\mathcal{R}(D^*) could be enhanced by the constrained slepton exchange coupling\nto reach each 95\\% confidence level experimental range from BABAR, Belle and\nLHCb, but it could not reach the lower limit of the 95\\% confidence level\nexperimental average. Our results in this work could be used to probe R-parity\nviolating effects, and will correlate with searches for direct supersymmetric\nsignals at the running LHCb and the forthcoming Belle-II.\n", "  We develop a numerical method for solving the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. The basis of our work is a two-way splitting of the spin-1 evolution\nequation that leads to two exactly solvable flows. We use this to implement a\nsecond-order and a fourth-order symplectic integration method. These are the\nfirst fully symplectic methods for evolving spin-1 condensates. We develop two\nnon-trivial numerical tests to compare our methods against two other\napproaches.\n", "  The use of virtually lossless topologically isolated edge states may lead to\na novel class of thresholdless lasers operating without inversion. One needs\nhowever to understand if topological states may be coupled to external\nradiation and act as active cavities. We study a two-level topological\ninsulator and show that self-induced transparency pulses can directly excite\nedge states. We simulate laser emission by a suitable designed topological\ncavity, and show that it can emit tunable radiation. For a configuration of\nsites following the off-diagonal Aubry-Andre-Harper model we solve the\nMaxwell-Bloch equations in the time domain and provide a first principle\nconfirmation of topological lasers. Our results open the road to a new class of\nlight emitters with topological protection for applications ranging from\nlow-cost energetically-effective integrated lasers sources, also including\nsilicon photonics, to strong coupling devices for studying ultrafast quantum\nprocesses with engineered vacuum.\n", "  We present first-principles calculations of metallic atomic hydrogen in the\n400-600 GPa pressure range in a tetragonal structure with space group\n$I4_1/amd$, which is predicted to be its first atomic phase. Our calculations\nshow a band structure close to the free-electron-like limit due to the high\nelectronic kinetic energy induced by pressure. Bands are properly described\neven in the independent electron approximation fully neglecting the\nelectron-electron interaction. Linear-response harmonic calculations show a\ndynamically stable phonon spectrum with marked Kohn anomalies. Even if the\nelectron-electron interaction has a minor role in the electronic bands, the\ninclusion of electronic ex- change and correlation in the density response is\nessential to obtain a dynamically stable structure. Anharmonic effects, which\nare calculated within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approxima- tion,\nharden high-energy optical modes and soften transverse acoustic modes up to a\n20% in energy. Despite a large impact of anharmonicity has been predicted in\nseveral high-pressure hydrides, here the superconducting critical temperature\nis barely affected by anharmonicity, as it is lowered from its harmonic 318 K\nvalue only to 300 K at 500 GPa. We atribute the small impact of anharmoncity on\nsuperconductivity to the absence of softened optical modes and the fairly\nuniform distribution of the electron-phonon coupling among the vibrational\nmodes.\n", "  The recent detection of the gravitational wave source GW150914 by the LIGO\ncollaboration motivates a speculative source for the origin of ultrahigh energy\ncosmic rays as a possible byproduct of the immense energies achieved in black\nhole mergers, provided that the black holes have spin as seems inevitable and\nthere are relic magnetic fields and disk debris remaining from the formation of\nthe black holes or from their accretion history. We argue that given the modest\nefficiency $< 0.01$ required per event per unit of gravitational wave energy\nrelease, merging black holes potentially provide an environment for\naccelerating cosmic rays to ultrahigh energies.\n", "  We study the question of whether two frames of a given physical theory are\nequivalent or not in the presence of quantum corrections. By using field theory\narguments we claim that equivalence is broken in the presence of anomalous\nsymmetries in one of the frames. This is particularized to the case of the\nrelation between the Einstein and Jordan frames in scalar-tensor theories used\nto describe early Universe dynamics. Although in this case a regularization\nthat cancels the anomaly exists, the renormalized theory always develop a\nnon-vanishing contribution to the S-matrix that is present only in the Jordan\nframe, promoting the different frames to different physical theories that must\nbe UV completed in a different way.\n", "  Scalar particles coupled to the Standard Model fields through a disformal\ncoupling arise in different theories, such as massive gravity or brane-world\nmodels. We will review the main phenomenology associated with such particles.\nDistinctive disformal signatures could be measured at colliders and with\nastrophysical observations. The phenomenological relevance of the disformal\ncoupling demands the introduction of a set of symmetries, which may ensure the\nstability of these new degrees of freedom. In such a case, they constitute\nnatural dark matter candidates since they are generally massive and weakly\ncoupled. We will illustrate these ideas by paying particular attention to the\nbranon case, since these questions arise naturally in brane-world models with\nlow tension, where they were first discussed.\n", "  In a previous paper, we pointed out that the gamma-ray source 3FGL\nJ2212.5+0703 shows evidence of being spatially extended. If a gamma-ray source\nwithout detectable emission at other wavelengths were unambiguously determined\nto be spatially extended, it could not be explained by known astrophysics, and\nwould constitute a smoking gun for dark matter particles annihilating in a\nnearby subhalo. With this prospect in mind, we scrutinize the gamma-ray\nemission from this source, finding that it prefers a spatially extended profile\nover that of a single point-like source with 5.1 sigma statistical\nsignificance. We also use a large sample of active galactic nuclei and other\nknown gamma-rays sources as a control group, confirming, as expected, that\nstatistically significant extension is rare among such objects. We argue that\nthe most likely (non-dark matter) explanation for this apparent extension is a\npair of bright gamma-ray sources that serendipitously lie very close to each\nother, and estimate that there is a chance probability of ~2% that such a pair\nwould exist somewhere on the sky. In the case of 3FGL J2212.5+0703, a model\nwith a second gamma-ray point source at the location of a known BZCAT/CRATES\nradio source yields fits that are comparable in quality to those obtained for a\nsingle extended source. If 3FGL J2212.5+0703 is a dark matter subhalo, it would\nimply that dark matter particles have a mass of ~18-33 GeV and an annihilation\ncross section on the order of sigma v ~ 10^-26 cm^3/s (for the representative\ncase of annihilations to bb), similar to the values required to generate the\nGalactic Center gamma-ray excess.\n", "  Hydrogen recombination lines at the submillimetre band (submm-RLs) can serve\nas probes of ionized gas without dust extinction. One therefore expects to\nprobe the broad line region (BLR) of an obscured (type 2) active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) with those lines. However, admitting the large uncertainty in the\ncontinuum level, here we report on the non-detection of both broad and narrow\nH26$\\alpha$ emission line (rest frequency = 353.62 GHz) towards the\nprototypical type 2 AGN of NGC 1068 with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We also investigate the nature of BLR\nclouds that can emit submm-RLs with model calculations. As a result, we suggest\nthat clouds with an electron density ($N_e$) of $\\sim$ 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ can\nmainly contribute to broad submm-RLs in terms of the line flux. On the other\nhand, line flux from other density clouds would be insignificant considering\ntheir too large or too small line optical depths. However, even for the case of\n$N_e \\sim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ clouds, we also suggest that the expected line flux\nis extremely low, which is impractical to detect even with ALMA.\n", "  By pulsed s-shell resonant excitation of a single quantum dot-micropillar\nsystem, we generate long streams of a thousand of near transform-limited single\nphotons with high mutual indistinguishability. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of\ntwo photons are measured as a function of their emission time separation\nvarying from 13 ns to 14.7 {\\mu}s, where the visibility slightly drops from\n95.9(2)% to a plateau of 92.1(5)% through a slow dephasing process occurring at\ntime scale of 0.7 {\\mu}s. Temporal and spectral analysis reveal the pulsed\nresonance fluorescence single photons are close to transform limit, which are\nreadily useful for multi-photon entanglement and interferometry experiments.\n", "  We consider axially periodic Taylor-Couette geometry with insulating boundary\nconditions. The imposed basic states are so-called Chandrasekhar states, where\nthe azimuthal flow $U_\\phi$ and magnetic field $B_\\phi$ have the same radial\nprofiles. Mainly three particular profiles are considered: the Rayleigh limit,\nquasi-Keplerian, and solid-body rotation. In each case we begin by computing\nlinear instability curves and their dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm. For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale\nwith the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm\nthese modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than\nunity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications. However,\nmodes with m>10 can behave very differently. For sufficiently flat profiles,\nthey scale with the magnetic Reynolds number and the Lundquist number, thereby\nallowing instability also for the large magnetic Mach numbers of astrophysical\nobjects. We further compute fully nonlinear, three-dimensional equilibration of\nthese instabilities, and investigate how the energy is distributed among the\nazimuthal (m) and axial (k) wavenumbers. In comparison spectra become steeper\nfor large m, reflecting the smoothing action of shear. On the other hand\nkinetic and magnetic energy spectra exhibit similar behavior: if several\nazimuthal modes are already linearly unstable they are relatively flat, but for\nthe rigidly rotating case where m=1 is the only unstable mode they are so steep\nthat neither Kolmogorov nor Iroshnikov-Kraichnan spectra fit the results. The\ntotal magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy only for large magnetic\nReynolds numbers Rm>100.\n", "  Properties of hot and dense matter are calculated in the framework of quantum\nhadro-dynamics by including contributions from two-loop (TL) diagrams arising\nfrom the exchange of iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons between nucleons. Our\nextension of mean-field theory (MFT) employs the same five density-independent\ncoupling strengths which are calibrated using the empirical properties at the\nequilibrium density of iso-spin symmetric matter. Results of calculations from\nthe MFT and TL approximations are compared for conditions of density,\ntemperature, and proton fraction encountered in astrophysics applications\ninvolving compact objects. The TL results for the equation of state (EOS) of\ncold pure neutron matter at sub- and near-nuclear densities agree well with\nthose of modern quantum Monte Carlo and effective field-theoretical approaches.\nAlthough the high-density EOS in the TL approximation for neutron-star matter\nis substantially softer than its MFT counterpart, it is able to support a\n$2M_\\odot$ neutron star required by recent precise determinations. In addition,\nradii of $1.4M_\\odot$ stars are smaller by $\\sim 1$ km than obtained in MFT. In\ncontrast to MFT, the TL results also give a better account of the\nsingle-particle or optical potentials extracted from analyses of medium-energy\nproton-nucleus and heavy-ion experiments. In degenerate conditions, the thermal\nvariables are well reproduced by results of Landau's Fermi-Liquid theory in\nwhich density-dependent effective masses feature prominently. The ratio of the\nthermal components of pressure and energy density expressed as\n$\\Gamma_{th}=1+(P_{th}/\\epsilon_{th})$, often used in astrophysical\nsimulations, exhibits a stronger dependence on density than on proton fraction\nand temperature in both MFT and TL calculations. The prominent peak of\n$\\Gamma_{th}$ at supra-nuclear density found in MFT is, however, suppressed in\nTL calculations.\n", "  `Direct collapse black holes' (DCBHs) provide possible seeds for supermassive\nblack holes that exist at redshifts as high as z~7. We study Lyman Alpha (Lya)\nradiative transfer through simplified representations of the DCBH-scenario. We\nfind that gravitational heating of the collapsing cloud gives rise to a Lya\ncooling luminosity of up to ~ 1e38(M_gas/1e6 Msun)^2 erg/s. The Lya production\nrate can be significantly larger during the final stages of collapse, but\ncollisional deexcitation efficiently suppresses the emerging Lya flux.\nPhotoionization by a central source boosts the Lya luminosity to\nL~1e43(M_BH/1e6 M_sun) erg/s during specific evolutionary stages of the cloud,\nwhere M_BH denotes the mass of the black hole powering this source. We predict\nthat the width and velocity off-set of the Lya spectral line range from a few\ntens to few thousands km/s, depending sensitively on the evolutionary state of\nthe cloud. We also compare our predictions to observations of CR7 (Sobral et\nal. 2015), a luminous Lya emitter at z~7, which is potentially associated with\na DCBH. If CR7 is powered by a black hole, then its Lya flux alone requires\nthat M_BH> 1e7 M_sun, which exceeds the mass of DCBHs when they first form. The\nobserved width of the Lya spectrum favors the presence of only a low column\ndensity of hydrogen, log [N_HI/cm^-2]~19-20. The shape of the Lya spectrum\nindicates that this gas is outflowing. These requirements imply that if CR7\nharbors a DCBH, then the physical conditions that enabled its formation have\nbeen mostly erased, which is in agreement with theoretical expectations.\n", "  Measuring the absolute scale of the neutrino masses is one of the most\nexciting opportunities available with near-term cosmological datasets. Two\nquantities that are sensitive to neutrino mass, scale-dependent halo bias\n$b(k)$ and the linear growth parameter $f(k)$ inferred from redshift-space\ndistortions, can be measured without cosmic variance. Unlike the amplitude of\nthe matter power spectrum, which always has a finite error, the error on $b(k)$\nand $f(k)$ continues to decrease as the number density of tracers increases.\nThis paper presents forecasts for statistics of galaxy and lensing fields that\nare sensitive to neutrino mass via $b(k)$ and $f(k)$. The constraints on\nneutrino mass from the auto- and cross-power spectra of spectroscopic and\nphotometric galaxy samples are weakened by scale-dependent bias unless a very\nhigh density of tracers is available. In the high density limit, using multiple\ntracers allows cosmic-variance to be beaten and the forecasted errors on\nneutrino mass shrink dramatically. In practice, beating the cosmic variance\nerrors on neutrino mass with $b(k)$ will be a challenge, but this signal is\nnevertheless a new probe of neutrino effects on structure formation that is\ninteresting in its own right.\n", "  Hyperfine-induced electric dipole contributions may significantly increase\nprobabilities of otherwise very weak electric octupole and magnetic quadrupole\natomic clock transitions (e.g. transitions between $s$ and $f$ electron\norbitals). These transitions can be used for exceptionally accurate atomic\nclocks, quantum information processing and search for dark matter. They are\nvery sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as temporal\nvariation of the fine structure constant, the Lorentz invariance and Einstein\nequivalence principle violation. We formulate conditions under which the\nhyperfine-induced electric dipole contribution dominates. Due to the hyperfine\nquenching the electric octupole clock transition in $^{173}$Yb$^+$ is two\norders of magnitude stronger than that in currently used $^{171}$Yb$^+$. Some\nenhancement is found in $^{143}$Nd$^{13+}$, $^{149}$Pm$^{14+}$,\n$^{147}$Sm$^{14+}$, and $^{147}$Sm$^{15+}$ ions.\n", "  Dust polarization in millimeter (and centimeter) has been mapped in disks\naround an increasing number of young stellar objects. It is usually thought to\ncome from emission by magnetically aligned (non-spherical) grains, but can also\nbe produced by dust scattering. We present a semi-analytic theory of disk\npolarization that includes both the direction emission and scattering, with an\nemphasis on their relative importance and how they are affected by the disk\ninclination. For face-on disks, both emission and scattering tend to produce\npolarization in the radial direction, making them difficult to distinguish,\nalthough the scattering-induced polarization can switch to the azimuthal\ndirection if the incident radiation is beamed strongly enough in the radial\ndirection in the disk plane. Disk inclination affects the polarizations from\nemission and scattering differently, especially on the major axis where, in the\nedge-on limit, the former vanishes while the latter reaches a polarization\nfraction as large as 1/3. The polarizations from the two competing mechanisms\ntend to cancel each other on the major axis, producing two low polarization\n\"holes\" (one on each side of the center) under certain conditions. We find\ntantalizing evidence for at least one such \"hole\" in NGC1333 IRAS4A1, whose\npolarization observed at 8 mm on the 100 AU scale is indicative of a pattern\ndominated by scattering close to the center and by direction emission in the\nouter region. If true, it would imply not only that a magnetic field exists on\nthe disk scale, but that it is strong enough to align large, possibly mm-sized,\ngrains.\n", "  We study the inner dynamics of accreting Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld black\nholes using the homogeneous approximation and taking charge as a surrogate for\nangular momentum. We show that there is a minimum of the accretion rate below\nwhich mass inflation does not occur, and we derive an analytical expression for\nthis threshold as a function of the fundamental scale of the theory, the\naccretion rate, the mass, and the charge of the black hole. Our result\nexplicitly demonstrates that, no matter how close Eddington-inspired\nBorn-Infeld gravity is to general relativity, there is always a minimum\naccretion rate below which there is no mass inflation. For larger accretion\nrates, mass inflation takes place inside the black hole as in general\nrelativity until the extremely rapid density variations bring it to an abrupt\nend. We derive analytical scaling solutions for the value of the energy density\nand of the Misner-Sharp mass attained at the end of mass inflation as a\nfunction of fundamental scale of the theory, the accretion rate, the mass, and\nthe charge of the black hole, and compare these with the corresponding\nnumerical solutions. We find that, except for unreasonably high accretion\nrates, our analytical results appear to provide an accurate description of\nhomogeneous mass inflation inside accreting Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld\nblack holes.\n", "  The state $\\chi^{\\vphantom\\dagger}_{c0}(3915)$ has recently been demoted by\nthe Particle Data Group from its previous status as the conventional $c\\bar c$\n$2 {}^3P_0$ state, largely due to the absence of expected $D\\bar D$ decays. We\npropose that $\\chi^{\\vphantom\\dagger}_{c0}(3915)$ is actually the lightest\n$c\\bar c s \\bar s$ state, and calculate the spectrum of such states using the\ndiquark model, identifying many of the observed charmoniumlike states that lack\nopen-charm decay modes as $c\\bar c s \\bar s$. Among other results, we argue\nthat $Y(4140)$ is a $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ $c\\bar c s \\bar s$ state that has been\nnot been seen in two-photon fusion largely as a consequence of the Landau-Yang\ntheorem.\n", "  We consider the physical situations where the resource theories of coherence\nand thermodynamics play competing roles. In particular, we study the creation\nof quantum coherence using unitary operations with limited thermodynamic\nresources. We first find the maximal coherence that can be created under\nunitary operations starting from a thermal state and find explicitly the\nunitary transformation that creates the maximal coherence. Since coherence is\ncreated by unitary operations starting from a thermal state, it requires some\namount of energy. This motivates us to explore the trade-off between the amount\nof coherence that can be created and the energy cost of the unitary process. We\nfind the maximal achievable coherence under the constraint on the available\nenergy. Additionally, we compare the maximal coherence and the maximal total\ncorrelation that can be created under unitary transformations with the same\navailable energy at our disposal. We find that when maximal coherence is\ncreated with limited energy, the total correlation created in the process is\nupper bounded by the maximal coherence and vice versa. For two qubit systems we\nshow that there does not exist any unitary transformation that creates maximal\ncoherence and maximal total correlation simultaneously with a limited energy\ncost.\n", "  We studied the properties of the neutral gas in a sample of 38 local\n[U]LIRGs, which mainly covers the less explored LIRG luminosity range. This\nstudy is based on the analysis of the spatially integrated and spatially\nresolved spectra of the NaD feature obtained with the VIMOS/VLT-IFS. Analyzing\nspatially integrated spectra, we find that the contribution of stars to the\nobserved NaD-EWs is generally small (<35%), and therefore this feature is\ndominated by ISM absorption. After subtracting the stellar contribution, we\nfind that the pure-ISM integrated spectra generally show blueshifted NaD\nprofiles, indicating neutral gas outflow velocities V in the range 65-260 km/s.\nExcluding galaxies with AGNs, V shows a dependency with the SFR of the type V\n\\propto SFR^0.15 (in rather good agreement with previous results). The\nspatially resolved analysis was performed for 40 galaxies, 22 of which have\nneutral gas velocity fields dominated by noncircular motions with signatures of\ncone-like winds. However, a modest number of targets (11/40) show disk\nrotation. We found that the wind masses are in the range (0.4-7.5)x10^8 Msun,\nreaching up to 3% of the dynamical mass of the host. The mass rates are\ntypically only 0.2-0.4 times the SFR indicating that, the mass loss is too\nsmall to slow down the SF significantly. In the majority of cases, the velocity\nof the outflowing gas is not sufficient to escape the host potential well and,\ntherefore, most of the gas rains back into the disk. On average V/v(esc) is\nhigher in less massive galaxies, confirming that the galaxy mass has a primary\nrole in shaping the recycling of gas and metals. The comparison between the\nwind power and kinetic power of the starburst associated with SNe indicates\nthat the starburst could drive the outflows in nearly all the [U]LIRGs\ngalaxies, as the wind power is generally lower than 20% of the kinetic power\nsupplied by the starburst.\n", "  We study scattering of waves by impurities in strongly precompressed granular\nchains. We explore the linear scattering of plane waves and identify a\nclosed-form expression for the reflection and transmission coefficients for the\nscattering of the waves from both a single impurity and a double impurity. For\nsingle-impurity chains, we show that, within the transmission band of the host\ngranular chain, high-frequency waves are strongly attenuated (such that the\ntransmission coefficient vanishes as the wavenumber $k\\rightarrow \\pm\\pi$),\nwhereas low-frequency waves are well-transmitted through the impurity. For\ndouble-impurity chains, we identify a resonance --- enabling full transmission\nat a particular frequency --- in a manner that is analogous to the\nRamsauer--Townsend (RT) resonance from quantum physics. We also demonstrate\nthat one can tune the frequency of the RT resonance to any value in the pass\nband of the host chain. We corroborate our theoretical predictions both\nnumerically and experimentally, and we directly observe complete transmission\nfor frequencies close to the RT resonance frequency. Finally, we show how this\nRT resonance can lead to the existence of reflectionless modes even in granular\nchains (including disordered ones) with multiple double impurities.\n", "  Using the QCD sum rule approach we investigate the possible four-quark\nstructure for the new observed $B_{s}^0\\pi^\\pm$ narrow structure (D0). We use a\ndiquak-antidiquark scalar current and work to the order of $m_s$ in full QCD,\nwithout relying on $1/m_Q$ expansion. Our study indicates that although it is\npossible to obtain a stable mass in agreement with the state found by the D0\ncollaboration, a more constraint analysis (simultaneous requirement of the OPE\nconvergence and the dominance of the pole on the phenomenological side) leads\nto a higher mass. We also predict the masses of the bottom scalar tetraquark\nresonances with zero and two strange quarks.\n", "  In this paper the zero modes of fluctuation of cylindrically symmetric\nself-dual vortices are analyzed and described in full detail. These BPS\ntopological defects arise at the critical point between Type II and Type I\nsuperconductors, or, equivalently, when the masses of the Higgs particle and\nthe vector boson in the Abelian Higgs model are equal. In addition, novel bound\nstates of Higss and vector bosons trapped by the self-dual vortices at their\ncore are found and investigated.\n", "  From August to November 2014 the Rosetta orbiter has performed an extensive\nobservation campaign aimed at the characterization of 67P/CG nucleus properties\nand to the selection of the Philae landing site. The campaign led to the\nproduction of a global map of the illuminated portion of 67P/CG nucleus. During\nthis prelanding phase the comet's heliocentric distance decreased from 3.62 to\n2.93 AU while Rosetta was orbiting around the nucleus at distances between 100\nto 10 km. VIRTIS-M, the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer -\nMapping channel (Coradini et al. 2007) onboard the orbiter, has acquired\n0.25-5.1 micron hyperspectral data of the entire illuminated surface, e.g. the\nnorth hemisphere and the equatorial regions, with spatial resolution between\n2.5 and 25 m/pixel. I/F spectra have been corrected for thermal emission\nremoval in the 3.5-5.1 micron range and for surface's photometric response. The\nresulting reflectance spectra have been used to compute several Cometary\nSpectral Indicators (CSI): single scattering albedo at 0.55 micron, 0.5-0.8\nmicron and 1.0-2.5 micron spectral slopes, 3.2 micron organic material and 2.0\nmicron water ice band parameters (center, depth) with the aim to map their\nspatial distribution on the surface and to study their temporal variability as\nthe nucleus moved towards the Sun. Indeed, throughout the investigated period,\nthe nucleus surface shows a significant increase of the single scattering\nalbedo along with a decrease of the 0.5-0.8 and 1.0-2.5 micron spectral slopes,\nindicating a flattening of the reflectance. We attribute the origin of this\neffect to the partial removal of the dust layer caused by the increased\ncontribution of water sublimation to the gaseous activity as comet crossed the\nfrost-line.\n", "  We investigate the monogamy of holographic $n$-partite information for a\nsystem consisting of $n$ disjoint parallel strips with the same width and\nseparation in AdS and AdS black brane geometries. More precisely, we study the\nsign of this quantity, \\emph{e.g.} for $n=4, 5$, in various dimensions and for\ndifferent parameters. Our results show that for quantum field theories with\nholographic duals, the holographic 4-partite information is always positive and\nthe sign of holographic 5-partite information is found to be negative in the\ndual strongly coupled $1+1$ dimensional CFT. This latter result indicates that\nthe holographic 4-partite information is monogamous. We also find the critical\npoints corresponding to the possible phase transitions of these quantities.\n", "  Some physical systems like the quantum mechanics with magnetic charges or\nfield theoretical models appearing in the context of string theory are\nformulated in terms of non-associative algebras. Hence, demand non-associative\nstar products for its description. However, unlike its associative counterpart\nthe situation with non-associative star products is quite unclear. At the\nmoment it is not evident which condition should be used instead of the\nassociativity in the definition of the non-associative star multiplication. In\nmathematics, the natural generalization of the associativity is the requirement\nthat the multiplication should be alternative, the associator of three elements\nshould vanish if each two of them are equal. We show that for the alternative\nclosed star product the integrated associator vanishes. In particular, it means\nthat on-shell there will be no violation of associativity in string scattering\namplitudes. We discuss the examples of the alternative and closed star\nproducts. In particular, it is constructed the star product corresponding to\nthe algebra of octonions.\n", "  Using a spectroscopically confirmed sample of M-giants, M-dwarfs and quasars\nfrom the LAMOST survey, we assess how well WISE $\\&$ 2MASS color-cuts can be\nused to select M-giant stars. The WISE bands are very efficient at separating\nM-giants from M-dwarfs and we present a simple classification that can produce\na clean and relatively complete sample of M-giants. We derive a new photometric\nrelation to estimate the metallicity for M-giants, calibrated using data from\nthe APOGEE survey. We find a strong correlation between the $(W1-W2)$ color and\n$\\rm [M/H]$, where almost all of the scatter is due to photometric\nuncertainties. We show that previous photometric distance relations, which are\nmostly based on stellar models, may be biased and devise a new empirical\ndistance relation, investigating trends with metallicity and star formation\nhistory. Given these relations, we investigate the properties of M-giants in\nthe Sagittarius stream. The offset in the orbital plane between the leading and\ntrailing tails is reproduced and, by identifying distant M-giants in the\ndirection of the Galactic anti-center, we confirm that the previously detected\ndebris in the outer halo is the apocenter of the trailing tail. We also find\ntentative evidence supporting an existing overdensity near the leading tail in\nthe Northern Galactic hemisphere, possibly an extension to the trailing tail\n(so-called Branch C). We have measured the metallicity distribution along the\nstream, finding a clear metallicity offset between the leading and trailing\ntails, in agreement with models for the stream formation. We include an online\ntable of M-giants to facilitate further studies.\n", "  Unlike the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA), calculations with meta-generalized gradient approximations\n(meta-GGA) are usually done according to the generalized Kohn-Sham (gKS)\nformalism. The exchange-correlation potential of the gKS equation is\nnon-multiplicative, which prevents systematic comparison of meta-GGA\nbandstructures to those of the LDA and the GGA. We implement the optimized\neffective potential (OEP) of the meta-GGA for periodic systems, which allows us\nto carry out meta-GGA calculations in the same KS manner as for the LDA and the\nGGA. We apply the OEP to several meta-GGAs, including the new SCAN functional\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]. We find that the KS gaps and KS band\nstructures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the\nmore realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic\ngaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by\ncomparing with the gaps of the EXX+RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid\nsensitivity of meta-GGAs is much more severe in OEP calculations.\n", "  We propose a general theory for surface patterning in many different\nbiological systems, including mite and insect cuticles, pollen grains, fungal\nspores, and insect eggs. The patterns of interest are often intricate and\ndiverse, yet an individual pattern is robustly reproducible by a single species\nand a similar set of developmental stages produces a variety of patterns. We\nargue that the pattern diversity and reproducibility may be explained by\ninterpreting the pattern development as a first-order phase transition to a\nspatially modulated phase. Brazovskii showed that for such transitions on a\nflat, infinite sheet, the patterns are uniform striped or hexagonal. Biological\nobjects, however, have finite extent and offer different topologies, such as\nthe spherical surfaces of pollen grains. We consider Brazovskii transitions on\nspheres and show that the patterns have a richer phenomenology than simple\nstripes or hexagons. We calculate the free energy difference between the\nunpatterned state and the many possible patterned phases, taking into account\nfluctuations and the system's finite size. The proliferation of variety on a\nsphere may be understood as a consequence of topology, which forces defects\ninto perfectly ordered phases. The defects are then accommodated in different\nways. We also argue that the first-order character of the transition is\nresponsible for the reproducibility and robustness of the pattern formation.\n", "  The hard X-ray detector (HXD) onboard {\\it Suzaku} measured soft\n$\\gamma$-rays from the Type Ia supernova SN2014J at $77\\pm2$ days after the\nexplosion. Although the confidence level of the signal is about 90\\% (i.e., $2\n\\sigma$), the $3 \\sigma$ upper limit has been derived at $< 2.2 \\times10^{-4}$\nph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 170 -- 250 keV band as the first independent\nmeasurement of soft $\\gamma$-rays with an instrument other than {\\it INTEGRAL}.\nFor this analysis, we have examined the reproducibility of the NXB model of\nHXD/GSO using blank sky data. We find that the residual count rate in the 90 --\n500 keV band is distributed around an average of 0.19\\% with a standard\ndeviation of 0.42\\% relative to the NXB rate. The averaged residual signals are\nconsistent with that expected from the cosmic X-ray background. The flux of\nSN2014J derived from {\\it Suzaku} measurements taken in one snapshot at\n$t=77\\pm2$ days after the explosion is consistent with the {\\it INTEGRAL}\nvalues averaged over the period between $t=$50 and 100 days and also with\nexplosion models of single or double degenerate scenarios. Being sensitive to\nthe total ejecta mass surrounding the radioactive material, the ratio between\ncontinuum and line flux in the soft gamma-ray regime might distinguish\ndifferent progenitor models. The {\\it Suzaku} data have been examined with this\nrelation at $t=77\\pm2$ days, but could not distinguish models between single\nand double degenerate-progenitors. We disfavor explosion models with larger\n$^{56}$Ni masses than 1 $M_\\odot$, from our $1 \\sigma$ error on the 170-250 keV\nX-ray flux of $(1.2\\pm0.7) \\times10^{-4}$ ph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$.\n", "  We report on the 1.6 GHz (18 cm) VLBI observations of the unresolved, steady\nTeV source HESS J1943+213 located in the Galactic plane, performed with the\nEuropean VLBI Network (EVN) in 2014. Our new observations with a nearly full\nEVN array provide the deepest image of HESS J1943+213 at the highest resolution\never achieved, enabling us to resolve the long-standing issues of the source\nidentification. The milliarcsecond-scale structure of HESS J1943+213 has a\nclear asymmetric morphology, consisting of a compact core and a diffuse\njet-like tail. This is broadly consistent with the previous e-EVN observations\nof the source performed in 2011, and re-analyzed in this work. The core\ncomponent is characterized by the brightness temperature of $\\gtrsim1.8 \\times\n10^9$ K, which is typical for low-luminosity blazars in general. Overall, radio\nproperties of HESS J1943+213 are consistent with the source classification as\nan \"extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object\". Remarkably, we note that\nsince HESS J1943+213 does not reveal any optical or infrared signatures of the\nAGN activity, it would never be recognized and identified as a BL Lac object,\nif not its location close to the Galactic plane where the High Energy\nStereoscopic System has surveyed, and the follow-up dedicated X-ray and radio\nstudies triggered by the source detection in the TeV range. Our results suggest\ntherefore a presence of an unrecognized, possibly very numerous population of\nparticularly extreme HBLs, and simultaneously demonstrate that the\nlow-frequency VLBI observations with high-angular resolution are indispensable\nfor a proper identification of such objects.\n", "  We present the results of the first X-ray study of a sample of 16 young radio\nsources classified as Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs). We observed six of them\nfor the first time in X-rays using {\\it Chandra}, re-observed four with the\nprevious {\\it XMM-Newton} or {\\it Beppo-SAX} data, and included six other with\nthe archival data. All the sources are nearby, $z<1$ with the age of their\nradio structures ($<3000$~years) derived from the hotspots advance velocity.\nOur results show heterogeneous nature of the CSOs indicating a complex\nenvironment associated with young radio sources. The sample covers a range in\nX-ray luminosity, $L_{2-10\\,\\rm keV} \\sim 10^{41}$-$10^{45}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$,\nand intrinsic absorbing column density of $N_H \\simeq\n10^{21}$--10$^{22}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. In particular, we detected extended X-ray\nemission in 1718$-$649; a hard photon index of $\\Gamma \\simeq 1$ in 2021$+$614\nand 1511$+$0518 consistent with either a Compton thick absorber or non-thermal\nemission from compact radio lobes, and in 0710$+$439 an ionized iron emission\nline at $E_{rest}=(6.62\\pm0.04)$\\,keV and EW $\\sim 0.15-$1.4\\,keV, and a\ndecrease by an order of magnitude in the 2-10 keV flux since the 2008 {\\it\nXMM-Newton} observation in 1607$+$26. We conclude that our pilot study of CSOs\nprovides a variety of exceptional diagnostics and highlights the importance of\ndeep X-ray observations of large samples of young sources. This is necessary in\norder to constrain theoretical models for the earliest stage of radio source\nevolution and study the interactions of young radio sources with the\ninterstellar environment of their host galaxies.\n", "  We report the likely detection of gamma-ray emission from the northeast shell\nregion of the historical supernova remnant (SNR) SN 1006. Having analyzed 7\nyears of Fermi LAT Pass 8 data for the region of SN 1006, we found a GeV\ngamma-ray source detected with 4 sigma significance. Both the position and\nspectrum of the source match those of HESS J1504-418 respectively, which is TeV\nemission from SN 1006. Considering the source as the GeV gamma-ray counterpart\nto SN~1006, the broadband spectral energy distribution is found to be\napproximately consistent with the leptonic scenario that has been proposed for\nthe TeV emission from the SNR. Our result has likely confirmed the previous\nstudy of the SNRs with TeV shell-like morphology: SN 1006 is one of them\nsharing very similar peak luminosity and spectral shape.\n", "  A recent paper investigated minimal R$\\nu$MDM models with the type T1-iii and\nT3 one-loop topologies. However, the candidate most-minimal model does not\npossess an accidental symmetry - the scalar potential contains an explicit\nsymmetry breaking term, rendering the dark matter unstable. We present two\nmodels that cure this problem. However, we further show that all of the\nproposed minimal one-loop R$\\nu$MDM models suffer from a second problem - an\nadditional source of explicit $Z_2$ symmetry breaking in the Yukawa sector. We\nperform a more-general analysis to show that neutrino mass models using either\nthe type T3 or type T1-iii one-loop topologies do not give viable minimal dark\nmatter candidates. Consequently, one-loop models of neutrino mass with minimal\ndark matter do not appear possible. Thus, presently there remains a single\nknown (three-loop) model of neutrino mass that gives stable dark matter without\ninvoking any new symmetries.\n", "  The Drell-Yan (DY) process of dilepton pair production off nuclei is not\naffected by final state interactions, energy loss or absorption. A detailed\nphenomenological study of this process is thus convenient for investigation of\nthe onset of initial-state effects in proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the DY process in $pA$\ninteractions at RHIC and LHC energies in the color dipole framework. We analyse\nseveral effects affecting the nuclear suppression, $R_{pA}<1$, of dilepton\npairs, such as the saturation effects, restrictions imposed by energy\nconservation (the initial-state effective energy loss) and the gluon shadowing,\nas a function of the rapidity, invariant mass of dileptons and their transverse\nmomenta $p_T$. In this analysis, we take into account besides the $\\gamma^*$\nalso the $Z^0$ contribution to the production cross section, thus extending the\npredictions to large dilepton invariant masses. Besides the nuclear attenuation\nof produced dileptons at large energies and forward rapidities emerging due to\nthe onset of shadowing effects, we predict a strong suppression at large $p_T$,\ndilepton invariant masses and Feynman $x_F$ caused by the Initial State\nInteraction effects in kinematic regions where no shadowing is expected. The\nmanifestations of nuclear effects are investigated also in terms of the\ncorrelation function in azimuthal angle between the dilepton pair and a forward\npion $\\Delta\\phi$ for different energies, dilepton rapidites and invariant\ndilepton masses. We predict that the characteristic double-peak structure of\nthe correlation function around $\\Delta \\phi\\simeq \\pi$ arises for very forward\npions and large-mass dilepton pairs.\n", "  We report the results of Suzaku observations of the young supernova remnant,\nVela Jr.\\ (RX J0852.0$-$4622), which is known to emit synchrotron X-rays, as\nwell as TeV gamma-rays. Utilizing 39 Suzaku mapping observation data from Vela\nJr., a significant hard X-ray emission is detected with the hard X-ray detector\n(HXD) from the north-west TeV-emitting region. The X-ray spectrum is well\nreproduced by a single power-law model with the photon index of\n3.15$^{+1.18}_{-1.14}$ in the 12--22 keV band. Compiling this with the soft\nX-ray spectrum simultaneously observed with the X-ray imaging spectrometer\n(XIS) onboard Suzaku, we find that the wide-band X-ray spectrum in the 2--22\nkeV band is reproduced with a single power-law or concave broken power-law\nmodel, which are statistically consistent with each other. Whichever the model\nof a single or broken power-law is appropriate, clearly the spectrum has no\nrolloff structure. Applying this result to the method introduced in\n\\citet{yama2014}, we find that one-zone synchrotron model with electron\nspectrum having a power-law plus exponential cutoff may not be applicable to\nVela Jr.\n", "  In this work we study the partially constrained vielbein formulation of the\nnew quasidilaton theory of massive gravity which couples to both physical and\nfiducial metrics simultaneously via a composite effective metric. This\nformalism improves the new quasidilaton model since the Boulware-Deser ghost is\nremoved fully non-linearly at all scales. This also yields crucial implications\nin the cosmological applications. We derive the governing cosmological\nbackground evolution and study the stability of the attractor solution.\n", "  The gravitational baryogensis may not generate a sufficient baryon asymmetry\nin the standard thermal history of the Universe when we take into account the\ngravitino problem. Hence it has been suggested that anisotropy of the Universe\ncan enhance the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the increase of the\ntime change of the Ricci scalar curvature. We study the gravitational\nbaryogenesis in the presence of anisotropy, which is produced at the end of an\nanisotropic inflation. Although we confirm that the generated baryon asymmetry\nis enhanced compared with the original isotropic cosmological model, taking\ninto account the constraint on the anisotropy by the recent CMB observations,\nwe find that it is still difficult to obtain the observed baryon asymmetry only\nthrough the gravitational baryogenesis without suffering from the gravitino\nproblem.\n", "  We introduce and experimentally characterize a general purpose device for\nsignal processing in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. The device is a\nbroadband two-port microwave circuit element with three modes of operation: it\ncan transmit, reflect, or invert incident signals between 4 and 8 GHz. This\nproperty makes it a versatile tool for lossless signal processing at cryogenic\ntemperatures. In particular, rapid switching (less than or equal to 15 ns)\nbetween these operation modes enables several multiplexing readout protocols\nfor superconducting qubits. We report the device's performance in a two-channel\ncode domain multiplexing demonstration. The multiplexed data are recovered with\nfast readout times (up to 400 ns) and infidelities less than 0.01 for probe\npowers greater than 7 fW, in agreement with the expectation for binary\nsignaling with Gaussian noise.\n", "  Electromagnetic form factors of the baryon octet are studied using a\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model which utilizes the proper-time regularization scheme\nto simulate aspects of colour confinement. In addition, the model also\nincorporates corrections to the dressed quarks from vector meson correlations\nin the t-channel and the pion cloud. Comparison with recent chiral\nextrapolations of lattice QCD results shows a remarkable level of consistency.\nFor the charge radii we find the surprising result $r_{E}^p < r_{E}^{\\Sigma^+}$\nand $|r_{E}^n| < |r_{E}^{\\Xi^0}|$, whereas the magnetic radii have a pattern\nlargely consistent with a naive expectation based on the dressed quark masses.\n", "  In this theoretical study we qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the\nelectric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) in a single Si/SiGe quantum dot in the\npresence of a magnetic field gradient, e.g., produced by a ferromagnet. We\nmodel a situation in which the control of electron spin states is achieved by\napplying an oscillatory electric field, inducing real-space oscillations of the\nelectron inside the quantum dot. One of the goals of our study is to present a\nmicroscopic theory of valley dependent $g$-factors in Si/SiGe quantum dots and\ninvestigate how valley relaxation combined with a valley dependent $g$-factor\nleads to a novel electron spin dephasing mechanism. Furthermore, we discuss the\ninterplay of spin and valley relaxations in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Our findings\nsuggest that the electron spin dephases due to valley relaxation, and are in\nagreement with recent experimental studies [Nature Nanotechnology 9, 666-670\n(2014)].\n", "  We report a detailed $\\mu$SR study of the pressure evolution of the magnetic\norder in the manganese based pnictide MnP, which has been recently found to\nundergo a superconducting transition under pressure once the magnetic ground\nstate is suppressed. Using the muon as a volume sensitive local magnetic probe,\nwe identify a ferromagnetic state as well as two incommensurate helical states\n(with propagation vectors ${\\bf Q}$ aligned along the crystallographic $c-$ and\n$b-$directions, respectively) which transform into each other through first\norder phase transitions as a function of pressure and temperature. Our data\nappear to support that the magnetic state from which superconductivity develops\nat higher pressures is an incommensurate helical phase.\n", "  The prototypical Mira variable, $o$ Cet (Mira), has been observed as a\nScience Verification target in the 2014 ALMA Long Baseline Campaign with a\nlongest baseline of 15 km. ALMA clearly resolves the images of the continuum\nand molecular line emission/absorption at an angular resolution of ~30 mas at\n220 GHz. We image the data of the $^{28}$SiO v=0, 2 $J$=5-4 and H$_2$O\n$\\nu_2$=1 $J(K_a,K_c)$=5(5,0)-6(4,3) transitions and extract spectra from\nvarious lines-of-sight towards Mira's extended atmosphere. In the course of\nimaging, we encountered ambiguities in the resulting images and spectra that\nappear to be related to the performance of the CLEAN algorithm. We resolve\nMira's millimetre continuum emission and our data are consistent with a radio\nphotosphere with a brightness temperature of 2611$\\pm$51 K, in agreement with\nrecent results obtained with the VLA. We do not confirm the existence of a\ncompact region (<5 mas) of enhanced brightness. We derive the gas density,\nkinetic temperature, molecular abundance and outflow/infall velocities in\nMira's extended atmosphere by modelling the SiO and H$_2$O lines. We find that\nSiO-bearing gas starts to deplete beyond 4$R_\\star$ and at a kinetic\ntemperature of $\\lesssim$600 K. The inner dust shells are probably composed of\ngrain types other than pure silicates. During this observation, Mira's\natmosphere generally exhibited infall motion, with a shock front of velocity\n$\\lesssim$12 km/s outside the radio photosphere. The structures predicted by\nthe hydrodynamical model CODEX can reproduce the observed spectra in\nastonishing detail; while some other models fail when confronted with the new\ndata. Combined with radiative transfer modelling, ALMA successfully\ndemonstrates the ability to reveal the physical conditions of the extended\natmospheres and inner winds of AGB stars in unprecedented detail. (Abbreviated\nabstract)\n", "  We discuss fermions in a spontaneously generated holographic lattice\nbackground. The lattice structure at the boundary is generated by introducing a\nhigher-derivative interaction term between a U(1) gauge field and a scalar\nfield. We solve the equations of motion below the critical temperature at which\nthe lattice forms, and analyze the change in the Fermi surface due to the\nlattice. The fermion band structure is found to exhibit a band gap due to\nlattice effects.\n", "  The resistivity $\\rho$ and Hall resistivity $\\rho_H$ are measured on FeSe at\npressures up to $P$ = 28.3 kbar in magnetic fields up to $B$ = 14.5 T. The\n$\\rho(B)$ and $\\rho_H(B)$ curves are analyzed with multicarrier models to\nestimate the carrier density and mobility as a function of $P$ and temperature\n($ T\\leqslant$ 110 K). It is shown that the pressure-induced antiferromagnetic\ntransition is accompanied by an abrupt reduction of the carrier density and\nscattering. This indicates that the electronic structure is reconstructed\nsignificantly by the antiferromagnetic order.\n", "  The Nainital-Cape survey is a dedicated ongoing survey programme to search\nfor and study pulsational variability in chemically peculiar (CP) stars to\nunderstand their internal structure and evolution. The main aims of this survey\nare to find new pulsating Ap and Am stars in the northern and southern\nhemisphere and to perform asteroseismic studies of these new pulsators. The\nsurvey is conducted using high-speed photometry. The candidate stars were\nselected on the basis of having Stromgren photometric indices similar to those\nof known pulsating CP stars. Over the last decade a total of 337 candidate\npulsating CP stars were observed for the Nainital-Cape survey, making it one of\nthe longest ground-based surveys for pulsation in CP stars in terms of time\nspan and sample size. The previous papers of this series presented seven new\npulsating variables and 229 null results. In this paper we present the light\ncurves, frequency spectra and the various astrophysical parameters of the 108\nadditional CP stars observed since the last reported results. We have also\ntabulated the basic physical parameters of the known roAp stars. As part of\nestablishing the detection limits in the Nainital-Cape survey, we investigated\nthe scintillation noise level at the two observing sites used in this survey,\nSutherland and Nainital, by comparing the combined frequency spectra stars\nobserved from each location. Our analysis shows that both the sites permit the\ndetection of variations on the order of 0.6 milli-magnitude (mmag) in the\nfrequency range 1-4 mHz, with Sutherland being marginally better, on average.\n", "  Suppose a quantum system starts to evolve under a Hamiltonian from some\ninitial state. When for the first time, will an observable attain a preassigned\nvalue? To answer this question, one method often adopted is to make\ninstantaneous measurements periodically and note down the serial number for\nwhich the desired result is obtained for the first time. We apply this protocol\nto an interacting spin system at zero temperature and show analytically that\nthe response of this system shows a non-analyticity as a function of the\nparameter of the Hamiltonian and the time interval of measurement. In contrast\nto quantum phase transitions, this new type of phase transition is not a\nproperty of the ground state and arises from the Hamiltonian dynamics and\nquantum mechanical nature of the measurement. The specific system studied is\ntransverse Ising chain and the measurement performed is, whether the total\ntransverse magnetic moment (per site) is not equal to 1. The results for some\nother types of measurement is also discussed.\n", "  We propose an all-electrical experimental setup to detect and manipulate the\namplitude of odd-frequency pairing in a double quantum dot. Odd-frequency pair\namplitude is induced from the breakdown of orbital symmetry when Cooper pairs\nare injected in the double dot with electrons in different dots. When the dot\nlevels are aligned with the Fermi energy, i.e., on resonance, nonlocal Andreev\nprocesses are directly connected to the presence of odd-frequency pairing.\nTherefore, their amplitude can be manipulated by tuning the level positions.\nDetection of nonlocal Andreev processes by conductance measurements contributes\na direct proof of the existence of odd-frequency pair amplitude and is\navailable using current experimental techniques.\n", "  We describe a double-arc-like X-ray structure lying ~15-30\" (~0.8-1.7 kpc)\nsouth of the NGC 5195 nucleus visible in the merged exposures of long Chandra\npointings of M51. The curvature and orientation of the arcs argues for a\nnuclear origin. The arcs are radially separated by ~15\" (~1$ kpc), but are\nrotated relative to each other by ~30 deg. From an archival image, we find a\nslender Halpha-emitting region just outside the outer edge of the outer X-ray\narc, suggesting that the X-ray-emitting gas plowed up and displaced the\nHalpha-emitting material from the galaxy core. Star formation may have\ncommenced in that arc. Halpha emission is present at the inner arc, but appears\nmore complex in structure. In contrast to an explosion expected to be\nazimuthally symmetric, the X-ray arcs suggest a focused outflow. We interpret\nthe arcs as episodic outbursts from the central super-massive black hole\n(SMBH). We conclude that NGC 5195 represents the nearest galaxy exhibiting\non-going, large-scale outflows of gas, in particular, two episodes of a focused\noutburst of the SMBH. The arcs represent a clear demonstration of feedback.\n", "  Relying on generalized-gradient and hybrid first-principles simulations, this\nwork provides a complete characterization of the electronic properties of ZnO\nultra-thin films, cut along the Body-Centered-Tetragonal(010), Cubane(100),\nh-BN(0001), Zinc-Blende(110), Wurtzite(10$\\bar{1}$0) and (0001) orientations.\nThe characteristics of the local densities of states are analyzed in terms of\nthe reduction of the Madelung potential on under-coordinated atoms and surface\nstates/resonances appearing at the top of the VB and bottom of the CB. The gap\nwidth in the films is found to be larger than in the corresponding bulks, which\nis assigned to quantum confinement effects. The components of the high\nfrequency dielectric constant are determined and the absorption spectra of the\nfilms are computed. They display specific features just above the absorption\nthreshold due to transitions from or to the surface resonances. This study\nprovides a first understanding of finite size effects on the electronic\nproperties of ZnO thin films and a benchmark which is expected to foster\nexperimental characterization of ultra-thin films via spectroscopic techniques.\n", "  The usual fluid equations describing the large-scale evolution of mass\ndensity in the universe can be written as local in the density, velocity\ndivergence, and velocity potential fields. As a result, the perturbative\nexpansion in small density fluctuations, usually written in terms of\nconvolutions in Fourier space, can be written as a series of products of these\nfields evaluated at the same location in configuration space. Based on this, we\nestablish a new method to numerically evaluate the 1-loop power spectrum (i.e.,\nFourier transform of the 2-point correlation function) with one-dimensional\nFast Fourier Transforms. This is exact and a few orders of magnitude faster\nthan previously used numerical approaches. Numerical results of the new method\nare in excellent agreement with the standard quadrature integration method.\nThis fast model evaluation can in principle be extended to higher loop order\nwhere existing codes become painfully slow. Our approach follows by writing\nhigher order corrections to the 2-point correlation function as, e.g., the\ncorrelation between two second-order fields or the correlation between a linear\nand a third-order field. These are then decomposed into products of\ncorrelations of linear fields and derivatives of linear fields. The method can\nalso be viewed as evaluating three-dimensional Fourier space convolutions using\nproducts in configuration space, which may also be useful in other contexts\nwhere similar integrals appear.\n", "  Haumea is one of the most interesting and intriguing transneptunian objects\n(TNOs). It is a large, bright, fast rotator, and its spectrum indicates nearly\npure water ice on the surface. It has at least two satellites and a dynamically\nrelated family of more than ten TNOs with very similar proper orbital\nparameters and similar surface properties. The Haumean family is the only one\ncurrently known in the transneptunian belt. Various models have been proposed\nbut the formation of the family remains poorly understood. In this work, we\nhave investigated the rotational properties of the family members and\nunconfirmed family candidates with short-term variability studies, and report\nthe most complete review to date. We present results based on five years of\nobservations and report the short-term variability of five family members, and\nseven candidates. The mean rotational periods, from Maxwellian fits to the\nfrequency distributions, are 6.27+/-1.19 h for the confirmed family members,\n6.44+/-1.16 h for the candidates, and 7.65+/-0.54 h for other TNOs (without\nrelation to the family). According to our study, there is a suggestion that\nHaumea family members rotate faster than other TNOs, however, the sample of\nfamily member is still too limited for a secure conclusion. We also highlight\nthe fast rotation of 2002 GH32. This object has a 0.36+/-0.02 mag amplitude\nlightcurve and a rotational period of about 3.98 h. Assuming 2002 GH32 is a\ntriaxial object in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the\ndensity of 2.56 g cm^-3. This density is similar to Haumea's and much more\ndense than other small TNO densities.\n", "  We present first results from a program of Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) observations of circumnuclear gas\ndisks in early-type galaxies. The program was designed with the goal of\ndetecting gas within the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black\nholes. In NGC 1332, the 0.3\"-resolution ALMA data reveal CO emission from the\nhighly inclined (i~ 83 degrees) circumnuclear disk, spatially coincident with\nthe dust disk seen in Hubble Space Telescope images. The disk exhibits a\ncentral upturn in maximum line-of-sight velocity reaching +-500 km/s relative\nto the systemic velocity, consistent with the expected signature of rapid\nrotation around a supermassive black hole. Rotational broadening and beam\nsmearing produce complex and asymmetric line profiles near the disk center. We\nconstructed dynamical models for the rotating disk and fitted the modeled CO\nline profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Degeneracy between rotation and\nturbulent velocity dispersion in the inner disk precludes the derivation of\nstrong constraints on the black hole mass, but model fits allowing for a\nplausible range in the magnitude of the turbulent dispersion imply a central\nmass in the range ~(4-8)x10^8 Msun. We argue that gas-kinematic observations\nresolving the black hole's projected radius of influence along the disk's minor\naxis will have the capability to yield black hole mass measurements that are\nlargely insensitive to systematic uncertainties in turbulence or in the stellar\nmass profile. For highly inclined disks, this is a much more stringent\nrequirement than the usual sphere-of-influence criterion.\n", "  The crystalline silicates features are mainly reflected in infrared bands.\nThe Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) collected numerous spectra of various\nobjects and provided a big database to investigate crystalline silicates in a\nwide range of astronomical environments. We apply the manifold ranking\nalgorithm to perform a systematic search for the spectra with crystalline\nsilicates features in the Spitzer IRS Enhanced Products available. In total,\n868 spectra of 790 sources are found to show the features of crystalline\nsilicate. These objects are cross-matched with the SIMBAD database as well as\nwith the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope\n(LAMOST)/DR2. The average spectrum of young stellar objects show a variety of\nfeatures dominated either by forsterite or enstatite or neither, while the\naverage spectrum of evolved objects consistently present dominant features of\nforsterite in AGB, OH/IR, post-AGB and planetary nebulae. They are identified\noptically as early-type stars, evolved stars, galaxies and so on. In addition,\nthe strength of spectral features in typical silicate complexes is calculated.\nThe results are available through CDS for the astronomical community to further\nstudy crystalline silicate.\n", "  In this paper, We report the interplanetary effects of a fast coronal mass\nejection (CME) associated with the intense X2.7 flare that occurred on 05 May\n2015. The near-Sun signatures of the CME at low-coronal heights $<$2\n{R$_{\\odot}$} are obtained from the EUV images at 171 {\\AA} and metric radio\nobservations. The intensity and duration of the CME-driven radio bursts in the\nnear-Sun and interplanetary medium indicate this CME event to be an energetic\none. The interplanetary scintillation data, along with the low-frequency radio\nspectrum, played a crucial role in understanding the radial evolution of the\nspeed and expansion of the CME in the inner heliosphere as well as its\ninteraction with a preceding slow CME. The estimation of the speed of the CME\nat several points along the Sun to 1 AU shows shows that i) the CME went\nthrough a rapid acceleration as well as expansion up to a height of $\\approx$6\n{R$_{\\odot}$}, and ii) the CME continued to propagate at speed $\\geq$800\nkms$^{-1}$ between the Sun and 1 AU. These results show that the CME likely\novercame the drag exerted by the ambient/background solar-wind with the support\nof its internal magnetic energy. When the CME interacted with a slow preceding\nCME, the turbulence level associated with the CME-driven disturbance increased\nsignificantly.\n", "  Transition-metal-based Heusler semiconductors are promising materials for a\nvariety of applications ranging from spintronics to thermoelectricity.\nEmploying the $GW$ approximation within the framework of the FLAPW method, we\nstudy the quasi-particle band structure of a number of such compounds being\nalmost gapless semiconductors. We find that in contrast to the\n\\textit{sp}-electron based semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, in these systems\nthe many-body corrections have a minimal effect on the electronic band\nstructure and the energy band gap increases by less than 0.2~eV, which makes\nthe starting point density functional theory (DFT) a good approximation for the\ndescription of electronic and optical properties of these materials.\nFurthermore, the band gap can be tuned either by the variation of the lattice\nparameter or by the substitution of the \\emph{sp}-chemical element.\n", "  The observability of a gluino at LHC RUN II is analyzed for the case where\nthe gluino lies in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region and the mass gap\nbetween the gluino and the neutralino is small. The analysis is carried out\nunder the Higgs boson mass constraint and the constraint of dark matter relic\ndensity consistent with the WMAP and Planck experiment. It is shown that in\nthis case a gluino with mass much smaller than the current lower limit of $\\sim\n1500$ GeV as given by LHC RUN II at 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity\nwould have escaped detection. The analysis is done using the signal regions\nused by the ATLAS Collaboration where an optimization of signal regions was\ncarried out to determine the best regions for gluino discovery in the\ngluino-neutralino coannihilation region. It is shown that under the Higgs boson\nmass constraint and the relic density constraint, a gluino mass of $\\sim 700$\nGeV would require 14 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity for discovery and a\ngluino of mass $\\sim 1250$ GeV would require 3400 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated\nluminosity for discovery at LHC RUN II. An analysis of dark matter for this\ncase is also given. It is found that for the range of gluino masses considered,\nthe neutralino mass lies within less than 100 GeV of the gluino mass. Thus a\nmeasurement of the gluino mass in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region\nwill provide a determination of the neutralino mass. In this region the\nneutralino is dominantly a gaugino and the spin-independent proton-neutralino\ncross section is small but much larger than the neutrino floor lying in the\nrange $\\sim (1-10)\\times 10^{-47}$ cm$^{2}$. Thus a significant part of the\nparameter space of the model will lie within the reach of the next generation\nLUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment.\n", "  The observations of post eruption arcades (PEAs) in X-rays and EUV reveal\nstrong localised brightenings at the loop top regions. The origin of these\nbrightenings and their dynamics is not well understood to date. Here, we study\nthe dynamics of PEAs using one-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling with the\nfocus on the the understanding of the formation of localised brightening.Our\nfindings suggest that these brightenings are the result of collisions between\nthe counter-streaming chromospheric evaporation from both the foot points. We\nfurther perform forward modelling of the emission observed in simulated results\nin various spectral lines observed by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope\naboard Hinode. The forward modelled intensities in various spectral lines are\nin close agreement with a flare observed in December 17, 2006 by EIS.\n", "  Tensor network (TN) methods, in particular the Matrix Product States (MPS)\nansatz, have proven to be a useful tool in analyzing the properties of lattice\ngauge theories. They allow for a very good precision, much better than standard\nMonte Carlo (MC) techniques for the models that have been studied so far, due\nto the possibility of reaching much smaller lattice spacings. The real reason\nfor the interest in the TN approach, however, is its ability, shown so far in\nseveral condensed matter models, to deal with theories which exhibit the\nnotorious sign problem in MC simulations. This makes it prospective for dealing\nwith the non-zero chemical potential in QCD and other lattice gauge theories,\nas well as with real-time simulations. In this paper, using matrix product\noperators, we extend our analysis of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to\nshow the feasibility of this approach also at finite temperature. This is an\nimportant step on the way to deal with the sign problem of QCD. We analyze in\ndetail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases and show\nthat the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of\ntemperatures, essentially from zero to infinite temperature.\n", "  The post-inflationary evolution of inflation-produced magnetic fields,\nconventional or not, can change dramatically when two fundamental issues are\naccounted for. The first is causality, which demands that local physical\nprocesses can never affect superhorizon perturbations. The second is the nature\nof the transition from inflation to reheating and then to the radiation era,\nwhich determine the initial conditions at the start of these epochs. Causality\nimplies that inflationary magnetic fields dot not freeze into the matter until\nthey have re-entered the causal horizon. The nature of the cosmological\ntransitions and the associated initial conditions, on the other hand, determine\nthe large-scale magnetic evolution after inflation. Put together, the two can\nslow down the adiabatic magnetic decay on superhorizon scales throughout the\nuniverse's post-inflationary evolution and thus lead to considerably stronger\nresidual magnetic fields. This is \"good news\" for both the conventional and the\nnon-conventional scenarios of cosmic magnetogenesis. Mechanisms operating\noutside standard electromagnetism, in particular, do not need to enhance their\nfields too much during inflation, in order to produce seeds that can feed the\ngalactic dynamo today. In fact, even conventionally produced inflationary\nmagnetic fields might be able to sustain the dynamo.\n", "  We define a new set of observables to probe the structure of the underlying\nevent in hadron collisions. We use the conventional definition of the\n`transverse region' in jet events and, for a fixed window in jet $p_\\perp$,\npropose to measure several discriminating quantities as a function of the level\nof activity in the transverse region. The measurement of these observables in\nLHC data would reveal whether, e.g., the properties of `low-UE' events are\ncompatible with equivalent measurements in $e^+e^-$ collisions (jet\nuniversality), and whether the scaling behaviour towards `high-UE' events\nexhibits properties of non-trivial soft-QCD dynamics, such as colour\nre-connections or other collective phenomena. We illustrate at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nTeV that significant discriminatory power is obtained in comparisons between MC\nmodels with varying treatments of collective effects, including Pythia 8, EPOS,\nand Dipsy.\n", "  Filamentary structures are common morphological features of the cold,\nmolecular interstellar medium (ISM). Recent studies have discovered massive,\nhundred-parsec-scale filaments that may be connected to the large-scale,\nGalactic spiral arm structure. Addressing the nature of these Giant Molecular\nFilaments (GMFs) requires a census of their occurrence and properties. We\nperform a systematic search of GMFs in the fourth Galactic quadrant and\ndetermine their basic physical properties. We identify GMFs based on their dust\nextinction signatures in near- and mid-infrared and velocity structure probed\nby ^{13}CO line emission. We use the ^{13}CO line emission and ATLASGAL dust\nemission data to estimate the total and dense gas masses of the GMFs. We\ncombine our sample with an earlier sample from literature and study the\nGalactic environment of the GMFs. We identify nine GMFs in the fourth Galactic\nquadrant; six are located in the Centaurus spiral arm and three in inter-arm\nregions. Combining this sample with an earlier study using the same\nidentification criteria in the first Galactic quadrant results in 16 GMFs, nine\nof which are located within spiral arms. The GMFs have sizes of 80-160 pc and\n^{13}CO-derived masses between 5-90 x 10^{4} Msun. Their dense gas mass\nfractions are between 1.5-37%, being higher in the GMFs connected to spiral\narms. We also compare the different GMF-identification methods and find that\nemission and extinction based techniques overlap only partially, highlighting\nthe need to use both to achieve a complete census.\n", "  Observations of debris disks offer a window into the physical and dynamical\nproperties of planetesimals in extrasolar systems through the size distribution\nof dust grains. In particular, the millimeter spectral index of thermal dust\nemission encodes information on the grain size distribution. We have made new\nVLA observations of a sample of seven nearby debris disks at 9 mm, with 3\"\nresolution and $\\sim5$ $\\mu$Jy/beam rms. We combine these with archival ATCA\nobservations of eight additional debris disks observed at 7 mm, together with\nup-to-date observations of all disks at (sub)millimeter wavelengths from the\nliterature to place tight constraints on the millimeter spectral indices and\nthus grain size distributions. The analysis gives a weighted mean for the slope\nof the power law grain size distribution, $n(a)\\propto a^{-q}$, of $\\langle q\n\\rangle = 3.36\\pm0.02$, with a possible trend of decreasing $q$ for later\nspectral type stars. We compare our results to a range of theoretical models of\ncollisional cascades, from the standard self-similar, steady-state size\ndistribution ($q=3.5$) to solutions that incorporate more realistic physics\nsuch as alternative velocity distributions and material strengths, the\npossibility of a cutoff at small dust sizes from radiation pressure, as well as\nresults from detailed dynamical calculations of specific disks. Such effects\ncan lead to size distributions consistent with the data, and plausibly the\nobserved scatter in spectral indices. For the AU Mic system, the VLA\nobservations show clear evidence of a highly variable stellar emission\ncomponent; this stellar activity obviates the need to invoke the presence of an\nasteroid belt to explain the previously reported compact millimeter source in\nthis system.\n", "  The sunspot number is analyzed by using detailed sunspot data, including\naspects of observability, sunspot sizes, and proper identification of sunspot\ngroups as discrete entities of the solar activity. The tests show that besides\nthe subjective factors there are also objective causes of the ambiguities in\nthe series of sunspot numbers. To introduce an alternative activity measure the\nphysical meaning of the sunspot number has to be reconsidered. It contains two\ncomponents whose numbers are governed by different physical mechanisms, this is\none source of the ambiguity. This article suggests an activity index, which is\nthe amount of emerged magnetic flux. The only long-term proxy measure is the\ndetailed sunspot area dataset with proper calibration to the magnetic flux\namount. The Debrecen sunspot databases provide an appropriate source for the\nestablishment of the suggested activity index.\n", "  NGC 1808 is a nearby barred starburst galaxy with an outflow from the nuclear\nregion. To study the inflow and outflow processes related to star formation and\ndynamical evolution of the galaxy, we have carried out \\(^{12}\\)CO (\\(J=1-0\\))\nmapping observations of the central \\(r\\sim4\\) kpc of NGC 1808 using the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Four distinct components\nof molecular gas are revealed at high spatial resolution of 2\\arcsec\n(\\(\\sim100\\) pc): (1) a compact (\\(r<200\\) pc) circumnuclear disk (CND), (2)\n\\(r\\sim500\\) pc ring, (3) gas-rich galactic bar, and (4) spiral arms. Basic\ngeometric and kinematic parameters are derived for the central 1-kpc region\nusing tilted-ring modeling. The derived rotation curve reveals multiple mass\ncomponents that include (1) a stellar bulge, (2) nuclear bar and molecular CND,\nand (3) unresolved massive (\\(\\sim10^7~M_\\sun\\)) core. Two systemic velocities,\n998 km s\\(^{-1}\\) for the CND and 964 km s\\(^{-1}\\) for the 500-pc ring, are\nrevealed, indicating a kinematic offset. The pattern speed of the primary bar,\nderived by using a cloud-orbit model, is \\(56\\pm11\\) km s\\(^{-1}\\)\nkpc\\(^{-1}\\). Non-circular motions are detected associated with a nuclear\nspiral pattern and outflow in the central 1-kpc region. The ratio of the mass\noutflow rate to the star formation rate is \\(\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{out}/SFR\\sim0.2\\)\nin the case of optically thin CO (1-0) emission in the outflow, suggesting low\nefficiency of star formation quenching.\n", "  We investigate the occurrence of slipping magnetic reconnection,\nchromospheric evaporation, and coronal loop dynamics in the 2014 September 10\nX-class flare. The slipping reconnection is found to be present throughout the\nflare from its early phase. Flare loops are seen to slip in opposite directions\ntowards both ends of the ribbons. Velocities of 20--40 km\\,s$^{-1}$ are found\nwithin time windows where the slipping is well resolved. The warm coronal loops\nexhibit expanding and contracting motions that are interpreted as displacements\ndue to the growing flux rope that subsequently erupts. This flux rope existed\nand erupted before the onset of apparent coronal implosion. This indicates that\nthe energy release proceeds by slipping reconnection and not via coronal\nimplosion. The slipping reconnection leads to changes in the geometry of the\nobserved structures at the \\textit{IRIS} slit position, from flare loop top to\nthe footpoints in the ribbons. This results in variations of the observed\nvelocities of chromospheric evaporation in the early flare phase. Finally, it\nis found that the precursor signatures including localized EUV brightenings as\nwell as non-thermal X-ray emission are signatures of the flare itself,\nprogressing from the early phase towards the impulsive phase, with the\ntether-cutting being provided by the slipping reconnection. The dynamics of\nboth the flare and outlying coronal loops is found to be consistent with the\npredictions of the standard solar flare model in 3D.\n", "  We study weak coupling perturbative series in 4d N=2 and 5d N=1\nsupersymmetric gauge theories with Lagrangians. We prove that the perturbative\nseries of these theories in zero instanton sector are Borel summable for\nvarious observables. Our result for 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ case supports an\nexpectation from a recent proposal on a semiclassical realization of infrared\nrenormalons in QCD-like theories, where the semiclassical solution does not\nexist in N=2 theories and the perturbative series are unambiguous, namely Borel\nsummable. We also prove that the perturbative series in arbitrary number of\ninstanton sector are Borel summable for a wide class of theories. It turns out\nthat exact results can be obtained by summing over the Borel resummations in\neach number of instanton sector.\n", "  We explore the gas ionization and kinematics, as well as the optical--IR\nspectral energy distributions for UGC 11185, a nearby pair of merging galaxies\nhosting obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs), also known as SDSS\nJ181611.72+423941.6 and J181609.37+423923.0 (J1816NE and J1816SW, $z \\approx\n0.04$). Due to the wide separation between these interacting galaxies ($\\sim\n23$ kpc), observations of these objects provide a rare glimpse of the\nconcurrent growth of supermassive black holes at an early merger stage. We use\nBPT line diagnostics to show that the full extent of the narrow line emission\nin both galaxies is photoionized by an AGN and confirm the existence of a\n10-kpc-scale ionization cone in J1816NE, while in J1816SW the AGN narrow-line\nregion is much more compact (1--2 kpc) and relatively undisturbed. Our\nobservations also reveal the presence of ionized gas that nearly spans the\nentire distance between the galaxies which is likely in a merger-induced tidal\nstream. In addition, we carry out a spectral analysis of the X-ray emission\nusing data from {\\em XMM-Newton}. These galaxies represent a useful pair to\nexplore how the [\\ion{O}{3}] luminosity of an AGN is dependent on the size of\nthe region used to explore the extended emission. Given the growing evidence\nfor AGN \"flickering\" over short timescales, we speculate that the appearances\nand impact of these AGNs may change multiple times over the course of the\ngalaxy merger, which is especially important given that these objects are\nlikely the progenitors of the types of systems commonly classified as \"dual\nAGNs.\"\n", "  We consider the possibility to produce a bouncing universe in the framework\nof scalar-tensor gravity when the scalar field has a nonconformal coupling to\nthe Ricci scalar. We prove that bouncing universes regular in the future with\nessentially the same dynamics as for the conformal coupling case do exist when\nthe coupling deviates slightly from it. This is found numerically for more\nsubstantial deviations as well. In some cases however new features are found\nlike the ability of the system to leave the effective phantom regime.\n", "  We report on the detection of Lyman continuum radiation in two nearby\nstarburst galaxies. Tol 0440-381, Tol 1247-232 and Mrk 54 were observed with\nthe Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescopes. The three\ngalaxies have radial velocities of ~13,000 km/s, permitting a ~35 A window on\nthe restframe Lyman continuum shortward of the Milky Way Lyman edge at 912 A.\nThe chosen instrument configuration using the G140L grating covers the spectral\nrange from 912 to 2,000 {\\AA}. We developed a dedicated background subtraction\nmethod to account for temporal and spatial background variations of the\ndetector, which is crucial at the low flux levels around 912 A. This modified\npipeline allowed us to significantly improve the statistical and systematic\ndetector noise and will be made available to the community. We detect Lyman\ncontinuum in all three galaxies. However, we conservatively interpret the\nemission in Tol 0440-381 as an upper limit due to possible contamination by\ngeocoronal Lyman series lines. We determined the current star-formation\nproperties from the far-ultraviolet continuum and spectral lines and used\nsynthesis models to predict the Lyman continuum radiation emitted by the\ncurrent population of hot stars. We discuss the various model uncertainties\nsuch as, among others, atmospheres and evolution models. Lyman continuum escape\nfractions were derived from a comparison between the observed and predicted\nLyman continuum fluxes. Tol 1247-232, Mrk 54 and Tol 0440-381 have absolute\nescape fractions of (4.5 +/- 1.2)%, (2.5 +/- 0.72)% and <(7.1 +/- 1.1)%,\nrespectively.\n", "  In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of 295 short\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Konus-Wind (KW) from 1994 to 2010. From the\ntemporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations,\nthe spectral lags, the results of spectral fits with three model functions, the\ntotal energy fluences and the peak energy fluxes of the bursts. We discuss\nevidence found for an additional power-law spectral component and the presence\nof extended emission in a fraction of the KW short GRBs. Finally, we consider\nthe results obtained in the context of the Type I (merger-origin) / Type II\n(collapsar-origin) classifications.\n", "  The SHELS (Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey) is a complete redshift\nsurvey covering two well-separated fields (F1 and F2) of the Deep Lens Survey.\nBoth fields are more than 94% complete to a Galactic extinction corrected R0 =\n20.2. Here we describe the redshift survey of the F1 field centered at R.A. =\n00h53m25.3s and Decl = 12d33m55s; like F2, the F1 field covers 4 sq deg. The\nredshift survey of the F1 field includes 9426 new galaxy redshifts measured\nwith Hectospec on the MMT (published here). As a guide to future uses of the\ncombined survey we compare the mass metallicity relation and the distributions\nof D4000 as a function of stellar mass and redshift for the two fields. The\nmass-metallicity relations differ by an insignificant 1.6 sigma. For galaxies\nin the stellar mass range 1.e10 to 1.e11 MSun, the increase in the star-forming\nfraction with redshift is remarkably similar in the two fields. The seemingly\nsurprising 31-38% difference in the overall galaxy counts in F1 and F2 is\nprobably consistent with the expected cosmic variance given the subtleties of\nthe relative systematics in the two surveys. We also review the Deep Lens\nSurvey cluster detections in the two fields: poorer photometric data for F1\nprecluded secure detection of the single massive cluster at z = 0.35 that we\nfind in SHELS. Taken together the two fields include 16,055 redshifts for\ngalaxies with R0 <= 20.2 and 20,754 redshifts for galaxies with R <= 20.6.\nThese dense surveys in two well-separated fields provide a basis for future\ninvestigations of galaxy properties and large-scale structure.\n", "  The blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 hosts a very young starburst\ncontaining twin nuclear star clusters, separated by a projected distance of 5\npc. One cluster (#5) coincides with the peak of the H-alpha emission and the\nother (#11) with a massive ultracompact H II region. A recent analysis of these\nclusters shows that they have a photometric age of 1+/-1 Myr, in apparent\ncontradiction with the age of 3-5 Myr inferred from the presence of Wolf-Rayet\nfeatures in the cluster #5 spectrum. We examine Hubble Space Telescope\nultraviolet and Very Large Telescope optical spectroscopy of #5 and show that\nthe stellar features arise from very massive stars (VMS), with masses greater\nthan 100 Msun, at an age of 1-2 Myr. We further show that the very high\nionizing flux from the nuclear clusters can only be explained if VMS are\npresent. We investigate the origin of the observed nitrogen enrichment in the\ncircum-cluster ionized gas and find that the excess N can be produced by\nmassive rotating stars within the first 1 Myr. We find similarities between the\nNGC 5253 cluster spectrum and those of metal poor, high redshift galaxies. We\ndiscuss the presence of VMS in young, star-forming galaxies at high redshift;\nthese should be detected in rest frame UV spectra to be obtained with the James\nWebb Space Telescope. We emphasize that population synthesis models with upper\nmass cut-offs greater than 100 Msun are crucial for future studies of young\nmassive star clusters at all redshifts.\n", "  The ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) system of Bose particles of spin\nzero, interacting via a repulsive Gaussian-Core potential, has been\ninvestigated by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The quantum phase\ndiagram is qualitatively identical to that of 2D Yukawa bosons. While the\nsystem is a fluid at all densities for weak coupling, in the strong coupling\nregime it transitions upon compression from a low density superfluid to a\ncrystal, and then into a reentrant superfluid phase. No evidence of a\n(supersolid) cluster crystal phase is seen.\n", "  We have built the historical light curve of the luminous variable GR 290 back\nto 1901, from old observations of the star found in several archival plates of\nM 33. These old recordings together with published and new data show that for\nat least half a century the star was in a low luminosity state, with B ~18.\nAfter 1960, five large variability cycles of visual luminosity were recorded.\nThe amplitude of the oscillations was seen increasing towards the 1992-1994\nmaximum, then decreasing during the last maxima. The recent light curve\nindicates that the photometric variations have been quite similar in all the\nbands, and that the B-V color index has been constant within +/-0.1 m despite\nthe 1.5m change of the visual luminosity. The spectrum of GR 290 at the large\nmaximum of 1992-94, was equivalent to late-B type, while, during 2002-2014, it\nhas varied between WN10h-11h near the visual maxima to WN8h-9h at the\nluminosity minima. We have detected, during this same period, a clear\nanti-correlation between the visual luminosity, the strength of the HeII 4686 A\nemission line, the strength of the 4600-4700 A lines blend and the spectral\ntype. From a model analysis of the spectra collected during the whole 2002-2014\nperiod we find that the Rosseland radius R_{2/3}, changed between the minimum\nand maximum luminosity phases by a factor of 3, while T_eff varied between\nabout 33,000 K and 23,000 K. The bolometric luminosity of the star was not\nconstant, but increased by a factor of ~1.5 between minimum and maximum\nluminosity, in phase with the apparent luminosity variations. In the light of\ncurrent evolutionary models of very massive stars, we find that GR 290 has\nevolved from a ~60 M_Sun progenitor star and should have an age of about 4\nmillion years. We argue that it has left the LBV stage and is moving to a\nWolf-Rayet stage of late nitrogen spectral type.\n", "  The Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are deviations of the measured\nmid-transit times from the exact periodicity. One of the most interesting\ncauses of TTVs is the gravitational interaction between planets. Here we\nconsider a case of two planets in a mean motion resonance (orbital periods in a\nratio of small integers). This case is important because the resonant\ninteraction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more\neasily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small\norbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms. We find\nthat a resonant system should show TTV terms with two basic periods (and their\nharmonics). The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M_*)^(-2/3), where m and\nM_* are the planetary and stellar masses. For m=10^(-4) M_*, for example, the\nTTV period exceeds the orbital period by ~2 orders of magnitude. The amplitude\nof the resonant TTV terms scales linearly with the libration amplitude. The\nratio of the TTV amplitudes of two resonant planets is inversely proportional\nto the ratio of their masses. These and other relationships discussed in the\nmain text can be used to aid the interpretation of TTV observations.\n", "  In protoplanetary disks, micron-sized dust grains coagulate to form highly\nporous dust aggregates. Because the optical properties of these aggregates are\nnot completely understood, it is important to investigate how porous dust\naggregates scatter light. In this study, the light scattering properties of\nporous dust aggregates were calculated using a rigorous method, the T-matrix\nmethod, and the results were then compared with those obtained using the\nRayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) theory and Mie theory with the effective medium\napproximation (EMT). The RGD theory is applicable to moderately large\naggregates made of nearly transparent monomers. This study considered two types\nof porous dust aggregates, ballistic cluster-cluster agglomerates (BCCAs) and\nballistic particle-cluster agglomerates (BPCAs). First, the angular dependence\nof the scattered intensity was shown to reflect the hierarchical structure of\ndust aggregates; the large-scale structure of the aggregates is responsible for\nthe intensity at small scattering angles, and their small-scale structure\ndetermines the intensity at large scattering angles. Second, it was determined\nthat the EMT underestimates the backward scattering intensity by multiple\norders of magnitude, especially in BCCAs, because the EMT averages the\nstructure within the size of the aggregates. It was concluded that the RGD\ntheory is a very useful method for calculating the optical properties of BCCAs.\n", "  Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proposed for large-scale graphene\nsynthesis for practical applications. However, the inferior electronic\nproperties of CVD graphene are one of the key problems to be solved. In this\nstudy, we present a detailed study on the electronic properties of high-quality\nsingle crystal monolayer graphene. The graphene is grown by CVD on copper using\na cold-wall reactor and then transferred to Si/SiO2. Our low-temperature\nmagneto-transport data demonstrate that the characteristics of the measured\nsingle-crystal CVD graphene samples are superior to those of polycrystalline\ngraphene and have a quality which is comparable to that of exfoliated graphene\non Si/SiO2. The Dirac point in our best samples is located at back-gate\nvoltages of less than 10V, and their mobility can reach 11000 cm2/Vs. More than\n12 flat and discernible half-integer quantum Hall plateaus have been observed\nin high magnetic field on both the electron and hole side of the Dirac point.\nAt low magnetic field, the magnetoresistance shows a clear weak localization\npeak. Using the theory of McCann et al., we find that the inelastic scattering\nlength is larger than 1 {\\mu}m in these samples even at the charge neutrality\npoint.\n", "  We studied the magnetic topology of active region 12158 on 2014 September 10\nand compared it with the observations before and early in the flare which\nbegins at 17:21 UT (SOL2014-09-10T17:45:00). Our results show that the\nsigmoidal structure and flare ribbons of this active region observed by SDO/AIA\ncan be well reproduced from a Grad-Rubin non linear force free field\nextrapolation method. Various inverse-S and -J shaped magnetic field lines,\nthat surround a coronal flux rope, coincide with the sigmoid as observed in\ndifferent extreme ultraviolet wavelengths, including its multi-threaded curved\nends. Also, the observed distribution of surface currents in the magnetic\npolarity where it was not prescribed is well reproduced. This validates our\nnumerical implementation and set-up of the Grad-Rubin method. The modeled\ndouble inverse-J shaped Quasi-Separatrix Layer (QSL) footprints match the\nobserved flare ribbons during the rising phase of the flare, including their\nhooked parts. The spiral-like shape of the latter may be related to a complex\npre-eruptive flux rope with more than one turn of twist, as obtained in the\nmodel. These ribbon-associated flux-rope QSL-footprints are consistent with the\nnew standard flare model in 3D, with the presence of a hyperbolic flux tube\nlocated below an inverse tear drop shaped coronal QSL. This is a new step\nforward forecasting the locations of reconnection and ribbons in solar flares,\nand the geometrical properties of eruptive flux ropes.\n", "  The results of speckle interferometric observations at the SOAR telescope in\n2015 are given, totalling 1303 measurements of 924 resolved binary and multiple\nstars and non-resolutions of 260 targets. The separations range from 12 mas to\n3.37\" (median 0.17\"); the maximum measured magnitude difference is 6.7 mag. We\nresolved 27 pairs for the first time, including 10 as inner or outer subsystems\nin previously known binaries, e.g. the 50-mas pair in Epsilon Cha. Newly\nresolved pairs are commented upon. We discuss three apparently non-hierarchical\nsystems discovered in this series, arguing that their unusual configuration\nresults from projection. The resolved quadruple system HIP 71510 is studied as\nwell.\n", "  Most of our knowledge of the radio morphology and kinematics of X-ray binary\npartially synchrotron self-absorbed compact jets (hereafter compact jets) is\nbased on the observations of GRS~1915+105 which has the most prominent compact\njet. Yet, the compact jet bulk velocity, $v$, is poorly constrained in the\nliterature, $0.07 < v/c < 0.98$. In spite of this uncertainty, compact jets are\noften unified with relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. We have\nestimated $v$ as part of a temporal analysis of GRS~1915+105 jets in \"high\nplateau states\" (HPS). We define the HPS as a state showing a hard X-ray\nspectrum and low level of long-term ($>10$s) X-ray activity associated with 15\nGHz flux density $>70$ mJy for $>7$ consecutive days. The radio emission is\nassociated with compact jet emission. Two HPS were monitored at 15 GHz during\ntheir termination with e-folding times of 3.8 hrs and 8.6 hrs. We combine this\ntime scale with the scale of spatial variation of the linear source of a VLBA\nimage preceding the fade of one of these HPS in order to estimate the jet\nspeed. Our assumption that the reduction in radio emissivity propagates as an\napproximate discontinuity down the HPS jet (leaving a weak jet in its wake)\nindicates $0.17 <v/c< 0.43$. This agrees closely with the only other existing\n$v$ estimates that are derived directly from radio images, jet asymmetry\nproduced by Doppler enhancement.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of gaseous clumps formed via gravitational\nfragmentation in young protostellar disks, focusing on the fragments that are\nejected from the disk via many-body gravitational interaction. Numerical\nhydrodynamics simulations were employed to study the evolution of young\nprotostellar disks formed from the collapse of rotating pre-stellar cores with\nmass in the 1.1-1.6 M_sun range. Protostellar disks formed in our models\nundergo gravitational fragmentation driven by continuing mass loading from\nparental collapsing cores. A few fragments can be ejected from the disk during\nthe early evolution, but the low-mass fragments (< 15~M_Jup) disperse creating\nspectacular bow-type structures while passing through the disk and collapsing\ncore. The least massive fragment that survived the ejection (21 M_Jup)\nstraddles the planetary-mass limit, while the most massive ejected fragments\n(145 M_Jup) can break up into several pieces, leading to the ejection of wide\nseparation binary clumps in the brown-dwarf mass range. About half of the\nejected fragments are gravitationally bound, the majority is supported by\nrotation against gravity, and all fragments have the specific angular momentum\nthat is much higher than that expected for brown dwarfs. We found that the\ninternal structure of the ejected fragments is distinct from what would be\nexpected for gravitationally contracting clumps formed via cloud core\nfragmentation, which can help to differentiate their origin. The ejection of\nfragments is an important process inherent to massive protostellar disks, which\nproduces freely-floating pre-brown dwarf cores, regulates the disk and stellar\nmasses, and potentially enriches the intracluster medium with processed dust\nand complex organics.\n", "  The 4-parameter exact solution presumably describing the exterior\ngravitational field of a generic neutron star is presented in a concise\nexplicit form defined by only three potentials. In the equatorial plane, the\nmetric functions of the solution are found to be given by particularly simple\nexpressions that make them very suitable for the use in concrete applications.\nFollowing Pappas and Apostolatos, we perform a comparison of the multipole\nstructure of the solution with the multipole moments of the known physically\nrealistic Berti-Stergioulas numerical models of neutron stars to argue that the\nhyperextreme sectors of the solution are not less (but possibly even more)\nimportant for the correct description of rapidly rotating neutron stars than\nthe subextreme sector involving exclusively the black-hole constituents. We\nhave also worked out in explicit form an exact analog of the well-known\nHartle-Thorne approximate metric.\n", "  For the last few decades the study of disks around stars young and old and of\ndifferent types have progressed significantly. During the same time a\ncompletely new discipline, the study of exoplanets, planets orbiting stars\nother than our Sun, have emerged. Both these fields, which are interconnected,\nhave benefited from the development of new instrumentation, and especially by\ntelescopes and detectors deployed in space. In this chapter we are describing\nthe state of the art of such instruments and make an inventory of what is being\ncurrently developed. We also state some of the requirements of the next steps\nand what type of instruments will lead the way forward.\n", "  Motivated by the recent update on LHC searches for narrow and broad\nresonances decaying into diphotons we reconsider the possibility that the\nobserved peak in the invariant mass spectrum at M_{\\gamma \\gamma} = 750 GeV\noriginates from a closed string (possibly axionic) excitation \\varphi\n(associated with low mass scale string theory) that has a coupling with gauge\nkinetic terms. We reevaluate the production of \\varphi by photon fusion to\naccommodate recent developments on additional contributions to relativistic\nlight-light scattering. We also study the production of \\varphi via gluon\nfusion. We show that for both a narrow and a broad resonance these two initial\ntopologies can accommodate the excess of events, spanning a wide range of\nstring mass scales 7 \\alt M_s/TeV \\alt 30 that are consistent with the\nexperimental lower bound: M_s > 7 TeV, at 95% CL. We demonstrate that for the\ntwo production processes the LHC13 data is compatible with the lack of a\ndiphoton excess in LHC8 data within \\sim 1\\sigma. We also show that if the\nresonance production is dominated by gluon fusion the null results on dijet\nsearches at LHC8 further constrain the coupling strengths of \\varphi, but\nwithout altering the range of possible string mass scales.\n", "  We present the results of our monitoring program to study the long-term\nvariability of the Halpha line in high-mass X-ray binaries. We have carried out\nthe most complete optical spectroscopic study of the global properties of\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries so far with the analysis of more than 1100 spectra of\n20 sources. Our aim is to characterise the optical variability timescales and\nstudy the interaction between the neutron star and the accreting material. Our\nresults can be summarised as follows: i) we find that Be/X-ray binaries with\nnarrow orbits are more variable than systems with long orbital periods, ii) we\nshow that a Keplerian distribution of the gas particles provides a good\ndescription of the disks in Be/X-ray binaries, as it does in classical Be\nstars, iii) a decrease in the Halpha equivalent width is generally observed\nafter major X-ray outbursts, iv) we confirm that the Halpha equivalent width\ncorrelates with disk radius, v) while systems with supergiant companions\ndisplay, multi-structured profiles, most of the Be/X-ray binaries show at some\nepoch double-peak asymmetric profiles, indicating that density inhomogeneities\nis a common property in the disk of Be/X-ray binaries, vi) the profile\nvariability (V/R ratio) timescales are shorter and the Halpha equivalent width\nare smaller in Be/X-ray binaries than in isolated Be stars, and vii) we provide\nnew evidence that the disk in Be/X-ray binaries is on average denser than in\nclassical Be stars.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of Faraday rotation measure (RM) in the M87\njet at arc-second scales by using archival polarimetric VLA data at 8, 15, 22\nand 43 GHz. We resolve the structure of the RM in several knots along the jet\nfor the first time. We derive the power spectrum in the arcsecond scale jet and\nfind indications that the RM cannot be associated with a turbulent magnetic\nfield with 3D Kolmogorov spectrum. Our analysis indicates that the RM probed on\njet scales has a significant contribution of a Faraday screen associated with\nthe vicinity of the jet, in contrast with that on kiloparsec scales, typically\nassumed to be disconnected from the jet. Comparison with previous RM analyses\nsuggests that the magnetic fields giving rise to the RMs observed in jet scales\nhave different properties and are well less turbulent than these observed in\nthe lobes.\n", "  CO is widely used as a tracer of molecular gas. However, there is now\nmounting evidence that gas phase carbon is depleted in the disk around TW Hya.\nPrevious efforts to quantify this depletion have been hampered by uncertainties\nregarding the radial thermal structure in the disk. Here we present resolved\nALMA observations of 13CO 3-2, C18O 3-2, 13CO 6-5, and C18O 6-5 emission in TW\nHya, which allow us to derive radial gas temperature and gas surface density\nprofiles, as well as map the CO abundance as a function of radius. These\nobservations provide a measurement of the surface CO snowline at ~30 AU and\nshow evidence for an outer ring of CO emission centered at 53 AU, a feature\npreviously seen only in less abundant species. Further, the derived CO gas\ntemperature profile constrains the freeze-out temperature of CO in the warm\nmolecular layer to < 21 K. Combined with the previous detection of HD 1-0,\nthese data constrain the surface density of the warm H2 gas in the inner ~30\nAU. We find that CO is depleted by two orders of magnitude from R=10-60 AU,\nwith the small amount of CO returning to the gas phase inside the surface CO\nsnowline insufficient to explain the overall depletion. Finally, this new data\nis used in conjunction with previous modeling of the TW Hya disk to constrain\nthe midplane CO snowline to 17-23 AU.\n", "  We consider the noncommutative space $\\mathbb{R}^3_\\theta$, a deformation of\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ for which the star product is closed for the trace functional.\nWe study one-loop IR and UV properties of the 2-point function for real and\ncomplex noncommutative scalar field theories with quartic interactions and\nLaplacian on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as kinetic operator. We find that the 2-point\nfunctions for these noncommutative scalar field theories have no IR\nsingularities in the external momenta, indicating the absence of UV/IR mixing.\nWe also find that the 2-point functions are UV finite with the deformation\nparameter $\\theta$ playing the role of a natural UV cut-off. The possible\norigin of the absence of UV/IR mixing in noncommutative scalar field theories\non $\\mathbb{R}^3_\\theta$ as well as on $\\mathbb{R}^3_\\lambda $, another\ndeformation of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, is discussed.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks with non-axisymmetric structures have been observed. The\nRossby wave instability (RWI) is considered as one of the origins of the\nnon-axisymmetric structures. We perform linear stability analyses of the RWI in\nbarotropic flow using four representative types of the background flow on a\nwide parameter space. We find that the co-rotation radius is located at the\nbackground vortensity minimum with large concavity if the system is marginally\nstable to the RWI, and this allows us to check the stability against the RWI\neasily. We newly derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the onset of\nthe RWI in semi-analytic form. We discuss the applicability of the new\ncondition in realistic systems and the physical nature of the RWI.\n", "  At the extreme energies of the Large Hadron Collider, massive particles can\nbe produced at such high velocities that their hadronic decays are collimated\nand the resulting jets overlap. Deducing whether the substructure of an\nobserved jet is due to a low-mass single particle or due to multiple decay\nobjects of a massive particle is an important problem in the analysis of\ncollider data. Traditional approaches have relied on expert features designed\nto detect energy deposition patterns in the calorimeter, but the complexity of\nthe data make this task an excellent candidate for the application of machine\nlearning tools. The data collected by the detector can be treated as a\ntwo-dimensional image, lending itself to the natural application of image\nclassification techniques. In this work, we apply deep neural networks with a\nmixture of locally-connected and fully-connected nodes. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that without the aid of expert features, such networks match or\nmodestly outperform the current state-of-the-art approach for discriminating\nbetween jets from single hadronic particles and overlapping jets from pairs of\ncollimated hadronic particles, and that such performance gains persist in the\npresence of pileup interactions.\n", "  Numerical simulations of black hole hot accretion flows have shown the\nexistence of strong wind. Those works focus only on the region close to black\nhole thus it is unknown whether or where the wind production stops at large\nradii. To address this question, Bu et al. (2016) have performed hydrodynamic\n(HD) simulations by taking into account the gravitational potential of both the\nblack hole and the nuclear star clusters. The latter is assumed to be $\\propto\n\\sigma^2 \\ln(r)$, with $\\sigma$ being the velocity dispersion of stars and $r$\nbe the distance from the center of the galaxy. It was found that when the\ngravity is dominated by nuclear stars, i.e., outside of radius $R_A\\equiv\nGM_{\\rm BH}/\\sigma^2$, winds can no longer be produced. That work, however,\nneglects the magnetic field, which is believed to play a crucial dynamical role\nin the accretion and thus must be taken into account. In this paper, we revisit\nthis problem by performing magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. We confirm\nthe result of Bu et al. (2016), namely wind can't be produced at the region of\n$R>R_A$. Our result, combined with the results of Yuan et al. (2015), indicates\nthat the formula describing the mass flux of wind $\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nwind}=\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}(r/20r_s)$ can only be applied to the region where the\nblack hole potential is dominant. Here $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$ is the mass accretion\nrate at the black hole horizon and the value of $R_A$ is similar to the Bondi\nradius.\n", "  In this summary, we present the main topics of the talks presented in the\nparallel session \"Black holes - 5\" of the 14th Marcel Grossmann Meeting held in\nRome, Italy in July 2015. We first present a short review of the main\napproaches used to understand thermodynamics by using differential geometry.\nThen, we present a brief summary of each presentation, including some general\nremarks and comments.\n", "  Bardeen-Buras-G\\'{e}rard have proposed a large N$_c$ method to evaluate\nhadronic weak matrix elements to attack for instance the determination of the\n$\\Delta I= \\frac{1}{2}$-rule and $\\mathrm{Re}(\\frac{\\epsilon'}{\\epsilon})$.\nHere we test this method to the determination of the form factor parameters\n$a_+$ and $b_+$ in the decays $K^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\ell^+ \\ell^- $ and $K_S\n\\rightarrow \\pi ^0 \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. The results are encouraging: in particular\nafter a complete treatment of Vector Meson Dominance (VMD).\n", "  For decades, a wide variety of observations spanning the radio through\noptical and on to the x-ray have attempted to uncover signs of type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia) interacting with a circumstellar medium (CSM). The goal of\nthese studies is to constrain the nature of the hypothesized SN Ia mass-donor\ncompanion. A continuous CSM is typically assumed when interpreting observations\nof interaction. However, while such models have been successfully applied to\ncore-collapse SNe, the assumption of continuity may not be accurate for SNe Ia,\nas shells of CSM could be formed by pre-supernova eruptions (novae). In this\nwork, we model the interaction of SNe with a spherical, low density,\nfinite-extent CSM and create a suite of synthetic radio synchrotron light\ncurves. We find that CSM shells produce sharply peaked light curves, and\nidentify a fiducial set of models that all obey a common evolution and can be\nused to generate radio light curves for interaction with an arbitrary shell.\nThe relations obeyed by the fiducial models can be used to deduce CSM\nproperties from radio observations; we demonstrate this by applying them to the\nnon-detections of SN 2011fe and SN 2014J. Finally, we explore a multiple shell\nCSM configuration and describe its more complicated dynamics and resultant\nradio light curves.\n", "  Megahertz peaked-spectrum (MPS) sources have spectra that peak at frequencies\nbelow 1 GHz in the observer's frame and are believed to be radio-loud active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). We recently presented a new method to search for\nhigh-redshift AGN by identifying unusually compact MPS sources. In this paper,\nwe present European VLBI Network (EVN) observations of 11 MPS sources which we\nuse to determine their sizes and investigate the nature of the sources with ~10\nmas resolution. Of the 11 sources, we detect nine with the EVN. Combining the\nEVN observations with spectral and redshift information, we show that the\ndetected sources are all AGN with linear sizes smaller than 1.1 kpc and are\nlikely young. This shows that low-frequency colour-colour diagrams are an easy\nand efficient way of selecting small AGN and explains our high detection\nfraction (82%) in comparison to comparable surveys. Finally we argue that the\ndetected sources are all likely compact symmetric objects and that none of the\nsources are blazars.\n", "  The newly built second experimental area EAR2 of the n_TOF spallation neutron\nsource at CERN allows to perform (n, charged particles) experiments on\nshort-lived highly radioactive targets. This paper describes a detection\napparatus and the experimental procedure for the determination of the\ncross-section of the 7Be(n,{\\alpha}) reaction, which represents one of the\nfocal points toward the solution of the cosmological Lithium abundance problem,\nand whose only measurement, at thermal energy, dates back to 1963. The\napparently unsurmountable experimental difficulties stemming from the huge 7Be\n{\\gamma}-activity, along with the lack of a suitable neutron beam facility, had\nso far prevented further measurements. The detection system is subject to\nconsiderable radiation damage, but is capable of disentangling the rare\nreaction signals from the very high background. This newly developed setup\ncould likely be useful also to study other challenging reactions requiring the\ndetectors to be installed directly in the neutron beam.\n", "  We solve the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) equations of supercritical\naccretion flows in the presence of radiation force and outflow by using self\nsimilar solutions. Compare with the pioneer works, in this paper we consider\npower-law function for mass inflow rate as $ \\dot{M} \\propto r^{s} $. We found\nthat $ s = 1 $ when the radiative cooling term is included in the energy\nequation. Correspondingly, the effective temperature profile with respect to\nthe radius was obtained as $ T_{\\text{eff}} \\varpropto r^{-1/2} $. In addition,\nwe investigated the influence of the outflow on the dynamics of the accretion\nflow. We also calculated the continuum spectrum emitted from the disk surface\nas well as the bolometric luminosity of the accretion flow. Furthermore, our\nresults show that the advection parameter, $ f $, strongly depends on mass\ninflow rate.\n", "  We present observations of the dense molecular gas tracers HCN, HNC, and HCO+\nin the J=1-0 transition using ALMA. We supplement our datasets with previous\nobservations of CO J=1-0, which traces the total molecular gas content. We\nseparate the Antennae into 7 bright regions in which we detect emission from\nall three molecules, including the nuclei of NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, 5 super\ngiant molecular complexes in the overlap region and 2 additional bright clouds.\nWe find that the ratio of L(HCN)/L(CO), which traces the dense molecular gas\nfraction, is greater in the two nuclei (L(HCN)/L(CO) ~ 0.07 - 0.08) than in the\noverlap region (L(HCN)/L(CO) <0.05). We attribute this to an increase in\npressure due to the stellar potential within the nuclei, similar to what has\nbeen seen previously in the Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies. Furthermore,\nthe ratio of L(HNC)/L(HCN) ~ 0.3-0.4 does not vary by more than a factor of 1.5\nbetween regions. By comparing our measured ratios to PDR models including\nmechanical heating, we find that the ratio of L(HNC)/L(HCN) is consistent with\nmechanical heating contributing >= 5% - 10% of the PDR surface heating to the\ntotal heating budget. Finally, the ratio of L(HCN)/L(HCO+) varies from ~1 in\nthe nucleus of NGC 4038 down to ~0.5 in the overlap region. The lower ratio in\nthe overlap region may be due to an increase in the cosmic ray rate from the\nincreased supernova rate within this region.\n", "  By using a well established 'ab initio' theoretical approach developed in the\npast to quantitatively study the superconductivity of condensed matter systems,\nwhich is based on the Kohn-Sham Density Functional theory, I study the\nsuperfluid properties and the BCS-BEC crossover of two parallel bi-dimensional\nlayers of fermionic dipolar molecules, where the pairing mechanism leading to\nsuperfluidity is provided by the inter-layer coupling between dipoles. The\nfinite temperature superfluid properties of both the homogeneous system and one\nwere the fermions in each layer are confined by a square optical lattice are\nstudied at half filling conditions, and for different values of the strength of\nthe confining optical potential. The T=0 results for the homogeneous system are\nfound to be in excellent agreement with Diffusion Monte Carlo results. The\nsuperfluid transition temperature in the BCS region is found to increase, for a\ngiven inter-layer coupling, with the strength of the confining optical\npotential. A transition occurs at sufficiently small interlayer distances,\nwhere the fermions becomes localized within the optical lattice sites in a\nsquare geometry with an increased effective lattice constant, forming a system\nof localized composite bosons. This transition should be signalled by a sudden\ndrop in the superfluid fraction of the system.\n", "  We present results from the first global 3D MHD simulations of accretion\ndisks in Cataclysmic Variable (CV) systems in order to investigate the relative\nimportance of angular momentum transport via turbulence driven by the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) compared to that driven by spiral shock\nwaves. Remarkably, we find that even with vigorous MRI turbulence, spiral\nshocks are an important component to the overall angular momentum budget, at\nleast when temperatures in the disk are high (so that Mach numbers are low). In\norder to understand the excitation, propagation, and damping of spiral density\nwaves in our simulations more carefully, we perform a series of 2D global\nhydrodynamical simulations with various equation of states and both with and\nwithout mass inflow via the Lagrangian point (L1). Compared with previous\nsimilar studies, we find the following new results. 1) Linear wave dispersion\nrelation fits the pitch angles of spiral density waves very well. 2) We\ndemonstrate explicitly that mass accretion is driven by the deposition of\nnegative angular momentum carried by the waves when they dissipate in shocks.\n3) Using Reynolds stress scaled by gas pressure to represent the effective\nangular momentum transport rate alpha_{eff} is not accurate when mass accretion\nis driven by non-axisymmetric shocks. 4) Using the mass accretion rate measured\nin our simulations to directly measure alpha defined in standard thin-disk\ntheory, we find 0.02 < alpha_{eff} < 0.05 for CV disks, consistent with\nobserved values in quiescent states of dwarf novae (DNe). In this regime the\ndisk may be too cool and neutral for the MRI to operate and spiral shocks are a\npossible accretion mechanism. However, we caution that our simulations use\nunrealistically low Mach numbers in this regime, and therefore future models\nwith more realistic thermodynamics and non-ideal MHD are warranted.\n", "  By lowering their energy threshold direct dark matter searches can reach the\nneutrino floor with experimental technology now in development. The 7Be flux\ncan be detected with $\\sim 10$ eV nuclear recoil energy threshold and 50 kg-yr\nexposure. The pep flux can be detected with $\\sim 3$ ton-yr exposure, and the\nfirst detection of the CNO flux is possible with similar exposure. The pp flux\ncan be detected with threshold of $\\sim$ eV and only $\\sim$ kg-yr exposure.\nThese can be the first pure neutral current measurements of the low-energy\nsolar neutrino flux. Measuring this flux is important for low mass dark matter\nsearches and for understanding the solar interior.\n", "  A solution to the sign problem is the so-called \"Lefschetz thimble approach\"\nwhere the domain of integration for field variables in the path integral is\ndeformed from the real axis to a sub-manifold in the complex space. For\nproperly chosen sub-manifolds (\"thimbles\") the sign problem disappears or is\ndrastically alleviated. The parametrization of the thimble by real coordinates\nrequire the calculation of a jacobian with a computational cost of order\nO(V^3), where V is proportional to the spacetime volume. In this note we\npropose two estimators for this jacobian with a computational cost of order\nO(V). We discuss analytically the regimes where we expect the estimator to work\nand show numerical examples in two different models.\n", "  Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are associated with the deaths of massive stars\nand could thus be a potentially powerful tool to trace cosmic star formation.\nHowever, especially at low redshifts (z < 1.5) LGRBs seem to prefer particular\ntypes of environment. Our aim is to study the host galaxies of a complete\nsample of bright LGRBs to investigate the impact of the environment on GRB\nformation. We study host galaxy spectra of the Swift/BAT6 complete sample of 14\nz < 1 bright LGRBs. We use the detected nebular emission lines to measure the\ndust extinction, star formation rate (SFR) and nebular metallicity (Z) of the\nhosts and supplement the data set with previously measured stellar masses\nM$_{\\star}$. The distributions of the obtained properties and their\ninterrelations (e.g. mass-metallicity and SFR-M$_{\\star}$ relations) are\ncompared to samples of field star-forming galaxies.We find that LGRB hosts at z\n< 1 have on average lower SFRs than if they were direct star-formation tracers.\nBy directly comparing metallicity distributions of LGRB hosts and star-forming\ngalaxies, we find a good match between the two populations up to Z $\\sim\n8.4-8.5$, after which the paucity of metal-rich LGRB hosts becomes apparent.\nThe LGRB host galaxies of our complete sample are not inconsistent with the\nmass-metallicity relation at similar mean redshift and stellar masses. The\ncutoff against high metallicities (and high masses) can explain the low SFR\nvalues of LGRB hosts. We find a hint of increased incidence of starburst\ngalaxies in the Swift/BAT6 z < 1 sample with respect to that of a field\nstar-forming population. Given that the SFRs are low on average, the latter is\nascribed to low stellar masses. Nevertheless the limits on the completeness and\nmetallicity availability of current surveys, coupled with the limited number of\nLGRB host galaxies, prevent us from reaching more quantitative conclusions.\n", "  We analyze radial and azimuthal variations of the phase balance between the\nmolecular and atomic ISM in the Milky Way. In particular, the azimuthal\nvariations -- between spiral arm and interarm regions -- are analyzed without\nany explicit definition of spiral arm locations. We show that the molecular gas\nmass fraction, i.e., fmol=H2/ (HI+H2) in mass, varies predominantly in the\nradial direction: starting from ~100% at the center, remaining ~>50% (~>60%) to\nR~6kpc, and decreasing to ~10-20% (~50%) at R=8.5 kpc when averaged over the\nwhole disk thickness (in the mid plane). Azimuthal, arm-interarm variations are\nsecondary: only ~20%, in the globally molecule-dominated inner MW, but becoming\nlarger, ~40-50%, in the atom-dominated outskirts. This suggests that in the\ninner MW, the gas stays highly molecular (fmol>50%) as it goes from an interarm\nregion, into a spiral arm, and back into the next interarm region. Stellar\nfeedback does not dissociate molecules much, and the coagulation and\nfragmentation of molecular clouds dominate the evolution of the ISM at these\nradii. The trend differs in the outskirts, where the gas phase is globally\natomic (fmol<50%). The HI and H2 phases cycle through spiral arm passage there.\nThese different regimes of ISM evolution are also seen in external galaxies\n(e.g., LMC, M33, and M51). We explain the radial gradient of fmol by a simple\nflow continuity model. The effects of spiral arms on this analysis are\nillustrated in Appendix.\n", "  In this work, we present a spectroscopic study of very massive stars found\noutside the center of the massive stellar cluster NGC3603. From the analysis of\nSOAR spectroscopic data and related optical-NIR photometry, we confirm the\nexistence of several very massive stars in the periphery of NGC 3603. The first\ngroup of objects (MTT58, WR42e and RFS7) is compound by three new Galactic\nexemplars of the OIf*/WN type, all of them with probable initial masses well\nabove 100 Msun and estimated ages of about 1 Myr. Based on Goodman blue-optical\nspectrum of MTT68, we can confirm the previous finding in the NIR of the only\nother Galactic exemplar (besides HD93129A) of the O2If* type known to date.\nBased on its position relative to a set of theoretical isochrons in a\nHertzprung-Russel diagram, we concluded that the new O2If* star could be one of\nthe most massive (150 Msun) and luminous (Mv=-7.3) O-star in the Galaxy. Also,\nanother remarkable result is the discovery of a new O2V star (MTT31) that is\nthe first exemplar of the class so far identified in the Milk Way. From its\nposition in the Hertzprung-Russel diagram it is found that this new star\nprobably had an initial mass of 80 Msun, as well as an absolute magnitude\nMv=-6.0 corresponding to a luminosity similar to other known O2V stars in the\nLMC. We also communicate the discovery of a new Galactic O3.5If* star (RFS8)\nwhich case is quite intriguing. Indeed, It is located far to the south of the\nNGC 3603 center, in apparent isolation at a large radial projected linear\ndistance of 62 pc. Its derived luminosity is similar to that of the other\nO3.5If* (Sh18) found in the NGC 3603's innermost region. The fact that a such\nhigh mass star is observed far isolated in the field led us to speculate that\nperhaps it could have been expelled from the innermost parts of the complex by\na close fly-by dynamical encounter with a very massive hard binary system.\n", "  We observed the first-ever recorded outburst of PM J03338+3320, the\ncataclysmic variable selected by proper-motion survey. The outburst was\ncomposed of a precursor and the main superoutburst. The precursor outburst\noccurred at least 5 d before the maximum of the main superoutburst. Despite\nthis separation, long-period superhumps were continuously seen between the\nprecursor and main superoutburst. The period of these superhumps is longer than\nthe orbital period by 6.0(1)% and can be interpreted to reflect the dynamical\nprecession rate at the 3:1 resonance for a mass ratio of 0.172(4). These\nsuperhumps smoothly evolved into those in the main superoutburst. These\nobservations provide the clearest evidence that the 3:1 resonance is triggered\nby the precursor outburst, even if it is well separated, and the resonance\neventually causes the main superoutburst as predicted by the thermal-tidal\ninstability model. The presence of superhumps well before the superoutburst\ncannot be explained by alternative models (the enhanced mass-transfer model and\nthe pure thermal instability model) and the present observations give a clear\nsupport to the thermal-tidal instability model.\n", "  We investigate the small-scale conformity in color between bright galaxies\nand their faint companions in the Virgo cluster. Cluster member galaxies are\nspectroscopically determined using the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog (EVCC)\nand the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12). We find that the\nluminosity-weighted mean color of faint galaxies depends on the color of\nadjacent bright galaxy as well as on the cluster-scale environment\n(gravitational potential index). From this result for the entire area of the\nVirgo cluster, it is not distinguishable whether the small-scale conformity is\ngenuine or is artificially produced due to cluster-scale variation of galaxy\ncolor. To disentangle this degeneracy, we divide the Virgo cluster area into\nthree sub-areas so that the cluster-scale environmental dependence is\nminimized: A1 (central), A2 (intermediate) and A3 (outermost). We find\nconformity in color between bright galaxies and their faint companions\n(color-color slope significance S ~ 2.73 sigma and correlation coefficient cc ~\n0.50) in A2, where the cluster-scale environmental dependence is almost\nnegligible. On the other hand, the conformity is not significant or very\nmarginal (S ~ 1.75 sigma and cc ~ 0.27) in A1. The conformity is not\nsignificant either in A3 (S ~ 1.59 sigma and cc ~ 0.44), but the sample size is\ntoo small in this area. These results are consistent with a scenario in which\nthe small-scale conformity in a cluster is a vestige of infallen groups and\nthese groups lose conformity as they come closer to the cluster center.\n", "  We utilize a Bayesian approach to fit the observed mid-IR-to-submm/mm\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 WISE-selected and submm-detected,\nhyperluminous hot dust-obscured galaxies. By adopting the Torus+GB model, we\ndecompose the observed IR SEDs of Hot DOGs into torus and cold dust components.\nThe main results are: 1) Hot DOGs in our submm-detected sample are\nhyperluminous, with torus emission dominating the IR energy output. However,\ncold dust emission is non-negligible, averagely contributing ~24% of total IR\nluminosity. 2) Compared to QSO and starburst SED templates, the median SED of\nHot DOGs shows the highest luminosity ratio between mid-IR and submm at\nrest-frame, while it is very similar to that of QSOs at 10-50um suggesting that\nthe heating sources of Hot DOGs should be buried AGNs. 3) Hot DOGs have both\nhigh dust temperatures ~73K and IR luminosity of cold dust. The T-L relation of\nHot DOGs suggests that the increase in IR luminosity for Hot DOGs is mostly due\nto the increase of the dust temperature, rather than dust mass. Hot DOGs have\nlower dust masses than those of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs within\nthe similar redshift range. Both high IR luminosity of cold dust and relatively\nlow dust mass in Hot DOGs can be expected by their relatively high dust\ntemperatures. 4) Hot DOGs have high dust covering factors, which deviate the\npreviously proposed trend of the dust covering factor decreasing with\nincreasing bolometric luminosity. Finally, we can reproduce the observed\nproperties in Hot DOGs by employing a physical model of galaxy evolution. The\nresult suggests that Hot DOGs may lie at or close to peaks of both star\nformation and black hole growth histories, and represent a transit phase during\nthe evolution of massive galaxies, transforming from the dusty starburst\ndominated phase to the optically bright QSO phase. (abridged)\n", "  We present the study of nineteen low X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters (L$_X\n\\sim$ 0.5--45 $\\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$), selected from the ROSAT\nPosition Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) Pointed Observations (Vikhlinin\net al. 1998) and the revised version of Mullis et al. (2003) in the redshift\nrange of 0.16 to 0.7. This is the introductory paper of a series presenting the\nsample selection, photometric and spectroscopic observations and data\nreduction. Photometric data in different passbands were taken for eight galaxy\nclusters at Las Campanas Observatory; three clusters at Cerro Tololo\nInteramerican Observatory; and eight clusters at the Gemini Observatory.\nSpectroscopic data were collected for only four galaxy clusters using Gemini\ntelescopes. With the photometry, the galaxies were defined based on the\nstar-galaxy separation taking into account photometric parameters. For each\ngalaxy cluster, the catalogues contain the PSF and aperture magnitudes of\ngalaxies within the 90\\% completeness limit. They are used together with\nstructural parameters to study the galaxy morphology and to estimate\nphotometric redshifts. With the spectroscopy, the derived galaxy velocity\ndispersion of our clusters ranged from 507 km~s$^{-1}$ for [VMF98]022 to 775\nkm~s$^{-1}$ for [VMF98]097 with signs of substructure. Cluster membership has\nbeen extensively discussed taking into account spectroscopic and photometric\nredshift estimates. In this sense, members are the galaxies within a projected\nradius of 0.75 Mpc from the X-ray mission peak and with cluster centric\nvelocities smaller than the cluster velocity dispersion or 6000 km~s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. These results will be used in forthcoming papers to study, among\nthe main topics, the red cluster sequence, blue cloud and green populations;\nthe galaxy luminosity function and cluster dynamics.\n", "  We analyze atomic structures of plasma embedded aluminum (Al) atom and its\nions in the weakly and strongly coupling regimes. The plasma screening effects\nin these atomic systems are accounted for using the Debye and ion sphere (IS)\npotentials for the weakly coupling and strongly coupling plasmas, respectively.\nWithin the Debye model, special attention is given to investigate the spherical\nand non-spherical plasma-screening effects considering in the electron-electron\ninteraction potential. The relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) method has been\nemployed to describe the relativistic and electronic correlation effects in the\nabove atomic systems. The variation in the ionization potentials (IPs) and\nexcitation energies (EEs) of the plasma embedded Al ions are presented. It is\nfound that the atomic systems exhibit more stability when the exact screening\neffects are taken into account. It is also showed that in the presence of\nstrongly coupled plasma environment, the highly ionized Al ions show blue and\nred shifts in the spectral lines of the transitions between the states with\nsame and different principal quantum numbers, respectively. Comparison among\nthe results obtained from the Debye and IS models are also carried out\nconsidering similar plasma conditions.\n", "  We present newly obtained X-ray and radio observations of Tycho's supernova\nremnant using {\\it Chandra} and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 2015 and\n2013/14, respectively. When combined with earlier epoch observations by these\ninstruments, we now have time baselines for expansion measurements of the\nremnant of 12-15 year in the X-rays and 30 year in the radio. The remnant's\nlarge angular size allows for proper motion measurements at many locations\naround the periphery of the blast wave. We find, consistent with earlier\nmeasurements, a clear gradient in the expansion velocity of the remnant,\ndespite its round shape. The proper motions on the western and southwestern\nsides of the remnant are about a factor of two higher than those in the east\nand northeast. We showed in an earlier work that this is related to an offset\nof the explosion site from the geometric center of the remnant due to a density\ngradient in the ISM, and using our refined measurements reported here, we find\nthat this offset is $\\sim 23\"$ towards the northeast. An explosion center\noffset in such a circular remnant has implications for searches for progenitor\ncompanions in other remnants.\n", "  We present photometry of the intermediate polar FO Aquarii obtained as part\nof the K2 mission using the Kepler space telescope. The amplitude spectrum of\nthe data confirms the orbital period of 4.8508(4) h, and the shape of the light\ncurve is consistent with the outer edge of the accretion disk being eclipsed\nwhen folded on this period. The average flux of FO Aquarii changed during the\nobservations, suggesting a change in the mass accretion rate. There is no\nevidence in the amplitude spectrum of a longer period that would suggest disk\nprecession. The amplitude spectrum also shows the white dwarf spin period of\n1254.3401(4) s, the beat period of 1351.329(2) s, and 31 other spin and orbital\nharmonics. The detected period is longer than the last reported period of\n1254.284(16) s, suggesting that FO Aqr is now spinning down, and has a positive\n$\\dot{P}$. There is no detectable variation in the spin period over the course\nof the K2 observations, but the phase of the spin cycle is correlated with the\nsystem brightness. We also find the amplitude of the beat signal is correlated\nwith the system brightness.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are the most recent, gravitationally-bound products of the\nhierarchical mass accretion over cosmological scales. How the mass is\nconcentrated is predicted to correlate with the total mass in the cluster's\nhalo, with systems at higher mass being less concentrated at given redshift and\nfor any given mass, systems with lower concentration are found at higher\nredshifts. Through a spatial and spectral X-ray analysis, we reconstruct the\ntotal mass profile of 47 galaxy clusters observed with Chandra in the redshift\nrange $0.4<z<1.2$, selected to have no major mergers, to investigate the\nrelation between the mass and the dark matter concentration, and the evolution\nof this relation with redshift. The sample in exam is the largest one\ninvestigated so far at $z>0.4$, and is well suited to provide the first\nconstraint on the concentration--mass relation at $z>0.7$ from X-ray analysis.\nUnder the assumptions that the distribution of the X-ray emitting gas is\nspherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium, we combine the\ndeprojected gas density and spectral temperature profiles through the\nhydrostatic equilibrium equation to recover the parameters that describe a NFW\ntotal mass distribution. The comparison with results from weak lensing analysis\nreveals a very good agreement both for masses and concentrations. Uncertainties\nare however too large to make any robust conclusion on the hydrostatic bias of\nthese systems. The relation is well described by the form $c \\propto M^B\n(1+z)^C$, with $B=-0.50 \\pm 0.20$, $C=0.12 \\pm 0.61$ (at 68.3\\% confidence), it\nis slightly steeper than the one predicted by numerical simulations\n($B\\sim-0.1$) and does not show any evident redshift evolution. We obtain the\nfirst constraints on the properties of the concentration--mass relation at $z >\n0.7$ from X-ray data, showing a reasonable good agreement with recent numerical\npredictions.\n", "  We search for meridional variation in the abundance of CH$_3$D relative to\nCH$_4$ on Titan using near-IR spectra obtained with NIRSPAO at Keck, which have\na photon-limited signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim$50. Our observations can rule\nout a larger than 10% variation in the column of CH$_3$D below 50 km. The\npreferential condensation of the heavy isotopologues will fractionate methane\nby reducing CH$_3$D in the remaining vapor, and therefore these observations\nplace limits on the amount of condensation that occurs in the troposphere.\nWhile previous estimates of CH$_3$D fractionation on Titan have estimated an\nupper limit of -6 per mil, assuming a solid condensate, we consider more recent\nlaboratory data for the equilibrium fractionation over liquid methane, and use\na Rayleigh distillation model to calculate fractionation in an ascending parcel\nof air that is following a moist adiabat. We find that deep, precipitating\nconvection can enhance the fractionation of the remaining methane vapor by -10\nto -40 per mil, depending on the final temperature of the rising parcel. By\nrelating fractionation of our reference parcel model to the pressure level\nwhere the moist adiabat achieves the required temperature, we argue that the\nmeasured methane fractionation constrains the outflow level for a deep\nconvective event. Observations with a factor of at least 4 to 6 times larger\nsignal-to-noise are required to detect this amount of fractionation, depending\non the altitude range over which the outflow from deep convection occurs.\n", "  The spiral arms of the Milky Way are being accurately located for the first\ntime via trigonometric parallaxes of massive star forming regions with the\nBeSSeL Survey, using the Very Long Baseline Array and the European VLBI\nNetwork, and with the Japanese VERA project. Here we describe a computer\nprogram that leverages these results to significantly improve the accuracy and\nreliability of distance estimates to other sources that are known to follow\nspiral structure. Using a Bayesian approach, sources are assigned to arms based\non their (l,b,v) coordinates with respect to arm signatures seen in CO and HI\nsurveys. A source's kinematic distance, displacement from the plane, and\nproximity to individual parallax sources are also considered in generating a\nfull distance probability density function. Using this program to estimate\ndistances to large numbers of star forming regions, we generate a realistic\nvisualization of the Milky Way's spiral structure as seen from the northern\nhemisphere.\n", "  In an optical color-magnitude diagram sub-subgiants (SSGs) lie red of the\nmain sequence and fainter than the base of the red giant branch in a region not\neasily populated by standard stellar-evolution pathways. In this paper, we\npresent multi-epoch radial velocities for five SSG candidates in the old and\nmetal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 (8 Gyr, [Fe/H] = +0.30). From these data we\nare able to make three-dimensional kinematic membership determinations and\nconfirm four SSG candidates to be likely cluster members. We also identify\nthree member SSGs as short-period binary systems and present their orbital\nsolutions. These are the first SSGs with known three-dimensional kinematic\nmembership, binary status, and orbital parameters since the two SSGs in M67\nstudied by Mathieu et al. 2003. We also remark on the other properties of these\nstars including photometric variability, H$\\alpha$ emission, and X-ray\nluminosity. The membership confirmation of these SSGs in NGC 6791 strengthens\nthe case that SSGs are a new class of nonstandard stellar evolution products,\nand that a physical mechanism must be found that explains the evolutionary\npaths of these stars.\n", "  The liquid-to-ordered phase transition in a bilayer system of fermions is\nstudied within the context of a recently proposed density-functional theory\n[Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 92}, 023614 (2015)]. In each two-dimensional layer, the\nfermions interact via a repulsive, isotropic dipolar interaction. The presence\nof a second layer introduces an attractive {\\em interlayer} interaction,\nthereby allowing for inhomogeneous density phases which would otherwise be\nenergetically unfavourable. For any fixed layer separation, we find an\ninstability to a commensurate one-dimensional stripe phase in each layer, which\nalways precedes the formation of a triangular Wigner crystal. However, at a\ncertain {\\em fixed} coupling, tuning the separation can lead to the system\nfavoring a commensurate triangular Wigner crystal, or one-dimensional stripe\nphase, completely bypassing the Fermi liquid state. While other crystalline\nsymmetries, with energies lower than the liquid phase can be found, they are\nnever allowed to form owing to their high energetic cost relative to the\ntriangular Wigner crystal and stripe phase.\n", "  The search for transiting habitable exoplanets has broadened to include\nseveral types of stars that are smaller than the Sun in an attempt to increase\nthe observed transit depth and hence the atmospheric signal of the planet. Of\nall spectral types, white dwarfs are the most favorable for this type of\ninvestigation. The fraction of white dwarfs that possess close-in rocky planets\nis unknown, but several large angle stellar surveys have the photometric\nprecision and cadence to discover at least one if they are common. Ultraviolet\nobservations of white dwarfs may allow for detection of molecular oxygen or\nozone in the atmosphere of a terrestrial planet. We use archival Hubble Space\nTelescope data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph to search for transiting\nrocky planets around UV-bright white dwarfs. In the process, we discovered\nunusual variability in the pulsating white dwarf GD 133, which shows slow\nsinusoidal variations in the UV. While we detect no planets around our small\nsample of targets, we do place stringent limits on the possibility of\ntransiting planets, down to sub-lunar radii. We also point out that\nnon-transiting small planets in thermal equilibrium are detectable around\nhotter white dwarfs through infrared excesses, and identify two candidates.\n", "  Accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are candidate\nhigh-frequency persistent gravitational wave sources. These may be detectable\nwith next generation interferometers such as Advanced LIGO/VIRGO within this\ndecade. However, the search sensitivity is expected to be limited principally\nby the uncertainty in the binary system parameters. We combine new optical\nspectroscopy of Cyg X-2 obtained with the Liverpool Telescope (LT) with\navailable historical radial velocity data, which gives us improved orbital\nparameter uncertainties based on a 44-year baseline. We obtained an improvement\nof a factor of 2.6 in the orbital period precision and a factor of 2 in the\nepoch of inferior conjunction T_0. The updated orbital parameters imply a mass\nfunction of 0.65 +/- 0.01 M_sun, leading to a primary mass (M_1) of 1.67 +/-\n0.22 M_sun (for i=62.5 +/- 4 deg). In addition, we estimate the likely orbital\nparameter precision through to the expected Advanced LIGO and VIRGO detector\nobserving period and quantify the corresponding improvement in sensitivity via\nthe required number of templates.\n", "  We investigate possible generalizations of the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters\nmonogamy inequality to four qubits, accounting for multipartite entanglement in\naddition to the bipartite terms. We show that the most natural extension of the\ninequality does not hold in general, and we describe the violations of this\ninequality in detail. We investigate alternative ways to extend the monogamy\ninequality to express a constraint on entanglement sharing valid for all\nfour-qubit states, and perform an extensive numerical analysis of randomly\ngenerated four-qubit states to explore the properties of such extensions.\n", "  It is shown that the renormalization group turns to be a symmetry group in a\ntheory initially formulated in a space of scale-dependent functions, i.e, those\ndepending on both the position $x$ and the resolution $a$. Such theory, earlier\ndescribed in {\\em Phys.Rev.D} 81(2010)125003, 88(2013)025015, is finite by\nconstruction. The space of scale-dependent functions $\\{ \\phi_a(x) \\}$ is more\nrelevant to physical reality than the space of square-integrable functions\n$\\mathrm{L}^2(R^d)$, because, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, what\nis really measured in any experiment is always defined in a region rather than\npoint. The effective action $\\Gamma_{(A)}$ of our theory turns to be\ncomplementary to the exact renormalization group effective action. The role of\nthe regulator is played by the basic wavelet -- an \"aperture function\" of a\nmeasuring device used to produce the snapshot of a field $\\phi$ at the point\n$x$ with the resolution $a$. The standard RG results for $\\phi^4$ model are\nreproduced.\n", "  We empirically evaluate the scheme proposed by Lieu & Duan (2013) in which\nthe light curve of a time-steady radio source is predicted to exhibit increased\nvariability on a characteristic timescale set by the sightline's electron\ncolumn density. Application to extragalactic sources is of significant appeal\nas it would enable a unique and reliable probe of cosmic baryons. We examine\ntemporal power spectra for 3C 84 observed at 1.7 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. These data\nconstrain the ratio between standard deviation and mean intensity for 3C 84 to\nless than 0.05% at temporal frequencies ranging between 0.1-200 Hz. This limit\nis 3 orders of magnitude below the variability predicted by Lieu & Duan (2013)\nand is in accord with theoretical arguments presented by Hirata & McQuinn\n(2014) rebutting electron density dependence. We identify other spectral\nfeatures in the data consistent with the slow solar wind, a coronal mass\nejection, and the ionosphere.\n", "  We present results based on X-ray, optical, and radio observations of the\nmassive galaxy cluster CIZA J0107.7+5408. We find that this system is a post\ncore passage, dissociative, binary merger, with the optical galaxy density\npeaks of each subcluster leading their associated X-ray emission peaks. This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not. This system contains double peaked diffuse radio\nemission, possibly a double radio relic with the relics lying along the merger\naxis and also leading the X-ray cores. We find evidence for a temperature peak\nassociated with the SW relic, likely created by the same merger shock that is\npowering the relic radio emission in this region. Thus, this system is a\nrelatively rare clean example of a dissociative binary merger, which can in\nprinciple be used to place constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of\ndark matter. Low frequency radio observations reveal ultra-steep spectrum\ndiffuse radio emission that is not correlated with the X-ray, optical, or high\nfrequency radio emission. We suggest that these sources are radio phoenixes,\nwhich are preexisting non-thermal particle populations that have been\nre-energized through adiabatic compression by the same merger shocks that power\nthe radio relics. Finally, we place upper limits on inverse Compton emission\nfrom the SW radio relic.\n", "  The larger center-of-mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider Run 2 opens up\nthe possibility of a more detailed study of the quartic vertices of the\nelectroweak gauge bosons. Our goal in this work is to classify all operators\npossessing quartic interactions among the electroweak gauge bosons that do not\nexhibit triple gauge-boson vertices associated to them. We obtain all relevant\noperators in the non-linear and linear realizations of the $SU(2)_L \\otimes\nU(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry.\n", "  We report ALMA observations of a one-sided, high-velocity ($\\sim$80 km\ns$^{-1}$) CO($J = 2 \\rightarrow 1$) jet powered by the intermediate-mass\nprotostellar source Serpens SMM1-a. The highly collimated molecular jet is\nflanked at the base by a wide-angle cavity; the walls of the cavity can be seen\nin both 4 cm free-free emission detected by the VLA and 1.3 mm thermal dust\nemission detected by ALMA. This is the first time that ionization of an outflow\ncavity has been directly detected via free-free emission in a very young,\nembedded Class 0 protostellar source that is still powering a molecular jet.\nThe cavity walls are ionized either by UV photons escaping from the accreting\nprotostellar source, or by the precessing molecular jet impacting the walls.\nThese observations suggest that ionized outflow cavities may be common in Class\n0 protostellar sources, shedding further light on the radiation, outflow, and\njet environments in the youngest, most embedded forming stars.\n", "  Current models suggest gamma-ray bursts could be used as a way of probing\nPopulation III stars - the first stars in the early Universe. In this paper we\nuse numerical simulations to demonstrate that late time radio observations of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows could provide a means of identifying bursts that\noriginate from Population III stars, if these were highly massive,\nindependently from their redshift. We then present the results from a pilot\nstudy using the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 17 GHz, designed to test\nthe hypothesis that there may be Population III gamma-ray bursts amongst the\ncurrent sample of known events. We observed three candidates plus a control\ngamma-ray burst, and make no detections with upper limits of 20-40 uJy at\n500-1300 days post explosion.\n", "  In recent years, omni-present transverse waves have been observed in all\nlayers of the solar atmosphere. Coronal loops are often modeled as a collection\nof individual strands, in order to explain their thermal behaviour and\nappearance. We perform 3D ideal MHD simulations to study the effect of a\ncontinuous small amplitude transverse footpoint driving on the internal\nstructure of a coronal loop composed of strands. The output is also converted\nto synthetic images, corresponding to the AIA 171 A and 193 A passbands, using\nFoMo. We show that the multi-stranded loop ceases to exist in the traditional\nsense of the word, because the plasma is efficiently mixed perpendicularly to\nthe magnetic field, with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability acting as the main\nmechanism. The final product of our simulation is mixed loop with density\nstructures on a large range of scales, resembling a power-law. Thus,\nmulti-stranded loops are unstable to driving by transverse waves, and this\nraises a strong doubt on the usability and applicability of coronal loop models\nconsisting of independent strands.\n", "  A precondition for the radio emission of pulsars is the existence of strong,\nsmall-scale magnetic field structures (`magnetic spots') in the polar cap\nregion. Their creation can proceed via crustal Hall drift out of two\nqualitatively and quantitatively different initial magnetic field\nconfigurations: a field confined completely to the crust and another which\npenetrates the whole star. The aim of this study is to explore whether these\nmagnetic structures in the crust can deform the star sufficiently to make it an\nobservable source of gravitational waves. We model the evolution of these field\nconfigurations, which can develop, within $\\sim 10^4$ -- $10^5$ yr, magnetic\nspots with local surface field strengths $\\sim 10^{14}$ G maintained over\n$\\gtrsim 10^6$ yr. Deformations caused by the magnetic forces are calculated.\nWe show that, under favourable initial conditions, a star undergoing crustal\nHall drift can have ellipticity $\\epsilon\\sim 10^{-6}$, even with sub-magnetar\npolar field strengths, after $\\sim 10^5$ yr. A pulsar rotating at $\\sim 10^2$\nHz with such $\\epsilon$ is a promising gravitational-wave source candidate.\nSince such large deformations can be caused only by a particular magnetic field\nconfiguration that penetrates the whole star and whose maximum magnetic energy\nis concentrated in the outer core region, gravitational wave emission observed\nfrom radio pulsars can thus inform us about the internal field structures of\nyoung neutron stars.\n", "  Context. Local correlation tracking of granulation (LCT) is an important\nmethod for measuring horizontal flows in the photosphere. This method exhibits\na systematic error that looks like a flow converging towards disk center, also\nknown as the shrinking-Sun effect.\n  Aims. We aim at studying the nature of the shrinking-Sun effect for continuum\nintensity data and at deriving a simple model that can explain its origin.\n  Methods. We derived LCT flow maps by running the local correlation tracking\ncode FLCT on tracked and remapped continuum intensity maps provided by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory.\nWe also computed flow maps from synthetic continuum images generated from\nSTAGGER code simulations of solar surface convection. We investigated the\norigin of the shrinking-Sun effect by generating an average granule from\nsynthetic data from the simulations.\n  Results. The LCT flow maps derived from HMI and from the simulations exhibit\na shrinking-Sun effect of comparable magnitude. The origin of this effect is\nrelated to the apparent asymmetry of granulation originating from radiative\ntransfer effects when observing with a viewing angle inclined from vertical.\nThis causes, in combination with the expansion of the granules, an apparent\nmotion towards disk center.\n", "  We report the results of our follow-up campaign of the supernova impostor PSN\nJ09132750+7627410, based on optical data covering $\\sim250\\,\\rm{d}$. From the\nbeginning, the transient shows prominent narrow Balmer lines with P-Cygni\nprofiles, with a blue-shifted absorption component becoming more prominent with\ntime. Along the $\\sim3\\,\\rm{months}$ of the spectroscopic monitoring, broad\ncomponents are never detected in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that these\nfeatures are produced in slowly expanding material. The transient reaches an\nabsolute magnitude $M_r=-13.60\\pm0.19\\,\\rm{mag}$ at maximum, a typical\nluminosity for supernova impostors. Amateur astronomers provided\n$\\sim4\\,\\rm{years}$ of archival observations of the host galaxy, NGC 2748. The\ndetection of the quiescent progenitor star in archival images obtained with the\nHubble Space Telescope suggests it to be an $18-20$\\msun white-yellow\nsupergiant.\n", "  The effect of Lorentz symmetry violation in the phenomenon of photon\ngravitational bending, is investigated. Using a semiclassical approach, where\nthe photon is described by the Carrol-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) electrodynamics which\nis responsible for implementing the Lorentz symmetry violation, the\ngravitational deflection angle related to the CFJ photon is computed. As\nexpected, this bending angle experiences a deviation from the usual Einstein\nresult and the latter is recovered in the appropriate limit. A comparison\nbetween the theoretical prediction and the experimental results allows to\nconclude that no trace of Lorentz symmetry breaking is found provided the\ncomponents of the background vector field are $\\lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV.\n", "  We propose a compact binary model for the fast radio burst (FRB) repeaters,\nwhere the system consists of a magnetic white dwarf (WD) and a neutron star\n(NS) with strong bipolar magnetic fields. When the WD fills its Roche lobe,\nmass transfer will occur from the WD to the NS through the inner Lagrange\npoint. The accreted magnetized materials may trigger magnetic reconnection when\nthey approach the NS surface, and therefore the electrons can be accelerated to\nan ultra-relativistic speed. In this scenario, the curvature radiation of the\nelectrons moving along the NS magnetic field lines can account for the\ncharacteristic frequency and the timescale of an FRB. Owing to the conservation\nof angular momentum, the WD may be kicked away after a burst, and the next\nburst may appear when the system becomes semi-detached again through the\ngravitational radiation. By comparing our analyses with the observations, we\nshow that such an intermittent Roche lobe overflow mechanism can be responsible\nfor the observed repeating behavior of FRB 121102.\n", "  We study a class of realizations of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model that is motivated by dark matter and Higgs data, and in which\nthe lightest pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass is smaller than twice the bottom\nquark mass and greater than twice the tau lepton mass. In such scenarios, the\nlightest pseudoscalar Higgs boson can be copiously produced at the LHC from the\ndecay of heavier superpartners and will dominantly further decay into a pair of\ntau leptons that is generally boosted. We make use of a boosted object tagging\ntechnique designed to tag such a ditau jet, and estimate the sensitivity of the\nLHC to the considered supersymmetric scenarios with 20 to 50~fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV.\n", "  In the density wave theory of spiral structure, the grand-design two-armed\nspiral pattern is taken to rotate rigidly in a galactic disc with a constant,\ndefinite pattern speed. The observational measurement of the pattern speed of\nthe spiral arms, though difficult, has been achieved in a few galaxies such as\nNGC 6946, NGC 2997, and M 51 which we consider here. We examine whether the\ntheoretical dispersion relation permits a real solution for wavenumber\ncorresponding to a stable wave, for the observed rotation curve and the pattern\nspeed values. We find that the disc when treated to consist of stars alone, as\nis usually done in literature, does not generally support a stable density wave\nfor the observed pattern speed. Instead the inclusion of the low velocity\ndispersion component, namely, gas, is essential to obtain a stable density\nwave. Further, we obtain a theoretical range of allowed pattern speeds that\ncorrespond to a stable density wave at a certain radius, and check that for the\nthree galaxies considered, the observed pattern speeds fall in the respective\nprescribed range. The inclusion of even a small amount (~ 15 %) of gas by mass\nfraction in the galactic disc is shown to have a significant dynamical effect\non the dispersion relation and hence on the pattern speed that is likely to be\nseen in a real, gas-rich spiral galaxy.\n", "  Surface flux transport simulations for the descending phase of cycle 24 using\nrandom sources (emerging bipolar magnetic regions) with empirically determined\nscatter of their properties provide a prediction of the axial dipole moment\nduring the upcoming activity minimum together with a realistic uncertainty\nrange. The expectation value for the dipole moment around 2020 $(2.5\\pm1.1\\,$G)\nis comparable to that observed at the end of cycle 23 (about $2\\,$G). The\nempirical correlation between the dipole moment during solar minimum and the\nstrength of the subsequent cycle thus suggests that cycle 25 will be of\nmoderate amplitude, not much higher than that of the current cycle. However,\nthe intrinsic uncertainty of such predictions resulting from the random scatter\nof the source properties is considerable and fundamentally limits the\nreliability with which such predictions can be made before activity minimum is\nreached.\n", "  We report on Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and multi-wavelength results on\nthe recently-discovered very-high-energy (VHE, $E>$ 100 GeV) blazar S4 0954+65\n($z=0.368$) during an exceptionally bright optical flare in 2015 February.\nDuring the time period (2015 February, 13/14, or MJD 57067) when the MAGIC\ntelescope detected VHE $\\gamma$-ray emission from the source, the Fermi-LAT\ndata indicated a significant spectral hardening at GeV energies, with a\npower-law photon index of $1.8 \\pm 0.1$---compared with the 3FGL value\n(averaged over four years of observation) of $2.34 \\pm 0.04$. In contrast,\nSwift/XRT data showed a softening of the X-ray spectrum, with a photon index of\n$1.72 \\pm 0.08$ (compared with $1.38 \\pm 0.03$ averaged during the flare from\nMJD 57066 to 57077), possibly indicating a modest contribution of synchrotron\nphotons by the highest-energy electrons superposed on the inverse Compton\ncomponent. Fitting of the quasi-simultaneous ($<1$ day) broadband spectrum with\na one-zone synchrotron plus inverse-Compton model revealed that GeV/TeV\nemission could be produced by inverse-Compton scattering of external photons\nfrom the dust torus. We emphasize that a flaring blazar showing high flux of\n$\\gtrsim 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($E>$ 100 MeV) and a\nhard spectral index of $\\Gamma_{\\rm GeV} < 2.0$ detected by Fermi-LAT on daily\ntime scales is a promising target for TeV follow-up by ground-based Cherenkov\ntelescopes to discover high-redshift blazars, investigate their temporal\nvariability and spectral features in the VHE band, and also constrain the\nintensity of the extragalactic background light.\n", "  The Earth's albedo is a fundamental climate parameter for understanding the\nradiation budget of the atmosphere. It has been traditionally measured from\nspace platforms, but also from the ground for sixteen years from Big Bear Solar\nObservatory by observing the Moon. The photometric ratio of the dark\n(earthshine) to the bright (moonshine) sides of the Moon is used to determine\nnightly anomalies in the terrestrial albedo, with the aim is of quantifying\nsustained monthly, annual and/or decadal changes. We find two modest decadal\nscale cycles in the albedo, but with no significant net change over the sixteen\nyears of accumulated data. Within the evolution of the two cycles, we find\nperiods of sustained annual increases, followed by comparable sustained\ndecreases in albedo. The evolution of the earthshine albedo is in remarkable\nagreement with that from the CERES instruments, although each method measures\ndifferent slices of the Earth's Bond albedo.\n", "  Cement mineral tobermorite was formed in hydrothermal experiments on\nalternation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in carbonaceous\nchondrite meteorites. Unidentified bands at 14 microns were measured for CAIs\nand the matrix of the Allende meteorite sample, as well as for Hektor and\nAgamemnon asteroids. The presence of cement nanoparticles may explain the\nfeature at 14 microns.\n", "  Characterizing the atmospheres of extrasolar planets is the new frontier in\nexoplanetary science. The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have\nrevealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital\nand bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the\nchemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and\ntheir formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to\nunprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of\nexoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these\ndevelopments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric\nchemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly\nirradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant\nplanets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational\ndetections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various\ntypes using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, doppler\nspectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we\ndiscuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres\nand how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation\nconditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work\non the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future\noutlook of the field.\n", "  Gauge theories, while describing fundamental interactions in nature, also\nemerge in a wide variety of physical systems. Abelian gauge fields have been\npredicted and observed in a number of novel quantum many-body systems,\ntopological insulators, ultracold atoms and many others. However, the\nnon-abelian gauge field, while playing the most fundamental role in particle\nphysics, up to now has remained a purely theoretical construction in many-body\nphysics. In the present paper we report the first observation of a non-abelian\ngauge field in a spin-orbit coupled quantum system. The gauge field manifests\nitself in quantum magnetic oscillations of a hole doped two-dimensional (2D)\nGaAs heterostructure. Transport measurements were performed in tilted magnetic\nfields, where the effect of the emergent non-abelian gauge field was controlled\nby the components of the magnetic field in the 2D plane.\n", "  The Planet Nine hypothesis has now enough constraints to deserve further\nattention in the form of detailed numerical experiments. The results of such\nstudies can help us improve our understanding of the dynamical effects of such\na hypothetical object on the extreme trans-Neptunian objects or ETNOs and\nperhaps provide additional constraints on the orbit of Planet Nine itself.\nHere, we present the results of direct N-body calculations including the latest\ndata available on the Planet Nine conjecture. The present-day orbits of the six\nETNOs originally linked to the hypothesis are evolved backwards in time and\ninto the future under some plausible incarnations of the hypothesis to\ninvestigate if the values of several orbital elements, including the argument\nof perihelion, remain confined to relatively narrow ranges. We find that a\nnominal Planet Nine can keep the orbits of (90377) Sedna and 2012 VP113\nrelatively well confined in orbital parameter space for hundreds of Myr, but it\nmay make the orbits of 2004 VN112, 2007 TG422 and 2013 RF98 very unstable on\ntime-scales of dozens of Myr, turning them retrograde and eventually triggering\ntheir ejection from the Solar system. Far more stable orbital evolution is\nfound with slightly modified orbits for Planet Nine.\n", "  Disequilibrium species have been used previously to probe the deep water\nabundances and the eddy diffusion coefficient for giant planets. In this paper,\nwe present a diffusion-kinetics code that predicts the abundances of\ndisequilibrium species in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn with updated\nthermodynamic and kinetic data. The dependence on the deep water abundance and\nthe eddy diffusion coefficient is investigated. We quantified the disagreements\nin CO kinetics that comes from using different reaction networks and identified\nC$_2$H$_6$ as a useful tracer for the eddy diffusion coefficient. We first\napply a H/P/O reaction network to Jupiter and Saturn's atmospheres and suggest\na new PH$_3$ destruction pathway. New chemical pathways for SiH$_4$ and GeH$_4$\ndestruction are also suggested, and another AsH$_3$ destruction pathway is\ninvestigated thanks to new thermodynamic and kinetic data. These new models\nshould enhance the interpretation of the measurement of disequilibrium species\nby JIRAM on board Juno and allow disentangling between methods for constraining\nthe Saturn's deep water abundance with the Saturn entry probes envisaged by\nNASA or ESA.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering study on the spin-chain compound Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$\nreveals gapped quasi-1D magnetic excitations. The observed one-magnon band\nbetween 29.5 and 39 meV consists of magnon modes of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions. The\nfitting of the spin wave spectrum reveals strongly coupled Ising-like chains\nalong the $c$-axis that are weakly coupled into a frustrated triangular lattice\nin the $ab$-plane. The magnetic excitations survive up to 200 K well above the\nmagnetic ordering temperature of $T_N \\sim 75$ K, also indicating a quasi-1D\nnature of the magnetic interactions in Sr$_3$NiIrO$_6$. Our microscopic model\nis in good agreement with ab initio electronic structure calculations and\nexplains the giant spin flip field observed in bulk magnetization measurements.\n", "  The high-order cumulants of conserved charges are suggested to be sensitive\nobservables to search for the critical point of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\nThis has been calculated to the sixth order in experiments. Corresponding\ntheoretical studies on the sixth order cumulant are necessary. Based on the\nuniversality of the critical behavior, we study the temperature dependence of\nthe sixth order cumulant of the order parameter using the parametric\nrepresentation of the three-dimensional Ising model, which is expected to be in\nthe same universality class as QCD. The density plot of the sign of the sixth\norder cumulant is shown on the temperature and external magnetic field plane.\nWe found that at non-zero external magnetic field, when the critical point is\napproached from the crossover side, the sixth order cumulant has a negative\nvalley. The width of the negative valley narrows with decreasing external\nfield. Qualitatively, the trend is similar to the result of Monte Carlo\nsimulation on a finite-size system. Quantitatively, the temperature of the sign\nchange is different. Through Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model, we\ncalculated the sixth order cumulant of different sizes of systems. We discuss\nthe finite-size effects on the temperature at which the cumulant changes sign.\n", "  The activity of the Quadrantids in January during several years (2008, 2010,\n2011 and 2012) has been investigated in the framework of the SPanish Meteor\nNetwork (SPMN). For this purpose, an array of high-sensitivity CCD video\ndevices and CCD all-sky cameras have been used to obtain multi-station\nobservations of these meteors. These allowed us to obtain precise radiant and\norbital information about this meteoroid stream. This paper presents a large\nset of orbital data (namely, 85 orbits) of Quadrantid meteoroids. Most meteors\nproduced by these particles were recorded during the activity peak of this\nshower. Besides, we discuss four Quadrantid emission spectra. The tensile\nstrength of Quadrantid meteoroids has been also obtained.\n", "  We investigate the holographic description of a superconductor constructed in\nthe (2+1)-dimensional AdS soliton background in the probe limit. We study the\nholographic properties through both analytical and numerical methods. With\nanalytical methods, we are the first to obtain the exact formula for critical\nphase transition points as $\\mu_{c}=1+\\sqrt{1+m^2}$. Around the transition\npoints, we find a correspondence between the value of the scalar field at the\ntip and the scalar operator at infinity. We also generalize the front\nproperties to holographic models in higher dimensional AdS soliton spacetime.\nMoreover, we examine effects of the scalar mass on stability of phase\ntransitions with numerical methods. With $m^{2}\\in (-0.38,0]$, we arrive at the\nclassical second order insulator/superconductor phase transition. Surprisingly,\nthere is no stable superconducting phases in cases of $m^{2}\\in (-1,-0.38]$. In\nother words, superconductor only exists in a certain range of the scalar mass\nin the (2+1)-dimensional AdS soliton spacetime, which is very different from\nproperties in other spacetime.\n", "  Using a set of first-principles calculations, we studied the electronic\nstructures of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, so called\nMXenes, functionalized with F, O, and OH. Our projected band structures and\nelectron localization function analyses reveal the existence of nearly free\nelectron (NFE) states in variety of MXenes. The NFE states are spatially\nlocated just outside the atomic structure of MXenes and are extended parallel\nto the surfaces. Moreover, we found that the OH-terminated MXenes offer the NFE\nstates energetically close to the Fermi level. In particular, the NFE states in\nsome of the OH-terminated MXenes, such as Ti2C(OH)2, Zr2C(OH)2, Zr2N(OH)2,\nHf2C(OH)2, Hf2N(OH)2, Nb2C(OH)2, and Ta2C(OH)2, are partially occupied. This is\nin remarkable contrast to graphene, graphane, and MoS2, in which their NFE\nstates are located far above the Fermi level and thus they are unoccupied. As a\nprototype of such systems, we investigated the electron transport properties of\nHf2C(OH)2 and found that the NFE states in Hf2C(OH)2 provide almost perfect\ntransmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. Our\nresults indicate that these systems might find applications in nanoelectronic\ndevices. Our findings provide new insights into the unique electronic band\nstructures of MXenes.\n", "  The growing body of observational data on extrasolar planets and\nprotoplanetary disks has stimulated intense research on planet formation and\nevolution in the past few years. The extremely diverse, sometimes unexpected\nphysical and orbital characteristics of exoplanets lead to frequent updates on\nthe mainstream scenarios for planet formation and evolution, but also to the\nexploration of alternative avenues. The aim of this review is to bring together\nclassical pictures and new ideas on the formation, orbital and internal\nevolutions of planets, highlighting the key role of the protoplanetary disk in\nthe various parts of the theory. We begin by briefly reviewing the conventional\nmechanism of core accretion by the growth of planetesimals, and discuss a\nrelatively recent model of core growth through the accretion of pebbles. We\nreview the basic physics of planet-disk interactions, recent progress in this\narea, and discuss their role in observed planetary systems. We address the most\nimportant effects of planets internal evolution, like cooling and contraction,\nthe mass-luminosity relation, and the bulk composition expressed in the\nmass-radius and mass-mean density relations.\n", "  We study the decay constants ($f_M$) of the heavy vector ($D^{*}$,\n$D^{*}_{s}$, $B^{*}$, $B^{*}_{s}$, $B^{*}_{c}$) and tensor ($D_{2}^{*}$,\n$D_{s2}^{*}$, $B^{*}_{2}$, $B^{*}_{s2}$) mesons in the light front quark model.\nWith the known pseudoscalar meson decay constants of $f_D$, $f_{D_s}$, $f_B$,\n$f_{B_s}$, and $f_{B_c}$ as the input parameters to determine the light-front\nmeson wave functions, we obtain that $f_{D^{*}, D^{*}_{s},\nB^{*},B^{*}_s,B^{*}_c} = (252.0^{+13.8}_{-11.6}$, $318.3^{+15.3}_{-12.6}$ ,\n$201.9^{+43.2}_{-41.4}$, $244.2\\pm7.0$, $473.4\\pm18.2$) and\n$(264.9^{+10.2}_{-9.5}$, $330.9^{+9.9}_{-9.0}$, $220.2^{+49.1}_{-46.2}$,\n$265.7\\pm8.0$, $487.6\\pm19.2$) MeV with Gaussian and power-law wave functions,\nrespectively, while $f_{D_{2}^{*},D_{s2}^{*},B^{*}_{2},B^{*}_{s2}}$=\n($143.6^{+24.9}_{-21.8}$, $209.5^{+29.1}_{-24.2}$, $80.9^{+33.8}_{-27.7}$,\n$109.7^{+15.7}_{-15.0}$) MeV with only Gaussian wave functions.\n", "  We report the synthesis, crystal structure and characterization by means of\nsingle crystal x-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, magnetic, thermal\nand transport measurements of the new heavy fermion compounds\nCe$_{2}$MAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ (M = Co, Ir, Ni, Pd). These compounds crystallize in\na noncentrosymmetic tetragonal space group P\\={4}2$_{1}$m, consisting of layers\nof square nets of Ce atoms separated by Ge-Al and M-Al-Ge blocks.\nCe$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$, Ce$_{2}$IrAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ and\nCe$_{2}$NiAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ order magnetically behavior below $T_{M}=$ 1.8, 1.6,\nand 0.8 K, respectively. There is no evidence of magnetic ordering in\nCe$_{2}$PdAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ down to 0.4 K. The small amount of entropy released\nin the magnetic state of Ce$_{2}$MAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ (M = Co, Ir, Ni) and the\nreduced specific heat jump at $T_M$ suggest a strong Kondo interaction in these\nmaterials. Ce$_{2}$PdAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, possibly\ndue to the presence of a nearby quantum critical point.\n", "  We compute the 2- and 3-point functions of currents and primary fields of\n$\\lambda$-deformed integrable $\\sigma$-models characterized also by an integer\n$k$. Our results apply for any semisimple group $G$, for all values of the\ndeformation parameter $\\lambda$ and up to order $1/k$. We deduce the OPEs and\nequal-time commutators of all currents and primaries. We derive the currents'\nPoisson brackets which assume Rajeev's deformation of the canonical structure\nof the isotropic PCM, the underlying structure of the integrable\n$\\lambda$-deformed $\\sigma$-models. We also present analogous results in two\nlimiting cases of special interest, namely for the non-Abelian T-dual of the\nPCM and for the pseudodual model.\n", "  This is the first of a series of papers presenting the Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST)\nproject, a new comprehensive set of stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones\ncomputed using MESA, a state-of-the-art open-source 1D stellar evolution\npackage. In this work, we present models with solar-scaled abundance ratios\ncovering a wide range of ages ($5 \\leq \\rm \\log(Age)\\;[yr] \\leq 10.3$), masses\n($0.1 \\leq M/M_{\\odot} \\leq 300$), and metallicities ($-2.0 \\leq \\rm [Z/H] \\leq\n0.5$). The models are self-consistently and continuously evolved from the\npre-main sequence to the end of hydrogen burning, the white dwarf cooling\nsequence, or the end of carbon burning, depending on the initial mass. We also\nprovide a grid of models evolved from the pre-main sequence to the end of core\nhelium burning for $-4.0 \\leq \\rm [Z/H] < -2.0$. We showcase extensive\ncomparisons with observational constraints as well as with some of the most\nwidely used existing models in the literature. The evolutionary tracks and\nisochrones can be downloaded from the project website at\nhttp://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/.\n", "  Bilayer strontium ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ displays pronounced non-Fermi\nliquid behavior at magnetic fields around 8 T, applied perpendicular to the\nruthenate planes, which previously has been associated with an itinerant\nmetamagnetic quantum critical end point (QCEP). We focus on the magnetic\nGr\\\"uneisen parameter $\\Gamma_{\\rm H}$, which is the most direct probe to\ncharacterize field-induced quantum criticality. We confirm quantum critical\nscaling due to a putative two-dimensional QCEP near 7.845(5) T, which is masked\nby two ordered phases A and B, identified previously by neutron scattering. In\naddition we find evidence for a QCEP at 7.53(2) T and determine the quantum\ncritical regimes of both instabilities and the effect of their superposition.\n", "  The newly revised sunspot number series allows for placing historical\ngeoeffective storms in the context of several hundred years of solar activity.\nUsing statistical analyses of the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellites (GOES) X-ray observations from the past ~30 years and the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph\n(LASCO) Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) catalog (1996-present), we present\nsunspot-number-dependent flare and CME rates. In particular, we present X-ray\nflare rates as a function of sunspot number for the past three cycles. We also\nshow that the 1-8 AA X-ray background flux is strongly correlated with sunspot\nnumber across solar cycles. Similarly, we show that the CME properties (e.g.,\nproxies related to the CME linear speed and width) are also correlated with\nsunspot number for SC 23 and 24. These updated rates will enable future\npredictions for geoeffective events and place historical storms in the context\nof present solar activity.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous potassium nitrate solution reveal a\nhighly complex rotational dynamics of nitrate ions where, superimposed on the\nexpected continuous Brownian motion, are large amplitude angular jumps that are\ncoupled to and at least partly driven by similar large amplitude jump motions\nin water molecules which are associated with change in the hydrogen bonded\nwater molecule. These jumps contribute significantly to rotational and\ntranslational motions of these ions. We explore the detailed mechanism of these\ncorrelated (or, coupled) jumps and introduce a new time correlation function to\ndecompose the coupled orientational- jump dynamics of solvent and solute in the\naqueous electrolytic solution. Time correlation function provides for the\nunequivocal determination of the time constant involved in orientational\ndynamics originating from making and breaking of hydrogen bonds. We discover\ntwo distinct mechanisms-both are coupled to density fluctuation but are of\ndifferent types.\n", "  Recently LIGO collaboration discovered gravitational waves \\cite{Abbott_16}\npredicted 100 years ago by A. Einstein. Moreover, in the key paper reporting\nabout the discovery, the joint LIGO \\& VIRGO team presented an upper limit on\ngraviton mass such as $m_g < 1.2 \\times 10^{-22} eV$ (Abbott et al. (LIGO\ncollaboration) PRL 116 (2016) 061102). Since the graviton mass limit is so\nsmall the authors concluded that their observational data do not show\nviolations of classical general relativity. We consider another opportunity to\nevaluate a graviton mass from phenomenological consequences of massive gravity\nand show that an analysis of bright star trajectories could bound graviton mass\nwith a comparable accuracy with accuracies reached with gravitational wave\ninterferometers and expected with forthcoming pulsar timing observations for\ngravitational wave detection. It gives an opportunity to treat observations of\nbright stars near the Galactic Center as a wonderful tool not only for an\nevaluation specific parameters of the black hole but also to obtain constraints\non the fundamental gravity law such as a modifications of Newton gravity law in\na weak field approximation. In particular, we obtain bounds on a graviton mass\nbased on a potential reconstruction at the Galactic Center.\n", "  The production of $W$ and $Z$ bosons in association with jets is studied in\nthe forward region of proton-proton collisions collected at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 8 TeV by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 1.98 $\\pm$ 0.02 fb$^{-1}$. The $W$ boson is identified using its\ndecay to a muon and a neutrino, while the $Z$ boson is identified through its\ndecay to a muon pair. Total cross-sections are measured and combined into\ncharge ratios, asymmetries, and ratios of $W+$jet and $Z$+jet production\ncross-sections. Differential measurements are also performed as a function of\nboth boson and jet kinematic variables. All results are in agreement with\nStandard Model predictions.\n", "  We consider the propagation of a chiral spin-3/2 particle in a background\nmedium using the Thermal Field Theory (TFT) method, in analogy to the cases of\na spin-1/2 fermion (e.g., a neutrino) and the photon. We present a systematic\ndecomposition of the thermal self-energy, from which the dispersion relation of\nthe modes that propagate in the medium are obtained. We find that there are\nseveral modes and in each case we obtain the equation for the dispersion\nrelation as well as the corresponding spin-3/2 spinor. As an example of the\ngeneral procedure and results, we consider a model in which the chiral spin-3/2\nparticle couples to a spin-1/2 fermion and a scalar particle, and propagates in\na thermal background composed of such particles. The dispersion relations and\ncorresponding spinors are detemined explcitly in this case from the 1-loop TFT\nexpression for the self-energy. The results in this case share some resemblance\nand analogies with the photon and the chiral fermion cases but, as already\nnoted, there are also differences. The present work provides the groundwork for\nconsidering problems related to the properties of chiral spin-3/2 particles in\na medium, in analogy to the case of neutrinos for example, which can be\nrelevant in physical contexts of current interest.\n", "  We investigate the mass-radius relation of neutron star (NS) with hyperons\ninside its core by using the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of\ngravity. The equation of state of the star is calculated by using the\nrelativistic mean field model under which the standard SU(6) prescription and\nhyperons potential depths are used to determine the hyperon coupling constants.\nWe found that, for $4\\times 10^{6}~\\rm{m^2}~\\lesssim~\\kappa \\lesssim~6\\times\n10^{6}~\\rm{m^2}$, the corresponding NS mass and radius predicted by the EiBI\ntheory of gravity is compatible with observational constraints of maximum NS\nmass and radius. The corresponding $\\kappa$ value is also compatible with the\n$\\kappa$ range predicted by the astrophysical-cosmological constraints. We also\nfound that the parameter $\\kappa$ could control the size and the compactness of\na neutron star.\n", "  P\\\"oschl-Teller-driven solutions for quantum mechanical fluctuations are\ntriggered off by single scalar field theories obtained through a systematic\nperturbative procedure for generating deformed defects. The analytical\nproperties concerning the quantum fluctuations in one-dimension, zero-mode\nstates, first- and second- excited states, and energy density profiles are all\nobtained from deformed topological and non-topological structures supported by\nreal scalar fields. Results are firstly derived from an integrated $\\lambda\n\\phi^4$ theory, with corresponding generalizations applied to starting $\\lambda\n\\chi^4$ and {\\em sine}-Gordon theories. By focusing our calculations on\nstructures supported by the $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory, the outcome of our study\nsuggests an exact quantitative correspondence to P\\\"oschl-Teller-driven\nsystems. Embedded into the perturbative quantum mechanics framework, such a\ncorrespondence turns into a helpful tool for computing excited states and\ncontinuous mode solutions, as well as their associated energy spectrum, for\nquantum fluctuations of perturbatively deformed structures. Perturbative\ndeformations create distinct physical scenarios in the context of exactly\nsolvable quantum systems and may also work as an analytical support for\ndescribing novel braneworld universes embedded into a $5$-dimensional gravity\nbulks.\n", "  It has been argued that self-replicating robotic probes could spread to all\nstars of our galaxy within a timespan that is tiny on cosmological scales, even\nif they travel well below the speed of light. The apparent absence of such von\nNeumann probes in our own solar system then needs an explanation that holds for\nall possible extraterrestrial civilisations. Here I propose such a solution,\nwhich is based on a runaway error propagation that can occur in any\nself-replicating system with finite accuracy of its components. Under\nuniversally applicable assumptions (finite resources and finite lifespans) it\nfollows that an optimal probe design always leads to an error catastrophe and\nbreakdown of the probes. Thus, there might be many advanced civilizations in\nour galaxy, each surrounded by their own small sphere of self-replicating\nprobes. But unless our own solar system has the extraordinary luck to be close\nenough to one of these civilizations, none of these probes will ever reach us.\n", "  The present study provides important details on homologous eruptions of a\nsolar prominence that occurred in active region NOAA 10904 on 2006 August 22.\nWe report on the preeruptive phase of the homologous feature as well as the\nkinematics and the morphology of a forth from a series of prominence eruptions\nthat is critical in defining the nature of the previous consecutive eruptions.\nThe evolution of the overlying coronal field during homologous eruptions is\ndiscussed and a new observational criterion for homologous eruptions is\nprovided. We find a distinctive sequence of three activation periods each of\nthem containing preeruptive precursors such as a brightening and enlarging of\nthe prominence body followed by small surge- like ejections from its southern\nend observed in the radio 17 GHz. We analyse a fourth eruption that clearly\nindicates a full reformation of the prominence after the third eruption. The\nfourth eruption although occurring 11 hrs later has an identical morphology,\nthe same angle of propagation with respect to the radial direction, as well as\nsimilar kinematic evolution as the previous three eruptions. We find an\nimportant feature of the homologous eruptive prominence sequence that is the\nmaximum height increase of each consecutive eruption. The present analysis\nestablishes that all four eruptions observed in H{\\alpha} are of confined type\nwith the third eruption undergoing a thermal disappearance during its eruptive\nphase. We suggest that the observation of the same direction of the magnetic\nflux rope (MFR) ejections can be consider as an additional observational\ncriterion for MFR homology. This observational indication for homologous\neruptions is important, especially in the case of events of typical or poorly\ndistinguishable morphology of eruptive solar phenomena.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study of radiation of massive spin-2 boson\n(graviton with a nonzero mass) through the event horizon of a generic static\nand spherically symmetric black hole in (3+1) dimensions. To this end, we\nconsider the problem in the framework of quantum tunneling phenomenon. We\nevaluate the tunneling rate of the massive gravitons by applying the\nsemiclassical WKB approximation to the Fierz-Pauli equation. The temperature of\nthe radiation is obtained with the aid of the Boltzmann expression. Our\nfindings are in good agreement with the existing Hawking radiation studies in\nthe current literature.\n", "  In this work we present some new results which we have obtained in a study of\nthe phase diagram of charged compact boson stars in the theory involving\nmassive complex scalar fields coupled to the U(1) gauge field and gravity in a\nconical potential in the presence of a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ which we\ntreat as a free parameter taking positive and negative values and thereby\nallowing us to study the theory in the de Sitter and Anti de Sitter spaces\nrespectively. In our studies, we obtain four bifurcation points (possibility of\nmore bifurcation points being not ruled out) in the de Sitter region. We\npresent a detailed discussion of the various regions in our phase diagram with\nrespect to four bifurcation points. Our theory is seen to have rich physics in\na particular domain for positive values of $\\Lambda$ which is consistent with\nthe accelerated expansion of the universe.\n", "  In this paper, under natural geometric and physical assumptions we provide\nnew uniqueness and non-existence results for complete maximal hypersurfaces in\nspatially open Robertson-Walker spacetimes whose fiber is flat. Moreover, our\nresults are applied to relevant spacetimes as the steady state spacetime,\nEinstein-de Sitter spacetime and radiation models.\n", "  We report on an efficient production scheme for a large quantum degenerate\nsample of fermionic lithium. The approach is based on our previous work on\nnarrow-line $ 2S_{1/2}\\rightarrow 3P_{3/2} $ laser cooling resulting in a high\nphase-space density of up to $3\\times10^{-4}$. This allows utilizing a large\nvolume crossed optical dipole trap with a total power of $45\\,\\textrm{W}$,\nleading to high loading efficiency and $8\\times10^6$ trapped atoms. The same\noptical trapping configuration is used for rapid adiabatic transport over a\ndistance of $25\\,\\textrm{cm}$ in $0.9\\,\\textrm{s}$, and subsequent evaporative\ncooling. With optimized evaporation we achieve a degenerate Fermi gas with\n$1.7\\times 10^{6}$ atoms at a temperature of $60 \\, \\textrm{nK}$, corresponding\nto $T/T_{\\text{F}}=0.16\\left(2 \\right)$. Furthermore, the performance is\ndemonstrated by evaporation near a broad Feshbach resonance creating a\nmolecular Bose-Einstein condensate of $3\\times10^5$ lithium dimers.\n", "  We study electromagnetic properties of a double layer graphene system in\nwhich electrons from one layer are coupled with holes from the other layer. The\ngauge invariant linear response functions are obtained. The frequency\ndependences of the transmission, reflection and absorption coefficients are\ncomputed. We predict a peak in the reflection and absorption at the frequency\nequals to the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum. It is shown that the\nelectron-hole pairing results in an essential modification of the spectrum of\nsurface TM plasmons. We find that the optical TM mode splits into a low\nfrequency undamped branch and a high frequency damped branch. At zero\ntemperature the lower branch disappears. It is established that the pairing\ndoes not influence the acoustic TM mode. It is also shown that the pairing\nopens the frequency window in the subgap range for the surface TE wave.\n", "  We consider a toy model for relativistic collapse of an homogeneous perfect\nfluid that takes into account an equation of state for high density matter, in\nthe form of an Hagedorn phase, and semiclassical corrections in the strong\nfield. We show that collapse reaches a critical minimum size and then bounces.\nWe discuss the conditions for collapse to halt and form a compact object. We\nargue that implications of models such as the one presented here are of great\nimportance for astrophysics as they show that black holes may not be the only\nfinal outcome of collapse of very massive stars.\n", "  We introduce the moving mesh code Shadowfax, which can be used to evolve a\nmixture of gas, subject to the laws of hydrodynamics and gravity, and any\ncollisionless fluid only subject to gravity, such as cold dark matter or stars.\nThe code is written in C++ and its source code is made available to the\nscientific community under the GNU Affero General Public License. We outline\nthe algorithm and the design of our implementation, and demonstrate its\nvalidity through the results of a set of basic test problems, which are also\npart of the public version. We also compare Shadowfax with a number of other\npublicly available codes using different hydrodynamical integration schemes,\nillustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the moving mesh technique.\n", "  We used the Revised Flat Galaxy Catalog (RFGC) to select 817 ultra-flat (UF)\nedge-on disk galaxies with blue and red apparent axial ratios of $(a/b)_B >\n10.0$ and $(a/b)_R > 8.5$. The sample covering the whole sky, except the Milky\nWay zone, contains 490 UF galaxies with measured radial velocities. Our\ninspection of the neighboring galaxies around them revealed only 30 companions\nwith radial velocity difference of $\\mid\\Delta V\\mid<500$ km s$^{-1}$ inside\nthe projected separation of $R_p < 250$ kpc. Wherein, the wider area around the\nUF galaxy within $R_p < 750$ kpc contains no other neighbors brighter than the\nUF galaxy itself in the same velocity span. The resulting sample galaxies\nmostly belong to the morphological types Sc, Scd, Sd. They have a moderate\nrotation velocity curve amplitude of about $120$ km s$^{-1}$ and a moderate\nK-band luminosity of about $10^{10}L_{\\odot}$. The median difference of radial\nvelocities of their companions is $87$ km s$^{-1}$, yielding the median orbital\nmass estimate of about $5\\times10^{11}M_{\\odot}$. Excluding six probable\nnon-isolated pairs, we obtained a typical halo-mass-to-stellar-mass of UF\ngalaxies of about $30$, what is almost the same one as in the principal spiral\ngalaxies, like M 31 and M 81 in the nearest groups. We also note that\nultra-flat galaxies look two times less \"dusty\" than other spirals of the same\nluminosity.\n", "  We develop a novel method for multiphoton controllable transport between\nremote resonators. Specifically, an auxiliary resonator is used to control the\ncoherent long-range coupling of two spatially separated resonators, mediated by\na coupled-resonator chain of arbitrary length. In this manner, an arbitrary\nmultiphoton quantum state can be either transmitted through or reflected off\nthe intermediate chain on demand, with very high fidelity. We find, on using a\ntime-independent perturbative treatment, that quantum information leakage of an\narbitrary Fock state is limited by two upper bounds, one for the transmitted\ncase and the other for the reflected case. In principle, the two upper bounds\ncan be made arbitrarily small, which is confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  LIGO's discovery of a gravitational wave from two merging black holes (BHs)\nof similar masses rekindled suggestions that primordial BHs (PBHs) make up the\ndark matter (DM). If so, PBHs would add a Poissonian isocurvature density\nfluctuation component to the inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations.\nFor LIGO's BH parameters, this extra component would dominate the small-scale\npower responsible for collapse of early DM halos at z>10, where first luminous\nsources formed. We quantify the resultant increase in high-z abundances of\ncollapsed halos that are suitable for producing the first generation of stars\nand luminous sources. The significantly increased abundance of the early halos\nwould naturally explain the observed source-subtracted near-IR cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB) fluctuations, which cannot be accounted for by known galaxy\npopulations. For LIGO's BH parameters this increase is such that the observed\nCIB fluctuation levels at 2 to 5 micron can be produced if only a tiny fraction\nof baryons in the collapsed DM halos forms luminous sources. Gas accretion onto\nthese PBHs in collapsed halos, where first stars should also form, would\nstraightforwardly account for the observed high coherence between the CIB and\nunresolved cosmic X-ray background in soft X-rays. We discuss modifications\npossibly required in the processes of first star formation if LIGO-type BHs\nindeed make up the bulk or all of DM. The arguments are valid only if the PBHs\nmake up all, or at least most, of DM, but at the same time the mechanism\nappears inevitable if DM is made of PBHs.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations and an effective Hamiltonian analysis,\nwe systematically investigate the electronic and topological properties of\nalkaline-earth compounds $AX_2$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba; $X$=Si, Ge, Sn). Taking\nBaSn$_2$ as an example, we find that when spin-orbit coupling is ignored, these\nmaterials are three-dimensional topological nodal-line semimetals characterized\nby a snake-like nodal loop in three-dimensional momentum space. Drumhead-like\nsurface states emerge either inside or outside the loop circle on the (001)\nsurface depending on surface termination, while complicated\ndouble-drumhead-like surface states appear on the (010) surface. When\nspin-orbit coupling is included, the nodal line is gapped and the system\nbecomes a topological insulator with Z$_2$ topological invariants (1;001).\nSince spin-orbit coupling effects are weak in light elements, the nodal-line\nsemimetal phase is expected to be achievable in some alkaline-earth germanides\nand silicides.\n", "  We report a combined study of the spin resonances and superconducting gaps\nfor underdoped ($T_c=19$ K), optimally doped ($T_c=25$ K), and overdoped\n($T_c=19$ K) Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals with inelastic\nneutron scattering and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find a\nquasi two dimensional spin resonance whose energy scales with the\nsuperconducting gap in all three compounds. In addition, anisotropic low energy\nspin excitation enhancements in the superconducting state have been deduced and\ncharacterized for the under and optimally doped compounds. Our data suggest\nthat the quasi two dimensional spin resonance is a spin exciton that\ncorresponds to the spin singlet-triplet excitations of the itinerant electrons.\nHowever, the intensity enhancements of the anisotropic spin excitations are\ndominated by the out-of-plane spin excitations of the ordered moments due to\nthe suppression of damping in the superconducting state. Hence we offer a new\ninterpretation of the double energy scales differing from previous\ninterpretations based on anisotropic superconducting energy gaps, and\nsystematically explain the doping-dependent trend across the phase diagram.\n", "  As energetic particles diffuse out of radio and star-forming galaxies (SFGs),\ntheir intracluster density builds up to a level that could account for a\nsubstantial part or all the emission from a radio halo. We calculate the\nparticle time-dependent, spectro-spatial distributions from a solution of a\ndiffusion equation with radio galaxies as sources of electrons, and SFGs as\nsources of both electrons and protons. Whereas strong radio galaxies are\ntypically found in the cluster (e.g., Coma) core, the fraction of SFGs\nincreases with distance from the cluster center. Scaling particle escape rates\nfrom their sources to the reasonably well determined Galactic rates, and for\nrealistic gas density and magnetic field spatial profiles, we find that\npredicted spectra and spatial profiles of radio emission from primary and\nsecondary electrons are roughly consistent with those deduced from current\nmeasurements of the Coma halo (after subtraction of emission from the relic\nComa A). Nonthermal X-ray emission is predicted to be mostly by Compton\nscattering of electrons from radio galaxies off the CMB, whereas $\\gamma$-ray\nemission is primarily from the decay of neutral pions produced in interactions\nof protons from SFGs with protons in intracluster gas.\n", "  Within the context of ultralight BEC dark matter, we analyze the head-on\nencounters of two structures. These structures are made of a BEC component,\nwhich is a ground state equilibrium solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson\nsystem, together with a component of luminous matter. The evolution of the\nCondensate dark matter is carried out by solving the time dependent GPP\nequations, whereas the luminous matter is modeled with particles interacting\ngravitationally on top of the BEC dark matter halos. We track the evolution of\nfrontal encounters for various values of the collision velocity and analyze the\nregime of high velocity regime showing solitonic behavior of the BEC halos and\nthat of slow velocities producing a single final structure. We measure the\nrelative velocity of the dark matter with respect to the luminous matter after\nthe encounters in the solitonic case and track the evolution of luminous matter\nin the case of merger.\n", "  It has been suggested that relativistic shocks in extragalactic sources may\naccelerate the highest energy cosmic rays. The maximum energy to which cosmic\nrays can be accelerated depends on the structure of magnetic turbulence near\nthe shock but recent theoretical advances indicate that relativistic shocks are\nprobably unable to accelerate particles to energies much larger than a PeV. We\nstudy the hotspots of powerful radiogalaxies, where electrons accelerated at\nthe termination shock emit synchrotron radiation. The turnover of the\nsynchrotron spectrum is typically observed between infrared and optical\nfrequencies, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons\naccelerated at the shock is < TeV for a canonical magnetic field of ~100 micro\nGauss. Based on theoretical considerations we show that this maximum energy\ncannot be constrained by synchrotron losses as usually assumed, unless the jet\ndensity is unreasonably large and most of the jet upstream energy goes to\nnon-thermal particles. We test this result by considering a sample of hotspots\nobserved with high spatial resolution at radio, infrared and optical\nwavelengths.\n", "  An increasing number of observations have shown that gaseous debris discs are\nnot an exception. However, until now we only knew of cases around A stars. Here\nwe present the first detection of 12CO (2-1) disc emission around an F star, HD\n181327, obtained with ALMA observations at 1.3 mm. The continuum and CO\nemission are resolved into an axisymmetric disc with ring-like morphology.\nUsing a Markov chain Monte Carlo method coupled with radiative transfer\ncalculations we study the dust and CO mass distribution. We find the dust is\ndistributed in a ring with a radius of 86.0 +- 0.4 AU and a radial width of\n23.2 +- 1.0 AU. At this frequency the ring radius is smaller than in the\noptical, revealing grain size segregation expected due to radiation pressure.\nWe also report on the detection of low level continuum emission beyond the main\nring out to ~200 AU. We model the CO emission in the non-LTE regime and we find\nthat the CO is co-located with the dust, with a total CO gas mass ranging\nbetween 1.2x10^-6 Mearth and 2.9x10^-6 Mearth, depending on the gas kinetic\ntemperature and collisional partners densities. The CO densities and location\nsuggest a secondary origin, i.e. released from icy planetesimals in the ring.\nWe derive a CO+CO2 cometary composition that is consistent with Solar system\ncomets. Due to the low gas densities it is unlikely that the gas is shaping the\ndust distribution.\n", "  We have searched three Parkes multibeam 1.4 GHz surveys for the presence of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs) out to a dispersion measure (DM) of 5000 pc cm$^{-3}$.\nThese surveys originally targeted the Magellanic Clouds (in two cases) and\nunidentified gamma-ray sources at mid-Galactic latitudes (in the third case)\nfor new radio pulsars. In previous processing, none of these surveys were\nsearched to such a high DM limit. The surveys had a combined total of 719 hr of\nParkes multibeam on-sky time. One known FRB, 010724, was present in our data\nand was detected in our analysis but no new FRBs were found. After adding in\nthe on-sky Parkes time from these three surveys to the on-sky time (7512 hr)\nfrom the five Parkes surveys analysed by Rane et al., all of which have now\nbeen searched to high DM limits, we improve the constraint on the all-sky rate\nof FRBs above a fluence level of 3.8 Jy ms at 1.4 GHz to $R = 3.3^{+3.7}_{-2.2}\n\\times 10^{3}$ events per day per sky (at the 99% confidence level). Future\nParkes surveys that accumulate additional multibeam on-sky time (such as the\nongoing high-resolution Parkes survey of the LMC) can be combined with these\nresults to further constrain the all-sky FRB rate.\n", "  The usefulness and versatility of the PSRSALSA open-source pulsar\ndata-analysis project is demonstrated through an analysis of the radio pulsar\nB1839-04. This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating\nbeamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,\npossibly by distortions in the magnetic field.\n", "  Millimeter observations of CO isotopologues are often used to make inferences\nabout protoplanetary disk gas density and temperature structures. The accuracy\nof these estimates depends on our understanding of CO freezeout and desorption\nfrom dust grains. Most models of these processes indicate that CO column\ndensity decreases monotonically with distance from the central star due to a\ndecrease in gas density and freezeout beyond the CO snowline. We present ALMA\nCycle 2 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O $J=2-1$ emission\nthat instead suggest CO enhancement in the outer disk of T Tauri star AS 209.\nMost notably, the C$^{18}$O emission consists of a central peak and a ring at a\nradius of $\\sim1''$ (120 AU), well outside the expected CO snowline. We propose\nthat the ring arises from the onset of CO desorption near the edge of the\nmillimeter dust disk. CO desorption exterior to a CO snowline may occur via\nnon-thermal processes involving cosmic rays or high-energy photons, or via a\nradial thermal inversion arising from dust migration.\n", "  Titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) has rich physical properties with potential\nimplications in both fundamental physics and new applications. Up-to-date, the\nmain focus of applied research is to tune its optical properties, which is\nusually done via doping and/or nano-engineering. However, understanding the\nrole of $d$-electrons in materials and possible functionalization of\n$d$-electron properties are still major challenges. Herewith, within a\ncombination of an innovative experimental technique, high energy optical\nconductivity, and of the state-of-the-art {\\it ab initio} electronic structure\ncalculations, we report an emerging, novel resonant exciton in the deep\nultraviolet region of the optical response. The resonant exciton evolves upon\nlow concentration Ta-substitution in anatase TiO$_{2}$ films. It is\nsurprisingly robust and related to strong electron-electron and electron-hole\ninteractions. The $d$- and $f$- orbitals localization, due to Ta-substitution,\nplays an unexpected role, activating strong electronic correlations and\ndominating the optical response under photoexcitation. Our results shed light\non a new optical phenomenon in anatase TiO$_{2}$ films and on the possibility\nof tuning electronic properties by Ta substitution.\n", "  We analyze the combined effect of Poynting-Robertson and solar wind drag on\nspace debris. We derive a model within Cartesian, Gaussian and Hamiltonian\nframeworks. We focus on the geosynchronous resonance, although the results can\nbe easily generalized to any resonance. By numerical and analytical techniques,\nwe compute the drift in semi-major axis due to Poynting-Robertson and solar\nwind drag. After a linear stability analysis of the equilibria, we combine a\ncareful investigation of the regular, resonant, chaotic behavior of the phase\nspace with a long-term propagation of a sample of initial conditions. The\nresults strongly depend on the value of the area-to-mass ratio of the debris,\nwhich might show different dynamical behaviors: temporary capture or escape\nfrom the geosynchronous resonance, as well as temporary capture or escape from\nsecondary resonances involving the rate of variation of the longitude of the\nSun. Such analysis shows that Poynting-Robertson and solar wind drag must be\ntaken into account, when looking at the long-term behavior of space debris.\nTrapping or escape from the resonance can be used to place the debris in\nconvenient regions of the phase space.\n", "  We present results from a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of the X-ray\nluminous interacting galaxy system Arp 299 (NGC 3690/IC 694). We detect 25\ndiscrete X-ray sources with luminosities above 4.0x10^38 erg s^-1 covering the\nentire Ultra Luminous X-ray source (ULX) regime. Based on the hard X-ray\nspectra of the non-nuclear discrete sources identified in Arp 299, and their\nassociation with young, actively star-forming region of Arp 299 we identify\nthem as HMXBs. We find in total 20 off-nuclear sources with luminosities above\nthe ULX limit, 14 of which are point-like sources. Furthermore we observe a\nmarginally significant deficit in the number of ULXs, with respect to the\nnumber expected from scaling relations of X-ray binaries with the star\nformation rate (SFR). Although the high metalicity of the galaxy could result\nin lower ULX numbers, the good agreement between the observed total X-ray\nluminosity of ULXs, and that expected from the relevant scaling relation\nindicates that this deficit could be the result of confusion effects. The\nintegrated spectrum of the galaxy shows the presence of a hot gaseous component\nwith kT = 0.72+-0.03 keV, contributing 20% of the soft (0.1-2.0 keV) unabsorbed\nluminosity of the galaxy. A plume of soft X-ray emission in the west of the\ngalaxy indicates a large scale outflow. We find that the AGN in NGC 3690\ncontributes only 22% of the observed broad-band X-ray luminosity of Arp 299.\n", "  The nonlinear dynamics associated with sliding friction forms a broad\ninterdisciplinary research field that involves complex dynamical processes and\npatterns covering a broad range of time and length scales. Progress in\nexperimental techniques and computational resources has stimulated the\ndevelopment of more refined and accurate mathematical and numerical models,\ncapable of capturing many of the essentially nonlinear phenomena involved in\nfriction.\n", "  A simple proof of Noether's first theorem involves the promotion of a\nconstant symmetry parameter $\\epsilon$ to an arbitrary function of time, the\nNoether charge $Q$ is then the coefficient of $\\dot\\epsilon$ in the variation\nof the action. Here we examine the validity of this proof for Lagrangian\nmechanics with arbitrarily-high time derivatives, in which context\n\"higher-level\" analogs of Noether's theorem can be similarly proved, and\n\"Noetherian charges\" read off from, e.g. the coefficient of $\\ddot \\epsilon$ in\nthe variation of the action. While $Q=0$ implies a restricted gauge invariance,\nunrestricted gauge invariance requires zero Noetherian charges too. Some\nillustrative examples are considered and the extension to field theory\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the spatially resolved excitation properties of the ionised gas in a\nsample of 646 galaxies using integral field spectroscopy data from SDSS-IV\nMaNGA. Making use of Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich diagnostic diagrams we\ndemonstrate the ubiquitous presence of extended (kpc scale) low ionisation\nemission-line regions (LIERs) in both star forming and quiescent galaxies. In\nstar forming galaxies LIER emission can be associated with diffuse ionised gas,\nmost evident as extra-planar emission in edge-on systems. In addition, we\nidentify two main classes of galaxies displaying LIER emission: `central LIER'\n(cLIER) galaxies, where central LIER emission is spatially extended, but\naccompanied by star formation at larger galactocentric distances, and `extended\nLIER' (eLIER) galaxies, where LIER emission is extended throughout the whole\ngalaxy. In eLIER and cLIER galaxies, LIER emission is associated with radially\nflat, low H$\\alpha$ equivalent width of line emission ($<$ 3 \\AA) and stellar\npopulation indices demonstrating the lack of young stellar populations,\nimplying that line emission follows tightly the continuum due to the underlying\nold stellar population. The H$\\alpha$ surface brightness radial profiles are\nalways shallower than $\\rm 1/r^{2}$ and the line ratio\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007/[OII]$\\lambda$3727,29 (a tracer of the ionisation parameter\nof the gas) shows a flat gradient. This combined evidence strongly supports the\nscenario in which LIER emission is not due to a central point source but to\ndiffuse stellar sources, the most likely candidates being hot, evolved\n(post-asymptotic giant branch) stars. Shocks are observed to play a significant\nrole in the ionisation of the gas only in rare merging and interacting systems.\n", "  In this paper, a plasmonic absorber consisting of a metal-dielectric-metal\nstack with a top layer of Sierpinski nanocarpet is theoretically investigated.\nSuch compact absorber depicts broadband angle-independent behavior over a wide\noptical wavelength range ($400-700$ nm) and a broad range of angles of light\nincidence ($0-80^{\\circ}$). Including several feature sizes, such fractal-like\nstructure shows widely strong extinction ($85-99$%) response for either\ntransverse electric or magnetic polarization states under normal incidence.\nUnderlying mechanisms of absorbance due to excited surface plasmon modes as\nwell as electric/magnetic dipole resonances are well revealed by investigating\nelectric field, magnetic field and current distributions. The proposed absorber\nopens a path to realize high-performance ultrathin light trapping devices.\n", "  If quenched fast enough, a liquid is able to avoid crystallization and will\nremain in a metastable supercooled state down to the glass transition, with an\nimportant increase in viscosity upon further cooling. There are important\ndifferences in the way liquids relax as they approach the glass transition,\nrapid or slow variation in dynamic quantities under moderate temperature\nchanges, and a simple means to quantify such variations is provided by the\nconcept of \"fragility\". Here, we report molecular dynamics simulations of a\ntypical network-forming glass, Ge-Se, and find that the relaxation behaviour of\nthe supercooled liquid is strongly correlated to the variation of rigidity with\ntemperature and the spatial distribution of the corresponding topological\nconstraints which, ultimately connect to fragility minima. This permits\nextending the fragility concept to aspects of topology/rigidity, and to the\ndegree of homogeneity of the atomic-sale interactions for a variety of\nstructural glasses.\n", "  Defect engineering is an effective and powerful tool to control existing\nmaterial properties and create completely new ones, which are\nsymmetry-forbidden in a defect-free crystal. This letter reports on the\ncreation of piezoelectrically active near-surface layer of centrosymmetric\nSrTiO3, modified by the electric field-induced migration of oxygen vacancies.\nWe provide the unequivocal proof of piezoelectricity through the stroboscopic\ntime-resolved X-ray diffraction under alternating electric field. The magnitude\nof the discovered piezoelectric effect is comparable with the bulk\npiezoelectric effect in commercial ferroelectric materials. Such artificially\nformed defect-mediated piezoelectricity can be important as an alternative road\nfor smart materials design.\n", "  The New IRAM KID Array 2 (NIKA 2) is a dual-band camera operating with three\nfrequency-multiplexed kilopixels arrays of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance\nDetectors (LEKID) cooled at 150 mK. NIKA 2 is designed to observe the intensity\nand polarisation of the sky at 1.15 and 2.0 mm wavelength from the IRAM 30 m\ntelescope. The NIKA 2 instrument represents a huge step in performance as\ncompared to the NIKA pathfinder instrument, which has already shown\nstate-of-the-art detector and photometric performance. After the commissioning\nplanned to be accomplished at the end of 2016, NIKA 2 will be an IRAM resident\ninstrument for the next ten years or more. NIKA 2 should allow the\nastrophysical community to tackle a large number of open questions reaching\nfrom the role of the Galactic magnetic field in star formation to the\ndiscrepancy between cluster-based and CMB-based cosmology possibly induced by\nthe unknown cluster physics. We present an overview of the commissioning phase\ntogether with some first results.\n", "  Here, we investigated the influence of grain formation on the magnetization\nreversal of SmCo5/Co at low temperature. A set of SmCo5/Co bi-layer samples\nwere fabricated under identical conditions on MgO(100) and glass substrates\nwith a Cr underlayer. Analysis of each magnetic layer by an Atomic Force\nMicroscope (AFM) reveals that MgO(100) results small and uniform grain\nformation of 23 nm in contrast to 57 nm on glass, and x-ray diffraction studies\nshow that the sample on MgO(100) has high crystallinity with SmCo5(11 0) phase.\nAt room temperature, both samples exhibit good hard magnetic properties with\ncoercivity (HC) of 13.2 kOe and 12.5 kOe, and energy products (BH)max of 14.5\nMGOe and 5.3 MGOe for samples on MgO(100) and glass, respectively. Low\ntemperature hysteresis measurements show an exchange decoupling at low\ntemperatures for the sample on glass, and this is due to the formation of large\ngrains on glass that reduces the effective inter-grain exchange coupling\nbetween phases.\n", "  In this document we present the latest result on rare/forbidden decays for D\nmesons at the BESIII experiment. Based on 2.92/fb data taken at the\ncenter-of-mass energy 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, the flavor-changing\nneutral current process of neutral D decays into two gammas is searched using a\ndouble tag technique, while the decays of charged D decays into a charged\nkaon/pion plus two electrons/positrons are studied based on a single tag\nmethod. The resulting upper limits are still above the Standard Model\npredictions.\n", "  This work is mainly based on some theoretical surveys on two dimensional\nquantum gravitational well, considering harmonic oscillator potential causes an\neffective plank constant. We find that there is a similarity between two\ndifferent cases, potential free and oscillator potential in noncommutative\nphase space in commutative momentum, but in noncommutative, non zero space and\nmomentum The Hamiltonian would a little bit different in energy levels.\n", "  The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and illustrate, once again,\nthe potency of the variational technique as an approximation procedure for the\nquantization of quantum mechanical systems. By choosing particle-in-a-box\nwavefunctions as trial wavefunctions, with the size of the box as the variation\nparameter, approximate eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions are\nobtained for the one dimensional free harmonic oscillator.\n", "  In a recent Letter [S. Ganeshan, E. Barnes, and S. Das Sarma, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 111, 130405 (2013)], Ganeshan et al. present a general framework to\nclassify the resonance structure of Landau-Majorana-Stuckelberg-Zener\ninterferometry into three basic categories distinguished by whether these\nresonances correspond to periodic or nonperiodic quantum evolution. In this\nComment, we show that their identification of the real resonances in the regime\nof small drive amplitude is incorrect.\n", "  One of the main goals of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is\nto look for new sources of CP-invariance violation. Another is to significantly\ntest the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm. Here, we show that there are\nCP-invariant new physics scenarios which, as far as DUNE data are concerned,\ncannot be distinguished from the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm with very\nlarge CP-invariance violating effects. We discuss examples with non-standard\nneutrino interactions and with a fourth neutrino mass eigenstate. We briefly\ndiscuss how ambiguities can be resolved by combining DUNE data with data from\nother long-baseline experiments, including Hyper-Kamiokande.\n", "  Context: BL Lac objects are a rare class of active galactic nuclei that\ntypically show featureless optical spectra that make it difficult to estimate\nthe redshift. A novel method for estimating the redshift of BL Lac objects has\nrecently been proposed which assumes that these objects typically reside in\ngroups of galaxies.\n  Aims: The aim of this work is to estimate the fraction of BL Lac objects that\nreside in groups of galaxies.\n  Methods: We use a sample of groups (M12 catalogue) selected by applying a\nfriends-of-friends algorithm in the SDSS DR12. Galaxies in the M12 sample were\ncross-correlated with the sample of blazars in the BZCAT.\n  Results: We found that 121 galaxies in the M12 catalogue are blazars in the\nBZCAT sample, all but one are BL Lac objects, and a large fraction are\nclassified as BL Lac-galaxy dominated. Analysing the fraction of galaxies in\ngroups as a function of redshift we have estimated a correction factor that\ntakes into account the typical incompleteness of the catalogues based on the\nfriends-of-friends algorithm. Once this factor was applied to the sample of BL\nLac objects with a counterpart in the M12 catalogue, we found that the\npercentage of BL Lac objects in groups is $\\gtrsim 67 \\pm 8\\%$.\n  Conclusions: The high rate of BL Lac objects in groups found in this work\nstrongly supports a recent method that has successfully estimated the redshift\nof BL Lac objects with featureless spectra.\n", "  Optimization problems with Boolean variables that fall into the\nnondeterministic polynomial (NP) class are of fundamental importance in\ncomputer science, mathematics, physics and industrial applications. Most\nnotably, solving constraint-satisfaction problems, which are related to\nspin-glass-like Hamiltonians in physics, remains a difficult numerical task. As\nsuch, there has been great interest in designing efficient heuristics to solve\nthese computationally difficult problems. Inspired by parallel tempering Monte\nCarlo in conjunction with the rejection-free isoenergetic cluster algorithm\ndeveloped for Ising spin glasses, we present a generalized global update\noptimization heuristic that can be applied to different NP-complete problems\nwith Boolean variables. The global cluster updates allow for a wide-spread\nsampling of phase space, thus considerably speeding up optimization. By\ncarefully tuning the pseudo-temperature (needed to randomize the\nconfigurations) of the problem, we show that the method can efficiently tackle\noptimization problems with over-constraints or on topologies with a large\nsite-percolation threshold. We illustrate the efficiency of the heuristic on\nparadigmatic optimization problems, such as the maximum satisfiability problem\nand the vertex cover problem.\n", "  We examine theoretically porous membranes in aqueous mixtures. We show that\nlarge membrane pores can be reversibly gated from `off' (co-solvent-rich, poor\nconductor of ions and other solutes) to 'on' (water-rich, good conductor)\nstates by an external potential. The transition voltage or charge for switching\ndepends on the membrane hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, the salt content, the\npreferential solvation of the salt ions, and the temperature. These parameters\nalso determine whether the filling transition is abrupt or gradual.\n", "  We have developed terahertz frequency quantum cascade lasers that exploit a\ndouble-periodicity distributed feedback grating to control the emission\nfrequency and the output beam direction independently. The spatial refractive\nindex modulation of the gratings necessary to provide optical feedback at a\nfixed frequency and, simultaneously, a far-field emission pattern centered at\ncontrolled angles, was designed through use of an appropriate wavevector\nscattering model. Single mode THz emission at angles tuned by design between\n0{\\deg} and 50{\\deg} was realized, leading to an original phase-matching\napproach, lithographically independent, for highly collimated THz QCLs.\n", "  A consistent formulation to incorporate massive neutrinos in the perturbation\ntheory of the effective CDM+baryons fluid is introduced. In this formulation\nall linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations,\nas well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken\ninto account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino\nfraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of\nneutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory.\nThen the \"bare\" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the\nneutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to\nthe gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for\nthe \"bare\" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing\nexact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly\nderive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the\nlinear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction,\nand derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive\nneutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a\nsensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction\nformulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion\nof massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.\n", "  Dual comb spectroscopy allows for high-resolution spectra to be measured over\nbroad bandwidths, but an essential requirement for coherent integration is the\navailability of a phase reference. Usually, this means that the combs' phase\nand timing errors must be measured and either minimized by stabilization or\nremoved by correction, limiting the technique's applicability. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to extract the phase and timing signals of a\nmultiheterodyne spectrum completely computationally, without any extra\nmeasurements or optical elements. These techniques are viable even when the\nrelative linewidth exceeds the repetition rate difference, and can tremendously\nsimplify any dual comb system. By reconceptualizing frequency combs in terms of\nthe temporal structure of their phase noise, not their frequency stability, we\nare able to greatly expand the scope of multiheterodyne techniques.\n", "  A system based on commercially available items, such as a laser diode,\nemitting in the visible range $\\sim 400$ nm,and multimode fiber patches, fused\nfiber splitters and optical switches may be assembled,for time calibration of\nmulti-channels time-of-flight (TOF) detectors with photomultipliers' (PMTs')\nreadout. As available laser diode sources have unfortunately limited peak\npower, the main experimental problem is the tight light power budget of such a\nsystem. In addition, while the technology for fused fiber splitters is common\nin the Telecom wavelength range ($\\lambda \\sim 850, 1300-1500$ nm), it is not\neasily available in the visible one. Therefore, extensive laboratory tests had\nto be done on purpose, to qualify the used optical components, and a full scale\ntiming calibration prototype was built. Obtained results show that with such a\nsystem, a calibration resolution ($\\sigma$) in the range 20-30 ps may be within\nreach. Therefore, fast multi-channels TOF detectors, with timing resolutions in\nthe range 50-100 ps, may be easily calibrated in time. Results on tested\noptical components may be of interest also for time calibration of different\nlight detection systems based on PMTs, as the ones used for detection of the\nvacuum ultraviolet scintillation light emitted by ionizing particles in large\nLAr TPCs.\n", "  We propose a family of models to study the evolution of ties in a network of\ninteracting agents by reinforcement and penalization of their connections\naccording to certain local laws of interaction. The family of stochastic\ndynamical systems, on the edges of a graph, exhibits \\emph{good} convergence\nproperties, in particular, we prove a strong-stability result: a subset of\nbinary matrices or graphs -- characterized by certain compatibility properties\n-- is a global almost sure attractor of the family of stochastic dynamical\nsystems. To illustrate finer properties of the corresponding strong attractor,\nwe present some simulation results that capture, e.g., the conspicuous\nphenomenon of emergence and downfall of leaders in social networks.\n", "  Employing the Sagdeev pseudo-potential technique the ion acoustic solitary\nstructures have been investigated in an unmagnetized collisionless plasma\nconsisting of adiabatic warm ions, nonthermal electrons and isothermal\npositrons. The qualitatively different compositional parameter spaces clearly\nindicate the existence domains of solitons and double layers with respect to\nany parameter of the present plasma system. The present system supports the\nnegative potential double layer which always restricts the occurrence of\nnegative potential solitons. The system also supports positive potential double\nlayers when the ratio of the average thermal velocity of positrons to that of\nelectrons is less than a critical value. However, there exists a parameter\nregime for which the positive potential double layer is unable to restrict the\noccurrence of positive potential solitary waves and in this region of the\nparameter space, there exist positive potential solitary waves after the\nformation of a positive potential double layer. Consequently, positive\npotential supersolitons have been observed. The nonthermality of electrons\nplays an important role in the formation of positive potential double layers as\nwell as positive potential supersolitons. The formation of positive potential\nsupersoliton is analysed with the help of phase portraits of the dynamical\nsystem corresponding to the ion acoustic solitary structures of the present\nplasma system.\n", "  Neutron stars are ideal astrophysical laboratories for testing theories of\nthe de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect and diamagnetic phase transition which is\nassociated with magnetic domain formation. The \"magnetic interaction\" between\ndelocalized magnetic moments of electrons (the Shoenberg effect), can result in\nan effect of the diamagnetic phase transition into domains of alternating\nmagnetization (Condon's domains). Associated with the domain formation are\nprominent magnetic field oscillation and anisotropic magnetic stress which may\nbe large enough to fracture the crust of magnetar with a super-strong field.\nEven if the fracture is impossible as in \"low-field\" magnetar, the depinning\nphase transition of domain wall motion driven by low field rate (mainly due to\nthe Hall effect) in the randomly perturbed crust can result in a\ncatastrophically variation of magnetic field. This intermittent motion, similar\nto the avalanche process, makes the Hall effect be dissipative. These\nqualitative consequences about magnetized electron gas are consistent with\nobservations of magnetar emission, and especially the threshold critical\ndynamics of driven domain wall can partially overcome the difficulties of\n\"low-field\" magnetar bursts and the heating mechanism of transient, or\n\"outbursting\" magnetar.\n", "  We generalize the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of topological insulators using\nnoncommutative differential geometry in two different ways. First, we model\nMajorana zero modes by KQ-cycles in the framework of analytic K-homology, and\nwe define the noncommutative $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant as a topological index in\nnoncommutative topology. Second, we look at the geometric picture of the\nPfaffian formalism of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, i.e., the Kane--Mele\ninvariant, and we define the noncommutative Kane--Mele invariant over the fixed\npoint algebra of the time reversal symmetry in the noncommutative 2-torus.\nFinally, we are able to prove the equivalence between the noncommutative\ntopological $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and the noncommutative Kane--Mele invariant.\n", "  We put forward an effective amplification protocol for protecting the\nsingle-photon entangled state of the time-bin qubit. The protocol only requires\none pair of the single-photon entangled state and some auxiliary single\nphotons. With the help of the 50:50 beam splitters, variable beam splitters\nwith the transmission of $t$ and the polarizing beam splitters, we can increase\nthe fidelity of the single-photon entangled state under $t<\\frac{1}{2}$.\nMoreover, the encoded time-bin information can be perfectly contained. Our\nprotocol is quite simple and economical. More importantly, it can be realized\nunder current experimental condition. Based on the above features, our protocol\nmay be useful in current and future quantum information processing.\n", "  The combined constraints from six early Run 2 ATLAS searches for\nsupersymmetry are interpreted in the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric\nextension to the Standard Model (pMSSM). Each of the searches was based on\nproton-proton collision data recorded in 2015 at $\\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV with 3.2\nfb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Sensitivity to squarks of the first two\ngenerations and gluinos are evaluated using fast detector simulation. Results\nare presented in the 19-parameter R-parity conserving pMSSM with the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP) being the neutralino. Considering 181.8k points\nthat survived Run 1 constraints, 15.7% are excluded at 95% confidence level. Of\nthose satisfying these Run 2 constraints, 0.5% (1.0%) have sub-TeV gluinos\n(sub-500 GeV squarks), the lightest of which has a mass of 757 GeV (293 GeV)\nwith a 689 GeV (217 GeV) LSP.\n", "  Fast (>700 km/s) and slow (~400 km/s) winds stream from the Sun, permeate the\nheliosphere and influence the near-Earth environment. While the fast wind is\nknown to emanate primarily from polar coronal holes, the source of the slow\nwind remains unknown. Here we identify possible sites of origin using a slow\nsolar wind source map of the entire Sun, which we construct from specially\ndesigned, full- disk observations from the Hinode satellite, and a magnetic\nfield model. Our map provides a full-Sun observation that combines three key\ningredients for identifying the sources: velocity, plasma composition and\nmagnetic topology and shows them as solar wind composition plasma outflowing on\nopen magnetic field lines. The area coverage of the identified sources is large\nenough that the sum of their mass contributions can explain a significant\nfraction of the mass loss rate of the solar wind.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a weakly universal cellular automaton on the\ntessellation $\\{9,3\\}$ which has two states and which is not rotation invariant\nbut which is truly planar.\n", "  We propose a simple model to explain the velocity of young neutron stars. We\nattempt to confirm a relationship between the amount of mass ejected in the\nformation of the neutron star and the `kick' velocity imparted to the compact\nremnant resulting from the process. We assume the velocity is given by $v_{\\rm\nkick}=\\alpha\\,(M_{\\rm ejecta} / M_{\\rm remnant}) + \\beta\\,$. To test this\nsimple relationship we use the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis)\ncode to create stellar population models from both single and binary star\nevolutionary pathways. We then use our Remnant Ejecta and Progenitor Explosion\nRelationship (REAPER) code to apply different $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ values and\nthree different `kick' orientations then record the resulting velocity\nprobability distributions.\n  We find that while a single star population provides a poor fit to the\nobservational data, the binary population provides an excellent fit. Values of\n$\\alpha=70\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\beta=110\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ reproduce the\n\\cite{RN165} observed 2-dimensional velocities and $\\alpha=70\\, {\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\beta=120\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ reproduce their inferred\n3-dimensional velocity distribution for nearby single neutron stars with ages\nless than 3 Myrs. After testing isotropic, spin-axis aligned and orthogonal to\nspin-axis `kick' orientations, we find no statistical preference for a `kick'\norientation. While ejecta mass cannot be the only factor that determines the\nvelocity of supernovae compact remnants, we suggest it is a significant\ncontributor and that the ejecta based `kick' should replace the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution currently used in many population\nsynthesis codes.\n", "  Most disorders are caused by a combination of multiple genetic and/or\nenvironmental factors. If two diseases are caused by the same molecular\nmechanism, they tend to co-occur in patients. Here we provide a quantitative\nmethod to disentangle how much genetic or environmental risk factors contribute\nto the pathogenesis of 358 individual diseases, respectively. We pool data on\ngenetic, pathway-based, and toxicogenomic disease-causing mechanisms with\ndisease co-occurrence data obtained from almost two million patients. From this\ndata we construct a multilayer network where nodes represent disorders that are\nconnected by links that either represent phenotypic comorbidity of the patients\nor the involvement of a certain molecular mechanism. From the similarity of\nphenotypic and mechanism-based networks for each disorder we derive measure\nthat allows us to quantify the relative importance of various molecular\nmechanisms for a given disease. We find that most diseases are dominated by\ngenetic risk factors, while environmental influences prevail for disorders such\nas depressions, cancers, or dermatitis. Almost never we find that more than one\ntype of mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases.\n", "  Standard weak measurement (SWM) has been proved to be a useful ingredient for\nmeasuring small longitudinal phase shifts. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 033604\n(2013)]. In this letter, we show that with specfic pre-coupling and\npostselection, destructive interference can be observed for the two conjugated\nvariables, i.e. time and frequency, of the meter state. Using a broad band\nsource, this conjugated destructive interference (CDI) can be observed in a\nregime approximately 1 attosecond, while the related spectral shift reaches\nhundreds of THz. This extreme sensitivity can be used to detect tiny\nlongitudinal phase perturbation. Combined with a frequency-domain analysis,\nconjugated destructive interference weak measurement (CDIWM) is proved to\noutperform SWM by two orders of magnitude.\n", "  The lattice constant, bulk modulus and shear constant of TbN are calculated\nby means of density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation\n(LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), with 4f-states treated as\nvalence electrons or core electrons. In addition, local Coulomb repulsions U\nare treated both statically as in the LDA+U approach and dynamically as in the\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in the Hubbard-I approximation. It is shown\nthat all methods, except DFT-LDA with 4f electrons treated as either valence\nstates, produce lattice constants and bulk moduli in good agreement with\nexperiment. In the LDA+U approach multiple minima are found, and we focus on\nthe competition between a state with cubic symmetry and a state obtained from\natomic Hund's rules. We find the state with cubic symmetry to be 0.59 eV lower\nin energy than the Hund's rules state, while the opposite was obtained in\nprevious literature. The shear constant is shown to be rather sensitive to the\ntheoretical method used, and the Hund's rules state obtained in LDA+U is found\nto be unstable towards tetragonal shear. As to the magnetism, we find that the\ncalculation based on the Hubbard-I approximation reproduces observations with\nthe best accuracy. Finally, the spectral properties of TbN are discussed,\ntogether with the general applicability of the different methods in describing\nrare-earth elements and compounds.\n", "  New generation of Cooper pair splitters defined on hybrid nanostructures are\ndevices with high tunable coupling parameters. Transport measurements through\nthese devices revealed clear signatures of interference effects and motivated\nus to introduce a new model, called the 3-sites model. These devices provide an\nideal playground to tune the Cooper pair splitting (CPS) efficency on demand,\nand displays a rich variety of physical phenomena. In the present work we\nanalyze theoretically the conductance of the 3-sites model in the linear and\nnon-linear regimes and characterize the most representative features that arise\nby the interplay of the different model parameters. In the linear regime we\nfind that the local processes typically exhibit Fano-shape resonances, while\nthe CPS contribution exhibits Lorentzian-shapes. Remarkably, we find that under\ncertain conditions, the transport is blocked by the presence of a dark state.\nIn the non-linear regime we established a hierarchy of the model parameters to\nobtain the conditions for optimal efficency.\n", "  The rare-earths are known to have intriguing changes of the valence,\ndepending on chemical surrounding or geometry. Here we make predictions from\ntheory that combines density functional theory with atomic multiplet-theory, on\nthe transition of valence when transferring from the atomic divalent limit to\nthe trivalent bulk, passing through different sized clusters, of selected\nrare-earths. We predict that Tm clusters show an abrupt change from pure\ndivalent to pure trivalent at a size of 6 atoms, while Sm and Tb clusters are\nrespectively pure divalent and trivalent up to 8 atoms. Larger Sm clusters are\nargued to likely make a transition to a mixed valent, or trivalent,\nconfiguration. The valence of all rare-earth clusters, as a function of size,\nis predicted from interpolation of our calculated results. We argue that the\nhere predicted behavior is best analyzed by spectroscopic measurements, and\nprovide theoretical spectra, based on dynamical mean field theory, in the\nHubbard-I approximation, to ease experimental analysis.\n", "  In this note, using an idea from \\cite{Amo-Carrillo-Sanchez} we derive some\nnew series representations involving $\\zeta(2n)$ and Euler numbers. Using a\nwell-known series representation for the Clausen function, we also provide some\nnew representations of Apery's constant $\\zeta(3)$. In particular cases, we\nrecover some well-known series representations of $\\pi$.\n", "  Here we follow, both experimentally and theoretically, the development of\nmagnetism in Tb clusters from the atomic limit, adding one atom at a time. The\nexchange interaction is, surprisingly, observed to drastically increase\ncompared to that of bulk, and to exhibit irregular oscillations as a function\nof the interatomic distance. From electronic structure theory we find that the\ntheoretical magnetic moments oscillate with cluster size in exact agreement\nwith experimental data. Unlike the bulk, the oscillation is not caused by the\nRKKY mechanism. Instead, the inter-atomic exchange is shown to be driven by a\ncompetition between wave-function overlap of the 5d shell and the on-site\nexchange interaction, which leads to a competition between ferromagnetic\ndouble-exchange and antiferromagnetic super-exchange. This understanding opens\nup new ways to tune the magnetic properties of rare-earth based magnets with\nnano-sized building blocks.\n", "  We investigate how night side cooling and surface friction impact surface\ntemperatures and large scale circulation for tidally locked Earth-like planets.\nFor each scenario, we vary the orbital period between $P_{rot}=1-100$~days and\ncapture changes in climate states.\n  We find drastic changes in climate states for different surface friction\nscenarios. For very efficient surface friction ($t_{s,fric}=$ 0.1 days), the\nsimulations for short rotation periods ($P_{rot} \\leq$ 10 days) show\npredominantly standing extra tropical Rossby waves. These waves lead to climate\nstates with two high latitude westerly jets and unperturbed meridional direct\ncirculation. In most other scenarios, simulations with short rotation periods\nexhibit instead dominance by standing tropical Rossby waves. Such climate\nstates have a single equatorial westerly jet, which disrupts direct\ncirculation.\n  Experiments with weak surface friction ($t_{s,fric}=~10 -100$ days) show\ndecoupling between surface temperatures and circulation, which leads to strong\ncooling of the night side. The experiment with $t_{s,fric}= 100$ days assumes\nclimate states with easterly flow (retrograde rotation) for medium and slow\nplanetary rotations $P_{rot}= 12 - 100$~days.\n  We show that an increase of night side cooling efficiency by one order of\nmagnitude compared to the nominal model leads to a cooling of the night side\nsurface temperatures by 80-100~K. The day side surface temperatures only drop\nby 25~K at the same time. The increase in thermal forcing suppresses the\nformation of extra tropical Rossby waves on small planets ($R_P=1 R_{Earth}$)\nin the short rotation period regime ($P_{rot} \\leq$ 10 days).\n", "  Recent experiments on isolated Co clusters have shown huge orbital magnetic\nmoments in comparison with their bulk and surface counterparts. These clusters\nhence provide the unique possibility to study the evolution of the orbital\nmagnetic moment with respect to the cluster size and how competing interactions\ncontribute to the quenching of orbital magnetism. We investigate here different\ntheoretical methods to calculate the spin and orbital moments of Co clusters,\nand assess the performances of the methods in comparison with experiments. It\nis shown that density functional theory in conventional local density or\ngeneralized gradient approximations, or even with a hybrid functional, severely\nunderestimates the orbital moment. As natural extensions/corrections we\nconsidered the orbital polarization correction, the LDA+U approximation as well\nas the LDA+DMFT method. Our theory shows that of the considered methods, only\nthe LDA+DMFT method provides orbital moments in agreement with experiment, thus\nemphasizing the importance of dynamic correlations effects for determining\nfundamental magnetic properties of magnets in the nano-size regime.\n", "  NIKA2 (New IRAM KID Arrays) is a dual band (150 and 260 GHz) imaging camera\nbased on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) and designed to work at the IRAM\n30 m telescope (Pico Veleta, Spain). Built on the experience of the NIKA\nprototype, NIKA2 has been installed at the 30 m focal plane in October 2015 and\nthe commissioning phase is now ongoing. Through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\n(tSZ) effect, NIKA2 will image the ionized gas residing in clusters of galaxies\nwith a resolution of 12 and 18 arcsec FWHM (at 150 and 260 GHz, respectively).\nWe report on the recent tSZ measurements with the NIKA camera and discuss the\nfuture objectives for the NIKA2 SZ large Program, 300h of observation dedicated\nto SZ science. With this program we intend to perform a high angular resolution\nfollow-up of a cosmologically-representative sample of clusters belonging to SZ\ncatalogues, with redshift greater than 0.5. The main output of the program will\nbe the study of the redshift evolution of the cluster pressure profile as well\nas that of the scaling laws relating the cluster global properties.\n", "  The feasibility of using a thermomagnetically pumped ferrofluid to enhance\nthe performance of a natural convection cooling loop is investigated. First, a\nsimplified analytical estimate for the thermomagnetic pumping action is\nderived, and then design rules for optimal solenoid and ferrofluid are\npresented. The design rules are used to set up a medium-scale (1 m, 10-1000 W)\ncase study, which is modeled using a previously published and validated model\n(Aursand et al. [1]). The results show that the thermomagnetic driving force is\nsignificant compared to the natural convection driving force, and may in some\ncases greatly surpass it. The results also indicate that cooling performance\ncan be increased by factors up to 4 and 2 in the single-phase and two- phase\nregimes, respectively, even when taking into the account the added heat from\nthe solenoid. The performance increases can alternatively be used to obtain a\nreduction in heat-sink size by up to 75 %.\n", "  In the present work we recall and extend the results of previous work\nconcerning the time evolution of open quantum systems. We show how general\nproperties of such systems are related to their structure properties, those of\ntheir environments and the interaction between the systems and the\nenvironments.\n", "  I present a lightweight C++ library for the evaluation of classical\npolylogarithms Li_n and the special function Li_{22} for arbitrary complex\narguments. The evaluation is possible in arbitrary precision arithmetic and\nfeatures also an explicit double precision implementation for a much faster\nnumerical evaluation. The implementation is based on arXiv:1601.02649.\n", "  A one-dimensional multi-phase flow model for thermomagnetically pumped\nferrofluid with heat transfer is proposed. The thermodynamic model is a\ncombination of a simplified particle model and thermodynamic equations of state\nfor the base fluid. The magnetization model is based on statistical mechanics,\ntaking into account non-uniform particle size distributions. An implementation\nof the proposed model is validated against experiments from the literature, and\nfound to give good predictions for the thermomagnetic pumping performance.\nHowever, the results reveal a very large sensitivity to uncertainties in heat\ntransfer coefficient predictions.\n", "  Herewith, we review the available experimental data of thermoelectric\ntransport properties of iron-based superconductors and parent compounds. We\ndiscuss possible physical mechanisms into play in determining the Seebeck\neffect, from whence one can extract information about Fermi surface\nreconstruction and Lifshitz transitions, multiband character, coupling of\ncharge carriers with spin excitations and its relevance in the unconventional\nsuperconducting pairing mechanism, nematicity, quantum critical fluctuations\nclose to the optimal doping for superconductivity, correlation. Additional\ninformation is obtained from the analysis of the Nernst effect, whose\nenhancement in parent compounds must be related partially to multiband\ntransport and low Fermi level, but mainly to the presence of Dirac cone bands\nat the Fermi level. In the superconducting compounds, large Nernst effect in\nthe normal state is explained in terms of fluctuating precursors of the spin\ndensity wave state, while in the superconducting state it mirrors the usual\nvortex liquid dissipative regime. A comparison between the phenomenology of\nthermoelectric behavior of different families of iron-based superconductors and\nparent compounds allows to evidence the key differences and analogies, thus\nproviding clues on the rich and complex physics of these fascinating\nunconventional superconductors.\n", "  We report on the generation of broadband, high-energy femtosecond pulses\ncentered at 1.28 um by stimulated Raman scattering in pressurized hydrogen\ncell. Stimulated Raman scattering is performed by two chirped and delayed\npulses originating from a multi-mJ Ti:Sapphire amplifier. The Stokes pulse\ncarries energy of 4.4 mJ and is recompressed down to 66 fs by reflective\ngrating pair. We characterized the short-wavelength mid-infrared source in view\nof energy stability, beam profile and conversion efficiency at a repetition\nrate of 100 Hz and 10 Hz. The demonstrated laser will benefit intense THz\ngeneration applications from highly nonlinear organic crystals.\n", "  The dynamics of the Chua circuit is studied. Analysis of equilibrium states\nwas revealed. Parameter plane of the picewise linear voltage-current was\nobtained. For this system was shown sequence of bifurcations of symmetry\nbroken.\n", "  We use the machinery usually employed for studying the onset of\nRayleigh--B\\'enard convection in hydro- and magnetohydro-dynamic settings to\naddress the onset of convection induced by the magnetothermal instability and\nthe heat-flux-buoyancy-driven-instability in the weakly-collisional magnetized\nplasma permeating the intracluster medium. Since most of the related numerical\nsimulations consider the plasma being bounded between two `plates' on which\nboundary conditions are specified, our strategy provides a framework that could\nenable a more direct connection between analytical and numerical studies. We\nderive the conditions for the onset of these instabilities considering the\neffects of induced magnetic tension resulting from a finite plasma beta. We\nprovide expressions for the Rayleigh number in terms of the wave vector\nassociated with a given mode, which allow us to characterize the modes that are\nfirst to become unstable. For both the heat-flux-buoyancy-driven-instability\nand the magnetothermal instability, oscillatory marginal stable states are\npossible.\n", "  Ground magnetic field measurements can be mathematically related to an\noverhead ionospheric equivalent current. In this study we look in detail at how\nthe global equivalent current, calculated using more than 30 years of SuperMAG\nmagnetometer data, changes with sunlight conditions. The calculations are done\nusing spherical harmonic analysis in quasi-dipole coordinates, a technique\nwhich leads to improved accuracy compared to previous studies. Sorting the data\naccording to the location of the sunlight terminator and orientation of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we find that the equivalent current\nresembles ionospheric convection patterns on the sunlit side of the terminator\nbut not on the dark side. On the dark side, with southward IMF, the current is\nstrongly dominated by a dawn cell and the current across the polar cap has a\nstrong dawnward component. The contrast between the sunlit and dark side\nincreases with increasing values of the $\\mathit{F}_{10.7}$ index, showing that\nincreasing solar EUV flux changes not only the magnitude but also the\nmorphology of the equivalent current system. The results are consistent with a\nrecent study showing that Birkeland currents indirectly determine the\nequivalent current in darkness and that Hall currents dominate in sunlight.\nThis has implication for the interpretation of ground magnetic field\nmeasurements and suggests that the magnetic disturbances at conjugate points\nwill be asymmetrical when the solar illumination is different.\n", "  Flux transfer events (FTEs) are the manifestation of bursty and/or patchy\nmagnetic reconnection at the magnetopause. We compare two sequences of the\nionospheric signatures of flux transfer events observed in global auroral\nimagery and coherent ionospheric radar measurements. Both sequences were\nobserved during very similar seasonal and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nconditions, though with differing solar wind speed. A key observation is that\nthe signatures differed considerably in their local time extent. The two\nperiods are 26 August 1998, when the IMF had components\n$\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{z}}$ $\\approx$ -10 nT and $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{y}}$\n$\\approx$ 9 nT and the solar wind speed was $\\mathit{V}_{\\mathit{x}}$ $\\approx$\n650 km $s^{-1}$, and 31 August 2005, IMF $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{z}}$ $\\approx$ -7\nnT, $\\mathit{B}_{\\mathit{y}}$ $\\approx$ 17 nT, and $\\mathit{V}_{\\mathit{x}}$\n$\\approx$ 380 km $s^{-1}$. In the first case, the reconnection rate was\nestimated to be near 160 kV, and the FTE signatures extended across at least 7\nh of magnetic local time (MLT) of the dayside polar cap boundary. In the\nsecond, a reconnection rate close to 80 kV was estimated, and the FTEs had a\nMLT extent of roughly 2 h. We discuss the ramifications of these differences\nfor solar wind-magnetosphere coupling.\n", "  Classical continuum mechanical theories operate on three-dimensional\nEu-clidian space using scalar, vector, and tensor-valued quantities usually up\nto the order of four. For their numerical treatment, it is common practice to\ntransform the relations into a matrix-vector format. This transformation is\nusually performed using the so-called Voigt mapping. This mapping does not\npreserve tensor character leaving significant room for error as stress and\nstrain quantities follow from different mappings and thus have to be treated\ndifferently in certain mathematical operations. Despite its conceptual and\nnotational difficulties having been pointed out, the Voigt mapping remains the\nfoundation of most current finite element programmes. An alternative is the\nso-called Kelvin mapping which has recently gained recognition in studies of\ntheoretical mechanics. This article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin\nmapping in numerical modelling tools such as finite element software. The\ndecisive difference to the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin's method preserves\ntensor character, and thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds\nto the original tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations\nare that tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress\nor strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed into\nmatrix equations without additional considerations. The only implementational\nchanges are related to a scalar factor in certain finite element matrices and\nhence, harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very little cost.\n", "  Low-energy ions of ionospheric origin constitute a significant contributor to\nthe magnetospheric plasma population. Measuring cold ions is difficult though.\nObservations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in\nregions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar\nillumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle\ndetectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow\nduring segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise if continuous\nlongtime observations, such as during a geomagnetic storm, are needed. In this\npaper we suggest a new approach, based on a combination of synoptic\nobservations and a novel technique to estimate the flux and total outflow\nduring the various phases of geomagnetic storms. Our results indicate large\nvariations in both outflow rates and transport throughout the storm. Prior to\nthe storm main phase, outflow rates are moderate, and the cold ions are mainly\nemanating from moderately sized polar cap regions. Throughout the main phase of\nthe storm, outflow rates increase and the polar cap source regions expand.\nFurthermore, faster transport, resulting from enhanced convection, leads to a\nmuch larger supply of cold ions to the near-Earth region during geomagnetic\nstorms.\n", "  This master thesis presents a new type of Positron Emission TOF Apparatus\nusing Liquid xenOn (PETALO). The detector is based in the Liquid Xenon\nScintillating Cell (LXSC). The cell is a box filled with liquid xenon (LXe)\nwhose transverse dimensions are chosen to optimize packing and with a thickness\noptimized to contain a large fraction of the incoming photons. The entry and\nexit faces of the box (relative to the incoming gammas direction) are\ninstrumented with large silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), coated with a\nwavelength shifter, tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). The non-instrumented faces are\ncovered by reflecting Teflon coated with TPB. In this thesis we show that the\nLXSC can display an energy resolution of 5% FWHM, much better than that of\nconventional solid scintillators such as LSO/LYSO. The LXSC can measure the\ninteraction point of the incoming photon with a resolution in the three\ncoordinates of 1 mm. The very fast scintillation time of LXe (2 ns) and the\navailability of suitable sensors and electronics permits a coincidence\nresolution time (CRT) in the range of 100-200 ps, again much better than any\ncurrent PET-TOF system. The LXSC constitutes the core of a high-sensitivity,\nnuclear magnetic resonance compatible, PET device, with enhanced Time Of Flight\n(TOF) sensitivity.\n", "  The longitudinal segmentation of shashlik calorimeters is challenged by dead\nzones and non-uniformities introduced by the light collection and readout\nsystem. This limitation can be overcome by direct fiber-photosensor coupling,\navoiding routing and bundling of the wavelength shifter fibers and embedding\nultra-compact photosensors (SiPMs) in the bulk of the calorimeter. We present\nthe first experimental test of this readout scheme performed at the CERN PS-T9\nbeamline in 2015 with negative particles in the 1-5~GeV energy range. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that the scheme does not compromise the energy resolution\nand linearity compared with standard light collection and readout systems. In\naddition, we study the performance of the calorimeter for partially contained\ncharged hadrons to assess the $e/\\pi$ separation capability and the response of\nthe photosensors to direct ionization.\n", "  Carbon, being one of the most versatile elements of the periodic table, forms\nsolids and molecules with often unusual properties. Recently, a novel family of\nthree-dimensional graphitic carbon structures, the so-called hyperhoneycomb\nlattices, has been proposed, with the possibility of being topological\ninsulators [K. Mullen, B. Uchoa and D. T. Glatzhofer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,\n026403 (2015)]. In this work, we present electronic structure calculations for\none member ($\\mathcal{H}$-0) of this family, using Density Functional Theory\nand non-equilibrium Green's functions transport calculations to show that the\n$\\mathcal{H}$-0 structure should have strongly anisotropic electronic\nproperties, being an insulator or a conductor depending on the crystalline\norientation chosen for transport. Calculations in the framework of Extended\nH\\\"uckel Theory indicate that these properties can only be understood if one\nconsiders at least $2^{nd}$ nearest-neighbor interactions between carbon atoms,\ninvalidating some of the conclusions of Ref. [K. Mullen, B. Uchoa and D. T.\nGlatzhofer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 026403 (2015)], at least for this particular\nmaterial.\n", "  We report on a case study of the complex type II radio burst of 2012 January\n19 and its association with a white light coronal mass ejection (CME). The\ncomplexity can be described as the appearance of an additional type II burst\ncomponent and strong intensity variation. The dynamic spectrum shows a pair of\ntype II bursts with fundamental harmonic structures, one confined to\ndecameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths and the other extending to kilometric\n(km) wavelengths. By comparing the speeds obtained from white-light images with\nthat speed of the shock inferred from the drift rate, we show that the source\nof the short-lived DH component is near the nose.\n", "  This thesis studies the interaction between near-infrared light and gigahertz\nsound in nanoscale silicon waveguides. Chapter 2 introduces photon-phonon\ncoupling and its theoretical description, describing basic mechanisms and\ndeveloping a quantum field theory of the process. Chapter 3 explores the\ndynamical effects in both waveguides and cavities. It also proves a connection\nbetween the Brillouin gain coefficient and the vacuum coupling rate. Chapter 4\ndeals with the observation of Brillouin scattering in nanoscale silicon\nwaveguides. The waveguides tightly confine $193 \\, \\text{THz}$ light and $10 \\,\n\\text{GHz}$ acoustic vibrations. The acoustic quality factor remains limited to\nabout $300$ because of leakage into silica substrate. These waveguides are\noptically transparent in a narrow band of frequencies at a pump power of $25 \\,\n\\text{mW}$. Besides this amplification, we translate a $10 \\, \\text{GHz}$\nmicrowave signal across $1 \\, \\text{THz}$. Chapter 5 extends the experimental\nwork of chapter 4 by fabricating a cascade of fully suspended nanowires held by\nsilica anchors. This enhances the mechanical quality factor from $300$ to\n$1000$, enabling the observation of Brillouin amplification exceeding the\npropagation losses in silicon. The amount of amplification is mostly limited by\na rapid drop in acoustic quality as the number of suspensions increases. We\npropose a mechanism to cancel this inhomogeneous broadening. Chapter 6 looks at\nthe potential of narrow silicon slot waveguides to enhance the optomechanical\ncoupling. For certain dimensions, these waveguides support opto-acoustic modes\nwith an interaction efficiency simulated an order of magnitude above those of\nsingle-nanobeam systems.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of $1/f^{\\alpha}$ noise in\nquasi-bidimensionnal turbulence of an electromagnetically forced flow. The\nlarge scale velocity $U_L$ exhibits this power-law spectrum with $\\alpha \\simeq\n0.7$ over a range of frequencies smaller than both the characteristic turn-over\nfrequency and the damping rate of the flow. By studying the statistical\nproperties of sojourn time in each polarity of $U_L$, we demonstrate that the\n$1/f^{\\alpha}$ noise is generated by a renewal process, defined by a two-state\nmodel given by the polarities of the large scale circulation. The statistical\nproperties of this renewal process are shown to control the value of the\nexponent $\\alpha$.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of $1/f$ fluctuations in three\ndifferent turbulent flow configurations: the large scale velocity driven by a\ntwo-dimensional turbulent flow, the magnetic field generated by a turbulent\nswirling flow of liquid sodium and the pressure fluctuations due to vorticity\nfilaments in a swirling flow. For these three systems, $1/f$ noise is shown to\nresult from the dynamics of coherent structures that display transitions\nbetween a small number of states. The interevent duration is distributed as a\npower-law. The exponent of this power-law and the nature of the dynamics\n(transition between symmetric states or asymmetric ones) select the exponent of\nthe $1/f$ fluctuations.\n", "  If high-energy neutrinos propagate in a background of ultralight scalar field\nparticles of dark matter ($m_\\varphi \\sim 10^{-23}$eV), neutrino-dark matter\ninteractions can play a role and affect the neutrino flux. In this work we\nanalyse this effect using transport equations that account for the neutrino\nregeneration as well as absorption, and we consider the neutrino flux\npropagation in the extragalactic medium and also through the galactic halo of\ndark matter. We show the results for the final flux to arrive on Earth for\ndifferent cases of point and diffuse neutrino fluxes. {We conclude that this\ntype of neutrino interactions with ultralight scalar particles as dark matter\ncan yield very different results in the neutrino flux and in the flavor ratios\nthat can be measured in neutrino detectors such as IceCube.\n", "  We introduce a new numerical strategy to solve a class of oscillatory\ntransport PDE models which is able to captureaccurately the solutions without\nnumerically resolving the high frequency oscillations {\\em in both space and\ntime}.Such PDE models arise in semiclassical modeling of quantum dynamics with\nband-crossings, and otherhighly oscillatory waves. Our first main idea is to\nuse the nonlinear geometric optics ansatz, which builds theoscillatory phase\ninto an independent variable. We then choose suitable initial data, based on\nthe Chapman-Enskog expansion, for the new model. For a scalar model, we prove\nthat so constructed model will have certain smoothness, and consequently, for a\nfirst order approximation scheme we prove uniform error estimates independent\nof the (possibly small) wave length. The method is extended to systems arising\nfrom a semiclassical model for surface hopping, a non-adiabatic quantum dynamic\nphenomenon. Numerous numerical examples demonstrate that the method has the\ndesired properties.\n", "  In this thesis we investigate several topics in neutrino physics, with an em-\nphasis on the phenomenology of the sterile neutrinos. We study the existence of\na light sterile neutrino within the so called 3+1 scenario using the data of\nthe medium baseline reactor experiments. We will also probe the parameters of\nthe Large Extra Dimension model with the high energy atmospheric data of the\nIceCube experiment, and will find an equivalence between the Kaluza Klein modes\nand the sterile neutrinos. We will study the secret interaction of the ster-\nile neutrinos which is proposed to solve the tension between cosmology and the\nsterile neutrino hypothesis. In addition to these, we will show that a minimal\n2-Higgs-Doublet-Model extended with a U(1) or Z_2 symmetry cannot explain the\nsmallness of the neutrino masses.\n", "  ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) modeling methodology was adopted for\npredicting mechanical properties of aluminum cast composite materials. For this\npurpose aluminum alloy were developed using conventional foundry method. The\ncomposite materials have complex nature which posses the nonlinear relationship\namong heat treatment, processing parameters, and composition and affects their\nmechanical properties. These nonlinear relation ships with properties can more\nefficiently be modeled by ANNs. Neural networks modeling needs sufficient data\nbase consisting of mechanical properties, chemical composition and processing\nparameters. Such data base is not available for modeling. Therefore, a large\nrange of experimental work was carried out for the development of aluminum\ncomposite materials. Alloys containing Cu, Mg and Zn as matrix were reinforced\nwith 1- 15% Al2O3 particles using stir casting method. Alloys composites were\ncast in a metal mold. More than eighty standard samples were prepared for\ntensile tests. Sixty samples were given solution treatments at 580oC for half\nan hour and tempered at 120oC for 24 hours. The samples were characterized to\ninvestigate mechanical properties using Scanning Electron Microscope, X-Ray\nSpectrometer, Optical Metallurgical Microscope, Vickers Hardness, Universal\nTesting Machine and Abrasive Wear Testing Machine. A MLP (Multilayer\nPerceptron) feedforward was developed and used for modeling purpose. Training,\ntesting and validation of the model were carried out using back propagation\nlearning algorithm. The modeling results show that an architecture of 14 inputs\nwith 9 hidden neurons and 4 outputs which includes the tensile strength,\nelongation, hardness and abrasive wear resistance gives reasonably accurate\nresults with an error within the range of 2-7 % in training, testing and\nvalidation.\n", "  Anionic surfactants based on fatty acids are usually used to modify the\nparticle surface properties of CaCO$_3$ with the aim to enhance its dispersion\nand compatibility with polymer matrices. In this study sodium oleate was used\nfor the preparation of ultra-hydrophobic CaCO$_3$ nanoparticles using a wet\ncarbonation route. The effect of sodium oleate on the characteristics, particle\nsize, morphology, surface potential, thermal decomposition and hydrophobicity\nof CaCO$_3$, was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform\ninfrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Zeta\npotential, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and water contact angle measurement\n(WCA). The results showed that the addition of 2 wt% sodium oleate helps in\nreducing the particle size from 2 {\\mu}m length scalenohedral particles to 45\nnm rhombohedral particles and modifying of the hydrophobic property of\nCaCO$_3$.\n", "  A new formulation of perturbation theory for a description of the Dirac and\nscalar fields (the Yukawa model) is suggested. As the main approximation the\nself-consistent field model is chosen, which allows in a certain degree to\naccount for the effects caused by the interaction of fields. Such choice of the\nmain approximation leads to a normally ordered form of the interaction\nHamiltonian. Generation of the fermion mass due to the interaction with\nexchange of the scalar boson is investigated. It is demonstrated that, for zero\nbare mass, the fermion can acquire mass only if the coupling constant exceeds\nthe critical value determined by the boson mass. In this connection, the\nproblem of the neutrino mass is discussed.\n", "  High density polyethylene surfaces were exposed to the atmospheric\npost-discharge of a radiofrequency plasma torch supplied in helium and oxygen.\nDynamic water contact angle measurements were performed to evaluate changes in\nsurface hydrophilicity and angle resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was\ncarried out to identify the functional groups responsible for wettability\nchanges and to study their subsurface depth profiles, up to 9 nm in depth. The\nreactions leading to the formation of C-O, C=O and O-C=O groups were simulated\nby molecular dynamics. These simulations demonstrate that impinging oxygen\natoms do not react immediately upon impact but rather remain at or close to the\nsurface before eventually reacting. The simulations also explain the release of\ngaseous species in the ambient environment as well as the ejection of low\nmolecular weight oxidized materials from the surface.\n", "  Among various surface modification techniques, plasma can be used as a source\nfor tailoring the surface properties of diverse materials. HDPE and\nfluoropolymer surfaces have been treated by the post-discharge of an\natmospheric RF-plasma torch supplied with helium and oxygen gases. The\nplasma-treated surfaces were characterized by measurements of mass losses,\nwater contact angles, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force\nmicroscopy. This experimental approach correlated with an optical\ncharacterization of the plasma phase allowed us to propose etching mechanisms\noccurring at the post-discharge/polymer interface. We discuss how competitive\nand synergistic effects can result from the oxidation and/or the roughening of\nthe surface but also from the excimer VUV radiation, the He metastable species\nand the O radicals reaching the plasma-polymer interface.\n", "  A model is presented for the gravity-driven flow of rainwater descending\nthrough the soil layer of a green roof, treated as a porous medium on a flat\npermeable surface representing an efficient drainage layer. A fully saturated\nzone is shown to occur. It is typically a thin layer, relative to the total\nsoil thickness, and lies at the bottom of the soil layer. This provides a\nbottom boundary condition for the partially saturated upper zone. It is shown\nthat after the onset of rainfall, well-defined fronts of water can descend\nthrough the soil layer. Also the rainwater flow is relatively quick compared\nwith the moisture uptake by the roots of the plants in the roof. In separate\nmodels the exchanges of water are described between the (smaller-scale) porous\ngranules of soil, the roots and the rainwater in the inter-granule pores.\n", "  Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) has emerged as an excellent 2D model\nsystem because of its two inequivalent, direct-gap valleys that lead to exotic\nbound and excited states. Here we focus on one such bound state, the negatively\ncharged trion. Unlike excitons, trions can radiatively decay with non-zero\nmomentum by kicking out an electron, resulting in an asymmetric trion\nphotoluminescence (PL) peak with a long low-energy tail. As a consequence, the\npeak position does not correspond to the zero momentum trion energy. By\nincluding the trion's long tail in our analysis we are able to accurately\nseparate the exciton from the trion contributions to the PL spectra. According\nto theory, the asymmetric energy tail has both a size-dependent and a\ntemperature-dependent contribution. Analysis of the temperature-dependent data\nreveals the effective trion size, consistent with literature, and the\ntemperature dependence of the band gap and spin-orbit splitting of the valence\nband. Finally, we observe signatures of Pauli-blocking of the trion decay.\n", "  We show experimentally that a cheap glass microcapillary can accumulate\n{\\lambda}-phage DNA at its tip and deliver the DNA into the capillary using a\ncombination of electro-osmotic flow, pressure-driven flow, and electrophoresis.\nWe develop an efficient simulation model for this phenomenon based on the\nelectrokinetic equations and the finite-element method. Using our model, we\nexplore the large parameter space of the trapping mechanism by varying the salt\nconcentration, the capillary surface charge, the applied voltage, the pressure\ndifference, and the mobility of the analyte molecules. Our simulation results\nshow that this system can be tuned to capture a wide range of analyte\nmolecules, such as DNA or proteins, based on their electrophoretic mobility.\nOur method for separation and pre-concentration of analytes has implications\nfor the development of low-cost lab-on-a-chip devices.\n", "  The astronomical results contained in this publication represent a\ncontinuation of previous work of the United States Naval Observatory Six-inch\nand Seven-inch transit circles. The results are also the last from United\nStates Naval Observatory transit circles, since those instruments are no longer\nin service.\n  For the W1J00, we present the results of observations made with the Six-inch\nTransit Circle in Washington, D.C., between September 1977 and July 1982. The\ncatalog, called W1J00, contains mean positions of 7267 stars, all but five are\nnorth of -30 degrees declination, and 4383 observations of solar system\nobjects. Positions of stars are for mean epoch of observation, on equator and\nequinox J2000.0. Positions of solar system objects are apparent places. Error\nestimates are about 100 mas per coordinate for the majority of stars.\n  For the W2J00, we present the results of observations made with the Six-inch\nTransit Circle in Washington, D.C. and the Seven-inch Transit Circle at the\nBlack Birch station near Blenheim, New Zealand between April 1985 and February\n1996. The catalog, called W2J00, contains mean positions of 44,395 globally\ndistributed stars, 5048 observations of the planets, and 6518 observations of\nthe brighter minor planets. Positions of stars are for mean epoch of\nobservation, on equator and equinox J2000.0. Positions of solar system objects\nare apparent places. Error estimates are about 75 mas per coordinate for the\nmajority of stars.\n", "  This manual describes the usage and structure of FormFlavor, a\nMathematica-based tool for computing a broad list of flavor and CP observables\nin general new physics models. Based on the powerful machinery of FeynArts and\nFormCalc, FormFlavor calculates the one-loop Wilson coefficients of the\ndimension 5 and 6 Standard Model effective Lagrangian entirely from scratch.\nThese Wilson coefficients are then evolved down to the low scale using one-loop\nQCD RGEs, where they are transformed into flavor and CP observables. The last\nstep is accomplished using a model-independent, largely stand-alone package\ncalled FFObservables that is included with FormFlavor. The SM predictions in\nFFObservables include up-to-date references and accurate current predictions.\nUsing the functions and modular structure provided by FormFlavor, it is\nstraightforward to add new observables. Currently, FormFlavor is set up to\nperform these calculations for the general, non-MFV MSSM, but in principle it\ncan be generalized to arbitrary FeynArts models. FormFlavor and an up-to-date\nmanual can be downloaded from: http://formflavor.hepforge.org.\n", "  Spacecraft observations suggest that the plumes of Saturn's moon Enceladus\ndraw water from a subsurface ocean, but the sustainability of conduits linking\nocean and surface is not understood. Observations show sustained (though\ntidally modulated) fissure eruptions throughout each orbit, and since the 2005\ndiscovery of the plumes. Peak plume flux lags peak tidal extension by $\\sim$1\nradian, suggestive of resonance. Here we show that a model of the tiger stripes\nas tidally-flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain\nthe persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and\nthe total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that the\neruptions are maintained over geological timescales. The delay associated with\nflushing and refilling of \\emph{O}(1) m-wide slots with ocean water causes\nerupted flux to lag tidal forcing and helps to buttress slots against closure,\nwhile tidally pumped in-slot flow leads to heating and mechanical disruption\nthat staves off slot freeze-out. Much narrower and much wider slots cannot be\nsustained. In the presence of long-lived slots, the 10$^6$-yr average power\noutput of the tiger stripes is buffered by a feedback between ice melt-back and\nsubsidence to \\emph{O}(10$^{10}$) W, which is similar to the observed power\noutput, suggesting long-term stability. Turbulent dissipation makes testable\npredictions for the final flybys of Enceladus by the \\emph{Cassini} spacecraft.\nOur model shows how open connections to an ocean can be reconciled with, and\nsustain, long-lived eruptions. Turbulent dissipation in long-lived slots helps\nmaintain the ocean against freezing, maintains access by future Enceladus\nmissions to ocean materials, and is plausibly the major energy source for tiger\nstripe activity.\n", "  A recent mean-field approach to the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) is\nreviewed, with a special emphasis on the application to single-electron\ntunneling through a quantum dot in a high magnetic field. The theory is based\non the adiabatic principle of Greiter and Wilczek, which maps an incompressible\nstate in the integer QHE on the fractional QHE. The single-particle\ncontribution to the addition spectrum is analyzed, for a quantum dot with a\nparabolic confining potential. The spectrum is shown to be related to the\nFock-Darwin spectrum in the integer QHE, upon substitution of the electron\ncharge by the fractional quasiparticle charge. Implications for the periodicity\nof the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the conductance are discussed.\n", "  MSE is an 11.25m aperture observatory with a 1.5 square degree field of view\nthat will be fully dedicated to multi-object spectroscopy. More than 3200\nfibres will feed spectrographs operating at low (R ~ 2000 - 3500) and moderate\n(R ~ 6000) spectral resolution, and approximately 1000 fibers will feed\nspectrographs operating at high (R ~ 40000) resolution. MSE is designed to\nenable transformational science in areas as diverse as tomographic mapping of\nthe interstellar and intergalactic media; the in-situ chemical tagging of thick\ndisk and halo stars; connecting galaxies to their large scale structure;\nmeasuring the mass functions of cold dark matter sub-halos in galaxy and\ncluster-scale hosts; reverberation mapping of supermassive black holes in\nquasars; next generation cosmological surveys using redshift space distortions\nand peculiar velocities. MSE is an essential follow-up facility to current and\nnext generations of multi-wavelength imaging surveys, including LSST, Gaia,\nEuclid, WFIRST, PLATO, and the SKA, and is designed to complement and go beyond\nthe science goals of other planned and current spectroscopic capabilities like\nVISTA/4MOST, WHT/WEAVE, AAT/HERMES and Subaru/PFS. It is an ideal feeder\nfacility for E-ELT, TMT and GMT, and provides the missing link between wide\nfield imaging and small field precision astronomy. MSE is optimized for high\nthroughput, high signal-to-noise observations of the faintest sources in the\nUniverse with high quality calibration and stability being ensured through the\ndedicated operational mode of the observatory. (abridged)\n", "  We found an intrinsic redistribution of charge arises between epitaxial\ngraphene, which has intrinsically n-type doping, and an undoped substrate. In\nparticular, we studied in detail epitaxial graphene layers thermally elaborated\non C-terminated $4H$-$SiC$ ($4H$-$SiC$ ($000{\\bar{1}}$)). We have investigated\nthe charge distribution in graphene-substrate systems using Raman spectroscopy.\nThe influence of the substrate plasmons on the longitudinal optical phonons of\nthe $SiC$ substrates has been detected. The associated charge redistribution\nreveals the formation of a capacitance between the graphene and the substrate.\nThus, we give for the first time direct evidence that the excess negative\ncharge in epitaxial monolayer graphene could be self-compensated by the $SiC$\nsubstrate without initial doping. This induced a previously unseen\nredistribution of the charge-carrier density at the substrate-graphene\ninterface. There a quantum capacitor appears, without resorting to any\nintentional external doping, as is fundamentally required for epitaxial\ngraphene. Although we have determined the electric field existing inside the\ncapacitor and revealed the presence of a minigap ($\\approx 4.3meV$) for\nepitaxial graphene on $4H$-$SiC$ face terminated carbon, it remains small in\ncomparison to that obtained for graphene on face terminated $Si$. The\nfundamental electronic properties found here in graphene on $SiC$ substrates\nmay be important for developing the next generation of quantum technologies and\nelectronic/plasmonic devices.\n", "  This short document is intended as a companion and introduction to the\nDetailed Science Case (DSC) for the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer. It\nprovides a concise summary of the essential characteristics of MSE from the\nperspective of the international astronomical community. MSE is a wide field\ntelescope (1.5 square degree field of view) with an aperture of 11.25m. It is\ndedicated to multi-object spectroscopy at several different spectral\nresolutions in the range R ~ 2500 - 40000 over a broad wavelength range (0.36 -\n1.8{\\mu}m). MSE will enable transformational science in areas as diverse as\nexoplanetary host characterization; stellar monitoring campaigns; tomographic\nmapping of the interstellar and intergalactic media; the in-situ chemical\ntagging of the distant Galaxy; connecting galaxies to the large scale structure\nof the Universe; measuring the mass functions of cold dark matter sub-halos in\ngalaxy and cluster-scale hosts; reverberation mapping of supermassive black\nholes in quasars. MSE is the largest ground based optical and near infrared\ntelescope in its class, and it will occupy a unique and critical role in the\nemerging network of astronomical facilities active in the 2020s. MSE is an\nessential follow-up facility to current and next generations of\nmulti-wavelength imaging surveys, including LSST, Gaia, Euclid, eROSITA, SKA,\nand WFIRST, and is an ideal feeder facility for E-ELT, TMT and GMT.\n", "  In recent works, through observations of molecular lines, we found that the\nsupernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3 is interacting with a molecular cloud towards\nits southern edge. Also it has been proven the presence of several neighboring\nHII regions very likely located at the same distance as the remnant. The\npresence of dense molecular gas and the existence of shock fronts generated by\nthe SNR and HII regions make this region an interesting scenario to study the\npopulation of young stellar objects. Thus, using the most modern colour\ncriteria applied to the emission in the mid-infrared bands obtained from IRAC\nand MIPS on board Spitzer, we characterized all the point sources lying in this\nregion. We analyzed the spectral energy distributions of sources that show\nsigns of being young stellar objects in order to confirm their nature and\nderive stellar parameters. Additionally, we present a map of the $^{12}$CO\nJ=3-2 emission obtained with the ASTE telescope towards one of the HII regions\nembedded in the molecular cloud. The molecular gas was studied with the aim to\nanalyze whether the cloud is a potential site of star formation.\n", "  We put forward an effective amplification protocol for protecting the\nsingle-photon multi-mode W state of the time-bin qubit. The protocol only\nrelies on linear optical elements, such as the $50:50$ beam splitters, variable\nbeam splitters with the transmission of $t$ and the polarizing beam splitters.\nOnly one pair of the single-photon multi-mode W state and some auxiliary single\nphotons are required, and the fidelity of the single-photon multi-mode W state\ncan be increased under $t<\\frac{1}{2}$. The encoded time-bin information can be\nperfectly contained. Our protocol is quite simple and economical, and it can be\nrealized under current experimental condition. Based on above features, it may\nbe useful in current and future quantum information processing.\n", "  Due to the large free surface and strong anisotropy, the mechanical property\nof nanowire differs from its bulk counterpart. In this paper, the strong\ndependence of NW's strength on its surface orientation is revealed, and two\nmodes of dislocation nucleation have been identified: the corner nucleation and\nthe surface nucleation. The activation energy and activation volume of surface\nnucleation are much larger than those of the corner nucleation. The\nintersection line between lateral surface and {111}-type slip plane causes the\ndiscrepancy of the nucleation modes for the first dislocation.\n", "  Harmonic oscillator coherent states are well known to be the analogue of\nclassical states. On the other hand, nonlinear and generalised coherent states\nmay possess nonclassical properties. In this article, we study the nonclassical\nbehaviour of nonlinear coherent states for generalised classes of models\ncorresponding to the generalised ladder operators. A comparative analysis among\nthem indicates that the models with quadratic spectrum are more nonclassical\nthan the others. Our central result is further underpinned by the comparison of\nthe degree of nonclassicality of squeezed states of the corresponding models.\n", "  Atomic coherence effects arising from coherent light-atom interaction are\nconventionally known to be governed by quantum interference and optical pumping\nmechanisms. However, anisotropic nonlinear response driven by optical field\ninvolves another fundamental effect arising from closed-loop multiphoton\ntransitions. This closed-loop phase dictates the tensorial structure of the\nnonlinear susceptibility as it governs the principal coordinate system in\ndetermining, whether the light field will either compete or cooperate with the\nexternal magnetic field stimulus. Such a treatment provides deeper\nunderstanding of all magneto-optical anisotropic response. The magneto-optical\nresponse in all atomic systems is classified using closed-loop phase. The role\nof quantum interference in obtaining electromagnetically induced transparency\nor electromagnetically induced absorption in multi-level systems is identified.\n", "  In this paper, a quantum version of classical alternating bit protocol is\nproposed. This protocol provides a reliable method to transmit the secret\nquantum data via a noisy quantum channel while the entanglement between\nparticles is not broken. Our protocol is based on quantum teleportation and\nsuperdense coding. By assuming that the participants can distinguish the\nalternating qubit from other messages and also the assumption that data can be\nresent unlimited times, an abstraction of this protocol can be derived. Using\nthe quantum process algebra \\textit{full} $qACP$, we show that the proposed\nprotocol is correct, so the desired external behaviour of the protocol is\nguaranteed.\n", "  We report in situ LA-ICP-MS trace element analyses of silicate phases in\nolivine-bearing chondrules in the Sahara 97096 (EH3) enstatite chondrite. Most\nolivine and enstatite present rare earth element (REE) patterns comparable to\ntheir counterparts in type I chondrules in ordinary chondrites. They thus\nlikely share a similar igneous origin, likely under similar redox conditions.\nThe mesostasis however frequently shows negative Eu and/or Yb (and more rarely\nSm) anomalies, evidently out of equilibrium with olivine and enstatite. We\nsuggest that this reflects crystallization of oldhamite during a sulfidation\nevent, already inferred by others, during which the mesostasis was molten,\nwhere the complementary positive Eu and Yb anomalies exhibited by oldhamite\nwould have possibly arisen due to a divalent state of these elements. Much of\nthis igneous oldhamite would have been expelled from the chondrules, presumably\nby inertial acceleration or surface tension effects, and would have contributed\nto the high abundance of opaque nodules found outside them in EH chondrites. In\ntwo chondrules, olivine and enstatite exhibit negatively sloped REE patterns,\nwhich may be an extreme manifestation of a general phenomenon (possibly linked\nto near-liquidus partitioning) underlying the overabundance of light REE\nobserved in most chondrule silicates relative to equilibrium predictions. The\nsilicate phases in one of these two chondrules show complementary Eu, Yb and Sm\nanomalies providing direct evidence for the postulated occurrence of the\ndivalent state for these elements at some stage in the formation reservoir of\nenstatite chondrites. Our work supports the idea that the peculiarities of\nenstatite chondrites may not require a condensation sequence at high C/O ratios\nas has long been believed.\n", "  This study provides a new insight into the processes which occur when thin\nfilm hydrogenated amorphous silicon is subjected to UV laser irradiation in the\npresence of oxygen. It achieves this by observing the effects of subjecting the\nfilms to progressively increasing laser radiation doses. This reveals that an\narray of nuclei is first created, leading to the formation of a well-defined\ncrystalline network, consistent with the structure of silicon oxide. Further\nirradiation results in the formation of cone-like structures on the crystalline\nnetwork, due to silicon-oxygen bond breakage and migration of the resultant\nsilicon-rich material. Eventually the cone-like structures become the dominant\nfeatures, but remain interconnected by nanowire remnants of the original\ncrystalline structure.\n", "  We investigate the structure of the O-type binary system HD 48099 by\nmeasuring linear polarization that arises due to light scattering process.\n  Linear polarization measurements of HD 48099 in the B, V and R passbands with\nthe high-precision Dipol-2 polarimeter have been carried out. The data have\nbeen obtained with the 60 cm KVA (Observatory Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma,\nSpain) and T60 (Haleakala, Hawaii, USA) remotely controlled telescopes during\n31 observing nights. Polarimetry in the optical wavelengths has been\ncomplemented by observations in the X-rays with the SWIFT space observatory.\n  Optical polarimetry revealed small intrinsic polarization in HD 48099 with\n0.1% peak to peak variation over the orbital period of 3.08 days. The\nvariability pattern is typical for binary systems, showing strong second\nharmonic of the orbital period. We apply our model code for the electron\nscattering in the circumstellar matter to put constraints on the system\ngeometry. A good model fit is obtained for scattering of light on a cloud\nproduced by the colliding stellar winds. The geometry of the cloud, with a\nbroad distribution of scattering particles away from the orbital plane, helps\nin constraining the (low) orbital inclination. We derive from the polarization\ndata the inclination i = 17 deg +/- 2deg and the longitude of the ascending\nnode Omega = 82 deg +/- 1 deg of the binary orbit. The available X-ray data\nprovide additional evidence for the existence of the colliding stellar winds in\nthe system. Another possible source of the polarized light could be scattering\nfrom the stellar photospheres. The models with circumstellar envelopes, or\nmatter confined to the orbital plane, do not provide good constraints on the\nlow inclination, better than i < 27 deg, as is already suggested by the absence\nof eclipses.\n", "  Ludvig V. Lorenz (1829-1891) was Denmark's first theoretical physicist and\nthe only one whose work attracted international attention in the second half of\nthe nineteenth century. This paper presents a survey of Lorenz's contributions\nto physics with an emphasis on his work in electrodynamics and electrical\nscience. His 1867 electrodynamic theory of light was of a theoretical and\nfoundational nature, while his unpublished theory of telephone currents was\noriented toward practical problems in long-distance telephony. Lorenz's\ntheories are briefly compared to those of better known physicists such as H. A.\nLorentz, J. C. Maxwell, and O. Heaviside.\n", "  A numerical matrix methodology is applied to quantum problems with periodic\npotentials. The procedure consists essentially in replacing the true potential\nby an alternative one, restricted by an infinite square well, and in expressing\nthe wave functions as finite superpositions of eigenfunctions of the infinite\nwell. A matrix eigenvalue equation then yields the energy levels of the\nperiodic potential within an acceptable accuracy. The methodology has been\nsuccessfully used to deal with problems based on the well-known Kronig-Penney\n(KP) model. Besides the original model, these problems are a dimerized KP\nsolid, a KP solid containing a surface, and a KP solid under an external field.\nA short list of additional problems that can be solved with this procedure is\npresented.\n", "  We introduce a reshuffled approach to empirical analyze signs' organization\nin real directed signed social networks of Epinions and Slashdots from the\nglobal viewpoint. In the reshuffled approach, each negative link has\nprobability $p_{rs}$ to exchange its sign with another positive link chosen\nrandomly. Through calculating the entropies of social status ($S_{in}$ and\n$S_{out}$) of and mimicking opinion formation of the majority-rule model on\neach reshuffled signed network, we find that $S_{in}$ and $S_{out}$ reach their\nown minimum values as well as the magnetization $|m^{*}|$ reaches its maximum\nvalue at $p_{rs}=0$. Namely, individuals share the homogeneous properties of\nsocial status and dynamic status in real directed signed social networks. Our\npresent work provides some interesting tools and perspective to understand the\nsigns' organization in signed social networks.\n", "  We present a fast and robust alternative method to compute covariance matrix\nin case of cosmology studies. Our method is based on the jackknife resampling\napplied on simulation mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock\ncatalogues as a reference, we find that the jackknife technique gives a similar\ngalaxy clustering covariance matrix estimate by requiring a smaller number of\nmocks. A comparison of convergence rates show that $\\sim$7 times fewer\nsimulations are needed to get a similar accuracy on variance. We expect this\ntechnique to be applied in any analysis where the number of available N-body\nsimulations is low.\n", "  Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the\nfield of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a\nlarger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I\n", "  The physics learning is very important to techniques teaching and the\nengineers upbringing. However, there is evidence that science classes from\nelementary school through to university are generally failing to provide most\nstudents with an understanding of physics We have explored the use of a novel\naspect of information technology: interactive simulations to learning of\nenergys concepts. This way, students can construct their understanding through\nsemi-guided exploration. Research has shown this process to be an effective and\nengaging way to learn.\n", "  High pressure experiments in diamond anvil cells as well as in geophysics\nshow that at certain discrete values of pressure abrupt changes of the mass\ndensity and changes of the material structure occur. The aim of this paper is\nto discuss the influence of high external pressure on atoms and molecules using\nthe $3D$ square well potential as a simple solvable quantum mechanical example.\nValues of external pressure needed for a transition between energy levels with\ndifferent values of the main quantum number $n$, as well as the pressure needed\nto expel the particle from this system are calculated. In both cases discrete\nvalues of pressure are obtained.\n", "  We present two new constructions of quantum hash functions: the first based\non expander graphs and the second based on extractor functions and estimate the\namount of randomness that is needed to construct them. We also propose a keyed\nquantum hash function based on extractor function that can be used in quantum\nmessage authentication codes and assess its security in a limited attacker\nmodel.\n", "  The present article provides an overview of the recent progress in the direct\nforce measurements between individual pairs of colloidal particles in aqueous\nsalt solutions. Results obtained by two different techniques are being\nhighlighted, namely with the atomic force microscope (AFM) and optical\ntweezers. One finds that the classical theory of Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and\nOverbeek (DLVO) represents an accurate description of the force profiles even\nin the presence of multivalent ions, typically down to distances of few\nnanometers. However, the corresponding Hamaker constants and diffuse layer\npotentials must be extracted from the force profiles. At low salt\nconcentrations, double layer forces remain repulsive and may become long\nranged. At short distances, additional short range non-DLVO interactions may\nbecome important. Such an interaction is particularly relevant in the presence\nof multivalent counterions.\n", "  Much of our current understanding of neutral, atomic gas in galaxies comes\nfrom radio observations of the nearby Universe. Until the next generation of\ninstruments allow us to push to much higher redshifts, we must rely mostly upon\ntheoretical models of galaxy formation to provide us with key insights into the\nlikely cosmic evolution of HI in the Universe, and its links to molecular\nclouds and star formation. In this work, we present a new set of methods to\nconvert mock galaxy catalogues into synthetic data cubes containing model\ngalaxies with realistic spatial and spectral HI distributions over large\ncosmological volumes. Such synthetic data products can be used to guide\nobserving and data handling/analysis strategies for forthcoming HI galaxy\nsurveys. As a demonstration of the potential use of our simulated products we\nuse them to conduct several mock HI stacking experiments for both low and\nhigh-redshift galaxy samples. The stacked spectra can be accurately decomposed\ninto contributions from target and non-target galaxies, revealing in all\nco-added spectra large fractions of contaminant mass due to source confusion.\nOur results are consistent with similar estimates extrapolated from z=0\nobservational data. The amount of confused mass in a stacked spectrum grows\nalmost linearly with the size of the observational beam, suggesting potential\nover-estimates of Omega_HI by some recent HI stacking experiments. Our\nsimulations will allow the study of subtle redshift-dependent effects in future\nstacking analyses.\n", "  The ability to drive a system with an external input is a fundamental aspect\nof light-matter interaction. The coherent perfect absorption (CPA) phenomenon\nextends to the general multibeam interference phenomenology the well known\ncritical coupling concepts. This interferometric control of absorption can be\nemployed to reach full delivery of optical energy to nanoscale systems such as\nplasmonic nanoparticles, and multi-port interference can be used to enhance the\nabsorption of a nanoscale device when it is embedded in a strongly scattering\nsystem, with potential applications to nanoscale sensing. Here we review the\ntwo-port CPA in reference to photonic structures which can resonantly couple to\nthe external fields. A revised two-port theory of CPA is illustrated, which\nrelies on the Scattering Matrix formalism and is valid for all linear two-port\nsystems with reciprocity. Through a semiclassical approach, treating two-port\ncritical coupling conditions in a non-perturbative regime, it is demonstrated\nthat the strong coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed\ncoexist; in this situation, termed strong critical coupling, all the incoming\nenergy is converted into polaritons. Experimental results are presented, which\nclearly display the elliptical trace of absorption as function of input\nunbalance in a thin metallo-dielectric metamaterial, and verify polaritonic CPA\nin an intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. Concluding\nremarks discuss the future perspectives of CPA with photonic structures.\n", "  We use the Gutzwiller Density Functional Theory to calculate ground-state\nproperties and bandstructures of iron in its body-centered-cubic (bcc) and\nhexagonal-close-packed (hcp) phases. For a Hubbard interaction $U=9\\, {\\rm eV}$\nand Hund's-rule coupling $J=0.54\\, {\\rm eV}$ we reproduce the lattice\nparameter, magnetic moment, and bulk modulus of bcc iron. For these parameters,\nbcc is the ground-state lattice structure at ambient pressure up to a pressure\nof $p_{\\rm c}=41\\, {\\rm GPa}$ where a transition to the non-magnetic hcp\nstructure is predicted, in qualitative agreement with experiment ($p_{\\rm\nc}^{\\rm exp}=10\\ldots 15\\, {\\rm GPa}$). The calculated bandstructure for bcc\niron is in good agreement with ARPES measurements. The agreement improves when\nwe perturbatively include the spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  In this paper we discuss a mechanism for the dynamical generation of flavor\nmixing, in the framework of the Nambu--Jona Lasinio model. Our approach is\nillustrated both with the conventional operatorial formalism and with\nfunctional integral and ensuing one-loop effective action. The results obtained\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  We discuss the role of the internal forces and how their work changes the\nenergy of a system. We illustrate the contribution of the internal work to the\nvariation of the system's energy, using a pure mechanical example, a\nthermodynamical system and an example from electromagnetism. We emphasize that\ninternal energy variations related to the work of the internal forces should be\npinpointed in the classroom and placed on the same footing as other internal\nenergy variations such as those caused by temperature changes or by chemical\nreactions.\n", "  Focusing on the remnant black holes after merging binary black holes, we show\nthat ringdown gravitational waves of Population III binary black holes mergers\ncan be detected with the rate of $5.9-500~{\\rm events~yr^{-1}}~({\\rm SFR_p}/\n(10^{-2.5}~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}})) \\cdot ({\\rm [f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33})$\nfor various parameters and functions. This rate is estimated for the events\nwith SNR$>8$ for the second generation gravitational wave detectors such as\nKAGRA. Here, ${\\rm SFR_p}$ and ${\\rm f_b}$ are the peak value of the Population\nIII star formation rate and the fraction of binaries, respectively. When we\nconsider only the events with SNR$>35$, the event rate becomes $0.046-4.21~{\\rm\nevents~yr^{-1}}~({\\rm SFR_p}/ (10^{-2.5}~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}})) \\cdot\n({\\rm [f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33})$. This suggest that for remnant black hole's spin\n$q_f>0.95$ we have the event rate with SNR$>35$ less than $0.037~{\\rm\nevents~yr^{-1}}~({\\rm SFR_p}/ (10^{-2.5}~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}})) \\cdot\n({\\rm [f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33})$, while it is $3-30~{\\rm events~yr^{-1}}~({\\rm\nSFR_p}/ (10^{-2.5}~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}})) \\cdot ({\\rm\n[f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33})$ for the third generation detectors such as Einstein\nTelescope. If we detect many Population III binary black holes merger, it may\nbe possible to constrain the Population III binary evolution paths not only by\nthe mass distribution but also by the spin distribution.\n", "  Twisted supergravity is supergravity in a background where the bosonic ghost\nfield takes a non-zero value. This is the supergravity counterpart of the\nfamiliar concept of twisting supersymmetric field theories. In this paper, we\ngive conjectural descriptions of type IIA and IIB supergravity in $10$\ndimensions. Our conjectural descriptions are in terms of the closed-string\nfield theories associated to certain topological string theories, and we\nconjecture that these topological string theories are twists of the physical\nstring theories. For type IIB, the results of arXiv:1505.6703 show that our\ncandidate twisted supergravity theory admits a unique quantization in\nperturbation theory. This is despite the fact that the theories, like the\noriginal physical theories, are non-renormalizable. Although we do not prove\nour conjectures, we amass considerable evidence. We find that our candidates\nfor the twisted supergravity theories contain the residual supersymmetry one\nwould expect. We also prove (using heavily a result of Baulieu arXiv:1009.3893)\nthe open string version of our conjecture: the theory living on a brane in the\ntopological string theory is a twist of the maximally supersymmetric gauge\ntheory living on the brane in the physical string theory.\n", "  This paper presents 1463 times of minima for 455 objects acquired by 46\nmembers and cooperating observers of the Variable Star and Exoplanet Section of\nthe Czech Astronomical Society (B.R.N.O. Observing project). Observations were\ncarried out between October 2013 - September 2014. Some neglected southern\neclipsing binaries and newly discovered stars by the observers of project\nB.R.N.O. are included in the list.\n", "  A theory of diffusion-controlled intramolecular reactions of polymer chain in\ndilute solution is formulated. Our model is based on the widely used\ndiffusion-reaction formalism of Wilemski and Fixman (J. Chem. Phys. 60, 866\n(1974). Our model is more general than the model proposed by Wilemski and\nFixman, in the sense that our model considers the motion of both close and open\nchain polymer explicitely. It is quite unlikely that the motion of close chain\npolymer do not play any role in the loop formation dynamics, but unfortunately\nthis fact was not considered in any of the earlier studies.\n", "  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector, designed to\nrun at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its\ndistinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6-m-diameter\nby 12.5-m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10,000-ton return yoke made of\nconstruction steel. The return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered\nbarrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up\nto 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection\nsystem. To measure the field in and around the steel, a system of 22 flux loops\nand 82 3-D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks. A TOSCA 3-D\nmodel of the CMS magnet is developed to describe the magnetic field everywhere\noutside the tracking volume measured with the field-mapping machine. The\nmagnetic field description is compared with the measurements and discussed.\n", "  A finite element-based modal formulation of diffraction of a plane wave by an\nabsorbing photonic crystal slab of arbitrary geometry is developed for\nphotovoltaic applications. The semi-analytic approach allows efficient and\naccurate calculation of the absorption of an array with a complex unit cell.\nThis approach gives direct physical insight into the absorption mechanism in\nsuch structures, which can be used to enhance the absorption. The verification\nand validation of this approach is applied to a silicon nanowire array and the\nefficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated. The method is ideally\nsuited to studying the manner in which spectral properties (e.g., absorption)\nvary with the thickness of the array, and we demonstrate this with efficient\ncalculations which can identify an optimal geometry.\n", "  In a recent paper [Int. J. Quant. Chem. (2016) DOI: 10.1002/qua.25144,\narXiv:1502.06579] Markovich, Blau, Sanders, and Aspuru-Guzik presented a\nnumerical evaluation and comparison of three methods, Compressed Sensing (CS),\nSuper-Resolution (SR), and Filter Diagonalization (FDM), on their ability of\n\"recovering information\" from time signals, concluding that CS and RS\noutperform FDM. We argue that this comparison is invalid for the following\nreasons. FDM is a well established method designed for solving the harmonic\ninversion problem or, similarly, for the problem of spectral estimation, and as\nsuch should be applied only to problems of this kind. The authors incorrectly\nassume that the problem of data fitting is equivalent to the spectral\nestimation problem, regardless of what parametric form is used, and,\nconsequently, in all five numerical examples FDM is applied to the wrong\nproblem. Moreover, the authors' implementation of FDM turned out to be\nincorrect, leading to extremely bad results, caused by numerical instabilities.\nAs we demonstrate here, if implemented correctly, FDM could still be used for\nfitting the data, at least for the time signals composed of damped sinusoids,\nresulting in superior performance. In addition, we show that the published\narticle is full of inaccuracies, mistakes and incorrect statements.\n", "  In this paper we present a new paradigm for the identification of datasets\nextracted from the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre (VAMDC) e-science\ninfrastructure. Such identification includes information on the origin and\nversion of the datasets, references associated to individual data in the\ndatasets, as well as timestamps linked to the extraction procedure. This\nparadigm is described through the modifications of the language used to\nexchange data within the VAMDC and through the services that will implement\nthose modifications. This new paradigm should enforce traceability of datasets,\nfavour reproducibility of datasets extraction, and facilitate the systematic\ncitation of the authors having originally measured and/or calculated the\nextracted atomic and molecular data.\n", "  We reinvestigate the model originally studied by Neukirch and Marko that\ndescribes the extension, torque and supercoiling in single, stretched and\ntwisted DNA molecules, which consists of a mixture of extended and supercoiled\nstate, using now a more accurate form of the free energy for the untwisted but\nstretched DNA. The original model uses an approximate form of this free energy\nand the agreement with experiment is only qualitative. We find that this more\naccurate free energy significantly improves the results, bring them into\nquantitative agreement with experiment, throughout the entire force regime.\nThis is rather surprising, considering that the theory is completely\nparameter-free.\n", "  Efficient fiber-to-waveguide light coupling has been a key issue in\nintegrated photonics for many years. The main challenge lies in the huge mode\nmismatch between an optical fiber and a single mode waveguide. Herein, we\npresent a novel fiber-to-waveguide coupler, named \"L-coupler\", through which\nthe light fed from the top of a chip can bend 90{\\deg} with low reflection and\nis then efficiently coupled into an on-chip Si waveguide within a short\npropagation distance (<20{\\mu}m). The key element is a bent metal-clad\nwaveguide with a big matched input port. According to our finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) simulation, the coupling efficiency is over 80% within a\nbroad range of working wavelengths in the near-infrared regime for a transverse\nelectric input Gaussian wave. The coupler is polarization-dependent, with very\nlow coupling efficiency (6%-9%) for transverse magnetic waves. The coupler can\nalso be used for three-dimensional (3D) chip-to-chip optical interconnection by\nefficiently coupling light into an integrated photonic chip from a\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), or Si waveguide on another\nchip. The work presented in this Arxiv article has been filed as a patent.\nDetailed description of this work may be published in future papers.\n", "  Entanglement is not only fundamental for understanding multipartite quantum\nsystems but also generally useful for quantum information applications. Despite\nmuch effort devoted so far, little is known about minimal resources for\ndetecting entanglement and also comparisons to tomography which reveals the\nfull characterization. Here, we show that all entangled states can in general\nbe detected in an experimental scheme that estimates the fidelity of two pure\nquantum states. An experimental proposal is presented with a single\nHong-Ou-Mandel interferometry in which only two detectors are applied\nregardless of the dimensions or the number of modes of quantum systems. This\nshows measurement settings for entanglement detection are in general\ninequivalent to tomography: the number of detectors in quantum tomography\nincreases with the dimensions and the modes whereas it is not the case in\nestimation of fidelity which detects entangled states.\n", "  We review the main observational properties of neutron star low mass\ntransients in quiescence. We first survey the discoveries of BeppoSAX. We then\nfocus on recent discoveries by Chandra and XMM-Newton, with special emphsasis\non the detection of the quiescent counterpart of SAX J1808.4-3658 and the study\nof variability in the quiescent state.\n"]}
