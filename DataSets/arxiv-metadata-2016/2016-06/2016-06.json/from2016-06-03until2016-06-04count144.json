In order to put constraints on their bispectra, a logical\nfirst step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the\nrecently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral\ndomain. We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory\nbispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of orthonormal mode\nfunctions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the\noriginal spectrum as a function of their frequency. To reduce the number of\nmodes required, we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions\northonormalized on the tetrahedral domain. We show that the use of Fourier mode\nfunctions instead of polynomial mode functions can lead to the necessary\nfactorizability with the use of only 1/5 of the total number of modes required\nto reconstruct the bispectra with polynomial mode functions. Moreover, from an\nobservational perspective, the expansion has unique signatures depending on the\norientation of the oscillation due to a resonance effect between the mode\nfunctions and the original spectrum. This effect opens the possibility to\nextract informa- tion about both the frequency of the bispectrum as well as its\nshape while considering only a limited number of modes. The resonance effect is\nindependent of the phase of the reconstructed bispectrum suggesting Fourier\nmode extraction could be an efficient way to detect oscillatory bispectra in\nthe data.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Seiberg-Witten equations on the product R x Y,\nwhere Y is a compact 3-manifold with boundary. Following the approach of\nSalamon and Wehrheim in the instanton case, we impose Lagrangian boundary\nconditions for the Seiberg- Witten equations. The resulting equations we obtain\nconstitute a nonlinear, nonlocal boundary value problem. We establish\nregularity, compactness, and Fredholm properties for the Seiberg- Witten\nequations supplied with Lagrangian boundary conditions arising from the\nmonopole spaces studied in [20]. This work therefore serves as an analytic\nfoundation for the construction of a monopole Floer theory for 3-manifolds with\nboundary.\n", "  Einstein's equations in a tetrad formulation are derived from a linear theory\nin flat spacetime with an asymmetric potential using free field gauge\ninvariance, local Lorentz invariance and universal coupling. The gravitational\npotential can be either covariant or contravariant and of almost any density\nweight. These results are adapted to produce universally coupled massive\nvariants of Einstein's equations, yielding two one-parameter families of\ndistinct theories with spin 2 and spin 0. The theories derived, upon fixing the\nlocal Lorentz gauge freedom, are seen to be a subset of those found by\nOgievetsky and Polubarinov some time ago using a spin limitation principle. In\nview of the stability question for massive gravities, the proven non-necessity\nof positive energy for stability in applied mathematics in some contexts is\nrecalled. Massive tetrad gravities permit the mass of the spin 0 to be heavier\nthan that of the spin 2, as well as lighter than or equal to it, and so provide\nphenomenological flexibility that might be of astrophysical or cosmological\nuse.\n", "  A Lie-group based similarity theory is developed for both momentum and energy\ndistributions in a turbulent pipe flow, leading to asymptotic logarithmic\nprofiles of mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. Both channel and pipe\ndata over a wide range of Re yield 0.45 to be the universal Karman constant. A\nnew spatial invariant characterizing outer dynamics is discovered and validated\nby reliable experimental data. The theory predicts the mean velocity profile\n(MVP) with 99% accuracy for high Re experimental data (up to 40 millions), and\noffers a quantitative explanation for recent observation of logarithmic kinetic\nenergy distribution by Hullmak et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 094501).\n", "  A disk-shaped universe (encompassing the observable universe) rotating\nglobally with an angular speed equal to the Hubble constant is postulated. It\nis shown that dark energy and dark matter are cosmic inertial effects resulting\nfrom such a cosmic rotation, corresponding to centrifugal (dark energy), and a\ncombination of centrifugal and the Coriolis forces (dark matter), respectively.\nThe physics and the cosmological and galactic parameters obtained from the\nmodel closely match those attributed to dark energy and dark matter in the\nstandard {\\Lambda}-CDM model.\n", "  We report on a study of GS 1826--238 using all available {\\it RXTE}\nobservations, concentrating on the behavior of the hard X-rays during type-I\nbursts. We find a hard X-ray shortage at 30--50 keV promoted by the shower of\nsoft X-rays coming from type-I bursts. This shortage happens with a time delay\nafter the peak of the soft flux of 3.6 $\\pm$ 1.2 seconds.The behavior of hard\nX-rays during bursts indicates cooling and reheating of the corona, during\nwhich a large amount of energy is required. We speculate that this energy\noriginates from the feedback of the type-I bursts to the accretion process,\nresulting in a rapid temporary increase of the accretion rate.\n", "  The representation scheme ${\\tt rep}_n A$ of the 3-dimensional Sklyanin\nalgebra $A$ associated to a plane elliptic curve and n-torsion point contains\nsingularities over the augmentation ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$. We investigate the\nsemi-stable representations of the noncommutative blow-up algebra $B=A \\oplus\n\\mathfrak{m}t \\oplus\\mathfrak{m}^2 t^2 \\oplus ...$ to obtain a partial\nresolution of the central singularity ${\\tt proj} Z(B) \\rightarrow {\\tt spec}\nZ(A)$ such that the remaining singularities in the exceptional fiber determine\nan elliptic curve and are all of type $\\mathbb{C} \\times\n\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n", "  We are aiming to study the $J/\\psi \\to p\\bar{p}\\eta'$ decay in an isobar\nmodel and the effective Lagrangian approach. After a careful exploration of the\ncontributions of the $S_{11}(1535)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{13}(1900)$,\n$S_{11}(2090)$ and $P_{11}(2100)$ resonances, we conclude that either a\nsubthreshold resonance or a broad $P$-wave state in the near threshold range\nseems to be indispensable to describe present data of the $\\pi N \\to \\eta'N$.\nFurthermore, at least one broad resonance above $\\eta'N$ threshold is\npreferred. With this detailed analysis, we could give the invariant mass\nspectrum and Dalitz plot of the $J/\\psi \\to p\\bar{p}\\eta'$ decay for the\npurpose of assisting the future detailed partial wave analysis. It is found\nthat the $J/\\psi \\to p\\bar{p}\\eta'$ data are useful for disentangling the above\nor below threshold resonant contribution, though it still further needs the\ndifferential cross section data of $\\pi N \\to \\eta'N$ to realize some of the\nresonant and the non-resonant contribution. Our results are enlightening for\nthe $\\eta'N$ production mechanism and the properties of the nucleon resonances\nwith the mass around 2.0~GeV.\n", "  We discover that the way spin-waves exert magnetic torques in multiferroic\nmaterials can cause not only domain wall motion, but also magnetization\ndynamics for homogeneous magnetization textures. Interestingly, the domain wall\nmotion can be controlled via purely electrical means with the spin-waves being\ngenerated by an ac electric field $E$ while the direction of the wall motion\nalso is sensitive to an applied dc $E$ field. Moreover, we determine the\ninteraction between spin-transfer torque from an electric current and a\nmagnetic domain wall in multiferroics and show that the Walker breakdown\nthreshold scales with the magnitude of a perpendicular electric field, offering\na way to control the properties of domain wall propagation via electric gating.\n", "  We give two strengthenings of an inequality for the quantum conditional\nmutual information of a tripartite quantum state recently proved by Fawzi and\nRenner, connecting it with the ability to reconstruct the state from its\nbipartite reductions. Namely we show that the conditional mutual information is\nan upper bound on the regularised relative entropy distance between the quantum\nstate and its reconstructed version. It is also an upper bound for the measured\nrelative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version. The main\ningredient of the proof is the fact that the conditional mutual information is\nthe optimal quantum communication rate in the task of state redistribution.\n", "  We show that a useful connection exists between spontaneous parametric\ndownconversion (SPDC) and sum frequency generation in nonlinear optical\nwaveguides with arbitrary scattering loss, while the same does not hold true\nfor SPDC and difference frequency generation. This result deepens the\nrelationship between quantum and classical second-order nonlinear optical\nprocesses in waveguides, and identifies the most accurate characterization of\ntheir quantum performance in the presence of loss based solely on classical\nmeasurements.\n", "  A major challenge in neuroscience is posed by the need for relating the\nemerging dynamical features of brain activity with the underlying modular\nstructure of neural connections, hierarchically organized throughout several\nscales. The spontaneous emergence of coherence and synchronization across such\nscales is crucial to neural function, while its anomalies often relate to\npathological conditions. Here we provide a numerical study of synchronization\ndynamics in the human connectome network. Our purpose is to provide a detailed\ncharacterization of the recently uncovered broad dynamic regime, interposed\nbetween order and disorder, which stems from the hierarchical modular\norganization of the human connectome. In this regime -similar in essence to a\nGriffiths phase- synchronization dynamics are trapped within metastable\nattractors of local coherence. Here we explore the role of noise, as an\neffective description of external perturbations, and discuss how its presence\naccounts for the ability of the system to escape intermittently from such\nattractors and explore complex dynamic repertoires of locally coherent states,\nin analogy with experimentally recorded patterns of cerebral activity.\n", "  A large international effort is under way to assess the presence of a shadow\nin the radio emission from the compact source at the centre of our Galaxy,\nSagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$). If detected, this shadow would provide the first\ndirect evidence of the existence of black holes and that Sgr A$^*$ is a\nsupermassive black hole. In addition, the shape of the shadow could be used to\nlearn about extreme gravity near the event horizon and to determine which\ntheory of gravity better describes the observations. The mathematical\ndescription of the shadow has so far used a number of simplifying assumptions\nthat are unlikely to be met by the real observational data. We here provide a\ngeneral formalism to describe the shadow as an arbitrary polar curve expressed\nin terms of a Legendre expansion. Our formalism does not presume any knowledge\nof the properties of the shadow, e.g. the location of its centre, and offers a\nnumber of routes to characterize the distortions of the curve with respect to\nreference circles. These distortions can be implemented in a coordinate\nindependent manner by different teams analysing the same data. We show that the\nnew formalism provides an accurate and robust description of noisy\nobservational data, with smaller error variances when compared to previous\napproaches for the measurement of the distortion.\n", "  One strategy for reducing the online computational cost of matched-filter\nsearches for gravitational waves is to introduce a compressed basis for the\nwaveform template bank in a grid-based search. In this paper, we propose and\ninvestigate several tunable compression schemes for a general template bank.\nThrough offline compression, such schemes are shown to yield faster detection\nand localisation of signals, along with moderately improved sensitivity and\naccuracy over coarsened banks at the same level of computational cost. This is\npotentially useful for any search involving template banks, and especially in\nthe analysis of data from future space-based detectors such as eLISA, for which\nonline grid searches are difficult due to the long-duration waveforms and large\nparameter spaces.\n", "  We have performed two-dimensional special-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of non-equilibrium over-pressured relativistic jets in cylindrical\ngeometry. Multiple stationary recollimation shock and rarefaction structures\nare produced along the jet by the nonlinear interaction of shocks and\nrarefaction waves excited at the interface between the jet and the surrounding\nambient medium. Although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we have\nconsidered axial, toroidal and helical magnetic fields to investigate the\neffects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on the\nrecollimation structures. We find that an axial field introduces a larger\neffective gas-pressure and leads to stronger recollimation shocks and\nrarefactions, resulting in larger flow variations. The jet boost grows\nquadratically with the initial magnetic field. On the other hand, a toroidal\nfield leads to weaker recollimation shocks and rarefactions, modifying\nsignificantly the jet structure after the first recollimation rarefaction and\nshock. The jet boost decreases systematically. For a helical field, instead,\nthe behaviour depends on the magnetic pitch, with a phenomenology that ranges\nbetween the one seen for axial and toroidal magnetic fields, respectively. In\ngeneral, however, a helical magnetic field yields a more complex shock and\nrarefaction substructure close to the inlet that significantly modifies the jet\nstructure. The differences in shock structure resulting from different field\nconfigurations and strengths may have observable consequences for disturbances\npropagating through a stationary recollimation shock.\n", "  The possibility that mass ejected during Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nstellar evolution phases falls back towards the star has been suggested in\napplications ranging from the formation of accretion disks to the powering of\nlate-thermal pulses. In this paper, we seek to explicate the properties of\nfallback flow trajectories from mass-loss events. We focus on a transient phase\nof mass ejection with sub-escape speeds, followed by a phase of a typical AGB\nwind. We solve the problem using both hydrodynamic simulations and a simplified\none-dimensional analytic model that matches the simulations. For a given set of\ninitial wind characteristics, we find a critical shell velocity that\ndistinguishes between \"shell fallback\" and \"shell escape\". We discuss the\nrelevance of our results for both single and binary AGB stars. In particular,\nwe discuss how our results help to frame further studies of fallback as a\nmechanism for forming the substantial population of observed post-AGB stars\nwith dusty disks.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of the Hubbard model in the weak-coupling limit\nfor coexisting spin-density-wave order and spin-fluctuation-mediated\nsuperconductivity. Both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations\ncontribute significantly to the effective interaction potential, which creates\nCooper pairs of the quasi-particles of the antiferromagnetic metallic state. We\nfind a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave solution in both electron- and hole-doped\ncases. In the quasi-spin triplet channel, the longitudinal fluctuations give\nrise to an effective attraction supporting a $p$-wave gap, but are overcome by\nrepulsive contributions from the transverse fluctuations which disfavor\n$p$-wave pairing compared to $d_{x^2-y^2}$. The sub-leading pair instability is\nfound to be in the $g$-wave channel, but complex admixtures of $d$ and $g$ are\nnot energetically favored since their nodal structures coincide. Inclusion of\ninterband pairing, in which each fermion in the Cooper pair belongs to a\ndifferent spin-density-wave band, is considered for a range of electron dopings\nin the regime of well-developed magnetic order. We demonstrate that these\ninterband pairing gaps, which are non-zero in the magnetic state, must have the\nsame parity under inversion as the normal intraband gaps. The self-consistent\nsolution to the full system of five coupled gap equations give intraband and\ninterband pairing gaps of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ structure and similar gap magnitude. In\nconclusion, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap dominates for both hole and electron doping\ninside the spin-density-wave phase.\n", "  Light localization due to random imperfections in periodic media is paramount\nin photonics research. The group index is known to be a key parameter for\nlocalization near photonic band edges, since small group velocities reinforce\nlight interaction with imperfections. Here, we show that the size of the\nsmallest localized mode that is formed at the band edge of a one-dimensional\nperiodic medium is driven instead by the effective photon mass, i.e. the\nflatness of the dispersion curve. Our theoretical prediction is supported by\nnumerical simulations, which reveal that photonic-crystal waveguides can\nexhibit surprisingly small localized modes, much smaller than those observed in\nBragg stacks thanks to their larger effective photon mass. This possibility is\ndemonstrated experimentally with a photonic-crystal waveguide fabricated\nwithout any intentional disorder, for which near-field measurements allow us to\ndistinctly observe a wavelength-scale localized mode despite the smallness\n($\\sim 1/1000$ of a wavelength) of the fabrication imperfections.\n", "  Einstein's equations were derived for a free massless spin-$2$ field using\nuniversal coupling in the 1950-70s by various authors; total stress-energy\nincluding gravity's served as a source for linear free field equations. A\nmassive variant was likewise derived in the late 1960s by Freund, Maheshwari\nand Schonberg, and thought to be unique. How broad is universal coupling? In\nthe last decade four $1$-parameter families of massive spin-$2$ theories\n(contravariant, covariant, tetrad, and cotetrad of almost any density weights)\nhave been derived using universal coupling. The (co)tetrad derivations included\n2 of the 3 pure spin-$2$ theories due to de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley; those\ntwo theories first appeared in the $2$-parameter Ogievetsky-Polubarinov family\n(1965), which developed the symmetric square root of the metric as a nonlinear\ngroup realization. One of the two theories was identified as pure spin-$2$ by\nMaheshwari in 1971-2, thus evading the Boulware-Deser-Tyutin-Fradkin ghost by\nthe time it was announced. Unlike the previous 4 families, this paper permits\n_nonlinear_ field redefinitions to build the effective metric. By not insisting\nin advance on knowing the observable significance of the graviton potential to\nall orders, one finds that an _arbitrary_ graviton mass term can be derived\nusing universal coupling. The arbitrariness of a universally coupled\nmass/self-interaction term contrasts sharply with the uniqueness of the\nEinstein kinetic term. One might have hoped to use universal coupling as a\ntie-breaking criterion for choosing among theories that are equally\nsatisfactory on more crucial grounds (such as lacking ghosts and having a\nsmooth massless limit). But the ubiquity of universal coupling implies that the\ncriterion doesn't favor any particular theories among those with the Einstein\nkinetic term.\n", "  This paper studies short-range order (SRO) in the semiconductor alloy\n(GaN)$_{1-x}$(ZnO)$_x$. Monte Carlo simulations performed on a density\nfunctional theory (DFT)-based cluster expansion model show that the\nheterovalent alloys exhibit strong SRO because of the energetic preference for\nthe valence-matched nearest-neighbor Ga-N and Zn-O pairs. To represent the\nSRO-related structural correlations, we introduce the concept of Special\nQuasi-ordered Structure (SQoS). Subsequent DFT calculations reveal dramatic\ninfluence of SRO on the atomic, electronic and vibrational properties of the\n(GaN)$_{1-x}$(ZnO)$_x$ alloy. Due to the enhanced statistical presence of the\nenergetically unfavored Zn-N bonds with the strong Zn3$d$-N2$p$ repulsion, the\ndisordered alloys exhibit much larger lattice bowing and band-gap reduction\nthan those of the short-range ordered alloys. Inclusion of lattice vibrations\nstabilizes the disordered alloy.\n", "  We present next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative-QCD calculations of the\ncross sections for $\\ell N\\to h X$ and $\\ell N\\to \\mathrm{jet}\\, X$. The main\nfeature of these processes is that the scattered lepton is not observed, so\nthat the hard scale that makes them perturbative is set by the transverse\nmomentum of the hadron or jet. Kinematically, the two processes thus become\ndirect analogs of single-inclusive production in hadronic collisions which, as\nhas been pointed out in the literature, makes them promising tools for\nexploring transverse spin phenomena in QCD when the incident nucleon is\ntransversely polarized. We find that the NLO corrections are sizable for the\nspin-averaged cross section. We also investigate in how far the scattering is\ndominated by the exchange of almost real (Weizs\\\"{a}cker-Williams) photons. We\npresent numerical estimates of the cross sections for present-day fixed target\nexperiments and for a possible future electron ion collider.\n", "  We prove existence and regularity of minimizers for H\\\"older densities over\ngeneral surfaces of arbitrary dimension and codimension in \\(\\R^n \\),\nsatisfying a cohomological boundary condition, providing a natural dual to\nReifenberg's Plateau problem. We generalize and extend methods of Reifenberg,\nBesicovitch, and Adams, in particular we generalize a particular type of\nminimizing sequence used by Reifenberg (whose limits have nice properties,\nincluding lower bounds on lower density and finite Hausdorff measure,) prove\nsuch minimizing sequences exist, and develop cohomological spanning conditions.\nOur cohomology lemmas are dual versions of the homology lemmas in the\ncelebrated appendix by Adams found in Reifenberg's 1960 paper.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is central to many physical phenomena, including\nfine structures of atomic spectra and quantum topological matters. Whereas SOC\nis in general fixed in a physical system, atom-laser interaction provides\nphysicists a unique means to create and control synthetic SOC for ultracold\natoms \\cite{Dalibard}. Though significant experimental progresses have been\nmade, a bottleneck in current studies is the lack of a two-dimensional (2D)\nsynthetic SOC, which is crucial for realizing high-dimensional topological\nmatters. Here, we report the experimental realization of 2D SOC in ultracold\n$^{40}$K Fermi gases using three lasers, each of which dresses one atomic\nhyperfine spin state. Through spin injection radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy,\nwe probe the spin-resolved energy dispersions of dressed atoms, and observe a\nhighly controllable Dirac point created by the 2D SOC. Our work paves the way\nfor exploring high-dimensional topological matters in ultracold atoms using\nRaman schemes.\n", "  We determine the class of $p$-forms $F$ which possess vanishing scalar\ninvariants (VSI) at arbitrary order in a $n$-dimensional spacetime. Namely, we\nprove that $F$ is VSI if and only if it is of type N, its multiple null\ndirection $l$ is \"degenerate Kundt\", and $\\nabla_{l}F=0$. The result is\ntheory-independent. Next, we discuss the special case of Maxwell fields, both\nat the level of test fields and of the full Einstein-Maxwell equations. These\ndescribe electromagnetic non-expanding waves propagating in various Kundt\nspacetimes. We further point out that a subset of these solutions possesses a\nuniversal property, i.e., they also solve (virtually) any generalized\n(non-linear and with higher derivatives) electrodynamics, possibly also coupled\nto Einstein's gravity.\n", "  In the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, strong magnetic\nfields appear due to the large velocity of the colliding charges. The evolution\nof these fields appears as a novel and intriguing feature in the\nfluid-dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we study\nanalytically the one-dimensional, longitudinally boost-invariant motion of an\nideal fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Interestingly, we\nfind that, in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, i.e., for infinite\nconductivity, and irrespective of the strength of the initial magnetization,\nthe decay of the fluid energy density $e$ with proper time $\\tau$ is the same\nas for the time-honored \"Bjorken flow\" without magnetic field. Furthermore,\nwhen the magnetic field is assumed to decay $\\sim \\tau^{-a}$, where $a$ is an\narbitrary number, two classes of analytic solutions can be found depending on\nwhether $a$ is larger or smaller than one. In summary, the analytic solutions\npresented here highlight that the Bjorken flow is far more general than\nformerly thought. These solutions can serve both to gain insight on the\ndynamics of heavy-ion collisions in the presence of strong magnetic fields and\nas testbeds for numerical codes.\n", "  We propose the DHAC conceptual model of teacher preparation (Development of\nHabits through Apprenticeship in a Community), which builds on the contemporary\nliterature on teacher preparation in physics and other disciplines and strives\nto provide a better understanding of the process of teacher formation. Extant\nliterature on teacher preparation suggests that pre-service teachers learn best\nwhen they are immersed in a community that allows them to develop dispositions,\nknowledge, and practical skills and share with the community a strong vision of\nwhat good teaching entails. However, despite having developed the requisite\ndispositions, knowledge, and skills in pursuing the shared vision of good\nteaching, the professional demands on a teacher's time are so great out of and\nso complex during class time that if every decision requires multiple\nconsiderations and deliberations with oneself, the productive decisions might\nnot materialize. We therefore argue that the missing link between intentional\ndecision-making and actual teaching practice are the teacher's habits\n(spontaneous responses to situational cues). Teachers unavoidably develop\nhabits with practical experience and under the influence of knowledge and\nbelief structures that in many ways condition the responses of teachers in\ntheir practical work. To steer new teachers away from developing unproductive\nhabits directed towards \"survival\" instead of student learning, we argue that\nany teacher preparation program (e.g., physics) should strive to develop in\npre-service teachers strong habits of mind and practice that will serve as an\nunderlying support structure for beginning teachers. These habits form the core\nof the conceptual model described in the paper. We provide examples of habits,\nwhich physics teachers need to develop before starting teaching and propose\nmechanisms for the development of such habits.\n", "  To explore the origin of the Fermi level pinning in germanium we investigate\nthe Ge(001) and Ge(001):H surfaces. The absence of relevant surface states in\nthe case of Ge(001):H should unpin the surface Fermi level. This is not\nobserved. For samples with donors as majority dopants the surface Fermi level\nappears close to the top of the valence band regardless of the surface\nstructure. Surprisingly, for the passivated surface it is located below the top\nof the valence band allowing scanning tunneling microscopy imaging within the\nband gap. We argue that the well known electronic mechanism behind band bending\ndoes not apply and a more complicated scenario involving ionic degrees of\nfreedom is therefore necessary. Experimental techniques involve four point\nprobe electric current measurements, scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Using the relation between distance modulus $(m - M)$ and redshift $z$,\ndeduced from Friedman- Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and assuming different\nvalues of deceleration parameter $q_0$. We constrained the Hubble parameter\n$h$. The estimates of the Hubble parameters we obtained using the median values\nof the data obtained from NASA Extragalactic Database (NED), are: $h =\n0.7\\pm0.3$, for $q_0 = 0$, $h = 0.6\\pm0.3$, for $q_0 = 1$ and $h = 0.8\\pm0.3$ ,\nfor $q_0 = -1$. The corresponding age $\\tau$ and size $R$ of the observable\nuniverse were also estimated as: $\\tau = 15\\pm1$ $ Gyr$, $R = (5\\pm2) \\times\n10^3$ $Mpc$, $\\tau = 18\\pm1$ $Gyr$, $R=(6\\pm2)\\times 10^3$ $Mpc$ and\n$\\tau=13\\pm1$ $Gyr$, $R = (4 \\pm 2)\\times10^3$ $Mpc$ for $q_0 = 0$, $q_0 = 1$\nand $q_0 = -1$ respectively.\n", "  Recent developments of the nuclear emulsion technology led to the production\nof films with nanometric silver halide grains suitable to track low energy\nnuclear recoils with submicrometric length. This improvement opens the way to a\ndirectional Dark Matter detection, thus providing an innovative and\ncomplementary approach to the on-going WIMP searches. An important background\nsource for these searches is represented by neutron-induced nuclear recoils\nthat can mimic the WIMP signal. In this paper we provide an estimation of the\ncontribution to this background from the intrinsic radioactive contamination of\nnuclear emulsions. We also report the induced background as a function of the\nread-out threshold, by using a GEANT4 simulation of the nuclear emulsion,\nshowing that it amounts to about 0.06 neutrons per year per kilogram, fully\ncompatible with the design of a 10 kg$\\times$year exposure.\n", "  It was proposed that the electric fields may lead to chiral separation in\nQGP, which is called the chiral electric separation effect. The strong\nelectromagnetic field and the QCD vacuum can both completely be produced in the\noff-central nuclear-nuclear collision. We used the Wood-Saxon nucleon\ndistribution to calculate the electric field distributions of the off-central\ncollisions. The chiral electro field spatial distribution at Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energy regions are\nsystematically studied in this paper. Compared with magnetic field spatial\ndistribution, electric field shows some different features in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. The dependence of the electric field produced by the\nthermal quark in the central position with different impact parameters on the\nproper time with different collision energies in the RHIC and LHC energy region\nare studied in this paper.\n", "  We introduce an integrable, four-well ring model for bosons where the\ntunneling couplings between nearest-neighbour wells are not restricted to be\nequal. We show how the model may be derived through the Quantum Inverse\nScattering Method from a solution of the Yang--Baxter equation, and in turn\nsolved by algebraic Bethe Ansatz means. The model admits multiple pseudovaccum\nstates. Numerical evidence is provided to indicate that all pseudovacua are\nrequired to obtain a complete set of Bethe eigenstates. The model has the\nnotable property that there is a class of eigenstates which admit a simple,\nclosed-form energy expression.\n", "  Weak values allow the measurement of observables associated with noncommuting\noperators. Up to now, position-momentum weak values have been mainly developed\nfor (relativistic) photons. In this Letter, a proposal for the measurement of\nsuch weak values in typical electronic devices is presented. Inspired by the\nRamo-Shockley-Pellegrini theorem that provides a relation between current and\nelectron velocity, it is shown that the displacement current measured in\nmultiterminal configurations can provide either a weak measurement of the\nmomentum or strong measurement of position. This proposal opens new\nopportunities for fundamental and applied physics with state-of-the-art\nelectronic technology. As an example, a setup for the measurement of the\nBohmian velocity of (nonrelativistic) electrons is presented and tested with\nnumerical experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we assess the performance of four iterative algorithms for\nsolving non-symmetric rank-deficient linear systems arising in the FFT-based\nhomogenization of heterogeneous materials defined by digital images. Our\nframework is based on the Fourier-Galerkin method with exact and approximate\nintegrations that has recently been shown to generalize the Lippmann-Schwinger\nsetting of the original work by Moulinec and Suquet from 1994. It follows from\nthis variational format that the ensuing system of linear equations can be\nsolved by general-purpose iterative algorithms for symmetric positive-definite\nsystems, such as the Richardson, the Conjugate gradient, and the Chebyshev\nalgorithms, that are compared here to the Eyre-Milton scheme - the most\nefficient specialized method currently available. Our numerical experiments,\ncarried out for two-dimensional elliptic problems, reveal that the Conjugate\ngradient algorithm is the most efficient option, while the Eyre-Milton method\nperforms comparably to the Chebyshev semi-iteration. The Richardson algorithm,\nequivalent to the still widely used original Moulinec-Suquet solver, exhibits\nthe slowest convergence. Besides this, we hope that our study highlights the\npotential of the well-established techniques of numerical linear algebra to\nfurther increase the efficiency of FFT-based homogenization methods.\n", "  We use molecular simulations to study the nonadhesive and adhesive\natomic-scale contact of rough spheres with radii ranging from nanometers to\nmicrometers over more than ten orders of magnitude in applied normal load. At\nthe lowest loads, the interfacial mechanics is governed by the contact\nmechanics of the first asperity that touches. The dependence of contact area on\nnormal force becomes linear at intermediate loads and crosses over to Hertzian\nat the largest loads. By combining theories for the limiting cases of nominally\nflat rough surfaces and smooth spheres, we provide parameter-free analytical\nexpressions for contact area over the whole range of loads. Our results\nestablish a range of validity for common approximations that neglect curvature\nor roughness in modeling objects on scales from atomic force microscope tips to\nball bearings.\n", "  Magneto-electric effect in a multiferroic heterostructure film, i.e. a\ncoupled ferromagnetic-ferroelectric thin film, has been investigated through\nthe use of the Metropolis algorithm in Monte Carlo simulations. A classical\nHeisenberg model describes the energy stored in the ferromagnetic film, and we\nuse a pseudo-spin model with a transverse Ising Hamiltonian to characterise the\nenergy of electric dipoles in the ferroelectric film. The purpose of this\narticle is to demonstrate the dynamic response of polarisation is driven by an\nexternal magnetic field, when there is a linear magneto-electric coupling at\nthe interface between the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric components.\n", "  Materials harboring exotic quasiparticles, such as Dirac and Weyl\nfermions\\cite{xu2015discovery,borisenko2015time,weng2015weyl,xu2015observation},\nhave garnered much attention from the physics and material science communities.\nThese fermions are massless and, in some materials, have shown exceptional\nphysical properties such as ultrahigh mobility and extremely large\nmagnetoresistances\n\\cite{liang2015ultrahigh,ali2014large,du2015unsaturated,shekhar2015large}.\nRecently, new materials have been predicted to exist which exhibit line nodes\nof Dirac cones\n\\cite{PhysRevLett.115.036806,xie2015new,burkov2011topological,rhim2015landau}.\nHere, we show with angle resolved photoemission studies supported by \\textit{ab\ninitio} calculations that the highly stable, non-toxic and earth-abundant\nmaterial, ZrSiS, has an electronic band structure that hosts several Dirac\ncones which form a Fermi surface with a diamond-shaped line of Dirac nodes. We\nalso experimentally show, for the first time, that the square Si lattice in\nZrSiS is an excellent template for realizing the new types of 2D Dirac cones\nrecently predicted by Young and Kane \\cite{young2015dirac} and image an\nunforseen surface state that arises close to the 2D Dirac cone. Finally, we\nfind that the energy range of the linearly dispersed bands is as high as 2\\,eV\nabove and below the Fermi level; much larger than of any known Dirac material\nso far. This makes ZrSiS a very promising candidate to study the exotic\nbehavior of Dirac electrons, or Weyl fermions if a magnetic field is applied,\nas well as the properties of lines of Dirac nodes\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate the agreement of jet-veto resummation and pT\nresummation for explaining the WW cross sections at Run 1 of the LHC, and in\nthe future. These two resummation techniques resum different logarithms,\nhowever via reweighting methods they can be compared for various differential\nor exclusive cross sections. We find excellent agreement between the two\nresummation methods for predicting the zero-jet cross section, and propose a\nnew reweighting method for jet-veto resummation that can be used to compare\nother differential distributions. We advocate a cross-channel comparison for\nthe high-luminosity run of the LHC as both a test of QCD and new physics.\n", "  To capture various experimental results in the pseudogap regime of the\nunderdoped cuprate superconductors for temperature $T<T^{*}$, we propose a\nfour-component pair density wave (PDW) state, in which all components compete\nwith each other. Without random field disorders (RFD), only one of the PDW\ncomponents survives. If the RFD is included, this state could become phase\nseparated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components\ncoexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as\nsecondary composite orders. We call this phase-separated pair nematic (PSPN)\nstate, which could be responsible for the pseudogap. Using a phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we found that in this\nstate, RFD induces short range static CDW with phase-separated patterns in the\ndirectional components and the static CDW is destroyed by thermal phase\nfluctuations at a crossover temperature $T_{CO}<T^{*}$, above which the CDW\nbecomes dynamically fluctuating. The experimentally found CDW with\npredominantly d-wave form factor constrains the PDW components to have\n$s^{\\prime}\\pm id$ pairing symmetries. We also construct a lattice model and\ncompute the spectral functions for the PSPN state and find good agreement with\nARPES results.\n", "  This monograph is dedicated to a generalization of the L\\\"owner equation in\nits stochastic form known as SLE and to its coupling with the Gaussian free\nfield, ultimately aiming at the construction of a boundary conformal field\ntheory with one free scalar bosonic field. This study is presented in line with\na systematic, and hopefully concise, presentation and generalization of known\nelements of the theory of L\\\"owner evolution. We also study the relation to\nsingular representations of the Virasoro algebra and methods of numerical\nsimulation. The main results are in the proof of the basic properties of the\ngeneralized SLE and general necessary and sufficient conditions for the\ncoupling. We also introduce a machinery that possesses to consider all L\\\"owner\nequations and known types of the coupling as different manifestations of the\nsame thing.\n", "  In 1880, Stokes famously demonstrated that the singularity that occurs at the\ncrest of the steepest possible water wave in infinite depth must correspond to\na corner of $120^\\circ$. Here, the complex velocity scales like $f^{1/3}$ where\n$f$ is the complex potential. Later in 1973, Grant showed that for any wave\naway from the steepest configuration, the singularity $f = f^*$ moves into the\ncomplex plane, and is of order $(f-f^*)^{1/2}$ (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 59, 1973,\npp. 257-262). Grant conjectured that as the highest wave is approached, other\nsingularities must coalesce at the crest so as to cancel the square-root\nbehaviour. Despite recent advances, the complete singularity structure of the\nStokes wave is still not well understood. In this work, we develop numerical\nmethods for constructing the Riemann surface that represents the extension of\nthe water wave into the complex plane. We show that a countably infinite number\nof distinct singularities exists on other branches of the solution, and that\nthese singularities coalesce as Stokes' highest wave is approached.\n", "  The emergence of a Bose-glass region in a quasi one-dimensional\nBose-Einstein-condensed gas in a harmonic trapping potential with an additional\ndelta-correlated disorder potential at zero temperature is studied using three\napproaches. At first, the corresponding time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation is numerically solved for the condensate wave function, and disorder\nensemble averages are evaluated. In particular, we analyse quantitatively the\nemergence of mini-condensates in the local minima of the random potential,\nwhich occurs for weak disorder preferentially at the border of the condensate,\nwhile for intermediate disorder strength this happens in the trap centre.\nSecond, in view of a more detailed physical understanding of this phenomenon,\nwe extend a quite recent non-perturbative approach towards the weakly\ninteracting dirty boson problem, which relies on the Hartree-Fock theory and is\nworked out on the basis of the replica method, from the homogeneous case to a\nharmonic confinement. Finally, in the weak disorder regime we also apply the\nThomas-Fermi approximation, while in the intermediate disorder regime we\nadditionally use a variational ansatz in order to describe analytically the\nnumerically observed redistribution of the fragmented mini-condensates with\nincreasing disorder strength.\n", "  We show that the mixing effect of the neutral gauge bosons in the 3-3-1-1\nmodel comes from two sources. The first one is due to the 3-3-1-1 gauge\nsymmetry breaking as usual, whereas the second one results from the kinetic\nmixing between the gauge bosons of U(1)_X and U(1)_N groups, which are used to\ndetermine the electric charge and baryon minus lepton numbers, respectively.\nSuch mixings modify the \\rho-parameter and the known couplings of Z with\nfermions. The constraints that arise from flavor-changing neutral currents due\nto the gauge boson mixings and non-universal fermion generations are also\ngiven.\n", "  It has been recently pointed out that the use of a superconducting (SC) lead\ninstead of a normal metal lead can suppress the thermal broadening effects in\ntunneling conductance from Majorana fermions, helping reveal the quantized\nconductance of $2e^2/h$. In this paper we discuss the specific case of\ntunneling conductance with SC leads of spin-orbit coupled\nsemiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures in the presence of a\nZeeman field, a system which has been extensively studied both theoretically\nand experimentally using a metallic lead. We examine the $dI/dV$ spectra using\na SC lead for different sets of physical parameters including temperature,\ntunneling strength, wire length, magnetic field, and induced SC pairing\npotential in the SM nanowire. We conclude that in a finite wire the Majorana\nsplitting energy $\\Delta E$, which has non-trivial dependence on these physical\nparameters, remains responsible for the $dI/dV$ peak broadening, even when the\ntemperature broadening is suppressed by the SC gap in the lead. In a finite\nwire the signatures of Majorana fermions with a SC lead are oscillations of\nquasi-Majorana peaks about bias $V=\\pm\\Delta_{\\text{lead}}$, in contrast to the\ncase of metallic leads where such oscillations are about zero bias. Our results\nwill be useful for analysis of future experiments on SM-SC heterostructures\nusing SC leads.\n", "  The quantum triangular XXZ model has recently enjoyed a wealth of new\ntheoretical results, especially in relation to the modeling of the\nBa$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ compound. In particular, it has been understood that in a\nlongitudinal magnetic field the umbrella (cone) phase, classically stable in\nall the easy-plane region of the ground-state phase diagram, is considerably\nreduced by the effect of quantum fluctuations. We provide more quantitative\ninformation for this phenomenon at arbitrary value of the site spin $S$, by\nemploying the dilute Bose gas expansion, valid in the high-field regime; our\nresults improve the available estimates of the $1/S$ expansion. We quantify the\nextent to which a higher spin suppresses the effect of quantum fluctuations.\nBesides, we show how in three-dimensional layered systems a relatively small\nantiferromagnetic interlayer coupling has a similar consequence of bringing\nback the umbrella phase in some part of the phase diagram.\n", "  Pure Yang-Mills SU(N) theory is studied in the Landau gauge and four\ndimensional space. While leaving the original Lagrangian unmodified, a double\nperturbative expansion is devised, based on a massive free-particle propagator.\nIn dimensional regularization, all diverging mass terms cancel exactly in the\ndouble expansion, without the need to include mass counterterms that would\nspoil the symmetry of the Lagrangian. No free parameters are included that were\nnot in the original theory, yielding a fully analytical approach from first\nprinciples. The expansion is safe in the infrared and is equivalent to the\nstandard perturbation theory in the UV. At one-loop, explicit analytical\nexpressions are given for the propagators and the running coupling and are\nfound in excellent agreement with the data of lattice simulations. A universal\nscaling property is predicted for the inverse propagators and shown to be\nsatisfied by the lattice data. Higher loops are found to be negligible in the\ninfrared below 300 MeV where the coupling becomes small and the one-loop\napproximation is under full control.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations using empirical force fields (EFFs) are\ncrucial for gaining fundamental insights into atomic structure and long\ntimescale dynamics of Au nanoclusters with far-reaching applications in energy\nand devices. This approach is thwarted by the failure of currently available\nEFFs in describing the size-dependent dimensionality and diverse geometries\nexhibited by Au clusters (e.g., planar, hollow cages, pyramids). Owing to their\nability to account for bond directionality, bond-order based EFFs, such as the\nTersoff-type Bond Order Potential (BOP), are well suited for such a\ndescription. Nevertheless, the predictive power of existing BOP parameters is\nseverely limited in the nm length scale owing to the predominance of bulk Au\nproperties used to train them. Here, we mitigate this issue by introducing a\nnew hybrid bond order potential (HyBOP), which account for (a) short-range\ninteractions via Tersoff-type BOP terms and (b) long-range effects by a scaled\nLJ term whose contribution depends on the local atomic density. We optimized\nthe independent parameters for our HyBOP using a global optimization scheme\ndriven by genetic algorithms. Moreover, to ensure good transferability of these\nparameters across different length scales, we used an extensive training\ndataset encompasses structural and energetic properties of a thousand 13-atom\nAu clusters, surface energies, as well as bulk polymorphs, obtained from\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our newly developed HyBOP has\nbeen found to accurately describe (a) global minimum energy configurations at\ndifferent clusters sizes, (b) critical size of transition from planar to\nglobular clusters, (c) evolution of structural motifs with cluster size, and\n(d) thermodynamics, structure, elastic properties of bulk polymorphs as well as\nsurfaces, in excellent agreement with DFT calculations and spectroscopic\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper, the classical and quantum solutions of some axisymmetric\ncosmologies coupled to a massless scalar field are studied in the context of\nminisuperspace approximation. In these models, the singular nature of the\nLagrangians entails a search for possible conditional symmetries. These have\nbeen proven to be the simultaneous conformal symmetries of the supermetric and\nthe superpotential. The quantization is performed by adopting the Dirac\nproposal for constrained systems, i.e. promoting the first-class constraints to\noperators annihilating the wave function. To further enrich the approach, we\nfollow \\cite{Christodoulakis:2012eg} and impose the operators related to the\nclassical conditional symmetries on the wave function. These additional\nequations select particular solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In order\nto gain some physical insight from the quantization of these cosmological\nsystems, we perform a semiclassical analysis following the Bohmian approach to\nquantum theory. The generic result is that, in all but one model, one can find\nappropriate ranges of the parameters, so that the emerging semiclassical\ngeometries are non-singular. An attempt for physical interpretation involves\nthe study of the effective energy-momentum tensor which corresponds to an\nimperfect fluid.\n", "  This paper introduces a multiscale maximum entropy (MSME) algorithm for image\nrestoration of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), which is a\ncollimated scan X-ray satellite mainly devoted to a sensitive all-sky survey\nand pointed observation in 1-250 keV. The novelty of the MSME method is to use\nwavelet decomposition and multiresolution support to control noise\namplification in the different scales. And our work is focused on the\napplication and modification of this method to restore diffuse sources detected\nby HXMT scanning observation. And an improved method, ensemble multiscale\nmaximum entropy (EMSME) algorithm, is proposed to alleviate the problem of mode\nmixing exiting in MSME. Simulation have been performed on the detection of the\ndiffuse source Cen A by HXMT in the all-sky survey mode. The results show that\nthe MSME method is adapted to the deconvolution task of HXMT for diffuse source\ndetection and the improved method could suppress noise and improve the\ncorrelation and signal-to-noise ratio, thus proving itself a better algorithm\nfor image restoration. Through one all-sky survey, HXMT could reach a capacity\nof detecting a diffuse source with maximum differential flux of 0.5 mCrab.\n", "  We present the first complete calculation of Z-boson production in\nassociation with a jet in hadronic collisions through next-to-next-to-leading\norder in perturbative QCD. Our computation uses the recently-proposed\nN-jettiness subtraction scheme to regulate the infrared divergences that appear\nin the real-emission contributions. We present phenomenological results for 13\nTeV proton-proton collisions with fully realistic fiducial cuts on the\nfinal-state particles. The remaining theoretical uncertainties after the\ninclusion of our calculations are at the percent-level, making the Z+jet\nchannel ready for precision studies at the LHC Run II.\n", "  The paper presents a quantitative approach to the investigation and\ncomparison of the material qualities of III-V on silicon (III-V/Si) solar cells\nby using external radiative efficiencies. We use this analysis to predict the\nlimiting efficiencies and evaluate the criteria of material quality in order to\nachieve high efficiency III-V/Si solar cells. This result yields several\nimplications for the design of high efficiency III-V/Si solar cells.\n", "  The Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) scheme is a statistical/physical\nsecure key exchange system based on the laws of classical statistical physics\nto provide unconditional security. We used the LTSPICE industrial cable and\ncircuit simulator to emulate one of the major active (invasive) attacks, the\ncurrent injection attack, against the ideal and a practical KLJN system,\nrespectively. We show that two security enhancement techniques, namely, the\ninstantaneous voltage/current comparison method, and a simple privacy\namplification scheme, independently and effectively eliminate the information\nleak and successfully preserve the system's unconditional security.\n", "  We report on high-resolution JVLA and Chandra observations of the HST\nFrontier Cluster MACS J0717.5+3745. MACS J0717.5+3745 offers the largest\ncontiguous magnified area of any known cluster, making it a promising target to\nsearch for lensed radio and X-ray sources. With the high-resolution 1.0-6.5 GHz\nJVLA imaging in A and B configuration, we detect a total of 51 compact radio\nsources within the area covered by the HST imaging. Within this sample we find\n7 lensed sources with amplification factors larger than $2$. None of these\nsources are identified as multiply-lensed. Based on the radio luminosities, the\nmajority of these sources are likely star forming galaxies with star formation\nrates of 10-50 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ located at $1 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2$. Two of\nthe lensed radio sources are also detected in the Chandra image of the cluster.\nThese two sources are likely AGN, given their $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosities of\n$\\sim 10^{43-44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. From the derived radio luminosity function, we\nfind evidence for an increase in the number density of radio sources at\n$0.6<z<2.0$, compared to a $z < 0.3$ sample. Our observations indicate that\ndeep radio imaging of lensing clusters can be used to study star forming\ngalaxies, with star formation rates as low as $\\sim10$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,\nat the peak of cosmic star formation history.\n", "  Inspired by the diphoton signal excess observed in the latest data of 13 TeV\nLHC, we consider either a 750 GeV real scalar or pseudo-scalar responsible for\nthis anomaly. We propose a concrete vector-like quark model, in which the\nvector-like fermion pairs directly couple to this scalar via Yukawa\ninteraction. For this setting the scalar is mainly produced via gluon fusion,\nthen decays at the one-loop level to SM diboson channels $gg, \\gamma\\gamma, ZZ,\nWW$. We show that for the vector-like fermion pairs with exotic electric\ncharges, such model can account for the diphoton excess and is consistent with\nthe data of 8 TeV LHC simultaneously in the context of perturbative analysis.\n", "  We propose to interpret the 750 GeV diphoton excess in deflected anomaly\nmediation supersymmetry breaking scenarios, which can naturally predict\ncouplings between a singlet field and vector-like messengers. The CP-even\nscalar component (S) of the singlet field can serve as the 750 GeV resonance.\nThe messenger scale, which is of order the gravitino scale, can be as light as\nF_\\phi \\sim {\\cal O}(10) TeV when the messenger species N_F and the deflection\nparameter d are moderately large. Such messengers can induce the large loop\ndecay process S \\to \\gamma\\gamma. Our results show that such a scenario can\nsuccessfully accommodate the 125 GeV Higgs boson, the 750 GeV diphoton excess\nand the muon g-2 without conflicting with the LHC constraints. We also comment\non the possible explanations in the gauge mediation supersymmetry breaking\nscenario.\n", "  We conducted IRAM-30m C18O (2-1) and SMA 1.3mm continuum, 12CO (2-1), and\nC18O (2-1) observations toward the Class 0/I protostar L1455 IRS1 in Perseus.\nThe IRAM results show L1455 IRS1 located in a dense core of 0.05 pc in size\nwith a mass of 0.54M_sun, connecting to a filamentary structure. Inside the\ndense core, compact components of 350 AU and 1500 AU are detected in the SMA\n1.3 mm continuum and C18O, with a velocity gradient in the latter one\nperpendicular to a bipolar outflow in 12CO, likely tracing a rotational motion.\nWe measure a rotational velocity profile ~ r^-0.75 that becomes shallower at a\nturning radius of ~200 AU which is approximately the radius of the 1.3 mm\ncontinuum component. These results hint the presence of a Keplerian disk with a\nradius <200 AU around L1455 IRS1 with a protostellar mass of about 0.28 M_sun.\nWe derive a core rotation that is about one order of magnitude faster than\nexpected. A significant velocity gradient along a filament towards IRS1\nindicates that this filament is dynamically important, providing a gas\nreservoir and possibly responsible for the faster-than-average core rotation.\nPrevious polarimetric observations show a magnetic field aligned with the\noutflow axis and perpendicular to the associated filament on a 0.1~pc scale,\nwhile on the inner 1000 AU scale, the field becomes perpendicular to the\noutflow axis.This change in magnetic field orientations is consistent with our\nestimated increase in rotational energy from large to small scales that\novercomes the magnetic field energy, wrapping the field lines and aligning them\nwith the disk velocity gradient. These results are discussed in the context of\nthe interplay between filament, magnetic field, and gas kinematics from large\nto small scale. Possible emerging trends are explored with a sample of 8 Class\n0/I protostars.\n", "  Gaia's very accurate astrometric measurements will allow the International\nCelestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to be improved by a few orders of magnitude in\nthe optical. Several sets of quasars are used to define a kinematically stable\nnon-rotating reference frame with the barycentre of the Solar System as its\norigin. Gaia will also observe a large number of galaxies which could obtain\naccurate positions and proper motions although they are not point-like. The\noptical stability of the quasars is critical and we investigate how accurately\nthe reference frame can be recovered. Various proper motion patterns are also\npresent in the data, the best known is caused by the acceleration of the Solar\nSystem Barycentre, presumably, towards the Galactic centre. We review some\nother less-well-known effects that are not part of standard astrometric models.\nWe model quasars and galaxies using realistic sky distributions, magnitudes and\nredshifts. Position variability is introduced using a Markov chain model. The\nreference frame is determined using the algorithm developed for the Gaia\nmission which also determines the acceleration of the Solar System. We also\ntest a method to measure the velocity of the Solar System barycentre in a\ncosmological frame. We simulate the recovery of the reference frame and the\nacceleration of the Solar System and conclude that they are not significantly\ndisturbed in the presence of quasar variability which is statistically\naveraged. However, the effect of a non-uniform sky distribution of the quasars\ncan result in a correlation between the reference frame and acceleration which\ndegrades the solution. Our results suggest that an attempt should be made to\nastrometrically determine the redshift dependent apparent drift of galaxies due\nto our velocity relative to the CMB, which in principle could allow the\ndetermination of the Hubble parameter.\n", "  Nano-materials, such as metal-organic frameworks, have been considered to\ncapture CO$_2$. However, their application has been limited largely because\nthey exhibit poor selectivity for flue gases and low capture capacity under low\npressures. We perform a high-throughput screening for selective CO$_2$ capture\nfrom flue gases by using first principles thermodynamics. We find that elements\nwith empty d orbitals selectively attract CO$_2$ from gaseous mixtures under\nlow CO$_2$ pressures at 300 K and release it at ~450 K. CO$_2$ binding to\nelements involves hybridization of the metal d orbitals with the CO$_2$ $\\pi$\norbitals and CO$_2$-transition metal complexes were observed in experiments.\nThis result allows us to perform high-throughput screening to discover novel\npromising CO$_2$ capture materials with empty d orbitals and predict their\ncapture performance under various conditions. Moreover, these findings provide\nphysical insights into selective CO$_2$ capture and open a new path to explore\nCO$_2$ capture materials.\n", "  The difference Delta F between free energies has applications in biology,\nchemistry, and pharmacology. The value of Delta F can be estimated from\nexperiments or simulations, via fluctuation theorems developed in statistical\nmechanics. Calculating the error in a Delta F estimate is difficult. Worse,\natypical trials dominate estimates. How many trials one should perform was\nestimated roughly in [Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. E 73, 046105 (2006)]. We enhance\nthe approximation with information-theoretic strategies: We quantify\n\"dominance\" with a tolerance parameter chosen by the experimenter or simulator.\nWe bound the number of trials one should expect to perform, using the\norder-infinity Renyi entropy. The bound can be estimated if one implements the\n\"good practice\" of bidirectionality, known to improve estimates of Delta F.\nEstimating Delta F from this number of trials leads to an error that we bound\napproximately. Numerical experiments on a weakly interacting dilute classical\ngas support our analytical calculations.\n", "  Topological superconductors are novel classes of quantum condensed phases,\ncharacterized by topologically nontrivial structures of Cooper pairing states.\nOn the surfaces of samples and in vortex cores of topological superconductors,\nMajorana fermions, which are particles identified with their own\nanti-particles, appear as Bogoliubov quasiparticles. The existence and\nstability of Majorana fermions are ensured by bulk topological invariants\nconstrained by the symmetries of the systems. Majorana fermions in topological\nsuperconductors obey a new type of quantum statistics referred to as\nnon-Abelian statistics, which is distinct from bose and fermi statistics, and\ncan be utilized for application to topological quantum computation. Also,\nMajorana fermions give rise to various exotic phenomena such as\n\"fractionalization\", non-local correlation, and \"teleportation\". A pedagogical\nreview of these subjects is presented. We also discuss interaction effects on\ntopological classification of superconductors, and the basic properties of Weyl\nsuperconductors.\n", "  In quantum optics, photonic Schr\\\"odinger cats are superpositions of two\ncoherent states with opposite phases and with a significant number of photons.\nRecently, these states have been observed in the transient dynamics of\ndriven-dissipative resonators subject to engineered two-photon processes. Here\nwe present an exact analytical solution of the steady-state density matrix for\nthis class of systems, including one-photon losses, which are considered\ndetrimental for the achievement of cat states. We demonstrate that the unique\nsteady state is a statistical mixture of two cat-like states with opposite\nparity, in spite of significant one-photon losses. The transient dynamics to\nthe steady state depends dramatically on the initial state and can pass through\na metastable regime lasting orders of magnitudes longer than the photon\nlifetime. By considering individual quantum trajectories in photon-counting\nconfiguration, we find that the system intermittently jumps between two cats.\nFinally, we propose and study a feedback protocol based on this behaviour to\ngenerate a pure cat-like steady state.\n", "  We construct a 4-parameter family of inhomogeneous cosmological models, which\ncontains two recently derived 3-parameter families as special cases. The\ncorresponding exact vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations is obtained\nwith methods from soliton theory. We also study properties of these models and\nfind that they combine all interesting features of both earlier solution\nfamilies: general regularity within the maximal globally hyperbolic region,\nparticular singular cases in which a curvature singularity with a directional\nbehaviour forms, a highly non-trivial causal structure, and Cauchy horizons\nwhose null generators can have both closed or non-closed orbits. In the second\npart of the paper, we discuss the generalization from vacuum to electrovacuum.\nMoreover, we also present a family of exact solutions for that case and study\nits properties.\n", "  The Wigner-von Neumann method, which was previously used for perturbing\ncontinuous Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators, is here applied to their discrete\ncounterparts. In particular, we consider perturbations of arbitrary\n$T$-periodic Jacobi matrices. The asymptotic behaviour of the subordinate\nsolutions is investigated, as too are their initial components, together giving\na general technique for embedding eigenvalues, $\\lambda$, into the operator's\nabsolutely continuous spectrum. Introducing a new rational function,\n$C(\\lambda;T)$, related to the periodic Jacobi matrices, we describe the\nelements of the a.c. spectrum for which this construction does not work (zeros\nof $C(\\lambda;T)$); in particular showing that there are only finitely many of\nthem.\n", "  We discuss the computation of form factors for semi-leptonic decays of $\\rm\nB$-, $\\rm B_s$- mesons in lattice QCD. Considering in particular the example of\nthe static $\\rm B_s$ form factors we demonstrate that after non-perturbative\nrenormalization the continuum limit can be taken with confidence. The resulting\nprecision is of interest for extractions of $V_{\\rm ub}$. The size of the\ncorrections of order $1/m_{\\rm b}$ is just estimated at present but it is\nexpected that their inclusion does not pose significant difficulties.\n", "  We report diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations of the\nquasiparticle and excitonic gaps of hydrogen-terminated oligoynes and polyyne.\nThe electronic gaps are found to be very sensitive to the atomic structure in\nthese systems. We have therefore optimised the geometry of polyyne by directly\nminimising the DMC energy with respect to the lattice constant and the\nPeierls-induced carbon-carbon bond-length alternation. We find the bond-length\nalternation of polyyne to be 0.136(2) {\\AA} and the excitonic and quasiparticle\ngaps to be 3.30(7) and 3.4(1) eV, respectively. The DMC zone-centre\nlongitudinal optical phonon frequency of polyyne is 2084(5) cm$^{-1}$, which is\nconsistent with Raman spectroscopic measurements for large oligoynes.\n", "  We derive a general formalism for bulk viscous solutions of the\nenergy-conservation-equation for $\\rho(a,\\zeta)$, both for a single-component\nand a multicomponent fluid in the Friedmann universe. For our purposes these\ngeneral solutions become valuable in estimating order of magnitude of the\nphenomenological viscosity in the cosmic fluid at present. $H(z)$ observations\nare found to put an upper limit on the magnitude of the modulus of the present\nday bulk viscosity. It is found to be $\\zeta_0\\sim 10^6~$Pa s, in agreement\nwith previous works. We point out that this magnitude is acceptable from a\nhydrodynamic point of view. Finally, we bring new insight by using our\nestimates of $\\zeta$ to analyse the fate of the future universe. Of special\ninterest is the case $\\zeta \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}$ for which the fluid,\noriginally situated in the quintessence region, may slide through the phantom\nbarrier and inevitably be driven into a big rip. Typical rip times are found to\nbe a few hundred Gy.\n", "  Light gravitinos of mass $\\lesssim \\mathcal{O} (10)$ eV are of particular\ninterest in cosmology, offering various baryogenesis scenarios without\nsuffering from the cosmological gravitino problem. The gravitino may contribute\nconsiderably to the total matter content of the Universe and affect structure\nformation from early to present epochs. After the gravitinos decouple from\nother particles in the early Universe, they free-stream and consequently\nsuppress density fluctuations of (sub-)galactic length scales. Observations of\nstructure at the relevant length-scales can be used to infer or constrain the\nmass and the abundance of light gravitinos. We derive constraints on the light\ngravitino mass using the data of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing from\nPlanck and of cosmic shear from the Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey,\ncombined with analyses of the primary CMB anisotropies and the signature of\nbaryon acoustic oscillations in galaxy distributions. The obtained constraint\non the gravitino mass is $m_{3/2} < 4.7$ eV (95% C.L.), which is substantially\ntighter than the previous constraint from clustering analysis of Ly-$\\alpha$\nforests.\n", "  We present a treatise on solving the Takagi-Taupin equations in the case of a\nstrain field with an additional, spatially slowly varying component (owing to\n\\emph{e.g.}~heat expansion or angular compression). We show that the presence\nof such a component in a typical case merely shifts the reflectivity curve as a\nfunction of wavelength or incidence angle, while having a negligible effect on\nits shape. On the basis of the derived result, we develop a computationally\nefficient method to calculate the reflectivity curve of a large deformed\ncrystal. The validity of the method is demonstrated by comparing computed\nreflectivity curves with experimental ones for bent silicon wafers. A good\nagreement is observed.\n", "  Electromagnetism, the strong and the weak interaction are commonly formulated\nas gauge theories in a Lagrangian description. In this paper we present an\nalternative formal derivation of U(1)-gauge theory in a manifestly covariant\nHamilton formalism. We make use of canonical transformations as our guiding\ntool to formalize the gauging procedure. The introduction of the gauge field,\nits transformation behaviour and a dynamical gauge field Lagrangian/Hamiltonian\nare unavoidable consequences of this formalism, whereas the form of the free\ngauge Lagrangian/Hamiltonian depends on the selection of the gauge dependence\nof the canonically conjugate gauge fields.\n", "  The paper describes the unique geometric properties of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and demonstrates how such features are inherited by\nextended MHD, viz. models that incorporate two-fluid effects (the Hall term and\nelectron inertia). The generalized helicities, and other geometric expressions\nfor these models are presented in a topological context, emphasizing their\nuniversal facets. Some of the results presented include: the generalized Kelvin\ncirculation theorems; the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms; and two\nconcomitant helicities that can be studied via the Jones polynomial, which is\nwidely utilized in Chern-Simons theory. The ensuing commonality is traced to\nthe existence of an underlying Hamiltonian structure for all the extended MHD\nmodels, exemplified by the presence of a unique noncanonical Poisson bracket,\nand its associated energy.\n", "  Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will be an important type of\nastrophysical source for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors. There\nis a trade-off between accuracy and computational speed for the EMRI waveform\ntemplates required in the analysis of data from these detectors. We discuss how\nthe systematic error incurred by using faster templates may be reduced with\nimproved models such as augmented kludge waveforms, and marginalised over with\nstatistical techniques such as Gaussian process regression.\n", "  We compute the one-loop 1PI contributions to all the propagators of the\nnoncommutative N=1, 2, 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) U(1) theories defined by the\nmeans of the theta-exact Seiberg-Witten (SW) map in the Wess-Zumino gauge. Then\nwe extract the UV divergent contributions and the noncommutative IR\ndivergences. We show that all the quadratic noncommutative IR divergences add\nup to zero in each propagator.\n", "  Superconductor digital electronics using Josephson junctions as ultrafast\nswitches and magnetic-flux encoding of information was proposed over 30 years\nago as a sub-terahertz clock frequency alternative to semiconductor electronics\nbased on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Recently,\ninterest in developing superconductor electronics has been renewed due to a\nsearch for energy saving solutions in applications related to high-performance\ncomputing. The current state of superconductor electronics and fabrication\nprocesses are reviewed in order to evaluate whether this electronics is\nscalable to a very large scale integration (VLSI) required to achieve\ncomputation complexities comparable to CMOS processors. A fully planarized\nprocess at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, perhaps the most advanced process developed\nso far for superconductor electronics, is used as an example. The process has\nnine superconducting layers: eight Nb wiring layers with the minimum feature\nsize of 350 nm, and a thin superconducting layer for making compact\nhigh-kinetic-inductance bias inductors. All circuit layers are fully planarized\nusing chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of SiO2 interlayer dielectric.\nThe physical limitations imposed on the circuit density by Josephson junctions,\ncircuit inductors, shunt and bias resistors, etc., are discussed. Energy\ndissipation in superconducting circuits is also reviewed in order to estimate\nwhether this technology, which requires cryogenic refrigeration, can be energy\nefficient. Fabrication process development required for increasing the density\nof superconductor digital circuits by a factor of ten and achieving densities\nabove 10^7 Josephson junctions per cm^2 is described.\n", "  If, on one hand, the inverse seesaw is the paradigm of TeV scale seesaw\nmechanism, on the other it is a challenge to find scenarios capable of\nrealizing it. In this work we propose a scenario, based on the framework of\nR-parity violation, that realizes minimally the supersymmetric inverse seesaw\nmechanism. In it the energy scale parameters involved in the mechanism are\nrecognized as the vacuum expectation values of the scalars that compose the\nsinglet superfields $\\hat N^C$ and $\\hat S$. We develop also the scalar sector\nof the model and show that the Higgs mass receives a new tree-level\ncontribution that, when combined with the standard contribution plus loop\ncorrection, is capable of attaining $125$GeV without resort to heavy stops.\n", "  We perform a numerical simulation of the dynamics of quantized vortices\nproduced by coflow in a square channel using the vortex filament model. Unlike\nthe situation in thermal counterflow, where the superfluid velocity $v_{\\rm s}$\nand normal-fluid velocity $v_{\\rm n}$ flow in opposite directions, in coflow,\n$v_{\\rm s}$ and $v_{\\rm n}$ flow in the same direction. Quantum turbulence in\nthermal counterflow has been long studied theoretically and experimentally, and\nits various features have been revealed.In recent years, an experiment on\nquantum turbulence in coflow has been performed to observe different features\nof thermal counterflow. By supposing that $v_{\\rm s}$ is uniform and $v_{\\rm\nn}$ takes the Hagen-Poiseuille profile, which is different from the experiment\nwhere $v_{\\rm n}$ is thought to be turbulent, we calculate the coflow\nturbulence. Vortices preferentially accumulate on the surface of a cylinder for\n$v_{\\rm s} \\simeq v_{\\rm n}$ by mutual friction; namely, the coflow turbulence\nhas an attractor. How strongly the vortices are attracted depends on the\ntemperature and velocity. The length of the vortices increases as the vortices\nprotruding from the cylindrical attractor continue to wrap around it. As the\nvortices become dense on the attractor, they spread toward its interior by\ntheir repulsive interaction. Then, the superfluid velocity profile induced by\nthe vortices gradually mimics the normal-fluid velocity profile. This is an\nindication of velocity matching, which is an important feature of coflow\nturbulence.\n", "  Whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can amplify initially weak\nmagnetic fields to dynamically relevant strengths in core collapse supernovae\nis still a matter of active scientific debate. Recent numerical studies have\nshown that the first phase of MRI growth dominated by channel flows is\nterminated by parasitic instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type that disrupt\nMRI channel flows and quench further magnetic field growth. However, it remains\nto be prop- erly assessed by what factor the initial magnetic field can be\namplified and how it depends on the initial field strength and the amplitude of\nthe perturbations. Different termination criteria leading to different\nestimates of the amplification factor were proposed within the parasitic model.\nTo determine the amplification factor and test which criterion is a better\npredictor of the MRI termination, we perform three-dimensional shearing-disc\nand shearing-box simula- tions of a region close to the surface of a\ndifferentially rotating proto-neutron star in non-ideal MHD with two different\nnumerical codes. We find that independently of the initial magnetic field\nstrength, the MRI channel modes can amplify the magnetic field by, at most, a\nfactor of 100. Under the conditions found in proto-neutron stars a more\nrealistic value for the mag- netic field amplification is of the order of 10.\nThis severely limits the role of the MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying\nthe magnetic field in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed fields. A\nfurther amplification should therefore rely on other physical processes, such\nas for example an MRI-driven turbulent dynamo.\n", "  The QCD axion couplings of various invisible axion models are presented. In\nparticular, the exact global symmetry U(1)$_{\\rm PQ}$ in the superpotential is\npossible for the anomalous U(1) from string compactification, broken only by\nthe gauge anomalies at one loop level, and is shown to have the resultant\ninvisible axion coupling to photon, $c_{a\\gamma\\gamma}\\ge\n\\frac83-c_{a\\gamma\\gamma}^{\\rm ch\\,br}$ where $c_{a\\gamma\\gamma}^{\\rm\nch\\,br}\\simeq 2$. However, this bound is not applicable in approximate\nU(1)$_{\\rm PQ}$ models with sufficiently suppressed U(1)$_{\\rm PQ}$-breaking\nsuperpotential terms. We also present a simple method to obtain\n$c_{a\\gamma\\gamma}^0$ which is the value obtained above the electroweak scale.\n", "  We present ferromagnetic neutron spin echo measurements and muon spin\nrelaxation ($\\mu$SR) measurements of the spin dynamics in the ordered phase of\nthe metallic alloy INVAR Fe$_{65}$Ni$_{35}$. Both techniques display evidence\nof slow spin dynamics in the ordered phase which could be associated with the\nINVAR effect. Zero field (ZF) and longitudinal field $\\mu$SR measurements\nsuggest the presence of two separate timescales of slow spin-dynamics in the\nordered phase; a fast component corresponding to that observed in our\nneutron-spin-echo measurements and a second slow component which may be related\nto the \"cluster\" spin-fluctuations or to the dynamics of disordered local\nmoments or both as suggested by previous neutron scattering measurements and\nrecent theoretical studies.\n", "  In this paper we study in detail the effect of the rotational alignment\nbetween a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slab and the graphene layers in the\nvertical current of a a graphene-hBN-graphene device. We show how for small\nrotational angles, the transference of momentum by the hBN crystal lattice\nleads to multiple peaks in the I-V curve of the device, giving origin to\nmultiple regions displaying negative differential conductance. We also study\nthe effect of scattering by phonons in the vertical current an see how the\nopening up of inelastic tunneling events allowed by spontaneous emission of\noptical phonons leads to sharp peaks in the second derivative of the current.\n", "  We report a comparative polarized Raman study of Weyl semimetals TaAs, NbAs,\nTaP and NbP. The evolution of the phonon frequencies with the sample\ncomposition allows us to determine experimentally which atoms are mainly\ninvolved for each vibration mode. Our results confirm previous first-principles\ncalculations indicating that the A$_1$, B$_1(2)$, E$(2)$ and E$(3)$ modes\ninvolve mainly the As(P) atoms, the B$_1(1)$ mode is mainly related to Ta(Nb)\natoms, and the E$(1)$ mode involves both kinds of atoms. By comparing the\nenergy of the different modes, we establish that the B$_1(1)$, B$_1(2)$, E$(2)$\nand E$(3)$ become harder with chemical pressure increasing. This behavior\ndiffers from our observation on the A$_1$ mode, which decreases in energy, in\ncontrast to its behavior under external pressure.\n", "  The great majority of algorithms employed in the study of lattice field\ntheory are based on Monte Carlo's importance sampling method, i.e. on\nprobability interpretation of the Boltzmann weight. Unfortunately in many\ntheories of interest one cannot associated a real and positive weight to every\nconfiguration, that is because their action is explicitly complex or because\nthe weight is multiplied by some non positive term. In this cases one says that\nthe theory on the lattice is affected by the sign problem. An outstanding\nexample of sign problem preventing a quantum field theory to be studied, is QCD\nat finite chemical potential. Whenever the sign problem is present, standard\nMonte Carlo methods are problematic to apply and, in general, new approaches\nare needed to explore the phase diagram of the complex theory. Here we will\nreview three of the main candidate methods to deal with the sign problem,\nnamely complex Langevin dynamics, Lefschetz thimbles and density of states\nmethod. We will first study complex Langevin dynamics, combined with the gauge\ncooling method, on the one-dimensional Polyakov line model, and then we will\napply it to pure gauge Yang-Mills theory with a topological theta-term. It\nfollows a comparison between complex Langevin dynamics and the Lefschetz\nthimbles method on three toy models, which are the quartic model, the U(1)\none-link model with a mu dependent determinant, and the SU(2) non abelian\none-link model with complex beta parameter. Lastly, we introduce the density of\nstate method, based on the LLR algorithm, and we will employ it in the study of\nthe relativistic Bose gas at finite chemical potential.\n", "  The real-time dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model, driven out of equilibrium\nby quenching or ramping the interaction parameter, is studied within the\nframework of the nonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. A dynamical\nimpurity approximation with a single auxiliary bath site is considered as a\nreference system and the time-dependent hybridization is optimized as\nprescribed by the variational principle. The dynamical two-site approximation\nturns out to be useful to study the real-time dynamics on short and\nintermediate time scales. Depending on the strength of the interaction in the\nfinal state, two qualitatively different response regimes are observed. For\nboth weak and strong couplings, qualitative agreement with previous results of\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory is found. The two regimes are\nsharply separated by a critical point at which the low-energy bath degree of\nfreedom decouples in the course of time. We trace the dependence of the\ncritical interaction of the dynamical Mott transition on the duration of the\ninteraction ramp from sudden quenches to adiabatic dynamics, and therewith link\nthe dynamical to the equilibrium Mott transition.\n", "  We construct the graviton two-point function for a two-parameter family of\nlinear covariant gauges in n-dimensional de Sitter space. The construction is\nperformed via the mode-sum method in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the Poincar\\'e\npatch, and a Fierz-Pauli mass term is introduced to regularize the infrared\n(IR) divergences. The resulting two-point function is de Sitter-invariant, and\nfree of IR divergences in the massless limit (for a certain range of\nparameters) though analytic continuation with respect to the mass for the\npure-gauge sector of the two-point function is necessary for this result. This\ngeneral result agrees with the propagator obtained by analytic continuation\nfrom the sphere [Phys. Rev. D 34, 3670 (1986); Class. Quant. Grav. 18, 4317\n(2001)]. However, if one starts with strictly zero mass theory, the IR\ndivergences are absent only for a specific value of one of the two parameters,\nwith the other parameter left generic. These findings agree with recent\ncalculations in the Landau (exact) gauge [J. Math. Phys. 53, 122502 (2012)],\nwhere IR divergences do appear in the spin-two (tensor) part of the two-point\nfunction. However, we find the strength (including the sign) of the IR\ndivergence to be different from the one found in this reference.\n", "  In this letter we explore how the microscopic dynamics of charge transfer\n(CT) excitons are influenced by the presence of an external magnetic field in\ndisordered molecular semiconductors. This influence is driven by the dynamic\ninterplay between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the electron-hole\npair. To account for this interplay we have developed a numerical framework\nthat combines a traditional model of quantum spin dynamics with a\ncoarse-grained model of stochastic charge transport. This combination provides\na general and efficient methodology for simulating the effects of magnetic\nfield on CT state dynamics, therefore providing a basis for revealing the\nmicroscopic origin of experimentally observed magnetic field effects. We\ndemonstrate that simulations carried out on our model are capable of\nreproducing experimental results as well as generating theoretical predictions\nrelated to the efficiency of organic electronic materials.\n", "  The sensitivity of nuclear symmetry energy elements at the saturation density\nto the binding energies of ultra neutron-rich nuclei (neutron to proton ratio\n$\\sim$ 2) and the maximum mass of neutron star is explored within a\nrelativistic mean field model. Values of the interaction parameters governing\nthe isovector strengths and the symmetry elements are determined in tighter\nbounds. Assessments based on the sensitivity matrix reveal that the properties\nof extreme neutron-rich systems play a predominant role in narrowing down the\nuncertainties in the various symmetry energy parameters. The calculations are\nextended over a wide range of nuclear matter density and the results are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We discuss information loss from black hole physics in AdS$_3$, focusing on\ntwo sharp signatures infecting CFT$_2$ correlators at large central charge $c$:\n'forbidden singularities' arising from Euclidean-time periodicity due to the\neffective Hawking temperature, and late-time exponential decay in the\nLorentzian region. We study an infinite class of examples where forbidden\nsingularities can be resolved by non-perturbative effects at finite $c$, and we\nshow that the resolution has certain universal features that also apply in the\ngeneral case. Analytically continuing to the Lorentzian regime, we find that\nthe non-perturbative effects that resolve forbidden singularities qualitatively\nchange the behavior of correlators at times $t \\sim S_{BH}$, the black hole\nentropy. This may resolve the exponential decay of correlators at late times in\nblack hole backgrounds. By Borel resumming the $1/c$ expansion of exact\nexamples, we explicitly identify 'information-restoring' effects from heavy\nstates that should correspond to classical solutions in AdS$_3$. Our results\nsuggest a line of inquiry towards a more precise formulation of the\ngravitational path integral in AdS$_3$.\n", "  Maps of Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) fluxes obtained from Interstellar\nBoundary Explorer (IBEX) observations revealed a bright structure extending\nover the sky, subsequently dubbed the IBEX ribbon. The ribbon had not been\nexpected from the existing models and theories prior to IBEX, and a number of\nmechanisms have since been proposed to explain the observations. In these\nmechanisms, the observed ENAs emerge from source plasmas located at different\ndistances from the Sun. Since each part of the sky is observed by IBEX twice\nduring the year from opposite sides of the Sun, the apparent position of the\nribbon as observed in the sky is shifted due to parallax. To determine the\nribbon parallax, we found the precise location of the maximum signal of the\nribbon observed in each orbital arc. The obtained apparent positions were\nsubsequently corrected for the Compton-Getting effect, gravitational\ndeflection, and radiation pressure. Finally, we selected a part of the ribbon\nwhere its position is similar between the IBEX energy passbands. We compared\nthe apparent positions obtained from the viewing locations on the opposite\nsides of the Sun, and found that they are shifted by a parallax angle of\n$0.41^\\circ\\pm0.15^\\circ$, which corresponds to a distance of $140^{+84}_{-38}$\nAU. This finding supports models of the ribbon with the source located just\noutside the heliopause.\n", "  This paper discusses various observations on beam-induced and cosmic-ray\nbackgrounds in the ATLAS detector during the LHC 2012 proton-proton run.\nBuilding on published results based on 2011 data, the correlations between\nbackground and residual pressure of the beam vacuum are revisited. Ghost charge\nevolution over 2012 and its role for backgrounds are evaluated. New methods to\nmonitor ghost charge with beam-gas rates are presented and observations of LHC\nabort gap population by ghost charge are discussed in detail. Fake jets from\ncolliding bunches and from ghost charge are analysed with improved methods,\nshowing that ghost charge in individual radio-frequency buckets of the LHC can\nbe resolved. Some results of two short periods of dedicated cosmic-ray\nbackground data-taking are shown; in particular cosmic-ray muon induced fake\njet rates are compared to Monte Carlo simulations and to the fake jet rates\nfrom beam background. A thorough analysis of a particular LHC fill, where\nabnormally high background was observed, is presented. Correlations between\nbackgrounds and beam intensity losses in special fills with very high $\\beta^*$\nare studied.\n", "  Network theory has proven to be a powerful tool in describing and analyzing\nsystems by modelling the relations between their constituent objects. In recent\nyears great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory.\nHowever, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order\nto serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an\nexplicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of\nobjects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of\ngroups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different\nscales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a\nframework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network\nrepresentations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the\nother hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features.\nTo implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite\ngraph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition\nlattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how\npartitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges\nallows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary\ngroups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by\ndeep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that\nenables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and\ninteractions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner.\nFurthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models,\nwe derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework\nand demonstrate the advantages of our representation. We exemplify an\napplication of deep graphs using a real world dataset of precipitation\nmeasurements.\n", "  In CBM Experiment at FAIR, dimuons will be detected by a Muon Chamber (MUCH)\nconsisting of segmented absorbers of varying widths and tracking chambers\nsandwiched between the absorber-pairs. In this fixed target heavy-ion collision\nexperiment, operating at highest interaction rate of $10~MHz$ for $Au+Au$\ncollision, after the first MUCH detector station in its inner radial ring will\nface a particle rate of $1~MHz/cm^2$. To operate at such a high particle\ndensity, GEM technology based detectors have been selected for the first two\nstations of MUCH. We have reported earlier the performance of several\nsmall-size GEM detector prototypes built at VECC for use in MUCH. In this work,\nwe report on a large GEM chamber prototype tested with proton beam of momentum\n$2.36~GeV/c$ at COSY-J\\\"{u}elich Germany. The detector was read out using\nnXYTER ASIC operated in self-triggering mode. An efficiency higher than $96\\%$\nat $\\Delta V_{GEM}~=~375.2~V$ was achieved. The variation of efficiency with\nthe rate of incoming protons has been found to vary within $2\\%$ when tested up\nto a maximum rate of $2.8~MHz/cm^2$. The gain was found to be stable at high\nparticle rate with a maximum variation of $\\sim~9\\%$.\n", "  Recent work on the history of General Relativity by Renn, Sauer, Janssen et\nal. shows that Einstein found his field equations partly by a physical strategy\nincluding the Newtonian limit, the electromagnetic analogy, and energy\nconservation. Such themes are similar to those later used by particle\nphysicists. How do Einstein's physical strategy and the particle physics\nderivations compare? What energy-momentum complex(es) did he use and why? Did\nEinstein tie conservation to symmetries, and if so, to which? Einstein used an\nidentity from his assumed linear coordinate covariance x'= Mx to relate it to\nthe canonical tensor. Usually he avoided using matter Euler-Lagrange equations\nand so was not well positioned to use or reinvent the Herglotz-Mie-Born\nunderstanding that the canonical tensor was conserved due to translation\nsymmetries, a result with roots in Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi. Whereas Mie\nand Born were concerned about the canonical tensor's asymmetry, Einstein did\nnot need to worry because his Entwurf Lagrangian is modeled not so much on\nMaxwell's theory as on a scalar theory. As a result, it also has 3 ghosts,\nfailing a 1920s-30s a priori particle physics stability test with antecedents\nin Lagrange's and Dirichlet's stability work.\n  This critique of the Entwurf theory can be compared with Einstein's 1915\ncritique of his Entwurf theory for not admitting rotating coordinates and not\ngetting Mercury's perihelion right.\n  Particle physics also can be useful in the historiography of gravity and\nspace-time. This topic can be a useful case study in the history of science on\nrecently reconsidered questions of presentism, whiggism and the like.\n", "  A search for Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks\n($t\\bar{t}H$) is performed, where the Higgs boson decays to $b\\bar{b}$, and\nboth top quarks decay hadronically. The data used correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected\nwith the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search selects events\nwith at least six energetic jets and uses a boosted decision tree algorithm to\ndiscriminate between signal and Standard Model background. The dominant\nmultijet background is estimated using a dedicated data-driven technique. For a\nHiggs boson mass of 125 GeV, an upper limit of 6.4 (5.4) times the Standard\nModel cross section is observed (expected) at 95% confidence level. The\nbest-fit value for the signal strength is $\\mu = 1.6 \\pm 2.6$ times the\nStandard Model expectation for $m_{H} = 125$ GeV. Combining all $t\\bar{t}H$\nsearches carried out by ATLAS at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ and 7 TeV, an observed (expected)\nupper limit of 3.1 (1.4) times the Standard Model expectation is obtained at\n95% confidence level, with a signal strength $\\mu = 1.7 \\pm 0.8$.\n", "  We perform a search for near-threshold $\\Xi_b^0$ resonances decaying to\n$\\Xi_b^- \\pi^+$ in a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment. We\nobserve one resonant state, with the following properties:\n  \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  m(\\Xi_b^{*0}) - m(\\Xi_b^-) - m(\\pi^+) &=& 15.727 \\pm 0.068 \\, (\\mathrm{stat})\n\\pm 0.023 \\, (\\mathrm{syst}) \\, \\mathrm{MeV}/c^2,\n  \\Gamma(\\Xi_b^{*0}) &=& 0.90 \\pm 0.16 \\, (\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.08 \\,\n(\\mathrm{syst}) \\, \\mathrm{MeV}\n  .\n  \\end{eqnarray*} This confirms the previous observation by the CMS\ncollaboration. The state is consistent with the $J^P=3/2^+$ $\\Xi_b^{*0}$\nresonance expected in the quark model. This is the most precise determination\nof the mass and the first measurement of the natural width of this state. We\nhave also measured the ratio\n  \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sigma(pp \\to \\Xi_b^{*0} X){\\cal{B}}(\\Xi_b^{*0} \\to\n\\Xi_b^- \\pi^+)}{\\sigma(pp \\to \\Xi_b^- X)}\n  = 0.28 \\pm 0.03 \\, (\\mathrm{stat}) \\pm 0.01 \\, (\\mathrm{syst}) . \\end{align*}\n", "  A multi-peaked form of the analytically extended function (AEF) is used for\napproximation of lightning current waveforms in this paper. The AEF function's\nparameters are estimated using the Marquardt least-squares method (MLSM), and\nthe general procedure for fitting the $p$-peaked AEF function to a waveform\nwith an arbitrary (finite) number of peaks is briefly described. This framework\nis used for obtaining parameters of 2-peaked waveforms typically present when\nmeasuring first negative stroke currents. Advantages, disadvantages and\npossible improvements of the approach are also discussed.\n", "  The statistical mechanical partition function can be used to construct\ndifferent forms of phase space distributions not restricted to the\nGibbs-Boltzmann factor. With a generalised Lorentzian both the Kappa-Bose and\nKappa-Fermi partition functions are obtained in straightforward way, from which\nthe conventional Bose and Fermi distributions follow for $\\kappa\\to\\infty$. For\n$\\kappa\\neq\\infty$ these are subject to the restrictions that they can be used\nonly at temperatures far from zero. They thus, as shown earlier, have little\nvalue for quantum physics. This is reasonable, because physical\n$\\kappa$-systems imply strong correlations which are absent at zero temperature\nwhere appart from stochastics all dynamical interactions are frozen. In the\nclassical large temperature limit one obtains physically reasonable\n$\\kappa$-distributions which depend on energy respectively momentum as well as\non chemical potential. Looking for other functional dependencies, we examine\nBessel functions whether they can be used for obtaining valid distributions.\nAgain and for the same reason, no Fermi and Bose distributions exist in the low\ntemperature limit. However, a classical Bessel-Boltzmann distribution can be\nconstructed which is a Bessel-modified Lorentzian distribution. Whether it\nmakes any physical sense remains an open question. This is not investigated\nhere. The choice of Bessel functions is motivated solely by their convergence\nproperties and not by reference to any physical demands. This result suggests\nthat the Gibbs-Boltzmann partition function is fundamental not only to\nGibbs-Boltzmann but also to a large class of generalised Lorentzian\ndistributions as well as to the corresponding nonextensive statistical\nmechanics.\n", "  In this paper we propose and analyse a Gedankenexperiment involving three\nnon-linear crystals and two objects inserted in the idler beams. We show that,\nbesides the behaviour that can be extrapolated from previous experiments\ninvolving two crystals and one object, we are able to predict a new effect:\nunder certain circumstances, one of the objects can be rendered undetectable to\nany single detection rate on the signal photons with discarded idler photons.\nThis effect could find applications in future developments of quantum imaging\ntechniques.\n", "  In a hierarchical Universe clusters grow via the accretion of galaxies from\nthe field, groups and even other clusters. As this happens, galaxies can lose\ntheir gas reservoirs via different mechanisms, eventually quenching their\nstar-formation. We explore the diverse environmental histories of galaxies\nthrough a multi-wavelength study of the combined effect of ram-pressure\nstripping and group \"processing\" in Abell 963, a massive growing cluster at\n$z=0.2$ from the Blind Ultra Deep HI Environmental Survey (BUDHIES). We\nincorporate hundreds of new optical redshifts (giving a total of 566 cluster\nmembers), as well as Subaru and XMM-Newton data from LoCuSS, to identify\nsubstructures and evaluate galaxy morphology, star-formation activity, and HI\ncontent (via HI deficiencies and stacking) out to $3\\times R_{200}$. We find\nthat Abell 963 is being fed by at least 7 groups, that contribute to the large\nnumber of passive galaxies outside the cluster core. More massive groups have a\nhigher fraction of passive and HI-poor galaxies, while low-mass groups host\nyounger (often interacting) galaxies. For cluster galaxies not associated with\ngroups we corroborate our previous finding that HI gas (if any) is\nsignificantly stripped via ram-pressure during their first passage through the\nintra-cluster medium, and find mild evidence for a starburst associated with\nthis event. In addition, we find an overabundance of morphologically peculiar\nand/or star-forming galaxies near the cluster core. We speculate that these\narise as groups pass through the cluster (post-processing). Our study\nhighlights the importance of environmental quenching and the complexity added\nby evolving environments.\n", "  An important issue in the asteroseismology of compact and magnetized stars is\nthe determination of the dissipation mechanism which is most efficient in\ndamping the oscillations when these are produced. In a linear regime and for\nlow-multipolarity modes these mechanisms are confined to either\ngravitational-wave or electromagnetic losses. We here consider the latter and\ncompute the energy losses in the form of Poynting fluxes, Joule heating and\nOhmic dissipation in a relativistic oscillating spherical star with a dipolar\nmagnetic field in vacuum. While this approach is not particularly realistic for\nrapidly rotating stars, it has the advantage that it is fully analytic and that\nit provides expressions for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the\nmost common modes of oscillation both in the vicinity of the star and far away\nfrom it. In this way we revisit and extend to a relativistic context the\nclassical estimates of McDermott et al. Overall, we find that\ngeneral-relativistic corrections lead to electromagnetic damping time-scales\nthat are at least one order of magnitude smaller than in Newtonian gravity.\nFurthermore, with the only exception of $g$ (gravity) modes, we find that $f$\n(fundamental), $p$ (pressure), $i$ (interface) and $s$ (shear) modes are\nsuppressed more efficiently by gravitational losses than by electromagnetic\nones.\n", "  Resonant nuclear reactions are a powerful tool for the determination of the\namount and profile of hydrogen in thin layers of material. Usually, this tool\nrequires the use of a standard of well-known composition. The present work, by\ncontrast, deals with standard-less hydrogen depth profiling. This approach\nrequires precise nuclear data, e.g. on the widely used\n$^{1}$H($^{15}$N,$\\alpha\\gamma$)$^{12}$C reaction, resonant at 6.4\\,MeV\n$^{15}$N beam energy. Here, the strongly anisotropic angular distribution of\nthe emitted $\\gamma$-rays from this resonance has been re-measured, resolving a\nprevious discrepancy. Coefficients of (0.38$\\pm$0.04) and (0.80$\\pm$0.04) have\nbeen deduced for the second and fourth order Legendre polynomials,\nrespectively. In addition, the resonance strength has been re-evaluated to\n(25.0$\\pm$1.5)\\,eV, 10\\% higher than previously reported. A simple working\nformula for the hydrogen concentration is given for cases with known\n$\\gamma$-ray detection efficiency. Finally, the absolute approach is\nillustrated using two examples.\n", "  We introduce a one-dimensional (1D) pseudospin model on a ladder where the\nIsing interactions along the legs and along the rungs alternate between\n$X_{i}X_{i+1}$ and $Z_{i}Z_{i+1}$ for even/odd bond (rung). We include also the\nnext nearest neighbor Ising interactions on plaquettes' diagonals that\nalternate in such a way that a model where only leg interactions are switched\non is equivalent to the one when only the diagonal ones are present. Thus in\nthe absence of rung interactions the model can interpolate between two 1D\ncompass models. The model posses local symmetries which are the parities within\neach $2\\times 2$ cell (plaquette) of the ladder. We find that for different\nvalues of the interaction it can realize ground states that differ by the\npatterns formed by these local parities. By exact diagonalization we derive\ndetailed phase diagrams for small systems of $L=4$, 6 and 8 plaquettes, and use\nnext $L=12$ to identify generic phases that appear in larger systems as well.\nAmong them we find a nematic phase with macroscopic degeneracy when the leg and\ndiagonal interactions are equal and the rung interactions are larger than a\ncritical value. The nematic phase is similar to the one found in the\ntwo-dimensional compass model. For particular parameters the low-energy sector\nof the present plaquette model reduces to a 1D compass model with spins $S=1$\nwhich suggests that it realizes peculiar crossovers within the class of compass\nmodels. Finally, we show that the model can realize phases with broken\ntranslation invariance which can be either dimerized, trimerized,\n\\textit{etcetera}, or completely disordered and highly entangled in a~well\nidentified window of the phase diagram.\n", "  We consider a toy model of interacting extrovert and introvert agents\nintroduced earlier by Liu et al [Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 100} (2012) 66007]. The\nnumber of extroverts, and introverts is $N$ each. At each time step, we select\nan agent at random, and allow her to modify her state. If an extrovert is\nselected, she adds a link at random to an unconnected introvert. If an\nintrovert is selected, she removes one of her links. The set of $N^2$ links\nevolves in time, and may be considered as a set of Ising spins on an $N \\times\nN$ square-grid with single-spin-flip dynamics. This dynamics satisfies detailed\nbalance condition, and the probability of different spin configurations in the\nsteady state can be determined exactly. The effective hamiltonian has\nlong-range multi-spin couplings that depend on the row and column sums of\nspins. If the relative bias of choosing an extrovert over an introvert is\nvaried, this system undergoes a phase transition from a state with very few\nlinks to one in which most links are occupied. We show that the behavior of the\nsystem can be determined exactly in the limit of large $N$. The behavior of\nlarge fluctuations in the total numer of links near the phase transition is\ndetermined. We also discuss two variations, called egalitarian and elitist\nagents, when the agents preferentially add or delete links to their least/\nmost-connected neighbor. These shows interesting cooperative behavior.\n", "  We consider spectral properties and the edge universality of sparse random\nmatrices, the class of random matrices that includes the adjacency matrices of\nthe Erdos-Renyi graph model $G(N,p)$. We prove a local law for the eigenvalue\ndensity up to the spectral edges. Under a suitable condition on the sparsity,\nwe also prove that the rescaled extremal eigenvalues exhibit GOE Tracy-Widom\nfluctuations if a deterministic shift of the spectral edge due to the sparsity\nis included. For the adjacency matrix of the Erdos-Renyi graph this establishes\nthe Tracy-Widom fluctuations of the second largest eigenvalue for $p\\gg\nN^{-2/3}$ with a deterministic shift of order $(Np)^{-1}$.\n", "  We study a new composite scenario of the lepton sector in the Standard Model\nby a de-gauging procedure called spin-charge separation and propose that\nleptons are bound states of some neutral fermions and Higgs bosons. Continuing\nthis procedure we may obtain more fundamental dark fermions. They become the\nphysical leptons by acquiring both charges and masses from some Higgs fields.\n", "  We present a new design for a confocal rheoscope that enables uniform\nuniaxial or biaxial shear. The design consists of two precisely-positioned\nparallel plates with a gap that can be adjusted down to 2$\\pm$0.1 \\mu m,\nallowing for the exploration of confinement effects. By using our shear cell in\nconjunction with a biaxial force measurement device and a high-speed confocal\nmicroscope, we are able to measure the real-time biaxial stress while\nsimultaneously imaging the material 3D structure. We illustrate the importance\nof the instrument capabilities by discussing the applications of this\ninstrument in current and future research topics in colloidal suspensions.\n", "  In this mainly survey paper we consider the Lagrangian $ L(x,v) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\, |v|^2 - V(x) $, and a closed form $w$ on the torus $ \\mathbb{T}^n $. For the\nassociated Hamiltonian we consider the the Schrodinger operator ${\\bf\nH}_\\beta=\\, -\\,\\frac{1}{2 \\beta^2} \\, \\Delta +V$ where $\\beta$ is large real\nparameter. Moreover, for the given form $\\beta\\, w$ we consider the associated\ntwist operator ${\\bf H}_\\beta^w$. We denote by $({\\bf H}_\\beta^w)^*$ the\ncorresponding backward operator. We are interested in the positive\neigenfunction $ \\psi_\\beta$ associated to the the eigenvalue $ E_\\beta$ for the\noperator ${\\bf H}_\\beta^{w} $. We denote $ \\psi_\\beta^*$ the positive\neigenfunction associated to the the eigenvalue $ E_\\beta$ for the operator\n$({\\bf H}_\\beta^{w})^* $. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic limit of the\nprobability $\\nu_\\beta= \\psi_\\beta\\, \\psi_\\beta^*$ on the torus when $\\beta \\to\n\\infty$. The limit probability is a Mather measure. We consider Large\ndeviations properties and we derive a result on Transport Theory. We denote\n$L^{-}(x,v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\, |v|^2 - V(x) - w_x(v) $ and $L^{+}(x,v) =\n\\frac{1}{2} \\, |v|^2 - V(x) + w_x(v) $. We are interest in the transport\nproblem from $\\mu_{-}$ (the Mather measure for $L^{-}$) to $\\mu_{+}$ (the\nMather measure for $L^{+}$) for some natural cost function. In the case the\nmaximizing probability is unique we use a Large Deviation Principle due to N.\nAnantharaman in order to show that the conjugated sub-solutions $u$ and $u^*$\ndefine an admissible pair which is optimal for the dual Kantorovich problem.\n", "  The 2015 update of the discovery of nuclide project is presented. Twenty new\nnuclides were observed for the first time in 2015. An overall review of all\nprevious assignments was made in order to apply the discovery criteria\nconsistently to all elements. In addition, a list of isotopes published so far\nonly in conference proceedings or internal reports is included.\n", "  First principles electronic structure calculations of A-15 type Nb$_3$X (X =\nAl, Ga, In, Ge and Sn) compounds are performed at ambient and high pressures.\nMechanical stability is confirmed in all the compounds both at ambient as well\nas under compression from the calculated elastic constants. We have observed\nfour holes and two electron Fermi surfaces (FS) for all the compounds studied\nand FS nesting feature is observed at M and along X - $\\Gamma$ in all the\ncompounds. A continuous change in the FS topology is observed under pressure in\nall the compounds which is also reflected in the calculated elastic constants\nand density of states under pressure indicating the Electronic topological\ntransitions (ETT). The ETT observed at around 21.5 GPa, 17.5 GPa in Nb$_3$Al\nand Nb$_3$Ga are in good agreement with the anomalies observed by the\nexperiments.\n", "  The investigation of metasurface, which is of great current interest, has\nopened up new degrees of freedom to research metamaterials. In this paper, we\npropose an ultrathin acoustic metasurface consisting of a series of\nstructurally simple drum-like subunit cells. Eight units with different sizes\naer selected to realize discrete transmisson phase shifts ranging from 0 to 360\ndegrees ar 3.5 KHz. The designed metasurface is capable of manipulating sound\nwaves at will, including anomalous refraction and conversion of propagating\nwaves into surface waves, which can be predicted precisely by the generalized\nSnell's law. It id worth noting that the total thickness of such planar\nmetasurface is approximately 1/5 of working wavelength, which may be beneficial\nto the miniaturization and integration of acoustic equipment.\n", "  We demonstrate thin, flexible, metamaterial films with a strong, narrowband,\npolarization- and angle-insensitive absorption designed for wavelengths near\none millimeter. These structures, fabricated by photolithography on a\ncommercially available, copper-backed polyimide substrate, are nearly\nindistinguishable to the unaided human eye but can be easily observed by\nimaging at the resonance frequency of the film. We demonstrate that these\npatterns can be used to mark or barcode objects for secure identification with\na terahertz imaging system.\n", "  We present the experimental and theoretical details of our recent published\nletter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115. 123002] on synchronized high-harmonic and\nterahertz-wave spectroscopy (HATS) from nonadiabatically aligned nitrogen\nmolecules in dual-color laser fields. Associating the alignment-angle dependent\nterahertz wave generation with the synchronizing high-harmonic signal, the\nangular differential photoionization cross section (PICS) for molecules can be\nreconstructed, and the minima of the angle on PICS show great convergence\nbetween the theoretical predictions and the experimental deduced results. We\nalso show the optimal relative phase between the dual-color laser fields for\nterahertz wave generation dose not change with the alignment angle at a\nprecision of $50$ attoseconds. This all-optical method provides an alternative\nfor investigating molecular structures and dynamics.\n", "  As research-based self-paced e-learning tools become increasingly available,\na critical issue educators encounter is implementing strategies to ensure that\nall students engage with them as intended. Here, we discuss the effectiveness\nof research-based e-learning tutorials as self-paced learning tools in large\nenrollment brick and mortar introductory physics courses. These interactive\ntutorials were developed via research in physics education and were found to be\neffective for a diverse group of introductory physics students in one-on-one\nimplementation. Instructors encouraged the use of these self-paced tools in a\nself-paced learning environment by telling students that they would be helpful\nfor solving the assigned homework problems and that the underlying physics\nprinciples in the tutorial problems would be similar to those in the in-class\nquizzes (which we call paired problems). We find that many students, who\nstruggled in the courses in which these adaptive e-learning tutorials were\nassigned as a self-study tool, performed poorly on the paired problems. In\ncontrast, a majority of student volunteers in one-on-one implementation greatly\nbenefited from the tutorials and performed well on the paired problems. This\nsuggests that many students enrolled in introductory physics courses did not\neffectively engage with the self-paced tutorials outside of class and may have\nonly used them superficially. The findings suggest that many students in need\nof out-of-class remediation via self-paced learning tools may have difficulty\nmotivating themselves and may lack the self-regulation and time-management\nskills to engage effectively with tools specially designed to help them learn\nat their own pace. We conclude by proposing a theoretical framework to help\nstudents with diverse prior preparations engage effectively with self-study\ntools.\n", "  A triangular triple quantum dot gives various Kondo effects, such as the\nemergence of an electric polarization accompanied by a complete compensation of\nspin degrees of freedom. The interplay of spin and charge of electrons in\nquantum dots is investigated using an Anderson model with an equilateral\ntriangular spin cluster, in which a single electron state at one site is\nhybridized with a conduction band in a lead. The numerical renormalization\ngroup analysis shows how a nonzero electric polarization develops with local\nelectrons traveling in the loop and how it depends on the hybridization\nstrength as an experimentally controllable parameter in the Kondo effect.\n", "  The production of high invariant mass opposite sign lepton pairs in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC is dominated by the Drell-Yan process. In\naddition to this photon or Z exchange mediated mechanism, gamma-gamma\ncollisions, where photons radiated by the incoming protons collide, can produce\nlepton pairs. This is an important additional source of background for high\nmass resonant (like Z') or non-resonant (like contact interactions) searches.\nIn this paper detailed calculations of the Drell-Yan and photon-induced cross\nsections in the typical acceptance of a multi-purpose LHC detector at center of\nmass energy 13 TeV are presented. The hint for a diphoton excess at a mass\naround 750 GeV, reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments from the analysis of\nthe 2015 data at 13 TeV, raises the possibility that such an excess could be\nproduced through gamma-gamma collisions. A good theoretical understanding and\nmeasurements in the dilepton channels at these energies can help to elucidate\nthis production hypothesis.\n", "  In the companion paper [T. S. Ingebrigtsen and H. Tanaka, J. Phys. Chem. B\n119, 11052 (2015)] the effect of size polydispersity on the nature of\nLennard-Jones (LJ) liquids, which represent most molecular liquids without\nhydrogen bonds, was studied. More specifically, it was shown that even highly\nsize polydisperse LJ liquids are Roskilde-simple (RS) liquids. RS liquids are\nliquids with strong correlation between constant volume equilibrium\nfluctuations of virial and potential energy and are simpler than other types of\nliquids. Moreover, it was shown that size polydisperse LJ liquids have\nisomorphs to a good approximation. Isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of\nRS liquids along which structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities\nare invariant in dimensionless (reduced) units. In this paper, we study the\neffect of energy polydispersity on the nature of LJ liquids. We show that\nenergy polydisperse LJ liquids are RS liquids. However, a tendency of particle\nsegregation which increases with the degree of polydispersity leads to a loss\nof strong virial-potential energy correlation, but is mitigated with increasing\ntemperature and/or density. Isomorphs are a good approximation also for energy\npolydisperse LJ liquids, although particle-resolved quantities display a\nsomewhat poorer scaling compared to the mean quantities along the isomorph.\n", "  Mode-locked fiber lasers are one of the most important sources of ultra-short\npulses. However, A unified description for the rich variety of states and the\ndriving forces behind the complex and diverse nonlinear behavior of mode-locked\nfiber lasers have yet to be developed. Here we present a comprehensive\ntheoretical framework based upon complexity science, thereby offering a\nfundamentally new way of thinking about the behavior of mode-locked fiber\nlasers. This hierarchically structured frame work provide a model with and\nchangeable variable dimensionality resulting in a simple and elegant view, with\nwhich numerous complex states can be described systematically. The existence of\na set of new mode-locked fiber laser states is proposed for the first time.\nMoreover, research into the attractors' basins reveals the origin of\nstochasticity, hysteresis and multistability in these systems. These findings\npave the way for dynamics analysis and new system designs of mode-locked fiber\nlasers. The paradigm will have a wide range of potential applications in\ndiverse research fields.\n", "  We used the parton and hadron cascade (PACIAE) model and the dynamically\nconstrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model to investigate the production\nof (anti)hypertriton and light (anti)nuclei generated by 0-10% centrality\n12C+12C, 24Mg+24Mg, 40Ca+40Ca and 64Cu+64Cu collisions at \\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} =\n200 GeV with |y| < 1.5 and pT < 5. We studied the yield ratios of antiparticle\nto particle and the rapidity distributions of the different (anti)nuclei, and\nfound that the amount of antimatter produced is significantly lower than that\nof the corresponding particles, the results of theoretical model are well\nconsistent with PHOBOS data. The yield ratios of the particle to antiparticle\nin different transverse momentum region is also given, and we found the ratios\nis increased with the increase of the transverse momentum.\n", "  The high-spin rotational bands in odd-$Z$ nuclei $^{159}$Ho ($Z=67$) are\ninvestigated using the cranked shell model with the pairing correlations\ntreated by a particle-number conserving method, in which the blocking effects\nare taken into account exactly. The experimental moments of inertia and\nalignments and their variations with the rotational frequency $\\hbar\\omega$ are\nreproduced very well by the calculations. The splitting between the signature\npartners of the yrast band $7/2^-[523]$ is discussed and the splitting of the\nexcited band $7/2^+[404]$ above $\\hbar\\omega \\sim 0.30$~MeV is predicted due to\nthe level crossing with $1/2^+[411]$. The calculated $B(E2)$ transition\nprobabilities are also suggested for future experiments.\n", "  In this paper we use three-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell\nsimulations to investigate the interaction of a small-Larmor radius plasma\ncloud/jet with a transverse non-uniform magnetic field typical to a tangential\ndiscontinuity in a parallel geometry. The simulation setup corresponds to an\nidealized, yet relevant, magnetospheric configuration likely to be observed at\nthe magnetopause during northward orientation of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield. The numerical simulations are adapted to study the kinetic effects and\ntheir role on the transport and entry of localized plasma jets similar to those\nidentified inside the Earth's magnetosheath propagating towards the\nmagnetopause. The simulations reveal the formation of a polarization electric\nfield inside the main bulk of the plasma cloud that enables its forward\ntransport and entry across the transverse magnetic field. The jet is able to\npenetrate the transition region when the height of the magnetic barrier does\nnot exceed a certain critical threshold. Otherwise, the forward transport along\nthe injection direction is stopped before full penetration of the magnetopause.\nMoreover, the jet is pushed back and simultaneously deflected in the\nperpendicular plane to the magnetic field. Our simulations evidence physical\nprocesses advocated previously by the theoretical model of impulsive\npenetration and revealed in laboratory experiments.\n", "  A consistent model for the description of non-Maxwellian nuclear processes in\nthe solar core triggered by fast reaction-produced particles is formulated. It\nessentially extends an approach to study suprathermal solar reactions discussed\npreviously [Phys. Rev. C 91, 028801 (2015)] and refines its predictions. The\nmodel is applied to examine in detail the slowing-down of 8.7-MeV alpha\nparticles produced in the 7Li(p,alpha)alpha reaction of the pp chain, and to\nstudy suprathermal processes in the solar CNO cycle induced by them. The\ninfluence of electron degeneracy and electron screening on suprathermal\nreactions through in-flight reaction probability and fast particle emission\nrate is clarified. In particular, these effects account for a 20% increase of\nthe 14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate at R < 0.2Rsun. This new type of correction\nis important for the suprathermal reaction like 14N(alpha,p)17O as it is\nrecognized to be capable of distorting the CNO cycle in the 95% region of the\nsolar core. In this region, normal branching 14N <-- 17O --> 18F of nuclear\nflow transforms to abnormal sequential flow 14N --> 17O --> 18F, and the\n14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate exceeds the rate of 17O burn up through\nconventional 17O(p,alpha)14N and 17O(p,gamma)18F processes. It is shown that\nthese factors can enhance the 17O abundance in the core as compared with\nstandard estimates. For the steady state case, the abundance enhancement is\nestimated to be as high as ~ 100 in the outer core region. A conjecture is made\nthat other CNO suprathermal (alpha,p) reactions may also alter abundances of\nCNO elements, including those generating solar neutrinos.\n", "  We measured the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial\npeptide pexiganan acting on Escherichia coli, and report an intrinsic\nvariability in such measurements. These results led to a detailed study of the\neffect of pexiganan on the growth curve of E. coli, using a plate reader and\nmanual plating (i.e. time-kill curves). The measured growth curves, together\nwith single-cell observations and peptide depletion assays, suggested that\naddition of a sub-MIC concentration of pexiganan to a population of this\nbacterium killed a fraction of the cells, reducing peptide activity during the\nprocess, while leaving the remaining cells unaffected. This pharmacodynamic\nhypothesis suggests a considerable inoculum effect, which we quantified. Our\nresults cast doubt on the use of the MIC as 'a measure of the concentration\nneeded for peptide action' and show how 'coarse-grained' studies at the\npopulation level give vital information for the correct planning and\ninterpretation of MIC measurements.\n", "  The structure of plasma flows in close binary systems in which one of the\ncomponents is a rapidly rotating magnetic white dwarf is studied. The main\nexample considered is the AE Aquarii system; the spin period of the white dwarf\nis about a factor of 1000 shorter than the orbital period, and the magnetic\nfield on the white dwarf surface is of order of 50 MG. The mass transfer in\nthis system was analyzed via numerical solution of the system of MHD equations.\nThese computations show that the magnetic field of the white dwarf does not\nsignificantly influence the velocity field of the material in its Roche lobe in\nthe case of laminar flow regime, so that the field does not hinder the\nformation of a transient disk (ring) surrounding the magnetosphere. However,\nthe efficiency of the energy and angular momentum exchange between the white\ndwarf and the surrounding material increases considerably with the development\nof turbulent motions in the matter, resulting in its acceleration at the\nmagnetospheric boundary and further escape from the system at a high rate. The\ntime scales of the transition of the system between the laminar and turbulent\nmodes are close to those of the AE\\,Aqr transition between its quiet and active\nphases.\n", "  It is very common to observe nonlinear features in agricultural and\necological systems. For example, in tree crop production, alternate bearing is\nwell known phenomena caused by nonlinear dynamics. Production of single tree of\nCitrus Unshiu trees is recognized to be driven by a mechanistic process modeled\nwith the so-called \"resource budget model\", which demonstrates phenomenon of\nalternate bearing. However, the term of alternative bearing is used not only\nfor an individual tree's production but also for total production of a large\nsized population of trees. In this paper, we developed noise induced uncoupled\ndynamics model for population alternate bearing based on Isagi's resource\nbudget model. Based on numerical experiments with the developed model,\ntheoretical possibility of a substantial alternate bearing effect even in a\nnational market was proposed.\n", "  Design a surface mount 14-PIN Cockcroft-Walton photomultiplier tube base for\na muon detector, which provides both high voltage power supply and signal\nprocessing. The whole system, including the detector, adopts a +5V DC power\ninput, and features as tiny size, low power-consumption and good portability,\nextremely well meeting the requirements of the power supply with a battery on a\nmobile workstation. Detailed descriptions and test results of a prototype are\npresented.\n", "  The Newtonian dynamics of strongly confined fluids exhibits a rich behavior.\nIts confined and unconfined degrees of freedom decouple for confinement length\n$L \\to 0$. In that case and for a slit geometry the intermediate scattering\nfunctions $S_{\\mu\\nu}(q,t)$ simplify, resulting for $(\\mu,\\nu) \\neq (0,0)$ in a\nKnudsen-gas like behavior of the confined degrees of freedom, and otherwise in\n$S_{\\parallel}(q,t)$, describing the structural relaxation of the unconfined\nones. Taking the coupling into account we prove that the energy fluctuations\nrelax exponentially. For smooth potentials the relaxation times diverge as\n$L^{-3}$ and $L^{-4}$, respectively, for the confined and unconfined degrees of\nfreedom. The strength of the $L^{-3}$ divergence can be calculated\nanalytically. It depends on the pair potential and the two-dimensional pair\ndistribution function. Experimental setups are suggested to test these\npredictions.\n", "  The unique ability of chaotic advection under micro-scale confinement to\ndirect chemical processes along accelerated kinetic pathways has long been\nrecognized. But practical applications have been slow to emerge because optimal\nresults are often counter-intuitively achieved in flows that appear to possess\nundesirably high disorder. Here we demonstrate how thermally actuated chaotic\nphenomena within these microenvironments are capable of establishing a\ncontinuous conveyor transporting chemical compounds from the bulk to targeted\nlocations on solid boundaries where they become greatly enriched. These\nfindings intriguingly suggest that microscale chaotic advection may offer a\nnew- mechanism to explain emergence of biomolecular complexity from dilute\norganic precursors in the prebiotic milieu-a key unanswered question in the\norigin of life. We further show how these flows can be rationally designed and\nharnessed to execute bulk biochemical processes with a level of robustness\npreviously thought unattainable.\n", "  We experimentally and numerically study the precise role of geometry for the\nmechanics of biholar metamaterials, quasi-2D slabs of rubber patterned by\ncircular holes of two alternating sizes. We recently showed how the response to\nuniaxial compression of these metamaterials can be programmed by their lateral\nconfinement $^1$. In particular, there is a range of confining strains\n$\\varepsilon_x$ for which the resistance to compression becomes non-trivial -\nnon-monotonic or hysteretic - in a range of compressive strains\n$\\varepsilon_y$. Here we show how the dimensionless geometrical parameters $t$\nand $\\chi$, which characterize the porosity and size ratio of the holes that\npattern these metamaterials, can significantly tune these ranges over a wide\nrange. We study the behavior for the limiting cases where $t$ and $\\chi$ become\nlarge, and discuss the new physics that arises there. Away from these extreme\nlimits, the variation of the strain ranges of interest is smooth with porosity,\nbut the variation with size ratio evidences a cross-over at low $\\chi$ from\nbiholar to monoholar (equal sized holes) behavior, related to the elastic\ninstabilities in purely monoholar metamaterials$^2$. Our study provides precise\nguidelines for the rational design of programmable biholar metamaterials,\ntailored to specific applications, and indicates that the widest range of\nprogrammability arises for moderate values of both $t$ and $\\chi$.\n", "  We construct the effective model based on QCD with gluon condensate. Under\nthe assumption that the gluons are condensed with the sharp momentum peak in\nthe momentum space, we formulate the effective field theory incorporating both\nthe gluon condensate and the chiral condensate, then study the phase transition\non temperature and chemical potential plane with respect to two condensates. We\nfind that the condensates decrease with increasing temperature, which is\nreliable tendency on the condensate being consistent with the argument of the\nasymptotic behavior.\n", "  Since the end of the eighties, in response to a reported increase of the\ntotal neutrino flux in the Homestake experiment in coincidence with solar\nflares, neutrino detectors have searched for signals of neutrinos associated\nwith solar flare activity. Protons which are accelerated by the magnetic\nstructures of such flares may collide with the solar atmosphere, producing\nmesons which subsequently decay, resulting in neutrinos at O(MeV-GeV) energies.\nThe study of such neutrinos would provide a new window on the underlying\nphysics of the acceleration process. The sensitivity to solar flares of the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the geographical South Pole, is\ncurrently under study. We introduce a new approach for a time profile analysis.\nThis is based on a stacking method of selected solar flares which are likely to\nbe connected with pion production. An initial approach towards a neutrino\nsearch using the current IceCube experiment as well as first efforts to improve\nthe detection efficiency in the future are presented.\n", "  Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are chemo-mechanical oscillators capable of\ngenerating long-range coordinated motions known as metachronal waves. Pair\nsynchronization is a fundamental requirement for these collective dynamics, but\nit is generally not sufficient for collective phase-locking, chiefly due to the\neffect of long-range interactions. Here we explore experimentally and\nnumerically a minimal model for a ciliated surface; hydrodynamically coupled\noscillators rotating above a no-slip plane. Increasing their distance from the\nwall profoundly effects the global dynamics, due to variations in hydrodynamic\ninteraction range. The array undergoes a transition from a traveling wave to\neither a steady chevron pattern or one punctuated by periodic phase defects.\nWithin the transition between these regimes the system displays behavior\nreminiscent of chimera states.\n", "  We model the shape and spin characteristics of an object population when\nthere are not enough data to model its single members. The data are random\nprojection areas of the members. We construct a mapping $f(x)\\rightarrow C(y)$,\n$x\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$, $y\\in\\mathbb{R}$, where $f(x)$ is the distribution function\nof the shape elongation and spin vector obliquity, and $C(y)$ is the cumulative\ndistribution function of an observable $y$ describing the variation of the\nobserved projection areas of one member, and show that the mapping is\ninvertible. Using the projected area of an ellipsoid as our model, we obtain\nanalytical basis functions for a function series of $C(y)$ and prove uniqueness\nand stability properties of the inverse problem. Even though the model error is\nconsiderably larger than the measurement noise for realistic cases of arbitrary\nshapes (such as asteroids), the main characteristics of $f(x)$ (such as the\nlocations of peaks) are robustly recovered from the data.\n", "  Background: Synthesis of superheavy elements (SHE) with fusion-evaporation\nreactions is strongly hindered by the quasifission (QF) mechanism which\nprevents the formation of an equilibrated compound nucleus and which depends on\nthe structure of the reactants. New SHE have been recently produced with\ndoubly-magic $^{48}$Ca beams. However, SHE synthesis experiments with\nsingle-magic $^{50}$Ti beams have so far been unsuccessful. Purpose: In\nconnection with experimental searches for $Z=117,119$ superheavy elements, we\nperform a theoretical study of fusion and quasifission mechanisms in\n$^{48}$Ca,$^{50}$Ti+$^{249}$Bk reactions in order to investigate possible\ndifferences in reaction mechanisms induced by these two projectiles. Methods:\nThe collision dynamics and the outcome of the reactions are studied using\nunrestricted time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations as well as the\ndensity-constrained TDHF method to extract the nucleus-nucleus potentials and\nthe excitation energy in each fragment. Results: Nucleus-nucleus potentials,\nnuclear contact times, masses and charges of the fragments, as well as their\nkinetic and excitation energies strongly depend on the orientation of the\nprolate $^{249}$Bk nucleus. Long contact times associated with fusion are\nobserved in collisions of both projectiles with the side of the $^{249}$Bk\nnucleus, but not on collisions with its tip. The energy and impact parameter\ndependences of the fragment properties, as well as their mass-angle and\nmass-total kinetic energy correlations are investigated. Conclusions: Entrance\nchannel reaction dynamics are similar with both $^{48}$Ca and $^{50}$Ti\nprojectiles. Both are expected to lead to the formation of a compound nucleus\nby fusion if they have enough energy to get in contact with the side of the\n$^{249}$Bk target.\n", "  In this paper we find an equivalent mean-field description for asymptotically\n$AdS$ black hole in high temperature limit and in arbitrary dimensions. We\nobtain a class of mean-field potential for which the description is valid. We\nexplicitly show that there is an one to one correspondence between the\nthermodynamics of a gas of interacting particles moving under a mean-field\npotential and an $AdS$ black hole, namely the equation of state, temperature,\npressure, entropy and enthalpy of both the systems match. In $3+1$ dimensions,\nin particular, the mean-field description can be thought of as an ensemble of\ntiny interacting {\\it asymptotically flat} black holes moving in volume $V$ and\nat temperature $T$. This motivates us to identify these asymptotically flat\nblack holes as microstructure of asymptotically $AdS$ black holes in $3+1$\ndimensions.\n", "  The parameter epsilon_K, that quantifies CP violation in kaon mixing, is the\nobservable setting the strongest constraints on new physics with a generic\nflavour and CP structure. While its experimental uncertainty is at the half\npercent level, the theoretical one is at the level of 15%. One of the largest\nsources of the latter uncertainty is the poor perturbative behaviour of the\nshort-distance contribution of the box diagram with two charm quarks. In this\nproceeding, based on arXiv:1602.08494, I summarise how that contribution can be\nremoved, from the imaginary part of the mixing amplitude, by a rephasing of the\nkaon fields. A first outcome is a mild reduction of the total theoretical\nuncertainty of epsilon_K: while this might look counterintuitive at first\nsight, if different \"pieces\" (i.e. short- and long-distance) of an observable\nare computed with different techniques, then it is possible to choose a phase\nconvention where the total uncertainty of that observable is optimised.\nMoreover, it is worthy to discuss if and how this freedom of rephasing, which\nhas been somehow overlooked in the past, can help in making progress in lattice\nQCD computations of immediate relevance for epsilon_K.\n", "  Short-range repulsion within inter-molecular force fields is conventionally\ndescribed by either Lennard-Jones (${A}/{r^{12}}$) or Born-Mayer ($A\\exp(-Br)$)\nforms. Despite their widespread use, these simple functional forms are often\nunable to describe the interaction energy accurately over a broad range of\ninter-molecular distances, thus creating challenges in the development of ab\ninitio force fields and potentially leading to decreased accuracy and\ntransferability. Herein, we derive a novel short-range functional form based on\na simple Slater-like model of overlapping atomic densities and an iterated\nstockholder atom (ISA) partitioning of the molecular electron density. We\ndemonstrate that this Slater-ISA methodology yields a more accurate,\ntransferable, and robust description of the short-range interactions at minimal\nadditional computational cost compared to standard Lennard-Jones or Born-Mayer\napproaches. Finally, we show how this methodology can be adapted to yield the\nstandard Born-Mayer functional form while still retaining many of the\nadvantages of the Slater-ISA approach.\n", "  The discovery of a neutrino line or, more broadly, a sharp feature in\nneutrino data could provide a striking hint for the existence of the dark\nmatter particle. We review here a search for sharp spectral features using\nneutrino data from IceCube. No significant hint for a signal from decaying dark\nmatter was found in the analysed dataset. Yet, we show a strong improvement of\nthe limits, which makes it worth discussing how they compare to the limits\nobtained from gamma-ray data.\n", "  High brilliance muon beams are needed for future facilities such as a\nNeutrino Factory, an Higgs-factory or a multi-TeV Muon Collider. The R&D path\ninvolves many aspects, of which cooling of the incoming muon beams is\nessential.\n", "  Supersonic turbulence is believed to be at the heart of star formation. We\nhave performed smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations of\nthe small-scale dynamo amplification of magnetic fields in supersonic\nturbulence. The calculations use isothermal gas driven at rms velocity of Mach\n10 so that conditions are representative of star-forming molecular clouds in\nthe Milky Way. The growth of magnetic energy is followed for 10 orders in\nmagnitude until it reaches saturation, a few percent of the kinetic energy. The\nresults of our dynamo calculations are compared with results from grid-based\nmethods, finding excellent agreement on their statistics and their qualitative\nbehaviour. The simulations utilise the latest algorithmic developments we have\ndeveloped, in particular, a new divergence cleaning approach to maintain the\nsolenoidal constraint on the magnetic field and a method to reduce the\nnumerical dissipation of the magnetic shock capturing scheme. We demonstrate\nthat our divergence cleaning method may be used to achieve $\\nabla \\cdot {\\bf\nB}=0$ to machine precision, albeit at significant computational expense.\n", "  We show that any nonextremal black hole can be described by a Liouville\ntheory that lives on its very near horizon region. In classical Liouville\ntheory, the black hole corresponds to a field configuration that reproduces the\nRindler metric. In quantum Liouville theory, the black hole state in the CFT is\ncreated by the puncture operator that gives rise to a conical singularity with\na deficit angle of $2 \\pi$. This state is \"heavy\" with a nonnormalizable wave\nfunction in the minisuperspace approximation. Black hole entropy counts the\nnumber of ways the \"heavy\" black hole state can be obtained by acting with a\nproduct of \"light, quantum\" operators in the CFT. Black hole hair is described\nby the \"background charge\" in the CFT but its physical nature is unclear.\n", "  Electroweak theory is extended to $SU_L(2)\\times U_Y(1)\\times U_{\\phi}(1)$,\nwhere $U_{\\phi}(1)$ comes from the coupling of inflaton field to Higgs field.\nThere arises an extremely light boson, $Y_{\\mu}$. We resemble it as the\nwavelike dark matter, $\\Psi$DM, through the dynamical analysis. The\ninteractions of $Y_{\\mu}$ may provide an explanation for the Bullet Cluster\nobservations. Besides, a possible mechanism to produce $Y_{\\mu}$ is discussed.\n", "  This thesis presents the theoretical, conceptual and methodological aspects\nthat support the modeling of dynamical systems (DS) by using several agents.\nThe modeling approach permits the assessment of properties representing order,\nchange, equilibrium, adaptability, and autonomy, in DS. The modeling processes\nwere supported by a conceptual corpus regarding systems dynamics, multi-agent\nsystems, graph theory, and, particularly, the information theory. Besides to\nthe specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of\nagents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity\nof such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with\nemergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were\ndefined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was\ncarried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and\necological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development\nof a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger\nset of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in\nquestioning essential issues associated with the DS field. All this was\nachieved from a simple base of calculation and interpretation, which does not\nrequire advanced mathematical knowledge, and facilitates their application in\ndifferent fields of science.\n", "  We present a collection of results concerning the structure of reversible\ngate classes over non-binary alphabets, including (1) a reversible gate class\nover non-binary alphabets that is not finitely generated (2) an explicit set of\ngenerators for the class of all gates, the class of all conservative gates, and\na class of generalizations of the two (3) an embedding of the poset of\nreversible gate classes over an alphabet of size $k$ into that of an alphabet\nof size $k+1$ (4) a classification of gate classes containing the class of\n$(k-1,1)$-conservative gates, meaning gates that preserve the number of\noccurrences of a certain element in the alphabet.\n", "  We study some linear and nonlinear shot noise models where the jumps are\ndrawn from a compound Poisson process with jump sizes following an Erlang-$m$\ndistribution. We show that the associated Master equation can be written as a\nspatial $m^{{\\rm th}}$ order partial differential equation without integral\nterm. This differential form is valid for state-dependent Poisson rates and we\nuse it to characterize, via a mean-field approach, the collective dynamics of a\nlarge population of pure jump processes interacting via their Poisson rates. We\nexplicitly show that for an appropriate class of interactions, the speed of a\ntight collective traveling wave behavior can be triggered by the jump size\nparameter $m$. As a second application we consider an exceptional class of\nstochastic differential equations with nonlinear drift, Poisson shot noise and\nan additional White Gaussian Noise term, for which explicit solutions to the\nassociated Master equation are derived.\n", "  This thesis presents recent studies on test scalar and vector fields around\nblack holes. It is separated in two parts according to the asymptotic\nproperties of the spacetime under study. In the first part, we investigate\nscalar and Proca fields on an asymptotically flat background. For the Proca\nfield, we obtain a complete set of equations of motion in higher dimensional\nspherically symmetric backgrounds. These equations are solved numerically, both\nto compute Hawking radiation spectra and quasi-bound states. In the former\ncase, we carry out a precise study of the longitudinal degrees of freedom\ninduced by the field mass. This can be used to improve the model in the black\nhole event generators currently used at the Large Hadron Collider. Regarding\nquasi-bound states, we find arbitrarily long lived modes for a charged Proca\nfield, as well as for a charged scalar field, in a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nhole. The second part of this thesis presents research on superradiant\ninstabilities of scalar and Maxwell fields on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nbackground. For the scalar case, we introduce a charge coupling between the\nfield and the background, and show that superradiant instabilities do exist for\nall $\\ell$ modes, in higher dimensions. For the Maxwell case, we first propose\na general prescription to impose boundary conditions on the Kerr-anti-de Sitter\nspacetime, and obtain two Robin boundary conditions. Then these two conditions\nare implemented to study superradiant unstable modes and vector clouds. In\nparticular, we find that the new branch of quasinormal modes may be unstable in\na larger parameter space. Furthermore, the existence of vector clouds indicates\nthat one may find a vector hairy black hole solution for the\nEinstein-Maxwell-anti-de Sitter system at the nonlinear level, which implies\nthat, in such system, the Kerr-Newman-anti-de Sitter black hole is not a unique\nsolution.\n", "  Current supercapacitors present several distinct limitations that severely\ninhibit the efficiency, power, and electrical capacitance of energy storage\ndevices. Supercapacitors present an exciting prospect that has countless\napplications in renewable energy storage and modern day electronic devices. In\nrecent years the exciting development of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has presented\nan advantage in electrode development. CNTs, however beneficial for their\nincreased electrode surface area, have severe limitations regarding\nconductivity and electrode density. Creating a nanocomposite hybrid out of a\ntransition metal-oxide and carbon nanotube array would help the current\nlimitations of the modern supercapacitor. TiO2 was chosen for its common\noccurrence in everyday materials and promising capacitance levels. A\nmulti-walled carbon nanotube array was grown on a SiO2 precursor via CCVD. The\ntransition metal oxide was then deposited via RF Sputtering methods to a MWCNT\narray. Recharge tests and characterization were conducted using scanning\ncapacitance microscopy (SCM). While these tests are preliminary, this novel\nhybrid electrode represents an exciting prospect for the future of the\nefficiency of electrochemical energy storage as well as an advance towards a\nfuture of providing inexpensive energy storage solutions around the world.\n", "  The article discusses a possibility of removing smog particles from a boiler\nsmoke. To do this, the boiler smoke is passed through a flow of gamma\nradiation, formed by interaction of the microtron beam with a heavy target. The\nenergy of the microtron electrons twenty five megaelectronvolts, the beam\ncurrent one hundred microamperes. Smog particles are ionized with gamma\nradiation and then sat down on the plates of the electrostatic filter. The\nheight of the filter plates is one m, the electric field between the plates one\nkilovolt per centimeter.
