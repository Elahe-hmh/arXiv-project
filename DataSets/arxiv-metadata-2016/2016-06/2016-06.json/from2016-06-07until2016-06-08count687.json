We detected four diffuse clumps with strong line emission at 6.4keV,\nKa from neutral or low-ionized Fe. One of them, M359.38-0.00, is newly\ndiscovered with Suzaku. The X-ray spectra of the two bright clumps,\nM359.43-0.07 and M359.47-0.15, after subtracting the Galactic center diffuse\nX-ray emission (GCDX), exhibit strong Ka line from FeI with large equivalent\nwidths (EWs) of 2.0-2.2keV and clear Kb of FeI. The GCDX in the Sgr C region is\ncomposed of the 6.4keV- and 6.7keV-associated components. These are\nphenomenologically decomposed by taking relations between EWs of the 6.4keV and\n6.7keV lines. Then the former EWs against the associated continuum in the\nbright clump regions are estimated to be 2.4(+2.3_-0.7)keV. Since the two\ndifferent approaches give similar large EWs of 2keV, we strongly suggest that\nthe 6.4keV clumps in the Sgr C region are due to X-ray reflection/fluorescence\n(the X-ray reflection nebulae).\n", "  Schroedinger's first proposal for the interpretation of quantum mechanics was\nbased on a postulate relating the wave function on configuration space to\ncharge density in physical space. Schroedinger apparently later thought that\nhis proposal was empirically wrong. We argue here that this is not the case, at\nleast for a very similar proposal with charge density replaced by mass density.\nWe argue that when analyzed carefully this theory is seen to be an empirically\nadequate many-worlds theory and not an empirically inadequate theory describing\na single world. Moreover, this formulation--Schroedinger's first quantum\ntheory--can be regarded as a formulation of the many-worlds view of quantum\nmechanics that is ontologically clearer than Everett's.\n", "  CMB experiments aiming at a precise measurement of the CMB polarization, such\nas the Planck satellite, need a strong polarized absolute calibrator on the sky\nto accurately set the detectors polarization angle and the cross-polarization\nleakage. As the most intense polarized source in the microwave sky at angular\nscales of few arcminutes, the Crab nebula will be used for this purpose. Our\ngoal was to measure the Crab nebula polarization characteristics at 90 GHz with\nunprecedented precision. The observations were carried out with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope employing the correlation polarimeter XPOL and using two orthogonally\npolarized receivers. We processed the Stokes I, Q, and U maps from our\nobservations in order to compute the polarization angle and linear polarization\nfraction. The first is almost constant in the region of maximum emission in\npolarization with a mean value of alpha_Sky=152.1+/-0.3 deg in equatorial\ncoordinates, and the second is found to reach a maximum of Pi=30% for the most\npolarized pixels. We find that a CMB experiment having a 5 arcmin circular beam\nwill see a mean polarization angle of alpha_Sky=149.9+/-0.2 deg and a mean\npolarization fraction of Pi=8.8+/-0.2%.\n", "  We report the Suzaku observation of 1E 1740.7-2942, a black hole candidate\ncalled the \"Great Annihilator\" (GA). The high-quality spectrum of Suzaku\nprovides the severest constraints on the parameters of the GA. Two clumpy\nstructures are found around the GA in the line images of FeI Kalpha at 6.4 keV\nand SXV Kalpha at 2.45 keV. One clump named M359.23-0.04 exhibits the 6.4-keV\nline with an equivalent width of ~ 1.2 keV, and is associated with a molecular\ncloud in the radio CS(J=1-0) map. Thus the 6.4-keV line from M359.23-0.04 is\nlikely due to X-ray fluorescence irradiated by an external X-ray source. The\nirradiating X-rays would be either the past flare of Sagittarius A* or the\nbright nearby source, the GA. The other clump named G359.12-0.05 is associated\nwith the radio supernova remnant candidate G359.07-0.02. We therefore propose\nthat G359.12-0.05 is an X-ray counterpart of G359.07-0.02. G359.12-0.05 has a\nthin thermal plasma spectrum with a temperature of kT ~ 0.9 keV. The plasma\nparameters of G359.12-0.05 are consistent with those of a single supernova\nremnant in the Galactic center region.\n", "  First we present a theoretical framework to compute the fully differential\ncross sections for the top-quark productions and their subsequent decays at\nhadron colliders, incorporating the bound-state effects which are important in\nthe t\\bar{t} threshold region. We include the bound-state effects such that the\ncross sections are correct in the LO approximation both in the threshold and\nhigh-energy regions. Then, based on this framework we compute various\nkinematical distributions of top quarks as well as of their decay products at\nthe LHC, by means of Monte-Carlo event-generation. These are compared with the\ncorresponding predictions based on conventional perturbative QCD. In\nparticular, we find a characteristic bound-state effect on the\n(bW^+)-(\\bar{b}W^-) double-invariant-mass distribution, which is deformed to\nthe lower invariant-mass side in a correlated manner.\n", "  The ordinary-extraordinary (O-X) mode conversion is modeled with the aid of a\n2D full-wave code in the Pegasus Toroidal Experiment as a function of the\nlaunch angles. It is shown how the shape of the plasma density profile in front\nof the antenna can significantly influence the mode conversion efficiency and,\nthus, the generation of electron Bernstein waves (EBW). It is therefore\ndesirable to control the density profile in front of the antenna for successful\noperation of an EBW heating and current drive system. On the other hand, the\nconversion efficiency is shown to be resilient to vertical displacements of the\nplasma as large as \\pm 10 cm.\n", "  A quantum system (with Hilbert space $\\mathscr{H}_1$) entangled with its\nenvironment (with Hilbert space $\\mathscr{H}_2$) is usually not attributed a\nwave function but only a reduced density matrix $\\rho_1$. Nevertheless, there\nis a precise way of attributing to it a random wave function $\\psi_1$, called\nits conditional wave function, whose probability distribution $\\mu_1$ depends\non the entangled wave function $\\psi\\in\\mathscr{H}_1\\otimes\\mathscr{H}_2$ in\nthe Hilbert space of system and environment together. It also depends on a\nchoice of orthonormal basis of $\\mathscr{H}_2$ but in relevant cases, as we\nshow, not very much. We prove several universality (or typicality) results\nabout $\\mu_1$, e.g., that if the environment is sufficiently large then for\nevery orthonormal basis of $\\mathscr{H}_2$, most entangled states $\\psi$ with\ngiven reduced density matrix $\\rho_1$ are such that $\\mu_1$ is close to one of\nthe so-called GAP (Gaussian adjusted projected) measures, $GAP(\\rho_1)$. We\nalso show that, for most entangled states $\\psi$ from a microcanonical subspace\n(spanned by the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian with energies in a narrow\ninterval $[E,E+\\delta E]$) and most orthonormal bases of $\\mathscr{H}_2$,\n$\\mu_1$ is close to $GAP(\\mathrm{tr}_2 \\rho_{mc})$ with $\\rho_{mc}$ the\nnormalized projection to the microcanonical subspace. In particular, if the\ncoupling between the system and the environment is weak, then $\\mu_1$ is close\nto $GAP(\\rho_\\beta)$ with $\\rho_\\beta$ the canonical density matrix on\n$\\mathscr{H}_1$ at inverse temperature $\\beta=\\beta(E)$. This provides the\nmathematical justification of our claim in [J. Statist. Phys. 125:1193 (2006),\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309021] that $GAP$ measures describe the thermal\nequilibrium distribution of the wave function.\n", "  Mars was observed in X-rays during April 3-5 2008 for 82 ksec with the\nJapanese Suzaku observatory. Mars has been known to emit X-rays via the\nscattering of solar X-rays and via the charge exchange between neutral atoms in\nthe exosphere and solar wind ions. Past theoretical studies suggest that the\nexospheric neutral density may vary by a factor of up to 10 over the solar\ncycle. To investigate a potential change of the exospheric charge exchange\nemission, Mars was observed with Suzaku at solar minimum. Significant signals\nwere not detected at the position of Mars in the energy band of 0.2-5 keV. A 2\nsigma upper limit of the O VII line flux in 0.5-0.65 keV was 4.3$\\times10^{-5}$\nph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Comparing this upper limit to the past Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations conducted near solar maximum, it was found that the\nexospheric density at solar minimum does not exceed that near solar maximum by\nmore than 6-70 times.\n", "  In this paper results of scintillation properties measurements of pure and\nCe3+-doped strontium fluoride crystals are presented. We measure light output,\nscintillation decay time profile and temperature stability of light output.\nX-ray excited luminescence outputs corrected for spectral response of\nmonochromator and photomultiplier for pure SrF2 and SrF2-0.3 mol.% Ce3+ are\napproximately 95% and 115% of NaI-Tl emission output, respectively. A photopeak\nwith a 10% full width at half maximum is observed at approximately 84% the\nlight output of a NaI-Tl crystal after correction for spectral response of\nphotomultiplier, when sample 10x10 mm of pure SrF2 crystal is excited with 662\nKeV photons. Corrected light output of SrF2-0.3 mol.% Ce3+ under 662 KeV photon\nexcitation is found at approximately 64% the light output of the NaI-Tl\ncrystal.\n", "  We study the Friedel oscillations induced by a localized impurity in\nanisotropic graphene. We focus on the limit when the two inequivalent Dirac\npoints merge. We find that in this limit the Friedel oscillations manifest very\npeculiar features, such as a strong asymmetry and an atypical inverse\nsquare-root decay. Our calculations are performed using both a T-matrix\napproximation and a tight-binding exact diagonalization technique. They allow\nus to obtain numerically the local density of states as a function of energy\nand position, as well as an analytical form of the Friedel oscillations in the\ncontinuum limit. The two techniques yield results that are in excellent\nagreement, confirming the accuracy of such methods to approach this problem.\n", "  Among several possibilities for what reality could be like in view of the\nempirical facts of quantum mechanics, one is provided by theories of\nspontaneous wave function collapse, the best known of which is the\nGhirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory. We show mathematically that in GRW theory\n(and similar theories) there are limitations to knowledge, that is, inhabitants\nof a GRW universe cannot find out all the facts true about their universe. As a\nspecific example, they cannot accurately measure the number of collapses that a\ngiven physical system undergoes during a given time interval; in fact, they\ncannot reliably measure whether one or zero collapses occur. Put differently,\nin a GRW universe certain meaningful, factual questions are empirically\nundecidable. We discuss several types of limitations to knowledge and compare\nthem with those in other (no-collapse) versions of quantum mechanics, such as\nBohmian mechanics. Most of our results also apply to observer-induced collapses\nas in orthodox quantum mechanics (as opposed to the spontaneous collapses of\nGRW theory).\n", "  We critically evaluate the treatment of the notion of measurement in the\nConsistent Histories approach to quantum mechanics. We find such a treatment\nunsatisfactory because it relies, often implicitly, on elements external to\nthose provided by the formalism. In particular, we note that, in order for the\nformalism to be informative when dealing with measurement scenarios, one needs\nto assume that the appropriate choice of framework is such that apparatuses are\nalways in states of well defined pointer positions after measurements. The\nproblem is that there is nothing in the formalism to justify this assumption.\nWe conclude that the Consistent Histories approach, contrary to what is claimed\nby its proponents, fails to provide a truly satisfactory resolution for the\nmeasurement problem in quantum theory.\n", "  We estimate the covariance in counts of almost-primes in $\\mathbb{F}_q[T]$,\nweighted by higher-order von Mangoldt functions. The answer takes a pleasant\nalgebraic form. This generalizes recent work of Keating and Rudnick that\nestimates the variance of primes, and makes use, as theirs, of a recent\nequidistribution result of Katz.\n  In an appendix we prove some related identities for random matrix statistics,\nwhich allows us to give a quick proof of a $2\\times2$ ratio theorem for the\ncharacteristic polynomial of the unitary group. We additionally identify\narithmetic functions whose statistics mimic those of hook Schur functions.\n", "  Galaxy clustering on very large scales can be probed via the 2-point\ncorrelation function in the general case of wide and deep separations,\nincluding all the lightcone and relativistic effects. Using our recently\ndeveloped formalism, we analyze the behavior of the local and integrated\ncontributions and how these depend on redshift range, linear and angular\nseparations and luminosity function. Relativistic corrections to the local part\nof the correlation can be non-negligible but they remain generally\nsub-dominant. On the other hand, the additional correlations arising from\nlensing convergence and time-delay effects can become very important and even\ndominate the observed total correlation function. We investigate different\nconfigurations formed by the observer and the pair of galaxies, and we find\nthat the case of near-radial large-scale separations is where these effects\nwill be the most important.\n", "  We are concerned with the problem of detecting with high probability whether\na wave function has collapsed or not, in the following framework: A quantum\nsystem with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space is initially in state $\\psi$; with\nprobability $0<p<1$, the state collapses relative to the orthonormal basis\n$b_1,...,b_d$. That is, the final state $\\psi'$ is random; it is $\\psi$ with\nprobability $1-p$ and $b_k$ (up to a phase) with $p$ times Born's probability\n$|\\langle b_k|\\psi \\rangle|^2$. Now an experiment on the system in state\n$\\psi'$ is desired that provides information about whether or not a collapse\nhas occurred. Elsewhere, we identify and discuss the optimal experiment in case\nthat $\\psi$ is either known or random with a known probability distribution.\nHere we present results about the case that no a priori information about\n$\\psi$ is available, while we regard $p$ and $b_1,...,b_d$ as known. For\ncertain values of $p$, we show that the set of $\\psi$s for which any experiment\nE is more reliable than blind guessing is at most half the unit sphere; thus,\nin this regime, any experiment is of questionable use, if any at all.\nRemarkably, however, there are other values of $p$ and experiments E such that\nthe set of $\\psi$s for which E is more reliable than blind guessing has measure\ngreater than half the sphere, though with a conjectured maximum of 64% of the\nsphere.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a form of quantum nonlocality exhibiting\nan inherent asymmetry between the observers, Alice and Bob. We present a simple\nclass of entangled two-qubit states which are one-way steerable, considering\narbitrary projective measurements. That is, Alice can steer the state of Bob,\nbut it is impossible for Bob to steer Alice's state. This shows that the\nnonlocal properties of entangled states can be fundamentally asymmetrical.\n", "  Recently, several proposals have been made to test the quantum superposition\nprinciple in the mesoscopic regime. Most of these tests consist of a careful\nmeasurement of the loss of interference due to decoherence. Here we consider,\ninstead, the spread in position of a freely falling nanosphere. We study in\ndepth the dependence of this spread on self-gravity in the presence of\ndecoherence (exotic and non-exotic). We show that the influence of self-gravity\nis robust in the presence of weak decoherence, and quantify this robustness by\nintroducing a new parameter, the critical decoherence, aimed at estimating the\ncritical value above which self-gravity is overwhelmed by decoherence. We also\nemphasise the crucial role played by the spread of the initial wave packet for\nthe sensitivity of free-fall experiments to decoherence.\n", "  Using the symmetry properties of two-dmensional sigma models, we introduce a\nnotion of the Beltrami-Courant differential, so that there is a natural\nhomotopy Gerstenhaber algebra related to it. We conjecture that the generalized\nMaurer-Cartan equation for the corresponding $L_{\\infty}$ subalgebra gives\nsolutions to the Einstein equations.\n", "  Dark Matter (DM) is an elusive form of matter which has been postulated to\nexplain astronomical observations through its gravitational effects on stars\nand galaxies, gravitational lensing of light around these, and through its\nimprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This indirect evidence\nimplies that DM accounts for as much as 84.5% of all matter in our Universe,\nyet it has so far evaded all attempts at direct detection, leaving such\nconfirmation and the consequent discovery of its nature as one of the biggest\nchallenges in modern physics. Here we present a novel form of low-mass DM\n$\\chi$ that would have been missed by all experiments so far. While its large\ninteraction strength might at first seem unlikely, neither constraints from\nparticle physics nor cosmological/astronomical observations are sufficient to\nrule out this type of DM, and it motivates our proposal for direct detection by\noptomechanics technology which should soon be within reach, namely, through the\nprecise position measurement of a levitated mesoscopic particle which will be\nperturbed by elastic collisions with $\\chi$ particles. We show that a recently\nproposed nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer, originally conceived for\ntests of the quantum superposition principle, is sensitive to these collisions,\ntoo.\n", "  We give a new combinatorial interpretation of the stationary distribution of\nthe (partially) asymmetric exclusion process on a finite number of sites in\nterms of decorated alternative trees and colored permutations. The\ncorresponding expressions of the multivariate partition functions are then\nrelated to multivariate generalizations of Eulerian polynomials for colored\npermutations considered recently by N. Williams and the third author, and\nothers. We also discuss stability-- and negative dependence properties\nsatisfied by the partition functions.\n", "  The black hole information paradox arises from an apparent conflict between\nthe Hawking black hole radiation and the fact that time evolution in quantum\nmechanics is unitary. The trouble is that while the former suggests that\ninformation of a system falling into a black hole disappears, the latter\nimplies that information must be conserved. In this work we discuss the current\ndivergence in views regarding the paradox, we evaluate the role that objective\ncollapse theories could play in its resolution and we propose a link between\nspontaneous collapse events and microscopic virtual black holes.\n", "  The perihelion precession, the deflection of light, and the radar echo delay\nare classical tests of General Relativity here used to probe brane world\ntopologically charged black holes in a f(R) bulk and to constrain the parameter\nthat arises from the Shiromizu-Maeda-Sasaki procedure applied to a f(R) bulk as\nwell. The existing Solar system observational data constrain the possible\nvalues of the tidal charge parameter and the effective cosmological constant\nincluding f(R) brane world effects. We show that the observational/experimental\ndata for both perihelion precession and radar echo delay make the black hole\nspace of parameters to be more strict than the ones for the Dadhich, Maartens,\nPapadopoulos and Rezania (DMPR) black hole geometry. Furthermore, the\ndeflection of light constrains the tidal charge parameter similarly as the DMPR\nblack holes due to a peculiarity in the equation of motion.\n", "  Cyclic symmetry in the neutrino sector with the type-I seesaw mechanism in\nthe mass basis of charged leptons and right chiral neutrinos ($N_{iR}$,\n$i=e,\\mu,\\tau$) generates two fold degenerate light neutrino and three fold\ndegenerate heavy neutrino mass spectrum. Consequently, such scheme, produces\nvanishing one light neutrino mass squared difference and lepton asymmetry. To\ncircumvent such unphysical outcome, we break cyclic symmetry in the diagonal\nright chiral neutrino mass term by a small breaking parameter. Nonzero mass\nsquared differences and mixing angles are generated with the help of the small\nbreaking parameter. Smallness of the breaking parameter opens up a possibility\nof resonant leptogenesis. Assuming complex Yukawa couplings, we derive\ngeneralized expressions flavor dependent CP asymmetry parameters\n($\\varepsilon^\\alpha_i$) which are valid for quasi degenerate as well as\nhierarchical mass spectrum of right handed neutrinos. There after we set up the\nchain of coupled Boltzmann equations (which are flavor dependent too) which\nhave to be solved in order to get the final lepton asymmetries. Depending upon\nthe temperature regime the CP asymmetries and the Boltzmann equations may also\nbe flavor independent. As our goal is to study the enhancement of CP asymmetry\ndue to quasi degeneracy of right handed neutrinos, we select only the lowest\nallowed (by neutrino oscillation data) value of breaking parameter (and other\ncorresponding Lagrangian parameters) and estimate the baryon asymmetry\nparameter $Y_B$. Experimental constraint of $Y_B$ introduces a bound on right\nhanded neutrino mass which remained unrestricted by neutrino oscillation data.\n", "  The process matrix framework [O. Oreshkov, F. Costa, and C. Brukner, Nature\nCommunications {\\bf3}, 1092 (2012)] can describe general physical theory where\nlocally operations are described by completely-positive maps but globally no\nfixed causal structure is assumed. In this framework, two parties who perform\nmeasurements on each single-qubit system can violate a \"causal inequality\",\nwhich is not violated if the global fixed causal structure exists. Since the\nstandard quantum physics assumes a fixed global causal structure, the process\nmatrix framework can describe more general physical theory than the standard\nquantum physics. In this paper, we show that for a single-party system the\nprocess matrix framework is reduced to the standard quantum physics, and\ntherefore no exotic effect beyond the standard quantum physics can be observed.\nThis result is analogous to the well known fact in the Bell inequality\nviolation: a single-party system can be described by a local hidden variable\ntheory, whereas more than two parties can violate the Bell inequality.\n", "  We have measured the lifetime of spin imbalances in the quasiparticle\npopulation of a superconductor ($\\tau_s$) in the frequency domain. A\ntime-dependent spin imbalance is created by injecting spin-polarised electrons\nat finite excitation frequencies into a thin-film mesoscopic superconductor\n(Al) in an in-plane magnetic field (in the Pauli limit). The time-averaged\nvalue of the spin imbalance signal as a function of excitation frequency,\n$f_{RF}$ shows a cut-off at $f_{RF} \\approx 1/(2\\pi\\tau_s)$. The spin imbalance\nlifetime is relatively constant in the accessible ranges of temperatures, with\nperhaps a slight increase with increasing magnetic field. Taking into account\nsample thickness effects, $\\tau_s$ is consistent with previous measurements and\nof the order of the electron-electron scattering time $\\tau_{ee}$. Our data are\nqualitatively well-described by a theoretical model taking into account all\nquasiparticle tunnelling processes from a normal metal into a superconductor.\n", "  We study the structure of Fermionic networks, i.e., a model of networks based\non the behavior of fermionic gases, and we analyze dynamical processes over\nthem. In this model, particle dynamics have been mapped to the domain of\nnetworks, hence a parameter representing the temperature controls the evolution\nof the system. In doing so, it is possible to generate adaptive networks, i.e.,\nnetworks whose structure varies over time. As shown in previous works, networks\ngenerated by quantum statistics can undergo critical phenomena as phase\ntransitions and, moreover, they can be considered as thermodynamic systems. In\nthis study, we analyze Fermionic networks and opinion dynamics processes over\nthem, framing this network model as a computational model useful to represent\ncomplex and adaptive systems. Results highlight that a strong relation holds\nbetween the gas temperature and the structure of the achieved networks.\nNotably, both the degree distribution and the assortativity vary as the\ntemperature varies, hence we can state that fermionic networks behave as\nadaptive networks. On the other hand, it is worth to highlight that we did not\nfind relation between outcomes of opinion dynamics processes and the gas\ntemperature. Therefore, although the latter plays a fundamental role in gas\ndynamics, on the network domain its importance is related only to structural\nproperties of fermionic networks.\n", "  This paper studies the difficulty of discriminating between an arbitrary\nquantum channel and a \"replacer\" channel that discards its input and replaces\nit with a fixed state. We show that, in this particular setting, the most\ngeneral adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a\nquantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a\nconstant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to\nzero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy\nregistered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states\nthat any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than\nthe channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily\nconverges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal\nstrong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we\ncan establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted\ncapacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our\nchannel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as\nwas used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is a\nkey tool in our analysis. Finally, by combining our results with recent results\nof Hayashi and Tomamichel, we find a novel operational interpretation of the\nmutual information of a quantum channel N as the optimal type II error exponent\nwhen discriminating between a large number of independent instances of N and an\narbitrary \"worst-case\" replacer channel chosen from the set of all replacer\nchannels.\n", "  A theory of local temperature measurement of an interacting quantum electron\nsystem far from equilibrium via a floating thermoelectric probe is developed.\nIt is shown that the local temperature so defined is consistent with the\nzeroth, first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics, provided the\nprobe-system coupling is weak and broad band. For non-broad-band probes, the\nlocal temperature obeys the Clausius form of the second law and the third law\nexactly, but there are corrections to the zeroth and first laws that are\nhigher-order in the Sommerfeld expansion. The corrections to the zeroth and\nfirst laws are related, and can be interpreted in terms of the error of a\nnonideal temperature measurement. These results also hold for systems at\nnegative absolute temperature.\n", "  We analyze the problem of preparing quantum Gibbs states of lattice spin\nHamiltonians with local and commuting terms on a quantum computer and in\nnature. Our central result is an equivalence between the behavior of\ncorrelations in the Gibbs state and the mixing time of the semigroup which\ndrives the system to thermal equilibrium (the Gibbs sampler). We introduce a\nframework for analyzing the correlation and mixing characteristics of quantum\nGibbs states and quantum Gibbs samplers, which is rooted in the theory of\nnon-commutative Lp spaces. We consider two distinct classes of Gibbs samplers,\none of which being the well-studied Davies generators modelling the dynamics on\nthe system due to weak-coupling with a large Markovian environment. We show\nthat their gap is independent of system size if, and only if, a certain strong\nform of clustering of correlations holds in the Gibbs state. As concrete\napplications of our formalism, we show that for every one-dimensional lattice\nsystem, or for systems in lattices of any dimension at high enough\ntemperatures, the Gibbs samplers of commuting Hamiltonians are always gapped,\ngiving an efficient way of preparing these states on a quantum computer.\n", "  Separated spin-up and spin-down quantum kinetics is derived for more detailed\nresearch of the spin-electron acoustic waves. Kinetic theory allows to obtain\nspectrum of the spin-electron acoustic waves including effects of occupation of\nquantum states more accurately than quantum hydrodynamics. We apply quantum\nkinetic to calculate the Landau damping of the spin-electron acoustic waves. We\nhave considered contribution of ions dynamics in the spin-electron acoustic\nwave spectrum. We obtain contribution of ions in the Landau damping in\ntemperature regime of classic ions. Kinetic analysis for ion-acoustic, zero\nsound, and Langmuir waves at separated spin-up and spin-down electron dynamics\nis presented as well.\n", "  We perform a systematic search for anti-de Sitter vacua of maximal\nsupergravity with N>2 residual supersymmetries. We find that maximal\nsupergravity admits two 1-parameter classes of N=3 and N=4 vacua, respectively.\nThey are embedded, for the different values of an angular parameter, in the\n$\\omega$-rotated SO(8) (N=3) and SO(1,7) (N=4 and 3) gauged models. All vacua\ndisappear in the limit when $\\omega$ tends to zero. We determine the mass\nspectra and the AdS-supermultiplet structure. These appear to be the first and\nonly N>2 supersymmetric AdS vacua in maximal supergravity, aside from the N=8\nvacua of the SO(8)-gauged models. We also prove on general grounds that no such\nvacua can exist for 4<N<8.\n", "  We report the results of new differential force measurements between a test\nmass and rotating source masses of gold and silicon to search for forces beyond\nNewtonian gravity at short separations. The technique employed subtracts the\notherwise dominant Casimir force at the outset and, when combined with a\nlock-in amplification technique, leads to a significant improvement (up to a\nfactor $10^{3}$) over existing limits on the strength (relative to gravity) of\na putative force in the 40--8000 nm interaction range.\n", "  We define a procedure by which observers can measure a type of\nspecial-relativistic linear and angular momentum $(P^a, J^{ab})$ at a point in\na curved spacetime using only the spacetime geometry in a neighborhood of that\npoint. The method is chosen to yield the conventional results in stationary\nspacetimes near future null infinity.\n  We also explore the extent to which spatially separated observers can compare\nthe values of angular momentum that they measure and find consistent results.\nWe define a generalization of parallel transport along curves which gives a\nprescription for transporting values of angular momentum along curves that\nyields the correct result in special relativity. If observers use this\nprescription, then they will find that the angular momenta they measure are\nobserver dependent, because of the effects of spacetime curvature. The observer\ndependence can be quantified by a kind of generalized holonomy. We show that\nbursts of gravitational waves with memory generically give rise to a nontrivial\ngeneralized holonomy: there is, in this context, a close relation between the\nobserver dependence of angular momentum and the gravitational-wave memory\neffect.\n", "  We investigate two competing contact processes on a set of Watts--Strogatz\nnetworks with the clustering coefficient tuned by rewiring. The base for\nnetwork construction is one-dimensional chain of $N$ sites, where each site $i$\nis directly linked to nodes labelled as $i\\pm 1$ and $i\\pm 2$. So initially,\neach node has the same degree $k_i=4$. The periodic boundary conditions are\nassumed as well.\n  For each node $i$ the links to sites $i+1$ and $i+2$ are rewired to two\nrandomly selected nodes so far not-connected to node $i$. An increase of the\nrewiring probability $q$ influences the nodes degree distribution and the\nnetwork clusterization coefficient $\\mathcal{C}$. For given values of rewiring\nprobability $q$ the set $\\mathcal{N}(q)=\\{\\mathcal{N}_1, \\mathcal{N}_2, \\cdots,\n\\mathcal{N}_M \\}$ of $M$ networks is generated.\n  The network's nodes are decorated with spin-like variables $s_i\\in\\{S,D\\}$.\nDuring simulation each $S$ node having a $D$-site in its neighbourhood converts\nthis neighbour from $D$ to $S$ state. Conversely, a node in $D$ state having at\nleast one neighbour also in state $D$-state converts all nearest-neighbours of\nthis pair into $D$-state. The latter is realized with probability $p$.\n  We plot the dependence of the nodes $S$ final density $n_S^T$ on initial\nnodes $S$ fraction $n_S^0$. Then, we construct the surface of the unstable\nfixed points in $(\\mathcal{C}, p, n_S^0)$ space. The system evolves more often\ntoward $n_S^T=1$ for $(\\mathcal{C}, p, n_S^0)$ points situated above this\nsurface while starting simulation with $(\\mathcal{C}, p, n_S^0)$ parameters\nsituated below this surface leads system to $n_S^T=0$. The points on this\nsurface correspond to such value of initial fraction $n_S^*$ of $S$ nodes (for\nfixed values $\\mathcal{C}$ and $p$) for which their final density is\n$n_S^T=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n", "  Although a universal quantum computer is still far from reach, the tremendous\nadvances in controllable quantum devices, in particular with solid-state\nsystems, make it possible to physically implement \"quantum simulators\". Quantum\nsimulators are physical setups able to simulate other quantum systems\nefficiently that are intractable on classical computers. Based on solid-state\nqubit systems with various types of nearest-neighbor interactions, we propose a\ncomplete set of algorithms for simulating pairing Hamiltonians. Fidelity of the\ntarget states corresponding to each algorithm is numerically studied. We also\ncompare algorithms designed for different types of experimentally available\nHamiltonians and analyze their complexity. Furthermore, we design a measurement\nscheme to extract energy spectra from the simulators. Our simulation algorithms\nmight be feasible with state-of-the-art technology in solid-state quantum\ndevices.\n", "  We investigate the regime of fully developed homogeneous and isotropic\nturbulence of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation in the presence of a stochastic\nforcing, using the nonperturbative (functional) renormalization group (NPRG).\nWithin a simple approximation based on symmetries, we obtain the fixed point\nsolution of the NPRG flow equations that corresponds to fully developed\nturbulence both in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions. Deviations to the dimensional\nscalings (Kolmogorov in $d=3$ or Kraichnan-Batchelor in $d=2$) are found for\nthe two-point functions. To further analyze these deviations, we derive exact\nflow equations in the large wave-number limit, and show that the fixed point\ndoes not entail the usual scale invariance, thereby identifying the mechanism\nfor the emergence of intermittency within the NPRG framework. The purpose of\nthis work is to provide a detailed basis for NPRG studies of NS turbulence, the\ndetermination of the ensuing intermittency exponents is left for future work.\n", "  Possibilities to test the Lorentz invariance of the weak interaction in muon\ndecay are considered. We derive the direction-dependent muon-decay rate with a\ngeneral Lorentz-violating addition to the W-boson propagator. We discuss\nmeasurements of the directional and boost dependence of the Michel parameters\nand of the muon lifetime as a function of absolute velocity. The total\nmuon-decay rate in the Lorentz-violating Standard Model Extension is addressed.\nSuggestions are made for dedicated (re)analyses of the pertinent data and for\nfuture experiments.\n", "  This paper deals with maximization of classical $f$-divergence between the\ndistributions of a measurement outputs of a given pair of quantum states.\n$f$-divergence $D_{f}$ between the probability density functions $p_{1}$ and\n$p_{2}$ over a discrete set is defined as $D_{f}( p_{1}||p_{2})\n:=\\sum_{x}p_{2}(x) f\\left(p_{1}(x)/p_{2}( x) \\right) $. For example,\nKullback-Leibler divergence and Renyi type relative entropy are well-known\nexamples with good operational meanings. Thus, finding the maximal value\n$D_{f}^{\\min}$ of measured measured $f$-divergence is also an interesting\nquestion. But so far the question is solved only for very restricted example of\n$f$. \\ The purposes of the present paper is to advance the study further, by\ninvestigating its properties, rewriting the maximization problem to more\ntractable form, and giving closed formulas of the quantity in some special\ncases.\n", "  We report on ultrastrong coupling between a superconducting flux qubit and a\nresonant mode of a system comprised of two superconducting coplanar stripline\nresonators coupled galvanically to the qubit. With a coupling strength as high\nas 17% of the mode frequency, exceeding that of previous circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics experiments, we observe a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift. The\nspectroscopic response of our multimode system reveals a clear breakdown of the\nJaynes-Cummings model. In contrast to earlier experiments, the high coupling\nstrength is achieved without making use of an additional inductance provided by\na Josephson junction.\n", "  We describe a successful effort to produce a laser comb around 1.55 $\\mu$m in\nthe astronomical H band using a method based on a line-referenced,\nelectro-optical-modulation frequency comb. We discuss the experimental setup,\nlaboratory results, and proof of concept demonstrations at the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility (IRTF) and the Keck-II telescope. The laser comb has a\ndemonstrated stability of $<$ 200 kHz, corresponding to a Doppler precision of\n~0.3 m/s. This technology, when coupled with a high spectral resolution\nspectrograph, offers the promise of $<$1 m/s radial velocity precision suitable\nfor the detection of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of cool M-type\nstars.\n", "  While it is widely agreed that Bell's theorem is an important result in the\nfoundations of quantum physics, there is much disagreement about what exactly\nBell's theorem shows. It is agreed that Bell derived a contradiction with\nexperimental facts from some list of assumptions, thus showing that at least\none of the assumptions must be wrong; but there is disagreement about what the\nassumptions were that went into the argument. In this paper, I make a few\npoints in order to help clarify the situation.\n", "  We present the observation of a transverse thermopower, or Planar Nernst\nEffect, in patterned ultrathin film (8 nm) of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) driven by\nheat current applied in-plane of the film and Planar Hall Effect (PHE) in the\nsame LSMO ultrathin film with in-plane current of 100 microA is also\ninvestigated. Even for temperature difference of 5 K the Planar Nernst Effect\nin ultrathin film (8 nm) shows a coercivity of 3 Oe same as observed in Planar\nHall Effect measurement and confirms the ferromagnetic nature of thin film. The\nangular dependence of transverse voltages shows four-fold sin{theta} cos{theta}\ndependence symmetry at 250 K, which is consistent with Planar Hall Effect\nmeasurement.\n", "  We study transmission stability and dynamics of pulse amplitudes in\n$N$-channel soliton-based optical waveguide systems, taking into account\nsecond-order dispersion, Kerr nonlinearity, delayed Raman response, and\nfrequency dependent linear gain-loss. We carry out numerical simulations with\nsystems of $N$ coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equations and compare the\nresults with the predictions of a simplified predator-prey model for\nRaman-induced amplitude dynamics. Coupled-NLS simulations for single-fiber\ntransmission with $2 \\le N \\le 4$ frequency channels show stable oscillatory\ndynamics of soliton amplitudes at short-to-intermediate distances, in excellent\nagreement with the predator-prey model's predictions. However, at larger\ndistances, we observe transmission destabilization due to resonant formation of\nradiative sidebands, which is caused by Kerr nonlinearity. The presence of\nlinear gain-loss in a single fiber leads to a limited increase in transmission\nstability. Significantly stronger enhancement of transmission stability is\nachieved in a nonlinear $N$-waveguide coupler due to efficient suppression of\nradiative sideband generation by the linear gain-loss. As a result, the\ndistances along which stable Raman-induced dynamics of soliton amplitudes is\nobserved are significantly larger in the waveguide coupler system compared with\nthe single-fiber system.\n", "  Escaping from a complex maze, by exploring different paths with several\ndecision-making branches in order to reach the exit, has always been a very\nchallenging and fascinating task. Wave field and quantum objects may explore a\ncomplex structure in parallel by interference effects, but without necessarily\nleading to more efficient transport. Here, inspired by recent observations in\nbiological energy transport phenomena, we demonstrate how a quantum walker can\nefficiently reach the output of a maze by partially suppressing the presence of\ninterference. In particular, we show theoretically an unprecedented improvement\nin transport efficiency for increasing maze size with respect to purely quantum\nand classical approaches. In addition, we investigate experimentally these\nhybrid transport phenomena, by mapping the maze problem in an integrated\nwaveguide array, probed by coherent light, hence successfully testing our\ntheoretical results. These achievements may lead towards future bio-inspired\nphotonics technologies for more efficient transport and computation.\n", "  Since the discovery of the fullerene C60, many very interesting structures\nhave been proposed, such as Ti8C12, Au20, Au32, Au42, TM@Sin, Eu@Si20, B80, and\nB_{40}^{-/0}. Here, an exceptionally stable hollow cage containing 20 scandiums\nand 60 carbons was identified. This Sc20C60 molecular cluster has a Th point\ngroup symmetry and a volleyball-like shape, that we refer to below as\nVolleyballene. Electronic structure analysis shows that the formation of\ndelocalized {\\pi} bonds between Sc atoms and neighboring five-membered carbon\nrings is crucial for stabilizing the cage structure. A relatively large\nHOMO-LUMO gap was found. The results of vibrational frequency analysis and\nmolecular dynamics simulations also demonstrate that this Volleyballene\nmolecule is exceptionally stable.\n", "  We investigate theoretically skyrmion magnonic crystal, i.e., the dynamics of\nthe magnetization in a chain of the ferromagnetic nanodots being in skyrmion\nmagnetic configuration. We show that collective excitations are possible to be\nobserved in the structure. We present the dispersion relation of the coupled\nskyrmions. It exhibit a periodical property in dependence on wave vector,\ncharacteristic feature of the band structure in magnonic crystals. Spatial\nanalysis of the magnetization amplitude associated with the magnonic bands\nconfirms type of the excited modes, as breathing and clockwise gyrotropic\ndynamical skyrmions. These high and low frequency excitations, propagate with\nnegative and positive group velocity, respectively, and can be explored for\nstudy fundamental properties and technological applications in spintronics and\nmagnonics.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are defects in diamonds, which, due to their\nelectronic structure, have been extensively studied as magnetic field sensors.\nSuch field detection applications usually employ the NV centers to detect field\ncomponents aligned with the direction of the internally-defined spin axis of\nthe NV center. In this work we detect magnetic fields which are slightly\nmisaligned with the NV center axis. In particular, we demonstrate that the NV\ncenter can measure the square of the angle between the magnetic field and the\nNV center axis with high sensitivity which diverges as the external field\napproaches a value pre-defined by NV center's internal parameters, in agreement\nwith predictions. These results show that NV centers could be used as sensitive\ntransducers for making quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements on systems such\nas nanomechanical oscillators.\n", "  In this work, we propose a method for calculating the free energy of\nanisotropic classical spin systems. We use a Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation to express the partition function of a generic bilinear\nsuper-exchange Hamiltonian in terms of a functional integral over classical\ntime-independent fields. As an example, we consider an anisotropic\nspin-exchange Hamiltonian on the cubic lattice as is found for compounds with\nstrongly correlated electrons in multiorbital bands and subject to strong\nspin-orbit interaction. We calculate the contribution of Gaussian spin\nfluctuations to the free energy. While the mean-field solution of ordered\nstates for such systems usually has full rotational symmetry, we show here that\nthe fluctuations lead to a pinning of the spontaneous magnetization along some\npreferred direction of the lattice.\n", "  Scalar-tensor (ST) gravity is considered in the case where the scalar is an\nexternal field. We show that General Relativity (GR) and usual ST gravity are\nparticular cases of the External Scalar-Tensor (EST) gravity. It is shown with\na particular cosmological example that it is possible to join a part of a GR\nsolution to a part of a ST one such that the complete solution neither belongs\nto GR nor to ST, but fully satisfies the EST field equations. We argue that\nexternal fields may effectively work as a type of screening mechanism for ST\ntheories.\n", "  The exact partition function in ABJM theory on three-sphere can be regarded\nas a canonical partition function of a non-interacting Fermi-gas with an\nunconventional Hamiltonian. All the information on the partition function is\nencoded in the discrete spectrum of this Hamiltonian. We explain how (quantum\nmechanical) non-perturbative corrections in the Fermi-gas system appear from a\nspectral consideration. Basic tools in our analysis are a Mellin-Barnes type\nintegral representation and a spectral zeta function. From a consistency with\nknown results, we conjecture that the spectral zeta function in the ABJM\nFermi-gas has an infinite number of \"non-perturbative\" poles, which are\ninvisible in the semi-classical expansion of the Planck constant. We observe\nthat these poles indeed appear after summing up perturbative corrections. As a\nconsequence, the perturbative resummation of the spectral zeta function causes\nnon-perturbative corrections to the grand canonical partition function. We also\npresent another example associated with a spectral problem in topological\nstring theory. A conjectured non-perturbative free energy on the resolved\nconifold is successfully reproduced in this framework.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are localized, topologically protected spin-structures\nthat have been proposed for storing or processing information due to their\nintriguing dynamical and transport properties. Important in terms of\napplications is the recent discovery of interface stabilized skyrmions as\nevidenced in ultra-thin transition-metal films. However, so far only skyrmions\nat interfaces with a single atomic layer of a magnetic material were reported,\nwhich greatly limits their potential for application in devices. Here, we\npredict the emergence of skyrmions in [4d/Fe_2/5d]_n multilayers, i.e.\nstructures composed of Fe biatomic layers sandwiched between 4d- and\n5d-transition-metal layers. In these composite structures, the exchange and the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions which control skyrmion formation can be\ntuned separately by the two interfaces. This allows engineering skyrmions as\nshown based on density functional theory and spin dynamics simulations.\n", "  Short-range interaction can give rise to particle pairing with a short-range\ncorrelation, which may be destroyed in the presence of an external field. We\nstudy the transition between correlated and uncorrelated particle states in the\nframework of one-dimensional Hubbard model driven by a field. We show that the\nlong time-scale transfer rate from an initial correlated state to final\nuncorrelated particle states is sensitive to the quench field strength and\nexhibits a periodic behavior. This process involves an irreversible energy\ntransfer from the field to particles, leading to a quantum electrothermal\neffect.\n", "  Recently, Auffinger, Ben Arous, and \\v{C}ern\\'y initiated the study of\ncritical points of the Hamiltonian in the spherical pure $p$-spin spin glass\nmodel, and established connections between those and several notions from the\nphysics literature. Denoting the number of critical values less than $Nu$ by\n$\\mbox{Crt}_{N}(u)$, they computed the asymptotics of\n$\\frac{1}{N}\\log(\\mathbb{E}\\mbox{Crt}_{N}(u))$, as $N$, the dimension of the\nsphere, goes to $\\infty$. We compute the asymptotics of the corresponding\nsecond moment and show that, for $p\\geq3$ and sufficiently negative $u$, it\nmatches the first moment: \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\n\\left(\\mbox{Crt}_{N}\\left(u\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right\\}\n/\\left(\\vphantom{\\left(\\mbox{Crt}_{N}\\left(u\\right)\\right)^{2}}\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\n\\mbox{Crt}_{N}\\left(u\\right)\\right\\} \\right)^{2}\\to1. \\] As an immediate\nconsequence we obtain that $\\mbox{Crt}_{N}(u)/\\mathbb{E}\\{ \\mbox{Crt}_{N}(u)\\}\n\\to 1$, in $L^2$ and thus in probability. For any $u$ for which\n$\\mathbb{E}\\mbox{Crt}_{N}(u)$ does not tend to $0$ we prove that the moments\nmatch on an exponential scale.\n", "  In response to a recent rebuttal of [1] presented in [2], we defend the claim\nthat the Consistent Histories formulation of quantum mechanics does not solve\nthe measurement problem. In order to do so, we argue that satisfactory\nsolutions to the problem must not only not contain anthropomorphic terms (such\nas measurement or observer) at the fundamental level, but also that\napplications of the formalism to concrete situations (e.g., measurements)\nshould not require any input not contained in the description of the situation\nat hand at the fundamental level. Our assertion is that the Consistent\nHistories formalism does not meet the second criterion. We also argue that the\nso-called second measurement problem, i.e., the inability to explain how an\nexperimental result is related to a property possessed by the measured system\nbefore the measurement took place, is only a pseudo-problem. As a result, we\nreject the claim, defended in [2], that the capacity of the Consistent\nHistories formalism to solve it should count as an advantage over other\ninterpretations.\n", "  A reflexive relation on a set can be a starting point in defining the causal\nstructure of a spacetime in General Relativity and other relativistic theories\nof gravity. If we identify this relation as the relation between lightlike\nseparated events (the horismos relation), we can construct in a natural way the\nentire causal structure: causal and chronological relations, causal curves, and\na topology. By imposing a simple additional condition, the structure gains a\ndefinite number of dimensions. This construction works both with continuous and\ndiscrete spacetimes. The dimensionality is obtained also in the discrete case,\nso this approach can be suited to prove the fundamental conjecture of causal\nsets. Other simple conditions lead to a differentiable manifold with a\nconformal structure (the metric up to a scaling factor) as in Lorentzian\nmanifolds. This structure provides a simple and general reconstruction of the\nspacetime in relativistic theories of gravity, which normally requires\ntopological structure, differential structure, geometric structure (which\ndecomposes in the conformal structure, giving the causal relations, and the\nvolume element). Motivations for such a reconstruction come from relativistic\ntheories of gravity, where the conformal structure is important, from the\nproblem of singularities, and from Quantum Gravity, where various\ndiscretization methods are pursued, particularly in the causal sets approach.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new way to inquire the quantum\ncosmology for a certain gravitational theory. Normally, the quantum\ncosmological model is introduced as the minisuperspace theory which is obtained\nby reducing the superspace where the Wheel-DeWitt equation is defined on using\nthe symmetry provided by cosmological principle. Unlike that, the key of our\napproach is to reinterpret the cosmology in a classical dynamical way using a\npoint-like Lagrangian and then quantize the point-like model. We apply the\nmethod into Einstein gravity, gravity with a cosmological constant and the\n$f(R)$-gravity, and get their wave equations respectively. By analsysing the\nexact solution for the quantum cosmology with and without a cosmological\nconstant we demonstrate that the cosmological constant is essential and being a\ntiny positive number. We also show the possibility of explaining inflation\nunder the quantum version of cosmology.\n", "  We report our investigation of the electronic and magnetic excitations of\nSr$_3$NiIrO$_6$ by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Ir L$_3$ edge.\nThe intra-$t_{2g}$ electronic transitions are analyzed using an atomic model,\nincluding spin-orbit coupling and trigonal distortion of the IrO$_6$\noctahedron, confronted to {\\it ab initio} quantum chemistry calculations. The\nIr spin-orbital entanglement is quantified and its implication on the magnetic\nproperties, in particular in inducing highly anisotropic magnetic interactions,\nis highlighted. These are included in the spin-wave model proposed to account\nfor the dispersionless magnetic excitation that we observe at 90 meV. By\ncounterbalancing the strong Ni$^{2+}$ easy-plane anisotropy that manifests\nitself at high temperature, the anisotropy of the interactions finally leads to\nthe remarkable easy-axis magnetism reported in this material at low\ntemperature.\n", "  Quantum metrology overcomes standard precision limits by exploiting\ncollective quantum superpositions of physical systems used for sensing, with\nthe prominent example of non-classical multiphoton states improving\ninterferometric techniques. Practical quantum-enhanced interferometry is,\nhowever, vulnerable to imperfections such as partial distinguishability of\ninterfering photons. Here we introduce a method where appropriate design of the\nmodal structure of input photons can alleviate deleterious effects caused by\nanother, experimentally inaccessible degree of freedom. This result is\naccompanied by a laboratory demonstration that a suitable choice of spatial\nmodes combined with position-resolved coincidence detection restores\nentanglement-enhanced precision in the full operating range of a realistic\ntwo-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, specifically around a point which\notherwise does not even attain the shot-noise limit due to the presence of\nresidual distinguishing information in the spectral degree of freedom. Our\nmethod highlights the potential of engineering multimode physical systems in\nmetrologic applications.\n", "  We report pressure broadening coefficients for the 21 electric-dipole\ntransitions between the eight lowest rotational levels of ortho-H$_2$O and\npara-H$_2$O molecules by collisions with He at temperatures from 20 to 120 K.\nThese coefficients are derived from recently published experimental\nstate-to-state rate coefficients for H$_2$O:He inelastic collisions, plus an\nelastic contribution from close coupling calculations. The resulting\ncoefficients are compared to the available experimental data. Mostly due to the\nelastic contribution, the pressure broadening coefficients differ much from\nline to line, and increase markedly at low temperature. The present results are\nmeant as a guide for future experiments and astrophysical observations.\n", "  We use recent X-ray observations of the intracluster medium (ICM) of the\ngalaxy group NGC 5813 to confront theoretical studies of ICM thermal evolution\nwith the newly derived ICM properties. We argue that the ICM of the cooling\nflow galaxy group NGC 5813 is more likely to be heated by mixing of post-shock\njets' gas residing in hot bubbles with the ICM, than by shocks or\nturbulent-heating. Shocks thermalize only a small fraction of their energy in\nthe inner regions of the cooling flow; in order to adequately heat the inner\npart of the ICM, they would overheat the outer regions by a large factor,\nleading to its ejection from the group. Heating by mixing, that was found to be\nmuch more efficient than turbulent-heating and shocks-heating, hence, rescues\nthe outer ICM of NGC 5813 from its predestined fate according to cooling flow\nfeedback scenarios that are based on heating by shocks.\n", "  We introduce a new set of $q$-difference operators acting as raising\noperators on a family of symmetric polynomials which are characters of graded\ntensor products of current algebra ${\\mathfrak g}[u]$ KR-modules \\cite{FL} for\n${\\mathfrak g}=A_r$. These operators are generalizations of the Kirillov-Noumi\n\\cite{kinoum} Macdonald raising operators, in the dual $q$-Whittaker limit\n$t\\to\\infty$. They form a representation of the quantum $Q$-system of type $A$\n\\cite{qKR}. This system is a subalgebra of a quantum cluster algebra, and is\nalso a discrete integrable system whose conserved quantities, analogous to the\nCasimirs of $U_q({\\mathfrak sl}_{r+1})$, act as difference operators on the\nabove family of symmetric polynomials. The characters in the special case of\nproducts of fundamental modules are class I $q$-Whittaker functions, or\ncharacters of level-1 Demazure modules or Weyl modules. The action of the\nconserved quantities on these characters gives the difference quantum Toda\nequations \\cite{Etingof}. We obtain a generalization of the latter for\narbitrary tensor products of KR-modules.\n", "  Chemical tagging of stellar debris from disrupted open clusters and\nassociations underpins the science cases for next-generation multi-object\nspectroscopic surveys. As part of the Galactic Archaeology project TraCD\n(Tracking Cluster Debris), a preliminary attempt at reconstructing the birth\nclouds of now phase-mixed thin disk debris is undertaken using a parametric\nminimum spanning tree (MST) approach. Empirically-motivated chemical abundance\npattern uncertainties (for a 10-dimensional chemistry-space) are applied to\nNBODY6-realised stellar associations dissolved into a background sea of field\nstars, all evolving in a Milky Way potential. We demonstrate that significant\npopulation reconstruction degeneracies appear when the abundance uncertainties\napproach 0.1 dex and the parameterised MST approach is employed; more\nsophisticated methodologies will be required to ameliorate these degeneracies.\n", "  We present a proof-of-concept of a novel and fully Bayesian methodology\ndesigned to detect halos of different masses in cosmological observations\nsubject to noise and systematic uncertainties. Our methodology combines the\npreviously published Bayesian large-scale structure inference algorithm, HADES,\nand a Bayesian chain rule (the Blackwell-Rao Estimator), which we use to\nconnect the inferred density field to the properties of dark matter halos. To\ndemonstrate the capability of our approach we construct a realistic galaxy mock\ncatalogue emulating the wide-area 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, which has a\nmedian redshift of approximately 0.05. Application of HADES to the catalogue\nprovides us with accurately inferred three-dimensional density fields and\ncorresponding quantification of uncertainties inherent to any cosmological\nobservation. We then use a cosmological simulation to relate the amplitude of\nthe density field to the probability of detecting a halo with mass above a\nspecified threshold. With this information we can sum over the HADES density\nfield realisations to construct maps of detection probabilities and demonstrate\nthe validity of this approach within our mock scenario. We find that the\nprobability of successful of detection of halos in the mock catalogue increases\nas a function of the signal-to-noise of the local galaxy observations. Our\nproposed methodology can easily be extended to account for more complex\nscientific questions and is a promising novel tool to analyse the cosmic\nlarge-scale structure in observations.\n", "  Although the general theory macroscopic quantum entanglement of is still in\nits infancy, consideration of the matter in the framework of action-at-a\ndistance electrodynamics predicts for the random dissipative processes\nobservability of the advanced nonlocal correlations. These correlations were\nreally revealed in our previous experiments with some large-scale\nheliogeophysical processes as the source ones and the lab detectors as the\nprobe ones. Recently a new experiment has been performing on the base of Baikal\nDeep Water Neutrino Observatory. The thick water layer is an excellent shield\nagainst any local impacts on the detectors. The first annual series 2012/2013\nhas demonstrated that detector signals respond to the heliogeophysical\nprocesses and causal connection of the signals directed downwards: from the\nEarth surface to the Baikal floor. But this nonlocal connection proved to be in\nreverse time. In addition advanced nonlocal correlation of the detector signal\nwith the regional source-process: the random component of hydrological activity\nin the upper layer was revealed and the possibility of its forecast on nonlocal\ncorrelations was demonstrated. But the strongest macroscopic nonlocal\ncorrelations are observed at extremely low frequencies, that is at periods of\nseveral months. Therefore the above results should be verified in a longer\nexperiment. We verify them by data of the second annual series 2013/2014 of the\nBaikal experiment. All the results have been confirmed, although some\nquantitative parameters of correlations and time reversal causal links turned\nout different due to nonstationarity of the source-processes. A new result is\ndisplaying of the advanced response of nonlocal correlation detector to the\nearthquake. This opens up the prospect of the earthquake forecast on the new\nphysical principle, although further confirmation in the next events is\ncertainly needed.\n", "  Real life quantum computers are inevitably affected by intrinsic noise\nresulting in dissipative non-unitary dynamics realized by these devices. We\nconsider an open system quantum annealing algorithm optimized for a realistic\nanalog quantum device which takes advantage of noise-induced thermalization and\nrelies on incoherent quantum tunneling at finite temperature. We analyze the\nperformance of this algorithm considering a p-spin model which allows for a\nmean field quasicalssical solution and at the same time demonstrates the 1st\norder phase transition and exponential degeneracy of states. We demonstrate\nthat finite temperature effects introduced by the noise are particularly\nimportant for the dynamics in presence of the exponential degeneracy of\nmetastable states. We determine the optimal regime of the open system quantum\nannealing algorithm for this model and find that it can outperform simulated\nannealing in a range of parameters.\n", "  We consider a generalization of the Borel resummation, which turns out to be\nequivalent to the standard Borel resummation. We apply it to the simplest large\nN duality between the pure Chern-Simons theory and the topological string on\nthe resolved conifold, and find a simple integral formula for the free energy.\nExpanding this integral representation around the large radius point at finite\nstring coupling gs, we find that it includes not only the M-theoretic\nresummation a la Gopakumar and Vafa, but also a non-perturbative correction in\ngs. Remarkably, the obtained non-perturbative correction is in perfect\nagreement with a proposal for membrane instanton corrections in\narXiv:1306.1734. Various other examples are also presented.\n", "  Several recent experiments have reported an anomalous temperature dependence\nof the Coulomb drag effect in electron-hole bilayers. Motivated by these\npuzzling data, we study theoretically a low-density electron-hole bilayer,\nwhere electrons and holes avoid quantum degeneracy by forming excitonic\nmolecules. We describe the ionization-recombination crossover between the\nelectron-hole plasma and exciton gas and calculate both the intralayer and drag\nresistivity as a function of temperature. The latter exhibits a minimum\nfollowed by a sharp upturn at low temperatures in a qualitative agreement with\nthe experimental observations [see, e.g., J. A. Seamons et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 102, 026804 (2009)]. Importantly, the drag resistivity in the proposed\nscenario is found to be rather insensitive to a mismatch in electron and hole\nconcentrations in sharp contrast to the scenario of electron-hole Cooper\npairing.\n", "  We describe here a novel way of defining Hamiltonians for quantum field\ntheories (QFTs), based on the particle-position representation of the state\nvector and involving a condition on the state vector that we call an\n\"interior-boundary condition.\" At least for some QFTs (and, we hope, for many),\nthis approach leads to a well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonian without the\nneed for an ultraviolet cut-off or renormalization.\n", "  This novel piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film microcantilever was\nfabricated by micromachining technique. To release the cantilever, wet\nanisotropic etching of Silicon (Si) was performed by tetramethyl ammonium\nhydroxide (TMAH). The transverse piezoelectric coefficient d31 of the ZnO film,\nobtained from the deflection of the cantilever with influence of applied\nvoltage, was calculated as 3.32 pC/N. The observed dynamic characterization of\nthe novel piezoelectric microcantilever had linear response with the applied\ndriving voltage. The obtained values of Young Modulus and Hardness were 208 +4\nGPa and 4.84+ 0.1 GPa respectively. This inexpensive novel method provides\nadditional design flexibility to fabricate vibrational energy harvesters. The\neasy steps of fabrication and cost effectiveness of this method may be\npreferred it over DRIE. The voltage induced due to deformation of ZnO\ncantilever were measured ~230mV. This microcantilever energy scavenger may be\nused to power the nano devices and sensors for medical and agricultural\napplications as a replacement of traditional bulky batteries.\n", "  What intrinsic properties shape the light curves of Type II supernovae (SNe)?\nTo address this question we derive observational measures that are robust\n(i.e., insensitive to detailed radiative transfer) and constrain the\ncontribution from $^{56}$Ni, as well as a combination of the envelope mass,\nprogenitor radius, and explosion energy. By applying our methods to a sample of\ntype II SNe from the literature we find that $^{56}$Ni contribution is often\nsignificant. In our sample its contribution to the time weighted integrated\nluminosity during the photospheric phase ranges between 8% and 72% with a\ntypical value of 30%. We find that the $^{56}$Ni relative contribution is\nanti-correlated with the luminosity decline rate. When added to other clues,\nthis in turn suggests that the flat plateaus often observed in type II SNe are\nnot a generic feature of the cooling envelope emission, and that without\n$^{56}$Ni many of the SNe that are classified as II-P would have shown a\ndecline rate that is steeper by up to 1 mag/100 d. Nevertheless, we find that\nthe cooling envelope emission, and not $^{56}$Ni contribution, is the main\ndriver behind the observed range of decline rates. Furthermore, contrary to\nprevious suggestions, our findings indicate that fast decline rates are not\ndriven by lower envelope masses. We therefore suggest that the difference in\nobserved decline rates is mainly a result of different density profiles of the\nprogenitors.\n", "  Nonlinearity in macroscopic mechanical system plays a crucial role in a wide\nvariety of applications, including signal transduction and processing,\nsynchronization, and building logical devices. However, it is difficult to\ngenerate nonlinearity due to the fact that macroscopic mechanical systems\nfollow the Hooke's law and response linearly to external force, unless strong\ndrive is used. Here we propose and experimentally realize a record-high\nnonlinear response in macroscopic mechanical system by exploring the\nanharmonicity in deforming a single chemical bond. We then demonstrate the\ntunability of nonlinear response by precisely controlling the chemical bonding\ninteraction, and realize a cubic elastic constant of \\mathversion{bold}$2\n\\times 10^{18}~{\\rm N}/{\\rm m^3}$, many orders of magnitude larger in strength\nthan reported previously. This enables us to observe vibrational bistate\ntransitions of the resonator driven by the weak Brownian thermal noise at 6~K.\nThis method can be flexibly applied to a variety of mechanical systems to\nimprove nonlinear responses, and can be used, with further improvements, to\nexplore macroscopic quantum mechanics.\n", "  Microcanonical analysis is a powerful method for studying phase transitions\nof finite-size systems. This method has been used so far only for studying\nphase transitions of equilibrium systems, which can be described by\nmicrocanonical entropy. I show that it is possible to perform microcanonical\nanalysis of a nonequilibrium phase transition, by generalizing the concept of\nmicrocanonical entropy. One-dimensional asymmetric diffusion process is studied\nas an example where such a generalized entropy can be explicitly found, and the\nmicrocanonical method is used to analyze a nonequilibrium phase transition of a\nfinite-size system.\n", "  Momentum space anisotropy present in the quark and gluon distribution\nfunctions in relativistic heavy ion collisions induces Chromo-Weibel\ninstability in the hot QCD medium created therein. The impact of the\nChromo-Weibel instability on the dynamics of a heavy-quark (HQ) traversing in\nthe QGP medium is investigated within the framework of kinetic theory by\nstudying the momentum and temperature behavior of HQ drag and diffusion\ncoefficients. The physics of anisotropy is captured in an effective Vlasov term\nin the transport equation. The effects of the instability are handled by making\na relation with the phenomenologically known jet quenching parameter in RHIC\nand LHC. Interestingly, the presence of instability significantly affect the\ntemperature and momentum dependences of the HQ drag and diffusion coefficients.\nThese results may have appreciable impact on the experimental observables such\nas, the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{AA}(p_T)$, and the elliptic flow,\n$v_2(p_T)$, of heavy mesons in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies\nwhich is a matter of future investigation.\n", "  We show that a quantum-limited phase-preserving amplifier can act as a\nwhich-path information eraser when followed by heterodyne detection. This 'beam\nsplitter with gain' implements a continuous joint measurement on the signal\nsources. As an application, we propose heralded concurrent remote entanglement\ngeneration between two qubits coupled dispersively to separate cavities.\nDissimilar qubit-cavity pairs can be made indistinguishable by simple\nengineering of the cavity driving fields providing further experimental\nflexibility and the prospect for scalability. Additionally, we find an analytic\nsolution for the stochastic master equation, a quantum filter, yielding a\nthorough physical understanding of the nonlinear measurement process leading to\nan entangled state of the qubits. We determine the concurrence of the entangled\nstates and analyze its dependence on losses and measurement inefficiencies.\n", "  The monolithic integration of electronics and photonics has attracted\nenormous attention due to its potential applications. However, the realization\nof such hybrid circuits has remained a challenge because it requires optical\ncommunication at nanometer scales. A major challenge to this integration is the\nidentification of a suitable material. After discussing the material aspect of\nthe challenge, we identified atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) as a perfect material platform to implement the circuit. The selection\nof TMDs is based on their very distinct property: monolayer TMDs are able to\nemit and absorb light at the same wavelength determined by direct exciton\ntransitions. To prove the concept, we fabricated simple devices consisting of\nsilver nanowires as plasmonic waveguides and monolayer TMDs as active\noptoelectronic media. Using photoexcitation, direct optical imaging and\nspectral analysis, we demonstrated generation and detection of surface plasmon\npolaritons by monolayer TMDs. Regarded as novel materials for electronics and\nphotonics, transition metal dichalcogenides are expected to find new\napplications in next generation integrated circuits.\n", "  We compute the time evolution of correlation functions after quantum quenches\nin the sine--Gordon model within the semiclassical approximation which is\nexpected to yield accurate results for small quenches. We demonstrate this by\nreproducing results of a recent form factor calculation of the relaxation of\nexpectation values. Extending these results, we find that the expectation\nvalues of most vertex operators do not decay to zero. We give analytic\nexpressions for the relaxation of dynamic correlation functions, and we show\nthat they have diffusive behavior for large timelike separation.\n", "  We present a new set of analytic models for the expansion of HII regions\npowered by UV photoionisation from massive stars and compare them to a new\nsuite of radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent,\nself-gravitating molecular clouds. To perform these simulations we use the\nEulerian adaptive mesh magnetohydrodynamics code RAMSES-RT, including radiative\ntransfer of UV photons. Our analytic models successfully predict the global\nbehaviour of the HII region provided the density and velocity structure of the\ncloud is known. We give estimates for the HII region behaviour based on a power\nlaw fit to the density field assuming that the system is virialised. We give a\nradius at which the ionisation front should stop expanding (\"stall\"). If this\nradius is smaller than the distance to the edge of the cloud, the HII region\nwill be trapped by the cloud. This effect is more severe in collapsing clouds\nthan in virialised clouds, since the density in the former increases\ndramatically over time, with much larger photon emission rates needed for the\nHII region to escape a collapsing cloud. We also measure the response of Jeans\nunstable gas to the HII regions to predict the impact of UV radiation on star\nformation in the cloud. We find that the mass in unstable gas can be explained\nby a model in which the clouds are evaporated by UV photons, suggesting that\nthe net feedback on star formation should be negative\n", "  We analytically derive a compatible family of effective field theories that\nuniquely describe topological superconductors in 3D, their 2D boundary and\ntheir 1D defect lines. We start by deriving the topological field theory of a\n3D topological superconductor in class DIII, which is consistent with its\nsymmetries. Then we identify the effective theory of a 2D topological\nsuperconductor in class D living on the gapped boundary of the 3D system. By\nemploying the holographic correspondence we derive the effective chiral\nconformal field theory that describes the gapless modes living on the defect\nlines or effective boundary of the class D topological superconductor. We\ndemonstrate that the chiral central charge is given in terms of the 3D winding\nnumber of the bulk which by its turn is equal to the Chern number of its gapped\nboundary.\n", "  We introduce redMaGiC, an automated algorithm for selecting Luminous Red\nGalaxies (LRGs). The algorithm was specifically developed to minimize\nphotometric redshift uncertainties in photometric large-scale structure\nstudies. redMaGiC achieves this by self-training the color-cuts necessary to\nproduce a luminosity-thresholded LRG sample of constant comoving density. We\ndemonstrate that redMaGiC photozs are very nearly as accurate as the best\nmachine-learning based methods, yet they require minimal spectroscopic\ntraining, do not suffer from extrapolation biases, and are very nearly\nGaussian. We apply our algorithm to Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science\nVerification (SV) data to produce a redMaGiC catalog sampling the redshift\nrange $z\\in[0.2,0.8]$. Our fiducial sample has a comoving space density of\n$10^{-3}\\ (h^{-1} Mpc)^{-3}$, and a median photoz bias ($z_{spec}-z_{photo}$)\nand scatter $(\\sigma_z/(1+z))$ of 0.005 and 0.017 respectively. The\ncorresponding $5\\sigma$ outlier fraction is 1.4%. We also test our algorithm\nwith Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8) and Stripe 82 data,\nand discuss how spectroscopic training can be used to control photoz biases at\nthe 0.1% level.\n", "  A comprehensive overview is given of the literature on slip transmission\ncriteria for grain boundaries in metals, with a focus on slip system and grain\nboundary orientation. Much of this extensive literature has been informed by\nexperimental investigations. The use of geometric criteria in continuum crystal\nplasticity models is discussed. The theoretical framework of Gurtin (2008, J.\nMech. Phys. Solids 56, p. 640) is reviewed for the single slip case. This\nhighlights the connections to slip transmission criteria from the literature\nthat are not discussed in the work itself. Different geometric criteria are\ncompared for the single slip case with regard to their prediction of slip\ntransmission. Perspectives on additional criteria, investigated in experiments\nand used in computational simulations, are given.\n", "  The attempt to gain a theoretical understanding of the concept of time in\nquantum mechanics has triggered significant progress towards the search for\nfaster and more efficient quantum technologies. One of such advances consists\nin the interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relations as lower bounds\nfor the minimal evolution time between two distinguishable states of a quantum\nsystem, also known as quantum speed limits. We investigate how the non\nuniqueness of a bona fide measure of distinguishability defined on the quantum\nstate space affects the quantum speed limits and can be exploited in order to\nderive improved bounds. Specifically, we establish an infinite family of\nquantum speed limits valid for unitary and nonunitary evolutions, based on an\nelegant information geometric formalism. Our work unifies and generalizes\nexisting results on quantum speed limits, and provides instances of novel\nbounds which are tighter than any established one based on the conventional\nquantum Fisher information. We illustrate our findings with relevant examples,\ndemonstrating the importance of choosing different information metrics for open\nsystem dynamics, as well as clarifying the roles of classical populations\nversus quantum coherences, in the determination and saturation of the speed\nlimits. Our results can find applications in the optimization and control of\nquantum technologies such as quantum computation and metrology, and might\nprovide new insights in fundamental investigations of quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  A single-crystal gradient plasticity model is presented that includes a\npower-law type defect energy depending on the gradient of an equivalent plastic\nstrain. Numerical regularization for the case of vanishing gradients is\nemployed in the finite element discretization of the theory. Three exemplary\nchoices of the defect energy exponent are compared in finite element\nsimulations of elastic-plastic tricrystals under tensile loading. The influence\nof the power-law exponent is discussed related to the distribution of gradients\nand in regard to size effects. In addition, an analytical solution is presented\nfor the single slip case supporting the numerical results. The influence of the\npower-law exponent is contrasted to the influence of the normalization\nconstant.\n", "  For strongly repulsive bosons in one dimension, we provide detailed modeling\nof the Bragg pulse used in quantum Newton's cradle-like settings or in Bragg\nspectroscopy experiments. By employing the Fermi-Bose mapping for a finite\nharmonically trapped gas and the Quench Action approach for a thermodynamic\nsystem on a ring, we reconstruct the exact post-pulse many-body time evolution\nof Lieb-Liniger gases in the Tonks-Girardeau limit, together with their\nchanging local density profile and momentum distribution. Our results display a\nclear separation of timescales between rapid and trap-insensitive relaxation\nimmediately after the pulse, followed by slow in-trap periodic behaviour.\n", "  We propose a method for construction of Darboux transformations, which is a\nnew development of the dressing method for Lax operators invariant under a\nreduction group. We apply the method to the vector sine-Gordon equation and\nderive its B\\\"acklund transformations. We show that there is a new Lax operator\ncanonically associated with our Darboux transformation resulting an\nevolutionary differential-difference system on a sphere. The latter is a\ngeneralised symmetry for the chain of B\\\"acklund transformations. Using the\nre-factorisation approach and the Bianchi permutability of the Darboux\ntransformations we derive new vector Yang-Baxter map and integrable discrete\nvector sine-Gordon equation on a sphere.\n", "  The tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole (MBH) is thought to\nproduce a transient luminous event. Such tidal disruption events (TDEs) may\nplay an important role in the detection and characterization of MBHs and probe\nthe properties and dynamics of their nuclear stellar clusters (NSCs) hosts.\nPrevious studies estimated the recent rates of TDEs in the local universe.\nHowever, the long-term evolution of the rates throughout the history of the\nuniverse has been hardly explored. Here we consider the TDE history, using\nevolutionary models for the evolution of galactic nuclei. We use a 1D\nFokker-Planck approach to explore the evolution of MBH-hosting NSCs, and obtain\nthe disruption rates of stars during their evolution. We complement these with\nan analysis of TDEs history based on N-body simulation data, and find them to\nbe comparable. We consider NSCs that are built-up from close-in star-formation\n(SF) or from SF/clusters-dispersal far-out, a few pc from the MBH. We also\nexplore cases where primordial NSCs exist and later evolve through additional\nstar-formation/cluster-dispersal processes. We study the dependence of the TDE\nhistory on the type of galaxy, as well as the dependence on the MBH mass. These\nprovide several scenarios, with a continuous increase of the TDE rates over\ntime for cases of far-out SF and a more complex behavior for the close-in SF\ncases. Finally, we integrate the TDE histories of the various scenarios to\nprovide a total TDE history of the universe, which can be potentially probed\nwith future large surveys (e.g. LSST).\n", "  We consider a model quantum field theory with a scalar quantum field in de\nSitter space-time in a Bohmian version with a field ontology, i.e., an actual\nfield configuration $\\varphi({\\bf x},t)$ guided by a wave function on the space\nof field configurations. We analyze the asymptotics at late times\n($t\\to\\infty$) and provide reason to believe that for more or less any wave\nfunction and initial field configuration, every Fourier coefficient\n$\\varphi_{\\bf k}(t)$ of the field is asymptotically of the form $c_{\\bf\nk}\\sqrt{1+{\\bf k}^2 \\exp(-2Ht)/H^2}$, where the limiting coefficients $c_{\\bf\nk}=\\varphi_{\\bf k}(\\infty)$ are independent of $t$ and $H$ is the Hubble\nconstant quantifying the expansion rate of de Sitter space-time. In particular,\nevery field mode $\\varphi_{\\bf k}$ possesses a limit as $t\\to\\infty$ and thus\n\"freezes.\" This result is relevant to the question whether Boltzmann brains\nform in the late universe according to this theory, and supports that they do\nnot.\n", "  We follow the premise that most intermediate luminosity optical transients\n(ILOTs) are powered by rapid mass accretion onto a main sequence star, and\nstudy the effects of jets launched by an accretion disk. The disk is formed due\nto large specific angular momentum of the accreted mass. The two opposite jets\nmight expel some of the mass from the reservoir of gas that feeds the disk, and\ntherefore reduces and shortens the mass accretion process. We argue that by\nthis process ILOTs limit their luminosity and might even shut themselves off in\nthis negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The group of ILOTs is a new member\nof a large family of astrophysical objects whose activity is regulated by the\noperation of the JFM.\n", "  Ultracold fermions in a one-dimensional, spin-dependent, optical lattice are\ndescribed by a non-standard Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbour\ncorrelated hopping. Periodic driving of the lattice allows wide tuning of the\nsystem parameters. We solve this model exactly for a special value of the\ncorrelated hopping. The solution reveals the general properties of this system\nfor arbitrary filling: exact and asymmetric spin-charge separation, a gapless\nspectrum of lowest energy excitations, a spin-gap, which may be interpreted in\nterms of collective hole pairing and a non-vanishing den Nijs-Rommelse type\nstring correlator. Numerical studies away from the integrable point show the\npersistence of both long range string order and spin-gap.\n", "  Symbolic equations are one of the many representations used in physics.\nUnderstanding these representations is important for students because they are\nhow students access knowledge in physics. In this paper I build off of the work\nby Redish and Kuo, which described the cultural differences between how math is\nused in math class and physics class, and the work by Fredlund et al, which\ndescribed the importance of unpacking representations for physics student. I\nwill describe how differences in the goals of numeric and symbolic problem\nsolving lead to different set of affordances. In particular, the inability to\ndistinguish variables, knowns, and unknowns in symbolic problem solving is a\nbenefit when describing a generalized physical system. I also present evidence\nthat observed errors when trying to solve symbolic problems are due to students\nacting on inappropriate cues associated with numeric problem solving.\n", "  We examine selected aspects of peer review and suggest possible improvements.\nTo this end, we analyse a dataset containing information about 300 papers\nsubmitted to the Biochemistry and Biotechnology section of the Journal of the\nSerbian Chemical Society. After separating the peer review process into stages\nthat each review has to go through, we use a weighted directed graph to\ndescribe it in a probabilistic manner and test the impact of some modifications\nof the editorial policy on the efficiency of the whole process.\n", "  A theoretical model for stratified epithelium is presented. The viscoelastic\nproperties of the tissue is assumed to be dependent on the spatial distribution\nof proliferative and differentiated cells. Based on this assumption, a\nhydrodynamic description for tissue dynamics at long-wavelength, long-time\nlimit is developed, and the analysis reveals important insight for the dynamics\nof an epithelium close to its steady state. When the proliferative cells occupy\na thin region close to the basal membrane, the relaxation rate towards the\nsteady state is enhanced by cell division and cell apoptosis. On the other\nhand, when the region where proliferative cells reside becomes sufficiently\nthick, a flow induced by cell apoptosis close to the apical surface could\nenhance small perturbations. This destabilizing mechanism is general for\ncontinuous self-renewal multi-layered tissues, it could be related to the\norigin of certain tissue morphology and developing pattern.\n", "  Self-heating is a severe problem for high-power microelectronic devices.\nGraphene and few-layer graphene have attracted tremendous attention for heat\nremoval thanks to their extraordinarily high in-plane thermal conductivity.\nHowever, this high thermal conductivity undergoes severe degradations caused by\nthe contact with the substrate and the functionalization-induced point defects.\nHere we show that thermal management of a micro heater can be substantially\nimproved via introduction of alternative heat-escaping channels implemented\nwith graphene-based film covalently bonded to functionalized graphene oxide\nthrough silane molecules. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a\ncounter-intuitive enhancement of the thermal conductivity of such a\ngraphene-based film. This increase in the in-plane thermal conductivity of\nsupported graphene is accompanied by an improvement on the graphene-substrates\nthermal contact. Using infrared thermal imaging, we demonstrate that the\ntemperature of the hotspots can be lowered by 12 $^o$C in transistors operating\nat 130 W mm$^{-2}$ , which corresponds to half of an order-of-magnitude\nincrease in the device lifetime. Ab initio and molecular dynamics simulations\nreveal that the functionalization constrains the cross-plane scattering of low\nfrequency phonons, which in turn enhances in-plane heat conduction of the\nbonded graphene film by recovering the long flexural phonon lifetime.\n", "  The interfaces between two condensed phases often exhibit emergent physical\nproperties that can lead to new physics and novel device applications, and are\nthe subject of intense study in many disciplines. We here apply novel\nexperimental and theoretical techniques to the characterization of one such\ninteresting interface system: the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed in\nmultilayers consisting of SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and GdTiO$_3$ (GTO). This system has\nbeen the subject of multiple studies recently and shown to exhibit very high\ncarrier charge densities and ferromagnetic effects, among other intriguing\nproperties. We have studied a 2DEG-forming multilayer of the form [6 unit cells\nSTO/3 unit cells of GTO]$_{20}$ using a unique array of photoemission\ntechniques including soft and hard x-ray excitation, soft x-ray angle-resolved\nphotoemission, core-level spectroscopy, resonant excitation, and standing-wave\neffects, as well as theoretical calculations of the electronic structure at\nseveral levels and of the actual photoemission process. Standing-wave\nmeasurements below and above a strong resonance have been introduced as a\npowerful method for studying the 2DEG depth distribution. We have thus\ncharacterized the spatial and momentum properties of this 2DEG with\nunprecedented detail, determining via depth-distribution measurements that it\nis spread throughout the 6 u.c. layer of STO, and measuring the momentum\ndispersion of its states. The experimental results are supported in several\nways by theory, leading to a much more complete picture of the nature of this\n2DEG, and suggesting that oxygen vacancies are not the origin of it. Similar\nmulti-technique photoemission studies of such states at buried interfaces,\ncombined with comparable theory, will be a very fruitful future approach for\nexploring and modifying the fascinating world of buried-interface physics and\nchemistry.\n", "  When ferromagnetic particles are suspended at an interface under magnetic\nfields, dipole-dipole interactions compete with capillary attraction. This\ncombination of forces has recently given promising results towards controllable\nself-assemblies, as well as low Reynolds swimming systems. The elementary unit\nof these assemblies is a pair of particles. Although equilibrium properties of\nthis interaction are well described, dynamics remain unclear. In this letter,\nthe properties of magnetocapillary bonds are determined by probing them with\nmagnetic perturbations. Two deformation modes are evidenced and discussed.\nThese modes exhibit resonances whose frequencies can be detuned to generate\nnon-reciprocal motion. A model is proposed which can become the basis for\nelaborate collective behaviours.\n", "  Finding a suitably growing length scale that increases in tandem with the\nimmense viscous slowdown of supercooled liquids is an open problem associated\nwith the glass transition. Here, we define and demonstrate the existence of one\nsuch length scale which may be experimentally verifiable. This is the length\nscale over which external shear perturbations appreciably penetrate into a\nliquid as the glass transition is approached. We provide simulation based\nevidence of its existence, and its growth by at least an order of magnitude, by\nusing molecular dynamics simulations of NiZr2, a good fragile glass former. On\nthe probed timescale, upon approaching the glass transition temperature from\nabove, this length scale, {\\xi} is also shown to be consistent with Ising-like\nscaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possible scaling of {\\xi} about the\ntemperature at which super-Arrhenius growth of viscosity, and a marked growth\nof the penetration depth sets in. Our simulation results suggest that upon\nsupercooling, marked initial increase of the shear penetration depth in fluids\nmay occur in tandem with the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation.\n", "  Estimating the temperature of a cold quantum system is difficult. Usually,\none measures a well-understood thermal state and uses that prior knowledge to\ninfer its temperature. In contrast, we introduce a method of thermometry that\nassumes minimal knowledge of the state of a system and is potentially\nnon-destructive. Our method uses a universal temperature-dependence of the\nquench dynamics of an initially thermal system coupled to a qubit probe that\nfollows from the Tasaki-Crooks theorem for non-equilibrium work distributions.\nWe provide examples for a cold-atom system, in which our thermometry protocol\nmay retain accuracy and precision at subnanokelvin temperatures.\n", "  Context. Current solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation models describe\nthe effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs as diffusion, using a\nFokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP models cannot explain the observed\nfast access of SEPs across the average magnetic field to regions that are\nwidely separated in longitude within the heliosphere without using\nunrealistically strong cross-field diffusion.\n  Aims. We study whether the recently suggested early non-diffusive phase of\nSEP propagation can explain the wide SEP events with realistic particle\ntransport parameters.\n  Methods. We used a novel model that accounts for the SEP propagation along\nfield lines that meander as a result of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive\npropagation mode has been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation\nearly in the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the traditional\napproach, and to SEP observations.\n  Results. Using the new model, we reproduce the observed longitudinal extent\nof SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by a Gaussian profile with\n$\\sigma=30-50^\\circ$, while current diffusion theory can only explain extents\nof 11$^\\circ$ with realistic diffusion coefficients. Our model also reproduces\nthe timing of SEP arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained\nusing the diffusion model.\n  Conclusions. The early onset of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be\nunderstood as a result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the\ninterplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that properly\ndescribes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross-field propagation.\n", "  A long-standing issue in topological insulator research has been to find a\nmaterial that provides an ideal platform for characterizing topological surface\nstates without interference from bulk electronic states and can reliably be\nfabricated as bulk crystals. This material would be a bulk insulator, have a\nsurface state Dirac point energy well isolated from the bulk valence and\nconduction bands, have high surface state electronic mobility, and be growable\nas large, high quality bulk single crystals. Here we show that this major\nmaterials obstacle in the field is overcome by crystals of lightly Sn-doped\nBi1.1Sb0.9Te2S (Sn-BSTS) grown by the Vertical Bridgeman method, which we\ncharacterize here via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning\ntunneling microscopy, transport studies of the bulk and surface states, and\nX-ray diffraction and Raman scattering. We present this new material as a bulk\ntopological insulator that can be reliably grown and studied in many\nlaboratories around the world.\n", "  We investigate Linear and Inverse seesaw mechanisms with maximal zero\ntextures of the constituent matrices subjected to the assumption of non-zero\neigenvalues for the neutrino mass matrix $m_\\nu$ and charged lepton mass matrix\n$m_e$. If we restrict to the minimally parametrized non-singular `$m_e$' (i.e.,\nwith maximum number of zeros) it gives rise to only 6 possible textures of\n$m_e$. Non-zero determinant of $m_\\nu$ dictates six possible textures of the\nconstituent matrices. We ask in this minimalistic approach, what are the\nphenomenologically allowed maximum zero textures are possible. It turns out\nthat Inverse seesaw leads to 7 allowed two-zero textures while the Linear\nseesaw leads to only one. In Inverse seesaw, we show that 2 is the maximum\nnumber of independent zeros that can be inserted into $\\mu_S$ to obtain all 7\nviable two-zero textures of $m_\\nu$. On the other hand, in Linear seesaw\nmechanism, the minimal scheme allows maximum 5 zeros to be accommodated in\n`$m$' so as to obtain viable effective neutrino mass matrices ($m_\\nu$).\nInterestingly, we find that our minimalistic approach in Inverse seesaw leads\nto a realization of all the phenomenologically allowed two-zero textures\nwhereas in Linear seesaw only one such texture is viable. Next our numerical\nanalysis shows that none of the two-zero textures give rise to enough CP\nviolation or significant $\\delta_{CP}$. Therefore, if $\\delta_{CP}=\\pi/2$ is\nestablished, our minimalistic scheme may still be viable provided we allow more\nnumber of parameters in `$m_e$'.\n", "  The promise of ultrafast light field driven electronic nanocircuits has\nstimulated the development of the new research field of attosecond nanophysics.\nAn essential prerequisite for advancing this new area is the ability to\ncharacterize optical nearfields from light interaction with nanostructures with\nsub cycle resolution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate attosecond nearfield\nretrieval with a gold nanotip using streaking spectroscopy. By comparison of\nthe results from gold nanotips to those obtained for a noble gas, the spectral\nresponse of the nanotip near field arising from laser excitation can be\nextracted. Monte Carlo MC trajectory simulations in near fields obtained with\nthe macroscopic Maxwells equations elucidate the streaking mechanism on the\nnanoscale.\n", "  This paper introduces a statistical and other analysis of peer reviewers in\norder to approach their \"quality\" through some quantification measure, thereby\nleading to some quality metrics. Peer reviewer reports for the Journal of the\nSerbian Chemical Society are examined. The text of each report has first to be\nadapted to word counting software in order to avoid jargon inducing confusion\nwhen searching for the word frequency: e.g. C must be distinguished, depending\nif it means Carbon or Celsius, etc. Thus, every report has to be carefully\n\"rewritten\". Thereafter, the quantity, variety and distribution of words are\nexamined in each report and compared to the whole set. Two separate months,\naccording when reports came in, are distinguished to observe any possible\nhidden spurious effects. Coherence is found. An empirical distribution is\nsearched for through a Zipf-Pareto rank-size law. It is observed that peer\nreview reports are very far from usual texts in this respect. Deviations from\nthe usual (first) Zipf's law are discussed. A theoretical suggestion for the\n\"best (or worst) report\" and by extension \"good (or bad) reviewer\", within this\ncontext, is provided from an entropy argument, through the concept of \"distance\nto average\" behavior. Another entropy-based measure also allows to measure the\njournal reviews (whence reviewers) for further comparison with other journals\nthrough their own reviewer reports.\n", "  Few-layer black phosphorus has recently emerged as a promising candidate for\nnovel electronic and optoelectronic device. Here we demonstrate by\nfirst-principles calculations and Boltzmann theory that, black phosphorus could\nalso have potential thermoelectric applications and a fair ZT value of 1.1 can\nbe achieved at elevated temperature. Moreover, such value can be further\nincreased to 5.4 by substituting P atom with Sb atom, giving nominal formula of\nP0.75Sb0.25. Our theoretical work suggests that high thermoelectric performance\ncan be achieved without using complicated crystal structure or seeking for\nlow-dimensional systems.\n", "  Grand unified theories based on large groups (with rank greater or equal to 6\nare a natural context for dark matter models. They contain\nStandard-Model-singlet fermions that could be dark matter candidates, and can\ncontain new non-abelian interactions whose sphalerons convert baryons, leptons,\nand dark matter into each other, \"cogenerating\" a dark matter asymmetry\ncomparable to the baryon asymmetry. In this paper it is shown that the same\nnon-abelian interactions can \"pre-annihilate\" the symmetric component of heavy\ndark matter particles, which then decay late into light stable dark matter\nparticles that inherit their asymmetry. It is shown that such decays can come\nfrom d=5 operators that are Planck or GUT suppressed. We derive constraints on\nsuch models and present a simple realization based on the group SU(7).\n", "  We present the solution to an inverse problem arising in the context of\nfinding a distribution function for a specific collisionless plasma\nequilibrium. The inverse problem involves the solution of two integral\nequations, each having the form of a Weierstrass transform. We prove that\ninverting the Weierstrass transform using Hermite polynomials leads to\nconvergent infinite series. We also comment on the non-negativity of the\ndistribution function, with more detail on this in Allanson $\\textit{et al.,\nJournal of Plasma Physics}$, vol. 82 (03), 2016. Whilst applied to a specific\nmagnetic field, the inversion techniques used in this paper (as well as the\nderived convergence criteria and discussion of non-negativity) are of a general\nnature, and are applicable to other smooth pressure functions.\n", "  In ad hoc wireless networking, units are connected to each other rather than\nto a central, fixed, infrastructure. Constructing and maintaining such networks\ncreate several trade-off problems between robustness, communication speed,\npower consumption, etc., that bridges engineering, computer science and the\nphysics of complex systems. In this work, we address the role of mobility\npatterns of the agents on the optimal tuning of a small-world type network\nconstruction method. By this method, the network is updated periodically and\nheld static between the updates. We investigate the optimal updating times for\ndifferent scenarios of the movement of agents (modeling, for example, the\nfat-tailed trip distances, and periodicities, of human travel). We find that\nthese mobility patterns affect the power consumption in non-trivial ways and\ndiscuss how these effects can best be handled.\n", "  A direct correspondence of quantum mechanics as a minisuperspace model for a\nself-interacting scalar quantum-field theory is established by computing, in\nseveral models, the infrared contributions to 1-loop effective potentials of\nColeman--Weinberg type. A minisuperspace approximation rather than truncation\nis thereby obtained. By this approximation, the spatial averaging scale of\nminisuperspace models is identified with an infrared scale (but not a regulator\nor cut-off) delimiting the modes included in the minisuperspace model. Some\nversions of the models studied here have discrete space or modifications of the\nHamiltonian expected from proposals of loop quantum gravity. They shed light on\nthe question of how minisuperspace models of quantum cosmology can capture\nfeatures of full quantum gravity. While it is shown that modifications of the\nHamiltonian can well be described by minisuperspace truncations, some related\nphenomena such as signature change, confirmed and clarified here for modified\nscalar field theories, require at least a perturbative treatment of\ninhomogeneity beyond a strict minisuperspace model. The new methods suggest a\nsystematic extension of minisuperspace models by a canonical effective\nformulation of perturbative inhomogeneity.\n", "  Determining magnetic field properties in different environments of the cosmic\nlarge-scale structure as well as their evolution over redshift is a fundamental\nstep toward uncovering the origin of cosmic magnetic fields. Radio observations\npermit the study of extragalactic magnetic fields via measurements of the\nFaraday depth of extragalactic radio sources. Our aim is to investigate how\nmuch different extragalactic environments contribute to the Faraday depth\nvariance of these sources. We develop a Bayesian algorithm to distinguish\nstatistically Faraday depth variance contributions intrinsic to the source from\nthose due to the medium between the source and the observer. In our algorithm\nthe Galactic foreground and the measurement noise are taken into account as the\nuncertainty correlations of the galactic model. Additionally, our algorithm\nallows for the investigation of possible redshift evolution of the\nextragalactic contribution. This work presents the derivation of the algorithm\nand tests performed on mock observations. With cosmic magnetism being one of\nthe key science projects of the new generation of radio interferometers we have\nmade predictions for the algorithm's performance on data from the next\ngeneration of radio interferometers. Applications to real data are left for\nfuture work.\n", "  A successful and commonly used ab initio method for the calculation of\ncrystal field levels and magnetic anisotropy of lanthanide complexes consists\nof spin-adapted state-averaged CASSCF calculations followed by state\ninteraction with spin-orbit coupling (SI-SO). Based on two observations valid\nfor Ln(III) complexes, namely: (i) CASSCF 4f orbitals are expected to change\nvery little when optimized for different states belonging to the 4f electronic\nconfiguration, (ii) due to strong spin-orbit coupling the total spin is not a\ngood quantum number, we show here via a straightforward analysis and direct\ncalculation that the CASSCF/SI-SO method can be simplified to a single\nconfiguration-averaged HF calculation and one complete active space CI\ndiagonalization, including spin-orbit coupling, on determinant basis. Besides\nits conceptual simplicity, this approach has the advantage that all spin states\nof the 4f$^n$ configuration are automatically included in the SO coupling,\nthereby overcoming one of the computational limitations of the existing\nCASSCF/SI-SO approach. As an example, we consider three isostructural complexes\n[Ln(acac)$_3$(H$_2$O)$_2$], Ln = Dy$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and find that\nthe proposed simplified method yields crystal field levels and magnetic\ng-tensors that are in very good agreement with those obtained with\nCASSCF/SI-SO.\n", "  Nematicity and magnetism are two key features in Fe-based superconductors,\nand their interplay is one of the most important unsolved problems. In FeSe,\nthe magnetic order is absent below the structural transition temperature\n$T_{str}=90$K, in stark contrast that the magnetism emerges slightly below\n$T_{str}$ in other families. To understand such amazing material dependence, we\ninvestigate the spin-fluctuation-mediated orbital order ($n_{xz}\\neq n_{yz}$)\nby focusing on the orbital-spin interplay driven by the strong-coupling effect,\ncalled the vertex correction. This orbital-spin interplay is very strong in\nFeSe because of the small ratio between the Hund's and Coulomb interactions\n($\\bar{J}/\\bar{U}$) and large $d_{xz},d_{yz}$-orbitals weight at the Fermi\nlevel. For this reason, in the FeSe model, the orbital order is established\nirrespective that the spin fluctuations are very weak, so the magnetism is\nabsent below $T_{str}$. In contrast, in the LaFeAsO model, the magnetic order\nappears just below $T_{str}$ both experimentally and theoretically. Thus, the\norbital-spin interplay due to the vertex correction is the key ingredient in\nunderstanding the rich phase diagram with nematicity and magnetism in Fe-based\nsuperconductors in a unified way.\n", "  To understand the nematicity in Fe-based superconductors, nontrivial\n$k$-dependence of the orbital polarization ($\\Delta E_{xz}(k)$, $\\Delta\nE_{yz}(k)$) in the nematic phase, such as the sign reversal of the orbital\nsplitting between $\\Gamma$- and X,Y-points in FeSe, provides significant\ninformation. To solve this problem, we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nwith respect to the orbital polarization and spin susceptibility\nself-consistently. In FeSe, due to the sign-reversing orbital order, the hole-\nand electron-pockets are elongated along the $k_y$- and $k_x$-axes\nrespectively, consistently with experiments. In addition, an electron-pocket\nsplits into two Dirac cone Fermi pockets with increasing the orbital\npolarization. The orbital-order in Fe-based superconductors originates from the\nstrong positive feedback between the nematic orbital order and spin\nsusceptibility.\n", "  Terahertz (THz) imaging has the ability to see through otherwise opaque\nmaterials. However, due to the long wavelengths of THz radiation\n({\\lambda}=300{\\mu}m at 1THz), far-field THz imaging techniques are heavily\noutperformed by optical imaging in regards to the obtained resolution. In this\nwork we demonstrate near-field THz imaging with a single-pixel detector. We\nproject a time-varying optical mask onto a silicon wafer which is used to\nspatially modulate a pulse of THz radiation. The far-field transmission\ncorresponding to each mask is recorded by a single element detector and this\ndata is used to reconstruct the image of an object placed on the far side of\nthe silicon wafer. We demonstrate a proof of principal application where we\nimage a printed circuit board on the underside of a 115{\\mu}m thick silicon\nwafer with ~100{\\mu}m ({\\lambda}/4) resolution. With subwavelength resolution\nand the inherent sensitivity to local conductivity provided by the THz probe\nfrequencies, we show that it is possible to detect fissures in the circuitry\nwiring of a few microns in size. Imaging systems of this type could have other\nuses where non-invasive measurement or imaging of concealed structures with\nhigh resolution is necessary, such as in semiconductor manufacturing or in\nbio-imaging.\n", "  Bell-like inequalities have been used in order to distinguish non-local\nquantum pure states by various authors. The behavior of such inequalities under\nLorentz transformation has been a source of debate and controversies in the\npast. In this paper, we consider the two most commonly studied three-particle\npure states, that of W and GHZ states which exhibit distinctly different type\nof entanglement. We discuss the various types of three-particle inequalities\nused in previous studies and point to their corresponding shortcomings and\nstrengths. Our main result is that if one uses Czachor's relativistic spin\noperator and Svetlichny's inequality as the main measure of non-locality and\nuses the same angles in the rest frame ($S$) as well as the moving frame\n($S^{\\prime}$), then maximally violated inequality in $S$ will decrease in the\nmoving frame, and will eventually lead to lack of non-locality ( i.e.\nsatisfaction of inequality) in the $v \\rightarrow c$ limit. This is shown for\nboth the GHZ and W states and in two different configurations which are\ncommonly studied (\\textbf{Case $I$} and \\textbf{Case $II$}). Our results are in\nline with a more familiar case of two particle case. We also show that the\nsatisfaction of Svetlichny's inequality in the $v\\rightarrow c$ limit is\nindependent of initial particles' velocity. Our study shows that whenever we\nuse Czachor's relativistic spin operator, results draws a clear picture of\nthree-particle non-locality making its general properties consistent with\nprevious studies on two-particle systems regardless of the W state or the GHZ\nstate is involved.....\n", "  The polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to\nconstrain cosmological birefringence, the rotation of the linear polarization\nof CMB photons potentially induced by parity violating physics beyond the\nstandard model. This effect produces non-null CMB cross correlations between\ntemperature and B mode-polarization, and between E- and B-mode polarization.\nBoth cross-correlations are otherwise null in the standard cosmological model.\nWe use the recently released 2015 Planck likelihood in combination with the\nBicep2/Keck/Planck (BKP) likelihood to constrain the birefringence angle\n$\\alpha$. Our findings, that are compatible with no detection, read $\\alpha =\n0.0^{\\circ} \\pm 1.3^{\\circ} \\mbox{ (stat)} \\pm 1^{\\circ} \\mbox{ (sys)} $ for\n{\\sc Planck} data and $\\alpha = 0.30^{\\circ} \\pm 0.27^{\\circ} \\mbox{ (stat)}\n\\pm 1^{\\circ} \\mbox{(sys)} $ for BKP data. We finally forecast the expected\nimprovements over present constraints when the Planck BB, TB and EB spectra at\nhigh $\\ell$ will be included in the analysis.\n", "  A recent debate has ensued over the claim by Pikovski et al. [Nat. Phys. 11,\n668 (2015)] that systems with internal degrees of freedom undergo a universal,\ngravity-induced, type of decoherence that explains their quantum-to-classical\ntransition. This decoherence is supposed to arise from the different\ngravitational redshifts experienced by such systems when placed in a\nsuperposition of two wave packets at different heights in a gravitational\nfield. Here we investigate some aspects of the discussion with the aid of\nsimple examples. In particular, we first resolve an apparent conflict between\nthe reported results and the equivalence principle by noting that the static\nand free-fall descriptions focus on states associated with different\nhypersurfaces. Next, we emphasize that predictions regarding the observability\nof interference become relevant only in the context of concrete experimental\nsettings. As a result, we caution against hasty claims of universal validity.\nFinally, we dispute the claim that, at least in the scenarios discussed by\nPikovski et al., gravitation is responsible for the reported results, and we\nquestion the alleged ability of decoherence to explain the quantum-to-classical\ntransition. In consequence, we argue against the extraordinary assertion by\nPikovski et al. that gravity can account for the emergence of classicality.\n", "  The Doppler effect, the shift in the frequency of sound due to motion, is\npresent in both classical gases and quantum superfluids. Here, we perform an\nin-situ, minimally destructive measurement, of the persistent current in a\nring-shaped, superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate using the Doppler effect.\nPhonon modes generated in this condensate have their frequencies Doppler\nshifted by a persistent current. This frequency shift will cause a\nstanding-wave phonon mode to be \"dragged\" along with the persistent current. By\nmeasuring this precession, one can extract the background flow velocity. This\ntechnique will find utility in experiments where the winding number is\nimportant, such as in emerging `atomtronic' devices.\n", "  The momentum-weighted sum of the charges of tracks associated to a jet is\nsensitive to the charge of the initiating quark or gluon. This paper presents a\nmeasurement of the distribution of momentum-weighted sums, called jet charge,\nin dijet events using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded with the ATLAS detector\nat $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. The jet charge distribution\nis unfolded to remove distortions from detector effects and the resulting\nparticle-level distribution is compared with several models. The\n$p_T$-dependence of the jet charge distribution average and standard deviation\nare compared to predictions obtained with several LO and NLO parton\ndistribution functions. The data are also compared to different Monte Carlo\nsimulations of QCD dijet production using various settings of the free\nparameters within these models. The chosen value of the strong coupling\nconstant used to calculate gluon radiation is found to have a significant\nimpact on the predicted jet charge. There is evidence for a $p_{T}$-dependence\nof the jet charge distribution for a given jet flavor. In agreement with\nperturbative QCD predictions, the data show that the average jet charge of\nquark-initiated jets decreases in magnitude as the energy of the jet increases.\n", "  The spatial structure of stellar populations with different chemical\nabundances in the Milky Way contains a wealth of information on Galactic\nevolution over cosmic time. We use data on 14,699 red-clump stars from the\nAPOGEE survey, covering 4 kpc <~ R <~ 15 kpc, to determine the structure of\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs)---stars in narrow bins in [a/Fe] and\n[Fe/H]---accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE selection function\nand the spatially-variable dust obscuration. We determine that all MAPs with\nenhanced [a/Fe] are centrally concentrated and are well-described as\nexponentials with a scale length of 2.2+/-0.2 kpc over the whole radial range\nof the disk. We discover that the surface-density profiles of low-[a/Fe] MAPs\nare complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display a\npeak radius ranging from ~5 kpc to ~13 kpc at low [Fe/H]. The extensive radial\ncoverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of\neach MAP. While high-[a/Fe] MAPs have constant scale heights, low-[a/Fe] MAPs\nflare. We confirm, now with high-precision abundances, previous results that\neach MAP contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[Fe/H],\nlow-[a/Fe] and high-[Fe/H], high-[a/Fe] MAPs have intermediate (h_Z~300 to 600\npc) scale heights that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk\ndivide. That the high-[a/Fe], thick disk components do not flare is strong\nevidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The\ncorrespondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age of\nstellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of galactic\ndisks. The details of these relations will constrain the variety of physical\nconditions under which stars form throughout the MW disk.\n", "  The cooling phase of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts can be used to\nconstrain the neutron star (NS) compactness by comparing the observed cooling\ntracks of bursts to accurate theoretical atmosphere model calculations. By\napplying the so-called cooling tail method, where the information from the\nwhole cooling track is used, we constrain the mass, radius, and distance for\nthree different NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1702-429, 4U 1724-307, and\nSAX J1810.8-260. Care is taken to only use the hard state bursts where it is\nthought that only the NS surface alone is emitting. We then utilize a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to obtain a\nparameterized equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter from our initial\nmass and radius constraints. This allows us to set limits on various nuclear\nparameters and to constrain an empirical pressure-density relation for the\ndense matter. Our predicted EoS results in NS radius between 10.5-12.8 km (95%\nconfidence limits) for a mass of 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$. Due to systematic errors and\nuncertainty in the composition these results should be interpreted as lower\nlimits for the radius.\n", "  Recent measurements of the temperature field of Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) provide tantalising evidence for violation of Statistical Isotropy (SI)\nthat constitutes a fundamental tenet of contemporary cosmology. CMB space based\nmissions, WMAP and Planck have observed a $7\\%$ departure in the SI temperature\nfield at large angular scales. However, due to higher cosmic variance at low\nmultipoles, the significance of this measurement is not expected to improve\nfrom any future CMB temperature measurements. We demonstrate that weak lensing\nof the CMB due to scalar perturbations produce a corresponding SI violation in\n$B$ modes of CMB polarization at smaller angular scales. Measurability of this\nphenomenon depends upon the scales ($l$ range) over which power asymmetry is\npresent. Power asymmetry which is restricted only to $l<64$ in temperature\nfield cannot lead to any significant observable effect from this new window.\nHowever, this effect can put an independent bound on the spatial range of\nscales of hemispherical asymmetry present in scalar sector.\n", "  Inferences about the spatial density or phase-space structure of stellar\npopulations in the Milky Way require a precise determination of the effective\nsurvey volume. The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared\nspectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic mid-plane\nregion, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the\nthree-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework\nfor analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This\nformalism demonstrates that the spatially-complex effect of extinction on the\nselection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a\nlow-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the\nsmooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D\nextinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of\nstars. However, the current distance resolution is inadequate and needs to be\nimproved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also\npresent a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of\nextinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective\nselection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of\nred-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D\nextinction maps.\n", "  The Laguerre-Gauss modes are a class of fundamental and well-studied optical\nfields. These stable, shape-invariant photons - exhibiting circular-cylindrical\nsymmetry - are familiar from laser optics, micro-mechanical manipulation,\nquantum optics, communication, and foundational studies in both classical\noptics and quantum physics. They are characterized, chiefly, by two modes\nnumbers: the azimuthal index indicating the orbital angular momentum of the\nbeam - which itself has spawned a burgeoning and vibrant sub-field - and the\nradial index, which up until recently, has largely been ignored. In this\nmanuscript we develop a differential operator formalism for dealing with the\nradial modes in both the position and momentum representations, and - more\nimportantly - give for the first time the meaning of this quantum number in\nterms of a well-defined physical parameter: the \"intrinsic hyperbolic momentum\ncharge\".\n", "  A perturbative description of Large Scale Structure is a cornerstone of our\nunderstanding of the observed distribution of matter in the universe.\nRenormalization is an essential and defining step to make this description\nphysical and predictive. Here we introduce a systematic renormalization\nprocedure, which neatly associates counterterms to the UV-sensitive diagrams\norder by order, as it is commonly done in quantum field theory. As a concrete\nexample, we renormalize the one-loop power spectrum and bispectrum of both\ndensity and velocity. In addition, we present a series of results that are\nvalid to all orders in perturbation theory. First, we show that while\nsystematic renormalization requires temporally non-local counterterms, in\npractice one can use an equivalent basis made of local operators. We give an\nexplicit prescription to generate all counterterms allowed by the symmetries.\nSecond, we present a formal proof of the well-known general argument that the\ncontribution of short distance perturbations to large scale density contrast\n$\\delta$ and momentum density $\\mathbf\\pi(\\mathbf k)$ scale as $k^2$ and $k$,\nrespectively. Third, we demonstrate that the common practice of introducing\ncounterterms only in the Euler equation when one is interested in correlators\nof $ \\delta$ is indeed valid to all orders.\n", "  The thermoelectric properties of distorted bismuth (110) layer are\ninvestigated using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann\ntransport equation for both electrons and phonons. To accurately predict the\nelectronic and transport properties, the quasiparticle corrections with the GW\napproximation of many-body effects have been explicitly included. It is found\nthat a maximum ZT value of 6.4 can be achieved for n-type system, which is\nessentially stemmed from the weak scattering of electrons. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the distorted Bi layer remains high ZT values at relatively\nbroad regions of both temperature and carrier concentration. Our theoretical\nwork emphasizes that the deformation potential constant characterizing the\nelectron-phonon scattering strength is an important paradigm for searching high\nthermoelectric performance materials.\n", "  We prove that the hierarchy of higher antibrackets (aka higher Koszul\nbrackets, aka Koszul braces) of a linear operator $\\Delta$ on a commutative\nsuperalgebra can be defined by some universal formulas involving iterated\nNijenhuis-Richardson brackets having as arguments $\\Delta$ and the\nmultiplication operators. As a byproduct, we can immediately extend higher\nantibrackets to noncommutative algebras in a way preserving the validity of\ngeneralized Jacobi identities.\n", "  A multiagent based model for a system of cooperative agents aiming at growth\nis proposed. This is based on a set of generalized Verhulst-Lotka-Volterra\ndifferential equations. In this study, strong cooperation is allowed among\nagents having similar sizes, and weak cooperation if agent have markedly\ndifferent \"sizes\", thus establishing a peer-to-peer modulated interaction\nscheme. A rigorous analysis of the stable configurations is presented first\nexamining the fixed points of the system, next determining their stability as a\nfunction of the model parameters. It is found that the agents are\nself-organizing into clusters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, depending\non parameter values, multiple stable configurations can coexist. It occurs that\nonly one of them always emerges with probability close to one, because its\nassociated attractor dominates over the rest. This is shown through numerical\nintegrations and simulations,after analytic developments. In contrast to the\ncompetitive case, agents are able to increase their capacity beyond the\nno-interaction case limit. In other words, when some collaborative partnership\namong a relatively small number of partners takes place, all agents act in good\nfaith prioritizing the common good, whence receiving a mutual benefit allowing\nthem to surpass their capacity.\n", "  The close relationship between the noise and the thermoelectric conversion is\nstudied in a quantum dot using a quantum approach based on the non-equilibrium\nGreen function technique. We show that both the figure of merit and the\nefficiency can be written in term of noise and we highlight the central role\nplayed by the correlator between the charge current and the heat current that\nwe call the mixed noise. After giving the expression of this quantity as an\nintegral over energy, we calculate it, first in the linear response regime,\nnext in the limit of small transmission through the barriers (Schottky regime)\nand finally in the intermediate regime. We discuss the notion of efficiency\nfluctuations and we also see here that the mixed noise comes into play.\n", "  In this note, we announce a complete classification of stability of periodic\nroll-wave solutions of the viscous shallow-water equations, from their onset at\nFroude number $F\\approx 2$ up to the infinite-Froude limit. For intermediate\nFroude numbers, we obtain numerically a particularly simple power-law relation\nbetween $F$ and the boundaries of the region of stable periods, that appears\npotentially useful in hydraulic engineering applications. In the asymptotic\nregime $F\\to 2$ (onset), we provide an analytic expression of the stability\nboundaries whereas in the limit $F\\to\\infty$, we show that roll-waves are\nalways unstable.\n", "  [Background] The proton charge radius extracted from recent muonic hydrogen\nLamb shift measurements is significantly smaller than that extracted from\natomic hydrogen and electron scattering measurements.\n  [Purpose] In an attempt to understand the discrepancy, we review\nhigh-precision electron scattering results from Mainz, Jefferson Lab, Saskatoon\nand Stanford.\n  [Method] We make use of stepwise regression techniques using the $F$-test as\nwell as the Akaike information criterion to systematically determine the\npredictive variables to use for a given set and range of electron scattering\ndata as well as to provide multivariate error estimates.\n  [Results] Starting with the precision, low four-momentum transfer ($Q^2$)\ndata from Mainz (1980) and Saskatoon (1974), we find that a stepwise regression\nof the Maclaurin series using the $F$-test as well as the Akaike information\ncriterion justify using a linear extrapolation which yields a value for the\nproton radius that is consistent with the result obtained from muonic hydrogen\nmeasurements. Applying the same Maclaurin series and statistical criteria to\nthe 2014 Rosenbluth results on $G_E$ from Mainz, we again find that the\nstepwise regression tends to favor a radius consistent with the muonic hydrogen\nradius but produces results that are extremely sensitive to the range of data\nincluded in the fit. Making use of the high-$Q^2$ data on $G_E$ to select\nfunctions which extrapolate to high $Q^2$, we find that a Pad\\'e ($N=M=1$)\nstatistical model works remarkably well, as does a dipole function with a 0.84\nfm radius, $G_E(Q^2) = ( 1 + Q^2/0.66\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^2)^{-2}$.\n  [Conclusions] From this statistical analysis, we conclude that the electron\nscattering result and the muonic hydrogen result are consistent. It is the\natomic hydrogen results that are the outliers.\n", "  Chiral-scale perturbation theory $\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$ has been proposed as an\nalternative to chiral $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R$ perturbation theory which\nexplains the $\\Delta I = 1/2$ rule for kaon decays. It is based on a low-energy\nexpansion about an infrared fixed point in three-flavor QCD. In\n$\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$, quark condensation $\\langle\\bar q q \\rangle_\\mathrm{vac}\n\\neq 0$ induces nine Nambu-Goldstone bosons: $\\pi, K, \\eta$ and a QCD dilaton\n$\\sigma$ which we identify with the $f_0(500)$ resonance. Partial conservation\nof the dilatation and chiral currents constrains low-energy constants which\nenter the effective Lagrangian of $\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$. These constraints allow us\nto obtain new phenomenological bounds on the dilaton decay constant via the\ncoupling of $\\sigma/f_0$ to pions, whose value is known precisely from\ndispersive analyses of $\\pi\\pi$ scattering. Improved predictions for $\\sigma\n\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ and the $\\sigma NN$ coupling are also noted. To test\n$\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$ for kaon decays, we revive a 1985 proposal for lattice\nmethods to be applied to $K \\to \\pi$ on-shell.\n", "  Supersymmetric Standard Models (SSMs) with Dirac gauginos have the appealing\nsupersoft property that they only cause finite contributions to scalar masses.\nConsidering gauge mediated SUSY breaking with conformal sequestering and\nassuming there is one and only one fundamental parameter with dimension mass\narising from supersymmetry breaking, we find a cancellation between the\ndominant terms that contribute to the EWFT. The resulting EWFT measure can be\nof order one even for supersymmetric particle masses and $\\mu$-terms in the TeV\nrange.\n", "  We introduce a method for calculating the dielectric function of\nnanostructures with an arbitrary band dispersion and Bloch wave functions. The\nlinear response of a dissipative electronic system to an external\nelectromagnetic field is calculated by a self-consistent-field approach within\na Markovian master equation formalism (SCF-MMEF) coupled with full-wave\nelectromagnetic equations. The SCF-MMEF accurately accounts for several\nconcurrent scattering mechanisms. The method captures interband\nelectron-hole-pair generation, as well as the interband and intraband electron\nscattering with phonons and impurities. We employ the SCF-MMEF to calculate the\ndielectric function, complex conductivity, and loss function for supported\ngraphene. From the loss-function maximum, we obtain plasmon dispersion and\npropagation length for different substrate types [nonpolar diamondlike carbon\n(DLC) and polar SiO$_2$ and hBN], impurity densities, carrier densities, and\ntemperatures. Plasmons on the two polar substrates are suppressed below the\nhighest surface phonon energy, while the spectrum is broad on the nonpolar DLC.\nPlasmon propagation lengths are comparable on polar and nonpolar substrates and\nare on the order of tens of nanometers, considerably shorter than previously\nreported. They improve with fewer impurities, at lower temperatures, and at\nhigher carrier densities.\n", "  We experimentally implement a system of cavity optomagnonics, where a sphere\nof ferromagnetic material supports whispering gallery modes (WGMs) for photons\nand the magnetostatic mode for magnons. We observe pronounced nonreciprocity\nand asymmetry in the sideband signals generated by the magnon-induced Brillouin\nscattering of light. The spin-orbit coupled nature of the WGM photons, their\ngeometric birefringence and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the magnon\ndynamics impose the angular-momentum selection rules in the scattering process\nand account for the observed phenomena. The unique features of the system may\nfind interesting applications at the crossroad between quantum optics and\nspintronics.\n", "  This paper puts forward a conjecture that there are no black holes in M\ntheory. We will show that a mechanism to prevent black hole formation is needed\nin 4 dimensions to make string theory a viable high energy model of quantum\ngravity. Black hole formation may be averted by a gravity regulation mechanism\nbased on string condensation. In this scenario, black holes are replaced by\n`hot holograms' that form during gravitational collapse. The geometric\nconditions based on the properties of free thermalon solutions that are\nproposed for conversion to a high temperature hologram to occur, however, are\nlocal and generic in dimension and could apply throughout M space. This idea\ncan be applied to resolve the problems presented by the process of black hole\nevaporation, which appears to be inconsistent with quantum information theory.\nWhereas, in the conventional view, black holes are real and firewalls are\nprobably a chimera, in the scenario proposed here that situation would be\nreversed.\n", "  Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family are gaining increasing\nimportance due to their unique electronic band structures, promising interplay\namong light, valley (pseudospin), charge and spin degrees of freedom. They\npossess large intrinsic spin-orbit interaction which make them most relevant\nfor the emerging field of spin-orbitronics. Here we report on the conversion of\nspin current to charge current in MoS2 monolayer. Using spin pumping from a\nferromagnetic layer (10 nm of cobalt) we find that the spin to charge\nconversion is highly efficient. Analysis in the frame of the inverse\nRashba-Edelstein (RE) effect yields a RE length in excess of 4 nm at room\ntemperature. Furthermore, owing to the semiconducting nature of MoS$_{2}$, it\nis found that back-gating allows electrical field control of the\nspin-relaxation rate of the MoS$_{2}$-metallic stack.\n", "  We describe experiments and associated quantum simulations involving the\nproduction of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$_{2}$ molecules with nanosecond pulses of\nfrequency-chirped light. With appropriate chirp parameters, the formation is\ndominated by coherent processes. For a positive chirp, excited molecules are\nproduced by photoassociation early in the chirp, then transferred into high\nvibrational levels of the lowest triplet state by stimulated emission later in\nthe chirp. Generally good agreement is seen between the data and the\nsimulations. Shaping of the chirp can lead to a significant enhancement of the\nformation rate. Further improvements using higher intensities and different\nintermediate states are predicted.\n", "  The detection of optical surface brightness structures in the sky with\nmagnitudes fainter than 30 mag/arcsec^2 (3sigma in 10x10 arcsec boxes; r-band)\nhas remained elusive in current photometric deep surveys. Here we show how\npresent-day 10 meter class telescopes can provide broadband imaging 1.5-2 mag\ndeeper than most previous results within a reasonable amount of time (i.e. <10h\non source integration). In particular, we illustrate the ability of the 10.4 m\nGran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) telescope to produce imaging with a limiting\nsurface brightness of 31.5 mag/arcsec^2 (3sigma in 10x10 arcsec boxes; r-band)\nusing 8.1 hours on source. We apply this power to explore the stellar halo of\nthe galaxy UGC00180, a galaxy analogous to M31 located at ~150 Mpc, by\nobtaining a surface brightness radial profile down to mu_r~33 mag/arcsec^2.\nThis depth is similar to that obtained using star counts techniques of Local\nGroup galaxies, but is achieved at a distance where this technique is\nunfeasible. We find that the mass of the stellar halo of this galaxy is ~4x10^9\nMsun, i.e. 3+-1% of the total stellar mass of the whole system. This amount of\nmass in the stellar halo is in agreement with current theoretical expectations\nfor galaxies of this kind.\n", "  Electrostatic gating provides a way to obtain key functionalities in modern\nelectronic devices and to qualitatively alter materials properties. While\nelectrostatic description of such gating gives guidance for related doping\neffects, inherent quantum properties of gating provide opportunities for\nintriguing modification of materials and unexplored devices. Using\nfirst-principles calculations for Co/bilayer graphene, Co/BN, and Co/benzene,\nas well as a simple physical model, we show that magnetic heterostructures with\ntwo-dimensional layered materials can manifest tunable magnetic proximity\neffects. van der Waals bonding is identified as a requirement for large\nelectronic structure changes by gating. In particular, the magnitude and sign\nof spin polarization in physisorbed graphene can be controlled by gating, which\nis important for spintronic devices.\n", "  The Earth's magnetic field is generated by dynamo action driven by convection\nin the outer core. For numerical reasons, inertial and viscous forces play an\nimportant role in geodynamo models; however, the primary dynamical balance in\nthe Earth's core is believed to be between buoyancy, Coriolis and magnetic\nforces. The hope has been that by setting the Ekman number to be as small as\ncomputationally feasible, an asymptotic regime would be reached in which the\ncorrect force balance is achieved. However, recent analyses of geodynamo models\nsuggest that the desired balance has still not yet been attained. Here we adopt\na complementary approach consisting of a model of rapidly rotating convection\nin which inertial forces are neglected from the outset. Within this framework\nwe are able to construct a new branch of solutions in which the dynamo\ngenerates a strong magnetic field that satisfies the expected force balance.\nThe resulting strongly magnetized convection is dramatically different to the\ncorresponding solutions in which the field is weak.\n", "  We revisit bulk FeSe through the systematic first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations. We find that there are a series of staggered $n$-mer\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) states with corresponding energies below that of the\ncollinear AFM state which is the ground state for the parent compounds of most\niron-based superconductors. Here the staggered $n$-mer ($n$ any integer $>1$)\nmeans that a set of $n$ adjacent spins parallel on a line along $b$-axis with\nspins in antiparallel between $n$-mers and along $a$-axis. Among them, the\nlowest energy states are quasi-degenerate staggered dimer and staggered trimer\nAFM states as well as their any staggered combinations. Thus, to have the\nlargest entropy to minimize the free energy at low temperature, the most\nfavorable state is such a quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet in which along\n$b$-axis a variety of $n$-mers, mostly dimers and trimers, are randomly\nantiparallel aligned while along $a$-axis spins are antiparallel aligned, i.e.\nactually a nematic paramagnet. This finding accounts well for the absence of\nlong-range magnetic order in bulk FeSe and meanwhile indicates the dominant\nstripe spin fluctuation and the nematicity as spin-driven.\n", "  We point out that the gamma-ray excesses in the galactic center and in the\ndwarf galaxy Reticulum II can both be well explained within the simplest dark\nmatter model. We find that the corresponding region of parameter space will be\ntested by direct and indirect dark matter searches in the near future.\n", "  The aim of this series of two papers is to discuss topological invariants for\ninteracting topological insulators (TIs). In the first paper (I), we provide a\nparadigm of efficient numerical evaluation scheme for topological invariants,\nin which we demystify the procedures and techniques employed in calculating Z2\ninvariant and spin Chern number via zero-frequency single-particle Green's\nfunction in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. Here we introduce a\nperiodization process to overcome the ubiquitous finite-size effect, so that\nthe calculated spin Chern number shows ideally quantized values. We also show\nthat making use of symmetry properties of the underlying systems can greatly\nreduce the computational effort. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nnumerical evaluation scheme, especially the periodization process, of\ntopological invariants, we apply it on two independent two-dimensional models\nof interacting topological insulators. In the subsequent paper (II), we apply\nthe scheme developed here to wider classes of models of interacting topological\ninsulators, for which certain limitation of constructing topological invariant\nvia single-particle Green's functions will be presented.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) hypothesis identifies the relevant time scales in\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics of critical systems employing concepts valid at\nequilibrium: It predicts the scaling of the defect formation immediately after\nquenches across classical and quantum phase transitions as a function of the\nquench speed. Here we study the crossover between the scaling dictated by a\nslow quench, which is ruled by the critical properties of the quantum phase\ntransition, and the excitations due to a faster quench, where the dynamics is\noften well described by the classical model. We estimate the value of the\nquench rate that separates the two regimes and support our argument using\nnumerical simulations of the out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics. For the\nspecific case of a $\\phi^4$ model we demonstrate that the two regimes exhibit\ntwo different power-law scalings, which are in agreement with the KZ theory\nwhen applied to the quantum and to the classical case. This result contributes\nto extending the prediction power of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism and to provide\ninsight into recent experimental observations in systems of cold atoms and\nions.\n", "  A study of the decay $D^{0}\\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is\nperformed using data collected by the LHCb detector in proton-proton collisions\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 2.0 fb$^{-1}$. Decay candidates with muon pairs that have an invariant mass\nin the range 675--875 MeV$/c^2$ are considered. This region is dominated by the\n$\\rho^{0}$ and $\\omega$ resonances. The branching fraction in this range is\nmeasured to be ${\\cal B}$($D^{0}\\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$) =\n$(4.17 \\pm 0.12(stat) \\pm 0.40(syst))\\times10^{-6}$. This is the first\nobservation of the decay $D^{0}\\rightarrow K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$. Its\nbranching fraction is consistent with the value expected in the Standard Model.\n", "  We prove a result concerning the spreading of weighted Fekete points in the\nplane.\n", "  Stable ultrashort light pulses and frequency combs generated by mode-locked\nlasers have many important applications including high-resolution spectroscopy,\nfast chemical detection and identification, studies of ultrafast processes, and\nlaser metrology. While compact mode-locked lasers emitting in the visible and\nnear infrared range have revolutionized photonic technologies, the systems\noperating in the mid-infrared range where most gases have their strong\nabsorption lines, are bulky and expensive and rely on nonlinear frequency\ndown-conversion. Quantum cascade lasers are the most powerful and versatile\ncompact light sources in the mid-infrared range, yet achieving their mode\nlocked operation remains a challenge despite dedicated effort. Here we report\nthe first demonstration of active mode locking of an external-cavity quantum\ncascade laser. The laser operates in the mode-locked regime at room temperature\nand over the full dynamic range of injection currents of a standard commercial\nlaser chip.\n", "  We show that the effective average action and its gradient are useful for\nsolving multiscale data assimilation problems. We also present a procedure for\nnumerically evaluating the gradient of the effective average action, and\ndemonstrate that the variational problem for slow degrees of freedom can be\nsolved properly using the \"effective gradient.\"\n", "  We propose a new concept for spectral characterization of transiting\nexoplanets with future space-based telescopes. This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror. The reliability of the observation result is also\nincreased by statistically treating them. Our numerical calculations show that,\nbecause this method suppresses the instrumental systematic errors down to 10\nppm under telescopes with modest pointing accuracy, next-generation space\ntelescopes with more than 2.5m diameter potentially provide opportunities to\ncharacterize temperate super-Earths around nearby late-type stars through the\ntransmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse.\n", "  Recent years have witnessed many exciting breakthroughs in neutrino physics.\nThe detection of neutrino oscillations has proved that neutrinos are massive\nparticles but the assessment of their absolute mass scale is still an\noutstanding challenge in today particle physics and cosmology. Since low\ntemperature detectors were first proposed for neutrino physics experiments in\n1984, there have been tremendous technical progresses: today this technique\noffers the high energy resolution and scalability required to perform\ncompetitive experiments challenging the lowest electron neutrino masses. This\npaper reviews the thirty-year effort aimed at realizing a calorimetric\nmeasurements with sub-eV neutrino mass sensitivity using low temperature\ndetectors.\n", "  We investigate an atomic ensemble of interacting bosons trapped in a\nsymmetric double well potential in contact with a single tightly trapped ion\nwhich has been recently proposed [R. Gerritsma et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,\n080402 (2012)] as a source of entanglement between a Bose-Einstein condensate\nand an ion. Compared to the previous study, the present work aims at performing\na detailed and accurate many-body analysis of such combined atomic quantum\nsystem by means of the ab-initio multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree\nmethod for bosons, which allows to take into account all correlations in the\nsystem. The analysis elucidates the importance of quantum correlations in the\nbosonic ensemble and reveals that entanglement generation between an ion and a\ncondensate is indeed possible, as previously predicted. Moreover, we provide an\nintuitive picture of the impact of the correlations on the out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics by employing a natural orbital analysis which we show to be indeed\nexperimentally verifiable.\n", "  The amazing possibility of magnetoelectric crystals to cross couple electric\nand magnetic properties without the need of time-dependent Maxwell's equations\nhas attracted a lot of interest in material science. This enthusiasm has\nre-emerged during the last decade where magnetoelectric and multiferroic\ncrystals have captivated a tremendous number of studies, mostly driven by the\nquest of low-power-consumption spintronic devices. While several new candidates\nhave been discovered, the desirable magnetoelectric coupling at room\ntemperature is still sparse and calls for new promising candidates. Here, we\nshow from first-principles studies that the troilite phase of the iron sulfide\nbased compounds, one of the most common mineral of Earth, Moon, Mars or\nmeteors, is magnetoelectric up to temperatures as high as 415 K.\n", "  We estimate the LGRB progenitor rate using our recent work on the effects of\nenvironmental metallically on LGRB formation in concert with SNe statistics via\nan approach patterned loosely off the Drake equation. Beginning with the cosmic\nstar-formation history, we consider the expected number of broad-line Type Ic\nevents (the SNe type associated with LGRBs) that are in low metallicity host\nenvironments adjusted by the contribution of high metallicity host environments\nat a much reduced rate. We then compare this estimate to the observed LGRB rate\ncorrected for instrumental selection effects to provide a combined estimate of\nthe efficiency fraction of these progenitors to produce LGRBs and the fraction\nof which are beamed in our direction. From this we estimate that an aligned\nLGRB occurs for approximately every 4000 low metallically broad-lined Type Ic\nSupernovae. Therefore if one assumes a semi-nominal beaming factor of 100 then\nonly about one such supernova out of 40 produce an LGRB. Finally we propose an\noff-axis LGRB search strategy of targeting for radio observation broad-line\nType Ic events that occur in low metallicity hosts.\n", "  We study the bulk entanglement of a series of gapped ground states of spin\nladders, representative of the Haldane phase. These ground states of spin $S/2$\nladders generalize the valence bond solid ground state. In the case of spin 1/2\nladders, we study a generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki and\nNersesyan-Tsvelik states and fully characterize the bulk entanglement\nHamiltonian. In the case of general spin $S$ we argue that in the Haldane phase\nthe bulk entanglement spectrum of a half integer ladder is either gapless or\npossess a degenerate ground state. For ladders with integer valued spin\nparticles, the generic bulk entanglement spectrum should have an entanglement\ngap. Finally, we give an example of a series of trivial states of higher spin\n$S>1$ in which the bulk entanglement Hamiltonian is critical, signaling that\nthe relation between topological states and a critical bulk entanglement\nHamiltonian is not unique to topological systems.\n", "  Ultracold polar molecules provide an excellent platform to study quantum\nmany-body spin dynamics, which has become accessible in the recently realized\nlow entropy quantum gas of polar molecules in an optical lattice. To obtain a\ndetailed understanding for the molecular formation process in the lattice, we\nprepare a density distribution where lattice sites are either empty or occupied\nby a doublon composed of a bosonic atom interacting with a fermionic atom. By\nletting this disordered, out-of-equilibrium system evolve from a well-defined\ninitial condition, we observe clear effects on pairing that arise from\ninter-species interactions, a higher partial wave Feshbach resonance, and\nexcited Bloch-band population. When only the lighter fermions are allowed to\ntunnel in the three-dimensional (3D) lattice, the system dynamics can be well\ndescribed by theory. However, in a regime where both fermions and bosons can\ntunnel, we encounter correlated dynamics that is beyond the current capability\nof numerical simulations. Furthermore, we show that we can probe the\nmicroscopic distribution of the atomic gases in the lattice by measuring the\ninelastic loss of doublons. These techniques realize tools that are generically\napplicable to heteronuclear diatomic systems in optical lattices and can shed\nlight on molecule production as well as dynamics of a Bose-Fermi mixture.\n", "  A detailed analytical inspection of light scattering by a particle with high\nrefractive index m+i\\kappa and small dissipative constant \\kappa is presented.\nWe have shown that there is a dramatic difference in the behavior of the\nelectromagnetic field within the particle (inner problem) and the scattered\nfield outside it (outer problem). With an increase in m at fix values of the\nother parameters, the field within the particle asymptotically converges to a\nperiodic function of m. The electric and magnetic type Mie resonances of\ndifferent orders overlap substantially. It may lead to a giant concentration of\nthe electromagnetic energy within the particle. At the same time, we\ndemonstrate that identical transformations of the solution for the outer\nproblem allow to present each partial scattered wave as a sum of two\npartitions. One of them corresponds to the m-independent wave, scattered by a\nperfectly reflecting particle and plays the role of a background, while the\nother is associated with the excitation of a sharply-m-dependent resonant Mie\nmode. The interference of the partitions brings about a typical asymmetric Fano\nprofile. The explicit expressions for the parameters of the Fano profile have\nbeen obtained \"from the first principles\" without any additional assumptions\nand/or fitting. In contrast to the inner problem, at an increase in m the\nresonant modes of the outer problem die out, and the scattered field converges\nto the universal, m-independent profile of the perfectly reflecting sphere.\nNumerical estimates of the discussed effects for a gallium phosphide particle\nare presented.\n", "  Using high resolution Cluster satellite observations, we show that the\nturbulent solar wind is populated by magnetic discontinuities at different\nscales, going from proton down to electron scales. The structure of these\nlayers resembles the Harris equilibrium profile in plasmas. Using a\nmulti-dimensional intermittency technique, we show that these structures are\nconnected through the scales. Supported by numerical simulations of magnetic\nreconnection, we show that observations are consistent with a scenario where\nmany current layers develop in turbulence, and where the outflow of these\nreconnection events are characterized by complex sub-proton networks of\nsecondary islands, in a self-similar way. The present work establishes that the\npicture of \"reconnection in turbulence\" and \"turbulent reconnection\",\nseparately invoked as ubiquitous, coexist in space plasmas.\n", "  We have constructed an actuator/encoder whose generated displacement is\ncontrolled through the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity. A compact,\n10-micrometer-range, digitally-controlled actuator executing frequency-coded\ndisplacement with picometer resolution is described. We consider this approach\nparticularly suitable for metrologic-precision scanning probe microscopy.\n", "  In this paper, we study the influence of an external magnetic field in\nholographic QCD models where the backreaction is modeled in via an appropriate\nchoice of the background metric. We add a phenomenological soft wall dilaton to\nincorporate better IR behavior (confinement). Elaborating on previous studies\nconducted by [JHEP 1505 (2015) 121], we first discuss the Hawking-Page\ntransition, the dual of the deconfinement transition, as a function of the\nmagnetic field. We confirm that the critical deconfinement temperature can drop\nwith the magnetic field. Secondly, we study the quark condensate\nholographically as a function of the applied magnetic field and demonstrate\nthat this model does not exhibit inverse magnetic catalysis at the level of the\nchiral transition. The quest for a holographic QCD model that qualitatively\ndescribes the inverse magnetic catalysis at finite temperature is thus still\nopen. Throughout this work, we pay special attention to the different\nholographic parameters and we attempt to fix them by making the link to genuine\nQCD as close as possible. This leads to several unanticipated and so far\noverlooked complications (such as the relevance of an additional length scale\nin the confined geometry) that we discuss in detail.\n", "  Nonlinear optical methods, such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering\n(CARS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), are able to perform label free\nimaging, with chemical bonds specificity. Here, we demonstrate that the use of\ncircularly polarized light allows to retrieve not only the chemical nature but\nalso the symmetry of the probed sample, in a single shot measurement. Our\nsymmetry-resolved scheme offers simple access to the local organization of\nvibrational bonds and as a result provides enhanced image contrast for\nanisotropic samples as well as an improved chemical selectivity. We quantify\nthe local organization of vibrational bonds on crystalline and biological\nsamples, thus providing new information not accessible by spontaneous Raman and\nSRS techniques. This work stands for a novel symmetry-resolved contrast in\nvibrational microscopy, with potential application in biological diagnostic.\n", "  Zigzag edges of graphene nanostructures host localized electronic states that\nare predicted to be spin-polarized. However, these edge states are highly\nsusceptible to edge roughness and interaction with a supporting substrate,\ncomplicating the study of their intrinsic electronic and magnetic structure.\nHere, we focus on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons whose two short\nzigzag edges host exactly one localized electron each. Using the tip of a\nscanning tunneling microscope, the graphene nanoribbons are transferred from\nthe metallic growth substrate onto insulating islands of NaCl in order to\ndecouple their electronic structure from the metal. The absence of charge\ntransfer and hybridization with the substrate is confirmed by scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (STS), which reveals a pair of occupied / unoccupied\nedge states. Their large energy splitting of 1.9 eV is in accordance with ab\ninitio many-body perturbation theory calculations and reflects the dominant\nrole of electron-electron interactions in these localized states.\n", "  Many systems are naturally represented by a multilayer network in which edges\nexist in multiple layers that encode different, but potentially related, types\nof interactions, and it is important to understand limitations on the\ndetectability of community structure in these networks. Using random matrix\ntheory, we analyze detectability limitations for multilayer (specifically,\nmultiplex) stochastic block models (SBMs) in which L layers are derived from a\ncommon SBM. We study the effect of layer aggregation on detectability for\nseveral aggregation methods, including summation of the layers' adjacency\nmatrices for which we show the detectability limit vanishes as O(L^{-1/2}) with\nincreasing number of layers, L. Importantly, we find a similar scaling behavior\nwhen the summation is thresholded at an optimal value, providing insight into\nthe common - but not well understood - practice of thresholding\npairwise-interaction data to obtain sparse network representations.\n", "  Co-evolutionary adaptive mechanisms are not only ubiquitous in nature, but\nalso beneficial for the functioning of a variety of systems. We here consider\nan adaptive network of oscillators with a stochastic, fitness-based, rule of\nconnectivity, and show that it self-organizes from fragmented and incoherent\nstates to connected and synchronized ones. The synchronization and percolation\nare associated to abrupt transitions, and they are concurrently (and\nsignificantly) enhanced as compared to the non-adaptive case. Finally we\nprovide evidence that only partial adaptation is sufficient to determine these\nenhancements. Our study, therefore, indicates that inclusion of simple adaptive\nmechanisms can efficiently describe some emergent features of networked\nsystems' collective behaviors, and suggests also self-organized ways to control\nsynchronization and percolation in natural and social systems.\n", "  We present a study of the cataclysmic variable star PT Per based on archival\nXMM-Newton X-ray data and new optical spectroscopy from the WHT with ISIS. The\nX-ray data show deep minima which recur at a period of 82 minutes and a hard,\nunabsorbed X-ray spectrum. The optical spectra of PT Per show a relatively\nfeatureless blue continuum. From an analysis of the X-ray and optical data we\nconclude that PT Per is likely to be a magnetic cataclysmic variable of the\npolar class in which the minima correspond to those phase intervals when the\naccretion column rotates out of the field of view of the observer. We suggest\nthat the optical spectrum, obtained around 4 years after the X-ray coverage, is\ndominated by the white dwarf in the system, implying that PT Per was in a low\naccretion state at the time of the observations. An analysis of the likely\nsystem parameters for PT Per suggests a distance of $\\approx90$ pc and a very\nlow-mass secondary, consistent with the idea that PT Per is a \"period-bounce\"\nbinary.\n", "  A quantum two-state system, weakly coupled to a heat bath, is traditionally\nstudied in the Born-Markov regime under the secular approximation with\ncompletely positive linear master equations. Despite its success, this\nmicroscopic approach exclusively predicts exponential decays and Lorentzian\nsusceptibility profiles, in disagreement with a number of experimental\nfindings. To leave this limited paradigm, we use a phenomenological positive\nnonlinear master equation being both thermodynamically and statistically\nconsistent. We find that, beyond a temperature-dependent threshold, a\nbifurcation in the decoherence time $T_2$ takes place; it gives rise to a\nbiexponential decay and a susceptibility profile being neither Gaussian nor\nLorentzian. This implies that, for suitable initial states, a major\nprolongation of the coherence can be obtained in agreement with recent\nexperiments. Moreover, $T_2$ is no longer limited by the energy relaxation time\n$T_1$ offering novel perspectives to elaborate devices for quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  In this paper, at first, we focus on a FRW universe in which the dark energy\ncandidate satisfies the Polytropic equation of state and study thermodynamics\nof dark energy. Bearing the thermal fluctuation theorem in mind, we establish a\nrelation between the thermal fluctuation of system and mutual interaction\nbetween the dark energy and dark matter. Generalization to a viscous Polytropic\ngas is also investigated. We point to a condition for decaying dark energy\ncandidate into the dark matter needed for alleviating coincidence problem. The\neffects of dark energy candidates and their interactions with other parts of\ncosmos on the horizon entropy as well as the second law of thermodynamics are\nalso addressed. Our study signals us to a correction term besides the\nBekenstein entropy which carries the information of the dark energy candidate,\nits interaction with other parts of cosmos and its viscosity.\n", "  Symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) phases of matter are the product-state\nanalogue of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. This means, SPt phases\ncan be adiabatically connected to a product state by some path that preserves\nthe protecting symmetry. Moreover, SPt and SPT phases can be adiabatically\nconnected to each other when interaction terms that break the symmetries\nprotecting the SPT order are added in the Hamiltonian. It is also known that\nspin-1 SPT phases in quantum spin chains can emerge as effective intermediate\nphases of spin-2 Hamiltonians. In this paper we show that a similar scenario is\nalso valid for SPt phases. More precisely, we show that for a given spin-2\nquantum chain, effective intermediate spin-1 SPt phases emerge in some regions\nof the phase diagram, these also being adiabatically connected to non-trivial\nintermediate SPT phases. We characterize the phase diagram of our model by\nstudying quantities such as the entanglement entropy, symmetry-related order\nparameters, and 1-site fidelities. Our numerical analysis uses Matrix Product\nStates (MPS) and the infinite Time-Evolving Block Decimation (iTEBD) method to\napproximate ground states of the system in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,\nwe provide a field theory description of the possible quantum phase transitions\nbetween the SPt phases. Together with the numerical results, such a description\nshows that the transitions may be described by Conformal Field Theories (CFT)\nwith central charge c=1. Our results are in agreement, and further generalize,\nthose in [Y. Fuji, F. Pollmann, M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 177204\n(2015)].\n", "  The protocol for counterfactual transmission of a qubit [Li et al., Phys.\nRev. A 92, 052315 (2015)] relies on the counterfactuality of transmissions of\nbit 1 and of bit 0. Since counterfactuality of transmission of bit 0 is not\nestablished, the claim of counterfactuality of transmission of a quantum state\nis not founded.\n", "  The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a cornerstone of modern condensed matter\ntheory. Developed for interacting electrons in solids, which typically exhibit\nSU($2$) symmetry, it describes a wide range of phenomena, such as metal to\ninsulator transitions and magnetic order. Its generalized SU($N$)-symmetric\nform, originally applied to multi-orbital materials such as transition-metal\noxides, has recently attracted much interest owing to the availability of\nultracold SU($N$)-symmetric atomic gases. Here we report on a detailed\nexperimental investigation of the SU($N$)-symmetric FHM using local probing of\nan atomic gas of ytterbium in an optical lattice to determine the equation of\nstate through different interaction regimes. We prepare a low-temperature\nSU($N$)-symmetric Mott insulator and characterize the Mott crossover,\nrepresenting important steps towards probing predicted novel SU($N$)-magnetic\nphases.\n", "  We present a first-principles-based (second-principles) scheme that permits\nlarge-scale materials simulations including both atomic and electronic degrees\nof freedom on the same footing. The method is based on a predictive\nquantum-mechanical theory, e.g., Density Functional Theory, and its accuracy\ncan be systematically improved at a very modest computational cost. Our\napproach is based on dividing the electron density of the system into a\nreference part - typically corresponding to the system's neutral,\ngeometry-dependent ground state - and a deformation part - defined as the\ndifference between the actual and reference densities. We then take advantage\nof the fact that the bulk part of the system's energy depends on the reference\ndensity alone; this part can be efficiently and accurately described by a force\nfield, thus avoiding explicit consideration of the electrons. Then, the effects\nassociated to the difference density can be treated perturbatively with good\nprecision by working in a suitably chosen Wannier function basis. Further, the\nelectronic model can be restricted to the bands of interest. All these features\ncombined yield a very flexible and computationally very efficient scheme. Here\nwe present the basic formulation of this approach, as well as a practical\nstrategy to compute model parameters for realistic materials. We illustrate the\naccuracy and scope of the proposed method with two case studies, namely, the\nrelative stability of various spin arrangements in NiO and the formation of a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas at the interface between band insulators LaAlO$_3$\nand SrTiO$_3$. We conclude by discussing ways to overcome the limitations of\nthe present approach (most notably, the assumption of a fixed bonding\ntopology), as well as its many envisioned possibilities and future extensions.\n", "  Linear response theory, the backbone of non-equilibrium statistical physics,\nhas recently been extended to explain how and why non-ergodic renewal processes\nare insensitive to simple perturbations, such as in habituation. It was\nestablished that a permanent correlation resulted between an external stimulus\nand the response of a complex system generating non-ergodic renewal processes,\nwhen the stimulus is a similar non-ergodic process. This is the principle of\ncomplexity management, whose proof relies on ensemble distribution functions.\nHerein we extend the proof to the non-ergodic case using time averages and a\nsingle time series, hence making it usable in real life situations where\nensemble averages cannot be performed because of the very nature of the complex\nsystems being studied.\n", "  The mass of a star is arguably its most fundamental parameter. For red giant\nstars, tracers luminous enough to be observed across the Galaxy, mass implies a\nstellar evolution age. It has proven to be extremely difficult to infer ages\nand masses directly from red giant spectra using existing methods. From the\nKEPLER and APOGEE surveys, samples of several thousand stars exist with\nhigh-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses. Here we show that from these\ndata we can build a data-driven spectral model using The Cannon, which can\ndetermine stellar masses to $\\sim$ 0.07 dex from APOGEE DR12 spectra of red\ngiants; these imply age estimates accurate to $\\sim$ 0.2 dex (40 percent). We\nshow that The Cannon constrains these ages foremost from spectral regions with\nCN absorption lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent\ndredge-up. We deliver an unprecedented catalog of 80,000 giants (including\n20,000 red-clump stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning the entire disk\n(from the Galactic center to R $\\sim$ 20 kpc). We show that the age information\nin the spectra is not simply a corollary of the birth-material abundances\n[Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe], and that even within a mono-abundance population of\nstars, there are age variations that vary sensibly with Galactic position. Such\nstellar age constraints across the Milky Way open up new avenues in Galactic\narcheology.\n", "  Liquid noble based particle detectors often use the organic wavelength\nshifter 1,1,4,4- tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) which shifts UV scintillation\nlight to the visible regime, facilitating its detection, but which also can\nscintillate on its own. Dark matter searches based on this type of detector\ncommonly rely on pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) for background mitigation.\nAlpha-induced scintillation therefore represents a possible background source\nin dark matter searches. The timing characteristics of this scintillation\ndetermine whether this background can be mitigated through PSD. We have\ntherefore characterized the pulse shape and light yield of alpha induced TPB\nscintillation at temperatures ranging from 300 K down to 4 K, with special\nattention given to liquid noble gas temperatures. We find that the pulse shapes\nand light yield depend strongly on temperature. In addition, the significant\ncontribution of long time constants above ~50 K provides an avenue for\ndiscrimination between alpha decay events in TPB and nuclear-recoil events in\nnoble liquid detectors.\n", "  During the processes of nucleation and growth of a precipitate cluster from a\nsupersaturated solution, the diffusion flux between the cluster and the\nsolution changes the solute concentration near the cluster-solution interface\nfrom its average bulk value. This feature affects the rates of attachment and\ndetachment of solute atoms at the interface and, therefore, alters the entire\nnucleation kinetics. Unless quite obvious, this effect has been ignored in the\nclassical nucleation theory. To illustrate the results of this new approach,\nfor the case of homogeneous nucleation, we calculate the total solubility\n(including the contribution from heterophase fluctuations) and the nucleation\nrate as functions of two parameters of the model and compare these results to\nthe classical ones. One can conclude that discrepancies with the classical\nnucleation theory are great in the diffusion-limited regime, when the bulk\ndiffusion mobility of solute atoms is small compared to the interfacial one,\nwhile in the opposite interface-limited case they vanish.\n", "  Motivated by casting of fresh concrete in reinforced concrete structures, we\nintroduce a numerical model of a steady-state non-Newtonian fluid flow through\na porous domain. Our approach combines homogenization techniques to represent\nthe reinforced domain by the Darcy law with an interface coupling of the Stokes\nand Darcy flows through the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions. The ensuing\ntwo-scale problem is solved by the Finite Element Method with consistent\nlinearization and the results obtained from the homogenization approach are\nverified against fully resolved direct numerical simulations.\n", "  The highly controllable ultracold atoms in a one-dimensional (1D) trap\nprovide a new platform for the ultimate simulation of quantum magnetism. In\nthis regard, the Neel-antiferromagnetism and the itinerant ferromagnetism are\nof central importance and great interest. Here we show that these magnetic\norders can be achieved in the strongly interacting spin-1/2 trapped Fermi gases\nwith additional p-wave interactions. In this strong coupling limit, the 1D\ntrapped Fermi gas exhibit an effective Heisenberg spin XXZ chain in the\nanisotropic p-wave scattering channels. For a particular p-wave attraction or\nrepulsion within the same species of fermionic atoms, the system displays\nferromagnetic domains with full spin segregation or the anti-ferromagnetic spin\nconfiguration in the ground state. Such engineered magnetisms are likely to be\nprobed in a quasi-1D trapped Fermi gas of $^{40}$ K atoms with very close\ns-wave and p-wave Feshbach resonances.\n", "  It is of interest to find criteria on a 2d CFT which indicate that it gives\nrise to emergent gravity in a macroscopic 3d AdS space via holography.\nSymmetric orbifolds in the large $N$ limit have partition functions which are\nconsistent with an emergent space-time string theory with $L_{\\rm string} \\sim\nL_{\\rm AdS}$. For supersymmetric CFTs, the elliptic genus can serve as a\nsensitive probe of whether the SCFT admits a large radius gravity description\nwith $L_{\\rm string} \\ll L_{\\rm AdS}$ after one deforms away from the symmetric\norbifold point in moduli space. We discuss several classes of constructions\nwhose elliptic genera strongly hint that gravity with $L_{\\rm Planck} \\ll\nL_{\\rm string} \\ll L_{\\rm AdS}$ can emerge at suitable points in moduli space.\n", "  Currently, 19 transiting exoplanets have published transmission spectra\nobtained with the Hubble/WFC3 G141 near-IR grism. Using this sample, we have\nundertaken a uniform analysis incorporating measurement-error debiasing of the\nspectral modulation due to H$_{2}$O, measured in terms of the estimated\natmospheric scale height, ${H_s}$. For those planets with a reported H$_{2}$O\ndetection (10 out of 19), the spectral modulation due to H$_{2}$O ranges from\n0.9 to 2.9~${H_s}$ with a mean value of 1.8~$\\pm$~0.5~${H_s}$. This spectral\nmodulation is significantly less than predicted for clear atmospheres. For the\ngroup of planets in which H$_{2}$O has been detected, we find the individual\nspectra can be coherently averaged to produce a characteristic spectrum in\nwhich the shape, together with the spectral modulation of the sample, are\nconsistent with a range of H$_{2}$O mixing ratios and cloud-top pressures, with\na minimum H$_{2}$O mixing ratio of 17~$^{+12}_{-6}$~ppm corresponding to the\ncloud-free case. Using this lower limit, we show that clouds or aerosols must\nblock at least half of the atmospheric column that would otherwise be sampled\nby transmission spectroscopy in the case of a cloud-free atmosphere. We\nconclude that terminator-region clouds, with sufficient opacity to be opaque in\nslant-viewing geometry, are common in hot Jupiters.\n", "  We revisit the problem of perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_4$ black holes\nby using a combination of the Martel-Poisson formalism for perturbations of\nfour-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes and the Kodama-Ishibashi\nformalism. We clarify the relationship between both formalisms and express the\nBrown-York-Balasubramanian-Krauss boundary stress-energy tensor,\n$\\bar{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$, on a finite-$r$ surface purely in terms of the even and odd\nmaster functions. Then, on these surfaces we find that the spacelike components\nof the conservation equation $\\bar{\\mathcal{D}}^\\mu \\bar{T}_{\\mu\\nu} =0$ are\nequivalent to the wave equations for the master functions. The renormalized\nstress-energy tensor at the boundary $\\displaystyle \\frac{r}{L} \\lim_{r\n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\bar{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is calculated directly in terms of the\nmaster functions.\n", "  We present galaxy velocity dispersions and dynamical mass estimates for 44\ngalaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect by the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope. Dynamical masses for 18 clusters are reported here for the\nfirst time. Using \\Nbody\\ simulations, we model the different observing\nstrategies used to measure the velocity dispersions and account for systematic\neffects resulting from these strategies. We find that the galaxy velocity\ndistributions may be treated as isotropic, and that an aperture correction of\nup to 7 per cent in the velocity dispersion is required if the spectroscopic\ngalaxy sample is sufficiently concentrated towards the cluster centre.\nAccounting for the radial profile of the velocity dispersion in simulations\nenables consistent dynamical mass estimates regardless of the observing\nstrategy. Cluster masses $M_{200}$ are in the range\n$(1-15)\\times10^{14}M_\\odot$. Comparing with masses estimated from the SZ\ndistortion assuming a gas pressure profile derived from X-ray observations\ngives a mean SZ-to-dynamical mass ratio of $1.10\\pm0.13$, but there is an\nadditional 0.14 systematic uncertainty due to the unknown velocity bias; the\nstatistical uncertainty is dominated by the scatter in the mass-velocity\ndispersion scaling relation. This ratio is consistent with previous\ndeterminations at these mass scales.\n", "  Working within the stochastic series expansion framework, we introduce and\ncharacterize a new quantum cluster algorithm for quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations of transverse field Ising models with frustrated Ising exchange\ninteractions. As a demonstration of the capabilities of this new algorithm, we\nshow that a relatively small, ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour coupling\ndrives the transverse field Ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice\nfrom an antiferromagnetic three-sublattice ordered state at low temperature to\na ferrimagnetic three-sublattice ordered state.\n", "  There are several plasma models intermediate in complexity between ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and two-fluid theory, with Hall and Extended MHD\nbeing two important examples. In this paper we investigate several aspects of\nthese theories, with the ultimate goal of deriving the noncanonical Poisson\nbrackets used in their Hamiltonian formulations. We present fully Lagrangian\nactions for each, as opposed to the fully Eulerian, or mixed\nEulerian-Lagrangian, actions that have appeared previously. As an important\nstep in this process we exhibit each theory's two advected fluxes (in analogy\nto ideal MHD's advected magnetic flux), discovering also that with the correct\nchoice of gauge they have corresponding Lie-dragged potentials resembling the\nelectromagnetic vector potential, and associated conserved helicities. Finally,\nusing the Euler-Lagrange map, we show how to derive the noncanonical Eulerian\nbrackets from canonical Lagrangian ones.\n", "  The structural human connectome (i.e.\\ the network of fiber connections in\nthe brain) can be analyzed at ever finer spatial resolution thanks to advances\nin neuroimaging. Here we analyze several large data sets for the human brain\nnetwork made available by the Open Connectome Project. We apply statistical\nmodel selection to characterize the degree distributions of graphs containing\nup to $\\simeq 10^6$ nodes and $\\simeq 10^8$ edges. A three-parameter\ngeneralized Weibull (also known as a stretched exponential) distribution is a\ngood fit to most of the observed degree distributions. For almost all networks,\nsimple power laws cannot fit the data, but in some cases there is statistical\nsupport for power laws with an exponential cutoff. We also calculate the\ntopological (graph) dimension $D$ and the small-world coefficient $\\sigma$ of\nthese networks. While $\\sigma$ suggests a small-world topology, we found that\n$D < 4$ showing that long-distance connections provide only a small correction\nto the topology of the embedding three-dimensional space.\n", "  Low-field magnetotransport measurements of topological insulators such as\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ are important for revealing the nature of topological surface\nstates by quantum corrections to the conductivity, such as\nweak-antilocalization. Recently, a rich variety of high-field magnetotransport\nproperties in the regime of high electron densities ($\\sim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nwere reported, which can be related to additional two-dimensional layered\nconductivity, hampering the identification of the topological surface states.\nHere, we report that quantum corrections to the electronic conduction are\ndominated by the surface states for a semiconducting case, which can be\nanalyzed by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model for two coupled surfaces in the\ncase of strong spin-orbit interaction. However, in the metallic-like case this\nanalysis fails and additional two-dimensional contributions need to be\naccounted for. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and quantized Hall resistance\nprove as strong indications for the two-dimensional layered metallic behavior.\nTemperature-dependent magnetotransport properties of high-quality Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nsingle crystalline exfoliated macro and micro flakes are combined with high\nresolution transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray\nspectroscopy, confirming the structure and stoichiometry. Angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy proves a single-Dirac-cone surface state and a\nwell-defined bulk band gap in topological insulating state. Spatially resolved\ncore-level photoelectron microscopy demonstrates the surface stability.\n", "  The photoelectron momentum shifts along the laser propagation are\ninvestigated by the time-dependent perturbation theory for diatomic molecules,\nsuch as H$_2^+$, N$_2$ and O$_2$. Such longitudinal momentum shifts\ncharacterize the photon momentum sharing in atoms and molecules, and oscillate\nwith respect to photon energies, presenting the double-slit interference\nstructure. The atomic and molecular contributions are disentangled\nanalytically, which gives intuitive picture how the double-slit interference\nstructure is formed. Calculation results show the longitudinal photoelectron\nmomentum distribution depends on the internuclear distance, molecular\norientation and photon energy. The current laser technology is ready to approve\nthese theoretical predictions.\n", "  Topological phase transitions in free fermion systems can be characterized by\nclosing of single-particle gap and change in topological invariants. However,\nin the presence of electronic interactions, topological phase transitions are\nmore complicated. In paper I of this series (arXiv:1510.07816), we have\ndeveloped an efficient scheme to evaluate the topological invariants based on\nGreen's function formalism. Here, in paper II, we demonstrate four\ninteraction-drive topological phase transitions (TPTs) in two-dimensional (2D)\ninteracting topological insulators (TIs) via large-scale quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) simulations, based on the scheme of evaluating topological invariants\npresented in paper I. Across these transitions, the defining symmetries of the\nTIs have been neither explicitly nor spontaneously broken. In the first two\nmodels, the topological invariants calculated from Green's function formalism\nsucceed in characterizing interaction-driven TPTs. However, in the second two\nmodels, we find single-particle gap does not close and the topological\ninvariants constructed from single-particle Green's function acquire no change\nacross the TPTs. Unexpected breakdown of the Green's function formalism in\nconstructing topological invariants is thus discovered. We thence classify the\nTPTs in interacting TIs into two categories: those have noninteracting\ncorrespondence can be characterized successfully by the topological invariants\nconstructed from Green's functions, while for the others that do not have\nnoninteracting correspondence, the Green's function formalism experiences a\nbreakdown but more interesting and exciting phenomena, such as emergent\ncollective critical modes at the transition, arise. Discussion on the success\nand breakdown of topological invariants constructed from the Green's function\nformalism in the context of symmetry protected topological (SPT) states is\npresented.\n", "  By using AMR cosmological hydrodynamic N-body zoom-in simulations, with the\nRAMSES code, we studied the mass transport processes onto galactic nuclei from\nhigh redshift up to $z\\sim6$. Due to the large dynamical range of the\nsimulations we were able to study the mass accretion process on scales from\n$\\sim50[kpc]$ to $\\sim$ few $1[pc]$. We studied the BH growth on to the\ngalactic center in relation with the mass transport processes associated to\nboth the Reynolds stress and the gravitational stress on the disc. Such\nmethodology allowed us to identify the main mass transport process as a\nfunction of the scales of the problem. We found that in simulations that\ninclude radiative cooling and SNe feedback, the SMBH grows at the Eddington\nlimit for some periods of time presenting $\\langle f_{EDD}\\rangle\\approx 0.5$\nthroughout its evolution. The $\\alpha$ parameter is dominated by the Reynolds\nterm, $\\alpha_R$, with $\\alpha_R\\gg 1$. The gravitational part of the $\\alpha$\nparameter, $\\alpha_G$, has an increasing trend toward the galactic center at\nhigher redshifts, with values $\\alpha_G\\sim 1$ at radii <$\\sim$ few $ 10^1[pc]$\ncontributing to the BH fueling. In terms of torques, we also found that gravity\nhas an increasing contribution toward the galactic center at earlier epochs\nwith a mixed contribution above $\\sim 100 [pc]$. This complementary work\nbetween pressure gradients and gravitational potential gradients allows an\nefficient mass transport on the disc with average mass accretion rates of the\norder $\\sim$ few $1 [M_{\\odot}/yr]$. These level of SMBH accretion rates found\nin our cosmological simulations are needed in all models of SMBH growth that\nattempt to explain the formation of redshift $6-7$ quasars.\n", "  The self-organization of active particles is governed by their dynamic\neffective interactions. Such interactions are controlled by the medium in which\nsuch active agents reside. Here, we study the interactions between active\nagents in a dense non-active medium. Our system consists of actuated spinning\n(active) particles embedded in a dense monolayer of passive (non-active)\nparticles. We demonstrate that the presence of the passive monolayer alters\ndramatically the properties of the system and results in a reversal of the\nforces between active spinning particles from repulsive to attractive. The\norigin of such reversal is due to the coupling between the active stresses and\nelasticity of the system. This discovery provides a new mechanism for the\ninteraction between active agents in complex and structured media, opening up\nnew opportunities to tune the interaction range and directionality via the\nmechanical properties of the medium.\n", "  We explore the co-evolution of the specific angular momentum of dark matter\nhaloes and the cold baryons that comprise the galaxies within. We study over\ntwo thousand central galaxies within the reference cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation of the \"Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments\"\n(EAGLE) project. We employ a methodology within which the evolutionary history\nof a system is specified by the time-evolving properties of the Lagrangian\nparticles that define it at z=0. We find a strong correlation between the\nevolution of the specific angular momentum of today's stars (cold gas) and that\nof the inner (whole) dark matter halo they are associated with. This link is\nparticularly strong for the stars formed before the epoch of maximum expansion\nand subsequent collapse of the central dark matter halo (turnaround). Spheroids\nare typically assembled primarily from stars formed prior to turnaround, and\nare therefore destined to suffer a net loss of angular momentum associated with\nthe strong merging activity during the assembly of the inner dark matter halo.\nStellar discs retain their specific angular momentum since they are comprised\nof stars formed mainly after turnaround, from gas that mostly preserves the\nhigh specific angular momentum it acquired by tidal torques during the linear\ngrowth of the halo. Since the specific angular momentum loss of the stars is\ntied to the galaxy's morphology today, it may be possible to use our results to\npredict, statistically, the assembly history of a halo given the morphology of\nthe galaxy it hosts.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of a doubly\ncharged scalar which may belong to different uncoloured scalar multiplets. This\ndoubly charged scalar couples to the charged leptons as well as gauge bosons,\nwhich we parametrize in a model independent way. Restricting ourselves in the\nregime of conserved charged-parity (CP), we assume only a few non-zero Yukawa\ncouplings ($y_{\\mu \\ell}$, where $\\ell=e,\\mu,\\tau$) between the doubly charged\nscalar and the charged leptons. Our choices allow the doubly charged scalar to\nimpinge low-energy processes like anomalous magnetic moment of muon and a few\npossible charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) processes. These same Yukawa\ncouplings are also instrumental in producing same-sign dilepton signatures at\nthe LHC. In this article we examine the impact of individual contributions from\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal Yukawa couplings in the light of muon $(g-2)$\nexcess. Subsequently, we use the derived information to inquire the possible\nCLFV processes and finally the collider signals from the decay of a doubly\ncharged scalar. Our simplified analyses, depending on the mass of doubly\ncharged scalar, provide a good estimate for the magnitude of the concerned\nYukawa couplings. Our findings would appear resourceful to test the\nphenomenological significance of a doubly charged scalar by using complementary\ninformation from muon $(g-2)$, CLFV and the collider experiments.\n", "  Polarization observables in neutron-deuteron scattering are calculated to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$) in pionless\neffective field theory ($\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$). At\n$\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$ the two-body $P$-wave contact interactions are\nfound to be important contributions to the neutron vector analyzing power,\n$A_{y}(\\theta)$, and the deuteron vector analyzing power, $iT_{11}(\\theta)$.\nExtracting the two-body $P$-wave $\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$ coefficients from\ntwo-body scattering data and varying them within the expected\n$\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$ theoretical errors provides results that are\nconsistent (at the $\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$ level) with $A_y$ experimental\ndata at low energies. Cutoff dependence of the $\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$\ncorrection of the doublet $S$-wave $nd$ scattering amplitude suggests the need\nfor a new three-body force at $\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$, which is likely one\nthat mixes Wigner- symmetric and Wigner-antisymmetric three-body channels.\n", "  A new model of collusions in an organization is proposed. Each actor\n$a_{i=1,\\cdots,N}$ disposes one unique good $g_{j=1,\\cdots,N}$. Each actor\n$a_i$ has also a list of other goods which he/she needs, in order from desired\nmost to those desired less. Finally, each actor $a_i$ has also a list of other\nagents, initially ordered at random. The order in the last list means the order\nof the access of the actors to the good $g_j$. A pair after a pair of agents\ntries to make a transaction. This transaction is possible if each of two actors\ncan be shifted upwards in the list of actors possessed by the partner. Our\nnumerical results indicate, that the average time of evolution scales with the\nnumber $N$ of actors approximately as $N^{2.9}$. For each actor, we calculate\nthe Kendall's rank correlation between the order of desired goods and actor's\nplace at the lists of the good's possessors. We also calculate individual\nutility funcions $\\eta_i$, where goods are weighted according to how strongly\nthey are desired by an actor $a_i$, and how easily they can be accessed by\n$a_i$. Although the individual utility functions can increase or decrease in\nthe time course, its value averaged over actors and independent simulations\ndoes increase in time. This means that the system of collusions is profitable\nfor the members of the organization.\n", "  We present a novel dark matter candidate, an Elastically Decoupling Relic\n(ELDER), which is a cold thermal relic whose present abundance is determined by\nthe cross-section of its elastic scattering on Standard Model particles. The\ndark matter candidate is predicted to have a mass ranging from a few to a few\nhundred MeV, and an elastic scattering cross-section with electrons, photons\nand/or neutrinos in the $10^{-3}-1$ fb range.\n", "  We observe evidence of first-order superfluid to Mott-insulator quantum phase\ntransitions in a lattice-confined antiferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. The observed signatures include hysteresis effect and significant\nheatings across the phase transitions. The nature of the phase transitions is\nfound to strongly depend on the ratio of the quadratic Zeeman energy to the\nspin-dependent interaction. Our observations are qualitatively understood by\nthe mean field theory, and in addition suggest tuning the quadratic Zeeman\nenergy is a new approach to realize superfluid to Mott-insulator phase\ntransitions.\n", "  A new scenario for gravitational collapse has been recently proposed by\nHaggard and Rovelli. Presenting the model under the name of black hole\nfireworks, they claim that the accumulation of quantum gravitational effects\noutside the horizon can cause the tunneling of geometry from a black hole to a\nwhite hole, allowing a bounce of the collapsing star which can eventually go\nback to infinity. In this paper we discuss the instabilities of this model and\npropose a simple minimal modification which eliminates them, as well as other\nrelated instabilities discussed in the literature. The new scenario is a\ntime-asymmetric version of the original model with a time-scale for the final\nexplosion that is shorter than m log m in Planck units. Our analysis highlights\nthe importance of irreversibility in gravitational collapse which, in turn,\nuncovers important issues that cannot be addressed in detail without a full\nquantum gravity treatment.\n", "  We study the effect of scalar leptoquarks in the lepton flavour violating $B$\nmeson decays induced by the flavour changing transitions $b \\to q l_i^+ l_j^-$\nwith $q=s,d$. In the standard model these transitions are extremely rare as\nthey are either two-loop suppressed or proceed via box diagrams with tiny\nneutrino masses in the loop. However, in the leptoquark model they can occur at\ntree level and are expected to have significantly large branching ratios. The\nleptoquark parameter space is constrained using the experimental limits on the\nbranching ratios of $B_q \\rightarrow l^+ l^-$ processes. Using such constrained\nparameter space, we predict the branching ratios of LFV semileptonic $B$ meson\ndecays, such as $B^+ \\to K^+ (\\pi^+) l_i^+ l_j^-$, $B^+ \\to (K^{* +}, \\rho^+)\nl_i^+ l_j^-$ and $B_s \\to \\phi l_i^+ l_j^-$, which are found to be within the\nexperimental reach of LHCb and the upcoming Belle II experiments. We also\ninvestigate the rare leptonic $K_{L, S} \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- (e^+ e^-)$ and $K_{L}\n\\to \\mu^\\mp e^\\pm$ decays in the leptoquark model.\n", "  We consider conditions under which photonic crystals (PCs) can be homogenized\nin the higher photonic bands and, in particular, near the $\\Gamma$-point. By\nhomogenization we mean introducing some effective local parameters\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\mu_{\\rm eff}$ that describe reflection, refraction\nand propagation of electromagnetic waves in the PC adequately. The parameters\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\mu_{\\rm eff}$ can be associated with a hypothetical\nhomogeneous effective medium. In particular, if the PC is homogenizable, the\ndispersion relations and isofrequency lines in the effective medium and in the\nPC should coincide to some level of approximation. We can view this requirement\nas a necessary condition of homogenizability. In the vicinity of a\n$\\Gamma$-point, real isofrequency lines of two-dimensional PCs can be close to\nmathematical circles, just like in the case of isotropic homogeneous materials.\nThus, one may be tempted to conclude that introduction of an effective medium\nis possible and, at least, the necessary condition of homogenizability holds in\nthis case. We, however, show that this conclusion is incorrect: complex\ndispersion points must be included into consideration even in the case of\nstrictly non-absorbing materials. By analyzing the complex dispersion relations\nand the corresponding isofrequency lines, we have found that two-dimensional\nPCs with $C_4$ and $C_6$ symmetries are not homogenizable in the higher\nphotonic bands. We also draw a distinction between spurious $\\Gamma$-point\nfrequencies that are due to Brillouin-zone folding of Bloch bands and \"true\"\n$\\Gamma$-point frequencies that are due to multiple scattering. Understanding\nof the physically different phenomena that lead to the appearance of spurious\nand \"true\" $\\Gamma$-point frequencies is important for the theory of\nhomogenization.\n", "  Both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently observed an excess in the\ndi-photon invariant mass distribution in the vicinity of 750 GeV with a local\nsignificance of $\\sim3\\sigma$. In this article we try to investigate this\nexcess in the context of a minimal simplified framework assuming effective\ninteractions of the hinted resonance with photons and gluons. We scrutinise the\nconsistency of this observation with possible accompanying yet hitherto unseen\nsignatures of this resonance. Subsequently, we try to probe the nature of new\nparticles, e.g., spin, electric charge and number of colour, etc., that could\nremain instrumental to explain this excess through loop-mediation.\n", "  The Driven Liouville von Neumann approach [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 10,\n2927-2941 (2014)] is a computationally efficient simulation method for modeling\nelectron dynamics in molecular electronics junctions. Previous numerical\nsimulations have shown that the method can reproduce the exact single-particle\ndynamics while avoiding density matrix positivity violation found in earlier\nimplementations. In this study we prove that, in the limit of infinite lead\nmodels, the underlying equation of motion can be cast in Lindblad form. This\nprovides a formal justification for the positivity and trace preservation\nobtained numerically.\n", "  We have systematically investigated substrate-strain effects on the\nelectronic structures of two representative Sr-iridates, a correlated-insulator\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$ and a metal SrIrO$_3$. Optical conductivities obtained by the\n\\emph{ab initio} electronic structure calculations reveal that the tensile\nstrain shifts the optical peak positions to higher energy side with altered\nintensities, suggesting the enhancement of the electronic correlation and\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength in Sr-iridates. The response of the\nelectronic structure upon tensile strain is found to be highly correlated with\nthe direction of magnetic moment, the octahedral connectivity, and the SOC\nstrength, which cooperatively determine the robustness of $J_{eff}$=1/2 ground\nstates. Optical responses are analyzed also with microscopic model calculation\nand compared with corresponding experiments. In the case of SrIrO$_3$, the\nevolution of the electronic structure near the Fermi level shows high\ntunability of hole bands, as suggested by previous experiments.\n", "  While originally discovered in the context of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble,\nthe Tracy-Widom distribution also rules the height fluctuations of growth\nprocesses. This suggests that there might be other nonequilibrium processes in\nwhich the Tracy-Widom distribution plays an important role. In our contribution\nwe study one-dimensional systems with domain wall initial conditions. For an\nappropriate choice of parameters the profile develops a rarefaction wave, while\nmaintaining the initial equilibrium states far to the left and right, which\nthus serve as infinitely extended thermal reservoirs. For a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\ntype anharmonic chain we will demonstrate that the time-integrated current has\na deterministic contribution, linear in time $t$, and fluctuations of size\n$t^{1/3}$ with a Tracy-Widom distributed random amplitude.\n", "  We study the general NMSSM with an emphasis on the parameter regions with a\nvery strong first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In the presence of\nheavy fields coupled to the Higgs sector, the analysis can be problematic due\nto the existence of sizable radiative corrections. In this paper we propose a\nsubtraction scheme that helps to circumvent this problem. For simplicity we\nfocus on a parameter region that is by construction hidden from the current\ncollider searches. The analysis proves that (at least) in the identified\nparameter region the EWPT can be very strong and striking gravitational wave\nsignals can be produced. The corresponding gravitational stochastic background\ncan potentially be detected at the planned space-based gravitational wave\nobservatory eLISA, depending on the specific experiment design that will be\napproved.\n", "  We study the optical behaviour of an arrangement in which the interface\nbetween a linear and non-linear dielectric media is covered by an embedded\nmono-layer of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). The optical behaviour is\nqualitatively obtained through transmission and reflection coefficients which\nare a function of the third order non-linear susceptibility of the Kerr-type\ndielectric and the inter-band optical conductivity of the TMDC mono-layer. The\ninter-band optical conductivity of the TMCD mono-layer is calculated using the\nKubo formalism from linear response theory. In particular, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that the optical response of this arrangement can be switched\nbetween total internal reflection and a normal transmission regime by\ncontrolling the intensity of the incident radiation. The reflection and\ntransmission functions, additionally, are shown to be amenable to further\ncontrol by altering the inter-band optical conductivity of the embedded TMDC\nmono-layer. The optical conductivity is an outcome of its energy dispersion; we\nspecifically choose two TMDC mono-layers, MoS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$, which have\nnearly identical dispersion parameters apart from a much stronger spin-orbit\ncoupling in the latter. The stronger spin-orbit coupling in WSe$_{2}$ does not\nsignificantly alter the inter-band optical conductivity to manifest in an\nenhanced reflection spectrum. However, we find that application of an external\nperturbation such as strain could be effectively used to modulate the overall\noptical response. We conclude by offering a brief overview of the applicability\nof our proposed scheme in devices that employ an all-optical switching\nmechanism through optical bistability which is the hallmark of a non-linear\ndielectric.\n", "  We compute the non-Gaussian contribution to the covariance of the matter\npower spectrum at one-loop order in Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT), and\nusing the framework of the effective field theory (EFT) of large scale\nstructure (LSS). The complete one-loop contributions are evaluated for the\nfirst time, including the leading EFT corrections that involve seven\nindependent operators, of which four appear in the power spectrum and\nbispectrum. We compare the non-Gaussian part of the one-loop covariance\ncomputed with both SPT and EFT of LSS to two separate simulations. In one\nsimulation, we find that the one-loop prediction from SPT reproduces the\nsimulation well to $k_i + k_j \\sim$ 0.25 h/Mpc, while in the other simulation\nwe find a substantial improvement of EFT of LSS (with one free parameter) over\nSPT, more than doubling the range of $k$ where the theory accurately reproduces\nthe simulation. The disagreement between these two simulations points to\nunaccounted for systematics, highlighting the need for improved numerical and\nanalytic understanding of the covariance.\n", "  We explore the quantum dynamics of a bright matter-wave soliton in a\nquasi-one-dimensional bosonic superfluid with attractive interactions.\nSpecifically, we focus on the dissipative forces experienced by the soliton due\nto its interaction with Bogoliubov excitations. Using the collective coordinate\napproach and the Keldysh formalism, a Langevin equation of motion for the\nsoliton is derived from the first principle. The equation contains a stochastic\nLangevin force (associated with quantum noise) and a non-local in time\ndissipative force, which appears due to inelastic scattering of Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles off of the moving soliton. It is shown that Ohmic friction\n(i.e., a term proportional to the soliton's velocity) is absent in the\nintegrable setup. However, the Markovian approximation gives rise to the\nAbraham-Lorentz force (i.e., a term proportional to the derivative of the\nsoliton's acceleration), which is known from classical electrodynamics of a\ncharged particle interacting with its own radiation. These Abraham-Lorentz\nequations famously contain a fundamental causality paradox, where the\nsoliton/particle interacts with excitations/radiation originating from future\nevents. We show, however, that the causality paradox is an artifact of the\nMarkovian approximation, and our exact non-Markovian dissipative equations give\nrise to physical trajectories. We argue that the quantum friction discussed\nhere should be observable in current quantum gas experiments.\n", "  Degenerate plasmas with motionless ions show existence of three surface\nwaves: the Langmuir wave, the electromagnetic wave, and the zeroth sound.\nApplying the separated spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics to half-space\nplasma we demonstrate the existence of the surface spin-electron acoustic wave\n(SSEAW). We study dispersion of the SSEAW. We show that there is hybridization\nbetween the surface Langmuir wave and the SSEAW at rather small spin\npolarization. In the hybridization area the dispersion branches are located\nclose to each other. In this area there is a strong interaction between these\nwaves leading to the energy exchange. Consequently, generating the Langmuir\nwaves with the frequencies close to hybridization area we can generate the\nSSEAWs. Thus, we report a method of creation of the SEAWs.\n", "  We study the quantum tunneling of charged massive vector bosons from a\ncharged static and a rotating black string. We apply the standard methods,\nfirst we use the WKB approximation and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and then\nwe end up with a set of four linear equations. Finally, solving for the radial\npart by using the determinant of the metric equals zero, the corresponding\ntunneling rate and the Hawking temperature is recovered in both cases. The\ntunneling rate deviates from pure thermality and is consistent with an\nunderlying unitary theory.\n", "  We investigate the statistical power of higher-order statistics and\ncross-correlation statistics to constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity from\nthe imaging surveys. In particular, we consider the local-type primordial non-\nGaussianity and discuss how well one can tightly constrain the higher-order\nnon-Gaussian parameters ($g_{\\rm NL}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$) as well as the\nleading order parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ from the halo/galaxy clustering and weak\ngravitational lensing measurements. Making use of a strong scale-dependent\nbehavior in the galaxy/halo clustering, Fisher matrix analysis reveals that the\nbispectra can break the degeneracy between non-Gaussian parameters ($f_{\\rm\nNL}$, $g_{\\rm NL}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$) and this will give simultaneous\nconstraints on those three parameters. The combination of cross-correlation\nstatistics further improves the constraints by factor of 2. As a result,\nupcoming imaging surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope have the\npotential to improve the constraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity much\ntighter than those obtained from the CMB measurement by Planck, giving us an\nopportunity to test the single-sourced consistency relation, $\\tau_{\\rm NL} \\ge\n(36/25) f_{\\rm NL}^2$.\n", "  We propose a mathematical methodology to derive a stochastic parameterization\nof bulk warm cloud micro-physics properties. Unlike previous bulk\nparameterizations, the stochastic parameterization does not assume any\nparticular droplet size distribution, all parameters have physical meanings\nwhich are recoverable from data, and the resultant parameterization has the\nflexibility to utilize a variety of collision kernels. Our strategy is a new\ntwo-fold approach to modelling the kinetic collection equation. Partitioning\nthe droplet spectrum into cloud and rain aggregates, we represent droplet\ndensities as the sum of a mean and a random fluctuation. Moreover, we use a\nTaylor approximation for the collision kernel which allows the resulting\nparameterization to be independent of the collision kernel.\n  To address the two-moment closure for bulk microphysical equations, we\nrepresent the higher (third) order terms as points in an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck-like stochastic process. These higher order terms are\naggregate number concentration, and aggregate mixing ratio, fluctuations and\nproduct fluctuations on regions of a 2D space of pre-collision droplets. This\n2D space is naturally partitioned into four domains, each associated with a\ncollision process: cloud and rain self-collection, auto-conversion, and\naccretion. The stochastic processes in the solution to the kinetic collection\nequation are defined as the sum of a mean and the product of a standard\ndeviation and a random fluctuation. An order of magnitude argument on the\ntemporal fluctuations of the evolving cloud properties eliminates the terms\ncontaining a standard deviation and a random fluctuation from the mean\nevolution equations. The remaining terms form a coupled set of ODE's without\nany ad-hoc parameters or any assumed droplet size distributions and flexible\nenough to accept any collision kernel without further derivations.\n", "  Using dynamical mean-field theory and exact diagonalization we study the\nphase diagram of the repulsive Haldane-Hubbard model, varying the interaction\nstrength and the sublattice potential difference. In addition to the quantum\nHall phase with Chern number $C=2$ and the band insulator with $C=0$ present\nalready in the noninteracting model, the system also exhibits a $C=0$ Mott\ninsulating phase, and a $C=1$ quantum Hall phase. We explain the latter phase\nby a spontaneous symmetry breaking where one of the spin-components is in the\nHall state and the other in the band insulating state.\n", "  A large number of new experimental data on $B$ decay into two light\npesudoscalar ($P$) mesons have been collected by the LHCb collaboration.\nBesides confirming information on $B_{u,d} \\to PP$ decays obtained earlier by\nB-factories at KEK and SLAC, new information on $B_s\\to PP$ and also more decay\nmodes with $P$ being $\\eta$ or $\\eta'$ have been obtained. Using these new\ndata, we perform a global fit for $B \\to PP$ to determine decay amplitudes in\nthe framework of $SU(3)/U(3)$ flavor symmetry. We find that $SU(3)$ flavor\nsymmetry can explain data well. The annihilation amplitudes are found to be\nsmall as expected. Several CP violating relations predicted by $SU(3)$ flavor\nsymmetry are in good agreement with data. Current available data can give\nconstraints on the amplitudes which induce $P = \\eta,\\;\\eta'$ decays in the\nframework of $U(3)$ flavor symmetry, and can also determine the $\\eta-\\eta'$\nmixing angle $\\theta$ with $\\theta = (-18.4\\pm1.2)^\\circ$. Several $B \\to PP$\ndecay modes which have not been measured are predicted with branching ratios\naccessible at the LHCb. These decays can provide further tests for the\nframework of $SU(3)/U(3)$ flavor symmetry for $B$ decays.\n", "  Homology is a tool in topological data analysis which measures the shape of\nthe data. In many cases, these measurements translate into new insights which\nare not available by other means. To compute homology, we rely on mathematical\nconstructions which scale exponentially with the size of the data. Therefore,\nfor large point clouds, the computation is infeasible using classical\ncomputers. In this paper, we present a quantum annealing pipeline for\ncomputation of homology of large point clouds. The pipeline takes as input a\ngraph approximating the given point cloud. It uses quantum annealing to compute\na clique covering of the graph and then uses this cover to construct a\nMayer-Vietoris complex. The pipeline terminates by performing a simplified\nhomology computation of the Mayer-Vietoris complex. We have introduced three\ndifferent clique coverings and their quantum annealing formulation. Our\npipeline scales polynomially in the size of the data, once the covering step is\nsolved. To prove correctness of our algorithm, we have also included tests\nusing D-Wave 2X quantum processor.\n", "  Recent technological advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) are\npaving the way to utilise multiple quantum emitters confined in a single\noptical cavity. In such systems it is crucially important to control the\nquantum mechanical coupling of individual emitters to the cavity mode. In this\nregard, combining ion trap technologies with CQED provides a particularly\npromising approach due to the well-established motional control over trapped\nions. Here we experimentally demonstrate coupling of up to five trapped ions in\na string to a high-finesse optical cavity. By changing the axial position and\nspacing of the ions in a fully deterministic manner, we systematically\ncharacterise their coupling to the cavity mode through visibility measurements\nof the cavity emission. In good agreement with the theoretical model, the\nresults demonstrate that the geometrical configuration of multiple trapped ions\ncan be manipulated to obtain optimal cavity coupling. Our system presents a new\nground to explore CQED with multiple quantum emitters, enabled by the highly\ncontrollable collective light-matter interaction.\n", "  We explore a newly proposed channel to create binary black holes of stellar\norigin. This scenario applies to massive, tight binaries where mixing induced\nby rotation and tides transports the products of hydrogen burning throughout\nthe stellar envelopes. This slowly enriches the entire star with helium,\npreventing the build-up of an internal chemical gradient. The stars remain\ncompact as they evolve nearly chemically homogeneously, eventually forming two\nblack holes, which, we estimate, typically merge 4--11 Gyr after formation.\nLike other proposed channels, this evolutionary pathway suffers from\nsignificant theoretical uncertainties, but could be constrained in the near\nfuture by data from advanced ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We\nperform Monte Carlo simulations of the expected merger rate over cosmic time to\nexplore the implications and uncertainties. Our default model for this channel\nyields a local binary black hole merger rate of about $10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$\nat redshift $z=0$, peaking at twice this rate at $z=0.5$. This means that this\nchannel is competitive, in terms of expected rates, with the conventional\nformation scenarios that involve a common-envelope phase during isolated binary\nevolution or dynamical interaction in a dense cluster. The events from this\nchannel may be distinguished by the preference for nearly equal-mass components\nand high masses, with typical total masses between 50 and 110\n$\\textrm{M}_\\odot$. Unlike the conventional isolated binary evolution scenario\nthat involves shrinkage of the orbit during a common-envelope phase, short time\ndelays are unlikely for this channel, implying that we do not expect mergers at\nhigh redshift.\n", "  Meeting the science goals for many current and future ground-based optical\nlarge-area sky surveys requires that the calibrated broadband photometry is\nstable in time and uniform over the sky to 1% precision or better. Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We\nconclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass\nin each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the\natmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over\nthe focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated\nsystematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample\ndata, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less\nthan 0.3%. We also find that the errors for non-stellar objects are\nredshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.\n", "  In this paper, based on the fundamental principles of Gauge/gravity duality\nand considering a \\textit{global quench}, we probe the physics of\nthermalization for a special class of strongly coupled non relativistic QFTs by\ncomputing the entanglement entropy of the plasma. The isometry group of such\nQFTs is comprised of the generators of the Schr\\\"odinger algebra which could be\nprecisely realized as an isometry group of the killing generators of an\nasymptotically Schr\\\"odinger $ Dp $ brane space time. In our analysis, we note\nthat during the pre local stages of the thermal equilibrium the entanglement\nentropy has a faster growth in time compared to its relativistic cousin.\nHowever, it shows a linear growth during the post local stages of thermal\nequilibrium where the so called tsunami velocity associated with the linear\ngrowth of the entanglement entropy saturates to that of its value corresponding\nto the relativistic scenario. Finally, we explore the saturation region and it\nturns out that one must constraint certain parameters of the theory in a\nspecific way in order to have a discontinuous transitions at the point of\nsaturation.\n", "  Quantifying the universality of avalanche observables beyond critical\nexponents is of current great interest in theory and experiments. Here, we\nimprove the characterization of the spatio-temporal process inside avalanches\nin the universality class of the depinning of elastic interfaces in random\nmedia. Surprisingly, at variance with the temporal shape, the spatial shape of\navalanches has not yet been predicted. In part this is due to a lack of an\nanalytically tractable definition: how should the shapes be centered? Here we\nintroduce such a definition, accessible in experiments, and study the mean\nspatial shape of avalanches at fixed size centered around their starting point\n(seed). We calculate the associated universal scaling functions, both in a\nmean-field model and beyond. Notably, they are predicted to exhibit a cusp\nsingularity near the seed. The results are in good agreement with a numerical\nsimulation of an elastic line.\n", "  The effect of AC electric fields on the elasticity of supported lipid\nbilayers has been investigated at the microscopic level using grazing incidence\nsynchrotron x-ray scattering. A strong decrease in the membrane tension up to\n1mN/m and a dramatic increase of its effective rigidity up to 300kBT are\nobserved for local electric potentials seen by the membrane < 1V. The\nexperimental results were analyzed using detailed electrokinetic modeling and\nnon-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Based on a modeling of the electromagnetic\nstress which provides an accurate description of bilayer separation vs pressure\ncurves, we show that the decrease in tension results from the amplification of\ncharge fluctuations on the membrane surface whereas the increase in bending\nrigidity results from direct interaction between charges in the electric double\nlayer. These effects eventually lead to a destabilization of the bilayer and\nvesicle formation. Similar effects are expected at the tens of nanometer\nlengthscale in cell membranes with lower tension, and could explain a number of\nelectrically driven processes.\n", "  Megamaser disks provide the most precise and accurate extragalactic\nsupermassive black hole masses. Here we describe a search for megamasers in\nnearby galaxies using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We focus on galaxies\nwhere we believe that we can resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of\nthe black hole and derive a stellar or gas dynamical measurement with optical\nor NIR observations. Since there are only a handful of super massive black\nholes (SMBH) that have direct black hole mass measurements from more than one\nmethod, even a single galaxy with a megamaser disk and a stellar dynamical\nblack hole mass would provide necessary checks on the stellar dynamical\nmethods. We targeted 87 objects from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Massive Galaxy\nSurvey, and detected no new maser disks. Most of the targeted objects are\nelliptical galaxies with typical stellar velocity dispersions of 250 km/s and\ndistances within 130 Mpc. We discuss the implications of our non-detections,\nwhether they imply a threshold X-ray luminosity required for masing, or\npossibly reflect the difficulty of maintaining a masing disk around much more\nmassive (>10^8 Msun) black holes at low Eddington ratio. Given the power of\nmaser disks at probing black hole accretion and demographics, we suggest that\nfuture maser searches should endeavour to remove remaining sample biases, in\norder to sort out the importance of these covariant effects.\n", "  In this paper, we report observations of a peculiar Type Ia supernova\niPTF13asv (a.k.a., SN2013cv) from the onset of the explosion to months after\nits peak. The early-phase spectra of iPTF13asv show absence of iron absorption,\nindicating that synthesized iron elements are confined to low-velocity regions\nof the ejecta, which, in turn, implies a stratified ejecta structure along the\nline of sight. Our analysis of iPTF13asv's light curves and spectra shows that\nit is an intermediate case between normal and super-Chandrasekhar events. On\nthe one hand, its light curve shape (B-band $\\Delta m_{15}=1.03\\pm0.01$) and\noverall spectral features resemble those of normal Type Ia supernovae. On the\nother hand, similar to super-Chandrasekhar events, it shows large peak optical\nand UV luminosity ($M_B=-19.84\\,\\rm{mag}$, $M_{uvm2}=-15.5\\,\\rm{mag}$) a\nrelatively low but almost constant \\ion{Si}{2} velocities of about\n$10,000\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$, and persistent carbon absorption in the\nspectra. We estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.81^{+0.10}_{-0.18}M_\\odot$ and a\ntotal ejecta mass of $1.59^{+0.45}_{-0.12}M_\\odot$. The large ejecta mass of\niPTF13asv and its stratified ejecta structure together seemingly favor a\ndouble-degenerate origin.\n", "  A class of exact conformastatic solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field\nequations is presented in which the gravitational and electromagnetic\npotentials are completely determined by a harmonic function. We derive the\nequations of motion for neutral and charged particles in a spacetime background\ncharacterized by this class of solutions. As an example, we focus on the\nanalysis of a particular harmonic function, which generates a singularity-free\nand asymptotically flat spacetime that describes the gravitational field of a\npunctual mass endowed with a magnetic field. In this particular case, we\ninvestigate the main physical properties of equatorial circular orbits. We show\nthat due to the electromagnetic interaction, it is possible to have charged\ntest particles which stay at rest with respect to a static observer located at\ninfinity. Additionally, we obtain an analytic expression for the perihelion\nadvance of test particles and the corresponding explicit value in the case of a\npunctual magnetic mass. We show that the analytical expressions obtained from\nour analysis are sufficient for being confronted with observations in order to\nestablish whether such objects can exist in nature.\n", "  On the basis of the quantum Zeno effect it has been recently shown [D. K.\nBurgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] that a strong amplitude damping\nprocess applied locally on a part of a quantum system can have a beneficial\neffect on the dynamics of the remaining part of the system. Quantum operations\nthat cannot be implemented without the dissipation become achievable by the\naction of the strong dissipative process. Here we generalize this idea by\nidentifying decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's) as the subspaces in which the\ndynamics becomes more complex. Applying methods from quantum control theory we\ncharacterize the set of reachable operations within the DFS's. We provide three\nexamples which become fully controllable within the DFS's while the control\nover the original Hilbert space in the absence of dissipation is trivial. In\nparticular, we show that the (classical) Ising Hamiltonian is turned into a\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian by strong collective decoherence, which provides\nuniversal quantum computation within the DFS's. Moreover we perform numerical\ngate optimization to study how the process fidelity scales with the noise\nstrength. As a byproduct a subsystem fidelity which can be applied in other\noptimization problems for open quantum systems is developed.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a nanoscale mode-division multiplexing scheme\nbased on parity-time (PT) symmetric coaxial plasmonic waveguides. Coaxial\nwaveguides support paired degenerate modes corresponding to distinct orbital\nangular momentum states. PT symmetric inclusions of gain and loss break the\ndegeneracy of the paired modes and create new hybrid modes without orbital\nangular momentum. This process can be made thresholdless by matching the mode\norder with the number of gain and loss sections within the coaxial ring. Using\nboth a Hamiltonian formulation and degenerate perturbation theory, we show how\nthe wavevectors and fields evolve with increased loss/gain and derive\nsufficient conditions for thresholdless transitions. As a multiplexing filter,\nthis PT symmetric coaxial waveguide could help double density rates in on-chip\nnanophotonic networks.\n", "  We rigorously establish an Arrhenius law for the mixing time of quantum\ndoubles based on any Abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}_d$. We have made the concept of\nthe energy barrier therein mathematically well-defined, it is related to the\nminimum energy cost the environment has to provide to the system in order to\nproduce a generalized Pauli error, maximized for any generalized Pauli errors,\nnot only logical operators. We evaluate this generalized energy barrier in\nAbelian quantum double models and find it to be a constant independent of\nsystem size. Thus, we rule out the possibility of entropic protection for this\nbroad group of models.\n", "  We analyze theoretically electronic transport through a core-shell nanowire\nin the presence of a transversal magnetic field. We calculate the conductance\nfor a variable coupling between the nanowire and the attached leads and show\nhow the snaking states, which are low-energy states localized along the lines\nof vanishing radial component of the magnetic field, manifest their existence.\nIn the strong coupling regime they induce Aharonov-Bohm-like conductance\noscillations, which, by decreasing the coupling to the leads, evolve into well\nresolved peaks. These results show that the formation of snaking states in the\nnanowire affects magnetoconductance measurements irrespective of the strength\nof the contacts with the leads. We analyze theoretically electronic transport\nthrough a core-shell nanowire in the presence of a transversal magnetic field.\nWe calculate the conductance for a variable coupling between the nanowire and\nthe attached leads and show how the snaking states, which are low-energy states\nlocalized along the lines of vanishing radial component of the magnetic field,\nmanifest their existence. In the strong coupling regime they induce\nAharonov-Bohm-like conductance oscillations, which, by decreasing the coupling\nto the leads, evolve into well resolved peaks. The flux periodic oscillations\narise due to interference of the snaking states, which is a consequence of\nbackscattering at either the contacts with leads or magnetic/potential barriers\nin the wire.\n", "  We study the slow quenching dynamics (characterized by an inverse rate,\n$\\tau^{-1}$) of a one-dimensional transverse Ising chain with nearest neighbor\nferromagentic interactions across the quantum critical point (QCP) and analyze\nthe Loschmidt overlap {measured using the subsequent temporal evolution of the\nfinal wave function (reached at the end of the quenching) with the final\ntime-independent Hamiltonian}. Studying the Fisher zeros of the corresponding\ngeneralized \"partition function\", we probe non-analyticities manifested in the\nrate function of the return probability known as dynamical phase transitions\n(DPTs). In contrast to the sudden quenching case, we show that DPTs survive {in\nthe subsequent temporal evolution following the quenching across two critical\npoints of the model for a sufficiently slow rate; furthermore, an interesting\n\"lobe\" structure of Fisher zeros emerge.} We have also made a connection to\ntopological aspects studying the dynamical topological order parameter\n($\\nu_D(t)$), as a function of time ($t$) {measured from the instant when the\nquenching is complete. Remarkably, the time evolution of $\\nu_D(t)$ exhibits\ndrastically different behavior following quenches across a single QCP and two\nQCPs. } {In the former case, $\\nu_D (t)$ increases step-wise by unity at every\nDPT (i.e., $\\Delta \\nu_D =1$). In the latter case, on the other hand,\n$\\nu_D(t)$ essentially oscillates between 0 and 1 (i.e., successive DPTs occur\nwith $\\Delta \\nu_D =1$ and $\\Delta \\nu_D =-1$, respectively), except for\ninstants where it shows a sudden jump by a factor of unity when two successive\nDPTs carry a topological charge of same sign.\n", "  Standing oscillations with multiple periods were found in a number of\natmospheric structures on the Sun. The ratio of the period of the fundamental\nto twice the one of its first overtone, $P_1/2P_2$, is important in\napplications of solar magneto-seismology. We examine how field-aligned flows\nimpact $P_1/2P_2$ of standing modes in solar magnetic cylinders. For coronal\nloops, the flow effects are significant for both fast kink and sausage modes.\nFor kink ones, they reduce $P_1/2P_2$ by up to 17\\% relative to the static case\neven when the density contrast between the loop and its surroundings approaches\ninfinity. For sausage modes, the reduction in $P_1/2P_2$ due to flow is\ntypically $\\lesssim 5.5\\%$ compared with the static case. However, the\nthreshold aspect ratio, only above which can trapped sausage modes be\nsupported, may increase dramatically with the flow magnitude. For photospheric\ntubes, the flow effect on $P_1/2P_2$ is not as strong. However, when applied to\nsausage modes, introducing field-aligned flows offers more possibilities in\ninterpreting the multiple periods recently measured. We conclude that\nfield-aligned flows should be taken into account to help better understand what\ncauses the departure of $P_1/2P_2$ from unity.\n", "  In this study, the charged Higgs pair production is analyzed for the minimal\nextension of the standard model called two-higgs-doublet model. The process\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow H^+H^-$ is calculated at the tree level for the ILC\nand the numerical analysis is presented for various parameters. The production\nrate of the charged Higgs boson pair as a function of center-of-mass (CM)\nenergy and the differential cross section as a function of angle between photon\nand positive charged Higgs boson is presented. The cross section gets high at\nthe low charged Higgs mass and low CM energies. The total integrated cross\nsection of the process is also calculated at a $e^+e^-$-collider by convoluting\nthe $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow H^+H^-$ subprocess with the photon luminosity of\nthe backscattered photons. The total integrated cross section peaks around\n$\\sqrt{s}=650 \\;\\text{GeV}$ and have a value of $1.4 \\;\\text{pb}$ for\n$m_{H^\\pm}=100\\;\\text{GeV/c}^2$. Charged Higgs detection is very important sign\nfor the new physics and the results shows the potential of the ILC for the\nsearch of the new physics signals.\n", "  Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theory that gives an explanation for the strong and\nelectroweak interactions from the grand unification scale down to the weak\nscale. The search for supersymmetric particles still continues at full speed at\nthe LHC without success. The main tasks at the ILC is complementing the LHC\nresult and also search for new physics. In this study, the neutralino pair\nproduction via photon-photon collision is studied for the\n$\\tilde{t}$-coannihilation scenario in the context of MSSM at the ILC. In the\ncalculation, all the possible one-loop diagrams are taken into account for the\nphoton-photon interaction. We present the production cross section and\ndistribution of various observables for the lightest and next-to-lightest\nneutralino pairs for benchmark models which are specifically presented in the\nlight of LHC8 data analysis, employing these benchmark models for neutralino\npair production could show the potential of the ILC concerning the dark matter\nsearches in supersymmetry.\n", "  We investigate the modulation of optical phonons in semiconductor crystal by\nsurface acoustic wave (SAW) propagating on the crystal surface. The SAW fields\ninduce changes on the order of 10\\textsuperscript{-3} in the average Raman\nscattering intensity by optical phonons in Si and GaN crystals. The SAW-induced\nmodifications in the Raman cross-section are dominated by the modulation of the\noptical phonon energy by the SAW strain field. In addition to this local\ncontribution, the experiments give evidence for a weaker and non-local\ncontribution arising from the spatial variation of the SAW strain field. The\nlatter is attributed to the activation of optical modes with large wave vectors\nand, therefore, lower energies. The experimental results, which are well\ndescribed by theoretical models for the two contributions, prove that optical\nphonons can be manipulated by SAWs with $\\mu$m wavelengths\n", "  It is shown that a periodic emergence and destruction of an additional\nquantum number leads to an exponential growth of energy of a quantum mechanical\nsystem subjected to a slow periodic variation of parameters. The main example\nis given by systems (e.g., quantum billiards and quantum graphs) with\nperiodically divided configuration space. In special cases, the process can\nalso lead to a long period of cooling that precedes the acceleration, and to\nthe desertion of the states with a particular value of the quantum number.\n", "  We derive a mathematical model of a nematic electrolyte based on the\nLeslie-Ericksen theory of liquid crystal flow. Our goal is to investigate the\nnonlinear electrokinetic effects that occur because the nematic matrix is\nanisotropic, in particular, transport of ions in a direction perpendicular to\nthe electric field as well as quadratic dependence of the induced flow velocity\non the electric field. The latter effect makes it possible to generate\nsustained flows in the nematic electrolyte that do not reverse their direction\nwhen the polarity of the applied electric field is reversed. From a practical\nperspective, this enables the design of AC-driven electrophoretic and\nelectroosmotic devices. Our study of a special flow in a thin nematic film\nshows a very good agreement with laboratory experiments.\n", "  In view of the integration of membrane resonators with more complex MEMS\nstructures, we developed a general fabrication procedure for circular shape\nSiN$_x$ membranes using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). Large area and\nhigh-stress SiN$_x$ membranes were fabricated and used as optomechanical\nresonators in a Michelson interferometer and in a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. The\nmeasurements show that the fabrication process preserves both the optical\nquality and the mechanical quality factor of the membrane.\n", "  Melting of boron subphosphide (B12P2) to 26 GPa has been studied by in situ\nsynchrotron X-ray powder diffraction in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, and\nby quenching and electrical resistance measurements in a toroid-type\nhigh-pressure apparatus. B12P2 melts congruently, and the melting curve has a\npositive slope of 23(6) K/GPa. No solid-state phase transition was observed up\nto the melting in the whole pressure range under study.\n", "  Observable primordial tensor modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nwould point to a high scale of inflation $H_{I}$. If the scale of Peccei-Quinn\n(PQ) breaking $f_a$ is greater than $\\frac{H_{I}}{2\\pi}$, CMB constraints on\nisocurvature naively rule out QCD axion dark matter. This assumes the potential\nof the axion is unmodified during inflation. We revisit models where\ninflationary dynamics modify the axion potential and discuss how isocurvature\nbounds can be relaxed. We find that models that rely solely on a larger\nPQ-breaking scale during inflation $f_I$ require either late-time dilution of\nthe axion abundance or highly super-Planckian $f_I$ that somehow does not\ndominate the inflationary energy density. Models that have enhanced explicit\nbreaking of the PQ symmetry during inflation may allow $f_a$ close to the\nPlanck scale. Avoiding disruption of inflationary dynamics provides important\nlimits on the parameter space.\n", "  The combined effect of SFP and the non standard neutrino interaction (NSI) on\nthe survival probability of solar electron neutrinos (assumed to be Dirac\nparticles) is examined for various values of $\\epsilon_{11}$, $\\epsilon_{12}$\nand $\\mu B$. It is found that the neutrino survival probability curves affected\nby SFP and NSI effects individually for some values of the parameters\n($\\epsilon_{11}$, $\\epsilon_{12}$ and $\\mu B$) get close to the standard MSW\ncurve when both effects are combined. Therefore, the combined effect of SFP and\nNSI needs to be taken into account when the solar electron neutrino data\nobtained by low energy solar neutrino experiments is investigated.\n", "  We study the dynamics of quantum coherence under Unruh thermal noise and seek\nunder which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We\nfind that the frozen condition is either (i) the initial state is prepared as a\nincoherence state, or (ii) the detectors have no interaction with the external\nfield. That is to say, the decoherence of detectors' quantum state is\nirreversible under the influence of thermal noise induced by Unruh radiation.\nIt is shown that quantum coherence approaches zero only in the limit of an\ninfinite acceleration, while quantum entanglement could reduce to zero for a\nfinite acceleration. It is also demonstrated that the robustness of quantum\ncoherence is better than entanglement under the influence of the atom-field\ninteraction for an extremely large acceleration. Therefore, quantum coherence\nis more robust than entanglement in an accelerating system and the coherence\ntype quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic quantum information\nprocessing tasks.\n", "  We study induced gravity dark energy models coupled with a simple monomial\npotential $\\propto \\sigma^n$ and a positive exponent $n$. These simple\npotentials lead to viable dark energy models with a weak dependence on the\nexponent, which characterizes the accelerated expansion of the cosmological\nmodel in the asymptotic attractor, when ordinary matter becomes negligible. We\nuse recent cosmological data to constrain the coupling $\\gamma$ to the Ricci\ncurvature, under the assumptions that the scalar field starts at rest deep in\nthe radiation era and that the gravitational constant in the Einstein equations\nis compatible with the one measured in a Cavendish-like experiment. By using\n$Planck$ 2015 data only, we obtain the 95 % CL bound $\\gamma < 0.0017$ for\n$n=4$, which is further tightened to $\\gamma < 0.00075$ by adding Baryonic\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. This latter bound improves by $\\sim 30$ % the\nlimit obtained with the $Planck$ 2013 data and the same compilation of BAO\ndata. We discuss the dependence of the $\\gamma$ and $\\dot G_N/G_N (z=0)$ on\n$n$.\n", "  In this paper, by the use of the topological current theory, the topological\nstructures and the dynamic processes in thin-film ferromagnetic systems are\ninvestigated directly from viewpoint of topology. It is found that the\ntopological charge of a thin-film ferromagnetic system can be changed by\nannihilation or creation processes of opposite polarized vortex-antivortex\npairs taking place at space-time singularities of the normalized magnetization\nvector field of the system, the variation of the topological charge is integer\nand can further be expressed in terms of the Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees\nof the magnetization vector field around the singularities. Moreover, the\nchange of the topological charge of the system is crucial to vortex core\nreversal processes in ferromagnetic thin films. With the help of the\ntopological current theory and implicit function theorem, the processes of\nvortex merging, splitting as well as vortex core\n", "  We present numerical studies of dipolar spin ice in the presence of a\nmagnetic field slightly tilted away from the [111] axis. We find a first-order\ntransition from a kagome ice to a $\\mathbf{q}=$X state when the external field\nis tilted toward the $[11\\bar{2}]$ direction. This is consistent with the\nanomalous critical scattering previously observed in the neutron scattering\nexperiment on the spin ice material\n$\\textrm{Ho}_{2}\\textrm{Ti}_{2}\\textrm{O}_{7}$ in a tilted field [Nat. Phys. 3,\n566 (2007)]. We show that this ordering originates from the antiferromagnetic\nalignment of spin chains on the kagome planes. The residual entropy of the\nkagome ice is fully recovered. Our result captures the features observed in the\nexperiments and points to the importance of the dipolar interaction in\ndetermining ordered states in the spin ice materials. We place our results in\nthe context of recent susceptibility measurements on\n$\\textrm{Dy}_{2}\\textrm{Ti}_{2}\\textrm{O}_{7}$, showing two features for a\n[111] field.\n", "  We classify and distinguish optically biaxial materials, which can have\ntriclinic, monoclinic or orthorhombic crystal symmetry, by the degeneracy of\nthe indices of refraction of their four singular optical axes (Windungsachsen)\nin the absorption regime. We provide explicit analytical solutions for angular\norientations of the singular optical axes in monoclinic crystals and\northorhombic crystals. As a model material we analyze monoclinic gallia\n($\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$) and discuss in detail the dispersion (i.e. the spectral\nvariation of the angular position) of its singular optical axes. For a certain\nenergy range ($E \\approx 7.23$-$7.33$ eV) we find quasi-uniaxial symmetry. At\ntwo energies ($E \\approx 8.14$ eV and $E \\approx 8.37$ eV) we find triaxial\nspectral points for which one regular optical axis and two singular optical\naxes exist. Concurrently a Stokes analysis of the spectral dependence of the\nelectrical field eigenvectors is made and discussed for various crystal\norientations. For a singular optical axis $|S_3|=1$; for the two degenerate\nsingular axes at the triaxial point the Stokes vector is undefined. For a\ncertain energy ($E=6.59$ eV), the $\\langle 010 \\rangle$-orientation is close to\na singular optical axis, $|S_3|=0.977$. The analysis provided here is\nprototypical for the treatment of the optical properties of optically biaxial\nfunctional materials in the absorption and gain regimes.\n", "  We consider theoretically the possibility of an electron acceleration in\nquantum wire by short magnetic pulses lasted bewteen several to few tens of\npicoseconds. We show that such possibility exists provided that, the electron\nis initially localized in part of nanowire that consists of two vertically\naligned layers which are tunnel coupled. When a horizontally directed magnetic\nfield, changeable in time, is also perpendicular to the main axis of a wire, it\ngenerates a rotational electric field in it which pushes the upper and the\nlower parts of the electron wavepacket in opposite directions. We have found\nhowever, that for an asymmetric vertical confinement, the majority part of\ncharge density starts to move in the direction of local electric field in its\nlayer but it also drags the minority part in the same direction what results in\ncoherent motion of an entire wavepacket. We discuss the dynamics of this motion\nin dependence on the time characteristics of the magnetic pulse.\n", "  In a flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry, we\nconsider the expansion of the universe powered by the gravitationally induced\n`adiabatic' matter creation. To demonstrate how matter creation works well with\nthe expanding universe, we have considered a general creation rate and analyzed\nthis rate in the framework of dynamical analysis. The dynamical analysis hints\nthe presence of a non-singular universe (without the big bang singularity) with\ntwo successive accelerated phases, one at the very early phase of the universe\n(i.e. inflation), and the other one describes the current accelerating\nuniverse, where this early, late accelerated phases are associated with an\nunstable fixed point (i.e. repeller) and a stable fixed (attractor) points,\nrespectively. We have described this phenomena by analytic solutions of the\nHubble function and the scale factor of the FLRW universe. Using Jacobi Last\nmultiplier method, we have found a Lagrangian for this matter creation rate\ndescribing this scenario of the universe. To match with our early physics\nresults, we introduce an equivalent dynamics driven by a single scalar field\nand discussed the associated observable parameters compared them with the\nlatest PLANCK data sets. Finally, introducing the teleparallel modified\ngravity, we have established an equivalent gravitational theory in the\nframework of matter creation.\n", "  We consider the random transverse-field Ising model in $d=3$ dimensions with\nlong-range ferromagnetic interactions which decay as a power $\\alpha > d$ with\nthe distance. Using a variant of the strong disorder renormalization group\nmethod we study numerically the phase-transition point from the paramagnetic\nside. The distribution of the (sample dependent) pseudo-critical points is\nfound to scale with $1/\\ln L$, $L$ being the linear size of the sample.\nSimilarly, the critical magnetization scales with $(\\ln L)^{\\chi}/L^d$ and the\nexcitation energy behaves as $L^{-\\alpha}$. Using extreme-value statistics we\nargue that extrapolating from the ferromagnetic side the magnetization\napproaches a finite limiting value and thus the transition is of mixed-order.\n", "  We report GaN n++/p++ interband tunnel junctions with repeatable negative\ndifferential resistance and low resistance. Reverse and forward tunneling\ncurrent densities were observed to increase as Si and Mg doping concentrations\nwere increased. Hysteresis-free, bidirectional negative differential resistance\nwas observed at room temperature from these junctions at a forward voltage of\n~1.6-2 V. Thermionic PN junctions with tunnel contact to the p-layer exhibited\nforward current density of 150 kA/cm^2 at 7.6 V, with a low series device\nresistance of 1 x 10^-5 ohm.cm^2.\n", "  We provide a physics derivation of Monstrous moonshine. We show that the\nMcKay-Thompson series $T_g$, $g\\in \\mathbb{M}$, can be interpreted as\nsupersymmetric indices counting spacetime BPS-states in certain heterotic\nstring models. The invariance groups of these series arise naturally as\nspacetime T-duality groups and their genus zero property descends from the\nbehaviour of these heterotic models in suitable decompactification limits. We\nalso show that the space of BPS-states forms a module for the Monstrous Lie\nalgebras $\\mathfrak{m}_g$, constructed by Borcherds and Carnahan. We argue that\n$\\mathfrak{m}_g$ arise in the heterotic models as algebras of spontaneously\nbroken gauge symmetries, whose generators are in exact correspondence with\nBPS-states. This gives $\\mathfrak{m}_g$ an interpretation as a kind of\nBPS-algebra.\n", "  We analyze a model of itinerant electrons interacting through a quadrupole\ndensity-density repulsion in three dimensions. At the mean field level, the\ninteraction drives a continuous Pomeranchuk instability towards $d$-wave,\nspin-triplet nematic order, which simultaneously breaks the SU(2) spin-rotation\nand spatial rotational symmetries. This order results in spin antisymmetric,\nelliptical deformations of the Fermi surfaces of up and down spins. We show\nthat the effects of quantum fluctuations are similar to those in metallic\nferromagnets, rendering the nematic transition first-order at low temperatures.\nUsing the fermionic quantum order-by-disorder approach to self-consistently\ncalculate fluctuations around possible modulated states, we show that the\nfirst-order transition is pre-empted by the formation of a nematic state that\nis intertwined with a helical modulation in spin space. Such a state is closely\nrelated to $d$-wave bond density wave order in square-lattice systems.\nMoreover, we show that it may coexist with a modulated, $p$-wave\nsuperconducting state.\n", "  We investigate the dependence on data quality of quasar properties measured\nfrom the CIV emission line region at high redshifts. Our measurements come from\n32 epochs of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Reverberation Mapping Project\nspectroscopic observations of 482 z>1.46 quasars. We compare the differences\nbetween measurements made from the single-epoch and coadded spectra, focusing\non the CIV emission line because of its importance for studies of high-redshift\nquasar demographics and physical properties, including black hole masses. In\naddition to statistical errors increasing (by factors of ~2-4), we find\nincreasing systematic offsets with decreasing S/N. The systematic difference\n(measurement uncertainty) in our lowest S/N (<5) subsample between the\nsingle-epoch and coadded spectrum (i) CIV equivalent width is 17A (31A), (ii)\ncentroid wavelength is <1A (2A), and fractional velocity widths, Delta V/V,\ncharacterized by (iii) the line dispersion, sigma_l, is 0.104 (0.12), and (iv)\nthe mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 0.072 (0.11). These remain smaller than\nthe 1-sigma measurement uncertainties for all subsamples considered. The MAD is\nfound to be the most robust line-width characterization. Offsets in the CIV\nfull-width at half maximum (FWHM) velocity width and the CIV profile\ncharacterized by FWHM/sigma_l are only smaller than the statistical\nuncertainties when S/N>10, although offsets in lower S/N spectra exceed the\nstatistical uncertainties by only a factor of ~1.5. Characterizing the CIV line\nprofile by the kurtosis is the least robust property investigated, as the\nmedian systematic coadded--single-epoch measurement differences are larger than\nthe statistical uncertainties for all S/N subsamples.\n", "  The resistance of a metal in a magnetic field can be very illuminating about\nits ground state. Some famous examples include the integer and fractional\nquantum Hall effects\\cite{Klitzing-QHE,Tsui-FQHE}, Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations\\cite{SdH}, and weak localization\\cite{Lee-WL} \\emph{et al}. In\nnon-interacting metals the resistance typically increases upon the application\nof a magnetic field\\cite{Pippard-MR}. In contrast, in some special\ncircumstances metals, with anisotropic Fermi surfaces\\cite{Kikugawa-PdCoO2LMR}\nor a so-called Weyl semimetal for instance\\cite{Nielsen-ABJ,Son-ChirAnom}, may\nhave negative magnetoresistance. Here we show that semimetallic TaAs$_2$\npossesses a gigantic negative magnetoresistance ($-$98\\% in a field of 3 T at\nlow temperatures), with an unknown mechanism. Density functional calculations\nillustrate that TaAs$_2$ is a new topological semimetal [$\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ninvariant (0;111)] without a Dirac dispersion. This demonstrates that the\npresence of negative magnetoresistance in non-magnetic semimetals cannot be\nuniquely attributed to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of bulk Dirac/Weyl\nfermions. Our results also imply that the OsGe$_2$-type monoclinic dipnictides\nare likely a material basis where unconventional topological semimetals may be\nfound.\n", "  A brief historical introduction for the enigmatic number Zero is given. The\ndiscussions are for popular consumption.\n", "  We survey the properties of stars destroyed in TDEs as a function of BH mass,\nstellar mass and evolutionary state, star formation history and redshift. For\nMbh<10^7Msun, the typical TDE is due to a M*~0.3Msun M-dwarf, although the mass\nfunction is relatively flat for $M*<Msun. The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses. However, any emission mechanism which\nis largely Eddington-limited for low BH masses suppresses this divergence in\nany observed sample and leads to TDE samples dominated by Mbh~10^6.0-10^7.5Msun\nBHs with roughly Eddington peak accretion rates. The typical fall back time is\nrelatively long, with 16% having Tfb<10^(-1) years (37 days), and 84% having\nlonger time scales. Many residual rate discrepancies can be explained if\nsurveys are biased against TDEs with these longer Tfb, which seems very\nplausible if Tfb has any relation to the transient rise time. For almost any BH\nmass function, systematic searches for fainter, faster time scale TDEs in\nsmaller galaxies, and longer time scale TDEs in more massive galaxies are\nlikely to be rewarded.\n", "  Hawking radiation has been regarded as a more general phenomenon than in\ngravitational physics, in particular in laboratory analogs of the event\nhorizon. Here we consider the fiber-optical analog of the event horizon, where\nintense light pulses in fibers establish horizons for probe light. Then, we\ncalculate the Hawking spectrum in an experimentally realizable system. We found\nthat the Hawking radiation is peaked around group-velocity horizons in which\nthe speed of the pulse matches the group velocity of the probe light. The\nradiation nearly vanishes at the phase horizon where the speed of the pulse\nmatches the phase velocity of light.\n", "  As most materials available in macroscopic quantities, graphene appears in a\npolycrystalline form and thus contains grain boundaries. In the present work,\nthe effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic transport properties through\ngraphene grain boundaries is investigated using atomistic simulations. A\nsystematic picture of the transport properties with respect to the strain and\nthe lattice symmetry of graphene domains on both sides of the boundary is\nprovided. In particular, it is shown that the strain engineering can be used to\nopen a finite transport gap in all graphene systems where two domains exhibit\ndifferent orientations. This gap value is found to depend on the strain\nmagnitude, on the strain direction and on the lattice symmetry of graphene\ndomains. By choosing appropriately the strain direction, a large transport gap\nof a few hundred meV can be achieved when applying a small strain of only a few\npercents. For a specific class of graphene grain boundary systems, the strain\nengineering can also be used to reduce the scattering on defects and hence to\nsignificantly enhance the conductance. With a large strain-induced gap, these\ngraphene heterostructures are proposed to be possible candidates for highly\nsensitive strain sensors, flexible transistors and p-n junctions with a strong\nnon-linear I-V characteristics.\n", "  \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} is a highly pixelated direct charge sensor that\ncontains a 72${\\times}$72 pixel array of 83${\\mu}$m pitch size. The key feature\nof \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} is that it can directly collect charges via metal\nnodes of each pixel to form two-dimensional images of charge cloud\ndistributions. \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} was proved to measure charged\nparticles without amplification at room temperature. To measure its performance\nat cryogenic temperature, a \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} sensor is embedded into\na liquid nitrogen dewar. The results presented in this paper show that\n\\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} can also operate well at this low temperature with a\nnoise (ENC) of 12 e$^-$ lower than that at room temperature (13 e$^-$). From\nthe noise perspective, \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} is a promising candidate for\nthe next generation readout of liquid argon and xenon Time Projection Chamber\n(TPC) used in experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay and dark\nmatter.\n", "  In quantum mechanics, a particle is best described by the wave packet instead\nof the plane wave. Here, we study the wave-packet scattering problem in Weyl\nsemimetals with the low-energy Weyl fermions of different chiralities. Our\nresults show that the wave packet acquires a chirality-protected shift in the\nsingle impurity scattering process. More importantly, the chirality-protected\nshift can lead to an anomalous scattering probability, thus, affects the\ntransport properties in Weyl semimetals. We find that the ratio between the\ntransport lifetime and the quantum lifetime increases sharply when the Fermi\nenergy approaches to the Weyl nodes, providing an explanation on the\nexperimentally observed the ultrahigh mobility in topological (Weyl or Dirac)\nsemimetals.\n", "  In this report we demonstrate a novel concept for a planar cavity polariton\nbeam amplifier using non-resonant excitation. In contrast to resonant\nexcitation schemes, background carriers are injected which form excitons,\nproviding both gain and a repulsive potential for a polariton condensate. Using\nan attractive potential environment induced by a locally elongated cavity\nlayer, the repulsive potential of the injected background carriers is\ncompensated and a significant amplification of polariton beams is achieved\nwithout beam distortion.\n", "  The certification of Bell nonlocality or quantum steering implies the use of\nincompatible measurements. Here we make this connection quantitative. We show\nhow to strengthen robustness-based steering and nonlocality quantifiers in\norder that they give strong lower bounds to previously proposed incompatibility\nquantifiers. Our results can be seen from two perspectives. On the one hand,\nthey can be used to estimate how much steering or nonlocality can be\ndemonstrated with a given set of measurements. On the other hand, they gives\none-sided device-independent and device-independent ways of estimating\nmeasurement incompatibility.\n", "  We confirm the planetary nature of two transiting hot Jupiters discovered by\nthe Kepler spacecraft's K2 extended mission in its Campaign 4, using precise\nradial velocity measurements from FIES@NOT, HARPS-N@TNG, and the coud\\'e\nspectrograph on the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m telescope. K2-29 b (EPIC\n211089792 b) transits a K1V star with a period of $3.2589263\\pm0.0000015$ days;\nits orbit is slightly eccentric ($e=0.084_{-0.023}^{+0.032}$). It has a radius\nof $R_P=1.000_{-0.067}^{+0.071}$ $R_J$ and a mass of\n$M_P=0.613_{-0.026}^{+0.027}$ $M_J$. Its host star exhibits significant\nrotational variability, and we measure a rotation period of\n$P_{\\mathrm{rot}}=10.777 \\pm 0.031$ days.

However, this technique, and essentially all spectroscopic\nmethods, is limited in application to relatively small, simple molecules. Here\nwe integrate comb spectroscopy with continuous, cold samples of molecules\nproduced via buffer gas cooling, thus enabling the study of significantly more\ncomplex molecules. We report simultaneous gains in resolution, sensitivity, and\nbandwidth and demonstrate this combined capability with the first rotationally\nresolved direct absorption spectra in the CH stretch region of several complex\nmolecules. These include nitromethane (CH$_3$NO$_2$), a model system that\npresents challenging questions to the understanding of large amplitude\nvibrational motion, as well as several large organic molecules with fundamental\nspectroscopic and astrochemical relevance, including naphthalene\n(C$_{10}$H$_8$), adamantane (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$), and hexamethylenetetramine\n(C$_{6}$N$_4$H$_{12}$). This general spectroscopic tool has the potential to\nsignificantly impact the field of molecular spectroscopy, simultaneously\nimproving efficiency, spectral resolution, and specificity by orders of\nmagnitude. This realization could open up new molecular species and new\nkinetics for precise investigations, including the study of complex molecules,\nweakly bound clusters, and cold chemistry.\n", "  Interlayer excitons, comprising an electron in one material bound by Coulomb\nattraction to a hole in an adjacent material, are composite bosons that can\nassume a variety of many-body phases. The phase diagram of the bosonic system\nis largely determined by the dispersion relation of the bosons, which itself\narises as a combination of the dispersion relations of the electron and hole\nseparately. Here I show that in situations where either the electron or the\nhole has a non-monotonic, \"Mexican hat-shaped\" dispersion relation, the exciton\ndispersion relation can have a range of qualitatively different forms, each\ncorresponding to a different many-body phase at low temperature. This diversity\nsuggests a novel platform for continuously tuning between different quantum\nphases using an external field.\n", "  The ground state of the Dirac one-electron atom, placed in a weak, static\nelectric field of definite $2^{L}$-polarity, is studied within the framework of\nthe first-order perturbation theory. The Sturmian expansion of the generalized\nDirac-Coulomb Green function [R. Szmytkowski, J. Phys. B 30 (1997) 825,\nerratum: 30 (1997) 2747] is used to derive closed-form analytical expressions\nfor various far-field and near-nucleus static electric multipole\nsusceptibilities of the atom. The far-field multipole susceptibilities --- the\npolarizabilities $\\alpha_{L}$, electric-to-magnetic cross-susceptibilities\n$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{E}L\\to\\mathrm{M}(L\\mp1)}$ and electric-to-toroidal-magnetic\ncross-susceptibilities $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{E}L\\to\\mathrm{T}L}$ --- are found to be\nexpressible in terms of one or two non-terminating generalized hypergeometric\nfunctions ${}_{3}F_{2}$ with the unit argument. Counterpart formulas for the\nnear-nucleus multipole susceptibilities --- the electric nuclear shielding\nconstants $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{E}L\\to\\mathrm{E}L}$, near-nucleus\nelectric-to-magnetic cross-susceptibilities\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{E}L\\to\\mathrm{M}(L\\mp1)}$ and near-nucleus\nelectric-to-toroidal-magnetic cross-susceptibilities\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{E}L\\to\\mathrm{T}L}$ --- involve terminating ${}_{3}F_{2}(1)$\nseries and for each $L$ may be rewritten in terms of elementary functions.\nExact numerical values of the far-field dipole, quadrupole, octupole and\nhexadecapole susceptibilities are provided for selected hydrogenic ions.\nAnalytical quasi-relativistic approximations, valid to the second order in\n$\\alpha Z$, where $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the\nnuclear charge number, are derived for all types of the far-field and\nnear-nucleus susceptibilities considered in the paper.\n", "  In string theory compactifications it is common to find an effective\nLagrangian for the scalar fields with a non-canonical kinetic term. We study\nthe effective action of the scalar position moduli of Type II D$p$-branes. In\nmany instances the kinetic terms are in fact modified by a term proportional to\nthe scalar potential itself. This can be linked to the appearance of\nhigher-dimensional supersymmetric operators correcting the K\\\"ahler potential.\nWe identify the supersymmetric dimension-eight operators describing the\n$\\alpha'$ corrections captured by the D-brane Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Our\nanalysis then allows an embedding of the D-brane moduli effective action into\nan $\\mathcal N = 1$ supergravity formulation. The effects of the\npotential-dependent kinetic terms may be very important if one of the scalars\nis the inflaton, since they lead to a flattening of the scalar potential. We\nanalyze this flattening effect in detail and compute its impact on the CMB\nobservables for single-field inflation with monomial potentials.\n", "  We study analytically the free induction decay and the spin echo decay\noriginating from the localized carriers moving between the sites which host\nrandom magnetic fields. Due to disorder in the site positions and energies, the\non-site residence times, \\tau, are widely spread according to the Levy\ndistribution. The power-law tail \\propto \\tau^{-1-\\alpha} in the distribution\nof waiting times does not affect the conventional spectral narrowing for \\alpha\n>2, but leads to a dramatic acceleration of the free induction decay in the\ndomain 2>\\alpha >1. The next abrupt acceleration of the decay takes place as\nthe tail parameter, \\alpha, becomes smaller than 1. In the latter domain the\ndecay does not follow a simple-exponent law. To capture the behavior of the\naverage spin in this domain, we solve the evolution equation for the average\nspin using the approach different from the conventional approach based on the\nLaplace transform. Unlike the free induction decay, the tail in the\ndistribution of the residence times leads to the slow decay of the spin echo.\nThe echo is dominated by realizations of the carrier motion for which the\nnumber of sites, visited by the carrier, is minimal.\n", "  Cosmological constraints on the scalar-tensor theory of gravity by analyzing\nthe angular power spectrum data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobtained from the Planck 2015 results are presented. We consider the harmonic\nattractor model, in which the scalar field has a harmonic potential with\ncurvature ($\\beta$) in the Einstein frame and the theory relaxes toward the\nEinstein gravity with time. Analyzing the {\\it TT}, {\\it EE}, {\\it TE} and\nlensing CMB data from Planck by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we find\nthat the present-day deviation from the Einstein gravity (${\\alpha_0}^2$) is\nconstrained as ${\\alpha_0}^2<2.5\\times10^{-4-4.5\\beta^2}\\ (95.45\\% {\\rm\\\nC.L.})$ and ${\\alpha_0}^2<6.3\\times10^{-4-4.5\\beta^2}\\ (99.99\\%\\ {\\rm C.L.})$\nfor $0<\\beta<0.4$. The time variation of the effective gravitational constant\nbetween the recombination and the present epochs is constrained as $G_{\\rm\nrec}/G_0<1.0056\\ (95.45\\% {\\rm\\ C.L.})$ and $G_{\\rm rec}/G_0<1.0115\\ (99.99\n\\%{\\rm\\ C.L.})$. We also find that the constraints are little affected by\nextending to nonflat cosmological models because the diffusion damping effect\nrevealed by Planck breaks the degeneracy of the projection effect.\n", "  Doubled $\\alpha'$-geometry is the simplest higher-derivative gravitational\ntheory with exact global duality symmetry. We use the double metric formulation\nof this theory to compute on-shell three-point functions to all orders in\n$\\alpha'$. A simple pattern emerges when comparing with the analogous bosonic\nand heterotic three-point functions. As in these theories, the amplitudes\nfactorize. The theory has no Gauss-Bonnet term, but contains a Riemann-cubed\ninteraction to second order in $\\alpha'$.\n", "  We study the detectability of the stoponium in the di-Higgs decay mode at the\nphoton-photon collider option of the International $e^+e^-$ Linear Collider\n(ILC), whose center-of-mass energy is planned to reach $\\sim 1$ TeV. We find\nthat $5\\sigma$ detection of the di-Higgs decay mode is possible with the\nintegrated electron-beam luminosity of $1 {\\rm ab}^{-1}$ if the signal cross\nsection, $\\sigma(\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\sigma_{\\tilde{t}_1} \\rightarrow\nhh)$, of ${\\cal O}(0.1)$ fb is realized for the stoponium mass smaller than\n$\\sim$ 800 GeV at 1 TeV ILC. Such a value of the cross section can be realized\nin the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with relatively large\ntrilinear stop-stop-Higgs coupling constant. Implication of the stoponium cross\nsection measurement for the MSSM stop sector is also discussed.\n", "  Nanowires of two-dimensional (2D) crystals of type-II superconductor NbSe$_2$\nprepared by electron-beam lithography were studied, focusing on the effect of\nthe motion of Abrikosov vortices. We present magnetoresistance measurements on\nthese nanowires and show features related to vortex crossing, trapping, and\npinning. The vortex crossing rate was found to vary non-monotonically with the\napplied field, which results in non-monotonic magnetoresistance variations in\nagreement with theoretical calculations in the London approximation. Above the\nlower critical field, $H_{c1}$, the crossing rate is also influenced by\nvortices trapped by sample boundaries or pinning centers, leading to\nsample-specific magnetoresistance patterns. We show that the local pinning\npotential can be modified by intentionally introducing surface adsorbates,\nmaking the magnetoresistance pattern a \"magneto fingerprint\" of the\nsample-specific configuration of vortex pinning centers in a 2D crystal\nsuperconducting nanowire.\n", "  We study the many-body localization aspects of single-particle mobility edges\nin fermionic systems. We investigate incommensurate lattices and random\ndisorder Anderson models. Many-body localization and quantum nonergodic\nproperties are studied by comparing entanglement and thermal entropy, and by\ncalculating the scaling of subsystem particle number fluctuations,\nrespectively. We establish a nonergodic extended phase as a generic\nintermediate phase (between purely ergodic extended and nonergodic localized\nphases) for the many-body localization transition of non-interacting fermions\nwhere the entanglement entropy manifests a volume law (`extended'), but there\nare large fluctuations in the subsystem particle numbers (`nonergodic'). We\nargue such an intermediate phase scenario may continue holding even for the\nmany-body localization in the presence of interactions as well. We find for\nmany-body states in non-interacting 1d Aubry-Andre and 3d Anderson models that\nthe entanglement entropy density and the normalized particle-number fluctuation\nhave discontinuous jumps at the localization transition where the entanglement\nentropy is sub-thermal but obeys the \"volume law\". In the vicinity of the\nlocalization transition we find that both the entanglement entropy and the\nparticle number fluctuations obey a single parameter scaling. We argue using\nnumerical and theoretical results that such a critical scaling behavior should\npersist for the interacting many-body localization problem with important\nconsequences. Our work provides persuasive evidence in favor of there being two\ntransitions in many-body systems with single-particle mobility edges, the first\none indicating a transition from the purely localized nonergodic many-body\nlocalized phase to a nonergodic extended many-body metallic phase, and the\nsecond one being a transition eventually to the usual ergodic many-body\nextended phase.\n", "  It has been found that photospheric magnetic fields can change in accordance\nwith the three-dimensional magnetic field restructuring following solar\neruptions. Previous studies mainly use vector magnetic field data taken for\nevents near the disk center. In this paper, we analyze the magnetic field\nevolution associated with the 2012 October 23 X1.8 flare in NOAA AR 11598 that\nis close to the solar limb, using both the 45 s cadence line-of-sight and 12\nminute cadence vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on\nboard Solar Dynamic Observatory. This flare is classified as a circular-ribbon\nflare with spine-fan type magnetic topology containing a null point. In the\nline-of-sight magnetograms, there are two apparent polarity inversion lines\n(PIL). The PIL closer to the limb is affected more by the projection effect.\nBetween these two PILs there lie positive polarity magnetic fields, which are\nsurrounded by negative polarity fields outside the PILs. We find that after the\nflare, both the apparent limb-ward and disk-ward negative fluxes decrease,\nwhile the positive flux in-between increases. We also find that the horizontal\nmagnetic fields have a significant increase along the disk-ward PIL, while in\nsurrounding area, they decrease. Synthesizing the observed field changes, we\nconclude that the magnetic fields collapse toward the surface above the\ndisk-ward PIL as depicted in the coronal implosion scenario, while the\nperipheral field turns to a more vertical configuration after the flare. We\nalso suggest that this event is an asymmetric circular-ribbon flare: a flux\nrope is likely present above the disk-ward PIL. Its eruption causes the\ninstability of the entire fan-spine structure and the implosion near that PIL.\n", "  Quantum impurity problems can be solved using the numerical renormalization\ngroup (NRG), which involves discretizing the free conduction electron system\nand mapping to a `Wilson chain'. It was shown recently that Wilson chains for\ndifferent electronic species can be interleaved by use of a modified\ndiscretization, dramatically increasing the numerical efficiency of the RG\nscheme [Phys. Rev. B 89, 121105(R) (2014)]. Here we systematically examine the\naccuracy and efficiency of the `interleaved' NRG (iNRG) method in the context\nof the single impurity Anderson model, the two-channel Kondo model, and a\nthree-channel Anderson-Hund model. The performance of iNRG is explicitly\ncompared with `standard' NRG (sNRG): when the average number of states kept per\niteration is the same in both calculations, the accuracy of iNRG is equivalent\nto that of sNRG but the computational costs are signifficantly lower in iNRG\nwhen the same symmetries are exploited. Although iNRG weakly breaks SU(N)\nchannel symmetry (if present), both accuracy and numerical cost are entirely\ncompetitive with sNRG exploiting full symmetries. iNRG is therefore shown to be\na viable and technically simple alternative to sNRG for high-symmetry models.\nMoreover, iNRG can be used to solve a range of lower-symmetry multiband\nproblems that are inaccessible to sNRG.\n", "  A generic prediction of scenarios with extra dimensions accessible in\nTeV-scale collisions is the existence of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the\ngraviton. For a broad class of strongly-warped scenarios one expects to\ninitially find an isolated resonance, whose phenomenology in the simplest cases\nis described by a simplified model with two parameters, its mass, and a\nconstant $\\Lambda$ with units of mass parameterizing its coupling to the\nStandard Model stress tensor. These parameters are in turn determined by the\ngeometrical configuration of the warped compactification. We explore the\npossibility that the 750 GeV excess recently seen in 13 TeV data at ATLAS and\nCMS could be such a warped Kaluza-Klein graviton, and find a best-fit value\n$\\Lambda\\approx 60$ TeV. We find that while there is some tension between this\ninterpretation and data from 8 TeV and from the dilepton channel at 13 TeV, it\nis not strongly excluded. However, in the simplest scenarios of this kind, such\na signal should soon become apparent in both diphoton and dilepton channels.\n", "  We show that a large class of gapless states are renormalization group fixed\npoints in the sense that they can be grown scale by scale using local\nunitaries. This class of examples includes some theories with dynamical\nexponent different from one, but does not include conformal field theories. The\nkey property of the states we consider is that the ground state wavefunction is\nrelated to the statistical weight of a local statistical model. We give several\nexamples of our construction in the context of Ising magnetism.\n", "  A search for supersymmetry in hadronic final states with highly boosted W\nbosons and b jets is presented, focusing on compressed scenarios. The search is\nperformed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8\nTeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Events containing candidates for\nhadronic decays of boosted W bosons are identified using jet substructure\ntechniques, and are analyzed using the razor variables M[R] and R^2, which\ncharacterize a possible signal as a peak on a smoothly falling background. The\nobserved event yields in the signal regions are found to be consistent with the\nexpected contributions from standard model processes, which are predicted using\ncontrol samples in the data. The results are interpreted in terms of\ngluino-pair production followed by their exclusive decay into top squarks and\ntop quarks. The analysis excludes gluino masses up to 1.1 TeV for light top\nsquarks decaying solely to a charm quark and a neutralino, and up to 700 GeV\nfor heavier top squarks decaying solely to a top quark and a neutralino.\n", "  We put forward nonadiabatic charge pumping as a method for accessing the\ndifferent charge relaxation rates as well as the relaxation rates of excited\norbital states in double-quantum-dot setups, based on extremely size-limited\nquantum dots and dopant systems. The rates are obtained in a well-separated\nmanner from plateaus, occurring when comparing the steady-state current for\nreversed driving cycles. This yields a reliable readout independent of any\nfitting parameters. Importantly, the nonadiabatic pumping spectroscopy\nessentially exploits the same driving scheme as the operation of these devices\ngenerally employs. We provide a detailed analysis of the working principle of\nthe readout scheme as well as of possible errors, thereby demonstrating its\nbroad applicability. The precise knowledge of relaxation rates is highly\nrelevant for the implementation of time-dependently operated devices, such as\nelectron pumps for metrology or qubits in quantum information.\n", "  We simulate the dissipative evolution of a vortex in a trapped\nfinite-temperature dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensate using first-principles\nopen-systems theory. Simulations of the complete stochastic projected\nGross-Pitaevskii equation for a partially condensed Bose gas containing a\nsingle quantum vortex show that the transfer of condensate energy to the\nincoherent thermal component without population transfer provides an important\nchannel for vortex decay. For the lower temperatures considered, this effect is\nsignificantly larger that the population transfer process underpinning the\nstandard theory of vortex decay, and is the dominant determinant of the vortex\nlifetime. A comparison with the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin kinetic (two-fluid)\ntheory further elucidates the role of the particle transfer interaction, and\nsuggests the need for experimental testing of reservoir interaction theory. The\ndominance of this particular energetic decay mechanism for this open quantum\nsystem should be testable with current experimental setups, and its observation\nwould have broad implications for the dynamics of atomic matter waves and\nexperimental studies of dissipative phenomena.\n", "  Searching for gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black holes (BBHs) with\nLIGO and Virgo involves matched-filtering data against a set of representative\nsignal waveforms --- a template bank --- chosen to cover the full signal space\nof interest with as few template waveforms as possible. Although the component\nblack holes may have significant angular momenta (spin), previous searches for\nBBHs have filtered LIGO and Virgo data using only waveforms where both\ncomponent spins are zero. This leads to a loss of signal-to-noise ratio for\nsignals where this is not the case. Combining the best available template\nplacement techniques and waveform models, we construct a template bank of GW\nsignals from BBHs with component spins $\\chi_{1,2}\\in [-0.99, 0.99]$ aligned\nwith the orbital angular momentum, component masses $m_{1,2}\\in [2,\n48]\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, and total mass $M_\\mathrm{total} \\leq\n50\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Using effective-one-body waveforms with spin effects, we\nshow that less than $3\\%$ of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these\nsignals is lost due to the discreetness of the bank, using the early advanced\nLIGO noise curve. We use simulated advanced LIGO noise to compare the\nsensitivity of this bank to a non-spinning bank covering the same parameter\nspace. In doing so, we consider the competing effects between improved SNR and\nsignal-based vetoes, and the increase in the rate of false alarms of the\naligned-spin bank due to covering a larger parameter space. We find that the\naligned-spin bank can be a factor of $1.3$ -- $5$ more sensitive than a\nnon-spinning bank to BBHs with dimensionless spins $> +0.6$ and component\nmasses $\\gtrsim 20\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Even larger gains are obtained for\nsystems with equally high spins but smaller component masses.\n", "  Observations have revealed a relative paucity of red giant (RG) stars within\nthe central 0.5pc in the Galactic Center (GC). Motivated by this finding we\ninvestigate the hypothesis that collisions of stars with a fragmenting\naccretion disk are responsible for the observed dearth of evolved stars. We use\n3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model a star with radius $10\nR_{\\odot}$ and mass $1 M_{\\odot}$, representative of the missing population of\nRGs, colliding with high density clumps. We find that multiple collisions with\nclumps of column density $\\gtrsim10^{8}\\, {\\rm g\\,cm^{-2}}$ can strip a\nsubstantial fraction of the star's envelope and in principle render it\ninvisible to observations. Simulations confirm that repeated impacts are\nparticularly efficient in driving mass loss as partially stripped RGs expand\nand have increased cross sections for subsequent collisions. Because the\nenvelope is unbound on account of the kinetic energy of the star, any\nsignificant amount of stripping of the RG population in the GC should be\nmirrored by a systematic decay of their orbits and possibly by their enhanced\nrotational velocity. To be viable, this scenario requires that the total mass\nof the fragmenting disk has been several orders of magnitude higher than that\nof the early type stars which now form the stellar disk in the GC.\n", "  We present a comprehensive and updated comparison with cosmological\nobservations of two non-local modifications of gravity previously introduced by\nour group, the so called RR and RT models. We implement the background\nevolution and the cosmological perturbations of the models in a modified\nBoltzmann code, using CLASS. We then test the non-local models against the {\\em\nPlanck} 2015 TT, TE, EE and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing data,\nisotropic and anisotropic Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, JLA\nsupernovae, $H_0$ measurements and growth rate data, and we perform Bayesian\nparameter estimation. We then compare the RR, RT and $\\Lambda$CDM models, using\nthe Savage-Dickey method. We find that the RT model and $\\Lambda$CDM perform\nequally well, while the performance of the RR model with respect to\n$\\Lambda$CDM depends on whether or not we include a prior on $H_0$ based on\nlocal measurements.\n", "  In order to quantify the error budget in the measured probability\ndistribution functions of cell densities, the two-point statistics of cosmic\ndensities in concentric spheres is investigated. Bias functions are introduced\nas the ratio of their two-point correlation function to the two-point\ncorrelation of the underlying dark matter distribution. They describe how cell\ndensities are spatially correlated. They are computed here via the so-called\nlarge deviation principle in the quasi-linear regime. Their large-separation\nlimit is presented and successfully compared to simulations for density and\ndensity slopes: this regime is shown to be rapidly reached allowing to get\nsub-percent precision for a wide range of densities and variances. The\ncorresponding asymptotic limit provides an estimate of the cosmic variance of\nstandard concentric cell statistics applied to finite surveys. More generally,\nno assumption on the separation is required for some specific moments of the\ntwo-point statistics, for instance when predicting the generating function of\ncumulants containing any powers of concentric densities in one location and one\npower of density at some arbitrary distance from the rest. This exact \"one\nexternal leg\" cumulant generating function is used in particular to probe the\nrate of convergence of the large-separation approximation.\n", "  When Chen et al. (2015, Acta Mater. 87, 78-85) investigated the deformation\nbehavior of oligocrystalline gold microwires with varying diameters in both\nuniaxial tension and torsion, contrary size effects were observed for the\ndifferent load cases. In accompanying microstructural studies it was found,\nthat the microwires of different thickness reveal distinctive differences in\ngrain size and texture, respectively. As a consequence, a significant influence\nof these microstructural variations on the determined size effects was assumed.\nHowever, within the frame of their work, a direct confirmation could only be\npresented for the effect of the grain size. In the present work, the\nsize-dependent mechanical response of the microwires is modeled with a gradient\nplasticity theory. By finite element simulations of simplified grain\naggregates, the influence of the texture on the size effects is investigated\nunder both loading conditions. It is shown that the experimentally observed\ncontrary size effects can only be reproduced when taking into account the\nindividual textures of the microwires of different thickness within the\nmodeling.\n", "  We studied effect of finite quark mass on the dynamics of axial charge using\nthe D3/D7 model in holography. The mass term in axial anomaly equation affects\nboth the fluctuation (generation) and dissipation of axial charge. We studied\nthe dependence of the effect on quark mass and external magnetic field. For\naxial charge generation, we calculated the mass diffusion rate, which\ncharacterizes the helicity flipping rate. The rate is a non-monotonous function\nof mass and can be significantly enhanced by the magnetic field. The diffusive\nbehavior is also related to a divergent susceptibility of axial charge. For\naxial charge dissipation, we found that in the long time limit, the mass term\ndissipates all the charge effectively generated by parallel electric and\nmagnetic fields. The result is consistent with a relaxation time approximation.\nThe rate of dissipation through mass term is a monotonous increasing function\nof both quark mass and magnetic field.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the investigation of (1) the transport properties\nof multi-carriers in semi-metal Bi and (2) the spin conversion physics in this\nsemimetal system in a ferrimagnetic insulator, yttrium-iron-garnet. Hall\nmeasurements reveal that electrons and holes co-exist in the Bi, with electrons\nbeing the dominant carrier. The results of a spin conversion experiment\ncorroborate the results of the Hall measurement; in addition, the inverse spin\nHall effect governs the spin conversion in the semimetal/insulator system. This\nstudy provides further insights into spin conversion physics in semimetal\nsystems.\n", "  We report initial results of a deep search for an optical counterpart to the\ngravitational wave event GW150914, the first trigger from the Advanced LIGO\ngravitational wave detectors. We used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to image a\n102 deg$^2$ area, corresponding to 38% of the initial trigger high-probability\nsky region and to 11% of the revised high-probability region. We observed in i\nand z bands at 4-5, 7, and 24 days after the trigger. The median $5\\sigma$\npoint-source limiting magnitudes of our search images are i=22.5 and z=21.8\nmag. We processed the images through a difference-imaging pipeline using\ntemplates from pre-existing Dark Energy Survey data and publicly available\nDECam data. Due to missing template observations and other losses, our\neffective search area subtends 40 deg$^{2}$, corresponding to 12% total\nprobability in the initial map and 3% of the final map. In this area, we search\nfor objects that decline significantly between days 4-5 and day 7, and are\nundetectable by day 24, finding none to typical magnitude limits of i=\n21.5,21.1,20.1 for object colors (i-z)=1,0,-1, respectively. Our search\ndemonstrates the feasibility of a dedicated search program with DECam and bodes\nwell for future research in this emerging field.\n", "  The collapse of the core of a star is expected to produce gravitational\nradiation. While this process will usually produce a luminous supernova, the\noptical signatue could be subluminous and a direct collapse to a black hole,\nwith the star just disappearing, is possible. The gravitational wave event\nGW150914 reported by the LIGO Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2015 September 16,\nwas detected by a burst analysis and whose high probability spatial\nlocalization included the Large Magellanic Cloud. Shortly after the\nannouncement of the event, we used the Dark Energy Camera to observe 102\ndeg$^2$ of the localization area, including a 38 deg$^2$ area centered on the\nLMC. Using a catalog of 152 LMC luminous red supergiants, candidates to undergo\na core collapse without a visible supernova, we find that the positions of 144\nof these are inside our images, and that all are detected - none have\ndisappeared. There are other classes of candidates: we searched existing\ncatalogs of red supergiants, yellow supergiants, Wolf-Rayet stars, and luminous\nblue variable stars, recovering all that were inside the imaging area. Based on\nour observations, we conclude that it is unlikely that GW150914 was caused by\nthe core collapse of a supergiant in the LMC, consistent with the LIGO\nCollaboration analyses of the gravitational wave form as best described by a\nbinary black hole merger. We discuss how to generalize this search for future\nvery nearby core collapse candidates.\n", "  Accreting highly magnetized pulsars in binary systems are among the brightest\nX-ray emitters in our Galaxy. Although a number of high statistical quality\nbroad-band (0.1-100 keV) X-ray observations are available, the spectral energy\ndistribution of these sources is usually investigated by adopting pure\nphenomenological models, rather than models linked to the physics of accretion.\nIn this paper, a detailed spectral study of the X-ray emission recorded from\nthe high-mass X-ray binary pulsars Cen X-3, 4U 0115+63, and Her X-1 is carried\nout by using BeppoSAX and joined Suzaku+NuStar data, together with an advanced\nversion of the compmag model. The latter provides a physical description of the\nhigh energy emission from accreting pulsars, including the thermal and bulk\nComptonization of cyclotron and bremsstrahlung seed photons along the neutron\nstar accretion column. The compmag model is based on an iterative method for\nsolving second-order partial differential equations, whose convergence\nalgorithm has been improved and consolidated during the preparation of this\npaper. Our analysis shows that the broad-band X-ray continuum of all considered\nsources can be self-consistently described by the compmag model. The cyclotron\nabsorption features, not included in the model, can be accounted for by using\nGaussian components. From the fits of the compmag model to the data we inferred\nthe physical properties of the accretion columns in all sources, finding values\nreasonably close to those theoretically expected according to our current\nunderstanding of accretion in highly magnetized neutron stars. The updated\nversion of the compmag model has been tailored to the physical processes that\nare known to occur in the columns of highly magnetized accreting neutron stars\nand it can thus provide a better understanding of the high energy radiation\nfrom these sources.\n", "  We report our detailed data analysis for 39 $\\gamma$-ray sources selected\nfrom the 992 unassociated sources in the \\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) third source catalog. The selection criteria, which were set for finding\ncandidate millisecond pulsars (MSPs), are non-variables with curved spectra and\n$>$5$^{\\circ}$ Galactic latitudes. From our analysis, 24 sources were found to\nbe point-like sources not contaminated by background or nearby unknown sources.\nThree of them, J1544.6$-$1125, J1625.1$-$0021, and J1653.6$-$0158, have been\npreviously studied, indicating that they are likely MSPs. The spectra of\nJ0318.1+0252 and J2053.9+2922 do not have properties similar to that of known\n$\\gamma$-ray MSPs, and we thus suggest that they are not MSPs. Analysis of\narchival X-ray data for most of the 24 sources were also conducted. Four\nsources were found with X-ray objects in their error circles, and 16 with no\ndetection. The ratios between the $\\gamma$-ray fluxes and X-ray fluxes or flux\nupper limits are generally lower than those of the known $\\gamma$-ray MSPs,\nsuggesting that if the $\\gamma$-ray sources are MSPs, none of the X-ray objects\nare the counterparts. Deep X-ray or radio observations of these sources are\nneeded in order to identify their MSP nature.\n", "  We introduce a quantum-like classical computational model, called affine\ncomputation, as a generalization of probabilistic computation. After giving the\nbasics of affine computation, we define affine finite automata (AfA) and\ncompare it with quantum and probabilistic finite automata (QFA and PFA,\nrespectively) with respect to three basic language recognition modes. We show\nthat, in the cases of bounded and unbounded error, AfAs are more powerful than\nQFAs and PFAs, and, in the case of nondeterministic computation, AfAs are more\npowerful than PFAs but equivalent to QFAs.\n", "  Phases of gravitational instability are expected in the early phases of disk\nevolution, when the disk mass is still a substantial fraction of the mass of\nthe star. Disk fragmentation into sub-stellar objects could occur in the cold\nexterior part of the disk. Direct detection of massive gaseous clumps on their\nway to collapse into gas giant planets would offer an unprecedented test of the\ndisk instability model. Here we use state-of-the-art 3D radiation-hydro\nsimulations of disks undergoing fragmentation into massive gas giants,\npost-processed with the RADMC-3D ray-tracing code to produce dust continuum\nemission maps. These are then fed into the Common Astronomy Software\nApplications (CASA) ALMA simulator. The synthetic maps show that both overdense\nspiral arms and actual clumps at different stages of collapse can be detected\nwith the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) in the full\nconfiguration at the distance of the Ophiuchus star forming region (125 pc).\nThe detection of clumps is particularly effective at shorter wavelengths (690\nGHz) combining two resolutions with multi-scale clean. Furthermore, we show\nthat a flux-based estimate of the mass of a protoplanetary clump can be from\ncomparable to a factor of 3 higher than the gravitationally bound clump mass.\nThe estimated mass depends on the assumed opacity, and on the gas temperature,\nwhich should be set using the input of radiation-hydro simulations. We conclude\nthat ALMA has the capability to detect \"smoking gun\" systems that are a\nsignpost of the disk instability model for gas giant planet formation.\n", "  We study intensity disturbances above a solar polar coronal hole seen in the\nAIA 171 \\AA\\ and 193 \\AA\\ passbands, aiming to provide more insights into their\nphysical nature. The damping and power spectra of the intensity disturbances\nwith frequencies from 0.07 mHz to 10.5 mHz are investigated. The damping of the\nintensity disturbances tends to be stronger at lower frequencies, and their\ndamping behavior below 980\" (for comparison, the limb is at 945\") is different\nfrom what happens above. No significant difference is found between the damping\nof the intensity disturbances in the AIA 171 \\AA\\ and that in the AIA 193 \\AA.\nThe indices of the power spectra of the intensity disturbances are found to be\nslightly smaller in the AIA 171 \\AA\\ than in the AIA 193 \\AA, but the\ndifference is within one sigma deviation. An additional enhanced component is\npresent in the power spectra in a period range of 8--40 minutes at lower\nheights. While the power spectra of spicule is highly correlated with its\nassociated intensity disturbance, it suggests that the power spectra of the\nintensity disturbances might be a mixture of spicules and wave activities. We\nsuggest that each intensity disturbance in the polar coronal hole is possibly a\nseries of independent slow magnetoacoustic waves triggered by spicular\nactivities.\n", "  We introduce a simple scenario involving fermionic dark matter ($\\chi$) and\nsinglet scalar mediators that may account for the Galactic Center GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray excess while satisfying present direct detection constraints.\nCP-violation in the scalar potential leads to mixing between the Standard Model\nHiggs boson and the scalar singlet, resulting in three scalars $h_{1,2,3}$ of\nindefinite CP-transformation properties. This mixing enables s-wave\n$\\chi{\\bar\\chi}$ annihilation into di-scalar states, followed by decays into\nfour fermion final states. The observed $\\gamma$-ray spectrum can be fitted\nwhile respecting present direct detection bounds and Higgs boson properties for\n$m_{\\chi} = 60 \\sim 80 $ GeV, and $m_{h_3} \\sim m_{\\chi}$. Searches for the\nHiggs exotic decay channel $h_1 \\to h_3 h_3$ at the 14 TeV LHC should be able\nto further probe the parameter region favored by the $\\gamma$-ray excess.\n", "  We show that the edge states of the four-dimensional class A system can have\ntopological charges, which are characterized by Abelian/non-Abelian monopoles.\nThe edge topological charges are a new feature of relations among theories with\ndifferent dimensions. From this novel viewpoint, we provide a non-Abelian\nanalogue of the TKNN number as an edge topological charge, which is defined by\nan SU(2) 't Hooft-Polyakov BPS monopole through an equivalence to Nahm\nconstruction. Furthermore, putting a constant magnetic field yields an edge\nmonopole in a non-commutative momentum space, where D-brane methods in string\ntheory facilitate study of edge fermions.\n", "  In this paper the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons\nmethod (MCTDHB) is derived for the case of $N$ identical bosons with internal\ndegrees of freedom. The theory for bosons with internal degrees of freedom\nconstitutes a generalization of the MCTDHB method that substantially enriches\nthe many-body physics that can be described. We demonstrate that the\nnumerically exact solution of the time-dependent many-body Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for interacting bosonic particles with internal degrees of freedom is\nnow feasible. We report on the MCTDHB equations of motion for bosons with\ninternal degrees of freedom and their implementation for a general many-body\nHamiltonian with one-body and two-body terms that, both, may depend on the\ninternal states of the considered particles. To demonstrate the capabilities of\nthe theory and its software implementation integrated in the MCTDH-X software,\nwe apply MCTDHB to the emergence of fragmentation of parabolically trapped\nbosons with two internal states: we study the groundstate of $N=100$\nparabolically confined bosons as a function of the splitting between the\nstate-dependent minima of the two parabolic potentials. To quantify the\ncoherence of the system we compute its normalized one-body correlation\nfunction. We find that the coherence within each internal state of the atoms is\nmaintained, while it is lost between the different internal states. This is a\nhallmark of a new kind of fragmentation which is absent in bosons without\ninternal structure. We term the emergent phenomenon \"composite fragmentation\".\n", "  It is shown how to obtain conformal blocks from embedding space with the help\nof the operator product expansion. The minimal conformal block originates from\nscalar exchange in a four-point correlation functions of four scalars. All\nremaining conformal blocks are simple derivatives of the minimal conformal\nblock. With the help of the orthogonality properties of the conformal blocks,\nthe analytic conformal bootstrap can be implemented directly in embedding\nspace, leading to a Jacobi-like definition of conformal field theories.\n", "  We study inflation driven by a dilaton and an axion, both of which are\ncoupled to a SU(2) gauge field. We find that the inflation driven by the\ndilaton occurs in the early stage of inflation during which the gauge field\ngrows due to the gauge kinetic function. When the energy density of magnetic\nfields catches up with that of electric fields, chromo-natural inflation takes\nover in the late stage of inflation, which we call delayed chromo-natural\ninflation. Thus, the delayed chromo-natural inflation driven by the axion and\nthe gauge field is induced by the dilaton. The interesting outcome of the model\nis generation of chiral primordial gravitational waves on small scales. Since\nthe gauge field is inert in the early stage of inflation, it is viable in\ncontrast to the conventinal chromo-natural inflation. We find the parameter\nregion where chiral gravitational waves are generated in a frequency range\nhigher than nHz, which are potentially detectable in future gravitational wave\ninterferometers and pulsar timing arrays such as DECIGO, eLISA and SKA.\n", "  Quantum or torsion gravity models predict unusual properties of space-time at\nvery short distances. In particular, near the Planck length, around\n$10^{-35}m$, empty space may behave as a crystal, singly or doubly refractive.\nThis hypothesis, however, remains uncheckable for any direct measurement since\nthe smallest distance accessible in experiment is about $10^{-19}m$ at the LHC.\nHere we propose a laboratory test to measure space birefringence or\nrefractivity induced by gravity. A sensitivity $10^{-31}m$ for doubly and\n$10^{-28}m$ for singly refractive vacuum could be reached with PETRA 6 GeV beam\nexploring UV laser Compton scattering.\n", "  As an illustration of a renormalizable, asymptotically-free model of induced\ngravity, we consider an $SO(10)$ gauge theory interacting with a real scalar\nmultiplet in the adjoint representation. We show that dimensional transmutation\ncan occur, spontaneously breaking $SO(10)$ to $SU(5){\\otimes}U(1),$ while\ninducing the Planck mass and a positive cosmological constant, all proportional\nto the same scale $v$. All mass ratios are functions of the values of coupling\nconstants at that scale. Below this scale (at which the Big Bang may occur),\nthe model takes the usual form of Einstein-Hilbert gravity in de Sitter space\nplus calculable corrections. We show that there exist regions of parameter\nspace in which the breaking results in a local minimum of the effective action,\nand a {\\bf positive} dilaton $(\\hbox{mass})^2$ from two-loop corrections\nassociated with the conformal anomaly. Furthermore, unlike the singlet case we\nconsidered previously, some minima lie within the basin of attraction of the\nultraviolet fixed point. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of the coupling\nconstants also lie within the range of convergence of the Euclidean path\nintegral, so there is hope that there will be candidates for sensible vacua.\nAlthough open questions remain concerning unitarity of all such renormalizable\nmodels of gravity, it is not obvious that, in curved backgrounds such as those\nconsidered here, unitarity is violated. In any case, any violation that may\nremain will be suppressed by inverse powers of the reduced Planck mass.\n", "  We present improved point-source catalogs for the 2 Ms Chandra Deep\nField-North (CDF-N) and the 250 ks Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (E-CDF-S),\nimplementing a number of recent improvements in Chandra source-cataloging\nmethodology. For the CDF-N/E-CDF-S, we provide a main catalog that contains\n683/1003 X-ray sources detected with wavdetect at a false-positive probability\nthreshold of $10^{-5}$ that also satisfy a binomial-probability\nsource-selection criterion of $P<0.004$/$P<0.002$. Such an approach maximizes\nthe number of reliable sources detected: a total of 196/275 main-catalog\nsources are new compared to the Alexander et al. (2003) CDF-N/Lehmer et al.\n(2005) E-CDF-S main catalogs. We also provide CDF-N/E-CDF-S supplementary\ncatalogs that consist of 72/56 sources detected at the same wavdetect threshold\nand having $P$ of $0.004-0.1$/$0.002-0.1$ and $K_s\\le22.9/K_s\\le22.3$ mag\ncounterparts. For all $\\approx1800$ CDF-N and E-CDF-S sources, including the\n$\\approx500$ newly detected ones (these being generally fainter and more\nobscured), we determine X-ray source positions utilizing centroid and\nmatched-filter techniques; we also provide multiwavelength identifications,\napparent magnitudes of counterparts, spectroscopic and/or photometric\nredshifts, basic source classifications, and estimates of observed AGN and\ngalaxy source densities around respective field centers. Simulations show that\nboth the CDF-N and E-CDF-S main catalogs are highly reliable and reasonably\ncomplete. Background and sensitivity analyses indicate that the on-axis mean\nflux limits reached represent a factor of $\\approx1.5-2.0$ improvement over the\nprevious CDF-N and E-CDF-S limits. We make our data products publicly\navailable.\n", "  We present the first detection of photometric variability of a\nspectroscopically-confirmed Y dwarf. The Infrared Array Camera on board the\nSpitzer Space Telescope was used to obtain times series photometry at 3.6 and\n4.5 microns over a twenty four hour period at two different epochs separated by\n149 days. Variability is evident at 4.5 um in the first epoch and at 3.6 and\n4.5 um in the second epoch which suggests that the underlying cause or causes\nof this variability change on the timescales of months. The second-epoch [3.6]\nand [4.5] light curves are nearly sinusoidal in form, in phase, have periods of\nroughly 8.5 hours, and have semi-amplitudes of 3.5%. We find that a simple\ngeometric spot model with a single bright spot reproduces these observations\nwell. We also compare our measured semi-amplitudes of the second epoch light\ncurves to predictions of the static, one-dimensional, partly cloudy and hot\nspot models of Morley and collaborators and find that neither set of models can\nreproduce the observed [3.6] and[4.5] semi-amplitudes simultaneously. More\nadvanced two- or three-dimensional models that include time-dependent phenomena\nlike vertical mixing, cloud formation, and thermal relaxation are therefore\nsorely needed in order to properly interpret our observations.\n", "  The Kerr solution in coordinates corotating with the horizon is studied as a\ntestbed for a spacetime with a helical Killing vector in the Ernst picture. The\nsolution is numerically constructed by solving the Ernst equation with a\nspectral method and a Newton iteration. We discuss convergence of the iteration\nfor several initial iterates and different values of the Kerr parameters.\n", "  The evolution of topology of the B-B2O3 phase diagram has been studied at\npressures up to 24 GPa using models of phenomenological thermodynamics with\ninteraction parameters derived from experimental data on phase equilibria at\nhigh pressures and high temperatures.\n", "  Estimating the all-sky rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been difficult\ndue to small-number statistics and the fact that they are seen by disparate\nsurveys in different regions of the sky. In this paper we provide limits for\nthe FRB rate at 800 MHz based on the only burst detected at frequencies below\n1.4 GHz, FRB 110523. We discuss the difficulties in rate estimation,\nparticularly in providing an all-sky rate above a single fluence threshold. We\nfind an implied rate between 700-900 MHz that is consistent with the rate at\n1.4 GHz, scaling to $6.4^{+29.5}_{-5.0} \\times 10^3$\\,sky$^{-1}$\\,day$^{-1}$\nfor an HTRU-like survey. This is promising for upcoming experiments below a GHz\nlike CHIME and UTMOST, for which we forecast detection rates. Given 110523's\ndiscovery at 32$\\sigma$ with nothing weaker detected, down to the threshold of\n8$\\sigma$, we find consistency with a Euclidean flux distribution but disfavour\nsteep distributions, ruling out $\\gamma > 2.2$.\n", "  We use effective field theory to study the\n$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$-$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ resonant scattering in a finite-temperature\nQED plasma. The static plasma screening effect causes the resonance state\n$^8$Be to live longer and eventually leads to the formation of a bound state\nwhen $m_D\\gtrsim 0.3$ MeV. We speculate that this effect may have implications\non the rates of cosmologically and astrophysically relevant nuclear reactions\ninvolving $\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ particles.\n", "  We explore full/partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars/planets by\nstellar compact objects (Black holes; BHs; or neutron stars; NSs), which we\nterm micro-TDEs. Disruption of a star/planet with mass $M_{\\star}$ may lead to\nthe formation of a debris disk around the BH/NS. Efficient accretion of a\nfraction $(f_{acc}=0.1$ of the debris may then give rise to bright energetic\nlong ($10^{3}-10^{4}\\,s$), X-ray/Gamma-ray flares, with total energies of up to\n$(f_{acc}/0.1)\\times10^{52}\\,(M_{\\star}/{0.6\\,M_{\\odot}})\\,$ergs, possibly\nresembling ultra-long GRBs/XRFs. The energy of such flares depends on the\npoorly constrained accretion processes. Significantly fainter flares might be\nproduced if most of the disk mass is blown away through strong outflows. We\nsuggest three dynamical origins for such disruptions. In the first, a\nstar/planet is tidally disrupted following a close random encounter with a\nBH/NS in a dense cluster. We estimate the BH (NS) micro-TDE rates from this\nscenario to be few$\\times10^{-6}$ (few$\\times10^{-7}$) ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$ per\nMilky-Way galaxy. Another scenario involves the interaction of wide companions\ndue to perturbations by stars in the field, likely producing comparable but\nlower rates. Finally, a third scenario involves a BH/NS which gain a natal\nvelocity kick at birth, leading to a close encounter with a binary companion\nand the tidal disruption of that companion. Such events could be associated\nwith a supernova, or even with a preceding GRB/XRF event, and would likely\noccur hours to days after the prompt explosion; the rates of such events could\nbe larger than those obtained from the other scenarios, depending on the\npreceding complex binary stellar evolution.\n", "  We study turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields using nonlinear\ndynamo models for solar-type stars in the range of rotational periods from 14\nto 30 days. Our models take into account non-linear effects of dynamical\nquenching of magnetic helicity, and escape of magnetic field from the dynamo\nregion due to magnetic buoyancy. The results show that the observed correlation\nbetween the period of rotation and the duration of activity cycles can be\nexplained in the framework of a distributed dynamo model with a dynamical\nmagnetic feedback acting on the turbulent generation either from magnetic\nbuoyancy or magnetic helicity. We discuss implications of our findings for the\nunderstanding of dynamo processes operating in solar-like stars.\n", "  Mesoscopic superposition states of photons can be prepared in three cavities\ninteracting with the same two-level atom. By periodically modulating the three\ncavity frequencies around the transition frequency of the atom with $2\\pi/3$\nphase difference, the time reversal symmetry is broken and an optical\ncirculator is generated with chiralities depending on the quantum state of the\natom. A superposition of the atomic states can guide photons from one cavity to\na mesoscopic superposition of the other two cavities. The physics can be\nunderstood in a finite spin-orbit-coupled Fock-state lattice where the atom and\nthe cavities carry the spin and the orbit degrees of freedom, respectively.\nThis scheme can be realized in circuit QED architectures and provides a new\nplatform for exploring quantum information and topological physics in novel\nlattices.\n", "  We construct a manifestly diffeomorphism invariant Wilsonian (Exact)\nRenormalization Group for classical gravity, and begin the construction for\nquantum gravity. We demonstrate that the effective action can be computed\nwithout gauge fixing the diffeomorphism invariance, and also without\nintroducing a background space-time. We compute classical contributions both\nwithin a background-independent framework and by perturbing around a fixed\nbackground, and verify that the results are equivalent. We derive the exact\nWard identities for actions and kernels and verify consistency. We formulate\ntwo forms of the flow equation corresponding to the two choices of classical\nfixed-point: the Gaussian fixed point, and the scale invariant interacting\nfixed point using curvature-squared terms. We suggest how this programme may\ncompleted to a fully quantum construction.\n", "  The VISTA near infrared Y, J, Ks survey of the Magellanic System (VMC) is\ncollecting deep Ks band time series photometry of pulsating variable stars\nhosted by the two Magellanic Clouds and their connecting Bridge. In this paper,\nwe present Y, J, Ks light curves for a sample of 4172 Small Magellanic Cloud\n(SMC) Classical Cepheids (CCs). These data, complemented with literature V\nvalues, allowed us to construct a variety of period-luminosity (PL),\nperiod-luminosity-color (PLC), and period-wesenheit (PW) relationships, valid\nfor Fundamental (F), First Overtone (FO) and Second Overtone (SO) pulsators.\nThe relations involving V, J, Ks bands are in agreement with their counterparts\nin the literature. As for the Y band, to our knowledge we present the first CC\nPL, PW, and PLC relations ever derived using this filter. We also present the\nfirst near infrared PL, PW, and PLC relations for SO pulsators to date. We used\nPW(V,Ks) to estimate the relative SMC-LMC distance and, in turn, the absolute\ndistance to the SMC. For the former quantity we find a value of\nDelta(mu)=0.55+-0.04 mag, in rather good agreement with other evaluations based\non CCs, but significantly larger than the results obtained from older\npopulation II distance indicators. This discrepancy might be due to the\ndifferent geometric distributions of young and old tracers in both Clouds. As\nfor the absolute distance to the SMC, our best estimates are\nmu(SMC)=19.01+-0.05 mag and mu(SMC)=19.04+-0.06 mag, based on two distance\nmeasurements to the LMC, which rely on accurate CC and eclipsing Cepheid binary\ndata, respectively.\n", "  We measure the forward--backward asymmetry of the production of top quark and\nantiquark pairs in proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s} = 1.96~\\mathrm{TeV}$ using the full data set collected by the\nCollider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) in Tevatron Run II corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $9.1~\\rm{fb}^{-1}$. The asymmetry is characterized by\nthe rapidity difference between top quarks and antiquarks ($\\Delta y$), and\nmeasured in the final state with two charged leptons (electrons and muons). The\ninclusive asymmetry, corrected to the entire phase space at parton level, is\nmeasured to be $A_{\\text{FB}}^{t\\bar{t}} = 0.12 \\pm 0.13$, consistent with the\nexpectations from the standard-model (SM) and previous CDF results in the final\nstate with a single charged lepton. The combination of the CDF measurements of\nthe inclusive $A_{\\text{FB}}^{t\\bar{t}}$ in both final states yields\n$A_{\\text{FB}}^{t\\bar{t}}=0.160\\pm0.045$, which is consistent with the SM\npredictions. We also measure the differential asymmetry as a function of\n$\\Delta y$. A linear fit to $A_{\\text{FB}}^{t\\bar{t}}(|\\Delta y|)$, assuming\nzero asymmetry at $\\Delta y=0$, yields a slope of $\\alpha=0.14\\pm0.15$,\nconsistent with the SM prediction and the previous CDF determination in the\nfinal state with a single charged lepton. The combined slope of\n$A_{\\text{FB}}^{t\\bar{t}}(|\\Delta y|)$ in the two final states is\n$\\alpha=0.227\\pm0.057$, which is $2.0\\sigma$ larger than the SM prediction.\n", "  Based on extensive first principle calculations, we explore the thickness\ndependent effective di- electric constant and slab polarizability of few layer\nblack phosphorene. We find that the dielectric constant in ultra-thin\nphosphorene is thickness dependent and it can be further tuned by applying an\nout of plane electric field. The decreasing dielectric constant with reducing\nnumber of layers of phosphorene, is a direct consequence of the lower\npermittivity of the surface layers and the in- creasing surface to volume\nratio. We also show that the slab polarizability depends linearly on the number\nof layers, implying a nearly constant polarizability per phosphorus atom. Our\ncalculation of the thickness and electric field dependent dielectric properties\nwill be useful for designing and interpreting transport experiments in gated\nphosphorene devices, wherever electrostatic effects such as capacitance, charge\nscreening etc. are important.\n", "  [Abridged] Context. The high-energy radiation from black-hole binaries may be\ndue to the reprocessing of a lamp located on the black hole axis, emitting\nX-rays. The observed spectrum is made of 3 components: the direct spectrum; the\nthermal bump; and the reflected spectrum made of the Compton hump and the\niron-line complex.\n  Aims. We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum\n(thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band.\nWe also determine the strength of the direct component. Our choice of\nparameters is adapted to a source showing an important thermal component.\n  Methods. We compute in full GR the illumination of a thin disk by a lamp\nalong the rotation axis. We use the ATM21 radiative transfer code to compute\nthe spectrum emitted along the disk. We ray trace this local spectrum to\ndetermine the reprocessed spectrum as observed at infinity. We discuss the\ndependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle and spin.\n  Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk\nspecific intensity spectrum emitted by the illuminated atmosphere when the\nthermal disk emission if fully taken into account. High spin implies high\ntemperature in the inner regions, so the emitted thermal disk spectrum covers\nthe iron-line complex. As a result we locally observe absorption lines produced\nin the hot disk atmosphere. Absorption lines are narrow and disappear after ray\ntracing the local spectrum.\n  Conclusions. Our results mainly highlight the importance of considering the\nangle dependence of the local spectrum when computing reprocessed spectra, as\nwas already found in a recent study. The main new result of our work is to show\nthe importance of computing the thermal bump of the spectrum, as this feature\ncan change considerably the observed iron-line complex.\n", "  Cotunneling into Kondo systems, where an electron enters a $f$-electron\nmaterial via a cotunneling process through the local-moment orbital, has been\nproposed to explain the characteristic lineshapes observed in\nscanning-tunneling-spectroscopy (STS) experiments. Here we extend the theory of\nelectron cotunneling to Kondo-lattice systems where the bulk hybridization\nbetween conduction and $f$ electrons is odd under inversion, being particularly\nrelevant to Kondo insulators. Compared to the case of even hybridization, we\nshow that the interference between normal tunneling and cotunneling processes\nis fundamentally altered: it is entirely absent for layered, i.e.,\nquasi-two-dimensional materials, while its energy dependence is strongly\nmodified for three-dimensional materials. We discuss implications for STS\nexperiments.\n", "  We find a new class of metastable de Sitter solutions in compactifications of\nsix-dimensional supergravity motivated by type IIB or heterotic string vacua.\nTwo Fayet-Iliopoulos terms of a local U(1) symmetry are generated by magnetic\nflux and by the Green-Schwarz term canceling the gauge anomalies, respectively.\nThe interplay between the induced D-term, the moduli dependence of the\neffective gauge coupling, and a nonperturbative superpotential stabilizes the\nmoduli and determines the size of the extra dimensions.\n", "  We study radiation emitted by a time-dependent source of a scalar massless\nfield in the framework of the ghost-free modifications of the theory. We\nconsider a simple model of the emitter: namely,we assume that it is point-like\nand monochromatic. We focused on the most common versions of the ghost-free\ntheory, where the propagator $\\Box^{-1}$ is modified as follows\n$\\exp(-(\\Box/\\mu^2)^N) \\Box^{-1}$, where $\\mu$ is the characteristic mass-scale\nof such $GF_N$-theory. We demonstrated that far from the source, in the\nwave-zone, the radiation asymptotically converges to its \"classical\" value for\nany $N\\ge 1$. However, in the near-zone the behavior of the field is quite\ndifferent from the \"classical\" case. The difference of field amplitude for the\nghost-free field and for the classical one has an oscillatory behavior in this\ndomain. A number of oscillations increases with $N$. The amplitude of these\noscillations remain finite for even $N$, while it infinitely grows with\nfrequency for odd $N$. This behavior indicates that even in the classical\ndomain $GF_N$ theories might have pathological behavior.\n", "  Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are cornerstones of mesoscopic physics and\ncentral building blocks for quantum electronics. Although the Fermi wave-length\nin high-quality bulk graphene can be tuned up to hundreds of nanometers, the\nobservation of quantum confinement of Dirac electrons in nanostructured\ngraphene systems has proven surprisingly challenging. Here we show ballistic\ntransport and quantized conductance of size-confined Dirac fermions in\nlithographically-defined graphene constrictions. At high charge carrier\ndensities, the observed conductance agrees excellently with the Landauer theory\nof ballistic transport without any adjustable parameter. Experimental data and\nsimulations for the evolution of the conductance with magnetic field\nunambiguously confirm the identification of size quantization in the\nconstriction. Close to the charge neutrality point, bias voltage spectroscopy\nreveals a renormalized Fermi velocity ($v_F \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^6 m/s$) in\nour graphene constrictions. Moreover, at low carrier density transport\nmeasurements allow probing the density of localized states at edges, thus\noffering a unique handle on edge physics in graphene devices.\n", "  Classical Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SGXBs) and Supergiant Fast X-ray\nTransients (SFXTs) are two types of High-mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) that\npresent similar donors but, at the same time, show very different behavior in\nthe X-rays. The reason for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter\nof debate. Among the several explanations that have been proposed, some of them\ninvoke specific stellar wind properties of the donor stars. Only dedicated\nempiric analysis of the donors' stellar wind can provide the required\ninformation to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such\nanalyses are scarce. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of\nthe optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela\nX-1 (SGXB). We analyse the spectra of each star in detail and derive their\nstellar and wind properties. We compare the wind parameters, giving us an\nexcellent chance of recognizing key differences between donor winds in SFXTs\nand SGXBs. We find that the stellar parameters derived from the analysis\ngenerally agree well with the spectral types of the two donors: O9I (IGR\nJ17544-2619) and B0.5Iae (Vela X-1). An important difference between the\nstellar winds of the two stars is their terminal velocities v_inf=1500km/s in\nIGR J17544-2619 and v_inf=700km/s in Vela~X-1, which has important consequences\non the X-ray luminosity of these sources. Their specific combination of wind\nspeed and pulsar spin favours an accretion regime with a persistently high\nluminosity in Vela X-1, while it favours an inhibiting accretion mechanism in\nIGR~J17544-2619. Our study demonstrates that the wind relative velocity is\ncritical in the determination of the class of HMXBs hosting a supergiant donor,\ngiven that it may shift the accretion mechanism from direct accretion to\npropeller regimes when combined with other parameters.\n", "  We present the first complete Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of\ncosmological models with evolving cosmic (super)string networks, using the\nunconnected segment model in the unequal-time correlator formalism. For\nordinary cosmic string networks, we derive joint constraints on Lambda cold\ndark matter (CDM) and string network parameters, namely the string tension Gmu,\nthe loop-chopping efficiency c_r and the string wiggliness \\alpha. For cosmic\nsuperstrings, we obtain joint constraints on the fundamental string tension\nGmu_F, the string coupling g_s, the self-interaction coefficient c_s, and the\nvolume of compact extra dimensions w. This constitutes the most comprehensive\nCMB analysis of LambdaCDM cosmology + strings to date. For ordinary cosmic\nstring networks our updated constraint on the string tension is, in\nrelativistic units, Gmu<1.1x10^-7, while for cosmic superstrings our constraint\non the fundamental string tension is Gmu_F<2.8x10^-8, both obtained using\nPlanck2015 temperature and polarisation data.\n", "  We propose a new mass-mapping algorithm, specifically designed to recover\nsmall-scale information from a combination of gravitational shear and flexion.\nIncluding flexion allows us to supplement the shear on small scales in order to\nincrease the sensitivity to substructures and the overall resolution of the\nconvergence map without relying on strong lensing constraints. In order to\npreserve all available small scale information, we avoid any binning of the\nirregularly sampled input shear and flexion fields and treat the mass-mapping\nproblem as a general ill-posed inverse problem, regularised using a robust\nmulti-scale wavelet sparsity prior. The resulting algorithm incorporates\nredshift, reduced shear, and reduced flexion measurements for individual\ngalaxies and is made highly efficient by the use of fast Fourier estimators. We\ntest our reconstruction method on a set of realistic weak lensing simulations\ncorresponding to typical HST/ACS cluster observations and demonstrate our\nability to recover substructures with the inclusion of flexion which are lost\nif only shear information is used. In particular, we can detect substructures\nat the 15$^{\\prime \\prime}$ scale well outside of the critical region of the\nclusters. In addition, flexion also helps to constrain the shape of the central\nregions of the main dark matter halos. Our mass-mapping software, called\nGlimpse2D, is made freely available at\nhttp://www.cosmostat.org/software/glimpse .\n", "  Protostellar (class 0/I) disks, having masses comparable to those of their\nnascent host stars, and fed continuously from their natal infalling envelopes,\nare prone to gravitational instability (GI). Motivated by advances in\nnear-infrared (NIR) adaptive optics imaging and mm-wave interferometry, we\nexplore the observational signatures of GI in disks, using hydrodynamical and\nMonte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to synthesize NIR scattered light\nimages and mm dust continuum maps. Spiral arms induced by GI, located at disk\nradii of hundreds of AUs, are local overdensities and have their photospheres\ndisplaced to higher altitudes above the disk midplane, arms therefore scatter\nmore NIR light from their central stars than inter-arm regions, and are\ndetectable at distances up to 1 kpc by Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, and\nSubaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO. By contrast, collapsed clumps formed by disk\nfragmentation have such strong local gravitational fields that their scattering\nphotospheres are at lower altitudes, such fragments appear fainter than their\nsurroundings in NIR scattered light. Spiral arms and streamers recently imaged\nin four FU Ori systems at NIR wavelengths resemble GI-induced structures and\nsupport the interpretation that FUors are gravitationally unstable protostellar\ndisks. At mm wavelengths, both spirals and clumps appear brighter in thermal\nemission than the ambient disk and can be detected by ALMA at distances up to\n0.4 kpc with one-hour integration times at ~0.1 arcsec resolution. Collapsed\nfragments having masses >=1 MJ can be detected by ALMA within ~10 minutes.\n", "  Accurate measurement of efficiency for thermoelectric generator (TEG) is of\ngreat importance for materials research and development. Approximately all the\nparameters of a material are temperature dependent, so we can't directly apply\nthe $\\eta_\\text{max}$ formula for efficiency calculation in the large\ntemperature range. To overcome that problem, we tried to calculate the\nefficiency of TEG by dividing large working temperature range into a number of\nsmall temperature difference. The aim is to make temperature dependent\nparameter to be constant for that small temperature range. Using maximum\nindividual efficiency of each segment obtained by $\\eta_\\text{max}$ in the\nequation of $\\eta_\\text{overall}$, which gives overall efficiency. The\n$\\eta_\\text{overall}$ of TEG using $Bi_2Te_3$ and $TAGS$ as thermoelectric\nmaterials come out to be $7.1\\%$ and $8.94\\%$, respectively, which is close to\nexperimental results. For the high-temperature region, we have used $SiGe$\nmaterial in TEG and found out $\\eta_\\text{overall}=3.5\\%$. The cumulative\nefficiency obtained by keeping one end temperature fixed with another end\nvarying can be applied in real life application, i.e. automobile sector. The\npresent work provides a simple way for the design engineers to calculate the\nefficiency of TEG by using the temperature dependent materials parameters like\nthermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient on which\n$z\\bar{T}$ depends.\n", "  We use the Koashi-Imoto decomposition of the degrees of freedom of joint\nsystem-environment initial states to investigate the reduced dynamics. We show\nthat a subset of joint system-environment initial states guarantees completely\npositive reduced dynamics, if and only if the system privately owns all quantum\ndegrees of freedom and can locally access the classical degrees of freedom,\nwithout disturbing all joint initial states in the given subset. Furthermore,\nwe show that the quantum mutual information for such kinds of states must be\nindependent of the quantum degrees of freedom.\n", "  We explore the predictions for detectable gravitational-wave signals from\nmerging binary black holes formed through chemically homogeneous evolution in\nmassive short-period stellar binaries. We find that $\\sim 500$ events per year\ncould be detected with advanced ground-based detectors operating at full\nsensitivity. We analyze the distribution of detectable events, and conclude\nthat there is a very strong preference for detecting events with nearly equal\ncomponents (mass ratio $>0.66$ at 90\\% confidence in our default model) and\nhigh masses (total source-frame mass between $57$ and $103\\, M_\\odot$ at 90\\%\nconfidence). We consider multiple alternative variations to analyze the\nsensitivity to uncertainties in the evolutionary physics and cosmological\nparameters, and conclude that while the rates are sensitive to assumed\nvariations, the mass distributions are robust predictions. Finally, we consider\nthe recently reported results of the analysis of the first 16 double-coincident\ndays of the O1 LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory)\nobserving run, and find that this formation channel is fully consistent with\nthe inferred parameters of the GW150914 binary black hole detection and the\ninferred merger rate.\n", "  We present a simplified strong-randomness renormalization group (RG) that\ncaptures some aspects of the many-body localization (MBL) phase transition in\ngeneric disordered one-dimensional systems. This RG can be formulated\nanalytically, and the critical fixed point distribution and critical exponents\n(that satisfy the Chayes inequality) are obtained to numerical precision by\nsolving integro-differential equations. This reproduces many, but not all, of\nthe qualitative features of the MBL phase transition that are suggested by\nprevious numerical work and approximate RG studies: our RG might serve as a\n\"zeroth-order\" approximation for future RG studies. One interesting feature\nthat we highlight is that the rare Griffiths regions are fractal. For thermal\nGriffiths regions within the MBL phase, this feature might be qualitatively\ncorrectly captured by our RG. If this is correct beyond our approximations,\nthen these Griffiths effects are stronger than has been previously assumed.\n", "  Recent experiments have demonstrated that the metamaterial approach is\ncapable of drastic increase of the critical temperature Tc of epsilon near zero\n(ENZ) metamaterial superconductors. For example, tripling of the critical\ntemperature has been observed in Al-Al2O3 ENZ core-shell metamaterials. Here,\nwe perform theoretical modelling of Tc increase in metamaterial superconductors\nbased on the Maxwell-Garnett approximation of their dielectric response\nfunction. Good agreement is demonstrated between theoretical modelling and\nexperimental results in both aluminium and tin-based metamaterials. Taking\nadvantage of the demonstrated success of this model, the critical temperature\nof hypothetic niobium, MgB2 and H2S-based metamaterial superconductors is\nevaluated. The MgB2-based metamaterial superconductors are projected to reach\nthe liquid nitrogen temperature range. In the case of an H2S-based metamaterial\nTc appears to reach ~250K.\n", "  We present a portable platform, called PIC_ENGINE, for accelerating\nParticle-In-Cell (PIC) codes on heterogeneous many-core architectures such as\nGraphic Processing Units (GPUs). The aim of this development is efficient\nsimulations on future exascale systems by allowing different parallelization\nstrategies depending on the application problem and the specific architecture.\nTo this end, this platform contains the basic steps of the PIC algorithm and\nhas been designed as a test bed for different algorithmic options and data\nstructures. Among the architectures that this engine can explore, particular\nattention is given here to systems equipped with GPUs. The study demonstrates\nthat our portable PIC implementation based on the OpenACC programming model can\nachieve performance closely matching theoretical predictions. Using the Cray\nXC30 system, Piz Daint, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), we\nshow that PIC_ENGINE running on an NVIDIA Kepler K20X GPU can outperform the\none on an Intel Sandybridge 8-core CPU by a factor of 3.4.\n", "  We extend the work of Yen et al. (2012) and develop 2nd order formulae to\naccommodate a nested grid discretization for the direct self-gravitational\nforce calculation for infinitesimally thin gaseous disks. This approach uses a\ntwo-dimensional kernel derived for infinitesimally thin disks and is free of\nartificial boundary conditions. The self-gravitational force calculation is\npresented in generalized convolution forms for a nested grid configuration. A\nnumerical technique derived from a fast Fourier transform is employed to reduce\nthe computational complexity to be nearly linear. By comparing with analytic\npotential-density pairs associated with the generalized Maclaurin disks, the\nextended approach is verified to be of second order accuracy using numerical\nsimulations. The proposed method is accurate, computationally fast and has the\npotential to be applied to the studies of planetary migration and the gaseous\nmorphology of disk galaxies.\n", "  We present a formalism to calculate the macroscopic magnetoelectric\nmonopolization from first principles within the density functional theory\nframework. An expression for the monopolization in the case of insulating\ncollinear magnetism is derived first in terms of spin-polarized Wannier\nfunctions then recast as a Berry phase. We propose an extension to the general,\nnon-collinear case which we implement computationally in the Wannier function\nform and use to calculate the magnetoelectric monopolizations of LiMnPO$_4$ and\nCr$_2$O$_3$. We find that, while the former is well approximated by a summation\nover the formal local spin moments, the latter shows significant deviations\nfrom this approximation. We suggest that equating the Berry phase value with a\nsum over local moments provides an unambiguous route to defining the size of\nthe local magnetic moment in magnetoelectric antiferromagnets containing only\none type of magnetic ion.\n", "  We introduce a general class of su$(1|1)$ supersymmetric spin chains with\nlong-range interactions which includes as particular cases the su$(1|1)$\nInozemtsev (elliptic) and Haldane-Shastry chains, as well as the XX model. We\nshow that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of the\nalgebraic properties of the su$(1|1)$ permutation operator, and take advantage\nof this fact to analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential\nterm is present in the Hamiltonian. We first study the low energy excitations\nand the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that\nof a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$\nwhen the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\\mathcal\nE(\\pi))$, $\\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation. We also analyze the\nvon Neumann and R\\'enyi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that they\nexhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins\ncharacteristic of a one-boson $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show\nthat the models under study are quantum critical when the chemical potential\nbelongs to the critical interval, with central charge $c=1$. From the analysis\nof the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a\nquantum phase transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further\nconfirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which\nis studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the\nsu$(1|1)$ elliptic chain.\n", "  One-loop Standard Model observables produced by virtual heavy Kaluza-Klein\nfields play a prominent role in the minimal model of universal extra\ndimensions. Motivated by this aspect, we integrate out all the Kaluza-Klein\nheavy modes coming from the Yang-Mills theory set on a spacetime with an\narbitrary number, $n$, of compact extra dimensions. After fixing the gauge with\nrespect to the Kaluza-Klein heavy gauge modes in a covariant manner, we\ncalculate a gauge independent effective Lagrangian expansion containing\nmultiple Kaluza-Klein sums that entail a bad divergent behavior. We use the\nEpstein-zeta function to regularize and characterize discrete divergences\nwithin such multiple sums, and then we discuss the interplay between the number\nof extra dimensions and the degree of accuracy of effective Lagrangians to\ngenerate or not divergent terms of discrete origin. We find that\nnonrenormalizable terms with mass dimension $k$ are finite as long as $k>4+n$.\nMultiple Kaluza-Klein sums of nondecoupling logarithmic terms, not treatable by\nEpstein-zeta regularization, are produced by four-dimensional momentum\nintegration. On the grounds of standard renormalization, we argue that such\neffects are unobservable.\n", "  3D atmosphere model results are used to comparatively study the kinetic,\nnon-equilibrium cloud formation in the atmospheres of two example planets\nguided by the giant gas planets HD209458b and HD189733b. Rather independently\nof hydrodynamic model differences, our cloud modelling suggests that both\nplanets are covered in mineral clouds throughout the entire modelling domain.\nBoth planets harbour chemically complex clouds that are made of mineral\nparticles that have a height-dependent material composition and size. The\nremaining gas-phase element abundances strongly effects the molecular\nabundances of the atmosphere in the cloud forming regions. Hydrocarbon and\ncyanopolyyne molecules can be rather abundant in the inner, dense part of the\natmospheres of HD189733b and HD209458b. No one value for metallicity and the\nC/O ratio can be used to describe an extrasolar planet. Our results concerning\nthe presence and location of water in relation to the clouds explain some of\nthe observed differences between the two planets. In HD189733b, strong water\nfeatures have been reported while such features appear less strong for\nHD209458b. By considering the location of the clouds in the two atmospheres, we\nsee that obscuring clouds exist high in the atmosphere of HD209458b, but much\ndeeper in HD189733b. We further conclude that the (self-imposed) degeneracy of\ncloud parameters in retrieval methods can only be lifted if the cloud formation\nprocesses are accurately modelled in contrast to prescribing them by\nindependent parameters.\n", "  We propose a Clifford algebra based model, which treats both gravity and\nYang-Mills interactions as gauge fields. There are two sectors of boson fields\nas electroweak and Majorana bosons. The electroweak boson sector induces\nfermion masses via spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is composed of scalar\nHiggs, pseudoscalar Higgs, and antisymmetric tensor components. The Majorana\nboson sector contributes to flavor mixing and Majorana masses of right-handed\nneutrinos. It is comprised of neutrino Higgs and pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\nThe LHC 750 GeV diphoton resonance might possibly be identified as a Majorana\nsector pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, which results from spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of a flavor-related global U(1) symmetry involving four-fermion\ncondensation of right-handed leptons and quarks. The diphoton decay is loop\ninduced, since tree-level decay is suppressed by large Majorana mass of the\nright-handed neutrino. There is also a potential dark matter candidate, which\nis the four-lepton condensation of muon, muon-neutrino, tau, and tau-neutrino.\n", "  We explore the phenomenology of a class of models where the dark matter\nparticle can inelastically up-scatter to a heavier excited state via\noff-diagonal dipolar interactions with the interstellar plasma (gas or free\nelectrons). The heavier particle then rapidly decays back to the dark matter\nparticle plus a quasi-monochromatic photon. For the process to occur at\nappreciable rates, the mass splitting between the heavier state and the dark\nmatter must be comparable to, or smaller than, the kinetic energy of particles\nin the plasma. As a result, the predicted photon line falls in the soft X-ray\nrange, or, potentially, at arbitrarily lower energies. We explore experimental\nconstraints from cosmology and particle physics, and present accurate\ncalculations of the dark matter thermal relic density and of the flux of\nmonochromatic X-rays from thermal plasma excitation. We find that the model\nprovides a natural explanation for the observed 3.5 keV line from clusters of\ngalaxies and from the Galactic center, and is consistent with null detections\nof the line from dwarf galaxies. The unique line shape, which will be resolved\nby future observations with the Hitomi (formerly Astro-H) satellite, and the\npredicted unique morphology and target-temperature dependence will enable easy\ndiscrimination of this class of models versus other scenarios for the\ngeneration of the 3.5 keV line or of any other unidentified line across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.\n", "  Keane et al. (2016) have recently reported the discovery of a new fast radio\nburst, FRB150418, with a promising radio counterpart at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz -- a\nrapidly decaying source, falling from 200-300 $\\mu$Jy to 100 $\\mu$Jy on\ntimescales of $\\sim$6 d. This transient source may be associated with an\nelliptical galaxy at redshift $z=0.492$, providing the first firm spectroscopic\nredshift for a FRB and the ability to estimate the density of baryons in the\nintergalactic medium via the combination of known redshift and radio dispersion\nof the FRB. An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger\n(2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN. The\nputative counterpart's variation may then instead be extrinsic, caused by\nrefractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way,\nwhich would invalidate the association with FRB150418. We examine this latter\nexplanation in detail and show that the reported observations are consistent\nwith scintillating radio emission from the core of a radio-loud active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) having a brightness temperature $T_{\\rm b} \\gtrsim 10^9 {\\rm K}$.\nUsing numerical simulations of the expected scattering for the line of sight to\nFRB150418, we provide example images and light curves of such an AGN at 5.5 and\n7.5 GHz. These results can be compared with continued radio monitoring to\nconclusively determine the importance of scintillation for the observed radio\nvariability, and they show that scintillation is a critical consideration for\ncontinued searches for FRB counterparts at radio wavelengths.\n", "  We examine a bosonic two-leg ladder model subject to a magnetic flux, and\nespecially focus on a regime where the lower energy band has two minima. By\nusing a low-energy field theory approach, we study several issues discussed in\nthe system: the existence of local patterns in density and current,\nchiral-current reversal, and the effect of a nearest-neighbor interaction along\nthe rung direction. In our formalism, the local patterns are interpreted as a\nresult of breaking of discrete symmetry. The chiral-current reversal occurs\nthrough a competition between a current component determined at a commensurate\nvortex density causing an enlargement of the unit cell, and another component,\nwhich is proportional to the magnetic field doping from the corresponding\ncommensurate flux. The nearest-neighbor interaction along the rung direction\navailable with the technique on a synthetic dimension is shown to favor a\npopulation-imbalance solution in an experimentally relevant regime.\n", "  In the presence of an external static magnetic field, an atomic gas becomes\noptically active, showing magneto-optical rotation. In the saturated regime,\nthe coherences among the excited substates give a nonlinear contribution to the\nrotation of the light polarization. In contrast with the linear magneto-optical\nrotation, the nonlinear counterpart is insensitive to Doppler broadening. By\nvarying the temperature of a cold strontium gas, we observe both regimes by\ndriving the $J=0\\rightarrow J=1$ transition on the intercombination line. For\nthis narrow transition, the sensitivity to the static magnetic field is\ntypically three orders of magnitude larger than for a standard broad alkali\ntransition.\n", "  The high-mass X-ray binary and accreting X-ray pulsar IGR J16393-4643 was\nobserved by NuSTAR in the 3-79 keV energy band for a net exposure time of 50\nks. We present the results of this observation which enabled the discovery of a\ncyclotron resonant scattering feature with a centroid energy of 29.3(+1.1/-1.3)\nkeV. This allowed us to measure the magnetic field strength of the neutron star\nfor the first time: B = (2.5+/-0.1)e12 G. The known pulsation period is now\nobserved at 904.0+/-0.1 s. Since 2006, the neutron star has undergone a\nlong-term spin-up trend at a rate of P' = -2e-8 s/s (-0.6 s per year, or a\nfrequency derivative of nu' = 3e-14 Hz/s ). In the power density spectrum, a\nbreak appears at the pulse frequency which separates the zero slope at low\nfrequency from the steeper slope at high frequency. This addition of angular\nmomentum to the neutron star could be due to the accretion of a quasi-spherical\nwind, or it could be caused by the transient appearance of a prograde accretion\ndisk that is nearly in corotation with the neutron star whose magnetospheric\nradius is around 2e8 cm.\n", "  We study the origin of the stellar $\\alpha$-element-to-iron abundance ratio,\n$[\\alpha/\\mathrm{Fe}]_{\\ast}$, of present-day central galaxies, using\ncosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the Evolution and Assembly of\nGaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project. For galaxies with stellar\nmasses of $M_{\\ast} > 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$, $[\\alpha/\\mathrm{Fe}]_{\\ast}$\nincreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass and age. These trends are in good\nagreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consistent with a\n`downsizing' galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the\nbulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium\nthat was mostly $\\alpha$-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback\nfrom active galactic nuclei (AGN), however, $[\\alpha/\\mathrm{Fe}]_{\\ast}$ in\n$M_{\\ast} > 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ galaxies is roughly constant with stellar\nmass and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for\nlower-mass galaxies in both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that\nAGN feedback can account for the $\\alpha$-enhancement of massive galaxies, as\nit suppresses their star formation, quenching more massive galaxies at earlier\ntimes, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-mass stars\n(supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.\n", "  We present 1103 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions from the United\nStates Naval Observatory (USNO) Robotic Astrometric Telescope (URAT)\nobservations taken at the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) over a 3\nyear period from April 2012 to June 2015 covering the entire sky north of about\nminus 10 deg declination. We selected 2 samples previously suspected nearby\nstars from known photometric distances and stars showing a large, significant\nparallax signature in URAT epoch data without any prior selection criteria. All\nsystems presented in this paper have an observed parallax greater than equal to\n40 mas with no previous published trigonometric parallax. The formal errors on\nthese weighted parallax solutions are mostly between 4 and 10 mas. This sample\ngives a significant (order 50%) increase to the number of known systems having\na trigonometric parallax to be within 25 pc of the Sun (without applying Lutz\nKelker bias corrections). A few of these are found to be within 10 pc. Many of\nthese new nearby stars display a total proper motion of less than 200 mas per\nyear. URAT parallax results have been verified against Hipparcos and Yale data\nfor stars in common. The publication of all significant parallax observations\nfrom URAT data is in preparation for CDS.\n", "  The products of weak values of quantum observables are shown to be of value\nin deriving quantum uncertainty and complementarity relations, for both weak\nand strong measurement statistics. First, a 'product representation formula'\nallows the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation to be derived from a\nclassical uncertainty relation for complex random variables. We show this\nformula also leads to strong uncertainty relations for unitary operators, and\nunderlies an interpretation of weak values as optimal (complex) estimates of\nquantum observables. Furthermore, we show that two incompatible observables\nthat are weakly and strongly measured in a weak measurement context obey a\ncomplementarity relation under the interchange of these observables, in the\nform of an upper bound on the product of the corresponding weak values.\nMoreover, general tradeoff relations between weak purity, quantum purity and\nquantum incompatibility, and also between weak and strong joint probability\ndistributions, are obtained based on products of real and imaginary components\nof weak values, where these relations quantify the degree to which weak\nprobabilities can take anomalous values in a given context.\n", "  Two-, three-, and four-boson systems are studied close to the unitary limit\nusing potential models constructed to reproduce the minimal information given\nby the two-body scattering length $a$ and the two-body binding energy or\nvirtual state energy $E_2$. The particular path used to reach the unitary limit\nis given by varying the potential strength. In this way the energy spectrum in\nthe three- and four-boson systems is computed. The lowest energy states show\nfinite-range effects absorbed in the construction of level functions that can\nbe used to study real systems. Higher energy levels are free from finite-range\neffects, therefore the corresponding level functions tend to the zero-range\nuniversal function. Using this property a zero-range equation for the\nfour-boson system is proposed and the four-boson universal function is\ncomputed.\n", "  Utilizing an archived Suzaku data acquired on 2007 December 25 for 46 ks,\nX-ray spectroscopic properties of the dipping and eclipsing low-mass X-ray\nbinary EXO 0748$-$676 were studied. At an assumed distance of 7.1 kpc, the data\ngave a persistent unabsorbed luminosity of $3.4\\times10^{36}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in 0.6 $-$ 55 keV. The source was in a relatively bright low/hard\nstate, wherein the 0.6 $-$ 55 keV spectrum can be successfully explained by a\n\"double-seed\" Comptonization model, incorporating a common corona with an\nelectron temperature of $\\sim13$ keV. The seed photons are thought to be\nsupplied from both the neutron star surface, and a cooler truncated disk.\nCompared to a sample of non-dipping low-mass X-ray binaries in the low/hard\nstate, the spectrum is subject to stronger Comptonization, with a relatively\nlarger Comptonizing $y$-parameter of $\\sim1.4$ and a larger coronal optical\ndepth of $\\sim5$. This result, when attributed to the high inclination of EXO\n0748$-$676, suggests that the Comptonizing corona may elongate along the disk\nplane, and give a longer path for the seed photons when viewed from edge-on\ninclinations.\n", "  We present a pulsed four-wave mixing (FWM) scheme via a Rydberg state to\ncreate, store and retrieve collective Rydberg polaritons. The storage medium\nconsists of a gas of thermal Rb atoms confined in a 220 {\\mu}m thick cell,\nwhich are heated above room temperature. The experimental sequence consists of\na pulsed excitation of Rydberg polaritons via the D1 line, a variable delay or\nstorage time, and a final retrieval pulse via the D2 line. The lifetime of the\nRydberg polaritons is around 1.2 ns, almost entirely limited by the excitation\nbandwidth and the corresponding motional dephasing of the atoms. The presented\nscheme combined with a tightly confined atomic ensemble is a good candidate for\na deterministic single-photon source, as soon as strong interactions in terms\nof a Rydberg blockade are added.\n", "  We consider an interacting theory of an infinite tower of massless\nhigher-spin fields in flat space with cubic vertices and their coupling\nconstants found previously by Metsaev. We compute the one-loop bubble diagram\npart of the self-energy of the spin 0 member of the tower by summing up all\nhigher-spin loop contributions. We find that the result contains an\nexponentially UV divergent part and we discuss how it could be cancelled by a\ntadpole contribution depending on yet to be determined quartic interaction\nvertex. We also compute the tree-level four-scalar scattering amplitude due to\nall higher-spin exchanges and discuss its inconsistency with the BCFW\nconstructibility condition. We comment on possible relation to similar\ncomputations in AdS background in connection with AdS/CFT.\n", "  Semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes are classified into two types by\nmeans of orbital angular momentum of valley state, which is useful to study\ntheir low energy electronic properties in finite-length. The classification is\ngiven by an integer $d$, which is the greatest common divisor of two integers\n$n$ and $m$ specifying the chirality of nanotubes, by analyzing cutting lines.\nFor the case that $d$ is equal to or greater than four, two lowest subbands\nfrom two valleys have different angular momenta with respect to the nanotube\naxis. Reflecting the decoupling of two valleys, discrete energy levels in\nfinite-length nanotubes exhibit nearly fourfold degeneracy and its small lift\nby the spin-orbit interaction. For the case that $d$ is less than or equal to\ntwo, in which two lowest subbands from two valleys have the same angular\nmomentum, discrete levels exhibit lift of fourfold degeneracy reflecting the\ncoupling of two valleys. Especially, two valleys are strongly coupled when the\nchirality is close to the armchair chirality. An effective one-dimensional\nlattice model is derived by extracting states with relevant angular momentum,\nwhich reveals the valley coupling in the eigenstates. A bulk-edge\ncorrespondence, relationship between number of edge states and the winding\nnumber calculated in the corresponding bulk system, is analytically shown by\nusing the argument principle, which enables us to estimate the number of edge\nstates from the bulk property. The number of edge states depends not only on\nthe chirality but also on the shape of boundary.\n", "  We present an analytical and numerical study of the paths of self avoiding\nwalks (SAWs) on random networks. Since these walks do not retrace their paths,\nthey effectively delete the nodes they visit, together with their links, thus\npruning the network. The walkers hop between neighboring nodes, until they\nreach a dead-end node from which they cannot proceed. Focusing on\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks we show that the pruned networks maintain a Poisson\ndegree distribution, $p_t(k)$, with an average degree, $\\langle k \\rangle_t$,\nthat decreases linearly in time. We enumerate the SAW paths of any given length\nand find that the number of paths, $n_T(\\ell)$, increases dramatically as a\nfunction of $\\ell$. We also obtain analytical results for the path-length\ndistribution, $P(\\ell)$, of the SAW paths which are actually pursued, starting\nfrom a random initial node. It turns out that $P(\\ell)$ follows the Gompertz\ndistribution, which means that the termination probability of an SAW path\nincreases with its length.\n", "  Satellites carrying sources of entangled photons could establish a global\nquantum network, enabling private encryption keys between any two points on\nEarth. Despite numerous proposals, demonstration of space-based quantum systems\nhas been limited due to the cost of traditional satellites. We are using very\nsmall spacecraft to accelerate progress. We report the in-orbit operation of a\nphoton pair source aboard a 1.65 kg nanosatellite and demonstrate pair\ngeneration and polarization correlation under space conditions. The in-orbit\nphoton correlations exhibit a contrast of 97+/-2%, matching ground-based tests.\nThis pathfinding mission overcomes the challenge of demonstrating in-orbit\nperformance for the components of future entangled photon experiments. Ongoing\noperation establishes the in-orbit lifetime of these critical components. More\ngenerally, this demonstrates the ability for nanosatellites to enable faster\nprogress in space-based research.\n", "  Spectral and anisotropy properties of IceCube astrophysical neutrino signal\nreveal an evidence for a significant Galactic contribution to the neutrino flux\nin Southern hemisphere. We check if the Galactic contribution is detectable in\nthe astrophysical muon neutrino flux observed from a low positive declinations\nregion of the Northern sky. Estimating the Galactic neutrino flux in this part\nof the sky from gamma-ray and Southern sky neutrino data, we find that the\nNorthern sky astrophysical muon neutrino signal shows an excess over the\nGalactic flux. This points to the presence of an additional hard spectrum\n(extragalactic or large scale Galactic halo) component of astrophysical\nneutrino flux. We show that the Galactic flux component should still be\ndetectable in the muon neutrino data in a decade long IceCube exposure.\n", "  A systematic analysis of polarization effects in a direct write femtosecond\nlaser 3D lithography is presented. It is newly shown that coupling between\nlinear polarization of the writing light electric field and temperature\ngradient can be used to fine-tune feature sizes in structuring of photoresists\nat a nanoscale. The vectorial Debye focusing is used to simulate polarization\neffects and a controlled variation up to 20% in the linewidth is shown\nexperimentally for the identical axial extent of the polymerised features. The\nrevealed mechanisms are relevant for a wide range of phenomena of light-matter\ninteraction at tight focusing in laser-tweezers and in plasmonic or dielectric\nsub-wavelength focusing where strong light intensity and thermal gradients\ncoexist.\n", "  Results of the application of pattern recognition techniques to the problem\nof identifying Giant Radio Sources (GRS) from the data in the NVSS catalog are\npresented and issues affecting the process are explored. Decision-tree pattern\nrecognition software was applied to training set source pairs developed from\nknown NVSS large angular size radio galaxies. The full training set consisted\nof 51,195 source pairs, 48 of which were known GRS for which each lobe was\nprimarily represented by a single catalog component. The source pairs had a\nmaximum separation of 20 arc minutes and a minimum component area of 1.87\nsquare arc minutes at the 1.4 mJy level. The importance of comparing resulting\nprobability distributions of the training and application sets for cases of\nunknown class ratio is demonstrated. The probability of correctly ranking a\nrandomly selected (GRS, non-GRS) pair from the best of the tested classifiers\nwas determined to be 97.8 +/- 1.5%. The best classifiers were applied to the\nover 870,000 candidate pairs from the entire catalog. Images of higher ranked\nsources were visually screened and a table of over sixteen hundred candidates,\nincluding morphological annotation, is presented. These systems include doubles\nand triples, Wide-Angle Tail (WAT) and Narrow-Angle Tail (NAT), S- or Z-shaped\nsystems, and core-jets and resolved cores. While some resolved lobe systems are\nrecovered with this technique, generally it is expected that such systems would\nrequire a different approach.\n", "  Variability induced motion (VIM) is an observable effect in simultaneous\nastrometric and photometric measurements caused by brightness variation in one\nof the components of a double source or blended image, which manifests itself\nas a strongly correlated shift of the optical photocenter. We have processed\nthe entire collection of the Kepler long-cadence light curve data looking for\ncorrelated signals in astrometry and photometry on the time basis of a quarter\nyear. Limiting the VIM correlation coefficient to 0.3, VIM events are detected\nfor 129,525 Kepler stars at least in one quarter. Of 7305 Kepler objects of\ninterest (KOI), 4440 are detected as VIM at least once. Known variable stars\nand resolved double stars have elevated rates of VIM detection. Confident VIM\noccurrences are found for stars with suggested superflare events, indicating\npossible signal contamination. We present a complete catalog of all quarterly\nVIM detections. This catalog should be checked for such astrophysically\nsignificant events as transits of exoplanets, new eclipsing stars, and\nsuperflares of solar-type stars.\n", "  We present high-resolution observations of a sample of 75 K2 targets from\nCampaigns 1-3 using speckle interferometry on the Southern Astrophysical\nResearch (SOAR) telescope and adaptive optics (AO) imaging at the Keck II\ntelescope. The median SOAR $I$-band and Keck $K_s$-band detection limits at 1\"\nwere $\\Delta m_{I}=4.4$~mag and $\\Delta m_{K_s}=6.1$~mag, respectively. This\nsample includes 37 stars likely to host planets, 32 targets likely to be\neclipsing binaries (EBs), and 6 other targets previously labeled as likely\nplanetary false positives. We find nine likely physically bound companion stars\nwithin 3\" of three candidate transiting exoplanet host stars and six likely\nEBs. Six of the nine detected companions are new discoveries; one of the six,\nEPIC 206061524, is associated with a planet candidate. Among the EB candidates,\ncompanions were only found near the shortest period ones ($P<3$ days), which is\nin line with previous results showing high multiplicity near short-period\nbinary stars. This high-resolution data, including both the detected companions\nand the limits on potential unseen companions, will be useful in future planet\nvetting and stellar multiplicity rate studies for planets and binaries.\n", "  The decays $ \\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\psi(2S)pK^-$ and $ \\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+\n\\pi^- pK^-$ are observed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$, collected in proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8TeV\ncentre-of-mass energies by the LHCb detector. The $\\psi(2S)$ mesons are\nreconstructed through the decay modes $\\psi(2S)\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $\\psi(2S)\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-$. The branching fractions relative to that of $ \\Lambda_b^0\n\\to J/\\psi pK^-$ are measured to be \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  \\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\psi(2S) pK^-)}\n  {\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi pK^-)}\n  & = & (20.70\\pm 0.76\\pm 0.46\\pm 0.37)\\times10^{-2} \\,,\n  \\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+ \\pi^- pK^-)}\n  {\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi pK^-)}\n  & = & (20.86\\pm 0.96\\pm 1.34)\\times10^{-2} \\,, \\end{eqnarray*} where the\nfirst uncertainties are statistical, the second are systematic and the third is\nrelated to the knowledge of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ branching fractions.\n  The mass of the $\\Lambda_b^0$ baryon is measured to be $$ M(\\Lambda_b^0) =\n5619.65 \\pm 0.17 \\pm 0.17\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2,$$ where the uncertainties are\nstatistical and systematic.\n", "  The Frenkel exciton model was adapted to describe X-ray absorption and\nresonant inelastic scattering spectra of polynuclear transition metal complexes\nby means of restricted active space self-consistent field method. The proposed\napproach allows to substantially decrease the requirements to computational\nresources if compared to a full supermolecular quantum chemical treatment. This\nholds true in particular in cases where the dipole approximation to the\nelectronic transition charge density can be applied. The computational protocol\nwas applied to the calculation of X-ray spectra of the hemin complex, which\nforms dimers in aqueous solution. The aggregation effects were found to be\ncomparable to the spectral alterations due to the replacement of the axial\nligand by solvent molecules.\n", "  We report on the results from our measurements of the interstellar medium\n(ISM) abundances for the elements O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe in the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC). We used the archival Chandra data for sixteen supernova remnants\n(SNRs) in the LMC (0453--68.5, DEM L71, N23, 0519--69.0, N49B, N132D, N49,\nN206, 0534--69.9, DEM L238, N63A, Honeycomb, N157B, 0540--69.3, DEM L316B, and\n0548--70.4). Our results represent LMC abundance measurements based on the\nmodern Chandra data. We place tight constraints on our measured elemental\nabundances and find lower abundances than previous measurements by Hughes et\nal. (1998) (by a factor of ~2 on average except for Si) who utilized similar\nmethods based on a smaller sample of ASCA data of SNRs in the LMC. We discuss\norigins of the discrepancy between our Chandra and the previous ASCA\nmeasurements. We also discuss our results in comparisons with the LMC abundance\nmeasurements in literatures.\n", "  X-ray flares are generally supposed to be produced by the later central\nengine activities, and may share the similar physical origin with prompt\nemission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper, we have analyzed all\nsignificant X-ray flares from the GRBs observed by {\\em Swift} from April 2005\nto March 2015. The catalog contains 468 bright X-ray flares, including 200\nflares with redshifts. We obtain the fitting results of X-ray flares, such as\nstart time, peak time, duration, peak flux, fluence, peak luminosity, and mean\nluminosity. The peak luminosity decreases with peak time, following a power-law\nbehavior $L_p \\propto T_{peak,z}^{-1.27}$. The flare duration increases with\npeak time. The 0.3-10 keV isotropic energy of X-ray flares distribution is a\nlognormal peaked at $10^{51.2}$ erg. We also study the frequency distributions\nof flare parameters, including energies, durations, peak fluxes, rise times,\ndecay times and waiting times. Power-law distributions of energies, durations,\npeak fluxes, and waiting times are found in GRB X-ray flares and solar flares.\nThese distributions could be well explained by a fractal-diffusive,\nself-organized criticality model. Some theoretical models basing on magnetic\nreconnection have been proposed to explain X-ray flares. Our result shows that\nthe relativistic jets of GRBs may be Poynting-flux dominated.\n", "  We generalize previous approach of Khrapak and Morfill [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf\n134}, 094108 (2011)] to construct simple and sufficiently accurate freezing and\nmelting equations for the conventional Lennard-Jones (LJ) system to $n$-6 LJ\nsystems, using the accurate results for the triple points of these systems\npublished by Sousa {\\it et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 136}, 174502 (2012)].\n", "  We present an automatic procedure to perform reliable photometry of galaxies\non SDSS images. We selected a sample of 5853 galaxies in the Coma and Virgo\nsuperclusters. For each galaxy, we derive Petrosian g and i magnitudes, surface\nbrightness profiles and color profiles. Unlike the SDSS pipeline, our procedure\nis not affected by the well known shredding problem and efficiently extracts\nPetrosian magnitudes for all galaxies. Hence we derived magnitudes even from\nthe population of galaxies missed by the SDSS that represents 25% of all Local\nsupercluster galaxies and ~95% of galaxies with g < 11 mag. After correcting\nthe g and i magnitudes for Galactic and internal extinction, the blue and red\nsequences in the color magnitude diagram are well separated, with similar\nslopes. In addition, we study (i) the color-magnitude diagrams in different\ngalaxy regions, the inner (r <= 1 kpc), intermediate (0.2R{Pet} <=r<=\n0.3R{Pet}) and outer, disk-dominated (r>=0.35R{Pet})) zone, and (ii), we\ncompute template color profiles, discussing the dependences of the templates on\nthe galaxy masses and on their morphological type. The two analyses\nconsistently lead to a picture where elliptical galaxies show no color\ngradients, irrespective of their masses. Spirals, instead, display a steeper\ngradient in their color profiles with increasing mass, consistently with the\ngrowing relevance of a bulge and/or a bar component above 10^{10} Modot.\n", "  Stars are often observed to form in clusters. It is therefore important to\nunderstand how such a region of concentrated mass is assembled out of the\ndiffuse medium and its properties eventually prescribe the important physical\nmechanisms and determine the characteristics of the stellar cluster. We study\nthe formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing\nhigh resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those\nof the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the\ncloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster\nformation. The gaseous proto-cluster is formed out of global collapse of a\nmolecular cloud, and has non-negligible rotation due to angular momentum\nconservation during the collapse of the object. Most of the star formation\noccurs in this region which occupies only a small volume fraction of the whole\ncloud. We identify such regions in simulations and compare the gas and sink\nparticles to observations. The gaseous proto-cluster inferred from simulation\nresults present a mass-size relation that is compatible with observations. We\nstress that the stellar cluster radius, although clearly correlated with the\ngas cluster radius, depends sensitively on its definition. Energy analysis is\nperformed to confirm that the gaseous proto-cluster is a product of\ngravo-turbulent reprocessing and that the support of turbulent and rotational\nenergy against self-gravity yields a state of global virial equilibrium\nalthough collapse is occurring at smaller scale and the cluster is forming\nstars actively. This object then serves as the antecedent of the stellar\ncluster, to which the energy properties are passed on.\n", "  Most stars are born in the gaseous proto-cluster environment. The knowledge\nof this intermediate stage gives more accurate constraints on star formation\ncharacteristics. We demonstrate that a virialized globally supported structure,\nin which star formation happens, is formed out of a collapsing molecular cloud,\nand derive a mapping from the parent cloud parameters to the proto-cluster to\npredict its properties, with a view to confront analytical calculations with\nobservations and simulations. The virial theorem is decomposed into two\ndimensions to account for the rotation and the flattened geometry. Equilibrium\nis found by balancing rotation, turbulence and self-gravity, while turbulence\nis maintained by accretion driving and dissipates in one crossing time. The\nangular momentum and the accretion rate of the proto-cluster are estimated from\nthe parent cloud properties. The two-dimensional virial model predicts the size\nand velocity dispersion given the mass of the proto-cluster and that of the\nparent cloud. The gaseous proto-clusters lie on a sequence of equilibrium with\nthe trend $R \\sim M^{0.5}$, with limited variations depending on the\nevolutionary stage, the parent cloud, and the parameters not well known like\nturbulence driving efficiency by accretion and the turbulence anisotropy. The\nmodel reproduces successfully observations and simulation results. The\nproperties of proto-clusters follow universal relations and they can be derived\nfrom that of the parent cloud. Using simple estimates to infer the peak\nposition of the core mass function (CMF) we find a weak dependence on the\ncluster mass suggesting that the physical conditions inside proto-clusters may\ncontribute to set a CMF, and by extension an IMF, that looks independent of the\nenvironment.\n", "  The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) has collected more than\n150,000 $2.1 \\leq z \\leq 3.5$ quasar spectra since 2009. Using this\nunprecedented sample, we create a composite spectrum in the rest-frame of\n102,150 quasar spectra from 800 \\AA\\ to 3300 \\AA\\ at a signal-to-noise ratio\nclose to 1000 per pixel ($\\Delta v$ of 69 km~s$^{-1}$). Included in this\nanalysis is a correction to account for flux calibration residuals in the BOSS\nspectrophotometry. We determine the spectral index as a function of redshift of\nthe full sample, warp the composite spectrum to match the median spectral\nindex, and compare the resulting spectrum to SDSS photometry used in target\nselection. The quasar composite matches the color of the quasar population to\nwithin 0.02 magnitudes in $g-r$, 0.03 magnitudes in $r-i$, and 0.01 magnitudes\nin $i-z$ over the redshift range $2.2<z<2.6$. The composite spectrum deviates\nfrom the imaging photometry by 0.05 magnitudes around $z = 2.7$, likely due to\ndifferences in target selection as the quasar colors become similar to the\nstellar locus at this redshift. Finally, we characterize the line features in\nthe high signal-to-noise composite and identify nine faint lines not found in\nthe previous composite spectrum from SDSS.\n", "  The heavy element ashes of rp-process hydrogen and helium burning in\naccreting neutron stars are compressed to high density where they freeze,\nforming the outer crust of the star. We calculate the chemical separation on\nfreezing for a number of different nuclear mixtures resulting from a range of\nburning conditions for the rp-process. We confirm the generic result that light\nnuclei are preferentially retained in the liquid and heavy nuclei in the solid.\nThis is in agreement with the previous study of a 17-component mixture of\nrp-process ashes by Horowitz et al. (2007), but extends that result to a much\nlarger range of compositions. We also find an alternate phase separation regime\nfor the lightest ash mixtures which does not demonstrate this generic\nbehaviour. With a few exceptions, we find that chemical separation reduces the\nexpected $Q_{\\rm imp}$ in the outer crust compared to the initial rp-process\nash, where $Q_{\\rm imp}$ measures the mean-square dispersion in atomic number\n$Z$ of the nuclei in the mixture. We find that the fractional spread of $Z$\nplays a role in setting the amount of chemical separation and is strongly\ncorrelated to the divergence between the two/three-component approximations and\nthe full component model. The contrast in $Y_e$ between the initial rp-process\nashes and the equilibrium liquid composition is similar to that assumed in\nearlier two-component models of compositionally driven convection, except for\nvery light compositions which produce nearly negligible convective driving. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results for observations of accreting neutron\nstars.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the dissociative tunneling ionization\nprocess. Analytic expressions for the nuclear kinetic energy distribution of\nthe ionization rates are derived. A particularly simple expression for the\nspectrum is found by using the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation in\nconjunction with the reflection principle. These spectra are compared to exact\nnon-BO ab initio spectra obtained through model calculations with a quantum\nmechanical treatment of both the electronic and nuclear degrees freedom. In the\nregime where the BO approximation is applicable imaging of the BO nuclear wave\nfunction is demonstrated to be possible through reverse use of the reflection\nprinciple, when accounting appropriately for the electronic ionization rate. A\nqualitative difference between the exact and BO wave functions in the\nasymptotic region of large electronic distances is shown. Additionally the\nbehavior of the wave function across the turning line is seen to be reminiscent\nof light refraction. For weak fields, where the BO approximation does not\napply, the weak-field asymptotic theory describes the spectrum accurately.\n", "  Supersonic outflows from objects as varied as stellar jets, massive stars and\nnovae often exhibit multiple shock waves that overlap one another. When the\nintersection angle between two shock waves exceeds a critical value, the system\nreconfigures its geometry to create a normal shock known as a Mach stem where\nthe shocks meet. Mach stems are important for interpreting emission-line images\nof shocked gas because a normal shock produces higher postshock temperatures\nand therefore a higher-excitation spectrum than an oblique one does. In this\npaper we summarize the results of a series of numerical simulations and\nlaboratory experiments designed to quantify how Mach stems behave in supersonic\nplasmas that are the norm in astrophysical flows. The experiments test\nanalytical predictions for critical angles where Mach stems should form, and\nquantify how Mach stems grow and decay as intersection angles between the\nincident shock and a surface change. While small Mach stems are destroyed by\nsurface irregularities and subcritical angles, larger ones persist in these\nsituations, and can regrow if the intersection angle changes to become more\nfavorable. The experimental and numerical results show that although Mach stems\noccur only over a limited range of intersection angles and size scales, within\nthese ranges they are relatively robust, and hence are a viable explanation for\nvariable bright knots observed in HST images at the intersections of some bow\nshocks in stellar jets.\n", "  We modified the CLASS code in order to include relativistic galaxy number\ncounts in spatially curved geometries; we present the formalism and study the\neffect of relativistic corrections on spatial curvature. The new version of the\ncode is now publicly available. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we investigate\nhow measurements of the spatial curvature parameter $\\Omega_K$ with future\ngalaxy surveys are affected by relativistic effects, which influence\nobservations of the large scale galaxy distribution. These effects include\ncontributions from cosmic magnification, Doppler terms and terms involving the\ngravitational potential. As an application, we consider angle and redshift\ndependent power spectra, which are especially well suited for model independent\ncosmological constraints. We compute our results for a representative deep,\nwide and spectroscopic survey, and our results show the impact of relativistic\ncorrections on the spatial curvature parameter estimation. We show that\nconstraints on the curvature parameter may be strongly biased if, in\nparticular, cosmic magnification is not included in the analysis. Other\nrelativistic effects turn out to be subdominant in the studied configuration.\nWe analyze how the shift in the estimated best-fit value for the curvature and\nother cosmological parameters depends on the magnification bias parameter, and\nfind that significant biases are to be expected if this term is not properly\nconsidered in the analysis.\n", "  The existence of dark matter (DM) and the origin of the baryon asymmetry are\npersistent indications that the SM is incomplete. More recently, the ATLAS and\nCMS experiments have observed an excess of diphoton events with invariant mass\nof about 750 GeV. One interpretation of this excess is decays of a new spin-0\nparticle with a sizable diphoton partial width, e.g. induced by new heavy\nweakly charged particles. These are also key ingredients in models cogenerating\nasymmetric DM and baryons via sphaleron interactions and an initial particle\nasymmetry. We explore what consequences the new scalar may have for models of\nasymmetric DM that attempt to account for the similarity of the dark and\nvisible matter abundances.\n", "  The Magn\\'eli phase Ti$_4$O$_7$ is an important transition metal oxide with a\nwide range of applications because of its interplay between charge, spin, and\nlattice degrees of freedom. At low temperatures, it has non-trivial magnetic\nstates very close in energy, driven by electronic exchange and correlation\ninteractions. We have examined three low-lying states, one ferromagnetic and\ntwo antiferromagnetic, and calculated their energies as well as Ti spin moment\ndistributions using highly accurate Quantum Monte Carlo methods. We compare our\nresults to those obtained from density functional theory-based methods that\ninclude approximate corrections for exchange and correlation. Our results\nconfirm the nature of the states and their ordering in energy, as compared with\ndensity-functional theory methods. However, the energy differences and spin\ndistributions differ. A detailed analysis suggests that non-local\nexchange-correlation functionals, in addition to other approximations such as\nLDA+U to account for correlations, are needed to simultaneously obtain better\nestimates for spin moments, distributions, energy differences and energy gaps.\n", "  Spin-momentum locking in protected surface states enables efficient\nelectrical detection of magnon decay at a\nmagnetic-insulator/topological-insulator heterojunction. Here we demonstrate\nthis property using the spin Seebeck effect, i.e. measuring the transverse\nthermoelectric response to a temperature gradient across a thin film of yttrium\niron garnet, an insulating ferrimagnet, and forming a heterojunction with\n(BixSb1-x)2Te3, a topological insulator. The non-equilibrium magnon population\nestablished at the interface can decay in part by interactions of magnons with\nelectrons near the Fermi energy of the topological insulator. When this decay\nchannel is made active by tuning (BixSb1-x)2Te3 to a bulk insulator, a large\nelectromotive force emerges in the direction perpendicular to the in-plane\nmagnetization of yttrium iron garnet. The enhanced, tunable spin Seebeck effect\nwhich occurs when the Fermi level lies in the bulk gap offers unique advantages\nover the usual spin Seebeck effect in metals and therefore opens up exciting\npossibilities in spintronics.\n", "  With ZnTe as an example, we use two different methods to unravel the\ncharacteristics of the growth of nanowires by gold-catalyzed molecular beam\nepitaxy at low temperature. In the first approach, CdTe insertions have been\nused as markers, and the nanowires have been characterized by scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy, including geometrical phase analysis, and\nenergy dispersive electron spectrometry; the second approach uses scanning\nelectron microscopy and the statistics of the relationship between the length\nof the tapered nanowires and their base diameter. Axial and radial growth are\nquantified using a diffusion-limited model adapted to the growth conditions;\nanalytical expressions describe well the relationship between the NW length and\nthe total molecular flux (taking into account the orientation of the effusion\ncells), and the catalyst-nanowire contact area. A long incubation time is\nobserved. This analysis allows us to assess the evolution of the diffusion\nlengths on the substrate and along the nanowire sidewalls, as a function of\ntemperature and deviation from stoichiometric flux.\n", "  The Karin cluster is a young asteroid family thought to have formed only\n$\\simeq 5.75$~My ago. The young age can be demonstrated by numerically\nintegrating the orbits of Karin cluster members backward in time and showing\nthe convergence of the perihelion and nodal longitudes (as well as other\norbital elements). Previous work has pointed out that the convergence is not\nideal if the backward integration only accounts for the gravitational\nperturbations from the Solar System planets. It improves when the thermal\nradiation force known as the Yarkovsky effect it is accounted for. This\nargument can be used to estimate the spin obliquities of the Karin cluster\nmembers. Here we take advantage of the fast growing membership of the Karin\ncluster and show that the obliquity distribution of diameter $D\\simeq 1-2$ km\nKarin asteroids is bimodal, as expected if the YORP effect acted to move\nobliquities toward the extreme values ($0^\\circ$ or $180^\\circ$). The measured\nmagnitude of the effect is consistent with the standard YORP model. The surface\nthermal conductivity is inferred to be $0.07$-0.2 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ (thermal\ninertia $\\simeq 300-500$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$). We find that the\nstrength of the YORP effect is roughly $\\simeq 0.7$ of the nominal strength\nobtained for a collection of random Gaussian spheroids. These results are\nconsistent with a surface composed of rough, rocky regolith. The obliquity\nvalues predicted here for 480 members of the Karin cluster can be validated by\nthe light-curve inversion method.\n", "  The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) carried out high-cadence\ntime-series observations of 20.1 square degrees centered on the South Celestial\nPole during the 2008, 2009 & 2010 winter seasons from Dome A in Antarctica. The\nnearly-continuous 6 months of dark conditions during each observing season\nallowed for >10^6 images to be collected through gri and clear filters,\nresulting in the detection of >10^4 sources over the course of 3 years of\noperation. The nearly space-like conditions in the Antarctic plateau are an\nideal testbed for the suitability of very small-aperture (<20 cm) telescopes to\ndetect transient events, variable stars and stellar flares. We present the\nresults of a robust search for such objects using difference image analysis of\nthe data obtained during the 2009 & 2010 winter seasons. While no transients\nwere found, we detected 29 flaring events and find a normalized flaring rate of\n5+\\-4x10^-7 flare/hour for late-K dwarfs, 1+\\-1x10^-6 flare/hour for M dwarfs\nand 7+\\-1x10^-7 flare/hour for all other stars in our sample. We suggest future\nsmall-aperture telescopes planned for deployment at Dome A would benefit from a\ntracking mechanism, to help alleviate effects from ghosting, and a finer pixel\nscale, to increase the telescope's sensitivity to faint objects. We find that\nthe light curves of non-transient sources have excellent photometric qualities\nonce corrected for systematics, and are limited only by photon noise and\natmospheric scintillation.\n", "  Photometry of moving sources typically suffers from reduced signal-to-noise\n(SNR) or flux measurements biased to incorrect low values through the use of\ncircular apertures. To address this issue we present the software package,\nTRIPPy: TRailed Image Photometry in Python. TRIPPy introduces the pill\naperture, which is the natural extension of the circular aperture appropriate\nfor linearly trailed sources. The pill shape is a rectangle with two\nsemicircular end-caps, and is described by three parameters, the trail length\nand angle, and the radius. The TRIPPy software package also includes a new\ntechnique to generate accurate model point-spread functions (PSF) and trailed\npoint-spread functions (TSF) from stationary background sources in sidereally\ntracked images. The TSF is merely the convolution of the model PSF, which\nconsists of a moffat profile, and super sampled lookup table. From the TSF,\naccurate pill aperture corrections can be estimated as a function of pill\nradius with a accuracy of 10 millimags for highly trailed sources. Analogous to\nthe use of small circular apertures and associated aperture corrections, small\nradius pill apertures can be used to preserve signal-to-noise of low flux\nsources, with appropriate aperture correction applied to provide an accurate,\nunbiased flux measurement at all SNR.\n", "  We demonstrate coherent microwave control of rotational and hyperfine states\nof trapped, ultracold, and chemically stable $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules.\nStarting with all molecules in the absolute rovibrational and hyperfine ground\nstate, we study rotational transitions in combined magnetic and electric fields\nand explain the rich hyperfine structure. Following the transfer of the entire\nmolecular ensemble into a single hyperfine level of the first rotationally\nexcited state, $J{=}1$, we observe collisional lifetimes of more than $3\\, \\rm\ns$, comparable to those in the rovibrational ground state, $J{=}0$. Long-lived\nensembles and full quantum state control are prerequisites for the use of\nultracold molecules in quantum simulation, precision measurements and quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  Density fitting is used throughout quantum chemistry to simplify the\nelectron-electron interaction energy (EE). A fundamental property of quantum\nchemistry, and DFT in particular, is that a variational principle connects the\nEE to a potential. Density fitting generally does not preserve this connection.\nHerein, we describe the construction of a robust EE that is variationally\nconnected to fitted potentials in all electronic structure methods. For DFT,\nthis results in new fitting equations which are satisfied at an energy saddle\npoint in multidimensional fitting space.\n", "  We derive general relations between maximum power, maximum efficiency, and\nminimum dissipation regimes from linear irreversible thermodynamics. The\nrelations simplify further in the presence of a particular symmetry of the\nOnsager matrix, which can be derived from detailed balance. The results are\nillustrated on a periodically driven system and a three terminal device subject\nto an external magnetic field.\n", "  Plenoptic imaging is a promising optical modality that simultaneously\ncaptures the location and the propagation direction of light in order to enable\nthree-dimensional imaging in a single shot. However, in classical imaging\nsystems, the maximum spatial and angular resolutions are fundamentally linked;\nthereby, the maximum achievable depth of field is inversely proportional to the\nspatial resolution. We propose to take advantage of the second-order\ncorrelation properties of light to overcome this fundamental limitation. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that the momentum/position correlation of chaotic\nlight leads to the enhanced refocusing power of correlation plenoptic imaging\nwith respect to standard plenoptic imaging.\n", "  Measurement uncertainty relations are lower bounds on the errors of any\napproximate joint measurement of two or more quantum observables. The aim of\nthis paper is to provide methods to compute optimal bounds of this type. The\nbasic method is semidefinite programming, which we apply to arbitrary finite\ncollections of projective observables on a finite dimensional Hilbert space.\nThe quantification of errors is based on an arbitrary cost function, which\nassigns a penalty to getting result $x$ rather than y, for any pair (x,y). This\ninduces a notion of optimal transport cost for a pair of probability\ndistributions, and we include an appendix with a short summary of optimal\ntransport theory as needed in our context. There are then different ways to\nform an overall figure of merit from the comparison of distributions. We\nconsider three, which are related to different physical testing scenarios. The\nmost thorough test compares the transport distances between the marginals of a\njoint measurement and the reference observables for every input state. Less\ndemanding is a test just on the states for which a \"true value\" is known in the\nsense that the reference observable yields a definite outcome. Finally, we can\nmeasure a deviation as a single expectation value by comparing the two\nobservables on the two parts of a maximally entangled state. All three error\nquantities have the property that they vanish if and only if the tested\nobservable is equal to the reference. The theory is illustrated with some\ncharacteristic examples.\n", "  We present new spectral line observations of the CH3CN molecule in the\naccretion disk around the massive protostar IRAS 20126+4104 with the\nSubmillimeter Array that for the first time measure the disk density,\ntemperature, and rotational velocity with sufficient resolution (0.37\",\nequivalent to ~600 AU) to assess the gravitational stability of the disk\nthrough the Toomre-Q parameter. Our observations resolve the central 2000 AU\nregion that shows steeper velocity gradients with increasing upper state\nenergy, indicating an increase in the rotational velocity of the hotter gas\nnearer the star. Such spin-up motions are characteristics of an accretion flow\nin a rotationally supported disk. We compare the observed data with synthetic\nimage cubes produced by three-dimensional radiative transfer models describing\na thin flared disk in Keplerian motion enveloped within the centrifugal radius\nof an angular-momentum-conserving accretion flow. Given a luminosity of\n1.3x10^4 Lsun, the optimized model gives a disk mass of 1.5 Msun and a radius\nof 858 AU rotating about a 12.0 Msun protostar with a disk mass accretion rate\nof 3.9x10^{-5} Msun/yr. Our study finds that, in contrast to some theoretical\nexpectations, the disk is hot and stable to fragmentation with Q > 2.8 at all\nradii which permits a smooth accretion flow. These results put forward the\nfirst constraints on gravitational instabilities in massive protostellar disks,\nwhich are closely connected to the formation of companion stars and planetary\nsystems by fragmentation.\n", "  [Abridged] Aims. We study the properties of filamentary structures from the\nATLASGAL survey.\n  Methods. We use the DisPerSE algorithm to identify spatially coherent\nstructures located across the inner-Galaxy (300 < l < 60 and |b| < 1.5).\n  Results. We have determined distances, masses and physical sizes for 241 of\nthe filamentary structures. We find a median distance of 3.8 kpc, a mean mass\nof a few 10^3 m_sun, a mean length of ~6pc and a mass-to-length ratio of (M/L)\n~200-2000M_sun/ pc. We also find that these filamentary structures are tightly\ncorrelated with the spiral arms in longitude and velocity, and that their\nsemi-major axis is preferentially aligned parallel to the Galactic mid-plane\nand therefore with the direction of large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We\nfind many examples where the dense filaments identified in ATLASGAL are\nassociated with larger scale filamentary structures (~100 pc), and argue that\nthis is likely to be common, and as such these may indicate a connection\nbetween large-scale Galactic dynamics and star formation.\n  Conclusions. We have produced a large and Galaxy-wide catalogue of dense\nfilamentary structures that are representative of a particular size and mass\nrange not previously well studied in the literature. Analyses of the properties\nand distribution of these filaments reveals that they are correlated with the\nspiral arms and make a significant contribution to star formation in the\nGalaxy. Massive star formation is ongoing within ~20% of the filaments and is\nstrongly correlated with the filaments with the largest mass-to- length ratios.\nThe luminosity of the embedded sources has a similar distribution to the\nGalactic-wide samples of young massive stars and can therefore be considered to\nbe representative.\n", "  We consider non-spherically symmetric perturbations of the uncharged black\nstring/flat black brane in the large dimension (D) limit of general relativity.\nWe express the perturbations in a simplified form using variables introduced by\nIshibashi and Kodama. We apply the large D limit to the equations, and show\nthat this leads to decoupling of the equations in the near-horizon and\nasymptotic regions. It also enables use of matched asymptotic expansions to\nobtain approximate analytical solutions and to analyze stability of the black\nstring/brane. For a large class of non-spherically symmetric perturbations, we\nprove that there are no instabilities in the large D limit. For the rest, we\nprovide additional matching arguments that indicate that the black string/brane\nis stable. In the \\emph{static} limit, we show that for \\emph{all}\nnon-spherically symmetric perturbations, there is no instability. This is proof\nthat the Gross-Perry-Yaffe mode for semiclassical black hole perturbations is\nthe unique unstable mode even in the large D limit. This work is also a direct\nanalytical indication that the only instability of the black string is the\nGregory-Laflamme instability.\n", "  Attosecond light pulses in the extreme ultraviolet have drawn a great deal of\nattention due to their ability to interrogate electronic dynamics in real time.\nNevertheless, to follow charge dynamics and excitations in materials, element\nselectivity is a prerequisite, which demands such pulses in the soft X-ray\nregion, above 200 eV, to simultaneously cover several fundamental absorption\nedges of the constituents of the materials. Here, we experimentally demonstrate\nthe exploitation of a transient phase matching regime to generate carrier\nenvelope controlled soft X-ray supercontinua with pulse energies up to 2.9 +/-\n0.1 pJ and a flux of (7.3 +/- 0.1)x10^7 photons/s across the entire water\nwindow and attosecond pulses with 13 as transform limit. Our results herald\nattosecond science at the fundamental absorption edges of matter by bridging\nthe gap between ultrafast temporal resolution and element specific probing.\n", "  In the coming years, high contrast imaging surveys are expected to reveal the\ncharacteristics of the population of wide-orbit, massive, exoplanets. To date,\na handful of wide planetary mass companions are known, but only one such\nmulti-planet system has been discovered: HR8799. For low mass planetary\nsystems, multi-planet interactions play an important role in setting system\narchitecture. In this paper, we explore the stability of these high mass,\nmulti-planet systems. While empirical relationships exist that predict how\nsystem stability scales with planet spacing at low masses, we show that\nextrapolating to super-Jupiter masses can lead to up to an order of magnitude\noverestimate of stability for massive, tightly packed systems. We show that at\nboth low and high planet masses, overlapping mean motion resonances trigger\nchaotic orbital evolution, which leads to system instability. We attribute some\nof the difference in behavior as a function of mass to the increasing\nimportance of second order resonances at high planet-star mass ratios. We use\nour tailored high mass planet results to estimate the maximum number of planets\nthat might reside in double component debris disk systems, whose gaps may\nindicate the presence of massive bodies.\n", "  We report a detection of differences in ion and neutral velocities in\nprominences using high resolution spectral data obtained in September 2012 at\nthe German Vacuum Tower Telescope (Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife). A time\nseries of scans of a small portion of a solar prominence was obtained\nsimultaneously with a high cadence using the lines of two elements with\ndifferent ionization states, namely the CaII 8542 A and the HeI 10830 A.\nDisplacements, widths and amplitudes of both lines were carefully compared to\nextract dynamical information about the plasma. Many dynamical features are\ndetected, such as counterstreaming flows, jets and propagating waves. In all\nthe cases we find very strong correlation between the parameters extracted from\nthe lines of both elements, confirming that both trace the same plasma.\nNevertheless, we also find short-lived transients where this correlation is\nlost. These transients are associated with the ion-neutral drift velocities of\nthe order of several hundred m/s. The patches of non-zero drift velocity show\ncoherence on time-distance diagrams.\n", "  Non-sequential double recombination (NSDR) high-order harmonic generation\n(HHG) is studied in a molecular system. We observe a unique molecular\ntwo-electron effect with a characteristic cutoff in the HHG spectrum at higher\nenergies than what was previously seen for NSDR HHG in atoms. The effect is\ncorroborated with a classical model where it is found that the effect is\nsensitive to the molecular potential and originates from same period emission\nand recombination (SPEaR) of two electrons. The effect persists for\nintermediate nuclear distances of $R \\gtrsim 8.0$ a.u.\n", "  In an effort to measure the masses of planets discovered by the NASA {\\it K2}\nmission, we have conducted precise Doppler observations of five stars with\ntransiting planets. We present the results of a joint analysis of these new\ndata and previously published Doppler data. The first star, an M dwarf known as\nK2-3 or EPIC~201367065, has three transiting planets (\"b\", with radius\n$2.1~R_{\\oplus}$; \"c\", $1.7~R_{\\oplus}$; and \"d\", $1.5~R_{\\oplus}$). Our\nanalysis leads to the mass constraints: $M_{b}=8.1^{+2.0}_{-1.9}~M_{\\oplus}$\nand $M_{c}$ < $ 4.2~M_{\\oplus}$~(95\\%~conf.). The mass of planet d is poorly\nconstrained because its orbital period is close to the stellar rotation period,\nmaking it difficult to disentangle the planetary signal from spurious Doppler\nshifts due to stellar activity. The second star, a G dwarf known as K2-19 or\nEPIC~201505350, has two planets (\"b\", $7.7~R_{\\oplus}$; and \"c\",\n$4.9~R_{\\oplus}$) in a 3:2 mean-motion resonance, as well as a shorter-period\nplanet (\"d\", $1.1~R_{\\oplus}$). We find $M_{b}$= $28.5^{+5.4}_{-5.0}\n~M_{\\oplus}$, $M_{c}$= $25.6^{+7.1}_{-7.1} ~M_{\\oplus}$ and $M_{d}$ <\n$14.0~M_{\\oplus} $~(95\\%~conf.). The third star, a G dwarf known as K2-24 or\nEPIC~203771098, hosts two transiting planets (\"b\", $5.7~R_{\\oplus}$; and \"c\",\n$7.8~R_{\\oplus}$) with orbital periods in a nearly 2:1 ratio. We find $M_{b}$=\n$19.8^{+4.5}_{-4.4} ~M_{\\oplus}$ and $M_{c}$ =\n$26.0^{+5.8}_{-6.1}~M_{\\oplus}$.....\n", "  Taking an open quantum systems approach, we derive a collective equation of\nmotion for the dynamics of a matter-wave bright soliton moving through a\nthermal cloud of a distinct atomic species. The reservoir interaction involves\nenergy transfer without particle transfer between the soliton and thermal\ncloud, thus damping the soliton motion without altering its stability against\ncollapse. We derive a Langevin equation for the soliton centre of mass velocity\nin the form of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with analytical drift and\ndiffusion coefficients. This collective motion is confirmed by simulations of\nthe full stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the matter-wave\nfield. The system offers a pathway for experimentally observing the elusive\nenergy-damping reservoir interaction, and a clear realization of collective\nBrownian motion for a mesoscopic superfluid droplet.\n", "  The parquet decomposition of the self-energy into classes of diagrams, those\nassociated with specific scattering processes, can be exploited for different\nscopes. In this work, the parquet decomposition is used to unravel the\nunderlying physics of non-perturbative numerical calculations. We show the\nspecific example of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its cluster\nextensions (DCA) applied to the Hubbard model at half-filling and with hole\ndoping: These techniques allow for a simultaneous determination of two-particle\nvertex functions and self-energies, and hence, for an essentially \"exact\"\nparquet decomposition at the single-site or at the cluster level. Our\ncalculations show that the self-energies in the underdoped regime are dominated\nby spin scattering processes, consistent with the conclusions obtained by means\nof the fluctuation diagnostics approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 236402 (2015)].\nHowever, differently from the latter approach, the parquet procedure displays\nimportant changes with increasing interaction: Even for relatively moderate\ncouplings, well before the Mott transition, singularities appear in different\nterms, with the notable exception of the predominant spin-channel. We explain\nprecisely how these singularities, which partly limit the utility of the\nparquet decomposition, and - more generally - of parquet-based algorithms, are\nnever found in the fluctuation diagnostics procedure. Finally, by a more\nrefined analysis, we link the occurrence of the parquet singularities in our\ncalculations to a progressive suppression of charge fluctuations and the\nformation of an RVB state, which are typical hallmarks of a pseudogap state in\nDCA.\n", "  We present new binary stellar evolution models that include the effects of\ntidal forces, rotation, and magnetic torques with the goal of testing Planetary\nNebulae (PNe) shaping via binary interaction. We explore whether tidal\ninteraction with a companion can spin up the AGB envelope. To do so we have\nselected binary systems with main sequence masses of 2.5 \\Mo and of 0.8 \\Mo and\nevolve them allowing initial separations of 5, 6, 7, and 8 AU. The binary\nstellar evolution models have been computed all the way to the PNe formation\nphase or until Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) is reached, whatever happens first.\nWe show that with initial separations of 7 and 8 AU, the binary avoids entering\ninto RLOF, and the AGB star reaches moderate rotational velocities at the\nsurface ($\\sim 3.5 $ and $\\sim 2 $ \\kms respectively) during the inter-pulse\nphases, but after the thermal pulses it drops to a final rotational velocity of\nonly $\\sim 0.03 $ \\kms. For the closest binary separations explored, 5 and 6\nAU, the AGB star reaches rotational velocities of $\\sim 6 $ and $\\sim 4 $ \\kms\nrespectively when the RLOF is initiated. We conclude that the detached binary\nmodels that avoid entering the RLOF phase during the AGB will not shape bipolar\nPNe, since the acquired angular momentum is lost via the wind during the last\ntwo thermal pulses. This study rules out tidal spin-up in non-contact binaries\nas a sufficient condition to form bipolar PNe.\n", "  Because of the large neutron excess of $^{22}$Ne, this isotope rapidly\nsediments in the interior of the white dwarfs. This process releases an\nadditional amount of energy, thus delaying the cooling times of the white\ndwarf. This influences the ages of different stellar populations derived using\nwhite dwarf cosmochronology. Furthermore, the overabundance of $^{22}$Ne in the\ninner regions of the star, modifies the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency, thus\naltering the pulsational properties of these stars. In this work, we discuss\nthe impact of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation in white dwarfs resulting from Solar\nmetallicity progenitors ($Z=0.02$). We performed evolutionary calculations of\nwhite dwarfs of masses $0.528$, $0.576$, $0.657$ and $0.833$ M$_{\\sun}$,\nderived from full evolutionary computations of their progenitor stars, starting\nat the Zero Age Main Sequence all the way through central hydrogen and helium\nburning, thermally-pulsing AGB and post-AGB phases. Our computations show that\nat low luminosities ($\\log(L/L_{\\sun})\\la -4.25$), $^{22}$Ne sedimentation\ndelays the cooling of white dwarfs with Solar metallicity progenitors by about\n1~Gyr. Additionally, we studied the consequences of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation on\nthe pulsational properties of ZZ~Ceti white dwarfs. We find that $^{22}$Ne\nsedimentation induces differences in the periods of these stars larger than the\npresent observational uncertainties, particularly in more massive white dwarfs.\n", "  Many features of Bloch oscillations in one-dimensional quantum lattices with\na static force can be described by quasiclassical considerations for example by\nmeans of the acceleration theorem, at least for Hermitian systems. Here the\nquasiclassical approach is extended to non-Hermitian lattices, which are of\nincreasing interest. The analysis is based on a generalised non-Hermitian phase\nspace dynamics developed recently. Applications to a single-band tight-binding\nsystem demonstrate that many features of the quantum dynamics can be understood\nfrom this classical description qualitatively and even quantitatively. Two\nnon-Hermitian and $PT$-symmetric examples are studied, a Hatano-Nelson lattice\nwith real coupling constants and a system with purely imaginary couplings, both\nfor initially localised states in space or in momentum. It is shown that the\ntime-evolution of the norm of the wave packet and the expectation values of\nposition and momentum can be described in a classical picture.\n", "  Pressure induced structural modifications in vitreous Ge$_{x}$Se$_{100-x}$\n(where 10 $\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 25)are investigated using X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) along with supplementary X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments\nand ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Universal changes in\ndistances and angle distributions are observed when scaled to reduced\ndensities. All compositions are observed to remain amorphous under pressure\nvalues up to 42 GPa. The Ge-Se interatomic distances extracted from XAS data\nshow a two-step response to the applied pressure; a gradual decrease followed\nby an increase at around 15-20 GPa, depending on the composition. This increase\nis attributed to the metallization event that can be traced with the red shift\nin Ge K edge energy which is also identified by the principal peak position of\nthe structure factor. The densification mechanisms are studied in details by\nmeans of AIMD simulations and compared to the experimental results. The\nevolution of bond angle distributions, interatomic distances and coordination\nnumbers are examined and lead to similar pressure-induced structural changes\nfor any composition.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of differential emission measure distribution\n(DEM[T]) in various phases of a B8.3 flare, which occurred on July 04, 2009. We\nanalyze the soft X-ray (SXR) emission in 1.6-8.0 keV range, recorded\ncollectively by Solar Photometer in X-rays (SphinX; Polish) and Solar X-ray\nSpectrometer (SOXS; Indian) instruments. We make a comparative investigation of\nthe best-fit DEM[T] distributions derived by employing various inversion\nschemes viz. single gaussian, power-law, functions and Withbroe-Sylwester (W-S)\nmaximum likelihood algorithm. In addition, SXR spectrum in three different\nenergy bands viz. 1.6-5.0 keV (low), 5.0-8.0 keV (high) and 1.6-8.0 keV\n(combined) is analyzed to determine the dependence of the best-fit DEM[T]\ndistribution on the selection of energy interval. The evolution of DEM[T]\ndistribution, derived using W-S algorithm, reveals the plasma of multi-thermal\nnature during the rise to the maximum phase of the flare, while of isothermal\nnature in the post-maximum phase of the flare. Thermal energy content is\nestimated considering the flare plasma to be of 1) iso-thermal and 2)\nmulti-thermal nature. We find that the energy content during the flare,\nestimated from the multi-thermal approach, is in good agreement with that\nderived using the iso-thermal assumption except during the maximum of the\nflare. Further, (multi-) thermal energy estimated employing low-energy band of\nthe SXR spectrum result in higher values than that derived from the\ncombined-energy band. On the contrary, the analysis of high-energy band of SXR\nspectrum lead to lower thermal energy than that estimated from the\ncombined-energy band.\n", "  We present a new algorithm for space telescope high contrast imaging of\nclose-to-face-on planetary disks called Optimized Spatially Filtered (OSFi)\nnormalization. This algorithm is used on HR 8799 Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\ncoronagraphic archival data, showing an over-luminosity after reference star\npoint spread function (PSF) subtraction that may be from the inner disk and/or\nplanetesimal belt components of this system. The PSF-subtracted radial profiles\nin two separate epochs from 2011 and 2012 are consistent with one another, and\nself-subtraction shows no residual in both epochs. We explore a number of\npossible false-positive scenarios that could explain this residual flux,\nincluding telescope breathing, spectral differences between HR 8799 and the\nreference star, imaging of the known warm inner disk component, OSFi algorithm\nthroughput and consistency with the standard spider normalization HST PSF\nsubtraction technique, and coronagraph misalignment from pointing accuracy. In\ncomparison to another similar STIS dataset, we find that the over-luminosity is\nlikely a result of telescope breathing and spectral difference between HR 8799\nand the reference star. Thus, assuming a non-detection, we derive upper limits\non the HR 8799 dust belt mass in small grains. In this scenario, we find that\nthe flux of these micron-sized dust grains leaving the system due to radiation\npressure is small enough to be consistent with measurements of other debris\ndisk halos.\n", "  The spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in a wide energy range can usually be\nwell described by the Band function, which is a two smoothly jointed power laws\ncutting at a breaking energy. Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working\nenergy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can\nbe fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy\nband of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well\neven using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample\nof Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the\nempirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the\nreconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity\ncorrelations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate\nthese two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are\nmodeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both\nluminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.\nMonte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the\nhigh-energy power-law index of the Band function. As a result, the GRB Hubble\ndiagram calibrated using luminosity correlations is almost independent on the\nGRB spectra.\n", "  We investigate the time-resolved quantum transport properties of phonons in\narbitrary harmonic systems connected to phonon baths at different temperatures.\nWe obtain a closed analytic expression of the time-dependent one-particle\nreduced density matrix by explicitly solving the equations of motion for the\nnonequilibrium Green's function. This is achieved through a well-controlled\napproximation of the frequency-dependent bath self-energy. Our result allows\nfor exploring transient oscillations and relaxation times of local heat\ncurrents, and correctly reduces to an earlier known result in the steady-state\nlimit. We apply the formalism to atomic chains, and benchmark the validity of\nthe approximation against full numerical solutions of the bosonic\nKadanoff--Baym equations for the Green's function. We find good agreement\nbetween the analytic and numerical solutions for weak contacts and baths with a\nwide energy dispersion. We further analyze relaxation times from low to high\ntemperature gradients.\n", "  Recent tribological experiments revealed that graphene is able to lubricate\nmacroscale steel-on-steel sliding contacts very effectively both in dry and\nhumid conditions. This effect has been attributed to a mechanical action of\ngraphene related to its load-carrying capacity. Here we provide further insight\ninto the functionality of graphene as lubricant by analysing its tribochemical\naction. By means of first principles calculations we show that graphene binds\nstrongly to native iron surfaces highly reducing their surface energy. Thanks\nto a passivating effect, the metal surfaces coated by graphene become almost\ninert and present very low adhesion and shear strength when mated in a sliding\ncontact. We generalize the result by establishing a connection between the\ntribological and the electronic properties of interfaces, which is relevant to\nunderstand the fundamental nature of frictional forces.\n", "  In a magnetic field, superconductivity is manifested by total magnetic field\nexpulsion (Meissner effect) or by the penetration of integer multiples of the\nflux quantum {\\Phi}_0. Here we present experimental results revealing magnetic\ndipoles formed by Meissner current flowing around artificially introduced\ntopological defects (lattice of antidots). By using scanning Hall probe\nmicroscopy, we have detected ordered magnetic dipole lattice generated at\nspatially periodic antidots in a Pb superconducting film. While the\nconventional homogeneous Meissner state breaks down, the total magnetic flux of\nthe magnetic dipoles remains quantized and is equal to zero. The observed\nmagnetic dipoles strongly depend on the intensity and direction of the locally\nflowing Meissner current, making the magnetic dipoles an effective way to\nmonitor the local supercurrent. We have also investigated the first step of the\nvortex depinning process, where, due to the generation of magnetic dipoles, the\npinned Abrikosov vortices are deformed and shifted from their original pinning\nsites.\n", "  We exploit the continuity equation approach and the `main sequence'\nstar-formation timescales to show that the observed high abundance of galaxies\nwith stellar masses > a few 10^10 M_sun at redshift z>4 implies the existence\nof a galaxy population featuring large star formation rates (SFRs) > 10^2\nM_sun/yr in heavily dust-obscured conditions. These galaxies constitute the\nhigh-redshift counterparts of the dusty star-forming population already\nsurveyed for z<3 in the far-IR band by the Herschel space observatory. We work\nout specific predictions for the evolution of the corresponding stellar mass\nand SFR functions out to z~10, elucidating that the number density at z<8 for\nSFRs >30 M_sun/yr cannot be estimated relying on the UV luminosity function\nalone, even when standard corrections for dust extinction based on the UV slope\nare applied. We compute the number counts and redshift distributions (including\ngalaxy-scale gravitational lensing) of this galaxy population, and show that\ncurrent data from AzTEC-LABOCA, SCUBA-2 and ALMA-SPT surveys are already\ndigging into it. We substantiate how an observational strategy based on a color\npreselection in the far-IR or (sub-)mm band with Herschel and SCUBA-2,\nsupplemented by photometric data via on-source observations with ALMA, can\nallow to reconstruct the bright end of the SFR functions out to z~8. In\nparallel, such a challenging task can be managed by exploiting current UV\nsurveys in combination with (sub-)mm observations by ALMA and NIKA2 and/or\nradio observations by SKA and its precursors.\n", "  KIC 7760680 is so far the richest slowly pulsating B star, by exhibiting 36\nconsecutive dipole ($\\ell=1$) gravity (g-) modes. The monotonically decreasing\nperiod spacing of the series, in addition to the local dips in the pattern\nconfirm that KIC 7760680 is a moderate rotator, with clear mode trapping in\nchemically inhomogeneous layers. We employ the traditional approximation of\nrotation to incorporate rotational effects on g-mode frequencies. Our detailed\nforward asteroseismic modelling of this g-mode series reveals that KIC 7760680\nis a moderately rotating B star with mass $\\sim3.25$ M$_\\odot$. By\nsimultaneously matching the slope of the period spacing, and the number of\nmodes in the observed frequency range, we deduce that the equatorial rotation\nfrequency of KIC 7760680 is 0.4805 day$^{-1}$, which is 26\\% of its Roche break\nup frequency. The relative deviation of the model frequencies and those\nobserved is less than one percent. We succeed to tightly constrain the\nexponentially-decaying convective core overshooting parameter to $f_{\\rm\nov}\\approx0.024\\pm0.001$. This means that convective core overshooting can\ncoexist with moderate rotation. Moreover, models with exponentially-decaying\novershoot from the core outperform those with the classical step-function\novershoot. The best value for extra diffusive mixing in the radiatively stable\nenvelope is confined to $\\log D_{\\rm ext}\\approx0.75\\pm0.25$ (with $D_{\\rm\next}$ in cm$^2$ sec$^{-1}$), which is notably smaller than theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  We revisit the swing amplification model of galactic spiral arms proposed by\nToomre (1981). We describe the derivation of the perturbation equation in\ndetail and investigate the amplification process of stellar spirals. We find\nthat the elementary process of the swing amplification is the phase\nsynchronization of the stellar epicycle motion. Regardless of the initial\nepicycle phase, the epicycle phases of stars in a spiral are synchronized\nduring the amplification. Based on the phase synchronization, we explain the\ndependence of the pitch angle of spirals on the epicycle frequency. We find the\nmost amplified spiral mode and calculate its pitch angle, wavelengths, and\namplification factor, which are consistent with those obtained by the more\nrigorous model based on the Boltzmann equation by Julian and Toomre (1966).\n", "  (ABRIDGED) The evolution and structure of the Magellanic Clouds is presently\nunder debate. The classical scenario where both the Large and Small Magellanic\nClouds (LMC, SMC) are orbiting the Milky Way has been challenged by an\nalternative where the LMC and SMC are in their first close passage to our\nGalaxy. Detailed studies of stellar populations in the galaxies should\nconstrain the proposed scenarios. In particular, the west halo of the SMC was\nrecently characterized with radial trends in age and metallicity which\nindicates tidal disruption. We increase the sample of star clusters in the west\nhalo of the SMC with homogeneous age, metallicity, and distance derivations, to\ndetermine better age and metallicity gradients. Comparisons of observed and\nsynthetic V,(B-V) colour-magnitude diagrams are used to derive parameters for\nwest halo star clusters. We derived age and metallicity for the reference\ncluster NGC 152 compatible with literature parameters. Age and metallicity\ngradients are confirmed in the west halo: 2.6 +/- 0.6 Gyr/deg and -0.19 +/-\n0.09 dex/deg, respectively. Age-metallicity relation for the west halo has low\ndispersion in metallicity and it is compatible with a burst model of chemical\nenrichment. All WH clusters seem to follow the same predicted stellar\ndistribution, with exception of AM-3 that should belong to the counter-bridge.\nBruck 6 is only 130 +/- 40 Myr old and it could have been formed during a\nrecent tidal interaction of the SMC-LMC. We suggest that it is crucial to split\nthe SMC cluster population in groups: main body, wing/bridge, counter-bridge\nand west halo. This is the way to analyse the complex star formation and\ndynamical history of our neighbour. In particular we show that west halo has\nclear age and metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation, also\ncompatible with the dynamical model of tidal influence of the LMC over the SMC.\n", "  We present Subaru/FOCAS and Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy of a\ntidally disrupting Milky Way (MW) globular cluster Palomar 5 and its tidal\nstream. The observed fields are located to cover an angular extent of $\\sim\n17$\\arcdeg along the stream, providing an opportunity to investigate a trend in\nline-of-sight velocities ($V_{\\rm los}$) along the stream, which is essential\nto constrain its orbit and underlying gravitational potential of the Milky\nWay's dark matter halo. A spectral fitting technique is applied to the observed\nspectra to obtain stellar parameters and metallicities ([Fe/H]) of the target\nstars. The 19 stars most likely belonging to the central Pal 5 cluster have a\nmean $V_{\\rm los}$ of $-58.1\\pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and metallicity\n[Fe/H]$=-1.35\\pm 0.06$ dex, both of which are in good agreement with those\nderived in previous high-resolution spectroscopic studies. Assuming that the\nstream stars have the same [Fe/H] as the progenitor cluster, the derived [Fe/H]\nand $V_{\\rm los}$ values are used to estimate the possible $V_{\\rm los}$ range\nof the member stars at each location along the stream. Because of the heavy\ncontamination of the field MW stars, estimated $V_{\\rm los}$ range depends on\nprior assumptions about the stream's $V_{\\rm los}$, which highlights the\nimportance of more definitely identifying the member stars using proper motion\nand chemical abundances to obtain an unbiased information of $V_{\\rm los}$ in\nthe outer part of the Pal 5 stream. The models for the gravitational potential\nof the MW's dark matter halo that are compatible with the estimated $V_{\\rm\nlos}$ range are discussed.\n", "  We have performed a detailed survey simulation of the LSST performance with\nregards to near-Earth objects (NEOs) using the project's current baseline\ncadence. The survey shows that if the project is able to reliably generate\nlinked sets of positions and times (a so-called \"tracklet\") using two\ndetections of a given object per night and can link these tracklets into a\ntrack with a minimum of 3 tracklets covering more than a ~12 day length-of-arc,\nthey would be able to discover 62% of the potentially hazardous asteroids\n(PHAs) larger than 140 m in its projected 10 year survey lifetime. This\ncompleteness would be reduced to 58% if the project is unable to implement a\npipeline using the two detection cadence and has to adopt the four detection\ncadence more commonly used by existing NEO surveys. When including the\nestimated performance from the current operating surveys, assuming these would\ncontinue running until the start of LSST and perhaps beyond, the completeness\nfraction for PHAs larger than 140m would be 73% for the baseline cadence and\n71% for the four detection cadence. This result is a lower than the estimate of\nIvezic et al. (2007,2014); however it is comparable to that of Jones et al.\n(2016) who show completeness ~70$%. We also show that the traditional method of\nusing absolute magnitude H < 22 mag as a proxy for the population with\ndiameters larger than 140m results in completeness values that are too high by\n~5%. Our simulation makes use of the most recent models of the physical and\norbital properties of the NEO populations, as well as simulated cadences and\ntelescope performance estimates provided by LSST. We further show that while\nneither LSST nor a space-based IR platform like NEOCam individually can\ncomplete the survey for 140m diameter NEOs, the combination of these systems\ncan achieve that goal after a decade of observation.\n", "  Recently, both stellar mass-segregation and binary-fractions were uniformly\nmeasured on relatively large samples of Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs).\nSimulations show that both sizeable binary-star populations and\nIntermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) quench mass-segregation in relaxed GCs.\nThus mass-segregation in GCs with a reliable binary-fraction measurement is a\nvaluable probe to constrain IMBHs. In this paper we combine mass-segregation\nand binary-fraction measurements from the literature to build a sample of 33\nGCs (with measured core-binary fractions), and a sample of 43 GCs (with a\nbinary fraction measurement in the area between the core radius and the\nhalf-mass radius). Within both samples we try to identify IMBH-host candidates.\nThese should have relatively low mass-segregation, a low binary fraction (<\n5%), and short (< 1 Gyr) relaxation time. Considering the core binary fraction\nsample, no suitable candidates emerge. If the binary fraction between the core\nand the half-mass radius is considered, two candidates are found, but this is\nlikely due to statistical fluctuations. We also consider a larger sample of 54\nGCs where we obtained an estimate of the core binary fraction using a\npredictive relation based on metallicity and integrated absolute magnitude.\nAlso in this case no suitable candidates are found. Finally, we consider the GC\ncore- to half-mass radius ratio, that is expected to be larger for GCs\ncontaining either an IMBH or binaries. We find that GCs with large core- to\nhalf-mass radius ratios are less mass-segregated (and show a larger binary\nfraction), confirming the theoretical expectation that the energy sources\nresponsible for the large core are also quenching mass-segregation\n", "  We present results on the formation of Pop III stars at redshift 7.6 from the\nRenaissance Simulations, a suite of extremely high-resolution and physics-rich\nradiation transport hydrodynamics cosmological adaptive-mesh refinement\nsimulations of high redshift galaxy formation performed on the Blue Waters\nsupercomputer. In a survey volume of about 220 comoving Mpc$^3$, we found 14\nPop III galaxies with recent star formation. The surprisingly late formation of\nPop III stars is possible due to two factors: (i) the metal enrichment process\nis local and slow, leaving plenty of pristine gas to exist in the vast volume;\nand (ii) strong Lyman-Werner radiation from vigorous metal-enriched star\nformation in early galaxies suppresses Pop III formation in (\"not so\") small\nprimordial halos with mass less than $\\sim$ 3 $\\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\\odot$. We\nquantify the properties of these Pop III galaxies and their Pop III star\nformation environments. We look for analogues to the recently discovered\nluminous Ly $\\alpha$ emitter CR7 (Sobral et al. 2015), which has been\ninterpreted as a Pop III star cluster within or near a metal-enriched star\nforming galaxy. We find and discuss a system similar to this in some respects,\nhowever the Pop III star cluster is far less massive and luminous than CR7 is\ninferred to be.\n", "  Context. Comets are primitive objects, remnants of the volatile-rich\nplanetesimals from which the solar system condensed. Knowing their structure\nand composition is thus crucial for the understanding of our origins. After the\nsuccessful landing of Philae on the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in\nNovember 2014, for the first time, the Rosetta mission provided the opportunity\nto measure the low frequency electrical properties of a cometary mantle with\nthe permittivity probe SESAME-PP (Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic\nMonitoring Experiment - Permittivity Probe).\n  Aims. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the data from active\nmeasurements collected by SESAME-PP at Abydos, which is the final landing site\nof Philae, to constrain the porosity and, to a lesser extent, the composition\nof the surface material down to a depth of about 1 meter.\n  Methods. SESAME-PP observations on the surface are then analyzed by\ncomparison with data acquired during the descent toward the nucleus and with\nnumerical simulations that explore different possible attitudes and\nenvironments of Philae at Abydos using a method called the Capacity-Influence\nMatrix Method.\n  Results. Reasonably assuming that the two receiving electrode channels have\nnot drifted with respect to each other during the ten-year journey of the\nRosetta probe to the comet, we constrain the dielectric constant of the first\nmeter below the surface at Abydos to be > 2.45 p/m 0.20, which is consistent\nwith a porosity < 50% if the dust phase is analogous to carbonaceous chondrites\nand < 75% in the case of less primitive ordinary chondrites. This indicates\nthat the near surface of the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus is\nmore compacted than its interior and suggests that it could consist of a\nsintered dust-ice layer.\n", "  We derive the Landau-Khalatnikov-Frandkin transformation (LKFT) for the\nfermion propagator in quantum electrodynamics (QED) described within a\nbrane-world inspired framework where photons are allowed to move in $d_\\gamma$\nspace-time (bulk) dimensions, while electrons remain confined to a\n$d_e$-dimensional brane, with $d_e < d_\\gamma$, referred to in the literature\nas reduced quantum electrodynamics, RQED$_{d_\\gamma,d_e}$. Specializing to the\ncase of graphene, namely, RQED$_{4,3}$ with massless fermions, we derive the\nnonperturbative form of the fermion propagator starting from its bare\ncounterpart and then compare its weak coupling expansion to known one- and\ntwo-loop perturbative results. The agreement of the gauge-dependent terms of\norder $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha^{2}$ is reminiscent from the structure of LKFT in\nordinary QED in arbitrary space-time dimensions and provides strong constraints\nfor the multiplicative renormalizability of RQED$_{d_\\gamma,d_e}$.\n", "  The radiative feedback of massive stars on molecular clouds creates pillars,\nglobules and other features at the interface between the HII region and\nmolecular cloud. We present here Herschel observations between 70 and 500\nmicron of the immediate environment of the Cygnus OB2 association, performed\nwithin the HOBYS program. All structures were detected based on their\nappearance at 70 micron, and have been classified as pillars, globules,\nevaporating gasous globules (EGGs), proplyd-like objects, and condensations.\nFrom the 70 and 160 micron flux maps, we derive the local FUV field on the PDR\nsurfaces. In parallel, we use a census of the O-stars to estimate the overall\nFUV-field, that is 10^3-10^4 G_0 close to the central OB cluster (within 10 pc)\nand decreases down to a few tens G_0, in a distance of 50 pc. From a SED fit to\nthe four longest Herschel wavelengths, we determine column density and\ntemperature maps and derive masses, volume densities and surface densities for\nthese structures. We find that the morphological classification corresponds to\ndistinct physical properties. Pillars and globules have the longest estimated\nphotoevaporation lifetimes, a few 10^6 yr, while all other features should\nsurvive less than that. These lifetimes are consistent with that found in\nsimulations of turbulent, UV-illuminated clouds. We propose a tentative\nevolutionary scheme in which pillars can evolve into globules, which in turn\nthen evolve into EGGs, condensations and proplyd-like objects.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics simulations in a constant potential ensemble to\nstudy the effects of solution composition on the electrochemical response of a\ndouble layer capacitor. We find that the capacitance first increases with ion\nconcentration following its expected ideal solution behavior, but decreases\nupon approaching a pure ionic liquid in agreement with recent experimental\nobservations. The non-monotonic behavior of the capacitance as a function of\nion concentration results from the competition between the independent motion\nof solvated ions in the dilute regime and solvation fluctuations in the\nconcentrated regime. Mirroring the capacitance, we find that the characteristic\ndecay length of charge density correlations away from the electrode is also\nnon-monotonic. The correlation length first decreases with ion concentration as\na result of better electrostatic screening but increases with ion concentration\nas a result of enhanced steric interactions. When charge fluctuations induced\nby correlated ion-solvent fluctuations are large relative to those induced by\nthe pure ionic liquid, such capacitive behavior is expected to be generic.\n", "  We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 106 GHz\n(Band 3) continuum survey of the complete population of dense cores in the\nChamaeleon I molecular cloud. We detect a total of 24 continuum sources in 19\ndifferent target fields. All previously known Class 0 and Class I protostars in\nChamaeleon I are detected, whereas all of the 56 starless cores in our sample\nare undetected. We show that the Spitzer+Herschel census of protostars in\nChamaeleon I is complete, with the rate at which protostellar cores have been\nmisclassified as starless cores calculated as <1/56, or < 2%. We use synthetic\nobservations to show that starless cores collapsing following the turbulent\nfragmentation scenario are detectable by our ALMA observations when their\ncentral densities exceed ~10^8 cm^-3, with the exact density dependent on the\nviewing geometry. Bonnor-Ebert spheres, on the other hand, remain undetected to\ncentral densities at least as high as 10^10 cm^-3. Our starless core\nnon-detections are used to infer that either the star formation rate is\ndeclining in Chamaeleon I and most of the starless cores are not collapsing,\nmatching the findings of previous studies, or that the evolution of starless\ncores are more accurately described by models that develop less substructure\nthan predicted by the turbulent fragmentation scenario, such as Bonnor-Ebert\nspheres. We outline future work necessary to distinguish between these two\npossibilities.\n", "  Context: The determination of the underlying mechanisms of the magnetic\nelements diffusion over the solar surface is still a challenge. Understanding\nthe formation and evolution of the solar network (NE) is a challenge, because\nit provides a magnetic flux over the solar surface comparable to the flux of\nactive regions at solar maximum. Aims: We investigate the structure and\nevolution of interior cells of solar supergranulation. From Hinode\nobservations, we explore the motions on solar surface at high spatial and\ntemporal resolution. We derive the main organization of the flows inside\nsupergranules and their effect on the magnetic elements. Method: To probe the\nsuperganule interior cell, we used the Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG)\nevolution and their relations to horizontal Results: Evolution of TFG and their\nmutual interactions result in cumulative effects able to build horizontal\ncoherent flows with longer lifetime than granulation (1 to 2 hours) over a\nscale up to 12\\arcsec. These flows clearly act on the diffusion of the\nintranetwork (IN) magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the\nnetwork. Conclusions: From our analysis during 24 hours, TFG appear as one of\nthe major elements of the supergranules which diffuse and advect the magnetic\nfield on the Sun's surface. The strongest supergranules contribute the most to\nmagnetic flux diffusion in the solar photosphere.\n", "  In this work we propose a new diagnostic to segregate cool core (CC) clusters\nfrom non-cool core (NCC) clusters by studying the two-dimensional power spectra\nof the X-ray images observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory. Our sample\ncontains 41 members ($z=0.01\\sim 0.54$), which are selected from the Chandra\narchive when a high photon count, an adequate angular resolution, a relatively\ncomplete detector coverage, and coincident CC-NCC classifications derived with\nthree traditional diagnostics are simultaneously guaranteed. We find that in\nthe log-log space the derived image power spectra can be well represented by a\nconstant model component at large wavenumbers, while at small wavenumbers a\npower excess beyond the constant component appears in all clusters, with a\nclear tendency that the excess is stronger in CC clusters. By introducing a new\nCC diagnostic parameter, i.e., the power excess index (PEI), we classify the\nclusters in our sample and compare the results with those obtained with three\ntraditional CC diagnostics. We find that the results agree with each other very\nwell. By calculating the PEI values of the simulated clusters, we find that the\nnew diagnostic works well at redshifts up to 0.5 for intermediately sized and\nmassive clusters with a typical Chandra or XMM pointing observation. The new CC\ndiagnostic has several advantages over its counterparts, e.g., it is free of\nthe effects of the commonly seen centroid shift of the X-ray halo caused by\nmerger event, and the corresponding calculation is straightforward, almost\nirrelevant to the complicated spectral analysis.\n", "  Negative feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is considered a key\nmechanism in shaping galaxy evolution. Fast, extended outflows are frequently\ndetected in the AGN host galaxies at all redshifts and luminosities, both in\nionised and molecular gas. However, these outflows are only \"potentially\" able\nto quench star formation and we are still missing a decisive evidence of\nnegative feedback in action. Here we present Spectrograph for INtegral Field\nObservations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) H- and K-band integral-field\nspectroscopic observations of two quasars at $z\\sim$2.4 characterised by fast,\nextended outflows detected through the [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 line (Carniani et\nal. 2015). The high signal-to-noise ratio of our observations allows us to\nidentify faint narrow (FWHM $< 500$ km/s), and spatially extended components in\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007 and H$\\alpha$ emission associated with star formation in\nthe host galaxy. Such star-formation powered emission is spatially\nanti-correlated with the fast outflows. The ionised outflows therefore appear\nto be able to suppress star formation in the region where the outflow is\nexpanding. However the detection of narrow, spatially-extended H$\\alpha$\nemission indicates star formation rates of at least $\\sim 50-90$\nM$_{\\odot}$/yr, suggesting either that AGN feedback does not affect the whole\ngalaxy or that many feedback episodes are required before star formation is\ncompletely quenched. On the other hand, the narrow H$\\alpha$ emission extending\nalong the edges of the outflow cone may lead also to a positive feedback\ninterpretation. Our results highlight the possible twofold role of galaxy-wide\noutflows in host galaxy evolution.\n", "  We revisited the unusual wind in GRO J1655-40 detected with Chandra in 2005\nApril, using long-term RXTE X-ray data and simultaneous optical/near-infrared\nphotometric data. This wind is the most convincing case for magnetic driving in\nblack hole binaries, as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of\n10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction. However, the optical and\nnear-infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the Chandra observation,\nwhereas the X-ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand. Yet the\noptical and near-infrared fluxes are from the outer, irradiated disk, so for\nthem to increase implies that the X-rays likewise increased. We applied a new\nirradiated disk model to the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). Fitting the optical and near-infrared fluxes, we estimated the\nintrinsic luminosity at the Chandra epoch was > ~0.7 L_Edd, which is more than\none order of magnitude larger than the observed X-ray luminosity. These results\ncould be explained if a Compton-thick, almost completely ionized gas was\npresent in the wind and strong scattering reduced the apparent X-ray\nluminosity. The effects of scattering in the wind should then be taken into\naccount for discussion of the wind-driving mechanism. Radiation pressure and\nCompton heating may also contribute to powering the wind at this high\nluminosity.\n", "  Elaborating on a formalism that was first expressed some 40 years ago, we\nconsider the brightness of low-lying mm-wave rotational lines of strongly polar\nmolecules at the threshold of detectability. We derive a simple expression\nrelating the brightness to the line of sight integral of the product of the\ntotal gas and molecular number densities and a suitably-defined\ntemperature-dependent excitation rate into the upper level of the transition.\nDetectability of a line is contingent only on the ability of a molecule to\nchannel enough of the ambient thermal energy into the line and the excitation\ncan be computed in bulk by summing over rates without solving the multi-level\nrate equations or computing optical depths and excitation temperatures. Results\nfor \\hcop, HNC and CS are compared with escape-probability solutions of the\nrate equations using closed-form expressions for the expected range of validity\nof our {\\it ansatz}, with the result that gas number densities as high as $10^4\n\\pccc$ or optical depths as high as 100 can be accommodated in some cases. For\ndensities below a well-defined upper bound, the range of validity of the\ndiscussion can be cast as an upper bound on the line brightness which is 0.3 K\nfor the J=1-0 lines and 0.8 - 1.7 K for the J=2-1 lines of these species. The\ndiscussion casts new light on interpretation of line brightnesses under\nconditions of weak excitation, simplifies derivation of physical parameters and\neliminates the need to construct grids of numerical solutions of the rate\nequations.\n", "  This article is an exploration of gamma ray signals of annihilating\nHiggs-portal singlet scalar and vector dark matter. Gamma ray signals are\nconsidered in the context of contributions from annihilations of singlets in\nthe galactic halo to the Isotropic Gamma Ray Background (IGRB), in the context\nof the Galactic center excess, and in the context of observations of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies. We find that Higgs-portal singlets of both species with a\nmass of $~$65 GeV can explain the Galactic center excess with reasonable\naccuracy, but that this mass range is in tension with current direct detection\nbounds. We also find that singlets in the mass range of 250-1000 GeV are\nconsistent with both the Fermi-LAT IGRB observations and direct detection\nbounds. Additionally, bounds from gamma ray observations of the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy Segue I are translated into bounds on the Higgs-portal\ncouplings.\n", "  We study whether the condensation of silicate dust in Mira envelopes could be\ncaused by cluster formation by the abundant SiO molecules. For a simplified\nmodel of the pulsational motions of matter in the the outer layers of a Mira\nvariable which is guided by a numerical model for Mira pulsations, the\nequations of dust nucleation and growth are solved in the co-moving frame of a\nfixed mass element. It is assumed that seed particles form by clustering of SiO\nmolecules. The calculation of the nucleation rate is based on the experimental\ndata of Nuth and Donn (1982). The quantity of dust formed is calculated by a\nmoment method and the calculation of radiation pressure on the dusty gas is\nbased on a dirty silicate model. Dust nucleation occurs in the model at the\nupper culmination of the trajectory of a gas parcel where it stays for a\nconsiderable time at low temperatures while subsequent dust growth occurs\nduring the descending part of the motion and continues after the next shock\nreversed motion. It is found that sufficient dust forms that radiation pressure\nexceeds gravitational pull of the stars such that the mass element is finally\ndriven out of the star. Nucleation of dust particles by clustering of the\nabundant SiO molecules could be the mechanism that triggers silicate dust\nformation in Miras.\n", "  We present near-IR (1.1-2.4 micron) position-position-velocity cubes of the\n500-year-old Orion BN/KL explosive outflow with spatial resolution 1\" and\nspectral resolution 86 km/s. We construct integrated intensity maps free of\ncontinuum sources of 15 H2 and [Fe II] lines while preserving kinematic\ninformation of individual outflow features. Included in the detected H2 lines\nare the 1-0 S(1) and 1-0 Q(3) transitions, allowing extinction measurements\nacross the outflow. Additionally, we present dereddened flux ratios for over\ntwo dozen outflow features to allow for the characterization of the true\nexcitation conditions of the BN/KL outflow. All ratios show the dominance of\nshock excitation of the H2 emission, although some features exhibit signs of\nfluorescent excitation from stellar radiation or J-type shocks. We also detect\ntracers of the PDR/ionization front north of the Trapezium stars in [O I] and\n[Fe II] and analyze other observed outflows not associated with the BN/KL\noutflow.\n", "  In this study, we investigate a scenario that dark matter (DM) has only\ngravitational interaction. In the framework of effective field theory of\ngravity, we find that DM is still stable at tree level even if there is no\nsymmetry to protect its longevity, but could decay into standard model\nparticles due to gravitational loop corrections. The radiative corrections can\nlead to both higher- and lower-dimensional effective operators. We also first\nexplore how DM can be produced in the early universe. Through gravitational\ninteraction at high temperature, DM is then found to have mass around TeV\n$\\lesssim m_X \\lesssim 10^{11}$GeV to get the right relic abundance. When DM\ndecays, it mostly decays into gravitons, which could be tested by current and\nfuture CMB experiments. We also estimate the resulting fluxes for cosmic rays,\ngamma-ray and neutrino.\n", "  The X-ray afterglow of GRB 130831A shows an \"internal plateau\" with a decay\nslope of $\\sim$ 0.8, followed by a steep drop at around $10^5$ s with a slope\nof $\\sim$ 6. After the drop, the X-ray afterglow continues with a much\nshallower decay. The optical afterglow exhibits two segments of plateaus\nseparated by a luminous optical flare, followed by a normal decay with a slope\nbasically consistent with that of the late-time X-ray afterglow. The decay of\nthe internal X-ray plateau is much steeper than what we expect in the simplest\nmagnetar model. We propose a scenario in which the magnetar undergoes\ngravitational-wave-driven r-mode instability, and the spin-down is dominated by\ngravitational wave losses up to the end of the steep plateau, so that such a\nrelatively steep plateau can be interpreted as the internal emission of the\nmagnetar wind and the sharp drop can be produced when the magnetar collapses\ninto a black hole. This scenario also predicts an initial X-ray plateau lasting\nfor hundreds of seconds with an approximately constant flux which is compatible\nwith observation. Assuming that the magnetar wind has a negligible contribution\nin the optical band, we interpret the optical afterglow as the forward shock\nemission by invoking the energy injection from a continuously refreshed shock\nfollowing the prompt emission phase. It is shown that our model can basically\ndescribe the temporal evolution of the multi-band afterglow of GRB 130831A.\n", "  The Santa Barbara cluster comparison project (Frenk et al. Frenk+1999)\nrevealed that there is a systematic difference between entropy profiles of\nclusters of galaxies obtained by Eulerian mesh and Lagrangian smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) codes: Mesh codes gave a core with a constant entropy\nwhereas SPH codes did not. One possible reason for this difference is that mesh\ncodes are not Galilean invariant. Another possible reason is the problem of the\nSPH method, which might give too much \"protection\" to cold clumps because of\nthe unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities. In this\npaper, we apply the density independent formulation of SPH (DISPH), which can\nhandle contact discontinuities accurately, to simulations of a cluster of\ngalaxies, and compare the results with those with the standard SPH. We obtained\nthe entropy core when we adopt DISPH. The size of the core is, however,\nsignificantly smaller than those obtained with mesh simulations, and is\ncomparable to those obtained with quasi-Lagrangian schemes such as \"moving\nmesh\" and \"mesh free\" schemes. We conclude that both the standard SPH without\nartificial conductivity and Eulerian mesh codes have serious problems even such\nan idealized simulation, while DISPH, SPH with artificial conductivity, and\nquasi-Lagrangian schemes have sufficient capability to deal with it.\n", "  With the observations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we present the\nslipping magnetic reconnections with multiple flare ribbons (FRs) during an\nX1.2 eruptive flare on 2014 January 7. A center negative polarity was\nsurrounded by several positive ones, and there appeared three FRs. The three\nFRs showed apparent slipping motions, and hook structures formed at their ends.\nDue to the moving footpoints of the erupting structures, one tight\nsemi-circular hook disappeared after the slippage along its inner and outer\nedge, and coronal dimmings formed within the hook. The east hook also faded as\na result of the magnetic reconnection between the arcades of a remote filament\nand a hot loop that was impulsively heated by the under flare loops. Our\nresults are accordant with the slipping magnetic reconnection regime in 3D\nstandard model for eruptive flares. We suggest that complex structures of the\nflare is likely a consequence of the more complex flux distribution in the\nphotosphere, and the eruption involves at least two magnetic reconnections.\n", "  Aims. We aim to investigate whether a multilayer ice model can be as\nsuccessful as a bulk ice model in reproducing the observed abundances of\nvarious deuterated gas-phase species toward starless cores. Methods. We\ncalculate abundances for various deuterated species as functions of time\nadopting fixed physical conditions. We also estimate abundance gradients by\nadopting a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere as a core model. In the multilayer ice\nscenario, we consider desorption from one or several monolayers on the surface.\nResults. We find that the multilayer model predicts abundances of $\\rm DCO^+$\nand $\\rm N_2D^+$ that are about an order of magnitude lower than observed,\ncaused by the trapping of CO and $\\rm N_2$ into the grain mantle. As a result\nof the mantle trapping, deuteration efficiency in the gas phase increases and\nwe find stronger deuterium fractionation in ammonia than what has been\nobserved. Another distinguishing feature of the multilayer model is that $\\rm\nD_3^+$ becomes the main deuterated ion at high density. The bulk ice model is\ngenerally easily reconciled with observations. Conclusions. Our results\nunderline that more theoretical and experimental work is needed to understand\nthe composition and morphology of interstellar ices, and the desorption\nprocesses that can act on them. With the current constraints, the bulk ice\nmodel appears to be better in reproducing observations than the multilayer ice\nmodel. According to our results, the $\\rm H_2D^+$ to $\\rm N_2D^+$ abundance\nratio is higher than 100 in the multilayer model, while only a few $\\times$ 10\nin the bulk model, and so observations of this ratio could provide information\non the ice morphology in starless cores. Observations of the abundance of $\\rm\nD_3^+$ compared to $\\rm H_2D^+$ and $\\rm D_2H^+$ would provide additional\nconstraints for the models.\n", "  Context. \"Snow lines\", marking regions where abundant volatiles freeze out\nonto the surface of dust grains, play an important role for planet growth and\nbulk composition in protoplanetary disks. They can already be observed in the\nenvelopes of the much younger, low-mass Class 0 protostars that are still in\ntheir early phase of heavy accretion. Aims. We aim at using the information on\nthe sublimation regions of different kinds of ices to understand the chemistry\nof the envelope, its temperature and density structure, and the history of the\naccretion process. Methods. As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have\nobtained observations of C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$ and CH$_3$OH towards nearby\nClass 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at\nsub-arcsecond resolution. For four of these sources we have modeled the\nemission using a chemical code coupled with a radiative transfer module.\nResults. We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC\n1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring\naround the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being\nchemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations\nmatch for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding\nenergy of pure CO ices ($\\sim$855 K). Furthermore, we find very low CO\nabundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude\nlower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in\nmolecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding\nenergy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like\namorphous water ice or in non-polar CO$_2$-rich ice. The low CO abundances are\ncomparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an\nevolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the\nprotostellar phase. (Abbr. Version)\n", "  The distributed chaos driven by Levich-Tsinober (helicity) integral: $I=\\int\n\\langle h({\\bf x},t)~h({\\bf x}+{\\bf r}, t)\\rangle d{\\bf r}$ has been studied.\nIt is shown that the helical distributed chaos can be considered as basis for\ncomplex turbulent flows with interplay between large-scale coherent structures\nand small-scale turbulence, such as Cuette-Taylor flow, wake behind cylinder\nand turbulent flow in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) with inserted limiters. In\nthe last case appearance of the helical distributed chaos, caused by the\nlimiters, results in improvement of radial particle confinement.\n", "  We construct a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions in the\npresence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics with complete set of the\nrotation parameters in arbitrary dimensions. The topology of the horizon of\nthese rotating black branes are flat, while, due to the presence of the dilaton\nfield the asymptotic behaviour of them are neither flat nor (anti)-de Sitter\n[(A)dS]. We investigate the physical properties of the solutions. The mass and\nangular momentum of the spacetime are obtained by using the counterterm method\ninspired by AdS/CFT correspondence. We derive temperature, electric potential\nand entropy associated with the horizon and check the validity of the first law\nof thermodynamics on the black brane horizon. We study thermal stability of the\nsolutions in both canonical and grand canonical ensemble and disclose the\neffects of the rotation parameter, nonlinearity of electrodynamics and dilaton\nfield on the thermal stability conditions. We find the solutions are thermally\nstable for $\\alpha<1$, while for $\\alpha>1$ the solutions may encounter an\nunstable phase where $\\alpha$ is dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant.\n", "  We report the detection of orbital modulation, a model solution, and X-ray\nproperties of a newly discovered contact binary, 2MASS J11201034$-$2201340. We\nserendipitously found this X-ray point source outside the error ellipse when\nsearching for possible X-ray counterparts of $\\gamma$-ray millisecond pulsars\namong the unidentified objects detected by the {\\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope}. The optical counterpart of the X-ray source (unrelated to the\n$\\gamma$-ray source) was then identified using archival databases. The\nlong-term CRTS survey detected a precise signal with a period of\n$P=0.28876208(56)$ days. A follow-up observation made by the SLT telescope of\nLulin Observatory revealed the binary nature of the object. Utilizing archived\nphotometric data of multi-band surveys, we construct the spectral energy\ndistribution, which is well fitted by a K2V spectral template. The fitting\nresult of the orbital profile using the Wilson--Devinney code suggests that\n2MASS J11201034-2201340 is a short-period A-type contact binary and the more\nmassive component has a cool spot. The X-ray emission was first noted in\nobservations made by \\swift\\, then further confirmed and characterized by an\n\\xmm\\ observation. The X-ray spectrum can be described by a power law or\nthermal Bremsstrahlung. Unfortunately, we could not observe significant X-ray\norbital modulation. Finally, according to the spectral energy distribution,\nthis system is estimated to be 690 pc from Earth with a calculated X-ray\nintensity of $(0.7-1.5)\\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is in the expected\nrange of an X-ray emitting contact binary.\n", "  Classical Cepheid variable stars are high-sensitivity probes of stellar\nevolution and fundamental tracers of cosmic distances. While rotational mixing\nsignificantly affects the evolution of Cepheid progenitors (intermediate-mass\nstars), the impact of the resulting changes in stellar structure and\ncomposition on Cepheids on their pulsational properties is hitherto unknown.\nHere we present the first detailed pulsational instability analysis of stellar\nevolution models that include the effects of rotation, for both fundamental\nmode and first overtone pulsation. We employ Geneva evolution models spanning a\nthree-dimensional grid in mass (1.7 - 15 $M_\\odot$), metallicity (Z = 0.014,\n0.006, 0.002), and rotation (non-rotating, average & fast rotation). We\ndetermine (1) hot and cool instability strip (IS) boundaries taking into\naccount the coupling between convection and pulsation, (2) pulsation periods,\nand (3) rates of period change. We investigate relations between period and (a)\nluminosity, (b) age, (c) radius, (d) temperature, (e) rate of period change,\n(f) mass, (g) the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (FWGLR). We\nconfront all predictions aside from those for age with observations, finding\ngenerally excellent agreement. We tabulate period-luminosity relations (PLRs)\nfor several photometric pass-bands and investigate how the finite IS width,\ndifferent IS crossings, metallicity, and rotation affect PLRs. We show that a\nWesenheit index based on H, V, and I photometry is expected to have the\nsmallest intrinsic PLR dispersion. We confirm that rotation resolves the\nCepheid mass discrepancy. Period-age relations depend significantly on rotation\n(rotation increases Cepheid ages), offering a straightforward explanation for\nevolved stars in binary systems that cannot be matched by conventional\nisochrones assuming a single age. Finally, we show that Cepheids obey a tight\nFWGLR.\n", "  Recent studies adopting $\\lambda_{\\rm Re}$, a proxy for specific angular\nmomentum, have highlighted how early-type galaxies (ETGs) are composed of two\nkinematic classes for which distinct formation mechanisms can be inferred. With\nupcoming surveys expected to obtain $\\lambda_{\\rm Re}$ from a broad range of\nenvironments (e.g. SAMI, MaNGA), we investigate in this numerical study how the\n$\\lambda_{\\rm Re}$-$\\epsilon_{\\rm e}$ distribution of fast-rotating dwarf\nsatellite galaxies reflects their evolutionary state. By combining N-body/SPH\nsimulations of progenitor disc galaxies (stellar mass $\\simeq$10$^{\\rm 9}$\nM$_{\\odot}$), their cosmologically-motivated sub-halo infall history and a\ncharacteristic group orbit/potential, we demonstrate the evolution of a\nsatellite ETG population driven by tidal interactions (e.g. harassment). As a\ngeneral result, these satellites remain intrinsically fast-rotating oblate\nstellar systems since their infall as early as $z=2$; mis-identifications as\nslow rotators often arise due to a bar/spiral lifecycle which plays an integral\nrole in their evolution. Despite the idealistic nature of its construction, our\nmock $\\lambda_{\\rm Re}$-$\\epsilon_{\\rm e}$ distribution at $z<0.1$ reproduces\nits observational counterpart from the ATLAS$^{\\rm 3D}$/SAURON projects. We\npredict therefore how the observed $\\lambda_{\\rm Re}$-$\\epsilon_{\\rm e}$\ndistribution of a group evolves according to these ensemble tidal interactions.\n", "  The hot ionized gas of the intra-cluster medium emits thermal radiation in\nthe X-ray band and also distorts the cosmic microwave radiation through the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Combining these two complementary sources of\ninformation through innovative techniques can therefore potentially improve the\ncluster detection rate when compared to using only one of the probes. Our aim\nis to build such a joint X-ray-SZ analysis tool, which will allow us to detect\nfainter or more distant clusters while maintaining high catalogue purity. We\npresent a method based on matched multifrequency filters (MMF) for extracting\ncluster catalogues from SZ and X-ray surveys. We first designed an X-ray\nmatched-filter method, analogous to the classical MMF developed for SZ\nobservations. Then, we built our joint X-ray-SZ algorithm by combining our\nX-ray matched filter with the classical SZ-MMF, for which we used the physical\nrelation between SZ and X-ray observations. We show that the proposed X-ray\nmatched filter provides correct photometry results, and that the joint matched\nfilter also provides correct photometry when the $F_{\\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation\nof the clusters is known. Moreover, the proposed joint algorithm provides a\nbetter signal-to-noise ratio than single-map extractions, which improves the\ndetection rate even if we do not exactly know the $F_{\\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation.\nThe proposed methods were tested using data from the ROSAT all-sky survey and\nfrom the Planck survey.\n", "  An essential step toward elucidating the mechanism of superconductivity is to\ndetermine the sign/phase of superconducting order parameter, as it is closely\nrelated to the pairing interaction. In conventional superconductors, the\nelectron-phonon interaction induces attraction between electrons near the Fermi\nenergy and results in a sign-preserved s-wave pairing. For high-temperature\nsuperconductors, including cuprates and iron-based superconductors, prevalent\nweak coupling theories suggest that the electron pairing is mediated by spin\nfluctuations which lead to repulsive interactions, and therefore that a\nsign-reversed pairing with an s+-or d-wave symmetry is favored. Here, by using\nmagnetic neutron scattering, a phase sensitive probe of superconducting gap, we\nreport the observation of a transition from the sign-reversed to sign-preserved\nCooper-pairing symmetry with insignificant changes in Tc in the S-doped iron\nselenide superconductors KxFe2-y(Se1-zSz)2. We show that a rather sharp\nmagnetic resonant mode well below the superconducting gap (2delta) in the\nundoped sample (z = 0) is replaced by a broad hump structure above 2delta under\n50% S doping. These results cannot be readily explained by simple spin\nfluctuation-exchange pairing theories and, therefore, multiple pairing channels\nare required to describe superconductivity in this system. Our findings may\nalso yield a simple explanation for the sometimes contradictory data on the\nsign of the superconducting order parameter in iron-based materials.\n", "  We present optical photometry of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN), ASASSN-15jd.\nIts light curve showed a small dip in the middle of the superoutburst in 2015\nfor the first time among WZ Sge-type DNe. The unusual light curve implies a\ndelay in the growth of the 3:1 resonance tidal instability. Also, the light\ncurve is similar to those of other two WZ Sge-type stars, SSS\nJ122221.7$-$311523 and OT J184228.1$+$483742, which are believed to be the best\ncandidates for a period bouncer on the basis of their small values of the mass\nratio ($q \\equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$). Additionally, the small mean superhump\namplitude ($<$ 0.1 mag) and the long duration of no ordinary superhumps at the\nearly stage of the superoutburst are common to the best candidates for a period\nbouncer. The average superhump period was $P_{\\rm sh}$ = 0.0649810(78) d and no\nearly superhumps were detected. Although we could not estimate the mass ratio\nof ASASSN-15jd with high accuracy, this object is expected to be a candidate\nfor a period bouncer, a binary accounting for the missing population of\npost-period minimum cataclysmic variables, based on the above characteristics.\n", "  $\\mu$ Her is a nearby quadruple system with a G-subgiant primary and several\nlow mass companions arranged in a 2+2 architecture. While the BC components\nhave been well characterized, the Ab component has been detected\nastrometrically and with direct imaging but there has been some confusion over\nits nature, in particular whether the companion is stellar or substellar. Using\nnear-infrared spectroscopy we are able to estimate the spectral type of the\ncompanion as a M4$\\pm$1V star. In addition, we have measured the astrometry of\nthe system for over a decade. We combined the astrometry with archival radial\nvelocity measurements to compute an orbit of the system. From the combined\norbit, we are able to compute the mass sum of the system. Using the estimated\nmass of the primary, we estimate the mass of the secondary as 0.32 M_sun, which\nagrees with the estimated spectral type. Our computed orbit is preliminary due\nto the incomplete orbital phase coverage, but it should be sufficient to\npredict ephemerides over the next decade.\n", "  Data gridding is a common task in astronomy and many other science\ndisciplines. It refers to the resampling of irregularly sampled data to a\nregular grid. We present cygrid, a library module for the general purpose\nprogramming language Python. Cygrid can be used to resample data to any\ncollection of target coordinates, although its typical application involves\nFITS maps or data cubes. The FITS world coordinate system standard is\nsupported. The regridding algorithm is based on the convolution of the original\nsamples with a kernel of arbitrary shape. We introduce a lookup table scheme\nthat allows us to parallelize the gridding and combine it with the HEALPix\ntessellation of the sphere for fast neighbor searches. We show that for $n$\ninput data points, cygrids runtime scales between O(n) and O(n log n) and\nanalyze the performance gain that is achieved using multiple CPU cores. We also\ncompare the gridding speed with other techniques, such as nearest-neighbor, and\nlinear and cubic spline interpolation. Cygrid is a very fast and versatile\ngridding library that significantly outperforms other third-party Python\nmodules, such as the linear and cubic spline interpolation provided by SciPy.\n", "  In a recent paper, Liu et al. [Nat. Commun. 6:6726 (2015)] claim to perform\nthe first room temperature entanglement-enhanced phase measurement in a\nsolid-state system. We argue here that this claim is incorrect: their\nmeasurement is not enhanced because of the entanglement in their system, but\ninstead the enhancement comes from the fact that the phase shift is applied\ntwice to their state.\n", "  The Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE) is apparently extended X-ray\nemission along the Galactic Plane. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by hard\ncontinuum with a strong Fe K emission feature in the 6-7 keV band. A\nsubstantial fraction (~80%) of the GRXE in the Fe band was resolved into point\nsources by deep Chandra imaging observations, thus GRXE is mostly composed of\ndim Galactic X-ray point sources at least in this energy band. To investigate\nthe populations of these dim X-ray point sources, we carried out Near-Infrared\n(NIR) follow-up spectroscopic observations in two deep Chandra fields located\nin the Galactic plane at (l,b)=(0.1{\\arcdeg}, -1.4{\\arcdeg}) and\n(28.5{\\arcdeg}, 0.0{\\arcdeg}) using NTT/SofI and Subaru/MOIRCS. We obtained\nwell-exposed NIR spectra from 65 objects and found that there are three main\nclasses of Galactic sources based on the X-ray color and NIR spectral features:\nthose having (A) hard X-ray spectra and NIR emission features such as\nHI(Br{\\gamma}), HeI, and HeII (2 objects), (B) soft X-ray spectra and NIR\nabsorption features such as HI, NaI, CaI, and CO (46 objects), and (C) hard\nX-ray spectra and NIR absorption features such as HI, NaI, CaI and CO (17\nobjects). From these features, we argue that class A sources are Cataclysmic\nVariables (CVs), and class B sources are late-type stars with enhanced coronal\nactivity, which is in agreement with current knowledge. Class C sources\npossibly belong to a new group of objects, which has been poorly studied so\nfar. We argue that the candidate sources for class C are the binary systems\nhosting white dwarfs and late-type companions with very low accretion rates. It\nis likely that this newly recognized class of the sources contribute to a\nnon-negligible fraction of the GRXE, especially in the Fe K band.\n", "  The correlations between global description of the ground state properties\n(binding energies, charge radii) and nuclear matter properties of the\nstate-of-the-art covariant energy density functionals have been studied. It was\nconcluded that the strict enforcement of the constraints on the nuclear matter\nproperties (NMP) defined in Ref.\\ \\cite{RMF-nm} will not necessary lead to the\nfunctionals with good description of the binding energies and other ground and\nexcited state properties. In addition, it will not substantially reduce the\nuncertainties in the predictions of the binding energies in neutron-rich\nsystems. It turns out that the functionals, which come close to satisfying\nthese NMP constraints, have some problems in the description of existing data.\nOn the other hand, these problems are either absent or much smaller in the\nfunctionals which are carefully fitted to finite nuclei but which violate some\nNMP constraints. This is a consequence of the fact that the properties of\nfinite nuclei are defined not only by nuclear matter properties but also by\nunderlying shell effects. The mismatch of phenomenological content, existing in\nall modern functionals, related to nuclear matter physics and the physics of\nfinite nuclei could also be responsible.\n", "  Aims: We investigate how much of the [CII] emission in the nucleus of the\nnearby spiral galaxy IC 342 is contributed by PDRs and by the ionized gas. We\nexamine the spatial variations of starburst/PDR activity and study the\ncorrelation of the [CII] line with the [NII] 205{\\textmu}m emission line coming\nexclusively from the HII regions. Methods: We present small maps of [CII] and\n[NII] lines recently observed with the GREAT receiver on board SOFIA. In\nparticular we present a super-resolution method to derive how unresolved,\nkinematically correlated structures in the beam contribute to the observed line\nshapes. Results: We find that the emission coming from the ionized gas shows a\nkinematic component in addition to the general Doppler signature of the\nmolecular gas. We interpret this as the signature of two bi-polar lobes of\nionized gas expanding out of the galactic plane. We then show how this requires\nan adaptation of our understanding of the geometrical structure of the nucleus\nof IC~342. Examining the starburst activity we find ratios\n$I([CII])/I(^{12}\\mathrm{CO} (1-0))$ between 400 and 1800 in energy units.\nApplying predictions from numerical models of HII and PDR regions to derive the\ncontribution from the ionized phase to the total [CII] emission we find that\n35-90% of the observed [CII] intensity stems from the ionized gas if both\nphases contribute. Averaged over the central few hundred parsec we find for the\n[CII] contribution a HII-to-PDR ratio of 70:30. Conclusions: The ionized gas in\nthe center of IC 342 contributes more strongly to the overall [CII] emission\nthan is commonly observed on larger scales and than is predicted. Kinematic\nanalysis shows that the majority of the [CII] emission is related to the strong\nbut embedded star formation in the nuclear molecular ring and only marginally\nemitted from the expanding bi-polar lobes of ionized gas.\n", "  The young star beta Pictoris is well known for its dusty debris disk,\nproduced through the grinding down by collisions of planetesimals,\nkilometre-sized bodies in orbit around the star. In addition to dust, small\namounts of gas are also known to orbit the star, likely the result from\nvaporisation of violently colliding dust grains. The disk is seen edge on and\nfrom previous absorption spectroscopy we know that the gas is very rich in\ncarbon relative to other elements. The oxygen content has been more difficult\nto assess, however, with early estimates finding very little oxygen in the gas\nat a C/O ratio 20x higher than the cosmic value. A C/O ratio that high is\ndifficult to explain and would have far-reaching consequences for planet\nformation. Here we report on observations by the far-infrared space telescope\nHerschel, using PACS, of emission lines from ionised carbon and neutral oxygen.\nThe detected emission from C+ is consistent with that previously reported being\nobserved by the HIFI instrument on Herschel, while the emission from O is hard\nto explain without assuming a higher-density region in the disk, perhaps in the\nshape of a clump or a dense torus, required to sufficiently excite the O atoms.\nA possible scenario is that the C/O gas is produced by the same process\nresponsible for the CO clump recently observed by ALMA in the disk, and that\nthe re-distribution of the gas takes longer than previously assumed. A more\ndetailed estimate of the C/O ratio and the mass of O will have to await better\nconstraints on the C/O gas spatial distribution.\n", "  We report on the young massive clump (G35.20w) in W48 that previous molecular\nline and dust observations have revealed to be in the very early stages of star\nformation. Based on virial analysis, we find that a strong field of ~1640\nmicroG is required to keep the clump in pressure equilibrium. We performed a\ndeep Zeeman effect measurement of the 113 GHz CN (1-0) line towards this clump\nwith the IRAM 30 m telescope. We combine simultaneous fitting of all CN\nhyperfines with Monte Carlo simulations for a large range in realization of the\nmagnetic field to obtain a constraint on the line-of-sight field strength of\n-687 +/- 420 microG. We also analyze archival dust polarization observations\ntowards G35.20w. A strong magnetic field is implied by the remarkably ordered\nfield orientation that is perpendicular to the longest axis of the clump. Based\non this, we also estimate the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field to\nbe ~740 microG. This allows for a unique comparison of the two orthogonal\nmeasurements of magnetic field strength of the same region and at similar\nspatial scales. The expected total field strength shows no significant conflict\nbetween the observed field and that required for pressure equilibrium. By\nproducing a probability distribution for a large range in field geometries, we\nshow that plane-of-sky projections are much closer to the true field strengths\nthan line-of-sight projections. This can present a significant challenge for\nZeeman measurements of magnetized structures, even with ALMA. We also show that\nCN molecule does not suffer from depletion on the observed scales in the\npredominantly cold and highly deuterated core in an early stage of high-mass\nstar formation and is thus a good tracer of the dense gas.\n", "  We use two different methods, i.e., dipole-fitting (DF) and hemisphere\ncomparison (HC), to search for the anisotropic signals hiding in the Union2.1\ndata set. We find that the directions of maximum matter density derived using\nthese two methods are about $114^{\\circ}$ away from each other. We construct\nfour Union2.1-like mock samples to test the statistical significance of these\ntwo methods. It is shown that DF method is statistically significant, while HC\nmethod is strongly biased by the distribution of data points in the sky. Then\nwe assume that the anisotropy of distance modulus is mainly induced by the\nanisotropy of matter density, which is modeled to be the dipole form\n$\\Omega_M=\\Omega_{M0}(1-\\cos\\theta)$. We fit our model to Union2.1, and find\nthat the direction of maximum matter density is well consistent with the\ndirection derived using DF method, but it is very different from the direction\npreviously claimed. Monte Carlo simulations show that our method is\nstatistically more significant than HC method, although it is not as\nsignificant as DF method. The statistical significance can be further improved\nif the data points are homogeneously distributed in the sky. Due to the low\nquality of present supernovae data, however, it is still premature to claim\nthat the Universe has any preferred direction.\n", "  The measurement of stellar properties such as chemical compositions, masses\nand ages, through stellar spectra, is a fundamental problem in astrophysics.\nProgress in the understanding, calculation and measurement of atomic properties\nand processes relevant to the high-accuracy analysis of F-, G-, and K-type\nstellar spectra is reviewed, with particular emphasis on abundance analysis.\nThis includes fundamental atomic data such as energy levels, wavelengths, and\ntransition probabilities, as well as processes of photoionisation, collisional\nbroadening and inelastic collisions. A recurring theme throughout the review is\nthe interplay between theoretical atomic physics, laboratory measurements, and\nastrophysical modelling, all of which contribute to our understanding of atoms\nand atomic processes, as well as to modelling stellar spectra.\n", "  The widespread use of high energy particle beams in basic research, medicine\nand coherent X-ray generation coupled with the large size of modern radio\nfrequency (RF) accelerator devices and facilities has motivated a strong need\nfor alternative accelerators operating in regimes outside of RF. Working at\noptical frequencies, dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) - transparent\nlaser-driven nanoscale dielectric structures whose near fields can\nsynchronously accelerate charged particles - have demonstrated high-gradient\nacceleration with a variety of laser wavelengths, materials, and electron beam\nparameters, potentially enabling miniaturized accelerators and table-top\ncoherent x-ray sources. To realize a useful (i.e. scalable) DLA, crucial\ndevelopments have remained: concatenation of components including sustained\nphase synchronicity to reach arbitrary final energies as well as deflection and\nfocusing elements to keep the beam well collimated along the design axis. Here,\nall of these elements are demonstrated with a subrelativistic electron beam. In\nparticular, by creating two interaction regions via illumination of a\nnanograting with two spatio-temporally separated pulsed laser beams, we\ndemonstrate a phase-controlled doubling of electron energy gain from 0.7 to 1.4\nkeV (2.5 percent to 5 percent of the initial beam energy) and through use of a\nchirped grating geometry, we overcome the dephasing limit of 25 keV electrons,\nincreasing their energy gains to a laser power limited 10 percent of their\ninitial energy. Further, optically-driven transverse focusing of the electron\nbeam with focal lengths below 200 microns is achieved via a parabolic grating\ngeometry. These results lay the cornerstone for future miniaturized phase\nsynchronous vacuum-structure-based accelerators.\n", "  A fibrous herringbone-modified helicoidal architecture is identified within\nthe exocuticle of an impact-resistant crustacean appendage. This previously\nunreported composite microstructure, which features highly textured apatite\nmineral templated by an alpha-chitin matrix, provides enhanced stress\nredistribution and energy absorption over the traditional helicoidal design\nunder compressive loading. Nanoscale toughening mechanisms are also identified\nusing high load nanoindentation and in-situ TEM picoindentation.\n", "  The theories of flexoelectricity and that of nonlocal elasticity are closely\nrelated, and are often considered together when modeling strain-gradient\neffects in solids. Here I show, based on a first-principles lattice-dynamical\nanalysis, that their relationship is much more intimate than previously\nthought, and their consistent simultaneous treatment is crucial for obtaining\ncorrect physical answers. In particular, I identify a gauge invariance in the\ntheory, whereby the energies associated to strain-gradient elasticity and\nflexoelectrically induced electric fields are individually reference-dependent,\nand only when summed up they yield a well-defined result. To illustrate this, I\nconstruct a minimal thermodynamic functional incorporating strain-gradient\neffects, and establish a formal link between the continuum description and ab\ninitio phonon dispersion curves to calculate the relevant tensor quantities. As\na practical demonstration, I apply such a formalism to bulk SrTiO$_3$, where I\nfind an unusually strong contribution of nonlocal elasticity, mediated by the\ninteraction between the ferroelectric soft mode and the transverse acoustic\nbranches. These results have important implications towards the construction of\nwell-defined thermodynamic theories where flexoelectricity and ferroelectricity\ncoexist. More generally, they open exciting new avenues for the implementation\nof hierarchical multiscale concepts in the first-principles simulation of\ncrystalline insulators.\n", "  Molecular oxygen has been detected in the coma of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with abundances in the 1-10% range by the ROSINA-DFMS\ninstrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft. Here we find that the radiolysis of\nicy grains in low-density environments such as the presolar cloud may induce\nthe production of large amounts of molecular oxygen. We also show that\nmolecular oxygen can be efficiently trapped in clathrates formed in the\nprotosolar nebula, and that its incorporation as crystalline ice is highly\nimplausible because this would imply much larger abundances of Ar and N2 than\nthose observed in the coma. Assuming that radiolysis has been the only O2\nproduction mechanism at work, we conclude that the formation of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is possible in a dense and early protosolar nebula in\nthe framework of two extreme scenarios: (1) agglomeration from pristine\namorphous icy grains/particles formed in ISM and (2) agglomeration from\nclathrates that formed during the disk's cooling. The former scenario is found\nconsistent with the strong correlation between O2 and H2O observed in 67P/C-G's\ncoma while the latter scenario requires that clathrates formed from ISM icy\ngrains that crystallized when entering the protosolar nebula.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the angular momentum independence of the\nentropy sum and product for AdS rotating black holes based on the first law of\nthermodynamics and a mathematical lemma related to Vandermonde determinant. The\nadvantage of this method is that the explicit forms of the spacetime metric,\nblack hole mass and charge are not needed but the Hawking temperature and\nentropy formula on the horizons are necessary for static black holes, while our\ncalculations require the expressions of metric and angular velocity formula. We\nfind that the entropy sum is always independent of angular momentum for all\ndimensions and the angular momentum-independence of entropy product only holds\nfor the dimensions $d>4$ with at least one rotation parameter $a_i=0$, while\nthe mass-free of entropy sum and entropy product for rotating black holes only\nstand for higher dimensions ($d>4$) and for all dimensions, respectively. On\nthe other hand, we find that the introduction of a negative cosmological\nconstant does not affect the angular momentum-free of entropy sum and product\nbut the criterion for angular momentum-independence of entropy product will be\naffected.\n", "  We present a complete optoelectronic unit for polarization visualization,\nswitching and control. The system is based on an FPGA unit and comprises: an\nacquisition unit containing an analog polarimeter and digital-to-analog\nconverters, an FPGA capable of implementing an optimal algorithm for\nthree-stage arbitrary polarization tracking, and an electronic driver with\nanalog-to-digital converters capable of interfacing with Lithium-Niobate-based\nPolarization Controllers. The results, determined via simulation of\nreal-parameter devices, show that fast polarization switch is achievable.\n", "  In a recent paper by S. Moroz, C. Hoyos, and L. Radzihovsky [Phys. Rev. B 91,\n195409 (2015)], it is claimed that the conductivity at low frequency $\\omega$\nand small wavevector $q$ along the edge of a quantum Hall (QH) system (that\npossesses Galilean invariance along the edge) contains a universal contribution\nof order $q^2$ that is determined by the orbital spin per particle in the bulk\nof the system, or alternatively by the shift of the ground state. (These\nquantities are known to be related to the Hall viscosity of the bulk.) In this\nComment we calculate the real part of the conductivity, integrated over\n$\\omega$, in this regime for the edge of a system of non-interacting electrons\nfilling either the lowest, or the lowest $\\nu$ ($\\nu=1$, $2$, . . .), Landau\nlevel(s), and show that the $q^2$ term is non-universal and depends on details\nof the confining potential at the edge. In the special case of a linear\npotential, a form similar to the prediction is obtained, it is possible that\nthis corrected form of the prediction may also hold for fractional QH states in\nsystems with special forms of interactions between electrons.\n", "  We investigate whether varying the dust composition (described by the optical\nconstants) can solve a persistent problem in debris disk modeling--the\ninability to fit the thermal emission without over-predicting the scattered\nlight. We model five images of the beta Pictoris disk: two in scattered light\nfrom HST/STIS at 0.58 microns and HST/WFC3 at 1.16 microns, and three in\nthermal emission from Spitzer/MIPS at 24 microns, Herschel/PACS at 70 microns,\nand ALMA at 870 microns. The WFC3 and MIPS data are published here for the\nfirst time. We focus our modeling on the outer part of this disk, consisting of\na parent body ring and a halo of small grains. First, we confirm that a model\nusing astronomical silicates cannot simultaneously fit the thermal and\nscattered light data. Next, we use a simple, generic function for the optical\nconstants to show that varying the dust composition can improve the fit\nsubstantially. Finally, we model the dust as a mixture of the most plausible\ndebris constituents: astronomical silicates, water ice, organic refractory\nmaterial, and vacuum. We achieve a good fit to all datasets with grains\ncomposed predominantly of silicates and organics, while ice and vacuum are, at\nmost, present in small amounts. This composition is similar to one derived from\nprevious work on the HR 4796A disk. Our model also fits the thermal SED,\nscattered light colors, and high-resolution mid-IR data from T-ReCS for this\ndisk. Additionally, we show that sub-blowout grains are a necessary component\nof the halo.\n", "  Neutron star X-ray binaries emit a compact, optically thick, relativistic\nradio jet during low-luminosity, usually hard states, as Galactic black-hole\nX-ray binaries do. When radio emission is bright, a hard power-law tail without\nevidence for an exponential cutoff is observed in most systems. We have\ndeveloped a jet model that explains many spectral and timing properties of\nblack-hole binaries in the states where a jet is present. Our goal is to\ninvestigate whether our jet model can reproduce the hard tail, with the correct\nrange of photon index and the absence of a high-energy cutoff, in neutron-star\nX-ray binaries. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Compton\nupscattering of soft, accretion-disk or boundary layer photons, in the jet and\ncomputed the emergent energy spectra, as well as the time lag of hard photons\nwith respect to softer ones as a function of Fourier frequency. We demonstrate\nthat our jet model explains the observed power-law distribution with photon\nindex in the range 1.8-3. With an appropriate choice of the parameters, the\ncutoff expected from Comptonization is shifted to energies above ~300 keV,\nproducing a pure power law without any evidence for a rollover, in agreement\nwith the observations. Our results reinforce the idea that the link between the\noutflow (jet) and inflow (disk) in X-ray binaries does not depend on the nature\nof the compact object, but on the process of accretion. Furthermore, we address\nthe differences of jets in black-hole and neutron-star X-ray binaries and\npredict that the break frequency in the spectral energy distribution of\nneutron-star X-ray binaries, as a class, will be lower than that of black-hole\nbinaries.\n", "  We consider the di-photon signal arises from two bunches of collimated photon\njets emitting from a pair of highly boosted scalars. Following the discussion\nof detecting the photon jets at the collider, we extend the two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel (2HDM) by adding a gauge singlet scalar. To explain the di-photon excess\nwhich is recently observed at the first 13 TeV run of the LHC, the mixing\nbetween the heavy doublet state and the newly added singlet is crucially\nneeded. After the mixing, one can have a heavy Higgs state $Y_2$ at 750 GeV and\na very singlet-like scalar $Y_1$ of sub-GeV, which would be highly boosted\nthrough the $Y_2$ decay. Both real singlet and complex singlet extension are\nstudied. It turns out that only the complex model can yield the 1-10 fb cross\nsection in the di-photon final state in accompany with the decay length of the\norder of 1 m for the $Y_1$. This complex model parametrically predicts the\nwidth of 750 GeV resonance $\\gtrsim 1$ GeV. In addition, the pseudoscalar\ncomponent of the singlet in this model is naturally stable and hence could be a\ndark matter candidate.\n", "  Several studies have reported a correlation between the chemical abundances\nof stars and condensation temperature (known as Tc trend). Very recently, a\nstrong Tc trend was reported for the $\\zeta$ Reticuli binary system, which\nconsists of two solar analogs. The observed trend in $\\zeta^2$ Ret relative to\nits companion was explained by the presence of a debris disk around $\\zeta^2$\nRet. Our goal is to re-evaluate the presence and variability of the Tc trend in\nthe $\\zeta$ Reticuli system and to understand the impact of the presence of the\ndebris disk on a star. We used very high-quality spectra of the two stars\nretrieved from the HARPS archive to derive very precise stellar parameters and\nchemical abundances. We derived the stellar parameters with the classical\n(nondifferential) method, while we applied a differential line-by-line analysis\nto achieve the highest possible precision in abundances, which are fundamental\nto explore for very tiny differences in the abundances between the stars. We\nconfirm that the abundance difference between $\\zeta^2$ Ret and $\\zeta^1$ Ret\nshows a significant ($\\sim$ 2 $\\sigma$) correlation with Tc. However, we also\nfind that the Tc trends depend on the individual spectrum used (even if always\nof very high quality). In particular, we find significant but varying\ndifferences in the abundances of the same star from different individual\nhigh-quality spectra. Our results for the $\\zeta$ Reticuli system show, for\nexample, that nonphysical factors, such as the quality of spectra employed and\nerrors that are not accounted for, can be at the root of the Tc trends for the\ncase of individual spectra.\n", "  We have studied scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of\nthe four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-like black holes with a\n\\textit{tidal charge} in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld. The quasinormal modes\nof these scalar, electromagnetic, as well as axial and polar gravitational\nperturbations, have been studied in both normal and eikonal regimes.\nCalculations have shown that the black holes on the Randall-Sundrum brane are\nstable against scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations.\nMoreover, we determine the grey body factor, giving transmission and reflection\nof the scattered waves through the scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational\neffective potentials. It has been shown that the scalar perturbative fields are\nthe most favorite to the reflected as compared to the latter. With increasing\nvalue of the tidal charge ability of the all perturbative potentials to reflect\nthe waves decreases. Our calculations in low- and high-frequency regimes have\nshown that black holes on the braneworld always have a bigger absorption cross\nsection of massless scalar waves than the Schwarzschild and standard\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black holes.\n", "  The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are cool supergiants that display\nirregular and deep dips in their light curves, caused by dust formation. There\nare four known hot RCB stars (DY Cen, MV Sgr, V348 Sgr, and HV 2671), with\nsurface temperatures of 15,000--25,000 K, and prior work has suggested that\nthree of these have secular fading in brightness. I have tested this result by\nmeasuring century-long light curves in the Johnson B-band with modern\ncomparison star magnitudes, and I have extended this by measuring many\nmagnitudes over a wide time range as well as for the fourth hot RCB star. In\nall four cases, the B-band magnitude of the maximum light is now fast fading.\nThe fading rates (in units of magnitudes per century) are 2.5 for DY Cen after\n1960, 1.3 for MV Sgr, 1.3 for V348 Sgr, and 0.7 for HV 2671. This secular\nfading is caused by the expected evolution of the star across the top of the HR\ndiagram at constant luminosity, as the temperature rises and the bolometric\ncorrection changes. For DY Cen, the brightness at maximum light is rising from\n1906 to 1932, and this is caused by the temperature increase from near 5,800 to\n7,500 K. Before 1934 DY Cen had frequent dust dips, while after 1934 there are\nzero dust dips, so there is some apparent connection between the rising\ntemperature and the formation of the dust. Thus, we have watched DY Cen evolve\nfrom an ordinary RCB star up to a hot RCB star and now appearing as an extreme\nhelium star, all in under one century.\n", "  The solar dynamo problem is the question of how the cyclic variation in the\nsolar magnetic field is maintained. One of the important processes is the\ntransport of magnetic flux by surface convection. To reveal this process, the\ndependence of the squared displacement of magnetic flux concentrations upon the\nelapsed time is investigated in this paper via a feature-recognition technique\nand a continual five-day magnetogram. This represents the longest time scale\nover which a satellite observation has ever been performed for this problem.\nThe dependence is found to follow a power-law and differ significantly from\nthat of diffusion transport. Furthermore there is a change in the behavior at a\nspatial scale of 10^{3.8} km. A super-diffusion behavior with an index of 1.4\nis found on smaller scales, while changing to a sub-diffusion behavior with an\nindex of 0.6 on larger ones. I interpret this difference in the transport\nregime as coming from the network-flow pattern.\n", "  Low- and intermediate-mass stars eject much of their mass during the late,\nred giant branch (RGB) phase of evolution. The physics of their strong stellar\nwinds is still poorly understood. In the standard model, stellar pulsations\nextend the atmosphere, allowing a wind to be driven through radiation pressure\non condensing dust particles. Here we investigate the onset of the wind, using\nnearby RGB stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalogue. We find a sharp onset of\ndust production when the star first reaches a pulsation period of 60 days. This\napproximately co-incides with the point where the star transitions to the first\novertone pulsation mode. Models of the spectral energy distributions show\nstellar mass-loss rate suddenly increases at this point, by a factor of ~10\nover the existing (chromospherically driven) wind. The dust emission is\nstrongly correlated with both pulsation period and amplitude, indicating\nstellar pulsation is the main trigger for the strong mass loss, and determines\nthe mass-loss rate. Dust emission does not strongly correlate with stellar\nluminosity, indicating radiation pressure on dust has little effect on the\nmass-loss rate. RGB stars do not normally appear to produce dust, whereas dust\nproduction by asymptotic giant branch stars appears commonplace, and is\nprobably ubiquitous above the RGB-tip luminosity. We conclude that the strong\nwind begins with a step change in mass-loss rate, and is triggered by stellar\npulsations. A second rapid mass-loss-rate enhancement is suggested when the\nstar transitions to the fundamental pulsation mode, at a period of ~300 days.\n", "  The representation of clouds and associated processes of rain and snow\nformation remains one of the major uncertainties in climate and weather\nprediction models. In a companion paper (Part I), we systematically derived a\ntwo moment bulk cloud microphysics model for collision and coalescence in warm\nrain based on the kinetic coalescence equation (KCE) and used stochastic\napproximations to close the higher order moment terms, and do so independently\nof the collision kernel. Conservation of mass and consistency of droplet number\nconcentration of the evolving cloud properties were combined with numerical\nsimulations to reduce the parametrization problem to three key parameters.\n  Here, we constrain these three parameters based on the physics of collision\nand coalescence resulting in a \"region of validity.\" Furthermore, we\ntheoretically validate the new bulk model by deriving a subset of the \"region\nof validity\" that contains stochastic parameters that skillfully reproduces an\nexisting model based on an a priori droplet size distribution by Seifert and\nBeheng (2001). The stochastic bulk model is empirically validated against this\nmodel, and parameter values that faithfully reproduce detailed KCE results are\nidentified.\n  Furthermore, sensitivity tests indicate that the stochastically derived model\ncan be used with a time step as large as 30 seconds without significantly\ncompromising accuracy, which makes it very attractive to use in medium to long\nrange weather prediction models. These results can be explored in the future to\nselect parameters in the \"region of validity\" that are conditional on\nenvironmental conditions and the age of the cloud.\n", "  Dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functionals were recently shown to yield\naccurate energy gaps and dielectric constants for a wide variety of solids, at\na computational cost considerably less than that of GW calculations. The\nfraction of exact exchange included in the definition of DDH functionals\ndepends (self-consistently) on the dielectric constant of the material. Here we\nintroduce a range-separated (RS) version of DDH functionals where short and\nlong-range components are matched using system dependent, non-empirical\nparameters. We show that RS DDHs yield accurate electronic properties of\ninorganic and organic solids, including energy gaps and absolute ionization\npotentials. Furthermore we show that these functionals may be generalized to\nfinite systems.\n", "  A relation between the mass accretion rate onto the central young star and\nthe mass of the surrounding protoplanetary disk has long been theoretically\npredicted and observationally sought. For the first time, we have accurately\nand homogeneously determined the photospheric parameters, mass accretion rate,\nand disk mass for an essentially complete sample of young stars with disks in\nthe Lupus clouds. Our work combines the results of surveys conducted with\nVLT/X-Shooter and ALMA. With this dataset we are able to test a basic\nprediction of viscous accretion theory, the existence of a linear relation\nbetween the mass accretion rate onto the central star and the total disk mass.\nWe find a correlation between the mass accretion rate and the disk dust mass,\nwith a ratio that is roughly consistent with the expected viscous timescale\nwhen assuming an interstellar medium (ISM) gas-to-dust ratio. This confirms\nthat mass accretion rates are related to the properties of the outer disk. We\nfind no correlation between mass accretion rates and the disk mass measured by\nCO isotopologues emission lines, possibly owing to the small number of measured\ndisk gas masses. This suggests that the mm-sized dust mass better traces the\ntotal disk mass and that masses derived from CO may be underestimated, at least\nin some cases.\n", "  4U 1705-44 is one of the most-studied type I X-ray burster and Atoll sources.\nThis source represents a perfect candidate to test different models proposed to\nself-consistently track the physical changes occurring between different\nspectral states because it shows clear spectral state transitions. The\nbroadband coverage, the sensitivity and energy resolution of the BeppoSAX\nsatellite offers the opportunity to disentangle the components that form the\ntotal X-ray spectrum and to study their changes according to the spectral\nstate. Using two BeppoSAX observations carried out in August and October 2000,\nrespectively, for a total effective exposure time of about 100 ks, we study the\nspectral evolution of the source from a soft to hard state. Energy spectra are\nselected according to the source position in the color-color diagram (CCD)\nResults. We succeeded in modeling the spectra of the source using a physical\nself-consistent scenario for both the island and banana branches (the double\nComptonization scenario). The components observed are the soft Comptonization\nand hard Comptonization, the blackbody, and a reflection component with a broad\niron line. When the source moves from the banana state to the island state, the\nparameters of the two Comptonization components change significantly and the\nblackbody component becomes too weak to be detected. We interpret the soft\nComptonization component as emission from the hot plasma surrounding the\nneutron star, hard Comptonization as emission from the disk region, and the\nblackbody component as emission from the inner accretion disk. The broad\nfeature in the iron line region is compatible with reflection from the inner\naccretion disk.\n", "  AX J1845-0258 is a transient X-ray pulsar, with spin period of 6.97s,\ndiscovered with the ASCA satellite in 1993. Its soft spectrum and the possible\nassociation with a supernova remnant suggest that AX J1845-0258 might be a\nmagnetar, but this has not been confirmed yet. A possible counterpart one order\nof magnitude fainter, AX J184453-025640, has been found in later X-ray\nobservations, but no pulsations have been detected. In addition, some other\nX-ray sources are compatible with the pulsar location, which is in a crowded\nregion of the Galactic plane. We have carried out a new investigation of all\nthe X-ray sources in the ASCA error region of AX J1845-0258, using archival\ndata obtained with Chandra in 2007 and 2010, and with XMM-Newton in 2010. We\nset an upper limit of 6% on the pulsed fraction of AX J184453-025640 and\nconfirmed its rather hard spectrum (power law photon index of 1.2 +\\- 0.3). In\naddition to the other two fainter sources already reported in the literature,\nwe found other X-ray sources positionally consistent with AX J1845-0258.\nAlthough many of them are possibly foreground stars likely unrelated to the\npulsar, at least another new source, CXOU J184457.5-025823, could be a\nplausible counterpart of AX J1845-0258. It has a flux of 6x10^{-14} erg cm^{-2}\ns^{-1} and a spectrum well fit by a power law with photon index ~1.3 and Nh ~\n10^{22} cm^{-2}.\n", "  In this paper, we reveal a general relationship between model simplification\nand irreversibility based on the model of continuous-time Markov chains with\ntime-scale separation. According to the topological structure of the fast\nprocess, we divide the states of the chain into the transient states and the\nrecurrent states. We show that a two-time-scale chain can be simplified to a\nreduced chain in two different ways: removal of the transient states and\naggregation of the recurrent states. Both the two operations will lead to a\ndecrease in the entropy production rate and its adiabatic part and will keep\nits non-adiabatic part the same. This suggests that although model\nsimplification can retain almost all the dynamic information of the chain, it\nwill lose some thermodynamic information as a trade-off.\n", "  Understanding how the complex intermolecular- and nano-structure present in\norganic semiconductor donor-acceptor blends impacts charge carrier motion,\ninteractions, and recombination behavior is a critical fundamental issue with a\nparticularly major impact on organic photovoltaic applications. In this study,\nkinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are used to numerically quantify the\ncomplex bimolecular charge carrier recombination behavior in idealized\nphase-separated blends. Recent KMC simulations have identified how the\nencounter-limited bimolecular recombination rate in these blends deviates from\nthe often used Langevin model and have been used to construct the new power\nmean mobility model. Here, we make a challenging but crucial expansion to this\nwork by determining the charge carrier concentration dependence of the\nencounter-limited bimolecular recombination coefficient. In doing so, we find\nthat an accurate treatment of the long-range electrostatic interactions between\ncharge carriers is critical, and we further argue that many previous KMC\nsimulation studies have used a Coulomb cutoff radius that is too small, which\ncauses a significant overestimation of the recombination rate. To shed more\nlight on this issue, we determine the minimum cutoff radius required to reach\nan accuracy of less than $\\pm10\\%$ as a function of the domain size and the\ncharge carrier concentration and then use this knowledge to accurately quantify\nthe charge carrier concentration dependence of the recombination rate. Using\nthese rigorous methods, we finally show that the parameters of the power mean\nmobility model are determined by a newly identified dimensionless ratio of the\ndomain size to the average charge carrier separation distance.\n", "  Aims: We aim at investigating the time-behaviour of a sample of gamma-ray\nblazars. We present the results from a 13 month-long optical photometry\nmonitoring campaign of the blazars PKS 0048-097, PKS 0754+100, HB89 0827+243,\nPKS 0851+202, PKS 1253-055, PKS1510-089, PKS 1749+096, PKS 2230+114 and PKS\n2251+158. Methods: We analyse the variability of each object, focusing on\ndifferent time-scales (long term, short term, and microvariability), in an\nattempt to achieve a statistical comparison of the results. Results: After\napplying a geometric model to explain the variability results, we found that it\nis possible that a slight change in the direction of the jet generates the\nvariations detected in some objects during this campaign.\n", "  The paradigm of extracting work from isolated quantum system through a cyclic\nHamiltonian process is a topic of immense research interest. The optimal work\nextracted under such process is termed as ergotropy [Europhys. Lett., 67 (4),\n565(2004)]. Here, in a multi-party scenario we consider only a class of such\ncyclic processes that can be implemented locally, giving rise to the concept of\nlocal ergotropy. Eventually, presence of quantum correlations result in a\nnon-vanishing thermodynamic quantity called ergotropic gap, measured by the\ndifference between the global and local ergotropy. However the converse does\nnot hold in general, i.e. its nonzero value does not necessarily imply presence\nof quantum correlations. For arbitrary multi-party states we quantify this gap.\nWe also evaluate the difference between maximum global and local extractable\nwork for arbitrary states when the system is no longer isolated but put in\ncontact with a baths of same local temperature.\n", "  Images of dust continuum and carbon monoxide (CO) line emission are powerful\ntools for deducing structural characteristics of galaxies, such as disk sizes,\nH$_2$ gas velocity fields and enclosed H$_2$ and dynamical masses. We report on\na fundamental constraint set by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on the\nobserved structural and dynamical characteristics of galaxies, as deduced from\ndust continuum and CO-line imaging at high redshifts. As the CMB temperature\nrises in the distant Universe, the ensuing thermal equilibrium between the CMB\nand the cold dust and H$_2$ gas progressively erases all spatial and spectral\ncontrasts between their brightness distributions and the CMB. For high-redshift\ngalaxies, this strongly biases the recoverable H$_2$ gas and dust mass\ndistributions, scale lengths, gas velocity fields and dynamical mass estimates.\nThis limitation is unique to mm/submm wavelengths and unlike its known effect\non the global dust continuum and molecular line emission of galaxies, it cannot\nbe addressed simply. We nevertheless identify a unique signature of\nCMB-affected continuum brightness distributions, namely an increasing rather\nthan diminishing contrast between such brightness distributions and the CMB\nwhen the cold dust in distant galaxies is imaged at frequencies beyond the\nRaleigh-Jeans limit. For the molecular gas tracers, the same effect makes the\natomic carbon (CI) lines maintain a larger contrast than the CO lines against\nthe CMB.\n", "  Haumea is a dwarf planet with two known satellites, an unusually high spin\nrate, and a large collisional family, making it one of the most interesting\nobjects in the outer solar system. A fully self-consistent formation scenario\nresponsible for the satellite and family formation is still elusive, but some\nprocesses predict the initial formation of many small moons, similar to the\nsmall moons recently discovered around Pluto. Deep searches for regular\nsatellites around KBOs are difficult due to observational limitations, but\nHaumea is one of the few for which sufficient data exist. We analyze Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) observations, focusing on a ten-consecutive-orbit\nsequence obtained in July 2010, to search for new very small satellites. To\nmaximize the search depth, we implement and validate a non-linear\nshift-and-stack method. No additional satellites of Haumea are found, but by\nimplanting and recovering artificial sources, we characterize our sensitivity.\nAt distances between $\\sim$10,000 km and $\\sim$350,000 km from Haumea,\nsatellites with radii as small as $\\sim$10 km are ruled out, assuming an albedo\n($p \\simeq 0.7$) similar to Haumea. We also rule out satellites larger than\n$\\gtrsim$40 km in most of the Hill sphere using other HST data. This search\nmethod rules out objects similar in size to the small moons of Pluto. By\ndeveloping clear criteria for determining the number of non-linear rates to\nuse, we find that far fewer shift rates are required ($\\sim$35) than might be\nexpected. The non-linear shift-and-stack method to discover satellites (and\nother moving transients) is tractable, particularly in the regime where\nnon-linear motion begins to manifest itself.\n", "  Geometrical frustration in magnetic materials often gives rise to exotic,\nlow-temperature states of matter, like the ones observed in spin ices. Here we\nreport the imaging of the magnetic states of a thermally-active artificial\nmagnetic ice that reveal the fingerprints of a spin fragmentation process. This\nfragmentation corresponds to a splitting of the magnetic degree of freedom into\ntwo channels and is evidenced in both real and reciprocal space. Furthermore,\nthe internal organization of both channels is interpreted within the framework\nof a hybrid spin-charge model that directly emerges from the parent spin model\nof the kagome dipolar spin ice. Our experimental and theoretical results\nprovide insights into the physics of frustrated magnets and deepen our\nunderstanding of emergent fields through the use of tailor-made magnetism.\n", "  The electronic transport through Au-(Cu$_{2}$O)$_n$-Au junctions is\ninvestigated using first-principles calculations and the nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction method. The effect of varying the thickness (i.e., $n$) is studied as\nwell as that of point defects and anion substitution. For all Cu$_{2}$O\nthicknesses the conductance is more enhanced by bulk-like (in contrast to\nnear-interface) defects, with the exception of O vacancies and Cl\nsubstitutional defects. A similar transmission behavior results from Cu\ndeficiency and N substitution, as well as from Cl substitution and N\ninterstitials for thick Cu$_{2}$O junctions. In agreement with recent\nexperimental observations, it is found that N and Cl doping enhances the\nconductance. A Frenkel defect, i.e., a superposition of an O interstitial and O\nsubstitutional defect, leads to a remarkably high conductance. From the\nanalysis of the defect formation energies, Cu vacancies are found to be\nparticularly stable, in agreement with earlier experimental and theoretical\nwork.\n", "  We study cosmological tensor perturbations on a quantized background within\nthe hybrid quantization approach. In particular, we consider a flat,\nhomogeneous and isotropic spacetime and small tensor inhomogeneities on it. We\ntruncate the action to second order in the perturbations. The dynamics is ruled\nby a homogeneous scalar constraint. We carry out a canonical transformation in\nthe system where the Hamiltonian for the tensor perturbations takes a canonical\nform. The new tensor modes now admit a standard Fock quantization with a\nunitary dynamics. We then combine this representation with a generic quantum\nscheme for the homogeneous sector. We adopt a Born-Oppenheimer ansatz for the\nsolutions to the constraint operator, previously employed to study the dynamics\nof scalar inhomogeneities. We analyze the approximations that allow us to\nrecover, on the one hand, a Schr\\\"odinger equation similar to the one emerging\nin the dressed metric approach and, on the other hand, the ones necessary for\nthe effective evolution equations of these primordial tensor modes within the\nhybrid approach to be valid. Finally, we consider loop quantum cosmology as an\nexample where these quantization techniques can be applied and compare with\nother approaches.\n", "  In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. E 90, 022506 (2014)], we had studied\nthermodynamic and structural properties of a three-dimensional simple-cubic\nlattice model with dipolar-like interaction, truncated at nearest-neighbor\nseparation, for which the existence of an ordering transition at finite\ntemperature had been proven mathematically; here we extend our investigation\naddressing the full-ranged counterpart of the model, for which the critical\nbehavior had been investigated theoretically and experimentally. In addition\nthe existence of an ordering transition at finite temperature had been proven\nmathematically as well. Both models exhibited the same continuously degenerate\nground-state configuration, possessing full orientational order with respect to\na suitably defined staggered magnetization (polarization), but no nematic\nsecond-rank order; in both cases, thermal fluctuations remove the degeneracy,\nso that nematic order does set in at low but finite temperature via a mechanism\nof order by disorder. On the other hand, there were recognizable quantitative\ndifferences between the two models as for ground-state energy and critical\nexponent estimates; the latter were found to agree with early Renormalization\nGroup calculations and with experimental results.\n", "  Compared with two-level quantum key distribution (QKD), highdimensional QKD\nenable two distant parties to share a secret key at a higher rate. We provide a\nfinite-key security analysis for the recently proposed practical\nhighdimensional decoy-state QKD protocol based on time-energy entanglement. We\nemploy two methods to estimate the statistical fluctuation of the postselection\nprobability and give a tighter bound on the secure-key capacity. By numerical\nevaluation, we show the finite-key effect on the secure-key capacity in\ndifferent conditions. Moreover, our approach could be used to optimize\nparameters in practical implementations of highdimensional QKD.\n", "  We introduce a practical digital holographic method capable of imaging\nthrough a diffusive or scattering medium. The method relies on statistical\naveraging from a rotating ground glass diffuser to negate the adverse effects\ncaused by speckle introduced by a first, static diffuser or scattering medium.\nIn particular, a setup based on Fourier transform holography is used to show\nthat an image can be recovered after scattering by introducing an additional\ndiffuser in the optical setup. This method is capable of recovering object\ninformation from behind a scattering layer in biomedical or military imaging\napplications.\n", "  By performing a high-statistics simulation of the $D=4$ random-field Ising\nmodel at zero temperature for different shapes of the random-field\ndistribution, we show that the model is ruled by a single universality class.\nWe compute to a high accuracy the complete set of critical exponents for this\nclass, including the correction-to-scaling exponent. Our results indicate that\nin four dimensions: (i) dimensional reduction as predicted by the perturbative\nrenormalization group does not hold and (ii) three independent critical\nexponents are needed to described the transition.\n", "  We report exploratory \\chandra\\ observation of the ultraluminous quasar SDSS\nJ010013.02+280225.8 at redshift 6.30. The quasar is clearly detected by\n\\chandra\\ with a possible component of extended emission. The rest-frame 2-10\nkeV luminosity is 9.0$^{+9.1}_{-4.5}$ $\\times$ 10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with\ninferred photon index of $\\Gamma$ = 3.03$^{+0.78}_{-0.70}$. This quasar is\nX-ray bright, with inferred X-ray-to-optical flux ratio \\aox\\\n$=-1.22^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, higher than the values found in other quasars of\ncomparable ultraviolet luminosity. The properties inferred from this\nexploratory observation indicate that this ultraluminous quasar might be\ngrowing with super-Eddington accretion and probably viewed with small\ninclination angle. Deep X-ray observation will help to probe the plausible\nextended emission and better constraint the spectral features for this\nultraluminous quasar.\n", "  Radial velocity and transit surveys have found that the fraction of FGKM\nstars with close-in super-Earth(s) ($\\eta_\\oplus$) is around $30 \\%- 50\\%$,\nindependent of the stellar mass $M_\\ast$ and metallicity $Z_\\ast$. In contrast,\nthe fraction of solar-type stars harboring one or more gas giants ($\\eta_J $)\nwith masses $M_{\\rm p} > 100 \\ M_\\oplus $ is nearly $ 10\\%-15\\%$, and it\nappears to increase with both $M_\\ast$ and $Z_\\ast$. Regardless of the\nproperties of their host stars, the total mass of some multiple super-Earth\nsystems exceeds the core mass of Jupiter and Saturn. We suggest that both\nsuper-Earths and supercritical cores of gas giants were assembled from a\npopulation of embryos that underwent convergent type I migration from their\nbirthplaces to a transition location between viscously heated and irradiation\nheated disk regions. We attribute the cause for the $\\eta_\\oplus$-$\\eta_{\\rm\nJ}$ dichotomy to conditions required for embryos to merge and to acquire\nsupercritical core mass ($M_c \\sim 10 \\ M_\\oplus$) for the onset of efficient\ngaseous envelope accretion. We translate this condition into a critical disk\naccretion rate, and our analysis and simulation results show that it weakly\ndepends on $M_\\ast$ and decreases with metallicity of disk gas $Z_{\\rm d}$. We\nfind that embryos are more likely to merge into supercritical cores around\nrelatively massive and metal-rich stars. This dependence accounts for the\nobserved $\\eta_{\\rm J}$-$M_\\ast$. We also consider the $Z_{\\rm d}$-$Z_\\ast$\ndispersed relationship and reproduce the observed $\\eta_J$-$Z_\\ast$\ncorrelation.\n", "  We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-infrared photometry of the\ncoldest known brown dwarf, WISE J085510.83$-$071442.5 (WISE 0855$-$0714). WISE\n0855$-$0714 was observed with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard HST using\nthe F105W, F125W, and F160W filters, which approximate the $Y$, $J$, and $H$\nnear-infrared bands. WISE 0855$-$0714 is undetected at F105W with a\ncorresponding 2$\\sigma$ magnitude limit of $\\sim$26.9. We marginally detect\nWISE 0855$-$0714 in the F125W images (S/N $\\sim$4), with a measured magnitude\nof 26.41 $\\pm$ 0.27, more than a magnitude fainter than the $J-$band magnitude\nreported by Faherty and coworkers. WISE J0855$-$0714 is clearly detected in the\nF160W band, with a magnitude of 23.90 $\\pm$ 0.02, the first secure detection of\nWISE 0855$-$0714 in the near-infrared. Based on these data, we find that WISE\n0855$-$0714 has extremely red F105W$-$F125W and F125W$-$F160W colors relative\nto other known Y dwarfs. We find that when compared to the models of Saumon et\nal. and Morley et al., the F105W$-$F125W and F125W$-$F160W colors of WISE\n0855$-$0714 cannot be accounted for simultaneously. These colors likely\nindicate that we are seeing the collapse of flux on the Wien tail for this\nextremely cold object.\n", "  Defect-assisted recombination is an important limitation on efficiency of\noptoelectronic devices. However, since nonradiative capture rates decrease\nexponentially with energy of the transition, the mechanisms by which such\nrecombination can take place in wide-band-gap materials are unclear. Using\nelectronic structure calculations we uncover the crucial role of electronic\nexcited states in nonradiative recombination processes. The impact is\nelucidated with examples for the group-III nitrides, for which accumulating\nexperimental evidence indicates that defect-assisted recombination limits\nefficiency. Our work provides new insights into the physics of nonradiative\nrecombination, and the mechanisms are suggested to be ubiquitous in\nwide-band-gap semiconductors.\n", "  Near the critical temperature of a superconducting transition, the energy of\nthe threshold perturbation $\\delta F_{thr}$ that transfers a superconducting\nbridge to a resistive state at a current below the critical current $I_c$ has\nbeen determined. It has been shown that $\\delta F_{thr}$ increases with a\ndecrease in the length of a bridge for short bridges with lengths $L<\\xi$\n(where $\\xi$ is the coherence length) and is saturated for long bridges with\n$L\\gg \\xi$. At certain geometrical parameters of banks and bridge, the function\n$\\delta F_{thr}(L)$ at the current $I\\to 0$ has a minimum at $L\\sim 2-3 \\xi$.\nThese results indicate that the effect of fluctuations on Josephson junctions\nmade in the form of short superconducting bridges is reduced and that the\neffect of fluctuations on bridges with lengths $\\sim 2-3 \\xi$ is enhanced.\n", "  On the night of Oct 31, 2015 two bright Southern Taurid fireballs occurred\nover Poland, being one of the most spectacular bolides of this shower in recent\nyears. The first fireball - PF311015a Okonek - was detected by six video\nstations of Polish Fireball Network (PFN) and photographed by several\nbystanders, allowing for precise determination of the trajectory and orbit of\nthe event. The PF311015a Okonek entered Earth's atmosphere with the velocity of\n33.2 +\\- 0.1 km/s and started to shine at height of 117.88 +\\- 0.05 km. The\nmaximum brightness of -16.0 +\\- 0.4 mag was reached at height of 82.5 +\\- 0.1\nkm. The trajectory of the fireball ended at height of 60.2 +\\- 0.2 km with\nterminal velocity of 30.2 +\\- 1.0 km/s.\n  The second fireball - PF311015b Ostrowite - was detected by six video\nstations of PFN. It started with velocity of 33.2 +\\- 0.1 km/s at height of\n108.05 +\\- 0.02 km. The peak brightness of -14.8 +\\- 0.5 mag was recorded at\nheight of 82.2 +\\- 0.1 km. The terminal velocity was 31.8 +\\- 0.5 km/s and was\nobserved at height of 57.86 +\\- 0.03 km.\n  The orbits of both fireballs are similar not only to orbits of Southern\nTaurids and comet 2P/Encke, but even closer resemblance was noticed for orbits\nof 2005 UR and 2005 TF50 asteroids. Especially the former object is interesting\nbecause of its close flyby during spectacular Taurid maximum in 2005. We\ncarried out a further search to investigate the possible genetic relationship\nof Okonek and Ostrowite fireballs with both asteroids, that are considered to\nbe associated with Taurid complex. Although, we could not have confirmed\nunequivocally the relation between fireballs and these objects, we showed that\nboth asteroids could be associated, having the same origin in a disruption\nprocess that separates them.\n", "  We demonstrate the phenomenon of blockade in two-photon excitations to the\nRydberg state in thermal vapor. A technique based on optical heterodyne is used\nto measure the dispersion of a probe beam far off resonant to the D2 line of\nrubidium in the presence of a strong laser beam that couples to the Rydberg\nstate via two-photon resonance. Density dependent suppression of the dispersion\npeak is observed while coupling to the Rydberg state with principal quantum\nnumber, n = 60. The experimental observation is explained using the phenomenon\nof Rydberg blockade. The blockade radius is measured to be about 2.2 {\\mu}m\nwhich is consistent with the scaling due to the Doppler width of 2-photon\nresonance in thermal vapor. Our result promises the realization of single\nphoton source and strong single photon non-linearity based on Rydberg blockade\nin thermal vapor.\n", "  We demonstrate a compact and robust method for generating a 399-nm light\nresonant on the $^{1}S_{0}-^{1}P_{1}$ transition in ytterbium using a\nsingle-pass periodically poled LiNbO$_{3}$ waveguide for second harmonic\ngeneration (SHG). The obtained output power at 399 nm was 25 mW when a 798-nm\nfundamental power of 380 mW was coupled to the waveguide. We observed no\ndegradation of the SHG power for 13 hours with a low power of 6 mW. The\nobtained SHG light has been used as a seed light for injection locking, which\nprovides sufficient power for laser cooling ytterbium.\n", "  We report a laser noise reduction method by locking it to an actively\nstabilized fiber-based Mach Zehnder interferometer with 10 km optical fiber to\nachieve large arm imbalance. An acousto optic modulator is used for\ninterferometer stabilization and heterodyne detection. The out-of-loop\nfrequency noise is reduced by more than 90 dB for Fourier frequency at 1 Hz.\nThis structure presents an efficient laser noise reduction method both at high\nFourier frequency and low Fourier frequency. The signal of stabilized laser is\ntransferred via a 10 km fiber link with a fractional frequency stability of\n1.12 times 10-16 at 1 s. Compared with the fractional frequency stability of\nthat when the interferometer is not stabilized, more than one order of\nmagnitude is improved.\n", "  During the 2014-2015 campaign of mutual events, we recorded ground-based\nphotometric observations of eclipses of Amalthea (JV) and, for the first time,\nThebe (JXIV) by the Galilean moons. We focused on estimating whether the\npositioning accuracy of the inner satellites determined with photometry is\nsufficient for dynamical studies. We observed two eclipses of Amalthea and one\nof Thebe with the 1 m telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory using an IR filter\nand a mask placed over the planetary image to avoid blooming features. A third\nobservation of Amalthea was taken at Saint-Sulpice Observatory with a 60 cm\ntelescope using a methane filter (890 nm) and a deep absorption band to\ndecrease the contrast between the planet and the satellites. After background\nremoval, we computed a differential aperture photometry to obtain the light\nflux, and followed with an astrometric reduction. We provide astrometric\nresults with an external precision of 53 mas for the eclipse of Thebe, and 20\nmas for that of Amalthea. These observation accuracies largely override\nstandard astrometric measurements. The (O-C)s for the eclipse of Thebe are 75\nmas on the X-axis and 120 mas on the Y-axis. The (O-C)s for the total eclipses\nof Amalthea are 95 mas and 22 mas, along the orbit, for two of the three\nevents. Taking into account the ratio of (O-C) to precision of the astrometric\nresults, we show a significant discrepancy with the theory established by\nAvdyushev and Ban'shikova in 2008, and the JPL JUP 310 ephemeris.\n", "  The paper is a brief overview of the works by Iosif S. Shklovsky\n(1916--1985), carried out over almost 30 years (1955--1985), on the nature of\nactivity (primarily in the radio frequency range) in nuclei of some galaxies.\n  Worthy of note is Shklovsky's pioneering work of 1962, in which he made an\nattempt to consider possible evolutionary tracks of extragalactic radio sources\nby constructing an analog of the Herzsprung--Russel diagram for stars (radio\nluminosity at 160 MHz was taken instead of optical luminosity; total radio size\nat the same frequency, as the other parameter). Later works by other authors\nare also discussed, where similar diagrams were plotted using a larger\nobservational material.\n  Special attention is paid to the evolution of Shklovsky's views regarding the\npossible ways of gas getting into radio galaxies' central regions, followed by\nhigh-velocity ejections of magnetized plasmons from their nuclei. In his\nassumptions, Shklovsky was mainly based on the observational data for the\nproperties of the closest radio galaxy, NGC 4486 (Virgo A, M87), which he\nbelieved to be the same reference standard for extragalactic radio astronomy as\nthe Crab Nebula for galactic radio astronomy.\n  Shklovsky's approach to the recurrence of the activity phenomenon in galactic\nnuclei and the one-sided character of radio ejections from them is discussed.\n  Modern views on these issues are also briefly considered.\n", "  We study boson shells and boson stars in a theory of complex scalar field\ncoupled to the $U(1)$ gauge field $A_{\\mu}$ and Einstein gravity with the\npotential: $V(|\\Phi|) := \\frac{1}{2} m^{2} \\left(|\\Phi|+ a \\right)^2$. This\ncould be considered either as a theory of massive complex scalar field coupled\nto electromagnetic field and gravity in a conical potential or as a theory in\nthe presence of a potential which is an overlap of a parabolic and a conical\npotential. Our theory has a positive cosmological constant $(\\Lambda := 4 \\pi G\nm^2 a^2)$. Boson stars are found to come in two types, having either ball-like\nor shell-like charge density. We have studied the properties of these solutions\nand have also determined their domains of existence for some specific values of\nthe parameters of the theory. Similar solutions have also been obtained by\nKleihaus, Kunz, Laemmerzahl and List, in a V-shaped scalar potential.\n", "  The recent discovery of three Earth-sized, potentially habitable planets\naround a nearby cool star, TRAPPIST-1, has provided three key targets for the\nupcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Depending on their atmospheric\ncharacteristics and precise orbit configurations, it is possible that any of\nthe three planets may be in the liquid water habitable zone, meaning that they\nmay be capable of supporting life. We find that present-day Earth levels of\nozone, if present, would be detectable if JWST observes 60 transits for\ninnermost planet 1b and 30 transits for 1c and 1d.\n", "  Aims. We aim to understand the high cyclic-to-linear $\\rm C_3H_2$ ratio ($32\n\\pm 4$) observed toward L1544 by Spezzano et al. (2016). Methods. We combine a\ngas-grain chemical model with a physical model for L1544 to simulate the column\ndensities of cyclic and linear $\\rm C_3H_2$ observed toward L1544. The most\nimportant reactions for the formation and destruction of both forms of $\\rm\nC_3H_2$ are identified, and their relative rate coefficients are varied to find\nthe best match to the observations. Results. We find that the ratio of the rate\ncoefficients of $\\rm C_3H_3^+ + e^- \\longrightarrow C_3H_2 + H$ for cyclic and\nlinear $\\rm C_3H_2$ must be $\\sim 20$ in order to reproduce the observations,\ndepending on the branching ratios assumed for the $\\rm C_3H_3^+ + e^-\n\\longrightarrow C_3H + H_2$ reaction. In current astrochemical networks it is\nassumed that cyclic and linear $\\rm C_3H_2$ are formed in a 1:1 ratio in the\naforementioned reactions. Laboratory studies and/or theoretical calculations\nare needed to confirm the results of our chemical modeling based on\nobservational constraints.\n", "  We study the effect of superfluidity on torsional oscillations of highly\nmagnetised neutron stars (magnetars) with a microphysical equation of state by\nmeans of two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamical- elastic simulations. The\nsuperfluid properties of the neutrons in the neutron star core are treated in a\nparametric way in which we effectively decouple part of the core matter from\nthe oscillations. Our simulations confirm the existence of two groups of\noscillations, namely continuum oscillations that are confined to the neutron\nstar core and are of Alfv\\'enic character, and global oscillations with\nconstant phase and that are of mixed magneto-elastic type. The latter might\nexplain the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetar giant flares,\nsince they do not suffer from the additional damping mechanism due to phase\nmixing, contrary to what happens for continuum oscillations. However, we cannot\nprove rigorously that the coherent oscillations with constant phase are normal\nmodes. Moreover, we find no crustal shear modes for the magnetic field\nstrengths typical for magnetars.We provide fits to our numerical simulations\nthat give the oscillation frequencies as functions of magnetic field strength\nand proton fraction in the core.\n", "  Average stellar orbits of the Galactic disk may have some small intrinsic\nellipticity which breaks the exact axisymmetry and there may also be some\nmigration of stars inwards or outwards. Both phenomena can be detected through\nkinematic analyses. We use the red clump stars selected spectroscopically from\nAPOGEE (APO Galactic Evolution Experiment), with known distances and radial\nvelocities, to measure the radial component of the Galactocentric velocities\nwithin 5 kpc$<R<$16 kpc, $|b|<5^\\circ$ and within 20 degrees from the\nSun-Galactic center line. The average Galactocentric radial velocity is\n$V_R=(1.48\\pm 0.35)[R({\\rm kpc})-(8.8\\pm 2.7)]$ km/s outwards in the explored\nrange, with a higher contribution from stars below the Galactic plane. Two\npossible explanations can be given for this result: i) the mean orbit of the\ndisk stars is intrinsically elliptical with a Galactocentric radial gradient of\neccentricity around 0.01 kpc$^{-1}$; or ii) there is a net secular expansion of\nthe disk, in which stars within $R\\approx 9-11$ kpc are migrating to the region\n$R\\gtrsim 11$ kpc at the rate of $\\sim 2$ M$_\\odot $/yr, and stars with\n$R\\lesssim 9$ kpc are falling toward the center of the Galaxy. This migration\nratio would be unattainable for a long time and it should decelerate, otherwise\nthe Galaxy would fade away in around 1 Gyr. At present, both hypotheses are\nspeculative and one would need data on the Galactocentric radial velocities for\nother azimuths different to the center or anticenter in order to confirm one of\nthe scenarios.\n", "  Magnetar giant flares show oscillatory modulations in the tails of their\nlight curves, which can only be explained via some form of beaming. The\nfireball model for magnetar bursts has been used successfully to fit the\nphase-averaged light curves of the tails of giant flares, but so far no\nattempts have been made to fit the pulsations. We present a relatively simple\nnumerical model to simulate beaming of magnetar flare emission. In our\nsimulations, radiation escapes from the base of a fireball trapped in a dipolar\nmagnetic field, and is scattered through the optically thick magnetosphere of\nthe magnetar until it escapes. Beaming is provided by the presence of a\nrelativistic outflow, as well as by the geometry of the system. We find that a\nsimple picture for the relativistic outflow is enough to create the pulse\nfraction and sharp peaks observed in pulse profiles of magnetar flares, while\nwithout a relativistic outflow the beaming is insufficient to explain giant\nflare rotational modulations.\n", "  We used models of thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, that\nalso describe the dust-formation process in the wind, to interpret the\ncombination of near- and mid-infrared photometric data of the dwarf galaxy IC\n1613. This is the first time that this approach is extended to an environment\ndifferent from the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Our analysis,\nbased on synthetic population techniques, shows a nice agreement between the\nobservations and the expected distribution of stars in the colour-magnitude\ndiagrams obtained with JHK and Spitzer bands. This allows a characterization of\nthe individual stars in the AGB sample in terms of mass, chemical composition,\nand formation epoch of the progenitors. We identify the stars exhibiting the\nlargest degree of obscuration as carbon stars evolving through the final AGB\nphases, descending from 1-1.25Msun objects of metallicity Z=0.001 and from\n1.5-2.5Msun stars with Z=0.002. Oxygen-rich stars constitute the majority of\nthe sample (65%), mainly low mass stars (<2Msun) that produce a negligible\namount of dust (<10^{-7}Msun/yr). We predict the overall dust-production rate\nfrom IC 1613, mostly determined by carbon stars, to be 6x10^{-7}Msun/yr with an\nuncertainty of 30%. The capability of the current generation of models to\ninterpret the AGB population in an environment different from the MCs opens the\npossibility to extend this kind of analysis to other Local Group galaxies.\n", "  We describe the design, construction and commissioning of LOTUS; a simple,\nlow-cost long-slit spectrograph for the Liverpool Telescope. The design is\noptimized for near-UV and visible wavelengths and uses all transmitting optics.\nIt exploits the instrument focal plane field curvature to partially correct\naxial chromatic aberration. A stepped slit provides narrow (2.5x95 arcsec) and\nwide (5x25 arcsec) options that are optimized for spectral resolution and flux\ncalibration respectively. On sky testing shows a wavelength range of 3200-6300\nAngstroms with a peak system throughput (including detector quantum efficiency)\nof 15 per cent and wavelength dependant spectral resolution of R=225-430. By\nrepeated observations of the symbiotic emission line star AG Peg we demonstrate\nthe wavelength stability of the system is less than 2 Angstroms rms and is\nlimited by the positioning of the object in the slit. The spectrograph is now\nin routine operation monitoring the activity of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\nduring its current post-perihelion apparition.\n", "  We present a new analysis of X-ray spectra of the archetypal ultraluminous\nX-ray source (ULX) Holmberg IX X-1 obtained by the Swift, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR\nobservatories. This ULX is a persistent source, with a typical luminosity of\n~10^40 erg s^-1, that varied by a factor of 4 - 5 over eight years. We find\nthat its spectra tend to evolve from relatively flat or two-component spectra\nin the medium energy band (1-6 keV), at lower luminosities, to a spectrum that\nis distinctly curved and disc-like at the highest luminosities, with the peak\nenergy in the curved spectrum tending to decrease with increased luminosity. We\nargue that the spectral evolution of the ULX can be explained by\nsuper-Eddington accretion models, where in this case we view the ULX down the\nevacuated funnel along its rotation axis, bounded by its massive radiatively\ndriven wind. The spectral changes then originate in enhanced geometric beaming\nas the accretion rate increases and wind funnel narrows, causing the scattered\nflux from the central regions of the supercritical flow to brighten faster than\nthe isotropic thermal emission from the wind, and so the curved hard spectral\ncomponent to dominate at the highest luminosities. The wind also Compton\ndown-scatters photons at the edge of the funnel, resulting in the peak energy\nof the spectrum decreasing. We also confirm that Holmberg IX X-1 displays\nspectral degeneracy with luminosity, and suggest that the observed differences\nare naturally explained by precession of the black hole rotation axis for the\nsuggested wind geometry.\n", "  We discuss the ringdown behavior of the nonequilibrium Green's function in a\nstrongly coupled theory with the holographic dual with a focus on\nquasinormal-mode equilibration. We study the time resolved spectral function\nfor a probe scalar in Vaidya-AdS spacetime in detail as a complement to the\npreceding work arXiv:1603.06935 using further numerical results in very\nnonadiabatic temperature changes. It is shown that the relaxation of the\nnonequilibrium spectral function obtained through the Wigner transform is\ngoverned by the lowest quasinormal mode frequency. The timescale of the\nbackground temperature change is also observed in the frequency analysis. We\nthen consider a toy model motivated by the quasinormal mode behavior and\ndiscuss these main features in numerical results are simply realized.\n", "  In classes on cosmology, students are often told that photons stretch as\nspace expands, but just how physical is this picture? Does space really expand?\nIn this article, we explore the notion of the redshift of light with Einstein's\ngeneral theory of relativity, showing that the core underpinning principles\nreveal that redshifts are both simpler and more complex than you might naively\nthink. This has significant implications for the observed redshifting of\nphotons as they travel across the universe, often refereed to as the\ncosmological redshift, and for the idea of expanding space.\n", "  The motion of a neutral atom endowed with a magnetic moment interacting with\nthe magnetic field is determined from the Ehrenfest-like equations of motion.\nThese equations for the average values of the translational and spin degrees of\nfreedom are derived from the Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli wave equation and they form a\nset of nine coupled nonlinear evolution equations. The numerical and analytic\nsolutions of these equations are obtained for the combination of the rotating\nmagnetic field of a wave carrying orbital angular momentum and a static\nmagnetic field. The running wave traps the atom only in the transverse\ndirection while the standing wave traps the atom also in the direction of the\nbeam.\n", "  To understand the behaviour of complex systems it is often necessary to use\nmodels that describe the dynamics of subnetworks. It has previously been\nestablished using projection methods that such subnetwork dynamics generically\ninvolves memory of the past, and that the memory functions can be calculated\nexplicitly for biochemical reaction networks made up of unary and binary\nreactions. However, many established network models involve also\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics, to describe e.g. enzymatic reactions. We show that\nthe projection approach to subnetwork dynamics can be extended to such\nnetworks, thus significantly broadening its range of applicability. To derive\nthe extension we construct a larger network that represents enzymes and enzyme\ncomplexes explicitly, obtain the projected equations, and finally take the\nlimit of fast enzyme reactions that gives back Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The\ncrucial point is that this limit can be taken in closed form. The outcome is a\nsimple procedure that allows one to obtain a description of subnetwork\ndynamics, including memory functions, starting directly from any given network\nof unary, binary and Michaelis-Menten reactions. Numerical tests show that this\nclosed form enzyme elimination gives a much more accurate description of the\nsubnetwork dynamics than the simpler method that represents enzymes explicitly,\nand is also more efficient computationally.\n", "  This work is to study the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics in\ntachyon cosmology where the boundary of the universe is assumed to be enclosed\nby a dynamical apparent horizon. The model is constrained with the\nobservational data. The two logarithmic and power law corrected entropy is also\ndiscussed and conditions to validate the GSL and corrected entropies are\nobtained.\n", "  This paper is aimed at investigating a 5D holographic dark energy in\nDGP-BRANE cosmology by employing a combination of Sne Ia, BAO and CMB\nobservational data to fit the cosmological parameters in the model. We describe\nthe dynamic of a FRW for the normal branch ($\\epsilon$ = +1) of solutions of\nthe induced gravity brane-world model. We take the matter in 5D bulk as\nholographic dark energy that its holographic nature is reproduced effectively\nin 4D. The cosmic evolution reveals that the effective 4D holographic dark\nenergy behaves as quintessence while taking into account the 4D cold dark\nmatter results in matter dominated universe followed by late time acceleration.\n", "  We present 154 MHz Murchison Widefield Array imaging observations and\nvariability information for a sample of pulsars. Over the declination range\n$-80^{\\circ} < {\\delta} < 10^{\\circ}$ we detect 17 known pulsars with mean flux\ndensity greater than 0.3 Jy. We explore the variability properties of this\nsample on timescales of minutes to years. For three of these pulsars, PSR\nJ0953+0755, PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J0630-2834 we observe interstellar\nscintillation and variability on timescales of greater than 2 minutes. One\nfurther pulsar, PSR J0034-0721, showed significant variability, the physical\norigins of which are difficult to determine. The dynamic spectra for PSR\nJ0953+0755 and PSR J0437-4715 show discrete time and frequency structure\nconsistent with diffractive interstellar scintillation and we present the\nscintillation bandwidth and timescales from these observations. The remaining\npulsars within our sample were statistically non-variable. We also explore the\nspectral properties of this sample and find spectral curvature in pulsars PSR\nJ0835-4510, PSR J1752-2806 and PSR J0437-4715.\n", "  The Wolf-Rayet 98a (WR 98a) system is a prime target for interferometric\nsurveys, since its identification as a \"rotating pinwheel nebulae\", where\ninfrared images display a spiral dust lane revolving with a 1.4 year\nperiodicity. WR 98a hosts a WC9+OB star, and the presence of dust is puzzling\ngiven the extreme luminosities of Wolf-Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic\nmodels for WR 98a, where dust creation and redistribution are self-consistently\nincorporated. Our grid-adaptive simulations resolve details in the wind\ncollision region at scales below one percent of the orbital separation (~4 AU),\nwhile simulating up to 1300 AU. We cover several orbital periods under\nconditions where the gas component alone behaves adiabatic, or is subject to\neffective radiative cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between stellar\nwinds is effective in a well-defined spiral pattern, where optimal conditions\nfor dust creation are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the\ninteraction gets dominated by thermal instabilities along the wind collision\nregion, and dust concentrates in clumps and filaments in a volume-filling\nfashion, so WR 98a must obey close to adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the\nrotating pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future E-ELT observations\nand confront photometric long-term monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the\ndust distribution between leading and trailing edge of the spiral, show that\nALMA and E-ELT would be able to detect fine-structure in the spiral indicative\nof Kelvin-Helmholtz development, and confirm the variation in photometry due to\nthe orientation. Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their resolution is\ninsufficient to detect the details we predict.\n", "  According to the nova model from \\citet{Yaron2005} and \\citet{Jose1998} and\nusing Monte Carlo simulation method, we investigate the contribution of\nchemical abundances in nova ejecta to the interstellar medium (ISM) of the\nGalaxy. We find that the ejected mass by classical novae (CNe) is about\n$2.7\\times10^{-3}$ $ \\rm M_\\odot\\ {\\rm yr^{-1}}$. In the nova ejecta, the\nisotopic ratios of C, N and O, that is, $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C, $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N\nand $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O, are higher about one order of magnitude than those in\nred giants. We estimate that about 10$\\%$, 5$\\%$ and 20$\\%$ of $^{13}$C,\n$^{15}$N and $^{17}$O in the ISM of the Galaxy come from nova ejecta,\nrespectively. However, the chemical abundances of C, N and O calculated by our\nmodel can not cover all of observational values. This means that there is still\na long way to go for understanding novae.\n", "  We design an effect protocol for protecting the single-photon entanglement\nfrom photon loss and decoherence. The protocol only requires some auxiliary\nsingle photons and the linear optical elements. By operating the protocol, the\nphoton loss can be effectively decreased and the less entangled single photon\nstate can be recovered to the maximally entangled state with some probability.\nMoreover, the polarization information encoded in the single photon state can\nbe perfectly contained. The protocol can be realized under current experimental\ncondition. As the single photon entanglement is quite important in quantum\ncommunication, this protocol may be useful in current and future quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  We present results from multifrequency radiative hydrodynamical chemistry\nsimulations addressing primordial star formation and related stellar feedback\nfrom various populations of stars, stellar energy distributions (SEDs) and\ninitial mass functions. Spectra for massive stars, intermediate-mass stars and\nregular solar-like stars are adopted over a grid of 150 frequency bins and\nconsistently coupled with hydrodynamics, heavy-element pollution and\nnon-equilibrium species calculations. Powerful massive population III stars are\nfound to be able to largely ionize H and, subsequently, He and He$^+$, causing\nan inversion of the equation of state and a boost of the Jeans masses in the\nearly intergalactic medium. Radiative effects on star formation rates are\nbetween a factor of a few and 1 dex, depending on the SED. Radiative processes\nare responsible for gas heating and photoevaporation, although emission from\nsoft SEDs has minor impacts. These findings have implications for cosmic gas\npreheating, primordial direct-collapse black holes, the build-up of \"cosmic\nfossils\" such as low-mass dwarf galaxies, the role of AGNi during reionization,\nthe early formation of extended disks and angular-momentum catastrophe.\n", "  Our current understanding of galaxy evolution still has many uncertainties\nassociated with the details of accretion, processing, and removal of gas across\ncosmic time. The next generation of radio telescopes will image the neutral\nhydrogen (HI) in galaxies over large volumes at high redshifts, which will\nprovide key insights into these processes. We are conducting the COSMOS HI\nLarge Extragalactic Survey (CHILES) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array,\nwhich is the first survey to simultaneously observe HI from z=0 to z~0.5. Here,\nwe report the highest redshift HI 21-cm detection in emission to date of the\nluminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) COSMOS J100054.83+023126.2 at z=0.376 with the\nfirst 178 hours of CHILES data. The total HI mass is\n$(2.9\\pm1.0)\\times10^{10}~M_\\odot$, and the spatial distribution is asymmetric\nand extends beyond the galaxy. While optically the galaxy looks undisturbed,\nthe HI distribution suggests an interaction with candidate a candidate\ncompanion. In addition, we present follow-up Large Millimeter Telescope CO\nobservations that show it is rich in molecular hydrogen, with a range of\npossible masses of $(1.8-9.9)\\times10^{10}~M_\\odot$. This is the first study of\nthe HI and CO in emission for a single galaxy beyond z~0.2.\n", "  Two XMM Newton observations of Nova V4743 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2002) were performed\nshortly after it returned to quiescence, 2 and 3.5 years after the explosion.\nThe X-ray light curves revealed a modulation with a frequency of ~0.75 mHz,\nindicating that V4743 Sgr is most probably an intermediate polar (IP). The\nX-ray spectra have characteristics in common with known IPs, with a hard\nthermal plasma component that can be fitted only assuming a partially covering\nabsorber. In 2004 the X-ray spectrum had also a supersoft blackbody-like\ncomponent, whose temperature was close to that of the white dwarf (WD) in the\nsupersoft X-ray phase following the outburst, but with flux by at least two\norders of magnitude lower. In quiescent IPs, a soft X-ray flux component\noriginates at times in the polar regions irradiated by an accretion column, but\nthe supersoft component of V4743 Sgr disappeared in 2006, indicating a possible\norigin different from accretion. We suggest that it may have been due to an\natmospheric temperature gradient on the WD surface, or to continuing localized\nthermonuclear burning at the bottom of the envelope, before complete turn-off.\nAn optical spectrum obtained with SALT 11.5 years after the outburst showed a\nprominent He II 4686A line and the Bowen blend, which reveal a very hot region,\nbut with peak temperature shifted to the ultraviolet (UV) range. V4743 Sgr is\nthe third post-outburst nova and IP candidate showing a low-luminosity\nsupersoft component in the X-ray flux a few years after the outburst.\n", "  We describe the kinematics, dynamics and also some energetic issues related\nto the Marta mouse motion when she walks on top of a horizontal bicycle wheel,\nwhich is free to rotate like a merry-to-go round, as presented recently by Paul\nHewitt in the Figuring Physics section of this magazine.\n", "  Here we show that under quantum reconnection, simulated by using the\nthree-dimensional Gross- Pitaevskii equation, self-helicity of a system of two\ninteracting vortex rings remains conserved. By resolving the fine structure of\nthe vortex cores, we demonstrate that total length of the vortex system reaches\na maximum at the reconnection time, while both writhe helicity and twist\nhelicity remain separately unchanged throughout the process. Self-helicity is\ncomputed by two independent methods, and topological information is based on\nthe extraction and analysis of geometric quantities such as writhe, total\ntorsion and intrinsic twist of the reconnecting vortex rings.\n", "  Heat and charge transport characteristics of nanocolloids have been bridged\nfrom fundamental analysis. The relationship between the two transport phenomena\nin dielectric nanostructure based polar colloids has been quantitatively\npresented. An extensional intuitive analogy to the Wiedemann Franz law has been\ndrawn. Derived from the fact that mobile electrons transport both heat and\ncharge within metallic crystal structure, the analogy can be extended to\nnanocolloids, wherein the dispersed population act as the major transporter.\nThe analogy allows modeling the relationship between the two phenomena and\nsheds more insight and conclusive evidence that nanoparticle traversal within\nthe fluid domain is the main source of augmented transport phenomena exhibit by\nnanocolloids. Important factors such as the thermal and dielectric responses of\nthe nanocolloid can be quantified and bridged through the semi analytical\nformalism. The theoretical analysis has been validated against experimental\ndata and variant scientific literature and good accuracy has been observed.\n", "  The well-known superradiant amplification mechanism allows a charged scalar\nfield of proper mass $\\mu$ and electric charge $q$ to extract the Coulomb\nenergy of a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. The rate of energy\nextraction can grow exponentially in time if the system is placed inside a\nreflecting cavity which prevents the charged scalar field from escaping to\ninfinity. This composed black-hole-charged-scalar-field-mirror system is known\nas the {\\it charged black-hole bomb}. Previous numerical studies of this\ncomposed physical system have shown that, in the linearized regime, the\ninequality $q/\\mu>1$ provides a necessary condition for the development of the\nsuperradiant instability. In the present paper we use analytical techniques to\nstudy the instability properties of the charged black-hole bomb in the regime\nof linearized scalar fields. In particular, we prove that the lower bound\n${{q}\\over{\\mu}}>\\sqrt{{{r_{\\text{m}}/r_--1}\\over{r_{\\text{m}}/r_+-1}}}$\nprovides a necessary condition for the development of the superradiant\ninstability in this composed physical system (here $r_{\\pm}$ are the horizon\nradii of the charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole and $r_{\\text{m}}$ is the\nradius of the confining mirror). This {\\it analytically} derived lower bound on\nthe superradiant instability regime of the composed\nblack-hole-charged-scalar-field-mirror system is shown to agree with direct\n{\\it numerical} computations of the instability spectrum.\n", "  With the unique possibilities for controlling light in nanoscale devices,\ngraphene plasmonics has opened new perspectives to the nanophotonics community\nwith potential applications in metamaterials, modulators, photodetectors, and\nsensors. This paper briefly reviews the recent exciting progress in graphene\nplasmonics. We begin with a general description for optical properties of\ngraphene, particularly focusing on the dispersion of graphene-plasmon\npolaritons. The dispersion relation of graphene-plasmon polaritons of spatially\nextended graphene is expressed in terms of the local response limit with\nintraband contribution. With this theoretical foundation of graphene-plasmon\npolaritons, we then discuss recent exciting progress, paying specific attention\nto the following topics: excitation of graphene plasmon polaritons,\nelectron-phonon interactions in graphene on polar substrates, and tunable\ngraphene plasmonics with applications in modulators and sensors. Finally, we\nseek to address some of the apparent challenges and promising perspectives of\ngraphene plasmonics.\n", "  The high-spin rotational properties of two-quasiparticle bands in the\ndoubly-odd ${}^{166}$Ta are analyzed using the cranked shell model with pairing\ncorrelations treated by a particle-number conserving method, in which the\nblocking effects are taken into account exactly. The experimental moments of\ninertia and alignments and their variations with the rotational frequency\n$\\hbar\\omega$ are reproduced very well by the particle-number conserving\ncalculations, which provides a reliable support to the configuration\nassignments in previous works for these bands. The backbendings in these\ntwo-quasiparticle bands are analyzed by the calculated occupation probabilities\nand the contributions of each orbital to the total angular momentum alignments.\nThe moments of inertia and alignments for the Gallagher-Moszkowski partners of\nthese observed two-quasiparticle rotational bands are also predicted.\n", "  We present a long-term programme for timing the eclipses of white dwarfs in\nclose binaries to measure apparent and/or real variations in their orbital\nperiods. Our programme includes 67 close binaries, both detached and\nsemi-detached and with M-dwarfs, K-dwarfs, brown dwarfs or white dwarfs\nsecondaries. In total, we have observed more than 650 white dwarf eclipses. We\nuse this sample to search for orbital period variations and aim to identify the\nunderlying cause of these variations. We find that the probability of observing\norbital period variations increases significantly with the observational\nbaseline. In particular, all binaries with baselines exceeding 10 yrs, with\nsecondaries of spectral type K2 -- M5.5, show variations in the eclipse arrival\ntimes that in most cases amount to several minutes. In addition, among those\nwith baselines shorter than 10 yrs, binaries with late spectral type (>M6),\nbrown dwarf or white dwarf secondaries appear to show no orbital period\nvariations. This is in agreement with the so-called Applegate mechanism, which\nproposes that magnetic cycles in the secondary stars can drive variability in\nthe binary orbits. We also present new eclipse times of NN Ser, which are still\ncompatible with the previously published circumbinary planetary system model,\nalthough only with the addition of a quadratic term to the ephemeris. Finally,\nwe conclude that we are limited by the relatively short observational baseline\nfor many of the binaries in the eclipse timing programme, and therefore cannot\nyet draw robust conclusions about the cause of orbital period variations in\nevolved, white dwarf binaries.\n", "  A proposal to study the original and new agegraphic dark energy in DGP\nbraneworld cosmology is presented in this work. To verify our model with the\nobservational data, the model is constrained by a variety of independent\nmeasurements such as Hubble parameter, cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies, and baryon acoustic oscillation peaks. The best fitting procedure\nshows the effectiveness of agegraphic parameter $n$ in distinguishing between\nthe original and new agegraphic dark energy scenarios and subsequent\ncosmological findings. In particular, the result shows that in both scenarios,\nour universe enters an agegraphic dark energy dominated phase.\n", "  The long term scaling prospects for solid-state quantum computing\narchitectures relies heavily on the ability to simply and reliably measure and\ncontrol the coherent electron interaction strength, known as the tunnel\ncoupling, $t_c$. Here, we describe a method to extract the $t_c$ between two\nquantum dots (QDs) utilising their different tunnel rates to a reservoir. We\ndemonstrate the technique on a few donor triple QD tunnel coupled to a nearby\nsingle-electron transistor (SET) in silicon. The device was patterned using\nscanning tunneling microscopy-hydrogen lithography allowing for a direct\nmeasurement of the tunnel coupling for a given inter-dot distance. We extract\n${t}_{{\\rm{c}}}=5.5\\pm 1.8\\;{\\rm{GHz}}$ and ${t}_{{\\rm{c}}}=2.2\\pm\n1.3\\;{\\rm{GHz}}$ between each of the nearest-neighbour QDs which are separated\nby 14.5 nm and 14.0 nm, respectively. The technique allows for an accurate\nmeasurement of $t_c$ for nanoscale devices even when it is smaller than the\nelectron temperature and is an ideal characterisation tool for multi-dot\nsystems with a charge sensor.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of the time dependent parallel heat transport\nequation modeling heat pulses driven by power modulation in 3-dimensional\nchaotic magnetic fields are presented. The numerical method is based on the\nFourier formulation of a Lagrangian-Green's function method that provides an\naccurate and efficient technique for the solution of the parallel heat\ntransport equation in the presence of harmonic power modulation. The numerical\nresults presented provide conclusive evidence that even in the absence of\nmagnetic flux surfaces, chaotic magnetic field configurations with intermediate\nlevels of stochasticity exhibit transport barriers to modulated heat pulse\npropagation. In particular, high-order islands and remnants of destroyed flux\nsurfaces (Cantori) act as partial barriers that slow down or even stop the\npropagation of heat waves at places where the magnetic field connection length\nexhibits a strong gradient. Results on modulated heat pulse propagation in\nfully stochastic fields and across magnetic islands are also presented. In\nqualitative agreement with recent experiments in LHD and DIII-D, it is shown\nthat the elliptic (O) and hyperbolic (X) points of magnetic islands have a\ndirect impact on the spatio-temporal dependence of the amplitude of modulated\nheat pulses.\n", "  This paper develops a principle of similarity for the design of a nonlinear\nabsorber, the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber (NLTVA), attached to a\nnonlinear primary system. Specifically, for effective vibration mitigation, we\nshow that the NLTVA should feature a nonlinearity possessing the same\nmathematical form as that of the primary system. A compact analytical formula\nfor the nonlinear coefficient of the absorber is then derived. The formula,\nvalid for any polynomial nonlinearity in the primary system, is found to depend\nonly on the mass ratio and on the nonlinear coefficient of the primary system.\nWhen the primary system comprises several polynomial nonlinearities, we\ndemonstrate that the NLTVA obeys a principle of additivity, i.e., each\nnonlinear coefficient can be calculated independently of the other nonlinear\ncoefficients using the proposed formula.\n", "  Control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical networks, e.g., collective\nbehavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a\ncentral problem in many scientific and engineering fields. For the linear\nversion of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an\nimportant role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable\nby a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the\ncontrollability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs\ndistribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental\nnoise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated\nwith randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This\nfact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract\neffectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In\naddition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between\ncontrollability and statistical mechanics.\n", "  It is shown the principal possibility of bypassing damaged demyelinated\nportions of the nervous tissue, thereby restoring its normal function for the\npassage of action potentials.\n", "  Object kinetic Monte Carlo was employed to study the effect of dose rate on\nthe evolution of vacancy microstructure in polycrystalline tungsten under\nneutron bombardment. The evolution was followed up to 1.0 displacement per atom\n(dpa) with point defects generated in accordance with a primary knock-on atom\n(PKA) spectrum corresponding to 14-MeV neutrons. The present study includes the\neffect of grain size (2.0 and 4.0 $\\mu$m) but excludes the impact of\ntransmutation or pre-existing defects beyond grain boundary sinks. Vacancy\ncluster density increases with dose rate, while the density of vacancies\ndecreases. Consequently, the average vacancy cluster size and the fraction of\nvacancies in visible clusters decrease with increasing dose rate. The density\nof vacancies and vacancy clusters decrease with grain size such that the\naverage size of the clusters remains similar. However, the average size is\nlarger for larger grains at dose rates < 4.5 x 10-7 dpa/s. The trend of vacancy\naccumulation as a function of dose, dose rate, and grain size is similar to\nthat obtained with the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) PKA spectrum. However,\nthe amount of vacancy accumulation and the vacancy microstructure are quite\ndifferent. Compared to the HFIR case, we find that even though the dose rates\nare 2.5 times higher, the density of vacancies and the average vacancy cluster\nsizes are lower. In addition, a void lattice forms only for the lowest two dose\nrates (4.5 x 10-8 and 4.5 x 10-9 dpa/s). In contrast, a void lattice formed at\nall dose rates studied using the HFIR PKA spectrum. We discuss in detail the\nfactors that lead to these different microstructures.\n", "  In this paper we outline the range of probes and scientific instruments that\nwill be required in order for Icarus to fulfill its scientific mission of\nexploring a nearby star, its attendant planetary system, and the intervening\ninterstellar medium. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimate that the\nminimum total Icarus scientific payload mass (i.e. the mass of probes and\ninstruments which must be decelerated to rest in the target system to enable a\nmeaningful programme of scientific investigation) will be in the region of 100\ntonnes. Of this, approximately 10 tonnes would be allocated for cruise-phase\nscience instruments, and about 35 tonnes (i.e. the average of estimated lower\nand upper limits of 28 and 41 tonnes) would be contributed by the intra-system\nscience payload itself (i.e. the dry mass of the stellar and planetary probes\nand their instruments). The remaining ~55 tonnes is allocated for the sub-probe\nintra-system propulsion requirements (crudely estimated from current Solar\nSystem missions; detailed modelling of sub-probe propulsion systems will be\nneeded to refine this figure). The overall mass contributed by the science\npayload to the total that must be decelerated from the interstellar cruise\nvelocity will be considerably more than 100 tonnes, however, as allowance must\nbe made for the payload structural and infrastructural elements required to\nsupport, deploy, and communicate with the science probes and instruments. Based\non the earlier Daedalus study, we estimate another factor of two to allow for\nthese components. Pending the outcome of more detailed studies, it therefore\nappears that an overall science-related payload mass of ~200 tonnes will be\nrequired. This paper is a submission of the Project Icarus Study Group.\n", "  The B-spline R-matrix and the convergent close-coupling methods are used to\nstudy electron collisions with neutral beryllium over an energy range from\nthreshold to 100 eV. Coupling to the target continuum significantly affects the\nresults for transitions from the ground state, but to a lesser extent the\nstrong transitions between excited states. Cross sections are presented for\nselected transitions between low-lying physical bound states of beryllium, as\nwell as for elastic scattering, momentum transfer, and ionization. The present\ncross sections for transitions from the ground state from the two methods are\nin excellent agreement with each other, and also with other available results\nbased on nonperturbative convergent pseudo-state and time-dependent\nclose-coupling models. The elastic cross section at low energies is dominated\nby a prominent shape resonance. The ionization from the $(2s2p)^3P$ and\n$(2s2p)^1P$ states strongly depends on the respective term. The current\npredictions represent an extensive set of electron scattering data for neutral\nberyllium, which should be sufficient for most modeling applications.\n", "  The group of automorphisms of the first Weyl algebra acts on commuting\nordinary differential operators with polynomial coefficient. In this paper we\nprove that for fixed generic spectral curve of genus two the set of orbits is\ninfinite.\n", "  The dissipation mechanism that powers gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains\nuncertain almost half a century after their discovery. The two main competing\nmechanisms are the extensively studied internal shocks and the less studied\nmagnetic reconnection. Here we consider GRB emission from magnetic reconnection\naccounting for the relativistic bulk motions that it produces in the jet's bulk\nrest frame. Far from the source the magnetic field is almost exactly normal to\nthe radial direction, suggesting locally quasi-spherical thin reconnection\nlayers between regions of oppositely directed magnetic field. We show that if\nthe relativistic motions in the jet's frame are confined to such a\nquasi-spherical uniform layer, then the resulting GRB lightcurves are\nindependent of their direction distribution within this layer. This renders\nprevious results for a delta-function velocity-direction distribution\n(Beniamini & Granot 2016) applicable to a much more general class of\nreconnection models, which are suggested by numerical simulations. Such models\nthat vary in their velocity-direction distribution differ mainly in the size of\nthe bright region that contributes most of the observed flux at a given\nemission radius or observed time. The more sharply peaked this distribution,\nthe smaller this bright region, and the stronger the lightcurve variability\nthat may be induced by deviations from a uniform emission over the thin\nreconnection layer, which may be expected in a realistic GRB outflow. This is\nreflected both in the observed image at a given observed time and in the\nobserver-frame emissivity map at a given emission radius, which are calculated\nhere for three simple velocity-direction distributions.\n", "  The propensity of short DNA sequences to convert to the circular form is\nstudied by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian method which incorporates both the bending\nof the molecule axis and the intrinsic twist of the DNA strands. The base pair\nfluctuations with respect to the helix diameter are treated as path\ntrajectories in the imaginary time path integral formalism. The partition\nfunction for the sub-ensemble of closed molecules is computed by imposing chain\nends boundary conditions both on the radial fluctuations and on the angular\ndegrees of freedom. The cyclization probability, the J-factor, proves to be\nhighly sensitive to the stacking potential, mostly to its nonlinear parameters.\nWe find that the J-factor generally decreases by reducing the sequence length (\nN ) and, more significantly, below N = 100 base pairs. However, even for very\nsmall molecules, the J-factors remain sizeable in line with recent experimental\nindications. Large bending angles between adjacent base pairs and anharmonic\nstacking appear as the causes of the helix flexibility at short length scales.\n", "  We present a state-space-based path integral method to calculate the rate of\nelectron transfer (ET) in multi-state, multi-electron condensed-phase\nprocesses. We employ an exact path integral in discrete electronic states and\ncontinuous Cartesian nuclear variables to obtain a transition state theory\n(TST) estimate to the rate. A dynamic recrossing correction to the TST rate is\nthen obtained from real-time dynamics simulations using mean field ring polymer\nmolecular dynamics. We employ two different reaction coordinates in our\nsimulations and show that, despite the use of mean field dynamics, the use of\nan accurate dividing surface to compute TST rates allows us to achieve\nremarkable agreement with Fermi's golden rule rates for nonadiabatic ET in the\nnormal regime of Marcus theory. Further, we show that using a reaction\ncoordinate based on electronic state populations allows us to capture the\nturnover in rates for ET in the Marcus inverted regime.\n", "  Iterated games provide a framework to describe social interactions among\ngroups of individuals. Recent work stimulated by the discovery of\n\"zero-determinant\" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such\ninteractions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players\nface a simple binary choice, to \"cooperate\" or \"defect\". Real individuals,\nhowever, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social\ninteraction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access\nto a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social\ndynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some\ntwo-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible\nmulti-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We\nalso show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more \"rugged \"\nfitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple\nlevels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on\ninvestments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are\nhigh. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose\nnon-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and\nzero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that\na large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by\nstrategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed\npopulations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.\n", "  We develop the concept of fractal metamaterials which consist of arrays of\nnano and micron sized rings containing Josephson junctions which play the role\nof \"atoms\" in such artificial materials. We show that if some of the junctions\nhave $\\pi$-shifts in the Josephson phases that the \"atoms\" become magnetic and\ntheir arrays can have tuned positive or negative permeabilty. Each individual\n\"$\\pi$-ring\" - the Josephson ring with one $\\pi$-junction - can be in one of\ntwo energetically degenerate magnetic states in which the supercurrent flows in\nthe clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. This results in magnetic moments\nthat point downwards or upwards, respectively. The value of the total\nmagnetization of such a metamaterial may display fractal features. We describe\nthe magnetic properties of such superconducting metamaterials, including the\nmagnetic field distribution in them (i.e. in the network that is made up of\nthese rings). We also describe the way that the magnetic flux penetrates into\nthe Josephson network and how it is strongly dependent on the geometry of the\nsystem.\n", "  The Casimir force, originating from vacuum zero-point energy, is one of the\nmost intriguing purely quantum effects. It has attracted renewed interests in\ncurrent field of nanomechanics, due to the rapid size decrease of on-chip\ndevices. Here we study the optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) with a\ntunable Casimir force. We find that the optical output rate can be\nsignificantly altered by the vacuum force, even terminated and then restored,\nindicating a highly-controlled optical switch. Our result addresses the\npossibility of designing exotic optical nano-devices by harnessing the power of\nvacuum.\n", "  To further precision studies with $B \\to K^{(*)} \\ell \\ell$ decays in the\nhigh-$q^2$ window uncertainties related to the operator product expansion (OPE)\nneed to be scrutinized. How well can the OPE describe $B \\to K^* (\\to K \\pi)\n\\ell \\ell$ angular distributions for a given binning in view of the local charm\nresonance structure? We present a data-driven method to access this\nquantitatively. Our analysis suggests that the bins which are near the\nkinematic endpoint are best described by the OPE and should be pursued for\nprecision studies. At the same time measurements with finer binning help\ncontrolling the uncertainties.\n", "  A new family of conserved currents for vacuum space-times with a Killing\nvector is presented. The currents are constructed from the superenergy tensor\nof the Mars-Simon tensor and using the positivity properties of the former we\nfind that the conserved charges associated to the currents have natural\npositivity properties in certain cases. Given the role played by the Mars-Simon\ntensor in local and semi-local characterisations of the Kerr solution, the\ncurrents presented in this work are useful to construct non-negative scalar\nquantities characterising Kerr initial data (known in the literature as\nnon-Kerrness) which in addition are conserved charges.\n", "  We propose to employ the circular polarization of gravitational waves emitted\nby core-collapse supernovae as an unequivocal indication of rapid rotation deep\nin their cores. It has been demonstrated by three dimensional simulations that\nnon-axisymmetric accretion flows may develop spontaneously via hydrodynamical\ninstabilities in the post-bounce cores. It is not surprising then that the\ngravitational waves emitted by such fluid motions are circularly polarized. We\nshow in this letter that a network of the second generation detectors of\ngravitational waves worldwide may be able to detect such polarizations up to\nthe opposite side of Galaxy as long as the rotation period is shorter than a\nfew seconds prior to collapse.\n", "  We study sum uncertainty relations for arbitrary finite $N$ quantum\nmechanical observables. Some uncertainty inequalities are presented by using\nskew information introduced by Wigner and Yanase. These uncertainty\ninequalities are nontrivial as long as the observables are mutually\nnoncommutative. The relations among these new and existing uncertainty\ninequalities have been investigated. Detailed examples are presented.\n", "  The goal of community detection algorithms is to identify densely-connected\nunits within large networks. An implicit assumption is that all the constituent\nnodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are\nmore important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been\nprimarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding\nto what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most\nmetrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These\nmetrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In\nthis paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not\nuniform.\n  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength\nof membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the\nextent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its\ncommunity, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss\nhow permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution\nof communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the\npersistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen\nthe community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a\ncommunity, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.\n  We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful\ncommunities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the\nnetworks more accurately than eight other popular community detection\nalgorithms. Finally, we show that the communities obtained by this method are\n(i) less affected by the changes in vertex-ordering, and (ii) more resilient to\nresolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of values.\n", "  Oscillating chemical reactions result from complex periodic changes in the\nconcentration of the reactants. In spatially ordered ensembles of candle flame\noscillators the fluctuations in the ratio of oxygen atoms with respect to that\nof carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen produces an oscillation in the visible part of\nthe flame related to the energy released per unit mass of oxygen. Thus, the\nproducts of the reaction vary in concentration as a function of time, giving\nrise to an oscillation in the amount of soot and radiative emission.\nSynchronisation of interacting dynamical sub-systems occurs as arrays of flames\nthat act as master and slave oscillators, with groups of candles numbering\ngreater than two, creating a synchronised motion in three-dimensions. In a ring\nof candles the visible parts of each flame move together, up and down and back\nand forth, in a manner that appears like a \"worship\". Here this effect is shown\nfor rings of flames which collectively empower a central flame to pulse to\ngreater heights. In contrast, situations where the central flames are\nsuppressed are also found. The phenomena leads to in-phase synchronised states\nemerging between periods of anti-phase synchronisation for arrays with\ndifferent columnar sizes of candle and positioning.\n", "  In this note, we show that determinantal point processes on the real line\ncorresponding to de Branges spaces of entire functions are rigid in the sense\nof Ghosh-Peres and, under certain additional assumptions, quasi-invariant under\nthe group of diffeomorphisms of the line with compact support.\n", "  Automated forecasts serve important role in space weather science, by\nproviding statistical insights to flare-trigger mechanisms, and by enabling\ntailor-made forecasts and high-frequency forecasts. Only by realtime forecast\nwe can experimentally measure the performance of flare-forecasting methods\nwhile confidently avoiding overlearning.\n  We have been operating unmanned flare forecast service since August, 2015\nthat provides 24-hour-ahead forecast of solar flares, every 12 minutes. We\nreport the method and prediction results of the system.\n", "  The efficient production of electricity from nuclear fusion in magnetically\nconfined plasmas relies on a good confinement of the thermal energy. For more\nthan thirty years, the observation that such confinement depends on the mass of\nthe plasma isotope and its interaction with apparently unrelated plasma\nconditions has remained largely unexplained and it has become one of the main\nunsolved issues. By means of numerical studies based on the gyrokinetic theory,\nwe quantitatively show how the plasma microturbulence depends on the isotope\nmass through nonlinear multiscale microturbulence effects involving the\ninterplay between zonal flows, electromagnetic effects and the torque applied.\nThis finding has crucial consequences for the design of future reactors since,\nin spite of the fact that they will be composed by multiple ion species, their\nextrapolation from present day experiments heavily relies on the knowledge\nobtained from a long experimental tradition based in single isotope plasmas.\n", "  The electronic properties of aluminum-doped graphenes enriched by\nmulti-orbital hybridizations are investigated using first-principles\ncalculations. The feature-rich electronic structures exhibit the quasi-rigid\nred shifts of the carbon-created energy bands, the Al-dominated valence and\nconduction bands, and many free electrons in the conduction Dirac cone. These\nare directly reflected in the special structures of density of states (DOS).\nThe Al- and alkali-induced high free carrier densities are almost the same.\nThere exist certain important differences among the Al-, alkali- and\nhalogen-doped grapehenes, such as, the buckled or planar graphene, the\npreserved or seriously distorted Dirac cone, the existence of the\nadatom-dominated valence bands, the free electrons or holes, the degenerate or\nsplitting spin-related states, and the simple or complicated peaks in DOS. The\nsimilarities and differences mainly come from the diverse orbital\nhybridizations in adatom-C bonds, as indicated from the atom-dominated bands,\nthe spatial charge distributions and the orbital-projected DOS.\n", "  Phylogenetic approaches to classification have been heavily developed in\nbiology by bioinformaticians. But these techniques have applications in other\nfields, in particular in linguistics. Their main characteristics is to search\nfor relationships between the objects or species in study, instead of grouping\nthem by similarity. They are thus rather well suited for any kind of\nevolutionary objects. For nearly fifteen years, astrocladistics has explored\nthe use of Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) for astronomical objects like\ngalaxies or globular clusters. In this lesson we will learn how it works. 1 Why\nphylogenetic tools in astrophysics? 1.1 History of classification The need for\nclassifying living organisms is very ancient, and the first classification\nsystem can be dated back to the Greeks. The goal was very practical since it\nwas intended to distinguish between eatable and toxic aliments, or kind and\ndangerous animals. Simple resemblance was used and has been used for centuries.\nBasically, until the XVIIIth century, every naturalist chose his own criterion\nto build a classification. At the end, hundreds of classifications were\navailable, most often incompatible to each other. The criteria for this\ntraditional way of classifying is the subjective appearance of the living\norganisms. During the XVIIIth a revolution occurred. Scientists like Adanson\nand Linn{\\'e} devised new ways of classifying the objects and naming the\nclasses. Adanson realised that all the observable traits should be used, giving\nbirth to the mutivariate clustering and classification activity (Adanson,\n1763). Linn{\\'e} based his binomial nomenclature on neutral names unrelated\nwhatsoever to any property of the classes. We can realise the success of these\ntwo ideas more than two centuries and a half later!\n", "  Orbital susceptibility for Bloch electrons is calculated for the first time\nup to the first order with respect to overlap integrals between the neighboring\natomic orbitals, assuming single-band models. A general and rigorous theory of\norbital susceptibility developed in the preceding paper is applied to\nsingle-band models in two-dimensional square and triangular lattices. In\naddition to the Landau-Peierls orbital susceptibility, it is found that there\nare comparable contributions from the Fermi surface and from the occupied\nstates in the partially filled band called intraband atomic diamagnetism. This\nresult means that the Peierls phase used in tight-binding models is\ninsufficient as the effect of magnetic field.\n", "  The spatial distributions of different ion species are useful indicators for\nplasma sheet dynamics. In this statistical study based on 7 years of Cluster\nobservations, we establish the spatial distributions of oxygen ions and protons\nat energies from 274 to 955 keV, depending on geomagnetic and solar wind (SW)\nconditions. Compared with protons, the distribution of energetic oxygen has\nstronger dawn-dusk asymmetry in response to changes in the geomagnetic\nactivity. When the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is directed southward,\nthe oxygen ions show significant acceleration in the tail plasma sheet. Changes\nin the SW dynamic pressure ($\\mathit{P}_{dyn}$) affect the oxygen and proton\nintensities in the same way. The energetic protons show significant intensity\nincreases at the near-Earth duskside during disturbed geomagnetic conditions,\nenhanced SW $\\mathit{P}_{dyn}$, and southward IMF, implying there location of\neffective inductive acceleration mechanisms and a strong duskward drift due to\nthe increase of the magnetic field gradient in the near-Earth tail. Higher\nlosses of energetic ions are observed in the dayside plasma sheet under\ndisturbed geomagnetic conditions and enhanced SW $\\mathit{P}_{dyn}$. These\nobservations are in agreement with theoretical models.\n", "  We study surface defects in 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(N)$ superconformal gauge\ntheories of class $\\mathcal{S}_k$ obtained from the 6d (1,0) theories of type\n$A_{N-1}$, which are worldvolume theories on $N$ M5-branes at\n$\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_k$ singularities, compactified on Riemann surfaces\nwith punctures. First we apply a method based on Riemann surface description\nand obtain the superconformal index of the theories in the presence of surface\ndefects labelled by arbitrary symmetric representations of $su(N)$. Then we\npropose another description for the same surface defects, which involves 4d-2d\ncoupled systems, by identifying which 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theories should be\ncoupled. We compute the index of the 4d-2d systems and reproduce the results\nobtained from the first method. Finally we study the 2d TQFT structure of the\nindex for class $\\mathcal{S}_{k}$ theories by obtaining several eigenfunctions\nand eigenvalues of the difference operators that capture the surface defects\nand checking their relation.\n", "  We consider a system consisting of Rydberg dressed atoms interacting with BEC\ncondensate of diatomic molecules. Using random phase approximation (RPA) we\ncalculate the effective interactions between Rydberg atoms accounting for their\nWan der Waals repulsion and exchange of virtual excitations of the condensate\nand demonstrate that total interaction can become attractive and BCS state of\nRydberg dressed atoms can be formed. Using the example of 6Li atoms we\ndemonstrate that the strength of the interactions can be controlled optically,\nand BCS regime is achievable at realistic experimental conditions.\n", "  A concise point kinetic model of the explosion of a prompt supercritical\nsphere driven by a nuclear fission chain reaction is presented. The findings\nare in good agreement with the data available for Trinity, the first detonation\nof a nuclear weapon conducted by the United States Army as part of the\nManhattan project. Results are presented for an implosion device containing\npure plutonium-239, although the model can be easily applied to, e.g.,\nuranium-235. The fizzle probability and corresponding yield of a fission bomb\ncontaining plutonium recovered from reactor fuel and therefore containing\nsignificant amounts of spontaneously fissioning plutonium-240 which can induce\na predetonation of the device is illustrated by adding a corresponding source\nterm in the presented model. Related questions whether a bomb could be made by\ndeveloping countries or terrorist organizations can be tackled this way.\nAlthough the information needed to answer such questions is in the public\ndomain, it is difficult to extract a consistent picture of the subject for\nmembers of organizations who are concerned about the proliferation of nuclear\nexplosives.\n", "  There are many proposed prediction methods for solar cycles behavior. In a\nprevious paper we updated the full-shape curve prediction of the current solar\ncycle 24 using a non-linear dynamics method and we compared the results with\nthe predictions collected by the NOAA/SEC prediction panel, using observed data\nup to October 2010. The aim of the present paper is to give a quantitative\nevaluation, a posteriori, of the performances of these prediction methods using\na specific global error, updated on a monthly basis, which is a measure of the\nglobal performance on the predicted shape (both amplitude and phase) of the\nsolar cycle. We suggest also the use of a percent cycle similarity degree, to\nbetter evaluate the predicted shape of the solar cycle curve.\n", "  Atomic clusters presents an isolated system that models the bulk materials\nwhose mechanism of HHG remains uncertain, and a promising medium to produce HHG\nbeyond the limited conversion efficiency for gaseous atoms. Here we reveal that\nthe oscillation of collective electron motion within clusters develops after\nthe interaction of intense laser fields, and it significantly enhances the\nharmonic dipole and increases the quantum phase of the harmonics.\nExperimentally, the phase matching conditions of HHG from nanometer xenon\nclusters and atoms are distinguished, which confirms the enhanced internal\nfield that was proposed theoretically a decade ago. The separation of HHG from\natoms and clusters allows the determination of the amplitude of the HHG for\nclusters to be 5 orders higher, corresponding to 4 times higher conversion\nefficiency for atomic response. The finding provides an insight on the HHG\nmechanism of bulk materials and a means by which an efficient coherent X-ray\nsource can be developed.\n", "  Using momentum sum rule for evolution equations for Double Parton\nDistribution Functions (DPDFs) in the leading logarithmic approximation, we\nfind that the double gluon distribution function can be uniquely constrained\nvia the single gluon distribution function. We also study numerically its\nevolution with a hard scale and show that an approximately factorized ansatz\ninto the product of two single gluon distributions performs quite well at small\nvalues of $x$ but is always violated for larger values, as expected.\n", "  The electrical conductance G of magnetostrictive nanocontacts made from\nGalfenol Fe73Ga27 can be reproducibly switched between on and off states in a\nlow magnetic field of 20 to 30 mT at 10 K. The switching behavior is in\nagreement with the magnetic field dependence of the magnetostriction inferred\nfrom the magnetization behavior, causing a positive magnetostrictive strain\nalong the magnetic field. The repeated magneticfield cycling leads to a stable\ncontact geometry and to a robust contact configuration with a very low\nhysteresis of 1 mT between opening and closing the contact due to a training\neffect. Nonintegral multiples of the conductance quantum G0 observed for G is\ngreater than G0 are attributed to electron backscattering at defect sites in\nthe electrodes near the contact interface. When the contact is closed either\nmechanically or by magnetic field, the conductance shows an exponential\nbehavior below G0 due to electron tunneling. This allows to estimate the\nmagnetostriction at 10 K. The results demonstrate that such magnetostrictive\ndevices are suitable for the remote control of the conductance by low magnetic\nfields in future nanotechnology applications.\n", "  In the exploration of global-scale features of the Earth's aurora, little\nattention has been given to the radial component of the Interplanetary Magnetic\nField (IMF). This study investigates the global auroral response in both\nhemispheres when the IMF is southward and lies in the $\\textit{xz}$ plane. We\npresent a statistical study of the average auroral response in the 12-24\nmagnetic local time (MLT) sector to an $\\textit{x}$ component in the IMF. Maps\nof auroral intensity in both hemispheres for two IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated\nconditions($ \\pm $ IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$) are shown during periods of negative\nIMF $\\mathit{B}_{z}$, small IMF $\\mathit{B}_{y}$, and local winter. This is\nobtained by using global imaging from the Wideband Imaging Camera on the IMAGE\nsatellite. The analysis indicates a significant asymmetry between the two IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated conditions in both hemispheres. In the Northern\nHemisphere the aurora is brighter in the 15-19 MLT region during negative IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$. In the Southern Hemisphere the aurora is brighter in the\n16-20 MLT sector during positive IMF $\\mathit{B}_{x}$. We interpret the results\nin the context of a more efficient solar wind dynamo in one hemisphere. Both\nthe intensity asymmetry and its location are consistent with this idea. This\nhas earlier been suggested from case studies of simultaneous observations of\nthe aurora in both hemispheres, but hitherto never been observed to have a\ngeneral impact on global auroral brightness in both hemispheres from a\nstatistical study. The observed asymmetries between the two IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{x}$ cases are not large; however, the difference is significant\nwith a 95% confidence level. As the solar wind conditions examined in the study\nare rather common (37% of the time) the accumulative effect of this small\ninfluence may be important for the total energy budget.\n", "  In this manuscript, we propose a method to prepare small flakes of DyCu2. On\ntop of that we also report on the magnetocaloric effect and nature of magnetic\ntransition of a strongly anisotropic DyCu2 in its low dimension. Magnetization\nmeasurements were carried out in the temperature range of 5 to 100 K and up to\nthe maximum magnetic field strength of 50 kOe. Magnetic entropy change delta SM\nis estimated using the well known Maxwells equations and is found to be 4.31 J\nper kg K. Indeed, the delta SM peak broadened marginally compared with its bulk\nDyCu2 and such a broadening can be attributed to significant increase in the\ntotal grain boundary volume. As these small flakes consists larger delta SM\nvalues at temperatures higher than the Neel temperature TN, one can use them as\na magnetic refrigerant material in a broad temperature range. We also plotted\nthe M2 vs H by M in order to find the nature of magnetic transition. Arrott\nplots infer that indeed there exists nonlinearity in M2 vs H by M behavior and\nsuch nonlinear behavior is ascribed to the random anisotropy or a random field\nthat is present in the system.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength radio study of the nearby galaxy pair Arp 269\n(NGC 4490/85). High sensitivity to extended structures gained by using the\nmerged interferometric and single- dish maps allowed us to reveal a previously\nundiscovered extension of the radio continuum emission. Its direction is\nsignificantly different from that of the neutral gas tail, suggesting that\ndifferent physical processes might be involved in their creation. The\npopulation of radio- emitting electrons is generally young, signifying an\nongoing, vigorous star formation -- this claim is supported by strong magnetic\nfields (over 20 {\\mu}G), similar to the ones found in much larger spiral\ngalaxies. From the study of the spectral energy distribution, we conclude that\nthe electron population in the intergalactic bridge between member galaxies\noriginates from the disc areas, and therefore its age (approximately 3.7--16.9\nMyr, depending on the model used) reflects the time-scale of the interaction.\nWe have also discovered an angularly near compact steep source -- which is a\nmember of a different galaxy pair -- at a redshift of approximately 0.125.\n", "  A central issue in cell biology is the physico-chemical basis of organelle\nbiogenesis in intracellular trafficking pathways, its most impressive\nmanifestation being the biogenesis of Golgi cisternae. At a basic level, such\nmorphologically and chemically distinct compartments should arise from an\ninterplay between the molecular transport and chemical maturation. Here, we\nformulate analytically tractable, minimalist models, that incorporate this\ninterplay between transport and chemical progression in physical space, and\nexplore the conditions for de novo biogenesis of distinct cisternae. We propose\nnew quantitative measures that can discriminate between the various models of\ntransport in a qualitative manner- this includes measures of the dynamics in\nsteady state and the dynamical response to perturbations of the kind amenable\nto live-cell imaging.\n", "  The magnetopause is a current sheet forming the boundary between the\ngeomagnetic field on one side and the shocked solar wind on the other side.\nThis paper discusses properties of the low-latitude dawn and dusk flanks of the\nmagnetopause. The reported results are based on a large number of measurements\nobtained by the Cluster satellites during magnetopause traversals. Using a\ncombination of single-spacecraft and multispacecraft techniques, we calculated\nmacroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the\nmagnetopause. The results show that the typical flank magnetopause is\nsignificantly thicker than the dayside magnetopause and also possesses a\npronounced and persistent dawn-dusk asymmetry. Thicknesses vary from 150 to\n5000 km, with an median thickness of around 1400 km at dawn and around 1150 km\nat dusk. Current densities are on average higher on dusk, suggesting that the\ntotal current at dawn and dusk are similar. Solar wind conditions and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field cannot fully explain the observed dawn-dusk\nasymmetry. For a number of crossings we were also able to derive detailed\ncurrent density profiles. The profiles show that the magnetopause often\nconsists of two or more adjacent current sheets, each current sheet typically\nseveral ion gyroradii thick and often with different current direction. This\ndemonstrates that the flank magnetopause has a structure that is more complex\nthan the thin, one-dimensional current sheet described by a Chapman-Ferraro\nlayer.\n", "  Hybrid perovskite thin films have demonstrated impressive performance for\nsolar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications. However, further\nprogress will benefit from a better knowledge of the intrinsic photophysics of\nmaterials. Here, the low temperature emission properties of CH3NH3PbI3 single\ncrystals are investigated and compared to those of thin polycrystalline films\nby means of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy.\nWhile the emission properties of thin films and crystals appear relatively\nsimilar at room temperature, low temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy\nreveals striking differences between the two materials. Single crystals\nphotoluminescence exhibits a sharp excitonic emission at high energy, with Full\nWidth at Half Maximum of only 5 meV, assigned to free excitonic recombination\nand a broad band at low energy. We analyzed the thermal evolution of the free\nexcitonic intensity and linewidth. An excitonic binding energy of 28 meV is\nextracted from the quenching of the photoluminescence. We highlight a strong\nbroadening of the emission due to LO phonon coupling. The free excitonic\nemission turned to be very short-lived with a sub-nanosecond dynamics, mainly\ninduced by the fast trapping of the excitons. The free excitonic emission is\ncompletely absent of the thin films spectra, which are dominated by trap states\nband. The trap states energies, width and recombination dynamics present\nimportant similarities between films and crystals. These results suggest that\nthe trap states are formed at the surface and grain interface of perovskites.\n", "  In this paper we investigate which coordinate representation is most\nappropriate when analyzing ground magnetometer data in terms of ionospheric\ncurrents, in particular the westward electrojet. The $\\textit{AL}$ and the\nrecently introduced $\\textit{SML}$ index are frequently used as monitors of the\nwestward electrojet. Both indices are based on ground magnetometers at auroral\nlatitudes. From these magnetometers, the largest perturbation in the southward\ndirection is selected as the $\\textit{ AL/SML }$ index at 1 min cadence. The\nsouthward component is defined as antiparallel to the orientation of the\nhorizontal part of the Earths' main field, $\\textbf{B}_{0, \\textit{H}}$. The\nimplicit assumption when using these indices as a monitor of the westward\nelectrojet is that the electrojet flows perpendicular to $\\textbf{B}_{0,\n\\textit{H}}$. However, $\\textbf{B}_{0, \\textit{H}}$ is, in general, not\nperpendicular to the westward direction in coordinate systems that take\nnondipole terms of the Earth's magnetic field into account, such as apex and\nthe Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic coordinate systems. In this paper\nwe derive a new $\\textit{SML}$ index, based on apex coordinates. We find that\nthe new index has less variation with longitude and universal time (UT),\ncompared to the traditionally defined $\\textit{SML}$. We argue that when\nanalyzing ionospheric currents using magnetometers, it is appropriate to\nconvert the components to a corrected geomagnetic system. This is most\nimportant when considering longitudinal or UT variations, or when data from a\nlimited region are used.\n", "  We have calculated the quenching parameter, $\\hat{q}$ in a model-independent\nway using the gauge-gravity duality. In earlier calculations, the geometry in\nthe gravity side at finite temperature was usually taken as the pure AdS\nblackhole metric for which the dual gauge theory becomes conformally invariant\nunlike QCD. Therefore we use a metric which incorporates the fundamental quarks\nby embedding the coincident D7 branes in the Klebanov-Tseytlin background and a\nfinite temperature is switched on by inserting a black hole into the\nbackground, known as OKS-BH metric. Further inclusion of an additional UV cap\nto the metric prepares the dual gauge theory to run similar to thermal QCD.\nMoreover $\\hat{q}$ is usually defined in the literature from the Glauber-model\nperturbative QCD evaluation of the Wilson loop, which has no reasons to hold if\nthe coupling is large and is thus against the main idea of gauge-gravity\nduality. Thus we use an appropriate definition of $\\hat{q}$: $\\hat{q} L^- =\n1/L^2$, where $L$ is the separation for which the Wilson loop is equal to some\nspecific value. The above two refinements cause $\\hat{q}$ to vary with the\ntemperature as $T^4$ always and to depend linearly on the light-cone time $L^-$\nwith an additional ($1/L^-$) correction term in the short-distance limit\nwhereas in the long-distance limit, it depends only linearly on $L^-$ with no\ncorrection term. These observations agree with other holographic calculations\ndirectly or indirectly.\n", "  We investigate the kinematics and ionization structure of the broad emission\nline region of the gravitationally lensed quasar QSO2237+0305 (the Einstein\ncross) using differential microlensing in the high- and low-ionization broad\nemission lines. We combine visible and near-infrared spectra of the four images\nof the lensed quasar and detect a large-amplitude microlensing effect\ndistorting the high-ionization CIV and low-ionization H$\\alpha$ line profiles\nin image A. While microlensing only magnifies the red wing of the Balmer line,\nit symmetrically magnifies the wings of the CIV emission line. Given that the\nsame microlensing pattern magnifies both the high- and low-ionization broad\nemission line regions, these dissimilar distortions of the line profiles\nsuggest that the high- and low-ionization regions are governed by different\nkinematics. Since this quasar is likely viewed at intermediate inclination, we\nargue that the differential magnification of the blue and red wings of\nH$\\alpha$ favors a flattened, virialized, low-ionization region whereas the\nsymmetric microlensing effect measured in CIV can be reproduced by an emission\nline formed in a polar wind, without the need of fine-tuned caustic\nconfigurations.\n", "  The link between the longitudinal electromagnetic waves and the system of\nMaxwell equations is demonstrated. The longitudinal wave component of the\nelectric field strength vector is found as the exact solution of the standard\nMaxwell equations with specific gradient-type case of electric current and\ncharge densities.\n", "  We present a far-IR survey of the entire Mon R2 GMC with $Herschel-SPIRE$\ncross-calibrated with $Planck-HFI$ data. We fit the SEDs of each pixel with a\ngreybody function and an optimal beta value of 1.8. We find that mid-range\ncolumn densities obtained from far-IR dust emission and near-IR extinction are\nconsistent. For the entire GMC, we find that the column density histogram, or\nN-PDF, is lognormal below $\\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Above this value, the\ndistribution takes a power law form with an index of -2.16. We analyze the gas\ngeometry, N-PDF shape, and YSO content of a selection of subregions in the\ncloud. We find no regions with pure lognormal N-PDFs. The regions with a\ncombination of lognormal and one power law N-PDF have a YSO cluster and a\ncorresponding centrally concentrated gas clump. The regions with a combination\nof lognormal and two power law N-PDF have significant numbers of typically\nyounger YSOs but no prominent YSO cluster. These regions are composed of an\naggregate of closely spaced gas filaments with no concentrated dense gas clump.\nWe find that for our fixed scale regions, the YSO count roughly correlates with\nthe N-PDF power law index. The correlation appears steeper for single power law\nregions relative to two power law regions with a high column density cut-off,\nas a greater dense gas mass fraction is achieved in the former. A stronger\ncorrelation is found between embedded YSO count and the dense gas mass among\nour regions.\n", "  Bond-order potentials (BOPs) are derived from the tight-binding (TB)\napproximation and provide a linearly-scaling computation of the energy and\nforces for a system of interacting atoms. While the numerical BOPs involve the\nnumerical integration of the response (Green's) function, the expressions for\nthe energy and interatomic forces are analytical within the formalism of the\nanalytic BOPs. In this paper we present a detailed comparison of numerical and\nanalytic BOPs. We use established parametrisations for the bcc refractory\nmetals W and Mo and test structural energy differences; tetragonal, trigonal,\nhexagonal and orthorhombic deformation paths; formation energies of point\ndefects as well as phonon dispersion relations. We find that the numerical and\nanalytic BOPs generally are in very good agreement for the calculation of\nenergies. Different from the numerical BOPs, the forces in the analytic BOPs\ncorrespond exactly to the negative gradients of the energy. This makes it\npossible to use the analytic BOPs in dynamical simulations and leads to\nimproved predictions of defect energies and phonons as compared to the\nnumerical BOPs.\n", "  We present multi-epoch Ks band imaging of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A\n(Cas A). The morphology of the emission in this band is generally diffuse and\nfilamentary, consistent with synchrotron radiation observed at radio\nwavelengths. However, in one region to the southwest of the remnant, compact\nknots of emission appear to be entrained in the ejecta and have the same proper\nmotion as ejecta observed at similar projected radii. The presence of these\nknots suggests that material with high magnetic field strength contributes\nsignificantly to synchrotron emission at these wavelengths. We analyze these\nknots at J, H, and Ks bands as well as in 3.5-8 micron emission and at 6 cm\nwhere synchrotron emission is dominant and we find that the Ks band emission\nfalls along the expected synchrotron spectrum. Using multi-epoch data, we\ncalculate the magnetic field strength and electron density for a population of\nnear-infrared synchrotron-emitting electrons. We find electron densities from\n1,000-15,000 cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field strengths from 1.3-5.8 mG. These\nmagnetic field strengths are an order of magnitude higher than inferred from\nthe much lower angular resolution gamma-ray observations toward Cas A. We\nconclude that dense knots of post-shock material behind the Cas A shock front\nare emitting synchrotron emission in a compressed and enhanced magnetic field.\n", "  We report the successful commissioning and testing of a dedicated\nfield-ioniser chamber for measuring principal quantum number distributions in\nantihydrogen as part of the ASACUSA hyperfine spectroscopy apparatus. The new\nchamber is combined with a beam normalisation detector that consists of plastic\nscintillators and a retractable passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS)\ndetector.\n", "  Modelling the vascular transport and adhesion of man-made particles is\ncrucial for optimizing their efficacy in the detection and treatment of\ndiseases. Here, a Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods are combined\ntogether for predicting the near wall dynamics of particles with different\nshapes in a laminar flow. For the lattice Boltzmann modelling, a Gauss-Hermite\nprojection is used to derive the lattice equation, wall boundary conditions are\nimposed through the Zou-He framework, and a moving least squares algorithm\naccurately reconstructs the forcing term accounting for the immersed boundary.\nFirst, the computational code is validated against two well-known test cases:\nthe sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid. A\nvery good agreement is observed between the present results and those available\nin the literature. Then, the transport of circular, elliptical, rectangular,\nsquare and triangular particles is analyzed in a Couette flow, at Re=20. All\nparticles drifted laterally across the stream lines reaching an equilibrium\nposition, independently of the initial conditions. For this large Reynolds\nnumber, the particle shape has no significant effect on the final equilibrium\nposition but it does affect the absolute value and periodicity of the angular\nvelocity. Specifically, elongated particles show longer oscillation periods\nand, most interestingly, larger variations in angular velocity. The longest\nparticles exhibit a zero angular velocity for almost the whole rotational\nperiod. Collectively, this data demonstrates that the proposed approach can be\nefficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically\nrelevant flows. This computational strategy could have significant impact in\nthe field of computational nanomedicine for optimizing the specific delivery of\ntherapeutic and imaging agents.\n", "  A series of density functional electronic structure calculations were carried\nout to better understand the crystallographic factors governing the stability\nof LinA3B2O12 lithium garnet phases against hydration. The reaction studied is\nH2O + LinA3B2O12 = LiOH + HnA3B2O12. Most of the compositions are stable\nagainst pure water; the main driving force for instability in the atmosphere is\nthe reaction of lithium hydroxide with CO2 to make lithium carbonate. The\ncalculated hydration resistance scales with the Pauling bond valence on the\noxygen atom contributed by the coordinating A and B ions. In the unexchanged\nLi-garnets, this bond valence must be balanced by lithium, so there is also a\ngood overall correlation of hydration stability with lithium stoichiometry (n):\nhydration resistance increases in the order Li8-garnet < Li7-garnet <\nLi6-garnet < Li5-garnet < Li3-garnet. Only Li3A3B2O12 garnets have proton\nexchange energies sufficiently positive to overcome the decomposition energy of\nlithium hydroxide into lithium carbonate + water; the n=3 garnets are predicted\nto be stable to hydration under atmospheric conditions, in agreement with\nobservations (Galven et al. Chem. Mater. 2012 24, 3335-3345). At a given\nlithium ion stoichiometry, hydration resistance is greater for A, B ions having\nsmaller ionic radii.\n", "  The ability of stacks of superconducting tapes to trap large magnetic fields\nmakes them ideal candidates for creating powerful permanent magnets of compact\nsize and mass. Experimentally, several techniques are used to trap the maximum\npossible field in a given practical application. However, regardless of the\nmagnetization method used, there is a physical limit to the maximum magnetic\nfield that a given superconducting magnet can trap. This limit is given by the\ngeometric design, the particular superconducting material used and the\ntemperature of operation. Knowing the maximum possible trapped field is\nimportant for device design as it provides an upper limit for applications such\nas magnetic bearings or rotating machinery. In this work we present a\ncollection of finite element method (FEM) models in 2D and 3D capable of\nestimating the maximum trapped field of stacked tape superconducting magnets.\nThe models are computationally fast and can be used to perform parametric\nstudies with ease. For the case of square stacks tape magnets, various sizes\nare considered and their estimated maximum trapped field is compared with\nexperimental results.\n", "  Let us consider the elliptic restricted three body problem (Elliptic RTBP)\nfor the Jupiter Sun system with eccentricity $e=0.048$ and $\\mu=0.000953339$.\nLet us denote by $T$ the period of their orbits. In this paper we provide\ninitial conditions for the position and velocity for a spacecraft such that\nafter one period $T$ the spacecraft comes back to the same place, with the same\nvelocity, within an error of 4 meters for the position and 0.2 meters per\nsecond for the velocity. Taking this solution as periodic, we present numerical\nevidence showing that this solution is stable. In order to compare this\nperiodic solution with the motion of celestial bodies in our solar system, we\nend this paper by providing an ephemeris of the spacecraft motion from February\n17, 2017 to December 28, 2028.\n", "  The Comment to the Letter \"Excitons in Molecular Aggregates with Levy\nDisorder: Anomalous Localization and Exchange Broadening of Optical Spectra\"\nappeared in Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 259701 (submitted on November 28, 2011). I\nprepared the below response to the rebuttal received from the Letter's Authors\nin the review process. It contains useful comments, which further address the\nerrors in the Letter and other flaws in Authors' understanding of the topic\nrevealed in discussion.\n", "  We developed and experimentally verified an analytical model to describe\ndiffusion of oligonucleotides from stable hydrogel beads. The synthesized\nalginate beads are Fe3+-cross-linked as well as polyelectrolyte-doped for\nuniformity and stability at physiological pH. Data on diffusion of\noligonucleotides from inside the beads provide physical insights into the\nvolume nature of the immobilization of a fraction of oligonucleotides due to\npolyelectrolyte cross-linking, i.e., the absence of the surface-layer barrier\nin this case. Furthermore, our results suggest a new simple approach to\nmeasuring the diffusion coefficient of the mobile oligonucleotide molecules\ninside hydrogel. The considered alginate beads provide a model for a\nwell-defined component in drug release systems and for the\noligonucleotide-release transduction steps in drug-delivering and biocomputing\napplications. This is illustrated by destabilizing the beads with citrate that\ninduces full oligonucleotide release with non-diffusional kinetics.\n", "  In this paper, we simulate a front surface inverted pyramidal grating texture\non 2 to 400 micron thick silicon and optimize it to derive maximum photocurrent\ndensity from the cell. We identify a one size fits all front grating period of\n1000 nm that leads to maximum photo-absorption of normally incident AM1.5g\nsolar spectrum in silicon (configured with a back surface reflector)\nirrespective of the thickness of the crystalline silicon absorbing layer. With\nthe identification of such universally optimized periodicity for the case of an\ninverted pyramidal grating texture, a common fabrication process can be\ndesigned to manufacture high-efficiency devices on crystalline silicon\nregardless of wafer thickness. In order to validate the results of the\nsimulation, we fabricated high resolution inverted pyramidal textures on a 400\nmicron thick silicon wafer with electron beam lithography to compare the\nreflectance from submicron and wavelength scale periodic textures. The\nexperimental reflectance measurements on textures confirm that a 1000 nm period\ngrating texture performs better than a 500 nm period texture in reducing\nreflectance, in agreement with the simulations.\n", "  The collective modes of a familiar two-dimensional one-component-plasma with\nthe repulsive logarithmic interaction between the particles are analysed using\nthe quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) combined with the molecular dynamic\nsimulation of the equilibrium structural properties. It is found that the\ndispersion curves in the strongly coupled regime are virtually independent of\nthe coupling strength. Arguments based on the excluded volume consideration for\nthe radial distribution function allow us to derive very simple expressions for\nthe dispersion relations, which show excellent agreement with the exact QCA\ndispersion over the entire domain of wavelengths. Comparison with the results\nof the conventional fluid analysis is performed and the difference is\nexplained.\n", "  The time it takes to fall down a tunnel through the center of the Earth to\nthe other side takes approximately 42 minutes, but only when given several\nsimplifying assumptions: a uniform density Earth; a gravitational field that\nvaries linearly with radial position; a non-rotating Earth; a tunnel evacuated\nof air; and zero friction along the sides of the tunnel. Though several papers\nhave singularly relaxed the first three assumptions, in this paper we relax the\nfinal two assumptions and analyze the motion of a body experiencing these types\nof drag forces in the tunnel. Under such drag forces, we calculate the motion\nof a transport vehicle through a tunnel of the Earth under uniform density,\nunder constant gravitational acceleration, and finally under the more realistic\nPreliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) density data. We find the density\nprofile corresponding to a constant gravitational acceleration better models\nthe motion through the tunnel compared to the PREM density profile, and the\nuniform density model fares worse.\n", "  We derive equations for the strongly coupled system of light and dense atomic\nensembles. The formalism includes an arbitrary internal level structure for the\natoms and is not restricted to weak excitation of atoms by light. In the low\nlight intensity limit for atoms with a single electronic ground state, the full\nquantum field-theoretical representation of the model can be solved exactly by\nmeans of classical stochastic electrodynamics simulations for stationary atoms\nthat represent cold atomic ensembles. Simulations for the optical response of\natoms in a quantum degenerate regime require one to synthesize a stochastic\nensemble of atomic positions that generates the corresponding quantum\nstatistical position correlations between the atoms. In the case of multiple\nground levels or at light intensities where saturation becomes important, the\nclassical simulations require approximations that neglect quantum fluctuations\nbetween the levels. We show how the model is extended to incorporate\ncorrections due to quantum fluctuations that result from virtual scattering\nprocesses. In the low light intensity limit we illustrate the simulations in a\nsystem of atoms in a Mott-insulator state in a 2D optical lattice, where\nrecurrent scattering of light induces strong interatomic correlations. These\ncorrelations result in collective many-atom subradiant and superradiant states\nand a strong dependence of the response on the spatial confinement within the\nlattice sites.\n", "  Igniting cornstarch powder is a classic physics demonstration that showcases\nthe rapid conduction of heat for a material in which the surface area is\ngreater than the volume of its constituent particles. Including such a\ndemonstration in a physics \"magic show\" for the general public presents certain\nchallenges such as reproducibility and consistent crowd appeal. A simple but\neffective design for widely scattering cornstarch dust over a flame breaches\nthese challenges and always results in consistently large, crowd-pleasing\nfireballs; so much so that the resulting demonstration has been dubbed the\n\"cornstarch flamethrower.\" A small-scale version may also be used effectively\nfor classroom instruction.\n", "  A method for producing narrow-band THz radiation proposes passing an\nultra-relativistic beam through a metallic pipe with small periodic\ncorrugations. We present results of a measurement of such an arrangement at\nBrookhaven's Accelerator Test Facility (ATF). Our pipe was copper and was 5 cm\nlong; the aperture was cylindrically symmetric, with a 1 mm (radius) bore and a\ncorrugation depth (peak-to-peak) of 60 um. In the experiment we measured both\nthe effect on the beam of the structure wakefield and the spectral properties\nof the radiation excited by the beam. We began by injecting a relatively long\nbeam compared to the wavelength of the radiation to excite the structure, and\nthen used a downstream spectrometer to infer the radiation wavelength. This was\nfollowed by injecting a shorter bunch, and then using an interferometer (also\ndownstream of the corrugated pipe) to measure the spectrum of the induced THz\nradiation.\n", "  Two level quantum mechanical systems like spin 1/2 particles lend themselves\nas a natural qubit implementation. However, encoding a single qubit in several\nspins reduces the resources necessary for qubit control and can protect from\ndecoherence channels. While several varieties of such encoded spin qubits have\nbeen implemented, accurate control remains challenging, and leakage out of the\nsubspace of valid qubit states is a potential issue. Here, we realize\nhigh-fidelity single qubit operations for a qubit encoded in two electron spins\nin GaAs quantum dots by iterative tuning of the all-electrical control pulses.\nUsing randomized benchmarking, we find an average gate fidelity of $\\mathcal{F}\n= (98.5 \\pm 0.1)\\,\\%$ and determine the leakage rate between the computational\nsubspace and other states to $\\mathcal{L} = (0.4\\pm0.1)\\,\\%$. These results\nalso demonstrate that high fidelity gates can be realized even in the presence\nof nuclear spins as in III-V semiconductors.\n", "  In Elementary Cycles theory elementary quantum particles are consistently\ndescribed as the manifestation of ultra-fast relativistic spacetime cyclic\ndynamics, classical in the essence. The peculiar relativistic geometrodynamics\nof Elementary Cycles theory yields de facto a unification of ordinary\nrelativistic and quantum physics. In particular its classical-relativistic\ncyclic dynamics reproduce exactly from classical physics first principles all\nthe fundamental aspects of Quantum Mechanics, such as all its axioms, the\nFeynman path integral, the Dirac quantisation prescription (second\nquantisation), quantum dynamics of statistical systems, non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics, atomic physics, superconductivity, graphene physics and so\non. Furthermore the theory allows for the explicit derivation of gauge\ninteractions, without postulating gauge invariance, directly from relativistic\ngeometrodynamical transformations, in close analogy with the description of\ngravitational interaction in general relativity. In this paper we summarise\nsome of the major achievements, rigorously proven also in several recent\npeer-reviewed papers, of this innovative formulation of quantum particle\nphysics.\n", "  We report a simple demonstration of radiation pressure on a table-top\nexperiment. Utilizing dynamic force microscopy in ambient environment, the\nresonant motion of a cm-sized cantilever driven by an amplitude-modulated diode\nlaser is directly observed. Our versatile setup involves a host of exciting\ntechniques that are relevant in precision force measurements and represents an\nideal experiment in the undergraduate laboratory.\n", "  In their Letter \"Excitons in Molecular Aggregates with Levy Disorder:\nAnomalous Localization and Exchange Broadening of Optical Spectra\", Eisfeld et\nal. predicted the existence of exchange broadening and blue-shift of the\nabsorption band and a non-universal disorder scaling of the localisation length\nof absorption band excitons in J-aggregates with heavy-tailed disorder, which\nthey contrasted with the previously analysed Gaussian and Lorentzian case. The\nobservations were explained by another localisation mechanism, the chain\nsegmentation by outliers in heavy tails of the disorder distribution. We argue\nthat the previously known theory does not break down and consequently\nanticipates the properties of the absorption band investigated in the commented\nwork.\n", "  We present a relativistic formalism inspired on the Minkowski four-vectors\nthat also includes conservation laws such as the first law of thermodynamics.\nIt remains close to the relativistic four-vector formalism developed for a\nsingle particle, but it is also related to the classical treatment of problems\nthat imperatively require both the Newton's second law and the energy\nconservation law. We apply the developed formalism to inelastic collisions to\nbetter show how it works.\n", "  A generalized 3 flavor Nambu-Jona--Lasinio Lagrangian including the explicit\nchiral symmetry breaking interactions which contribute at the same order in the\nlarge $1/N_c$ counting as the $U_A(1)$ 't Hooft flavor determinant is\nconsidered to obtain the mixing angles in the $\\pi^0-\\eta-\\eta'$ system and\nrelated current quark mass ratios in close agreement with phenomenological\nvalues. At the same time an accurate ordering and magnitude of the splitting of\nstates in the low lying pseudoscalar nonet is obtained.\n", "  Bioinspired artificial surfaces with tailored adhesive properties have\nattracted significant interest. While fibrillar adhesive pads mimicking gecko\nfeet are optimized for strong reversible adhesion, monolithic microsphere\narrays mimicking the slippery zone of the pitchers of carnivorous plants of the\ngenus Nepenthes show anti-adhesive properties even against tacky counterpart\nsurfaces. In contrast to the influence of topography, the influence of relative\nhumidity (RH) on adhesion has been widely neglected. Some previous works deal\nwith the influence of RH on the adhesive performance of fibrillar adhesive\npads. Commonly, humidity-induced softening of the fibrils enhances adhesion.\nHowever, little is known on the influence of RH on solid anti-adhesive\nsurfaces. We prepared polymeric nanoporous monolithic microsphere arrays\n(NMMAs) with microsphere diameters of a few 10 {\\mu}m to test their\nanti-adhesive properties at RHs of 2 % and 90 %. Despite the presence of\ncontinuous nanopore systems through which the inner nanopore walls were\naccessible to humid air, the topography-induced anti-adhesive properties of\nNMMAs on tacky counterpart surfaces were retained even at RH = 90 %. This\nRH-independent robustness of the anti-adhesive properties of NMMAs\nsignificantly contrasts the adhesion enhancement by humidity-induced softening\non nanoporous fibrillar adhesive pads made of the same material.\n", "  We present revised measurements of the static electric dipole\npolarizabilities of K, Rb, and Cs based on atom interferometer experiments\npresented in [Phys. Rev. A 2015, 92, 052513] but now re-analyzed with new\ncalibrations for the magnitude and geometry of the applied electric field\ngradient. The resulting polarizability values did not change, but the\nuncertainties were significantly reduced. Then we interpret several\nmeasurements of alkali metal atomic polarizabilities in terms of atomic\noscillator strengths $f_{ik}$, Einstein coefficients $A_{ik}$, state lifetimes\n$\\tau_{k}$, transition dipole matrix elements $D_{ik}$, line strengths\n$S_{ik}$, and van der Waals $C_6$ coefficients. Finally, we combine atom\ninterferometer measurements of polarizabilities with independent measurements\nof lifetimes and $C_6$ values in order to quantify the residual contribution to\npolarizability due to all atomic transitions other than the principal\n$ns$-$np_J$ transitions for alkali metal atoms.\n", "  We propose a method to study the tunneling process by analyzing the\ntime-dependent ionization yield in circularly polarized laser. A numerical\ncalculation shows that for an atom exposed to a long laser pulse, if its\ninitial electronic state wave function is non-spherical symmetric, the delayed\nphase shift of the ionization rate vs. the laser cycle period in real time in\nthe region close to the peak intensity of the laser pulse can be used to probe\nthe tunneling time. In this region, an obvious delay phase shift is observed,\nshowing the tunneling time is in order of tens of attoseconds. Further study\nshows the atom has a longer tunneling time in the ionization under a shorter\nwavelength laser pulse. In our method, a Wigner rotation technique is employed\nto numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation of a\nsingle-active-electron in a three dimensional spherical coordinate system.\n", "  Violations of the second law of thermodynamics for small systems well below\nthe thermodynamic limit has already been experimentally observed. However, the\neffects of such violations on experimentally measurable quantities have not\nbeen studied in detail. Here we report the effect of transient violations,\ni.e., spontaneous transfer of heat from cold to hot objects, on heat transfer\nin silicon nanowire by modeling the violations as a Poisson process. Our\nmodeling and simulations show that it is increasingly difficult to cool down\nthe nanoscale objects to the bath temperature, there is a transition from power\nlaw to exponential behavior, and the fluctuations have inverse square law\ndependence on number of sites.\n", "  Carrier-induced nature of ferromagnetism in a ferromagnetic semiconductor,\n(Ga,Mn)As, offers a great opportunity to observe novel spin-related phenomena\nas well as to demonstrate new functionalities of spintronic devices. Here, we\nreport on low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission studies of the valence\nband in this model compound. By a direct determination of the distance of the\nsplit-off band to the Fermi energy EF, we conclude that EF is located within\nthe heavy/light hole band. However, the bands are strongly perturbed by\ndisorder and disorder-induced carrier correlations that lead to the Coulomb gap\nat EF, which we resolve experimentally in a series of samples, and show that\nits depth and width enlarge when the Curie temperature decreases. Furthermore,\nwe have detected surprising linear magnetic dichroism in photoemission spectra\nof the split-off band. By a quantitative theoretical analysis we demonstrate\nthat it arises from the Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit term in zinc-blende\ncrystals. The spectroscopic access to the magnitude of such asymmetric part of\nspin-orbit coupling is worthwhile, as they account for spin-orbit torque in\nspintronic devices of ferromagnets without inversion symmetry.\n", "  Most of the meteor radioastronomical radars are backscatter radars which\ncover only a small area of the atmosphere. Therefore a daytime meteor flux\nmodels are based on sparse data collected by only a few radar systems. To solve\nthis issue, a radar system with a wide coverage is required. We present a new\napproach of open-source multi-static radio meteor detection system which could\nbe distributed over a large area. This feature allows us to detect meteor\nevents taking place over a larger area as well and gather more uniform data\nabout meteor flux and possibly about meteor trajectories.\n", "  We construct eight implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes up to\nthird order of the type in which all stages are implicit so that they can be\nused in the zero relaxation limit in a unified and convenient manner. These\nall-stages-implicit (ASI) schemes attain the strong-stability-preserving (SSP)\nproperty in the limiting case, and two are SSP for not only the explicit part\nbut also the implicit part and the entire IMEX scheme. Three schemes can\ncompletely recover to the designed accuracy order in two sides of the\nrelaxation parameter for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium initial\nconditions. Two schemes converge nearly uniformly for equilibrium cases. These\nASI schemes can be used for hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms or\ndifferential equations with some type constraints.\n", "  We define a DNA as a sequence of $\\pm 1$'s and embed it on a path of Cayley\ntree. Using group representation of the Cayley tree, we give a hierarchy of a\ncountable set of DNAs each of which 'lives' on the same Cayley tree. This\nhierarchy has property that each vertex of the Cayley tree belongs only to one\nof DNA. Then we give a model (energy, Hamiltonian) of this set of DNAs by an\nanalogue of Ising model with three spin values (considered as DNA base pairs)\non a set of admissible configurations. To study thermodynamic properties of the\nmodel of DNAs we describe corresponding translation invariant Gibbs measures\n(TIGM) of the model on the Cayley tree of order two. We show that there is a\ncritical temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ such that (i) if temperature $T>T_{\\rm c}$\nthen there exists unique TIGM; (ii) if $T=T_{\\rm c}$ then there are two TIGMs;\n(iii) if $T<T_{\\rm c}$ then there are three TIGMs. Each such measure describes\na phase of the set of DNAs. We use these results to study distributions of\nHolliday junctions and branches of DNAs. In case of very high and very low\ntemperatures we give stationary distributions and typical configurations of the\nHolliday junctions.\n", "  In gravitational microlensing, binary systems may act as lenses or sources.\nIdentifying lens binarity is generally easy especially in events characterized\nby caustic crossing since the resulting light curve exhibits strong deviations\nfrom smooth single-lensing light curve. On the contrary, light curves with\nminor deviations from a Paczy\\'nski behaviour do not allow one to identify the\nsource binarity. A consequence of the gravitational microlensing is the shift\nof the position of the multiple image centroid with respect to the source star\nlocation - the so called astrometric microlensing signal. When the astrometric\nsignal is considered, the presence of a binary source manifests with a path\nthat largely differs from that expected for single-source events. Here, we\ninvestigate the astrometric signatures of binary sources taking into account\ntheir orbital motion and the parallax effect due to the Earth motion, which\nturn out not to be negligible in most cases. We also show that considering the\nabove-mentioned effects is important in the analysis of astrometric data in\norder to correctly estimate the lens-event parameters.\n", "  The most intriguing observation of cuprate experiments is most likely the\nmetal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the underdome region of the\ntemperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic\nfield, when the superconductivity is suppressed. This MIC, which results in\nsuch phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio,\nnonlinear entropy, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and\nFermi pockets, reveals the nonconventional dielectric property of the\npseudogap-normal phase. Since conventional superconductivity appears from a\nconducting normal phase, the understanding of how superconductivity arises from\nan insulating state becomes a fundamental problem and thus the keystone for all\nof cuprate physics. Recently, in interpreting the physics of visualization in\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) real space nanoregions (NRs), which exhibit\nan energy gap, we have succeeded in understanding that the minimum size for\nthese NRs provides pseudogap and superconductivity pairs, which are single\nbosons. In this work, we discuss the intra-particle magnetic spin and charge\nfluctuations of these bosons, observed recently in hidden magnetic order and\nSTM experiments. We find that all the mentioned MIC phenomena can be obtained\nin the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we\nrecently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of sample percolating NRs of\nsingle fermions into those of single bosons.\n", "  Yang-Mills theory is studied in three dimensions using the equations of\nmotion of the $1$PI and $3$PI effective actions. The employed self-contained\ntruncation includes the propagators, the three-point functions and the\nfour-gluon vertex dynamically. In the gluon propagator also two-loop diagrams\nare taken into account. The higher gluonic correlation functions show sizable\ndeviations from the tree-level only at low momenta. Also the couplings derived\nfrom the vertices agree well down to a few GeV. In addition, different methods\nto subtract spurious divergences are explored.\n", "  The quantum phase transition, scaling behaviors, and thermodynamics in the\nspin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic coupling $J>0$ in\narmchair direction and ferromagnetic interaction $J'<0$ in zigzag direction on\na honeycomb lattice are systematically studied using the continuous-time\nquantum Monte Carlo method. By calculating the Binder ratio $Q_{2}$ and spin\nstiffness $\\rho$ in two directions for various coupling ratio $\\alpha=J'/J$\nunder different lattice sizes, we found that a quantum phase transition from\nthe dimerized phase to the stripe phase occurs at the quantum critical point\n$\\alpha_c=-0.93$. Through the finite-size scaling analysis on $Q_{2}$,\n$\\rho_{x}$ and $\\rho_{y}$, we determined the critical exponent related to the\ncorrelation length $\\nu$ to be 0.7212(8), implying that this transition falls\ninto a classical Heisenberg O(3) universality. A zero magnetization plateau is\nobserved in the dimerized phase, whose width decreases with increasing\n$\\alpha$. A phase diagram in the coupling ratio $\\alpha$-magnetic field $h$\nplane is obtained, where four phases, including dimerized, stripe, canted\nstripe and polarized phases are identified. It is also unveiled that the\ntemperature dependence of the specific heat $C(T)$ for different $\\alpha$'s\nintersects precisely at one point, similar to that of liquid $^{3}$He under\ndifferent pressures and several magnetic compounds under various magnetic\nfields. The scaling behaviors of $Q_{2}$, $\\rho$ and $C(T)$ are carefully\nanalyzed. The susceptibility is well compared with the experimental data to\ngive the magnetic parameters of both compounds.\n", "  Bound- and excited-state electronic nonlinearities in CdS quantum dots have\nbeen investigated by Degenerate Four-Wave Mixing (DFWM) and Z-scan techniques\nin the femtosecond time regime. This QD sample shows Kerr-type nonlinearity for\nincident beam intensity below 0.18 TW/cm$^2$. However, further increment in\nintensity results in four-photon absorption (4PA) indicated by open- and\nclosed-aperture Z-scan experiments. Comparing open-aperture Z-scan experimental\nresults with theoretical models, the 4PA coefficient $\\alpha_4$ has been\ndeduced. Furthermore, third-order nonlinear index $\\gamma$ and refractive-index\nchange coefficient $\\sigma_r$ corresponding to excited-state electrons due to\n4PA have been calculated from the closed-aperture Z-scan results. UV-visible\nabsorption and photoluminescence experimental results are analyzed towards\nestimating band gap energy and defect state energy. Time Correlated Single\nPhoton Counting (TCSPC) was employed to determine the decay time corresponding\nto band-edge and defect states. The linear and nonlinear optical techniques\nhave allowed the direct observation of lower and higher-order electronic states\nin CdS quantum dots.\n", "  Hierarchical self-assembly arranges nanostructures at different length\nscales. It gradually becomes an effective method of fabricating artificial\nmetamaterials from composite nanostructures tailored for a particular response.\nHierarchical self-assembly overcomes shortcomings of \"top-down\" methods by\nsignificantly reducing fabrication time and making it possible to form bulk\nmaterials. Here we report an application of hierarchical self-assembly of metal\nnanoparticles for the creation of the first isotropic optical metamaterial with\nstrong artificial magnetism in blue light. We have used colloidal self-assembly\nto create artificial \"nanomolecules\" that generate the desired magnetic\nresponse and microfluidic self-assembly to produce a bulk metastructure. We\ndemonstrate that the magnetic response of the final material is accurately\ndescribed by an isotropic magnetic permeability that satisfies the principle of\nlocality. Our approach unlocks the fabrication of large volumes of composite\nnanomaterials. Moreover, the spatial disorder inherent to this \"bottom-up\"\nmethod holds the key to solving the non-locality problem. The technique can be\nreadily extended to the future generations of low-loss optical metamaterials\nmade of dielectric nano-blocks to bypass the limitations of optical losses\nassociated with plasmonic resonances in noble metals.\n", "  We have studied the thermal stability of Quarkonia states by computing the\neffects of color-screening and vacuum screening based on a temperature\ndependent screened coulomb plus power potential for the quark-antiquark\ninteraction. Medium effects on the properties of charmonia and bottomonia\nstates are studied. The color screening and the vacuum screening effects on the\nstability of the quarkonia states are also separately calculated for\ncomparison.\n", "  When subjected to the interfacially induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction, the ground state in thin ferromagnetic films with high\nperpendicular anisotropy is cycloidal. The period of this cycloidal state\ndepends on the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In this work,\nwe have studied the effect of confinement on the magnetic ground state and\nexcited states, and we determined the phase diagram of thin strips and thin\nsquare platelets by means of micromagnetic calculations. We show that multiple\ncycloidal states with different periods can be stable in laterally confined\nfilms, where the period of the cycloids does not depend solely on the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction strength but also on the dimensions of the\nfilm. The more complex states comprising skyrmions are also found to be stable,\nthough with higher energy.\n", "  We report an experiment in which long-lived quantum memories for photonic\npolarization qubits (PPQs) are controllably released into any one of multiple\nseparate channels. The PPQs are implemented with an arbitrarily-polarized\ncoherent signal light pulses at the single-photon level and are stored in cold\natoms by means of electromagnetic-induced-transparency scheme. Reading laser\npulses propagating along the direction at a small angle relative to quantum\naxis are applied to release the stored PPQs into an output channel. By changing\nthe propagating directions of the read laser beam, we controllably release the\nretrieved PPQs into 7 different photonic output channels, respectively. At one\nof the output channels, the measured maximum quantum-process fidelity for the\nPPQs is 94.2% at storage time of t= 0.85ms. At storage time of 6 ms, the\nquantum-process fidelity is still beyond 78%, the threshold for the violation\nof the Bell inequality. The demonstrated controllable release of the stored\nPPQs may extend the capabilities of the quantum information storage technique.\n", "  A not satisfactorily solved problem of relativistic transformation of\ntemperature playing the decisive role in relativistic thermal physics and\ncosmology is reopened. It is shown that the origin of the so called\nMosengeil-Ott's antinomy and other aligned paradoxes are related to the wrong\nunderstanding of physical meaning of temperature and application of Planck's\nAnsatz of Lorentz's invariance of entropy. In the contribution we have thus\nreintroduced and anew analyzed fundamental concepts of hotness manifold, fixed\nthermometric points and temperature. Finally, on the basis of phenomenological\narguments the Lorentz invariance of temperature and relativistic\ntransformations of entropy are established.\n", "  In recent years the shperical wave expansion method has been widely applied\nto the theory and calculation of electromagnetic fields. But the inner product\nexist in reference[1] is defined on the Banach space[2]. Through redefining the\ninner product this article limits the wave expansion method to Hibert space[3].\nFor this reason the mutual energy theorem is introduced.\n", "  In a series of recent publications, different authors produce a wide range of\nelectron radii when reanalyzing electron proton scattering data. In the light\nof the proton radius puzzle, this is a most unfortunate situation. However, we\nfind flaws in most analyses that result in radii around 0.84 fm. In this paper,\nwe explain our reasoning and try to illustrate the most common pitfalls.\n", "  An asymptotically exact two-dimensional theory of elastic-piezoceramic\nsandwich shells is derived by the variational-asymptotic method. The error\nestimation of the constructed theory is given in the energetic norm. As an\napplication, analytical solution to the problem of forced vibration of a\ncircular elastic plate partially covered by two piezoceramic patches with\nthickness polarization excited by a harmonic voltage is found.\n", "  We study the dissipative dynamics of $N$ quantum spins with Lindblad\ngenerator consisting of operators scaling as fluctuations, namely with the\ninverse square-root of $N$. In the large $N$ limit, the microscopic dissipative\ntime-evolution converges to a non-Markovian unitary dynamics on strictly local\noperators, while at the mesoscopic level of fluctuations it gives rise to a\ndissipative non-Markovian dynamics. The mesoscopic time-evolution is Gaussian\nand exhibits either a stable or an unstable asymptotic character; furthermore,\nthe mesoscopic dynamics builds correlations among fluctuations that survive in\ntime even when the original microscopic dynamics is unable to correlate local\nobservables.\n", "  Electronic structure calculations carried out to estimate the free energies\nof Na(aq)+ exchange for lithium in LiM2(PO4)3 (LMP, M=Si4+,Ge4+,Ti4+,Sn4+,Zr4+)\nand Li1+xAlxM2-x(PO4)3 (LAMP; M=Ge4+,Ti4+, between 0 and 0.5) compounds in\nseawater. The calculations show that resistance to sodium-ion exchange\nincreases with decreasing cell volume. For the pure LMP compounds, only the\nhypothetical LiSi2(PO4)3 is predicted to be stable against sodium ion exchange\nin aqueous solution. The calculations indicate that increasing the extent of\nAl3+ substitution for M4+ in the LAMP compounds increases the resistance to\nexchange, and that both LAGP and LATP can be stabilized against sodium exchange\nfor x greater than or equal to approximately 0.5 Li1+xAlxM2-x(PO4)3.\n", "  When a mesoscopic conductor is coupled to a high-quality electromagnetic\ncavity the flow of charges and the flux of photons leaking out of the cavity\ncan both depend strongly on the coupled quantum dynamics of the system. Using a\nvoltage-biased Josephson junction as a model system, we demonstrate that there\nis a simple connection between the full counting statistics of the charges and\nthe photons in the long time limit. We then reveal the intimate relation\nbetween the counting statistics and the nonlinear dynamics of the system,\nuncovering novel regimes of coherent charge and photon transport associated\nwith bifurcations in the classical dynamics of the system.\n", "  This paper analyzes the relationship between initialization error and recall\nof a specific memory in the Grover algorithm for quantum database search. It is\nshown that the correct memory is obtained with high probability even when the\ninitial state is far removed from the correct one. The analysis is done by\nrelating the variance of error in the initial state to the recovery of the\ncorrect memory and the surprising result is obtained that the relationship\nbetween the two is essentially linear.\n", "  Computational skills are required across all astronomy disciplines. Many\nstudents enter degree programs without sufficient skills to solve computational\nproblems in their core classes or contribute immediately to research. We\nrecommend advocacy for computational literacy, familiarity with fundamental\nsoftware carpentry skills, and mastery of basic numerical methods by the\ncompletion of an undergraduate degree in Astronomy.\n  We recommend the AAS Education Task Force advocate for a significant increase\nin computational literacy.\n  We encourage the AAS to modestly fund efforts aimed at providing Open\nEducation Resources (OER) that will significantly impact computational literacy\nin astronomy education.\n", "  In a recent paper [arXiv:1601.02165], Tao Li claimed that a gapped\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, obtained using projected Gutzwiller fermionic wave\nfunctions, can be stabilized in the Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. We\nperform very accurate variational calculations and confirm with unprecedented\naccuracy the fact, that the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid is a local energy\nminimum that goes away with system size, thus reaffirming the scenario of a\ngapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid ground state.\n", "  Oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides facilitate catalysis critical for\nenergy storage and generation. However, it has proven elusive to promote\nvacancies at the lower temperatures required for operation in devices such as\nmetal-air batteries and portable fuel cells. Here, we use thin films of the\nperovskite-based strontium cobaltite (SrCoOx) to show that epitaxial strain is\na powerful tool towards manipulating the oxygen content under conditions\nconsistent with the oxygen evolution reaction, yielding increasingly oxygen\ndeficient states in an environment where the cobaltite would normally be fully\noxidized. The additional oxygen vacancies created through tensile strain\nenhance the cobaltite catalytic activity towards this important reaction by\nover an order of magnitude, equaling that of precious metal catalysts,\nincluding IrO2. Our findings demonstrate that strain in these oxides can\ndictate oxygen stoichiometry independent of ambient conditions, allowing\nunprecedented control over oxygen vacancies essential in catalysis near room\ntemperature.\n", "  Plenoptic imaging is a novel optical technique for three-dimensional imaging\nin a single shot. It is enabled by the simultaneous measurement of both the\nlocation and the propagation direction of light in a given scene. In the\nstandard approach, the maximum spatial and angular resolutions are inversely\nproportional, and so are the resolution and the maximum achievable depth of\nfocus of the 3D image. We have recently proposed a method to overcome such\nfundamental limits by combining plenoptic imaging with an intriguing\ncorrelation remote-imaging technique: ghost imaging. Here, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that correlation plenoptic imaging can be effectively achieved by\nexploiting the position-momentum entanglement characterizing spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon pairs. As a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration, we shall show that correlation plenoptic imaging with entangled\nphotons may enable the refocusing of an out-of-focus image at the same depth of\nfocus of a standard plenoptic device, but without sacrificing\ndiffraction-limited image resolution.\n", "  The business elite constitutes a small but strikingly influential subset of\nthe population, oftentimes affecting important societal outcomes such as the\nconsolidation of political power, the adoption of corporate governance\npractices, and the stability of national economies more broadly. Here we\nanalyze a unique dataset of all MBA students at a top 5 MBA program. After\nmatching students on all available characteristics (e.g., age, grade scores,\nindustry experience, etc.) - i.e. creating twin pairs - we find that the\ndistinguishing characteristics between students who do well in job placement\nand those who do not is their network. Further, we find that the network\ndifferences between the successful and unsuccessful students develops within\nthe first month of class and persists thereafter, suggesting a network\nimprinting that is persistent. Finally, we find that these effects are\npronounced for students who are at the extreme ends of the distribution on\nother measures of success - students with the best expected job placement do\nparticularly poorly without the right network (descenders), whereas students\nwith worst expected job placement pull themselves to the top of the placement\nhierarchy (ascenders) with the right network.\n", "  Charge density wave (CDW), the periodic modulation of the electronic charge\ndensity, will open a gap on the Fermi surface that commonly leads to decreased\nor vanishing conductivity. On the other hand superconductivity, a commonly\nbelieved competing order, features a Fermi surface gap that results in infinite\nconductivity. Here we report that superconductivity emerges upon Se doping in\nCDW conductor ZrTe$_{3}$ when the long range CDW order is gradually suppressed.\nSuperconducting critical temperature $T_c(x)$ in ZrTe$_{3-x}$Se$_x$\n(${0\\leq}x\\leq0.1$) increases up to 4 K plateau for\n$0.04$$\\leq$$x$$\\leq$$0.07$. Further increase in Se content results in\ndiminishing $T_{c}$ and filametary superconductivity. The CDW modes from Raman\nspectra are observed in $x$ = 0.04 and 0.1 crystals, where signature of\nZrTe$_{3}$ CDW order in resistivity vanishes. The electronic-scattering for\nhigh $T_{c}$ crystals is dominated by local CDW fluctuations at high\ntemperures, the resistivity is linear up to highest measured $T=300K$ and\ncontributes to substantial in-plane anisotropy.\n", "  The possibility of detecting proto-galaxies in the UV band is pointed out,\nassuming that galaxy formation occured at z $\\sim 5-6$. It is shown that the\ndiffuse gas in collapsing galaxy sized objects with temperatures $\\sim\n10^{6\\pm0.5}$ K, and with a modest amount of metallicity, should copiously\nproduce emission lines from highly ionized Iron atoms. The expected luminosity\nfrom models of galaxy formation is compared with the sensitivity of HST.\n", "  Velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, radius $R$ and luminosity $L$ of elliptical\ngalaxies are known to be related, leaving only two degrees of freedom and\ndefining the so-called ``fundamental plane\". In this {\\em Letter} we present\nobservational evidence that rich galaxy clusters exhibit a similar behaviour.\nAssuming a relation $L \\propto R^{\\alpha}\\sigma^{2 \\beta}$, the best-fit values\nof $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are very close to those defined by galaxies. The\ndispersion of this relation is lower than 10 percent, i.e. significantly\nsmaller than the dispersion observed in the $L-\\sigma$ and $L-R$ relations. We\nbriefly suggest some possible implications on the spread of formation times of\nobjects and on peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters.\n", "  We investigate the angular distribution of the $\\gamma$-ray bursts in the\npublicly available BATSE catalogue, using the measures of burst brightness $B$\nand short time scale ($\\simless$ 0.3 s) variability $V$ which we introduced\nearlier. We show that the 54 type I ($\\log V \\le -0.8$) bursts lying in the\nmiddle brightness range 490 counts $\\le B \\le$ 1250 counts (corresponding to\n1/3 of all type I bursts) exhibit a Galactic dipole moment of $\\langle \\cos\n\\theta \\rangle = 0.204 \\pm 0.079$ {\\it and} a deviation of the Galactic\nquadrupole moment from 1/3 of $\\langle \\sin^2 b \\rangle - 1/3 = -0.104 \\pm\n0.041$. Using Monte Carlo simulations which include the BATSE sky exposure map\nand taking into account division of the type I bursts into three equal samples,\nwe find that the probability by chance of an isotropic distribution of 54\nbursts exhibiting values of $\\langle \\cos \\theta \\rangle$ {\\it and} the\nnegative of $\\langle \\sin^2 b \\rangle - 1/3$ which equal or exceed the observed\nvalues is $6.6 \\times 10^{-5}$. We conclude that $\\gamma$-ray bursts are\nGalactic in origin.\n", "  We investigate clustering in the angular distribution of the 260 $\\gamma$-ray\nbursts in the publicly available BATSE catalogue, using a nearest neighbour\nanalysis and the measures of burst brightness $B$ and short time scale\nvariability $V$ which we introduced earlier. We find that while all 260 bursts\nare only modestly clustered (Q-value = $1.8 \\times 10^{-2}$), the 202 bursts in\nthis sample for which the statistical error in their locations is $<9^\\circ$\nare significantly clustered on an angular scale $\\approx 5^\\circ$ (Q-value =\n$2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$, taking into acoount having chosen the cutoff in the\nstatistical error). We also find a significant correlation between bright type\nI bursts and faint type I and type II bursts on an angular scale $\\approx\n5^\\circ$ (Q-value = $4.0 \\times 10^{-3}$). This angular scale is smaller than\nthe typical (statistical plus systematic) error in burst locations of\n$6.8^\\circ$, suggesting multiple recurrences from individual sources. We\nconclude that ``classical'' $\\gamma$-ray burst sources repeat on a time scale\nof months, and that many faint type I and II bursts come from the sources of\nbright type I bursts.\n", "  Following the discovery by Quashnock and Lamb (1993) of an apparent excess of\n$\\gamma$-ray burst pairs with small angular separations, we reanalyze the\nangular distribution of the bursts in the BATSE catalogue. We find that in\naddition to an excess of close pairs, there is also a comparable excess of\nantipodal bursts, i.e pairs of bursts separated by about 180 degrees in the\nsky. Both excesses have only modest statistical significance. We reject the\nhypothesis put forward by Quashnock and Lamb that burst sources are repeaters,\nsince it is obvious that this hypothesis does not predict an excess of\nantipodal coincidences. Lacking any physical model of bursts that can explain\nthe antipodal pairs, we suggest that the two excesses seen in the data are\neither due to an unusual statistical fluctuation or caused by some unknown\nselection effect.\n", "  It has been recently discovered that the angular autocorrelation function of\ngamma-ray bursts exhibits sharp peaks at angular separations of $\\lesssim\n4\\deg$ (Quashnock and Lamb 1993), and at $\\gtrsim 176\\deg$ (Narayan and Piran\n1993). While an excess of very close pairs of bursts can naturally arise from\nburst repetition or from a spatial correlation of the burst sources, a physical\nexplanation for an angular correlation on a scale of $\\simeq 180\\deg$ seems\ninconceivable.\n  We show that both sharp peaks in the correlation function can be explained by\na possible bias in the determination of the burst positions. A generic way is\ndescribed in which the suggested bias can be introduced into the burst\nlocalization procedure, either through instrumental imperfection or through the\nsoftware analyses. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to show that the observed\ncorrelation function can be reproduced by the suggested effect. We demonstrate\nthat the results can nicely agree with the observations even if only a fraction\nof the bursts are subject to the bias.\n  We emphasis that the only motivation for suggesting the existence of this\nbias are the features found in the angular autocorrelation function. It does\nnot rule out the possibility that bursts repeat. The natural way in which such\nbias, if it exists, explains both sharp peaks, and the various conceivable\ncauses for the origin of this bias, make the bias hypothesis worth considering.\n", "  If gamma-ray bursts originate in our Galaxy, they probably involve violent\ndisturbances in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. Any event of this kind is\nlikely to trigger the sudden expulsion of magnetic flux and plasma at\nrelativistic speed. We show that such ejecta would be braked by the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and that a gamma-ray flash with duration $\\sim 0.1 -\n100 $ s may result from this interaction. We suggest that the\nstronger,``smooth\"class of bursts, recently identified from analyses of BATSE\ndata, could result from the deceleration of such a blast wave by the ISM. The\nradiative efficiency,and hence the detectability, of such bursts would depend\non the density of the circumstellar ISM. Therefore, even if the neutron star\n``triggers\" were uniformly distributed in space (at least within 1--2 kpc of\nthe Sun), the bserved locations of bursts would correlate with regions of\nabove-average ISM density.\n", "  We discuss the influence of gravitational waves (GWs) upon the polarisation\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). We show how to compute the\n{\\em rms} temperature anisotropy and polarisation of the CMBR induced by GWs of\narbitrary wavelength. We find that the ratio of polarisation, $\\Pi$, to\nanisotropy, $A$, can be as large as $\\sim 40$\\%, but is sensitively dependent\nupon the GW spectrum and the cosmological ionisation history. We argue that\nCMBR polarisation measurements can provide useful constraints on cosmological\nmodels.\n", "  Quashnock and Lamb (1993) defined a sub-sample of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs)\nfrom the publicly available BATSE database which shows clumping toward the\ngalactic plane, and concluded that all GRBs are galactic in origin. The\nselection of these bursts (duplicated in this work in Sample 1) involved a peak\ncountrate (in counts s-1) uncorrected for aspect. We assert that the peak flux\nof a burst is physically more meaningful than peak count-rate. Using, as\nlimits, the corresponding peak fluxes (in photons cm-2 s-1) for the bursts in\nthe QL sample, we find an additional 24 bursts, which we include in a new\nsample (Sample 2). We find that the significance of anisotropy in Sample 2 is\nmuch less than that of Sample 1, which does not support QL's interpretation of\nthe anisotropies as being due to a galactic population. To make meaningful\nstatistical statements regarding isotropy, burst samples must have peak fluxes\nabove a minimum flux, set by the requirement that a burst be detectable from\nany direction (above the horizon) with respect to GRO, at any detection\nthreshold at which a burst was observed in that sample. We find that a sample\nof such bursts has a marginal (2.6 sigma) deviation from isotropy, which we\nconsider insufficient to justify the claim that GRBs are galactic in origin.\n", "  If indeed early type galaxies used up most of their gas to form stars in a\ntime short compared to their collapse time and if a roughly constant fraction\nof metals is locked up in dust grains, these galaxies may easily become opaque\nto starlight and emit most of their luminosity in the far-IR. The corresponding\nspectral energy distribution matches remarkably well the observed continuum\nspectrum of the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS F$10214+4724$ from UV to sub-mm\nwavelengths, i.e. over almost four decades in frequency, for a galactic age\n$\\lsim 1\\,$Gyr. The bolometric luminosity in this model is $\\simeq 2.7\\times\n10^{14}\\Lsol$ ($H_0 =50\\,\\hbox{km}\\,\\hbox{s}^{-1} \\,\\hbox{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\\Omega\n=1$), i.e. somewhat lower than implied by previous models. In the present\nframework, the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is expected to decrease by a\nfactor $\\gsim 30$ during the subsequent evolution.\n", "  The measurements of the possible gravitational microlensing events are\nanalysed with a simple yet accurate disc--halo model of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nThis comprises a luminous exponential disc embedded in a flattened dark matter\nhalo with density varying like ${\\rm distance}^{-1.8}$. Including a disc has\nthe important effect of lowering the implied masses of the dark matter objects.\nFor the possible detection reported by Alcock et al (1993), the inferred mass\nof the lens lies in the range $\\sim 0.01 - 0.15 M_\\odot$. The candidate events\nof Aubourg et al (1993) have slightly larger implied masses of $\\sim 0.025 -\n0.35\\ M_\\odot$ and $\\sim 0.03 - 0.45\\ M_\\odot$ respectively. These are\nconsistent with the deflecters being either brown dwarfs or low mass stars. If\nthere is no disc dark matter and the halo is completely composed of baryonic\ndark objects of typical mass $ \\sim 0.08\\ M_\\odot$, then the monitoring of $1.8\n\\times 10^6$ stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud will provide at least $8-9$\ndetections a year, in the limit of $100 \\%$ efficiency.\n", "  Sudden collapse of a compact object, or coalescence of a compact binary, can\ngenerate an unsteady relativistic wind that lasts for a few seconds. The wind\nis likely to carry a high magnetic field; and its Lorentz factor depends on the\nextent to which it is 'loaded' with baryons. If the Lorentz factor is $\\sim\n100$, internal dissipation and shocks in this wind produce a non-thermal\ngamma-ray burst, detectable in the range $0.1\\MeV \\siml E_\\gamma \\siml\n0.1-1\\GeV$ out to cosmological distances. The cooled wind ejecta would\nsubsequently be decelerated by the external medium. The resultant blast wave\nand reverse shock can then give rise to a second burst component, mainly\ndetectable in the GeV range, with a time delay relative to the MeV burst\nranging from minutes to hours.\n", "  Two groups have independently reported the possible detection of\nextragalactic deuterium in the absorption spectrum of the same high redshift,\nlow metalicity QSO. Although the high value for the inferred deuterium\nabundance poses no problems for cosmology (i.e., big bang nucleosynthesis), it\nis in apparent conflict with solar system observations of deuterium and\nhelium-3. This latter inconsistency is explained and made quantitative and it\nis shown that, unless the inferred D/H ratio is too high by a factor of three,\nthese data challange our understanding of the stellar and galactic evolution of\nhelium-3. This conflict is resolved if the observed absorption feature is, in\nfact, due to a hydrogen interloper rather than to high z, low Z deuterium.\n", "  Motivated by recent observation of Lanzetta et al. that most luminous\ngalaxies at low redshifts produce $\\lya$ absorption at impact parameter $l\\lsim\n160 \\kpch$, we propose that these absorbers are clouds confined by the pressure\nof ambient hot gas in galactic haloes. We determine the properties of this hot\ngas and of the absorption systems on the basis of observational and theoretical\nconstraints. The absorbing clouds need to be replenished on about one orbital\ntime ($\\sim 10^9$ yrs) in the galactic halo. The pressure and temperature of\nthe gas at radius $r\\sim 100\\kpc$ are $P=(10-100){\\rm cm^{-3} K}$,\n$T=10^{(5.5-6.5)}{\\rm K}$. The model requires that about 10 per cent of the gas\nin low-redshift galactic haloes is in the hot phase. Such gas in galactic\nhaloes emits x-ray with bolometric luminosity of the order $10^{37-40}{\\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}}$. The plausibility for such gas to exist in current models of\ngalaxy formation is discussed.\n", "  We present new estimates of the spatial two-point correlation function of\nrich clusters of galaxies selected from the APM Galaxy Survey. We have measured\nredshifts for a sample of $364$ clusters out to a depth of $\\sim 450\\hmpc$. The\nclusters have a mean space density of $\\bar{n} = 3.4\\times 10^{-5}\\hmpccc$. The\ntwo-point correlation function, $\\xi_{cc}$, for this sample is equal to unity\nat a pair-separation of $r_0 = 14.3\\pm1.75\\hmpc$ (2$\\sigma$ errors), consistent\nwith our earlier results from a smaller sample. The new observations provide an\naccurate determination of the shape of $\\xi_{cc}$ to pair-separations of about\n$50\\hmpc$. Our results show that $\\xi_{cc}$ has a higher amplitude than\nexpected according to the standard $\\Omega=1$ cold dark matter (CDM) model on\nspatial scales $2\\simlt s \\simlt 50\\hmpc$, but are in good agreement with\nscale-invariant fluctuations in either a low density CDM model or a critical\ndensity universe made up of a mixture of hot and cold dark matter. Our results\nprovide strong constraints on so called `co-operative' models of galaxy\nformation in which the galaxy formation process introduces large-scale\nstructure in the galaxy distribution.\n", "  We present a comparison of the predictions of perturbation theory for the\nhierarchical J-order correlation amplitudes $S_J=\\xibar_J/\\xibar_2^{J-1}$,\n$J=3-10$, with the results of large numerical simulations of gravitational\nclustering. We consider two different initial power spectra of density\nfluctuations, one being flatter than the other. The clustering amplitudes $S_J$\nmeasured in these models are different at all scales. In each case, the\nperturbation theory predictions give an excellent agreement with the\nsimulations on scales for which the variance is approximately linear, i.e. for\nscales on which $\\xibar_2 \\simlt 1$. For cells of radius $R \\simgt 30 \\Mpc$,\nthe sampling variance arising from the finite size of our simulations dominates\nthe results. We also find that $S_J$ are roughly independent of time, $\\Omega$,\nor $\\lambda$, as expected. On comparing with the observations, one can use\nthese results to discriminate between models for structure formation.\n", "  Recent claims in the literature (Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto 1994) that the\nepoch describing the onset of galactic winds in spheroidal star systems has\nbeen severely overestimated in the past, due to the neglect of energy deposited\nin the interstellar medium from stellar winds, is evaluated in the light of a\nmore conservative approach to modeling the input of thermal energy to the\nsystem from massive stars undergoing mass loss. Applying the most recent models\nof stellar kinetic energy deposition, coupled with reasonable assumptions\nregarding the efficiency of thermalisation, it is shown that contrary to the\naforementioned study, the influence of stellar winds in driving the galactic\nwinds in ellipticals of mass M_G>1e9 M_Sun is most likely negligible.\n", "  The prospects for detection of gravitational waves from precessing pulsars\nhave been considered by constructing fully relativistic rotating neutron star\nmodels and evaluating the expected wave amplitude $h$ from a galactic source.\nFor a \"typical\" neutron matter equation of state and observed rotation rates,\nit is shown that moderate wobble angles may render an observable signal from a\nnearby source once the present generation of interferometric antennas becomes\noperative.\n", "  Hamilton et al. (1991) proposed a simple formula relating the nonlinear\nautocorrelation function of the mass distribution to the primordial spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations for gravitational clustering in an $\\Omega=1$ universe.\nHigh resolution N-body simulations show this formula to work well for\nscale-free spectra $P(k) \\propto k^n$ when the spectral index $n\\sim 0$, but\nnot when $n \\lsim -1$. We show that a modified version of the formula can work\nwell provided its form depends on $n$. This dependence can be derived from a\nsimple physical model for collapse from Gaussian initial conditions. Our\nmodified formula is easy to apply and is an excellent fit to N-body simulations\nwith $0 \\leq n \\leq -2$. It can also be applied to non-power law initial\nspectra such as that of the standard Cold Dark Matter model by using the local\nspectral index at the current nonlinear scale as the effective value of $n$ at\nany given redshift. We give analytic expressions both for the nonlinear\ncorrelation function and for the nonlinear power spectrum.\n", "  The white dwarf luminosity function of a stellar cluster will have a sharp\ntruncation at a luminosity which is determined by the time since formation of\nthe first white dwarfs in that cluster. Calculation of the dependence of this\nlimiting luminosity on age requires relatively well-understood physics and is\nindependent of stellar evolutionary models. Thus, measurement of the\ntermination of the white dwarf luminosity function provides an independent\nmethod to determine the age of a cluster, and thereby to calibrate stellar\nevolutionary ages. We have obtained HST WFPC2 data in two open clusters,\nidentified the white dwarf sequence, and proved the feasibility of this\napproach, by detecting white dwarfs to V=25. Much deeper data are feasible.\nFrom our present limited data, we show that degenerate cooling ages are not\nconsistent with some published isochrone ages for clusters with ages of order\n1Gyr.\n", "  We present the B band Tully-Fisher relation for Low Surface Brightness (LSB)\ngalaxies. These LSB galaxies follow the same Tully-Fisher relation as normal\nspiral galaxies. This implies that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of LSB\ngalaxies is typically a factor of 2 larger than that of normal galaxies of the\nsame total luminosity and morphological type. Since the dynamical mass of a\ngalaxy is related to the rotation velocity and scale length via M \\propto V^2\nh, at fixed linewidth LSB galaxies must be twice as large as normal galaxies.\nThis is confirmed by examining the relation between scale length and linewidth\nfor LSB and normal galaxies. The universal nature of the Tully-Fisher relation\ncan be understood if LSB galaxies are galaxies with low mass surface density,\n\\sigma. The mass surface density apparently controls the luminosity evolution\nof a galaxy such as to keep the product \\sigma M/L constant.\n", "  Zwicky 159.034, one of the Seyfert galaxies identified with EUV sources\ndetected during the ROSAT Wide Field Camera (WFC) all-sky survey, has unusual\nproperties. The ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) 0.1--2.5\nkeV X-ray spectrum, obtained simultaneously with the WFC survey, appears\nextremely steep. Subsequent deeper pointed observations with ROSAT revealed\nthat its 0.1--2.5 keV count rate had decreased by an extremely large amount (a\nfactor of about 70). This is comparable to the variability amplitude seen in\nanother ultrasoft Seyfert, E1615+061. There appears to be about 10 times as\nmuch flux in the soft component as in any expected hard tail suggesting that,\nin the absence of partial covering of the hard flux, the soft flux cannot arise\nvia reprocessing of the hard tail. Its peculiar optical spectrum has permitted\nlines with widths about 1200--1500 km s^{-1}, and forbidden lines are weak or\nabsent. Its optical spectrum shows evidence for variability, and might be used\nto study the role reprocessed X-rays play in the formation of optical lines.\n", "  We report the discovery of a radio loud quasar with a redshift of 4.30. This\nobject, which is the first radio selected quasar with a redshift greater than\nfour, was discovered during an observational investigation into the evolution\nof the luminosity function of radio loud quasars. Here we describe results\nbased on a sample of ~300, flat spectrum radio sources with S(5GHz) > 200mJy.\nIn this study, rather than carry out an indiscriminate redshift campaign on all\nthe radio sources, we have used the APM POSS catalogue to preselect a subset of\nstellar-like optical counterparts with red optical colours. Such a subsample is\nexpected to contain a high fraction of high redshift quasars. 10 of the ~300\nsources were selected for follow-up optical spectroscopy and three of these are\nidentified as quasars with redshifts greater than 3.0. One of the radio\nsources, GB1508+5714, is a quasar with z=4.30 and m(R)~19.\n", "  We report the first detection of a hard power-law tail in the X-ray spectrum\nof the black hole candidate (BHC) binary X1755-338, which was observed in 1989\nMarch-September during the TTM Galactic Centre survey. In addition, an\nultrasoft thermal component with a temperature of ~1.1-1.4 keV was also\ndetected. We demonstrate that the soft and hard X-ray components of X1755-338\nvary independently, as in the spectra of the well known BHCs LMC X-1, LMC X-3\nand GX339-4 in their high (intensity) state. If the hard tail observed from\nX1755-338 is generated near the black hole by energetic electrons up-scattering\nlow energy photons, the un-correlated variations imply that the soft X-rays\nfrom accretion disc may not be the main photon seeds needed for inverse\nComptonization. The TTM observations strongly suggest that X1755-338 does\nindeed belong to the family of BHCs.\n", "  By analysing and modelling the change in the abundance ratio of\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O on the surface of the lower mass star\nof a binary during the common-envelope (CE) phase of evolution, we propose a\nsimple observational test of the CE scenario. The test is based on the infrared\nmeasurement of either the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C or $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratio of red\ndwarfs in post-common envelope binaries (PCEB's). In certain cases\n(main-sequence red dwarf secondaries in PCEB's without planetary nebulae), as\nwell as determining whether or not accretion has occurred during the CE phase,\nwe can determine the amount of mass accreted during the CE phase and hence the\ninitial mass of the red dwarf component prior to the CE phase. In the other\ncases considered (low-mass red dwarfs in PCEB's and red dwarf's in PCEB's with\nplanetary nebulae) we can only say whether or not accretion has occurred during\nthe CE phase.\n", "  We use numerical simulations to test the feasibility of the suggestion by\nIbata et al. (1994) that the excess population of stars which they discovered\nin the Sagittarius region may be the disrupted remains of a dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy. We find that a Fornax-like model for the pre-disruption system can\nindeed reproduce the data. However, the galaxy must be on a relatively short\nperiod orbit with a pericentre of about $10$ kpc and an apocentre of about $52$\nkpc, giving a current transverse velocity of $255$ km/s and a period of $\\sim\n760$ Myr. Furthermore, disruption must have occurred predominantly on the last\npericentric passage rather than on the present one. The data are consistent\nwith transverse motion either towards or away from the Galactic Plane. These\nresults depend primarily on the rotation curve of the Galaxy and are\ninsensitive to the mass distribution in its outer halo or to the mass of its\ndisk.\n", "  Unidentified extreme UV sources, detected in the {\\it EUVE} and {\\it ROSAT}\nWFC all-sky surveys, could be isolated old neutron stars, accreting material\nfrom the ISM. The closest neutron stars, that are located in the local ISM\nbubble of unusually low density, are faint and cool ($L \\sim 10^{27} {\\rm \\ erg\n\\ s^{-1}}$, $T \\sles 6 $eV). The extreme UV spectrum of these sources is very\nsensitive to the H I column density, since large fraction of the emission is\nemitted just below the hydrogen Lyman edge. The {\\it EUVE} sources with large\ncount rate in the long-wave bandpass (600\\AA) seem to be the most promising\ncandidates. These sources should have low H I column density ($N_{HI} \\sles\n10^{18} {\\rm \\ cm^{-2}}$), constraining their distance to a few tens of parsec.\nOtherwise, their spectra would be significantly modified by ISM absorption,\ninevitably become stronger in the short wavelength (100\\AA, 200\\AA) {\\it EUVE}\nbandpasses. If these unidentified objects are familiar EUV sources rather than\nneutron stars, either white dwarfs, late type stars or cataclysmic variables,\nthey are expected to be identifiable, generally brighter than $\\sim 14$.\n", "  The excess numbers of blue galaxies at faint magnitudes are a long-standing\ncosmological puzzle. We present new number-magnitude counts as a function of\ngalactic morphology from the first deep fields of the Cycle 4 Hubble Space\nTelescope {\\it Medium Deep Survey} project. From a sample of 301 galaxies we\ndefine counts for elliptical, spiral and irregular/peculiar galaxies to $I=22$.\nWe find two principal results. Firstly the elliptical and spiral galaxy counts\nboth follow the predictions of high-normalisation no-evolution models at all\nmagnitudes, indicating that regular Hubble types evolve only slowly to $z\\sim\n0.5$. Secondly we find that irregular/peculiar galaxies, including\nmultiple-peaked, possibly merging, objects, have a very steep number-magnitude\nrelation and greatly exceed predictions based on proportions in local surveys.\nThese systems make up half the total counts by $I=22$ and imply the\nrapidly-evolving component of the faint galaxy population has been identified.\n", "  It is shown that the average magnitude - redshift diagram for a\nmagnitude-limited sample of galaxies can be effectively used for mapping galaxy\nvelocity field. This new approach is quantitatively introduced and applied to\nthe CfA, ESO/LV and ZCAT samples of galaxies. Strong arguments are presented\nfor infall velocities in the Virgo and Fornax superclusters and in the Great\nWall structure.\n", "  We have found that the white dwarf PG 1101+364 is a double-lined white\ndwarf/white dwarf binary with an orbital period of 3.47 hours. PG 1101+364 is\nthe shortest period detached double-degenerate yet found and gravitational\nradiation will cause it to merge in 2.5 X 10**9 years. PG 1101+364 has a mass\nratio of 0.87 +/- 0.03. From the relative strengths of the narrow core of\nHalpha, the lighter and therefore larger star appears to contribute more of the\nlight by an amount that indicates almost equal temperatures for the two stars.\nWe chose to observe PG 1101+364 on the basis of its low spectroscopic mass\n(0.31 Msun), and the discovery of its binary nature confirms the belief that\nbinary evolution is required to produce such low mass white dwarfs. The radial\nvelocity semi-amplitudes (69.7 +/- 1.7 km/s and 80.3 +/- 1.6 km/s) and the\nspectroscopic mass show that we see the orbit of PG 1101+364 at a low\ninclination of ~ 25 deg.\n", "  Estimates of Omega_baryon from primordial nucleosynthesis together with\nstandard assumptions about the ionization state of low column density Lyman\nalpha forest clouds can be used to determine an upper limit for the cloud\nthickness along the line of sight. This upper limit provides significant\nconstraints on the axis ratio of the absorbers and on the overall fraction of\nthe baryonic matter contained in these objects if the recently measured large\nvalues for their transversal size are representative. The absorbers have to be\nconsiderably flattened structures and may possibly contain a substantial\nfraction of the baryonic matter at high redshift.\n", "  Based on an R-band imaging survey of 6 high redshift (z~2) and high\nluminosity (M<-28mag) QSOs, we report the detection of extensions in two\nradio-quiet and one radio-loud QSO. The extensions are most likely due to the\nhost galaxies of these QSOs, with luminosities of at least 3-7 per cent of the\nQSO luminosity. The most likely values for the luminosity of the host galaxies\nlie in the range $6-18 per cent of the QSO luminosity.\n", "  A ROSAT HRI image of the hyperluminous infrared galaxy IRAS P09104+4109 shows\nextended X-ray emission peaked around the central galaxy in a profile\ncharacteristic of a cooling flow. The inferred soft X-ray luminosity is\ncomparable to that detected with ASCA. The ASCA spectrum is well fit by a\ncooling flow spectrum, indicating a mass cooling rate of about 1000 Msunpyr.\nThe cooling flow dominates the total luminosity of the surrounding cluster. Any\ncontribution from a hidden AGN in the host galaxy to either the total ASCA\nspectrum or the HRI image is small.\n", "  A search for millimetric continuum emission from eight optically-selected,\nradio-quiet quasars and a radiogalaxy with 3.7 < z < 4.3, has been undertaken\nusing a highly sensitive 7-channel bolometer on the IRAM 30-m Millimetre Radio\nTelescope. Detections of a potentially dust-rich quasar, and of 8C1435+635, the\nmost distant known radiogalaxy, are reported. An extrapolation of the\nsteepening centimetric radio spectrum of 8C1435+635 accounts for less than one\nper cent of the observed 1.25-mm flux density, indicating that the emission is\nmost likely from warm dust, although the present data cannot discriminate\nagainst synchrotron emission. If the emission is thermal, then the derived dust\nmass lies in the range, 2E9 < M(dust) < 8E7 Solar for 20 < T(dust) < 100K, or\nM(dust) ~ 1.6E8 Solar for T(dust) = 60K, similar to that derived for 4C41.17,\nsuggesting a molecular gas mass of between 4E10 and 9E11 Solar. The quasar,\nPC2047+0123 at z=3.80, has no detectable centimetric emission and the 1.25-mm\ncontinuum detected here probably also originates from ~ 1.5E8 Solar masses of\ndust (again for T(dust) = 60K). Upper limits have been obtained for four\nquasars, corresponding to dust mass limits of around 3 sigma < 2E8 Solar; less\nuseful limits have been set for a further three quasars.\n", "  We present high-resolution CCD images (FWHM=0.6\"-0.7\") of the compact\ngravitational lens system B0218+35.7 obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope.\nUsing aperture and PSF photometry we detect the two closely separated (335 mas)\ncomponents A and B as well as the lensing galaxy. In the optical B seems to be\nvery much brighter than A, opposite to the radio morphology. This suggests that\nmost of the light from A is absorbed in the lensing galaxy, possibly by a giant\nmolecular cloud located in the line-of-sight to component A. The lensing galaxy\nappears to be a late-type galaxy at a small inclination. For future variability\nstudies we present calibrated photometry of the system and its immediate\nsurroundings, even though the relative faintness of A will make it difficult to\nobtain an optical time delay even with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n", "  The extreme bolometric luminosity of IRAS F10214+4724, and in particular the\nhuge mass in molecular gas inferred from the CO line fluxes have led to\nsuggestions that this is a giant galaxy in the process of formation. An\narc-like structure and the closeness of a second object suggest, however, that\ngravitational lensing may be responsible for its anomalously high luminosity\nand mass. In this paper, we use an optical spectrum taken in conditions of\n0.7-arcsec seeing to provide further evidence that F10214+4724 is a\ngravitationally lensed system. We measure tentative redshifts of 0.896 and\n0.899 for galaxies projected $\\approx 1$ and $\\approx 3$ arcsec from IRAS\nF10214+4724 respectively. Identifying the former as the lensing galaxy we\nobtain a mass:light ratio consistent with those derived for other lenses, and\nfind that its luminosity is consistent with the velocity dispersion deduced\nfrom the radius of the Einstein ring. If lensed, our models suggest\nmagnification by a factor $\\sim 10$, and hence an intrinsic bolometric\nluminosity for F10214+4724 similar to local ULIRGs.\n", "  We estimate the three-dimensional power spectrum of IRAS galaxies from the\nQDOT and $1.2$Jy redshift surveys. We use identical estimators for both surveys\nand show how the results depend on the weights assigned to the galaxies. The\npower spectrum for the QDOT survey is steeper and has a higher amplitude at\nwavenumbers $k \\sim 0.05\\; h {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (where $h$ is Hubble's constant in\nunits of $100 \\kmsmpc$) than the power spectrum derived from the $1.2$Jy\nsample. However, the QDOT power spectrum is sensitive to a small number of\ngalaxies in the Hercules supercluster, in agreement with a recent analysis of\ngalaxy counts in cells in these surveys. We argue that the QDOT results are an\nupward fluctuation. We combine the two surveys to derive our best estimate of\nthe power spectrum of IRAS galaxies. This is shallower and has a lower\namplitude on scales $\\simlt 0.1 h {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ than the power spectrum\nderived by Feldman \\et (1994) from the QDOT survey alone. The power spectrum of\nthe combined surveys is well described by the linear theory power spectrum of a\nscale-invariant cold dark matter model with $\\Omega h = 0.2$.\n", "  The X-ray spectrum obtained by Tanaka et al from a long observation of the\nactive galaxy MCG$-6-30-15$ shows a broad iron K$\\alpha$ line skewed to low\nenergies. The simplest interpretation of the shape of the line is that it is\ndue to doppler and gravitational redshifts from the inner parts of a disk about\na massive black hole. Similarly broad lines are evident in shorter observations\nof several other active galaxies. In this paper we investigate other line\nbroadening and skewing mechanisms such as Comptonization in cold gas and\ndoppler shifts from outflows. We have also fitted complex spectral models to\nthe data of MCG$-6-30-15$ to see whether the broad skewed line can be mimicked\nwell by other absorption or emission features. No satisfactory mechanism or\nspectral model is found, thus strengthening the relativistic disk line model.\n", "  Under four assumptions such that 1) Einstein's theory of gravity is correct,\n2) existence of foliation by geodesic slicing, 3) the trace of the extrinsic\ncurvature, $K$, is negative at the present time in observed region, that is,\nthe observed universe is now expanding, 4) the strong energy condition is\nsatisfied, we show that $H_{v0} t_{0} \\leq 1$, where $H_v \\equiv - K/3$ agrees\nwith the Hubble parameter in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe,\nand $t_0$ is the age of the Universe. If $H_{v0} t_0 > 1$ is confirmed\nobservationally, at least one of the four assumptions is incorrect.\n", "  The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model has an elegant simplicitly which makes it\nvery predictive, but when its parameters are fixed at their `canonical' values\nits predictions are in conflict with observational data. There is, however,\nmuch leeway in the initial conditions within the CDM framework. We advocate a\nre-examination of the CDM model, taking into account modest variation of\nparameters from their canonical values. We find that CDM models with\n$n=0.8$--0.9 and $h=0.45$--0.50 can fit the available data. Our ``best fit''\nCDM model has $n=0.9$, $h=0.45$ and $C_2^{T}/C_2^{S}=0.7$. We discuss the\ncurrent state of observations which could definitely rule out this model.\n", "  Using a spectrum obtained under moderate (of order 1 arcsecond) seeing, we\nshow that the double nucleus in M31 produces a strong kinematic signature even\nthough the individual components are not spatially resolved. The signature\nconsists of a significant asymmetric wing in the stellar velocity distribution\nclose to the center of the system. The properties of the second nucleus derived\nfrom this analysis agree closely with those measured from high-spatial\nresolution Hubble Space Telescope images. Even Space Telescope only has\nsufficient resolution to study the structure of very nearby galactic nuclei\nphotometrically; this spectroscopic approach offers a tool for detecting\nstructure such as multiple nuclei in a wider sample of galaxy cores.\n", "  We examine the implications of a beat frequency modulated model of T Tauri\naccretion. In particular we show that measurements of the variability of\naccretion generated lines can be used in conjunction with existing photometry\nto obtain a measurement of the underlying photospheric and disc flux. This\nprovides an independent way of checking spectral energy distribution modelling.\nIn addition, we show how spectroscopy of T Tauri stars can reveal the\ninclination angle between the magnetic axis and the plane of the disc.\n", "  The gravitational clustering of collisionless particles in an expanding\nuniverse is modelled using some simple physical ideas. I show that it is indeed\npossible to understand the nonlinear clustering in terms of three well defined\nregimes: (1) linear regime (2) quasilinear regime which is dominated by\nscale-invariant radial infall and (3) nonlinear regime dominated by nonradial\nmotions and mergers. Modelling each of these regimes separately I show how the\nnonlinear two point correlation function can be related to the linear\ncorrelation function in heirarchical models. This analysis leads to results\nwhich are in good agreement with numerical simulations thereby providing an\nexplanation for numerical results. The ideas presented here will also serve as\na powerful anlytical tool to investigate nonlinear clustering in different\nmodels. Several implications of the result are discussed.\n", "  Most large elliptical galaxies should now host a massive black hole leftover\nfrom an earlier quasar phase. Such galaxies also have an extensive hot gaseous\nhalo. Here we consider why the nuclei of elliptical galaxies are not luminous\nsources due to the accretion of the hot gas by the central black hole, yet have\nweak radio sources. In particular we suggest that accretion from the hot medium\nhas low radiative efficiency and forms a hot ion torus surrounding the black\nhole. Synchrotron emission from the torus can account for at least part of the\nweak radio sources commonly seen in otherwise normal elliptical galaxies. The\ninner funnel of the ion torus can also begin the collimation of a narrow jet.\nWe speculate on the difference between jets from the nuclei of spiral and\nelliptical galaxies and suggest that the extensive hot atmosphere seen in\nellipticals is essential for maintaining the collimation and provoking the\nobserved radio structures of radio galaxies. We also note that low radiative\nefficiency, and not necessarity a large change in accretion rate, may be\nresponsible for the demise of quasars and may contribute to the hard X-ray\nBackground. Hot ion tori may be common in galactic nuclei.\n", "  It has been argued that a UV photoionizing background radiation field\nsuppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies, and may even inhibit the formation\nof larger galaxies. In order to test this, we present gas-dynamical simulations\nof the formation of small objects in a CDM universe with and without a\nphotoionizing background. The objects are selected from a collisionless\nsimulation at a redshift of 2.4, and rerun at higher resolution including the\neffects of gas dynamics and using a hierarchical grid of particles. Five\nobjects, each with a circular speed of 46 km/sec are simulated. The presence of\nthe photoionizing background has only a small effect on the amount of gas that\ncollapses in these objects, reducing the amount of cold collapsed gas by at\nmost 30%. Analysis of the smaller objects found in the higher resolution\nsimulation indicates that the photoionizing background only significantly\naffects the formation of objects with a virialized halo mass less than 10^9\nsoalr masses and circular speeds less than 23 km/sec. However, the ionization\nbalance is greatly changed by the presence of the background radiation field.\nTypical lines of sight through the objects have 4 orders of magnitude less\nneutral hydrogen column density when the photoionizing background is included.\n", "  Disk-halo models of the Galaxy and LMC are constructed and used to analyse\nthe microlensing data-set. Deflectors in the LMC bar, disk and halo provide an\noptical depth to microlensing of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-7}$. Deflectors in the\nGalactic disk and halo contribute $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-7}$. The extent,\nflattening and velocity anisotropy of the dark objects in the Galactic halo are\nunknown. So, it is crucial to analyse the microlensing data-set with families\nof models that span the viable ranges of these structural parameters. Also\nuncertain is the contribution of the Galactic disk to the local circular speed,\nwhich affects the normalisation and size of the Galactic halo. Despite all the\nunknowns, a robust conclusion is that the Galactic and LMC haloes cannot be\nprimarily built from objects in the mass range $10^{-7} \\, \\msun$ - $0.1 \\,\n\\msun$. By contrast, calculations of the baryon mass fraction of the Galactic\nand LMC haloes are very sensitive to details of the adopted models. This\nparameter is not constrained by the existing data-set. In particular, it is\nstill possible for the halo to be entirely baryonic and composed of high mass\ncompact objects, like $10^6\\, \\msun$ clusters or black holes.\n", "  We examine the anisotropies in the power spectrum by the mapping of real to\nredshift space. Using the Zel'dovich approximation, we obtain an analytic\nexpression for the nonlinear redshift space power spectrum in the distant\nobserver limit. For a given unbiased galaxy distribution in redshift space, the\nanisotropies in the power spectrum depend on the parameter $f(\\Omega)\\approx\n\\Omega^{0.6}$, where $\\Omega$ is the density parameter. We quantify these\nanisotropies by the ratio, $R$, of the quadrupole to monopole angular moments\nof the power spectrum. In contrast to linear theory, the Zel'dovich\napproximation predicts a decline in $R$ with decreasing scale. This departure\nfrom linear theory is due to nonlinear dynamics and not a result of incoherent\nrandom velocities. The rate of decline depends strongly on $\\Omega$ and the\ninitial power spectrum. However, we find a {\\it universal} relation between the\nquantity $R/R_{lin}$ (where $R_{lin}$ the linear theory value of $R$) and the\ndimensionless variable $k/k_{nl}$, where $k_{nl}$ is a wavenumber determined by\nthe scale of nonlinear structures. The universal relation is in good agreement\nwith a large N-body simulation. This universal relation greatly extends the\nscales over which redshift distortions can be used as a probe of $\\Omega$. A\npreliminary application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS yields $\\Omega\\sim 0.4$ if IRAS\ngalaxies are unbiased.\n", "  I consider the possibility that Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays are accelerated\nin Gamma Ray Bursts located in the Galactic corona, thus circumventing the\nproblem raised by Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuz'min cutoff. The acceleration of UHECRs\ncould occur in the pulsars which, in the coronal GRB model, produce them: the\nsame parameters that permit fitting GRBs' observations in the model of\nPodsiadlowski, Rees and Ruderman (1995) lead to an estimate of the highest\nachievable energies corresponding to that of the Bird et al (1994) event, and\nto very low luminosities in cosmic rays. I show that, if the observations of\nMilgrom and Usov (1995a) are confirmed, the extragalactic GRBs' model for the\nacceleration of UHECRs is untenable, but the same constraint does not apply to\nthe coronal model. Also, I show that the efficiency of particle acceleration\nneeds be much smaller (and less demanding) than in cosmological models of GRBs.\nUncertainties remain about the ensuing cosmic ray spectral distribution. I also\nbriefly discuss observational strategies to distinguish between the two\npossibilities.\n", "  We show that outside-in disc instabilities, which can produce rapid-\\null\nrise FU Orionis outbursts in T~Tauri systems, are a natural consequence of the\nexistence of protoplanetary protostellar companions. The \\pcomp{} would be\nformed through gravitational instability on a dynamical timescale ($\\sim\n10^5\\y$), and provided it was formed at less than a few \\AU{}, it would be\nswept in to $\\sim15\\Rsun$ in less than $10^5\\y$. A companion of mass\n$10^{-2}$\\Msun at this radius would act as a flood gate which stores material\nupstream and periodically releases it following the ignition of the thermal\nionisation instability.\n", "  We have measured the topology (genus) of the fluctuations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background seen in the recently completed (four-year) data set\nproduced by the COBE satellite. We find that the genus is consistent with that\nexpected from a random-phase Gaussian distribution, as might be produced\nnaturally in inflationary models.\n", "  We compare the accuracy of published formulae that transform the linear\nperturbation theory power spectrum into the nonlinear regime against the\nresults of an ensemble of large N-body simulations. We find that the modified\ntransformation given by Jain, Mo and White (1995) performs well for initial\nfluctuations that have a power law power spectrum, but is less succesful for\nscale dependent spectra. The inverse transformation to obtain the linear power\nspectrum is applied to the APM Galaxy Survey power spectrum measured by Baugh\n\\& Efstathiou (1993). The resulting linear spectrum is used to generate the\ninitial density fluctuations in an N-body simulation, which is evolved to match\nthe measured APM amplitude on large scales. We find very good agreement between\nthe final power spectrum of the simulation and the measured APM power spectrum.\nHowever, the higher moments for the particle distribution only match the ones\nrecovered from the APM Survey on large scales, $R \\simgt 10 \\mpc$. On small\nscales, $R \\simlt 10 \\mpc$, the APM estimations give smaller amplitudes,\nindicating that non-gravitational effects, such as biasing, are important on\nthose scales. Our approach can be used to constrain a model of how light from\ngalaxies traces the underlying mass distribution.\n", "  We have obtained with the SUSI CCD camera on the ESO 3.5m NTT deep images in\nthe BVRI bands of the field centered on the QSO BRI 1202-0725 ($z_{\\it\nem}=4.694$). In the final combined frames the stellar images have FWHM of\n1,1,0.6 and 0.65 arcsec respectively. The R and I images show clearly a galaxy\n$2.2''$ from the QSO, corresponding to $13h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc at $z\\sim 4.5$.\nPossible identification with the metal absorption systems seen in the line of\nsight to the QSO, including the highest redshift damped system known to date at\n$z=4.383$, are discussed. We conclude that its colours can be reconciled only\nwith the spectrum of a primeval galaxy at z >~ 4.4, making it the most distant\ngalaxy detected so far. From its magnitudes and models of young galaxy\nevolution we deduce that it is forming stars at a rate $\\sim 30 M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ and has an estimated age of the order of $10^8$ yr or less, implying\nthat the bulk of the stellar population formed at $z < 6$.\n", "  The double QSO2345+007 comprises two optical components separated by 7.1\\\narcseconds and is the most prominent `dark matter' gravitational lens\ncandidate. Despite being known for more than a decade, optical spectroscopy and\nimaging have been unable to determine whether this double QSO is a binary QSO\nor a gravitational lens system. In this note we report a deep VLA observation\nof this system, yielding a map with a noise level of 8.5\\ts $\\mu$Jy per beam.\nWe have a $4\\sigma$ detection of a radio source within one arcsecond of the\noptical position of the brighter A-component of the QSO, but no significant\ndetection of any radio counterpart of the B component. Given that the flux\nratio in the optical waveband is $\\sim$3--4, the gravitational lens hypothesis\nfor this system would predict a radio flux of image B of $\\lesssim 10$\\ts\n$\\mu$Jy. The non-detection of the B component is thus consistent with, but does\nnot prove, the lens interpretation.\n", "  We propose that the UV/X-ray correlation observed in NGC 4151 by EXOSAT and\nIUE is due to reemission of the X-ray flux absorbed by cold clouds in the line\nof sight. This transmission model satisfies the energy balance, provides a good\nfit to the X-ray and UV data, and predicts no Compton reflection of X-rays (as\nobserved). The correlation can alternatively be explained by reprocessing of\nX-rays and gamma-rays by a cold accretion disk. A specific model in which\nX-rays and gamma-rays are emitted by a dissipative patchy corona and have the\nspectrum cut off at about 100 keV (as seen by OSSE) is shown to be\nenergetically possible even if it does not give as satisfactory a fit as the\ntransmission model. However, the model predicts a Compton- reflection spectral\ncomponent, whose presence remains to be tested by future detectors sensitive\nabove 10 keV.\n", "  The morphological properties of galaxies between $21 {\\rm~mag} < I < 25\n{\\rm~mag}$ in the {\\em Hubble Deep Field} are investigated using a quantitative\nclassification system based on measurements of the central concentration and\nasymmetry of galaxian light. The class distribution of objects in the {\\em\nHubble Deep Field} is strongly skewed towards highly asymmetric objects,\nrelative to distributions from both the {\\em HST Medium Deep Survey} at $I < 22\n{\\rm~mag}$ and an artificially redshifted sample of local galaxies. The steeply\nrising number count-magnitude relation for irregular/peculiar/merging systems\nat $I < 22 {~\\rm mag}$ reported in Glazebrook \\etal\\ (1995a) continues to at\nleast $I=25~{\\rm mag}$. Although these peculiar systems are predominantly blue\nat optical wavelengths, a significant fraction also exhibit red $U-B$ colours,\nwhich may indicate they are at high redshift. Beyond Glazebrook \\etal 's\nmagnitude limit the spiral counts appear to rise more steeply than\nhigh-normalization no-evolution predictions, whereas those of elliptical/S0\ngalaxies only slightly exceed such predictions and may turn-over beyond $I \\sim\n24~{\\rm mag}$. These results are compared with those from previous\ninvestigations of faint galaxy morphology with HST and the possible\nimplications are briefly discussed. The large fraction of\npeculiar/irregular/merging systems in the {\\em Hubble Deep Field} suggests that\nby $I\\sim 25 {\\rm~mag}$ the conventional Hubble system no longer provides an\nadequate description of the morphological characteristics of a high fraction of\nfield galaxies.\n", "  Hamilton et al. have suggested an invaluable scaling formula which describes\nhow the power spectra of density fluctuations evolve into the nonlinear regime\nof hierarchical clustering. This paper presents an extension of their method to\nlow-density universes and universes with nonzero cosmological constant. We pay\nparticular attention to models with large negative spectral indices, and give a\nspectrum-dependent fitting formula which is of significantly improved accuracy\nby comparison with an earlier version of this work. The tendency of nonlinear\neffects to increase power on small scales is stronger for spectra with more\nnegative spectral indices, and for lower densities. However, for low-density\nmodels with a cosmological constant, the nonlinear effects are less strong than\nfor an open universe of the same $\\Omega$.\n", "  We present a study of the galaxies found in the Hubble Deep Field. A high\nproportion of HDF galaxies are undergoing a strong episode of star formation,\nas evidenced by their very blue colours. A wide range of morphological types is\nfound, with a high proportion of peculiar and merger morphologies. Fitting the\nmultiband spectra with redshifted SEDs of galaxy types E to HII, we predict the\nspectral types and redshifts of galaxies detected in the HDF. We find a median\nredshift of 1.6, with $68\\%$ having $z > 1$ and $31\\%$ with $z >2$. The I-band\nabsolute magnitude distributions as a function of galaxy types show a plausible\ntrend of decreasing luminosity towards later types. The derived I-band\nluminosity function agrees well with that from the Canada-France survey (Lilly\net al 1996) for $z < 1$ and shows strong luminosity evolution at $M_I < -21$\nfor $1 < z < 3$, comparable to the rate seen in quasars and starburst galaxies.\nWe have predicted infrared and submillimetre fluxes assuming most of the\ngalaxies are undergoing a strong starburst. Several planned space-borne and\nground-based deep surveys are capable of detecting interesting numbers of HDF\ngalaxies.\n", "  The proto-galaxy, cB58, was discovered in the CNOC survey of cluster\nredshifts. Absorption features reveal that this system is at a redshift of\n$z=2.72$, implying an absolute magnitude of ${\\rm M_v \\sim -26}$, and a\nstar-formation rate of $4700 {\\rm M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}$, making it the most\n``active'' star-forming galaxy. This proto-galaxy is observed to lie close\n$\\left(\\sim 6\\scnp\\right)$ to a central cluster galaxy at $z=0.373$. The X-ray\nproperties of the cluster suggest that its mass, and therefore its lensing\npotential, could be greater than that found using a virial analysis. In this\nLetter we argue that the phenomenal properties of this proto-galaxy are due to\nthe gravitational lensing effect of the foreground cluster, and the unlensed\nproperties of the source are typical of high-redshift star-forming systems.\n", "  Using the exceptional monitoring capabilities of the MACHO project we present\nhere the optical history of the LMC supersoft source (SSS) RX~J0513.9-6951, for\na continuous 3 year period. Recurring low states, in which the optical\nbrightness drops by up to a magnitude, are observed at quasi-regular intervals.\nThis provides a crucial insight into the nature of the SSS and, in particular,\na chance to investigate the poorly understood behaviour of their accretion\ndiscs. Analysis of the high state data reveals a small modulation of\nsemi-amplitude $\\sim$~0.02 mag at $P=$0.76278$\\pm$0.00005~d, a period which is\nconsistent with the current ``best'' suggested spectroscopic value.\n", "  We present the results of colour-selection of candidate high redshift (2.6\n$<$ z $<$ 3.9) galaxies within the Hubble Deep Field based on the Ly-break at\n912\\AA . We find 8 such objects in the region, giving a comoving number density\ncomparable to that of nearby bright galaxies (for a flat q$_0$=0.5, H$_0$=100\nkms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ universe). We provide basic data on the properties of\nthese objects, and show that despite their absolute magnitude being\nsignificantly brighter than L$^*$ (typically M$_B$ = -22), they are generally\nsmaller than nearby galaxies. Furthermore, visual inspection of their images\nshows that they are all highly disturbed systems, with multiple nuclei, tails\nand plumes, suggesting that they are undergoing merging processes similar to\nmost nearby starburst galaxies. Theoretical models suggest that galaxies form\nby accumulation of numerous subcomponents, and we suggest that we are seeing\nthis process underway in these objects. It is thus possible that the epoch of\ngalaxy formation might have been discovered.\n", "  The standard picture holds that giant elliptical galaxies formed in a single\nburst at high redshift. Aging of their stellar populations subsequently caused\nthem to fade and become redder. The Canada-France Redshift Survey provides a\nsample of about 125 galaxies with the luminosities and colours of passively\nevolving giant ellipticals and with 0.1 < z < 1. This sample is inconsistent\nwith the standard evolutionary picture with better than 99.9% confidence. The\nstandard Schmidt test gives <V/V_{max}> = 0.398 when restricted to objects with\nno detected star formation, and <V/V_{max}> = 0.410 when objects with emission\nlines are also included. A smaller sample of early-type galaxies selected from\ntha Hawaii Deep Survey gives equally significant results. With increasing\nredshift a larger and larger fraction of the nearby elliptical and S0\npopulation must drop out of of the sample, either because the galaxies are no\nlonger single units or because star formation alters their colours. If the\nremaining fraction is modelled as F=(1+z)^{-\\gamma}, the data imply gamma = 1.5\n+- 0.3. At z=1 only about one third of bright E and S0 galaxies were already\nassembled and had the colours of old passively evolving systems. We discuss the\nsensitivity of these results to the incompleteness corrections and stellar\npopulation models we have adopted. We conclude that neither is uncertain enough\nto reconcile the observations with the standard picture. Hierarchical galaxy\nformation models suggest that both merging and recent star formation play a\nrole in the strong evolution we have detected.\n", "  We discuss the optical spectrum of a multiply-imaged arc resolved by HST in\nthe $z$=0.175 cluster A2218. The spectrum, obtained with LDSS-2 on the 4.2m\nWilliam Herschel telescope, reveals the source to be a galaxy at a redshift\n$z$=2.515 in excellent agreement with the value predicted by Kneib et al.\n(1996) on the basis of their inversion of a highly-constrained mass model for\nthe lensing cluster. The source is extremely blue in its optical-infrared\ncolours, consistent with active star formation, and the spectrum reveals\nabsorption lines characteristic of a young stellar population. Of particular\nsignificance is the absence of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission but the presence of a\nbroad Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption. The spectrum is similar to that of other, much\nfainter, galaxies found at high redshift by various techniques and illustrates\nthe important role that lensing can play in detailed studies of the properties\nof distant galaxies.\n", "  We identify the probable optical counterpart of the SMC supersoft source,\nRX~J0059.2-7138, with a $\\sim$~14th magnitude star lying within the X-ray error\ncircle. We present high resolution optical spectroscopy, which reveals strong\nHI emission and HeI absorption, indicative of a Be star. This classification is\nconsistent with the colours we derive from optical photometry. We thus find\nevidence to support the existing tentative identification of this object as a\nBe/X-ray binary, the first of its kind to exhibit luminous supersoft X-ray\nemission.\n", "  We present bright galaxy number counts measured with linear detectors in the\nB, V, I, and K bands in two fields covering nearly 10 square degrees. All of\nour measurements are consistent with passive evolution models, and do not\nconfirm the steep slope measured in other surveys at bright magnitudes.\nThroughout the range 16 < B < 19, our B-band counts are consistent with the\n\"high normalization\" models proposed to reduce the faint blue galaxy problem.\nOur K-band counts agree with previous measurements, and have reached a fair\nsample of the universe in the magnitude range where evolution and K-corrections\nare well understood.\n", "  We report on a powerful and variable off-nuclear X-ray source in the nearby\nspiral galaxy NGC 4945. Two ROSAT PSPC observations show the source to brighten\nin 0.5--2.0 keV flux by a factor of about 9 on a time-scale of 11 months or\nless. It is seen by ASCA about one month after the second PSPC pointing, and is\nseen to have dimmed by a factor of > 7 in a ROSAT HRI pointing about one year\nafter the second PSPC pointing. Its maximum observed 0.8--2.5 keV luminosity is\nabout 8E38 erg/s, making it brighter than any known persistent X-ray binary in\nthe Milky Way. Its total X-ray luminosity is probably larger than 1.2E39 erg/s.\nThe observed variability argues against a superbubble interpretation, and the\noff-nuclear position argues against a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.\nThe source is therefore probably either an ultra-powerful X-ray binary or an\nultra-powerful supernova remnant. Optical monitoring has not identified any\nsupernovae in NGC 4945 during the time of the X-ray observations, and any\nsupernova would have had to have been either very highly absorbed or\nintrinsically optically faint.\n", "  The unprecedented resolution of the refurbished Wide Field and Planetary\nCamera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has led to major advances\nin our understanding of galaxy formation. The high image quality in the Medium\nDeep Survey and Hubble Deep Field has made it possible, for the first time, to\nclassify faint distant galaxies according to morphological type. These\nobservations have revealed a large population of galaxies classed as irregulars\nor which show signs of recent merger activity. Their abundance rises steeply\nwith apparent magnitude, providing a likely explanation for the large number of\nblue galaxies seen at faint magnitudes. We demonstrate that such a population\narises naturally in a model in which structure forms hierarchically and which\nis dynamically dominated by cold dark matter. The number counts of irregular,\nspiral and elliptical galaxies as a function of magnitude seen in the HST data\nare well reproduced in this model.We present detailed predictions for the\noutcome of spectroscopic follow-up observations of the HST surveys. By\nmeasuring the redshift distributions of faint galaxies of different\nmorphological types, these programmes will provide a test of the hierarchical\ngalaxy formation paradigm and might distinguish between models with different\ncosmological parameters.\n", "  We probe the statistical nature of the primordial density field by measuring\ncorrelations between the power in adjacent Fourier modes. For certain types of\nnon-Gaussian field, these k-space correlations would be expected to be more\nextended than for a Gaussian field, providing a useful discriminatory test for\nGaussian fields. We apply this test to the combined QDOT and 1.2-Jy IRAS galaxy\nsurvey and find the observed density field to be in good agreement with having\nGaussian density fluctuations for modes with k < 0.1 h/Mpc. From this result we\nare able to set quantitative limits on a class of possible non-Gaussian\ndistributions -- the product of a Gaussian field with an independent stochastic\nfield. The maximum sensitivity is to modulations of a Gaussian field with\ncoherence scales of 30 Mpc/h and the rms modulation on this scale cannot\ngreatly exceed unity. We discuss the improvements to this limit likely to be\nset by future surveys.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the angular correlation function in a\n$K$-selected galaxy survey, from two fields covering almost 10 square degrees.\nThe angular correlation function at small angles is well described by a\n$\\theta^{-0.8}$ power law, as for optically selected samples. The clustering\namplitude is reduced by a factor of $\\sim 4$ between galaxies with $K<15$ and a\nfainter magnitude slice with $15<K<16$. This allows us to place constraints\nupon the redshift distribution of the galaxies and their spatial correlation\nfunction. We find no clear evidence for a change in clustering amplitude when\ngalaxies are selected by their observed $B-K$ colours.\n", "  We present time-resolved spectrophotometry of GK Per taken on the rise to\noutburst maximum, in which we detect 5000 s QPOs in the optical emission lines.\nWe use this opportunity to provide a kinematically-resolved analysis of the\nphenomenon. Observations are consistent with reprocessing off blobs of gas\norbiting within the inner accretion disc, and evidence is found for the\nmigration of the QPO source towards the compact star over orbital timescales.\n", "  Though observationally rare, damped Lya absorption systems dominate the mass\ndensity of neutral gas in the Universe. Eleven high redshift damped Lya systems\ncovering 2.8<z<4.4 were discovered in 26 QSOs from the APM z>4 QSO Survey,\nextending these absorption system surveys to the highest redshifts currently\npossible. Combining our new data set with previous surveys we find that the\ncosmological mass density in neutral gas, omega_g, does not rise as steeply\nprior to z~2 as indicated by previous studies. There is evidence in the\nobserved omega_g for a flattening at z~2 and a possible turnover at z~3. When\ncombined with the decline at z>3.5 in number density per unit redshift of\ndamped systems with column densities log N(HI)>21 atoms cm^-2, these results\npoint to an epoch at z>3 prior to which the highest column density damped\nsystems are still forming. We find that over the redshift range 2<z<4 the total\nmass in neutral gas is marginally comparable with the total visible mass in\nstars in present day galaxies. However, if one considers the total mass visible\nin stellar disks alone, ie excluding galactic bulges, the two values are\ncomparable. We are observing a mass of neutral gas comparable to the mass of\nvisible disk stars. Lanzetta, Wolfe & Turnshek (1995) found that omega_g(z~3.5)\nwas twice omega_g(z~2), implying a much larger amount of star formation must\nhave taken place between z=3.5 and z=2 than is indicated by metallicity\nstudies. This created a `cosmic G-dwarf problem'. The more gradual evolution of\nomega_g we find alleviates this. These results have profound implications for\ntheories of galaxy formation.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a putative X-ray emitting halo surrounding the\nLocal Group of galaxies, and specifically the possible temperature anisotropies\ninduced in the COBE-DMR four-year sky maps by an associated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\neffect. By fitting the isothermal spherical halo model proposed by Suto et.al.\n(1996) to the coadded four-year COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps in Galactic\ncoordinates, we find no significant evidence of a contribution. We therefore\nreject the claim that such a halo can affect the estimation of the primordial\nspectral index and amplitude of density perturbations as inferred from the DMR\ndata. We find that correlation with the DMR data imposes constraints on the\nplausible contribution of such an X-ray emitting halo to a distortion in the\nCMB spectrum (as specified by the Compton-y parameter), up to a value for R --\nthe ratio of the core radius of the isothermal halo gas distribution to the\ndistance to the Local Group centroid -- of 0.68. For larger values of R, the\nrecent cosmological upper limit derived by COBE-FIRAS provides stronger\nconstraints on the model parameters. Over the entire parameter space for R, we\nfind an upper limit to the inferred sky-RMS anisotropy signal of 14 microKelvin\n(95% c.l.), a negligible amount relative to the 35 microKelvin signal observed\nin the COBE-DMR data.\n", "  It is believed that most giant elliptical galaxies possess nuclear black\nholes with masses in excess of $10^8\\Msun$. Bondi accretion from the\ninterstellar medium might then be expected to produce quasar-like luminosities\nfrom the nuclei of even quiescent elliptical galaxies. It is a puzzle that such\nluminosities are not observed. Motivated by this problem, Fabian & Rees have\nrecently suggested that the final stages of accretion in these objects occurs\nin an advection-dominated mode with a correspondingly small radiative\nefficiency. Despite possessing a long-known active nucleus and dynamical\nevidence for a black hole, the low radiative and kinetic luminosities of the\ncore of M87 provide the best illustration of this problem. We examine an\nadvection-dominated model for the nucleus of M87 and show that accretion at the\nBondi rate is compatible with the best known estimates for the core flux from\nradio through to X-ray wavelengths. The success of this model prompts us to\npropose that FR-I radio galaxies and quiescent elliptical galaxies accrete in\nan advection dominated mode whereas FR-II type radio-loud nuclei possess\nradiatively efficient thin accretion disks.\n", "  We use N-body simulations to examine the effects of mass outflows on the\ndensity profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) halos surrounding dwarf galaxies. In\nparticular, we investigate the consequences of supernova-driven winds that\nexpel a large fraction of the baryonic component from a dwarf galaxy disk after\na vigorous episode of star formation. We show that this sudden loss of mass\nleads to the formation of a core in the dark matter density profile, although\nthe original halo is modeled by a coreless (Hernquist) profile. The core radius\nthus created is a sensitive function of the mass and radius of the baryonic\ndisk being blown up. The loss of a disk with mass and size consistent with\nprimordial nucleosynthesis constraints and angular momentum considerations\nimprints a core radius which is only a small fraction of the original\nscale-length of the halo. These small perturbations are, however, enough to\nreconcile the rotation curves of dwarf irregulars with the density profiles of\nhaloes formed in the standard CDM scenario.\n", "  A straightforward determination of the circular-speed curve vc(R) of the\nMilky Way suggests that near the Sun, vc starts to rise approximately linearly\nwith R. If this result were correct, the Galactic mass density would have to be\nindependent of radius at R ~> R0. We show that the apparent linear rise in v_c\narises naturally if the true circular-speed curve is about constant or gently\nfalling at R0 < R ~< 2 R0, but most tracers that appear to be at R ~> 1.25 R0\nare actually concentrated into a ring of radius ~1.6 R0.\n", "  We present cuspy, non-axisymmetric, scale-free mass models of discs, whose\ngravitational potentials are of St\\\"ackel form in parabolic coordinates. A\nblack hole may be added at the centre, without in any way affecting the\nSt\\\"ackel form; the dynamics in these potentials is, of course, fully\nintegrable. The surface density, $\\Sigma_{disc}\\propto 1/r^{\\gamma}$, where $0\n<\\gamma < 1$ corresponds to steep cusps for which the central force diverges.\nThus cusps, black holes, and non-axisymmetry are not a sure recipe for chaos,\nas is generally assumed. A new family of orbits, lens orbits, emerges to\nreplace the box orbits of models of elliptical galaxies that have\nconstant-density cores. Loop orbits are conspicuous by their absence. Both\nlenses and boxlets (the other family of orbits), can be elongated in the\ndirection of the density distribution, a property that is favourable for the\nconstruction of non-axisymmetric, self-consistent equilibrium models of\nelliptical galaxies.\n", "  We have developed a model for gamma ray emission in jets of active galactic\nnuclei in which particle acceleration takes place at a shock in the\nrelativistic jet plasma due to a massive star in the central region of the host\ngalaxy moving through the jet. The gamma rays are produced in a pair-Compton\ncascade in the radiation field of the star initiated by accelerated electrons.\nOur model may account for the observed GeV to TeV gamma ray spectrum and\nvariability of Markarian 421 and other blazars detected by the EGRET instrument\non the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.\n", "  Using the group-theoretical approach to the inverse scattering method the\nsupersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equation is obtained by application of the\nDrinfeld-Sokolov reduction to osp(1|2) loop superalgebra. The direct and\ninverse scattering problems are discussed for the corresponding Lax pair.\n"]}
