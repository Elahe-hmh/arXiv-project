Ho) are investigated up\nto 14 Tesla via magnetic and dielectric measurements. The stability range of\nthe AFM order below the Neel temperature of the studied RMnO3 extends to far\nhigher magnetic fields than previously assumed. Magnetic irreversibility\nindicating the presence of a spontaneous magnetic moment is found near 50 K for\nR=Er, Yb, and Tm. At very low temperatures and low magnetic fields the phase\nboundary defined by the ordering of the rare earth moments is resolved. The\nsizable dielectric anomalies observed along all phase boundaries are evidence\nfor strong spin-lattice coupling in the hexagonal RMnO3. In HoMnO3 the strong\nmagnetoelastic distortions are investigated in more detail via magnetostriction\nexperiments up to 14 Tesla. The results are discussed based on existing data on\nmagnetic symmetries and the interactions between the Mn-spins, the rare earth\nmoments, and the lattice.\n", "  Epitaxial thin films of Bi2FeCrO6 have been synthesized by pulsed laser\ndeposition on SrRuO3 on (100)- and (111)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates. Detailed\nX-ray diffraction and cross-section transmission electron microscopy analysis\nrevealed a double perovskite crystal structure of the Bi2FeCrO6 epitaxial films\nvery similar to that of BiFeO3 along with a particularly noteworthy Fe3+/Cr3+\ncation ordering along the [111] direction. The films contain no detectable\nmagnetic iron oxide impurities and have the correct cationic average\nstoichiometry throughout their thickness. They however exhibit a slight\nmodulation in the Fe and Cr compositions forming complementary stripe patterns,\nsuggesting minor local excess or depletion of Fe and Cr. The epitaxial BFCO\nfilms exhibit good ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, in addition to\nmagnetic properties at room temperature, as well as an unexpected\ncrystallographic orientation dependence of their room temperature magnetic\nproperties. Our results qualitatively confirm the predictions made using the\nab-initio calculations: the double-perovskite structure of Bi2FeCrO6 films\nexhibit a Fe3+/Cr3+ cation ordering and good multiferroic properties, along\nwith the unpredicted existence of magnetic ordering at room temperature.\n", "  The Drude-Lorentz model for the motion of electrons in a solid is a classical\nmodel in statistical mechanics, where electrons are represented as point\nparticles bouncing on a fixed system of obstacles (the atoms in the solid).\nUnder some appropriate scaling assumption -- known as the Boltzmann-Grad\nscaling by analogy with the kinetic theory of rarefied gases -- this system can\nbe described in some limit by a linear Boltzmann equation, assuming that the\nconfiguration of obstacles is random [G. Gallavotti, [Phys. Rev. (2) vol. 185\n(1969), 308]). The case of a periodic configuration of obstacles (like atoms in\na crystal) leads to a completely different limiting dynamics. These lecture\nnotes review several results on this problem obtained in the past decade as\njoint work with J. Bourgain, E. Caglioti and B. Wennberg.\n", "  We study the effect of a (3+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons electrodynamics on\nthe equations governing the dynamics of magnetized plasma and fields. In this\nmodel, the Chern-Simons (CS) part consists of a dynamical pseudo-scalar field\nwhose space-time derivatives couple with the electromagnetic field. We explore\nthe CS corrections to the evolution equation for the magnetic field in a plasma\nwith non-zero electrical resistivity. We revisit Cowling's theorem in this\ncontext and observe that the CS corrections lead to possibly small but non-zero\nsource terms for axisymmetric magnetic field. The scalar product of electric\nand magnetic fields play the role of source of the pseudo-scalar field, and\ntherefore, pulsars and magnetars are likely astrophysical candidates to\ngenerate propagating pseudo-scalar waves. Although aligned electric field gets\nshorted out by flowing charges in large parts of the magnetosphere, there are\nvacuum gaps in the vicinity of pulsars where strong $\\vec E. \\vec B$ is\nexpected to be present. We derive a wave solution for the pseudo-scalar field\ngenerated by the time-varying $\\vec E. \\vec B$ associated with a pulsar.\n", "  The isothermal remanent magnetization is used to investigate dynamical\nmagnetic properties of spatially three dimensional spin glasses with different\nspin dimensionality (Ising, XY, Heisenberg). The isothermal remanent\nmagnetization is recorded vs. temperature after intermittent application of a\nweak magnetic field at a constant temperature $T_h$. We observe that in the\ncase of the Heisenberg spin glasses, the equilibrated spin structure and the\ndirection of the excess moment are recovered at $T_h$. The isothermal remanent\nmagnetization thus reflects the directional character of the\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction present in Heisenberg systems.\n", "  This article is the first one in a series of two dealing with the concept of\n\"resonant metalens\" we recently introduced [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 203901\n(2010)]. Here, we focus on the physics of a medium with finite dimensions\nconsisting on a square lattice of parallel conducting wires arranged on a\nsub-wavelength scale. This medium supports electromagnetic fields that vary\nmuch faster than the operating wavelength. We show that such modes are\ndispersive due to the finiteness of the medium. Their dispersion relation is\nestablished in a simple way, a link with designer plasmons is made, and the\ncanalization phenomenon is reinterpreted at the light of our model. We explain\nhow to take advantage of this dispersion in order to code sub-wavelength wave\nfields in time. Finally, we show that the resonant nature of the medium ensures\nan efficient coupling of these modes with free space propagating waves and,\nthanks to the Purcell effect, with a source placed in the near field of the\nmedium.\n", "  This is the second article in a series of two dealing with the concept of\n\"resonant metalens\" we introduced recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 203901\n(2010)]. It is a new type of lens capable of coding in time and radiating\nefficiently in the far field region sub-diffraction information of an object. A\nproof of concept of such a lens is performed in the microwave range, using a\nmedium made out of a square lattice of parallel conducting wires with finite\nlength. We investigate a sub-wavelength focusing scheme with time reversal and\ndemonstrate experimentally spots with focal widths of {\\lambda}/25. Through a\ncross-correlation based imaging procedure we show an image reconstruction with\na resolution of {\\lambda}/80. Eventually we discuss the limitations of such a\nlens which reside essentially in losses.\n", "  The Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb Green function [R.\nSzmytkowski, J. Phys. B 30 (1997) 825; erratum 30 (1997) 2747] is exploited to\nderive closed-form expressions for electric ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{E}}$) and\nmagnetic ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{M}}$) dipole shielding constants for the ground\nstate of the relativistic hydrogen-like atom with a point-like and spinless\nnucleus of charge $Ze$. It is found that $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{E}}=Z^{-1}$ (as it\nshould be) and\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{M}}=-(2Z\\alpha^{2}/27)(4\\gamma_{1}^{3}+6\\gamma_{1}^{2}-7\\gamma_{1}-12)\n/[\\gamma_{1}(\\gamma_{1}+1)(2\\gamma_{1}-1)],$$ where\n$\\gamma_{1}=\\sqrt{1-(Z\\alpha)^{2}}$ ($\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant).\nThis expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{M}}$ agrees with earlier findings of\nseveral other authors, obtained with the use of other analytical techniques,\nand is elementary compared to an alternative one presented recently by Cheng\n\\emph{et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. 130 (2009) 144102], which involves an infinite\nseries of ratios of the Euler's gamma functions.\n", "  We comment on a recent approach to spatial stochastic inversion, which\ncenters on a concept known as \"anchors\" and conducts nonparametric estimation\nof the likelihood of the anchors (along with other model parameters) with\nrespect to data obtained from field processes. The approach is called \"anchored\ninversion\" or, less desirably, \"method of anchored distribution\". Conceptual\nand technical observations are made regarding the development, interpretation,\nand use of this approach. We also point out that this approach has been\nsuperseded by new developments.\n", "  The fully quantized model of double qubits coupled to a common bath is solved\nusing the quantum state diffusion (QSD) approach in the non-Markovian regime.\nWe have established the explicit time-local non-Markovian QSD equations for the\ntwo-qubit dissipative and dephasing models. Diffusive quantum trajectories are\napplied to the entanglement estimation of two-qubit systems in a non-Markovian\nregime. In both cases, non-Markovian features of entanglement evolution are\nrevealed through quantum diffusive unravellings in the system state space.\n", "  The very old problem of the statistical content of quantum mechanics (QM) is\nstudied in a novel framework. The Born's rule (one of the basic postulates of\nQM) is derived from theory of classical random signals. We present a\nmeasurement scheme which transforms continuous signals into discrete clicks and\nreproduces the Born's rule. This is the sheme of threshold type detection.\nCalibration of detectors plays a crucial role.\n", "  A novel stearic acid (SA)/3-aminopropyltrethoxysilane (APS) composite\nstructure was fabricated using the combined method of the Langmuir-Blodgett\ntechnique and self-assembly monolayer (SAM) technique. Its frictional, adhesive\nproperties and interface contact types between the atomic force microscope tip\nand the samples were evaluated based on Amonton's laws and the general\nCarpick's transition equation, respectively. The results showed that the\ntip-sample contacts corresponded to the\nJohnson-Kendall-Robert/Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) transition model for\nSiO2, APS-SAMs, and the unheated SA-APS composite structure, and for the heated\nSA-APS bilayer to the DMT model. Frictional forces for the four samples were\nlinearly dependent on external loads at higher loads, and at lower loads they\nwere significantly affected by adhesive forces. Frictional and scratching tests\nshowed that the heated SA-APS composite structure exhibited the best\nlubricating properties and adhesion resistance ability, and its wear resistance\ncapacity was greatly improved due to the binding-mode conversion from hydrogen\nbonds to covalent bonds. Thus, this kind of composite bilayer might be\npromising for applications in the lubrication of nano/microelectromechanical\nsystems. I.\n", "  A model for nucleation of second phase at or around dislocation in a\ncrystalline solid is considered. The model employs the Ginzburg-Landau theory\nof phase transition comprising the sextic term in order parameter in the Landau\nfree energy. The ground state solution of the linearized time-independent\nGinzburg-Landau equation has been derived, through which the spatial variation\nof the order parameter has been delineated. Moreover, a generic phase diagram\nindicating a tricritical behavior near and away from the dislocation is\ndepicted. The relation between the classical nucleation theory and the\nGinzburg-Landau approach has been discussed, for which the critical formation\nenergy of nucleus is related to the maximal of the Landau potential energy. A\nnumerical example illustrating the application of the model to the case of\nnucleation of hydrides in zirconium alloys is provided.\n", "  Here we report the systematic study of solid-state phase transformations\nbetween boron polymorphs: {\\alpha}-B12, {\\beta}-B106, {\\gamma}-B28, T-B52 and\namorphous boron (am-B). It is evident that the Ostwald rule of stages plays an\nimportant role during phase transformations not only of amorphous boron, but\nalso of crystalline forms. We have observed the crystallization of tetragonal\nboron T-B52 from amorphous phase of high purity (99.99%), which, however,\ncannot be easily distinguished from B50C2 boron compound. Many factors\ninfluence the transformations of amorphous phase, and it is possible to observe\nnot only well known am-B \\rightarrow {\\alpha}-B12 and am-B \\rightarrow\n{\\beta}-B106 transformations, but also am-B \\rightarrow T-B52, never reported\nso far. At ~14 GPa the crystallization order becomes {\\beta}-B106 \\rightarrow\n{\\alpha}-B12 \\rightarrow {\\gamma}-B28, while at ~11 GPa the intermediate\ncrystallization of T-B52 still was observed. This unambiguously indicates that\n{\\alpha}-B12 is more thermodynamically stable than {\\beta}-B106 at high\npressures, and renders possible to transform, at least partially, common\n{\\beta}-phase of high purity into {\\alpha}-B12 at very high pressures and\nmoderate temperatures (below 1600 K), i.e. outside the domain of its stability.\n", "  A first principle explanation of the origin of intermittency and nonlinear\nstructure formation in the Lagrangian velocity increments of a turbulent flow\nis presented in the context of a scale invariant analytical formalism that is\nbeing developed recently. The copious generation of power laws and nonlinear\nexponents in the structure functions are shown to follow quite naturally in the\npresent formalism.\n", "  We review a strategy for targeted synthesis of large single crystal samples\nof prototype quantum magnets for inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Four\ncase studies of organic copper halogenide S=1/2 systems are presented. They are\nmeant to illustrate that exciting experimental results pertaining to forefront\nmany-body quantum physics can be obtained on samples grown using very simple\ntechniques, standard laboratory equipment, and almost no experience in in\nadvanced crystal growth techniques.\n", "  We consider a Dirac one-electron atom placed in a weak, static, uniform\nmagnetic field. We show that, to the first order in the strength $B$ of the\nperturbing field, the only electric multipole moment induced by the field in\nthe ground state of the atom is the quadrupole one. Using the Sturmian\nexpansion of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb Green function [R. Szmytkowski, J.\nPhys. B 30 (1997) 825; erratum 30 (1997) 2747], we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the induced electric quadrupole moment. The result contains the\ngeneralized hypergeometric function $_{3}F_{2}$ of the unit argument. Earlier\ncalculations by other authors, based on the non-relativistic model of the atom,\npredicted in the low-field region the quadratic dependence of the induced\nelectric quadrupole moment on $B$.\n", "  We report the evolution of magnetic field and its energy in NOAA active\nregion 11158 over 5 days based on a vector magnetogram series from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory\n(SDO). Fast flux emergence and strong shearing motion led to a quadrupolar\nsunspot complex that produced several major eruptions, including the first\nX-class flare of Solar Cycle 24. Extrapolated non-linear force-free coronal\nfields show substantial electric current and free energy increase during early\nflux emergence near a low-lying sigmoidal filament with sheared kilogauss field\nin the filament channel. The computed magnetic free energy reaches a maximum of\n~2.6e32 erg, about 50% of which is stored below 6 Mm. It decreases by ~0.3e32\nerg within 1 hour of the X-class flare, which is likely an underestimation of\nthe actual energy loss. During the flare, the photospheric field changed\nrapidly: horizontal field was enhanced by 28% in the core region, becoming more\ninclined and more parallel to the polarity inversion line. Such change is\nconsistent with the conjectured coronal field \"implosion\", and is supported by\nthe coronal loop retraction observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA).\nThe extrapolated field becomes more \"compact\" after the flare, with shorter\nloops in the core region, probably because of reconnection. The coronal field\nbecomes slightly more sheared in the lowest layer, relaxes faster with height,\nand is overall less energetic.\n", "  The virial theorem is applied to graphene and other Dirac Materials for\nsystems close to the Dirac points where the dispersion relation is linear. From\nthis, we find the exact form for the total energy given by $E =\n\\mathcal{B}/r_s$ where $r_s a_0$ is the mean radius of the $d$-dimensional\nsphere containing one particle, with $a_0$ the Bohr radius, and $\\mathcal{B}$\nis a constant independent of $r_s$. This result implies that, given a linear\ndispersion and a Coulombic interaction, there is no Wigner crystalization and\nthat calculating $\\mathcal{B}$ or measuring at any value of $r_s$ determines\nthe energy and compressibility for all $r_s$. In addition to the total energy\nwe calculate the exact forms of the chemical potential, pressure and inverse\ncompressibility in arbitrary dimension.\n", "  We consider the problem of deforming simultaneously a pair of given\nstructures. We show that such deformations are governed by an L-infinity\nalgebra, which we construct explicitly. Our machinery is based on Th. Voronov's\nderived bracket construction.\n  In this paper we consider only geometric applications, including deformations\nof coisotropic submanifolds in Poisson manifolds, of twisted Poisson\nstructures, and of complex structures within generalized complex geometry.\nThese applications can not be, to our knowledge, obtained by other methods such\nas operad theory.\n", "  Elastic wave propagation is studied in a heterogeneous 2-D medium consisting\nof an elastic matrix containing randomly distributed circular elastic\ninclusions. The aim of this study is to determine the effective wavenumbers\nwhen the incident wavelength is similar to the radius of the inclusions. A\npurely numerical methodology is presented, with which the limitations usually\nassociated with low scatterer concentrations can be avoided. The elastodynamic\nequations are integrated by a fourth-order time-domain numerical scheme. An\nimmersed interface method is used to accurately discretize the interfaces on a\nCartesian grid. The effective field is extracted from the simulated data, and\nsignal-processing tools are used to obtain the complex effective wavenumbers.\nThe numerical reference solution thus-obtained can be used to check the\nvalidity of multiple scattering analytical models. The method is applied to the\ncase of concrete. A parametric study is performed on longitudinal and\ntransverse incident plane waves at various scatterers concentrations. The phase\nvelocities and attenuations determined numerically are compared with\npredictions obtained with multiple scattering models, such as the Independent\nScattering Approximation model, the Waterman-Truell model, and the more recent\nConoir-Norris model.\n", "  A diagrammatic approach based on thermal Green function to superconducting\nfluctuation transport is reviewed focusing on Hall and Nernst effects. The\ntreatment of weak magnetic field is carefully discussed within the linear order\nperturbation.\n  In the Appendix the linear response theory for the DC Hall conductivity of\nthe Dirac fermion in 2+1 space-time dimensions is reviewed. One focus is the\nChern-Simons effective action for the gauge field. Another is the exact formula\nby Ishikawa and Matsuyama.\n", "  Generalized gradient approximated (GGA) density functional theory (DFT)\ntypically overestimates polarizability and bond-lengths, and underestimates\nforce constants of covalent bonds. To overcome this problem we show that one\ncan use empirical force correcting atom centered potentials (FCACPs),\nparameterized for every nuclear species. Parameters are obtained through\nminimization of a penalty functional that explicitly encodes hybrid DFT forces\nand static polarizabilities of reference molecules. For hydrogen, fluorine,\nchlorine, and carbon the respective reference molecules consist of H$_2$,\nF$_2$, Cl$_2$, and CH$_4$. The transferability of this approach is assessed for\nharmonic frequencies in a small set of chlorofluorocarbon molecules. Numerical\nevidence, gathered for CF$_4$, CCl$_4$, CCl$_3$F, CCl$_2$F$_2$, CClF$_3$, ClF,\nHF, HCl, CFH$_3$, CF$_2$H$_2$, CF$_3$H, CHCl$_3$, CH$_2$Cl$_2$, CH$_3$Cl\nindicates that the GGA+FCACP level of theory yields harmonic frequencies that\nare significantly more consistent with hybrid DFT values, as well as slightly\nreduced molecular polarizability.\n", "  We present a method to construct explicitly L-infinity algebras governing\nsimultaneous deformations of various kinds of algebraic structures and of their\nmorphisms. It is an alternative to the heavy use of the operad machinery of the\nexisting approaches. Our method relies on Voronov's derived bracket\nconstruction.\n", "  This course explains how the usual mean field evolution partial differential\nequations (PDEs) in Statistical Physics - such as the Vlasov-Poisson system,\nthe vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional Euler equation for\nincompressible fluids, or the time-dependent Hartree equation in quantum\nmechanics - can be rigorously derived from first principles, i.e. from the\nfundamental microscopic equations that govern the evolution of large,\ninteracting particle systems. The emphasis is put on the mathematical methods\nused in these derivations, such as Dobrushin's stability estimate in the\nMonge-Kantorovich distance for the empirical measures built on the solution of\nthe N-particle motion equations in classical mechanics, or the theory of BBGKY\nhierarchies in the case of classical as well as quantum problems. We explain in\ndetail how these different approaches are related; in particular we insist on\nthe notion of chaotic sequences and on the propagation of chaos in the BBGKY\nhierarchy as the number of particles tends to infinity.\n", "  We report on a methodology for the treatment of the Coulomb energy and\npotential in Kohn-Sham density functional theory that is free from\nself-interaction effects. Specifically, we determine the Coulomb potential\ngiven as the functional derivative of the Coulomb energy with respect to the\ndensity, where the Coulomb energy is calculated explicitly in terms of the pair\ndensity of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. This is accomplished by taking advantage of\nan orthonormal and complete basis that is an explicit functional of the density\nthat then allows for the functional differentiation of the pair density with\nrespect to the density to be performed explicitly. This approach leads to a new\nformalism that provides an analytic, closed-form determination of the exchange\npotential. This method is applied to one-dimensional model systems and to the\natoms Helium through Krypton based on an exchange only implementation.\nComparison of our total energies (denoted SIF) to those obtained using the\nusual Hartree-Fock (HF) and optimized effective potential (OEP) methods reveals\nthe hierarchy\n  $E_{\\rm HF} \\le E_{\\rm OEP} \\le E_{\\rm SIF}$ that is indicative of the\ngreater variation freedom implicit in the former two methods.\n", "  A method for study of charge-transfer interactions between solute molecules\nand solvent based on the comparison of the ratios of spectral shifts of\ndifferent electronic transitions in solute molecules in chemically inert\nsolvent is proposed. The method is applicable to molecules that do not change\ntheir dipole moment on excitation. As an example, a presence of charge transfer\ninteractions in higher electronic states of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene,\nphenanthrene, and naphthalene) dissolved in water and alcohols was\ndemonstrated.\n", "  We compare quantum decoherence in generic regular and chaotic systems that\ninteract with a thermal reservoir via a dipole coupling. Using a\ntime-dependent, self-consistent approximation in the spirit of Hartree, we\nderive in the high temperature limit an expression for the off-diagonal\nelements of the system density operator that initially corresponds to a\ncoherent superposition of two adjacent wave packets. We relate the decoherence\nrate to the Lyapunov exponent in the Ehrenfest regime. In this regime, the\ngreater the instability of the system the faster the loss of coherence occurs.\n", "  The effect of electrical resistivity switching in nanographite films is\ndescribed. In difference with cases published elsewhere the switching in\nnanographite films occurs from stable high conductive to metastable low\nconductive state. Critical current of switching varies in the range 10-500 mA\nand can be increased up to values appropriate for using of nanographite samples\nin power grids as contact-less current limiters and circuit breakers. The\npossible mechanisms of switching phenomenon in nanographite films are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the flexural wave modes existing in finite stacks of gratings\ncontaining rigid, zero-radius pins. We group the modes into even and odd\nclasses, and derive dispersion equations for each. We study the recently\ndiscovered EDIT (elasto-dynamically inhibited transmission) phenomenon, and\nrelate it to the occurrence of trapped waves of even and odd symmetries being\nsimultaneously resonant. We show how the EDIT interaction may be steered over a\nwide range of frequencies and angles, using a strategy in which the\nsingle-grating reflectance is kept high, so enabling the quality factors of the\neven and odd resonances to be kept large.\n", "  In this review we study the level of accuracy of the electronic wave\nfunctions which is necessary to describe properly the atomic effects during\nnuclear beta-decay. In the case of the beta- decay in the Li atom into Be+ ion\nwe compare the numerical values of the transition probabilities from the S-,\nP-, D-low-lying states of the initial atom and final ion calculated using both\nHylleraas-Configuration Interaction (Hy-CI) and Configuration Interaction (CI)\nwith Slater orbitals wave functions. In addition using the CI method the\ntransition probabilities from F, G, H and I low-lying states have been\ncalculated. The average of the absolute deviation of the transition\nprobabilities distribution for low-lying S-states is <0.15%, for P-states\n<0.5%, and larger for D- and higher energy states. The numerical results\ndemonstrate that for low-lying states the atomic effect parameters in\nbeta-decay can be calculated with sufficient accuracy using CI wave functions\nconstructed with Slater orbitals. This result opens a new avenue for the\naccurate calculation of atomic effects during the beta-decay in heavier atoms\nand molecules.\n", "  Due to the recent interest in studying propagation of light through\ntriangular air gaps, we calculate, by using the analogy between optics and\nquantum mechanics and the multiple step technique, the transmissivity through a\ntriangular air gap surrounded by an homogeneous dielectric medium. The new\nformula is then compared with the formula used in literature. Starting from the\nqualitative and quantitative differences between these formulas, we propose\noptical experiments to test our theoretical results.\n", "  We present numerical studies of conduction in graphene nanoribbons with\nreconstructed edges based on the standard tight-binding model of the graphene\nand the extended Huckel model of the reconstructed defects. We performed atomic\ngeometry relaxation of individual defects using density functional theory and\nthen explicitly calculated the tight-binding parameters used to model electron\ntransport in graphene with reconstructed edges. The calculated conductances\nreveal strong backscattering and electron-hole asymmetry depending on the edge\nand defect type. This is related to an additional defect-induced band whose\nwave function is poorly matched to the propagating states of the pristine\nribbon. We find a transport gap to open near the Dirac point and to scale\ninversely with the ribbon width, similarly to what has been observed in\nexperiments. We predict the largest transport gap to occur for armchair edges\nwith Stone-Wales defects, while heptagon and pentagon defects cause about equal\nbackscattering for electrons and holes, respectively. Choosing the heptagon\ndefect as an example, we show that although electron interactions in the\nHartree approximation cause accumulation of charge carriers on the defects,\nsurprisingly, their effect on transport is to reduce carrier backscattering by\nthe defects and thus to enhance the conductance.\n", "  Quantum biology is an emerging field of research that concerns itself with\nthe experimental and theoretical exploration of non-trivial quantum phenomena\nin biological systems. In this tutorial overview we aim to bring out\nfundamental assumptions and questions in the field, identify basic design\nprinciples and develop a key underlying theme -- the dynamics of quantum\ndynamical networks in the presence of an environment and the fruitful interplay\nthat the two may enter. At the hand of three biological phenomena whose\nunderstanding is held to require quantum mechanical processes, namely\nexcitation and charge transfer in photosynthetic complexes, magneto-reception\nin birds and the olfactory sense, we demonstrate that this underlying theme\nencompasses them all, thus suggesting its wider relevance as an archetypical\nframework for quantum biology.\n", "  A number of elite thinkers in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries\npursued an agenda which historian Paolo Rossi calls the \"quest for a universal\nlanguage,\" a quest which was deeply interwoven with the emergence of the\nscientific method. From a modern perspective, one of the many surprising\naspects of these efforts is that they relied on a diverse array of memorization\ntechniques as foundational elements. In the case of Leibniz's universal\ncalculus, the ultimate vision was to create a pictorial language that could be\nlearned by anyone in a matter of weeks and which would contain within it a\nsymbolic representation of all domains of contemporary thought, ranging from\nthe natural sciences, to theology, to law. In this brief article, I explore why\nthis agenda might have been appealing to thinkers of this era by examining\nancient and modern memory feats. As a thought experiment, I suggest that a\nsociety built entirely upon memorization might be less limited than we might\notherwise imagine, and furthermore, that cultural norms discouraging the use of\nwritten language might have had implications for the development of scientific\nmethodology. Viewed in this light, the efforts of Leibniz and others seem\nsignificantly less surprising. I close with some general observations about\ncross-cultural origins of scientific thought.\n", "  Low-lying bound states for the problem of two Coulomb charges of finite\nmasses on a plane subject to a constant magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the\nplane are considered. Major emphasis is given to two systems: two charges with\nthe equal charge-to-mass ratio (quasi-equal charges) and neutral systems with\nconcrete results for the Hydrogen atom and two electrons (quantum dot). It is\nshown that for these two cases, but when a neutral system is at rest (the\ncenter-of-mass momentum is zero), some outstanding properties occur: in double\npolar coordinates in CMS $(R, \\phi)$ and relative $(\\rho, \\varphi)$ coordinate\nsystems (i) the eigenfunctions are factorizable, all factors except for\n$\\rho$-dependent are found analytically, they have definite relative angular\nmomentum, (ii) dynamics in $\\rho$-direction is the same for both systems being\ndescribed by a funnel-type potential; (iii) at some discrete values of\ndimensionless magnetic fields $b \\leq 1$ the system becomes {\\it\nquasi-exactly-solvable} and a finite number of eigenfunctions in $\\rho$ are\npolynomials. The variational method is employed. Trial functions are based on\ncombining for the phase of a wavefunction (a) the WKB expansion at large\ndistances, (b) the perturbation theory at small distances (c) with a form of\nthe known analytically (quasi-exactly-solvable) eigenfunctions. For the lowest\nstates with relative magnetic quantum numbers $s=0,1,2$ this approximation\ngives not less than 7 s.d., 8 s.d., 9 s.d., respectively, for the total energy\n$E(B)$ for magnetic fields $0.049\\, \\text{a.u.} < B < 2000\\, \\text{a.u.} $\n(Hydrogen atom) and $0.025\\, \\text{a.u.}\\eqslantless B \\eqslantless 1000\\,\n\\text{a.u.} $ (two electrons).\n", "  It is an interesting and open problem to trace the origin of the pseudospin\nsymmetry in nuclear single-particle spectra and its symmetry breaking mechanism\nin actual nuclei. In this report, we mainly focus on our recent progress on\nthis topic by combining the similarity renormalization group technique,\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics, and perturbation theory. We found that it is\na promising direction to understand the pseudospin symmetry in a quantitative\nway.\n", "  We study the constrained Ostrogradski-Hamilton framework for the equations of\nmotion provided by mechanical systems described by second-order derivative\nactions with a linear dependence in the accelerations. We stress out the\npeculiar features provided by the surface terms arising for this type of\ntheories and we discuss some important properties for this kind of actions in\norder to pave the way for the construction of a well defned quantum counterpart\nby means of canonical methods. In particular, we analyse in detail the\nconstraint structure for these theories and its relation to the inherent\nconserved quantities where the associated energies together with a Noether\ncharge may be identifed. The constraint structure is fully analyzed without the\nintroduction of auxiliary variables, as proposed in recent works involving\nhigher order Lagrangians. Finally, we also provide some examples where our\napproach is explicitly applied and emphasize the way in which our original\narrangement results in propitious for the Hamiltonian formulation of covariant\nfeld theories.\n", "  A study of the self-organization of vacancy clusters in irradiated materials\nis presented. Using a continuum stochastic model we take into account dynamics\nof point defects and their sinks with elastic interactions of vacancies.\nDynamics of vacancy clusters formation is studied analytically and numerically\nunder conditions related to irradiation in both reactors and accelerators. We\nhave shown a difference in patterning dynamics and studied the external noise\ninfluence related to fluctuation in a defect production rate. Applying our\napproach to pure nickel irradiated under different conditions we have shown\nthat vacancy clusters having a linear size 6 nm can arrange in statistical\nperiodic structure with nano-meter range. We have found that linear size of\nvacancy clusters at accelerator conditions decreases down to 20%, whereas a\nperiod of vacancy clusters reduces to 6.5%.\n", "  Since Moser's seminal work it is well known that the invariant curves of\nsmooth nearly integrable twist maps of the cylinder with Diophantine rotation\nnumber are preserved under perturbation. In this paper we show that, in the\nanalytic class, the result extends to Bryuno rotation numbers. First, we will\nshow that the series expansion for the invariant curves in powers of the\nperturbation parameter can be formally defined, then we shall prove that the\nseries converges absolutely in a neighbourhood of the origin. This will be\nachieved using multiscale analysis and renormalisation group techniques to\nexpress the coefficients of the series as sums of values which are represented\ngraphically as tree diagrams and then exploit cancellations between terms\ncontributing to the same perturbation order. As a byproduct we shall see that,\nwhen perturbing linear maps, the series expansion for an analytic invariant\ncurve converges for all perturbations if and only if the corresponding rotation\nnumber satisfies the Bryuno condition.\n", "  Algebraic-rational nature of the four-dimensional, $F_4$-invariant integrable\nquantum Hamiltonians, both rational and trigonometric, is revealed and\nreviewed. It was shown that being written in $F_4$ Weyl invariants, polynomial\nand exponential, respectively, both similarity-transformed Hamiltonians are in\nalgebraic form, they are quite similar the second order differential operators\nwith polynomial coefficients; the flat metric in the Laplace-Beltrami operator\nhas polynomial (in invariants) matrix elements. Their potentials are calculated\nfor the first time: they are meromorphic (rational) functions with\nsingularities at the boundaries of the configuration space. Ground state\neigenfunctions are algebraic functions in a form of polynomials in some\ndegrees. Both Hamiltonians preserve the same infinite flag of polynomial spaces\nwith characteristic vector $(1, 2, 2, 3)$, it manifests exact solvability. A\nparticular integral common for both models is derived. The first polynomial\neigenfunctions are presented explicitly.\n", "  We have performed Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (LAPW) calculations for\nfive crystal structures (alpha, dhcp, sc, fcc, bcc) of Boron which we then\nfitted to a non-orthogonal tight-binding model following the Naval Research\nLaboratory Tight-Binding (NRL-TB) method. The predictions of the NRL-TB\napproach for complicated Boron structures such as R105 (or\n\\b{eta}-rhombohedral) and T190 are in agreement with recent first-principles\ncalculations. Fully utilizing the computational speed of the NRL-TB method we\ncalculated the energetic differences of various structures including those\ncontaining vacancies using supercells with up to 5000 atoms.\n", "  In this work, the well known power-law relation between strength and sample\nsize, $d^{-n}$, is derived from the knowledge that a dislocation network\nexhibits scale-free behaviour and the extreme value statistical properties of\nan arbitrary distribution of critical stresses. This approach yields\n$n=(\\tau+1)/(\\alpha+1)$, where $\\alpha$ reflects the leading order algebraic\nexponent of the low stress regime of the critical stress distribution and\n$\\tau$ is the scaling exponent for intermittent plastic strain activity. This\nquite general derivation supports the experimental observation that the size\neffect paradigm is applicable to a wide range of materials, differing in\ncrystal structure, internal microstructure and external sample geometry.\n", "  Statistical isotropy (SI) of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations\nis a key observational test to validate the cosmological principle underlying\nthe standard model of cosmology. While a detection of SI violation would have\nimmense cosmological ramification, it is important to recognise their possible\norigin in systematic effects of observations. WMAP seven year (WMAP-7) release\nclaimed significant deviation from SI in the bipolar spherical harmonic\n(BipoSH) coefficients $A_{ll}^{20}$ and $A_{l-2l}^{20}$. Here we present the\nfirst explicit reproduction of the measurements reported in WMAP-7, confirming\nthat beam systematics alone can completely account for the measured SI\nviolation. The possibility of such a systematic origin was alluded to in WMAP-7\npaper itself and other authors but not as explicitly so as to account for it\naccurately. We simulate CMB maps using the actual WMAP non-circular beams and\nscanning strategy. Our estimated BipoSH spectra from these maps match the\nWMAP-7 results very well. It is also evident that only a very careful and\nadequately detailed modelling, as carried out here, can conclusively establish\nthat the entire signal arises from non-circular beam effect. This is important\nsince cosmic SI violation signals are expected to be subtle and dismissing a\nlarge SI violation signal as observational artefact based on simplistic\nplausibility arguments run the serious risk of \"throwing the baby out with the\nbathwater\".\n", "  In this paper, we acquire the soliton solutions of the nonlinear\nSchrodinger's equation with dual power-law nonlinearity. Primiraly, we use the\nextended trial equation method to find exact solutions of this equation. Then,\nwe attain some exact solutions including soliton solutions, rational and\nelliptic function solutions of this equation by using the extended trial\nequation method.\n", "  We extend the variational problem of Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics by\nputting the electromagnetic functional in a local space of absolutely\ncontinuous trajectories possessing a derivative (velocities) of bounded\nvariation. Generalizing the calculus of variations for extrema with a finite\nnumber of velocity discontinuities (breaking points), we prove that the\ncritical-point-conditions for the two-body problem in the extended local space\nare Euler-Lagrange equations holding Lebesgue-almost-everywhere plus the\ngeneralized Weierstrass-Erdmann conditions that (i) the partial momenta must be\nabsolutely continuous functions and (ii) the Legendre transforms of the partial\nLagrangians (i.e, the partial energies) must be absolutely continuous\nfunctions.\n", "  Rigorous mathematical foundations of density functional theory are revisited,\nwith some use of infinitesimal (nonstandard) methods. A thorough treatment is\ngiven of basic properties of internal energy and ground-state energy\nfunctionals along with several improvements and clarifications of known\nresults.A simple metrizable topology is constructed on the space of densities\nusing a hierarchy of spatial partitions. This topology is very weak, but\nsupplemented by control of internal energy, it is, in a rough sense,\nessentially as strong as $L^1$. Consequently, the internal energy functional\n$F$ is lower semicontinuous with respect to it. With separation of positive and\nnegative parts of external potentials, very badly behaved, even infinite,\npositive parts can be handled. Confining potentials are thereby incorporated\ndirectly into the density functional framework.\n", "  We analyze one particle, two-center quantum problems which admit separation\nof variables in prolate spheroidal coordinates, a natural restriction satisfied\nby the H$_2^+$ molecular ion. The symmetry operator is constructed explicitly.\nWe give the details of the Hamiltonian reduction of the 3D system to a 2D\nsystem with modified potential that is separable in elliptic coordinates. The\npotentials for which there is double-periodicity of the Schr\\\"odinger operator\nin the space of prolate spheroidal coordinates, including one for the H$_2^+$\nmolecular ion, are indicated. We study possible potentials that admit\nexact-solvability is as well as all models known to us with the\n(quasi)-exact-solvability property for the separation equations. We find deep\nconnections between second-order superintegrable and conformally\nsuperintegrable systems and these tractable problems. In particular we derive a\ngeneral 4-parameter expression for a model potential that is always integrable\nand is conformally superintegrable for some parameter choices.\n", "  Ewald-parameter dependence of Coulomb interaction in ionic crystals was\nstudied using a point-charge model. In the presence of the long-range\ninteraction, the ion configuration breaks spherical symmetry of local potential\nand charge at each ion site, and gives non-scalar contributions to them. This\nnon-scalar potential has similar effects to Heisenberg interaction, while is\nintrinsically distinct from conventional multipole expansions of the scalar\npotential. Symmetry and magnitude of the scalar and non-scalar potentials are\nsimilar for most materials despite the different definitions, but one exception\ncan be seen in parent materials of hole-doped high-$T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ cuprates.\n", "  We present the theoretical prediction of spontaneous rotating vortex rings in\na parametrically driven quantum fluid of polaritons -- coherent superpositions\nof coupled quantum well excitons and microcavity photons. These rings arise not\nonly in the absence of any rotating drive, but also in the absence of a\ntrapping potential, in a model known to map quantitatively to experiments. We\nbegin by proposing a novel parametric pumping scheme for polaritons, with\ncircular symmetry and radial currents, and characterize the resulting\nnonequilibrium condensate. We show that the system is unstable to spontaneous\nbreaking of circular symmetry via a modulational instability, following which a\nvortex ring with large net angular momentum emerges, rotating in one of two\ntopologically distinct states. Such rings are robust and carry distinctive\nexperimental signatures, and so they could find applications in the new\ngeneration of polaritonic devices.\n", "  The moving neutral system of two Coulomb charges on a plane subject to a\nconstant magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the plane is considered. It is\nshown that the composite system of finite total mass is bound for any\ncenter-of-mass momentum $P$ and magnetic field strength; the energy of the\nground state is calculated accurately using a variational approach. Their\naccuracy is cross-checked in a Lagrange-mesh method for $B=1$ a.u. and in a\nperturbation theory at small $B$ and $P$. The constructed trial function has\nthe property of being a uniform approximation of the exact eigenfunction. For a\nHydrogen atom and a Positronium a double perturbation theory in $B$ and $P$ is\ndeveloped and the first corrections are found algebraically. A phenomenon of a\nsharp change of energy behavior for a certain center-of-mass momentum and a\nfixed magnetic field is indicated.\n", "  Frequency dependent scattering rate of generalized Drude model contains\nimportant physics of the electronic structure and of scattering mechanisms. In\nthe present investigation, we study the frequency dependent scattering rate of\ncuprates (Mitrovic-Fiorucci/ Sharapov-Carbotte scattering rate) in the\npseudogap phase using the non-constant energy dependent Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ)\ndensity of states. First, with the energy dependent density of states, the\nscattering rate gives the picture of depression formation coming from the\nopening of the pseudogap. Second, the evolution of $1/\\tau(\\omega)$ with\ntemperature shows the increase of scattering rate with the temperature at lower\nfrequencies and the temperature independence of $1/\\tau(\\omega)$ at higher\nfrequencies. Third, the signature of thresholds due to boson density of states\nand the electronic density of states also has been observed. These signatures\nare qualitatively in accord with the experiments.\n", "  The $1/Z$-expansion for the ground state energy of the Coulomb system of an\ninfinitely massive center of charge Z and two electrons (two electron ionic\nsequence) is studied. A critical analysis of the $1/Z$ coefficients presented\nin Baker et al, {\\em Phys. Rev. \\bf A41}, 1247 (1990) is performed and its\nnumerical deficiency is indicated, leading, in particular, to unreliable\ndecimal digits beyond digits 11-12 of the first coefficients. We made a\nconsistency check of the $1/Z$-expansion with accurate energies for $Z = 1 -\n10$: the weighted partial sums of the $1/Z$-expansion with Baker et al.\ncoefficients, reproduce systematically the ground state energies of\ntwo-electron ions with $Z \\geq 2$ up to 12 decimal digits and for $Z=1$ up to\n10 decimal digits. This rules out the presence of non-analytic terms at\n$Z=\\infty$ contributing into the first 10-12 decimal digits in the ground state\nenergy; it agrees with the Kato theorem about convergence of the\n$1/Z$-expansion within that accuracy. The ground state energy of two-electron\nions $Z=11\\ (Na^{9+})$ and $Z=12\\ (Mg^{10+})$ is calculated with 12 decimal\ndigits.\n", "  We discuss the dynamics of moving end mirror of an optomechanical system that\nconsists of a Fabry-Perot cavity loaded with dilute condensate and driven by a\nsingle mode optical field. It is shown that quantum mechanical phenomenon of\ndynamical localization occurs both in position and momentum space for moving\nend mirror in the system. The parametric dependencies of dynamical localization\nare discussed. We also provide a set of parameters which makes this phenomenon\nexperimentally feasible.\n", "  We present deep, wide-field imaging of the M96 galaxy group (also known as\nthe Leo I Group). Down to surface brightness limits of $\\mu_{B}=30.1$ and\n$\\mu_{V}=29.5$, we find no diffuse, large-scale optical counterpart to the \"Leo\nRing\", an extended HI ring surrounding the central elliptical M105 (NGC 3379).\nHowever, we do find a number of extremely low surface-brightness ($\\mu_{B}\n\\gtrsim 29$) small-scale streamlike features, possibly tidal in origin, two of\nwhich may be associated with the Ring. In addition we present detailed surface\nphotometry of each of the group's most massive members -- M105, NGC 3384, M96\n(NGC 3368), and M95 (NGC 3351) -- out to large radius and low surface\nbrightness, where we search for signatures of interaction and accretion events.\nWe find that the outer isophotes of both M105 and M95 appear almost completely\nundisturbed, in contrast to NGC 3384 which shows a system of diffuse shells\nindicative of a recent minor merger. We also find photometric evidence that M96\nis accreting gas from the HI ring, in agreement with HI data. In general,\nhowever, interaction signatures in the M96 Group are extremely subtle for a\ngroup environment, and provide some tension with interaction scenarios for the\nformation of the Leo HI Ring. The lack of a significant component of diffuse\nintragroup starlight in the M96 Group is consistent with its status as a loose\ngalaxy group in which encounters are relatively mild and infrequent.\n", "  The timestep of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method (FDTD) is\nconstrained by the stability limit known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)\ncondition. This limit can make FDTD simulations quite time consuming for\nstructures containing small geometrical details. Several methods have been\nproposed in the literature to extend the CFL limit, including implicit FDTD\nmethods and filtering techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nwhich combines model order reduction and a perturbation algorithm to accelerate\nFDTD simulations beyond the CFL barrier. We compare the proposed algorithm\nagainst existing implicit and explicit CFL extension techniques, demonstrating\nincreased accuracy and performance on a large number of test cases, including\nresonant cavities, a waveguide structure, a focusing metascreen and a\nmicrostrip filter.\n", "  The potential of the $BC_1$ quantum elliptic model is a superposition of two\nWeierstrass functions with doubling of both periods (two coupling constants).\nThe $BC_1$ elliptic model degenerates to $A_1$ elliptic model characterized by\nthe Lam\\'e Hamiltonian. It is shown that in the space of $BC_1$ elliptic\ninvariant, the potential becomes a rational function, while the flat space\nmetric becomes a polynomial. The model possesses the hidden $sl(2)$ algebra for\narbitrary coupling constants: it is equivalent to $sl(2)$-quantum top in three\ndifferent magnetic fields. It is shown that there exist three one-parametric\nfamilies of coupling constants for which a finite number of polynomial\neigenfunctions (up to a factor) occur.\n", "  Quantum double models, such as the toric code, can be constructed from\ntransfer matrices of lattice gauge theories with discrete gauge groups and\nparametrized by the center of the gauge group algebra and its dual. For general\nchoices of these parameters the transfer matrix contains operators acting on\nlinks which can also be thought of as perturbations to the quantum double model\ndriving it out of its topological phase and destroying the exact solvability of\nthe quantum double model. We modify these transfer matrices with perturbations\nand extract exactly solvable models which remain in a quantum phase, thus\nnullifying the effect of the perturbation. The algebra of the modified vertex\nand plaquette operators now obey a deformed version of the quantum double\nalgebra. The Abelian cases are shown to be in the quantum double phase whereas\nthe non-Abelian phases are shown to be in a modified phase of the corresponding\nquantum double phase. These are illustrated with the groups $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and\n$S_3$. The quantum phases are determined by studying the excitations of these\nsystems namely their fusion rules and the statistics. We then go further to\nconstruct a transfer matrix which contains the other $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase\nnamely the double semion phase. More generally for other discrete groups these\ntransfer matrices contain the twisted quantum double models. These transfer\nmatrices can be thought of as being obtained by introducing extra parameters\ninto the transfer matrix of lattice gauge theories. These parameters are\ncentral elements belonging to the tensor products of the algebra and its dual\nand are associated to vertices and volumes of the three dimensional lattice. As\nin the case of the lattice gauge theories we construct the operators creating\nthe excitations in this case and study their braiding and fusion properties.\n", "  An exact solution of the Einstein field equations given the barotropic\nequation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ yields two possible models: (1) if $\\omega\n<-1$, we obtain the most general possible anisotropic model for wormholes\nsupported by phantom energy and (2) if $\\omega >0$, we obtain a model for\ngalactic rotation curves. Here the equation of state represents a perfect fluid\nwhich may include dark matter. These results illustrate the power and\nusefulness of exact solutions.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the Gaia mission can supply data which will\nimprove the photometric calibration of LSST. After outlining the LSST calibra-\ntion process and the information that will be available from Gaia, we explore\ntwo options for using Gaia data. The first is to use Gaia G-band photometry of\nselected stars, in conjunction with knowledge of the stellar parameters Teff,\nlog g, and AV, and in some cases Z, to create photometric standards in the LSST\nu, g, r, i, z, and y bands. The accuracies of the resulting standard magnitudes\nare found to be insufficient to satisfy LSST requirements when generated from\nmain sequence (MS) stars, but generally adequate from DA white dwarfs (WD). The\nsecond option is combine the LSST bandpasses into a synthetic Gaia G band,\nwhich is a close approximation to the real Gaia G band. This allows synthetic\nGaia G photometry to be directly compared with actual Gaia G photometry at a\nlevel of accuracy which is useful for both verifying and improving LSST\nphotometric calibration.\n", "  The proof of convergence of the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) from\nLegland etal. (2011) is extended to non-Gaussian state space models. A\ndensity-based deterministic approximation of the mean-field limit EnKF\n(DMFEnKF) is proposed, consisting of a PDE solver and a quadrature rule. Given\na certain minimal order of convergence $\\kappa$ between the two, this extends\nto the deterministic filter approximation, which is therefore asymptotically\nsuperior to standard EnKF when the dimension $d<2\\kappa$. The fidelity of\napproximation of the true distribution is also established using an extension\nof total variation metric to random measures. This is limited by a Gaussian\nbias term arising from non-linearity/non-Gaussianity of the model, which exists\nfor both DMFEnKF and standard EnKF. Numerical results support and extend the\ntheory.\n", "  We introduce the Weibull distribution as a simple parametrization of charged\nparticle multiplicities in hadron-hadron collisions at all available energies,\nranging from ISR energies to the most recent LHC energies. In statistics, the\nWeibull distribution has wide applicability in natural processes involving\nfragmentation processes. This gives a natural connection to the available\nstate-of-the-art models for multi-particle production in hadron hadron\ncollisions involving QCD parton fragmentation and hadronization.\n", "  Dislocation based modeling of plasticity is one of the central challenges at\nthe crossover of materials science and continuum mechanics. Developing a\ncontinuum theory of dislocations requires the solution of two long standing\nproblems: (i) to find a faithful representation of dislocation kinematics with\na reasonable number of variables and (ii) to derive averaged descriptions of\nthe dislocation dynamics (i.e. material laws) in terms of these variables. In\nthe current paper we solve the first problem. This is achieved through a\nmultipole expansion of the dislocation density in terms of so-called alignment\ntensors containing the directional distribution of dislocation density and\ndislocation curvature. A hierarchy of evolution equations of these tensors is\nderived from a higher dimensional dislocation density theory. Low order closure\napproximations of this hierarchy lead to continuum dislocation dynamics models\nwith only few internal variables. Perspectives for more refined theories and\ncurrent challenges in dislocation density modeling are discussed.\n", "  Random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond shape exhibit interesting features\nand some of the statistical properties seen in random matrix theory. As a\nstatistical mechanical model it can be thought of as a dimer model or as a\ncertain random surface. We consider the Aztec diamond with a two-periodic\nweighting which exhibits all three possible phases that occur in these types of\nmodels, often referred to as solid, liquid and gas. To analyze this model, we\nuse entries of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix which give the probability of any\nconfiguration of dominoes. A formula for these entries, for this particular\nmodel, was derived by Chhita and Young (2014). In this paper, we find a major\nsimplification of this formula expressing entries of the inverse Kasteleyn\nmatrix by double contour integrals which makes it possible to investigate their\nasymptotics. In a part of the Aztec diamond, where the asymptotic analysis is\nsimpler, we use this formula to show that the entries of the inverse Kasteleyn\nmatrix converge to the known entries of the full-plane inverse Kasteleyn\nmatrices for the different phases. We also study the detailed asymptotics of\nthe inverse Kasteleyn matrix at both the \"liquid-solid\" and \"liquid-gas\"\nboundaries, and find the extended Airy kernel in the next order asymptotics.\nFinally we provide a potential candidate for a combinatorial description of the\nliquid-gas boundary.\n", "  Polarisation amplitude estimation is affected by a positive noise bias,\nparticularly important in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We\npresent a new approach to correct for this bias in the case there is additional\ninformation about the polarisation angle. We develop the 'known-angle\nestimator' that works in the special case when there is an independent and high\nsignal-to-noise ratio ($\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$) measurement of the polarisation\nangle. It is derived for the general case where the uncertainties in the Q,U\nStokes parameters are not symmetric. This estimator completely corrects for the\npolarisation bias if the polarisation angle is perfectly known. In the\nrealistic case, where the angle template has uncertainties, a small residual\nbias remains, but that is shown to be much smaller that the one left by other\nclassical estimators. We also test our method with more realistic data, using\nthe noise properties of the three lower frequency maps of WMAP. In this case,\nthe known-angle estimator also produces better results than methods that do not\ninclude the angle information. This estimator is therefore useful in the case\nwhere the polarisation angle is expected to be constant over different data\nsets with different SNR.\n", "  We show that for a one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operator with a potential\nwhose first moment is integrable the scattering matrix is in the unital Wiener\nalgebra of functions with integrable Fourier transforms. Then we use this to\nderive dispersion estimates for solutions of the associated Schr\\\"odinger and\nKlein-Gordon equations. In particular, we remove the additional decay\nconditions in the case where a resonance is present at the edge of the\ncontinuous spectrum.\n", "  Ion Coulomb crystals (ICC), formed by atomic ions at low temperatures in\nradiofrequency and Penning ion traps, are structures that have remarkable\nproperties and many applications. Images of Coulomb crystals are striking and\nreveal the crystal structure, which arises from a balance between the trapping\nforces acting on the ions and their mutual Coulomb repulsion. Applications of\nthese structures range from frequency standards and quantum simulation through\nto measurement of the cross sections of chemical reactions of ions.\n", "  Respecting the conservation laws of momentum and energy in a many body theory\nis very important for understanding the transport phenomena. The previous\nconserving approximation requires that the self-energy of a single particle can\nbe written as a functional derivative of a full dressed Green's function. This\ncondition can not be satisfied in the $G_0G$ t-matrix or pair fluctuation\ntheory which emphasizes the fermion pairing with a stronger than the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) attraction. In the previous\nwork\\cite{stressWI}, we have shown that when the temperature is above the\nsuperfluid transition temperature $T_c$, the $G_0G$ t-matrix theory can be put\ninto a form that satisfies the stress tensor Ward identity (WI) or local form\nof conservation laws by introducing a new type of vertex correction. In this\npaper, we will extend the above conservation approximation to the superfluid\nphase in the BCS mean field level. To establish the stress tensor WI, we have\nto include the fluctuation of the order parameter or the contribution from the\nGoldstone mode. The result will be useful for understanding the transport\nproperties such as the behavior of the viscosity of Fermionic gases in the\nsuperfluid phases.\n", "  We show the emergence of a new type of dispersion relation for neutral atoms\nwith an interesting similarity with the spectrum of 2-dimensional electrons in\nan applied perpendicular constant magnetic field. These neutral atoms can be\nconfined in toroidal optical traps and give quasi Landau spectra. In strong\ncontrast to the equi-distant infinitely degenerate Landau levels for charged\nparticles, the spectral gap for such 2-dimensional neutral particles increases\nin particular electric field configurations. The idea in the paper is motivated\nby the development in cold atom experiments and builds on the seminal paper of\nAharonov and Casher.\n", "  The structure of uniformly continuous quantum Markov semigroups with atomic\ndecoherence-free subalgebra is established providing a naturaldecomposition of\na Markovian open quantum system into its noiseless (decoherence-free) and\nirreducible (ergodic) components. This leads to a new characterisation of the\nstructure of invariant states and a new method for finding decoherence-free\nsubsystems and subspaces. Examples are presented to illustrate these results.\n", "  Gravitational lensing - the deflection of light rays by gravitating matter -\nhas become a major tool in the armoury of the modern cosmologist. Proposed\nnearly a hundred years ago as a key feature of Einstein's theory of General\nRelativity, we trace the historical development since its verification at a\nsolar eclipse in 1919. Einstein was apparently cautious about its practical\nutility and the subject lay dormant observationally for nearly 60 years.\nNonetheless there has been rapid progress over the past twenty years. The\ntechnique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on large\nand small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological model\nwhich assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. By\nmeasuring distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmic\ntime, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether the\ndark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is a\nvacuum energy density or a failure of General Relativity on large scales. We\nillustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power of\ngravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified by\nmassive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten a\nbackground star. We summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground and\nspace-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.\n", "  For an understanding of DNA elasticity at high mechanical loads (F > 30 pN),\nits helical nature needs to be taken into account, in the form of coupling\nbetween the twist and stretch degrees of freedom. The prevailing model for DNA\nelasticity, the worm-like chain, was previously extended to include this\ntwist-stretch coupling, giving rise to the twistable worm-like chain. Motivated\nby DNA's charged nature, and the known effects of ionic charges on the\nmolecule's persistence length and stretch modulus, we explored the impact of\nbuffer ionic conditions on twist-stretch coupling. After developing a robust\nfitting approach for force-extension data, we find that DNA's helical twist is\nstabilized at high concentrations of the magnesium divalent cation.\n", "  We consider a finite region of a $d$-dimensional lattice, $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\nof weakly coupled harmonic oscillators. The coupling is provided by a\nnearest-neighbour potential (harmonic or not) of size $\\varepsilon$. Each\noscillator weakly interacts by force of order $\\varepsilon$ with its own\nstochastic Langevin thermostat of arbitrary positive temperature. We\ninvestigate limiting as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$ behaviour of solutions of\nthe system and of the local energy of oscillators on long-time intervals of\norder $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and in a stationary regime. We show that it is\ngoverned by an effective equation which is a dissipative SDE with nondegenerate\ndiffusion. Next we assume that the interaction potential is of size\n$\\varepsilon\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is another small parameter, independent\nfrom $\\varepsilon$. Solutions corresponding to this scaling describe small low\ntemperature oscillations. We prove that in a stationary regime, under the limit\n$\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$, the main order in $\\lambda$ of the averaged\nHamiltonian energy flow is proportional to the gradient of temperature. We show\nthat the coefficient of proportionality, which we call the conductivity, admits\na representation through stationary space-time correlations of the energy flow.\nMost of the results and convergences we obtain are uniform with respect to the\nnumber of oscillators in the system.\n", "  We show that the Anderson model has a transition from localization to\ndelocalization at exactly 2 dimensional growth rate on antitrees with\nnormalized edge weights which are certain discrete graphs. The kinetic part has\na one-dimensional structure allowing a description through transfer matrices\nwhich involve some Schur complement. For such operators we introduce the notion\nof having one propagating channel and extend theorems from the theory of\none-dimensional Jacobi operators that relate the behavior of transfer matrices\nwith the spectrum. These theorems are then applied to the considered model. In\nessence, in a certain energy region the kinetic part averages the random\npotentials along shells and the transfer matrices behave similar as for a\none-dimensional operator with random potential of decaying variance. At $d$\ndimensional growth for $d>2$ this effective decay is strong enough to obtain\nabsolutely continuous spectrum, whereas for some uniform $d$ dimensional growth\nwith $d<2$ one has pure point spectrum in this energy region. At exactly\nuniform $2$ dimensional growth also some singular continuous spectrum appears,\nat least at small disorder. As a corollary we also obtain a change from\nsingular spectrum ($d\\leq 2$) to absolutely continuous spectrum ($d\\geq 3)$ for\nrandom operators of the type $\\mathcal{P}_r \\Delta_d \\mathcal{P}_r+\\lambda\n\\mathcal{V}$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, where $\\mathcal{P}_r$ is an orthogonal radial\nprojection, $\\Delta_d$ the discrete adjacency operator (Laplacian) on\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\\lambda \\mathcal{V}$ a random potential.\n", "  We investigate the isospin symmetry breaking effects within a recently\nderived Nambu-Jona-Lasinio related model by fitting the measured pseudoscalar\nmeson masses and weak decay couplings $f_\\pi$, $f_K$. Our model contains the\nnext to leading order terms in the $1/N_c$ expansion of the effective\nmulti-quark Lagrangian, including the ones that break the chiral symmetry\nexplicitly. We show the important phenomenological role of these interactions:\n(1) they lead to an accurate fit of the low-lying pseudoscalar nonet\ncharacteristics; (2) they account for a very good agreement of the current\nquark masses with the present PDG values; (3) they reduce by $40\\%$ the ratio\n$\\epsilon/\\epsilon'$ of the $\\pi_0-\\eta$ and $\\pi_0-\\eta'$ mixing angles, as\ncompared to the case that contemplates explicit breaking only in the leading\norder, bringing it in consonance with the quoted values in the literature. The\nconventional NJL-type models fail in the joint description of these parameters.\n", "  The divisible sandpile starts with i.i.d. random variables (\"masses\") at the\nvertices of an infinite, vertex-transitive graph, and redistributes mass by a\nlocal toppling rule in an attempt to make all masses at most 1. The process\nstabilizes almost surely if m<1 and it almost surely does not stabilize if m>1,\nwhere $m$ is the mean mass per vertex. The main result of this paper is that in\nthe critical case m=1, if the initial masses have finite variance, then the\nprocess almost surely does not stabilize. To give quantitative estimates on a\nfinite graph, we relate the number of topplings to a discrete biLaplacian\nGaussian field.\n", "  Improved computation of the dielectric function considering excitonic effects\nand long wavelength is performed and compared with the nearly free electron\nband approximation, similarly with the Penn's model case. New expressions for\nthe real and imaginary part of the dielectric function are presented and the\nreal part compared with the Penn's result. The obtained functions satisfy the\nKramers-Kr\\\"onig relations, in contrast with earlier results in the literature.\nIn addition, our improved dielectric function presents a coeficient of 2/3 for\nsmall gap approximation (different from the value of 1 in the original Penn\nmodel) is very close to the value 0.62 obtained in [Can. J. Phys.53,(1975)\np.2549] from pure numerical procedures. The obtained dielectric function also\nis used in a rough and stimative analysis of the metal-insulator transition in\nmolecular hydrogen being the critical densities determined near the\nexperimental values for the hydrogen coming from other approach. The\napproximated expressions and critical values are given and the usefulness of\nthe rough methods involved in the determination of the critical points briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Advective transport of scalar quantities through surfaces is of fundamental\nimportance in many scientific applications. From the Eulerian perspective of\nthe surface it can be quantified by the well-known integral of the flux\ndensity. The recent development of highly accurate semi-Lagrangian methods for\nsolving scalar conservation laws and of Lagrangian approaches to coherent\nstructures in turbulent (geophysical) fluid flows necessitate a new approach to\ntransport from the (Lagrangian) material perspective. We present a Lagrangian\nframework for calculating transport of conserved quantities through a given\nsurface in $n$-dimensional, fully aperiodic, volume-preserving flows. Our\napproach does not involve any dynamical assumptions on the surface or its\nboundary.\n", "  A highlighting feature of Majorana bound states in two-dimensional\ntopological superconductors is that they gain a phase factor of $\\pi$ upon\nbeing orbited by a vortex. This work focuses on the vortex degree of freedom\nitself and demonstrates that the change in the Majorana state is accompanied by\na fermion parity change within the vortex. Such a parity flip is interpreted as\na higher dimensional analog of the fermion parity pump mechanism in\nsuperconducting wires as well as through general topological arguments. It is\ndemonstrated in terms of level crossings in three different situations - in i)\nspin-triplet paired superconductors, and in proximity-induced superconducting\nsystems involving ii) quantum spin Hall-ferromagnet hybrids and iii) Chern\ninsulators.\n", "  In this paper we study the inference of the kinetic Ising model on sparse\ngraphs by the decimation method. The decimation method, which was first\nproposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 070603] for the static inverse Ising\nproblem, tries to recover the topology of the inferred system by setting the\nweakest couplings to zero iteratively. During the decimation process the\nlikelihood function is maximized over the remaining couplings. Unlike the\n$\\ell_1$-optimization based methods, the decimation method does not use the\nLaplace distribution as a heuristic choice of prior to select a sparse\nsolution. In our case, the whole process can be done automatically without\nfixing any parameters by hand. We show that in the dynamical inference problem,\nwhere the task is to reconstruct the couplings of an Ising model given the\ndata, the decimation process can be applied naturally into a maximum-likelihood\noptimization algorithm, as opposed to the static case where pseudo-likelihood\nmethod needs to be adopted. We also use extensive numerical studies to validate\nthe accuracy of our methods in dynamical inference problems. Our results\nillustrate that on various topologies and with different distribution of\ncouplings, the decimation method outperforms the widely-used $\\ell\n_1$-optimization based methods.\n", "  In the present work, we consider the mass in mass (or mass with mass) system\nof granular chains, namely a granular chain involving additionally an internal\nresonator. For these chains, we rigorously establish that under suitable\n\"anti-resonance\" conditions connecting the mass of the resonator and the speed\nof the wave, bell-shaped traveling wave solutions continue to exist in the\nsystem, in a way reminiscent of the results proven for the standard granular\nchain of elastic Hertzian contacts. We also numerically touch upon settings\nwhere the conditions do not hold, illustrating, in line also with recent\nexperimental work, that non-monotonic waves bearing non-vanishing tails may\nexist in the latter case.\n", "  The nucleon single-particle energies (SPEs) of the selected closed shell\nnuclei; that is, 16O, 40Ca, and 56Ni, are obtained by using the diagonal matrix\nelements of two-body effective interaction, which generated through the lowest\norder constrained variational (LOCV) calculations for the symmetric nuclear\nmatter with the AV18 phenomenological nucleon-nucleon potential. The SPEs at\nthe major levels of nuclei are calculated by employing a Hartree-Fock\ninspired-scheme in the spherical harmonic oscillator basis. In the scheme, the\ncorrelation influences are taken into account by imposing the nucleon effective\nmass factor on the radial wave functions of the major levels. Replacing the\ndensity-dependent one-body momentum distribution functions of nucleons,\nn(k,rho), with the Heaviside functions, the role of n(k,rho) on the nucleon\nSPEs at the major levels of the selected closed shell nuclei, is investigated.\nThe best fit of spin-orbit splitting is taken into account when correcting the\nmajor levels of the nuclei by using the parameterized Wood-Saxon potential and\nthe AV18 density-dependent mean field potential which is constructed by the\nLOCV method. Considering the point-like protons in the spherical Coulomb's\npotential well, the single-proton energies are corrected. The results show the\nimportance of including n(k,rho), instead of the Heaviside functions, in the\ncalculation of nucleon SPEs at the different levels, particularly the valence\nlevels, of the closed shell nuclei.\n", "  The homogenization of a composite material comprising three isotropic\ndielectric materials was investigated. The component materials were randomly\ndistributed as spherical particles, with the particles of two of the component\nmaterials being coupled to form dimers. The Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett\nformalisms were developed to estimate the permittivity dyadic of the\nhomogenized composite material (HCM), under the quasi-electrostatic\napproximation. Both randomly oriented and identically oriented dimers were\naccommodated; in the former case the HCM is isotropic, whereas in the latter\ncase the HCM is uniaxial. Representative numerical results for composite\nmaterials containing dielectric--dielectric dimers demonstrate close agreement\nbetween the estimates delivered by the Bruggeman and Maxwell Garnett\nformalisms. For composite materials containing metal--dielectric dimers with\nmoderate degrees of dissipation, the estimates of the two formalisms are in\nbroad agreement, provided that the dimer volume fractions are relatively low.\nIn general, the effects of intradimer coupling on the estimates of the HCM\npermittivity are relatively modest but not insignificant, these effects being\nexacerbated by anisotropy when all dimers are identically oriented.\n", "  In this paper, we have estimated the temperature dependent path\npredictability for an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The increment of\npath predictability can directly be associated with stronger decoherence\nprocess. We have also theoretically predicted that placing two detectors in\nboth the paths, which are at the same equilibrium temperature with the system,\nerases all the memory of path information and hence acts like a quantum eraser.\n", "  The main result in this paper is a new inequality bearing on solutions of the\n$N$-body linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and of the mean field Hartree\nequation. This inequality implies that the mean field limit of the quantum\nmechanics of $N$ identical particles is uniform in the classical limit and\nprovides a quantitative estimate of the quality of the approximation. This\nresult applies to the case of $C^{1,1}$ interaction potentials. The quantity\nmeasuring the approximation of the $N$-body quantum dynamics by its mean field\nlimit is analogous to the Monge-Kantorovich (or Wasserstein) distance with\nexponent $2$. The inequality satisfied by this quantity is reminiscent of the\nwork of Dobrushin on the mean field limit in classical mechanics [Func. Anal.\nAppl. 13 (1979), 115-123]. Our approach of this problem is based on a direct\nanalysis of the $N$-particle Liouville equation, and avoids using techniques\nbased on the BBGKY hierarchy or on second quantization.\n", "  The analysis of space-time data from complex, real-life phenomena requires\nthe use of flexible and physically motivated covariance functions. In most\ncases, it is not possible to explicitly solve the equations of motion for the\nfields or the respective covariance functions. In the statistical literature,\ncovariance functions are often based on mathematical constructions. We propose\nderiving space-time covariance functions by solving \"effective equations of\nmotion\", which can be used as statistical representations of systems with\ndiffusive behavior. In particular, we propose using the linear response theory\nto formulate space-time covariance functions based on an equilibrium effective\nHamiltonian. The effective space-time dynamics are then generated by a\nstochastic perturbation around the equilibrium point of the classical field\nHamiltonian leading to an associated Langevin equation. We employ a Hamiltonian\nwhich extends the classical Gaussian field theory by including a curvature term\nand leads to a diffusive Langevin equation. Finally, we derive new forms of\nspace-time covariance functions.\n", "  In \\cite{Park:2014tia} we proposed a way of quantizing gravity with the\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian analyses in the ADM setup. One of the key\nobservations was that the physical configuration space of the 4D\nEinstein-Hilbert action admits a three-dimensional description, thereby making\ngravity renormalization possible through a metric field redefinition.\nSubsequently, a more mathematical and complementary picture of the reduction\nbased on foliation theory was presented in \\cite{Park:2014qoa}. With the setup\nof foliation the physical degrees of freedom have been identified with a\ncertain leaf. Here we expand the work of \\cite{Park:2014qoa} by adding another\nmathematical ingredient - an element of jet bundle theory. With the\nintroduction of the jet bundle, the procedure of identifying the true degrees\nof freedom outlined therein is made precise and the whole picture of the\nreduction is put on firm mathematical ground.\n", "  This paper presents a consistent approach to prescribe traction boundary\nconditions in atomistic models. Due to the typical multiple-neighbor\ninteractions, finding an appropriate boundary condition that models a desired\ntraction is a non-trivial task. We first present a one-dimensional example,\nwhich demonstrates how such boundary conditions can be formulated. We further\nanalyze the stability, and derive its continuum limit. We also show how the\nboundary conditions can be extended to higher dimensions with an application to\na dislocation dipole problem under shear stress.\n", "  The VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC) is a public survey\nproject of the European Southern Observatory. It is collecting multi-band\nnear-infrared data across large areas of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds,\nthe Magellanic Bridge and a few fields in the Magellanic Stream. The\ncombination of great sensitivity to stars below the old main sequence turn off,\nand the multiplicity at Ks band (at least 12 epochs) make VMC highly suitable\nfor the determination of the spatially resolved star formation history and\nthree-dimensional geometry, using variable stars such as Cepheids and RR Lyrae\nstars. The VMC observations are progressing well and will be completed in 2018.\nThe VMC survey has a high legacy value and many science results have already\nbeen published, e.g. the most detailed star formation history map of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud, and others are in preparation, e.g. a comprehensive\ninvestigation of classical Cepheids and a study of the proper motion in the\nforeground 47 Tuc cluster.\n", "  We investigate the early part of the crystal nucleation process in the hard\nsphere fluid using data produced by computer simulation. We find that hexagonal\norder manifests continuously in the overcompressed liquid, beginning\napproximately one diffusion time before the appearance of the first\n`solid-like' particle of the nucleating cluster, and that a collective influx\nof particles towards the nucleation site occurs simultaneously to the ordering\nprocess: the density increases leading to nucleation are generated by the same\nindividual particle displacements as the increases in order. We rule out the\npresence of qualitative differences in the early nucleation process between\nmedium and low overcompressions, and also provide evidence against any\nseparation of translational and orientational order on the relevant\nlengthscales.\n", "  We discuss the existence and uniqueness of wavefunctions for inhomogenoeus\nboundary value problems associated to x^2y^2-type matrix model on a bounded\ndomain of R^2. Both properties involve a combination of the Cauchy-Kovalewski\nTheorem and a explicit calculations.\n", "  We compare the isotropic equivalent 15-2000 keV gamma-ray energy, E_gamma,\nemitted by a sample of 91 swift Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with known redshifts,\nwith the isotropic equivalent fireball energy, E_fb, as estimated within the\nfireball model framework from X-ray afterglow observations of these bursts. The\nuncertainty in E_gamma, which spans the range of ~10^51 erg to ~10^53.5 erg, is\napproximately 25% on average, due mainly to the extrapolation from the BAT\ndetector band to the 15-2000 keV band. The uncertainty in E_fb is approximately\na factor of 2, due mainly to the X-ray measurements' scatter. We find E_gamma\nand E_fb to be tightly correlated. The average(std) of {\\eta}^11hr_gamma is\napproximately log_10(E_gamma/(3{\\epsilon} _eE^11hr_fb)) are -0.34(0.60), and\nthe upper limit on the intrinsic spread of {\\eta}_gamma is approximately 0.5\n({\\epsilon}_e is the fraction of shocked plasma energy carried by electrons and\nE^x hr_fb is inferred from the X-ray flux at x hours). We also find that E_fb\ninferred from X-ray observations at 3 and 11 hours are similar, with an\naverage(std) of log_10(E^3hr_fb/E^11hr_fb) of 0.04(0.28). The small variance of\n{\\eta}_gamma implies that burst-to-burst variations in {\\epsilon}_e and in the\nefficiency of fireball energy conversion to gamma-rays are small, and suggests\nthat both are of order unity. The small variance of {\\eta}_gamma and the\nsimilarity of E^3hr_fb and E^11hr_fb further imply that {\\epsilon}_e does not\nvary significantly with shock Lorentz factor, and that for most bursts the\nmodification of fireball energy during the afterglow phase, by processes such\nas radiative losses or extended duration energy injection, are not significant.\nFinally, our results imply that if fireballs are indeed jets, then the jet\nopening angle satisfies {\\theta}>0.1 for most cases. [abridged]\n", "  The equations in conservative form for nonlinear waves modeling on a liquid\nfilm flowing down a vertical plane have been investigated. It has been found\nthat in the computational domain extended along the transverse axis the\nequations with boundary conditions are invariant under parity transformation.\nIt is numerically shown that for moderate Reynolds numbers the steady-state\ntravelling solutions of the equations have the detected symmetry. It is\ndemonstrated that using this symmetry for the numerical solution of the problem\nby Galerkin methods significantly increases the efficiency of calculations.\n", "  We study electric field quench in N=2 strongly coupled gauge theory, using\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence. To do so, we consider the aforementioned system\nwhich is subjected to a time-dependent electric field indicating an out of\nequilibrium system. Defining the equilibration time t_{eq}, at which the system\nrelaxes to its final equilibrium state after injecting the energy, we find that\nthe rescaled equilibriation time k^{-1}t_{eq} decreases as the transition time\nk increases. Therefore, we expect that for sufficiently large transition time,\nk ->infinity, the relaxation of the system to its final equilibrium can be an\nadiabatic process. On the other hand, we observe a universal behavior for the\nfast quenches, k << 1, meaning that the rescaled equilibration time does not\ndepend on the final value of the time-dependent electric field. Our\ncalculations generalized to systems in various dimensions also confirm\nuniversalization process which seems to be a typical feature of all strongly\ncoupled gauge theories that admit a gravitational dual.\n", "  An analysis is made of the conditions for ohmic contacts realization in the\ncase of Schottky contacts. Based on the classical notions about the mechanisms\nof current flow, we consider the generalized model of Schottky contact that\ntakes into account the thermionic current of majority charge carriers and\nrecombination current of minority charge carriers in Schottky contacts with a\ndielectric gap. An analysis of the results given by that model made it possible\nto obtain ohmicity criteria for Schottky contacts and compare the conditions\nfor low injection level and ohmicity of Schottky contacts in the case of\nsilicon-based contacts. It is shown that conditions for Schottky contact\nohmicity do not coincide with those for p-n junctions.\n", "  In this note we explicitly show how the generalization of the T-duality\nsymmetry of the supermembrane theory compactified in M9xT2 can be reduced to a\nparabolic subgroup of SL(2,Z) that acts non-linearly on the moduli parameters\nand on the KK and winding charges of the supermembrane. This is a first step\ntowards a deeper understanding of the dual relation between the parabolic type\nII gauged supergravity in nine dimensions.\n", "  We find that spin-polarized ground states emerge in nanofacets which are\nself-organized on SiC (0001) surfaces. Our large-scale density-functional\ncalculations reveal that the nanofacet formed by bunching of single bilayer\nsteps generates peculiar carbon dangling bond states localized at but extended\nalong step edges. The flat-band characteristics of those C states cause either\nferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic chains on covalent semiconductors.\n", "  We determined accurate positions for 3000 of the \"faint blue stars\" in the\nPHL (Palomar-Haro-Luyten) and Ton/TonS catalogues. These were published from\n1957 to 1962, and, aimed at finding new white dwarfs, provide approximate\npositions for about 10750 blue stellar objects. Some of these \"stars\" had\nbecome known as quasars, a type of objects unheard-of before 1963. We derived\nsubarcsec positions from a comparison of published finding charts with images\nfrom the first-epoch Digitized Sky Survey. Numerous objects are now well known,\nbut unfortunately neither their PHL or Ton numbers, nor their discoverers, are\nrecognized in current databases. A comparison with modern radio, IR, UV and\nX-ray surveys leads us to suggest that the fraction of extragalactic objects in\nthe PHL and Ton catalogues is at least 15 per cent. However, because we failed\nto locate the original PHL plates or finding charts, it may be impossible to\ncorrectly identify the remaining 7726 PHL objects.\n", "  We present a study of the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal transition of\nCaFe2As2 using angle-resolved photoemission experiments and dynamical mean\nfield theory-based electronic structure calculations. We observe that the\ncollapsed-tetragonal phase exhibits reduced correlations and a higher coherence\ntemperature due to the stronger Fe-As hybridization. Furthermore, a comparison\nof measured photoemission spectra and theoretical spectral functions shows that\nmomentum-dependent corrections to the density functional band structure are\nessential for the description of low-energy quasiparticle dispersions. We\nintroduce those using the recently proposed combined \"Screened Exchange +\nDynamical Mean Field Theory\" scheme.\n", "  We analyze spectral properties of the ultrarelativistic (Cauchy) operator\n$|\\Delta |^{1/2}$, provided its action is constrained exclusively to the\ninterior of the interval $[-1,1] \\subset R$. To this end both analytic and\nnumerical methods are employed. New high-accuracy spectral data are obtained. A\ndirect analytic proof is given that trigonometric functions $\\cos(n\\pi x/2)$\nand $\\sin(n\\pi x)$, for integer $n$ are {\\it not} the eigenfunctions of\n$|\\Delta |_D^{1/2}$, $D=(-1,1)$. This clearly demonstrates that the traditional\nFourier multiplier representation of $|\\Delta |^{1/2}$ becomes defective, while\npassing from $R$ to a bounded spatial domain $D\\subset R$.\n", "  Efficient techniques to navigate networks with local information are\nfundamental to sample large-scale online social systems and to retrieve\nresources in peer-to-peer systems. Biased random walks, i.e. walks whose motion\nis biased on properties of neighbouring nodes, have been largely exploited to\ndesign smart local strategies to explore a network, for instance by\nconstructing maximally mixing trajectories or by allowing an almost uniform\nsampling of the nodes. Here we introduce and study biased random walks on\nmultiplex networks, graphs where the nodes are related through different types\nof links organised in distinct and interacting layers, and we provide\nanalytical solutions for their long-time properties, including the stationary\noccupation probability distribution and the entropy rate. We focus on\ndegree-biased random walks and distinguish between two classes of walks, namely\nthose whose transition probability depends on a number of parameters which is\nextensive in the number of layers, and those whose motion depends on\nintrinsically multiplex properties of the neighbouring nodes. We analyse the\neffect of the structure of the multiplex network on the steady-state behaviour\nof the walkers, and we find that heterogeneous degree distributions as well as\nthe presence of inter-layer degree correlations and edge overlap determine the\nextent to which a multiplex can be efficiently explored by a biased walk.\nFinally we show that, in real-world multiplex transportation networks, the\ntrade-off between efficient navigation and resilience to link failure has\nresulted into systems whose diffusion properties are qualitatively different\nfrom those of appropriately randomised multiplex graphs. This fact suggests\nthat multiplexity is an important ingredient to include in the modelling of\nreal-world systems.\n", "  This paper investigates the process of knowledge exchange in inter-firm\nResearch and Development (R&D) alliances by means of an agent-based model.\nExtant research has pointed out that firms select alliance partners considering\nboth network-related and network-unrelated features (e.g., social capital\nversus complementary knowledge stocks). In our agent-based model, firms are\nlocated in a metric knowledge space. The interaction rules incorporate an\nexploration phase and a knowledge transfer phase, during which firms search for\na new partner and then evaluate whether they can establish an alliance to\nexchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters determining the overall\nsystem properties are the rate at which alliances form and dissolve and the\nagents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of performance,\nbased on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space. Remarkably,\nwe find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction\nradius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge\nspace, whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more\nimportantly, we find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the\nnetwork performance on both model parameters.\n", "  We show a simple mechanism for a dynamical CPT violation in the neutron\nsector. In particular, we show a {\\it CPT-violating see-saw mechanism},\ngenerating a Majorana mass and a CPT violating mass for the neutron.\nCPT-violating see-saw involves a sterile partner of the neutron, living in a\nhidden sector, in which CPT is spontaneously broken. In particular, neutrons\n(antineutrons) can communicate with the hidden sector through non-perturbative\nquantum gravity effects called {\\it exotic instantons}. Exotic instantons\ndynamically break R-parity, generating one effective vertex between the neutron\nand its sterile partner. In this way, we show how a small CPT violating mass\nterm for the neutron is naturally generated. This model can be tested in the\nnext generation of experiments in neutron-antineutron physics. This strongly\nmotivates researches of CPT-violating effects in neutron-antineutron physics,\nas a test-bed for dynamical CPT-violations in SM.\n", "  Solving intractable mathematical problems in simulators composed of atoms,\nions, photons or electrons has recently emerged as a subject of intense\ninterest. Here we extend this concept to phonons that are localised in\nspectrally pure resonances in an electromechanical system which enables their\ninteractions to be exquisitely fashioned via electrical means. We harness this\nplatform to emulate the Ising Hamiltonian whose spin 1/2 particles are\nreplicated by the phase bistable vibrations from a parametric resonance where\nmultiple resonances play the role of a spin bath. The coupling between the\nmechanical pseudo spins is created by generating thermomechanical two-mode\nsqueezed states which impart correlations between resonances that can imitate a\nferromagnetic, random or an anti-ferromagnetic state on demand. These results\nsuggest an electromechanical simulator for the Ising Hamiltonian could be built\nwith a large number of spins with multiple degrees of coupling, a task that\nwould overwhelm a conventional computer.\n", "  Spin current, i.e. the flow of spin angular momentum or magnetic moment, has\nrecently attracted much attention as the promising alternative for charge\ncurrent with better energy efficiency. Genuine spin current is generally\ncarried by the spin wave (propagating spin precession) in insulating\nferromagnets, and should hold the chiral symmetry when it propagates along the\nspin direction. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such a spin wave spin\ncurrent (SWSC) shows nonreciprocal propagation characters in a chiral-lattice\nferromagnet. This phenomenon originates from the interference of chirality\nbetween the SWSC and crystal-lattice, which is mediated by the relativistic\nspin-orbit interaction. The present finding enables the design of perfect spin\ncurrent diode, and highlights the importance of the chiral aspect in SWSC.\n", "  The bonding mechanism of ethene to a nickel or palladium center is studied by\nthe density matrix renormalization group algorithm, the complete active space\nself consistent field method, coupled cluster theory, and density functional\ntheory. Specifically, we focus on the interaction between the metal atom and\nbis-ethene ligands in perpendicular and parallel orientations. The bonding\nsituation in these structural isomers is further scrutinized using energy\ndecomposition analysis and quantum information theory. Our study highlights the\nfact that when two ethene ligands are oriented perpendicular to each other, the\ncomplex is stabilized by the metal-to-ligand double-back-bonding mechanism.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that nickel-ethene complexes feature a stronger and\nmore covalent interaction between the ligands and the metal center than\npalladium-ethene compounds with similar coordination spheres.\n", "  We consider the phenomenology of new neutral gauge bosons with flavour\nnon-diagonal couplings to fermions, inherent in 6D models explaining\nsuccessfully the hierarchy of masses as well as the mixing for quarks, charged\nleptons and neutrinos (this model can in particular be credited with the\ncorrect prediction of the neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$). We present a\ngeneral relation between masses of new gauge bosons and their couplings to\nfermions. We show that in the current realization of the model, the new heavy\nbosons are unreachable at LHC but argue why the constraint could be relaxed in\nthe context of a different realization. In view of a more systematic study, we\nuse an effective model inspired by the above to relate directly rare meson\ndecays to possible LHC observations. In terms of effective Lagrangians, this\ncan be seen as the introduction in the model of only one overall scaling\nparameter to extend our approach without modifying the 4D (gauge) structure.\n", "  A mass of traces of human activities show rich dynamic patterns. In this\narticle, we comprehensively investigate the dynamic patterns of 50 thousands of\nresearchers' activities in Sciencenet, the largest multi-disciplinary academic\ncommunity in China. Through statistical analyses, we found that (i) there\nexists a power-law scaling between the frequency of visits to an academic forum\nand the number of corresponding visitors, with the exponent being about 1.33;\n(ii) the expansion process of academic forums obeys the Heaps' law, namely the\nnumber of distinct visited forums to the number of visits grows in a power-law\nform with exponent being about 0.54; (iii) the probability distributions of\ntime intervals and the number of visits taken to revisit the same academic\nforum both follow power-laws, indicating the existence of memory effect in\nacademic forum activities. On the basis of these empirical results, we propose\na dynamic model that incorporates the exploration, preferential return and\nmemory effect, which can well reproduce the observed scaling laws.\n", "  We present a theory of large-scale dynamo action in a turbulent flow that has\nstochastic, zero-mean fluctuations of the $\\alpha$ parameter. Particularly\ninteresting is the possibility of the growth of the mean magnetic field due to\nMoffatt drift, which is expected to be finite in a statistically anisotropic\nturbulence. We extend the Kraichnan-Moffatt model to explore effects of finite\nmemory of $\\alpha$ fluctuations, in a spirit similar to that of Sridhar & Singh\n(2014), hereafter SS14. Using the first-order smoothing approximation, we\nderive a linear integro-differential equation governing the dynamics of the\nlarge-scale magnetic field, which is non-perturbative in the\n$\\alpha$-correlation time $\\tau_{\\alpha}$. We recover earlier results in the\nexactly solvable white-noise (WN) limit where the Moffatt drift does not\ncontribute to the dynamo growth/decay. To study finite memory effects, we\nreduce the integro-differential equation to a partial differential equation by\nassuming that the $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ be small but nonzero and the large-scale\nmagnetic field is slowly varying. We derive the dispersion relation and provide\nexplicit expression for the growth rate as a function of four independent\nparameters. When $\\tau_{\\alpha}\\neq 0$, we find that: (i) in the absence of the\nMoffatt drift, but with finite Kraichnan diffusivity, only strong\n$\\alpha$-fluctuations can enable a mean-field dynamo; (ii) in the general case\nwhen also the Moffatt drift is nonzero, both, weak or strong $\\alpha$\nfluctuations, can lead to a large-scale dynamo; and (iii) there always exists a\nwavenumber ($k$) cutoff at some large $k$ beyond which the growth rate turns\nnegative. Thus we show that a finite Moffatt drift can always facilitate\nlarge-scale dynamo action if sufficiently strong, even in case of weak $\\alpha$\nfluctuations, and the maximum growth occurs at intermediate wavenumbers.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling characterizes quantum systems such as atoms, nuclei,\nhypernuclei, quarkonia, etc., and is essential for understanding their\nspectroscopic properties. Depending on the system, the effect of spin-orbit\ncoupling on shell structure is large in nuclei, small in quarkonia,\nperturbative in atoms. In the standard non-relativistic reduction of the\nsingle-particle Dirac equation, we derive a universal rule for the relative\nmagnitude of the spin-orbit effect that applies to very different quantum\nsystems, regardless of whether the spin-orbit coupling originates from the\nstrong or electromagnetic interaction. It is shown that in nuclei the near\nequality of the mass of the nucleon and the difference between the large\nrepulsive and attractive potentials explains the fact that spin-orbit\nsplittings are comparable to the energy spacing between major shells. For a\nspecific ratio between the particle mass and the effective potential whose\ngradient determines the spin-orbit force, we predict the occurrence of giant\nspin-orbit energy splittings that dominate the single-particle excitation\nspectrum.\n", "  Galactic HI (neutral hydrogen) shells are central to our understanding of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), which plays a key role in the development and\nevolution of galaxies, including our own. Several models involving supernovae\nand stellar winds have contributed to our broad understanding, but a complete,\ndetailed picture remains elusive. To extend existing Galactic shell catalogs,\nwe visually examined the SETHI (Search for Extraterrestrial HI) database to\nidentify shell-like structures. This high-sensitivity 21-cm radio survey\ncovering the Arecibo sky uniquely provides high-resolution data on shells at a\nwide range of Galactic latitudes. We present basic information (location,\nradial velocity, angular size, shape) for 74 previously unidentified HI shells.\nDue to limitations of coverage and data quality, and the biases inherent in\nsearch techniques, our catalog is not a complete sample of Galactic shells. We\ndiscuss the catalog completeness, and comment on the new shells' relationship\nwith known interstellar structure as warranted. Unlike many previous catalogs,\nthis sample is not biased towards expanding shells. Where possible we also\nestimate the kinematic distances, physical sizes, expansion velocities, and\nenergies of these shells. Overall, they are relatively large and old, each the\nresult of multiple supernovae. Unlike previous surveys, we do not find that the\nshells in our sample are preferentially aligned relative to the Galactic plane.\n", "  It is shown that a generalization of Bethe Ansatz based on an utilization of\n{\\it degenerative discrete-diffractive} wave functions solves the three-magnon\nproblem for the $S=1$ isotropic ferromagnetic infinite chain. The four-magnon\nproblem is briefly discussed.\n", "  Experiments with pedestrians could depend strongly on initial conditions.\nComparisons of the results of such experiments require to distinguish carefully\nbetween transient state and steady state. In this work, a feasible algorithm -\nCumulative Sum Control Chart - is proposed and improved to automatically detect\nsteady states from density and speed time series of bottleneck experiments. The\nthreshold of the detection parameter in the algorithm is calibrated using an\nautoregressive model. Comparing the detected steady states with previous\nmanually selected ones, the modified algorithm gives more reproducible results.\nFor the applications, three groups of bottleneck experiments are analysed and\nthe steady states are detected. The study about pedestrian flow shows that the\ndifference between the flows in all states and in steady state mainly depends\non the ratio of pedestrian number to bottleneck width. When the ratio is higher\nthan a critical value (approximately 115 persons/m), the flow in all states is\nalmost identical with the flow in steady state. Thus we have more possibilities\nto compare the flows from different experiments, especially when the detection\nof steady states is difficult.\n", "  Recent developments toward the production and laboratory use of pulses of\nhigh intensity, and/or of very high frequency, and/or of ultrashort duration,\nmake possible experiments which can produce time-resolved data on ultrafast\ntransformations involving motions of electrons. The formulation, quantitative\nunderstanding and prediction of related new phenomena entail the possibility of\ncomputing and applying solutions of the many-electron time-dependent\nSchroedinger equation, for arbitrary electronic structures, including the\ndominant effects of Rydberg series, of multiply excited states and of the\nmulti-channel continuous spectrum. To this purpose, we have proposed and\napplied to many prototypical cases the state-specific expansion approach\n(SSEA). (Mercouris, Komninos and Nicolaides, Adv. Quantum Chem. 60, 333\n(2010)). The paper explains briefly the SSEA, and outlines four of its\napplications to recently formulated problems concerning time-resolved\nelectronic processes, where electron correlations are crucial. These are, 1)\nThe time resolution of the decay of polyelectronic unstable states, 2) The\nexcitation and decay of strongly correlating doubly excited states and\natto-time-resolution of their geometries, 3) The time-resolved process of\nformation of the interference profiles of resonance states during the\nfemtosecond photoionization of Helium and Aluminum, and 4) The relative time\ndelay in the (2s,2p) photoionization of Neon by an attosecond pulse.\n", "  We extend the Weak Crystallization theory to the case of metallic alloys. The\nadditional ingredient -- itinerant electrons -- generates nontrivial dependence\nof free energy on the angles between ordering wave vectors of ionic density.\nThat leads to stabilization of FCC, Rhombohedral, and icosahedral\nquasicrystalline (iQC) phases, which are absent in the generic theory with only\nlocal interactions. The condition for stability of iQC that we find, is\nconsistent with the Hume-Rothery rules known empirically for majority of stable\niQC; namely, the length of the primary Bragg peak wavevector is approximately\nequal to the diameter of the Fermi surface.\n", "  When a classical system is driven through a continuous phase transition, its\nnonequilibrium response is universal and exhibits Kibble-Zurek scaling. We\nexplore this dynamical scaling in the novel context of a three-dimensional\ntopological magnet with fractionalized excitations, namely the liquid-gas\ntransition of the emergent mobile magnetic monopoles in dipolar spin ice. Using\nfield-mixing and finite-size scaling techniques, we place the critical point of\nthe liquid-gas line in the three-dimensional Ising universality class. We then\ndemonstrate Kibble-Zurek scaling for sweeps of the magnetic field through the\ncritical point. Unusually slow microscopic time scales in spin ice offer a\nunique opportunity to detect this universal nonequilibrium physics in current\nexperimental setups.\n", "  Nonlinear wave propagation in parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric\nlocalized potentials is investigated analytically near a phase-transition point\nwhere a pair of real eigenvalues of the potential coalesce and bifurcate into\nthe complex plane. Necessary conditions for phase transition to occur are\nderived based on a generalization of the Krein signature. Using multi-scale\nperturbation analysis, a reduced nonlinear ODE model is derived for the\namplitude of localized solutions near phase transition. Above phase transition,\nthis ODE model predicts a family of stable solitons not bifurcating from linear\n(infinitesimal) modes under a certain sign of nonlinearity. In addition, it\npredicts periodically-oscillating nonlinear modes away from solitons. Under the\nopposite sign of nonlinearity, it predicts unbounded growth of solutions. Below\nphase transition, solution dynamics is predicted as well. All analytical\nresults are compared to direct computations of the full system and good\nagreement is observed.\n", "  The chiral Fe-based langasites represent model systems of triangle-based\nfrustrated magnets with a strong potential for multiferroicity. We report\nneutron scattering measurements for the multichiral Ba3MFe3Si2O14 (M = Nb, Ta)\nlangasites revealing new important features of the magnetic order of these\nsystems: the bunching of the helical modulation along the c-axis and the\nin-plane distortion of the 120{\\textdegree} Fe-spin arrangement. We discuss\nthese subtle features in terms of the microscopic spin Hamiltonian, and provide\nthe link to the magnetically-induced electric polarization observed in these\nsystems. Thus, our findings put the multiferroicity of this attractive family\nof materials on solid ground.\n", "  The goal of this note is to prove a analogue of the Littewood-Paley\ndecomposition for densities of operators and to use it in the context of\nLieb-Thirring inequalities.\n", "  We investigate structure formation in a one dimensional model of a\nmatter-dominated universe using a quasi-newtonian formulation. In addition to\ndark matter, luminous matter is introduced to examine the potential bias in the\ndistributions. We use multifractal analysis techniques to identify structures,\nincluding clusters and voids. Both dark matter and luminous matter exhibit\nfractal geometry as the universe evolves over a finite range. We present the\nresults for the generalized dimensions computed on various scales for each\nmatter distribution. We compare and contrast the fractal dimensions of two\ntypes of matter for the first time and show how dynamical considerations cause\nthem to differ.\n", "  We consider a three-dimensional chaotic system consisting of the suspension\nof Arnold's cat map coupled with a clock via a weak dissipative interaction. We\nshow that the coupled system displays a synchronization phenomenon, in the\nsense that the relative phase between the suspension flow and the clock locks\nto a special value, thus making the motion fall onto a lower dimensional\nattractor. More specifically, we construct the attractive invariant manifold,\nof dimension smaller than three, using a convergent perturbative expansion.\nMoreover, we compute via convergent series the Lyapunov exponents, including\nnotably the central one. The result generalizes a previous construction of the\nattractive invariant manifold in a similar but simpler model. The main novelty\nof the current construction relies in the computation of the Lyapunov spectrum,\nwhich consists of non-trivial analytic exponents. Some conjectures about a\npossible smoothening transition of the attractor as the coupling is increased\nare also discussed.\n", "  History, status and plans of the search for critical behavior of strongly\ninteracting matter created in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN Super\nProton Synchrotron is reviewed. In particular, it is expected that the search\nshould answer the question whether the critical point of strongly interacting\nmatter exists and, if it does, where it is located.\n  First, the search strategies are presented and a short introduction is given\nto expected fluctuation signals and to the quantities used by experiments to\ndetect th The most important background effects are also discussed.\n  Second, relevant experimental results are summarized and discussed. It is\nintriguing that both the fluctuations of quantities integrated over the full\nexperimental acceptance (event multiplicity and transverse momentum) as well as\nthe bin size dependence of the second factorial moment of pion and proton\nmultiplicities in medium-sized Si+Si collisions at 158A GeV/c suggest critical\nbehaviour of the created matter.\n  These results provide strong motivation for the ongoing systematic scan of\nthe phase diagram by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the SPS and the continuing\nsearch at the Brookhaven Relativistic Hadron Collider.\n", "  The possible phases and the nano-scale particle correlations of\ntwo-dimensional interacting dipolar particles is a long-sought problem in\nmany-body physics. Here we observe a spontaneous condensation of trapped\ntwo-dimensional dipolar excitons with internal spin degrees of freedom from an\ninteracting gas into a high density, closely packed liquid state made mostly of\ndark dipoles. Another phase transition, into a bright, highly repulsive plasma\nis observed at even higher excitation powers. The dark liquid state is formed\nbelow a critical temperature $T_c \\approx 4.8K$, and it is manifested by a\nclear spontaneous spatial condensation to a smaller and denser cloud,\nsuggesting an attractive part to the interaction which goes beyond the purely\nrepulsive dipole-dipole forces. Contributions from quantum mechanical\nfluctuations are expected to be significant in this strongly correlated, long\nliving dark liquid. This is a new example of a two-dimensional atomic-like\ninteracting dipolar quantum liquid, but where the coupling of light to its\ninternal spin degrees of freedom plays a crucial role in the dynamical\nformation and the nature of resulting ground state.\n", "  The \"Wide Area VISTA Extra-galactic Survey\" (WAVES) is a 4MOST Consortium\nDesign Reference Survey which will use the VISTA/4MOST facility to\nspectroscopically survey ~2million galaxies to $r_{\\rm AB} < 22$ mag. WAVES\nconsists of two interlocking galaxy surveys (\"WAVES-Deep\" and \"WAVES-Wide\"),\nproviding the next two steps beyond the highly successful 1M galaxy Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey and the 250k Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. WAVES will\nenable an unprecedented study of the distribution and evolution of mass,\nenergy, and structures extending from 1-kpc dwarf galaxies in the local void to\nthe morphologies of 200-Mpc filaments at $z\\sim1$. A key aim of both surveys\nwill be to compare comprehensive empirical observations of the spatial\nproperties of galaxies, groups, and filaments, against state-of-the-art\nnumerical simulations to distinguish between various Dark Matter models.\n", "  We have started a systematic search of strong lens candidates in the ESO\npublic survey KiDS based on the visual inspection of massive galaxies in the\nredshift range $0.1<z<0.5$. As a pilot program we have inspected 100 sq. deg.,\nwhich overlap with SDSS and where there are known lenses to use as a control\nsample. Taking advantage of the superb image quality of VST/OmegaCAM, the\ncolour information and accurate model subtracted images, we have found 18 new\nlens candidates, for which spectroscopic confirmation will be needed to confirm\ntheir lensing nature and study the mass profile of the lensing galaxies.\n", "  The ESO Public Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) is an optical wide-field imaging\nsurvey carried out with the VLT Survey Telescope and the OmegaCAM camera. KiDS\nwill scan 1500 square degrees in four optical filters (u, g, r, i). Designed to\nbe a weak lensing survey, it is ideal for galaxy evolution studies, thanks to\nthe high spatial resolution of VST, the good seeing and the photometric depth.\nThe surface photometry have provided with structural parameters (e.g. size and\nS\\'ersic index), aperture and total magnitudes have been used to derive\nphotometric redshifts from Machine learning methods and stellar\nmasses/luminositites from stellar population synthesis. Our project aimed at\ninvestigating the evolution of the colour and structural properties of galaxies\nwith mass and environment up to redshift $z \\sim 0.5$ and more, to put\nconstraints on galaxy evolution processes, as galaxy mergers.\n", "  We present the methods and first results of the search for galaxy clusters in\nthe Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). The adopted algorithm and the criterium for\nselecting the member galaxies are illustrated. Here we report the preliminary\nresults obtained over a small area (7 sq. degrees), and the comparison of our\ncluster candidates with those found in the RedMapper and SZ Planck catalogues;\nthe analysis to a larger area (148 sq. degrees) is currently in progress. By\nthe KiDS cluster search, we expect to increase the completeness of the clusters\ncatalogue to z = 0.6-0.7 compared to RedMapper.\n", "  We study the total density distribution in the central regions ($<\\, 1$\neffective radius, $R_{\\rm e}$) of early-type galaxies (ETGs), using data from\nthe SPIDER survey. We model each galaxy with two components (dark matter halo +\nstars), exploring different assumptions for the dark matter (DM) halo profile,\nand leaving stellar mass-to-light ($M_{\\rm \\star}/L$) ratios as free fitting\nparameters to the data. For a Navarro et al. (1996) profile, the slope of the\ntotal mass profile is non-universal. For the most massive and largest ETGs, the\nprofile is isothermal in the central regions ($\\sim R_{\\rm e}/2$), while for\nthe low-mass and smallest systems, the profile is steeper than isothermal, with\nslopes similar to those for a constant-M/L profile. For a concentration-mass\nrelation steeper than that expected from simulations, the correlation of\ndensity slope with mass tends to flatten. Our results clearly point to a\n\"non-homology\" in the total mass distribution of ETGs, which simulations of\ngalaxy formation suggest may be related to a varying role of dissipation with\ngalaxy mass.\n", "  The Kilo Degree survey (KiDS) is a large-scale optical imaging survey carried\nout with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST), which is the ideal tool for galaxy\nevolution studies. We expect to observe millions of galaxies for which we\nextract the structural parameters in four wavebands (u, g, r and i). This\nsample will represent the largest dataset with measured structural parameters\nup to a redshift $z=0.5$. In this paper we will introduce the sample, and\ndescribe the 2D fitting procedure using the 2DPHOT environment and the\nvalidation of the parameters with an external catalog.\n", "  Machine learning techniques offer a plethora of opportunities in tackling big\ndata within the astronomical community. We present the set of Generalized\nLinear Models as a fast alternative for determining photometric redshifts of\ngalaxies, a set of tools not commonly applied within astronomy, despite being\nwidely used in other professions. With this technique, we achieve catastrophic\noutlier rates of the order of ~1%, that can be achieved in a matter of seconds\non large datasets of size ~1,000,000. To make these techniques easily\naccessible to the astronomical community, we developed a set of libraries and\ntools that are publicly available.\n", "  The Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey (S7) is a\ntargeted survey probing the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of a representative\nsample of ~140 nearby (z<0.02) Seyfert galaxies by means of optical integral\nfield spectroscopy. The survey is based on a homogeneous data set observed\nusing the Wide Field Spectrograph WiFeS. The data provide a 25x38 arcsec$^2$\nfield-of-view around the galaxy centre at typically ~1.5 arcsec spatial\nresolution and cover a wavelength range between ~3400 - 7100 $\\AA$ at spectral\nresolutions of ~100 km s$^{-1}$ and ~50 km s$^{-1}$ in the blue and red parts,\nrespectively. The survey is primarily designed to study gas excitation and star\nformation around AGN, with a special focus on the shape of the AGN ionising\ncontinuum, the interaction between radio jets and the NLR gas, and the nature\nof nuclear LINER emission. We provide an overview of the current status of\nS7-based results and present new results for NGC 6300.\n", "  We measure the angular two-point correlation and angular power spectrum from\nthe NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) of radio galaxies. They are found to be\nconsistent with the best-fit cosmological model from the Planck analysis, and\nwith the redshift distribution obtained from the Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of\nRadio Sources (CENSORS). Our analysis is based on an optimal estimation of the\ntwo-point correlation function and makes use of a new mask, that takes into\naccount direction dependent effects of the observations, sidelobe effects of\nbright sources and galactic foreground. We also set a flux threshold and take\nthe cosmic radio dipole into account. The latter turns out to be an essential\nstep in the analysis. This improved cosmological analysis of the NVSS\nemphasizes the importance of a flux calibration that is robust and stable on\nlarge angular scales for future radio continuum surveys.\n", "  The optical Galactic Plane H$\\alpha$ surveys IPHAS and VPHAS+ are\ndramatically improving our understanding of Galactic stellar populations and\nstellar evolution by providing large samples of stars in short lived, but\nimportant, evolutionary phases, and high quality homogeneous photometry and\nimages over the entire Galactic Plane. Here I summarise some of the\ncontributions these surveys have already made to our understanding of a number\nof key areas of stellar and Galactic astronomy.\n", "  A lattice QCD study of the strong decay width and coupling constant of\ndecuplet baryons to an octet baryon - pion state is presented. The transfer\nmatrix method is used to obtain the overlap of lattice states with decuplet\nbaryon quantum numbers on the one hand and octet baryon-pion quantum numbers on\nthe other as an approximation to the matrix element of the corresponding\ntransition. By making use of leading order effective field theory, the coupling\nconstants, as well as the widths for the various decay channels are determined.\nThe transitions studied are $ \\Delta \\to \\pi \\,N$, $\\Sigma^* \\to \\Lambda\\,\\pi$,\n$\\Sigma^* \\to \\Sigma\\,\\pi$ and $\\Xi^* \\to \\Xi\\,\\pi$. We obtain results for two\nensembles of $N_f=2+1$ dynamical fermion configurations, one using domain wall\nvalence quarks on a staggered sea at a pion mass of $350\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and a\nbox size of $3.4\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ and a second one using domain wall sea and\nvalence quarks at pion mass $180\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and box size\n$4.5\\,\\mathrm{fm}$.\n", "  We prove almost sure ergodic theorems for a class of systems called\nquasistatic dynamical systems. These results are needed, because the usual\ntheorem due to Birkhoff does not apply in the absence of invariant measures. We\nalso introduce the concept of a physical family of measures for a quasistatic\ndynamical system. These objects manifest themselves, for instance, in numerical\nexperiments. We then verify the conditions of the theorems and identify\nphysical families of measures for two concrete models, quasistatic expanding\nsystems and quasistatic dispersing billiards.\n", "  Scalar tetraquark states are studied within the diquark-antidiquark picture\nin a non-relativistic approach. We consider two types of confining potentials,\na quadratic and a linear one, to which we also add spin-spin, isospin-isospin,\nand spin-isospin interactions. We calculate the masses of the scalar diquarks\nand of the ground-state open and hidden charmed and bottom scalar tetraquarks.\nOur results indicate that the scalar resonances $D_{0}^{\\ast}(2400)$ and\n$D_{s}(2632)$ have a sizable tetraquark amount in their wave function, while,\non the other hand, it turns out that the scalar states $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$\nand $X(3915)$ should not be considered as being predominantly\ndiquark-antidiquark bound states. We also investigate the masses of light\nscalar diquarks and tetraquarks, which are comparable to the measured masses of\nthe light scalar mesons.\n", "  We have investigated the pressure effect on the newly discovered samarium\ndoped La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors. More than threefold increase in Tc\n(10.3 K) is observed with external pressure (at ~1.74 GPa at a rate of 4.08\nK/GPa)) for x = 0.2 composition. There is a concomitant large improvement in\nthe quality of the superconducting transition. Beyond this pressure Tc\ndecreases monotonously at the rate of -2.09 K/GPa. In the x = 0.8 sample, we do\nnot observe any enhancement in Tc with application of pressure (up to 1.76\nGPa). The semiconducting behavior observed in the normal state resistivity of\nboth of the samples is significantly subdued with the application of pressure\nwhich, if interpreted invoking thermal activation process, implies that the\nactivation energy gap of the carriers is significantly reduced with pressure.\nWe believe these observations should generate further interest in the\nLa1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors.\n", "  Molecular clouds typically consist of 3/4 H2, 1/4 He and traces of heavier\nelements. In an earlier work we showed that at very low temperatures and high\ndensities, H2 can be in a phase transition leading to the formation of ice\nclumps as large as comets or even planets. However, He has very different\nchemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions. The gravitational stability of fluid\nmixtures has been studied before, but these studies did not include a phase\ntransition.\n  First, we study the gravitational stability of van der Waals fluid mixtures\nusing linearized analysis and examine virial equilibrium conditions using the\nLennard-Jones intermolecular potential. Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and\ngravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied\nvia computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.\n  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid\nmixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition\nbecause compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase\nfraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some\nconditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the\nconverse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is\nessential. Contrary to spherical or filamentary collapses, sheet-like collapses\nstarting below 15K easily reach H2 condensation conditions because then they\nare fastest and both the increase of heating and opacity are limited.\n  Depending on density, temperature and mass, either rocky H2 planetoids, or\ngaseous He planetoids form. H2 planetoids are favoured by high density, low\ntemperature and low mass, while He planetoids need more mass and can form at\ntemperature well above the critical value.\n", "  This work makes use of the VST observations to select variable sources. We\nuse also the IR photometry, SED fitting and X-ray information where available\nto confirm the nature of the AGN candidates. The IR data, available over the\nfull survey area, allow to confirm the consistency of the variability selection\nwith the IR color selection method, while the detection of variability may\nprove useful to detect the presence of an AGN in IR selected starburst\ngalaxies.\n", "  We present a general framework of Griffiths inequalities for quantum systems.\nOur approach is based on operator inequalities associated with self-dual cones\nand provides a consistent viewpoint of the Griffiths inequality. As examples,\nwe discuss the quantum Ising model, quantum rotor model, Bose--Hubbard model,\nHubbard model, and spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model. We present a\nmodel-independent structure that governs the correlation inequalities.\n", "  Electric-magnetic dualities are equivalence between strong and weak coupling\nconstants. A standard example is the exchange of electric and magnetic fields\nin an abelian gauge theory. We show three methods to perform electric-magnetic\ndualities in the case of the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory. The first\nmethod is to use covariant field strengths to be the electric and magnetic\nfields. We find an invariant form of an equation of motion after performing the\nelectric-magnetic duality. The second method is to use the Seiberg-Witten map\nto rewrite the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory in terms of abelian field\nstrength. The third method is to use the large Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz\n(NS-NS) background limit (non-commutativity parameter only has one degree of\nfreedom) to consider the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory or D3-brane. In\nthis limit, we introduce or dualize a new one-form gauge potential to get a\nD3-brane in a large Ramond-Ramond (R-R) background via field redefinition. We\nalso use perturbation to study the equivalence between two D3-brane theories.\nComparison of these methods in the non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory gives\ndifferent physical implications. The comparison reflects the differences\nbetween the non-abelian and non-commutative gauge theories in the\nelectric-magnetic dualities. For a complete study, we also extend our studies\nto the simplest abelian and non-abelian $p$-form gauge theories, and a\nnon-commutative theory with the non-abelian structure.\n", "  The tunneling conductance in the half-metal/conical magnet/superconductor\n(HM/CM/SC) is investigated by the use of the combined Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk\n(BTK) formalism and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. We show that the\nconductance calculated self-consistently differs significantly from the one\ncalculated in the non-self-consistent framework. The use of the self-consistent\nprocedure ensures that the charge conservation is satisfied. Due to the spin\nband separation in the HM, the conductance in the subgap region is mainly\ndetermined by the anomalous Andreev reflection the probability of which\nstrongly depends on the spin transmission in the CM layer. We show that the\nspin of electron injected from the HM can be transmitted through the CM to the\nSC adiabatically or non-adiabatically depending on the period of the exchange\nfield modulation. We find that the conductance in the subgap region oscillates\nas a function of the CM layer thickness wherein the oscillations transform from\nirregular, in the non-adiabatic regime, to regular in the adiabatic case. In\nthe non-adiabatic regime the decrease of the exchange field amplitude in the CM\nleads to the emergence of the conductance peak for one particular CM thickness\nin agreement with experiment [J.W.A Robinson, J. D. S Witt and M. G. Blamire,\nScience 329, 5987]. For both transport regimes the conductance is analyzed over\na broad range of parameters determining the spiral magnetization in the CM.\n", "  Because pressure is determined globally for the incompressible Euler\nequations, a localized change to the initial velocity will have an immediate\neffect throughout space. For solutions to be physically meaningful, one would\nexpect such effects to decrease with distance from the localized change, giving\nthe solutions a type of stability. Indeed, this is the case for solutions\nhaving spatial decay, as can be easily shown. We consider the more difficult\ncase of solutions lacking spatial decay, and show that such stability still\nholds, albeit in a somewhat weaker form.\n", "  Within the scope of Bianchi type-I cosmological model the role of spinor\nfield on the evolution of the Universe is investigated. In doing so we have\nconsidered a polynomial type of nonlinearity. It is found that depending on the\nsign of self-coupling constant the model allows either accelerated mode of\nexpansion or oscillatory mode of evolution. Unlike general Bianchi type-I and\nBianchi type $VI_0$ models in this case neither mass term nor the nonlinear\nterm in the Lagrangian of spinor field vanish.\n", "  In this work we present a multilayer shallow model to approximate the\nNavier-Stokes equations with hydrostatic pressure and the $\\mu(I)$-rheology.\nThe main advantages of this approximation are (i) the low cost associated with\nthe numerical treatment of the free surface of the modelled flows, (ii) exact\nconservation of mass and (iii) the ability to compute 3D profiles of the\nvelocities in the directions along and normal to the slope. The derivation of\nthe model follows [14] and introduces a dimensional analysis based on the\nshallow flow hypothesis. The proposed first order multilayer model fully\nsatisfies a dissipative energy equation. A comparison with an analytical\nsolution with a non-constant normal profile of the downslope velocity\ndemonstrates the accuracy of the numerical model. Finally, by comparing the\nnumerical results with experimental data, we show that the proposed multilayer\nmodel with the $\\mu(I)$-rheology reproduces qualitatively the effect of the\nerodible bed on granular flow dynamics and deposits, such as the increase of\nrunout distance with increasing thickness of the erodible bed. We show that the\nuse of a constant friction coefficient in the multilayer model leads to the\nopposite behaviour. This multilayer model captures the different normal\nprofiles of the downslope velocity during the different phases of the flow\n(acceleration, stopping, etc.) including the presence of static and flowing\nzones within the granular column.\n", "  In recent experiments with ion traps, long-range interactions were associated\nwith the exceptionally fast propagation of perturbation, while in some\ntheoretical works they have also been related with the suppression of\npropagation. Here, we show that such apparently contradictory behavior is\ncaused by a general property of long-range interacting systems, which we name\n\"Cooperative Shielding\". It refers to shielded subspaces that emerge as the\nsystem size increases and inside of which the evolution is unaffected by\nlong-range interactions for a long time. As a result, the dynamics strongly\ndepends on the initial state: if it belongs to a shielded subspace, the\nspreading of perturbation satisfies the Lieb-Robinson bound and may even be\nsuppressed, while for initial states with components in various subspaces, the\npropagation may be quasi-instantaneous. We establish an analogy between the\nshielding effect and the onset of quantum Zeno subspaces. The derived effective\nZeno Hamiltonian successfully describes the short-ranged dynamics inside the\nsubspaces up to a time scale that increases with system size. Cooperative\nShielding can be tested in current experiments with trapped ions.\n", "  We investigate the Josephson effect in one triple-terminal junction with\nembedded parallel-coupled double quantum dots. It is found that the\ninter-superconductor supercurrent has opportunities to oscillate in $4\\pi$\nperiod, with the adjustment of the phase differences among the superconductors.\nWhat is notable is that such a result is robust and independent of fermion\nparities, intradot Coulomb strength, and the dot-superconductor coupling\nmanner. By introducing the concept of spinful many-particle Majorana modes, we\npresent the analytical definition of the Majorana operator via superposing\nelectron and hole operators. It can be believed that this work provide a simple\nbut feasible proposal for the realization of Majorana modes in a nonmagnetic\nsystem.\n", "  I first review the status of Digital Sky Surveys. The focus will be on\nextragalactic surveys with an area of more than 100 sq.deg. The Sloan Digital\nSky Survey is the archetype of such imaging surveys and it is its great success\nthat has prompted great activity in this field. The latest surveys explore\nwider, fainter and higher resolution and also a longer wavelength range than\nSDSS. Many of these surveys overlap particularly in the S Hemisphere where we\nnow have Pan-STARRS, DES and the ESO VST surveys, and our aim here is to\ncompare their properties. Since there is no dedicated article on the VST ATLAS\nin this symposium, we shall especially review the properties of this particular\nsurvey. This easily fits onto our other main focus which is to compare\noverlapping Southern Surveys and see how they best fit with the available NIR\nimaging data. We conclude that the Southern Hemisphere will soon overtake the\nNorth in terms of multiwavelength imaging. However we note that the South has\nmore limited opportunities for spectroscopic follow-up and this weakness will\npersist during the LSST era. Some new perspectives are offered on this and\nother aspects of survey astronomy.\n", "  A phenomenology of magnetic chiral damping is proposed in the context of\nmagnetic materials lacking inversion symmetry breaking. We show that the\nmagnetic damping tensor adopts a general form that accounts for a component\nlinear in magnetization gradient in the form of Lifshitz invariants. We propose\ndifferent microscopic mechanisms that can produce such a damping in\nferromagnetic metals, among which spin pumping in the presence of anomalous\nHall effect and an effective \"$s$-$d$\" Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric\nexchange. The implication of this chiral damping in terms of domain wall motion\nis investigated in the flow and creep regimes. These predictions have major\nimportance in the context of field- and current-driven texture motion in\nnoncentrosymmetric (ferro-, ferri-, antiferro-)magnets, not limited to metals.\n", "  We present a study of the environment of barred galaxies using galaxies drawn\nfrom the SDSS. We use several different statistics to quantify the environment:\nthe projected two-point cross-correlation function, the background-subtracted\nnumber count of neighbor galaxies, the overdensity of the local environment,\nthe membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central and\nsatellite systems, and for central galaxies we estimate the stellar to halo\nmass ratio (M$_{\\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\\mathrm{h}}$) . When we split our sample into\nearly- and late-type galaxies, we see a weak but significant trend for\nearly-type galaxies with a bar to be more strongly clustered on scales from a\nfew 100 kpc to 1 Mpc when compared to unbarred early-type galaxies. This\nindicates that the presence of a bar in early-type galaxies depends on the\nlocation within their host dark matter halos. This is confirmed by the group\ncatalog in the sense that for early-types, the fraction of central galaxies is\nsmaller if they have a bar. For late-type galaxies, we find fewer neighbors\nwithin $\\sim50$ kpc around the barred galaxies when compared to unbarred\ngalaxies from the control sample, suggesting that tidal forces from close\ncompanions suppress the formation/growth of bars. For central late-type\ngalaxies, bars are more common on galaxies with high\nM$_{\\mathrm{*}}/$M$_{\\mathrm{h}}$ values, as expected from early theoretical\nworks which showed that systems with massive dark matter halos are more stable\nagainst bar instabilities. Finally, we find no obvious correlation between\noverdensity and the bars in our sample, showing that galactic bars are not\nobviously linked to the large-scale structure of the universe.\n", "  In this paper we address the question: To what extent is the quantum state\npreparation of multiatom clusters (before they are injected into the microwave\ncavity) instrumental for determining not only the kind of machine we may\noperate but also the quantitative bounds of its performance? Figuratively\nspeaking, if the multiatom cluster is the \"crude oil\", the question is: Which\npreparation of the cluster is the refining process that can deliver a\n\"gasoline\" with a \"specific octane\"? We classify coherences or quantum\ncorrelations among the atoms according to their ability to serve as (i) fuel\nfor nonthermal machines corresponding to atomic states whose coherences\ndisplace or squeeze the cavity field, as well as cause its heating; and (ii)\nfuel which is purely \"combustible\", i.e., corresponds to atomic states that\nonly allow for heat and entropy exchange with the field and can energize a\nproper heat engine. We identify highly promising multiatom states for each kind\nof fuel and propose viable experimental schemes for their implementation.\n", "  Recently BCS superconductivity at 203 K has been discovery in a highly\ncompressed hydrogen sulfide. We use first-principles calculations to\nsystematically examine the effects of partially substituting the chalcogen\natoms on the superconductivity of hydrogen chalcogenides under high pressures.\nWe find detailed trends of how the critical temperature changes with increasing\nthe V-, VI- or VII-substitution rate, which highlight the key roles played by\nlow atomic mass and by strong covalent metallicity. In particular, a possible\nrecord high critical temperature of 280 K is predicted in a stable\nH3S0.925P0.075 with the Im-3m structure under 250 GPa.\n", "  We compute potentials of two static antiquarks in the presence of two quarks\n$qq$ of finite mass using lattice QCD. In a second step we solve the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, to determine, whether the resulting potentials are\nsufficiently attractive to host a bound state, which would indicate the\nexistence of a stable $q q \\bar b \\bar b$ tetraquark. We find a bound state for\n$qq=(ud-du)/\\sqrt{2}$ with corresponding quantum numbers $I(J^ P)=0(1^+)$ and\nevidence against the existence of bound states with isospin $I=1$ or $qq \\in\n\\{cc,ss \\}$\n", "  We analyze the synchronization transition of a globally coupled network of N\nphase oscillators with inertia (rotators) whose natural frequencies are\nunimodally or bimodally distributed. In the unimodal case, the system exhibits\na discontinuous hysteretic transition from an incoherent to a partially\nsynchronized (PS) state. For sufficiently large inertia, the system reveals the\ncoexistence of a PS state and of a standing wave (SW) solution. In the bimodal\ncase, the hysteretic synchronization transition involves several states.\nNamely, the system becomes coherent passing through traveling waves (TWs), SWs\nand finally arriving to a PS regime. The transition to the PS state from the SW\noccurs always at the same coupling, independently of the system size, while its\nvalue increases linearly with the inertia. On the other hand the critical\ncoupling required to observe TWs and SWs increases with N suggesting that in\nthe thermodynamic limit the transition from incoherence to PS will occur\nwithout any intermediate states. Finally a linear stability analysis reveals\nthat the system is hysteretic not only at the level of macroscopic indicators,\nbut also microscopically as verified by measuring the maximal Lyapunov\nexponent.\n", "  Models of non-interacting fermions coupled to auxilliary classical degrees of\nfreedom are relevant to the understanding of a wide variety of problems in many\nbody physics, {\\it e.g.} the description of manganites, diluted magnetic\nsemiconductors or strongly interacting electrons on lattices. Monte Carlo\nsampling over the classical fields is a powerful, yet notoriously challenging,\nmethod for this class of problems -- it requires the solution of the fermion\nproblem for each classical field configuration. Conventional Monte Carlo\nmethods minimally utilize the information content of these solutions by\nextracting single temperature properties. We present a flat-histogram Monte\nCarlo algorithm that simulates a novel statistical ensemble which allows to\nacquire the full thermodynamic information, {\\it i.e.} the partition function\nat all temperatures, of sampled classical configurations.\n", "  Astronomical observations are affected by several kinds of noise, each with\nits own causal source; there is photon noise, stochastic source variability,\nand residuals coming from imperfect calibration of the detector or telescope.\nThe precision of NASA Kepler photometry for exoplanet science---the most\nprecise photometric measurements of stars ever made---appears to be limited by\nunknown or untracked variations in spacecraft pointing and temperature, and\nunmodeled stellar variability. Here we present the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) for\nKepler data, a data-driven model intended to capture variability but preserve\ntransit signals. The CPM works at the pixel level so that it can capture very\nfine-grained information about the variation of the spacecraft. The CPM\npredicts each target pixel value from a large number of pixels of other stars\nsharing the instrument variabilities while not containing any information on\npossible transits in the target star. In addition, we use the target star's\nfuture and past (auto-regression). By appropriately separating, for each data\npoint, the data into training and test sets, we ensure that information about\nany transit will be perfectly isolated from the model. The method has four\nhyper-parameters (the number of predictor stars, the auto-regressive window\nsize, and two L2-regularization amplitudes for model components), which we set\nby cross-validation. We determine a generic set of hyper-parameters that works\nwell for most of the stars and apply the method to a corresponding set of\ntarget stars. We find that we can consistently outperform (for the purposes of\nexoplanet detection) the Kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) method for\nexoplanet discovery.\n", "  In this paper we study the expectation values of the induced charge and\ncurrent densities for a massive bosonic field with nonzero chemical potential\nin the geometry of a higher dimensional compactified cosmic string with\nmagnetic fluxes, along the string core and also enclosed by the compactified\ndirection, in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature $T$. These densities\nare calculated by decomposing them into the vacuum expectation values and\nfinite temperature contributions coming from the particles and antiparticles.\nThe only nonzero components correspond to the charge, azimuthal and axial\ncurrent densities. By using the Abel-Plana formula, we decompose the components\nof the densities into the part induced by the cosmic string and the one by the\ncompactification. The charge density is an odd function of the chemical\npotential and even periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal\nto the quantum flux. Moreover, the azimuthal (axial) current density is an even\nfunction of the chemical potential and an odd (even) periodic function of the\nmagnetic flux with the same period. In this paper our main concern is the\nthermal effect on the charge and current densities, including some limiting\ncases, the low and high temperature approximations. We show that in all cases\nthe temperature enhances the induced densities.\n", "  The development of responsive metamaterials has enabled the realization of\ncompact tunable photonic devices capable of manipulating the amplitude,\npolarization, wave vector, and frequency of light. Integration of\nsemiconductors into the active regions of metallic resonators is a proven\napproach for creating nonlinear metamaterials through optoelectronic control of\nthe semiconductor carrier density. Metal-free subwavelength resonant\nsemiconductor structures offer an alternative approach to create dynamic\nmetamaterials. We present InAs plasmonic disk arrays as a viable resonant\nmetamaterial at terahertz frequencies. Importantly, InAs plasmonic disks\nexhibit a strong nonlinear response arising from electric field induced\nintervalley scattering resulting in a reduced carrier mobility thereby damping\nthe plasmonic response. We demonstrate nonlinear perfect absorbers configured\nas either optical limiters or saturable absorbers, including flexible nonlinear\nabsorbers achieved by transferring the disks to polyimide films. Nonlinear\nplasmonic metamaterials show potential for use in ultrafast THz optics and for\npassive protection of sensitive electromagnetic devices.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological insulators harbour metallic surface states with\nexotic properties. In transport or optics, these properties are typically\nmasked by defect-induced bulk carriers. Compensation of donors and acceptors\nreduces the carrier density, but the bulk resistivity remains disappointingly\nsmall. We show that measurements of the optical conductivity in BiSbTeSe$_2$\npinpoint the presence of electron-hole puddles in the bulk at low temperatures,\nwhich is essential for understanding DC bulk transport. The puddles arise from\nlarge fluctuations of the Coulomb potential of donors and acceptors, even in\nthe case of full compensation. Surprisingly, the number of carriers appearing\nwithin puddles drops rapidly with increasing temperature and almost vanishes\naround 40 K. Monte Carlo simulations show that a highly non-linear screening\neffect arising from thermally activated carriers destroys the puddles at a\ntemperature scale set by the Coulomb interaction between neighbouring dopants,\nexplaining the experimental observation semi-quantitatively. This mechanism\nremains valid if donors and acceptors do not compensate perfectly.\n", "  In this paper we use the framework of generalized probabilistic theories to\npresent two sets of basic assumptions, called axioms, for which we show that\nthey lead to the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. The key\nresults in this derivation are the co-ordinatization of generalized geometries\nand a theorem of Sol\\'er which characterizes Hilbert spaces among the\northomodular spaces. A generalized Wigner theorem is applied to reduce some of\nthe assumptions of the theorem of Sol\\'er to the theory of symmetry in quantum\nmechanics. Since this reduction is only partial we also point out the remaining\nopen questions.\n", "  Nanoscale generation of individual photons in confined geometries is an\nexciting research field aiming at exploiting localized electromagnetic fields\nfor light manipulation. One of the outstanding challenges of photonic systems\ncombining emitters with nanostructured media is the selective channelling of\nphotons emitted by embedded sources into specific optical modes and their\ntransport at distant locations in integrated systems. Here, we show that\nsoft-matter nanofibers, electrospun with embedded emitters, combine\nsubwavelength field localization and large broadband near-field coupling with\nlow propagation losses. By momentum spectroscopy, we quantify the modal\ncoupling efficiency identifying the regime of single-mode coupling. These\nnanofibers do not rely on resonant interactions, making them ideal for\nroom-temperature operation, and offer a scalable platform for future quantum\ninformation technology.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the nonlinear response of a multilayer graphene\nresonator using a superconducting microwave cavity to detect its motion. The\nradiation pressure force is used to drive the mechanical resonator in an\noptomechanically induced transparency configuration. By varying the amplitudes\nof drive and probe tones, the mechanical resonator can be brought into a\nnonlinear limit. Using the calibration of the optomechanical coupling, we\nquantify the mechanical Duffing nonlinearity. By increasing the drive force, we\nobserve a decrease in the mechanical dissipation rate at large amplitudes,\nsuggesting a negative nonlinear damping mechanism in the graphene resonator.\nIncreasing the optomechanical backaction, we observe a nonlinear regime not\ndescribed by a Duffing response that includes new instabilities of the\nmechanical response.\n", "  After more than three decades the fractional quantum Hall effect still poses\nchallenges to contemporary physics. Recent experiments point toward a fractal\nscenario for the Hall resistivity as a function of the magnetic field. Here, we\nconsider the so-called thin-torus limit of the Hamiltonian describing\ninteracting electrons in a strong magnetic field, restricted to the lowest\nLandau level, and we show that it can be mapped onto a one-dimensional lattice\ngas with repulsive interactions, with the magnetic field playing the role of a\nchemical potential. The statistical mechanics of such models leads to interpret\nthe sequence of Hall plateaux as a fractal phase diagram, whose landscape shows\na qualitative agreement with experiments.\n", "  We consider a decay of a false vacuum in flux compactifications of type IIB\nstring theory and study a catalytic effect for a phase transition induced by a\nnew type of impurities. We concentrate on the large N dual of a\nD5-brane/anti-D5-brane system which has a rich vacuum structure. We show that\nD3-branes wrapping the 3-cycles can form a dibaryon and make a bound state with\na monopole. We find that these baryon-like objects can make the lifetime of the\nmetastable vacuum shorter.\n", "  Bismaleimide (BMI) resins are a new breed of thermosetting resins used mainly\nfor high temperature applications and have major usage in aerospace. FTIR\nstudies have shown the signatures of imide, CNC stretching, malemide and N-H\nstretching. These BMI polymer coatings were deposited on aluminum and mild\nsteel substrates by sprinkling powers followed by baking. Thermo gravimetric\nanalysis and Differential scanning calorimetric studies showed the degradation\ntemperature of these polymers around 370oC. Aluminum coatings were deposited on\nBMI previously deposited on Al and mild steel to make a metal-BMI-metal\ntrilayer. These trilayers can solve the problem charging of the aircraft bodies\nat high altitudes. Atomic force microscopy was done to determine the morphology\nof the surface. Roughness and thickness measurements of the BMI coatings were\ncarried out by surface profilometer. Vickers microhardness tests showed an\nincrease in hardness of the metal-BMI-metal trilayer. FTIR spectrum showed\nsignature of imides, CNC stretching, maleimide and N-H stretching in BMI. We\nobserved that peak broadens at which shows the release of the stress during\nthermal treatment of the coating. The coating is subject to variable APPJ\nconditions which improve the properties at high temperature.\n", "  In this work, we introduce an extra singlet pseudoscalar into the Type-III\ntwo Higgs doublet model (2HDM) which is supposed to solve a series of problems\nin the modern particle-cosmology. With existence of a light pseudoscalar, the\n$h\\rightarrow\\mu\\tau$ excess measured at CMS and as well as the $(g-2)_{\\mu}$\nanomaly could be simultaneously explained within certain parameter spaces that\ncan also tolerate the data on the flavor-violating processes\n$\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma$ and Higgs decay gained at LHC. Within the same\nparameter spaces, the DM relic abundance is well accounted. Moreover, the\nrecently observed Galactic Center gamma ray excess(GCE) is proposed to realize\nthrough dark matter(DM) pair annihilations, and in this work, the scenario of\nthe annihilation being mediated by the pseudoscalar is also addressed.\n", "  How did galaxies form and evolve? This is one of the most challenging\nquestions in astronomy today. Answering it requires a careful combination of\nobservational and theoretical work to reliably determine the observed\nproperties of cosmic bodies over large portions of the distant Universe on the\none hand, and accurately model the physical processes driving their evolution\non the other. Most importantly, it requires bringing together disparate\nmulti-wavelength and multi-resolution spectro-photometric datasets in an\nhomogeneous and well-characterized manner so that they are suitable for a\nrigorous statistical analysis. The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP)\nfunded by the EC FP7 SPACE program aims to achieve this goal by combining the\nexpertise of optical, infrared and radio astronomers to provide a\nmulti-wavelength database for the distant Universe as an accessible value-added\nresource for the astronomical community. It will do so by bringing together\nmulti-wavelength datasets covering the 1000 deg$^2$ mapped by Herschel\nextragalactic surveys in an homogeneous and well-characterized manner, creating\na joint lasting legacy from several ambitious sky surveys.\n", "  Using BRST-BV formulation of relativistic dynamics, arbitrary spin massless\nand massive field propagating in flat space and arbitrary spin massless fields\npropagating in AdS space are considered. For such fields, BRST-BV Lagrangians\ninvariant under gauge transformations are obtained. The Lagrangians and gauge\ntransformations are built in terms of traceless gauge fields and traceless\ngauge transformation parameters. The use of the Poincare parametrization of AdS\nspace allows us to get simple BRST-BV Lagrangian for AdS fields. By imposing\nthe Siegel gauge condition, we get gauge-fixed Lagrangian which leads to\ndecoupled equations of motion for AdS fields. Such equations of motion\nconsiderably simplify the study of AdS/CFT correspondence. In the basis of\nconformal algebra, realization of relativistic symmetries on space of fields\nand antifields entering the BRST-BV formulation of AdS fields is obtained.\n", "  By Using the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, we calculate the\n1s{\\sigma}_g state energies, the dissociation energies and the binding energies\nof the hydrogen molecule and its molecular ion in the presence of an aligned\nmagnetic field regime between 0 a.u. and 10 a.u. The present calculations are\nbased on using two types of compact and accurate trial wave functions, which\nare put forward for consideration in calculating energies in the absence of\nmagnetic field. The obtained results are compared with the most recent accurate\nvalues. We conclude that the applications of VMC method can be extended\nsuccessfully to cover the case of molecules under the effect of the magnetic\nfield.\n", "  This work presents a theoretical study of the structural and electronic\nproperties of bilayered silicon films under in-plane biaxial strain/stress\nusing density functional theory. Atomic structures of the two-dimensional\nsilicon films are optimized by using both the local-density approximation and\ngeneralized gradient approximation. In the absence of strain/stress, five\nbuckled hexagonal honeycomb structures of the bilayered silicon film have been\nobtained as local energy minima and their structural stability has been\nverified. These structures present a Dirac-cone shaped energy band diagram with\nzero energy band gaps. Applying tensile biaxial strain leads to a reduction of\nthe buckling height. Atomically flat structures with zero bucking height have\nbeen observed when the AA-stacking structures are under a critical biaxial\nstrain. Increase of the strain between 10.7% ~ 15.4% results in a band-gap\nopening with a maximum energy band gap opening of ~168.0 meV obtained when\n14.3% strain is applied. Energy band diagram, electron transmission efficiency,\nand the charge transport property are calculated.\n", "  While the interaction potential between two dipoles residing in a single\nplane is repulsive, in a system of two vertically adjacent layers of dipoles it\nchanges from repulsive interaction in the long range to attractive interaction\nin the short range. Here we show that for dipolar excitons in semiconductor\nheterostructures, such a potential may give rise to bound states if two such\nexcitons are excited in two separate layers, leading to the formation of\nvertically coupled dipolar exciton molecules. Our calculations prove the\nexistence of such bound states and predict their binding energy as a function\nof the layers separation as well as their thermal distributions. We show that\nthese molecules should be observed in realistic systems such as semiconductor\ncoupled quantum well structures and the more recent van-der-Waals bound\nheterostructures. Formation of such molecules can lead to new effects such as a\ncollective dipolar drag between layers and new forms of multi-particle\ncorrelations, as well as to the study of dipolar molecular dynamics in a\ncontrolled system.\n", "  A semiconductor quantum dot can generate highly coherent and\nindistinguishable single photons. However, intrinsic semiconductor dephasing\nmechanisms can reduce the visibility of two-photon interference. For an\nelectron in a quantum dot, a fundamental dephasing process is the hyperfine\ninteraction with the nuclear spin bath. Here we directly probe the consequence\nof the fluctuating nuclear spins on the elastic and inelastic scattered photon\nspectra from a resident electron in a single dot. We find the nuclear spin\nfluctuations lead to detuned Raman scattered photons which are distinguishable\nfrom both the elastic and incoherent components of the resonance fluorescence.\nThis significantly reduces two-photon interference visibility. However, we\ndemonstrate successful screening of the nuclear spin noise which enables the\ngeneration of coherent single photons that exhibit high visibility two-photon\ninterference.\n", "  Electron-crystal and phonon-glass are regarded as two essential factors for\nideal thermoelectric materials, which require both an enhanced electronic\ntransport and a depressed phononic transport. These two characteristics usually\ncan not coexist in complete bulk semiconductors because of the strong\ninteraction between electrons and phonons. Introducing nanostructures into bulk\nthermoelectric materials has long been applying to allow for diverse phonon\nscattering mechanisms to reduce lattice thermal conductivity while keeping the\nelectrical conductivity intact. However, some two-dimensional materials do the\nopposite. Here, we propose an example of monolayer SnSe introduced from recent\nnewly researched bulk thermoelectric materials SnSe. Through first-principles\nelectronic structure calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, we show that\nthe lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer SnSe is instead higher than that\nof bulk SnSe, leading to a depressed thermoelectric figure of merit compared\nwith bulk one. Besides, we also find the anisotropic level in monolayer SnSe is\nreduced, and better thermoelectric performance can be seen in electron doping.\n", "  De Sitter supergravity describes interaction of supergravity with general\nchiral and vector multiplets as well as one nilpotent chiral multiplet. The\nextra universal positive term in the potential due to the nilpotent multiplet,\ncorresponding to the anti-D3 brane in string theory, supports de Sitter vacua\nin these supergravity models. In the flat space limit these supergravity models\ninclude the Volkov-Akulov model with a non-linearly realized supersymmetry. The\nrules for constructing pure de Sitter supergravity action are generalized here\nin presence of other matter multiplets. We present a strategy to derive the\ncomplete closed form general supergravity action with a given Kahler potential\n$K$, superpotential $W$ and vector matrix $f_{AB}$ interacting with a nilpotent\nchiral multiplet. It has the potential $V=e^K(|F^2 |+ |DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$, where\n$F$ is a necessarily non-vanishing value of the auxiliary field of the\nnilpotent multiplet. De Sitter vacua are present under simple condition that\n$|F^2|- 3|W|^2>0$. A complete explicit action in the unitary gauge is\npresented.\n", "  We used a sample of super-Earth-like planets detected by the Doppler\nspectroscopy and transit techniques to explore the dependence of orbital\nparameters of the planets on the metallicity of their host stars. We confirm\nthe previous results (although still based on small samples of planets) that\nsuper-Earths orbiting around metal-rich stars are not observed to be as distant\nfrom their host stars as we observe their metal-poor counterparts to be. The\norbits of these super-Earths with metal-rich hosts usually do not reach into\nthe Habitable Zone (HZ), keeping them very hot and inhabitable. We found that\nmost of the known planets in the HZ are orbiting their GK-type hosts which are\nmetal-poor. The metal-poor nature of planets in the HZ suggests a high Mg\nabundance relative to Si and high Si abundance relative to Fe. These results\nlead us to speculate that HZ planets might be more frequent in the ancient\nGalaxy and had compositions different from that of our Earth.\n", "  Studies of Majorana bound states in semiconducting nanowires frequently\nneglect the orbital effect of magnetic field. Systematically studying its role\nleads us to several conclusions for designing Majoranas in this system.\nSpecifically, we show that for experimentally relevant parameter values orbital\neffect of magnetic field has a stronger impact on the dispersion relation than\nthe Zeeman effect. While Majoranas do not require a presence of only one\ndispersion subband, we observe that the size of the Majoranas becomes\nunpractically large, and the band gap unpractically small when more than one\nsubband is filled. Since the orbital effect of magnetic field breaks several\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian, it leads to the appearance of large regions in\nparameter space with no band gap whenever the magnetic field is not aligned\nwith the wire axis. The reflection symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to\nthe plane perpendicular to the wire axis guarantees that the wire stays gapped\nin the topologically nontrivial region as long as the field is aligned with the\nwire.\n", "  We examine the effect of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate on\nelectron transport through graphene nanojunctions just before gap formation.\nJunctions in vacuum and on hBN are formed using classical molecular dynamics to\ncreate initial structures, followed by relaxation using density functional\ntheory. We find that the hBN only slightly reduces the current through the\njunctions at low biases. Furthermore due to quantum interference at the last\nmoments of breaking, the current though a single carbon filament spanning the\ngap is found to be higher than the current through two filaments spanning the\ngap in parallel. This feature is present both in the presence of absence of\nhBN.\n", "  We propose a deterministic scheme for teleporting an unknown qubit through\ncontinuous-variable entangled states in superconducting circuits. The qubit is\na superconducting two-level system and the bipartite quantum channel is a\nphotonic entangled coherent state between two cavities. A Bell-type measurement\nperformed on the hybrid state of solid and photonic states brings a\ndiscrete-variable unknown electronic state to a continuous-variable photonic\ncat state in a cavity mode. This scheme further enables applications for\nquantum information processing in the same architecture of circuit-QED such as\nverification and error-detection schemes for entangled coherent states.\nFinally, a dynamical method of a self-Kerr tunability in a cavity state has\nbeen investigated for minimizing self-Kerr distortion and all essential\ningredients are shown to be experimentally feasible with the state of the art\nsuperconducting circuits.\n", "  Thermal density functional theory calculations often use the Mermin-Kohn-Sham\nscheme, but employ ground-state approximations to the exchange-correlation (XC)\nfree energy. In the simplest solvable nontrivial model, an asymmetric Hubbard\ndimer, we calculate the exact many-body energies and the exact Mermin-Kohn-Sham\nfunctionals for this system and extract the exact XC free energy. For moderate\ntemperatures and weak correlation, we find this approximation to be excellent.\nWe extract various exact free-energy correlation components and the exact\nadiabatic connection formula.\n", "  We have simulated atmospheric effects such as fog and smoke in laboratory\nenvironment to simulate depolarisation due to atmospheric effects during a free\nspace optical communi- cation. This has been used to study noise in two\ncomponents of quaternary encoding for polarization shift keying. Individual\ncomponents of a Quaternary encoding, such as vertical and horizontal as well as\n45$^\\circ$ and 135$^\\circ$ , are tested separately and indicates that the depo-\nlarization effects are different for these two situation. However, due to a\ndifferential method used to extract information bits, the protocol shows\nextremely low bit error rates. The information obtained is useful during\ndeployment of a fully functional Quaternary encoded PolSK scheme in free space.\n", "  We present a data-adaptive spectral method - Monte Carlo Singular Spectrum\nAnalysis (MC-SSA) - and its modification to tackle astrophysical problems.\nThrough numerical simulations we show the ability of the MC-SSA in dealing with\n$1/f^{\\beta}$ power-law noise affected by photon counting statistics. Such\nnoise process is simulated by a first-order autoregressive, AR(1) process\ncorrupted by intrinsic Poisson noise. In doing so, we statistically estimate a\nbasic stochastic variation of the source and the corresponding fluctuations due\nto the quantum nature of light. In addition, MC-SSA test retains its\neffectiveness even when a significant percentage of the signal falls below a\ncertain level of detection, e.g., caused by the instrument sensitivity. The\nparsimonious approach presented here may be broadly applied, from the search\nfor extrasolar planets to the extraction of low-intensity coherent phenomena\nprobably hidden in high energy transients.\n", "  Stokes wave is a finite amplitude periodic gravity wave propagating with\nconstant velocity in inviscid fluid. Complex analytical structure of Stokes\nwave is analyzed using a conformal mapping of a free fluid surface of Stokes\nwave into the real line with fluid domain mapped into the lower complex\nhalf-plane. There is one square root branch point per spatial period of Stokes\nlocated in the upper complex half-plane at the distance $v_c$ from the real\naxis. The increase of Stokes wave height results in approaching $v_c$ to zero\nwith the limiting Stokes wave formation at $v_c=0.$ The limiting Stokes wave\nhas $2/3$ power law singularity forming $2\\pi/3$ radians angle on the crest\nwhich is qualitatively different from the square root singularity valid for\narbitrary small but nonzero $v_c$ making the limit of zero $v_c$ highly\nnontrivial. That limit is addressed by crossing a branch cut of a square root\ninto the second and subsequently higher sheets of Riemann surface to find\ncoupled square root singularities at the distances $\\pm v_c$ from the real axis\nat each sheet. The number of sheets is infinite and the analytical continuation\nof Stokes wave into all these sheets is found together with the series\nexpansion in half-integer powers at singular points within each sheet. It is\nconjectured that non-limiting Stokes wave at the leading order consists of the\ninfinite number of nested square root singularities which also implies the\nexistence in the third and higher sheets of the additional square root\nsingularities away from the real and imaginary axes. These nested square roots\nform $2/3$ power law singularity of the limiting Stokes wave as $v_c$ vanishes.\n", "  Plexcitons are polaritonic modes that result from the strong coupling between\nexcitons and plasmons. We consider plexcitons emerging from the interaction of\nexcitons in an organic molecular layer with surface plasmons in a metallic\nfilm. We predict the emergence of Dirac cones in the two-dimensional\nbandstructure of plexcitons due to the inherent alignment of the excitonic\ntransitions in the organic layer. These Dirac cones may open up in energy by\nsimultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and\nsubjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting\nenergy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which\ntravel at the interface of this plexcitonic system. Our theoretical proposal\nsuggests that plexcitons are a convenient and simple platform for the\nexploration of exotic phases of matter as well as of novel ways to direct\nenergy flow at the nanoscale.\n", "  We revisit the simplest model for dark matter. In this context the dark\nmatter candidate is a real scalar field which interacts with the Standard Model\nparticles through the Higgs portal. We discuss the relic density constraints as\nwell as the predictions for direct and indirect detection. The final state\nradiation processes are investigated in order to understand the visibility of\nthe gamma lines from dark matter annihilation. We find two regions where one\ncould observe the gamma lines at gamma-ray telescopes. We point out that the\nregion where the dark matter mass is between 92 and 300 GeV can be tested in\nthe near future at direct and indirect detection experiments.\n", "  Interdiffusion studies become increasingly difficult to perform with the\nincreasing number of elements in a system. It is rather easy to calculate the\ninterdiffusion coefficients for all the compositions in the interdiffusion zone\nin a binary system. The intrinsic diffusion coefficients can be calculated for\nthe composition of Kirkendall marker plane in a binary system. In a ternary\nsystem, however, the interdiffusion coefficients can only be calculated for the\ncomposition where composition profiles from two different diffusion couples\nintersect. Intrinsic diffusion coefficients are possible to calculate when the\nKirkendall markers are also present at that composition, which is a condition\nthat is generally difficult to satisfy. In a quaternary system, the composition\nprofiles for three different diffusion couples must intersect at one particular\ncomposition to calculate the diffusion parameters, which is a condition that is\nalmost impossible to satisfy. To avoid these complications in a multicomponent\nsystem, the average interdiffusion coefficients are calculated. I propose a\nmethod of calculating the intrinsic diffusion coefficients and the variation in\nthe interdiffusion coefficients for multicomponent systems. This method can be\nused for a single diffusion couple in a multicomponent pseudobinary system. The\ncompositions of the end members of a diffusion couple should be selected such\nthat only two elements diffuse into the interdiffusion zone. A few hypothetical\ndiffusion couples are considered in order to validate and explain our method.\nVarious sources of error in the calculations are also discussed.\n", "  Assuming gauge/gravity correspondence we study reheating of the Universe\nusing its holographic dual. Inflaton decay and thermalisation of the decay\nproducts correspond to collapse of a spherical shell and formation of a\nblackhole in the dual anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The reheating temperature\nis computed as the Hawking temperature of the developed blackhole probed by a\ndynamical boundary, and is determined by the inflaton energy density and the\nAdS radius, with corrections from the dynamics of the shell collapse. For given\ninitial energy density of the inflaton field the holographic model gives\nsignificantly lower reheating temperature than the instant reheating scenario,\nwhile it is shown to be safely within phenomenological bounds.\n", "  In the gauge-Higgs unification with multiple extra spaces, the Higgs\nself-coupling is of the order of $g^2$ and Higgs is predicted to be light,\nbeing consistent with the LHC results. When the gauge group is simple, the weak\nmixing angle is also predictable. We address a question whether there exists a\nmodel of gauge-Higgs unification in 6-dimensional space-time, which\nsuccessfully predicts the mass ratios of the Higgs boson and weak gauge bosons.\nFirst, by use of a useful formula we give a general argument on the condition\nto get a realistic prediction of the weak mixing angle $sin^{2}theta_{W} =\n1/4$, and find that triplet and sextet representations of the minimal SU(3)\ngauge group lead to the realistic prediction. Concerning the Higgs mass, we\nnotice that in the models with one Higgs doublet, the predicted Higgs mass is\nalways the same: $M_H = 2 M_W$. However, by extending our discussion to the\nmodels with two Higgs doublets, the situation changes: we obtain an interesting\nprediction $M_{H} leq 2M_{W}$ at the leading order of the perturbation. Thus it\nis possible to recover the observed Higgs mass, 125 GeV, for a suitable choice\nof the parameter. The situation is in clear contrast to the case of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model, where $M_{H} leq M_{Z}$ at the classical level\nand the predicted Higgs mass cannot recover the observed value.\n", "  Doping of substrates at desired locations is a key technology for spin-based\nquantum memory devices. Focused ion beam implantation is well-suited for this\ntask due to its high spacial resolution. In this work, we investigate ion-beam\nimplanted erbium ensembles in Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals by means of\nconfocal photoluminescence spectroscopy. The sample temperature and the\npost-implantation annealing step strongly reverberate in the properties of the\nimplanted ions. We find that hot implantation leads to a higher activation rate\nof the ions. At high enough fluences, the relation between the fluence and\nfinal concentration of ions becomes non-linear. Two models are developed\nexplaining the observed behaviour.\n", "  We present results for Vela C obtained during the 2012 flight of the\nBalloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for Polarimetry\n(BLASTPol). We mapped polarized intensity across almost the entire extent of\nthis giant molecular cloud, in bands centered at 250, 350, and 500 {\\mu}m. In\nthis initial paper, we show our 500 {\\mu}m data smoothed to a resolution of 2.5\narcminutes (approximately 0.5 pc). We show that the mean level of the\nfractional polarization p and most of its spatial variations can be accounted\nfor using an empirical three-parameter power-law fit, p = p_0 N^(-0.4)\nS^(-0.6), where N is the hydrogen column density and S is the\npolarization-angle dispersion on 0.5 pc scales. The decrease of p with\nincreasing S is expected because changes in the magnetic field direction within\nthe cloud volume sampled by each measurement will lead to cancellation of\npolarization signals. The decrease of p with increasing N might be caused by\nthe same effect, if magnetic field disorder increases for high column density\nsightlines. Alternatively, the intrinsic polarization efficiency of the dust\ngrain population might be lower for material along higher density sightlines.\nWe find no significant correlation between N and S. Comparison of observed\nsubmillimeter polarization maps with synthetic polarization maps derived from\nnumerical simulations provides a promising method for testing star formation\ntheories. Realistic simulations should allow for the possibility of variable\nintrinsic polarization efficiency. The measured levels of correlation among p,\nN, and S provide points of comparison between observations and simulations.\n", "  The well-known Hill's averaging theorems for stresses and strains as well as\nthe so-called Hill-Mandel principle of macrohomogeneity are essential\ningredients for the coupling and the consistency between the micro and macro\nscales in multiscale finite element procedures (FE$^2$). We show in this paper\nthat these averaging relations hold exactly under standard finite element\ndiscretizations, even if the stress field is discontinuous across elements and\nthe standard proofs based on the divergence theorem are no longer suitable. The\ndiscrete averaging results are derived for the three classical types of\nboundary conditions (affine displacement, periodic and uniform traction\nboundary conditions) using the properties of the shape functions and the weak\nform of the microscopic equilibrium equations. The analytical proofs are\nfurther verified numerically through a simple finite element simulation of an\nirregular representative volume element undergoing large deformations.\nFurthermore, the proofs are extended to include the effects of body forces and\ninertia, and the results are consistent with those in the smooth continuum\nsetting. This work provides a solid foundation to apply Hill's averaging\nrelations in multiscale finite element methods without introducing an\nadditional error in the scale transition due to the discretization.\n", "  We study the flavor dependence of the medium modification factor $R_{pp}$ for\n$pp$ collisions for scenario with formation of a small-size quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) for RHIC ($\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ TeV) and LHC ($\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV) energies. We\nfind that at $p_T\\sim 10$ GeV the pion spectrum is suppressed by $\\sim\n20-30\\,(25-35)$\\% for RHIC (LHC), for $D$~($B$) mesons the suppression effect\nis smaller by a factor of $\\sim 0.7-0.8$ ($0.5$). The flavor hierarchy\n$R_{pp}^\\pi<R_{pp}^D<R_{pp}^B$ is held at $p_T\\lesssim 20$ GeV for RHIC and at\n$p_T\\lesssim 70$ GeV for LHC. This gives a sizeable reduction of the\nheavy-to-light ratios of the nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$ as compared\nto that in the standard scenario without the QGP production in $pp$ collisions.\n", "  The Weak Gravity Conjecture, if valid, rules out simple models of Natural\nInflation by restricting their axion decay constant to be sub-Planckian. We\nrevisit stringy attempts to realise Natural Inflation, with a single open\nstring axionic inflaton from D-branes in a warped throat. We show that warping\nallows the requisite super-Planckian axion decay constant to be achieved\nconsistently with the Weak Gravity Conjecture. However, there is a tension\nbetween large axion decay constant and high string scale, where the requisite\nhigh string scale is difficult to achieve in all attempts to realise large\nfield inflation using perturbative string theory. We comment on the Generalized\nWeak Gravity Conjecture in the light of our results.\n", "  We investigate the new physics that arises when a correlated quantum impurity\nhybridizes with Fermi gas with a generalized Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nproduced via a uniform synthetic non-Abelian gauge field. We show that the\nimpurity develops a {\\it fractional} local moment which couples\nanti-ferromagnetically to the Rashba-Fermi gas. This results in a concomitant\n{\\it Kondo effect with a high temperature scale} that can be tuned by the\nstrength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Resolving numerically Vlasov-Poisson equations for initially cold systems can\nbe reduced to following the evolution of a three-dimensional sheet evolving in\nsix-dimensional phase-space. We describe a public parallel numerical algorithm\nconsisting in representing the phase-space sheet with a conforming,\nself-adaptive simplicial tessellation of which the vertices follow the\nLagrangian equations of motion. The algorithm is implemented both in six- and\nfour-dimensional phase-space. Refinement of the tessellation mesh is performed\nusing the bisection method and a local representation of the phase-space sheet\nat second order relying on additional tracers created when needed at runtime.\nIn order to preserve in the best way the Hamiltonian nature of the system,\nrefinement is anisotropic and constrained by measurements of local Poincar\\'e\ninvariants. Resolution of Poisson equation is performed using the fast Fourier\nmethod on a regular rectangular grid, similarly to particle in cells codes. To\ncompute the density projected onto this grid, the intersection of the\ntessellation and the grid is calculated using the method of Franklin and\nKankanhalli (1993) generalised to linear order. As preliminary tests of the\ncode, we study in four dimensional phase-space the evolution of an initially\nsmall patch in a chaotic potential and the cosmological collapse of a\nfluctuation composed of two sinusoidal waves. We also perform a \"warm\" dark\nmatter simulation in six-dimensional phase-space that we use to check the\nparallel scaling of the code.\n", "  The prospects of searching for the flavor changing neutral current effect in\nthe decay of $t\\to H c, H\\to \\tau\\tau$ are investigated with the simulated\n$p-p$ collision data for the ATLAS detector at the LHC, where the Higgs mass is\nassumed to be 125~GeV. A fit based on the constraints from the Higgs mass and\nthe tau decay kinematics is performed for each event, which improves\nsignificantly the Higgs and top mass reconstruction and helps the\nsignal-background separation. Boosted Decision Trees discriminants are\ndeveloped to achieve an optimal sensitivity of searching for the FCNC signal.\nAn expected upper limit of the branching ratio $\\mathcal{B}(t\\to H c)$ at\n$95\\%$ confidence level of 0.25\\% is obtained with a data set of 100~fb$^{-1}$\nat $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV during the LHC Run-2 period.\n", "  Typical searches for supersymmetry cannot test models in which the two\nlightest particles have a small (\"compressed\") mass splitting, due to the small\nmomentum of the particles produced in the decay of the second-to-lightest\nparticle. However, datasets with large missing transverse momentum ($E_{\\rm\nT}^{\\rm miss}$) can generically search for invisible particle production and\ntherefore provide constraints on such models. We apply data from the ATLAS\nmono-jet (jet+$E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$) and vector-boson-fusion (forward jets and\n$E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$) searches to such models. The two datasets have\ncomplementary sensitivity, but in all cases experimental limits are at least\nfive times weaker than theoretical predictions.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of constructing stable, static, spherically\nsymmetric, asymptotically flat Lorentzian wormhole solutions in General\nRelativity coupled to a generalized Galileon field $\\pi$. Assuming that\nMinkowski space-time is obtained at $\\partial \\pi =0$, we find that there is\ntension between the properties of the energy-momentum tensor required to\nsupport a wormhole (violation of average null energy conditions) and stability\nof the Galileon perturbations about the putative solution (absence of ghosts\nand gradient instabilities). In 3-dimensional space-time, this tension is\nstrong enough to rule out wormholes with above properties. In higher\ndimensions, including the most physically interesting case of 4-dimensional\nspace-time, wormholes, if any, must have fairly contrived shapes.\n", "  In a recent paper, Romps (JAS, vol.72, p.3639-3646, 2015, hereafter R15)\nargues that the moist-air static energy (MSE) is only approximately conserved\nfor an adiabatically lifted parcel, and that the quantity \"MSE - CAPE\" could be\nused as a true conserved variable, where CAPE is the convective available\nenergy.\n  It is shown in this comment that the quantity denoted by CAPE in R15 is the\nopposite of the convective available energy. It is explained that the vertical\nadiabatic ascent considered in R15 is not realistic, since it generates\ncondensed water of the order of 10 to 20 g/kg at height above 6 km. Moreover,\nthe thermodynamic equations are written in R15 by making several assumptions,\nnot all of which are explicitly mentioned.\n  This comment aims to clarify the hypotheses made in R15. It will show that\nthese assumptions call into question the validity of the moist-air internal\nenergy, enthalpy and entropy functions in R15. It also demonstrates that it is\npossible to obtain more precise and general formulations for moist-air energy,\nenthalpy and entropy functions, in particular by using the third law of\nthermodynamics. The large differences between the thermodynamics formulas\nderived in R15 and those depending on the third law are illustrated by studying\na realistic pseudo-adiabatic vertical profile.\n  The same notations as in R15 will be used as far as possible in this comment.\n", "  We analytically derive a decoherence model for orbital angular momentum\nstates of a photon in a multimode optical fiber and show that rate of\ndecoherence scales exponentially with $l^2$, where $l$ is the azimuthal mode\norder.~We also show numerically that for large values of $l$ the orbital\nangular momentum photon state completely dephases.~However for lower values of\n$l$ the decoherence can be minimized by using dynamical decoupling to allow for\nqudit high-bandwidth quantum communication and similar applications.\n\\end{abstract}\n", "  The efficient design of continuous freeform surfaces, which transform a given\nsource into an arbitrary target intensity, remains a challenging problem. A\npopular approach are ray-mapping methods, where first a ray mapping between the\nintensities is calculated and in a subsequent step the surface is constructed.\nThe challenging part hereby is the to find an integrable mapping ensuring a\ncontinuous surface. Based on the law of reflection/refraction and the\nwell-known integrability condition, we derive a general condition for the\nsurface and ray mapping for a collimated input beam. It is shown that in a\nsmall-angle approximation a proper mapping can be calculated via optimal mass\ntransport. We show that the surface can be constructed by solving a linear\nadvection equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The results imply that\nthe optimal mass transport mapping is approximately integrable over a wide\nrange of distances between the freeform and the target plane and offer an\nefficient way to construct the surface by solving standard integrals. The\nefficiency is demonstrated by applying it to two challenging design examples.\n", "  We present coupled stellar evolution (SE) and 3D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD)\nsimulations of the evolution of primordial protostars, their immediate\nenvironment, and the dynamic accretion history under the influence of stellar\nionizing and dissociating UV feedback. Our coupled SE-RHD calculations result\nin a wide diversity of final stellar masses covering 10 Msun $\\lesssim M_*\n\\lesssim$ 1000 Msun. The formation of very massive ($\\gtrsim$ 250 Msun) stars\nis possible under weak UV feedback, whereas ordinary massive (a few x 10 Msun)\nstars form when UV feedback can efficiently halt the accretion. This may\nexplain the peculiar abundance pattern of a Galactic metal-poor star recently\nreported by Aoki et al. (2014), possibly the observational signature of very\nmassive precursor primordial stars. Weak UV feedback occurs in cases of\nvariable accretion, in particular when repeated short accretion bursts\ntemporarily exceed 0.01 Msun/yr, causing the protostar to inflate. In the\nbloated state, the protostar has low surface temperature and UV feedback is\nsuppressed until the star eventually contracts, on a thermal adjustment\ntimescale, to create an HII region. If the delay time between successive\naccretion bursts is sufficiently short, the protostar remains bloated for\nextended periods, initiating at most only short periods of UV feedback. Disk\nfragmentation does not necessarily reduce the final stellar mass. Quite the\ncontrary, we find that disk fragmentation enhances episodic accretion as many\nfragments migrate inward and are accreted onto the star, thus allowing\ncontinued stellar mass growth under conditions of intermittent UV feedback.\nThis trend becomes more prominent as we improve the resolution of our\nsimulations. We argue that simulations with significantly higher resolution\nthan reported previously are needed to derive accurate gas mass accretion rates\nonto primordial protostars.\n", "  We discuss a strategy of sparse approximation that is based on the use of an\novercomplete basis, and evaluate its performance when a random matrix is used\nas this basis. A small combination of basis vectors is chosen from a given\novercomplete basis, according to a given compression rate, such that they\ncompactly represent the target data with as small a distortion as possible. As\na selection method, we study the $\\ell_0$- and $\\ell_1$-based methods, which\nemploy the exhaustive search and $\\ell_1$-norm regularization techniques,\nrespectively. The performance is assessed in terms of the trade-off relation\nbetween the representation distortion and the compression rate. First, we\nevaluate the performance analytically in the case that the methods are carried\nout ideally, using methods of statistical mechanics. Our result clarifies the\nfact that the $\\ell_0$-based method greatly outperforms the $\\ell_1$-based one.\nSecond, we examine the practical performances of two well-known algorithms,\northogonal matching pursuit and approximate message passing, when they are used\nto execute the $\\ell_0$- and $\\ell_1$-based methods, respectively. Our\nexamination shows that orthogonal matching pursuit achieves a much better\nperformance than the exact execution of the $\\ell_1$-based method, as well as\napproximate message passing. However, regarding the $\\ell_0$-based method,\nthere is still room to design more effective greedy algorithms than orthogonal\nmatching pursuit. Finally, we evaluate the performances of the algorithms when\nthey are applied to image data compression.\n", "  We consider combining of multiple laser beams into a single near\ndiffraction-limited beam by beam self-focusing (collapse) in a Kerr medium. The\nbeams with the total power above critical are combined in the near field and\nthen propagated in the Kerr medium. Nonlinearity results in self-focusing\nevent, combining multiple beams into nearly a diffraction-limited beam that\ncarries the critical power. Beam quality of the combined beam is analyzed as a\nfunction of the number of combining beams and the level of random fluctuations\nof the combining beams phases.\n", "  Interdiffusion study is conducted in the Ni-rich part of the beta-Ni(Pt)Al\nphase following the pseudo-binary approach. Interdiffusion coefficients over\nthe whole composition range considered in this study increases with the\nincrease in Pt content, which is in line with the theoretical study predicting\nthe decrease in vacancy formation and migration energy because of Pt addition.\nThe trend of change in diffusion coefficient with the increase in Ni and Pt\ncontent indicates that Pt preferably replaces Ni antisites.\n", "  We found non singular solutions for universes filled with a fluid which obey\na Generalized Equation of State of the form\n$P(\\rho)=-A\\rho+\\gamma\\rho^{\\lambda}$. An emergent universe is obtained if\n$A=1$ and $\\lambda =1/2$. If the matter source is reinterpret as that of a\nscalar matter field with some potential, the corresponding potential is\nderived. For a closed universe, an exact bounce solution is found for $A=1/3$\nand the same $\\lambda $. We also explore how the composition of theses\nuniverses can be interpreted in terms of known fluids. It is of interest to\nnote that accelerated solutions previously found for the late time evolution\nalso represent regular solutions at early times.\n", "  The dynamics and pair trajectory of two self-propelled colloids are reported.\nThe autonomous motions of the colloids are due to a catalytic chemical reaction\ntaking place asymmetrically on their surfaces that generates a concentration\ngradient of interactive solutes around the particles and actuate particle\npropulsion. We consider two spherical particles with symmetric catalytic caps\nextending over the local polar angles $\\theta^1_{cap}$ and $\\theta^2_{cap}$\nfrom the centers of active sectors in an otherwise quiescent fluid. A combined\nanalytical-numerical technique was developed to solve the coupled mass transfer\nequation and the hydrodynamics in the Stokes flow regime. The ensuing pair\ntrajectory of the colloids is controlled by the reacting coverages\n$\\theta^j_{cap}$ and their initial relative orientation with respect to each\nother. Our analysis indicates two possible scenarios for pair trajectories of\ncatalytic self-propelled particles: either the particles approach, come into\ncontact and assemble or they interact and move away from each other (escape).\nFor arbitrary motions of the colloids, it is found that the direction of\nparticle rotations is the key factor in determining the escape or assembly\nscenario. Based on the analysis, a phase diagram is sketched for the pair\ntrajectory of the catalytically active particles as a function of active\ncoverages and their initial relative orientations. We believe this study has\nimportant implications in elucidation of collective behaviors of\nauotophoretically self-propelled colloids.\n", "  The mechanical properties of amorphous solids like metallic glasses can be\ndramatically changed by adding small concentrations (as low as 0.1\\%) of\nforeign elements. The glass-forming-ability, the ductility, the yield stress\nand the elastic moduli can all be greatly effected. This paper presents\ntheoretical considerations with the aim of explaining the magnitude of these\nchanges in light of the small concentrations involved. The theory is built\naround the experimental evidence that the microalloying elements organize\naround them a neighborhood that differs from both the crystalline and the\nglassy phases of the material in the absence of the additional elements. These\nregions act as {\\em isotropic} defects that in unstressed systems dress the\nshear moduli. When strained, these defects interact with the incipient plastic\nresponses which are quadrupolar in nature. It will be shown that this\ninteraction interferes with the creation of system-spanning shear bands and\nincreases the yield strain. We offer experimentally testable estimates of the\nlengths of nano-shear bands in the presence of the additional elements.\n", "  We construct the lowest higher spin-2 current in terms of the spin-1 and the\nspin-1/2 currents living in the orthogonal SO(N+4)/[SO(N) x SO(4)] Wolf space\ncoset theory for general N. The remaining fifteen higher spin currents are\ndetermined. We obtain the three-point functions of bosonic (higher) spin\ncurrents with two scalars for finite N and k (the level of the spin-1 current).\nBy multiplying SU(2) x U(1) into the above Wolf space coset theory, the other\nfifteen higher spin currents together with the above lowest higher spin-2\ncurrent are realized in the extension of the large N=4 linear superconformal\nalgebra. Similarly, the three-point functions of bosonic (higher) spin currents\nwith two scalars for finite N and k are obtained. Under the large N 't Hooft\nlimit, the two types of three-point functions in the nonlinear and linear\nversions coincide as in the unitary coset theory found previously.\n", "  Liquid water is not only of obvious importance but also extremely intriguing,\ndisplaying many anomalies that still challenge our understanding of such an a\npriori simple system. The same is true when looking at nanoconfined water: The\nliquid between constituents in a cell is confined to such dimensions, and there\nis already evidence that such water can behave very differently from its bulk\ncounterpart. A striking finding has been reported from computer simulations for\ntwo-dimensionally confined water: The liquid displays continuous or\ndiscontinuous melting depending on its density. In order to understand this\nbehavior, we have analyzed the melting exhibited by a bilayer of nanoconfined\nwater by means of molecular dynamics simulations. At high density we observe\nthe continuous melting to be related to the phase change of the oxygens only,\nwith the hydrogens remaining liquid-like throughout. Moreover, we find an\nintermediate hexatic phase for the oxygens between the liquid and a triangular\nsolid ice phase, following the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory\nfor two-dimensional melting. The liquid itself tends to maintain the local\nstructure of the triangular ice, with its two layers being strongly correlated,\nyet with very slow exchange of matter. The decoupling in the behavior of the\noxygens and hydrogens gives rise to a regime in which the complexity of water\nseems to disappear, resulting in what resembles a simple monoatomic liquid.\nThis intrinsic tendency of our simulated water may be useful for understanding\nnovel behaviors in other confined and interfacial water systems.\n", "  Plasmonic metasurfaces are able to modify the wavefront by altering the light\nintensity, phase and polarization state. Active plasmonic metasurfaces would\nallow dynamic modulation of the wavefront which give rise to interesting\napplication such as beam-steering, holograms and tunable waveplates. Graphene\nis an interesting material with dynamic property which can be controlled by\nelectrical gating at an ultra-fast speed. We use a graphene-integrated\nmetasurface to induce a tunable phase change to the wavefront. The metasurface\nsupports a Fano resonance which produces high-quality resonances around 7.7\nmicrons. The phase change is measured using a Michleson interferometry setup.\nIt is shown that the reflection phase can change up to 55 degrees. In\nparticular the phase can change by 28 degrees while the amplitude is nearly\nconstant. The anisotropic optical response of the metasurface is used to\nmodulate the ellipticity of the reflected wave in response to an incident field\nat 45 degree. We show a proof of concept application of our system in\npotentially ultra-fast laser interferometry with sub-micron accuracy.\n", "  This paper consists of two parts.In the first part, the scatter components of\ncomputed tomograpahy dose profiles are modeled using various functions\nincluding the solution to Riccati's differential equation. These scatter\nfunctions are combined with primary components such as a trapezoidal function\nand a constructed function that uses the analytic continuation of Heaviside\nstep function. A mathematical theory is developed in Banach space. The modeled\nfunction is used to accurately fit data from the O-arm cone beam imaging\nsystem. In a second part of the paper, an approach to dosimtery is developed\nthat shows that the results obtained from the use of a pencil shaped ion\nchamber is equivalent to that from a farmer chamber. This result is verified by\npresenting some preliminary experimental data measured in a 64 slice Siemens\nSensation scanner.\n", "  We reveal the origin and structure of self-consistent source extensions of\nintegrable equations from the perspective of binary Darboux transformations.\nThey arise via a deformation of the potential that is central in this method.\nAs examples, we obtain in particular matrix versions of self-consistent source\nextensions of the sine-Gordon, nonlinear Schrodinger, KdV, Boussinesq, KP,\nDavey-Stewartson, two-dimensional Toda lattice and discrete KP systems. We also\nrecover a (2+1)-dimensional version of the Yajima-Oikawa system from a\ndeformation of the pKP hierarchy. By construction, these systems are\naccompanied by a hetero binary Darboux transformation, which generates\nsolutions of such a system from a solution of the source-free system and\nadditionally solutions of an associated linear system and its adjoint. The\nessence of all this is encoded in universal equations in the framework of\nbidifferential calculus.\n", "  In this work, we examine cosmological constraints on models of composite\ninflation based on the slow-roll approximation by using the recent Planck\nmeasurement. We compare the spectral index of curvature perturbation (and its\nrunning) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio predicted by such models with Planck\n2015 data. We find that the predictions of technicolor inflation are nicely\nconsistent with the Planck analysis. Moreover, the predictions from the second\nmodel, glueball inflation, are in good agreement with the Planck data at\n$2\\sigma$C.L. However, the final two models, super glueball inflation and\norientifold inflation, favor only the rather large value of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of which the predictions are in tension with the Planck\nanalysis.\n", "  Neutrinos are copiously emitted from black hole accretion disks playing a\nfundamental role in their evolution, as well as in the production of gamma ray\nbursts and r-process nucleosynthesis. The black hole generates a strong\ngravitational field able to change the properties of the emerging neutrinos. We\nstudy the influence of the black hole spin on the structure of the neutrino\nsurfaces, neutrino luminosities, average neutrino energies, and event counts at\nSuperK. We consider several disk models and provide estimates that cover\ndifferent black hole efficiency scenarios. We discuss the influence of the\ndetector's inclination with respect to the axis of the torus on neutrino\nproperties. We find that tori around spinning black holes have larger\nluminosities, energies and rates compared to tori around static black holes,\nand that the inclination of the observer causes a reduction in the luminosities\nand detection rates but an increase in the average energies.\n", "  We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements over 7-1251 K in CaMnO3\ncovering various phase transitions, and over 6-150 K in PrMnO3 covering the\nmagnetic transition. The excitations around 20 meV in CaMnO3 and at 17 meV in\nPrMnO3 are found to be associated with magnetic origin. In spite of similarity\nof the structure of the two compounds, the neutron inelastic spectrum of PrMnO3\nexhibits broad features at 150 K unlike well-defined peaks in the spectrum of\nCaMnO3. This might result from the difference in nature of interactions in the\ntwo compounds (magnetic and Jahn-Teller distortion). The interpretation and\nanalysis of the observed phonon spectra have been performed using ab-initio\nphonon calculations. We also discuss the effect of pressure on the structural\ndistortions in the orthorhombic phase of CaMnO3 and PrMnO3. On application of\npressure, we found that the variations of Mn-O distances are isotropic for\nCaMnO3 and highly anisotropic for PrMnO3. The calculated structure as a\nfunction of pressure in PrMnO3 shows that suppression of Jahn-Teller distortion\nand insulator to metal transition occurs simultaneously. Our calculations show\nthat this transition may not be associated with the occurrence of the\ntetragonal phase above 20 GPa as reported in the literature, since the\ntetragonal phase is found to be dynamically unstable although it is found to be\nenergetically favored over the orthorhombic phase above 20 GPa. CaMnO3 does not\nshow any phase transition up to 60 GPa.\n", "  We ask whether Hamiltonian vector fields defined on spaces of constant\nGaussian curvature $\\kappa$ (spheres, for $\\kappa>0$, and hyperbolic spheres,\nfor $\\kappa<0$), pass continuously through the value $\\kappa=0$ if the\npotential functions $U_\\kappa, \\kappa\\in\\mathbb R$, that define them satisfy\nthe property $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to 0}U_\\kappa=U_0$, where $U_0$ corresponds to the\nEuclidean case. We prove that the answer to this question is positive, both in\nthe 2- and 3-dimensional cases, which are of physical interest, and then apply\nour conclusions to the gravitational $N$-body problem.\n", "  Since the Fermi discovery of $\\gamma$-rays from novae, one of the biggest\nquestions in the field has been how novae generate such high-energy emission.\nShocks must be a fundamental ingredient. Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical\nspectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away\n(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low\nfrequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other\nnovae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in\nthe wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and\noptical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in\nV5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density\nenhancement and a subsequent faster flow. We speculate that the relatively high\nspeed and low mass of the ejecta led to the unusual radio emission from V5589\nSgr, and perhaps also to the non-detection of $\\gamma$-rays.\n", "  The core of a ferromagnetic vortex domain creates a strong, localized\nmagnetic field which can be manipulated on nanosecond timescales, providing a\nplatform for addressing and controlling individual nitrogen-vacancy center\nspins in diamond at room temperature, with nanometer-scale resolution. First,\nwe show that the ferromagnetic vortex can be driven into proximity with a\nnitrogen-vacancy defect using small applied magnetic fields, inducing\nsignificant nitrogen-vacancy spin splitting. Second, we find that the magnetic\nfield gradient produced by the vortex is sufficient to address spins separated\nby nanometer length scales. By applying a microwave-frequency magnetic field,\nwe drive both the vortex and the nitrogen-vacancy spins, resulting in enhanced\ncoherent rotation of the spin state. Finally we demonstrate that by driving the\nvortex on fast timescales, sequential addressing and coherent manipulation of\nspins is possible on $\\sim100$ ns timescales.\n", "  The Bakamjian-Thomas relativistic quark model, describing hadrons with a\nfixed number of constituents, yields in the heavy quark limit of QCD covariant\nIsgur-Wise functions and satisfies the whole tower of lowest moment sum rules\n(Bjorken-Uraltsev type sum rules). We first recall, as well as earlier results,\nthe new formalism presented in our recent papers on Lorentz representations,\nwhich provide an elegant framework for the analysis of this model in the heavy\nquark limit and stress the results which have been already obtained in this\ndirection. Then, we give some very explicit demonstrations of the fact that the\nBakamjian-Thomas framework satifies the sum rules by considering simple cases\nof Isgur-Wise functions. In addition to the specific Bjorken and Uraltsev sum\nrules, an important sum rule that involves only heavy mesons with light cloud\n$j^P = {1 \\over 2}^-$ and their radial excitations is demonstrated. This latter\nsum rule is phenomenologically interesting because it constrains the\nderivatives of the radially excited Isgur-Wise functions at zero recoil. On the\nother hand, we recall the limitations of the Bakamjian-Thomas scheme. At finite\nmass, current matrix elements with the current coupled to the heavy quark are\nno longer covariant, and higher moment sum rules that hold in the heavy quark\nlimit of QCD are not satisfied.\n", "  We formulate the deformation theory for instantons on nearly K\\\"ahler\nsix-manifolds using spinors and Dirac operators. Using this framework we\nidentify the space of deformations of an irreducible instanton with semisimple\nstructure group with the kernel of an elliptic operator, and prove that abelian\ninstantons are rigid. As an application, we show that the canonical connection\non three of the four homogeneous nearly K\\\"ahler six-manifolds G/H is a rigid\ninstanton with structure group H. In contrast, these connections admit large\nspaces of deformations when regarded as instantons on the tangent bundle with\nstructure group SU(3).\n", "  We analyze resonant light scattering by an atomic cloud in a regime where\nnear-field interactions between scatterers cannot be neglected. We first use a\nmicroscopic approach and calculate numerically the eigenmodes of the cloud for\nmany different realizations. It is found that there always exists a small\nnumber of polaritonic modes that are spatially coherent and superradiant. We\nshow that scattering is always dominated by these modes. We then use a\nmacroscopic approach by introducing an effective permittivity so that the\natomic cloud is equivalent to a dielectric particle. We show that there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the microscopic polaritonic modes and the\nmodes of a homogeneous particle with an effective permittivity.\n", "  Optical limiters transmit low-intensity light, while blocking laser radiation\nwith excessively high intensity or fluence. A typical passive optical limiter\nabsorbs most of the high level radiation, which can cause irreversible damage.\nIn this communication we report the first experimental realization of a\nreflective optical limiter, which does not absorb the high-level laser\nradiation, but rather reflects it back to space. The design is based on a\nperiodic layered structure composed of alternating SiO2 and Si3N4 layers with a\nsingle GaAs defect layer in the middle. At low intensities, the layered\nstructure displays a strong resonant transmission via the localized defect\nmode. At high intensities, the two-photon absorption in the GaAs layer\nsuppresses the localized mode along with the resonant transmission, the entire\nlayered structure turns highly reflective within a broad frequency range\ncovering the entire photonic band gap of the periodic layered structure. By\ncontrast, a stand-alone GaAs layer would absorb most of the high-level\nradiation, thus acting as a basic absorptive optical limiter. The proposed\ndesign can only perform at shortwave IR, where GaAs displays negligible linear\nabsorption and very strong nonlinear two-photon absorption. With judicious\nchoice of optical materials, the same principle can be replicated for any other\nfrequency range.\n", "  We present the optical luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxies for the\nCLASH-VLT cluster MACS J1206.2-0847 at z=0.439, based on HST and SUBARU data,\nincluding ~600 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies. The LFs on the wide\nSUBARU FoV are well described by a single Schechter function down to M~M*+3,\nwhereas this fit is poor for HST data, due to a faint-end upturn visible down\nM~M*+7, suggesting a bimodal behaviour. We also investigate the effect of local\nenvironment by deriving the LFs in four different regions, according to the\ndistance from the centre, finding an increase in the faint-end slope going from\nthe core to the outer rings. Our results confirm and extend our previous\nfindings on the analysis of mass functions, which showed that the galaxies with\nstellar mass below 10^10.5, M_sun have been significantly affected by tidal\ninteraction effects, thus contributing to the intra cluster light.\n", "  Given a system $M$ in a thermal bath we obtain a generalized detailed balance\nrelation for the ratio $r=\\pi_\\tau(K\\to J)/\\pi_\\tau(J\\to K)$ of the transition\nprobabilities $M:J\\to K$ and $M:K\\to J$ in time $\\tau$. We assume an active\nbath, containing solute molecules in metastable states. These molecules may\nreact with $M$ and the transition $J\\to K$ occurs through different channels\n$\\alpha$ involving different reactions with the bath. We find that $r=\\sum\np^\\alpha r^\\alpha$, where $p^\\alpha$ is the probability that channel $\\alpha$\noccurs, and $r^\\alpha$ depends on the amount of heat (more precisely enthalpy)\nreleased to the bath in channel $\\alpha$.\n", "  Recent work has explored binary waveguide arrays in the long-wavelength,\nnear-continuum limit, here we examine the opposite limit, namely the vicinity\nof the so-called anti-continuum limit. We provide a systematic discussion of\nstates involving one, two and three excited waveguides, and provide comparisons\nthat illustrate how the stability of these states differ from the monoatomic\nlimit of a single type of waveguide. We do so by developing a general theory\nwhich systematically tracks down the key eigenvalues of the linearized system.\nWhen we find the states to be unstable, we explore their dynamical evolution\nthrough direct numerical simulations. The latter typically illustrate, for the\nparameter values considered herein, the persistence of localized dynamics and\nthe emergence for the duration of our simulations of robust quasi-periodic\nstates for two excited sites. As the number of excited nodes increase, the\nunstable dynamics feature less regular oscillations of the solution's\namplitude.\n", "  A two-dimensional periodic optical force field, which combines conservative\ndipolar forces with vortices from radiation pressure, is proposed in order to\ninfluence the diffusion properties of optically susceptible nano-particles. The\ndifferent deterministic flow patterns are identified. In the low noise limit,\nthe diffusion coefficient is computed from a Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) and\nthe Most Probable Escape Paths (MPEP) are identified for those flow patterns\nwhich possess an stable stationary point. Numerical simulations of the\nassociated Langevin equations show remarkable agreement with the analytically\ndeduced expressions. Modifications of the force field are proposed so that a\nwider range of phenomena could be tested.\n", "  The Yang--Mills gradient flow and its extension to the fermion field provide\na very general method to obtain renormalized observables in gauge theory. The\nmethod is applicable also with non-perturbative regularization such as lattice.\nThe gradient flow thus offers useful probes to study non-perturbative dynamics\nof gauge theory. In this work, aiming at possible simplification in\nperturbative calculations associated with the gradient flow, a modification of\nthe gauge-fixed version of the flow equation, which preserves gauge covariance\nunder the background gauge transformation, is proposed. This formulation allows\nfor example a very quick one-loop calculation of the small flow time expansion\nof a composite operator that is relevant to the construction of a lattice\nenergy--momentum tensor. Some details of the calculation, which have not been\ngiven elsewhere, are presented.\n", "  We explore the mean and fluctuating redshifted 21 cm signal in numerical\nsimulations of cosmic reionization from the Cosmic Reionization On Computers\n(CROC) project. We find that the mean signal varies between about\n$\\pm20\\rm{mK}$. Most significantly, we find that the negative pre-reionization\ndip at $z\\sim10-15$ only extends to $\\langle\\Delta T_B\\rangle\\sim-20\\rm{mK}$,\nin agreement with prior simulation results and in significant contrast to\nPritchard & Loeb analytical model, requiring substantially higher sensitivity\nfrom global signal experiments that operate in this redshift range (EDGES-II,\nLEDA, SCI-HI, and DARE). We also explore the role of dense substructure\n(filaments and embedded galaxies) in the formation of 21 cm power spectrum. We\nfind that by neglecting the semi-neutral substructure inside ionized bubbles,\nthe power spectrum can be mis-estimated by 25-50\\% at scales $k\\sim\n0.1-1h\\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. This scale range is of a particular interest, because the\nupcoming 21 cm experiments (MWA, PAPER, HERA) are expected to be most sensitive\nwithin it.\n", "  The static-exchange model (SEM) and the modified static-exchange model (MSEM)\nrecently introduced by Ray [1] is applied to study the elastic collision\nbetween two hydrogen-like atoms when both are in ground states considering the\nsystem as a four-body Coulomb problem in the center of mass frame, in which all\nthe Coulomb interaction terms in direct and exchange channels are treated\nexactly. The SEM includes the non-adiabatic short-range effect due to\nelectron-exchange. The MSEM added in it, the long-range effect due to induced\ndynamic dipole polarizabilities between the atoms e.g. the Van der Waals\ninteraction. Applying the SEM code in different H-like two-atomic systems, a\nreduced mass dependence on scattering length is observed. Again applying the\nMSEM code on H(1s)-H(1s) elastic scattering and varying the minimum values of\ninteratomic distance, the dependence of scattering length on the effective\ninteratomic potential consistent with the existing physics are observed. Both\nthese basic findings in low and cold energy atomic collision physics are quite\nuseful and are being reported for the first time.\n", "  Chemical reactions involving diffusion of reactants and subsequent chemical\nfixation steps are generally termed \"diffusion-influenced\" (DI). Virtually all\nbiochemical processes in living media can be counted among them, together with\nthose occurring in an ever-growing number of emerging nano-technologies. The\nrole of the environment's geometry (obstacles, compartmentalization) and\ndistributed reactivity (competitive reactants, traps) is key in modulating the\nrate constants of DI reactions, and is therefore a prime design parameter. Yet,\nit is a formidable challenge to build a comprehensive theory able to describe\nthe environment's \"reactive geometry\". Here we show that such a theory can be\nbuilt by unfolding this many-body problem through addition theorems for special\nfunctions. Our method is powerful and general and allows one to study a given\nDI reaction occurring in arbitrary \"reactive landscapes\", made of multiple\nspherical boundaries of given size and reactivity. Importantly, ready-to-use\nanalytical formulas can be derived easily in most cases.\n", "  We outline new laser interferometer measurements to search for variation of\nthe electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and particle masses\n(including a non-zero photon mass). We propose a strontium optical lattice\nclock -- silicon single-crystal cavity interferometer as a novel small-scale\nplatform for these new measurements. Multiple passages of a light beam inside\nan interferometer enhance the effects due to variation of the fundamental\nconstants by the mean number of passages ($N_{\\textrm{eff}} \\sim 10^2$ for a\nlarge-scale gravitational-wave detector, such as LIGO, Virgo, GEO600 or\nTAMA300, while $N_{\\textrm{eff}} \\sim 10^5$ for a strontium clock -- silicon\ncavity interferometer). Our proposed laser interferometer measurements may be\nimplemented as an extremely precise tool in the direct detection of scalar dark\nmatter that forms an oscillating classical field or topological defects.\n", "  The complex X-ray system IGR J11014-6103 (a.k.a. the Lighthouse nebula) is\ncomposed of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (PWN) as well as large-scale\njet-like features, all launched by IGR J11014-6103 which is moving\nsupersonically in the interstellar medium. Previous observations suggested that\nthe jet features stem from a ballistic jet of relativistic particles. In order\nto confirm the nature of the jet and the marginally detected counter-jet, we\nobtained a new deep 250 ks Chandra observation of the Lighthouse nebula. We\nperformed detailed spatial and spectral analysis of all X-ray components of the\nsystem. The X-ray PWN is now better resolved and shows a clear bi-modal\nmorphology. The overall helical pattern of the main jet is confirmed. However,\nthere are large deviations from a simple helical model at small and large\nscales. Significant extended emission is now detected, encompassing the main\njet all along its length. The brightness dip of the main jet at ~50\" distance\nfrom the pulsar is confirmed, the extended emission however prevents\nconclusions about the coherence at this position of the jet. The counter-jet is\nnow detected at high statistical significance. In addition, we found two\nsmall-scale \"arcs\" departing from the pulsar towards the jets. We also looked\nfor possible bow-shock emission in front of the pulsar, with a short VLT/FORS2\nH-alpha observation. No clear emission is found, most likely because of\ncontamination from a diffuse surrounding nebulosity. The results of our X-ray\nanalysis show that current expectations from a ballistic nature of the jets can\nexplain satisfactorily some of the observational evidences but cannot fully\nreproduce the observations. The alternative scenario (diffusion of particles\nalong preexisting magnetic field lines in the surrounding medium) however also\ncontinues to suffer from conflicts with the observations.\n", "  We use Herschel 70 to 160um images to study the size of the far-infrared\nemitting region in about 400 local galaxies and quasar (QSO) hosts. The sample\nincludes normal `main-sequence' star-forming galaxies, as well as infrared\nluminous galaxies and Palomar-Green QSOs, with different levels and structures\nof star formation. Assuming Gaussian spatial distribution of the far-infrared\n(FIR) emission, the excellent stability of the Herschel point spread function\n(PSF) enables us to measure sizes well below the PSF width, by subtracting\nwidths in quadrature. We derive scalings of FIR size and surface brightness of\nlocal galaxies with FIR luminosity, with distance from the star-forming\nmain-sequence, and with FIR color. Luminosities L_FIR ~ 10^11 L_Sun can be\nreached with a variety of structures spanning 2 dex in size. Ultraluminous\nL_FIR >~ 10^12 L_Sun galaxies far above the main-sequence inevitably have small\nRe_70um ~ 0.5 kpc FIR emitting regions with large surface brightness, and can\nbe close to optically thick in the FIR on average over these regions. Compared\nto these local relations, first ALMA sizes for the dust emission regions in\nhigh redshift galaxies, measured at somewhat longer rest wavelengths, suggest\nlarger sizes at the same IR luminosity. We report a remarkably tight relation\nwith 0.15 dex scatter between FIR surface brightness and the ratio of [CII]\n158um emission and FIR emission -- the so-called [CII]-deficit is more tightly\nlinked to surface brightness than to FIR luminosity or FIR color. Among 33 z <~\n0.1 PG QSOs with typical L_FIR/L_Bol,AGN ~ 0.1, 19 have a measured 70um half\nlight radius, with median Re_70um = 1.1kpc. This is consistent with the FIR\nsize for galaxies with similar L_FIR but lacking a QSO, in accordance with a\nscenario where the rest FIR emission of these types of QSOs is, in most cases,\ndue to host star formation.\n", "  We study the properties of excited states in one-dimensional many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems using a matrix product state algorithm. First, the\nmethod is tested for a large disordered non-interacting system, where for\ncomparison we compute a quasi-exact reference solution via a Monte Carlo\nsampling of the single-particle levels. Thereafter, we present extensive data\nobtained for large interacting systems of L~100 sites and large bond dimensions\nchi~1700, which allows us to quantitatively analyze the scaling behavior of the\nentanglement S in the system. The MBL phase is characterized by a logarithmic\ngrowth (L)~log(L) over a large scale separating the regimes where volume and\narea laws hold. We check the validity of the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis. Our results are consistent with the existence of a mobility edge.\n", "  In this paper, we explicitly construct string theory backgrounds that realise\nthe so-called $\\mathcal N=2^\\star$ gauge theory. We prove the consistency of\nour models by calculating their partition function and obtaining the correct\ngauge theory spectrum. We further provide arguments in favour of the\nuniversality of our construction which covers a wide class of models all of\nwhich engineer the same gauge theory. We reproduce the corresponding Nekrasov\npartition function once the $\\Omega$-deformation is included and the\nappropriate field theory limit taken. This is achieved by calculating the\ntopological amplitudes $F_g$ in the string models. In addition to heterotic and\ntype II constructions, we also realise the mass deformation in type I theory,\nthus leading to a natural way of uplifting the result to the instanton sector.\n", "  Entanglement entropy is typically proportional to area, but sometimes it\nacquires an additional logarithmic pre-factor. We offer some intuitive\nexplanations for these facts.\n", "  The lifetime of quasars is fundamental for understanding the growth of\nsupermassive black holes, and is an important ingredient in models of the\nreionization of the intergalactic medium. However, despite various attempts to\ndetermine quasar lifetimes, current estimates from a variety of methods are\nuncertain by orders of magnitude. This work combines cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations and 1D radiative transfer to investigate the\nstructure and evolution of the He II Ly$\\alpha$ proximity zones around quasars\nat $z \\simeq 3-4$. We show that the time evolution in the proximity zone can be\ndescribed by a simple analytical model for the approach of the He II fraction\n$x_{\\rm HeII}\\left( t \\right)$ to ionization equilibrium, and use this picture\nto illustrate how the transmission profile depends on the quasar lifetime,\nquasar UV luminosity, and the ionization state of helium in the ambient IGM\n(i.e. the average He II fraction, or equivalently the metagalactic He II\nionizing background). A significant degeneracy exists between the lifetime and\nthe average He II fraction, however the latter can be determined from\nmeasurements of the He II Ly$\\alpha$ optical depth far from quasars, allowing\nthe lifetime to be measured. We advocate stacking existing He II quasar spectra\nat $z\\sim 3$, and show that the shape of this average proximity zone profile is\nsensitive to lifetimes as long as $\\sim 30$ Myr. At higher redshift $z\\sim 4$\nwhere the He II fraction is poorly constrained, degeneracies will make it\nchallenging to determine these parameters independently. Our analytical model\nfor He II proximity zones should also provide a useful description of the\nproperties of H I proximity zones around quasars at $z \\simeq 6-7$.\n", "  A systematic shell model description of the experimental Gamow-Teller\ntransition strength distributions in $^{42}$Ti, $^{46}$Cr, $^{50}$Fe and\n$^{54}$Ni is presented. These transitions have been recently measured via\n$\\beta$ decay of these $T_z$=-1 nuclei, produced in fragmentation reactions at\nGSI and also with ($^3${He},$t$) charge-exchange (CE) reactions corresponding\nto $T_z = + 1$ to $T_z = 0$ carried out at RCNP-Osaka.The calculations are\nperformed in the $pf$ model space, using the GXPF1a and KB3G effective\ninteractions. Qualitative agreement is obtained for the individual transitions,\nwhile the calculated summed transition strengths closely reproduce the observed\nones.\n", "  We present an improved and extended analysis of the cross-correlation between\nthe map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing potential derived from\nthe \\emph{Planck} mission data and the high-redshift galaxies detected by the\n\\emph{Herschel} Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) in the\nphotometric redshift range $z_{\\rm ph} \\ge 1.5$. We compare the results based\non the 2013 and 2015 \\textit{Planck} datasets, and investigate the impact of\ndifferent selections of the H-ATLAS galaxy samples. Significant improvements\nover our previous analysis have been achieved thanks to the higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the new CMB lensing map recently released by the\n\\textit{Planck} collaboration. The effective galaxy bias parameter, $b$, for\nthe full galaxy sample, derived from a joint analysis of the cross-power\nspectrum and of the galaxy auto-power spectrum is found to be $b =\n3.54^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$. Furthermore, a first tomographic analysis of the\ncross-correlation signal is implemented, by splitting the galaxy sample into\ntwo redshift intervals: $1.5 \\le z_{\\rm ph} < 2.1$ and $z_{\\rm ph}\\ge 2.1$. A\nstatistically significant signal was found for both bins, indicating a\nsubstantial increase with redshift of the bias parameter: $b=2.89\\pm0.23$ for\nthe lower and $b=4.75^{+0.24}_{-0.25}$ for the higher redshift bin.\nConsistently with our previous analysis we find that the amplitude of the cross\ncorrelation signal is a factor of $1.45^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ higher than expected\nfrom the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model for the assumed redshift distribution. The\nrobustness of our results against possible systematic effects has been\nextensively discussed although the tension is mitigated by passing from 4 to\n3$\\sigma$.\n", "  The effective potential of the Standard Model (SM), from three loop order and\nhigher, suffers from infra-red (IR) divergences arising from quantum effects\ndue to massless would-be Goldstone bosons associated with the longitudinal\npolarizations of the W and Z bosons. Such IR pathologies also hinder accurate\nevaluation of the two-loop threshold corrections to electroweak quantities,\nsuch as the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. However, these\ndivergences are an artifact of perturbation theory, and therefore need to be\nconsistently resummed in order to obtain a IR-safe effective potential. The\nso-called Two-Particle-Irreducible (2PI) effective action provides a rigorous\nframework to consistently perform such resummations, without the need to resort\nto ad hoc subtractions or running into the risk of over-counting contributions.\nBy considering the recently proposed symmetry-improved 2PI formalism, we\naddress the problem of the Goldstone-boson IR divergences of the SM effective\npotential in the gaugeless limit of the theory. In the same limit, we evaluate\nthe IR-safe symmetry-improved 2PI effective potential, after taking into\naccount quantum loops of chiral fermions, as well as the renormalization of\nspurious custodially breaking effects triggered by fermionic Yukawa\ninteractions. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with other\nmethods presented in the literature.\n", "  We present a set of experimental results identifying various effects that\ngovern the carrier dynamics of self-catalyzed GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires\n(NWs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy i.e. surface recombination velocity,\nsurface charge traps, and structural defects. Time-resolved photoluminescence\nof NW ensemble and spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence of single NWs reveal\nthat emission intensity, decay time and carrier diffusion length of the GaAs NW\ncores strongly depend on AlGaAs shell thickness but in a non-monotonic fashion.\nAlthough 7 nm-AlGaAs shell can efficiently suppress the surface recombination\nvelocity of the GaAs NW cores, the effect of the band bending caused by the\nsurface charges remains dominant if the shell thickness is less than 50 nm;\nthat is, the carrier diffusion length is smaller in the NWs with a thinner\nshell caused by a stronger carrier scattering at the core/shell interface. If\nthe AlGaAs shell thickness is larger than 50 nm, the luminescence efficiency of\nthe GaAs NW cores starts to be deteriorated, ascribed to the defect formation\ninside the AlGaAs shell evidenced by transmission electron microscopy.\n", "  We propose a new phenomenological law for the shape of the spectral lines in\nthe infrared, which accounts for the exponential decay of the extinction\ncoefficient in the high frequency region, observed in many spectra. We apply\nthis law to the measured infrared spectra of LiF, NaCl and MgF$_2$, finding a\ngood agreement, over a wide range of frequencies.\n", "  We make a consistent derivation, from the governing equations, of the\npressure transfer function in the small-amplitude Stokes wave regime and the\nhydrostatic approximation in the small-amplitude solitary water wave regime, in\nthe presence of a background shear flow. The results agree with the well-known\nformulae in the zero vorticity case,but they incorporate the effects of\nvorticity through solutions to the Rayleigh equation. We extend the results to\npermit continuous density stratification and to internal waves between two\nconstant-density fluids. Several examples are discussed.\n", "  The stopping power of Warm Dense Matter (WDM) is estimated by means of the\nindividual contributions of free electrons and bound electrons existing in this\nspecial kind of matter, located between classical and degenerate plasmas. For\nfree electrons, the dielectric formalism, well described in our studies, is\nused to estimate the free electron stopping power. For bound electrons, the\nmean excitation energy of ions is used. Excitation energies are obtained\nthrough atomic calculations of the whole atom or, shell by shell in order to\nestimate their stopping power. Influence of temperature and density is analyzed\nin case of an impinging projectile. This influence becomes important for low\nprojectile velocities and is negligible for high ones. Using free and bound\nelectron analysis, the stopping power of an extended WDM is inferred from a\ndynamical calculation of energy transferred from the projectile to the plasma,\nwhere the Bragg peak and stopping range are calculated. Finally, this\ntheoretical framework is used to study a typical plasma density profile of a\nWDM heated by lasers.\n", "  Following our previous paper, Bergeron et al, Smooth quantum dynamics of the\nmixmaster universe, Phys. Rev. D 92, 061302(R) (2015), concerning the\nquantization of the vacuum Bianchi IX model and the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer\nframework, we present a further analysis of the dynamical properties of the\nmodel. Consistently with the deep quantum regime, we implement the harmonic\napproximation of the anisotropy potential. We thus obtain manageable dynamical\nequations. We study the quantum anisotropic oscillations during the bouncing\nphase of the universe. Neglecting the backreaction from transitions between\nquantum anisotropy states we obtain analytical results. In particular, we\nidentify a parameter which is associated with dynamical properties of the\nquantum model and describes a sort of phase transition. Once the parameter\nexceeds its critical value, the Born-Huang-Oppenheimer approximation breaks\ndown. The application of the present result to a simple model of the Universe\nindicates that the parameter indeed exceeds its critical value and that there\ntakes place a huge production of anisotropy at the bounce. This in turn must\nlead to a sustained phase of accelerated expansion, an inflationary phase. The\nquantitative inclusion of backreaction shall be examined in a follow-up paper\nbased on the vibronic approach.\n", "  Quantum communication with systems of dimension larger than two provides\nadvantages in information processing tasks. Examples include higher rates of\nkey distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using\nsuch multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the\nexperimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation\nbetween randomness certification and computational requirements of the\npostprocessing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device\nindependent randomness certification from an experiment using a four\ndimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access\ncode. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires\nmore computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes\nimpossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still\nthere. We show that by dedicating more input settings of the experiment to\nrandomness certification, then by more computational postprocessing of the\nexperimental data which corresponds to a quantum violation, one may increase\nthe amount of certified randomness. Furthermore, we introduce a method that\nsignificantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification.\nOur results show how more randomness can be generated without altering the\nhardware and indicate a path for future semi-device independent protocols to\nfollow.\n", "  Convection of an internally heated fluid, confined between top and bottom\nplates of equal temperature, is studied by direct numerical simulation in two\nand three dimensions. The unstably stratified upper region drives convection\nthat penetrates into the stably stratified lower region. The fraction of\nproduced heat escaping across the bottom plate, which is one half without\nconvection, initially decreases as convection strengthens. Entering the\nturbulent regime, this decrease reverses in two dimensions but continues\nmonotonically in three dimensions. The mean fluid temperature, which grows\nproportionally to the heating rate ($H$) without convection, grows\nproportionally to $H^{4/5}$ when convection is strong in both two and three\ndimensions. The ratio of the heating rate to the fluid temperature is likened\nto the Nusselt number of Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection. Simulations are reported\nfor Prandtl numbers between 0.1 and 10 and for Rayleigh numbers (defined in\nterms of the heating rate) up to $5\\times10^{10}$.\n", "  In this work we address the problem of realizing a reliable quantum memory\nbased on zero-energy Majorana modes in the presence of experimental constraints\non the operations aimed at recovering the information. In particular, we\ncharacterize the best recovery operation acting only on the zero-energy\nMajorana modes and the memory fidelity that can be therewith achieved. In order\nto understand the effect of such restriction, we discuss two examples of noise\nmodels acting on the topological system and compare the amount of information\nthat can be recovered by accessing either the whole system, or the zero-modes\nonly, with particular attention to the scaling with the size of the system and\nthe energy gap. We explicitly discuss the case of a thermal bosonic environment\ninducing a parity-preserving Markovian dynamics in which the introduced memory\nfidelity decays exponentially in time, independent from system size, thus\nshowing the impossibility to retrieve the information by acting on the\nzero-modes only. We argue, however, that even in the presence of experimental\nlimitations, the Hamiltonian gap is still beneficial to the storage of\ninformation.\n", "  We present results from a numerical study of particle dispersion in the\nweakly nonlinear regime of Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection of a fluid with Prandtl\nnumber around unity, where bi-stability between ideal straight convection rolls\nand weak turbulence in the form of Spiral Defect Chaos exists. While Lagrangian\npair statistics has become a common tool for studying fully developed turbulent\nflows at high Reynolds numbers, we show that key characteristics of mass\ntransport can also be found in convection systems that show no or weak\nturbulence. Specifically, for short times, we find Richardson-like $t^3$\nscaling of pair dispersion. We explain our findings quantitatively with a model\nthat captures the interplay of advection and diffusion. For long times we\nobserve diffusion-like dispersion of particles that becomes independent of the\nindividual particles' stochastic movements. The spreading rate is found to\ndepend on the degree of spatio-temporal chaos.\n", "  Striatal projection neurons form a sparsely-connected inhibitory network, and\nthis arrangement may be essential for the appropriate temporal organization of\nbehavior. Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of\nLeaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal\npopulation activity, as observed in brain slices [Carrillo-Reid et al., J.\nNeurophysiology 99 (2008) 1435{1450]. In particular we develop a new metric to\ndetermine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form\nanti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells.\nWe found that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific\nsequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar\ninputs. Our results support the proposal [Ponzi and Wickens, PLoS Comp Biol 9\n(2013) e1002954] that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons\nallow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell\nassemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic\nsignaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in\ndisorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.\n", "  We discuss the magnetic responses of vector meson masses based on the hidden\nlocal symmetry (HLS) model in constant magnetic field, described by the\nlightest two-flavor system including the pion, rho and omega mesons in the\nspectrum. The effective masses influenced under the magnetic field are\nevaluated in a way of the derivative/chiral expansion established in the HLS\nmodel. At the leading order O(p^2) the g-factor of the charged rho meson is\nfixed to be 2, implying that the rho meson at this order is treated just like a\npoint-like spin-1 particle. Beyond the leading order, one finds anomalous\nmagnetic interactions of the charged rho meson, involving the anomalous\nmagnetic moment, which give corrections to the effective mass. It is then\nsuggested that up to O(p^4) the charged rho meson tends to become massless. Of\ninterest is that nontrivial magnetic-dependence of neutral mesons emerges to\ngive rise to the significant mixing among neutral mesons. Consequently, it\nleads to the dramatic enhancement of the omega meson mass, which is testable in\nfuture lattice simulations. Corrections from terms beyond O(p^4) are also\naddressed.\n", "  The weak gravity conjecture applied for the aligned natural inflation\nindicates that generically there can be a modulation of the inflaton potential,\nwith a period determined by sub-Planckian axion scale. We study the\noscillations in the primordial power spectrum induced by such modulation, and\ndiscuss the resulting observational constraints on the model.\n", "  Global Positioning System (GPS) dissemination of frequency standards is\nubiquitous at present, providing the most widespread time and frequency\nreference for the majority of industrial and research applications worldwide.\nOn the other hand, the ultimate limits of the GPS presently curb further\nadvances in high-precision, scientific and industrial applications relying on\nthis dissemination scheme. Here, we demonstrate that these limits can be\nreliably overcome even in laboratories without a local atomic clock by\nreplacing the GPS with a 642-km-long optical fiber link to a remote primary\ncaesium frequency standard. Through this configuration we stably address the\n$^1$S$_0$---$^3$P$_0$ clock transition in an ultracold gas of $^{173}$Yb, with\na precision that exceeds the possibilities of a GPS-based measurement,\ndismissing the need for a local clock infrastructure to perform high-precision\ntasks beyond GPS limit. We also report an improvement of two orders of\nmagnitude in the accuracy on the transition frequency reported in literature.\n", "  We derive a reduced quasi-one-dimensional theory of geometrically frustrated\nelastic ribbons. Expressed in terms of geometric properties alone, it applies\nto ribbons over a wide range of scales, allowing the study of their elastic\nequilibrium, as well as thermal fluctuations. We use the theory to account for\nthe twisted-to-helical transition of ribbons with spontaneous negative\ncurvature, and the effect of fluctuations on the corresponding critical\nexponents. The persistence length of such ribbons changes non-monotonically\nwith the ribbon's width, dropping to zero at the transition. This and other\nstatistical properties qualitatively differ from those of non-frustrated\nfluctuating filaments.\n", "  We examine a resonance structure of Floquet state in dynamic fractional Stark\nladder (DFSL) realized in biased semiconductor superlattices driven by a\nterahertz cw laser on the basis of the R-matrix Floquet theory. To do this, we\ncalculate an excess density of state $\\rho^{(ex)}(E)$ corresponding to lifetime\nof the Floquet state with a fractional matching ratio $\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is\nthe ratio of a Bloch frequency $\\Omega_B$ to a laser frequency $\\omega$,\nnamely, $\\eta=\\Omega_B/\\omega$. The results for $\\eta=3/2$ demonstrate the\nappearance of discernibly large peaks associated with Floquet states with\nlongevity in a region of relatively high laser-intensity. The underlying\nphysics is discussed in terms of an analytical expression of $\\rho^{(ex)}(E)$\nand the associated Green function in which ponderomotive couplings are included\nin a non-perturbative way.\n", "  Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanostructures in which a three\ndimensional potential trap produces an electronic quantum confinement, thus\nmimicking the behaviour of single atomic dipole-like transitions. However\nunlike atoms, QDs can be incorporated into solid state photonic devices such as\ncavities or waveguides that enhance the light-matter interaction. A near unit\nefficiency light-matter interaction is essential for deterministic, scalable\nquantum information (QI) devices. In this limit, a single photon input into the\ndevice will undergo a large rotation of the polarization of the light field due\nto the strong interaction with the QD. In this paper we measure a macroscopic\n($\\sim6^o$) phase shift of light as a result of the interaction with a\nnegatively charged QD coupled to a low quality-factor (Q$\\sim290$) pillar\nmicrocavity. This unexpectedly large rotation angle demonstrates this simple\nlow Q-factor design would enable near deterministic light-matter interactions.\n", "  We study a heavy impurity moving longitudinal with the direction of an\nexternal magnetic field in an anomalous chiral medium. Such system would carry\na non-dissipative current of chiral magnetic effect associated with the\nanomaly. We show, by generalizing Landau's criterion for superfluidity, that\nthe \"anomalous component\" which gives rise to the anomalous transport will {\\it\nnot} contribute to the drag experienced by an impurity. We argue on a very\ngeneral basis that those systems with a strong magnetic field would exhibit an\ninteresting transport phenomenon -- the motion of the heavy impurity is\nfrictionless, in analogy to the case of a superfluid. We demonstrate and\nconfirm our general results with two complementary examples: weakly coupled\nchiral fermion gases and strongly interacting chiral liquids.\n", "  A growing number of systems are represented as networks whose architecture\nconveys significant information and determines many of their properties.\nExamples of network architecture include modular, bipartite, and core-periphery\nstructures. However inferring the network structure is a non trivial task and\ncan depend sometimes on the chosen null model. Here we propose a method for\nclassifying network structures and ranking its nodes in a statistically\nwell-grounded fashion. The method is based on the use of Belief Propagation for\nlearning through Entropy Maximization on both the Stochastic Block Model (SBM)\nand the degree-corrected Stochastic Block Model (dcSBM). As a specific\napplication we show how the combined use of the two ensembles -SBM and dcSBM-\nallows to disentangle the bipartite and the core-periphery structure in the\ncase of the e-MID interbank network. Specifically we find that, taking into\naccount the degree, this interbank network is better described by a bipartite\nstructure, while using the SBM the core-periphery structure emerges only when\ndata are aggregated for more than a week.\n", "  We consider a metapopulation version of the Schelling model of segregation\nover several complex networks and lattice. We show that the segregation process\nis topology independent and hence it is intrinsic to the individual tolerance.\nThe role of the topology is to fix the places where the segregation patterns\nemerge. In addition we address the question of the time evolution of the\nsegregation clusters, resulting from different dynamical regimes of a\ncoarsening process, as a function of the tolerance parameter. We show that the\nunderlying topology may alter the early stage of the coarsening process, once\nlarge values of the tolerance are used, while for lower ones a different\nmechanism is at work and it results to be topology independent.\n", "  We consider the continuation of free and interacting scalar field theory to\nnon-integer spacetime dimension d. We find that the correlation functions in\nthese theories are necessarily incompatible with unitarity (or with reflection\npositivity in Euclidean signature). In particular, the theories contain\nnegative norm states unless d is a positive integer. These negative norm states\ncan be obtained via the OPE from simple positive norm operators, and are\ntherefore an integral part of the theory. At the Wilson-Fisher fixed point the\nnon-unitarity leads to the existence of complex anomalous dimensions. We\ndemonstrate that they appear already at leading order in the epsilon expansion.\n", "  A three-dimensional chiral helimagnet is analyzed using a mean-field (MF)\nanalysis and a classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation at finite temperatures. We\nconsider a Hamiltonian containing Heisenberg exchange and uni-axial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on a simple cubic lattice. Magnetization\ncurves calculated by the MF theory are qualitatively consistent with those\nobserved in experiments. A comparison between lattice and continuum models\nclarifies the region where the continuum approximation can be applied. By\ncombining the MF theory with the classical MC method, it is also clarified that\nresults are quantitatively much improved by including spin correlations in the\nlayer perpendicular to the helical axis. On the basis of our simple model,\ninteraction parameters in $CrNb_3S_6$ are estimated. These values of exchange\ninteractions justify a physical picture that the spins are strongly coupled in\nthe two-dimensional layer and are weakly interacted with those in the helical\nchain.\n", "  We theoretically generate nonclassical states from coherent state heralded by\nKnill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM)-type SU(3) interference. Injecting a coherent\nstate in signal mode and two single-photon sources in other two auxiliary modes\nof SU(3) interferometry, a broad class of useful nonclassical states are\nobtained in the output signal port after making two single-photon-counting\nmeasurements in the two output auxiliary modes. The nonclassical properties, in\nterms of anti-bunching effect and squeezing effect as well as the negativity of\nthe Wigner function, are studied in detail by adjusting the interaction\nparameters. The results show that the input coherent state can be transformed\ninto non-Gaussian states with higher nonclassicality after measurement\ninduction. The maximum squeezing of our generated states can be arrived at\nabout 1.9 dB.\n", "  We conduct laboratory experiments on the time evolution of an ice layer\ncooled from below and subjected to a turbulent shear flow of warm water from\nabove. Our study is motivated by observations of warm water intrusion into the\nocean cavity under Antarctic ice shelves, accelerating the melting of their\nbasal surfaces. The strength of the applied turbulent shear flow in our\nexperiments is represented in terms of its Reynolds number $\\textit{Re}$, which\nis varied over the range $2.0\\times10^3 \\le \\textit{Re} \\le 1.0\\times10^4$.\nDepending on the water temperature, partial transient melting of the ice occurs\nat the lower end of this range of $\\textit{Re}$ and complete transient melting\nof the ice occurs at the higher end. Following these episodes of transient\nmelting, the ice reforms at a rate that is independent of $\\textit{Re}$. We fit\nour experimental measurements of ice thickness and temperature to a\none-dimensional model for the evolution of the ice thickness in which the\nturbulent heat transfer is parameterized in terms of the friction velocity of\nthe shear flow. The melting mechanism we investigate in our experiments can\neasily account for the basal melting rate of Pine Island Glacier ice shelf\ninferred from observations.\n", "  We propose the new method of fluid structure investigation which is based on\nnumerical analytical continuation of structural correlation functions with Pade\napproximants. The method particularly allows extracting hidden structural\nfeatures of non-ordered condensed matter systems from experimental diffraction\ndata. The method has been applied to investigating the local order of liquid\ngallium which has non-trivial stricture in both the liquid and solid states.\nProcessing the correlation functions obtained from molecular dynamic\nsimulations, we show the method proposed reveals non-trivial structural\nfeatures of liquid gallium such as the spectrum of length-scales and the\nexistence of different types of local clusters in the liquid.\n", "  Precision measurements of the electron component in the cosmic radiation\nprovide important information about the origin and propagation of cosmic rays\nin the Galaxy not accessible from the study of the cosmic-ray nuclear\ncomponents due to their differing diffusion and energy-loss processes. However,\nwhen measured near Earth, the effects of propagation and modulation of galactic\ncosmic rays in the heliosphere, particularly significant for energies up to at\nleast 30 GeV, must be properly taken into account. In this paper the electron\n(e^-) spectra measured by PAMELA down to 70 MeV from July 2006 to December 2009\nover six-months time intervals are presented. Fluxes are compared with a\nstate-of-the-art three-dimensional model of solar modulation that reproduces\nthe observations remarkably well.\n", "  We demonstrate that a phase-insensitive parametric amplifier, coupled to a\nquantum correlated source, can be used as a quantum information tap for\nnoiseless three-way signal splitting. We find that the output signals are\namplified noiselessly in two of the three output ports while the other can more\nor less keep its original input size without adding noise. This scheme is able\nto cascade and scales up for efficient information distribution in an optical\nnetwork. Furthermore, we find this scheme satisfies the criteria for a\nnon-ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and thus can serve as a QND\nmeasurement device. With two readouts correlated to the input, we find this\nscheme also satisfies the criterion for sequential QND measurement.\n", "  The infuence of the conduction-electron spin magnetization density, induced\nin a two-dimensional electron layer by a microwave electromagnetic field, on\nthe rejection and transmission of the field is considered. Because of the\ninduced magnetization and electric current, both the electric and magnetic\ncomponents of the field should have jumps on the layer. A way to match the\nwaves on two sides of the layer, valid when the quasi-two-dimensional electron\ngas is in the one-mode state, is proposed. By following this way, the\namplitudes of transmitted and rejected waves as well as the absorption\ncoefficient are evaluated.\n", "  We propose a new type of edges, arising due to the anisotropy inherent in the\npuckered structure of a honeycomb system such as in phosphorene. Skewed-zigzag\nand skewed-armchair nanoribbons are semiconducting and metallic, respectively,\nin contrast to their normal edge counterparts. Their band structures are\ntunable, and a metal-insulator transition is induced by an electric field. We\npredict a field-effect transistor based on the edge states in skewed-armchair\nnanoribbons, where the edge state is gapped by applying arbitrary small\nelectric field $E_z$. A topological argument is presented, revealing the\ncondition for the emergence of such edge states.\n", "  Device-independent self-testing is the possibility of certifying the quantum\nstate and the measurements, up to local isometries, using only the statistics\nobserved by querying uncharacterized local devices. In this paper, we study\nparallel self-testing of two maximally entangled pairs of qubits: in\nparticular, the local tensor product structure is not assumed but derived. We\nprove two criteria that achieve the desired result: a double use of the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and the $3\\times 3$ Magic Square game.\nThis demonstrate that the magic square game can only be perfectly won by\nmeasureing a two-singlets state. The tolerance to noise is well within reach of\nstate-of-the-art experiments.\n", "  Park {\\it et al.} have reported eight times greater atomic-scale friction in\nthe periodic than in the quasiperiodic direction on the two-fold face of a\ndecagonal Al-Ni-Co quasicrystal. We present results of molecular-dynamics\nsimulations intended to elucidate mechanisms behind this giant frictional\nanisotropy. Simulations of a bare atomic-force-microscope tip on several model\nsubstrates and under a variety of conditions failed to reproduce experimental\nresults. On the other hand, including the experimental passivation of the tip\nwith chains of hexadecane thiol, we reproduce qualitatively the experimental\nanisotropy in friction, finding evidence for entrainment of the organic chains\nin surface furrows parallel to the periodic direction.\n", "  We study phase locking in the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators in the\nspecial case where the number of oscillators, $N$, is large but finite, and the\noscillators' natural frequencies are evenly spaced on a given interval. In this\ncase, stable phase-locked solutions are known to exist if and only if the\nfrequency interval is narrower than a certain critical width, called the\nlocking threshold. For infinite $N$, the exact value of the locking threshold\nwas calculated 30 years ago; however, the leading corrections to it for finite\n$N$ have remained unsolved analytically. Here we derive an asymptotic formula\nfor the locking threshold when $N \\gg 1$. The leading correction to the\ninfinite-$N$ result scales like either $N^{-3/2}$ or $N^{-1}$, depending on\nwhether the frequencies are evenly spaced according to a midpoint rule or an\nendpoint rule. These scaling laws agree with numerical results obtained by\nPaz\\'{o} [Phys. Rev. E 72, 046211 (2005)]. Moreover, our analysis yields the\nexact prefactors in the scaling laws, which also match the numerics.\n", "  We study photon localisation and delocalisation in a system of two nonlinear\ncavities with intensity-dependent coupling. It is shown that complete\nlocalisation or delocalisation is possible for proper choices of the strengths\nof nonlinearity, detuning and inter-cavity coupling. Role of the relative phase\nin the initial superposition in attaining localisation and delocalisation is\ndiscussed. Effects of dissipation and decoherence are considered and the use of\nquantum interference in reducing dissipation is explored. Many of the features\nof the system are shown to be the consequences of quantum interference.\n", "  Colonies of the green alga $Volvox$ are spheres that swim through the beating\nof pairs of flagella on their surface somatic cells. The somatic cells\nthemselves are mounted rigidly in a polymeric extracellular matrix, fixing the\norientation of the flagella so that they beat approximately in a meridional\nplane, with axis of symmetry in the swimming direction, but with a roughly 15\ndegree azimuthal offset which results in the eponymous rotation of the colonies\nabout a body-fixed axis. Experiments on colonies held stationary on a\nmicropipette show that the beating pattern takes the form of a symplectic\nmetachronal wave (Brumley et al. (2012)). Here we extend the Lighthill/Blake\naxisymmetric, Stokes-flow model of a free-swimming spherical squirmer\n(Lighthill (1952), Blake (1971b)) to include azimuthal swirl. The measured\nkinematics of the metachronal wave for 60 different colonies are used to\ncalculate the coefficients in the eigenfunction expansions and hence predict\nthe mean swimming speeds and rotation rates, proportional to the square of the\nbeating amplitude, as functions of colony radius. As a test of the squirmer\nmodel, the results are compared with measurements (Drescher et al. (2009)) of\nthe mean swimming speeds and angular velocities of a different set of 220\ncolonies, also given as functions of colony radius. The predicted variation\nwith radius is qualitatively correct, but the model underestimates both the\nmean swimming speed and the mean angular velocity unless the amplitude of the\nflagellar beat is taken to be larger than previously thought. The reasons for\nthis discrepancy are discussed.\n", "  This paper presents a number of problems concerning the practical (real)\nimplementation of the techniques known as Quantum Image Processing. The most\nserious problem is the recovery of the outcomes after the quantum measurement,\nwhich will be demonstrated in this work that is equivalent to a noise\nmeasurement, and it is not considered in the literature on the subject. It is\nnoteworthy that this is due to several factors: 1) a classical algorithm that\nuses Dirac's notation and then it is coded in MATLAB does not constitute a\nquantum algorithm, 2) the literature emphasizes the internal representation of\nthe image but says nothing about the classical-to-quantum and\nquantum-to-classical interfaces and how these are affected by decoherence, 3)\nthe literature does not mention how to implement in a practical way (at the\nlaboratory) these proposals internal representations, 4) given that Quantum\nImage Processing works with generic qubits this requires measurements in all\naxes of the Bloch sphere, logically, and 5) among others. In return, the\ntechnique known as Quantum Boolean Image Processing is mentioned, which works\nwith computational basis states (CBS), exclusively. This methodology allows us\nto avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters the results of the\nmeasured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended to quantum\nalgorithms outside image processing too.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamical instability of gaseous sphere under\nradial oscillations approaching the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om limit. For this\npurpose, we derive linearized perturbed equation of motion following the\nEulerian and Lagrangian approaches. We formulate perturbed pressure in terms of\nadiabatic index by employing the conservation of baryon numbers. A variational\nprinciple is established to evaluate characteristic frequencies of oscillations\nwhich lead to the criteria for dynamical stability. The dynamical instability\nof homogeneous sphere as well as relativistic polytropes with different values\nof charge in Newtonian and post-Newtonian regimes is explored. We also find\ntheir radii of instability in terms of the Reissner-Nordstrom radius. We\nconclude that dynamical instability occurs if the gaseous sphere contracts to\nthe Reissner-Nordst\\\"orm radius for different values of charge.\n", "  We report a dynamic light scattering study of the fluctuation modes in a\nthermotropic liquid crystalline mixture of monomer and dimer compounds that\nexhibits the twist-bend nematic ($\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$) phase. The results reveal a\nspectrum of overdamped fluctuations that includes two nonhydrodynamic and one\nhydrodynamic mode in the $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase, and a single nonhydrodynamic\nplus two hydrodynamic modes (the usual nematic optic axis or director\nfluctuations) in the higher temperature, uniaxial nematic phase. The properties\nof these fluctuations and the conditions for their observation are\ncomprehensively explained by a Landau-deGennes expansion of the free energy\ndensity in terms of heliconical director and helical polarization fields that\ncharacterize the $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ structure, with the latter serving as the\nprimary order parameter. A \"coarse-graining\" approximation simplifies the\ntheoretical analysis, and enables us to demonstrate quantitative agreement\nbetween the calculated and experimentally determined temperature dependence of\nthe mode relaxation rates.\n", "  We examine a mechanism by which excitons undergo ultrafast relaxation in\ncommon monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It is shown that at\ndensities $\\approx$ 1$\\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and temperatures $ \\le 60$ K,\nexcitons in well known monolayers (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$) exist\nas point-like structureless electron-hole quasi-particles. We evaluate the\naverage rate of exciton energy relaxation due to acoustic phonons via the\ndeformation potential and the piezoelectric coupling mechanisms and examine the\neffect of spreading of the excitonic wavefunction into the region perpendicular\nto the monolayer plane. Our results show that the exciton relaxation rate is\nenhanced with increase in the exciton temperature, while it is decreased with\nincrease in the lattice temperature. Good agreements with available\nexperimental data are obtained when the calculations are extrapolated to room\ntemperatures. A unified approach taking into account the deformation potential\nand piezoelectric coupling mechanisms shows that exciton relaxation induced by\nphonons is as significant as defect assisted scattering and trapping of\nexcitons by surface states in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  We present the first detailed study of the kinematics of free relativistic\nparticles whose symmetries are described by a quantum deformation of the de\nSitter algebra, known as $q$-de Sitter Hopf algebra. The quantum deformation\nparameter is a function of the Planck length $\\ell$ and the de Sitter radius\n$H^{-1}$, such that when the Planck length vanishes, the algebra reduces to the\nde Sitter algebra, while when the de Sitter radius is sent to infinity one\nrecovers the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e Hopf algebra. In the first limit the picture\nis that of a particle with trivial momentum space geometry moving on de Sitter\nspacetime, in the second one the picture is that of a particle with de Sitter\nmomentum space geometry moving on Minkowski spacetime. When both the Planck\nlength and the inverse of the de Sitter radius are non-zero, effects due to\nspacetime curvature and non-trivial momentum space geometry are both present\nand affect each other. The particles' motion is then described in a full phase\nspace picture. We find that redshift effects that are usually associated to\nspacetime curvature become energy-dependent. Also, the energy dependence of\nparticles' travel times that is usually associated to momentum space\nnon-trivial properties is modified in a curvature-dependent way.\n", "  Direct state tomography (DST) using weak measurements has received wide\nattention. Based on the concept of coupling-deformed pointer observables\npresented by Zhang \\emph{et al}.[Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{93}, 032128 (2016)], a\nmodified direct state tomography (MDST) is proposed, examined, and compared\nwith other typical state tomography schemes. MDST has exact validity for\nmeasurements of any strength. We identify the strength needed to attain the\nhighest efficiency level of MDST by using statistical theory. MDST is much more\nefficient than DST in the sense that far fewer samples are needed to reach\nDST's level of reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, MDST has no inherent bias\nwhen compared to DST.\n", "  Heat-assisted-magnetic recording (HAMR) is hoped to be the future recording\ntechnique for high density storage devices. Nevertheless, there exist several\nrealizations strategies. With a coarse-grained Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB)\nmodel we investigate in detail benefits and disadvantages of continuous and\npulsed laser spot recording of shingled and conventional bit-patterned media.\nAdditionally we compare single phase grains and bits having a bilayer structure\nwith graded Curie temperature, consisting of a hard magnetic layer with high\n$T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and a soft magnetic one with low $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$,\nrespectively. To describe the whole write process as realistic as possible a\ndistribution of the grain sizes and Curie temperatures, a displacement jitter\nof the head and the bit positions are considered. For all these cases we\ncalculate bit error rates of various grain patterns, temperatures and write\nhead positions to optimize the achievable areal storage density. Within our\nanalysis shingled HAMR with a continuous laser pulse moving over the medium\nreaches the best results, and thus having the highest potential to become the\nnext generation storage device.\n", "  Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into complex problems\nthat are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped\nions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with\nfewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. Here we study\nnon-equilibrium, quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous\nIsing interaction in a two-dimensional array of $^9$Be$^+$ ions in a Penning\ntrap. We verify entanglement in the form of spin-squeezed states for up to 219\nions, directly observing 4.0$\\pm$0.9 dB of spectroscopic enhancement. We also\nobserve evidence of non-Gaussian, over-squeezed states in the full counting\nstatistics. We find good agreement with ab-initio theory that includes\ncompetition between entanglement and decoherence, laying the groundwork for\nsimulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range\ninteractions, for which numerical solutions are, in general, classically\nintractable.\n", "  We discuss singlet fermion dark matter within a left-right symmetric model\npromoting baryon and lepton numbers as separate gauge symmetries. We add a\nsimple Dirac fermionic dark matter singlet under $SU(2)_{L,R}$ with nonzero and\nequal baryon and lepton number which ensures electric charge neutrality. Such a\ndark matter candidate interacts with SM particles through the extra\n$Z_{B,\\ell}$ gauge bosons. This can give rise to a dark matter particle of a\nfew hundred GeV that couples to $\\sim$ TeV scale gauge bosons to give the\ncorrect relic density. This model thus accommodates TeV scale $Z_{B,\\ell}$\ngauge bosons and other low scale BSM particles, which can be easily probed at\nLHC.\n", "  We examine a new multiverse scenario in which the component universes\ninteract. We focus our attention to the process of \"true\" vacuum nucleation in\nthe false vacuum within one single element of the multiverse. It is shown that\nthe interactions lead to a collective behaviour that might lead, under specific\nconditions, to a pre-inflationary phase and ensued distinguishable imprints in\nthe comic microwave background radiation.\n", "  We characterize the phase space for the infinite volume limit of a\nferromagnetic mean-field XY model in a random field pointing in one direction\nwith two symmetric values. We determine the stationary solutions and detect\npossible phase transitions in the interaction strength for fixed random field\nintensity. We show that at low temperature magnetic ordering appears\nperpendicularly to the field. The latter situation corresponds to a spin-flop\ntransition.\n", "  We show that optomechanical systems can test the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton\nequation of gravitational quantum mechanics due to Yang et al. This equation is\nmotivated by semiclassical gravity, a widely used theory of interacting\ngravitational and quantum fields. From the many-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton\nequation follows an approximate equation for the center-of-mass dynamics of\nmacroscopic objects. This predicts a distinctive double-peaked signature in the\noutput optical quadrature power spectral density of certain optomechanical\nsystems. Since the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton equation lacks free parameters, these\nwill allow its experimental confirmation or refutation.\n", "  In an experiment currently being performed at the Institute for High Energy\nPhysics, Serpukhov, Russia, a beam of charged kaons is directed on a copper\ntarget. In the electromagnetic field of the target nuclei, two reactions occur:\n$K^+ \\gamma \\to K^+ \\pi^0$ and $K^+ \\gamma \\to K^0 \\pi^+$. A peculiar\ndistinction between these two reactions is that there is a chiral anomaly\ncontribution in the former reaction, but not in the latter. This contribution\ncan be directly seen through comparison of the cross sections of these\nreactions near the threshold. We derive expressions for these cross sections\ntaking into account the anomaly and the contribution of the lightest vector\nmesons.\n", "  In this paper, we study the inviscid limit of the Sabra shell model of\nturbulence, which is considered as a particular case of a viscous conservation\nlaw in one space dimension with a nonlocal quadratic flux function. We present\na theoretical argument (with a detailed numerical confirmation) showing that a\nclassical deterministic solution before a finite-time blowup, $t < t_b$, must\nbe continued as a stochastic process after the blowup, $t > t_b$, representing\na unique physically relevant description in the inviscid limit. This theory is\nbased on the dynamical system formulation written for the logarithmic time\n$\\tau = \\log(t-t_b)$, which features a stable traveling wave solution for the\ninviscid Burgers equation, but a stochastic traveling wave for the Sabra model.\nThe latter describes a universal onset of stochasticity immediately after the\nblowup.\n", "  We use, for the first time, ab initio coupled-cluster theory to compute the\nspectral function of the uniform electron gas at a Wigner-Seitz radius of\n$r_\\mathrm{s}=4$. The coupled-cluster approximations we employ go significantly\nbeyond the diagrammatic content of state-of-the-art $GW$ theory. We compare our\ncalculations extensively to $GW$ and $GW$-plus-cumulant theory, illustrating\nthe strengths and weaknesses of these methods in capturing the quasiparticle\nand satellite features of the electron gas. Our accurate calculations further\nallow us to address the long-standing debate over the occupied bandwidth of\nmetallic sodium. Our findings indicate that the future application of\ncoupled-cluster theory to condensed phase material spectra is highly promising.\n", "  We compute all of the one-loop corrections that are enhanced, $O(\\lambda_i\n\\lambda_j / 16 \\pi^2)$, in the limit $s \\gg |\\lambda_i | v^2 \\gg M_{W}^2$, $s\n\\gg m_{12}^2$ to all the $2 \\to 2$ longitudinal vector boson and Higgs boson\nscattering amplitudes in the $CP$-conserving two-Higgs doublet model with a\nsoftly broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In the two simplified scenarios we\nstudy, the typical bound we find is $|\\lambda_i(s)| \\lessapprox 4$.\n", "  Recently, a non-relativistic off-shell formulation of three dimensional\nNewton-Cartan supergravity was proposed as the $c \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit of\nthree dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity in arXiv:1505.02095. In the\npresent paper we study supersymmetric backgrounds within this theory. Using\nintegrability constraints for the non-relativistic Killing spinor equations, we\nexplicitly construct all maximally supersymmetric solutions, which admit four\nsupercharges. In addition to these solutions, there are $\\frac{1}{2}$-BPS\nsolutions with reduced supersymmetry. We give explicit examples of such\nbackgrounds and derive necessary conditions for backgrounds preserving two\nsupercharges. Finally, we address how supersymmetric backgrounds of\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity are connected to the solutions found here in the\n$c \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit.\n", "  A combined approach of first-principles density-functional calculations and\nthe systematic cluster-expansion scheme is presented. The dipole, quadrupole,\nand Coulomb matrix elements obtained from ab initio calculations are used as an\ninput to the microscopic many-body theory of the excitonic optical response. To\ndemonstrate the hybrid approach for a nontrivial semiconductor system, the\nnear-bandgap excitonic optical absorption of rutile TiO2 is computed.\nComparison with experiments yields strong evidence that the observed\nnear-bandgap features are due to a dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed\n1s-exciton state.\n", "  We demonstrate optical detection of a broad spectrum of ferromagnetic\nexcitations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in an ensemble of nanodiamonds.\nOur recently developed approach exploits a straightforward CW detection scheme\nusing readily available diamond detectors, making it easily implementable. The\nNV center is a local detector, giving the technique spatial resolution, which\nhere is defined by our laser spot, but in principle can be extended far into\nthe nanoscale. Among the excitations we observe are propagating dipolar and\ndipolar-exchange spinwaves, as well as dynamics associated with the\nmulti-domain state of the ferromagnet at low fields. These results offer an\napproach, distinct from commonly used ODMR techniques, for spatially resolved\nspectroscopic study of magnetization dynamics at the nanoscale.\n", "  The mergers of binaries containing neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes\nare the most promising sources for direct detection in gravitational waves by\nthe interferometers Advanced LIGO and Virgo over the next few years. The\nconcurrent detection of electromagnetic emission from these events would\ngreatly enhance the scientific return of these discoveries. Here we review the\nstate of the art in modeling the electromagnetic signal of neutron star binary\nmergers across different phases of the merger and multiple wavelengths. We\nfocus on those observables which provide the most sensitive diagnostics of the\nmerger physics and the contribution to the synthesis of rapid neutron capture\n($r$-process) elements in the Galaxy. We also outline expected future\ndevelopments on the observational and theoretical sides of this rapidly\nevolving field.\n", "  Cooper pairs in two-dimensional unconventional superconductors with broken\ninversion symmetry are in a mixture of an even-parity spin-singlet pairing\nstate with an odd-parity spin-triplet pairing state. We study the magnetic\nproperties of the impurity bound states in such superconductors and find\nstriking signatures in their spin polarization which allow to unambiguously\ndiscriminate a non-topological superconducting phase from a topological one.\nMoreover, we show how these properties, which could be measured using\nspin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), also enable to determine\nthe direction of the spin-triplet pairing vector of the host material and thus\nto distinguish between different types of unconventional pairing.\n", "  The development of high efficiency perovskite solar cells has sparked a\nmultitude of measurements on the optical properties of these materials. For the\nmost studied methylammonium(MA)PbI$_3$ perovskite, a large range (6-55 meV) of\nexciton binding energies has been reported by various experiments. The\nexistence of excitons at room temperature is unclear. For the MAPb$X_3$\nperovskites we report on relativistic $GW$-BSE calculations. This method is\ncapable to directly calculate excitonic properties from first-principles. At\nlow temperatures it predicts exciton binding energies in agreement with the\nreported 'large' values. For MAPbI$_3$, phonon modes present in this frequency\nrange have a negligible contribution to the ionic screening. By calculating the\npolarisation in time from finite temperature molecular dynamics, we show that\nat room temperature this does not change. We therefore exclude ionic screening\nas an explanation for the experimentally observed reduction of the exciton\nbinding energy at room temperature.\n", "  We develop the theory of quantum transport and magnetoconductivity for\ntwo-dimensional electrons with an arbitrary large (even exceeding the Fermi\nenergy), linear-in-momentum Rashba or Dresselhaus spin-orbit splitting. For\nshort-range disorder potential, we derive the analytical expression for the\nquantum conductivity correction, which accounts for interference processes with\nan arbitrary number of scattering events and is valid beyond the diffusion\napproximation. We demonstrate that the zero-field conductivity correction is\ngiven by the sum of the universal logarithmic \"diffusive\" term and a\n\"ballistic\" term. The latter is temperature independent and encodes information\nabout spectrum properties. This information can be extracted experimentally by\nmeasuring the conductivity correction at different temperatures and electron\nconcentrations. We calculate the quantum correction in the whole range of\nclassically weak magnetic fields and find that the magnetoconductivity is\nnegative both in the diffusive and in the ballistic regimes, for an arbitrary\nrelation between the Fermi energy and the spin-orbit splitting. We also\ndemonstrate that the magnetoconductivity changes with the Fermi energy when the\nFermi level is above the \"Dirac point\" and does not depend on the Fermi energy\nwhen it goes below this point.\n", "  We construct an explicit realisation of the BMS$_3$ algebra with nonzero\ncentral charges using holomorphic free fields. This can be extended by the\naddition of chiral matter to a realisation having arbitrary values for the two\nindependent central charges. Via the introduction of additional free fields, we\nextend our construction to the minimally supersymmetric BMS$_3$ algebra and to\nthe nonlinear higher-spin BMS$_3$-W$_3$ algebra. We also describe an extended\nsystem that realises both the SU(2) current algebra as well as BMS$_3$ via the\nWakimoto representation, though in this case introducing a central extension\nalso brings in new non-central operators.\n", "  We study the quantum Hall effect of 2D electron gas in black phosphorus in\nthe presence of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. In the absence of a\nbias voltage, the external magnetic field leads to a quantization of the energy\nspectrum into equidistant Landau levels, with different cyclotron frequencies\nfor the electron and hole bands. The applied voltage reduces the band gap, and\neventually a semiconductor to semimetal transition takes place. This nontrivial\nphase is characterized by the emergence of a pair of Dirac points in the\nspectrum. As a consequence, the Landau levels are not equidistant anymore, but\nfollow the $\\varepsilon_n\\propto \\sqrt{nB}$ characteristic of Dirac crystals as\ngraphene. By using the Kubo-Bastin formula in the context of the kernel\npolynomial method, we compute the Hall conductivity of the system. We obtain a\n$\\sigma_{xy}\\propto 2n$ quantization of the Hall conductivity in the gapped\nphase (standard quantum Hall effect regime), and a $\\sigma_{xy}\\propto\n4(n+1/2)$ quantization in the semimetalic phase, characteristic of Dirac\nsystems with non-trivial topology.\n", "  We consider the gravity dual of the modular Hamiltonian associated to a\ngeneral subregion of a boundary theory. We use it to argue that the relative\nentropy of nearby states is given by the relative entropy in the bulk, to\nleading order in the bulk gravitational coupling. We also argue that the\nboundary modular flow is dual to the bulk modular flow in the entanglement\nwedge, with implications for entanglement wedge reconstruction.\n", "  Generalizing the kink operator of the Heisenberg spin 1/2 model, we construct\na set of Klein factors explicitly such that $(1+1)$ dimensional fermion\ntheories with arbitrary number of species are mapped onto the corresponding\nboson theories with the same number of species and vice versa. The actions for\nthe resultant theories do not possess any nontrivial Klein factor. With this\nset of Klein factors, we are also able to map the simple boundary states such\nas the Neumann and the Dirichlet boundary states, of the fermion (boson) theory\nonto those of the boson (fermion) theory. Applications of the Fermi-Bose\nequivalence with the constructed Klein factors to well-known $(1+1)$\ndimensional theories have been discussed.\n", "  We propose a tensor-network algorithm for discrete-time stochastic dynamics\nof a homogeneous system in the thermodynamic limit. We map a $d$-dimensional\nnonequilibrium Markov process to a $(d+1)$-dimensional infinite tensor network\nby using a higher-order singular-value decomposition. As an application of the\nalgorithm, we compute the nonequilibrium relaxation from a fully magnetized\nstate to equilibrium of the one- and two- dimensional Ising models with\nperiodic boundary conditions. Utilizing the translational invariance of the\nsystems, we analyze the behavior in the thermodynamic limit directly. We\nestimated the dynamical critical exponent $z=2.16(5)$ for the two-dimensional\nIsing model. Our approach fits well with the framework of the\nnonequilibrium-relaxation method. Our algorithm can compute time evolution of\nthe magnetization of a large system precisely for a relatively short period. In\nthe nonequilibrium-relaxation method, on the other hand, one needs to simulate\ndynamics of a large system for a short time. The combination of the two\nprovides a new approach to the study of critical phenomena.\n", "  Synchronization is of great scientific interest due to the abundant\napplications in a wide range of systems. We propose a scheme to achieve the\ncontrollable long-distance synchronization of two dissimilar optomechanical\nsystems, which are unidirectionally coupled through a fiber with light.\nSynchronization, unsynchronization, and the dependence of the synchronization\non driving laser strength and intrinsic frequency mismatch are studied based on\nthe numerical simulation. Taking the fiber attenuation into account, it's shown\nthat two mechanical resonators can be synchronized over a distance of tens of\nkilometers. In addition, we also analyze the unidirectional synchronization of\nthree optomechanical systems, demonstrating the scalability of our scheme.\n", "  Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar-mass black\nholes (BHs) have been theorized as the central engine of relativistic jets\nlaunched in massive star core collapse events or compact star mergers. In this\nwork, we calculate the electron neutrino/anti-neutrino spectra of NDAFs by\nfully taking into account the general relativistic effects, and investigate the\neffects of viewing angle, BH spin, and mass accretion rate on the results. We\nshow that even though a typical NDAF has a neutrino luminosity lower than that\nof a typical supernova (SN), it can reach $10^{50}-10^{51}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$\npeaking at $\\sim 10$ MeV, making them potentially detectable with the upcoming\nsensitive MeV neutrino detectors if they are close enough to Earth. Based on\nthe observed GRB event rate in the local universe and requiring that at least 3\nneutrinos are detected to claim a detection, we estimate a detection rate up to\n$\\sim$ (0.10-0.25) per century for GRB-related NDAFs by the Hyper-Kamiokande\n(Hyper-K) detector if one neglects neutrino oscillation. If one assumes that\nall Type Ib/c SNe have an engine-driven NDAF, the Hyper-K detection rate would\nbe $\\sim$ (1-3) per century. By considering neutrino oscillations, the\ndetection rate may decrease by a factor of 2-3. Detecting one such event would\nestablish the observational evidence of NDAFs in the universe.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the recently observed diphoton excess at\n$\\sim 750$ GeV can be explained by the decay of a scalar particle ($\\varphi$)\nto photons. If the scalar is the remnant of a symmetry-breaking sector of some\nnew gauge symmetry, its coupling to photons can be generated by loops of the\ncharged massive vectors of the broken symmetry. If these new $W^\\prime$ vector\nbosons carry color, they can also generate an effective coupling to gluons. In\nthis case the diphoton excess could be entirely explained in a simplified model\ncontaining just $\\varphi$ and $W^\\prime$. On the other hand if $W^{\\prime}$\ndoes not carry color, we show that, provided additional colored particles exist\nto generate the required $\\varphi$ to gluon coupling, the diphoton excess could\nbe explained by the same $W^{\\prime}$ commonly invoked to explain the diboson\nexcess at $\\sim 2$ TeV. We also explore possible connections between the\ndiphoton and diboson excesses with the anomalous $t\\bar{t}$ forward-backward\nasymmetry.\n", "  Solution-based perovskite nanoparticles have been intensively studied in past\nfew years due to their applications in both photovoltaic and optoelectronic\ndevices. Here, based on the common ground between the solution-based perovskite\nand random lasers, we have studied the mirrorless lasing actions in\nself-assembled perovskite nanoparticles. After the synthesis from solution,\ndiscrete lasing peaks have been observed from the optically pumped perovskites\nwithout any well-defined cavity boundaries. The obtained quality (Q) factors\nand thresholds of random lasers are around 500 and 60 uJ/cm2, respectively.\nBoth values are comparable to the conventional perovskite microdisk lasers with\npolygon shaped cavity boundaries. From the corresponding studies on laser\nspectra and fluorescence microscope images, the lasing actions are considered\nas random lasers that are generated by strong multiple scattering in random\ngain media. In additional to conventional single-photon excitation, due to the\nstrong nonlinear effects of perovskites, two-photon pumped random lasers have\nalso been demonstrated for the first time. We believe this research will find\nits potential applications in low-cost coherent light sources and biomedical\ndetection.\n", "  The high-frequency band of the $\\delta^{18}\\mbox{O}$ variations in the North\nGreenland Ice Core Project displays fluctuation levels that increase as one\napproaches the onset of an interstadial (warm) period. For some of the events\nit is possible to establish statistical significance using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations with a non-parametric null model with random phases and the same\nspectral density as the $\\delta^{18}\\mbox{O}$ record during the stadial\nperiods. Similar results are found for the locally estimated Hurst exponent for\nthe high-frequency fluctuations, and it is therefore natural to interpret these\nfindings as so-called \"critical slowing down\" signatures, i.e. early-warning\nsigns of tipping points. The observed \"slowing down\" is found to be similar\n(and perhaps even stronger) in the Younger Dryas, suggesting that there are\nsome similarities between mechanisms of the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition\nand the onsets of the Greenland interstadials. It is also verified that the\ntemperature fluctuations during the last glacial period are characterized by\nlong-range dependence, where the stadial periods can be approximately modeled\nas a $1/f$-noise. Persistent processes can take shape if the physical signal is\nan aggregation of several different processes, where each process responds to\nperturbations on a certain characteristic time scale. The results are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that both the onsets of the Greenland\ninterstadials and the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition are caused by tipping\npoints in dynamical processes with characteristic time scale of the order of\ndecades, and that the variability of other processes on longer time scales mask\nthe early-warning signatures in the $\\delta^{18}\\mbox{O}$ signal.\n", "  It is shown that the 750 GeV diphoton excess can be explained in extensions\nof Two-Higgs-Doublet Models that do not involve large multiplicities of new\nelectromagnetically charged states. The key observation is that at moderate and\nlarge $\\tan\\beta$ the total decay width of the 750 GeV Higgs is strongly\nreduced as compared to the Standard Model. This allows for much more economical\nchoices of new states that enhance the diphoton signal to fit the data. In\nparticular, it is shown that one family of vector-like quarks and leptons with\nSM charges is enough to explain the 750 GeV diphoton excess. Moreover, such\ncharge assignment can keep the 125 GeV Higgs signal rates exactly at the SM\nvalues. The scenario can interpret the diphoton excess provided that the total\ndecay width of a hypothetical resonance that would be measured at the LHC turns\nout to not exceed few GeV.\n", "  We study the cavity mode frequencies of a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity containing two\nvibrating dielectric membranes. We derive the equations for the mode resonances\nand provide approximate analytical solutions for them as a function of the\nmembrane positions, which act as an excellent approximation when the relative\nand center-of-mass position of the two membranes are much smaller than the\ncavity length. With these analytical solutions, one finds that extremely large\noptomechanical coupling of the membrane relative motion can be achieved in the\nlimit of highly reflective membranes when the two membranes are placed very\nclose to a resonance of the inner cavity formed by them. We also study the\ncavity finesse of the system and verify that, under the conditions of large\ncoupling, it is not appreciably affected by the presence of the two membranes.\nThe achievable large values of the ratio between the optomechanical coupling\nand the cavity decay rate, $g/\\kappa$, make this two-membrane system the\nsimplest promising platform for implementing cavity optomechanics in the strong\ncoupling regime.\n", "  In this paper, we classify all irreducible weight modules with\nfinite-dimensional weight spaces over the affine-Virasoro Lie algebra of type\n$A_1$.\n", "  We interpret the recently observed excess in diphoton invariant mass as a new\nspin-0 resonant particle. On the theoretical ground, an interesting question is\nwhether this new scalar resonance belongs to a strongly coupled sector or a\nwell-defined weakly coupled theory. A possible UV-completion that has been\nwidely considered in literature is based on the existence of new vector-like\nfermions whose loop contributions---Yukawa-coupled to the new\nresonance---explain the observed signal rate. The large total width\npreliminarily suggested by data seems to favor a large Yukawa coupling, at the\nborder of a healthy perturbative definition. This potential problem can be\nfixed by introducing multiple vector-like fermions or large electric charges,\nbringing back the theory to a weakly coupled regime. However, this solution\nrisks to be only a low-energy mirage: Large multiplicity or electric charge can\ndangerously reintroduce the strong regime by modifying the renormalization\ngroup running of the dimensionless couplings. This issue is also tightly\nrelated to the (in)stability of the scalar potential. First, we study---in the\ntheoretical setup described above---the parametric behavior of the diphoton\nsignal rate, total width, and one-loop $\\beta$ functions. Then, we numerically\nsolve the renormalization group equations, taking into account the observed\ndiphoton signal rate and total width, to investigate the fate of the weakly\ncoupled theory. We find that---with the only exception of few fine-tuned\ndirections---weakly coupled interpretations of the excess are brought back to a\nstrongly coupled regime if the running is taken into account.\n", "  We study the surface transport properties of stationary localized\nconfigurations of relativistic fluids to the first two non-trivial orders in a\nderivative expansion. By demanding that these finite lumps of relativistic\nfluid are described by a thermal partition function with arbitrary stationary\nbackground metric and gauge fields, we are able to find several constraints\namong surface transport coefficients. At leading order, besides recovering the\nsurface thermodynamics, we obtain a generalization of the Young-Laplace\nequation for relativistic fluid surfaces, by considering a temperature\ndependence in the surface tension, which is further generalized in the context\nof superfluids. At the next order, for uncharged fluids in 3+1 dimensions, we\nshow that besides the 3 independent bulk transport coefficients previously\nknown, a generic localized configuration is characterized by 3 additional\nsurface transport coefficients, one of which may be identified with the surface\nmodulus of rigidity. Finally, as an application, we study the effect of\ntemperature dependence of surface tension on some explicit examples of\nlocalized fluid configurations, which are dual to certain non-trivial black\nhole solutions via the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  Secular and mean motion resonances (MMR) are effective perturbations for\nshaping planetary systems. In binary star systems, they play a key role during\nthe early and late phases of planetary formation, as well as for the dynamical\nstability of a planetary system. In this study, we aim to correlate the\npresence of orbital resonances with the rate of icy asteroids crossing the\nhabitable zone (HZ), from a circumprimary disk of planetesimals in various\nbinary star systems. We modelled a belt of small bodies in the inner and outer\nregions, interior and exterior to the orbit of a gas giant planet,\nrespectively. The planetesimals are equally placed around a primary G-type star\nand move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and the gas giant.\nWe numerically integrated the system for 50 Myr, considering various parameters\nfor the secondary star. Its stellar type varies from a M- to F-type; its\nsemimajor axis is either 50 au or 100 au, and its eccentricity is either 0.1 or\n0.3. For comparison, we also varied the gas giant's orbital and physical\nparameters. Our simulations highlight that a disk of planetesimals will suffer\nfrom perturbations owing to a perturbed gas giant, mean motion, and secular\nresonances. We show that a secular resonance -- with location and width varying\naccording to the secondary star's characteristics -- can exist in the icy\nasteroid belt region and overlap with MMRs which have an impact on the\ndynamical lifetime of the disk. In addition, we point out that in any case, the\n2:1 MMR, the 5:3 MMR and the secular resonance are powerful perturbations for\nthe flux of icy asteroids towards the HZ and the transport of water therein.\n", "  We investigate the problem of finding a pure spin-connection formulation of\nGeneral Relativity with non-vanishing cosmological constant. We first revisit\nthe problem at the linearised level and find that the pure spin-connection,\nquadratic Lagrangian, takes a form reminiscent to Weyl gravity, given by the\nsquare of a Weyl-like tensor. Upon Hodge dualisation, we show that the dual\ngauge field in (A)dS$_D$ transforms under $GL(D)$ in the same representation as\na massive graviton in the flat spacetime of the same dimension. We give a\ndetailed proof that the physical degrees of freedom indeed correspond to a\nmassless graviton propagating around the (anti-) de Sitter background and\nfinally speculate about a possible nonlinear pure-connection theory dual to\nGeneral Relativity with cosmological constant.\n", "  Miura-type transformations (MTs) are an essential tool in the theory of\nintegrable nonlinear partial differential and difference equations. We present\na geometric method to construct MTs for differential-difference (lattice)\nequations from Darboux-Lax representations (DLRs) of such equations.\n  The method is applicable to parameter-dependent DLRs satisfying certain\nconditions. We construct MTs and modified lattice equations from invariants of\nsome Lie group actions on manifolds associated with such DLRs.\n  Using this construction, from a given suitable DLR one can obtain many MTs of\ndifferent orders. The main idea behind this method is closely related to the\nresults of Drinfeld and Sokolov on MTs for the partial differential KdV\nequation.\n  Considered examples include the Volterra, Narita-Itoh-Bogoyavlensky, Toda,\nand Adler-Postnikov lattices. Some of the constructed MTs and modified lattice\nequations seem to be new.\n", "  Recently the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC announced their\nobservation of a potential 750 GeV di-photon resonance, after analyzing the\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV LHC data. This observation has significant implications for\nlow-energy supersymmetry. Beyond the MSSM and the NMSSM, we study the\nMSSM-extensions with an extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry. The anomaly cancellation\nand the spontaneous breaking of the non-decoupled $U(1)'$ generically require\nintroducing vector-like supermultiplets (both colored and color-neutral ones)\nand singlet supermultiplets, respectively. We illustrate that the potential 750\nGeV resonance ($Y$) can be accommodated in various mechanisms, as a\nsinglet-like scalar or pseudoscalar. Three benchmark scenarios are presented:\n(1) vector-like quarks (VLQ) mediated $pp \\to Y \\to \\gamma \\gamma$; (2) scalar\nVLQ mediated $pp \\to Y \\to \\gamma \\gamma$; (3) heavy scalar (pseudo-scalar)\n$H/A$ associated production $pp \\to H^*/A^* \\to Y H/h$. Additionally, we notice\nthat the $Z'$-mediated vector boson fusion production and $Z'$-associated\nproduction $pp \\to Y qq'$, if yielding a signal rate of the observed level,\nmight have been excluded by the searches for $Z'$ via Drell-Yan process at the\nLHC.\n", "  Motivated by the ongoing Spitzer observational campaign, and the forecoming\nK2 one, we revisit, working in an heliocentric reference frame, the geometrical\nfoundation for the analysis of the microlensing parallax, as measured with the\nsimultaneous observation of the same microlensing event from two observers with\nrelative distance of order AU. For the case of observers at rest we discuss the\nwell known fourfold microlensing parallax degeneracy and determine an equation\nfor the degenerate directions of the lens trajectory. For the case of observers\nin motion, we write down an extension of the Gould (1994) relationship between\nthe microlensing parallax and the observable quantities and, at the same time,\nwe highlight the functional dependence of these same quantities from the\ntimescale of the underlying microlensing event. Furthermore, through a series\nof examples, we show the importance of taking into account the motion of the\nobservers to correctly recover the parameters of the underlying microlensing\nevent. In particular we discuss the cases of the amplitude of the microlensing\nparallax and that of the difference of the timescales between the observed\nmicrolensing events, key to understand the breaking of the microlensing\nparallax degeneracy. Finally, we consider the case of the simultaneous\nobservation of the same microlensing event from ground and two satellites, a\ncase relevant for the expected joint K2 and Spitzer observational programs in\n2016.\n", "  We consider the two-dimensional Blume-Capel model with zero chemical\npotential and small magnetic field evolving on a large but finite torus. We\nobtain sharp estimates for the transition time, we characterize the set of\ncritical configurations, and we prove the metastable behavior of the dynamics\nas the temperature vanishes.\n", "  Interpreting the diphoton mass excesses near 750~GeV reported by ATLAS and\nCMS as pseudoscalar gluinonia, bound states of two gluinos, we perform a scan\nin Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetry parameter space, fixing $m_{\\tilde{g}}\\approx\n380$~GeV and identifying an experimentally viable point. We generate events\nwith this point, perform fast simulation, and carry out an analysis modeled on\nthe ATLAS search which reproduces features of the diphoton excess. This\ninterpretation requires an enhancement of the signal strength above the nominal\nrate found in the literature and neglecting the gaugino mass unification\nconstraint $M_{3}\\approx 3M_{2}$.\n", "  A search for a Higgs boson with suppressed couplings to fermions, $h_f$,\nassumed to be the neutral, lower-mass partner of the Higgs boson discovered at\nthe Large Hadron Collider, is reported. Such a Higgs boson could exist in\nextensions of the standard model with two Higgs doublets, and could be produced\nvia $p\\bar{p} \\to H^\\pm h_f \\to W^* h_f h_f \\to 4\\gamma + X$, where $H^\\pm$ is\na charged Higgs boson. This analysis uses all events with at least three\nphotons in the final state from proton-antiproton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 1.96~TeV collected by the Collider Detector at\nFermilab, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.2~${\\rm fb}^{-1}$. No\nevidence of a signal is observed in the data. Values of Higgs-boson masses\nbetween 10 and 100 GeV/$c^2$ are excluded at 95\\% Bayesian credibility.\n", "  A gauge U(1) framework was established in 2002 to extend the supersymmetric\nstandard model. It has many possible realizations. Whereas all have the\nnecessary and sufficient ingredients to explain the possible 750 GeV diphoton\nexcess, observed recently by the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC), they differ in other essential aspects. A compendium of such\nmodels is discussed.\n", "  We evaluate the light, strange and charm scalar content of the nucleon using\none lattice QCD ensemble generated with two degenerate light quarks with mass\nfixed to their physical value. We use improved techniques to evaluate the\ndisconnected quark loops to sufficient accuracy to determine the strange and\ncharm nucleon $\\sigma$-terms. in addition to the light quark content\n$\\sigma_{\\pi N}$. We find $\\sigma_{\\pi N}$=$37.2(2.6)(^{4.7}_{2.9})$ MeV\n$\\sigma_{s}$=$41.1(8.2)(^{7.8}_{5.8})$ MeV and\n$\\sigma_c$=$79(21)(^{12}_{\\phantom{1}8})$ MeV, where the first error is\nstatistical and the second is the systematic error due to the determination of\nthe lattice spacing, the assessment of finite volume and residual excited state\neffects.\n", "  The question whether a given quantum state is a ground or thermal state of a\nfew-body Hamiltonian can be used to characterize the complexity of the state\nand is important for possible experimental implementations. We provide methods\nto characterize the states generated by two- and, more generally, k-body\nHamiltonians as well as the convex hull of these sets. This leads to new\ninsights into the question which states are uniquely determined by their\nmarginals and to a generalization of the concept of entanglement. Finally,\ncertification methods for quantum simulation can be derived.\n", "  A slight excess has been observed in the first data of photon-photon events\nat the 13 TeV LHC, that might be interpreted has a hint of physics beyond the\nStandard Model. We show that a completely model-independent measurement of the\nphoton-photon coupling of a putative 750 GeV resonance will be possible using\nthe forward proton detectors scheduled at ATLAS and CMS.\n", "  We consider a periodic waveguide array whose unit cell consists of a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quadrimer with two competing loss/gain parameter pairs\nwhich lead to qualitatively different symmetry-broken phases. It is shown that\nthe transitions between the phases are described by a symmetry-adapted nonlocal\ncurrent which maps the spectral properties to the spatially resolved field, for\nthe lattice as well as for the isolated quadrimer. Its site-average acts like a\nnatural order parameter for the general class of one-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians, vanishing in the unbroken phase and\nbeing nonzero in the broken phase. We investigate how the beam dynamics in the\narray is affected by the presence of competing loss/gain rates in the unit\ncell, showing that the enriched band structure yields the possibility to\ncontrol the propagation length before divergence when the system resides in the\nbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$ phase.\n", "  We have recently suggested that tiny black holes can act as nucleation seeds\nfor the decay of the metastable Higgs vacuum. Previous results applied only to\nthe nucleation of thin-wall bubbles, and covered a very small region of\nparameter space. This paper considers bubbles of arbitrary profile and reaches\nthe same conclusion: black holes seed rapid vacuum decay. Seeded and unseeded\nnucleation rates are compared, and the gravitational back reaction of the\nbubbles is taken into account. The evolution of the bubble interior is\ndescribed for the unseeded nucleation. Results are presented for the\nrenormalisation group improved Standard Model Higgs potential, and a simple\neffective model representing new physics.\n", "  A path method is implemented in order to precisely and generally describe the\ncollapse of isolated skyrmions in a Co/Pt(111) monolayer, on the basis of\natomic scale simulations. Two collapse mechanisms with different energy\nbarriers are found. The most obvious path, featuring a homogeneous shrinking\ngives the largest energy, whereas the lowest energy barrier is shown to comply\nwith the outcome of Langevin dynamics under a destabilizing field of 0.25 T,\nwith a lifetime of 20~ns at around 80~K. For this lowest energy barrier path,\nskyrmion destabilization occurs much before any topology change, suggesting\nthat topology plays a minor role in the skyrmion stability. On the contrary, an\nimportant role appears devoted to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,\nestablishing a route towards improved skyrmion stability.\n", "  The substantial turmoil created by both 2000 dot-com crash and 2008 subprime\ncrisis has fueled the belief that the two classical paradigms of economics,\nwhich are the invisible hand and the rational agent, are not appropriate to\ndescribe market dynamics and should be abandoned at the benefit of alternative\nnew theoretical concepts. At odd with such a view, using a simple model of\nchoice dynamics from sociophysics, the invisible hand and the rational agent\nparadigms are given a new legitimacy. Indeed, it is sufficient to introduce the\nholding of a few intermediate mini market aggregations by agents sharing their\nown private information, to recenter the invisible hand and the rational agent\nat the heart of market self regulation including the making of bubbles and\ntheir subsequent crashes. In so doing, an elasticity is discovered in the\nmarket efficiency mechanism due to the existence of agents anticipation. This\nelasticity is found to create spontaneous bubbles, which are rationally\nfounded, and at the same time, it provokes crashes when the limit of elasticity\nis reached. Although the findings disclose a path to put an end to the\nbubble-crash phenomena, it is argued to be rationality not feasible.\n", "  Single crystals of RPd${_2}$P${_2}$ (R=Y, La-Nd, Sm-Ho, Yb) were grown out of\na high temperature solution rich in Pd and P and characterized by\nroom-temperature powder X-ray diffraction, anisotropic temperature- and\nfield-dependent magnetization and temperature-dependent in-plane resistivity\nmeasurements. In this series, YPd${_2}$P${_2}$ and LaPd${_2}$P${_2}$ and\nYbPd${_2}$P${_2}$ (with Yb$^{+2}$) are non local-moment bearing, whereas\nCePd${_2}$P${_2}$ and PrPd${_2}$P${_2}$ order at low temperature with a\nferromagnetic component along the crystallographic c-axis. The rest of the\nseries manifest low temperature antiferromagnetic ordering. EuPd${_2}$P${_2}$\nhas Eu$^{+2}$ ions and both EuPd${_2}$P${_2}$ and GdPd${_2}$P${_2}$ have\nisotropic paramagnetic susceptibilities consistent with $L = 0$ and\n$J=S=\\frac{7}{2}$ and exhibit multiple magnetic transitions. For R=Eu-Dy, there\nare multiple, $T>1.8$ K transitions in zero applied magnetic field and for\nR=Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy there are clear metamagnetic transitions at T=2.0 K\nfor $H<55$ kOe. Strong anisotropies arising mostly from crystal electric field\n(CEF) effects were observed for most magnetic rare earths with $L\\neq 0$. The\nexperimentally estimated CEF parameters B$^2_0$ were calculated from the\nanisotropic paramagnetic $\\theta_{ab}$ and $ \\theta_{c}$ values and compared to\ntheoretical trends across the rare earth series. The ordering temperatures as\nwell as the polycrystalline averaged paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature,\n$\\theta_{ave}$, were extracted from magnetization and resistivity measurements,\nand compared to the de-Gennes factor.\n", "  We have revisited the valence band electronic structure of NiO by means of\nhard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) together with theoretical\ncalculations using both the GW method and the local density approximation +\ndynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT) approaches. The effective impurity\nproblem in DMFT is solved through the exact diagonalization (ED) method. We\nshow that the LDA+DMFT method alone cannot explain all the observed structures\nin the HAXPES spectra. GW corrections are required for the O bands and Ni-s and\np derived states to properly position their binding energies. Our results\nestablish that a combination of the GW and DMFT methods is necessary for\ncorrectly describing the electronic structure of NiO in a proper ab-initio\nframework. We also demonstrate that the inclusion of photoionization cross\nsection is crucial to interpret the HAXPES spectra of NiO.We argue that our\nconclusions are general and that the here suggested approach is appropriate for\nany complex transition metal oxide.\n", "  We consider the isotropic XY quantum spin chain in a random external field in\nthe $z$ direction, with single site distributions given by i.i.d. random\nvariables times the critical decaying envelope $j^{-1/2}$. Our motivation is\nthe study of many-body localization. We investigate transport properties in\nterms of polynomial Lieb-Robinson (PLR) bounds. We prove a zero-velocity PLR\nbound for large disorder strength $\\lambda$ and for small $\\lambda$ we show a\npartial converse, which suggests the existence of non-trivial transport in the\nmodel.\n", "  To study the superconducting gap structure of BiS$_2$-based layered compound\nNdO$_{0.71}$F$_{0.29}$BiS$_{2}$ ($T$$_{\\rm c}$ = 5 K), we measured the thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa$, which is a sensitive probe of the low-energy\nquasiparticle spectrum. In the absence of a magnetic field, there is only a\nvery small residual linear term in the thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{0}$/$T$ at\n$T$ $\\rightarrow$ 0, indicating the absence of a residual normal fluid,\nexpected for nodal superconductors. Moreover, the applied magnetic field hardly\naffects the thermal conductivity in the wide range of the vortex state,\nindicating the absence of Doppler shifted quasiparticles. These results provide\nevidence that NdO$_{0.71}$F$_{0.29}$BiS$_{2}$ is fully gapped superconductor.\nThe obtained gap structure, along with the robustness of the superconductivity\nagainst the impurity, suggest a conventional $s$-wave superconducting state in\nNdO$_{0.71}$F$_{0.29}$BiS$_{2}$.\n", "  Although the quality of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates has been\nsteadily improving, the available quantity of qubits has increased quite\nslowly. To address this important issue in quantum computing, we have\ndemonstrated arbitrary single qubit gates based on targeted phase shifts, an\napproach that can be applied to atom, ion or other atom-like systems. These\ngates are highly insensitive to addressing beam imperfections and have little\ncrosstalk, allowing for a dramatic scaling up of qubit number. We have\nperformed gates in series on 48 individually targeted sites in a 40% full\n$5\\times 5\\times 5$ 3D array created by an optical lattice. Using randomized\nbenchmarking, we demonstrate an average gate fidelity of 0.9962(16), with an\naverage crosstalk fidelity of 0.9979(2).\n", "  We report on the new optical gating technique used for the direct\nphotoconductive detection of short pulses of terahertz radiation with the\nresolution up to 250 femtoseconds. The femtosecond optical laser pulse time\ndelayed with respect to the THz pulse generated a large concentration of the\nelectron hole pairs in the AlGaAs/InGaAs High Electron Mobility Transistor\n(HEMT) drastically increasing the conductivity on the femtosecond scale and\neffectively shorting the source and drain. This optical gating quenched the\nresponse of the plasma waves launched by the THz pulse and allowed us to\nreproduce the waveform of the THz pulse by varying the time delay between the\nTHz and quenching optical pulses. The results are in excellent agreement with\nthe electro-optic effect measurements and with our hydrodynamic model that\npredicts the ultra-fast transistor plasmonic response at the time scale much\nshorter than the electron transit time, in full agreement with the measured\ndata.\n", "  A plethora of natural, artificial and social systems exist which do not\nbelong to the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical-mechanical world, based on the\nstandard additive entropy $S_{BG}$ and its associated exponential BG factor.\nFrequent behaviors in such complex systems have been shown to be closely\nrelated to $q$-statistics instead, based on the nonadditive entropy $S_q$ (with\n$S_1=S_{BG}$), and its associated $q$-exponential factor which generalizes the\nusual BG one. In fact, a wide range of phenomena of quite different nature\nexist which can be described and, in the simplest cases, understood through\nanalytic (and explicit) functions and probability distributions which exhibit\nsome universal features. Universality classes are concomitantly observed which\ncan be characterized through indices such as $q$. We will exhibit here some\nsuch cases, namely concerning the distribution of inter-occurrence (or\ninter-event) times in the areas of finance, earthquakes and genomes.\n", "  We review and extend high energy string BCJ relations in both the fixed angle\nand Regge regimes. We then give an explicit proof of four point string BCJ\nrelations for all energy. This calculation provides an alternative proof of the\none based on monodromy of integration in string amplitude calculation. In\naddition, we calculate both s-t and t-u channel nonrelativistic low energy\nstring scattering amplitudes of three tachyons and one leading trojectory\nstring state at arbitrary mass levels. We discover that the mass and spin\ndependent nonrelativistic string BCJ relations can be expressed in terms of\nGauss hypergeometry functions. As an application, for each fixed mass level N,\nwe derive extended recurrence relations among nonrelativistic low energy string\nscattering amplitudes of string states with different spins and different\nchannels.\n", "  We have investigated the low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the\ndipolar kagome Ising antiferromagnet using at-equilibrium Monte Carlo\nsimulations, in the quest for the ground-state manifold. In spite of the\nlimitations of a single spin-flip approach, we managed to identify certain\nordering patterns in the low-temperature regime and we propose a candidate for\nthis unknown state. This novel configuration presents some intriguing features\nand passes several test-criteria, making it a very likely choice for the\ndipolar long-range order of this kagome Ising antiferromagnet.\n", "  We present results for the spectrum of a strongly interacting SU(3) gauge\ntheory with $N_f = 8$ light fermions in the fundamental representation.\nCarrying out non-perturbative lattice calculations at the lightest masses and\nlargest volumes considered to date, we confirm the existence of a remarkably\nlight singlet scalar particle. We explore the rich resonance spectrum of the\n8-flavor theory in the context of the search for new physics beyond the\nstandard model at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Connecting our results to\nmodels of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, we estimate the vector\nresonance mass to be about 2 TeV with a width of roughly 450 GeV, and predict\nadditional resonances with masses below ~3 TeV.\n", "  The low energy spin excitation spectrum of the breathing pyrochlore\nBa3Yb2Zn5O11 has been investigated with inelastic neutron scattering. Several\nnearly resolution limited modes with no observable dispersion are observed at\n250 mK while, at elevated temperatures, transitions between excited levels\nbecome visible. To gain deeper insight, a theoretical model of isolated Yb3+\ntetrahedra parametrized by four anisotropic exchange constants is constructed.\nThe model reproduces the inelastic neutron scattering data, specific heat, and\nmagnetic susceptibility with high fidelity. The fitted exchange parameters\nreveal a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a very large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction. Using this model, we predict the appearance of an unusual\noctupolar paramagnet at low temperatures and speculate on the development of\ninter-tetrahedron correlations.\n", "  We exploit the AdS/CFT correspondence to investigate thermalization in an N=2\nstrongly coupled gauge theory including massless fundamental matter (quark).\nMore precisely, we consider the response of a zero temperature state of the\ngauge theory under variation of an external electric field leading to a\ntime-dependent current. The holographic dual of the above set-up is given by\nintroducing a time-dependent electric field on the probe D7-brane embedded in\nan AdS_5 X S^5 background. In the dual gravity theory, due to a time-dependent\nelectric field an apparent horizon forms on the brane which, according to\nAdS/CFT dictionary, is the counterpart of the thermalization process in the\ngauge theory. We classify different functions for time-dependent electric field\nand study their effect on the apparent horizon formation. In the case of pulse\nfunctions where the electric field varies from zero to zero, apart from\nnon-equilibrium phase, we observe that two apparent horizons form on the brane.\nOn the gauge theory side, it means that the state of the gauge theory\nexperiences two different temperatures during the time evolution.\n", "  The effects of large scale mechanical forcing on the dynamics of rotating\nturbulent flows are studied by means of numerical simulations, varying\nsystematically the nature of the mechanical force in time. We demonstrate that\nthe statistically stationary solutions of these flows depend on the nature of\nthe forcing mechanism. Rapidly enough rotating flows with a forcing that has a\npersistent direction relatively to the axis of rotation bifurcate from a\nnon-helical state to a helical state despite the fact that the forcing is\nnon-helical. We find that the nature of the mechanical force in time and the\nemergence of helicity have direct implications on the cascade dynamics of these\nflows, determining the anisotropy in the flow, the energy condensation at large\nscales and the power-law energy spectra that are consistent with previous\nfindings and phenomenologies under strong and weak-wave turbulent conditions.\n", "  In the Philosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote, \" 'I' is not\nthe name of a person, nor 'here' of a place, .... But they are connected with\nnames. ... [And] it is characteristic of physics not to use these words.\" This\nstatement expresses the dominant way of thinking in physics: Physics is about\nthe impersonal laws of nature; the \"I\" never makes an appearance in it. Since\nthe advent of quantum theory, however, there has always been a nagging pressure\nto insert a first-person perspective into the heart of physics. In incarnations\nof lesser or greater strength, one may consider the \"Copenhagen\" views of Bohr,\nHeisenberg, and Pauli, the observer-participator view of John Wheeler, the\ninformational interpretation of Anton Zeilinger and Caslav Brukner, the\nrelational interpretation of Carlo Rovelli, and, most radically, the QBism of\nN. David Mermin, Ruediger Schack, and the present author, as acceding to the\npressure. These views have lately been termed \"participatory realism\" to\nemphasize that rather than relinquishing the idea of reality (as they are often\naccused of), they are saying that reality is more than any third-person\nperspective can capture. Thus, far from instances of instrumentalism or\nantirealism, these views of quantum theory should be regarded as attempts to\nmake a deep statement about the nature of reality. This paper explicates the\nidea for the case of QBism. As well, it highlights the influence of John\nWheeler's \"law without law\" on QBism's formulation.\n", "  We explore the origin of flux ratio anomaly in quadruple lens systems. Using\na semi-analytic method based on $N$-body simulations, we estimate the effect of\npossible magnification perturbation caused by subhaloes with a mass scale of\n<$\\sim 10^9\\,h^{-1} \\textrm{M}_\\odot$ in lensing galaxy haloes. Taking into\naccount astrometric shifts, assuming that the primary lens is described by a\nsingular isothermal ellipsoid, the expected change to the flux ratios per a\nmultiply lensed image is just a few percent and the mean of the expected\nconvergence perturbation at the effective Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy\nhalo is $ 0.003$, corresponding to the mean of the ratio of a projected dark\nmatter mass fraction in subhaloes at the effective Einstein radius $0.006$. In\ncontrast, the expected change to the flux ratio caused by line-of-sight\nstructures is typically $\\sim 10$ percent and the mean of the convergence\nperturbation is $0.008$, corresponding to $0.017$. The contribution of\nmagnification perturbation caused by subhaloes is $\\sim 40$ percent of the\ntotal at a source redshift $z_S= 0.7$ and decreases monotonically in $z_S$ to\n$\\sim 20$ percent at $z_S= 3.6$. Assuming statistical isotropy, the convergence\nperturbation estimated from observed 11 quadruple lens systems has a positive\ncorrelation with the source redshift $z_S$, which is much stronger than that\nwith the lens redshift $z_L$. This feature also supports an idea that the flux\nratio anomaly is caused mainly by line-of-sight structures rather than\nsubhaloes. We also discuss about a possible imprint of line-of-sight structures\nin demagnification of minimum images due to locally underdense structures in\nthe line of sight.\n", "  Collapse in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates may be arrested by quantum\nfluctuations. Due to the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions, the\ndipole-driven collapse induced by soft excitations is compensated by the\nrepulsive Lee-Huang-Yang contribution resulting from quantum fluctuations of\nhard excitations, in a similar mechanism as that recently proposed for\nBose-Bose mixtures. The arrested collapse results in self-bound filament-like\ndroplets, providing an explanation to recent dysprosium experiments. Arrested\ninstability and droplet formation are novel general features directly linked to\nthe nature of the dipole-dipole interactions, and should hence play an\nimportant role in all future experiments with strongly dipolar gases.\n", "  Effects of explicit temperature dependence in the exchange-correlation (XC)\nfree-energy functional upon calculated properties of matter in the warm dense\nregime are investigated. The comparison is between the KSDT finite-temperature\nlocal density approximation (TLDA) XC functional [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\\n\\textbf{112}, 076403 (2014)] parametrized from restricted path integral Monte\nCarlo data on the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) and the conventional Monte\nCarlo parametrization ground-state LDA XC functional (Perdew-Zunger, \"PZ\")\nevaluated with $T$-dependent densities. Both Kohn-Sham (KS) and orbital-free\ndensity functional theory (OFDFT) are used, depending upon computational\nresource demands. Compared to the PZ functional, the KSDT functional generally\nlowers the direct-current (DC) electrical conductivity of low density Al,\nyielding improved agreement with experiment. The greatest lowering is about\n15\\% for T= 15 kK. Correspondingly, the KS band structure of low-density fcc Al\nfrom KSDT exhibits a clear increase in inter-band separation above the Fermi\nlevel compared to the PZ bands. In some density-temperature regimes, the\nDeuterium equations of state obtained from the two XC functionals exhibit\npressure differences as large as 4\\% and a 6\\% range of differences. However,\nthe Hydrogen principal Hugoniot is insensitive to explicit XC $T$-dependence\nbecause of cancellation between the energy and pressure-volume work difference\nterms in the Rankine-Hugoniot equation. Finally, the temperature at which the\nHEG becomes unstable is $T\\geq$ 7200 K for $T$-dependent XC, a result that the\nground-state XC underestimates by about 1000 K.\n", "  Current discussions of the allowed two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) parameter\nspace after LHC Run 1 and the prospects for Run 2 are commonly phrased in the\ncontext of a quasi-degenerate spectrum for the new scalars. Here we discuss the\ngeneric situation of a 2HDM with a non-degenerate spectrum for the new scalars.\nThis is highly motivated from a cosmological perspective since it naturally\nleads to a strongly first order electroweak phase transition that could explain\nthe matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. While constraints from\nmeasurements of Higgs signal strengths do not change, those from searches of\nnew scalar states get modified dramatically once a non-degenerate spectrum is\nconsidered.\n", "  The fabrication of nanocrystal (NC) films, starting from colloidal\ndispersion, is a very attractive topic in condensed matter physics community.\nNC films can be employed for transistors, light emitting diodes, laser, and\nsolar cells. For this reason the understanding of the film conductivity is of\nmajor importance. In this paper we describe a probabilistic model that allow to\npredict the conductivity of the NC films, in this case of a cubic lattice of\nLead Selenide NCs. The model is based on the hopping probability between NCs\nshow a comparison with experimental data reported in literature.\n", "  Previous theoretical studies [W. Cho, C. Platt, R. H. McKenzie, and S. Raghu,\nPhys. Rev. B 92, 134514 (2015); N. Lera and J. V. Alvarez, Phys. Rev. B 92,\n174523 (2015)] have suggested that Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$, a quasi-one\ndimensional \"purple bronze\" compound, exhibits spin-triplet superconductivity\nand that the gap function changes sign across the two nearly degenerate Fermi\nsurface sheets. We investigate the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in\ndetermining the symmetry and orientation of the $d$-vector associated with the\nsuperconducting order parameter. We propose that the lack of local inversion\nsymmetry within the four-atom unit cell leads to a staggered spin-orbit\ncoupling analogous to that proposed for graphene, MoS$_2$, or SrPtAs. In\naddition, from a weak-coupling renormalization group treatment of an effective\nmodel Hamiltonian, we find that SOC favors the odd parity $A_{1u}$ state with\n$S_z = \\pm 1$ over the $B$ states with $S_z=0$, where $z$ denotes the\nleast-conducting direction. We discuss possible definitive experimental\nsignatures of this superconducting state.\n", "  A new method for diagnosing the temporal characteristics of ultrashort\nelectron bunches with linear energy chirp generated from a laser wakefield\naccelerator is described. When the ionization-injected bunch interacts with the\nback of the drive laser, it is deflected and stretched along the direction of\nthe electric field of the laser. Upon exiting the plasma, if the bunch goes\nthrough a narrow slit in front of the dipole magnet that disperses the\nelectrons in the plane of the laser polarization, it can form a series of\nbunchlets that have different energies but are separated by half a laser\nwavelength. Since only the electrons that are undeflected by the laser go\nthrough the slit, the energy spectrum of the bunch is modulated. By analyzing\nthe modulated energy spectrum, the shots where the bunch has a linear energy\nchirp can be recognized. Consequently, the energy chirp and beam current\nprofile of those bunches can be reconstructed. This method is demonstrated\nthrough particle-in-cell simulations and experiment.\n", "  We present and analyze a reservoir-engineering approach to stabilizing Fock\nstates in a superconducting microwave cavity which does not require any\nmicrowave-frequency control drives. Instead, our system makes use of a\nJosephson junction biased by a dc voltage which is coupled both to a principle\nstorage cavity and a second auxiliary cavity. Our analysis shows that Fock\nstates can be stabilized with an extremely high fidelity. We also show how the\nsame system can be used to prepare on-demand propagating Fock states, again\nwithout the use of microwave pulses.\n", "  We examine the possibility that the dark matter (DM) interpretation of the\nGeV scale Fermi gamma-ray excess at the Galactic Center can be realized in a\nspecific framework - secluded singlet fermionic dark matter model with small\nmixing between the dark and Standard Model sector. Within this framework it is\nshown that the DM annihilation into bottom-quark pair, Higgs pair, and new\nscalar pair can give good fits to the Fermi gamma-ray data. Moreover\nunavoidable constraints from the antiproton ratio by the PAMELA and AMS-02, the\ngamma-ray emission from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies by the Fermi-LAT, and the\nHiggs measurements by the LHC are also considered. Then we found our best-fit\nparameters for the Fermi gamma-ray excess without conflicting other\nexperimental and cosmological constraints if uncertainties on the DM density\nprofile of the Milky Way Galaxy are taken into account. Successfully surviving\nparameters are benchmark points for future study on the collider signals.\n", "  Recent angle resolved photoemission spectrascope (ARPES) experiments on\nstrongly underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ cuprates have\nreported an unusual gap in the nodal direction. Transport experiments on these\ncuprates found variable range hopping behavior observed. These cuprates have\nboth electron and hole doping which has led to proposals that this cuprate is\nanalogous to a partially compensated semiconductors. The nodal gap then\ncorresponds to the Efros-Schklovskii(ES) gap in such semiconductors. We\ncalculate the doping dependence and temperature dependence of a ES gap model\nand find support for an Efros-Schklovskii model.\n", "  We consider the branch of the projectable Horava-Lifshitz model which\nexhibits ghost instabilities in the low energy limit. It turns out that, due to\nthe Lorentz violating structure of the model and to the presence of a finite\nstrong coupling scale, the vacuum decay rate into photons is tiny in a wide\nrange of phenomenologically acceptable parameters. The strong coupling scale,\nunderstood as a cutoff on ghosts' spatial momenta, can be raised up to $\\Lambda\n\\sim 10$ TeV. At lower momenta, the projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity is\nequivalent to General Relativity supplemented by a fluid with a small positive\nsound speed squared ($10^{-42}\\lesssim$) $c^2_s \\lesssim 10^{-20}$, that could\nbe a promising candidate for the Dark Matter. Despite these advantages, the\nunavoidable presence of the strong coupling obscures the implementation of the\noriginal Horava's proposal on quantum gravity. Apart from the Horava-Lifshitz\nmodel, conclusions of the present work hold also for the mimetic matter\nscenario, where the analogue of the projectability condition is achieved by a\nnon-invertible conformal transformation of the metric.\n", "  We present a fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of\ncharm quark production in charged-current deep-inelastic scattering, with full\ncharm-quark mass dependence. The next-to-next-to-leading order corrections in\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics are found to be comparable in size to the\nnext-to-leading order corrections in certain kinematic regions. We compare our\npredictions with data on dimuon production in (anti-)neutrino scattering from a\nheavy nucleus. Our results can be used to improve the extraction of the parton\ndistribution function of a strange quark in the nucleon.\n", "  Quantum superpositions of distinct coherent states in a single-mode harmonic\noscillator, known as \"cat states\", have been an elegant demonstration of\nSchrodinger's famous cat paradox. Here, we realize a two-mode cat state of\nelectromagnetic fields in two microwave cavities bridged by a superconducting\nartificial atom, which can also be viewed as an entangled pair of single-cavity\ncat states. We present full quantum state tomography of this complex cat state\nover a Hilbert space exceeding 100 dimensions via quantum non-demolition\nmeasurements of the joint photon number parity. The ability to manipulate such\nmulti-cavity quantum states paves the way for logical operations between\nredundantly encoded qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computation and\ncommunication.\n", "  It has recently been shown that optical reflection gratings fabricated\ndirectly into an atom chip provide a simple and effective way to trap and cool\nsubstantial clouds of atoms [1,2]. In this article we describe how the gratings\nare designed and micro-fabricated and we characterise their optical properties,\nwhich determine their effectiveness as a cold atom source. We use simple scalar\ndiffraction theory to understand how the morphology of the gratings determines\nthe power in the diffracted beams.\n", "  A change in the sign of the frequency of a wave between two inertial\nreference frames corresponds to a reversal of the phase velocity. Yet from the\npoint of view of the relation $E=\\hbar\\omega$, a positive quantum of energy\napparently becomes a negative energy one. This is physically distinct from a\nchange in the sign of the wave-vector, and has been associated with various\neffects such as Cherenkov radiation, quantum friction, and the Hawking effect.\nIn this work we provide a more detailed understanding of these negative\nfrequency modes based on a simple microscopic model of a dielectric medium as a\nlattice of scatterers. We calculate the classical and quantum mechanical\nradiation damping of an oscillator moving through such a lattice and find that\nthe modes where the frequency has changed sign contribute negatively. In terms\nof the lattice of scatterers we find that this negative radiation damping\narises due to phase of the periodic force experienced by the oscillator due to\nthe relative motion of the lattice.\n", "  We examine the fluctuation theorems which traditionally have been studied for\nclassical systems and enquire if they can be extended to the quantum domain,\nespecially at low temperatures. The example chosen is that of a problem which\nhas proven to be of great interest in the context of Landau diamagnetism viz.\nthe quantized motion of an electron in a magnetic field and in a dissipative\nenvironment. It is established from first principles that the quantum work\noperator W has a Gaussian distribution even though the system under\nconsideration has a four dimensional phase space. The parameter $\\alpha$ in the\nfluctuation theorem $p(W )/p(-W) = exp(\\alpha W)$ depends on the system\ndynamics and has characteristic quantum features, especially at low\ntemperatures. Certain unique low temperature signatures are also discussed.\n", "  We explore some possibilities for obtaining useful metrics and dilatons for\nAdS/QCD models. As a guideline, we consider dilatons and/or metrics that on the\none hand reproduce the mesonic spectrum, and that on the other hand allow us a\ncorrect implementation of chiral symmetry breaking in AdS/QCD models. We\ndiscuss two procedures: one is based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics\ntechniques and the other considers the interpolation between some limits on\ndilatons and/or metrics.\n", "  The boundary contribution of an amplitude in the BCFW recursion relation can\nbe considered as a form factor involving boundary operator and unshifted\nparticles. At the tree-level, we show that by suitable construction of\nLagrangian, one can relate the leading order term of boundary operators to some\ncomposite operators of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, then the computation of\nform factors is translated to the computation of amplitudes. We compute the\nform factors of these composite operators through the computation of\ncorresponding double trace amplitudes.\n", "  The linear stability of Alfv\\'en eigenmodes in the presence of fusion-born\nalpha particles is thoroughly assessed for two variants of an ITER baseline\nscenario, which differ significantly in their core and pedestal temperatures. A\nsystematic approach is used that considers all possible eigenmodes for a given\nmagnetic equilibrium and determines their growth rates due to alpha-particle\ndrive and Landau damping on fuel ions, helium ashes and electrons. This\nextensive stability study is efficiently conducted through the use of a\nspecialized workflow that profits from the performance of the hybrid MHD\ndrift-kinetic code $\\mbox{CASTOR-K}$ (Borba D. and Kerner W. 1999 J. Comput.\nPhys. ${\\bf 153}$ 101; Nabais F. ${\\it et\\,al}$ 2015 Plasma Sci. Technol. ${\\bf\n17}$ 89), which can rapidly evaluate the linear growth rate of an eigenmode. It\nis found that the fastest growing instabilities in the aforementioned ITER\nscenario are core-localized, low-shear toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes. The\nlargest growth-rates occur in the scenario variant with higher core\ntemperatures, which has the highest alpha-particle density and density\ngradient, for eigenmodes with toroidal mode numbers $n\\approx30$. Although\nthese eigenmodes suffer significant radiative damping, which is also evaluated,\ntheir growth rates remain larger than those of the most unstable eigenmodes\nfound in the variant of the ITER baseline scenario with lower core\ntemperatures, which have $n\\approx15$ and are not affected by radiative\ndamping.\n", "  We develop a method to efficiently calculate trial wave functions for quantum\nHall systems which involve projection onto the lowest Landau level. The method\nessentially replaces lowest Landau level projection by projection onto the $M$\nlowest eigenstates of a suitably chosen hamiltonian acting within the lowest\nLandau level. The resulting \"energy projection\" is a controlled approximation\nto the exact lowest Landau level projection which improves with increasing $M$.\nIt allows us to study projected trial wave functions for system sizes close to\nthe maximal sizes that can be reached by exact diagonalization and can be\nstraightforwardly applied in any geometry. As a first application and test\ncase, we study a class of trial wave functions first proposed by Girvin and\nJach, which are modifications of the Laughlin states involving a single real\nparameter. While these modified Laughlin states probably represent the same\nuniversality class exemplified by the Laughlin wave functions, we show by\nextensive numerical work for systems on the sphere and torus that they provide\na significant improvement of the variational energy, overlap with the exact\nwave function and properties of the entanglement spectrum.\n", "  The main motivation to study models in the presence of a minimal length is to\nobtain a quantum field theory free of the divergences. In this way, in this\npaper, we have constructed a new framework for quantum electrodynamics embedded\nin a minimal length scale background. New operators are introduced and the\nGreen function method was used for the solution of the field equations, i.e.,\nthe Maxwell, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. We have analyzed specifically\nthe scalar field and its one loop propagator. The mass of the scalar field\nregularized by the minimal length was obtained. The QED Lagrangian containing a\nminimal length was also constructed and the divergences were analyzed. The\nelectron and photon propagators, and the electron self-energy at one loop as a\nfunction of the minimal length was also obtained.\n", "  Optical modulators can be made nowadays with high modulation speed, broad\nbandwidth, while being compact, owing to the recent advance in material science\nand microfabrication technology. However, these optical modulators usually work\nfor low intensity light beams. Here, we present an ultrafast, plasma-based\noptical modulator, which can directly modulate high power lasers with intensity\nup to 10^16 W/cm^2 level to produce an extremely broad spectrum with a\nfractional bandwidth over 100%, extending to the mid-infrared regime in the\nlow-frequency side. This concept relies on two co-propagating laser beams in a\nsub-mm-scale underdense plasma, where a drive laser pulse first excites an\nelectron plasma wave in its wake while a following carrier laser beam is\nmodulated by the plasma wave. The laser and plasma parameters suitable for the\nmodulator to work are presented. Such optical modulators may enable new\napplications in the high field physics.\n", "  The Periodic Anderson Model (PAM) is widely studied to understand strong\ncorrelation physics and especially the competition of antiferromagnetism and\nsinglet formation. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) studies have focused both on\nissues such as the nature of screening and locating the quantum critical point\n(QCP) at zero temperature and also on possible experimental connections to\nphenomena ranging from the Cerium volume collapse to the relation of the\nmagnetic susceptibility and Knight shift in heavy fermions. In this paper we\nextend QMC work to lattices in which the conduction electron sites can have\nvariable coordination. This situation is relevant both to recently discovered\nmagnetic quasicrystals and also to magnetism in doped heavy fermion systems.\n", "  We explore the possibility to explain the 750 GeV diphoton excess recently\nmeasured by ATLAS and CMS collaborations in terms of a massive spin-2 particle.\nIn particular, we consider the case in which the top-quark loops can give the\nsimilar amplitudes as the tree-level contributions to the diphoton and digluon\nchannels. Such a scenario can be naturally realized in the generalized warped\nextra dimension models. As a result, the parameter space favored by the\ndiphoton data implies that the top-quark loop contribution can compete to and\neven dominate over the tree-level amplitude in the spin-2 particle production\nvia the gluon-gluon fusion process. Similar results are obtained for the case\nin which the spin-2 particle induces large invisible decay branching ratios, as\nindicated by the ATLAS data.\n", "  Using M-theory compactification, we develop a three factor separation for the\nscalar submanifold of N=2 seven dimensional supergravity associated with\n2-cycles of the K3 surface. Concretely, we give an interplay between the three\nscalar submanifold factors and the extremal black holes obtained from M2-branes\nwrapping such 2-cycles. Then, we show that the corresponding black hole charges\nare linked to one, two and four qubit systems.\n", "  The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is an important observable that\ntests radiative corrections of all three observed local gauge forces:\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. High precision measurements\nreveal some discrepancy with the most accurate theoretical evaluations of the\nanomalous magnetic moment. We show in this note that the UV finite theory\ncannot resolve this discrepancy. We believe that more reliable estimate of the\nnonperturbative hadronic contribution and the new measurements can resolve the\nproblem.\n", "  Research-based assessments represent a valuable tool for both instructors and\nresearchers interested in improving undergraduate physics education. However,\nthe historical model for disseminating and propagating conceptual and\nattitudinal assessments developed by the physics education research (PER)\ncommunity has not resulted in widespread adoption of these assessments within\nthe broader community of physics instructors. Within this historical model,\nassessment developers create high quality, validated assessments, make them\navailable for a wide range of instructors to use, and provide minimal (if any)\nsupport to assist with administration or analysis of the results. Here, we\npresent and discuss an alternative model for assessment dissemination, which is\ncharacterized by centralized data collection and analysis. This model provides\na greater degree of support for both researchers and instructors in order to\nmore explicitly support adoption of research-based assessments. Specifically,\nwe describe our experiences developing a centralized, automated system for an\nattitudinal assessment we previously created to examine students'\nepistemologies and expectations about experimental physics. This system\nprovides a proof-of-concept that we use to discuss the advantages associated\nwith centralized administration and data collection for research-based\nassessments in PER. We also discuss the challenges that we encountered while\ndeveloping, maintaining, and automating this system. Ultimately, we argue that\ncentralized administration and data collection for standardized assessments is\na viable and potentially advantageous alternative to the default model\ncharacterized by decentralized administration and analysis. Moreover, with the\nhelp of online administration and automation, this model can support the\nlong-term sustainability of centralized assessment systems.\n", "  In Monte-Carlo methods the Markov processes used to sample a given target\ndistribution usually satisfy detailed balance, i.e. they are time-reversible.\nHowever, relatively recent results have demonstrated that appropriate\nreversible and irreversible perturbations can accelerate convergence to\nequilibrium. In this paper we present some general design principles which\napply to general Markov processes. Working with the generator of Markov\nprocesses, we prove that for some of the most commonly used performance\ncriteria, i.e., spectral gap, asymptotic variance and large deviation\nfunctionals, sampling is improved for appropriate reversible and irreversible\nperturbations of some initially given reversible sampler. Moreover we provide\nspecific constructions for such reversible and irreversible perturbations for\nvarious commonly used Markov processes, such as Markov chains and diffusions.\nIn the case of diffusions, we make the discussion more specific using the large\ndeviations rate function as a measure of performance.\n", "  In this work, we provide a fully-implicit implementation of the\ntime-dependent, filtered spherical harmonics (FPN) equations for non-linear,\nthermal radiative transfer. We investigate local filtering strategies and\nanalyze the effect of the filter on the conditioning of the system, showing in\nparticular that the filter improves the convergence properties of the iterative\nsolver. We also investigate numerically the rigorous error estimates derived in\nthe linear setting, to determine whether they hold also for the non-linear\ncase. Finally, we simulate a standard test problem on an unstructured mesh and\nmake comparisons with implicit Monte-Carlo (IMC) calculations.\n", "  It is a well established result of linear theory that the influence of\ndiffering mechanical boundary conditions, i.e., stress-free or no-slip, on the\nprimary instability in rotating convection becomes asymptotically small in the\nlimit of rapid rotation. This is accounted for by the diminishing impact of the\nviscous stresses exerted within Ekman boundary layers and the associated\nvertical momentum transport by Ekman pumping. By contrast, in the nonlinear\nregime recent experiments and supporting simulations are now providing evidence\nthat the efficiency of heat transport remains strongly influenced by Ekman\npumping in the rapidly rotating limit. In this paper, a reduced model is\ndeveloped for the case of low Rossby number convection in a plane layer\ngeometry with no-slip upper and lower boundaries held at fixed temperatures. A\ncomplete description of the dynamics requires the existence of three distinct\nregions within the fluid layer: a geostrophically balanced interior where fluid\nmotions are predominately aligned with the axis of rotation, Ekman boundary\nlayers immediately adjacent to the bounding plates, and thermal wind layers\ndriven by Ekman pumping in between. The reduced model uses a classical Ekman\npumping parameterization to alleviate the need for spatially resolving the\nEkman boundary layers. Results are presented for both linear stability theory\nand a special class of nonlinear solutions described by a single horizontal\nspatial wavenumber. It is shown that Ekman pumping allows for significant\nenhancement in the heat transport relative to that observed in simulations with\nstress-free boundaries. Without the intermediate thermal wind layer the\nnonlinear feedback from Ekman pumping would be able to generate a heat\ntransport that diverges to infinity. This layer arrests this blowup resulting\nin finite heat transport at a significantly enhanced value.\n", "  The Casimir effect is a physical manifestation of zero point energy of\nquantum vacuum. In a relativistic quantum field theory, Poincar\\'e symmetry of\nthe theory seems, at first sight, to imply that non-zero vacuum energy is\ninconsistent with translational invariance of the vacuum. In the setting of two\nuniform boundary plates at rest, quantum fields outside the plates have\n(1+2)-dimensional Poincar\\'e symmtry. Taking a massless scalar field as an\nexample, we have examined the consistency between the Poincar\\'e symmetry and\nthe existence of the vacuum enegy. We note that, in quantum theory, symmetries\nare represented projectively in general and show that the Casimir energy is\nconnected to central charges appearing in the algebra of generators in the\nprojective representations.\n", "  In this exploratory lattice study, low-energy near threshold scattering of\nthe $(\\bar{D}_1 D^{*})^\\pm$ meson system is analyzed using lattice QCD with\n$N_f=2$ twisted mass fermion configurations. Both s-wave ($J^P=0^-$) and p-wave\n($J^P=1^+$) channels are investigated. It is found that the interaction between\nthe two charmed mesons is attractive near the threshold in both channels. This\ncalculation provides some hints in the searching of resonances or bound states\naround the threshold of $(\\bar{D}_1 D^{*})^\\pm$ system.\n", "  It is known that in contrast with the E-mode polarization, the B-mode\npolarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background cannot be generated by the\nCompton scattering in the case of scalar mode of metric perturbation. However\nit is possible to generate the B-mode by the Compton scattering in the case of\ntensor mode of metric perturbation. For this reason, the ratio of tensor to\nscalar modes of metric perturbation ($r\\sim C_{Bl}/C_{El}$) is estimated by\ncomparing the B-mode power spectrum with the E-mode at least for small $l$. We\nstudy the CMB polarization specially B-mode due to the weak interaction of\nCosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) and CMB, in addition to the Compton scattering\nin both cases of scalar and tensor metric perturbations. It is shown that the\npower spectrum $C_{Bl}$ of the B-mode polarization receives some contributions\nfrom scalar and tensor modes, which have effects on the value of $r$-parameter.\nWe also show that the B-mode polarization power spectrum can be used as an\nindirect probe into the CNB.\n", "  Fluid-dynamical equations of motion can be derived from the Boltzmann\nequation in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution\nfunction which is in local thermodynamical equilibrium, i.e., isotropic in\nmomentum space in the rest frame of a fluid element. However, in situations\nwhere the single-particle distribution function is highly anisotropic in\nmomentum space, such as the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions at\nrelativistic energies, such an expansion is bound to break down. Nevertheless,\none can still derive a fluid-dynamical theory, called anisotropic dissipative\nfluid dynamics, in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution\nfunction, $\\hat{f}_{0\\bf k}$, which incorporates (at least parts of) the\nmomentum anisotropy via a suitable parametrization. We construct such an\nexpansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of\nthe anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum\nsubspace orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the\nanisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of\nmotion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle\ndistribution function from $\\hat{f}_{0\\bf k}$. Truncating this set via the\n14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic\ndissipative fluid dynamics.\n", "  Extensive experimental studies show all major rocky elements (Si, Mg, Fe, Ni,\nCa, Al, Na, K) dissolve in steam to a greater or lesser extent. We use these\nresults to compute chemical equilibrium abundances of rocky element-bearing\ngases in steam atmospheres equilibrated with silicate magma oceans. Rocky\nelements partition into steam atmospheres as volatile hydroxide gases and via\nreaction with HF or HCl as volatile halide gases in much larger amounts than\nexpected from their vapor pressures over volatile-free solid or molten rock at\nthe same temperature. We compute the extent of fractional vaporization by\ndefining gas to magma partition coefficients and show Earth's sub-solar Si to\nMg bulk elemental ratio may be due to loss of a primordial steam atmosphere. We\nconclude hot rocky exoplanets that are undergoing or have undergone escape of\nsteam atmospheres may experience fractional vaporization and loss of Si, Mg,\nFe, Ni, Ca, Al, Na, and K. This loss may modify their bulk composition,\ndensity, heat balance, and internal structure.\n", "  We present a further extension of the HYPERDIRE project, which is devoted to\nthe creation of a set of Mathematica-based program packages for manipulations\nwith Horn-type hypergeometric functions on the basis of differential equations.\nSpecifically, we present the implementation of the differential reduction for\nthe Lauricella function $F_C$ of three variables.\n", "  We find a simple relation between a free higher spin field partition function\non thermal quotient of AdS(d+1) and the partition function of the associated\nd-dimensional conformal higher spin field on thermal quotient of AdS(d).\nStarting with a conformal higher spin field defined on AdS(d) one may also\nassociate to it another conformal field in d-1 dimensions, thus \"iterating\"\nAdS/CFT. We observe that in the case of d=4 this iteration leads to a \"trivial\"\n3d higher spin conformal theory with parity-even non-local action: it describes\nzero total number of dynamical degrees of freedom and the corresponding\npartition function on thermal AdS(3) is equal to 1.\n", "  The Supersymmetric Custodial Triplet Model, a supersymmetric generalization\nof the Georgi-Machacek model, has proven to be an interesting modification of\nthe MSSM. It extends the MSSM Higgs sector by three extra SU(2)L triplets in\nsuch a way that approximate custodial invariance is preserved and rho-parameter\ndeviations are kept under control. By means of a sizeable triplet contribution\nto electroweak breaking the model is able to generate a barrier at tree level\nbetween the false vacuum and the electroweak one. This will result in a strong\nfirst order phase transition for an important region of the parameter space. We\nalso look at the gravitational waves that could be generated as a result of the\nphase transition and show how future interferometers could be used as a probe\nof the model.\n", "  Tilt-horizontal coupling in inertial sensors limits the performance of active\nisolation systems such as those used in gravitational wave detectors. Inertial\nrotation sensors can be used to subtract the tilt component from the signal\nproduced by horizontal inertial sensors, but such techniques are often limited\nby the sensor noise of the tilt measurement. A different approach is to\nmechanically filter the tilt transmitted to the horizontal inertial sensor, as\ndiscussed in this article. This technique does not require an auxiliary\nrotation sensor, and can produce a lower noise measurement. The concept\ninvestigated uses a mechanical suspension to isolate the inertial sensor from\ninput tilt. Modeling and simulations show that such a configuration can be used\nto adequately attenuate the tilt transmitted to the instrument, while\nmaintaining translation sensitivity in the frequency band of interest. The\nanalysis is supported by experimental results showing that this approach is a\nviable solution to overcome the tilt problem in the field of active inertial\nisolation.\n", "  Based on a sample of $(1310.6 \\pm 10.5) \\times 10^{6}$ $J/\\psi$ events\ncollected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, a\npartial wave analysis of the decay $J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\gamma \\phi \\phi$ is\nperformed in order to study the intermediate states. Results of the partial\nwave analysis show that the structures are predominantly $0^{-+}$ states. The\nexistence of the $\\eta(2225)$ is confirmed, and its resonance parameters are\nmeasured. Two additional pseudoscalar states, the $\\eta(2100)$ with a mass of\n$2050_{-24}^{+30}{}_{-26}^{+75}$~MeV/$c^{2}$ and a width of\n$250_{-30}^{+36}{}_{-164}^{+181}$~MeV/$c^{2}$ and the $X(2500)$ with a mass of\n$2470_{-19}^{+15}{}_{-23}^{+101}$~MeV/$c^{2}$ and a width of\n$230_{-35}^{+64}{}_{-33}^{+56}$~MeV/$c^{2}$, are observed. In addition to these\nthree pseudoscalar states, the scalar state $f_0(2100)$, and three tensor\nstates, the $f_2(2010)$, $f_2(2300)$ and $f_2(2340)$, are observed in the\nprocess $J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\gamma \\phi\\phi$. The product branching fractions\n${\\cal B}$($J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\gamma X)\\times{\\cal B}(X\\rightarrow \\phi \\phi)$\nare reported.\n", "  Using iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model with the AMPT initial conditions, we study the\nhigher order flow harmonics of identified hadrons in 2.76 A TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions. Comparison with the recent ALICE measurements at 20-30\\% centrality\nshows that our calculations nicely describe the data below 2 GeV, especially\nfor the $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ mass-orderings among pions, kaons and protons.\nWe also extended the calculations to other centrality bins, which presents\nsimilar mass-ordering patterns for these flow harmonics as the ones observed at\n20-30\\% centrality. In the later part of this article, we explore the\ndevelopment of $v_n$ mass ordering/splitting during the hadronic evolution\nthrough the comparison runs from iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model and pure\nhydrodynamics with different decoupling temperatures.\n", "  Artificially engineered light-matter systems constitute a novel, versatile\narchitecture for the quantum simulation of driven, dissipative phase\ntransitions and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. Here, we review\nrecent experimental as well as theoretical works on the simulation of\ngeometrical frustration in interacting photonic systems out of equilibrium. In\nparticular, we discuss two recent discoveries at the interface of quantum\noptics and condensed matter physics: (i) the experimental achievement of\nbosonic condensation into a flat energy band and (ii) the theoretical\nprediction of crystalline phases of light in a frustrated qubit-cavity array.\nWe show that this new line of research leads to novel and unique tools for the\nexperimental investigation of frustrated systems and holds the potential to\ncreate new phases of light and matter with interesting spatial structure.\n", "  The electroweak unification group $ SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times SU(2)_Y $ is\nproposed for the charged lepton flavor violating decays of the muon ($\\mu$) and\ntau ($\\tau$) leptons. The group $SU(2)_Y$ is in the lepton space. The\nleft-handed leptons and anti-leptons are assigned to the fundamental\nrepresentation $(2,2,\\bar{2})$ of the semi-simple group. The gauge group\n$SU(2)_Y$ is spontaneously broken to $U(1)_{Y_1}$, where $Y_1=-L=\\pm1$ is the\nhypercharge, by introducing a scalar multiplet $\\Sigma$ which belongs to the\ntriplet representation 3 of the $SU(2)_Y$ and is singlet under $SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R$. At this stage charged vector bosons $Y^\\pm$ of $SU(2)_Y$ which\nmediate the lepton flavor violating decays acquire masses and are decoupled\nwith one Higgs scalar $H_\\Sigma^0$. The residual group $SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y_1}$ has all the features of the left-right electroweak\nunification group extensively studied in the literature. The probability for\nlepton flavor violating decays is\n$\\left(\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta_W}{1-2\\sin^2\\theta_W}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{m_{W_L}}{m_Y}\\right)^4$.\n", "  We propose a class of multidimensional higher derivative theories of gravity\nwithout extra real degrees of freedom besides the graviton field. The\npropagator shows up the usual real graviton pole and extra complex conjugates\npoles that do not contribute to the absorptive part of the physical scattering\namplitudes. Indeed, they may consistently be excluded from the asymptotic\nobservable states of the theory making use of the Lee-Wick and Cutkoski,\nLandshoff, Olive and Polkinghorne prescription for the construction of a\nunitary S-matrix. Therefore, the spectrum consists on the graviton and short\nlived elementary unstable particles that we named \"anti-gravitons\" because of\ntheir repulsive contribution to the gravitational potential at short distance.\nHowever, another interpretation of the complex conjugate pairs is proposed\nbased on the Calmet's suggestion, i.e. they could be understood as black hole\nprecursors long established in the classical theory. Since the theory is CPT\ninvariant, the complex conjugate of the micro black hole precursor has received\nas a white hole precursor consistently with the t'Hooft complementary\nprinciple. It is proved that the quantum theory is super-renormalizable in even\ndimension, i.e. only a finite number of divergent diagrams survive, and finite\nin odd dimension. Furthermore, turning on a local potential of the Riemann\ntensor we can make the theory finite in any dimension. The singularity-free\nNewtonian gravitational potential is explicitly computed for a range of higher\nderivative theories. Finally, we propose a new super-reneromalizable or finite\nLee-Wick standard model of particle physics.\n", "  Topological insulators interacting with magnetic impurities have been\nreported to host several unconventional effects. These phenomena are described\nwithin the framework of gapping Dirac quasiparticles due to broken\ntime-reversal symmetry. However, the overwhelming majority of studies\ndemonstrate the presence of a finite density of states near the Dirac point\neven once Topological insulators become magnetic. Here, we map the response of\ntopological states to magnetic impurities at the atomic scale. We demonstrate\nthat magnetic order and gapless states can coexist. We show how this is the\nresult of the delicate balance between two opposite trends, i.e. gap opening\nand emergence of a Dirac node impurity band, both induced by the magnetic\ndopants. Our results evidence a more intricate and rich scenario with respect\nto the once generally assumed, showing how different electronic and magnetic\nstates may be generated and controlled in this fascinating class of materials.\n", "  The dynamical formation of stellar-mass black hole-black hole binaries has\nlong been a promising source of gravitational waves for the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Mass segregation,\ngravitational focusing, and multibody dynamical interactions naturally increase\nthe interaction rate between the most massive black holes in dense stellar\nsystems, eventually leading them to merge. We find that dynamical interactions,\nparticularly three-body binary formation, enhance the merger rate of black hole\nbinaries with total mass M_tot roughly as ~M_tot^beta, with beta >~ 4. We find\nthat this relation holds mostly independently of the initial mass function, but\nthe exact value depends on the degree of mass segregation. The detection rate\nof such massive black hole binaries is only further enhanced by LIGO's greater\nsensitivity to massive black hole binaries with M_tot <~ 80 solar masses. We\nfind that for power-law BH mass functions dN/dM ~ M^-alpha with alpha <~ 2,\nLIGO is most likely to detect black hole binaries with a mass twice that of the\nmaximum initial black hole mass and a mass ratio near one. Repeated mergers of\nblack holes inside the cluster result in about ~5% of mergers being observed\nbetween two and three times the maximum initial black hole mass. Using these\nrelations, one may be able to invert the observed distribution to the initial\nmass function with multiple detections of merging black hole binaries.\n", "  We study the inverse problem of constructing an appropriate Hamiltonian from\na physically reasonable set of orthogonal wave functions for a quantum spin\nsystem. Usually, we are given a local Hamiltonian and try to characterize the\nrelevant wave functions and energies (the spectrum) of the system. Here, we\ntake the opposite approach; starting from a collection of orthogonal wave\nfunctions, our goal is to characterize the associated parent Hamiltonian, to\nsee how the wave functions and the energy values determine the structure of the\nparent Hamiltonian. Specifically, we obtain (quasi) local Hamiltonians by a\ncomplete set of (multilayer) product states and a local mapping of the energy\nvalues to the wave functions. On the other hand, a complete set of tree wave\nfunctions (having a tree structure) results to nonlocal Hamiltonians and\noperators which flip simultaneously all the spins in a single branch of the\ntree graph. We observe that even for a given set of wave functions, the energy\nspectrum can significantly change the nature of interactions in the\nHamiltonian. These effects can be exploited in a quantum engineering problem\noptimizing an objective functional of the Hamiltonian.\n", "  2nd-order conformal superintegrable systems in $n$ dimensions are Laplace\nequations on a manifold with an added scalar potential and $2n - 1$ independent\n2nd order conformal symmetry operators. They encode all the information about\nHelmholtz (eigenvalue) superintegrable systems in an efficient manner: there is\na 1-1 correspondence between Laplace superintegrable systems and Stackel\nequivalence classes of Helmholtz superintegrable systems. In this paper we\nfocus on superintegrable systems in two dimensions, $n = 2$, where there are 44\nHelmholtz systems, corresponding to 12 Laplace systems. For each Laplace\nequation we determine the possible 2-variate polynomial subspaces that are\ninvariant under the action of the Laplace operator, thus leading to families of\npolynomial eigenfunctions. We also study the behavior of the polynomial\ninvariant subspaces under a Stackel transform. The principal new results are\nthe details of the polynomial variables and the conditions on parameters of the\npotential corresponding to polynomial solutions. The hidden gl_3-algebraic\nstructure is exhibited for the exact and quasi-exact systems. For physically\nmeaningful solutions, the orthogonality properties and normalizability of the\npolynomials are presented as well. Finally, for all Helmholtz superintegrable\nsolvable systems we give a unified construction of 1D and 2D quasi-exactly\nsolvable potentials possessing polynomial solutions, and a construction of new\n2D PT-symmetric potentials is established.\n", "  We present a new set of leading twist parton distribution functions, referred\nto as \"CJ15\", which take advantage of developments in the theoretical treatment\nof nuclear corrections as well as new data. The analysis includes for the first\ntime data on the free neutron structure function from Jefferson Lab, and new\nhigh-precision charged lepton and W-boson asymmetry data from Fermilab. These\nsignificantly reduce the uncertainty on the d/u ratio at large values of x and\nprovide new insights into the partonic structure of bound nucleons.\n", "  We examine the proposal that the dispersion measures (DMs) and Faraday\nrotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic linearly-polarized fast radio bursts\n(FRBs) can be used to probe the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in\nfilaments of galaxies. The DM through the cosmic web is dominated by\ncontributions from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in filaments and\nfrom the gas in voids. On the other hand, RM is induced mostly by the hot\nmedium in galaxy clusters, and only a fraction of it is produced in the WHIM.\nWe show that if one excludes FRBs whose sightlines pass through galaxy\nclusters, the line-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments, $B_{||}$, is\napproximately $C(\\langle 1+z \\rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$, where $C$ is a known\nconstant. Here, the redshift of the FRB is not required to be known; $f_{DM}$\nis the fraction of total DM due to the WHIM, while $\\langle 1+z \\rangle$ is the\nredshift of interevening gas weighted by the WHIM gas density, both of which\ncan be evaluated for a given cosmology model solely from the DM of an FRB.\nUsing data on structure formation simulations and a model IGMF, we show that\n$C(\\langle 1+z \\rangle/f_{DM})(RM/DM)$ closely reproduces the density-weighted\nline-of-sight strength of the IGMF in filaments of the large-scale structure.\n", "  We discuss the systematic decomposition of all dimension-7 (d=7) lepton\nnumber violating operators. These d=7 operators produce momentum enhanced\ncontributions to the long-range part of the neutrinoless double beta decay\namplitude and thus are severely constrained by existing half-live limits. In\nour list of possible models one can find contributions to the long-range\namplitude discussed previously in the literature, such as the left-right\nsymmetric model or scalar leptoquarks, as well as some new models not\nconsidered before. The d=7 operators generate Majorana neutrino mass terms\neither at tree-level, 1-loop or 2-loop level. We systematically compare\nconstraints derived from the mass mechanism to those derived from the\nlong-range double beta decay amplitude and classify our list of models\naccordingly. We also study one particular example decomposition, which produces\nneutrino masses at 2-loop level, can fit oscillation data and yields a large\ncontribution to the long-range double beta decay amplitude, in some detail.\n", "  Two integrable cases of two-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\nmagnetic field are proposed. Using the polar coordinates and the symmetrical\ngauge, we will obtain solutions of these equation through Biconfluent and\nConfluent Heun functions. The quantization rules will be derived for both\nsystems under consideration.\n", "  Using the Boltzmann formalism based on the first principles electronic\nstructure and scattering rates, we investigate the current-induced spin\naccumulation and spin-orbit torques in FePt/Pt and Co/Cu bilayers in the\npresence of substitutional impurities. In FePt/Pt bilayers we consider the\neffect of intermixing of Fe and Pt atoms in the FePt layer, and find a crucial\ndependence of spin accumulation and spin-orbit torques on the details of the\ndistribution of these defects. In Co/Cu bilayers we predict that the magnitude\nand sign of the spin-orbit torque and spin accumulation depend very sensitively\non the type of the impurities used to dope the Cu substrate. Moreover,\nsimultaneously with impurity-driven scattering we consider the effect of an\nadditional constant quasiparticle broadening of the states at the Fermi surface\nto simulate phonon scattering at room temperature, and discover that even a\nsmall broadening of the order of 25 meV can drastically influence the magnitude\nof the considered effects. We explain our findings based on the analysis of the\ncomplex interplay of several competing Fermi surface contributions to the spin\naccumulation and spin-orbit torques in these structurally and chemically\nnon-uniform systems.\n", "  We present initial results from the \"Ponos\" zoom-in numerical simulations of\ndark matter substructures in massive ellipticals. Two very highly resolved dark\nmatter halos with $M_{\\rm vir}=1.2\\times 10^{13}$ $M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{\\rm\nvir}=6.5\\times 10^{12}$ $M_{\\odot}$ and different (\"violent\" vs. \"quiescent\")\nassembly histories have been simulated down to $z=0$ in a $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology with a total of 921,651,914 and 408,377,544 particles, respectively.\nWithin the virial radius, the total mass fraction in self-bound $M_{\\rm\nsub}>10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$ subhalos at the present epoch is 15% for the violent\nhost and 16.5% for the quiescent one. At $z=0.7$, these fractions increase to\n19 and 33%, respectively, as more recently accreted satellites are less prone\nto tidal destruction. In projection, the average fraction of surface mass\ndensity in substructure at a distance of $R/R_{\\rm vir}=0.02$ ($\\sim 5-10$ kpc)\nfrom the two halo centers ranges from 0.6% to $\\gtrsim 2$%, significantly\nhigher than measured in simulations of Milky Way-sized halos. The contribution\nof subhalos with $M_{\\rm sub} < 10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$ to the projected mass\nfraction is between one fifth and one third of the total, with the smallest\nshare found in the quiescent host. We assess the impact of baryonic effects via\ntwin, lower-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that include\nmetallicity-dependent gas cooling, star formation, and a\ndelayed-radiative-cooling scheme for supernova feedback. Baryonic contraction\nproduces a super-isothermal total density profile and increases the number of\nmassive subhalos in the inner regions of the main host. The host density\nprofiles and projected subhalo mass fractions appear to be broadly consistent\nwith observations of gravitational lenses.\n", "  We report the measurement of muon neutrino charged-current interactions on\ncarbon without pions in the final state at the T2K beam energy using\n5.734$\\times10^{20}$ protons on target. For the first time the measurement is\nreported as a flux-integrated, double-differential cross-section in muon\nkinematic variables ($\\cos\\theta_\\mu$, $p_\\mu$), without correcting for events\nwhere a pion is produced and then absorbed by final state interactions. Two\nanalyses are performed with different selections, background evaluations and\ncross-section extraction methods to demonstrate the robustness of the results\nagainst biases due to model-dependent assumptions. The measurements compare\nfavorably with recent models which include nucleon-nucleon correlations but,\ngiven the present precision, the measurement does not solve the degeneracy\nbetween different models. The data also agree with Monte Carlo simulations\nwhich use effective parameters that are tuned to external data to describe the\nnuclear effects. The total cross-section in the full phase space is $\\sigma =\n(0.417 \\pm 0.047 \\text{(syst)} \\pm 0.005 \\text{(stat)})\\times 10^{-38}\n\\text{cm}^2$ $\\text{nucleon}^{-1}$ and the cross-section integrated in the\nregion of phase space with largest efficiency and best signal-over-background\nratio ($\\cos\\theta_\\mu>0.6$ and $p_\\mu > 200$ MeV) is $\\sigma = (0.202 \\pm\n0.0359 \\text{(syst)} \\pm 0.0026 \\text{(stat)}) \\times 10^{-38} \\text{cm}^2$\n$\\text{nucleon}^{-1}$.\n", "  High $p_T > 10$ GeV elliptic flow, which is experimentally measured via the\ncorrelation between soft and hard hadrons, receives competing contributions\nfrom event-by-event fluctuations of the low $p_T$ elliptic flow and event plane\nangle fluctuations in the soft sector. In this paper, a proper account of these\nevent-by-event fluctuations in the soft sector, modeled via viscous\nhydrodynamics, is combined with a jet energy loss model to reveal that the\npositive contribution from low $p_T$ $v_2$ fluctuations overwhelms the negative\ncontributions from event plane fluctuations. This leads to an enhancement of\nhigh $p_T > 10$ GeV elliptic flow in comparison to previous calculations and\nprovides a natural solution to the decade long high $p_T$ $R_{AA} \\otimes v_2$\npuzzle. We also present the first theoretical calculation of high $p_T$ $v_3$,\nwhich is shown to be compatible with current LHC data. Furthermore, we discuss\nhow short wavelength jet-medium physics can be deconvoluted from the physics of\nsoft, bulk event-by-event flow observables using event shape engineering\ntechniques.\n", "  Although aqueous electrolytes are among the most important solutions, the\nmolecular simulation of their intertwined properties of chemical potentials,\nsolubility and activity coefficients has remained a challenging problem, and\nhas attracted considerable recent interest. In this perspectives review, we\nfocus on the simplest case of aqueous sodium chloride at ambient conditions and\ndiscuss the two main factors that have impeded progress. The first is lack of\nconsensus with respect to the appropriate methodology for force field (FF)\ndevelopment. We examine how most commonly used FFs have been developed, and\nemphasize the importance of distinguishing between \"Training Set Properties\"\nused to fit the FF parameters, and \"Test Set Properties\", which are pure\npredictions of additional properties. The second is disagreement among\nsolubility results obtained, even using identical FFs and thermodynamic\nconditions. Solubility calculations have been approached using both\nthermodynamic--based methods and direct molecular dynamics--based methods\nimplementing coexisting solution and solid phases. Although convergence has\nbeen very recently achieved among results based on the former approach, there\nis as yet no general agreement with simulation results based on the latter\nmethodology. We also propose a new method to directly calculate the electrolyte\nstandard chemical potential in the Henry-Law ideality model. We conclude by\nmaking recommendations for calculating solubility, chemical potentials and\nactivity coefficients, and outline a potential path for future progress.\n", "  We present a joint theoretical and experimental study to investigate\npolymorphism in $\\alpha$-sexithiophene (6T) crystals. By means of\ndensity-functional theory calculations, we clarify that the low-temperature\nphase is favorable over the high-temperature one, with higher relative\nstability by about 50 meV/molecule. This result is in agreement with our\nthermal desorption measurements. We also propose a transition path between the\nhigh- and low-temperature 6T polymorphs, estimating an upper bound for the\nenergy barrier of about 1 eV/molecule. The analysis of the electronic\nproperties of the investigated 6T crystal structures complements our study.\n", "  We present the first photometric analysis for the newly discovered eclipsing\nbinary systems of Algole-type GSC 2750-0054 and GSC 03208-02644. Our analysis\nwas carried out by means of the most recent version of Wilson Devinney (WD)\ncode, which applies the model atmosphere by Kurucz (1993) with prescription in\npass band for the radiative treatment. The accepted light curve solutions\nreveal absolute physical parameters and the spectral classifications for the\ncomponents are adopted. Distance to each system was calculated based on the\nparameters of the accepted photometric solutions. Comparison with the\nevolutionary models are presented.\n", "  We study the quantum fidelity (groundstate overlap) near quantum phase\ntransitions of the Ising universality class in one dimensional (1D) systems of\nfinite size L. Prominent examples occur in magnetic systems (e.g. spin-Peierls,\nthe anisotropic XY model), and in 1D topological insulators of any\ntopologically nontrivial Altland-Zirnbauer-Kitaev universality class. The\nrescaled fidelity susceptibility is a function of the only dimensionless\nparameter LM, where 2M is the gap in the fermionic spectrum. We present\nanalytic expressions for the fidelity susceptibility for periodic and open\nboundaries conditions with zero, one or two edgestates. The latter are shown to\nhave a crucial impact and alter the susceptibility both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. We support our analytical solutions with numerical data.\n", "  We present 0.\"5 resolution ALMA detections of the observed 246GHz continuum,\n[CI]^3P_2-^3P_1 fine structure line ([CI]2-1), CO(7-6) and H2O lines in the\nz=2.161 radio galaxy MRC1138-262, the 'Spiderweb Galaxy'. We detect strong\n[CI]2-1 emission both at the position of the radio core, and in a second\ncomponent ~4kpc away from it. The 1100km/s broad [CI]2-1 line in this latter\ncomponent, combined with its H2 mass of 1.6x10^10Msun implies this emission\nmust come from a compact region <60pc, possibly containing a second AGN. The\ncombined H2 mass derived for both objects using the [CI]2-1 emission is\n3.3x10^10Msun. The total CO(7-6)/[CI]2-1 line flux ratio of 0.2 suggests a low\nexcitation molecular gas reservoir and/or enhanced atomic carbon in cosmic-ray\ndominated regions. We detect spatially-resolved H2O 2_{11}-2_{02} emission -\nfor the first time in a high-z un-lensed galaxy - near the outer radio lobe to\nthe east, and near the bend of the radio jet to the west of the radio galaxy.\nNo underlying 246GHz continuum emission is seen at either position. We suggest\nthat the H2O emission is excited in the cooling region behind slow (10-40km/s)\nshocks in dense molecular gas (10^{3-5} cm^-3). The extended water emission is\nlikely evidence of the radio jet's impact in cooling and forming molecules in\nthe post-shocked gas in the halo and inter-cluster gas similar to what is seen\nin low-z clusters and other high-z radio galaxies. These observations imply\nthat the passage of the radio jet in the interstellar and inter-cluster medium\nnot only heats gas to high temperatures as is commonly assumed or found in\nsimulations, but also induces cooling and dissipation which can lead to\nsubstantial amounts of cold dense molecular gas. The formation of molecules and\nstrong dissipation in the halo gas of MRC1138-262 may explain both the extended\ndiffuse molecular gas and young stars observed around MRC1138-262.\n", "  We argue that the definition of the thermodynamic work done on a charged\nparticle by a time-dependent electromagnetic field is an open problem, because\nthe particle's Hamiltonian is not gauge-invariant. The solution of this problem\ndemands accounting for the source of the field. Hence we focus on the work done\nby a heavy body (source) on a lighter particle when the interaction between\nthem is electromagnetic and relativistic. The work can be defined via the\ngauge-invariant kinetic energy of the source. We uncover a formulation of the\nfirst law (or the generalized work-energy theorem) which is derived from\nrelativistic dynamics, has definite validity conditions, and relates the work\nto the particle's Hamiltonian in the Lorenz gauge. Thereby the thermodynamic\nwork also relates to the mechanic work done by the Lorentz force acting on the\nsource. The formulation of the first law is based on a specific separation of\nthe overall energy into those of the source, particle and electromagnetic\nfield. This separation is deduced from a consistent energy-momentum tensor.\nHence it holds relativistic covariance and causality.\n", "  Scalar mesons $a^0_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ can mix with each other through\nisospin violating effects, and the mixing intensity has been predicted at the\npercent level in various theoretical models. However the mixing has not been\nfirmed established on the experimental side to date. In this work we explore\nthe possibility to extract the $a_0-f_0$ mixing intensity using weak decays of\nheavy mesons: $D_s\\to [\\pi^0\\eta, \\pi\\pi] e^+\\nu$, $B_s\\to [\\pi^0\\eta,\n\\pi\\pi]\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and the $B_s\\to J/\\psi [\\pi^0\\eta,\\pi^+\\pi^-]$ decays.\nBased on the large amount of data accumulated by various experimental\nfacilities including BEPC-II, LHC, Super KEKB and the future colliders, we find\nthat the $a_0-f_0$ mixing intensity might be determined to a high precision,\nwhich will lead to a better understanding of the nature of scalar mesons.\n", "  We have completed the one-loop renormalisation of the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) allowing for and comparing between\ndifferent renormalisation schemes. A special attention is paid to on-shell\nschemes. We study a variety of these schemes based on alternative choices of\nthe physical input parameters. In this paper we present our approach to the\nrenormalisation of the NMSSM and report on our results for the\nneutralino-chargino and sfermion sectors. We will borrow some results from our\nstudy of the Higgs sector whose full discussion is left for a separate\npublication. We have implemented the set up for all the sectors of the NMSSM\nwithin \\sloops, a code for the automatic computation of one-loop corrections\ninitially developed for the standard model and the MSSM. Among the many\napplications that allows the code, we present here the one-loop corrections to\nneutralino masses and to partial widths of neutralinos and charginos into final\nstates with one gauge boson. One-loop electroweak and QCD corrections to the\npartial widths of third generation sfermions into a fermion and a chargino or a\nneutralino are also computed.\n", "  We undertake a theoretical study of edge spin-vortex excitations in\nfractional quantum Hall fluid. This is done in view of quantised Euler\nhydrodynamics theory. The dispersions of true excitations for fractions within\n$0\\leq \\nu \\leq 1$ are simulated which exhibit universal similarities and\ndifferences in behaviour. The differences arise from different edge smoothness\nand spin (pseudo-spin) polarisations, in addition to spin-charge competition.\nIn particular, tuning the spin-charge factor causes coherent spin flipping\nassociated with partial and total polarisations of edge spin-vortices. This\nobservation is tipped as an ideal mechanism for realisation of functional\nspintronic devices.\n", "  We propose the unimodular-mimetic $F(R)$ gravity theory, to resolve\ncosmological constant problem and dark matter problem in a unified geometric\nmanner. We demonstrate that such a theory naturally admits accelerating\nuniverse evolution. Furthermore, we construct unimodular-mimetic $F(R)$\ninflationary cosmological scenarios compatible with the Planck and\nBICEP2/Keck-Array observational data. We also address the graceful exit issue,\nwhich is guaranteed by the existence of unstable de Sitter vacua.\n", "  Addressing the temperature and strain induced cross-talks simultaneously, we\npropose an inherently strain and temperature insensitive fiber-optic\nbio-sensor. The insensitivity has been achieved by properly adjusting the\ndopants and their concentrations in the optical fiber core region, and by\noptimizing the grating period and the strength of concatenated dual-resonance\nlong-period-gratings. The simulations have been carried out using the same\nfiber parameters as used in our earlier experimental studies, which matched\nexcellently with the experimental results. The proposed sensor has a\ntheoretical refractive-index sensitivity of 4607 nm/RIU, which can be used to\ndetect changes as small as 2.2 x10^-7 in ambient refractive indices using a\ndetection system with spectral resolution of 1 pm. Our work finds application\nin developing precision biosensors with inherent insensitivity towards\ntemperature and axial strain fluctuations. The sensor is currently under\nfabrication at our lab.\n", "  We show that a critical temperature Tc for spin-singlet two-dimensional\nsuperconductivity is enhanced by a cooperation between the Zeeman magnetic\nfield and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, where a superconductivity becomes\ntopologically non-trivial below Tc. The dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) with\nthe segment-based hybridization-expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo\nimpurity solver (ct-HYB) is used for accurately evaluating a critical\ntemperature, without any Fermion sign problem. A strong-coupling approach shows\nthat spin-flip driven local pair hopping leads to part of this enhancement,\nespecially effects of the magnetic field. We propose physical settings suitable\nfor verifying the present calculations, one-atom-layer system on Si(111) and\nionic-liquid based electric double-layer transistors (EDLTs).\n", "  We study the intersections of two sets of D-branes of different\ndimensionalities. This configuration is dual to a supersymmetric gauge theory\nwith flavor hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge\ngroup which live on the defect of the unflavored theory determined by the\ndirections common to the two types of branes. One set of branes is dual to the\ncolor degrees of freedom, while the other set adds flavor to the system. We\nwork in the quenched approximation, i.e., where the flavor branes are\nconsidered as probes, and focus specifically on the case in which the quarks\nare massive. We study the thermodynamics and the speeds of first and zero sound\nat zero temperature and non-vanishing chemical potential. We show that the\nsystem undergoes a quantum phase transition when the chemical potential\napproaches its minimal value and we obtain the corresponding non-relativistic\ncritical exponents that characterize its critical behavior. In the case of\n(2+1)-dimensional intersections, we further study alternative quantization and\nthe zero sound of the resulting anyonic fluid. We finally extend these results\nto non-zero temperature and magnetic field and compute the diffusion constant\nin the hydrodynamic regime. The numerical results we find match the predictions\nby the Einstein relation.\n", "  Recently, carbon hyperhoneycomb ($\\mathcal{H}$-n) lattices have been proposed\nto be, through a one-$p$ orbital tight-binding (TB) model with nearest-neighbor\n(n.n.) hopping, a family of strong 3D topological insulators (K. Mullen, B.\nUchoa and D. T. Glatzhofer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 026403 (2015)) . In this\nComment we show, through Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Extended H\\\"uckel\nTheory (EHT) calculations for the $\\mathcal{H}$-0 lattice, that the TB\nHamiltonian used by the authors is inadequate, invalidating the presented\nconclusions.\n", "  We present the results of a search for WIMPs from the commissioning run of\nthe PandaX-II experiment located at the China Jinping underground Laboratory. A\nWIMP search data set with an exposure of 306$\\times$19.1 kg-day was taken,\nwhile its dominant $^{85}$Kr background was used as the electron recoil\ncalibration. No WIMP candidates are identified, and a 90\\% upper limit is set\non the spin-independent elastic WIMP-nucleon cross section with a lowest\nexcluded cross section of 2.97$\\times$10$^{-45}$~cm$^2$ at a WIMP mass of\n44.7~GeV/c$^2$.\n", "  A network of neurons in the central nervous system collectively represents\ninformation by its spiking activity states. Typically observed states, i.e.,\ncodewords, occupy only a limited portion of the state space due to constraints\nimposed by network interactions. Geometrical organization of codewords in the\nstate space, critical for neural information processing, is poorly understood\ndue to its high dimensionality. Here, we explore the organization of neural\ncodewords using retinal data by computing the entropy of codewords as a\nfunction of Hamming distance from a particular reference codeword.\nSpecifically, we report that the retinal codewords in the state space are\ndivided into multiple distinct clusters separated by entropy-gaps, and that\nthis structure is shared with well-known associative memory networks in a\nrecallable phase. Our analysis also elucidates a special nature of the\nall-silent state. The all-silent state is surrounded by the densest cluster of\ncodewords and located within a reachable distance from most codewords. This\ncodeword-space structure quantitatively predicts typical deviation of a\nstate-trajectory from its initial state. Altogether, our findings reveal a\nnon-trivial heterogeneous structure of the codeword-space that shapes\ninformation representation in a biological network.\n", "  BOUT++ is a software package designed for solving plasma fluid models. It has\nbeen used to simulate a wide range of plasma phenomena ranging from linear\nstability analysis to 3D plasma turbulence, and is capable of simulating a wide\nrange of drift-reduced plasma fluid and gyro-fluid models. A verification\nexercise has been performed as part of a EUROfusion Enabling Research project,\nto rigorously test the correctness of the algorithms implemented in BOUT++, by\ntesting order-of-accuracy convergence rates using the Method of Manufactured\nSolutions (MMS). We present tests of individual components including\ntime-integration and advection schemes, non-orthogonal coordinate systems and\nthe shifted metric procedure which is used to handle highly sheared grids. The\nFlux Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach to differencing along magnetic\nfield-lines has been implemented in BOUT++, and is here verified using the MMS\nin a sheared slab configuration. Finally we show tests of three complete\nmodels: 2-field Hasegawa-Wakatani, 3-field reduced MHD in 3D toroidal\ncoordinates, and 5-field reduced MHD in slab geometry.\n", "  We consider banana shaped regions as examples of compact regions, whose\nboundary has two conical singularities. Their regularised holographic entropy\nis calculated with all divergent as well as finite terms. The coefficient of\nthe squared logarithmic divergence, also in such a case with internally curved\nboundary, agrees with that calculated in the literature for infinite circular\ncones with their internally flat boundary. For the otherwise conformally\ninvariant coefficient of the ordinary logarithmic divergence an anomaly under\nexceptional conformal transformations is observed.\n  The construction of minimal submanifolds, needed for the entanglement entropy\nof cones, requires fine-tuning of Cauchy data. Perturbations of such\nfine-tuning leads to solutions relevant for hollow cones. The divergent parts\nfor the entanglement entropy of hollow cones are calculated. Increasing the\ndifference between the opening angles of their outer and inner boundary, one\nfinds a transition between connected solutions for small differences to\ndisconnected solutions for larger ones.\n", "  Gravitation theory is formulated as gauge theory on natural bundles with\nspontaneous symmetry breaking where gauge symmetries are general covariant\ntransformations, gauge fields are general linear connections, and Higgs fields\nare pseudo-Riemannian metrics.\n", "  We present numerical-relativity simulations of spherically symmetric core\ncollapse and compact-object formation in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The\nadditional scalar degree of freedom introduces a propagating monopole\ngravitational-wave mode. Detection of monopole scalar waves with current and\nfuture gravitational-wave experiments may constitute smoking gun evidence for\nstrong-field modifications of General Relativity. We collapse both polytropic\nand more realistic pre-supernova profiles using a high-resolution\nshock-capturing scheme and an approximate prescription for the nuclear equation\nof state. The most promising sources of scalar radiation are protoneutron stars\ncollapsing to black holes. In case of a Galactic core collapse event forming a\nblack hole, Advanced LIGO may be able to place independent constraints on the\nparameters of the theory at a level comparable to current Solar-System and\nbinary-pulsar measurements. In the region of the parameter space admitting\nspontaneously scalarised stars, transition to configurations with prominent\nscalar hair before black-hole formation further enhances the emitted signal.\nAlthough a more realistic treatment of the microphysics is necessary to fully\ninvestigate the occurrence of spontaneous scalarisation of neutron star\nremnants, we speculate that formation of such objects could constrain the\nparameters of the theory beyond the current bounds obtained with Solar-System\nand binary-pulsar experiments.\n", "  Bosons hopping across sites and interacting on-site are the essence of the\nBose-Hubbard model (BHM). Inspired by the success of BHM simulators with atoms\nin optical lattices, proposals for implementing the BHM with photons in coupled\nnonlinear cavities have emerged. Two coupled semiconductor microcavities\nconstitute a model system where the hopping, interaction, and decay of exciton\npolaritons --- mixed light-matter quasiparticles --- can be engineered in\ncombination with site-selective coherent driving to implement the\ndriven-dissipative two-site optical BHM. Here we explore the interplay of\ninterference and nonlinearity in this system, in a regime where three distinct\ndensity profiles can be observed under identical driving conditions. We\ndemonstrate how the phase acquired by polaritons hopping between cavities can\nbe controlled through effective polariton-polariton interactions. Our results\nopen new perspectives for synthesizing density-dependent gauge fields for\npolaritons in two-dimensional multicavity systems.\n", "  In this work we present cosmological solutions from the simplest non-trivial\n$T$-dependence in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, with $R$ and $T$ standing for the\nRicci scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. Although\nsuch an approach yields a highly non-linear differential equation for the scale\nfactor, we show that it is possible to obtain analytical solutions for the\ncosmological parameters. For some values of the free parameters, the model is\nable to predict a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of\nthe universe.\n", "  We study the effects of Rayleigh and Raman scattering on the formation of\npolarized spectral lines in a $\\Lambda$-type multi-term atom. We fully take\ninto account the partial redistribution of frequency and the presence of atomic\npolarization in the lower states of the atomic model. Problems that can be\nmodeled with this formalism include, for example, the formation of the Ca II\nH-K and IR triplet, the analogous system of Ba II, and the Ly$\\beta$-H$\\alpha$\nsystem of hydrogenic ions.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the parsec-scale radio emission from the\nchanging-look active galactic nucleus (AGN) of Mrk 590, and examine whether the\nradio power has faded concurrently with the dramatic decrease in accretion\nrates observed between the 1990s and the present. We detect a compact core at\n1.6 GHz and 8.4 GHz using new Very Long Baseline Array observations, finding no\nsignificant extended, jet-like features down to $\\sim$1 pc scales. The flat\nspectral index ($\\alpha_{1.6}^{8.4} = 0.03$) and high brightness temperature\n($T_{\\rm b} \\sim 10^{8}\\,\\rm K$) indicate self-absorbed synchrotron emission\nfrom the AGN. The radio to X-ray luminosity ratio of ${\\rm log}(L_{\\rm\nR}/L_{\\rm X}) \\sim -5$, similar to that in coronally active stars, suggests\nemission from magnetized coronal winds, although unresolved radio jets are also\nconsistent with the data. Comparing new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\nmeasurements with archival and published radio flux densities, we find $46\\%$,\n$34\\%$, and (insignificantly) $13\\%$ flux density decreases between the 1990s\nand the year 2015 at 1.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 8.4 GHz respectively. This trend,\npossibly due to the expansion and fading of internal shocks within the\nradio-emitting outflow after a recent outburst, is consistent with the decline\nof the optical-UV and X-ray luminosities over the same period. Such correlated\nvariability demonstrates the AGN accretion-outflow connection, confirming that\nthe changing-look behaviour in Mrk 590 originates from variable accretion rates\nrather than dust obscuration. The present radio and X-ray luminosity\ncorrelation, consistent with low/hard state accretion, suggests that the black\nhole may now be accreting in a radiatively inefficient mode.\n", "  We experimentally study the transient voltage response of yttrium iron\ngarnet/platinum bilayer samples subject to periodic heating up to gigahertz\nfrequencies. We observe an intrinsic cutoff frequency of the induced\nthermopower voltage, which characteristically depends on the thickness of the\nyttrium iron garnet film. The cutoff frequency reaches values of up to 350 MHz\nin a 50 nm thick yttrium iron garnet film, but drops to below 1 MHz for\nseveral-micrometer-thick films. These data corroborate the notion that the\nmagnon spectrum responsible for the spin current emission in the spin Seebeck\neffect can be shaped by tuning the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer.\n", "  We study several aspects of the $N=1$ super Liouville theory. We show that\ncertain elements of the fusion matrix in the Neveu-Schwarz sector related to\nthe structure constants according to the same rules which we observe in\nrational conformal field theory. We collect some evidences that these relations\nshould hold also in the Ramond sector. Using them the Cardy-Lewellen equation\nfor defects is studied, and defects are constructed.\n", "  We present a general approach to calculating the entanglement of formation\nfor superpositions of two-mode coherent states, placed equidistantly on a\ncircle in the phase space. We show that in the particular case of\nrotationally-invariant circular states the Schmidt decomposition of two modes,\nand therefore the value of their entanglement, are given by analytical\nexpressions. We analyse the dependence of the entanglement on the radius of the\ncircle and number of components in the superposition. We also show that the set\nof rotationally-invariant circular states creates an orthonormal basis in the\nstate space of the harmonic oscillator, and this basis is advantageous for\nrepresentation of other circular states of light.\n", "  We demonstrate correlated photon pair generation via spontaneous four-wave\nmixing in a low-loss double-stripe silicon nitride waveguide with a\ncoincidence-to-accidental ratio over 10. The coincidence-to-accidental ratio is\nlimited by spontaneous Raman scattering, which can be mitigated by cooling in\nthe future. This demonstration suggests that this waveguide structure is a\npotential platform to develop integrated quantum photonic chips for quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  We find that (massive) IIA backgrounds that admit a $G_2\\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^8$\ninvariant Killing spinor must exhibit a null Killing vector field which leaves\nthe Killing spinor invariant and that the rotation of the Killing vector field\nsatisfies a certain $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ instanton condition. This result together\nwith those in [4] and [5] complete the classification of geometries of all\n(massive) IIA backgrounds that preserve one supersymmetry. We also explore the\ngeometry of a class of backgrounds which admit a $G_2\\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^8$\ninvariant Killing spinor and where in addition an appropriate 1-form bilinear\nvanishes. In all cases, we express the fluxes of the theory in terms of the\ngeometry.\n", "  We numerically study, by means of the single envelope equation, the\ngeneration of optical frequency combs ranging from the visible to the\nmid-infrared spectral regions in resonators with quadratic and cubic\nnonlinearities. Phase-matched quadratic wave-mixing processes among the comb\nlines can be activated by low-power continuous wave pumping in the near\ninfrared of a radially poled lithium niobate whispering gallery resonator\n(WGR). We examine both separate and co-existing intra-cavity doubly resonant\nsecond-harmonic generation and parametric oscillation processes, and find that\nmodulation instabilities may lead to the formation of coupled comb arrays\nextending over multiple octaves. In the temporal domain, the frequency combs\nmay correspond to pulse trains, or isolated pulses.\n", "  For particle physics observables at colliders such as the LHC at CERN, it has\nbeen common practice for many decades to estimate the theoretical uncertainty\nby studying the variations of the predicted cross sections with a priori\nunpredictable scales. In astroparticle physics, this has so far not been\npossible, since most of the observables were calculated at Born level only, so\nthat the renormalization scheme and scale dependence could not be studied in a\nmeaningful way. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of the\ntheoretical uncertainty of the neutralino dark matter relic density from scheme\nand scale variations. We first explain in detail how the renormalization scale\nenters the tree-level calculations through coupling constants, masses and\nmixing angles. We then demonstrate a reduction of the renormalization scale\ndependence through one-loop SUSY-QCD corrections in many different dark matter\nannihilation channels and enhanced perturbative stability of a mixed\non-shell/$\\bar{\\rm DR}$ renormalization scheme over a pure $\\bar{\\rm DR}$\nscheme in the top-quark sector. In the stop-stop annihilation channel, the\nSommerfeld enhancement and its scale dependence are shown to be of particular\nimportance. Finally, the impact of our higher-order SUSY-QCD corrections and\ntheir scale uncertainties are studied in three typical scenarios of the\nphenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with eleven parameters\n(pMSSM-11). We find that the theoretical uncertainty is reduced in many cases\nand can become comparable to the size of the experimental one in some\nscenarios.\n", "  We consider the minimal version of an extension of the standard electroweak\nmodel based on the $SU(3)_c \\times SU(3)_L \\times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry (the\n3-3-1 model). We analyze the most general potential constructed from three\nscalars in the triplet representation of $SU(3)_L$, whose neutral components\ndevelop nonzero vacuum expectation values, giving mass for all the model's\nmassive particles. {}For different choices of parameters, we obtain the\nparticle spectrum for the two symmetry breaking scales: one where the $SU(3)_L\n\\times U(1)_X$ group is broken down to $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ and a lower scale\nsimilar to the standard model one. Within the considerations used, we show that\nthe model encodes two first-order phase transitions, respecting the pattern of\nsymmetry restoration. The last transition, corresponding to the standard\nelectroweak one, is found to be very weak first-order, most likely turning\nsecond-order or a crossover in practice. However, the first transition in this\nmodel can be strongly first-order, which might happen at a temperature not too\nhigh above the second one. We determine the respective critical temperatures\nfor symmetry restoration for the model.\n", "  We present the first analytic computation of the Detweiler-Barack-Sago\ngauge-invariant redshift function for a small mass in {\\it eccentric} orbit\naround a {\\it spinning} black hole. Our results give the redshift contributions\nthat mix eccentricity and spin effects, through second order in eccentricity,\nsecond order in spin parameter, and the eight-and-a-half post-Newtonian order.\n", "  We present an experimental method for the generation of amplitude squeezed\nhigh-order vector beams. The light is modified twice by a spatial light\nmodulator such that the vector beam is created by means of a collinear\ninterferometric technique. A major advantage of this approach is that it avoids\nsystematic losses, which are detrimental as they cause decoherence in\ncontinuous-variable quantum systems. The utilisation of a spatial light\nmodulator (SLM) gives the flexibility to switch between arbitrary mode orders.\nThe conversion efficiency with our setup is only limited by the efficiency of\nthe SLM. We show the experimental generation of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes with\nradial indices up to 1 and azimuthal indices up to 3 with complex polarization\nstructures and a quantum noise reduction up to -0.9dB$\\pm$0.1dB. The\ncorresponding polarization structures are studied in detail by measuring the\nspatial distribution of the Stokes parameters.\n", "  A photonic integrated circuit for mode multiplexing and demultiplexing in a\nfew-mode fiber is presented and demonstrated. Two 10 Gbit/s channels at the\nsame wavelength and polarization are simultaneously transmitted over modes LP01\nand LP11a of a few-mode fiber exploiting the integrated mode MUX and DEMUX. The\nproposed Indium-Phosphide-based circuits have a good coupling efficiency with\nfiber modes with mode-dependant loss smaller than 1 dB. Measured mode\nexcitation cross-talk is as low as -20 dB and a channel cross-talk after\npropagation and demultiplexing of -15 dB is achieved. An operational bandwidth\nof the full transmission system of at least 10 nm is demonstrated. Both mode\nMUX and DEMUX are fully reconfigurable and allow a dynamic switch of channel\nrouting in the transmission system.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamics of epidemic processes taking place in\nadaptive networks of arbitrary topology. We focus our study on the adaptive\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (ASIS) model, where healthy individuals are\nallowed to temporarily cut edges connecting them to infected nodes in order to\nprevent the spread of the infection. In this paper, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the ASIS model in\narbitrary networks with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics. For networks with\nhomogeneous node and edge dynamics, we show that the resulting \\blue{lower\nbound} is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard SIS model over\nstatic networks, with a proportionality constant that depends on the adaptation\nrates. Furthermore, based on our results, we propose an efficient algorithm to\noptimally tune the adaptation rates in order to eradicate epidemic outbreaks in\narbitrary networks. We confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bounds with\nseveral numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with\npopular centrality measures.\n", "  We explore the Micron Automata Processor (AP) as a suitable commodity\ntechnology that can address the growing computational needs of pattern\nrecognition in High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. A toy detector model is\ndeveloped for which an electron track confirmation trigger based on the Micron\nAP serves as a test case. Although primarily meant for high speed text-based\nsearches, we demonstrate a proof of concept for the use of the Micron AP in a\nHEP trigger application.\n", "  S-folds are generalizations of orientifolds in type IIB string theory, such\nthat the geometric identifications are accompanied by non-trivial S-duality\ntransformations. They were recently used by Garcia-Etxebarria and Regalado to\nprovide the first construction of four dimensional N=3 superconformal theories.\nIn this note, we classify the different variants of these N=3 preserving\nS-folds, distinguished by an analog of discrete torsion, using both a direct\nanalysis of the different torsion classes and the compactification of the\nS-folds to three dimensional M-theory backgrounds. Upon adding D3-branes, these\nvariants lead to different classes of N=3 superconformal field theories. We\nalso analyze the holographic duals of these theories, and in particular clarify\nthe role of discrete gauge and global symmetries in holography.\n", "  We show that the class QAM does not change even if the verifier's ability is\nrestricted to only single-qubit measurements. To show the result, we use the\nidea of the measurement-based quantum computing: the verifier, who can do only\nsingle-qubit measurements, can test the graph state sent from the prover and\nuse it for his measurement-based quantum computing. We also introduce a new\nQMA-complete problem related to the stabilizer test.\n", "  We study the zero-temperature quantum phase diagram of a spin-1 Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice with both nearest-neighbor exchange\ncoupling $J_{1}>0$ and frustrating next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_{2} \\equiv\n\\kappa J_{1} > 0$, using the coupled cluster method implemented to high orders\nof approximation, and based on model states with different forms of classical\nmagnetic order. For each we calculate directly in the bulk thermodynamic limit\nboth ground-state low-energy parameters (including the energy per spin,\nmagnetic order parameter, spin stiffness coefficient, and zero-field uniform\ntransverse magnetic susceptibility) and their generalized susceptibilities to\nvarious forms of valence-bond crystalline (VBC) order, as well as the energy\ngap to the lowest-lying spin-triplet excitation. In the range $0 < \\kappa < 1$\nwe find evidence for four distinct phases. Two of these are quasiclassical\nphases with antiferromagnetic long-range order, one with 2-sublattice N\\'{e}el\norder for $\\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.250(5)$, and another with 4-sublattice\nN\\'{e}el-II order for $\\kappa > \\kappa_{c_{2}} = 0.340(5)$. Two different\nparamagnetic phases are found to exist in the intermediate region. Over the\nrange $\\kappa_{c_{1}} < \\kappa < \\kappa^{i}_{c} = 0.305(5)$ we find a gapless\nphase with no discernible magnetic order, which is a strong candidate for being\na quantum spin liquid, while over the range $\\kappa^{i}_{c} < \\kappa <\n\\kappa_{c_{2}}$ we find a gapped phase, which is most likely a lattice nematic\nwith staggered dimer VBC order that breaks the lattice rotational symmetry.\n", "  We consider warped AdS_3 black holes in generic higher derivatives gravity\ntheories in 2+1 dimensions. The asymptotic symmetry group of the phase space\ncontaining these black holes is the semi-direct product of a centrally extended\nVirasoro algebra and an affine u(1) Kac-Moody algebra. Previous works have\nshown that in some specific theories, the entropy of these black holes agrees\nwith a Cardy-like entropy formula derived for warped conformal field theories.\nIn this paper, we show that this entropy matching continues to hold for the\nmost general higher derivative theories of gravity. We also discuss the\nexistence of phase transitions.\n", "  Aims: We aim to find torus models that explain the observed high-resolution\nmid-infrared (MIR) measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our goal is to\ndetermine the general properties of the circumnuclear dusty environments.\n  Methods: We used the MIR interferometric data of a sample of AGNs provided by\nthe instrument MIDI/VLTI and followed a statistical approach to compare the\nobserved distribution of the interferometric data with the distributions\ncomputed from clumpy torus models. We mainly tested whether the diversity of\nSeyfert galaxies can be described using the Standard Model idea. In addition to\nline-of-sight (LOS) effects, we performed different realizations of the same\nmodel to include possible variations that are caused by the stochastic nature\nof the dusty models.\n  Results: We find that our entire sample of AGNs, which contains both Seyfert\ntypes, cannot be explained merely by an inclination effect and by including\nrandom variations of the clouds. Instead, we find that each subset of Seyfert\ntype can be explained by different models, where the filling factor at the\ninner radius seems to be the largest difference. For type I objects we find\nthat about two thirds of our objects could also be described using a dusty\ntorus similar to the type II objects. For the remaining third, it was not\npossible to find a good description using models with high filling factors,\nwhile we found good fits with models with low filling factors.\n  Conclusions: Within our model assumptions, we did not find one single set of\nmodel parameters that could simultaneously explain the MIR data of all 21 AGN\nwith LOS effects and random variations alone. We conclude that at least two\ndistinct cloud configurations are required to model the differences in Seyfert\ngalaxies, with volume-filling factors differing by a factor of about 5-10. A\ncontinuous transition between the two types cannot be excluded.\n", "  Non-thermal histories for the early universe have received notable attention\nas they are a rich source of phenomenology, while also being well motivated by\ntop-down approaches to beyond the Standard Model physics. The early (pre-BBN)\nmatter phase in these models leads to enhanced growth of density perturbations\non sub-Hubble scales. Here we consider whether primordial black hole formation\nassociated with the enhanced growth is in conflict with existing observations.\nSuch constraints depend on the tilt of the primordial power spectrum, and we\nfind that non-thermal histories are tightly constrained in the case of a\nsignificantly blue spectrum. Alternatively, if dark matter is taken to be of\nnon-thermal origin we can restrict the primordial power spectrum on scales\ninaccessible to CMB and LSS observations. We establish constraints for a wide\nrange of scalar masses (reheat temperatures) with the most stringent bounds\nresulting from the formation of $10^{15}$ g black holes. These black holes\nwould be evaporating today and are constrained by FERMI observations. We also\nconsider whether the breakdown of the coherence of the scalar oscillations on\nsub-horizon scales can lead to a Jean's pressure preventing black hole\nformation and relaxing our constraints. Our main conclusion is that primordial\nblack hole constraints, combined with existing constraints on non-thermal\nWIMPs, favor a primordial spectrum closer to scale invariance or a red tilted\nspectrum.\n", "  The Milky Way bulge has a boxy/peanut morphology and an X-shaped structure.\nThis X-shape has been revealed by the `split in the red clump' from star counts\nalong the line of sight toward the bulge, measured from photometric surveys.\nThis boxy, X-shaped bulge morphology is not unique to the Milky Way and such\nbulges are observed in other barred spiral galaxies. N-body simulations show\nthat boxy and X-shaped bulges are formed from the disk via dynamical\ninstabilities. It has also been proposed that the Milky Way bulge is not\nX-shaped, but rather, the apparent split in the red clump stars is a\nconsequence of different stellar populations, in an old classical spheroidal\nbulge. We present a WISE image of the Milky Way bulge, produced by downsampling\nthe publicly available \"unWISE\" coadds. The WISE image of the Milky Way bulge\nshows that the X-shaped nature of the Milky Way bulge is self-evident and\nirrefutable. The X-shape morphology of the bulge in itself and the fraction of\nbulge stars that comprise orbits within this structure has important\nimplications for the formation history of the Milky Way, and, given the\nubiquity of boxy X-shaped bulges, spiral galaxies in general.\n", "  We derive exact expressions for the scalar and electromagnetic self-forces\nand self-torques acting on arbitrary static extended bodies in arbitrary static\nspacetimes with any number of dimensions. Non-perturbatively, our results are\nidentical in all dimensions. Meaningful point particle limits are quite\ndifferent in different dimensions, however. These limits are defined and\nevaluated, resulting in simple \"regularization algorithms\" which can be used in\nconcrete calculations. In these limits, self-interaction is shown to be\nprogressively less important in higher numbers of dimensions; it generically\ncompetes in magnitude with increasingly high-order extended-body effects.\nConversely, we show that self-interaction effects can be relatively large in\n$1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. Our motivations for this work are twofold: First,\nno previous derivation of the self-force has been provided in arbitrary\ndimensions, and heuristic arguments presented by different authors have\nresulted in conflicting conclusions. Second, the static self-force problem in\narbitrary dimensions provides a valuable testbed with which to continue the\ndevelopment of general, non-perturbative methods in the theory of motion.\nSeveral new insights are obtained in this direction, including a significantly\nimproved understanding of the renormalization process. We also show that there\nis considerable freedom to use different \"effective fields\" in the laws of\nmotion---a freedom which can be exploited to optimally simplify specific\nproblems. Different choices give rise to different inertias, gravitational\nforces, and electromagnetic or scalar self-forces, but there is a sense in\nwhich none of these quantities are individually accessible to experiment.\nCertain combinations are observable, however, and these remain invariant under\nall possible field redefinitions.\n", "  Properties of the depleted Heisenberg spin ladder material series\n(C$_7$H$_{10}$N)$_2$Cu$_{1-z}$Zn$_{z}$Br$_4$ have been studied by the\ncombination of magnetic measurements and neutron spectroscopy. Disorder-induced\ndegrees of freedom lead to a specific magnetic response, described in terms of\nemergent strongly interacting \"spin island\" objects. The structure and dynamics\nof the spin islands is studied by high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering.\nThis allows to determine their spatial shape and to observe their mutual\ninteractions, manifested by strong spectral in-gap contributions.\n", "  While conventional optical trapping techniques can trap objects with\nsubmicron dimensions, the underlying limits imposed by the diffraction of light\ngenerally restrict their use to larger or higher refractive index particles. As\nthe index and diameter decrease, the trapping difficulty rapidly increases;\nhence, the power requirements for stable trapping become so large as to quickly\ndenature the trapped objects in such diffraction-limited systems. Here, we\npresent an evanescent field based device capable of confining low index\nnanoscale particles using modest optical powers as low as 1.2 mW, with\nadditional applications in the field of cold atom trapping. Our experiment uses\na nanostructured optical micro-nanofiber to trap 200 nm, low index contrast,\nfluorescent particles within the structured region, thereby overcoming\ndiffraction limitations. We analyze the trapping potential of this device both\nexperimentally and theoretically, and show how strong optical traps are\nachieved with low input powers.\n", "  We reinvestigate the putative giant spin splitting at the surface of\nSrTiO$_3$ reported by Santander-Syro $et~al.$ [Nature Mat. 13, 1085 (2014)].\nOur spin- and angle-resolved photoemission experiments on (001) oriented\nsurfaces supporting a two-dimensional electron liquid with high carrier density\nshow no detectable spin polarization in the photocurrent. We demonstrate that\nthis result excludes a giant spin splitting while it is fully consistent with\nthe unconventional Rashba-like splitting seen in band structure calculations\nthat reproduce the experimentally observed ladder of quantum confined subbands.\n", "  We consider the coupling of a free scalar to a single-trace operator of a\nlarge N CFT in d dimensions. This is equivalent to a double-trace deformation\ncoupling two primary operators of the CFT, in the limit when one of the two\nsaturates the unitarity bound. At leading order, the RG-flow has a non-trivial\nfixed point where multiplets recombine. We show this phenomenon in field\ntheory, and provide the holographic dual description. Free scalars correspond\nto singleton representations of the AdS algebra. The double-trace interaction\nis mapped to a boundary condition mixing the singleton with the bulk field dual\nto the single-trace operator. In the IR, the singleton and the bulk scalar\nmerge, providing just one long representation of the AdS algebra.\n", "  Radial velocity observations of stars are entering the sub-m/s domain\nrevealing fundamental barriers for Doppler precision experiments. Observations\nof the Sun as a star can easily overcome the m/s photon limit but face other\nobstacles. We introduce the G\\\"ottingen Solar Radial Velocity Project with the\ngoal to obtain high precision (cm/s) radial velocity measurements of the Sun as\na star with a Fourier Transform Spectrograph. In this first paper, we present\nthe project and first results. The photon limit of our 2 min observations is at\nthe 2 cm/s level but currently limited by strong instrumental systematics. A\ndrift of a few m/s per h is visible in all observing days probably caused by\nvignetting of the solar disk in our fiber coupled setup, and imperfections of\nour guiding system adds further offsets in our data. Binning the data into 30\nmin groups shows m/s stability after correcting for a daily and linear\ninstrumental trend. Our results show the potential of Sun-as-a-star radial\nvelocity measurements that can possibly be achieved after a substantial upgrade\nof our spectrograph coupling strategy. Sun-as-a-star observations can provide\ncrucial empirical information about the radial velocity signal of convective\nmotion and stellar activity, and on the wavelength dependence of radial\nvelocity signals caused by stellar line profile variations.\n", "  We present evidence of strain-induced modulation of electron correlation\neffects and increased orbital anisotropy in the rutile phase of epitaxial\nVO$_2$/TiO$_2$ films from hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and soft V\nL-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy, respectively. By using the U(1) slave\nspin formalism, we further argue that the observed anisotropic correlation\neffects can be understood by a model of orbital selective Mott transition at a\nfilling that is non-integer, but close to the half-filling. Because the\noverlaps of wave functions between $d$ orbitals are modified by the strain,\norbitally-dependent renormalizations of the bandwidths and the crystal fields\noccur with the application of strain. These renormalizations generally result\nin different occupation numbers in different orbitals. We find that if the\nsystem has a non-integer filling number near the half-filling such as for\nVO$_2$, certain orbitals could reach an occupation number closer to\nhalf-filling under the strain, resulting in a strong reduction in the\nquasiparticle weight $Z_{\\alpha}$ of that orbital. Moreover, an orbital\nselective Mott transition, defined as the case with $Z_{\\alpha} = 0$ in some,\nbut not all orbitals, could be accessed by epitaxial strain-engineering of\ncorrelated electron systems.\n", "  We study the cusp anomalous dimension in N=6 ABJ(M) theory, identifying a\nscaling limit in which the ladder diagrams dominate. The resummation is encoded\ninto a Bethe-Salpeter equation that is mapped to a Schroedinger problem,\nexactly solvable due to the surprising supersymmetry of the effective\nHamiltonian. In the ABJ case the solution implies the diagonalization of the\nU(N) and U(M) building blocks, suggesting the existence of two independent cusp\nanomalous dimensions and an unexpected exponentiation structure for the related\nWilson loops. While consistent with previous perturbative analysis, the strong\ncoupling limit of our result does not agree with the string theory computation,\nemphasizing a difference with the analogous resummation in the N=4 case.\n", "  We study the partition function of the orientifold ABJM theory, which is a\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory associated with the orthosymplectic\nsupergroup. We find that the partition function associated with any\northosymplectic supergroup can be realized as the partition function of a Fermi\ngas system whose density matrix is identical to that associated with the\ncorresponding unitary supergroup with a projection to the even or odd\nchirality. Furthermore we propose an identity which gives directly all of the\nGopakumar-Vafa invariants for the worldsheet instanton effects in the chirally\nprojected theories.\n", "  Electron vortex beams hold great promise for development in transmission\nelectron microscopy, but have yet to be widely adopted. This is partly due to\nthe complex set of interactions that occur between a beam carrying orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) and a sample. Herein, the system is simplified to focus\non the interaction between geometrical symmetries, OAM and topology. We present\nmultiple simulations, alongside experimental data to study the behaviour of a\nvariety of electron vortex beams after interacting with apertures of different\nsymmetries, and investigate the effect on their OAM and vortex structure, both\nin the far-field and under free-space propagation.\n", "  Depending on the assumptions on the power corrections to the exclusive b -> s\nl+ l- decays, the latest data of the LHCb collaboration - based on the 3 fb^-1\ndata set and on two different experimental analysis methods - still shows some\ntensions with the SM predictions. We present a detailed analysis of the\ntheoretical inputs and various global fits to all the available b -> s l+ l-\ndata. This constitutes the first global analysis of the new data of the LHCb\ncollaboration based on the hypothesis that these tensions can be at least\npartially explained by new physics contributions. In our model-independent\nanalysis we present one-, two-, four-, and also five-dimensional global fits in\nthe space of Wilson coefficients to all available b -> s l+ l- data. We also\ncompare the two different experimental LHCb analyses of the angular observables\nin B -> K* mu+ mu-. We explicitly analyse the dependence of our results on the\nassumptions about power corrections, but also on the errors present in the form\nfactor calculations. Moreover, based on our new global fits we present\npredictions for ratios of observables which may show a sign of lepton\nnon-universality. Their measurements would crosscheck the LHCb result on the\nratio R_K = BR(B+ -> K+ mu+ mu-) / BR(B+ -> K+ e+ e-) in the low-q^2 region\nwhich deviates from the SM prediction by 2.6 sigma.\n", "  We show how graph theory can be combined with quantum theory to calculate the\nelectronic structure of large complex systems. The graph formalism is general\nand applicable to a broad range of electronic structure methods and materials,\nincluding challenging systems such as biomolecules. The methodology combines\nwell-controlled accuracy, low computational cost, and natural low-communication\nparallelism. This combination addresses substantial shortcomings of linear\nscaling electronic structure theory, in particular with respect to\nquantum-based molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  Extensions of the Standard Model Higgs sector with electroweak charged\nscalars can possess exotic `Higgs' bosons with vanishing or suppressed\ncouplings to Standard Model fermions. These `fermiophobic' scalars, which\ncannot be produced via gluon fusion, are constrained by LHC measurements of the\n125 GeV Higgs boson to have a small vacuum expectation value. This implies that\nvector boson fusion and associated vector boson production are in general\nsuppressed rendering conventional Higgs searches insensitive. However,\nDrell-Yan Higgs pair production, which is not present in the SM, can be\nsizeable even in the limit of vanishing exotic Higgs vacuum expectation value.\nWe utilize this to show that diphoton searches at 8 TeV LHC already rule out a\nlarge class of neutral fermiophobic Higgs bosons below around 110 GeV. This\nincludes fermiophobic scalars found in two Higgs doublet as well as Higgs\ntriplet and Georgi-Machacek type models. Our results extend the only relevant\nlimit on fermiophobic Higgs bosons obtained by a recent CDF analysis of\n$4\\gamma + X$ Tevatron data. Furthermore, diphoton limits are independent of\nthe decay of the second Higgs boson and thus apply even for degenerate masses\nin contrast to the CDF search. We also find that if the fermiophobic Higgs has\nvery enhanced couplings to photons, masses as large as $\\sim 150$ GeV can be\nruled out while if these couplings are somehow highly suppressed, masses below\n$\\sim 90$ GeV can still be ruled out. Finally, we show that $WW$ and $ZZ$\ndiboson searches may serve as complementary probes for masses above the\ndiphoton limit up to $\\sim 250$ GeV and discuss prospects at 13 TeV LHC.\n", "  The medium-long term frequency stability of the integrating sphere cold atom\nclock was improved.During the clock operation, Rb atoms were cooled and\nmanipulated using cooling light diffusely reflected by the inner surface of a\nmicrowave cavity in the clock. This light heated the cavity and caused a\nfrequency drift from the resonant frequency of the cavity. Power fluctuations\nof the cooling light led to atomic density variations in the cavity's central\narea, which increased the clock frequency instability through a cavity pulling\neffect. We overcame these limitations with appropriate solutions. A frequency\nstability of 3.5E-15 was achieved when the integrating time ? increased to 2E4\ns.\n", "  We study the hadroproduction of a $Wb$ pair in association with a light jet,\nfocusing on the dominant $t$-channel contribution and including exactly at the\nmatrix-element level all non-resonant and off-shell effects induced by the\nfinite top-quark width. Our simulations are accurate to the next-to-leading\norder in QCD, and are matched to the HERWIG6 and PYTHIA8 parton showers through\nthe MC@NLO method. We present phenomenological results relevant to the 8 TeV\nLHC, and carry out a thorough comparison to the case of on-shell $t$-channel\nsingle-top production. We formulate our approach so that it can be applied to\nthe general case of matrix elements that feature coloured intermediate\nresonances and are matched to parton showers.\n", "  For the laser wakefield acceleration, suppression of beam energy spread while\nkeeping sufficient charge is one of the key challenges. In order to achieve\nthis, we propose bichromatic laser ionization injection with combined laser\nwavelengths of $2.4\\rm \\mu m$ and $0.8\\rm \\mu m$ for wakefield excitation and\nfor triggering electron injection via field ionization, respectively. A laser\npulse at $2.4\\rm \\mu m$ wavelength enables one to drive an intense acceleration\nstructure with relatively low laser power. To further reduce the requirement of\nlaser power, we also propose to use carbon dioxide as the working gas medium,\nwhere carbon acts as the injection element. Our full three dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations show that electron beams at the GeV energy level\nwith both low energy spreads (around one percent) and high charges (several\ntens of picocoulomb) can be obtained by this scheme with laser parameters\nachievable in the near future.\n", "  A calculation of the Sommerfeld enhancement is presented and applied to the\nproblem of s-wave non-relativistic dark matter annihilation. The difference\nfrom previous computations in the literature is that the effect of the\nunderlying short-range scattering process is consistently included together\nwith the long-range force in the effective QM Schr\\\"odinger problem. Our\nprocedure satisfies partial-wave unitarity where previous calculations fail. We\nprovide analytic results for some potentials of phenomenological relevance.\n", "  We analyze experimentally and theoretically the spatio-temporal dynamics of a\nhighly multimode semiconductor laser with coherent optical injection. Due to\nthe particular geometry of the device (a 1~m long ring cavity), the multimode\ndynamics can be resolved in real time and we observe stable chiral solitons and\ndomain dynamics. The experiment is analyzed in the framework of a set of\neffective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations. We analyze the stability of\nstationary solutions and simulate both the complete model and a reduced rate\nequation model. This allows us to predict domain shrinking and the stability of\nonly one chiral charge that we ascribe to the finite active medium response\ntime.\n", "  The realization of a network of quantum registers is an outstanding challenge\nin quantum science and technology. We experimentally investigate a network node\nthat consists of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electronic spin\nhyperfine-coupled to nearby nuclear spins. We demonstrate individual control\nand readout of five nuclear spin qubits within one node. We then characterize\nthe storage of quantum superpositions in individual nuclear spins under\nrepeated application of a probabilistic optical inter-node entangling protocol.\nWe find that the storage fidelity is limited by dephasing during the electronic\nspin reset after failed attempts. By encoding quantum states into a\ndecoherence-protected subspace of two nuclear spins we show that quantum\ncoherence can be maintained for over 1000 repetitions of the remote entangling\nprotocol. These results and insights pave the way towards remote entanglement\npurification and the realisation of a quantum repeater using NV center quantum\nnetwork nodes.\n", "  At the LHC, the Littlest Higgs Model with $T$-parity is characterised by\nvarious production channels. If the $T$-odd quarks are heavier than the exotic\npartners of the $W$ and the $Z$, then associated production can be as important\nas the pair-production of the former. Studying both, we look for final states\ncomprising at least one lepton, jets and missing transverse energy. We consider\nall the SM processes that could conspire to contribute as background to our\nsignals, and perform a full detector level simulation of the signal and\nbackground to estimate the discovery potential at the current run as well as at\nthe scheduled upgrade of the LHC. We also show that, for one of the channels,\nthe reconstruction of two tagged $b$-jets at the Higgs mass $(M_h = 125~{\\rm\nGeV})$ provides us with an unambiguous hint for this model.\n", "  IIt is shown that the celebrated Heun operator $H_e=-(a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2\nx) \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + (b_0 x^2 + b_1 x + b_2)\\frac{d}{dx} + c_0 x$ is the\nHamiltonian of the $sl(2,R)$-quantum Euler-Arnold top of spin $\\nu$ in a\nconstant magnetic field. For $a_0 \\neq 0$ it is canonically-equivalent to\n$BC_1(A_1)-$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum models, if $a_0=0$, ten known\none-dimensional quasi-exactly-solvable problems are reproduced, and if, in\naddition, $b_0=c_0=0$, then four well-known one-dimensional quantal\nexactly-solvable problems are reproduced. If spin $\\nu$ of the top takes\n(half)-integer value the Hamiltonian possesses a finite-dimensional invariant\nsubspace and a number of polynomial eigenfunctions occurs. Discrete systems on\nuniform and exponential lattices are introduced which are\ncanonically-equivalent to one described by the Heun operator.\n", "  One interesting feature of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories is that\ngauge-invariant operators can decouple by strong-coupling effects, leading to\nemergent flavor symmetries in the IR. The details of such decoupling, however,\ndepends very delicately on the gauge group and matter content of the theory. We\nhere systematically study the IR behavior of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with $N_f$\nflavors, for gauge groups $\\mathrm{SU}(N_c), \\mathrm{USp}(2N_c)$ and\n$\\mathrm{SO}(N_c)$. We apply a combination of analytical and numerical methods,\nboth to small values of $N_c, N_f$ and also to the Veneziano limit, where $N_c$\nand $N_f$ are taken to be large with their ratio $N_f/N_c$ fixed. We highlight\nthe role of the monopole operators and the interplay with Aharony-type\ndualities. We also discuss the effect of gauging continuous as well as discrete\nflavor symmetries, and the implications of our analysis to the classification\nof $1/4$--BPS co-dimension 2 defects of 6d $(2,0)$ theories.\n", "  We fabricate a liquid-core liquid-clad microcavity that is coupled to a\nstandard tapered fiber, and then experimentally map the whispering-gallery\nmodes of this droplet resonator. The shape of our resonator is similar to a\nthin prolate spheroid, which makes space for many high-order transverse modes,\nsuggesting that some of them will share the same resonance frequency. Indeed,\nwe experimentally observe that more than half of the droplet's modes have a\nsibling having the same frequency (to within linewidth) and therefore\nexhibiting a standing interference-pattern.\n", "  Majorana fermion (MF) whose antiparticle is itself has been predicted in\ncondensed matter systems. Signatures of the MFs have been reported as zero\nenergy modes in various systems. More definitive evidences are highly desired\nto verify the existence of the MF. Very recently, theory has predicted MFs to\ninduce spin selective Andreev reflection (SSAR), a novel magnetic property\nwhich can be used to detect the MFs. Here we report the first observation of\nthe SSAR from MFs inside vortices in Bi2Te3/NbSe2 hetero-structure, in which\ntopological superconductivity was previously established. By using\nspin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we show\nthat the zero-bias peak of the tunneling differential conductance at the vortex\ncenter is substantially higher when the tip polarization and the external\nmagnetic field are parallel than anti-parallel to each other. Such strong spin\ndependence of the tunneling is absent away from the vortex center, or in a\nconventional superconductor. The observed spin dependent tunneling effect is a\ndirect evidence for the SSAR from MFs, fully consistent with theoretical\nanalyses. Our work provides definitive evidences of MFs and will stimulate the\nMFs research on their novel physical properties, hence a step towards their\nstatistics and application in quantum computing.\n", "  We investigate the geodesics of a Schwarzschild spacetime embedded in an\nisotropic expanding cosmological background (McVittie metric). We focus on\nbound particle geodesics in a background including matter and phantom dark\nenergy with constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w<-1$ involving a\nfuture Big Rip singularity at a time $t_{\\ast}$. Such geodesics have been\npreviously studied in the Newtonian approximation and found to lead to\ndissociation of bound systems at a time $t_{rip}<t_{\\ast}$ which for fixed\nbackground $w$, depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\\bar{\\omega}_0$\nrelated to the angular momentum and depending on the mass and the size of the\nbound system. We extend this analysis to large massive bound systems where the\nNewtonian approximation is not appropriate and we compare the derived\ndissociation time with the corresponding time in the context of the Newtonian\napproximation. By identifying the time when the effective potential minimum\ndisappears due to the repulsive force of dark energy we find that the\ndissociation time of bound systems occurs earlier than the prediction of the\nNewtonian approximation. However, the effect is negligible for all existing\ncosmological bound systems and it would become important only in hypothetical\nbound extremely massive ($10^{20} M_\\odot$) and large ($100Mpc$) bound systems.\nWe verify this result by explicit solution of the geodesic equations. This\nresult is due to an interplay between the repulsive phantom dark energy effects\nand the existence of the well known innermost stable orbits of Schwarzschild\nspacetimes.\n", "  We explain the concept of superadiabatic approximations and show how in the\ncontext of the Born- Oppenheimer approximation they lead to an explicit formula\nthat can be used to predict transitions at avoided crossings. Based on this\nformula, we present a simple method for computing wave packet dynamics across\navoided crossings. Only knowledge of the adiabatic electronic energy levels\nnear the avoided crossing is required for the computation. In particular, this\nmeans that no diabatization procedure is necessary, the adiabatic energy levels\ncan be computed on the fly, and they only need to be computed to higher\naccuracy when an avoided crossing is detected. We test the quality of our\nmethod on the paradigmatic example of photo-dissociation of NaI, finding very\ngood agreement with results of exact wave packet calculations.\n", "  Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance make it possible to perform\nquantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of\nrealistic devices. An important question is to find the noise rate at which\nerrors can be arbitrarily suppressed. By concatenating the 7-qubit Steane and\n15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of\nfault-tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal. Importantly,\nthe CNOT gate remains transversal in both codes, and as such has increased\nerror protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates. We show that\nwhile the level-1 pseudo-threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by\nthe logical Hadamard, the error suppression of the logical CNOT gates allows\nfor the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher\nlevels. We establish a lower bound of $1.28~\\times~10^{-3}$ for the asymptotic\nthreshold of this code which is competitive with known concatenated models and\ndoes not rely on ancillary magic state preparation for universal computation.\n", "  We review the imaginary time path integral approach to the quench dynamics of\nconformal field theories. We show how this technique can be applied to the\ndetermination of the time dependence of correlation functions and entanglement\nentropy for both global and local quenches. We also briefly review other quench\nprotocols. We carefully discuss the limits of applicability of these results to\nrealistic models of condensed matter and cold atoms.\n", "  Using a polaron master equation approach we investigate the resonance\nfluorescence spectra from coherently driven quantum dots (QDs) coupled to an\nacoustic phonon bath and a photonic crystal waveguide with a rich local density\nof photon states (LDOS). Resonance fluorescence spectra from QDs in\nsemiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures of electron-phonon\ninteractions, but when coupled to a structured photonic reservoir, the QD\nemission properties are also determined by the frequency dependence of the LDOS\nof the photon reservoir. Here, we investigate the simultaneous role of coupled\nphoton and phonon baths on the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a\nstrongly driven QD. As an example structured photonic reservoir, we first study\na photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguide, and find that photons and phonons\nhave counter-interacting effects near the upper mode-edge of the coupled-cavity\nwaveguide, thus establishing the importance of their separate roles in\ndetermining the emission spectra. The general theory is developed for arbitrary\nphotonic reservoirs and is further applied to determine resonance the\nfluorescence spectra from a realistic, disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide\nshowing important photon-phonon interaction effects that are directly relevant\nto emerging experiments and theoretical proposals.\n", "  We find a sufficient condition to imprint the single-mode bosonic phase-space\nnonclassicality onto a bipartite state as modal entanglement and vice versa\nusing an arbitrary beam splitter. Surprisingly, the entanglement produced or\ndetected in this way depends only on the nonclassicality of the marginal input\nor output states, regardless of their purity and separability. In this way, our\nresult provides a sufficient condition for generating entangled states of\narbitrary high temperature and arbitrary large number of particles. We also\nstudy the evolution of the entanglement within a lossy Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer and show that unless both modes are totally lost, the\nentanglement does not diminish.\n", "  The authors of a recent paper (PRA \\textbf{87}, 013613 (2013)) argued that in\nfermionic systems with d-wave pairing the speed of sound is nonanalytic across\nthe BCS-BEC crossover at the point where the chemical potential vanishes,\nregardless of the specific details of the interaction potential. On the\ncontrary, the numerical results reported here suggest that the speed of sound\nacross the BCS-BEC evolution of atomic Fermi gases with s- and d-wave pairings\nin two-dimensional square lattices is a smooth analytic function at the\nvanishing chemical potential.\n", "  Several recent experiments on three-dimensional topological insulators claim\nto observe a large charge current-induced non-equilibrium ensemble spin\npolarization of electrons in the helical surface state. We present a\ncomprehensive criticism of such claims, using both theory and experiment:\nFirst, we clarify the interpretation of quantities extracted from these\nmeasurements by deriving standard expressions from a Boltzmann transport\nequation approach in the relaxation-time approximation at zero and finite\ntemperature to emphasize our assertion that, despite high in-plane spin\nprojection, obtainable current-induced ensemble spin polarization is minuscule.\nSecond, we use a simple experiment to demonstrate that magnetic field-dependent\nopen-circuit voltage hysteresis (identical to those attributed to\ncurrent-induced spin polarization in topological insulator surface states) can\nbe generated in analogous devices where current is driven through thin films of\na topologically-trivial metal. This result *ipso facto* discredits the naive\ninterpretation of previous experiments with TIs, which were used to claim\nobservation of helicity, i.e. spin-momentum locking in the\ntopologically-protected surface state.\n", "  Exchange interactions between isolated pairs of spin centers in diamond have\nbeen calculated, based on an accurate atomistic electronic structure for\ndiamond and any impurity atoms, for spin-center separations up to 2~nm. The\nexchange interactions exceed dipolar interactions for spin center separations\nless than 3~nm. NV$^-$ spin centers, which are extended defects, interact very\ndifferently depending on the relative orientations of the symmetry axis of the\nspin center and the radius vector connecting the pair. Exchange interactions\nbetween transition-metal dopants behave similarly to those of NV$^-$ centers.\nThe Mn\\---Mn exchange interaction decays with a much longer length scale than\nthe Cr\\---Cr and Ni\\---Ni exchange interactions, exceeding dipolar interactions\nfor Mn\\---Mn separations less than 5~nm. Calculations of these highly\nanisotropic and spin-center-dependent interactions provide the potential for\ndesign of the spin-spin interactions for novel nanomagnetic structures.\n", "  The elastoresistivity tensor $m_{ij,kl}$ relates changes in resistivity to\nstrains experienced by a material. As a fourth-rank tensor, it contains\nconsiderably more information about the material than the simpler (second-rank)\nresistivity tensor; in particular, for a tetragonal material, the $B_{1g}$ and\n$B_{2g}$ components of the elastoresistivity tensor ($m_{xx,xx}-m_{xx,yy}$ and\n$2m_{xy,xy}$, respectively) can be related to its nematic susceptibility.\nPrevious experimental probes of this quantity have focused exclusively on\ndifferential longitudinal elastoresistance measurements, which determine the\ninduced resistivity anisotropy arising from anisotropic in-plane strain based\non the difference of two longitudinal resistivity measurements. Here we\ndescribe a complementary technique based on \\textit{transverse}\nelastoresistance measurements. This new approach is advantageous because it\ndirectly determines the strain-induced resistivity anisotropy from a single\ntransverse measurement. To demonstrate the efficacy of this new experimental\nprotocol, we present transverse elastoresistance measurements of the\n$2m_{xy,xy}$ elastoresistivity coefficient of BaFe$_2$As$_2$, a representative\niron-pnictide that has previously been characterized via differential\nlongitudinal elastoresistance measurements.\n", "  We study properties of the single-site reduced density matrix in the\nBose-Bose resonance model as a function of system parameters. This model\ndescribes a single-component Bose gas with a resonant coupling to a diatomic\nmolecular state, here defined on a lattice. A main goal is to demonstrate that\nthe eigenstates of the single-site reduced density matrix have structures that\nare characteristic for the various quantum phases of this system. Since the\nHamiltonian conserves only the global particle number but not the number of\nbosons and molecules individually, these eigenstates, referred to as optimal\nmodes, can be nontrivial linear combinations of bare eigenstates of the\nmolecular and boson particle number. We numerically analyze the optimal modes\nand their weights, the latter giving the importance of the corresponding state,\nin the ground state of the Bose-Bose resonance model. We find that the\nsingle-site von Neumann entropy is sensitive to the location of the phase\nboundaries. We explain the structure of the optimal modes and their weight\nspectra using perturbation theory and via a comparison to results for the\nsingle-component Bose-Hubbard model. We further study the dynamical evolution\nof the optimal modes and of the single-site entanglement entropy in two quantum\nquenches that cross phase boundaries of the model and show that these\nquantities are thermal in the steady state. For our numerical calculations, we\nuse the density matrix renormalization group method for ground-state\ncalculations and time evolution in a Krylov subspace for the quench dynamics as\nwell as exact diagonalization.\n", "  We study the nonlinear responses of relativistic chiral matter to the\nexternal fields, such as the electric field ${\\bf E}$, gradients of temperature\nand chemical potential, ${\\bf \\nabla} T$ and ${\\bf \\nabla} \\mu$. Using the\nkinetic theory with Berry curvature corrections under the relaxation time\napproximation, we compute the transport coefficients of possible new electric\ncurrents that are forbidden in usual chirally symmetric matter, but are allowed\nin chirally asymmetric matter by parity. In particular, we find a new type of\nelectric current proportional to ${\\bf \\nabla} \\mu \\times {\\bf E}$ due to the\ninterplay between the effects of the Berry curvature and collisions. We also\nderive an analogue of the \"Wiedemann-Franz\" law specific for anomalous\nnonlinear transport in relativistic chiral matter.\n", "  Food webs -- networks of predators and prey -- have long been known to\nexhibit \"intervality\": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in\nsuch a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact\nintervals. Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a \"niche\"\ndimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the\nhighly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic\nnetwork modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value\nby hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the\ncause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of\n$46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\\it predator}\nintervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous\nas the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not\nexclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites,\ncellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as\ninterval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web\nassembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate\nsignificant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for\nfood-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental\nstructural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach\nto food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem\nassembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features\nthought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex\nnetworks.\n", "  We report on the direct measurements of fluid flow vorticity using a\nspatially shaped beam with a superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian modes that\nreports on the rotational Doppler shift from microparticles intersecting the\nbeam focus. Experiments are carried out on fluid flows with well-characterized\nvorticity and the experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement\nwith the expected values even for 200 ms integration times. This method allows\nfor localized real-time determination of vorticity in a fluid flow.\n", "  Rotated graphene bilayers form an exotic class of nanomaterials with\nfascinating electronic properties governed by the rotation angle theta. For\nlarge rotation angles, the electron eigenstates are restricted to one layer and\nthe bilayer behaves like two decoupled graphene layer. At intermediate angles,\nDirac cones are preserved but with a lower velocity and van Hove singularities\nare induced at energies where the two Dirac cones intersect. At very small\nangles, eigenstates become localized in peculiar moire zones. We analyse here\nthe effect of an asymmetric doping for a series of commensurate rotated\nbilayers on the basis of tight binding calculations of their band dispersions,\ndensity of states, participation ratio and diffusive properties. While a small\ndoping level preserves the theta dependence of the rotated bilayer electronic\nstructure, larger doping induces a further reduction of the band velocity in\nthe same way of to a further reduction of the rotation angle.\n", "  The regions of existence and stability of dark solitons in the\nLugiato-Lefever model with normal chromatic dispersion are described. These\nlocalized states are shown to be organized in a bifurcation structure known as\ncollapsed snaking implying the presence of a region in parameter space with a\nfinite multiplicity of dark solitons. For some parameter values dynamical\ninstabilities are responsible for the appearance of oscillations and temporal\nchaos. The importance of the results for understanding frequency comb\ngeneration in microresonators is emphasized.\n", "  The ratio of the Zeeman splitting to the cyclotron energy ($M=\\Delta E_Z /\n\\hbar \\omega_c$), which characterizes the relative strength of the spin-orbit\ninteraction in crystals, is examined for the narrow gap IV-VI semiconductors\nPbTe, SnTe, and their alloy Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te on the basis of the multiband\n$k\\cdot p$ theory. The inverse mass $\\alpha$, the g-factor $g$, and $M$ are\ncalculated numerically by employing the relativistic empirical tight-binding\nband calculation. On the other hand, a simple but exact formula of $M$ is\nobtained for the six-band model based on the group theoretical analysis. It is\nshown that $M<1$ for PbTe and $M>1$ for SnTe, which are interpreted in terms of\nthe relevance of the interband couplings due to the crystalline spin-orbit\ninteraction. It is clarified both analytically and numerically that $M=1$ just\nat the band inversion point, where the transition from trivial to nontrivial\ntopological crystalline insulator occurs. By using this property, one can\ndetect the transition point only with the bulk measurements. It is also\nproposed that $M$ is useful to evaluate quantitatively a degree of the Dirac\nelectrons in solids.\n", "  The spatial confinement and the propagation length of surface waves in a\nsingle-layer two-dimensional atomic crystal are analysed in term of its surface\nsusceptibility and its surface conductivity. Based on the values of these\nmacroscopic parameters, extracted from experimental observations, it is\nconfirmed that graphene supports a transverse magnetic non-radiating surface\nmode in the ultraviolet spectral region while a single-layer hexagonal\nBoron-Nitride is predicted to support a transverse electric non-radiating\nsurface mode in the visible spectrum. This last mode, at a vacuum wavelength of\n633 nm, has a spatial confinement of 15 microns and an intensity-propagation\ndistance greater than 2 cm.\n", "  Recently it was demonstrated that Sr intercalation provides a new route to\ninduce superconductivity in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Topological\nsuperconductors are predicted to be unconventional, with mixed even and odd\nparity Cooper pairs states. An adequate probe to test for unconventional\nsuperconductivity is the upper critical field, $B_{c2}$. For a standard BCS\nlayered superconductor $B_{c2}$ shows an anisotropy when the magnetic field is\napplied parallel and perpendicular to the layers, but is isotropic when the\nfield is rotated in the plane of the layers. Here we report measurements of the\nupper critical field of superconducting Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals ($T_c =\n3.0$~K). Surprisingly, field-angle dependent magnetotransport measurements\nreveal a large anisotropy of $B_{c2}$ when the magnet field is rotated in the\nbasal plane. The large two-fold anisotropy, while six-fold is anticipated,\ncannot be explained with the Ginzburg-Landau anisotropic effective mass model\nor flux flow induced by the Lorentz force. The rotational symmetry breaking of\n$B_{c2}$ indicates unconventional superconductivity with an odd-parity\npolarized triplet Cooper pair state ($\\Delta_4$-pairing) recently proposed for\nrhombohedral topological superconductors, or might have a structural nature,\nsuch as self-organized stripe ordering of Sr atoms.\n", "  We revisit the subject of holographic renormalization for asymptotically AdS\nspacetimes. For many applications of holography, one has to handle the\ndivergences associated with the on-shell gravitational action. The brute force\napproach uses the Fefferman-Graham (FG) expansion near the AdS boundary to\nidentify the divergences, but subsequent reversal of the expansion is needed to\nconstruct the infinite counterterms. While in principle straightforward, the\nmethod is cumbersome and application/reversal of FG is formally unsatisfactory.\nVarious authors have proposed an alternative method based on the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation. However, this approach may appear to be abstract,\ndifficult to implement, and in some cases limited in applicability. In this\npaper, we clarify the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of holographic\nrenormalization and present a simple algorithm for its implementation to\nextract cleanly the infinite counterterms. While the derivation of the method\nrelies on the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the actual\napplication of our algorithm does not. The work applies to any $D$-dimensional\nholographic dual with asymptotic AdS boundary, Euclidean or Lorentzian, and\narbitrary slicing. We illustrate the method in several examples, including the\nFGPW model, a holographic model of 3d ABJM theory, and cases with marginal\nscalars such as a dilaton-axion system.\n", "  We studied optical response of microcavity non-equilibrium exciton-polariton\nBose-Einstein condensate with saturable nonlinearity under simultaneous\nresonant and non-resonant pumping. We demonstrated the emergence of\nmultistabile behavior due to the satutration of the excitonic absorbtion.\nStable periodic Rabi- type oscillations of the excitonic and photonic\ncondensate components in the regime of the stationary pump and their transition\nto the chaotic dynamics through the cascade of Hopf bifurcations by tuning of\nthe electrical pump are revealed.\n", "  The concept of flat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated\nmany-body physics. However, the demonstration of the flat band physics is\nhighly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations in conventional condensed matter\nmaterials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator of the\n2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a flat middle band. By exploiting the simple\nparametric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with \\textit{in\nsitu} tunable hopping strengths in a 2D array of coupled superconducting\ntransmissionline resonators. Moreover, the flexibility of our proposal enables\nthe immediate incorporation of both the artificial gauge field and the strong\nphoton-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously\ndemonstrate the synthesized flat band, we further investigate the observation\nof the flat band localization of microwave photons through the pumping and the\nsteady-state measurements of only few sites on the lattice. Requiring only\ncurrent level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic\ncircuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new\nway towards the future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall fluids\nincluding anomalous quantum Hall effect and bosonic fractional quantum Hall\nstates without magnetic fields.\n", "  We shall introduce the principal symbol for Euler-Lagrange operators and use\nthem to charac- terise well-posed initial value problems. We shall clarify how\nconstraints can arise in Lagrangian covariant theories by extending the\nstandard treatment in GR. Finally, we sketch a quantization procedure based on\nwhat done in LQG.\n", "  We have given a summary on our theoretical predictions of three kinds of\ntopological semimetals (TSMs), namely, Dirac semimetal (DSM), Weyl semimetal\n(WSM) and Node-Line Semimetal (NLSM). TSMs are new states of quantum matters,\nwhich are different with topological insulators. They are characterized by the\ntopological stability of Fermi surface, whether it encloses band crossing\npoint, i.e., Dirac cone like energy node, or not. They are distinguished from\neach other by the degeneracy and momentum space distribution of the nodal\npoints. To realize these intriguing topological quantum states is quite\nchallenging and crucial to both fundamental science and future application. In\n2012 and 2013, Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$ were theoretically predicted to be\nDSM, respectively. Their experimental verifications in 2014 have ignited the\nhot and intensive studies on TSMs. The following theoretical prediction of\nnonmagnetic WSM in TaAs family stimulated a second wave and many experimental\nworks have come out in this year. In 2014, a kind of three dimensional crystal\nof carbon has been proposed to be NLSM due to negligible spin-orbit coupling\nand coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetry. Though the final\nexperimental confirmation of NLSM is still missing, there have been several\ntheoretical proposals, including Cu$_3$PdN from us. In the final part, we have\nsummarized the whole family of TSMs and their relationship.\n", "  We study the 2010 specific version of the 2002 proposed $U(1)_X$ extension of\nthe supersymmetric standard model, which has no $\\mu$ term and conserves baryon\nnumber and lepton number separately and automatically. We consider in detail\nthe scalar sector as well as the extra $Z_X$ gauge boson, and their\ninteractions with the necessary extra color-triplet particles of this model,\nwhich behave as leptoquarks. We show how the diphoton excess at 750 GeV,\nrecently observed at the LHC, may be explained within this context. We identify\na new fermion dark-matter candidate and discuss its properties. An important\nbyproduct of this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric constraints\non the Higgs boson's mass of 125 GeV.\n", "  We present improvements in both theoretical understanding and experimental\nimplementation of the cross resonance (CR) gate that have led to shorter\ntwo-qubit gate times and interleaved randomized benchmarking fidelities\nexceeding 99%. The CR gate is an all-microwave two-qubit gate offers that does\nnot require tunability and is therefore well suited to quantum computing\narchitectures based on 2D superconducting qubits. The performance of the gate\nhas previously been hindered by long gate times and fidelities averaging\n94-96%. We have developed a calibration procedure that accurately measures the\nfull CR Hamiltonian. The resulting measurements agree with theoretical analysis\nof the gate and also elucidate the error terms that have previously limited the\ngate fidelity. The increase in fidelity that we have achieved was accomplished\nby introducing a second microwave drive tone on the target qubit to cancel\nunwanted components of the CR Hamiltonian.\n", "  Horndeski's theory of gravity is the most general scalar-tensor theory with a\nsingle scalar whose equations of motion contain at most second-order\nderivatives. A subsector of Horndeski's theory known as \"Fab Four\" gravity\nallows for dynamical self-tuning of the quantum vacuum energy, and therefore it\nhas received particular attention in cosmology as a possible alternative to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. Here we study compact stars in Fab Four gravity, which\nincludes as special cases general relativity (\"George\"),\nEinstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (\"Ringo\"), theories with a nonminimal\ncoupling with the Einstein tensor (\"John\") and theories involving the\ndouble-dual of the Riemann tensor (\"Paul\"). We generalize and extend previous\nresults in theories of the John class and were not able to find realistic\ncompact stars in theories involving the Paul class.\n", "  We determine (p,q)-string and (p,q)-five brane solutions of type IIB\nsupergravity using SL(2,Z)-symmetry of the full type IIB superstring theory. We\nalso determine SL(2,Z)-transformed solution corresponding to the bound state of\nNS5-branes and fundamental strings. Then we analyze its near horizon limit and\nwe show that it leads to the AdS(3)xS(3) with mixed fluxes.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that the well established $\\Lambda_c(2595)$\nresonance contains a large meson-baryon component, which can vary depending on\nthe specific formalism. In this work, we examine such a picture by utilizing\nthe compositeness condition and the large number of colors ($N_c$) expansion.\nWe examine three different models fulfilling two body unitarity in\ncoupled-channels, and adopting renormalization schemes where the mass of the\n$\\Lambda_c(2595)$ resonance is well described, but not necessarily its width,\nsince we do not consider three body channels and work at the isospin symmetric\nlimit. Both approximations might have an effect larger on the width than on the\nmass. In this context, our studies show that the compositeness of the\n$\\Lambda_c(2595)$ depends on the number of considered coupled channels, and on\nthe particular regularization scheme adopted in the unitary approaches and,\ntherefore, is model dependent. In addition, we perform an exploratory study of\nthe $\\Lambda_c(2595)$ in the large $N_c$ expansion, within a scheme involving\nonly the $\\pi\\Sigma_c$ and $K\\Xi'_c$ channels, whose dynamics is mostly fixed\nby chiral symmetry. In this context and formulating the leading-order\ninteraction as a function of $N_c$, we show that for moderate $N_c> 3$ values,\nthe mass and width of the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$ deviate from those of a genuine\n$qqq$ baryon, implying the relevance of meson-baryon components in its wave\nfunction. Furthermore, we study the properties of the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$, in the\nstrict $N_c \\to \\infty $ limit, using an extension of the chiral\nWeinberg-Tomozawa interaction to an arbitrary number of flavors and colors.\nThis latter study hints at the possible existence of a (perhaps) sub-dominant\n$qqq$ component in the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$ resonance wave function, which would\nbecome dominant when the number of colors gets sufficiently large.\n", "  We present a description of the production of a di-lepton pair (through Z\nboson and virtual photon) in association with at least two jets. This\ncalculation adds to the fixed-order accuracy the dominant logarithms in the\nlimit of large partonic centre-of-mass energy to all orders in the strong\ncoupling. This is achieved within the framework of High Energy Jets. This\ncalculation is made possible by extending the high energy treatment to take\ninto account the multiple t-channel exchanges arising from Z and\ngamma*-emissions off several quark lines. The correct description of the\ninterference effects from the various t-channel exchanges requires an extension\nof the subtraction terms in the all-order calculation. We describe this\nconstruction and compare the resulting predictions to a number of recent\nanalyses of LHC data. The description of a wide range of observables is good,\nand, as expected, stands out from other approaches in particular in the regions\nof large dijet invariant mass and large dijet rapidity spans.\n", "  Signals of QCD instanton-induced processes are searched for in neutral\ncurrent deep-inelastic scattering at the electron-proton collider HERA in the\nkinematic region defined by the Bjorken-scaling variable $x > 10^{-3}$, the\ninelasticity $0.2< y < 0.7$ and the photon virtuality $150 < Q^2 < 15000$\nGeV$^2$. The search is performed using H1 data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of ~$351$ pb$^{-1}$. No evidence for the production of QCD\ninstanton-induced events is observed. Upper limits on the cross section for\ninstanton-induced processes between $1.5$~pb and $6$~pb, at $95\\%$~ confidence\nlevel, are obtained depending on the kinematic domain in which instantons could\nbe produced. Compared to earlier publications, the limits are improved by an\norder of magnitude and for the first time are challenging theory predictions.\n", "  In the context of the minimal SO(5) linear {\\sigma}-model, a complete\nrenormalizable Lagrangian -including gauge bosons and fermions- is considered,\nwith the symmetry softly broken to SO(4). The scalar sector describes both the\nelectroweak Higgs doublet and the singlet {\\sigma}. Varying the {\\sigma} mass\nwould allow to sweep from the regime of perturbative ultraviolet completion to\nthe non-linear one assumed in models in which the Higgs particle is a\nlow-energy remnant of some strong dynamics. We analyze the phenomenological\nimplications and constraints from precision observables and LHC data.\nFurthermore, we derive the d <= 6 effective Lagrangian in the limit of heavy\nexotic fermions.\n", "  We study the backreaction of smeared and localised anti M2-branes placed at\nthe tip of the CGLP background. To this end we derive a Smarr relation for\nbackreacted antibranes at zero and finite temperature. For extremal antibranes\nwe show that if smeared they cannot have regular horizons, whereas localised\nM2-branes can potentially be regular when polarised into M5-branes, in\nagreement with the probe result of Klebanov and Pufu. We further discuss\nantibranes at finite temperature and argue that localised antibrane solutions\nwith regular horizons are not excluded.\n", "  Advances in our understanding of perturbation theory suggest the existence of\na correspondence between classical general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. A\nconcrete example of this correspondence, which is known as the double copy, was\nrecently introduced for the case of stationary Kerr-Schild spacetimes. Building\non this foundation, we examine the simple time-dependent case of an\naccelerating, radiating point source. The gravitational solution, which\ngeneralises the Schwarzschild solution, includes a non-trivial stress-energy\ntensor. This stress-energy tensor corresponds to a gauge theoretic current in\nthe double copy. We interpret both of these sources as representing the\nradiative part of the field. Furthermore, in the simple example of\nBremsstrahlung, we determine a scattering amplitude describing the radiation,\nmaintaining the double copy throughout. Our results provide the strongest\nevidence yet that the classical double copy is directly related to the BCJ\ndouble copy for scattering amplitudes.\n", "  We recall and update, both theoretically and phenomenologically, our (nearly)\nforty-years-old proposal of a string-junction as a necessary complement to the\nconventional classification of hadrons based just on their quark-antiquark\nconstituents. In that proposal single (though in general metastable) hadronic\nstates are associated with \"irreducible\" gauge-invariant operators consisting\nof Wilson lines (visualized as strings of color flux tubes) that may either end\non a quark or an antiquark, or annihilate in triplets at a junction $J$ or an\nanti-junction $\\bar{J}$. For the junction-free sector (ordinary $q\\, \\bar{q}$\nmesons and glueballs) the picture is supported by large-$N$ (number of colors)\nconsiderations as well as by a lattice strong-coupling expansion. Both imply\nthe famous OZI rule suppressing quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams. For\nhadrons with $J$ and/or $\\bar{J}$ constituents the same expansions support our\nproposal, including its generalization of the OZI rule to the suppression of\n$J-\\bar{J}$ annihilation diagrams. Such a rule implies that hadrons with\njunctions are \"mesophobic\" and thus unusually narrow if they are below\nthreshold for decaying into as many baryons as their total number of junctions\n(two for a tetraquark, three for a pentaquark). Experimental support for our\nclaim, based on the observation that narrow multiquark states typically lie\nbelow (well above) the relevant baryonic (mesonic) thresholds, will be\npresented.\n", "  Detecting transient light curves (e.g., transiting planets) requires high\nprecision data, and thus it is important to effectively filter systematic\ntrends affecting ground based wide field surveys. We apply an implementation of\nthe Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) (Kovacs et al. 2005) to the 2MASS\ncalibration catalog and select Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) photometric time\nseries data. TFA is successful at reducing the overall dispersion of light\ncurves, however it may over filter intrinsic variables and increase\n\"instantaneous\" dispersion when a template set is not judiciously chosen. In an\nattempt to rectify these issues we modify the original literature TFA by\nincluding measurement uncertainties in its computation, including ancillary\ndata correlated with noise, and algorithmically selecting a template set using\nclustering algorithms as suggested by various authors. This approach may be\nparticularly useful for appropriately accounting for variable photometric\nprecision surveys and/or combined data-sets. In summary, our contributions are\nto provide a MATLAB software implementation of TFA and a number of\nmodifications tested on synthetics and real data, summarize the performance of\nTFA and various modifications on real ground based data sets (2MASS and PTF),\nand assess the efficacy of TFA and modifications using synthetic light curve\ntests consisting of transiting and sinusoidal variables. While the transiting\nvariables test indicates that these modifications confer no advantage to\ntransit detection, the sinusoidal variables test indicates potential\nimprovements in detection accuracy.\n", "  We study a locally resonant granular material in the form of a precompressed\nHertzian chain with linear internal resonators. Using an asymptotic reduction,\nwe derive an effective nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) modulation equation. This,\nin turn, leads us to provide analytical evidence, subsequently corroborated\nnumerically, for the existence of two distinct types of discrete breathers\nrelated to acoustic or optical modes: (a) traveling bright breathers with a\nstrain profile exponentially vanishing at infinity and (b) stationary and\ntraveling dark breathers, exponentially localized, time-periodic states mounted\non top of a non-vanishing background. The stability and bifurcation structure\nof numerically computed exact stationary dark breathers is also examined.\nStationary bright breathers cannot be identified using the NLS equation, which\nis defocusing at the upper edges of the phonon bands and becomes linear at the\nlower edge of the optical band.\n", "  We study the event-by-event generation of flow vorticity in RHIC Au + Au\ncollisions and LHC Pb + Pb collisions by using the HIJING model. Different\ndefinitions of the vorticity field and velocity field are considered. A variety\nof properties of the vorticity are explored, including the impact parameter\ndependence, the collision energy dependence, the spatial distribution, the\nevent-by-event fluctuation of the magnitude and azimuthal direction, and the\ntime evolution. In addition, the spatial distribution of the flow helicity is\nalso studied.\n", "  We reformulate the Matrix theory of D-particles in a manifestly\nLorentz-covariant fashion in the sense of 11 dimesnional flat Minkowski\nspace-time, from the viewpoint of the so-called DLCQ interpretation of the\nlight-front Matrix theory. The theory is characterized by various symmetry\nproperties including higher gauge symmetries, which contain the usual SU($N$)\nsymmetry as a special case and are extended from the structure naturally\nappearing in association with a discretized version of Nambu's 3-bracket. The\ntheory is scale invariant, and the emergence of the 11 dimensional\ngravitational length, or M-theory scale, is interpreted as a consequence of a\nbreaking of the scaling symmetry through a super-selection rule. In the\nlight-front gauge with the DLCQ compactification of 11 dimensions, the theory\nreduces to the usual light-front formulation. In the time-like gauge with the\nordinary M-theory spatial compactification, it reduces to a non-Abelian\nBorn-Infeld-like theory, which in the limit of large $N$ becomes equivalent\nwith the original BFSS theory.\n", "  We investigate the charge excitations of a Weyl semimetal in the axionic\ncharge density wave (axionic CDW) state. While it has been shown that the\ntopological response (anomalous Hall conductivity) is protected against the CDW\nstate, we find that the long wavelength plasmon excitation is radically\ninfluenced by the dynamics of the CDW order parameter. In the normal state, we\nshow that an undamped collective mode should exist at q~Q_(CDW) if there is an\nattractive interaction favoring the formation of the CDW state. The undamped\nnature of this collective mode is attributed to a gap-like feature in the\nparticle-hole continuum at q~Q_(CDW) due to the chirality of the Weyl nodes,\nwhich is not seen in other materials with CDW instability. In the CDW state,\nthe long wavelength plasmon excitations become more dispersive due to the\nadditional interband scattering not allowed in the normal state. Moreover,\nbecause the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken, Umklapp scattering,\nthe process conserving the total momentum only up to nQ_(CDW) with n an integer\nand Q_(CDW) the ordering wave vector, emerges in the CDW state. We find that\nthe plasmon excitation couples to the phonon mode of the CDW order via the\nUmklapp scattering, leading to two branches of resonant collective modes\nobservable in the density-density correlation function at q~0 and q~Q_(CDW).\nBased on our analysis, we propose that measuring these resonant plasmon-axion\nexcitations around q~0 and q~Q_(CDW) by the momentum-resolved electron energy\nloss spectroscopy (M-EELS) could serve as a reliable way to detect the axionic\nCDW state in Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Transcription is a key process in gene expression, in which RNA polymerases\nproduce a complementary RNA copy from a DNA template. RNA polymerization is\nfrequently interrupted by backtracking, a process in which polymerases perform\na random walk along the DNA template. Recovery of polymerases from the\ntranscriptionally-inactive backtracked state is determined by a kinetic\ncompetition between 1D diffusion and RNA cleavage. Here we describe backtrack\nrecovery as a continuous-time random walk, where the time for a polymerase to\nrecover from a backtrack of a given depth is described as a first-passage time\nof a random walker to reach an absorbing state. We represent RNA cleavage as a\nstochastic resetting process, and derive exact expressions for the recovery\ntime distributions and mean recovery times from a given initial backtrack depth\nfor both continuous and discrete-lattice descriptions of the random walk. We\nshow that recovery time statistics do not depend on the discreteness of the DNA\nlattice when the rate of 1D diffusion is large compared to the rate of\ncleavage.\n", "  We give a short proof of a recent inequality of Audenaert, Datta and Ozols,\nand determine cases of equality.\n", "  Accretion shocks around galaxy clusters mark the position where the infalling\ndiffuse gas is significantly slowed down, heated up, and becomes a part of the\nintracluster medium (ICM). They play an important role in setting the ICM\nproperties. Hydrodynamical simulations have found an intriguing result that the\nradial position of this accretion shock tracks closely the position of the\n`splashback radius' of the dark matter, despite the very different physical\nprocesses that gas and dark matter experience. Using the self-similar spherical\ncollapse model for dark matter and gas, we find that an alignment between the\ntwo radii happens only for a gas with an adiabatic index of $\\gamma \\approx\n5/3$ and for clusters with moderate mass accretion rates. In addition, we find\nthat some observed ICM properties, such as the entropy slope and the effective\npolytropic index lying around $\\sim 1.1-1.2$, are captured by the self-similar\nspherical collapse model, and are insensitive to the mass accretion history.\n", "  We investigate the origin of a resonant period drop of a torsional oscillator\n(TO) containing solid ${}^{4}$He by inspecting its relation to a change in\nelastic modulus. To understand this relationship directly, we measure both\nphenomena simultaneously using a TO with a pair of concentric piezoelectric\ntransducers inserted in its annulus. Although the temperature, ${}^{3}$He\nconcentration, and frequency dependence are essentially the same, a marked\ndiscrepancy in the drive amplitude dependence is observed. We find that this\ndiscrepancy originates from the anisotropic response of polycrystalline solid\n${}^{4}$He connected with low-angle grain boundaries by studying the shear\nmodulus parallel to and perpendicular to the driving direction.\n", "  The extraction of hadron-hadron scattering parameters from lattice data by\nusing the L\\\"uscher approach becomes increasingly complicated in the presence\nof inelastic channels. We propose a method for the direct extraction of the\ncomplex hadron-hadron optical potential on the lattice, which does not require\nthe use of the multi-channel L\\\"uscher formalism. Moreover, this method is\napplicable without modifications if some inelastic channels contain three or\nmore particles.\n", "  We describe a method, that we call data projection onto parameter space\n(DPPS), to optimize an energy functional of the electron density, so that it\nreproduces a dataset of experimental magnitudes. Our scheme, based on Bayes\ntheorem, constrains the optimized functional not to depart unphysically from\nexisting ab initio functionals. The resulting functional maximizes the\nprobability of being the \\correct\" parametrization of a given functional form,\nin the sense of Bayes theory. The application of DPPS to water sheds new light\non why density functional theory has performed rather poorly for liquid water,\non what improvements are needed, and on the intrinsic limitations of the\ngeneralized gradient approximation to electron exchange and correlation.\nFinally, we present tests of our water-optimized functional, that we call\nvdW-DF-w, showing that it performs very well for a variety of condensed water\nsystems.\n", "  The coefficient $C_T$ of the conformal energy-momentum tensor two-point\nfunction is determined for the non-unitary scalar CFTs with four- and\nsix-derivative kinetic terms. The results match those expected from large-$N$\ncalculations for the CFTs arising from the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma and\nGross-Neveu models in specific even dimensions. $C_T$ is also calculated for\nthe CFT arising from $(n-1)$-form gauge fields with derivatives in $2n+2$\ndimensions. Results for $(n-1)$-form theory extended to general dimensions as a\nnon-gauge-invariant CFT are also obtained; the resulting $C_T$ differs from\nthat for the gauge-invariant theory. The construction of conformal primaries by\nsubtracting descendants of lower-dimension primaries is also discussed. For\nfree theories this also leads to an alternative construction of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, which can be quite involved for higher-derivative\ntheories.\n", "  Regular black hole solutions are found among the Guilfoyle exact solutions.\nThese are spherically symmetric solutions of general relativity coupled to\nMaxwell's electromagnetism and charged matter where the metric potentials and\nelectromagnetic fields are related in some particularly simple form. We show\nthat, for certain ranges of the parameters, there are objects which correspond\nto regular charged black holes, whose interior region is filled by an\nelectrically charged phantom-like fluid, or, in the limiting case, a de Sitter\nfalse vacuum fluid, and whose exterior region is Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om. The\nboundary between both regions is a smooth boundary surface, except in the\nlimiting case where the boundary is made of a massless electrically charged\nspherically symmetric coat. The main physical and geometrical properties of\nsuch charged regular solutions are analyzed.\n", "  We present the dual formulation of double field theory at the linearized\nlevel. This is a classically equivalent theory describing the duals of the\ndilaton, the Kalb-Ramond field and the graviton in a T-duality or O(D,D)\ncovariant way. In agreement with previous proposals, the resulting theory\nencodes fields in mixed Young-tableau representations, combining them into an\nantisymmetric 4-tensor under O(D,D). In contrast to previous proposals, the\ntheory also requires an antisymmetric 2-tensor and a singlet, which are not all\npure gauge. The need for these additional fields is analogous to a similar\nphenomenon for \"exotic\" dualizations, and we clarify this by comparing with the\ndualizations of the component fields. We close with some speculative remarks on\nthe significance of these observations for the full non-linear theory yet to be\nconstructed.\n", "  Electromagnetic radiation from blazar jets often displays strong variability,\nextending from radio to $\\gamma$-ray frequencies. In a few cases, this\nvariability has been characterized using Fourier time lags, such as those\ndetected in the X-rays from Mrk~421 using BeppoSAX. The lack of a theoretical\nframework to interpret the data has motivated us to develop a new model for the\nformation of the X-ray spectrum and the time lags in blazar jets based on a\ntransport equation including terms describing stochastic Fermi acceleration,\nsynchrotron losses, shock acceleration, adiabatic expansion, and spatial\ndiffusion. We derive the exact solution for the Fourier transform of the\nelectron distribution, and use it to compute the Fourier transform of the\nsynchrotron radiation spectrum and the associated X-ray time lags. The same\ntheoretical framework is also used to compute the peak flare X-ray spectrum,\nassuming that a steady-state electron distribution is achieved during the peak\nof the flare. The model parameters are constrained by comparing the theoretical\npredictions with the observational data for Mrk~421. The resulting integrated\nmodel yields, for the first time, a complete first-principles physical\nexplanation for both the formation of the observed time lags and the shape of\nthe peak flare X-ray spectrum. It also yields direct estimates of the strength\nof the shock and the stochastic MHD wave acceleration components in the Mrk~421\njet.\n", "  Precision atomic spectroscopy is presently the work horse in quantum\ninformation technology, metrology, trace analysis and even for fundamental\ntests in physics. Stable lasers are inherent part of precision spectroscopy\nwhich in turn requires absolute wavelength markers suitably placed\ncorresponding to the atomic species being probed. Here we present, new lines of\ntellurium (Te$_2$) which allows locking of external cavity diode laser (ECDL)\nfor precision spectroscopy of singly charged barium ions. In addition, we have\ndeveloped an ECDL with over 100 GHz mod-hop-free tuning range using\ncommercially available diode from $\\textit{Nichia}$. These two developments\nallow nearly drift-free operation of a barium ion trap set-up with one single\nreference cell thereby reducing the complexity of the experiment.\n", "  We consider a topological insulator (TI) of spherical geometry and\nnumerically investigate the influence of disorder on the density of surface\nstates. To the clean Hamiltonian we add a surface disorder potential of the\nmost general hermitian form, $V = V^0(\\theta,\\phi) + {\\bf V}(\\theta,\\phi) \\cdot\n{\\bf \\sigma}$. We expand these four disorder functions in spherical harmonics\nand draw the expansion coefficients randomly from a four-dimensional, zero-mean\ngaussian distribution. Different strengths and classes of disorder are realized\nby specifying the $4 \\times 4$ covariance matrix. For each instantiation of the\ndisorder, we solve for the energy spectrum via exact diagonalization. Then we\ncompute the disorder-averaged density of states, $\\rho(E)$, by averaging over\n200,000 different instantiations. Disorder broadens the Landau-level delta\nfunctions of the clean density of states into peaks that decay and merge\ntogether. If the spin-dependent term is dominant, these peaks split due to the\nbreaking of the degeneracy between time-reversed partner states. Increasing\ndisorder strength pushes states closer and closer to zero energy (the Dirac\npoint), resulting in a low-energy density of states that becomes nonzero for\nsufficient disorder, typically approaching an energy-independent saturation\nvalue, for most classes of disorder. But for purely spin-dependent disorder\nwith ${\\bf V}$ either entirely out-of-surface or entirely in-surface, we\nidentify intriguing disorder-induced features in the vicinity of the Dirac\npoint. In the out-of-surface case, a new peak emerges at zero energy. In the\nin-surface case, we see a symmetry-protected zero at zero energy, with\n$\\rho(E)$ increasing linearly toward nonzero-energy peaks. These striking\nfeatures are explained in terms of the breaking (or not) of two chiral\nsymmetries of the clean Hamiltonian.\n", "  The vector boson fusion (VBF) event topology at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) allows efficient suppression of dijet backgrounds and is therefore a\npromising target for new physics searches. We consider dark matter models which\ninteract with the Standard Model through the electroweak sector: either through\nnew scalar and pseudoscalar mediators which can be embedded into the Higgs\nsector, or via effective operators suppressed by some higher scale, and\ntherefore have significant VBF production cross-sections. Using realistic\nsimulations of the ATLAS and CMS analysis chain, including estimates of major\nerror sources, we project the discovery and exclusion potential of the LHC for\nthese models over the next decade.\n", "  In this experiment liquid water is subject to an inhomogeneous electric field\n(${\\nabla}^2 E_a {\\approx} 10^{10} \\frac{V}{m^2}$ ) using a high voltage (20\nkV) point-plane electrode system. With interferometry it was found that the\napplication of a strong electric field gradient to water generates local\nchanges in the refractive index of the liquid, polarizes the surface and\ncreates a downward moving electro-convective jet. A maximum temperature\ndifference of 1 {\\deg}C is measured in the immediate vicinity of the point\nelectrode. Raman spectroscopy on water reveals an enhancement of the\nvibrational collective modes (3250 $cm^{-1}$) as well as an increase in the\nlocal mode (3490 $cm^{-1}$) energy. This bimodal enhancement indicates the\nspectral changes are not due to temperature. The intense field gradient thus\nestablishes an excited subpopulation of vibrational oscillators far from\nthermal equilibrium. Delocalization of the collective vibrational mode\nspatially expands this excited population beyond the microscale. Hindered\nrotational freedom due to electric field pinning of molecular dipoles retards\nheat flow and generates a chemical potential gradient. These changes are\nresponsible for the observed changes in refractive index and temperature. It is\ndemonstrated that polar liquids can thus support local non-equilibrium\nthermodynamic transient states critical to biochemical and environmental\nprocesses.\n", "  The electronic structure, magnetic and structural properties of the\nsuperconductor ThFeAsN are discussed in relation to the Fe-pnictide and\nFe-chalcogenide superconductors based on results of first principles\ncalculations. The electronic structure is that of a high density of states\nsemimetal. It shows approximately nested hole and electron Fermi surfaces of Fe\n$d$ character involving the $xz,yz$ and $xy$ orbitals. There is a strong\ntendency towards magnetism at the GGA level, and this magnetism is important\nfor describing the Fe-As bonding, but greatly overestimates the magnetic\nordering. The lowest energy magnetic state at the GGA level is the stripe\norder, and this particular order couples strongly to electrons near $E_F$.\nThFeAsN is therefore strongly similar to the Fe-pnictide family of\nsuperconductors, although it is a particularly anisotropic member.\n", "  The scattering of a linear wave on an optical event horizon, induced by a\ncross polarized soliton, is experimentally and numerically investigated in\nintegrated structures. The experiments are performed in a dispersion-engineered\nbirefringent silicon nanophotonic waveguide. In stark contrast with\nco-polarized waves, the large difference between the group velocity of the two\ncross-polarized waves enables a frequency conversion almost independent on the\nsoliton wavelength. It is shown that the generated idler is only shifted by 10\nnm around 1550 nm over a pump tuning range of 350 nm. Simulations using two\ncoupled full vectorial nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations fully support the\nexperimental results.\n", "  We report on experimental study of the exciton-polariton emission (PE)\npolarization noise below and above the polariton lasing threshold under\ncontinuous wave nonresonant excitation. The experiments were performed with a\nhigh-Q graded 5{\\lambda}/2 GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity with three quantum wells in\nthe strong coupling regime. The PE polarization noise substantially exceeded in\nmagnitude the shot noise level and, in the studied frequency range (up to 650\nMHz), had a flat spectrum. We have found that the PE polarization noise\nmagnitude dependence on the pump intensity showed specific features that had no\nanalogy in power dependences of the PE intensity and intensity noise.\nParticularly, the linear polarization fluctuations normalized by the emission\nintensity showed a remarkably non-monotonic dependence on the pump power. A\ntheoretical model describing the observed peculiarity of the PE polarization\nnoise is proposed.\n", "  Within a generic model we analyze the Stokes linewidth in surface enhanced\nRaman scattering (SERS) from molecules embedded as bridges in molecular\njunctions. We identify four main contributions to the off-resonant Stokes\nsignal and show that under zero voltage bias (a situation pertaining also to\nstandard SERS experiments) and at low bias junctions only one of these\ncontributions is pronounced. The linewidth of this component is determined by\nthe molecular vibrational relaxation rate, which is dominated by interactions\nwith the essentially bosonic thermal environment when the relevant molecular\nelectronic energy is far from the metal(s) Fermi energy(ies). It increases when\nthe molecular electronic level is close to the metal Fermi level so that an\nadditional vibrational relaxation channel due to electron-hole (eh) excition in\nthe molecule opens. Other contributions to the Raman signal, of considerably\nbroader linewidths, can become important at larger junction bias.\n", "  Effectively manipulating magnetism in ferromagnet (FM) thin film\nnanostructures with an in-plane current has become feasible since the\ndetermination of a 'giant' spin Hall effect (SHE) in certain heavy metal\n(HM)/FM system. Recently, both theoretical and experimental reports indicate\nthat the non-collinear and collinear metallic antiferromagnet (AF) materials\ncan have both a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and a strong SHE. Here we\nreport a systematic study of the SHE in PtMn with several PtMn/FM systems. By\nusing interface engineering to reduce the 'spin memory loss' we obtain a spin\ntorque efficiency as large as 0.24. This is more than twice the previously\nreported spin torque efficiency for PtMn. We also find that the apparent spin\ndiffusion length in PtMn is surprisingly long (about 2.3nm).\n", "  We study the thermodynamics and phase structures of the asymptotically flat\ndilatonic black holes in 4 dimensions, placed in a cavity {\\it a la} York, in\nstring theory for an arbitrary dilaton coupling. We consider these charged\nblack systems in canonical ensemble for which the temperature at the wall of\nand the charge inside the cavity are fixed. We find that the dilaton coupling\nplays the key role in the underlying phase structures. The connection of these\nblack holes to higher dimensional brane systems via diagonal (double) and/or\ndirect dimensional reductions indicates that the phase structures of the former\nmay exhaust all possible ones of the latter, which are more difficult to study,\nunder conditions of similar settings. Our study also shows that a diagonal\n(double) dimensional reduction preserves the underlying phase structure while a\ndirect dimensional reduction has the potential to change it.\n", "  We report on the observation of an unusual type of parametric\ndown-conversion. In the regime where collinear degenerate emission is in the\nanomalous range of group-velocity dispersion, its spectrum is restricted in\nboth angle and wavelength. Detuning from exact collinear-degenerate\nphasematching leads to a ring shape of the wavelength-angular spectrum,\nsuggesting a new type of spatiotemporal coherence and entanglement of photon\npairs. By imposing a phase varying in a specific way in both angle and\nwavelength, one can obtain an interesting state of an entangled photon pair,\nwith the two photons being never at the same point at the same time.\n", "  We analyse the excess in the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the center of our\ngalaxy observed by Fermi-LAT in terms of dark matter annihilation within the\nscalar Higgs portal model. In particular, we include the astrophysical\nuncertainties from the dark matter distribution and allow for unspecified\nadditional dark matter components. We demonstrate through a detailed numerical\nfit that the strength and shape of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum can indeed be\ndescribed by the model in various regions of dark matter masses and couplings.\nConstraints from invisible Higgs decays, direct dark matter searches, indirect\nsearches in dwarf galaxies and for $\\gamma$-ray lines, and constraints from the\ndark matter relic density reduce the parameter space to dark matter masses near\nthe Higgs resonance. We find two viable regions: one where the Higgs-dark\nmatter coupling is of ${\\cal O}(10^{-2})$, and an additional dark matter\ncomponent beyond the scalar WIMP of our model is preferred, and one region\nwhere the Higgs-dark matter coupling may be significantly smaller, but where\nthe scalar WIMP constitutes a significant fraction or even all of dark matter.\nBoth viable regions are hard to probe in future direct detection and collider\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the moduli-induced gravitino problem within the framework of the\nphenomenologically attractive mirage mediations. The huge amount of gravitino\ngenerated by the moduli decay can be successfully diluted by introducing an\nextra light modulus field which does not induce the supersymmetry breaking.\nSince the lifetime of extra modulus field becomes longer than usually\nconsidered modulus field, our proposed mechanism is applied to both the low-\nand high-scale supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We also point out that such an\nextra modulus field appears in the flux compactification of type II string\ntheory.\n", "  We develop an approach based on edge theories to calculate the entanglement\nentropy and related quantities in (2+1)-dimensional topologically ordered\nphases. Our approach is complementary to, e.g., the existing methods using\nreplica trick and Witten's method of surgery, and applies to a generic spatial\nmanifold of genus $g$, which can be bipartitioned in an arbitrary way. The\neffects of fusion and braiding of Wilson lines can be also straightforwardly\nstudied within our framework. By considering a generic superposition of states\nwith different Wilson line configurations, through an interference effect, we\ncan detect, by the entanglement entropy, the topological data of Chern-Simons\ntheories, e.g., the $R$-symbols, monodromy and topological spins of\nquasiparticles. Furthermore, by using our method, we calculate other\nentanglement measures such as the mutual information and the entanglement\nnegativity. In particular, it is found that the entanglement negativity of two\nadjacent non-contractible regions on a torus provides a simple way to\ndistinguish Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders.\n", "  We present a multiplexed, high-resolution (R~50,000 median) spectroscopic\nsurvey designed to detect exoplanet candidates in two southern star clusters\n(NGC 2516 and NGC 2422) using the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) on the\nMagellan/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. With 128 available fibers\nin our observing mode, we are able to target every star in the core half-degree\nof each cluster that could plausibly be a solar-analog member. Our\ntemplate-based spectral fits provide precise measurements of fundamental\nstellar properties - $T_{eff}$ ($\\pm$30 K), [Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe] ($\\pm$0.02\ndex), and $v_r\\sin(i)$ ($\\pm$0.3 km/s) - and radial velocities (RVs) by using\ntelluric absorption features from 7160 to 7290 $\\AA$ as a wavelength reference\nfor 251 mid-F to mid-K stars (126 in NGC 2516 and 125 in NGC 2422) that\ncomprise our survey. In each cluster we have obtained ~10-12 epochs of our\ntargets. Using repeat observations of an RV standard star we show our approach\ncan attain a single-epoch velocity precision of 25 m/s to 60 m/s over a broad\nrange of S/N throughout our observational baseline of 1.1 years. Our technique\nis suitable for non-rapidly rotating stars cooler than mid-F. In this paper we\ndescribe our observational sample, analysis methodology, and present a detailed\nstudy of the attainable precision and measurement capabilities of our approach.\nSubsequent papers will provide results for stars observed in the target\nclusters, analyze our dataset of RV time-series for stellar jitter and stellar\nand sub-stellar companions, and consider the implications of our findings on\nthe clusters themselves.\n", "  We use Onsager theory and the local density approximation to study\nsedimentation-diffusion equilibrium density profiles of binary mixtures of\nthick and thin hard rods. We construct stacking diagrams for three diameter\nratios, and find that even a simple spindle-shaped phase diagram with only\nisotropic-nematic demixing can lead to counter-intuitive stacking sequences\nsuch as an isotropic phase sandwiched between two nematic phases. For the most\ncomplex phase diagram considered here, we find sixteen distinct stacking\nsequences, including several with five sedimented layers. By adding\nsedimentation paths to composition-pressure and density-density phase diagrams\nand calculating density and composition profiles, we show that conclusions\nabout bulk phase diagrams of binary mixtures on the basis of\nsedimentation-diffusion equilibria should be drawn warily.\n", "  We study the effect of exotic charged current interactions on the electron\nenergy spectrum in tritium decay, focussing on the KATRIN experiment and a\npossible modified setup that has access to the full spectrum. Both sub-eV and\nkeV neutrino masses are considered. We perform a fully relativistic calculation\nand take all possible new interactions into account, demonstrating the possible\nsizable distortions in the energy spectrum.\n", "  We discuss general aspects of non-relativistic quantum chaos theory of\nscattering of a quantum particle on a system of a large number of naked\nsingularities. We define such a system space-temporal Sinai billiard We dis-\ncuss the problem in semiclassical approach. We show that in semiclassical\nregime the formation of trapped periodic semiclassical orbits inside the sys-\ntem is unavoidable. This leads to general expression of survival probabilities\nand scattering time delays, expanded to the chaotic Pollicott-Ruelle reso-\nnances. Finally, we comment on possible generalizations of these aspects to\nrelativistic quantum field theory.\n", "  We present flux-calibrated integrated spectra in the optical range (3700-6800\n\\AA) obtained at Complejo Astron\\'omico El Leoncito (CASLEO, Argentina) for a\nsample of 10 concentrated star clusters belonging to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). No previous data exist for two of these objects (SL 142 and SL 624),\nwhile most of the remaining clusters have been only poorly studied. We derive\nsimultaneously foreground $E(B-V)$ reddening values and ages for the cluster\nsample by comparing their integrated spectra with template LMC cluster spectra\nand with two different sets of simple stellar population models. Cluster\nreddening values and ages are also derived from both available interstellar\nextinction maps and by using diagnostic diagrams involving the sum of\nequivalent widths of some selected spectral features and their calibrations\nwith age, respectively. For the studied sample, we derive ages between 1 Myr\nand 240 Myr. In an effort to create a spectral library at the LMC metallicity\nlevel with several clusters per age range, the cluster sample here presented\nstands out as a useful complement to previous ones.\n", "  Transverse densities describe the spatial distribution of electromagnetic\ncurrent in the nucleon at fixed light-front time. At peripheral distances b =\nO(M_pi^{-1}) the densities are governed by chiral dynamics and can be\ncalculated model-independently using chiral effective field theory (EFT).\nRecent work has shown that the EFT results can be represented in\nfirst-quantized form, as overlap integrals of chiral light-front wave functions\ndescribing the transition of the nucleon to soft-pion-nucleon intermediate\nstates, resulting in a quantum-mechanical picture of the peripheral transverse\ndensities. We now extend this representation to include intermediate states\nwith Delta isobars and implement relations based on the large-N_c limit of QCD.\nWe derive the wave function overlap formulas for the Delta contributions to the\nperipheral transverse densities by way of a three-dimensional reduction of\nrelativistic chiral EFT expressions. Our procedure effectively maintains\nrotational invariance and avoids the ambiguities with higher-spin particles in\nthe light-front time-ordered approach. We study the interplay of pi-N and\npi-Delta intermediate states in the quantum-mechanical picture of the densities\nin a transversely polarized nucleon. We show that the correct N_c-scaling of\nthe charge and magnetization densities emerges as the result of the particular\ncombination of currents generated by intermediate states with degenerate N and\nDelta. The off-shell behavior of the chiral EFT is summarized in contact terms\nand can be studied easily. The methods developed here can be applied to other\nperipheral densities and to moments of the nucleon's generalized parton\ndistributions.\n", "  We propose an inclusive search for dark photons $A'$ at the LHCb experiment\nbased on both prompt and displaced di-muon resonances. Because the couplings of\nthe dark photon are inherited from the photon via kinetic mixing, the dark\nphoton $A' \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ rate can be directly inferred from the off-shell\nphoton $\\gamma^* \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ rate, making this a fully data-driven search.\nFor Run 3 of the LHC, we estimate that LHCb will have sensitivity to large\nregions of the unexplored dark-photon parameter space, especially in the\n210-520 MeV and 10-40 GeV mass ranges. This search leverages the excellent\ninvariant-mass and vertex resolution of LHCb, along with its unique\nparticle-identification and real-time data-analysis capabilities.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of multiple dispersive waves emitted\nin the anomalous dispersion region of an optical fiber from a train of dark\nsolitons. Each individual dispersive wave can be associated to one particular\ndark soliton of the train, using phase-matching arguments involving\nhigher-order dispersion and soliton velocity. For a large number of dark\nsolitons (>10), we observe the formation of a continuum associated with the\nefficient emission of dispersive waves.\n", "  Due to multiple possible polarizations hard exclusive production of tensor\nmesons by virtual photons or in heavy meson decays offers interesting\npossibilities to study the helicity structure of the underlying short-distance\nprocess. Motivated by the first measurement of the transition form factor\n$\\gamma^*\\gamma \\to f_2(1270)$ at large momentum transfers by the BELLE\ncollaboration we present an improved QCD analysis of this reaction in the\nframework of collinear factorization including contributions of twist-three\nquark-antiquark-gluon operators and an estimate of soft end-point corrections\nusing light-cone sum rules. The results appear to be in a very good agreement\nwith the data, in particular the predicted scaling behavior is reproduced in\nall cases.\n", "  The success of QCD factorization(QCDF) in predicting branching ratios for\ncharmless $B$ decays to light pseudoscalar and vector mesons and the small CP\nasymmetries measured at $BABAR$, Belle and LHCb show that the phase in these\ndecays, as predicted by QCDF, are not large. For a precise test of QCDF one\nneeds to extract from the measured decay rates, the phase of the decay\namplitude which appears in the interference terms between the tree and penguin\ncontribution. Since the tree amplitude is known at the leading order in\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}/m_{b}$ and is consistent with the measured tree-dominated\ndecay rates, the QCDF value for the tree amplitude can be used with the\nmeasured decay rates to obtain the phases in $B\\to K\\pi$,$K\\rho$, and $\nK^{*}\\pi$ decay rates. This is similar to the extraction of the final-state\ninteraction phases in the interference term between $p\\bar{p}\\to J/\\Psi\\to\ne^{+}e^{-}$ and $p\\bar{p}\\to e^{+}e^{-} $ and in $J/\\Psi\\to 0^{-}0^{-}$ done\npreviously. In this paper, we present a determination of the phase between the\n$I=3/2$ tree and $I=1/2$ penguin amplitudes in $B\\to K\\pi$,$K\\rho$ , and $\nK^{*}\\pi$ decays using the measured decay rates and the QCDF $I=3/2$ tree\namplitude obtained from the $I=2$ $B^{+}\\to \\pi^{+}\\pi^{0},\\rho^{0}\\pi^{+},\n\\rho^{+}\\pi^{0 tree-dominated decays and compare the result with the phase\ngiven by QCDF. It is remarkable that the phase extracted from experiments\ndiffers only slightly from the QCDF values. This shows that there is no large\nfinal-state interaction strong phase in $B\\to K\\pi$,$K\\rho$, and $ K^{*}\\pi$\ndecays.\n", "  Stochastic backgrounds of relic gravitons of cosmological origin extend from\nfrequencies of the order of the aHz up to the GHz range. Since the temperature\nand polarization anisotropies constrain the low frequency normalization of the\nspectra, in the concordance paradigm the strain amplitude corresponding to the\nfrequency window of wide-band interferometers turns out to be, approximately,\nnine orders of magnitude smaller than the astounding signal recently reported\nand attributed to a binary black hole merger. The backgrounds of relic\ngravitons expected from the early Universe are compared with the stochastic\nforegrounds stemming from the estimated multiplicity of the astrophysical\nsources. It is suggested that while the astrophysical foregrounds are likely to\ndominate between few Hz and 10 kHz, relic gravitons with frequencies exceeding\n100 kHz represent a potentially uncontaminated signal for the next generation\nof high-frequency detectors currently under scrutiny.\n", "  We construct a geometric model of eight-dimensional manifolds and realize\nthem in the context of type II string theory. These eight-manifolds are\nconstructed by non-trivial $T^{4}$ fibrations over Calabi-Yau two-folds. These\ngive rise to eight-dimensional non-Kahler Hermitian manifolds with $SU(4)$\nstructure. The eight-manifold is also a circle fibration over a\nseven-dimensional $G_{2}$ manifold with skew torsion. The eight-manifolds of\nthis type appear as internal manifolds with $SU(4)$ structure in type IIB\nstring theory with $F_{3}$ and $F_{7}$ fluxes. These manifolds have generalized\ncalibrated cycles in the presence of fluxes.\n", "  Context: Surveys in the visible and near-infrared spectral range have\nrevealed the presence of low-albedo asteroids in cometary like orbits (ACOs).\nIn contrast to Jupiter family comets (JFCs), ACOs are inactive, but possess\nsimilar orbital parameters. Aims: In this work, we discuss why ACOs are\ninactive, whereas JFCs show gas-driven dust activity, although both belong to\nthe same class of primitive solar system bodies. Methods: We hypothesize that\nACOs and JFCs have formed under the same physical conditions, namely by the\ngravitational collapse of ensembles of ice and dust aggregates. We use the\nmemory effect of dust-aggregate layers under gravitational compression to\ndiscuss under which conditions the gas-driven dust activity of these bodies is\npossible. Results: Owing to their smaller sizes, JFCs can sustain gas-driven\ndust activity much longer than the bigger ACOs, whose sub-surface regions\npossess an increased tensile strength, due to gravitational compression of the\nmaterial. The increased tensile strength leads to the passivation against dust\nactivity after a relatively short time of activity. Conclusions: The\ngravitational-collapse model of the formation of planetesimals, together with\nthe gravitational compression of the sub-surface material simultaneously,\nexplains the inactivity of ACOs and the gas-driven dust activity of JFCs. Their\ninitially larger sizes means that ACOs possess a higher tensile strength of\ntheir sub-surface material, which leads to a faster termination of gas-driven\ndust activity. Most objects with radii larger than $2 \\, \\mathrm{km}$ have\nalready lost their activity due to former gravitational compression of their\ncurrent surface material.\n", "  We study the problems of chiral symmetry breaking and eigenmode localisation\nin finite-temperature QCD by looking at the lattice Dirac operator as a random\nHamiltonian. We recast the staggered Dirac operator into an unconventional\nthree-dimensional Anderson Hamiltonian (\"Dirac-Anderson Hamiltonian\") carrying\ninternal degrees of freedom, with disorder provided by the fluctuations of the\ngauge links. In this framework, we identify the features relevant to chiral\nsymmetry restoration and localisation of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in the\nordering of the local Polyakov lines, and in the related correlation between\nspatial links across time slices, thus tying the two phenomena to the\ndeconfinement transition. We then build a toy model based on QCD and on the\nDirac-Anderson approach, replacing the Polyakov lines with spin variables and\nsimplifying the dynamics of the spatial gauge links, but preserving the\nabove-mentioned relevant dynamical features. Our toy model successfully\nreproduces the main features of the QCD spectrum and of the Dirac eigenmodes\nconcerning chiral symmetry breaking and localisation, both in the ordered\n(deconfined) and disordered (confined) phases. Moreover, it allows us to study\nseparately the roles played in the two phenomena by the diagonal and the\noff-diagonal terms of the Dirac-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our results support our\nexpectation that chiral symmetry restoration and localisation of the low modes\nare closely related, and that both are triggered by the deconfinement\ntransition.\n", "  A general method is introduced for verifying multitime quantum correlations\nthrough the characteristic function of the time-dependent P functional that\ngeneralizes the Glauber-Sudarshan P function. Quantum correlation criteria are\nderived which identify quantum effects for an arbitrary number of points in\ntime. The Magnus expansion is used to visualize the impact of the required time\nordering, which becomes crucial in situations when the interaction problem is\nexplicitly time dependent. We show that the latter affects the\nmulti-time-characteristic function and, therefore, the temporal evolution of\nthe nonclassicality. As an example, we apply our technique to an optical\nparametric process with a frequency mismatch. The resulting\ntwo-time-characteristic function yields full insight into the two-time quantum\ncorrelation properties of such a system.\n", "  We consider force-free plasma waves launched by the motion of conducting\nmaterial through a magnetic field. We develop a spacetime-covariant formalism\nfor perturbations of a uniform magnetic field and show how the transverse\nmotion of a conducting fluid acts as a source. We show that fast-mode waves are\nsourced by the compressibility of the fluid, with incompressible fluids\nlaunching a pure-Alfv\\'en outflow. Remarkably, this outflow can be written down\nin closed form for an arbitrary time-dependent, nonaxisymmetric incompressible\nflow. The instantaneous flow velocity is imprinted on the magnetic field and\ntransmitted away at the speed of light, carrying detailed information about the\nconducting source at the time of emission. These results can be applied to\ntransients in pulsar outflows and to jets from neutron stars orbiting in the\nmagnetosphere of another compact object. We discuss jets from moving conductors\nin some detail.\n", "  Estimated are the contributions of the following mechanisms responsible for\nthe decay $f_1(1285)\\to f_0(980)\\pi^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$: 1) the contribution\nof the $a^0_0(980)-f_0(980)$ mixing, $f_1(1285)\\to a_0(980)\\pi^0\\to\n(K^+K^-+K^0\\bar K^0)\\pi^0\\to f_0(980)\\pi^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$, 2) the\ncontribution of the transition $f_1(1285)\\to(K^+K^-+K^0\\bar K^0)\\pi^0\\to f_0\n(980)\\pi^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$, arising due to the pointlike decay $f_1\n(1285)\\to K\\bar K\\pi^0$, 3) the contribution of the transition\n$f_1(1285)\\to(K^*\\bar K+\\bar K^*K)\\to(K^+K^-+K^0\\bar K^0)\\pi^0\\to\nf_0(980)\\pi^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$, where $K^*=K^*(892)$, and 4) the\ncontribution of the transition $f_1(1285)\\to(K^*_0\\bar K+\\bar\nK^*_0K)\\to(K^+K^-+K^0\\bar K^0)\\pi^0\\to f_0(980)\\to\\pi^+ \\pi^-\\pi^0$, where\n$K^*_0=K^*_0(800)$ (or $\\kappa$) and $K^*_0(1430)$. These mechanisms break the\nconservation of the isospin due to the nonzero mass difference of the $K^+$ and\n$K^0$ mesons. They result in the appearance of the narrow resonance structure\nin the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ mass spectrum in the region of the $K\\bar K$ thresholds,\nwith the width $\\approx2m_{K^0}-2m_{K^+}\\approx8$ MeV. The observation of such\na structure in experiment is the direct indication on the $K\\bar K$ loop\nmechanism of the breaking of the isotopic invariance. We point out that\nexisting data should be more precise, and it is difficult to explain them using\nthe single specific mechanism from those listed above. Taking the decay\n$f_1(1285)\\to f_0(980)\\pi^0 \\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ as the example, we discuss the\ngeneral approach to the description of the $K\\bar K$ loop mechanism of the\nbreaking of isotopic invariance.\n", "  A number of works have shown that important information on the equation of\nstate of matter at nuclear density can be extracted from the gravitational\nwaves emitted by merging neutron-star binaries. We present a comprehensive\nanalysis of the gravitational-wave signal emitted during the inspiral, merger\nand post-merger of 56 neutron-star binaries. This sample of binaries, arguably\nthe largest studied to date with realistic equations of state, spans across six\ndifferent nuclear-physics equations of state and ten masses, allowing us to\nsharpen a number of results recently obtained on the spectral properties of the\ngravitational-wave signal. Overall we find that: (i) for binaries with masses\ndiffering no more than $20\\%$, the frequency at gravitational-wave amplitude's\nmaximum is related quasi-universally with the tidal deformability of the two\nstars; (ii) the spectral properties vary during the post-merger phase, with a\ntransient phase lasting a few millisecond after the merger and followed by a\nquasi-stationary phase; (iii) when distinguishing the spectral peaks between\nthese two phases, a number of ambiguities in the identification of the peaks\ndisappear, leaving a simple and robust picture; (iv) using properly identified\nfrequencies, quasi-universal relations are found between the spectral features\nand the properties of the neutron stars; (v) for the most salient peaks\nanalytic fitting functions can be obtained in terms of the stellar tidal\ndeformability or compactness. Altogether, these results support the idea that\nthe equation of state of nuclear matter can be constrained tightly when a\nsignal in gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is detected.\n", "  We experimentally address the significance of fidelity as a figure of merit\nin quantum state reconstruction of discrete (DV) and continuous variable (CV)\nquantum optical systems. In particular, we analyze the use of fidelity in\nquantum homodyne tomography of CV states and maximum-likelihood polarization\ntomography of DV ones, focussing attention on nonclassicality, entanglement and\nquantum discord as a function of fidelity to a target state. Our findings show\nthat high values of fidelity, despite well quantifying geometrical proximity in\nthe Hilbert space, may be obtained for states displaying opposite physical\nproperties, e.g. quantum or semiclassical features. In particular, we analyze\nin details the quantum-to-classical transition for squeezed thermal states of a\nsingle-mode optical system and for Werner states of a two-photon polarization\nqubit system.\n", "  We discuss various modified dispersion relations motivated by quantum gravity\nwhich might affect the propagation of the recently observed gravitational-wave\nsignal of the event GW150914. We find that the bounds set by the data on the\ncharacteristic quantum-gravity mass scale $M$ are too weak to constrain these\nscenarios and, in general, much weaker than the expected $M> 10^4\\,\\text{eV}$\nfor a correction to the dispersion relation linear in $1/M$. We illustrate this\nissue by giving lower bounds on $M$, plus an upper bound coming from\nconstraints on the size of a quantum ergosphere. We also show that a\nphenomenological dispersion relation $\\omega^2 = k^2(1+\\alpha k^n/M^n)$ is\ncompatible with observations and, at the same time, has a phenomenologically\nviable mass $M>10\\,\\text{TeV}$ only in the quite restrictive range $0<n<0.68$.\nRemarkably, this is the domain of multiscale spacetimes but not of known\nquantum-gravity models.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the background gauge field configurations\nthat act as disorder for the Anderson localization mechanism in the Dirac\nspectrum of QCD at high temperatures. We compute the eigenmodes of the M\\\"obius\ndomain-wall fermion operator on configurations generated for the $SU(3)$ gauge\ntheory with two flavors of fermions, in the temperature range $[0.9,1.9]T_c$.\nWe identify the source of localization of the eigenmodes with gauge\nconfigurations that are self-dual and support negative fluctuations of the\nPolyakov loop $P_L$, in the high temperature sea of $P_L\\sim 1$. The dependence\nof these observations on the boundary conditions of the valence operator is\nstudied. We also investigate the spatial overlap of the left-handed and\nright-handed projected eigenmodes in correlation with the localization and the\ncorresponding eigenvalue. We discuss an interpretation of the results in terms\nof monopole-instanton structures.\n", "  We present results on the inspiral, merger, and post-merger evolution of a\nneutron star - neutron star (NSNS) system. Our results are obtained using the\nhybrid pseudospectral-finite volume Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). To test our\nnumerical methods, we evolve an equal-mass system for $\\approx 22$ orbits\nbefore merger. This waveform is the longest waveform obtained from fully\ngeneral-relativistic simulations for NSNSs to date. Such long (and accurate)\nnumerical waveforms are required to further improve semi-analytical models used\nin gravitational wave data analysis, for example the effective one body models.\nWe discuss in detail the improvements to SpEC's ability to simulate NSNS\nmergers, in particular mesh refined grids to better resolve the merger and\npost-merger phases. We provide a set of consistency checks and compare our\nresults to NSNS merger simulations with the independent BAM code. We find\nagreement between them, which increases confidence in results obtained with\neither code. This work paves the way for future studies using long waveforms\nand more complex microphysical descriptions of neutron star matter in SpEC.\n", "  The behaviour of sedimenting particles depends on the dust-to-gas ratio of\nthe fluid. Linear stability analysis shows that solids settling in the Epstein\ndrag regime would remain homogeneously distributed in non-rotating\nincompressible fluids, even when dust-to-gas ratios reach unity. However, the\nnon-linear evolution has not been probed before. Here, we present numerical\ncalculations indicating that in a particle-dense mixture solids spontaneously\nmix out of the fluid and form swarms overdense in particles by at least a\nfactor 10. The instability is caused by mass-loaded regions locally breaking\nthe equilibrium background stratification. The driving mechanism depends on\nnon-linear perturbations of the background flow and shares some similarity to\nthe streaming instability in accretion discs. The resulting particle-rich\nswarms may stimulate particle growth by coagulation. In the context of\nprotoplanetary discs, the instability could be relevant for aiding small\nparticles to settle to the midplane in the outer disc. Inside the gas envelopes\nof protoplanets, enhanced settling may lead to a reduced dust opacity, which\nfacilitates the contraction of the envelope. We show that the relevant physical\nset up can be recreated in a laboratory setting. This will allow our numerical\ncalculations to be investigated experimentally in the future.\n", "  We analyze the cusp anomalous dimension in the (leading) ladder limit of\n$\\mathcal N=4$ SYM and present new results for its higher-order perturbative\nexpansion. We study two different limits with respect to the cusp angle $\\phi$.\nThe first is the light-like regime where $x = e^{i\\,\\phi}\\to 0$. This limit is\ncharacterised by a non-trivial expansion of the cusp anomaly as a sum of powers\nof $\\log x$, where the maximum exponent increases with the loop order. The\ncoefficients of this expansion have remarkable transcendentality features and\ncan be expressed by products of single zeta values. We show that the whole\nlogarithmic expansion is fully captured by a solvable Woods-Saxon like\none-dimensional potential. From the exact solution, we extract generating\nfunctions for the cusp anomaly as well as for the various specific\ntranscendental structures appearing therein. The second limit that we discuss\nis the regime of small cusp angle. In this somewhat simpler case, we show how\nto organise the quantum mechanical perturbation theory in a novel efficient way\nby means of a suitable all-order Ansatz for the ground state of the associated\nSchr\\\"odinger problem. Our perturbative setup allows to systematically derive\nhigher-order perturbative corrections in powers of the cusp angle as explicit\nnon-perturbative functions of the effective coupling. This series approximation\nis compared with the numerical solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation to show\nthat we can achieve very good accuracy over the whole range of coupling and\ncusp angle. Our results have been obtained by relatively simple techniques.\nNevertheless, they provide several non-trivial tests useful to check the\napplication of Quantum Spectral Curve methods to the ladder approximation at\nnon zero $\\phi$, in the two limits we studied.\n", "  The propagation of a surface plasmon-polariton along a stack of doped\ngraphene sheets is considered. This auxiliary problem is used to discuss: (i)\nthe scattering of such a mode at an interface between the stack and the vacuum;\n(ii) the scattering at an interface where there is a sudden change of the\nelectronic doping. The formalism is then extended to the {\\it barrier problem}.\nIn this system rich physics is found for the plasmonic mode, showing: total\nreflection, total transmission, Fabry-P\\'erot oscillations, and coupling to\nphotonic modes.\n", "  We report the results of an extensive search in the AGILE data for a\ngamma-ray counterpart of the LIGO gravitational wave event GW150914. Currently\nin spinning mode, AGILE has the potential of covering with its gamma-ray\ninstrument 80 % of the sky more than 100 times a day. It turns out that AGILE\ncame within a minute from the event time of observing the accessible GW150914\nlocalization region. Interestingly, the gamma-ray detector exposed about 65 %\nof this region during the 100 s time intervals centered at -100 s and +300 s\nfrom the event time. We determine a 2-sigma flux upper limit in the band 50 MeV\n- 10 GeV, $UL = 1.9 \\times 10^{-8} \\rm \\, erg \\, cm^{-2} \\, s^{-1}$ obtained\nabout 300 s after the event. The timing of this measurement is the fastest ever\nobtained for GW150914, and significantly constrains the electromagnetic\nemission of a possible high-energy counterpart. We also carried out a search\nfor a gamma-ray precursor and delayed emission over timescales ranging from\nminutes to days: in particular, we obtained an optimal exposure during the\ninterval -150 / -30 s. In all these observations, we do not detect a\nsignificant signal associated with GW150914. We do not reveal the weak\ntransient source reported by Fermi-GBM 0.4 s after the event time. However,\neven though a gamma-ray counterpart of the GW150914 event was not detected, the\nprospects for future AGILE observations of gravitational wave sources are\ndecidedly promising.\n", "  Estimation of bolometric fluxes (F_BOL) is an essential component of stellar\neffective temperature determination with optical and near-infrared\ninterferometry. Reliable estimation of F_BOL simply from broad-band K-band\nphotometry data is a useful tool in those cases were contemporaneous and/or\nwide-range photometry is unavailable for a detailed spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fit, as was demonstrated in Dyck et al. (1974).\nRecalibrating the intrinsic F_BOL versus observed F_2.2um relationship of that\nstudy with modern SED fitting routines, which incorporate the significantly\nnon-blackbody, empirical spectral templates of the INGS spectral library (an\nupdate of the library in Pickles 1998) and estimation of reddening, serves to\ngreatly improve the accuracy and observational utility of this relationship. We\nfind that F_BOL values predicted are roughly 11% less than the corresponding\nvalues predicted in Dyck et al. (1974), indicating the effects of SED\nabsorption features across bolometric flux curves.\n", "  The ultraviolet (UV) spectral energy distributions of low-mass (K- and\nM-type) stars play a critical role in the heating and chemistry of exoplanet\natmospheres, but are not observationally well-constrained. Direct observations\nof the intrinsic flux of the Lyman alpha line (the dominant source of UV\nphotons from low-mass stars) are challenging, as interstellar HI absorbs the\nentire line core for even the closest stars. To address the existing gap in\nempirical constraints on the UV flux of K and M dwarfs, the MUSCLES HST\nTreasury Survey has obtained UV observations of 11 nearby M and K dwarfs\nhosting exoplanets. This paper presents the Lyman alpha and extreme-UV spectral\nreconstructions for the MUSCLES targets. Most targets are optically inactive,\nbut all exhibit significant UV activity. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\ntechnique to correct the observed Lyman alpha profiles for interstellar\nabsorption, and we employ empirical relations to compute the extreme-UV\nspectral energy distribution from the intrinsic Lyman alpha flux in ~100 {\\AA}\nbins from 100-1170 {\\AA}. The reconstructed Lyman alpha profiles have 300 km/s\nbroad cores, while >1% of the total intrinsic Lyman alpha flux is measured in\nextended wings between 300 km/s to 1200 km/s. The Lyman alpha surface flux\npositively correlates with the MgII surface flux and negatively correlates with\nthe stellar rotation period. Stars with larger Lyman alpha surface flux also\ntend to have larger surface flux in ions formed at higher temperatures, but\nthese correlations remain statistically insignificant in our sample of 11\nstars. We also present HI column density measurements for 10 new sightlines\nthrough the local interstellar medium.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity has been predicted to arise in the\ntopologically non-trivial Fermi surface of doped inversion symmetric Weyl\nsemimetals (WSM). In particular, Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) and\nnodal BCS states are theoretically predicted to be possible superconductor\npairing states in inversion symmetric doped WSM. In an effort to resolve\npreferred pairing state, we theoretically study two separate four terminal\nquantum transport methods that each exhibit a unique electrical signature in\nthe presence of FFLO and nodal BCS states in doped WSMs. We first introduce a\nJosephson junction that consists of a doped WSM and an s-wave superconductor in\nwhich we show that the application of a transverse uniform current in s-wave\nsuperconductor effectively cancels the momentum carried by FFLO states in doped\nWSM. From our numerical analysis, we find a peak in Josephson current amplitude\nat finite uniform current in s-wave superconductor that serves as an indicator\nof FFLO states in doped WSMs. Furthermore, we show using a four terminal\nmeasurement configuration that the nodal points may be shifted by an\napplication of transverse uniform current in doped WSM. We analyze the\ntopological phase transitions induced by nodal pair annihilation in\nnon-equilibrium by constructing the phase diagram and we find a characteristic\ndecrease in the density of states that serves as a signature of the quantum\ncritical point in the topological phase transition, thereby identifying nodal\nBCS states in doped WSM.\n", "  The relevant phenomenology and the best search schemes of a\nsubelectroweak-scale gauge boson can be vastly different depending on its\ncoupling. For instance, the rare decay into a light gauge boson and the high\nprecision parity test can be sensitive if it has an axial coupling. The minimal\ngauge extension of the standard model with the U(1)_{B-L + xY} requires only\nthree right-handed neutrinos, well-suited to the current neutrino mass and\nmixing data, and no additional exotic matter fields. We study the light gauge\nboson of this symmetry in detail including its axial coupling property from the\nhypercharge shift.\n", "  We review the application of the consistent (or decoherent) histories\nformulation of quantum theory to canonical loop quantum cosmology. Conventional\nquantum theory relies crucially on \"measurements\" to convert unrealized quantum\npotentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities. In\nthe early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observers\nor measuring apparatus (or indeed, in any closed quantum system), what criteria\ndetermine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what their\nprobabilities are? In the consistent histories formulation it is the vanishing\nof interference between the branch wave functions describing alternative\nhistories -- as determined by the system's decoherence functional -- that\ndetermines which alternatives may be assigned probabilities. We describe the\nconsistent histories formulation and how it may be applied to canonical loop\nquantum cosmology, describing in detail the application to homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmological models with scalar matter. We show how the theory may be\nused to make definite physical predictions in the absence of \"observers\". As an\napplication, we demonstrate how the theory predicts that loop quantum models\n\"bounce\" from large volume to large volume, while conventional\n\"Wheeler-DeWitt\"-quantized universes are invariably singular. We also briefly\nindicate the relation to other work.\n", "  We explore the hardening of a massive black hole binary embedded in a\ncircum-binary gas disc when the binary and the gas are coplanar and the gas is\ncounter-rotating. The secondary black hole, revolving in the direction opposite\nto the gas, experiences a drag from gas-dynamical friction and from direct\naccretion of part of it. Using two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical grid\nsimulations we investigate the effect of changing the accretion prescriptions\non the dynamics of the secondary black hole which in turn affect the binary\nhardening and eccentricity evolution. We find that realistic accretion\nprescriptions lead to results that differ from those inferred assuming\naccretion of all the gas within the Roche Lobe of the secondary black hole.\nDifferent accretion prescriptions result in different disc's surface densities\nwhich alter the black hole's dynamics back. Full 3D SPH realizations of a\nnumber of representative cases, run over a shorter interval of time, validate\nthe general trends observed in the less computationally demanding 2D\nsimulations. Initially circular black hole binaries increase only slightly\ntheir eccentricity which then oscillates around small values (<0.1) while they\nharden. By contrast, initially eccentric binaries become more and more\neccentric. A semi-analytical model describing the black hole's dynamics under\naccretion only explores the late evolution stages of the binary in an otherwise\nunperturbed retrograde disc to illustrate how eccentricity evolves with time in\nrelation to the shape of the underlying surface density distribution.\n", "  We present new $H$ (1.5-1.8 $\\mu$m) photometric and $K_1$ (1.9-2.2 $\\mu$m)\nspectroscopic observations of the young exoplanet HD 95086 b obtained with the\nGemini Planet Imager. The $H$-band magnitude has been significantly improved\nrelative to previous measurements, whereas the low resolution $K_1$\n($\\lambda/\\delta\\lambda \\approx 66$) spectrum is featureless within the\nmeasurement uncertainties, and presents a monotonically increasing\npseudo-continuum consistent with a cloudy atmosphere. By combining these new\nmeasurements with literature $L^{\\prime}$ photometry, we compare the spectral\nenergy distribution of the planet to other young planetary-mass companions,\nfield brown dwarfs, and to the predictions of grids of model atmospheres. HD\n95086 b is over a magnitude redder in $K_1-L^{\\prime}$ color than 2MASS\nJ12073346-3932539 b and HR 8799 c and d, despite having a similar $L^{\\prime}$\nmagnitude. Considering only the near-infrared measurements, HD 95086 b is most\nanalogous to the brown dwarfs 2MASS J2244316+204343 and 2MASS\nJ21481633+4003594, both of which are thought to have dusty atmospheres.\nMorphologically, the spectral energy distribution of HD 95086 b is best fit by\nlow temperature ($T_{\\rm eff} =$ 800-1300 K), low surface gravity spectra from\nmodels which simulate high photospheric dust content. This range of effective\ntemperatures is consistent with field L/T transition objects, but the spectral\ntype of HD 95086 b is poorly constrained between early L and late T due to its\nunusual position the color-magnitude diagram, demonstrating the difficulty in\nspectral typing young, low surface gravity substellar objects. As one of the\nreddest such objects, HD 95086 b represents an important empirical benchmark\nagainst which our current understanding of the atmospheric properties of young\nextrasolar planets can be tested.\n", "  Vertical gold-nanogaps are created on microtubular cavities to explore the\ncoupling between resonant light supported by the microcavities and surface\nplasmons localized at the nanogaps. Selective coupling of optical axial modes\nand localized surface plasmons critically depends on the exact location of the\ngold-nanogap on the microcavities which is conveniently achieved by rolling-up\nspecially designed thin dielectric films into three dimensional microtube ring\nresonators. The coupling phenomenon is explained by a modified quasi-potential\nmodel based on perturbation theory. Our work reveals the coupling of surface\nplasmon resonances localized at the nanoscale to optical resonances confined in\nmicrotubular cavities at the microscale, implying a promising strategy for the\ninvestigation of light-matter interactions.\n", "  The study of X-ray time-lag spectra in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is\ncurrently an active research area, since it has the potential to illuminate the\nphysics and geometry of the innermost region (i.e. close to the putative\nsuper-massive black hole) in these objects. To obtain reliable information from\nthese studies, the statistical properties of time-lags estimated from data must\nbe known as accurately as possible.\n  Aims: We investigated the statistical properties of Fourier-based time-lag\nestimates (i.e. based on the cross-periodogram), using evenly sampled time\nseries with no missing points. Our aim is to provide practical `guidelines' on\nestimating time-lags that are minimally biased (i.e. whose mean is close to\ntheir intrinsic value) and have known errors.}\n  Methods: Our investigation is based on both analytical work and extensive\nnumerical simulations. The latter consisted of generating artificial time\nseries with various signal-to-noise ratios and sampling patterns/durations\nsimilar to those offered by AGN observations with present and past X-ray\nsatellites. We also considered a range of different model time-lag spectra\ncommonly assumed in X-ray analyses of compact accreting systems.\n  Results: Discrete sampling, binning and finite light curve duration cause the\nmean of the time-lag estimates to have a smaller magnitude than their intrinsic\nvalues. Smoothing (i.e. binning over consecutive frequencies) of the\ncross-periodogram can add extra bias at low frequencies. The use of light\ncurves with low signal-to-noise ratio reduces the intrinsic coherence, and can\nintroduce a bias to the sample coherence, time-lag estimates, and their\npredicted error.\n", "  We study the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction in $j=3/2$ Dirac\nelectrons in cubic crystals with the $O_h$ symmetry, which serves as an\neffective model for antiperovskite topological crystalline insulators. The\nrenormalization group analysis reveals three fixed points that are Lorentz\ninvariant, rotationally invariant, and $O_h$ invariant. Among them, the\nLorentz- and $O_h$-invariant fixed points are stable in the low-energy limit\nwhile the rotationally invariant fixed point is unstable. The existence of a\nstable $O_h$-invariant fixed point of Dirac fermions with finite velocity\nanisotropy presents an interesting counterexample to emergent Lorentz\ninvariance in solids.\n", "  A methodology is worked out to retrieve the numerical values of all the main\nparameters of the six-dimensional adiabatic potential energy surface (APES) of\na polyatomic system with a quadratic T-term Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) from\nultrasound experiments. The method is based on a verified assumption that\nultrasound attenuation and speed encounter anomalies when the direction of\npropa- gation and polarization of its wave of strain coincides with the\ncharacteristic directions of symmetry breaking in the JTE. For the SrF2:Cr\ncrystal, employed as a basic example, we observed anomaly peaks in the\ntemperature dependence of attenuation of ultrasound at frequencies of 50-160\nMHz in the temperature interval of 40-60 K for the wave propagating along the\n[110] direction, for both the longitudinal and shear modes, the latter with two\npolarizations along the [001] and [110] axes, respectively. We show that these\nanomalies are due to the ultrasound relaxation by the system of non-interacting\nCr2+ JT centers with orthorhombic local distortions. The interpretation of the\nex- perimental findings is based on the T2g (eg +t2g) JTE problem including the\nlinear and quadratic terms of vibronic interactions in the Hamiltonian and the\nsame-symmetry modes reduced to one interaction mode. Combining the experimental\nresults with a theoretical analysis we show that on the complicated\nsix-dimensional APES of this system with three tetragonal, four trigonal, and\nsix orthorhombic extrema points, the latter are global minima, while the former\nare saddle points, and we estimate numerically all the main parameters of this\nsurface, including the linear and quadratic vibronic coupling constants, the\nprimary force constants, the coordinates of all the extrema points and their\nenergies, the energy barrier between the orthorhombic minima, and the tunneling\nsplitting of the ground vibrational states.\n", "  Many classes of non-parity-time (PT) symmetric waveguides with arbitrary gain\nand loss distributions still possess all-real linear spectrum or exhibit phase\ntransition. In this article, nonlinear light behaviors in these complex\nwaveguides are probed analytically near a phase transition. Using multi-scale\nperturbation methods, a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) is\nderived for the light's amplitude evolution. This ODE predicts that the first\nclass of these non-PT-symmetric waveguides support continuous families of\nsolitons and robust amplitude-oscillating solutions both above and below phase\ntransition, in close analogy with PT-symmetric systems. For the other classes\nof waveguides, the light's intensity always amplifies under the effect of\nnonlinearity even if the waveguide is below phase transition. These analytical\npredictions are confirmed by direct computations of the full system.\n", "  It has been long discussed that cosmic rays may contain signals of dark\nmatter. In the last couple of years an anomaly of cosmic-ray positrons has\ndrawn a lot of attentions, and recently an excess in cosmic-ray anti-proton has\nbeen reported by AMS-02 collaboration. Both excesses may indicate towards\ndecaying or annihilating dark matter with a mass of around 1-10 TeV. In this\narticle we study the gamma rays from dark matter and constraints from cross\ncorrelations with distribution of galaxies, particularly in a local volume. We\nfind that gamma rays due to inverse-Compton process have large intensity, and\nhence they give stringent constraints on dark matter scenarios in the TeV scale\nmass regime. Taking the recent developments in modeling astrophysical gamma-ray\nsources as well as comprehensive possibilities of the final state products of\ndark matter decay or annihilation into account, we show that the parameter\nregions of decaying dark matter that are suggested to explain the excesses are\nexcluded. We also discuss the constrains on annihilating scenarios.\n", "  We calculate the decay width of h0 -> b bbar in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) with quark flavour violation (QFV) at full one-loop\nlevel. We study the effect of scharm-stop mixing and sstrange-sbottom mixing\ntaking into account the constraints from the B meson data. We discuss and\ncompare in detail the decays h0 -> c cbar and h0 -> b bbar within the framework\nof the perturbative mass insertion technique using the Flavour Expansion\nTheorem. The deviation of both decay widths from the Standard Model values can\nbe quite large. Whereas in h0 -> c cbar it is almost entirely due to the\nflavour violating part of the MSSM, in h0 -> b bbar it is mainly due to the\nflavour conserving part. Nevertheless, the QFV contribution to Gamma(h0 -> b\nbbar) due to scharm-stop mixing and chargino exchange can go up to about 8%.\n", "  We study the effects of an asymmetric radiation field on the properties of a\nmolecular cloud envelope. We employ observations of carbon monoxide (12CO and\n13CO), atomic carbon, ionized carbon, and atomic hydrogen to analyze the\nchemical and physical properties of the core and envelope of L1599B, a\nmolecular cloud forming a portion of the ring at approximately 27 pc from the\nstar Lambda Ori. The O III star provides an asymmetric radiation field that\nproduces a moderate enhancement of the external radiation field. Observations\nof the [CII] fine structure line with the GREAT instrument on SOFIA indicate a\nsignificant enhanced emission on the side of the cloud facing the star, while\nthe [Ci], 12CO and 13CO J = 1-0 and 2-1, and 12CO J = 3-2 data from the PMO and\nAPEX telescopes suggest a relatively typical cloud interior. The atomic, ionic,\nand molecular line centroid velocities track each other very closely, and\nindicate that the cloud may be undergoing differential radial motion. The HI\ndata from the Arecibo GALFA survey and the SOFIA/GREAT [CII] data do not\nsuggest any systematic motion of the halo gas, relative to the dense central\nportion of the cloud traced by 12CO and 13CO.\n", "  In this paper, we show that ultrathin GaN membranes having a thickness of 15\nnm and planar dimensions of 12x184 microns act as memristive devices. This fact\nis due to the migration of the negatively charged deep traps, which form in the\nvolume of the membrane during the fabrication process, towards the unoccupied\nsurface states of the suspended membranes. The time constant of the migration\nprocess is of the order of tens of second and varies with the current or\nvoltage sweep.\n", "  Surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) structures are fabricated with a\nfemtosecond laser for the first time. The inscriptions introduced by the laser\npressurize the fiber and cause its nanoscale effective radius variation. We\ndemonstrate the subangstrom precise fabrication of individual and coupled SNAP\nmicroresonators having the effective radius variation of several nanometers.\nOur results pave the way to a novel ultraprecise SNAP fabrication technology\nbased on the femtosecond laser inscription.\n", "  We define recursion relations for N = 8 supergravity amplitudes using a\ngeneralization of the on-shell diagrams developed for planar N = 4\nsuper-Yang-Mills. Although the recursion relations generically give rise to\nnon-planar on-shell diagrams, we show that at tree-level the recursion can be\nchosen to yield only planar diagrams, the same diagrams occurring in the planar\nN = 4 theory. This implies non-trivial identities for non-planar diagrams as\nwell as interesting relations between the N = 4 and N = 8 theories. We show\nthat the on-shell diagrams of N = 8 supergravity obey equivalence relations\nanalogous to those of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills, and we develop a systematic\nalgorithm for reading off Grassmannian integral formulae directly from the\non-shell diagrams. We also show that the 1-loop 4-point amplitude of N = 8\nsupergravity can be obtained from on-shell diagrams.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a planar array of optical bandpass\nfilters composed of low loss dielectric metasurface layers sandwiched between\ntwo distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). The two DBRs form a Fabry-P\\'erot\nresonator whose center wavelength is controlled by the design of the\ntransmissive metasurface layer which functions as a phase shifting element. We\ndemonstrate an array of bandpass filters with spatially varying center\nwavelengths covering a wide range of operation wavelengths of 250 nm around\n{\\lambda} = 1550 nm ({\\Delta}{\\lambda}/{\\lambda} = 16%). The center wavelengths\nof each filter are independently controlled only by changing the in-plane\ngeometry of the sandwiched metasurfaces, and the experimentally measured\nquality factors are larger than 700. The demonstrated filter array can be\ndirectly integrated on top of photodetector arrays to realize on-chip\nhigh-resolution spectrometers with free-space coupling.\n", "  Penta-graphene (PG) has been identified as a novel 2D material with an\nintrinsic bandgap, which makes it especially promising for electronics\napplications. In this work, we use first-principles lattice dynamics and\niterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to\ndetermine the thermal conductivity of PG and its more stable derivative -\nhydrogenated penta-graphene (HPG). As a comparison, we also studied the effect\nof hydrogenation on graphene thermal conductivity. In contrast to hydrogenation\nof graphene, which leads to a dramatic decrease in thermal conductivity (from\n3590 to 1328 W/mK - a 63% reduction), HPG shows a notable increase in thermal\nconductivity (615 W/mK), which is 76% higher than that of PG (350 W/mK). The\nhigh thermal conductivity of HPG makes it more thermally conductive than most\nother semi-conducting 2D materials, such as the transition metal chalcogenides.\nOur detailed analyses show that the primary reason for the counter-intuitive\nhydrogenation-induced thermal conductivity enhancement is the weaker bond\nanharmonicity in HPG than PG. This leads to weaker phonon scattering after\nhydrogenation, despite the increase in the phonon scattering phase space. The\nhigh thermal conductivity of HPG may inspire intensive research around HPG and\nother derivatives of PG as potential materials for future nanoelectronic\ndevices. The fundamental physics understood from this study may open up a new\nstrategy to engineer thermal transport properties of other 2D materials by\ncontrolling bond anharmonicity via functionalization.\n", "  We give a simplified proof of the nonexistence of large nuclei in the liquid\ndrop model and provide an explicit bound. Our bound is within a factor of 2.3\nof the conjectured value and seems to be the first quantitative result.\n", "  We study the problem of two interacting particles in the classical Harper\nmodel in the regime when one-particle motion is absolutely bounded inside one\ncell of periodic potential. The interaction between particles breaks\nintegrability of classical motion leading to emergence of Hamiltonian dynamical\nchaos. At moderate interactions and certain energies above the mobility edge\nthis chaos leads to a chaotic propulsion of two particles with their diffusive\nspreading over the whole space both in one and two dimensions. At the same time\nthe distance between particles remains bounded by one or two periodic cells\ndemonstrating appearance of new composite quasi-particles called chaons. The\neffect of chaotic delocalization of chaons is shown to be rather general being\npresent for Coulomb and short range interactions. It is argued that such\ndelocalized chaons can be observed in experiments with cold atoms and ions in\noptical lattices.\n", "  Starting from the amplitude with an arbitrary number of massless closed\nstates of the bosonic string, we compute the soft limit when one of the states\nbecomes soft to subsubleading order in the soft momentum expansion, and we show\nthat when the soft state is a graviton or a dilaton, the full string amplitude\ncan be expressed as a soft theorem through subsubleading order. It turns out\nthat there are string corrections to the field theoretical limit in the case of\na soft graviton, while for a soft dilaton the string corrections vanish. We\nthen show that the new soft theorems, including the string corrections, can be\nsimply obtained from the exchange diagrams where the soft state is attached to\nthe other external states through the three-point string vertex of three\nmassless states. In the soft-limit, the propagator of the exchanged state is\ndivergent, and at tree-level these are the only divergent contributions to the\nfull amplitude. However, they do not form a gauge invariant subset and must be\nsupplemented with extra non-singular terms. The requirement of gauge invariance\nthen fixes the complete amplitude through subsubleading order in the soft\nexpansion, reproducing exactly what one gets from the explicit calculation in\nstring theory. From this it is seen that the string corrections at\nsubsubleading order arise as a consequence of the three-point amplitude having\nstring corrections in the bosonic string. When specialized to a soft dilaton,\nit remarkably turns out that the string corrections vanish and that the\nnon-singular piece of the subsubleading term of the dilaton soft theorem is the\ngenerator of space-time special conformal transformation.\n", "  The recently developed semi-local improved chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction\nis used for the first time to study several electromagnetic and weak processes\nat energies below the pion production threshold. Cross sections and selected\npolarization observables for deuteron photodisintegration, nucleon-deuteron\nradiative capture, three-body $^3$He photodisintegration as well as capture\nrates for decays of the muonic $^2$H and $^3$He atoms are calculated. The\nLippmann-Schwinger and Faddeev equations in momentum space are solved to obtain\nnuclear states. The electromagnetic current operator is taken as a single\nnucleon current supplemented by many-body contributions induced via the Siegert\ntheorem. For muon capture processes the nonrelativistic weak current together\nwith the dominant relativistic corrections is used. Our results compare well\nwith experimental data, demonstrating the same quality as is observed for the\nsemi-phenomenological AV18 potential. Compared to the older version of the\nchiral potential with a nonlocal regularization, a much smaller cut-off\ndependence is found for the state-of-art chiral local interaction employed in\nthis paper. Finally, estimates of errors due to the truncation of the chiral\nexpansion are given.\n", "  The thermodynamics of quantum systems coupled to periodically modulated heat\nbaths and work reservoirs is developed. By identifying affinities and fluxes,\nthe first and second law are formulated consistently. In the linear response\nregime, entropy production becomes a quadratic form in the affinities.\nSpecializing to Lindblad-dynamics, we identify the corresponding kinetic\ncoefficients in terms of correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics.\nReciprocity relations follow from symmetries with respect to time reversal. The\nkinetic coefficients can be split into a classical and a quantum contribution\nsubject to a new constraint, which follows from a natural detailed balance\ncondition. This constraint implies universal bounds on efficiency and power of\nquantum heat engines. In particular, we show that Carnot efficiency can not be\nreached whenever quantum coherence effects are present, i.e., when the\nHamiltonian used for work extraction does not commute with the bare system\nHamiltonian. For illustration, we specialize our universal results to a driven\ntwo-level system in contact with a heat bath of sinusoidally modulated\ntemperature.\n", "  Two theoretical frameworks have been widely used to understand the response\nof monsoons to local and remote forcings: the vertically integrated atmospheric\nenergy budget and convective quasi-equilibrium (CQE). Existing forms of these\nframeworks neglect some of the complexities of monsoons, such as the shallow\nmeridional circulations that advect dry air from adjacent deserts into the\nmiddle and lower troposphere of monsoon regions. Here the fidelity of energy\nbudget and CQE theories for monsoon location is assessed in a three-dimensional\nbeta-plane model with boundary conditions representative of an off-equatorial\ncontinent with a tropical grassland and an adjacent subtropical desert. Energy\nbudget theories show mixed success for various SST and land surface albedo\nforcings, with the ITCZ being collocated with the energy flux equator but a\nnon-monotonic relationship existing between ITCZ latitude and cross-equatorial\nenergy transport. Accounting for the off-equatorial position of the unperturbed\nenergy flux equator is shown to be important when a linearization of meridional\nenergy transports is used to quantitatively diagnose ITCZ location. CQE\ntheories that diagnose ITCZ location based on the subcloud moist static energy\nmaximum are shown to have large biases; accounting for convective entrainment\nof dry air by using a lower-tropospheric mean moist static energy provides a\nmore correct diagnosis of ITCZ location. Finally, it is shown that although\nITCZ shifts can be diagnosed by modified CQE and energy budget frameworks,\nneither can be used in a quantitatively prognostic capacity due to\nunpredictable feedbacks that are often larger than the imposed forcing.\n", "  In quantum field theory, charged particles with spin $\\geq 1$ may become\ntachyonic in the present of magnetic fluxes above some critical field,\nsignaling an instability of the vacuum. The phenomenon is generic, in\nparticular, similar instabilities are known to exist in open and closed string\ntheory, where a spinning string state can become tachyonic above a critical\nfield. In compactifications involving RR fluxes $F_{p+2}$, the quantum states\nwhich could become tachyonic by the same Nielsen-Olesen mechanism are Dp\nbranes. By constructing an appropriate background with RR magnetic flux that\ntakes into account back-reaction, we identify the possible tachyonic Dp brane\nstates and compute the formula for the energy spectrum in a sector. More\ngenerally, we argue that in any background RR magnetic flux, there are high\nspin Dp quantum states which become very light at critical fields.\n", "  We investigate the 750 GeV diphoton excess in terms of supersymmetric models\nwhich preserve grand unification in the ultraviolet. We show that minimal\nextensions of the MSSM by a singlet and a vector-like 5-plet or 10-plet of\nSU(5) can explain the observed signal while remaining perturbative up to the\nGUT scale. Different from previous analyses we rely on light sfermions in the\nloops which - compared to the analog non-supersymmetric models - enhance the\ndiphoton cross section by up to a factor of seven. While the resonance decay\nwidth is narrow, mass splitting of the scalar and pseudoscalar components may\nresult in a double resonance. We perform a likelihood analysis on the ATLAS and\nCMS data to show that the significance of the diphoton excess increases from\n3.3 sigma (single narrow resonance) to 3.9 sigma for the double resonance. We\nalso provide signal predictions in other diboson channels to be tested at\nLHC-13.\n", "  Motivated by the issue of particle-hole symmetry for the composite fermion\nFermi sea at the half filled Landau level, Dam T. Son has made an intriguing\nproposal [Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 5}, 031027 (2015)] that composite fermions are\nDirac particles. We ask what features of the Dirac-composite fermion theory and\nits various consequences may be reconciled with the well established\nmicroscopic theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and the 1/2 state,\nwhich is based on {\\em non-relativistic} composite fermions. Starting from the\nmicroscopic theory, we derive the assertion of Son that the particle-hole\ntransformation of electrons at filling factor $\\nu=1/2$ corresponds to an\neffective time reversal transformation (i.e.\n$\\{\\vec{k}_j\\}$$\\rightarrow$$\\{-\\vec{k}_j\\}$) for composite fermions, and\ndiscuss how this connects to the absence of $2k_{\\rm F}$ backscattering in the\npresence of a particle-hole symmetric disorder. By considering bare holes in\nvarious composite-fermion $\\Lambda$ levels (analogs of electronic Landau\nlevels) we determine the $\\Lambda$ level spacing and find it to be very nearly\nindependent of the $\\Lambda$ level index, consistent with a parabolic\ndispersion for the underlying composite fermions. Finally, we address the\ncompatibility of the Chern-Simons theory with the lowest Landau level\nconstraint, and find that the wave functions of the mean-field Chern-Simons\ntheory, as well as a class of topologically similar wave functions, are\nsurprisingly accurate when projected into the lowest Landau level. These\nconsiderations lead us to introduce a \"normal form\" for the unprojected wave\nfunctions of the $n/(2pn-1)$ states that correctly capture the topological\nproperties even without lowest Landau level projection.\n", "  In this work, we present galaxy stellar and baryonic (stars plus cold gas)\nmass functions (SMF and BMF) and their halo mass dependence for two\nvolume-limited data sets. The first, RESOLVE-B, coincides with the Stripe 82\nfootprint and is extremely complete down to baryonic mass Mbary ~ 10^9.1 Msun,\nprobing the gas-rich dwarf regime below Mbary ~ 10^10 Msun. The second, ECO,\ncovers a ~40 times larger volume (containing RESOLVE-A) and is complete to\nMbary ~ 10^9.4 Msun. To construct the SMF and BMF we implement a new \"cross-bin\nsampling\" technique with Monte Carlo sampling from the full likelihood\ndistributions of stellar or baryonic mass. Our SMFs exhibit the \"plateau\"\nfeature starting below Mstar ~ 10^10 Msun that has been described in prior\nwork. However, the BMF fills in this feature and rises as a straight power law\nbelow ~10^10 Msun, as gas-dominated galaxies become the majority of the\npopulation. Nonetheless, the low-mass slope of the BMF is not as steep as that\nof the theoretical dark matter halo MF. Moreover, we assign group halo masses\nby abundance matching, finding that the SMF and BMF separated into four\nphysically motivated halo mass regimes reveal complex structure underlying the\nsimple shape of the overall MFs. In particular, the satellite MFs are depressed\nbelow the central galaxy MF \"humps\" in groups with mass <10^13.5 Msun yet rise\nsteeply in clusters. Our results suggest that satellite destruction and/or\nstripping are active from the point of nascent group formation. We show that\nthe key role of groups in shaping MFs enables reconstruction of a given\nsurvey's SMF or BMF based on its group halo mass distribution.\n", "  The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe\nobservables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since\nthen, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the\noutcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of\nintegrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review\ndiscusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization\nin integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which\nobservables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of\nthe bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are\nthe differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems\nand in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the\nGGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a\nlot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have\nbeen given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field\nIsing model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show\nthat the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This\nmakes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real\nspace for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a\nspectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed\nthat generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core\nbosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of\nconserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables.\nHere we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the\ntransverse field Ising model.\n", "  We derive horizontal fluid motions on the solar surface over large areas\ncovering the quiet-Sun magnetic network from local correlation tracking of\nconvective granules imaged in continuum intensity and Doppler velocity by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). From these we calculate horizontal divergence, vertical component of\nvorticity, and kinetic helicity of fluid motions. We study the correlations\nbetween fluid divergence and vorticity, and that between vorticity (kinetic\nhelicity) and magnetic field. We find that the vorticity (kinetic helicity)\naround small-scale fields exhibits a hemispherical pattern (in sign) similar to\nthat followed by the magnetic helicity of large-scale active regions\n(containing sunspots). We identify this pattern to be a result of the Coriolis\nforce acting on supergranular-scale flows (both the outflows and inflows), and\nis consistent with earlier studies using local helioseismology. Further, we\nshow that the magnetic fields cause transfer of vorticity from supergranular\ninflow regions to outflow regions, and that they tend to suppress the vortical\nmotions around them when magnetic flux densities exceed about 300 G (HMI). We\nalso show that such action of magnetic fields leads to marked changes in the\ncorrelations between fluid divergence and vorticity. These results are\nspeculated to be of importance to local dynamo action if present, and to the\ndynamical evolution of magnetic helicity at the small-scale.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond bursts of radio radiation whose\nprogenitors so far remain mysterious. Nevertheless, the timescales and\nenergetics of the events have lead to many theories associating FRBs with young\nneutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young\nsupernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational\nconsequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back\nthrough the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)\nassociated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is\nhigh are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on\nthe mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies\nof $400\\,{\\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\\,{\\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\\sim100-500\\,{\\rm\nyrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high\nenough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs\nare powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the\nNS must have a magnetic field $\\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\\,{\\rm G}$ to ensure that\nit does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at\nradio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs\nand their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be\nconstrained.\n", "  We develop a novel technique for modeling of atomic and molecular ionization\nin superposition of XUV and IR fields with characteristics typical for\nattosecond streaking and RABBITT experiments. The method is based on solving\nthe time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in the coordinate frame expanding\nalong with the photoelectron wave packet. The efficiency of the method is\ndemonstrated by calculating angular anisotropy of photoemission time delay of\nthe H$_2^+$ ion in a field configuration of recent RABBITT experiments.\n", "  We find a geometrical description from a field theoretical setup based on\nWilson's renormalization group in real space. We show that renormalization\ngroup equations of coupling parameters encode the metric structure of an\nemergent curved space, regarded to be an Einstein equation for the emergent\ngravity. Self-consistent equations of local order-parameter fields with an\nemergent metric turn out to describe low energy dynamics of a strongly coupled\nfield theory, analogous to the Maxwell equation of the Einstein-Maxwell theory\nin the AdS$_{d+2}$/CFT$_{d+1}$ duality conjecture. We claim that the\nAdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ duality may be interpreted as Landau-Ginzburg theory\ncombined with Wilson's renormalization group, which introduces vertex\ncorrections into the Landau-Ginzburg theory in the large$-N_{s}$ limit, where\n$N_{s}$ is the number of fermion flavors.\n", "  Crossed magnetic responses between spin and orbital angular momentum are\nstudied in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators. Due to spin-orbit\ncoupling in the quantum spin Hall systems and three-dimensional topological\ninsulators, the magnetic susceptibility has crossed (intersectional) components\nbetween spin and orbital part of magnetism. In this study, the crossed\nsusceptibility for the orbital magnetization is studied in two- and\nthree-dimensional topological insulator models, in which an external magnetic\nfield interacts with the electron spin by Zeeman coupling via distinct\ng-factors for conduction and valence energy bands. The crossed susceptibility\nin two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators shows a quantized signature of\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in response to Zeeman coupling via an\naveraged g-factor, and the quantization persists even when\n$\\sigma^z$-conservation of electrons is broken by a tilted magnetic field. The\nbulk orbital magnetization is interpreted by the persistent edge current\nattributed to the chiral anomaly at the (1+1)-dimensional boundary. In\nthree-dimensional topological insulators, we found that the crossed\nsusceptibility is proportional to the difference of g-factors of conduction and\nvalence electrons, which is qualitatively different from the two-dimensional\ncase. Steep changes of the crossed susceptibility in three dimensions at the\nphase transition points are explained by the surface Dirac fermion theory.\nFinally, dependence of the crossed susceptibility on g-factors in two- and\nthree-dimensional cases is discussed from the viewpoint of time-reversal and\nparticle-hole symmetries.\n", "  We show that the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect can induce a persistent flow in a\nBose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules confined in a toroidal trap, with\nthe dipolar interaction mediated via an electric dipole moment. For\nBose-Einstein condensates of atoms with a magnetic dipole moment, we show that\nalthough it is theoretically possible to induce persistent flow via the\nAharonov-Casher effect, the strength of electric field required is prohibitive.\nWe also outline an experimental geometry tailored specifically for observing\nthe He-McKellar-Wilkens effect in toroidally-trapped condensates.\n", "  We analyse the dynamical response of a range of 3D Kitaev quantum\nspin-liquids, using lattice models chosen to explore the different possible\nlow-energy spectra for gapless Majorana fermions, with either Fermi surfaces,\nnodal lines or Weyl points. We find that the behaviour of the dynamical\nstructure factor is distinct in all three cases, reflecting the quasiparticle\ndensity of states in two fundamentally different ways. First, the low-energy\nresponse is either straightforwardly related to the power with which the\nlow-energy density of states vanishes; or for a non-vanishing density of\nstates, to the phase shifts encountered in the corresponding X-ray edge\nproblem, whose phenomenology we extend to the case of Majorana fermions.\nSecond, at higher energies, there is a rich fine-structure, determined by\nmicroscopic features of the Majorana spectrum. Our theoretical results test the\nusefulness of inelastic neutron scattering as a probe of these quantum spin\nliquids: we find that although spin flips fractionalise, the main features of\nthe dynamical spin response nevertheless admit straightforward interpretations\nin terms of Majorana and flux loop excitations.\n", "  We present the first study of evolution of galaxy groups in the Illustris\nsimulation. We focus on dynamically relaxed and unrelaxed galaxy groups\nrepresenting dynamically evolved and evolving galaxy systems, respectively. The\nevolutionary state of a group is probed from its luminosity gap and separation\nbetween the brightest group galaxy and the center of mass of the group members.\nWe find that the Illustris simulation, over-produces large luminosity gap\ngalaxy systems, known as fossil systems, in comparison to observations and the\nprobed semi-analytical predictions. However, this simulation is equally\nsuccessful in recovering the correlation between luminosity gap and luminosity\ncentroid offset, in comparison to the probed semi-analytic model. We find\nevolutionary tracks based on luminosity gap which indicate that a large\nluminosity gap group is rooted in a small luminosity gap group, regardless of\nthe position of the brightest group galaxy within the halo. This simulation\nhelps, for the first time, to explore the black hole mass and its accretion\nrate in galaxy groups. For a given stellar mass of the brightest group\ngalaxies, the black hole mass is larger in dynamically relaxed groups with a\nlower rate of mass accretion. We find this consistent with the latest\nobservational studies of the radio activities in the brightest group galaxies\nin fossil groups. We also find that the IGM in dynamically evolved groups is\nhotter for a given halo mass than that in evolving groups, again consistent\nwith earlier observational studies.\n", "  We study the quantum walks of two interacting spin-1 bosons. We derive an\nexact solution for the time-dependent wave function that describes the\ntwo-particle dynamics governed by the one-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. We show that propagation dynamics in real space and mixing dynamics in\nspin space are correlated via the spin-dependent interaction in this system.\nThe spin-mixing dynamics has two characteristic frequencies in the limit of\nlarge spin-dependent interactions. One of the characteristic frequencies is\ndetermined by the energy difference between two bound states, and the other\nfrequency relates to the cotunneling process of a pair of spin-1 bosons.\nFurthermore, we numerically analyze the growth of the spin correlations in\nquantum walks. We find that long-range spin correlations emerge showing a clear\ndependence on the sign of the spin-dependent interaction and the initial state.\n", "  We report the discovery of a planet by the microlensing method,\nOGLE-2012-BLG-0724Lb. Although the duration of the planetary signal for this\nevent was one of the shortest seen for a planetary event, the anomaly was well\ncovered thanks to high cadence observations taken by the survey groups OGLE and\nMOA. By analyzing the light curve, this planetary system is found to have a\nmass ratio $q=(1.58\\pm0.15)\\times10^{-3}$. By conducting a Bayesian analysis,\nwe estimate that the host star is an M-dwarf star with a mass of $M_{\\rm\nL}=0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.33} \\ M_{\\odot}$ located at $D_{\\rm L}=6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1} \\\n{\\rm kpc}$ away from the Earth and the companion's mass is $m_{\\rm\nP}=0.47_{-0.26}^{+0.54} \\ M_{\\rm Jup}$. The projected planet-host separation is\n$a_{\\perp}=1.6_{-0.3}^{+0.4} \\ {\\rm AU}$. Because the lens-source relative\nproper motion is relatively high, future high resolution images would detect\nthe lens host star and determine the lens properties uniquely. This system is\nlikely a Saturn-mass exoplanet around an M-dwarf and such systems are commonly\ndetected by gravitational microlensing. This adds an another example of a\npossible pileup of sub-Jupiters $(0.2 < m_{\\rm P}/M_{\\rm Jup} < 1)$ in contrast\nto a lack of Jupiters ($\\sim 1 - 2 \\ M_{\\rm Jup}$) around M-dwarfs, supporting\nthe prediction by core accretion models that Jupiter-mass or more massive\nplanets are unlikely to form around M-dwarfs.\n", "  We present a deterministic scheme for generating large-scale atomic W states\nin cavity QED system via a simple expansion mechanism, which is realized only\nby a detuned interaction between two identical atoms and a vacuum cavity mode.\nWith the presented scheme, a W-type Bell pair can be created and an n-atom W\nstate can be expanded to a 2n-atom W state with a unit probability of success\nin principle. No multi-atom gates, quantum memories or quantum non-demolition\nmeasurements are required, greatly simplifying the experimental realization of\nthe scheme. The feasibility analysis shows that our expansion scheme can be\nimplemented with state-of-the-art technologies. Our scheme enables advances not\nonly in quantum information and communication but also in quantum\nthermodynamics, where atomic W states plays a crucial role.\n", "  We have performed a spectral decomposition to search for recoiling\nsupermassive black holes (rSMBH) in the SDSS QSOs with $z<0.25$. Out of 1271\nQSOs, we have identified 26 rSMBH candidates that are recoiling toward us. The\nprojected recoil velocities range from $-76\\ \\kms$ to $-307\\ \\kms$ with a mean\nof $-149\\pm58\\ \\kms$. Most of the rSMBH candidates are hosted by gas-rich\nLIRGs/ULIRGs, but only 23\\% of them shows signs of tidal features suggesting\nmajority of them are advanced mergers. We find that the black hole masses\n$M_{BH}$ of the rSMBH candidates are on average $\\sim$5 times smaller than that\nof their stationary counterparts and cause a scatter in $M_{BH}-\\sigma_*$\nrelation. The Eddington ratios of all of the rSMBH candidates are larger than\n0.1, with mean of 0.52$\\pm$0.27, suggesting they are actively accreting mass.\nVelocity shifts in high-excitation coronal lines suggest that the rSMBH\ncandidates are recoiling with an average velocity of about $-265\\ \\kms$.\nElectron density in the narrow line region of the H II rSMBH candidates is\nabout 1/10 of that in AGN rSMBH candidates probably because AGN in the former\nwas more spatially offset than that in the latter. The estimated spatial\noffsets between the rSMBH candidate and center of host galaxy range from\n0.21\\as \\ to 1.97\\as \\ and need to be confirmed spatially with high-resolution\nadaptive optics imaging observations.\n", "  A novel fiber-coupled ITO coated glass slide sensor for performing surface\nplasmon polariton chemical monitoring in the 3.5 um mid-IR range is reported.\nEfficient mid-IR fiber coupling is achieved with 3D laser written waveguides,\nand the coupling of glass waveguide modes to ITO SPPs is driven by the varying\nphase matching conditions of different aqueous analytes across the anomalous\ndispersion range determined by their molecular fingerprints. By means of using\nboth a mid-IR fiber supercontinuum source and a diode laser the excitation of\nSPPs is demonstrated. The efficient optical monitoring of mid-IR SPPs in smart\nglass could have a broad range of applications in biological and chemical\nsensing.\n", "  The control of quantum systems requires the ability to change and read-out\nthe phase of a system. The non-commutativity of canonical conjugate operators\ncan induce phases on quantum systems, which can be employed for implementing\nphase gates and for precision measurements. Here we study the phase acquired by\na radiation field after its radiation pressure interaction with a mechanical\noscillator, and compare the classical and quantum contributions. The classical\ndescription can reproduce the nonlinearity induced by the mechanical oscillator\nand the loss of correlations between mechanics and optical field at certain\ninteraction times. Such features alone are therefore insufficient for probing\nthe quantum nature of the interaction. Our results thus isolate genuine quantum\ncontributions of the optomechanical interaction that could be probed in current\nexperiments.\n", "  The dynamical influence of binary companions is expected to profoundly\ninfluence planetary systems. However, the difficulty of identifying planets in\nbinary systems has left the magnitude of this effect uncertain; despite\nnumerous theoretical hurdles to their formation and survival, at least some\nbinary systems clearly host planets. We present high-resolution imaging of 382\nKepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) obtained using adaptive-optics imaging and\nnonredundant aperture-mask interferometry (NRM) on the Keck-II telescope. Among\nthe full sample of 506 candidate binary companions to KOIs, we super-resolve\nsome binary systems to projected separations of <5 AU, showing that planets\nmight form in these dynamically active environments. However, the full\ndistribution of projected separations for our planet-host sample more broadly\nreveals a deep paucity of binary companions at solar-system scales. For a field\nbinary population, we should have found 58 binary companions with projected\nseparation \\rho < 50 AU and mass ratio q > 0.4; we instead only found 23\ncompanions (a 4.6 sigma deficit), many of which must be wider pairs that are\nonly close in projection. When the binary population is parametrized with a\nsemimajor axis cutoff a_cut and a suppression factor inside that cutoff S_bin,\nwe find with correlated uncertainties that inside a_cut = 47 +59/-23 AU, the\nplanet occurrence rate in binary systems is only S_bin = 0.34 +0.14/-0.15 times\nthat of wider binaries or single stars. Our results demonstrate that a fifth of\nall solar-type stars in the Milky Way are disallowed from hosting planetary\nsystems due to the influence of a binary companion.\n", "  We introduce a technique to compute exact anelastic sensitivity kernels in\nthe time domain using parsimonious disk storage. The method is based on a\nreordering of the time loop of time-domain forward/adjoint wave propagation\nsolvers combined with the use of a memory buffer. It avoids instabilities that\noccur when time-reversing dissipative wave propagation simulations. The total\nnumber of required time steps is unchanged compared to usual acoustic or\nelastic approaches. The cost is reduced by a factor of 4/3 compared to the case\nin which anelasticity is partially accounted for by accommodating the effects\nof physical dispersion. We validate our technique by performing a test in which\nwe compare the $K_\\alpha$ sensitivity kernel to the exact kernel obtained by\nsaving the entire forward calculation. This benchmark confirms that our\napproach is also exact. We illustrate the importance of including full\nattenuation in the calculation of sensitivity kernels by showing significant\ndifferences with physical-dispersion-only kernels.\n", "  We non-perturbatively determine the renormalization factor of the axial\nvector current in lattice QCD with $N_f=3$ flavors of Wilson-clover fermions\nand the tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. The (by now standard)\nrenormalization condition is derived from the massive axial Ward identity and\nit is imposed among Schr\\\"{o}dinger functional states with large overlap on the\nlowest lying hadronic state in the pseudoscalar channel, in order to reduce\nkinematically enhanced cutoff effects. We explore a range of couplings relevant\nfor simulations at lattice spacings of $\\approx 0.09$ fm and below. An\ninterpolation formula for $Z_A(g_0^2)$, smoothly connecting the\nnon-perturbative values to the 1-loop expression, is provided together with our\nfinal results.\n", "  Developments in optoelectronics and spin-optronics based on transition metal\ndichalcogenide monolayers (MLs) need materials with efficient optical emission\nand well-defined transition energies. In as-exfoliated MoS2 MLs the\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra even at low temperature consists typically of\nbroad, overlapping contributions from neutral, charged excitons (trions) and\nlocalized states. Here we show that in superacid treated MoS2 MLs the PL\nintensity increases by up to 60 times at room temperature. The neutral and\ncharged exciton transitions are spectrally well separated in PL and\nreflectivity at T=4 K, with linewidth for the neutral exciton of 15 meV, but\nwith similar intensities compared to the ones in as-exfoliated MLs at the same\ntemperature. Time resolved experiments uncover picoseconds recombination\ndynamics analyzed separately for charged and neutral exciton emission. Using\nthe chiral interband selection rules, we demonstrate optically induced valley\npolarization for both complexes and valley coherence for only the neutral\nexciton.\n", "  We perform a theoretical study of the dynamics of the electric field\nexcitations in a microtubule by taking into consideration the realistic\ncylindrical geometry, dipole-dipole interactions of the tubulin-based protein\nheterodimers, the radial electric field produced by the solvent, and a possible\ndegeneracy of energy states of individual heterodimers. The consideration is\ndone in the frames of the classical pseudo-spin model. We derive the system of\nnonlinear dynamical ordinary differential equations of motion for interacting\ndipoles, and the continuum version of these equations. We obtain the solutions\nof these equations in the form of snoidal waves, solitons, kinks, and localized\nspikes. Our results will help to a better understanding of the functional\nproperties of microtubules including the motor protein dynamics and the\ninformation transfer processes. Our considerations are based on classical\ndynamics. Some speculations on the role of possible quantum effects are also\nmade.\n", "  A new class of high-contrast image analysis algorithms that empirically fit\nand subtract systematic noise has lead to recent discoveries of faint exoplanet\n/substellar companions and scattered light images of circumstellar disks. These\nmethods are extremely efficient at enhancing the detectability of faint\nastrophysical signal, but they do generally create systematic biases in their\nobserved properties. This paper provides a general solution for this\noutstanding problem. We present the analytical derivation of a linear expansion\nthat captures the impact of astrophysical over-subtraction and/or\nself-subtraction these image analysis techniques. We examine the general case\nfor which the reference images of the astrophysical scene move azimuthally\nand/or radially across the field of view as a result of the observation\nstrategy. Our new method is based on perturbing the covariance matrix\nunderlying any least-squares speckles problem, and propagating this\nperturbation through the data analysis algorithm. We then demonstrate practical\napplications of this new algorithm. We first consider the case of the spectral\nextraction of faint point sources in IFS data and illustrate, using public\nGemini Planet Imager commissioning data, that our novel perturbation-based\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve Image Processing Forward Modeling (KLIP-FM) can indeed\nalleviate algorithmic biases. We then apply KLIP-FM to the problem associated\nwith the detection of point sources. We show how it decreases the rate of false\nnegatives (e.g missed planets) while keeping the rate of false positives\nunchanged when compared to classical least-squares fitting methods. This can\npotentially have important consequences on the design of follow-up strategies\nof ongoing direct imaging surveys.\n", "  The amount of data produced by highly granular silicon tracking detectors in\nhigh energy physics experiments poses a major challenge to readout systems. At\nhigh collision rates, e.g. at LHC experiments, only a small fraction of data\ncan be read out with currently used technologies. To cope with the requirements\nof future or upgraded experiments new data transfer techniques are required\nwhich offer high data rates at low power and low material budget. Wireless\ntechnologies operating in the 60 GHz band or at higher frequencies offer high\ndata rates and are thus a promising upcoming alternative to conventional data\ntransmission via electrical cables or optical fibers. Using wireless\ntechnology, the amount of cables and connectors in detectors can be\nsignificantly reduced. Tracking detectors profit most from a reduced material\nbudget as fewer secondary particle interactions (multiple Coulomb scattering,\nenergy loss, etc.) improve the tracking performance in general. We present\nfeasibility studies regarding the integration of the wireless technology at 60\nGHz into a silicon tracking detector. Spare silicon strip modules of the ATLAS\nexperiment are measured to be opaque in the 60 GHz range. The reduction of\ncross talk between links is studied. An estimate of the maximum achievable link\ndensity is given. It is shown that wireless links can be placed as close as 2\ncm next to each other for a layer distance of 10 cm by exploiting one or\nseveral of the following measures: highly directive antennas, absorbers, linear\npolarization and frequency channeling. Combining these measures, a data rate\narea density of up to 11 Tb/(s $\\cdot$ m$^2$) seems feasible. In addition, two\ntypes of silicon sensors are tested under mm-wave irradiation . No\ndeterioration of the performance of both prototypes is observed.\n", "  Each of the nearby triple systems HIP 7601, 13498, 23824, and 113597 (HD\n10800, 18198, 35877, 217389) consists of solar-type dwarfs with comparable\nmasses, where all three components are resolved spectrally, while the outer\npairs are resolved both visually and spectrally. These stars are relatively\nyoung (between 100 and 600 Myr) and chromospherically active (X-ray sources),\nalthough they rotate slowly. Spectroscopic orbits of the inner subsystems\n(periods 19.4, 14.1, 5.6, 20.3 days) and orbits of the outer systems (periods\n1.75, 51, 27, 500 yrs, respectively) are determined. For HIP 7601 and 13498,\nthe combined spectro-interferometric outer orbits produce direct measurement of\nmasses of all components, allowing comparison with stellar models. The 6708A\nlithium line is present and its strength is measured in each component\nindividually by subtracting the contributions of other components. The inner\nand outer orbits of HIP 7601 are nearly circular, likely co-planar, and have a\nmodest period ratio of 1:33. This study contributes to the characterization of\nhierarchical multiplicity in the solar neighborhood and provides data for\ntesting stellar evolutionary models and chronology.\n", "  Seven spectroscopic orbits in nearby solar-type multiple stars are presented.\nThe primary of the chromospherically active star HIP 9642 is a 4.8-day\ndouble-lined pair; the outer 420-yr visual orbit is updated, but remains poorly\nconstrained. HIP 12780 is a quadruple system consisting of the resolved 6.7-yr\npair FIN 379 Aa,Ab, for which the combined orbit, masses, and orbital parallax\nare determined here, and the single-lined binary Ba,Bb with a period of 27.8\ndays. HIP 28790 is a young quintuple system composed of two close binaries\nAa,Ab and Ba,Bb with periods of 221 and 13 days, respectively, and a single\ndistant component C. Its subsystem Ba,Bb is peculiar, having the spectroscopic\nmass ratio of 0.89 but a magnitude difference of ~2.2 mag. HIP 64478 also\ncontains five stars: the A-component is a 29-year visual pair with a previously\nknown 4-day twin subsystem, while the B-component is a contact binary with a\nperiod of 5.8 hours, seen nearly pole-on.\n", "  We report on the analysis of two deep XMM-Newton observations of the magnetar\nSwift J1834.9-0846 and its surrounding extended emission taken in March 2014\nand October 2014, 2.5 and 3.1 years after the source went into outburst. The\nmagnetar is only weakly detected in the first observation with an absorption\ncorrected flux $F_{\\rm 0.5-10 keV}\\approx4\\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$, and a $3\\sigma$ upper limit during the second observation of about\n$3\\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. This flux level is more than 3 orders\nof magnitude lower than the flux measured at the outburst onset on September\n2011. The extended emission, centered at the magnetar position and elongated\ntowards the south-west, is clearly seen in both observations; it is best fit by\na highly absorbed power-law (PL), with a hydrogen column density of $N_{\\rm\nH}=8.0\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and PL photon index $\\Gamma=2.2\\pm0.2$. Its flux\nis constant between the two observations at $F_{\\rm 0.5-10\nkeV}=1.3\\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We find no statistically\nsignificant changes in the spectral shape or the flux of this extended emission\nover a period of 9 years from 2005 to 2014. These new results strongly support\nthe extended emission nature as a wind nebula and firmly establish Swift\nJ1834.9-0846 as the first magnetar to show a surrounding wind nebula. Further,\nour results imply that such nebulae are no longer exclusive to rotation-powered\npulsars and narrow the gap between these two sub-populations of isolated\nneutron stars. The size and spectrum of the nebula are compatible with those of\npulsar-wind nebulae but its radiative efficiency $\\eta_{\\rm X}=L_{\\rm\nX}/\\dot{E}\\approx0.1$ is markedly high, possibly pointing to an additional wind\ncomponent in Swift J1834.9-0846.\n", "  Active optics has attracted considerable interest from researchers in\nsynchrotron radiation facilities, because of its capacity for x-ray wavefront\ncorrection. Here, we report a novel and efficient technique for correcting or\nmodulating a mirror surface profile based on laser-heating-induced thermal\nexpansion. An experimental study of the characteristics of the surface thermal\ndeformation response indicates that the power of a milliwatt laser yields a\nbump height as low as sub-nanometer scale, and that variation of the spot size\nmodulates the response function width effectively. In addition, the capacity of\nthe laser-heating technique for free-form surface modulation is demonstrated\nvia a surface correction experiment. The developed method is a promising new\napproach towards effective x-ray active optics coupled with at-wavelength\nmetrology techniques.\n", "  The linearized water-wave radiation problem for an oscillating submerged line\nsource in an inviscid shear flow with a free surface is investigated\nanalytically at finite, constant depth in the presence of a shear flow varying\nlinearly with depth. The surface velocity is taken to be zero relative to the\noscillating source, so that Doppler effects are absent. The radiated wave out\nfrom the source is calculated based on Euler's equation of motion with the\nappropriate boundary and radiation conditions, and differs substantially from\nthe solution obtained by assuming potential flow. To wit, an additional wave is\nfound in the downstream direction in addition to the previously known\ndispersive wave solutions; this wave is non-dispersive and we show how it is\nthe surface manifestation of a critical layer-like flow generated by the\ncombination of shear and mass flux at the source, passively advected with the\nflow. As seen from a system moving at the fluid velocity at the source's depth,\nstreamlines form closed curves in a manner similar to Kelvin's cat's eye\nvortices. A resonant frequency exists at which the critical wave resonates with\nthe downstream propagating wave, resulting in a downstream wave pattern\ndiverging linearly in amplitude away from the source.\n", "  We investigate analytically the linearized water wave radiation problem for\nan oscillating submerged point source in an inviscid shear flow with a free\nsurface. A constant depth is taken into account and the shear flow increases\nlinearly with depth. The surface velocity relative to the source is taken to be\nzero, so that Doppler effects are absent. We solve the linearized Euler\nequations to calculate the resulting wave field as well as its far-field\nasymptotics. For values of the Froude number $F^2=\\omega^2 D/g$ ($\\omega$:\noscillation frequency, $D$ submergence depth) below a resonant value\n$F^2_\\text{res}$ the wave field splits cleanly into separate contributions from\nregular dispersive propagating waves and non-dispersive \"critical waves\"\nresulting from a critical layer-like street of flow structures directly\ndownstream of the source. In the sub-resonant regime the regular waves behave\nlike sheared ring waves while the critical layer wave forms a street of a\nconstant width of order $D\\sqrt{S/\\omega}$ ($S$ is the shear flow vorticity)\nand is convected downstream at the fluid velocity at the depth of the source.\nWhen the Froude number approaches its resonant value, the the downstream\ncritical and regular waves resonate, producing a train of waves of linearly\nincreasing amplitude contained within a downstream wedge.\n", "  Calculations of the electronic and magnetic properties of the non-magnetic\nmetallic compound YFe$_2$Si$_2$ are reported. These show that at the density\nfunctional level a magnetic state involving ordering along the $c$-axis. The\nelectronic structure is three dimensional, and is similar to that of the\nunconventional superconductor YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and as well as that of the high\npressure collapsed tetragonal phase of KFe$_2$As$_2$, which is also a\nsuperconductor. Based on the results in relation to experiment, we infer that\nproperties of YFe$_2$Si$_2$ are strongly influenced by a nearby\nantiferromagnetic quantum critical point.\n", "  We report Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope detections of several long\ncarbon-chain molecules at C and Ku band, including HC3N, HC5N, HC7N, HC9N, C3S,\nC6H and C8H toward the starless cloud Serpens South 1a. We detected some\ntransitions (HC9N J=13-12 F=12-11 and F=14-13, H13CCCN J=2-1 F=1-0 and F=1-1,\nHC13CCN J=2-1 F=2-2, F=1-0 and F=1-1, HCC13CN J=2-1 F=1-0 and F=1-1) and\nresolved some hyperfine components (HC5N J=6-5 F=5-4, H13CCCN J=2-1 F=2-1) for\nthe first time in the interstellar medium. The column densities of these\ncarbon-chain molecules in a range of 10^{12}-10^{13} cm^{-2} are comparable to\ntwo carbon-chain molecule rich sources, TMC-1 and Lupus-1A. The abundance\nratios are 1.00:(1.11\\pm0.15):(1.47\\pm0.18) for [H13CCCN]:[HC13CCN]:[HCC13CN].\nThis result implies that the 13C isotope is also concentrated in the carbon\natom adjacent to the nitrogen atom in HC3N in Serpens south 1a, which is\nsimilar to TMC-1. The [HC3N]/[H13CCCN] ratio of 78\\pm9, the [HC3N]/[HC13CCN]\nratio of 70\\pm8, and the [HC3N]/[HCC13CN] ratio of 53\\pm4 are also comparable\nto those in TMC-1. In any case, Serpens South 1a proves a testing ground for\nunderstanding carbon-chain chemistry.\n", "  Galaxy groups differ from clusters primarily by way of their lower masses,\nM~10^14 M_sun vs. M~10^15 M_sun. We discuss how mass affects the thermal state\nof the intracluster or the intragroup medium, specifically as to their entropy\nlevels and radial profiles. We show that entropy is produced in both cases by\nthe continuing inflow of intergalactic gas across the system boundary into the\ngravitational potential well. The inflow is highly supersonic in clusters, but\nweakly so in groups. The former condition implies strong accretion shocks with\nsubstantial conversion of a large inflow kinetic into thermal energy, whereas\nthe latter condition implies less effective conversion of lower energies. These\nfeatures produce a conspicuous difference in entropy deposition at the current\nboundary. Thereafter, adiabatic compression of the hot gas into the potential\nwell converts such time histories into radial profiles throughout a cluster or\na group. In addition, in both cases a location of the system at low z in the\naccelerating universe or in a poor environment will starve out the inflow and\nthe entropy production, and produce flattening or even bending down of the\nouter profile. We analyze in detail the sharp evidence provided by the two\ngroups ESO 3060170 and RXJ1159+5531 that have been recently observed in X rays\nout to their virial radii, and find a close and detailed match with our\nexpectations.\n", "  Thin metallic films have a 1D quantum well along the surface normal\ndirection, which yields particle-in-a-box style electronic quantum states.\nHowever the quantum well is not infinitely deep and the wavefunctions of these\nstates penetrate outside the surface where the electron is bound by its own\nimage-charge attraction. Therefore a series of discrete, vacant states reach\nout from the thin film into the vacuum increasing the probability of electron\ntransfer from an external atom or molecule to the thin film, especially for the\nresonant case where the quantum well energy matches that of the Rydberg atom.\n  We show that `handshake' electron transfer from a highly excited Rydberg atom\nto these thin-film states is experimentally measurable. Thicker films, have a\nwider 1D box, changing the energetic distribution and image-state contribution\nto the thin film wavefunctions, resulting in more resonances. Calculations\nsuccessfully predict the number of resonances and the nature of the thin-film\nwavefunctions for a given film thickness.\n", "  We frequency stabilize the output of a miniature stimulated Brillouin\nscattering (SBS) laser to rubidium atoms in a microfabricated cell to realize a\nlaser system with frequency stability at the $10^{-11}$ level over seven\ndecades in averaging time. In addition, our system has the advantages of\nrobustness, low cost and the potential for integration that would lead to still\nfurther miniaturization. The SBS laser operating at 1560 nm exhibits a spectral\nlinewidth of 820 Hz, but its frequency drifts over a few MHz on the 1 hour\ntimescale. By locking the second harmonic of the SBS laser to the Rb reference,\nwe reduce this drift by a factor of $10^3$ to the level of a few kHz over the\ncourse of an hour. For our combined SBS and Rb laser system, we measure a\nfrequency noise of $4\\times10^4$ $Hz^2/Hz$ at 10 Hz offset frequency which\nrapidly rolls off to a level of 0.2 $Hz^2/Hz$ at 100 kHz offset. The\ncorresponding Allan deviation is $\\leq2\\times10^{-11}$ for averaging times\nspanning $10^{-4}$ to $10^3$ s. By optically dividing the signal of the laser\ndown to microwave frequencies, we generate an RF signal at 2 GHz with phase\nnoise at the level of -76 dBc/Hz and -140 dBc/Hz at offset frequencies of 10 Hz\nand 10 kHz, respectively.\n", "  Resistive, magnetization, torque, specific heat and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy measurements are carried out on the hole heavily doped\nCsFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. A characteristic temperature $T^*\\sim13$ K,\nwhich is several times higher than the superconducting transition temperature\n$T_c=2.15$ K, is observed and possibly related to the superconducting\nfluctuation or the pseudogap state. A diamagnetic signal detected by torque\nmeasurements starts from the superconducting state, keeps finite and vanishes\ngradually until a temperature near $T^*$. Temperature dependent resistivity and\nspecific heat also show kinks near $T^*$. An asymmetric gap-like feature with\nthe energy of 8.4 meV and a symmetric superconducting related gap of 2.2 meV on\nthe scanning tunneling spectra are detected, and these pseudogap-related\nfeatures disappear at temperatures up to at least 9 K. These observations by\ndifferent experimental tools suggest the possible existence of superconducting\nfluctuation or pseudogap state in the temperature range up to 4 - 6 times of\n$T_c$ in CsFe$_2$As$_2$.\n", "  We argue that the process $pp \\to (\\text{jet} \\gamma)X$, for which a photon\nis observed inside a fully reconstructed jet and is treated as part of the jet,\noffers new probes of the so far little known fragmentation functions for\nphotons. We present a next-to-leading-order QCD calculation of the cross\nsection for this process in the limit that the jet is relatively narrow. We\nalso investigate the background resulting from the two-photon decay of neutral\npions. We present numerical results relevant for possible measurements at the\nLHC and at RHIC. These suggest that $pp \\to (\\text{jet} \\gamma)X$ should\nprovide clean access to the photon fragmentation functions, provided an\nefficient suppression of the background is available in experiment.\n", "  We provide a theory with a monopole of a strongly-interacting hidden U(1)\ngauge symmetry that can explain the 750-GeV diphoton excess reported by ATLAS\nand CMS. The excess results from the resonance of monopole, which is produced\nvia gluon fusion and decays into two photons. In the low energy, there are only\nmesons and a monopole in our model because any baryons cannot be gauge\ninvariant in terms of strongly interacting Abelian symmetry. This is\nadvantageous of our model because there is no unwanted relics around the BBN\nepoch.\n", "  We use scanning near-field optical microscopy to study the response of\nhexagonal boron nitride nanocones at infrared frequencies, where this material\nbehaves as a hyperbolic medium. The obtained images are dominated by a series\nof hot rings that occur on the sloped sidewalls of the nanocones. The ring\npositions depend on the incident laser frequency and the nanocone shape. Both\ndependences are consistent with directional propagation of hyperbolic phonon\npolariton rays that are launched at the edges and zigzag through the interior\nof the nanocones, sustaining multiple internal reflections off the sidewalls.\nAdditionally, we observe a strong overall enhancement of the near-field signal\nat discrete resonance frequencies. These resonances attest to low dielectric\nlosses that permit coherent standing waves of the sub-diffractional polaritons\nto form. We comment on potential applications of such shape-dependent\nresonances and the field concentration at the hot rings.\n", "  We numerically study the scattering coefficients of linear water waves on\nstationary flows above a localized obstacle. We compare the scattering on\ntrans- and subcritical flows, and then focus on the latter which have been used\nin recent analog gravity experiments. The main difference concerns the\nmagnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a\nlarge amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking\nprediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows. This is\ndue to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than some\ncritical value. As a result, subcritical flows display high- and low-frequency\nbehaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. In the\nlow-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied by\nnon-adiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum is\napproximately linear in frequency. By contrast, in the high-frequency regime,\nno simple description seems to exist. In particular, for obstacles similar to\nthose recently used, we observe that the upstream slope still affects the\nscattering on the downstream side because of some residual transmission.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize the integration rules for scattering equations\nto situations where higher-order poles are present. We describe the strategy to\ndeduce the Feynman rules of higher-order poles from known analytic results of\nsimple CHY-integrands, and propose the Feynman rules for single double pole and\ntriple pole as well as duplex-double pole and triplex-double pole structures.\nWe demonstrate the validation and strength of these rules by ample non-trivial\nexamples.\n", "  We use a 1D model to address photochemistry and possible haze formation in\nthe irradiated warm Jupiter, 51 Eridani b. The intended focus was to be carbon,\nbut sulfur photochemistry turns out to be important. The case for organic\nphotochemical hazes is intriguing but falls short of being compelling. If\norganic hazes form, they are likeliest to do so if vertical mixing in 51 Eri b\nis weaker than in Jupiter, and they would be found below the altitudes where\nmethane and water are photolyzed. The more novel result is that photochemistry\nturns H$_2$S into elemental sulfur, here treated as S$_8$. In the cooler\nmodels, S$_8$ is predicted to condense in optically thick clouds of solid\nsulfur particles, whilst in the warmer models S$_8$ remains a vapor along with\nseveral other sulfur allotropes that are both visually striking and potentially\nobservable. For 51 Eri b, the division between models with and without\ncondensed sulfur is at an effective temperature of 700 K, which is within error\nits actual effective temperature; the local temperature where sulfur condenses\nis between 280 and 320 K. The sulfur photochemistry we have discussed is quite\ngeneral and ought to be found in a wide variety of worlds over a broad\ntemperature range, both colder and hotter than the 650-750 K range studied\nhere, and we show that products of sulfur photochemistry will be nearly as\nabundant on planets where the UV irradiation is orders of magnitude weaker than\nit is on 51 Eri b.\n", "  We present results from the largest systematic investigation of broad\nabsorption line (BAL) acceleration to date. We use spectra of 140 quasars from\nthree Sloan Digital Sky Survey programs to search for global velocity offsets\nin BALs over timescales of ~2.5-5.5 years in the quasar rest frame. We\ncarefully select acceleration candidates by requiring monolithic velocity\nshifts over the entire BAL trough, avoiding BALs with velocity shifts that\nmight be caused by profile variability. The CIV BALs of two quasars show\nvelocity shifts consistent with the expected signatures of BAL acceleration,\nand the BAL of one quasar shows a velocity-shift signature of deceleration. In\nour two acceleration candidates, we see evidence that the magnitude of the\nacceleration is not constant over time; the magnitudes of the change in\nacceleration for both acceleration candidates are difficult to produce with a\nstandard disk-wind model or via geometric projection effects. We measure upper\nlimits to acceleration and deceleration for 76 additional BAL troughs and find\nthat the majority of BALs are stable to within about 3% of their mean\nvelocities. The lack of widespread acceleration/deceleration could indicate\nthat the gas producing most BALs is located at large radii from the central\nblack hole and/or is not currently strongly interacting with ambient material\nwithin the host galaxy along our line of sight.\n", "  In this paper we present scanning tunneling microscopy of a large\n$\\textrm{Bi}_2\\textrm{Se}_3$ crystal with superconducting PbBi islands\ndeposited on the surface. Local density of states measurements are consistent\nwith induced superconductivity in the topological surface state with a\ncoherence length of order 540 nm. At energies above the gap the density of\nstates exhibits oscillations due to scattering caused by a nonuniform order\nparameter. Strikingly, the spectra taken on islands also display similar\noscillations along with traces of the Dirac cone, suggesting an inverse\ntopological proximity effect.\n", "  We present results from sensitive, multi-epoch NuSTAR observations of the\nlate-type star-forming galaxy M83 (d=4.6 Mpc), which is the first investigation\nto spatially resolve the hard (E>10 keV) X-ray emission of this galaxy. The\nnuclear region and ~ 20 off-nuclear point sources, including a previously\ndiscovered ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) source, are detected in our NuSTAR\nobservations. The X-ray hardnesses and luminosities of the majority of the\npoint sources are consistent with hard X-ray sources resolved in the starburst\ngalaxy NGC 253. We infer that the hard X-ray emission is most likely dominated\nby intermediate accretion state black hole binaries and neutron star low-mass\nX-ray binaries (Z-sources). We construct the X-ray binary luminosity function\n(XLF) in the NuSTAR band for an extragalactic environment for the first time.\nThe M83 XLF has a steeper XLF than the X-ray binary XLF in NGC 253, consistent\nwith previous measurements by Chandra at softer X-ray energies. The NuSTAR\nintegrated galaxy spectrum of M83 drops quickly above 10 keV, which is also\nseen in the starburst galaxies NGC253, NGC 3310 and NGC 3256. The NuSTAR\nobservations constrain any AGN to be either highly obscured or to have an\nextremely low luminosity of $_{\\sim}^<$10$^{38}$ erg/s (10-30 keV), implying it\nis emitting at a very low Eddington ratio. An X-ray point source consistent\nwith the location of the nuclear star cluster with an X-ray luminosity of a few\ntimes 10$^{38}$ erg/s may be a low-luminosity AGN but is more consistent with\nbeing an X-ray binary.\n", "  We report the magnetization, ac susceptibility, and specific heat of\noptically float-zoned single crystals of Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si, $0.20 \\leq x\n\\leq 0.50$. We determine the magnetic phase diagrams for all major\ncrystallographic directions and cooling histories. After zero-field cooling,\nthe phase diagrams resemble that of the archetypal stoichiometric cubic chiral\nmagnet MnSi. Besides the helical and conical state, we observe a pocket of\nskyrmion lattice phase just below the helimagnetic ordering temperature. At the\nphase boundaries between these states evidence for slow dynamics is observed.\nWhen the sample is cooled in small magnetic fields, the phase pocket of\nskyrmion lattice may persist metastably down to lowest temperatures. Taken\ntogether with the large variation of the transition temperatures, transition\nfields, and the helix wavelength as a function of composition, this hysteresis\nidentifies Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si as an ideal material for future experiments\nexploring, for instance, the topological unwinding of the skyrmion lattice.\n", "  We show that three-dimensional General Relativity, augmented with two vector\nfields, allows for a non-relativistic limit, different from the standard limit\nleading to Newtonian gravity, that results into a well-defined action which is\nof the Chern-Simons type. We show that this three-dimensional `Extended\nBargmann Gravity', after coupling to matter, leads to equations of motion\nallowing a wider class of background geometries than the ones that one\nencounters in Newtonian gravity. We give the supersymmetric generalization of\nthese results and point out an important application in the context of\ncalculating partition functions of non-relativistic field theories using\nlocalization techniques.\n", "  In this contribution I critically revise the alchemical reversible approach\nin the context of the statistical mechanics theory of non covalent bonding in\ndrug receptor systems. I show that most of the pitfalls and entanglements for\nthe binding free energies evaluation in computer simulations are rooted in the\nequilibrium assumption that is implicit in the reversible method. These\ncritical issues can be resolved by using a non-equilibrium variant of the\nalchemical method in molecular dynamics simulations, relying on the production\nof many independent trajectories with a continuous dynamical evolution of an\nexternally driven alchemical coordinate, completing the decoupling of the\nligand in a matter of few tens of picoseconds rather than nanoseconds. The\nabsolute binding free energy can be recovered from the annihilation work\ndistributions by applying an unbiased unidirectional free energy estimate, on\nthe assumption that any observed work distribution is given by a mixture of\nnormal distributions, whose components are identical in either direction of the\nnon-equilibrium process, with weights regulated by the Crooks theorem. I\nfinally show that the inherent reliability and accuracy of the unidirectional\nestimate of the decoupling free energies, based on the production of few\nhundreds of non-equilibrium independent sub-nanoseconds unrestrained alchemical\nannihilation processes, is a direct consequence of the funnel-like shape of the\nfree energy surface in molecular recognition. An application of the technique\non a real drug-receptor system is presented in the companion paper.\n", "  In this paper we describe Kea a new spectroscopic fitting method to derive\nstellar parameters from moderate to low signal/noise, high-resolution spectra.\nWe developed this new tool to analyze the massive data set of the Kepler\nmission reconnaissance spectra that we have obtained at McDonald Observatory.\nWe use Kea to determine effective temperatures (T_eff), metallicity ([Fe/H]),\nsurface gravity (log g) and projected rotational velocity (v sin i). Kea\ncompares the observations to a large library of synthetic spectra that covers a\nwide range of different T_eff, [Fe/H] and log g values. We calibrated Kea on\nobservations of well-characterized standard stars (the Kepler field \"platinum\"\nsample) which range in T_eff from 5000 to 6500 K, in [Fe/H] from -0.5 to +0.4\ndex and in log g from 3.2 to 4.6 dex. We then compared the Kea results from\nreconnaissance spectra of 45 KOIs (Kepler Object of Interest) to stellar\nparameters derived from higher signal/noise spectra obtained with Keck/HIRES.\nWe find typical uncertainties of 100 K in T_eff, 0.12 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.18\ndex in log g.\n", "  The recently reported diphoton excess at the LHC may imply the existence of a\nnew resonance with a mass of about 750 GeV which couples to photons via loops\nof new charged particles. In this letter, we study the possibility to test such\nmodels at the ILC, paying attention to the new charged particles responsible\nfor the diphoton decay of the resonance. We show that they affect the\nscattering processes $e^+e^- \\to f\\bar{f}$ (with $f$ denoting Standard Model\nfermions) at the ILC, which makes it possible to indirectly probe the new\ncharged particles even if they are out of the kinematical reach. We also show\nthat the discriminations of the diphoton models may be possible based on a\nstudy of the angular distributions of $f\\bar{f}$.\n", "  A considerable fraction of the massive quiescent galaxies at \\emph{z}\n$\\approx$ 2, which are known to be much more compact than galaxies of\ncomparable mass today, appear to have a disk. How well can we measure the bulge\nand disk properties of these systems? We simulate two-component model galaxies\nin order to systematically quantify the effects of non-homology in structures\nand the methods employed. We employ empirical scaling relations to produce\nrealistic-looking local galaxies with a uniform and wide range of\nbulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$), and then rescale them to mimic the\nsignal-to-noise ratios and sizes of observed galaxies at \\emph{z} $\\approx$ 2.\nThis provides the most complete set of simulations to date for which we can\nexamine the robustness of two-component decomposition of compact disk galaxies\nat different $B/T$. We confirm that the size of these massive, compact galaxies\ncan be measured robustly using a single S\\'{e}rsic fit. We can measure $B/T$\naccurately without imposing any constraints on the light profile shape of the\nbulge, but, due to the small angular sizes of bulges at high redshift, their\ndetailed properties can only be recovered for galaxies with $B/T$ \\gax\\ 0.2.\nThe disk component, by contrast, can be measured with little difficulty.\n", "  We have performed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments to\ninvestigate the magnetic excitations in the weakly distorted\nface-centered-cubic (fcc) iridate double perovskites La$_2$ZnIrO$_6$ and\nLa$_2$MgIrO$_6$, which are characterized by A-type antiferromagnetic ground\nstates. The powder inelastic neutron scattering data on these geometrically\nfrustrated $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators provide clear evidence for gapped\nspin wave excitations with very weak dispersion. The INS results and\nthermodynamic data on these materials can be reproduced by conventional\nHeisenberg-Ising models with significant uniaxial Ising anisotropy and sizeable\nsecond-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions. Such a uniaxial Ising exchange\ninteraction is symmetry-forbidden on the ideal fcc lattice, so that it can only\narise from the weak crystal distortions away from the ideal fcc limit. This may\nsuggest that even weak distortions in $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators might\nlead to strong exchange anisotropies. More tantalizingly, however, we find an\nalternative viable explanation of the INS results in terms of spin models with\na dominant Kitaev interaction. In contrast to the uniaxial Ising exchange, the\nhighly-directional Kitaev interaction is a type of exchange anisotropy which is\nsymmetry-allowed even on the ideal fcc lattice. The Kitaev model has a magnon\ngap induced by quantum order-by-disorder, while weak anisotropies of the Kitaev\ncouplings generated by the symmetry-lowering due to lattice distortions, can\npin the order and enhance the magnon gap. Our findings highlight how even\nconventional magnetic orders in heavy transition metal oxides may be driven by\nhighly-directional exchange interactions rooted in strong spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We use a Bayesian approach to derive the distance probability distribution\nfor one object from its parallax with measurement uncertainty for two spatial\ndistribution priors, viz. a homogeneous spherical distribution and a\ngalactocentric distribution - applicable for radio pulsars - observed from\nEarth. We investigate the dependence on measurement uncertainty, and show that\na parallax measurement can underestimate or overestimate the actual distance,\ndepending on the spatial distribution prior. We derive the probability\ndistributions for distance and luminosity combined, and for each separately,\nwhen a flux with measurement error for the object is also available, and\ndemonstrate the necessity of and dependence on the luminosity function prior.\nWe apply this to estimate the distance and the radio and gamma-ray luminosities\nof PSR J0218+4232. The use of realistic priors improves the quality of the\nestimates for distance and luminosity, compared to those based on measurement\nonly. Use of a wrong prior, for example a homogeneous spatial distribution\nwithout upper bound, may lead to very wrong results.\n", "  30-80 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films are grown by pulsed laser\ndeposition on a 5 nm thick sputtered Pt atop gadolinium gallium garnet\nsubstrate (GGG) (110). Upon post-growth rapid thermal annealing, single crystal\nYIG(110) emerges as if it were epitaxially grown on GGG(110) despite the\npresence of the intermediate Pt film. The YIG surface shows atomic steps with\nthe root-mean-square roughness of 0.12 nm on flat terraces. Both Pt/YIG and\nGGG/Pt interfaces are atomically sharp. The resulting YIG(110) films show clear\nin-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with a well-defined easy axis along <001>\nand a peak-to-peak ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of 7.5 Oe at 9.32 GHz,\nsimilar to YIG epitaxilly grown on GGG. Both spin Hall magnetoresistance and\nlongitudinal spin Seebeck effects in the inverted bilayers indicate excellent\nPt/YIG interface quality.\n", "  Using first-principles calculation and symmetry analysis, we propose that\n\\theta-TaN is a topological semimetal having a new type of point nodes, i.e.,\ntriply degenerate nodal points. Each node is a band crossing between degenerate\nand non-degenerate bands along the high-symmetry line in the Brillouin zone,\nand is protected by crystalline symmetries. Such new type of nodes will always\ngenerate singular touching points between different Fermi surfaces and 3D spin\ntexture around them. Breaking the crystalline symmetry by external magnetic\nfield or strain leads to various of topological phases. By studying the Landau\nlevels under a small field along $c$-axis, we demonstrate that the system has a\nnew quantum anomaly that we call \"helical anomaly\".\n", "  We report new properties of the 11 and 12.7 {\\mu}m emission complexes of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by applying a Gaussian-based\ndecomposition technique. Using high-resolution \\textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope\ndata, we study in detail the spectral and spatial characteristics of the 11 and\n12.7 {\\mu}m emission bands in maps of reflection nebulae NGC 7023 and NGC 2023\n(North and South) and the star-forming region M17. Profile variations are\nobserved in both the 11 and 12.7 {\\mu}m emission bands. We identify a neutral\ncontribution to the traditional 11.0 {\\mu}m PAH band and a cationic\ncontribution to the traditional 11.2 {\\mu}m band, the latter of which affects\nthe PAH class of the 11.2 {\\mu}m emission in our sample. The peak variations of\nthe 12.7 {\\mu}m complex are explained by the competition between two underlying\nblended components. The spatial distributions of these components link them to\ncations and neutrals. We conclude that the 12.7 {\\mu}m emission originates in\nboth neutral and cationic PAHs, lending support to the use of the 12.7/11.2\nintensity ratio as a charge proxy.\n", "  We review how the (absence of) Ostrogradsky instability manifests itself in\ntheories with multiple fields. It has recently been appreciated that when\nmultiple fields are present, the existence of higher derivatives may not\nautomatically imply the existence of ghosts. We discuss the connection with\ngravitational theories like massive gravity and beyond Horndeski which manifest\nhigher derivatives in some formulations and yet are free of Ostrogradsky ghost.\nWe also examine an interesting new class of Extended Scalar-Tensor Theories of\ngravity which has been recently proposed. We show that for a subclass of these\ntheories, the tensor modes are either not dynamical or are infinitely strongly\ncoupled. Among the remaining theories for which the tensor modes are\nwell-defined one counts one new model that is not field-redefinable to\nHorndeski via a conformal and disformal transformation but that does require\nthe vacuum to break Lorentz invariance. We discuss the implications for the\neffective field theory of dark energy and the stability of the theory.\n", "  We present the HI content of galaxies in nearby groups and clusters as\nmeasured by the 70% complete Arecibo Legacy Fast-ALFA (ALFALFA) survey,\nincluding constraints from ALFALFA detection limits. Our sample includes 22\nsystems at distances between 70-160 Mpc over the mass range 12.5<log\nM/M_sun<15.0, for a total of 1986 late-type galaxies. We find that late-type\ngalaxies in the centers of groups lack HI at fixed stellar mass relative to the\nregions surrounding them. Larger groups show evidence of a stronger dependence\nof HI properties on environment, despite a similar dependence of color on\nenvironment at fixed stellar mass. We compare several environment variables to\ndetermine which is the best predictor of galaxy properties; group-centric\ndistance r and r/R_200 are similarly effective predictors, while local density\nis slightly more effective and group size and halo mass are slightly less\neffective. While both central and satellite galaxies in the blue cloud exhibit\na significant dependence of HI content on local density, only centrals show a\nstrong dependence on stellar mass, and only satellites show a strong dependence\non halo mass. Finally, we see evidence that HI is deficient for blue cloud\ngalaxies in denser environments even when both stellar mass and color are\nfixed. This is consistent with a picture where HI is removed or destroyed,\nfollowed by reddening within the blue cloud. Our results support the existence\nof pre-processing in isolated groups, along with an additional rapid mechanism\nfor gas removal within larger groups and clusters, perhaps ram-pressure\nstripping.\n", "  We study natural lepton mass matrices, obtained assuming the stability of\nphysical flavour observables with respect to the variations of individual\nmatrix elements. We identify all four possible stable neutrino textures from\nalgebraic conditions on their entries. Two of them turn out to be uniquely\nassociated to specific neutrino mass patterns. We then concentrate on the\nsemi-degenerate pattern, corresponding to an overall neutrino mass scale within\nthe reach of future experiments. In this context we show that i) the neutrino\nand charged lepton mixings and mass matrices are largely constrained by the\nrequirement of stability, ii) naturalness considerations give a mild preference\nfor the Majorana phase most relevant for neutrinoless double-beta decay,\n$\\alpha \\sim \\pi/2$, and iii) SU(5) unification allows to extend the\nimplications of stability to the down quark sector. The above considerations\nwould benefit from an experimental determination of the PMNS ratio\n$|U_{32}/U_{31}|$, i.e. of the Dirac phase $\\delta$.\n", "  We present full-polarization observations of the compact, steep-spectrum\nradio quasar 3C~286 made with the ALMA at 1.3~mm. These are the first\nfull-polarization ALMA observations, which were obtained in the framework of\nScience Verification. A bright core and a south-west component are detected in\nthe total intensity image, similar to previous centimeter images. Polarized\nemission is also detected toward both components. The fractional polarization\nof the core is about 17\\%, this is higher than the fractional polarization at\ncentimeter wavelengths, suggesting that the magnetic field is even more ordered\nin the millimeter radio core than it is further downstream in the jet. The\nobserved polarization position angle (or EVPA) in the core is\n$\\sim$\\,$39^{\\circ}$, which confirms the trend that the EVPA slowly increases\nfrom centimeter to millimeter wavelengths. With the aid of multi-frequency VLBI\nobservations, we argue that this EVPA change is associated with the\nfrequency-dependent core position. We also report a serendipitous detection of\na sub-mJy source in the field of view, which is likely to be a submillimeter\ngalaxy.\n", "  [abridged] Although gravitational radiation causes inspiralling compact\nbinaries to circularize, a variety of astrophysical scenarios suggest that\nbinaries might have small but nonnegligible orbital eccentricities when they\nenter the low-frequency bands of ground and space-based gravitational-wave\ndetectors. If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed\nto 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN\napproximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause\nsignificant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep\nthrough a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,\nincluding a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of\nperiodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated\ninto some of the PN approximants. While the eccentric extension of the PN\napproximants is our main objective, this work collects a variety of results\nthat may be of interest to others modeling eccentric relativistic binaries.\n", "  In this study, we present a new method for forecasting arrival times and\nspeeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at any location in the inner\nheliosphere. This new approach enables the adoption of a highly flexible\ngeometrical shape for the CME front with an adjustable CME angular width and an\nadjustable radius of curvature of its leading edge, i.e. the assumed geometry\nis elliptical. Using, as input, STEREO heliospheric imager (HI) observations, a\nnew elliptic conversion (ElCon) method is introduced and combined with the use\nof drag-based model (DBM) fitting to quantify the deceleration or acceleration\nexperienced by CMEs during propagation. The result is then used as input for\nthe Ellipse Evolution Model (ElEvo). Together, ElCon, DBM fitting, and ElEvo\nform the novel ElEvoHI forecasting utility. To demonstrate the applicability of\nElEvoHI, we forecast the arrival times and speeds of 21 CMEs remotely observed\nfrom STEREO/HI and compare them to in situ arrival times and speeds at 1 AU.\nCompared to the commonly used STEREO/HI fitting techniques (Fixed-$\\Phi$,\nHarmonic Mean, and Self-similar Expansion fitting), ElEvoHI improves the\narrival time forecast by about 2 hours to $\\pm 6.5$ hours and the arrival speed\nforecast by $\\approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\\pm 53$ km s$^{-1}$, depending on the\nellipse aspect ratio assumed. In particular, the remarkable improvement of the\narrival speed prediction is potentially beneficial for predicting geomagnetic\nstorm strength at Earth.\n", "  We review current experimental efforts to search for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$). A description of the selected leading experiments is\ngiven and the strongest recent results are compared in terms of achieved\nbackground indexes and limits on effective Majorana mass. A combined limit is\nalso shown. The second part of the review covers next generation experiments,\nhighlighting the challenges and new technologies that may be necessary to\nachieve a justifiable discovery potential. A potential synergy with direct dark\nmatter searches, which could be an especially prudent strategy in case the\naxial vector coupling constant is quenched in 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay, is\nemphasized.\n", "  The ontology emerging from quantum field theory and the results following\nfrom Bell's theorems allowed the development of an intuitive picture of the\nmicroscopic world described by quantum mechanics, that is, we can say that we\nunderstand this theory. However there remain several aspects of it that are\nstill mysterious and require more work on the foundations of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Simultaneous broadband spectral and temporal studies of blazars are an\nimportant tool for investigating active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet physics. We\nstudy the spectral evolution between quiescent and flaring periods of 22\nradio-loud AGN through multi-epoch, quasi-simultaneous broadband spectra. For\nmany of these sources these are the first broadband studies. We use a Bayesian\nblock analysis of \\Fermi/LAT light curves in order to determine time ranges of\nconstant flux for constructing quasi-simultaneous SEDs. The shapes of the\nresulting 81 SEDs are described by two logarithmic parabolas and a blackbody\nspectrum where needed. For low states the peak frequencies and luminosities\nagree well with the blazar sequence, higher luminosity implying lower peak\nfrequencies. This is not true for sources in a high state. The $\\gamma$-ray\nphoton index in Fermi/LAT correlates with the synchrotron peak frequency in low\nand intermediate states. No correlation is present in high states. The black\nhole mass cannot be determined from the SEDs. Surprisingly, the thermal excess\noften found in FSRQs at optical/UV wavelengths can be described by blackbody\nemission and not an accretion disk spectrum. The \"harder-when-brighter\" trend,\ntypically seen in X-ray spectra of flaring blazars, is visible in the blazar\nsequence. Our results for low and intermediate states, as well as the Compton\ndominance, are in agreement with previous results. Black hole mass estimates\nusing the parameters from Bonchi (2013) are in agreement with some of the more\ndirect measurements. For two sources, estimates disagree by more than four\norders of magnitude, possibly due to boosting effects. The shapes of the\nthermal excess seen predominantly in flat spectrum radio quasars are\ninconsistent with a direct accretion disk origin.\n", "  We calculate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) of the $\\mathbb{Z}_k$\norbifold of Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) geometries which are dual to the vacua of\nthe mass-deformed ABJM theory with Chern-Simons level $k$. By solving the\npartial differential equations analytically, we obtain the HEEs for all LLM\nsolutions with arbitrary M2 charge and $k$ up to $\\mu_0^2$-order where $\\mu_0$\nis the mass parameter. The renormalized entanglement entropies are all\nmonotonically decreasing near the UV fixed point in accordance with the\n$F$-theorem. Except the multiplication factor and to all orders in $\\mu_0$,\nthey are independent of the overall scaling of Young diagrams which\ncharacterize LLM geometries. Therefore we can classify the HEEs of LLM\ngeometries with $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifold in terms of the shape of Young diagrams\nmodulo overall size. HEE of each family is a pure number independent of the 't\nHooft coupling constant except the overall multiplication factor. We extend our\nanalysis to obtain HEE analytically to $\\mu_0^4$-order for the symmetric\ndroplet case.\n", "  Aims. The random walk of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic\nfields is investigated. Special focus is placed on transport across the mean\nmagnetic field, which had been found to be subdiffusive on many occasions.\nTherefore, a characterization using the concept of ergodicity is attempted by\nnoting the connection to the time evolution of the mean-square displacement.\nMethods. Based on the test-particle approach, a numerical Monte-Carlo\nsimulation code is used to integrate the equation of motion for particles that\nare scattered by magnetic turbulence. The turbulent fields are generated by\nsuperposing plane waves with a Kolmogorov-type power spectrum. The individual\nparticle trajectories are then used to calculate a variety of statistical\nquantities. Results. The simulation results clearly demonstrate how the\nheterogeneity of the particle ensemble causes the system to be weakly\nnon-ergodic. In addition, it is shown how the step length distribution varies\nwith the particle energy. In conclusion, cross-field transport is non-Gaussian\nbut still almost diffusive.\n", "  Thin films of superfluid $^3$He were predicted, based on weak-coupling BCS\ntheory, to have a stable phase which spontaneously breaks translational\nsymmetry in the plane of the film. This crystalline superfluid, or \"stripe\"\nphase, develops as a one dimensional periodic array of domain walls separating\ndegenerate B phase domains. We report calculations of the phases and phase\ndiagram for superfluid $^3$He in thin films using a strong-coupling\nGinzburg-Landau theory that accurately reproduces the bulk $^3$He superfluid\nphase diagram. We find that the stability of the Stripe phase is diminished\nrelative to the A phase, but the Stripe phase is stable in a large range of\ntemperatures, pressures, confinement, and surface conditions.\n", "  This is an introduction to the special issue collection of articles on\n\"Semi-classical and quantum Rabi models\" to be published in J. Phys. A to mark\nthe 80th anniversary of the Rabi model.\n", "  We consider an integrable, nonlocal and nonlinear, Schr\\\"odinger equation\n(NNSE) as a model for building space-time patchings in inhomogeneous loop\nquantum cosmology (LQC). We briefly review exact solutions of the NNSE,\nspecially those obtained through \"geometric equivalence\" methods. Furthemore,\nwe argue that the integrability of the NNSE could be linked to consistency\nconditions derived from LQC, under the assumption that the patchwork dynamics\nbehaves as an integrable many-body system.\n", "  We compute the full one-loop 2-particle S-matrix for excitations of the type\nIIB AdS(3) x S(3) x T(4) BMN string. The S-matrix is found to respect the\nexpected symmetries and the phases are consistent with the crossing equations.\nBy analyzing how the relevant integrals scale with the IR regulator we show\nthat scattering of massless bosons is trivial at two loops. Based on our\nresults we argue that the additional su(2) S-matrix appearing in the massless\nsector in the exact solution should trivialize.\n", "  We compare four sunspot-number data sequences against geomagnetic and\nterrestrial auroral observations. The comparisons are made for the original\nSIDC composite of Wolf-Zurich-International sunspot number [$R_{ISNv1}$], the\ngroup sunspot number [$R_{G}$] by Hoyt and Schatten (Solar Phys., 1998), the\nnew \"backbone\" group sunspot number [$R_{BB}$] by Svalgaard and Schatten (Solar\nPhys., 2016), and the \"corrected\" sunspot number [$R_{C}$] by Lockwood at al.\n(J.G.R., 2014). Each sunspot number is fitted with terrestrial observations, or\nparameters derived from terrestrial observations to be linearly proportional to\nsunspot number, over a 30-year calibration interval of 1982-2012. The fits are\nthen used to compute test sequences, which extend further back in time and\nwhich are compared to $R_{ISNv1}$, $R_{G}$, $R_{BB}$, and $R_{C}$. To study the\nlong-term trends, comparisons are made using averages over whole solar cycles\n(minimum-to-minimum). The test variations are generated in four ways: i) using\nthe IDV(1d) and IDV geomagnetic indices (for 1845-2013) fitted over the\ncalibration interval using the various sunspot numbers and the phase of the\nsolar cycle; ii) from the open solar flux (OSF) generated for 1845 - 2013 from\nfour pairings of geomagnetic indices by Lockwood et al. (Ann. Geophys., 2014)\nand analysed using the OSF continuity model of Solanki at al. (Nature, 2000)\nwhich employs a constant fractional OSF loss rate; iii) the same OSF data\nanalysed using the OSF continuity model of Owens and Lockwood (J.G.R., 2012) in\nwhich the fractional loss rate varies with the tilt of the heliospheric current\nsheet and hence with the phase of the solar cycle; iv) the occurrence frequency\nof low-latitude aurora for 1780-1980 from the survey of Legrand and Simon (Ann.\nGeophys., 1987). For all cases, $R_{BB}$ exceeds the test terrestrial series by\nan amount that increases as one goes back in time.\n", "  As a prototypical one-dimensional electron system, self-assembled indium (In)\nnanowires on the Si(111) surface have been believed to drive a metal-insulator\ntransition by a charge-density-wave (CDW) formation due to electron-phonon\ncoupling. Here, our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the\nstructural phase transition from the high-temperature 4x1 phase to the\nlow-temperature 8x2 phase occurs through an exothermic reaction with the\nconsecutive bond-breaking and bond-making processes, giving rise to an energy\nbarrier between the two phases as well as a gap opening. This atomistic picture\nfor the phase transition not only identifies its first-order nature but also\nsolves a long-standing puzzle of the origin of the metal-insulator transition\nin terms of the x2 periodic lattice reconstruction of In hexagons via bond\nbreakage and new bond formation, not by the Peierls instability-driven CDW\nformation.\n", "  We analyse the low energy predictions of the minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel (MSSM) arising from a GUT scale Pati-Salam gauge group further\nconstrained by an $A_4 \\times Z_5$ family symmetry, resulting in four soft\nscalar masses at the GUT scale: one left-handed soft mass $m_0$ and three\nright-handed soft masses $m_1,m_2,m_3$, one for each generation. We demonstrate\nthat this model, which was initially developed to describe the neutrino sector,\ncan explain collider and non-collider measurements such as the dark matter\nrelic density, the Higgs boson mass and, in particular, the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon $(g-2)_\\mu$. Since about two decades, $(g-2)_\\mu$ suffers a\npuzzling about 3$\\,\\sigma$ excess of the experimentally measured value over the\ntheoretical prediction, which our model is able to fully resolve. As the\nconsequence of this resolution, our model predicts specific regions of the\nparameter space with the specific properties including light smuons and\nneutralinos, which could also potentially explain di-lepton excesses observed\nby CMS and ATLAS.\n", "  Time-domain surveys can exchange sky coverage for revisit frequency,\ncomplicating the comparison of their relative capabilities. By using different\nrevisit intervals, a specific camera may execute surveys optimized for\ndiscovery of different classes of transient objects. We propose a new figure of\nmerit, the instantaneous volumetric survey speed, for evaluating transient\nsurveys. This metric defines the trade between cadence interval and snapshot\nsurvey volume and so provides a natural means of comparing survey capability.\nThe related metric of areal survey speed imposes a constraint on the range of\npossible revisit times: we show that many modern time-domain surveys are\nlimited by the amount of fresh sky available each night. We introduce the\nconcept of \"spectroscopic accessibility\" and discuss its importance for\ntransient science goals requiring followup observing. We present an extension\nof the control time algorithm for cases where multiple consecutive detections\nare required. Finally, we explore how survey speed and choice of cadence\ninterval determine the detection rate of transients in the peak absolute\nmagnitude-decay timescale phase space.\n", "  The assembly of individual two-dimensional materials into van der Waals\nheterostructures enables the construction of layered three-dimensional\nmaterials with desirable electronic and optical properties. A core problem in\nthe fabrication of these structures is the formation of clean interfaces\nbetween the individual two-dimensional materials which would affect device\nperformance. We present here a technique for the rapid batch fabrication of van\nder Waals heterostructures, demonstrated by the controlled production of 22\nmono-, bi- and trilayer graphene stacks encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride\nwith close to 100% yield. For the monolayer devices we found semiclassical mean\nfree paths up to 0.9 micrometer, with the narrowest samples showing clear\nindications of the transport being affected by boundary scattering. The\npresented method readily lends itself to fabrication of van der Waals\nheterostructures in both ambient and controlled atmospheres, while the ability\nto assemble pre-patterned layers paves the way for complex three-dimensional\narchitectures.\n", "  Using data from the Green Bank Telescope, we analyze the radio continuum\n(free-free) and radio recombination line (RRL) emission of the compact HII\nregion NGC 7538 (Sharpless 158). We detect extended radio continuum and\nhydrogen RRL emission beyond the photodissociation region (PDR) toward the\nnorth and east, but a sharp decrease in emission toward the south and west.\nThis indicates that a non-uniform PDR morphology is affecting the amount of\nradiation \"leaking\" through the PDR. The strongest carbon RRL emission is found\nin the western PDR that appears to be dense. We compute a leaking fraction $f_R\n= 15 \\pm 5$ % of the radio continuum emission measured in the plane of the sky\nwhich represents a lower limit when accounting for the three-dimensional\ngeometry of the region. We detect an average $^4\\textrm{He}^+/\\textrm{H}^+$\nabundance ratio by number of $0.088 \\pm 0.003$ inside the HII region and a\ndecrease in this ratio with increasing distance from the region beyond the PDR.\nUsing Herschel Space Observatory data, we show that small dust temperature\nenhancements to the north and east of NGC 7538 coincide with extended radio\nemission, but that the dust temperature enhancements are mostly contained\nwithin a second PDR to the east. Unlike the giant HII region W43, the radiation\nleaking from NGC 7538 seems to only affect the local ambient medium. This\nsuggests that giant HII regions may have a large effect in maintaining the\nionization of the interstellar medium.\n", "  The $5g-4f$ transitions in pionic nitrogen and muonic oxygen were measured\nsimultaneously by using a gaseous nitrogen-oxygen mixture at 1.4\\,bar. Due to\nthe precise knowledge of the muon mass the muonic line provides the energy\ncalibration for the pionic transition. A value of\n(139.57077\\,$\\pm$\\,0.00018)\\,MeV/c$^{2}$ ($\\pm$\\,1.3ppm) is derived for the\nmass of the negatively charged pion, which is 4.2ppm larger than the present\nworld average.\n", "  The accuracy of rate constants calculated using transition state theory\ndepends crucially on the correct identification of a recrossing--free dividing\nsurface. We show here that it is possible to define such optimal dividing\nsurface in systems with non--Markovian friction. However, a more direct\napproach to rate calculation is based on invariant manifolds and avoids the use\nof a dividing surface altogether, Using that method we obtain an explicit\nexpression for the rate of crossing an anharmonic potential barrier. The\nexcellent performance of our method is illustrated with an application to a\nrealistic model for LiNC$\\rightleftharpoons$LiCN isomerization.\n", "  We present results of the first calculation of next-to-leading-order\nelectroweak corrections to W-boson pair production at the LHC that fully takes\ninto account leptonic W-boson decays and off-shell effects. Employing realistic\nevent selections, we discuss the corrections in situations that are typical for\nthe study of W-boson pairs as a signal process or of Higgs-boson decays $H\\to W\nW^*$, to which W-boson pair production represents an irreducible background. In\nparticular, we compare the full off-shell results, obtained treating the\nW-boson resonances in the complex-mass scheme, to previous results in the\nso-called double-pole approximation, which is based on an expansion of the loop\namplitudes about the W resonance poles. At small and intermediate scales, i.e.\nin particular in angular and rapidity distributions, the two approaches show\nthe expected agreement at the level of fractions of a percent, but larger\ndifferences appear in the TeV range. For transverse-momentum distributions, the\ndifferences can even exceed the 10% level in the TeV range where \"background\ndiagrams\" with one instead of two resonant W bosons gain in importance because\nof recoil effects.\n", "  We present here a neutron diffraction study, both in zero field and as a\nfunction of magnetic field, of the magnetic structure of the tetragonal\nintermetallic \\eun\\ on a single crystalline sample. This material is known to\nundergo a cascade of transitions, first at 13.2\\,K towards an incommensurate\nmodulated magnetic structure, then at 10.5\\,K to an equal moment, yet\nundetermined, antiferromagnetic structure. We show here that the low\ntemperature phase presents a spiral moment arrangement with wave-vector {\\bf k}\n= ($\\frac{1}{4},\\delta,0)$. For a magnetic field applied along the tetragonal\n{\\bf c}-axis, the square root of the scattering intensity of a chosen\nreflection matches very well the complex metamagnetic behavior of the\nmagnetization along {\\bf c} measured previously. For the magnetic field applied\nalong the {\\bf b}-axis, two magnetic transitions are observed below the\ntransition to a fully polarized state.\n", "  The knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) of imaging instruments\nrepresents a fundamental requirement for astronomical observations. The\nHerschel PACS PSFs delivered by the instrument control centre are obtained from\nobservations of the Vesta asteroid, providing a characterisation of the central\npart therefore excluding fainter features. However, in many cases information\non both the core and the wings of the PSFs is needed. With this aim, we combine\nVesta and Mars dedicated observations and obtain PACS PSFs with an\nunprecedented dynamic range $(\\sim 10^6)$, at slow and fast scan speeds and for\nthe three photometric bands.\n", "  Neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) generally accrete from the\nwind matter of their massive companion stars. Recently Shakura et al. (2012)\nsuggested a subsonic accretion model for low-luminosity ($<4\\times 10^{36}$\nergs$^{-1}$), wind-fed X-ray pulsars. To test the feasibility of this model, we\ninvestigate the spin period distribution of wind-fed X-ray pulsars with a\nsupergiant companion star, using a population synthesis method. We find that\nthe modeled distribution of supergiant HMXBs in the spin period - orbital\nperiod diagram is consistent with observations provided that the winds from the\ndonor stars have relatively low terminal velocities ($\\lesssim 1000$\nkms$^{-1}$). The measured wind velocities in several supergiant HMXBs seem to\nfavor this viewpoint. The predicted number ratio of wind-fed X-ray pulsars with\npersistent X-ray luminosities higher and lower than $4\\times 10^{36}$\nergs$^{-1}$ is about $1:10$.\n", "  The motion of weights attached to a chain or string moving on a frictionless\npulley is a classic problem of introductory physics used to understand the\nrelationship between force and acceleration. Here, we consider the dynamics of\nthe chain when one of the weights is removed and, thus, one end is pulled with\nconstant acceleration. This simple change has dramatic consequences for the\nensuing motion: at a finite time, the chain `lifts off' from the pulley and the\nfree end subsequently accelerates faster than the end that is pulled.\nEventually, the chain undergoes a dramatic reversal of curvature reminiscent of\nthe crack, or snap, of a whip. We combine experiments, numerical simulations,\nand theoretical arguments to explain key aspects of this dynamical problem.\n", "  We investigate the gravitational wave background from a first order phase\ntransition in a matter-dominated universe, and show that it has a unique\nfeature from which important information about the properties of the phase\ntransition and thermal history of the universe can be easily extracted. Also,\nwe discuss the inverse problem of such a gravitational wave background in view\nof the degeneracy among macroscopic parameters governing the signal.\n", "  We present results of 12CO(J=2-1) observations toward four massive\nstar-forming galaxies at z~1.4 with the Nobeyama 45~m radio telescope. The\ngalaxies are detected with Spitzer/MIPS in 24 um, Herschel/SPIRE in 250 um, and\n350 um and they mostly reside in the main sequence. Their gas-phase\nmetallicities derived with N2 method by using the Ha and [NII]6584 emission\nlines are near the solar value. CO lines are detected toward three galaxies.\nThe molecular gas masses obtained are (9.6-35) x 10^{10} Msun by adopting the\nGalactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor and the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) flux ratio of 3.\nThe dust masses derived with the modified blackbody model (assuming the dust\ntemperature of 35 K and the emissivity index of 1.5) are (2.4-5.4) x 10^{8}\nMsun. The resulting gas-to-dust ratios (not accounting for HI mass) at z~1.4\nare 220-1450, which are several times larger than those in local star-forming\ngalaxies. A dependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on the far-infrared luminosity\ndensity is not clearly seen.\n", "  We discuss the quasi-normal oscillations of black holes which are sourced by\na nonlinear electrodynamic field. While previous studies have focused on the\ncomputation of quasi-normal frequencies for the wave or higher spin equation on\na fixed background geometry described by such black holes, here we compute for\nthe first time the quasi-normal frequencies for the coupled\nelectromagnetic-gravitational linear perturbations.\n  To this purpose, we consider a parametrized family of Lagrangians for the\nelectromagnetic field which contains the Maxwell Lagrangian as a special case.\nIn the Maxwell case, the unique spherically symmetric black hole solutions are\ndescribed by the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om family and in this case it is well-known\nthat the quasi-normal spectra in the even- and odd-parity sectors are identical\nto each other. However, when moving away from the Maxwell case, we obtain\ndeformed Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes, and we show that in this case there\nis a parity splitting in the quasi-normal mode spectra. A partial explanation\nfor this phenomena is provided by considering the eikonal (high-frequency)\nlimit.\n", "  In the next few years, the near-infrared interferometer GRAVITY will be able\nto observe the Galactic center. Astrometric data will be obtained with an\nanticipated accuracy of 10 $\\mu$as. To analyze these future data, we have\ndeveloped a code called GYOTO to compute orbits and images. We want to assess\nthe validity and accuracy of GYOTO in a variety of contexts, in particular for\nstellar astrometry in the Galactic center. Furthermore, we want to tackle and\ncomplete a study made on the astrometric displacements that are due to lensing\neffects of a star of the central parsec with GYOTO. We first validate GYOTO in\nthe weak-deflection limit (WDL) by studying primary caustics and primary\ncritical curves obtained for a Kerr black hole. We compare GYOTO results to\navailable analytical approximations and estimate GYOTO errors using an\nintrinsic estimator. In the strong-deflection limit (SDL), we choose to compare\nnull geodesics computed by GYOTO and the ray-tracing code named Geokerr.\nFinally, we use GYOTO to estimate the apparent displacements of a star for\ndifferent angles from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We have demonstrated that GYOTO\nis accurate to a very high level, orders of magnitude better than the GRAVITY\nrequirements. GYOTO is also valid in weak- and strong-deflection regimes and\nfor very long integrations. At the astrometric precision that GRAVITY is aiming\nfor, lensing effects must always be taken into account when fitting stellar\norbits in the central parsec of the Galaxy.\n", "  Magnetic fields have been detected in several hundred white dwarfs, with\nstrengths ranging from a few kG to several hundred MG. Only a few of the known\nfields have a mean magnetic field modulus below about 1 MG.\n  We are searching for new examples of magnetic white dwarfs with very weak\nfields, and trying to model the few known examples. Our search is intended to\nbe sensitive enough to detect fields at the few kG level.\n  We have been surveying bright white dwarfs for very weak fields using\nspectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, the William Herschel\ntelescope, the European Southern Observatory, and the Russian Special\nAstrophysical Observatory. We discuss in some detail tests of the WHT\nspectropolarimeter ISIS using the known magnetic strong-field Ap star HD 215441\n(Babcock's star) and the long-period Ap star HD 201601 (gamma Equ).\n  We report the discovery of a field with a mean field modulus of about 57 kG\nin the white dwarf LTT 16093 = WD2047+372. The field is clearly detected\nthrough the Zeeman splitting of Halpha seen in two separate circularly\npolarised spectra from two different spectropolarimeters. Zeeman circular\npolarisation is also detected, but only barely above the 3 sigma level.\n  The discovery of this field is significant because it is the third weakest\nfield ever unambiguously discovered in a white dwarf, while still being large\nenough that we should be able to model the field structure in some detail with\nfuture observations.\n", "  The helicity of a Dirac neutrino with mass $m$ evolves under the influence of\na $B$-field because it has a magnetic dipole moment proportional to $m$.\nMoreover, it was recently shown that a polarized or anisotropic medium\nengenders the same effect for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos. Because a\n$B$-field polarizes a background medium, it instigates helicity oscillations\neven for Majorana neutrinos unless the medium is symmetric between matter and\nantimatter. Motivated by these observations, we review the impact of a\n$B$-field and of an anisotropic or polarized medium on helicity oscillations\nfor Dirac and Majorana neutrinos from the common perspective of in-medium\ndispersion.\n", "  An approximation is elaborated for the paraxial propagation of diffracted\nbeams, with both one- and two-dimensional cross sections, which are released\nfrom apertures with sharp boundaries. The approximation applies to any beam\nunder the condition that the thickness of its edges is much smaller than any\nother length scale in the beam's initial profile. The approximation can be\neasily generalized for any beam whose initial profile has several sharp\nfeatures. Therefore, this method can be used as a tool to investigate the\ndiffraction of beams on complex obstacles. The analytical results are compared\nto numerical solutions and experimental findings, which demonstrates high\naccuracy of the approximation. For an initially uniform field confined by sharp\nboundaries, this solution becomes exact for any propagation distance and any\nsharpness of the edges. Thus, it can be used as an efficient tool to represent\nthe beams, produced by series of slits with a complex structure, by a simple\nbut exact analytical solution.\n", "  We consider the theory of multicomponent free massless fermions in two\ndimensions and use it for construction of representations of W-algebras at\ninteger Virasoro central charges. We define the vertex operators in this theory\nin terms of solutions of the corresponding isomonodromy problem. We use this\nconstruction to get some new insights on tau-functions of the multicomponent\nToda type hierarchies for the class of solutions, given by the isomonodromy\nvertex operators and get useful representation for the tau-function of\nisomonodromic deformations.\n", "  If the 750 GeV diphoton excess is identified with the color-singlet\nisosinglet-technipion, $P^0$ (750), in the one-family walking technicolor, as\nin our previous paper, then there should exist another color-singlet\ntechnipion, isotriplet one, $P^{\\pm,3}$, definitely predicted at around 950 GeV\nindependently of the dynamical details. The $P^{\\pm,3}(950)$ are produced at\nthe LHC via vector boson and photon fusion processes, predominantly decaying to\n$W \\gamma$, and $\\gamma\\gamma$, respectively. Those walking technicolor signals\ncan be explored at the Run 2, or 3, which would further open a way to a\nplethora of yet other (colored) technipions.\n", "  Betelgeuse is an M supergiant that harbors spots and giant granules at its\nsurface and presents linear polarization of its continuum. We have previously\ndiscovered linear polarization signatures associated with individual lines in\nthe spectra of cool and evolved stars. Here, we investigate whether a similar\nlinearly polarized spectrum exists for Betelgeuse. We used the\nspectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the\nleast-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach. We have discovered the existence of\na linearly polarized spectrum for Betelgeuse, detecting a rather strong signal\n(at a few times 10$^{-4}$ of the continuum intensity level), both in individual\nlines and in the LSD profiles. Studying its properties and the signal observed\nfor the resonant \\ion{Na}{i}\\,D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing\ndepolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear\npolarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the\nradiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh\nscattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to\ninterpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two\nbrightness spots and their positions on the surface of Betelgeuse. We show that\napplying the model to each velocity bin along the Stokes Q and U profiles\nallows the derivation of a map of the bright spots. We use the Narval linear\npolarization observations of Betelgeuse obtained over a period of 1.4 years to\nstudy the evolution of the spots. Our study of the linearly polarized spectrum\nof Betelgeuse provides a novel method for studying the evolution of brightness\nspots at its surface and complements quasi-simultaneous observations obtained\nwith PIONIER at the VLTI.\n", "  We construct a dual formulation, with respect to the conventional PST\nformalism, of the M5-brane action propagating in a generic 11d supergravity\nbackground. Constraint analysis is performed to further justify that our theory\nhas the correct number of degrees of freedom. Comparison of this action with\nthe existing M5-brane actions is carried out. We also show that a conventional\nD4-brane action is obtained upon double dimensional reduction.\n", "  We study the dissipative dynamics of a two-level system under ultrastrong\ndriving when the frequency and strength of the exciting field exceed\nsignificantly the transition frequency. We find three qualitatively different\nregimes of such dynamics: 1) the collapse and revival of oscillations in the\npopulation difference, 2) the simple exponential decay of the oscillations\nresulting in their steady state with the finite amplitude, and 3) the\nsteady-state stabilization of the equally populated levels. The nonmonotonic\nBessel-function-like dependence on the driving strength is also predicted for\nthe decay rate of these oscillations. The features of this dependence are\ndetermined by the relative rates of energetic relaxation and pure dephasing.\n", "  We construct a general procedure to extract the exclusive Racah matrices S\nand \\bar S from the inclusive 3-strand mixing matrices by the evolution method\nand apply it to the first simple representations R =[1], [2], [3] and [2,2].\nThe matrices S and \\bar S relate respectively the maps (R\\otimes R)\\otimes \\bar\nR\\longrightarrow R with R\\otimes (R \\otimes \\bar R) \\longrightarrow R and\n(R\\otimes \\bar R) \\otimes R \\longrightarrow R with R\\otimes (\\bar R \\otimes R)\n\\longrightarrow R. They are building blocks for the colored HOMFLY polynomials\nof arbitrary arborescent (double fat) knots. Remarkably, the calculation\nrealizes an unexpected integrability property underlying the evolution\nmatrices.\n", "  We investigated systematic evolutions of structural and electronic properties\nof LixWO3 films, induced by Li-ion electrochemical reactions.\nChronoamperometric Li-ion intercalation could control the amount of Li content\nup to x ~ 0.5. The resistivity abruptly decreased with increasing x and the\nfilms underwent an insulator to metal transition (IMT) within a range of 0.2 <\nx < 0.24, which was consistent with IMT of cubic NaxWO3. The X-ray diffraction\nanalyses revealed the coexistence of tetragonal and cubic phases across IMT,\nsuggesting that the alkaline-ion content was a primary factor for metallic\nconductivity in the ReO3-type WO3 system.\n", "  We develop an operator description, much like thermofield dynamics, for\nquantum field theories on a real time path with an arbitrary parameter\n$\\sigma\\,(0\\leq\\sigma\\leq\\beta)$. We point out new features which arise when\n$\\sigma\\neq \\frac{\\beta}{2}$ in that the Hilbert space develops a natural,\nmodified inner product different from the standard Dirac inner product. We\nconstruct the Bogoliubov transformation which connects the doubled vacuum state\nat zero temperature to the thermal vacuum in this case. We obtain the thermal\nGreen's function (propagator) for the real massive Klein-Gordon theory as an\nexpectation value in this thermal vacuum (with a modified inner product). The\nfactorization of the thermal Green's function follows from this analysis. We\nalso discuss, in the main text as well as in two appendices, various other\ninteresting features which arise in such a description.\n", "  On 2015 June 16, Fermi-LAT observed a giant outburst from the flat spectrum\nradio quasar 3C 279 with a peak $>100$ MeV flux of $\\sim3.6\\times10^{-5}\\;{\\rm\nphotons}\\;{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\;{\\rm s}^{-1}$ averaged over orbital period intervals.\nIt is the historically highest $\\gamma$-ray flux observed from the source\nincluding past EGRET observations, with the $\\gamma$-ray isotropic luminosity\nreaching $\\sim10^{49}\\;{\\rm erg}\\;{\\rm s}^{-1}$. During the outburst, the Fermi\nspacecraft, which has an orbital period of 95.4 min, was operated in a special\npointing mode to optimize the exposure for 3C 279. For the first time,\nsignificant flux variability at sub-orbital timescales was found in blazar\nobservations by Fermi-LAT. The source flux variability was resolved down to\n2-min binned timescales, with flux doubling times less than 5 min. The observed\nminute-scale variability suggests a very compact emission region at hundreds of\nSchwarzschild radii from the central engine in conical jet models. A minimum\nbulk jet Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma$) of 35 is necessary to avoid both internal\n$\\gamma$-ray absorption and super-Eddington jet power. In the standard\nexternal-radiation-Comptonization scenario, $\\Gamma$ should be at least 50 to\navoid overproducing the synchrotron-self-Compton component. However, this\npredicts extremely low magnetization ($\\sim5\\times10^{-4}$). Equipartition\nrequires $\\Gamma$ as high as 120, unless the emitting region is a small\nfraction of the dissipation region. Alternatively, we consider $\\gamma$ rays\noriginating as synchrotron radiation of $\\gamma_{\\rm e}\\sim1.6\\times10^6$\nelectrons, in magnetic field $B\\sim1.3$ kG, accelerated by strong electric\nfields $E\\sim B$ in the process of magnetoluminescence. At such short distance\nscales, one cannot immediately exclude production of $\\gamma$ rays in hadronic\nprocesses.\n", "  We explore the sensitivity of $^{163}$Ho electron capture experiments to\nneutrino masses in the standard framework of three-neutrino mixing and in the\nframework of 3+1 neutrino mixing with a sterile neutrino which mixes with the\nthree standard active neutrinos, as indicated by the anomalies found in\nshort-baseline neutrino oscillations experiments. We calculate the sensitivity\nto neutrino masses and mixing for different values of the energy resolution of\nthe detectors, of the unresolved pileup fraction and of the total statistics of\nevents, considering the expected values of these parameters in the two planned\nstages of the ECHo project (ECHo-1k and ECHo-1M). We show that an extension of\nthe ECHo-1M experiment with the possibility to collect $10^{16}$ events will be\ncompetitive with the KATRIN experiment. This statistics will allow to explore\npart of the 3+1 mixing parameter space indicated by the global analysis of\nshort-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In order to cover all the\nallowed region, a statistics of about $10^{17}$ events will be needed.\n", "  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) provide information about the surface composition of about 100,000 minor\nplanets. The resulting visible colors and albedos enabled us to group them in\nseveral major classes, which are a simplified view of the diversity shown by\nthe few existing spectra. We performed a serendipitous search in VISTA-VHS\nobservations using a pipeline developed to retrieve and process the data that\ncorresponds to solar system objects (SSo). The colors and the magnitudes of the\nminor planets observed by the VISTA survey are compiled into three catalogs\nthat are available online: the detections catalog (MOVIS-D), the magnitudes\ncatalog (MOVIS-M), and the colors catalog (MOVIS-C). They were built using the\nthird data release of the survey (VISTA VHS-DR3). A total of 39,947 objects\nwere detected, including 52 NEAs, 325 Mars Crossers, 515 Hungaria asteroids,\n38,428 main-belt asteroids, 146 Cybele asteroids, 147 Hilda asteroids, 270\nTrojans, 13 comets, 12 Kuiper Belt objects and Neptune with its four\nsatellites. The colors found for asteroids with known spectral properties\nreveal well-defined patterns corresponding to different mineralogies. The\ndistributions of MOVIS-C data in color-color plots shows clusters identified\nwith different taxonomic types. All the diagrams that use (Y-J) color separate\nthe spectral classes more effectively than the (J-H) and (H-Ks) plots used\nuntil now: even for large color errors (<0.1), the plots (Y-J) vs (Y-Ks) and\n(Y-J) vs (J-Ks) provide the separation between S-complex and C-complex. The end\nmembers A, D, R, and V-types occupy well-defined regions.\n", "  Coronal magnetic null points exist in abundance as demonstrated by\nextrapolations of the coronal field, and have been inferred to be important for\na broad range of energetic events. These null points and their associated\nseparatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line\nmapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line\nmapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and\nspine field lines, that can be analysed using the `squashing factor', $Q$. In\nthis paper we make a detailed analysis of the distribution of $Q$ in the\npresence of magnetic nulls. While $Q$ is formally infinite on both the spine\nand fan of the null, the decay of $Q$ away from these structures is shown in\ngeneral to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of\na non-radially-symmetric null, $Q$ decays most slowly away from the spine/fan\nin the direction in which $|{\\bf B}|$ increases most slowly. In particular,\nthis demonstrates that the extended, elliptical high-$Q$ halo around the spine\nfootpoints observed by Masson et al. (Astrophys. J., 700, 559, 2009) is a\ngeneric feature. This extension of the $Q$ halos around the spine/fan\nfootpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are\nmagnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of\nthis, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of\nobserved flare ribbons in `circular ribbon flares', in which typically a\ncoronal null is implicated. We conclude that both the physics in the vicinity\nof the null and how this is related to the extension of $Q$ away from the\nspine/fan can be used in tandem to understand observational signatures of\nreconnection at coronal null points.\n", "  A quantum critical behavior of the magnetic susceptibility was observed in a\nquasicrystal containing ytterbium. At the same time, a mixed-valence feature of\nYb ions was reported, which appears to be incompatible with the magnetic\ninstability. We derive the magnetic susceptibility by expressing the\nquasiperiodicity as the distributed hybridization strength between Yb 4f and\nconduction electrons. Assuming a wide distribution of the hybridization\nstrength, the most f electrons behave as renormalized paramagnetic states in\nthe Kondo or mixed-valence regime, but a small number of f moments remain\nunscreened. As a result, the bulk magnetic susceptibility exhibits a nontrivial\npower-law-like behavior, while the average f-electron occupation is that of\nmixed-valence systems. This model thus resolves two contradictory properties of\nYb quasicrystals.\n", "  We study a nonminimal derivative inflationary model in the presence of the\nGauss-Bonnet term. To have a complete treatment of the model, we consider a\ngeneral form of the nonminimal derivative function and also the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling term. By following the ADM formalism, expanding the action up to the\nthird order in the perturbations and using the correlation functions, we study\nthe perturbation and its non-Gaussian feature in details. We also study the\nconsistency relation that gets modified in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm in the action. We compare the results of our consideration in\nconfrontation with Planck2015 observational data and find some constraints on\nthe model's parameters. Our treatment shows that this model in some ranges of\nthe parameters is consistent with the observational data. Also, in some ranges\nof model's parameters, the model predicts blue-tilted power spectrum. Finally,\nwe show that nonminimal derivative model in the presence of the GB term has\ncapability to have large non-Gaussianity.\n", "  Convolutional gridding is a processor-intensive step in interferometric\nimaging. While it is possible to use graphics processing units (GPUs) to\naccelerate this operation, existing methods use only a fraction of the\navailable flops. We apply thread coarsening to improve the efficiency of an\nexisting algorithm, and observe performance gains of up to $3.2\\times$ for\nsingle-polarization gridding and $1.9\\times$ for quad-polarization gridding on\na GeForce GTX 980, and smaller but still significant gains on a Radeon R9 290X.\n", "  Among the consequences of the disordered interaction topology underlying many\nsocial, techno- logical and biological systems, a particularly important one is\nthat some nodes, just because of their position in the network, may have a\ndisproportionate effect on dynamical processes mediated by the complex\ninteraction pattern. For example, the early adoption by an opinion leader in a\nsocial network may change the fate of a commercial product, or just a few\nsuper-spreaders may determine the virality of a meme in social media. Despite\nmany recent efforts, the formulation of an accurate method to optimally\nidentify influential nodes in complex network topologies remains an unsolved\nchallenge. Here, we present the exact solution of the problem for the specific,\nbut highly relevant, case of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model for\nepidemic spreading at criticality. By exploiting the mapping between bond\npercolation and the static properties of SIR, we prove that the recently\nintroduced Non-Backtracking centrality is the optimal criterion for the\nidentification of influential spreaders in locally tree-like networks at\ncriticality. By means of simulations on synthetic networks and on a very\nextensive set of real-world networks, we show that the Non-Backtracking\ncentrality is a highly reliable metric to identify top influential spreaders\nalso in generic graphs not embedded in space, and for noncritical spreading.\n", "  AI Phe is a double-lined, detached binary, in which a K-type sub-giant star\ntotally eclipses its main-sequence companion every 24.6 days. This\nconfiguration makes AI Phe ideal for testing stellar evolutionary models.\nDifficulties in obtaining a complete lightcurve mean the precision of existing\nradii measurements could be improved. Our aim is to improve the precision of\nthe radius measurements for the stars in AI Phe using high-precision photometry\nfrom WASP, and use these improved radius measurements together with estimates\nof the masses, temperatures and composition of the stars to place constraints\non the mixing length, helium abundance and age of the system. A best-fit ebop\nmodel is used to obtain lightcurve parameters, with their standard errors\ncalculated using a prayer-bead algorithm. These were combined with previously\npublished spectroscopic orbit results, to obtain masses and radii. A Bayesian\nmethod is used to estimate the age of the system for model grids with different\nmixing lengths and helium abundances. The radii are found to be\n$R_1=1.835\\pm0.014$ R$_{\\odot}$, $R_2=2.912\\pm0.014$ R$_{\\odot}$ and the masses\n$M_1=1.1973\\pm0.0037$ M$_{\\odot}$, $M_2=1.2473\\pm0.0039$ M$_{\\odot}$. From the\nbest-fit stellar models we infer a mixing length of 1.78, a helium abundance of\n$Y_{AI}=0.26^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ and an age of $4.39\\pm0.32$ Gyr. Times of primary\nminimum show the period of AI Phe is not constant. Currently, there are\ninsufficient data to determine the cause of this variation. Improved precision\nin the masses and radii have improved the age estimate, and allowed the mixing\nlength and helium abundance to be constrained. The eccentricity is now the\nlargest source of uncertainty in calculating the masses. More binaries with\nparameters measured to a similar level of precision would allow us to test for\nrelationships between helium abundance and mixing length.\n", "  We report on a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment on giant\nradio pulses (GPs) from the Crab pulsar in the radio 1.4 to 1.7 GHz range to\ndemonstrate a VLBI technique for searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs). We\ncarried out the experiment on 26 July 2014 using the Kashima 34 m and Usuda 64\nm radio telescopes of the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) with a baseline of about\n200 km. During the approximately 1 h observation, we could detect 35 GPs by\nhigh-time-resolution VLBI. Moreover, we determined the dispersion measure (DM)\nto be 56.7585 +/- 0.0025 on the basis of the mean DM of the 35 GPs detected by\nVLBI. We confirmed that the sensitivity of a detection of GPs using our\ntechnique is superior to that of a single-dish mode detection using the same\ntelescope.\n", "  An empirical semi-classical model have been proposed to investigate the\nnature of dynamic moment-of-inertia , of the super-deformed (SD) bands in\nnuclei of mass 150 region. The model incorporates an additional frequency\ndependent distortion, to the dynamic moment-of-inertia term akin to a\nvibrational component to explain the extreme spin structure of these bands.\nUsing this model two separate components to the dynamic moment of inertia,\n$\\Im^{(2)}$ have been identified for the SD band structure for the mass 150\nregion. Three distinct nature of the moment-of-inertia, also have been\nidentified using the two parameter model.\n", "  The bibliographical compilation of stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff,\nlogg, [Fe/H]) relying on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy\nstarted in the eighties with the so-called [Fe/H] catalogue, and was continued\nin 2010 with the PASTEL catalogue, which also includes determinations of Teff\nalone, based on various methods. Here we present an update of the PASTEL\ncatalogue. The main journals and the CDS database have been surveyed to find\nrelevant publications presenting new determinations of atmospheric parameters.\nAs of February 2016, PASTEL includes 64082 determinations of either Teff or\n(Teff, logg, [Fe/H]) for 31401 stars, corresponding to 1142 bibliographical\nreferences. Some 11197 stars have a determination of the three parameters\n(Teff, logg, [Fe/H]) with a high-quality spectroscopic metallicity.\n", "  The origin of the martian methane is still poorly understood. A plausible\nexplanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal\nalteration of basaltic crust or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks\nproducing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane. Once formed,\nmethane storage on Mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden\nclathrate reservoirs. Here, we alternatively suggest that chabazite and\nclinoptilolite, which belong to the family of zeolites, may form a plausible\nstorage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface. Because of the\nexistence of many volcanic terrains, zeolites are expected to be widespread on\nMars and their Global Equivalent Layer may range up to more than $\\sim$1 km,\naccording to the most optimistic estimates. If the martian methane present in\nchabazite and clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the\nsubsurface, the destabilization of a localized layer of a few millimeters per\nyear may be sufficient to explain the current observations. The sporadic\nrelease of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained\nisolated from the atmosphere during its evolution. The methane release over the\nages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts, seismic activity or\nerosion. If the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite and/or\nclinoptilolite prevails on Mars, then the presence of these zeolites around\nGale Crater could explain the variation of methane level observed by Mars\nScience Laboratory.\n", "  BepiColombo is a joint ESA/JAXA mission to Mercury with challenging\nobjectives regarding geophysics, geodesy and fundamental physics. The Mercury\nOrbiter Radioscience Experiment (MORE) is one of the on-board experiments,\nincluding three different but linked experiments: gravimetry, rotation and\nrelativity. The aim of the relativity experiment is the measurement of the\npost-Newtonian parameters. Thanks to accurate tracking between Earth and\nspacecraft, the results are expected to be very precise. However, the outcomes\nof the experiment strictly depends on our \"knowledge\" about solar system:\nephemerides, number of bodies (planets, satellites and asteroids) and their\nmasses. In this paper we describe a semi-analytic model used to perform a\ncovariance analysis to quantify the effects, on the relativity experiment, due\nto the uncertainties of solar system bodies parameters. In particular, our\nattention is focused on the Nordtvedt parameter $\\eta$ used to parametrize the\nstrong equivalence principle violation. After our analysis we estimated\n$\\sigma[\\eta]\\lessapprox 4.5\\times 10^{-5}$ which is about 1~order of magnitude\nlarger than the \"ideal\" case where masses of planets and asteroids have no\nerrors. The current value, obtained from ground based experiments and lunar\nlaser ranging measurements, is $\\sigma[\\eta]\\approx 4.4\\times 10^{-4}$.\nTherefore, we conclude that, even in presence of uncertainties on solar system\nparameters, the measurement of $\\eta$ by MORE can improve the current precision\nof about 1~order of magnitude.\n", "  The warm Neptune GJ436b was observed with HST/STIS at three different epochs\nin the stellar Ly-alpha line, showing deep, repeated transits caused by a giant\nexosphere of neutral hydrogen. The low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host\nstar was shown to play a major role in the dynamics of the escaping gas. Yet by\nitself it cannot explain the time-variable spectral features detected in each\ntransit. Here we investigate the combined role of radiative braking and stellar\nwind interactions using numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet\ncode (EVE) and we derive atmospheric and stellar properties through the direct\ncomparison of simulated and observed spectra. Our simulations match the last\ntwo epochs well. The observed sharp early ingresses come from the abrasion of\nthe planetary coma by the stellar wind. Spectra observed during the transit can\nbe produced by a dual exosphere of planetary neutrals (escaped from the upper\natmosphere of the planet) and neutralized protons (created by charge-exchange\nwith the stellar wind). We find similar properties at both epochs for the\nplanetary escape rate (2.5x10$^{8}$ g/s), the stellar photoionization rate\n(2x10$^{-5}$ /s), the stellar wind bulk velocity (85 km/s), and its kinetic\ndispersion velocity (10 km/s). We find high velocities for the escaping gas\n(50-60 km/s) that may indicate MHD waves that dissipate in the upper atmosphere\nand drive the planetary outflow. In the last epoch the high density of the\nstellar wind (3x10$^{3}$ /cm3) led to the formation of an exospheric tail\nmainly composed of neutralized protons. The observations of GJ436 b allow for\nthe first time to clearly separate the contributions of radiation pressure and\nstellar wind and to probe the regions of the exosphere shaped by each\nmechanism.\n", "  The intermediate-valent polymorphs $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-YbAlB$_4$ exhibit\nquantum criticality and other novel properties not usually associated with\nintermediate valence. Iron doping induces quantum criticality in\n$\\alpha$-YbAlB$_4$ and magnetic order in both compounds. We report results of\nmuon spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR) experiments in the intermediate-valent alloys\n$\\alpha$-YbAl$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$B$_4$, $x = 0.014$ and 0.25. For $x = 0.014$ we find\nno evidence for magnetic order down to 25 mK\\@. The dynamic muon spin\nrelaxation rate $\\lambda_d$ exhibits a power-law temperature dependence\n$\\lambda_d \\propto T^{-a}$, $a = 0.40(4)$, in the temperature range 100 mK--2\nK, in disagreement with predictions by theories of antiferromagnetic (AFM) or\nvalence quantum critical behavior. For $x = 0.25$, where AFM order develops in\nthe temperature range 7.5--10 K, where we find coexistence of meso- or\nmacroscopically segregated paramagnetic and AFM phases, with considerable\ndisorder in the latter down to 2 K.\n", "  In this paper, the secular full-orbit simulations of runaway electrons with\nsynchrotron radiation in tokamak fields are carried out using a relativistic\nvolume-preserving algorithm. Detailed phase-space behaviors of runaway\nelectrons are investigated in different dynamical timescales spanning 11\norders. When looking into the small timescale, i.e., the characteristic\ntimescale imposed by Lorentz force, the severely deformed helical trajectory of\nenergetic runaway electron is witnessed. A qualitative analysis of the\nneoclassical scattering, a kind of collisionless pitch-angle scattering\nphenomena, is provided when considering the coupling between the rotation of\nmomentum vector and the background magnetic field. In large timescale up to one\nsecond, it is found that the initial condition of runaway electrons in phase\nspace globally influences the pitch-angle scattering, the momentum evolution,\nand the loss-gain ratio of runaway energy evidently. However, the initial value\nhas little impact on the synchrotron energy limit. It is also discovered that\nthe parameters of tokamak device, such as the toroidal magnetic field, the loop\nvoltage, the safety factor profile, and the major radius, can modify the\nsynchrotron energy limit as well as the strength of neoclassical scattering.\nThe maximum runaway energy is also proved to be lower than the synchrotron\nlimit when the magnetic field ripple is considered.\n", "  We have studied a disordered $N_{\\rm c} \\times N_{\\rm c}$ plaquette Hubbard\nmodel on a two-dimensional square lattice at half-filling using a coherent\npotential approximation (CPA) in combination with a single-site dynamical mean\nfield theory (DMFT) approach with a paramagnetic bath. Such a model\nconveniently interpolates between the ionic Hubbard model at $N_{\\rm\nc}=\\sqrt{2}$ and the Anderson model at $N_{\\rm c} = \\infty$ and enables the\nanalysis of the various limiting properties. We confirmed that within the CPA\napproach a band insulator behavior appears for non-interacting strongly\ndisordered systems with a small plaquette size $N_{\\rm c} = 4$, while the\nparamagnetic Anderson insulator with nearly gapless density of states is\npresent for large plaquette sizes $N_{\\rm c}=48$. When the interaction $U$ is\nturned on in the strongly fluctuating random potential regions, the electrons\non the low energy states push each other into high energy states in DMFT in a\nparamagnetic bath and correlated metallic states with a quasiparticle peak and\nHubbard bands emerge, though a larger critical interaction $U$ is needed to\nobtain this state from the paramagnetic Anderson insulator ($N_{\\rm c}=48$)\nthan from the band insulator ($N_{\\rm c}=4$). Finally, we observe a Mott\ninsulator behavior in the strong interaction $U$ regions for both $N_{\\rm c}=4$\nand $N_{\\rm c}=48$ independent of the disorder strength. We discuss the\napplication of this model to real materials.\n", "  We study low energy excitations in the quantum breathing pyrochlore\nantiferromagnet Ba$_3$Yb$_2$Zn$_5$O$_{11}$ by combination of inelastic neutron\nscattering (INS) and thermodynamical properties measurements. The INS spectra\nare quantitatively explained by spin-1/2 single-tetrahedron model having $XXZ$\nanisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This model has a two-fold\ndegeneracy of the lowest-energy state per tetrahedron and well reproduces the\nmagnetization curve at 0.5 K and heat capacity above 1.5 K. At lower\ntemperatures, however, we observe a broad maximum in the heat capacity around\n63 mK, demonstrating that a unique quantum ground state is selected due to\nextra perturbations with energy scale smaller than the instrumental resolution\nof INS.\n", "  We perform simultaneous analysis of (1) matter radii, (2) $B(E2; 0^+\n\\rightarrow 2^+ )$ transition probabilities, and (3) excitation energies,\n$E(2^+)$ and $E(4^+)$, for $^{24-40}$Mg by using the beyond mean-field (BMF)\nframework with angular-momentum-projected configuration mixing with respect to\nthe axially symmetric $\\beta_2$ deformation with infinitesimal cranking. The\nBMF calculations successfully reproduce all of the data for $r_{\\rm m}$,\n$B(E2)$, and $E(2^+)$ and $E(4^+)$, indicating that it is quite useful for data\nanalysis, particularly for low-lying states. We also discuss the absolute value\nof the deformation parameter $\\beta_2$ deduced from measured values of $B(E2)$\nand $r_{\\rm m}$. This framework makes it possible to investigate the effects of\n$\\beta_2$ deformation, the change in $\\beta_2$ due to restoration of rotational\nsymmetry, $\\beta_2$ configuration mixing, and the inclusion of time-odd\ncomponents by infinitesimal cranking. Under the assumption of axial deformation\nand parity conservation, we clarify which effect is important for each of the\nthree measurements, and propose the kinds of BMF calculations that are\npractical for each of the three kinds of observables.\n", "  We numerically investigate the optical response of slowly scaling linear\nchains of mismatched silver nanoparticles. Hybridized plasmon chain resonances\nmanifest unusual local field distributions around the nanoparticles that result\nfrom symmetry breaking of the geometry. Importantly, we find localization\npatterns characterized by bright hot-spots alternated by what we term\n\\textit{dark} spots. A dark spot is associated to dark plasmons that have\ncollinear and antiparallel dipole moments along the chain. As a result, the\nfield amplification in the dark interjunction gap is extinguished for incident\npolarization parallel to the chain axis. Despite the strong plasmonic coupling,\nthe nanoparticles on the sides of this dark gap experience a dramatic\nasymmetric field amplification with amplitude gain contrast $> 2 \\times 10^2$.\nRemarkably, also for polarization orthogonal to the axis, gap hot-spots form on\nresonance.\n", "  Conversion of truncated Airy waves (AWs) carried by the second-harmonic (SH)\ncomponent into axisymmetric $\\chi^{2}$ solitons is considered in the 2D system\nwith the quadratic nonlinearity. The spontaneous conversion is driven by the\nparametric instability of the SH wave. The input in the form of the AW vortex\nis considered too. As a result, one, two, or three stable solitons emerge in a\nwell-defined form, unlike the recently studied 1D setting, where the picture is\nobscured by radiation jets. Shares of the total power captured by the emerging\nsolitons and conversion efficiency are found as functions of parameters of the\nAW input.\n", "  Muography is an imaging technique for large and dense structures as volcanoes\nor nuclear reactors using atmospheric muons. We applied this technique to the\nobservation of the Puy de D\\^ome, a volcano 2 km wide close to\nClermont-Ferrand, France. The detection is performed with a\n1m$\\times$1m$\\times$1.80m telescope made of 4 layers of single gap glass-RPCs\noperated in avalanche mode. The 1 cm$^2$ pad readout uses the Hardroc2 ASICs.\nThe three data taking campaigns over the last three years showed that a RPC\ndetector can be operated in-situ with good performances. Further developments\nto decrease the gas and power consumption and to improve the position and\ntiming resolution of the detector are ongoing.\n", "  We consider an ideal Bose gas contained in a cylinder in three spatial\ndimensions, subjected to a uniform gravitational field. It has been claimed by\nsome authors that there is discrepancy between the semi-classical and quantum\ncalculations in the thermal properties of such a system. To check this claim,\nwe calculate the heat capacity and isothermal compressibility of this system\nsemi-classically as well as from the quantum spectrum of the density of states.\nThe quantum calculation is done for a finite number of particles. We find good\nagreement between the two calculations when the number of particles are taken\nto be large. We also find that this system has the same thermal properties as\nan ideal five dimensional Bose gas.\n", "  We evaluate the entanglement entropy of a non-minimal coupling\nEinstein-scalar theory with two approaches in classical Euclidean gravity. By\nanalysing the equation of motion, we find that the entangled surface is\nrestricted to be a minimal surface. The entanglement entropy formula is derived\ndirectly from the approach of regularized conical singularity. On the other\nhand, by expressing Ricci scalar of the conical spacetime, we obtain the same\nresult. In addition, we generalize the reduced geometric approach to Riemann\ntensor and its derivations.\n", "  We analyse the kinematics of $\\sim 2000$ giant stars in the direction of the\nGalactic bulge, extracted from the Gaia-ESO survey in the region $-10^\\circ\n\\lesssim \\ell \\lesssim 10^\\circ$ and $-11^\\circ \\lesssim b \\lesssim -3^\\circ$.\nWe find distinct kinematic trends in the metal rich ($\\mathrm{[M/H]}>0$) and\nmetal poor ($\\mathrm{[M/H]}<0$) stars in the data. The velocity dispersion of\nthe metal-rich stars drops steeply with latitude, compared to a flat profile in\nthe metal-poor stars, as has been seen previously. We argue that the metal-rich\nstars in this region are mostly on orbits that support the boxy-peanut shape of\nthe bulge, which naturally explains the drop in their velocity dispersion\nprofile with latitude. The metal rich stars also exhibit peaky features in\ntheir line-of-sight velocity histograms, particularly along the minor axis of\nthe bulge. We propose that these features are due to stars on resonant orbits\nsupporting the boxy-peanut bulge. This conjecture is strengthened through the\ncomparison of the minor axis data with the velocity histograms of resonant\norbits generated in simulations of buckled bars. The 'banana' or 2:1:2 orbits\nprovide strongly bimodal histograms with narrow velocity peaks that resemble\nthe Gaia-ESO metal-rich data.\n", "  Protein aggregation is of great importance in biology, e.g., in amyloid\nfibrillation. The aggregation processes that occur at the cellular scale must\nbe highly stochastic in nature because of the statistical number fluctuations\nthat arise on account of the small system size at the cellular scale. We study\nthe nucleated reversible self-assembly of monomeric building blocks into\npolymer-like aggregates using the method of kinetic Monte Carlo. Kinetic Monte\nCarlo, being inherently stochastic, allows us to study the impact of\nfluctuations on the polymerisation reactions. One of the most important\ncharacteristic features in this kind of problem is the existence of a lag phase\nbefore self-assembly takes off, which is what we focus attention on. We study\nthe associated lag time as a function of the system size and kinetic pathway.\nWe find that the leading order stochastic contribution to the lag time before\npolymerisation commences is inversely proportional to the system volume for\nlarge-enough system size for all nine reaction pathways tested. Finite-size\ncorrections to this do depend on the kinetic pathway.\n", "  We have recently discovered five Lyman continuum leaking galaxies at z~0.3,\nselected for their compactness, intense star-formation, and high [OIII]/[OII]\nratio (Izotov et al. 2016ab). Here we derive their ionizing photon production\nefficiency, a fundamental quantity for inferring the number of photons\navailable to reionize the Universe, for the first time for galaxies with\nconfirmed strong Lyman continuum escape (fesc~6-13%). We find an ionizing\nphoton production per unit UV luminosity, which is a factor 2-6 times higher\nthan the canonical value when reported to their observed UV luminosity. After\ncorrection for extinction this value is close to the canonical value. The\nproperties of our five Lyman continuum leakers are found to be very similar to\nthose of the confirmed z=3.218 leaker Ion2 from de Barros et al. (2016) and\nvery similar to those of typical star-forming galaxies at z>~6. Our results\nsuggest that UV bright galaxies at high-z such as Lyman break galaxies can be\nLyman continuum leakers and that their contribution to cosmic reionization may\nbe underestimated.\n", "  We investigate irregularity factors for a self-gravitating spherical star\nevolving in the presence of imperfect fluid. We explore the gravitational field\nequations and the dynamical equations with the systematic construction in\n$f(R,T)$ gravity, where $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.\nFurthermore, we analyze two well-known differential equations (which occupy\nprincipal importance in the exploration of causes of energy density\ninhomogeneities) with the help of the Weyl tensor and the conservation laws.\nThe irregularity factors for a spherical star are examined for particular cases\nof dust, isotropic and anisotropic fluids in dissipative and non-dissipative\nregimes in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. It is found that as the\ncomplexity in the matter with the anisotropic stresses increases, the\ninhomogeneity factor has more correspondences to one of the structure scalars.\n", "  An extended formula for orbital susceptibility including corrections of the\nPeierls phase is introduced. By using the new developed formula, the orbital\nsusceptibility of benzene is estimated analytically on the basis of the $\\pi$\nelectron approximation. As a result, it is found that the orbital\nsusceptibility is 1.2 times larger than that estimated only from the Peierls\nphase. The Coulomb interaction dependence of the orbital susceptibility of\nbenzene is also discussed by using exact diagonalization. It is found that the\nabsolute value of the orbital susceptibility decreases as the Coulomb\ninteraction increases, while the ratio of the orbital susceptibility with and\nwithout the corrections of the Peierls phase increases. Finally, we discuss the\norbital susceptibility of a single-band tight-binding model on a square\nlattice. We clarify that the correction of the Peierls phase is comparable to\nthe Landau--Peierls orbital susceptibility and that it corresponds to the Fermi\nsea term.\n", "  The electric noise can be an important limitation for applications of\nconducting elements of size in the nanometer range. The intrinsic electrical\nnoise of prospective materials for opto-spintronics applications like ZnO has\nnot been characterized yet. In this study we have investigated the conductivity\nfluctuations in 10~nm thick current paths produced by proton implantation of\nZnO microwires at room temperature. The voltage noise under a constant dc\ncurrent bias in undoped as well as in Li-doped microwires is characterized by\n$1/f^a$ power spectra with $a \\sim 1$. The noise intensity scales with the\nsquare of the bias current pointing out to bias-independent resistivity\nfluctuations as a source of the observed noise. The normalized power spectral\ndensity appears inversely proportional to the number of carriers in the probed\nsample volume, in agreement with the phenomenological Hooge law. For the\nproton-implanted ZnO microwire and at 1~Hz we obtain a normalized power\nspectral density as low as $\\sim 10^{-11}~$Hz$^{-1}$.\n", "  We perform a kinematic analysis of galaxies at $z\\sim2$ in the COSMOS legacy\nfield using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy from Keck/MOSFIRE as part of the\nZFIRE survey. Our sample consists of 75 Ks-band selected star-forming galaxies\nfrom the ZFOURGE survey with stellar masses ranging from\nlog(M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\odot}$)$=9.0-11.0$, 28 of which are members of a known\noverdensity at $z=2.095$. We measure H$\\alpha$ emission-line integrated\nvelocity dispersions ($\\sigma_{\\rm int}$) from 50$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, consistent\nwith other emission-line studies of $z\\sim2$ field galaxies. From these data we\nestimate virial, stellar, and gas masses and derive correlations between these\nproperties for cluster and field galaxies at $z\\sim2$. We find evidence that\nbaryons dominate within the central effective radius. However, we find no\nstatistically significant differences between the cluster and the field, and\nconclude that the kinematics of star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim2$ are not\nsignificantly different between the cluster and field environments.\n", "  The ranges of transmission of the mobiles in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network are not\nuniform in reality. They are affected by the temperature fluctuation in air,\nobstruction due to the solid objects, even the humidity difference in the\nenvironment, etc. How the varying range of transmission of the individual\nactive elements affects the global connectivity in the network may be an\nimportant practical question to ask. Here a new model of percolation phenomena,\nwith an additional source of disorder, has been introduced for a theoretical\nunderstanding of this problem. As in ordinary percolation, sites of a square\nlattice are occupied randomly with the probability $p$. Each occupied site is\nthen assigned a circular disc of random value $R$ for its radius. A bond is\ndefined to be occupied if and only if the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ of the discs\ncentered at the ends satisfy certain pre-defined condition. In a very general\nformulation, one divides the $R_1 - R_2$ plane into two regions by an arbitrary\nclosed curve. One defines that a point within one region represents an occupied\nbond, otherwise it is a vacant bond. Study of three different rules under this\ngeneral formulation, indicates that the percolation threshold is always larger\nand varies continuously. This threshold has two limiting values, one is\n$p_c$(sq), the percolation threshold for the ordinary site percolation on the\nsquare lattice and the other being unity. The variation of the thresholds are\ncharacterized by exponents, which are not known in the literature. In a special\ncase, all lattice sites are occupied by discs of random radii $R \\in \\{0,R_0\\}$\nand a percolation transition is observed with $R_0$ as the control variable,\nsimilar to the site occupation probability.\n", "  The tetrad method is used for an introduction of local Lorentz frames and a\ndetailed analysis of local Lorentz transformations. A formulation of equations\nof motion in local Lorentz frames is based on the Pomeransky-Khriplovich\ngravitoelectromagnetic fields. These fields are calculated in the most\nimportant special cases and their local Lorentz transformations are determined.\nThe local Lorentz transformations and the Pomeransky-Khriplovich\ngravitoelectromagnetic fields are applied for a rigorous derivation of a\ngeneral equation for the Thomas effect in Riemannian spacetimes and for a\nconsideration of Einstein's equivalence principle and the Mathisson force.\n", "  The recent discovery of the topologically protected surface states in the\nbeta-phase of PdBi2 has reignited the research interest in this class of\nsuperconductors. Here, we show results of our muon spin relaxation and rotation\n(muSR) measurements carried out to investigate the superconducting and magnetic\nproperties and the topological effect in the superconducting ground state of\nbeta-PdBi2. Zero-field muSR data reveal that no sizeable spontaneous\nmagnetization arises with the onset of superconductivity implying that the time\nreversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state of beta-PdBi2.\nFurther, a strong diamagnetic shift of the applied field has been observed in\nthe transverse-field (TF) muSR experiments, indicating that any triplet-pairing\nchannel, if present, does not dominate the superconducting condensate. Using\nTF-muSR, we estimate that the magnetic penetration depth is 263(10) nm at zero\ntemperature. Temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth provides\nevidence for the existence of a nodeless single s-wave type isotropic energy\ngap of 0.78(1) meV at zero temperature. Our results further suggest that the\ntopologically protected surface states have no effect on the bulk of the\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Long-term synoptic observations in the resonance line of Ca II K constitute a\nfundamental database for a variety of retrospective analyses of the state of\nthe solar magnetism. Synoptic Ca II K observations began in late 1904 at the\nKodaikanal Observatory, in India. In early 1970s, the National Solar\nObservatory (NSO) at Sacramento Peak (USA) started a new program of daily\nSun-as-a-star observations in the Ca II K line. Today the NSO is continuing\nthese observations through its Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the\nSun (SOLIS) facility. These different data sets can be combined into a single\ndisk-integrated Ca II K index time series that describes the average properties\nof the chromospheric emission over several solar cycles. We present such a Ca\nII K composite and discuss its correlation with the new entirely revised\nsunspot number data series. For this preliminary investigation, the scaling\nfactor between pairs of time series was determined assuming a simple linear\nmodel for the relationship between the monthly mean values during the duration\nof overlapping observations.\n", "  We use the concept of entropy power to derive a new one-parameter class of\ninformation-theoretic uncertainty relations for pairs of conjugate observables\nin an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This class constitutes an infinite\ntower of higher-order statistics uncertainty relations, which allows one in\nprinciple to determine the shape of the underlying information-distribution\nfunction by measuring the relevant entropy powers. We illustrate the capability\nof the new class by discussing two examples: superpositions of vacuum and\nsqueezed states and the Cauchy-type heavy-tailed wave function.\n", "  The behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi_3$ and its relation to the\nspin-glass transition temperature $T_f$, in the presence of random fields, are\ninvestigated. To accomplish this task, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is\nstudied through the replica formalism, within a one-step\nreplica-symmetry-breaking procedure. In addition, the dependence of the\nAlmeida-Thouless eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\rm AT}$ (replicon) on the random fields\nis analyzed. Particularly, in absence of random fields, the temperature $T_f$\ncan be traced by a divergence in the spin-glass susceptibility $\\chi_{\\rm SG}$,\nwhich presents a term inversely proportional to the replicon $\\lambda_{\\rm\nAT}$. As a result of a relation between $\\chi_{\\rm SG}$ and $\\chi_3$, the\nlatter also presents a divergence at $T_f$, which comes as a direct consequence\nof $\\lambda_{\\rm AT}=0$ at $T_f$. However, our results show that, in the\npresence of random fields, $\\chi_3$ presents a rounded maximum at a temperature\n$T^{*}$, which does not coincide with the spin-glass transition temperature\n$T_f$ (i.e., $T^* > T_f$ for a given applied random field). Thus, the maximum\nvalue of $\\chi_3$ at $T^*$ reflects the effects of the random fields in the\nparamagnetic phase, instead of the non-trivial ergodicity breaking associated\nwith the spin-glass phase transition. It is also shown that $\\chi_3$ still\nmaintains a dependence on the replicon $\\lambda_{\\rm AT}$, although in a more\ncomplicated way, as compared with the case without random fields. These results\nare discussed in view of recent observations in the LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$\ncompound.\n", "  We report the study of the skyrmion state near the surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$\nusing soft resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) at the Cu $L_3$ edge.\nWithin the lateral sampling area of $200 \\times 200$ $\\mu$m$^2$, we found a\nlong-range-ordered skyrmion lattice phase as well as the formation of skyrmion\ndomains via the multiple splitting of the diffraction spots. In a recent REXS\nstudy of the skyrmion phase of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 167202\n(2014)], Langner et al. reported the observation of the unexpected existence of\ntwo distinct skyrmion sublattices that arise from inequivalent Cu sites, and\nthat the rotation and superposition of the two periodic structures leads to a\nmoir\\'{e} pattern. However, we find no energy splitting of the Cu peak in x-ray\nabsorption measurements and, instead, discuss alternative origins of the peak\nsplitting. In particular, we find that for magnetic field directions deviating\nfrom the major cubic axes, a multidomain skyrmion lattice state is obtained,\nwhich consistently explains the splitting of the magnetic spots into two - and\nmore - peaks.\n", "  Exotic quantum states and fractionalized magnetic excitations, such as\nspinons in one-dimensional chains, are generally viewed as belonging to the\ndomain of 3d transition metal systems with spins 1/2. Our neutron scattering\nexperiments on the 4f-electron metal Yb$_2$Pt$_2$Pb overturn this common\nwisdom. We observe broad magnetic continuum dispersing in only one direction,\nwhich indicates that the underlying elementary excitations are spinons carrying\nfractional spin-1/2. These spinons are the quantum dynamics of the anisotropic,\norbital-dominated Yb moments, and thus these effective quantum spins are\nemergent variables that encode the electronic orbitals. The unique birthmark of\ntheir unusual origin is that only longitudinal spin fluctuations are\nmeasurable, while the transverse excitations such as spin waves are virtually\ninvisible to magnetic neutron scattering. The proliferation of these\norbital-spinons strips the electrons of their orbital identity, and we thus\nreport here a new electron fractionalization phenomenon, charge-orbital\nseparation.\n", "  Near-Gaussian probability densities are common in many important physical\napplications. Here we develop an asymptotic expansion methodology for computing\nentropic functionals for such densities. The expansion proposed is a close\nrelative of standard perturbation expansions in quantum field theory. We give\nnovel results on the low-order effects of non-Gaussian even moments and\nasymmetry (e.g. skewness) on the entropy. The asymptotic expansion is also used\nto define a best fit maximum entropy density given a set of observed low order\nmoments. The maximum entropy density estimation technique consists simply of\nthe solution of a small set of algebraic equations and is therefore more\nstraightforward numerically than classical maximum-entropy methods which rely\non sophisticated convex optimization techniques.\n", "  We have developed a storage bottle for ultracold neutrons (UCN) in order to\nmeasure the UCN density at the beamports of the Paul Scherrer Institute's (PSI)\nUCN source. This paper describes the design, construction and commissioning of\nthe robust and mobile storage bottle with a volume comparable to typical\nstorage experiments 32 liter e.g. searching for an electric dipole moment of\nthe neutron.\n", "  We present a thin subwavelength material that can be flush mounted to a duct\nand which gives a large wide band attenuation at remarkably low frequencies in\nair flow channels. To decrease the material thickness, the sound is slowed in\nthe material using folded side branch tubes. The impedance of the material is\ncompared to the optimal value, which differs greatly from the characteristic\nimpedance. In particular, the viscous and thermal effects have to be very small\nto have high transmission losses. Grazing flow on this material increases the\nlosses at the interface between the flow and the material.\n", "  A path integral formalism has been proposed recently for non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics applications by the author. In this contribution we outline\nan efficient method for its numerical evaluation. The method used is based on\nthe multiscale MCMC method of Ceperley and co-workers in quantum applications.\nA significant new feature of the method proposed is that the time endpoint is\nnot fixed and indeed the endpoint sample is the principle object of interest.\n", "  High resolution inelastic neutron scattering reveals that the elementary\nmagnetic excitations in multiferroic MnWO4 consist of low energy dispersive\nelectromagnons in addition to the well-known spin-wave excitations. The latter\ncan well be modeled by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with magnetic exchange coupling\nextending to the 12th nearest neighbor. They exhibit a spin-wave gap of 0.61(1)\nmeV. Two electromagnon branches appear at lower energies of 0.07(1) meV and\n0.45(1) meV at the zone center. They reflect the dynamic magnetoelectric\ncoupling and persist in both, the collinear magnetic and paraelectric AF1\nphase, and the spin spiral ferroelectric AF2 phase. These excitations are\nassociated with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction, which is\nsignificant due to the rather large spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model is a canonical model for emerging\ndisease outbreaks. Such outbreaks are naturally modeled as taking place on\nnetworks. A theoretical challenge in network epidemiology is the dynamic\ncorrelations coming from that if one node is occupied, or infected (for disease\nspreading models), then its neighbors are likely to be occupied. By combining\ntwo theoretical approaches---the heterogeneous mean-field theory and the\neffective degree method---we are able to include these correlations in an\nanalytical solution of the SIS model. We derive accurate expressions for the\naverage prevalence (fraction of infected) and epidemic threshold. We also\ndiscuss how to generalize the approach to a larger class of stochastic\npopulation models.\n", "  We describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of a\none-dimensional silicon photonic crystal cavity in which a central slot is used\nto enhance the overlap between highly localized optical and mechanical modes.\nThe optical mode has an extremely small mode volume of 0.017\n$(\\lambda_{vac}/n)^3$, and an optomechanical vacuum coupling rate of 310 kHz is\nmeasured. With optical quality factors up to $1.2 \\cdot 10^5$, fabricated\ndevices are in the resolved-sideband regime. The electric field has its maximum\nat the slot wall and couples to the in-plane breathing motion of the slot. The\noptomechanical coupling is thus dominated by the moving-boundary effect, which\nwe simulate to be six times greater than the photoelastic effect, in contrast\nto most structures, where the photoelastic effect is often the primary coupling\nmechanism.\n", "  We show that the recently measured UV luminosity functions of ultra-faint\nlensed galaxies at z= 6 in the Hubble Frontier Fields provide an unprecedented\nprobe for the mass m_X of the Warm Dark Matter candidates independent of\nbaryonic physics. Comparing the measured abundance of the faintest galaxies\nwith the maximum number density of dark matter halos in WDM cosmologies sets a\nrobust limit m_X> 2.9 keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at a\n1-sigma confidence level, m_X> 2.4 keV at 2-sigma, and m_X> 2.1 keV at 3-sigma.\nThese constitute the tightest constraints on WDM particle mass derived to date\nindependently of the baryonic physics involved in galaxy formation. We discuss\nthe impact of our results on the production mechanism of sterile neutrinos. In\nparticular, if sterile neutrinos are responsible for the 3.5 keV line reported\nin observations of X-ray clusters, our results firmly rule out the\nDodelson-Widrow production mechanism, and yield m_{sterile}> 6.1 keV for\nsterile neutrinos produced via the Shi-Fuller mechanism.\n", "  This work estimates the probability of $\\mu$ to $e$ neutrino oscillation with\ntwo sterile neutrinos using a 5x5 U-matrix, an extension of the previous\nestimate with one sterile neutrino and a 4x4 U-matrix. The sterile\nneutrino-active neutrino mass differences and the mixing angles of the two\nsterile neutrinos with the three active neutrinos are taken from recent\npublications, and the oscillation probability for one sterile neutrino is\ncompared to the previous estimate.\n", "  We present the first direct image of the high-metallicity gas component in a\nplanetary nebula (NGC 6778), taken with the OSIRIS Blue Tunable Filter centered\non the O II 4649+50 angstroms optical recombination lines (ORLs) at the 10.4m\nGran Telescopio Canarias. We show that the emission of these faint O II ORLs is\nconcentrated in the central parts of the planetary nebula and is not spatially\ncoincident either with emission coming from the bright [O III] 5007 angstroms\ncollisionally excited line (CEL) or the bright H alpha recombination line. From\nmonochromatic emission line maps taken with VIMOS at the 8.2m Very Large\nTelescope, we find that the spatial distribution of the emission from the\nauroral [O III] 4363 line resembles that of the O II ORLs but differs from\nnebular [O III] 5007 CEL distribution, implying a temperature gradient inside\nthe planetary nebula. The centrally peaked distribution of the O II emission\nand the differences with the [O III] and H I emission profiles are consistent\nwith the presence of an H-poor gas whose origin may be linked to the binarity\nof the central star. However, determination of the spatial distribution of the\nORLs and CELs in other PNe, and a comparison of their dynamics is needed to\nfurther constrain the geometry and ejection mechanism of the metal-rich\n(H-poor) component and hence, understand the origin of the abundance\ndiscrepancy problem in PNe.\n", "  We investigate the effect of coherent population trapping (CPT) in an atom\ninter-ferometer gravimeter based on the use of stimulated Raman transitions. We\nfind that CPT leads to significant phase shifts, of order of a few mrad, which\nmay compromise the accuracy of inertial measurements. We show that this effect\nis rejected by the k-reversal technique, which consists in averaging inertial\nmeasurements performed with two opposite orientations of the Raman wavevector\nk, provided that internal states at the input of the interferometer are kept\nidentical for both configurations.\n", "  The flexibility of short DNA fragments is studied by a Hamiltonian model\nwhich treats the inter-strand and intra-strand forces at the level of the base\npair. The elastic response of a set of homogeneous helices to externally\napplied forces is obtained by computing the average bending angles between\nadjacent base pairs along the molecule axis. The ensemble averages are\nperformed over a room temperature equilibrium distribution of base pair\nseparations and bending fluctuations. The analysis of the end-to-end distances\nand persistence lengths shows that even short sequences with less than $100$\nbase pairs maintain a significant bendability ascribed to thermal fluctuational\neffects and kinks with large bending angles. The discrepancies between the\noutcomes of the discrete model and those of the worm-like-chain model are\nexamined pointing out the inadequacy of the latter on short length scales.\n", "  Electrostatic confinement of charge carriers in graphene is governed by Klein\ntunneling, a relativistic quantum process in which particle-hole transmutation\nleads to unusual anisotropic transmission at pn junction boundaries. Reflection\nand transmission at these novel potential barriers should affect the quantum\ninterference of electronic wavefunctions near these boundaries. Here we report\nthe use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to map the electronic structure\nof Dirac fermions confined by circular graphene pn junctions. These effective\nquantum dots were fabricated using a new technique involving local manipulation\nof defect charge within the insulating substrate beneath a graphene monolayer.\nInside such graphene quantum dots we observe energy levels corresponding to\nquasi-bound states and we spatially visualize the quantum interference patterns\nof confined electrons. Dirac fermions outside these quantum dots exhibit\nFriedel oscillation-like behavior. Bolstered with a theoretical model\ndescribing relativistic particles in a harmonic oscillator potential, our\nfindings yield new insight into the spatial behavior of electrostatically\nconfined Dirac fermions.\n", "  Large area lensing surveys are expected to make it possible to use cosmic\nshear tomography as a tool to severely constrain cosmological parameters. To\nthis end, one typically relies on second order statistics such as the two -\npoint correlation fucntion and its Fourier counterpart, the power spectrum.\nMoving a step forward, we wonder whether and to which extent higher order\nstastistics can improve the lensing Figure of Merit (FoM). In this first paper\nof a series, we investigate how second, third and fourth order lensing\nconvergence moments can be measured and use as probe of the underlying\ncosmological model. We use simulated data and investigate the impact on moments\nestimate of the map reconstruction procedure, the cosmic variance, and the\nintrinsic ellipticity noise. We demonstrate that, under realistic assumptions,\nit is indeed possible to use higher order moments as a further lensing probe.\n", "  Generic black hole binaries radiate gravitational waves anisotropically,\nimparting a recoil, or kick, velocity to the merger remnant. If a component of\nthe kick along the line of sight is present, gravitational waves emitted during\nthe final orbits and merger will be gradually Doppler shifted as the kick\nbuilds up. We develop a simple prescription to capture this effect in existing\nwaveform models, showing that future gravitational wave experiments will be\nable to perform direct measurements, not only of the black hole kick velocity,\nbut also of its accumulation profile. In particular, the eLISA space mission\nwill measure supermassive black hole kick velocities as low as ~500 km/s, which\nare expected to be a common outcome of black hole binary coalescence following\ngalaxy mergers. Black hole kicks thus constitute a promising new observable in\nthe growing field of gravitational wave astronomy.\n", "  Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions are employed for analyzing systems of\nn-qubits, and a qubit with a qudit. Negative eigenvalues, obtained by\npartial-transpose (PT) plus local unitary transformations (PTU) for one qubit\nfrom the whole system, are used for indicating inseparability. A sufficient\ncriterion for full separability of the n-qubits and qubit-qudit systems is\ngiven. We use the singular value decomposition (SVD) for improving the\ncriterion for full separability. General properties of entanglement and\nseparability are analyzed for a system of a qubit and a qudit and n-qubits\nsystems, with emphasis on maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) (i.e., density\nmatrices rho(MDS) for which tracing over any subsystem gives the unit density\nmatrix). A sufficient condition that rho(MDS) is not separable is that it has\nan eigenvalue larger than 1/d for a qubit and a qudit, and larger than\n1/2^(n-1) for n-qubits system. The PTU transformation does not change the\neigenvalues of the n-qubits MDS density matrices for odd n. Thus the\nPeres-Horodecki criterion does not give any information about entanglement of\nthese density matrices, but this criterion is useful for indicating\ninseparability for even n. The changes of the entanglement and separability\nproperties of the GHZ state, the Braid entangled state and the W state by\nmixing them with white noise are analyzed by the use of the present methods.\nThe entanglement and separability properties of the GHZ-diagonal density\nmatrices, composed of mixture of 8 GHZ density matrices with probabilities\np(i), is analyzed as function of these probabilities. In some cases we show\nthat the Peres-Horodecki criterion is both sufficient and necessary.\n", "  Time resolved intensity cross-correlation measurements of radiative cascades\nare used for studying non-radiative relaxation processes of excited carriers\nconfined in semiconductor quantum dots. We spectrally identify indirect\nradiative cascades which include intermediate phonon assisted relaxations. The\nenergy of the first photon reveals the multicarrier configuration prior to the\nnon-radiative relaxation, while the energy of the second photon reveals the\nconfiguration after the relaxation. The intensity cross correlation\nmeasurements thus provide quantitative measures of the non-radiative processes\nand their selection rules. We construct a model which accurately describes the\nexperimental observations in terms of the electron-phonon and electron-hole\nexchange interactions. Our measurements and model provide a new tool for\nengineering relaxation processes in semiconductor nanostructures.\n", "  The current world-average of the strong coupling at the Z pole mass,\n$\\alpha_s(m^2_{Z}) = 0.1181 \\pm 0.0013$, is obtained from a comparison of\nperturbative QCD calculations computed, at least, at\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy, to a set of 6 groups of experimental\nobservables: (i) lattice QCD \"data\", (ii) $\\tau$ hadronic decays, (iii) proton\nstructure functions, (iv) event shapes and jet rates in $e^+e^-$ collisions,\n(v) Z boson hadronic decays, and (vi) top-quark cross sections in p-p\ncollisions. In addition, at least 8 other $\\alpha_s$ extractions, usually with\na lower level of theoretical and/or experimental precision today, have been\nproposed: pion, $\\Upsilon$, W hadronic decays; soft and hard fragmentation\nfunctions; jets cross sections in pp, e-p and $\\gamma$-p collisions; and photon\nF$_2$ structure function in $\\gamma\\,\\gamma$ collisions. These 14 $\\alpha_s$\ndeterminations are reviewed, and the perspectives of reduction of their present\nuncertainties are discussed.\n", "  When a supernova explosion occurs in neighbors around hundreds pc, current\nand future neutrino detectors are expected to observe neutrinos from the\npresupernova star before the explosion. We show a possibility for obtaining the\nevidence for burning processes in the central region of presupernova stars\nthough the observations of neutrino signals by current and future neutrino\ndetectors such as KamLAND, JUNO, and Hyper-Kamiokande. We also investigate\nsupernova alarms using neutrinos from presupernova stars in neighbors. If a\nsupernova explodes at ~ 200 pc, future 20 kton size liquid scintillation\ndetectors are expected to observe hundreds neutrino events. We also propose a\npossibility of the detection of neutrino events by Gd-loaded Hyper-Kamiokande\nusing delayed $\\gamma$-ray signals. These detectors could observe detailed time\nvariation of neutrino events. The neutrino emission rate increases by the core\ncontraction in the final evolution stage. However, the O and Si shell burnings\nsuppress the neutrino emission for a moment. The observed decrease in the\nneutrino event rate before hours to the explosion is possibly evidence for the\nshell burnings. The observations of detailed time evolution of presupernova\nneutrino events could reveal properties of burning processes in the central\nregion of presupernova stars.\n", "  In this paper we consider the models of the accelerated expanding large scale\nuniverse~(according to general relativity) containing a generalized holographic\ndark energy with a Nojiri - Odintsov cut - off. The second component of the\ndarkness is assumed to be the pressureless cold dark matter according to\nobserved symmetries of the large scale universe. Moreover, we assume specific\nforms of the interaction between these two components and besides the\ncosmographic analysis, we discuss appropriate results from $Om$ and $Om3$\nanalysis and organize a closer look to the models via the statefinder hierarchy\nanalysis, too. In this way we study mainly impact of the interaction on the\ndynamics of the background of our universe~(within specific forms of\ninteraction). To complete the cosmographic analysis, the present day values of\nthe statefinder parameters $(r,s)$ and $(\\omega^{\\prime}_{de}, \\omega_{de})$\nhas been estimated for all cases and the validity of the generalized second law\nof thermodynamics is demonstrated. Our study showed that theoretical results\nfrom considered phenomenological models are consistent with the available\nobservational data and symmetries.\n", "  We show that the thermodynamic limit of the ground state energy in the mixed\np-spin model can be identified as a variational problem. This gives a natural\ngeneralization of the Parisi formula at zero temperature.\n", "  The independent participant model is generalized for skewness and kurtosis.\nThe obtained relations allow to calculate the fluctuations of an arbitrarily\nhigh order. From the comparison with the SPS and the LHC data it is found that\nthe participants are not nucleons. The contribution of the participant\nfluctuations increases with the order of fluctuations. The 5% centrality bins\nselected for the analysis at the LHC by ALICE seems to be too large. The\nfluctuations measures are dominated by the fluctuations of participants there.\nThe method to quantify the value of participant number fluctuations\nexperimentally is proposed.\n", "  Blazar radiation is dominated by a relativistic jet which can be modeled at\nfirst approximation using just two intrinsic parameters - the Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma$ and the viewing angle $\\theta$. Blazar jet observations are often\nbeamed due to relativistic effects, complicating the understanding of these\nintrinsic properties. The most common way to estimate blazar Lorentz factors\nneeds the estimation of apparent jet speeds and Doppler beaming factors. We\npresent a new and independent method of constructing the blazar Lorentz factor\ndistribution, using the optical fundamental plane of black hole activity. The\noptical fundamental plane is a plane stretched out by both the supermassive\nblack holes and the X-ray binaries, in the 3D space provided by their [OIII]\nline luminosity, radio luminosity and black hole mass. We use the intrinsic\nradio luminosity obtained from the optical fundamental plane to constrain the\nboosting parameters of the VLBA Imaging and Polarimetry Survey (VIPS) blazar\nsample. We find a blazar bulk Lorentz factor distribution in the form of a\npower law as $N(\\Gamma) \\propto \\Gamma^{-2.1 \\pm 0.4}$ for the $\\Gamma$ range\nof 1 to 40. We also discuss the viewing angle distribution of the blazars and\nthe dependence of our results on the input parameters.\n", "  The hot $\\gamma$~Doradus stars have multiple low frequencies characteristic\nof $\\gamma$~Dor or SPB variables, but are located between the red edge of the\nSPB and the blue edge of the $\\gamma$~Dor instability strips where all\nlow-frequency modes are stable in current models of these stars. Though\n$\\delta$~Sct stars also have low frequencies, there is no sign of high\nfrequencies in hot $\\gamma$~Dor stars. We obtained spectra to refine the\nlocations of some of these stars in the H-R diagram and conclude that these\nare, indeed, anomalous pulsating stars. The Maia variables have multiple high\nfrequencies characteristic of $\\beta$~Cep and $\\delta$~Sct stars, but lie\nbetween the red edge of the $\\beta$~Cep and the blue edge of the $\\delta$~Sct\ninstability strips. We compile a list of all Maia candidates and obtain spectra\nof two of these stars. Again, it seems likely that these are anomalous\npulsating stars which are currently not understood.\n", "  The supermassive black hole at the centre of the Galaxy flares at least daily\nin the infrared (IR) and X-ray bands, yet the process driving these flares is\nstill unknown. So far detailed analysis has only been performed on a few bright\nflares. In particular, the broadband spectral modelling suffers from a strong\nlack of simultaneous data. However, new monitoring campaigns now provide data\non thousands of flaring events, allowing a statistical analysis of the flare\nproperties. In this paper, we investigate the X-ray and IR flux distributions\nof the flare events. Using a self-consistent calculation of the particle\ndistribution, we model the statistical properties of the flares. Based on a\nprevious work on single flares, we consider two families of models: pure\nsynchrotron models and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. We investigate\nthe effect of fluctuations in some relevant parameters (e.g. acceleration\nproperties, density, magnetic field) on the flux distributions. The\ndistribution of these parameters is readily derived from the flux distributions\nobserved at different wavelengths. In both scenarios, we find that fluctuations\nof the power injected in accelerated particles plays a major role. This must be\ndistributed as a power-law (with different indices in each model). In the\nsynchrotron dominated scenario, we derive the most extreme values of the\nacceleration power required to reproduce the brightest flares. In that model,\nthe distribution of the acceleration slope fluctuations is constrained and in\nthe SSC scenario we constrain the distributions of the correlated magnetic\nfield and flow density variations.\n", "  In the distant past, telescopes were known, first and foremost, for the sizes\nof their apertures. Advances in technology are now enabling astronomers to\nbuild extremely powerful instruments to the extent that instruments have now\nachieved importance comparable or even exceeding the usual importance accorded\nto the apertures of the telescopes. However, the cost of successive generations\nof instruments has risen at a rate noticeably above that of the rate of\ninflation. Here, given the vast sums of money now being expended on optical\ntelescopes and their instrumentation, I argue that astronomers must undertake\n\"cost-benefit\" analysis for future planning. I use the scientific output of the\nfirst two decades of the W. M. Keck Observatory as a laboratory for this\npurpose. I find, in the absence of upgrades, that the time to reach peak paper\nproduction for an instrument is about six years. The prime lifetime of\ninstruments (sans upgrades), as measured by citations returns, is about a\ndecade. Well thought out and timely upgrades increase and sometimes even double\nthe useful lifetime. I investigate how well instrument builders are rewarded. I\nfind acknowledgements ranging from almost 100% to as low as 60%. Next, given\nthe increasing cost of operating optical telescopes, the management of existing\nobservatories continue to seek new partnerships. This naturally raises the\nquestion \"What is the cost of a single night of telescope time\". I provide a\nrational basis to compute this quantity. I then end the paper with some\nthoughts on the future of large ground-based optical telescopes, bearing in\nmind the explosion of synoptic precision photometric, astrometric and imaging\nsurveys across the electromagnetic spectrum, the increasing cost of\ninstrumentation and the rise of mega instruments.\n", "  The presence of an external tidal field often induces significant dynamical\nevolutionary effects on the internal kinematics of star clusters. Previous\nstudies investigating the restricted three-body problem with applications to\nstar cluster dynamics have shown that unbound stars on retrograde orbits (with\nrespect to the direction of the cluster's orbit) are more stable against escape\nthan prograde orbits, and predicted that a star cluster might acquire\nretrograde rotation through preferential escape of stars on prograde orbits. In\nthis study we present evidence of this prediction, but we also illustrate that\nthere are additional effects that cannot be accounted for by the preferential\nescape of prograde orbits alone. Specifically, in the early evolution,\ninitially underfilling models increase their fraction of retrograde stars\nwithout losing significant mass, and acquire a retrograde angular velocity. We\nattribute this effect to the development of preferentially eccentric/radial\norbits in the outer regions of star clusters as they are expanding into their\ntidal limitation.\n  We explore the implications of the evolution of the fraction of prograde and\nretrograde stars for the evolution of the cluster internal rotation, and its\ndependence on the initial structural properties. Although all the systems\nstudied here evolve towards an approximately solid-body internal rotation with\nangular velocity equal to about half of the angular velocity of the cluster\norbital motion around the host galaxy, the evolutionary history of the radial\nprofile of the cluster internal angular velocity depends on the cluster initial\nstructure.\n", "  Charge transport in Rubrene single crystals under uniaxial mechanical strain\nis systematically investigated in the crystal's two in-plane transport\ndirections both under tensile and compressive strain applied parallel or\nperpendicular to the current direction. The density of trap states remains\nunchanged. The field-effect mobility as a benchmark figures for intermolecular\ntransport is found to increase with compressive strain and vice versa with a\nmagnitude of -1.5 cm2/Vs per percent of strain independently of tranport\ndirection. A very remarkable result is the mobility change when the crystal is\nstrained perpendicular to the transport direction. While this enhancement could\nbe quantitatively explained from an improved wave-function overlap, mobility in\nthe perpendicular direction improves even more, contrary to simple geometric\nconsiderations based od later expansion and usual Poisson ratios. This result\nemphasises the central role of the stress induced variations of the dynamics\nwave function overlap in organic molecular crystals.\n", "  We present sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs), based on the\nNNPDF3.0 family, which include the photon PDF from the NNPDF2.3QED sets, and\nleading-order QED contributions to the DGLAP evolution as implemented in the\npublic code APFEL. The aim is to combine our state-of-the-art determination of\nquark and gluon PDFs with the so far only direct determination of the photon\nPDF from LHC data. In addition, the use of APFEL allowed us to employ a\nsolution of the DGLAP equation that, differently from that used for the\nNNPDF2.3QED sets, includes QED corrections in a more accurate way. We briefly\ndiscuss how these sets are constructed and investigate the effect of the\ninclusion of the QED corrections on PDFs and parton luminosities. Finally, we\ncompare the resulting sets, which we dubbed NNPDF3.0QED, to the older\nNNPDF2.3QED sets and to all presently available PDF sets that include QED\ncorrections, namely CT14QED and MRST2004QED.\n", "  We present a full result for the equation of state (EoS) in 2+1+1 (up/down,\nstrange and charm quarks are present) flavour lattice QCD. We extend this\nanalysis and give the equation of state in 2+1+1+1 flavour QCD. In order to\ndescribe the evolution of the universe from temperatures several hundreds of\nGeV to several tens of MeV we also include the known effects of the electroweak\ntheory and give the effective degree of freedoms. As another application of\nlattice QCD we calculate the topological susceptibility (chi) up to the few GeV\ntemperature region. These two results, EoS and chi, can be used to predict the\ndark matter axion's mass in the post-inflation scenario and/or give the\nrelationship between the axion's mass and the universal axionic angle, which\nacts as a initial condition of our universe.\n", "  It is well-known that a Lagrangian induces a compatible presymplectic form on\nthe equation manifold (stationary surface, understood as a submanifold of the\nrespective jet-space). Given an equation manifold and a compatible\npresymplectic form therein, we define the first-order Lagrangian system which\nis formulated in terms of the intrinsic geometry of the equation manifold. It\nhas a structure of a presymplectic AKSZ sigma model for which the equation\nmanifold, equipped with the presymplectic form and the horizontal differential,\nserves as the target space. For a wide class of systems (but not all) we show\nthat if the presymplectic structure originates from a given Lagrangian, the\nproposed first-order Lagrangian is equivalent to the initial one and hence the\nLagrangian per se can be entirely encoded in terms of the intrinsic geometry of\nits stationary surface. If the compatible presymplectic structure is generic,\nthe proposed Lagrangian is only a partial one in the sense that its stationary\nsurface contains the initial equation manifold but does not necessarily\ncoincide with it.\n", "  The point-to-set correlation function has proved to be a very valuable tool\nto probe structural correlations in disordered systems, but more than that, its\ndetailed behavior has been used to try to draw information on the mechanisms\nleading to glassy behavior in supercooled liquids. For this reason it is of\nprimary importance to discern which of those details are peculiar to glassy\nsystems, and which are general features of confinement. Within the present\nresponse we provide an answer to the concerns raised in [J. Chem. Phys. 144,\n227101 (2016)].\n", "  We revisit certain features of an assumed spherically symmetric perfect fluid\ndark matter halo in the light of the observed data of our galaxy\n", "  It is widely believed that quantum gravity effects are negligible in a\nconventional laboratory experiment because quantum gravity should play its role\nonly at a distance of about Planck's length ($\\sim10^{-33}$ cm). Sometimes that\nis not the case as shown in this article. We discuss two new ideas about\nquantum physics connections with gravity. First, the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect\nrelation to quantum gravity is examined. Second, it is shown that the very\nexistence of gravitons is a consequence of quantum statistics. Moreover, since\nthe Bose-Einstein statistics is a special case of Compound Poisson\nDistribution, it predicts the existence of an infinite family of high-spin\nmassless particles.\n", "  The Data Release 1 of the Radial-Velocity Experiment (RAVE DR1, 24 748 stars)\nis compared with the May 15, 2006 version of the Pulkovo Compilation of Radial\nVelocities (PCRV, 35 495 stars). RAVE DR1 includes mostly $9^m-13^m$ stars,\nwhile the PCRV contains brighter stars. Analysis of the \"RAVE minus PCRV\"\nradial-velocity differences for 14 common stars has revealed no systematic\ndependences on any factors, except the effect due to the RAVE radial-velocity\nzero-point offset known from the RAVE observations. This effect shows up for\nten of these stars observed on a single night as a sine wave with an amplitude\nof 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ in the dependence of the radial-velocity difference on the\nordinal number of the optical fiber used and, accordingly, on the star position\nangle in the field of view of the RAVE instrument. The detection of this\ndependence confirms a high radial-velocity accuracy in both catalogs: on\naverage, better than 1 km s$^{-1}$ for stars brighter than $10^m$ (for the\nRAVE, after applying a correction for the zeropoint offset). The RAVE\nzero-point offset can be corrected for with an accuracy better than 1 km\ns$^{-1}$ by observing several PCRV stars in each RAVE frame and by analyzing\nthe \"RAVE minus PCRV\" radialvelocity differences.\n", "  The Pulkovo Compilation of Radial Velocities (PCRV) has been made to study\nthe stellar kinematics in the local spiral arm. The PCRV contains weighted mean\nabsolute radial velocities for 35 495 Hipparcos stars of various spectral types\nand luminosity classes over the entire celestial sphere mainly within 500 pc of\nthe Sun. The median accuracy of the radial velocities obtained is 0.7 km\ns$^{-1}$. Results from 203 publications were used in the catalogue. Four of\nthem were used to improve the radial velocities of standard stars from the IAU\nlist. The radial velocities of 155 standard stars turned out to be constant\nwithin 0.3 km s$^{-1}$. These stars were used to analyze 47 768 mean radial\nvelocities for 37 200 stars from 12 major publications ($\\sim80\\%$ of all the\ndata used). Zero-point discrepancies and systematic dependences on radial\nvelocity, $(B-V)$ color index, right ascension, and declination were found in\nradial velocity differences of the form \"publication minus IAU list of\nstandards\". These discrepancies and dependences were approximated and taken\ninto account when calculating the weighted mean radial velocities. 1128 stars\nwhose independent radial-velocity determinations were available at least in\nthree of these publications and agreed within 3 km s$^{-1}$ were chosen as the\nwork list of secondary standards. Radial-velocity differences of the form\n\"publication minus list of secondary standards\" were used by analogy to correct\nthe zero points and systematic dependences in the radial velocities from 33\nmore publications (~13\\% of the data used). In addition, the radial velocities\nfrom 154 minor publications ($\\sim7\\%$ of the data used) pertaining to\nwell-known instruments were used without any corrections.\n", "  Many heterotic orbifold models have massless twisted-sector particles with\nsimultaneous E8_1 and E8_2 charges. In the strong-coupling M-theory dual of the\nheterotic string this poses a paradox: Since the E8_1 and E8_2 live at opposite\nends of the x^10 dimension, where could a massless particle with both types of\ncharges possible live? To key to this question are the 5D SCFTs living at the\norbifold fixed planes going through the bulk of the M theory. We use\ndimensional deconstruction to understand how such a 5D SCFT (specifically, the\nE_0 SCFT at the Z_3 fixed point) works at the superconformal point (rather that\nat the Coulomb branch) and how it interacts with the boundaries of the x^10. We\nfind that the massless twisted states are not localized in the x^10. Instead,\nthey are non-local meson-like composite particles comprised of a quark living\nat one boundary of the x^10, and antiquark living at the other boundary, and\nthe string of strongly-interacting 5D gluons connecting the quark to the\nantiquark.\n", "  Keeping in view the ordering ambiguity that arises due to the presence of\nposition-dependent effective mass in the kinetic energy term of the\nHamiltonian, a general scheme for obtaining algebraic solutions of quantum\nmechanical systems with position-dependent effective mass is discussed. We\nquantize the Hamiltonian of the pertaining system by using symmetric ordering\nof the operators concerning momentum and the spatially varying mass, initially\nproposed by von Roos and Levy-Leblond. The algebraic method, used to obtain the\nsolutions, is based on the concepts of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and\nshape invariance. In order to exemplify the general formalism a class of\nnon-linear oscillators has been considered. This class includes the particular\nexample of a one-dimensional oscillator with different position-dependent\neffective mass profiles. Explicit expressions for the eigenenergies and\neigenfunctions in terms of generalized Hermite polynomials are presented.\nMoreover, properties of these modified Hermite polynomials, like existence of\ngenerating function and recurrence relations among the polynomials have also\nbeen studied. Furthermore, it has been shown that in the harmonic limit, all\nthe results for the linear harmonic oscillator are recovered.\n", "  Based on a direct combination of the Hipparcos data with astrometric\nground-based observational catalogues having epochs between 1938 and 1999 the\npreliminary orbits and component masses are calculated for 6 binaries with no\nprevious orbit calculation: $\\iota$~Vir (HIP~69701) with period of 55 years,\nphotocentric semi-major axis of 200 mas, relative semi-major axis of 830 mas\nand a dwarf secondary of 0.6 solar masses; $\\gamma$~UMa (HIP~58001) -- 20.5\nyears, 90 mas, 460 mas and a dwarf secondary of 0.8 solar masses; $\\kappa$~Del\n(HIP~101916) -- 45 years, 100 mas, 520 mas and a dwarf secondary of 0.4 solar\nmasses; 20~Oph (HIP~82369) -- 35.5 years, 140 mas, 460 mas and a dwarf\nsecondary of 0.8 solar masses; $\\mu$~Ser (HIP~77516) -- 36 years, 110 mas, 350\nmas and a secondary of 2.3 solar masses; as well as a possible new component of\nMizar~A ($\\zeta$~UMa, HIP~65378) -- 36.5 years, 180 mas, 780 mas, 1.5 solar\nmasses. The latter may be a pair of dwarfs.\n", "  With continuous advances in related technologies, relativistic gravitational\nexperiments with orbiting gradiometers becomes feasible, which could naturally\nbe incorporated into future satellite gravity missions. Tests of Chern-Simons\nmodified gravity are meaningful since such a modification gives us insights\ninto (possible) parity-violations in gravitation. In this work, we derive, at\nthe post-Newtonian level, the new observables of secular gradients from the\nnon-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, which will greatly improve the\nconstraint on the mass scale $M_{CS}$ that may be drawn from satellite\ngradiometry measurements. For superconducting gradiometers, a strong bound\n$M_{CS}\\geq 10^{-7}\\ eV$ could in principle be obtained. For future optical\ngradiometers based on similar technologies from the LISA PathFinder mission, a\neven stronger bound $M_{CS}\\geq 10^{-6}\\sim 10^{-5}\\ eV$ might be expected.\n", "  We study the feasibility and advantages of investigating the $c\\to s$ decay\nchannel of the $B_c$ meson through the cascade decay $B_c\\to B_s\\pi$, $B_s\\to\nD_s\\ell\\nu$. We take into account possible contaminations coming from the\nvector excitations (like $B_s^*$, $D_s^*$ or $\\rho$ in the intermediate stages\nof the cascade) too, as well as the opposite cascade $B_c\\to B_s\\ell\\nu$,\n$B_s\\to D_s\\pi$. We show how the $p_T$ distribution of the pion and the lepton\ncan possibly help to differentiate between various form factor models, for\nwhich we either need more integrated luminosity at the LHC, or a\nhigh-luminosity $e^+e^-$ B factory producing $B_c$ mesons too.\n", "  Nodal superconductivity is observed in LiFeP while its counterpart LiFeAs\nwith similar topology and orbital content of the Fermi surfaces is a nodeless\nsuperconductor. We explain this difference by solving, in the two-Fe Brillouin\nzone, the frequency-dependent Eliashberg equations with spin-fluctuation\nmediated pairing interaction. Because of Fermi surface topology details, in\nLiFeAs all the Fe-$t_{2g}$ orbitals favor a common pairing symmetry. By\ncontrast, in LiFeP the $d_{xy}$ orbital favors a pairing symmetry different\nfrom $d_{xz/yz}$ and their competition determines the pairing symmetry and the\nstrength of the superconducting instability: $d_{xy}$ orbital strongly\novercomes the others and imposes the symmetry of the superconducting order\nparameter. The leading pairing channel is a $d_{xy}$-type state with nodes on\nboth hole and electron Fermi surfaces. As a consequence, the $d_{xz/yz}$\nelectrons weakly pair leading to a reduced transition temperature in LiFeP.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the supercurrent-induced magnetization dynamics\nof a two-dimensional lattice of ferromagnetically ordered spins placed on a\nconventional superconductor with broken spatial inversion symmetry and strong\nspin-orbit coupling. We develop a phenomenological description of the coupled\ndynamics of the superconducting condensate and the spin system, and demonstrate\nthat supercurrents produce a reactive spin-orbit torque on the magnetization.\nBy performing a microscopic self-consistent calculation, we show that the\nspin-orbit torque originates from a spin-polarization of the Cooper pairs due\nto current-induced spin-triplet correlations. Interestingly, we find that there\nexists an intrinsic limitation for the maximum achievable spin-orbit torque,\nwhich is determined by the coupling strength between the condensate and the\nspin system. In proximitized hole-doped semiconductors, the maximum achievable\nspin-orbit torque field is estimated to be on the order of $0.16$ mT, which is\ncomparable to the critical field for current-induced magnetization switching in\nferromagnetic semiconductors.\n", "  In this work we propose a novel approach to solve the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation which combines projection onto the ground state with a path-filtering\ntruncation scheme. The resulting projector configuration interaction (PCI)\napproach realizes a deterministic version of the full configuration interaction\nquantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method [Booth, G. H.; Thom, A. J. W.; Alavi, A. J.\nChem. Phys. 2009, 131, 054106]. To improve upon the linearized imaginary-time\npropagator, we develop an optimal projector scheme based on an exponential\nChebyshev expansion in the limit of an infinite imaginary time step. After\nwriting the exact projector as a path integral in determinant space, we\nintroduce a path filtering procedure that truncates the size of the\ndeterminantal basis and approximates the Hamiltonian. The path filtering\nprocedure is controlled by one real threshold that determines the accuracy of\nthe PCI energy and is not biased towards any determinant. Therefore, the PCI\napproach can equally well describe static and dynamic electron correlation.\nThis point is illustrated in benchmark computation on N$_2$ at both equilibrium\nand stretched geometries. In both cases, the PCI achieves chemical accuracy\nwith wave functions that contain less than 0.5% of the full CI space. We also\nreport computations on the ground state of C$_2$ with up to quaduple-$\\zeta$\nbasis sets and wave functions as large as 200 million determinants, which allow\na direct comparison of the PCI, FCIQMC, and density matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG) methods. The size of the PCI wave function grows modestly with the\nnumber of unoccupied orbitals and its accuracy may be tuned to match that of\nFCIQMC and DMRG.\n", "  Several fundamental results in physics are derived from the simple starting\npoint of two commuting orthogonal unit vectors. The combination of these unit\nvectors leads to spherical harmonics and Schwinger's expression of the\nsecond-quantized angular momentum states in terms of bosonic operators.\nCommuting unit vectors can be turned into anticommuting ones by the restriction\nto a single unit vector. This leads to Pauli spin matrices. By including\nhyperbolic rotations, vectors can be given a finite norm and results from\nspecial relativity and Dirac's equation are found. The assumption that the\nchange in four-momentum is due to the change in four-potential leads to the\nelectromagnetic field tensor and the Lorentz force. Mawell's equations are\nobtained by viewing the four-potential as an harmonic oscillator driven by the\nfour-current. The Schr\\\"odinger equation is obtained from the nonrelativistic\nlimit of the four-momentum.\n", "  Design and scientific investigation are recognized as key components of\nundergraduate physics laboratory curricula. In light of this, many successful\nlab programs have been developed to train students to develop these abilities,\nand students in these programs have been shown to exhibit a higher transfer\nrate of scientific abilities to new situations. In this paper, I use data from\nan electronics class for physics majors to investigate how giving students the\nopportunity to design circuits --- by removing steps from traditional cookbook\nlab guides --- affects the students' ability to determine the function of\ncircuits they haven't seen before. I compared post-lab quiz results from\nstudents who were given explicit procedures to those of students who were given\nincomplete procedures, and I found no statistically significant difference in\nthe results of the two groups. I explore possible explanations for the null\neffect and recommend future research directions.\n", "  For past several decades, research efforts in population modelling has proven\nits efficacy in understanding the basic information about residential and\ncommercial areas, as well as for the purposes of planning, development and\nimprovement of the community as an eco-system. More or less, such efforts\nassume static nature of population distribution, in turn limited by the current\nability to capture the dynamics of population change at a finer resolution of\nspace and time. Fast forward today, more and more people are becoming mobile,\ntraveling across borders impacting the nuts and bolts of our urban fabric.\nUnfortunately, our current efforts are being surpassed by the need to capture\nsuch transient population. It is becoming imperative to identify and define\nthem, as well as measure their dynamics and interconnectedness. In this work,\nwe intend to research urban population mobility patterns, gauge their transient\nnature, and extend our knowledge of their visited locations. We plan to achieve\nthis by designing and developing novel methods and using VGI data that models\nand characterizes transient population dynamics.\n", "  The plasma thermodynamics in the solar upper atmosphere, particularly in the\ncorona, are dominated by the magnetic field, which controls the flow and\ndissipation of energy. The relative lack of knowledge of the coronal vector\nmagnetic field is a major handicap for progress in coronal physics. This makes\nthe development of measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields a high\npriority in solar physics. The Hanle effect in the UV and IR spectral lines is\na largely unexplored diagnostic. We use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\nto study the magnitude of the signal to be expected for typical coronal\nmagnetic fields for selected spectral lines in the UV and IR wavelength ranges,\nnamely the H I Ly-$\\alpha$ and the He I 10830 {\\AA} lines. We show that the\nselected lines are useful for reliable diagnosis of coronal magnetic fields.\nThe results show that the combination of polarization measurements of spectral\nlines with different sensitivities to the Hanle effect may be most appropriate\nfor deducing coronal magnetic properties from future observations.\n", "  Many channel arbitrary pulse sequence generation is required for the\nelectro-optic reconfiguration of optical waveguide networks in Lithium Niobate.\nHere we describe a scalable solution to the requirement for mid-power bipolar\nparallel outputs, based on pulse patterns generated by an externally clocked\nfield programmable gate array (FPGA). Positive and negative pulses can be\ngenerated at repetition rates from up to 80~MHz with pulse width adjustable in\nincrements of 1.6~ns across nine independent outputs. Each channel can provide\n1.5W of RF power and it can be synchronised with the operation of other\ncomponents in an optical network such as light sources and detectors through an\nexternal clock with adjustable delay.\n", "  The first results of Einstein-Maxwell equations established by Raincih in\n1925 are therefore called the Raincih conditions. Later the result was\nrediscovered by Misner and Wheeler in 1957 and made the basis of their\ngeometrodynamics. The present survey will consider didactically the curvature\nof spacetime attributed to an electromagnetic field with conceptual and\ncalculational details.\n", "  In earlier works, D(1) (arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG]), D(11.1) (arXiv:1406.0929\n[math.DG]), D(11.2) (arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]), and D(11.3.1) (arXiv:1508.02347\n[math.DG]), we have explained why a D-brane in string theory, when treated as a\nfundamental dynamical object, can be described by a map $\\varphi$ from an\nAzumaya/matrix manifold $X^{Az}$ (cf. D-brane world-volume) with a fundamental\nmodule with a connection $(E,\\nabla)$ (cf. Chan-Paton bundle) to the target\nspace-time $Y$. In this sequel, we construct a non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld\naction functional $S_{DBI}^{(\\Phi, g, B)}(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ for such pairs\n$(\\varphi,\\nabla)$. We next develop a technical tool needed to study variations\nof this action and apply it to derive the first variation $\\delta\nS_{DBI}^{(\\Phi,g,B)}/\\delta(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ of $S_{DBI}^{(\\Phi,g,B)}$ with\nrespect to $(\\varphi,\\nabla)$. The equations of motion that govern the dynamics\nof D-branes then follow. A complete action for a D-brane world-volume must\ninclude also the Chern-Simons/Wess-Zumino term\n$S_{CS/WZ}^{(C)}(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ that governs how the D-brane world-volume\ncouples with the Ramond-Ramond fields $C$ on $Y$. In the current notes, a\nversion $S^{(C,B)}_{CS/WZ}(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ of non-Abelian\nChern-Simons/Wess-Zumino action functional for $(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ that follows\nthe same guide with which we construct $S^{(\\Phi,g,B)}_{DBI}(\\varphi,\\nabla)$\nis constructed for lower-dimensional D-branes (i.e. D(-1)-, D0-, D1-,\nD2-branes). Its first variation $\\delta\nS^{(C,B)}_{CS/WZ}(\\varphi,\\nabla)/\\delta(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ is derived and its\ncontribution to the equations of motion for $(\\varphi, \\nabla)$ follows. The\ncurrent notes lay down a foundation toward the dynamics of D-branes along the\nline of this D-project.\n", "  Mergers of stellar-mass black holes were recently observed in the\ngravitational wave window opened by LIGO. This puts the spotlight on dense\nstellar systems and their ability to create intermediate-mass black holes\n(IMBHs) through repeated merging. Unfortunately, attempts at direct and\nindirect IMBH detection in star clusters in the nearby universe have proven\ninconclusive as of now. Indirect detection methods attempt to constrain IMBHs\nthrough their effect on star cluster photometric and kinematic observables.\nThey are usually based on looking for a specific, physically motivated\nsignature. While this approach is justified, it may be suboptimal in its usage\nof the available data. Here I present a new indirect detection method, based on\nmachine learning, that is unaffected by these restrictions. I reduce the\nscientific question whether a star cluster hosts an IMBH to a classification\nproblem in the machine learning framework. I present preliminary results to\nillustrate how machine learning models are trained on simulated datasets and\nmeasure their performance on previously unseen, simulated data.\n", "  Due to its time-reversal nature, optical phase conjugation generates a\nmonochromatic light wave which retraces its propagation paths. Here, we\ndemonstrate the regeneration of a subwavelength optical focus by phase\nconjugation. Monochromatic light from a subwavelength source is scattered by\nrandom nanoparticles, and the scattered light is phase conjugated at the\nfar-field region by coupling its wavefront into a single-mode optical reflector\nusing a spatial light modulator. Then the conjugated beam retraces its\npropagation paths and forms a refocus on the source at the subwavelength scale.\nThis is the first direct experimental realization of subwavelength focusing\nbeyond the diffraction limit with far-field time reversal in the optical\ndomain.\n", "  We present simultaneous ground-based radial velocity (RV) measurements and\nspace-based photometric measurements of the young and active K dwarf Epsilon\nEridani. These measurements provide a data set for exploring methods of\nidentifying and ultimately distinguishing stellar photospheric velocities from\nKeplerian motion. We compare three methods we have used in exploring this data\nset: Dalmatian, an MCMC spot modeling code that fits photometric and RV\nmeasurements simultaneously; the FF$'$ method, which uses photometric\nmeasurements to predict the stellar activity signal in simultaneous RV\nmeasurements; and H$\\alpha$ analysis. We show that our H$\\alpha$ measurements\nare strongly correlated with photometry from the Microvariability and\nOscillations of STars (MOST) instrument, which led to a promising new method\nbased solely on the spectroscopic observations. This new method, which we refer\nto as the HH$'$ method, uses H$\\alpha$ measurements as input into the FF$'$\nmodel. While the Dalmatian spot modeling analysis and the FF$'$ method with\nMOST space-based photometry are currently more robust, the HH$'$ method only\nmakes use of one of the thousands of stellar lines in the visible spectrum. By\nleveraging additional spectral activity indicators, we believe the HH$'$ method\nmay prove quite useful in disentangling stellar signals.\n", "  Using density functional theory (DFT) based first principles calculations, we\nshow that the preferred interfacial plane orientation relationship is\ndetermined by the strength of bonding at the interface. The thermodynamic\nstability, and the ideal tensile and shear strengths of Cu/TiN and Al/TiN\ninterfaces are calculated. While there is a strong orientation relation (OR)\npreference for Al/TiN interface, there is no OR preference for Cu/TiN\ninterface. Both the ideal tensile and shear strengths of Cu/TiN interfaces are\nlower than those of bulk Cu and TiN, suggesting such interfaces are weaker than\ntheir bulk components. By comparison, the ideal strengths of Al/TiN interface\nare comparable to the constituents in the bulk form. Such contrasting\ninterfaces can be a test-bed for studying the role of interfaces in determining\nthe mechanical behavior of the nanolayered structures.\n", "  We report the observation of quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nsingle crystal having carrier concentration ($n$)\n$\\sim1.13\\times10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$, three dimensional Fermi surface and bulk\ntransport characteristics. The plateaus in Hall resistivity coincide with\nminima of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations in resistivity. Our results\ndemonstrate that the presence of perfect two dimensional transport is not an\nessential condition for QHE in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. The results of high resolution\nx-ray diffraction (HRXRD), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and\nresidual resistivity measurements show the presence of enhanced crystalline\ndefects and microstrain. We propose that the formation of localized state at\nthe edge of each Landau level due to resonance between the bulk and defect band\nof Bi$_2$Se$_3$ causes the quantum Hall effect.\n", "  In this paper we present a statistical description of the cosmological\nconstant in terms of massless bosons (gravitons). To this purpose, we use our\nrecent results implying a non vanishing temperature ${T_{\\Lambda}}$ for the\ncosmological constant. In particular, we found that a non vanishing\n$T_{\\Lambda}$ allows us to depict the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ as\ncomposed of elementary oscillations of massless bosons of energy $\\hbar\\omega$\nby means of the Bose-Einstein distribution. In this context, as happens for\nphotons in a medium, the effective phase velocity $v_g$ of these massless\nexcitations is not given by the speed of light $c$ but it is suppressed by a\nfactor depending on the number of quanta present in the universe at the\napparent horizon. We found interesting formulas relating the cosmological\nconstant, the number of quanta $N$ and the mean value $\\overline{\\lambda}$ of\nthe wavelength of the gravitons. In this context, we study the possibility to\nlook to the gravitons system so obtained as being very near to be a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Finally, an attempt is done to write down the\nFriedmann flat equations in terms of $N$ and $\\overline{\\lambda}$.\n", "  Time domain radio astronomy observing campaigns frequently generate large\nvolumes of data. Our goal is to develop automated methods that can identify\nevents of interest buried within the larger data stream. The V-FASTR fast\ntransient system was designed to detect rare fast radio bursts (FRBs) within\ndata collected by the Very Long Baseline Array. The resulting event candidates\nconstitute a significant burden in terms of subsequent human reviewing time. We\nhave trained and deployed a machine learning classifier that marks each\ncandidate detection as a pulse from a known pulsar, an artifact due to radio\nfrequency interference, or a potential new discovery. The classifier maintains\nhigh reliability by restricting its predictions to those with at least 90%\nconfidence. We have also implemented several efficiency and usability\nimprovements to the V-FASTR web-based candidate review system. Overall, we\nfound that time spent reviewing decreased and the fraction of interesting\ncandidates increased. The classifier now classifies (and therefore filters)\n80-90% of the candidates, with an accuracy greater than 98%, leaving only the\n10-20% most promising candidates to be reviewed by humans.\n", "  We explore the possibility of modifying the classical Gauss free energy\nfunctional used in capillarity theory by considering surface tension energies\nof nonlocal type. The corresponding variational principles lead to new\nequilibrium conditions which are compared to the mean curvature equation and\nYoung's law found in classical capillarity theory. As a special case of this\nfamily of problems we recover a nonlocal relative isoperimetric problem of\ngeometric interest.\n", "  Cosmic-ray electrons and positrons are a unique probe of the propagation of\ncosmic rays as well as of the nature and distribution of particle sources in\nour Galaxy. Recent measurements of these particles are challenging our basic\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of production, acceleration and propagation of\ncosmic rays. Particularly striking are the differences between the low energy\nresults collected by the space-borne PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments and older\nmeasurements pointing to sign-charge dependence of the solar modulation of\ncosmic-ray spectra. The PAMELA experiment has been measuring the time variation\nof the positron and electron intensity at Earth from July 2006 to December 2015\ncovering the period for the minimum of solar cycle 23 (2006-2009) till the\nmiddle of the maximum of solar cycle 24, through the polarity reversal of the\nheliospheric magnetic field which took place between 2013 and 2014. The\npositron to electron ratio measured in this time period clearly shows a\nsign-charge dependence of the solar modulation introduced by particle drifts.\nThese results provide the first clear and continuous observation of how drift\neffects on solar modulation have unfolded with time from solar minimum to solar\nmaximum and their dependence on the particle rigidity and the cyclic polarity\nof the solar magnetic field.\n", "  The fusion dynamics for a positive Q-value systems: $^{27}$Al+$^{45}$Sc, at\nnear and deep sub-barrier energies has been investigated using the proximity\npotentials of Skyrme energy density formalism in semi classical extended Thomas\nFermi approach for arbitrarily chosen Skyrme forces: SLy4, SIV, SGII and\nProximity77 of Blocki and co-workers. The calculated fusion excitation\nfunctions for the proximity potentials obtained for Skyrme forces mentioned\nabove and for the Proximity77 have been compared with experimental data. The\nproximity potential for Skyrme force SIV is found to be the best and is used in\nthe calculations of the quantities like logarithmic derivative, barriers\ndistributions and $S$-factor. Further, the role of spin-orbit interaction\npotential in the fusion dynamics of this system has been investigated.\n", "  The results of our six year systematic observational survey on candidate\neclipsing binaries with a delta Sct component are briefly presented. A new\ncatalogue for this kind of systems as well as the properties of their delta Sct\nmembers are also presented. The comparison between the components-pulsators and\nthe single delta Sct stars shows that both the evolution and the pulsating\nproperties differ significantly. Finally, we introduce the new era of studying\nstellar pulsations using high accuracy data from Kepler mission and emphasizing\nthe great opportunities that are now opened for a deep knowledge of the\nproperties of stellar pulsations.\n", "  In this paper, we study the symmetries and perform other geometric analyses\nof the wave equation on some spacetimes {with non diagonal metric $g_{ij}$\nwhich are of neutral signatures}. Wave equations on the standard Lorentzian\nmanifolds have been done but not on the manifolds from metrics of neutral\nsignatures.\n", "  This is our first study of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the\ninner edge of an astrophysical disk around a central back hole. We derive the\nequations governing small-amplitude oscillations in general relativistic ideal\nmagnetodydrodynamics and obtain a criterion for the onset of the instability.\nWe suggest that static disk configurations where magnetic field is held by the\ndisk material are unstable around a Schwarzschild black hole. On the other\nhand, we find that such configurations are stabilized by the spacetime rotation\naround a Kerr black hole. We obtain a crude estimate of the maximum amount of\npoloidal magnetic flux that can be accumulated around the center, and suggest\nthat it is proportional to the black hole spin. Finally, we discuss the\nastrophysical implications of our result for the theoretical and observational\nestimations of the black hole jet power.\n", "  The exclusive deep inelastic electroproduction of $\\psi(2S)$ and $J/\\psi(1S)$\nat an $ep$ centre-of-mass energy of 317 GeV has been studied with the ZEUS\ndetector at HERA in the kinematic range $2 < Q^2 < 80$ GeV$^2$, $30 < W < 210$\nGeV and $|t| < 1$ GeV$^2$, where $Q^2$ is the photon virtuality, $W$ is the\nphoton-proton centre-of-mass energy and $t$ is the squared four-momentum\ntransfer at the proton vertex. The data for $2 < Q^2 < 5$ GeV$^2$ were taken in\nthe HERA I running period and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 114\npb$^{-1}$. The data for $5 < Q^2 < 80$ GeV$^2$ are from both HERA I and HERA II\nperiods and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 468 pb$^{-1}$. The decay\nmodes analysed were $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $J/\\psi(1S) \\pi^+\\pi^-$ for the $\\psi(2S)$\nand $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ for the $J/\\psi(1S)$. The cross-section ratio\n$\\sigma_{\\psi(2S)}/\\sigma_{J/\\psi(1S)}$ has been measured as a function of\n$Q^2, W$ and $t$. The results are compared to predictions of QCD-inspired\nmodels of exclusive vector-meson production.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be an exquisite new near-infrared\nobservatory with imaging and multi-object spectroscopy through ESA's NIRspec\ninstrument with its unique Micro-Shutter Array (MSA), allowing for slits to be\npositioned on astronomical targets by opening specific 0.002\"-wide micro\nshutter doors.\n  To ensure proper target acquisition, the on-sky position of the MSA needs to\nbe verified before spectroscopic observations start. An onboard centroiding\nprogram registers the position of pre-identified guide stars in a Target\nAcquisition (TA) image, a short pre-spectroscopy exposure without dispersion\n(image mode) through the MSA with all shutters open.\n  The outstanding issue is the availability of Galactic stars in the right\nluminosity range for TA relative to typical high redshift targets. We explore\nthis here using the stars and $z\\sim8$ candidate galaxies identified in the\nsource extractor catalogs of Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey\n(BoRG[z8]), a pure-parallel program with Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field\nCamera 3.\n  We find that (a) a single WFC3 field contains enough Galactic stars to\nsatisfy the NIRspec astrometry requirement (20 milli-arcseconds), provided its\nand the NIRspec TA's are $m_{lim}>24.5$ AB in WFC3 F125W, (b) a single WFC3\nimage can therefore serve as the pre-image if need be, (c) a WFC3 mosaic and\naccompanying TA image satisfy the astrometry requirement at $\\sim23$ AB mag in\nWFC3 F125W, (d) no specific Galactic latitude requires deeper TA imaging due to\na lack of Galactic stars, and (e) a depth of $\\sim24$ AB mag in WFC3 F125W is\nneeded if a guide star in the same MSA quadrant as a target is required.\n  We take the example of a BoRG identified $z\\sim8$ candidate galaxy and\nrequire a Galactic star within 20\" of it. In this case, a depth of 25.5 AB in\nF125W is required (with $\\sim$97% confidence).\n", "  The first part of these notes is a self-contained introduction to generalized\ncomplex geometry. It is intended as a `user manual' for tools used in the study\nof supersymmetric backgrounds of supergravity. In the second part we review\nsome past and recent results on the generalized complex structure of\nsupersymmetric type II vacua in various dimensions.\n", "  A new method is introduced for doing calculations of quantum field theories\nin planar geometries which the metric depends on just one coordinate. In\ncontrast to previous method, this method can be used in any planar geometry,\nnot only weakly curved asymptotically flat ones.\n", "  The Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) on board the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites\n(NOAA POES) is known to degrade with time. In recent years a lot of effort has\nbeen put into calibrating the degraded proton detectors. We make use of\nprevious work and show that the degradation of the detectors can be attributed\nto the radiation dose of each individual instrument. However, the effectiveness\nof the radiation in degrading the detector is modulated when it is weighted by\nthe mean $\\textit{ap}$ index, increasing the degradation rate in periods with\nhigh geomagnetic activity, and decreasing it through periods of low activity.\nWhen taking $\\textit{ap}$ and the radiation dose into account, we find that the\ndegradation rate is independent of spacecraft and detector pointing direction.\nWe have developed a model to estimate the correction factor for all the MEPED\ndetectors as a function of accumulated corrected flux and the $\\textit{ap}$\nindex. We apply the routine to NOAA POES spacecraft starting with NOAA-15,\nincluding the European satellites MetOp-02 and MetOp-01, and estimate\ncorrection factors.\n", "  Here we present an event where simultaneous global imaging of the aurora from\nboth hemispheres reveals a large longitudinal shift of the nightside aurora of\nabout 3 h, being the largest relative shift reported on from conjugate auroral\nimaging. This is interpreted as evidence of closed field lines having very\nasymmetric footpoints associated with the persistent positive $\\textit{y}$\ncomponent of the interplanetary magnetic field before and during the event. At\nthe same time, the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network observes the ionospheric\nnightside convection throat region in both hemispheres. The radar data indicate\nfaster convection toward the dayside in the dusk cell in the Southern\nHemisphere compared to its conjugate region. We interpret this as a signature\nof a process acting to restore symmetry of the displaced closed magnetic field\nlines resulting in flux tubes moving faster along the banana cell than the\nconjugate orange cell. The event is analyzed with emphasis on Birkeland\ncurrents (BC) associated with this restoring process, as recently described by\nTenfjord et al. (2015). Using data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary\nElectrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) during the same conditions as the\npresented event, the large-scale BC pattern associated with the event is\npresented. It shows the expected influence of the process of restoring symmetry\non BCs. We therefore suggest that these observations should be recognized as\nbeing a result of the dynamic effects of restoring footpoint symmetry on closed\nfield lines in the nightside.\n", "  Atomically flat interfaces between ternary oxides have chemically different\nvariants, depending on the terminating lattice planes of both oxides.\nElectronic properties change with the interface termination which affects, for\ninstance, charge accumulation and magnetic interactions at the interface.\nWell-defined terminations have yet rarely been achieved for oxides of ABO3 type\n(with metals A, B). Here, we report on a strategy of thin film growth and\ninterface characterization applied to fabricate the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-SrRuO3\ninterface with controlled termination. Ultra-strong antiferromagnetic coupling\nbetween the ferromagnets occurs at the MnO2-SrO interface, but not for the\nother termination, in agreement with density functional calculations. X-ray\nmagnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal coupled reversal of Mn and Ru\nmagnetic moments at the MnO2-SrO interface. Our results demonstrate termination\ncontrol of magnetic coupling across a complex oxide interface and provide a\npathway for theoretical and experimental explorations of novel electronic\ninterface states with engineered magnetic properties.\n", "  Power-law exponents in the convergence to effective ergodicity is quantified\nfor Ising-Lenz model in one dimension. Modified Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) metric\nfor magnetisation is computed for the range of temperature values under\nstrongly correlated dynamics. In producing evolution of TM metric over time,\ntime-averaged dynamics is generated by using Metropolis and Glauber\nsingle-spin-flip dynamics, and ensemble-averaged dynamics with an exact\nsolution. Superdiffusive behaviour is numerically identified in the parameter\nregimes studied, i.e., power-law exponents, $\\alpha > 1.0$.\n", "  The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a new powerful\nradio-telescope, dedicated to the study of the early universe. Its main goal is\nto characterise the period of the universe where the first galaxies and stars\nstarted to form, by studying the evolution of the 21-cm emission signal from\nneutral hydrogen, during the Epoch of Reionization. In this article, we present\nan electromagnetic and electrical co-simulation of the antenna performed with\nCST. We focus our analysis on the characterisation of the chromatic effects\ncaused by the antenna, in particular multiple reflections of the received\nsignal between the feed and the dish. These reflections can have an important\nimpact on the scientific results, and it is crucial to keep them as low as\npossible. Therefore, we are currently developing a matching circuit which aims\nto improve the impedance matching between the feed and the front end.\n", "  The nanophysics is halfway between the size scales of quantum mechanics and\nmacroscopic physics governed by the laws of Newton and Einstein. The correct\ndefinition of nanophysics is the physics of structures and artefacts with\ndimensions in the nanometer range or of phenomena occurring in nanoseconds.\nModern physical methods whose fundamental are developed in physics laboratories\nhave become critically important in nanoscience. Nanophysics brings together\nmultiple disciplines, using theoretical and experimental methods to determine\nthe physical properties of materials in the nanoscale size range. Interesting\nproperties include the structural, electronic, optical, and thermal behavior of\nnanomaterials, electrical and thermal conductivity, the forces between\nnanoscale objects, and the transition between classical and quantum behavior.\nNanophysics has now become an independent branch of physics, simultaneously\nexpanding into many new areas and playing a vital role in fields that were once\nthe domain of engineering, chemical, or life sciences. Nanoscience and\nnanotechnology are all about relating and exploiting phenomena for materials\nhaving one, two or three dimensions reduced to the nanoscale. Breakthroughs in\nnanotechnology require a firm grounding in the principles of nanophysics. It is\nintended to fulfill a crucial purpose. Nanophysics aims to connect scientists\nwith disparate interests to begin interdisciplinary projects and incorporate\nthe theory and methodology of other fields into their work.\n", "  The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is intimately related\nto the prospect of superior domain-wall dynamics and the formation of magnetic\nskyrmions. Although some experimental efforts have been recently proposed to\nquantify these interactions and the underlying physics, it is still far from\ntrivial to address the interfacial DMI. Inspired by the reported tilt of the\nmagnetization of the side edge of a thin film structure, we here present a\nquasi-static, straightforward measurement tool. By using laterally asymmetric\ntriangular-shaped microstructures, it is demonstrated that interfacial DMI\ncombined with an in-plane magnetic field yields a unique and significant shift\nin magnetic hysteresis. By systematic variation of the shape of the triangular\nobjects combined with a droplet model for domain nucleation, a robust value for\nthe strength and sign of interfacial DMI is obtained. This method gives\nimmediate and quantitative access to DMI, enabling a much faster exploration of\nnew DMI systems for future nanotechnology.\n", "  Response to William A. Wilson on the limits and fallibility of science.\n", "  We model a Brownian heat engine as a Brownian particle that hops in a\nperiodic ratchet potential where the ratchet potential is coupled with a\nlinearly decreasing background temperature. It is shown that the efficiency of\nsuch Brownian heat engine is far from Carnot efficiency even at quaistatic\nlimit. At quasistatic limit, the efficiency of the heat engine approaches the\nefficiency of endoreversible engine $\\eta=1-\\sqrt{{T_{c}/T_{h}}}$ \\cite{c18}.\nOn the other hand, the maximum power efficiency of the engine approaches\n$\\eta^{MAX}=1-({T_{c}/T_{h}})^{1\\over 4}$. Moreover, the dependence of the\ncurrent as well as the efficiency on the model parameters is explored\nanalytically by omitting the heat exchange via the kinetic energy. In this case\nwe show that the optimized efficiency always lies between the efficiently at\nquaistatic limit and the efficiency at maximum power. On the other hand, the\nefficiency at maximum power is always less than the optimized efficiency since\nthe fast motion of the particle comes at the expense of the energy cost. The\nrole of time on the performance of the motor is also explored via numerical\nsimulations. Our numerical results depict that the time $t$ as well as the\nexternal load dictate the direction of the particle velocity. Moreover the\nperformance of the heat engine improves with time. At large $t$ (steady\nstate),the velocity, the efficiency and the coefficient of performance of the\nrefrigerator attain their maximum value.\n", "  Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that take place in the envelopes\nof accreting white dwarfs in binary systems. The material piles up under\ndegenerate conditions, driving a thermonuclear runaway. The energy released by\nthe suite of nuclear processes operating at the envelope heats the material up\nto peak temperatures about 100 - 400 MK. During these events, about 10-3 - 10-7\nMsun, enriched in CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g.,\nNe, Na, Mg, Al) are ejected into the interstellar medium. To account for the\ngross observational properties of classical novae (in particular, the large\nconcentrations of metals spectroscopically inferred in the ejecta), models\nrequire mixing between the (solar-like) material transferred from the secondary\nand the outermost layers (CO- or ONe-rich) of the underlying white dwarf.\nRecent multidimensional simulations have demonstrated that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities can naturally produce self-enrichment of the accreted envelope\nwith material from the underlying white dwarf at levels that agree with\nobservations. However, the feasibility of this mechanism has been explored in\nthe framework of CO white dwarfs, while mixing with different substrates still\nneeds to be properly addressed. Three-dimensional simulations of mixing at the\ncore-envelope interface during nova outbursts have been performed with the\nmultidimensional code FLASH, for two types of substrates: CO- and ONe-rich. We\nshow that the presence of an ONe-rich substrate, as in \"neon novae\", yields\nlarger metallicity enhancements in the ejecta, compared to CO,rich substrates\n(i.e., non-neon novae). A number of requirements and constraints for such 3-D\nsimulations (e.g., minimum resolution, size of the computational domain) are\nalso outlined.\n", "  In this paper we have carried out numerical simulation and experimental\ncharacterization of two variants of SR (Spiral resonator) viz. TTSR (Two-Turn\nSpiral Resonator) and NBSR (Non Bianisotropic spiral resonator). The numerical\nsimulation of these develop magnetic inclusion structures are done with\ncommercially available Finite Element Method (FEM) based Ansys HFSS-13\nsimulation software, and transmission experiment using S-parameter retrieval\ntechnique. The experimental characterization of those fabricated structures is\nused in the parallel plate waveguide experiment (not reported earlier) and then\nvalidate our experimental results with the Ansys HFSS-13 simulation software;\nwhich in not available in any published literature.\n", "  The Vortex Filament Equation (VFE) is part of an integrable hierarchy of\nfilament equations. Several equations part of this hierarchy have been derived\nto describe vortex filaments in various situations. Inspired by these results,\nwe develop a general framework for studying the existence and the linear\nstability of closed solutions of the VFE hierarchy. The framework is based on\nthe correspondence between the VFE and the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS)\nhierarchies. Our results show that it is possible to establish a connection\nbetween the AKNS Floquet spectrum and the stability properties of the solutions\nof the filament equations. We apply our machinery to solutions of the filament\nequation associated to the Hirota equation. We also discuss how our framework\napplies to soliton solutions.\n", "  Optically active artificial structures have attracted tremendous research\nattention. Such structures must meet two requirements: Lack of spatial\ninversion symmetries and, a condition usually not explicitly considered, the\nstructure shall preserve the helicity of light, which implies that there must\nbe a vanishing coupling between the states of opposite polarization handedness\namong incident and scattered plane waves. Here, we put forward and demonstrate\nthat a unit cell made from chiraly arranged electromagnetically dual scatterers\nserves exactly this purpose. We prove this by demonstrating optical activity of\nsuch unit cell in general scattering directions.\n", "  We realize constant-space quantum computation by measure-many two-way quantum\nfinite automata and evaluate their language recognition power by analyzing\npatterns of their exotic behaviors and by exploring their structural\nproperties. In particular, we show that, when the automata halt \"in finite\nsteps\" along all computation paths, they must terminate in worst-case liner\ntime. In the bounded-error probability case, the acceptance of the automata\ndepends only on the computation paths that terminate within exponentially many\nsteps even if not all computation paths may terminate. We also present a\nclassical simulation of those automata on two-way multi-head probabilistic\nfinite automata with cut points. Moreover, we discuss how the recognition power\nof the automata varies as the automata's acceptance criteria change to error\nfree, one-sided error, bounded error, and unbounded error by comparing the\ncomplexity of their computational powers. We further note that, with the use of\narbitrary complex transition amplitudes, two-way unbounded-error quantum finite\nautomata and two-way bounded-error 2-head quantum finite automata can recognize\ncertain non-recursive languages, whereas two-way error-free quantum finite\nautomata recognize only recursive languages.\n", "  The recent update of the strangeness $-2$ ESC08c Nijmegen potential\nincorporating the NAGARA and KISO events predicts a $\\Xi N$ bound state, $D^*$,\nin the $^3S_1 (I=1)$ channel. We study if the existence of this two-body bound\nstate could give rise to stable three-body systems. For this purpose we solve\nthe bound state problem of three-body systems where the $\\Xi N$ state is merged\nwith $N$'s, $\\Lambda$'s, $\\Sigma's$ or $\\Xi$'s, making use of the most recent\nupdates of the two-body ESC08c Nijmegen potentials. We found that there appear\nstable states in the $\\Xi NN$ and $\\Xi \\Xi N$ systems, the $\\Xi \\Lambda N$ and\n$\\Xi \\Sigma N$ systems being unbound.\n", "  We review an approach developed in the last few years by our group in which\nGR is modified in the infrared, at an effective level, by nonlocal terms\nassociated to a mass scale. We begin by recalling the notion of quantum\neffective action and its associated nonlocalities, illustrating some of their\nfeatures with the anomaly-induced effective actions in $D=2$ and $D=4$. We\nexamine conceptual issues of nonlocal theories such as causality, degrees of\nfreedoms and ghosts, stressing the importance of the fact that these\nnonlocalities only emerge at the effective level. We discuss a particular class\nof nonlocal theories where the nonlocal operator is associated to a mass scale,\nand we show that they perform very well in the comparison with cosmological\nobservations, to the extent that they fit CMB, supernovae, BAO and structure\nformation data at a level fully competitive with $\\Lambda$CDM, with the same\nnumber of free parameters. We explore some extensions of these `minimal'\nmodels, and we finally discuss some directions of investigation for deriving\nthe required effective nonlocality from a fundamental local QFT.\n", "  Duderstadt et al. [2016b] comment that the Melott et al. [2016] study of\nnitrate formation by solar proton events (SPEs) and comparison with the ice\ncore archive is \"fundamentally flawed,\" because it does not include\npre-existing HNO3 in the stratosphere. We show that they exaggerate both the\nenhancement predicted by our findings and pre-industrial HNO3 levels in their\nmodel, and fail to prove this assertion. Our feasibility study matched expected\nSPE nitrate production with ground truth measurements. It is not clear that\ntheir approach is more realistic and absence of a detailed mechanism does not\ndisprove our results. Models can be no better than the information they are\nprovided and in this case there continue to be significant unknowns and\nuncertainties, especially in the role of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and\npossible interactions with cosmic rays that constitute lower boundary\nconditions. Duderstadt et al. [2014; 2016a] used incomplete, poorly-constrained\nand incorrect initial and boundary conditions, and they continue to advocate on\nthe basis of uncertain results. Meanwhile, Smart et al. [2014] identified a\nseries of ice core nitrate spikes that have since been confirmed in 10Be by\nMcCracken and Beer [2015]. Melott et al. [2016] computationally reproduced the\nionization profile of the only major balloon measurements to date. We show that\nour calculated nitrate enhancement is consistent with measured results, given\ncurrent levels of uncertainty, and that extreme SPEs can potentially produce\noccasional nitrate spikes with hundreds of percent increases. Instead of\nrepeating old arguments to dismiss nitrates as proxies of SPEs, it is past time\nfor a dedicated, fine-resolution, multi-parameter, replicate ice core field\ncampaign to resolve this debate.\n", "  The transfer of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using\namorphous polymers represents a widely implemented method for graphene-based\nelectronic device fabrication. However, the most commonly used polymer,\npoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), leaves a residue on the graphene that limits\nthe mobility. Here we report a method for graphene transfer and patterning that\nemploys a perfluoropolymer---Hyflon---as a transfer handle and to protect\ngraphene against contamination from photoresists or other polymers. CVD-grown\ngraphene transferred this way onto LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures is\natomically clean, with high mobility (~30,000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) near the\nDirac point at 2 K and clear, quantized Hall and magneto-resistance. Local\ncontrol of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfacial metal-insulator\ntransition---through the graphene---is preserved with this transfer method. The\nuse of perfluoropolymers such as Hyflon with CVD-grown graphene and other 2D\nmaterials can readily be implemented with other polymers or photoresists.\n", "  Different approaches have improved the sensitivity of either electron or\nnuclear magnetic resonance to the single spin level. For optical detection it\nhas essentially become routine to observe a single electron spin or nuclear\nspin. Typically, the systems in use are carefully designed to allow for single\nspin detection and manipulation, and of those systems, diamond spin defects\nrank very high, being so robust that they can be addressed, read out and\ncoherently controlled even under ambient conditions and in a versatile set of\nnanostructures. This renders them as a new type of sensor, which has been shown\nto detect single electron and nuclear spins among other quantities like force,\npressure and temperature. Adapting pulse sequences from classic NMR and EPR,\nand combined with high resolution optical microscopy, proximity to the target\nsample and nanoscale size, the diamond sensors have the potential to constitute\na new class of magnetic resonance detectors with single spin sensitivity. As\ndiamond sensors can be operated under ambient conditions, they offer potential\napplication across a multitude of disciplines. Here we review the different\nexisting techniques for magnetic resonance, with a focus on diamond defect spin\nsensors, showing their potential as versatile sensors for ultra-sensitive\nmagnetic resonance with nanoscale spatial resolution.\n", "  We present a novel application of optical tunneling in the context of\nhigh-angular resolution, high-contrast techniques with the aim of improving\ndirect imaging capabilities of faint companions in the vicinity of bright\nstars. In contrast to existing techniques like coronagraphy, we apply\nwell-established techniques from integrated optics to exclusively extinct a\nvery narrow angular direction coming from the sky. This extinction is achieved\nin the pupil plane and does not suffer from diffraction pattern residuals. We\ngive a comprehensive presentation of the underlying theory as well as first\nlaboratory results.\n", "  We present Intercut, a Python-based program that applies secondary line\nidentification and photometric cuts to mock galaxy surveys, in order to\nsimulate interloper identification. This program can be used to optimize the\nremoval of interloper contamination in upcoming surveys. Intercut reads a mock\ngalaxy survey and an emission line sensitivity and simulates interloper removal\nthrough secondary line identification and broad-band photometry. This program\nis designed to use the COSMOS mock catalog, although the program can be\nmodified for an alternative mock catalog. The output of the program returns an\ninterloper fraction for each emission line, as well as the total fraction over\nall lines, as a function of redshift. We test Intercut by predicting interloper\nrates for the WFIRST emission line sensitivity, finding agreement with previous\nwork. This program is publically available on Github\n", "  A study of the production of Mueller-Navelet jets at 13 TeV LHC is presented,\nincluding BFKL resummation effects and investigating three different variants\nof the BLM scale optimization method. It is shown how the cross section and the\nazimuthal observables are affected by the exclusion of the events where, for a\ngiven rapidity interval between the two jets, one of these is produced in the\ncentral region.\n", "  Morphological change of bilayer membrane in vivo is not a spontaneous\nprocedure but modulated by various types of proteins in general. Most of these\nmodulations are associated with the localization of related proteins in the\ncrowded lipid environment in bilayer membrane. This work presents an\nmathematical model for the localization of multiple species of diffusion\nmolecules on membrane surfaces. We start with the energetic description of the\ndistributions of molecules on curved membrane surface, by assembling the\nbending energy of bilayer membrane and the entropic energy of diffusive\nmolecules. We introduce the spontaneous curvature of molecules in membrane, and\ndefine the spontaneous curvature of bilayer membrane as a function of the\nmolecule concentrations on membrane surfaces. This connection gives rise to a\ndrift-diffusion equation to govern the gradient flows of the surface molecule\nconcentrations. We recast the energetic formulation and the related governing\nequations in the Eulerian framework by using a phase field function that\ndefines the membrane morphology. Computational simulations with the proposed\nmathematical model and related numerical techniques predict the molecular\nlocalization on membrane surfaces at locations with preferred mean curvature.\n", "  We have calculated the coefficient functions for the structure functions F_2,\nF_L and F_3 in nu-nubar charged-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at the\nthird order in the strong coupling alpha_s, thus completing the description of\nunpolarized inclusive W^(+-) exchange DIS to this order of massless\nperturbative QCD. In this brief note, our new results are presented in terms of\ncompact approximate expressions that are sufficiently accurate for\nphenomenological analyses. For the benefit of such analyses we also collect, in\na unified notation, the corresponding lower-order contributions and the flavour\nnon-singlet coefficient functions for nu+nubar charged-current DIS. The\nbehaviour of all six third-order coefficient functions at small Bjorken-x is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  These notes cover in some detail lectures I gave at the Les Houches Summer\nSchool 2012. I describe here work done with Deepak Iyer with important\ncontributions from Hujie Guan. I discuss some aspects of the physics revealed\nby quantum quenches and present a formalism for studying the quench dynamics of\nintegrable systems. The formalism presented generalizes an approach by Yudson\nand is applied to Lieb-Liniger model which describes a gas of $N$ interacting\nbosons moving on the continuous infinite line while interacting via a short\nrange potential. We carry out the quench from several initial states and for\nany number of particles and compute the evolution of the density and the noise\ncorrelations. In the long time limit the system dilutes and we find that for\nany value of repulsive coupling independently of the initial state the system\nasymptotes towards astrongly repulsive gas, while for any value of attractive\ncoupling, the system forms a maximal bound state that dominates at longer\ntimes. In either case the system equilibrates but does not thermalize, an\neffect that is consistent with prethermalization. These results can be\nconfronted with experiments. For much more detail see: Phys. Rev. A 87, 053628\n(2013) on which these notes are based. Further applications of the approach to\nthe Heisenberg model and to the Anderson model will be presented elsewhere.\n", "  We explore a two-step optimization problem in random environments, the\nso-called restaurant-coffee shop problem, where a walker aims at visiting the\nnearest and better restaurant in an area and then move to the nearest and\nbetter coffee-shop. This is an extension of the Tourist Problem, a one-step\noptimization dynamics that can be viewed as a deterministic walk in a random\nmedium. A certain amount of heterogeneity in the values of the resources to be\nvisited causes the emergence of power-laws distributions for the steps\nperformed by the walker, similarly to a L\\'{e}vy flight. The fluctuations of\nthe step lengths tend to decrease as a consequence of multiple-step planning,\nthus reducing the foraging uncertainty. We find that the first and second steps\nof each planned movement play very different roles in heterogeneous\nenvironments. The two-step process improves only slightly the foraging\nefficiency compared to the one-step optimization, at a much higher\ncomputational cost. We discuss the implications of these findings for animal\nand human mobility, in particular in relation to the computational effort that\ninformed agents should deploy to solve search problems.\n", "  Recently in Online Social Networks (OSNs), the Least Cost Influence (LCI)\nproblem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a\nminimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information\npropagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only\nbased on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs\nsuch that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously.\nTherefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to\nconsider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances.\n  In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the\ninfluence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI\nproblem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy\ncoupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of\noriginal networks to achieve high quality solutions, while the lossy coupling\nscheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory\nconsumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real\nand synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling\nschemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of\ninfluence propagation in multiplex networks.\n", "  We propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators\nseparated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical\nparametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly with the\nassistance of Coulomb interaction. We show that the Coulomb interaction between\nthe oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement. Due\nto the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump\ndriving the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the\nsqueezing cavity field, the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity\nfield and the oscillator is modulated accordingly. We find that there is\ncompeting effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the Coulomb\ninteraction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on\nsimultaneously. Therefore, the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with\nthe assistance of Coulomb interaction. The results of numerical simulation show\nthat the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of\nenvironment compared with previous schemes in experimentally feasible regimes.\n", "  We study the fate of dynamical localization of two quantum kicked rotors with\ncontact interaction. This interaction mimics experimental realizations with\nultracold atomic gases. Dynamical localization for a single rotor takes place\nin momentum space. The contact interaction affects the evolution of the\nrelative momentum $k$ of a pair of interacting rotors in a non-analytic way.\nConsequently the evolution operator $U$ is exciting large relative momenta with\namplitudes which decay only as a power law $1/k^4$. This is in contrast to the\ncenter-of-mass momentum $K$ for which the amplitudes excited by $U$ decay\nsuperexponentially fast. Therefore dynamical localization is preserved for the\ncenter-of-mass momentum, but destroyed for the relative momentum for any\nnonzero strength of interaction.\n", "  The behaviour of a space-modulated, so-called \"argumental\" oscillator is\nstudied, which is represented by a model having an even-parity space-modulating\nfunction. Analytic expressions of a stability criterion and of discrete energy\nlevels are given. Using an integrating factor and a Van der Pol representation\nin the (amplitude, phase) space, an approximate implicit closed-form of the\nsolution is given. The probability to enter a stable-oscillation regime from\ngiven initial conditions is calculated in symbolic form. These results allow an\nanalytic approach to stability and bifurcations of the system. They also allow\nan assessment of the risk of occurrence of sustained large-amplitude\noscillations, when the phenomenon is to be avoided, and an assessment of the\nconditions to apply to obtain oscillations whenever the phenomenon is desired.\n", "  An updated analysis regarding the expected nuclear PDF constraints from the\nfuture Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) experiment is presented. The new\nstudy is based on a more flexible small-$x$ parametrization which provides less\nbiased uncertainty estimates in the region where there are currently no data\nconstraints. The effect of the LHeC is quantified by directly including a\nsample of pseudodata according to the expected precision of this planned\nexperiment. As a result, a significant reduction of the small-$x$ uncertainties\nin sea quarks and gluons is observed.\n", "  Hollow Gaussian beams (HGB) are a special class of doughnut shaped beams that\ndo not carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). Such beams have a wide range of\napplications in many fields including atomic optics, bio-photonics, atmospheric\nscience, and plasma physics. Till date, these beams have been generated using\nlinear optical elements. Here, we show a new way of generating HGBs by\nthree-wave mixing in a nonlinear crystal. Based on nonlinear interaction of\nphotons having OAM and conservation of OAM in nonlinear processes, we\nexperimentally generated ultrafast HGBs of order as high as 6 and power >180 mW\nat 355 nm. This generic concept can be extended to any wavelength, timescales\n(continuous-wave and ultrafast) and any orders. We show that the removal of\nazimuthal phase of vortices does not produce Gaussian beam. We also propose a\nnew and only method to characterize the order of the HGBs.\n", "  How a nano-searcher finds its nano-target is a general problem in\nnon-equilibrium statistical physics. It becomes vital when the searcher is a\ndamaged DNA fragment trying to find its counterpart on the intact homologous\nchromosome. If the two copies are paired, that intact homologous sequence\nserves as a template to reconstitute the damaged DNA sequence, enabling the\ncell to survive without genetic mutations. To succeed, the search must stop\nonly when the perfect homology is found. The biological process that ensures\nsuch a genomic integrity is called Homologous Recombination and is promoted by\nthe Recombinase proteins. In this article, we use torque-sensitive magnetic\ntweezers to measure the free-energy landscape of the human Recombinase hRad51\nprotein assembled a DNA fragment. Based on our measurements we model the\nhRad51/DNA complex as an out-of-equilibrium two-state system and provide a\nthermodynamical description of Homologous Recombination. With this dynamical\ntwo-state model, we suggest a mechanism by which the recombinase proteins\ndiscriminate between homologous and a non-homologous sequences.\n", "  The size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) equation is an efficient implicit\nsolvation model which also captures electrolytic solvent effects. It combines\nan account of the dielectric solvent response with a mean-field description of\nsolvated finite-sized ions. We present a general solution scheme for the MPB\nequation based on a fast function-space oriented Newton method and a Green's\nfunction preconditioned iterative linear solver. In contrast to popular\nmulti-grid solvers this approach allows to fully exploit specialized\nintegration grids and optimized integration schemes. We describe a\ncorresponding numerically efficient implementation for the full-potential\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) code FHI-aims. We show that together with an\nadditional Stern layer correction the DFT+MPB approach can describe the mean\nactivity coefficient of a KCl aqueous solution over a wide range of\nconcentrations. The high sensitivity of the calculated activity coefficient on\nthe employed ionic parameters thereby suggests to use extensively tabulated\nexperimental activity coefficients of salt solutions for a systematic\nparametrization protocol.\n", "  The n-vicinities method for approximate calculations of the partition\nfunction of a spin system was proposed previously. The equation of state was\nobtained in the most general form. In the present publication these results are\nadapted to the Ising model on the D-dimensional cubic lattice. The state\nequation is solved for an arbitrary dimension D and the behavior of the free\nenergy is analyzed. For large values of D (D > 2) the obtained results are in\ngood agreement with the ones obtained by means of computer simulations. For\nsmall values of D (D < 3), there are noticeable discrepancies with the exact\nresults.\n", "  We discuss diphoton semi(exclusive) production in ultraperipheral $PbPb$\ncollisions at energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 5.5 TeV (LHC). The nuclear\ncalculations are based on equivalent photon approximation in the impact\nparameter space. The cross sections for elementary $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including two different mechanisms: box\ndiagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops and a VDM-Regge contribution with\nvirtual intermediate hadronic excitations of the photons. We got relatively\nhigh cross sections in $PbPb$ collisions ($306$ nb). This opens a possibility\nto study the $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ (quasi)elastic scattering at the\nLHC. We find that the cross section for elastic $\\gamma\\gamma$ scattering could\nbe measured in the lead-lead collisions for the diphoton invariant mass\n$W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx 15-20$ GeV.\n", "  We report on our studies of the neutron-skin effects in high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\nobservables at the LHC. We study the impact of the neutron-skin effect on the\ncentrality dependence of inclusive direct photon, high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadron\nand $W^{\\pm}$ production in nuclear collisions at the LHC. The neutron-skin\neffect refers to the observation that in spherical heavy nuclei, the tail of\nthe neutron distribution extends farther than the distribution of protons,\nwhich can affect observables sensitive to electroweak phenomena in very\nperipheral collisions. We quantify this effect for direct photons, charged\nhadrons and W bosons as a function of the collision centrality. In the case of\ndirect photons we find that it will be difficult to resolve the neutron-skin\neffect, given the uncertainties in the nuclear PDFs and their spatial\ndependence. With charged hadrons and W's, however, up to 20~\\% unambiguous\neffects are expected for most peripheral collisions.\n", "  We discuss exclusive central diffractive production of $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ in\nproton-(anti)proton collisions at high energies. Based on a tensor pomeron\nmodel we present results of the purely diffractive dipion continuum, the scalar\n$f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(980)$ and tensor $f_{2}(1270)$ resonances decaying into\nthe $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ pairs as well as the photoproduction mechanism\n($\\rho^{0}$, Drell-S\\\"oding). We discuss how two pomerons couple to the tensor\nmeson $f_{2}(1270)$ and the interference effects of resonance and dipion\ncontinuum contributions. The theoretical results are compared with existing\nSTAR, CDF, and CMS experimental data. Predictions for planned or being carried\nout experiments (ALICE, ATLAS) are presented. We find that the relative\ncontribution of resonant $f_2(1270)$ and dipion continuum strongly depend on\nthe cut on proton transverse momenta (or four-momentum transfer squared\n$t_{1,2}$) which may explain some controversial observations made by different\nISR experiments in the past. The cuts may play then the role of a $\\pi \\pi$\nresonance filter.\n", "  The chalcogenide Bi$_2$Se$_3$ can attain the three dimensional (3D) Dirac\nsemimetal state under the influence of strain and microstrain. Here we report\nthe presnece of large linear magnetoresistance in such a Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystal.\nThe magnetoresistance has quadratic form at low fields which crossovers to\nlinear above 4 T. The temperature dependence of magnetoresistance scales with\ncarrier mobility and the crossover field scales with inverse of mobility. Our\nanalysis suggest that the linear magnetoresistance in our system has a\nclassical origin and arises from the scattering of high mobility 3D Dirac\nelectrons from crystalline inhomogeneities. We observe that the charged\nselenium vacancies are strongly screened by high mobility Dirac electrons and\nthe neutral crystalline defects are the main scattering center for transport\nmechanism. Our analysis suggests that both the resistivity and the\nmagnetoresistance have their origin in scattering of charge carriers from\nneutral defects.\n", "  We discuss the double-parton scattering (DPS) effects in four-jet production\nat the LHC. A special attention is given to the optimization of kinematical\nconditions in order to enhance the relative contribution of DPS in four-jet\nsample. The calculations of single-parton and double-parton scattering\ncomponents are done in the high-energy (or $k_{T}$)-factorization approach.\nHere we follow our recent developments of relevant methods and tools that are\nimplemented in the AVHLIB Monte Carlo library. Several differential\ndistributions are calculated and carefully discussed in the context of recent\nand future searches for DPS effects at the LHC, for both $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and\n$13$ TeV energies. The dependences of the relative DPS amount is studied as a\nfunction of rapidity of jets, rapidity distance, and various azimuthal\ncorrelations between jets. The regions with an enhanced DPS contribution are\nidentified.\n", "  Although the majority of known binary Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are\nsymbiotic systems (i.e. with a WD as a secondary star), main-sequence\ncompanions of AGB stars can be more numerous, even though they are more\ndifficult to find because the primary high luminosity hampers the detection of\nthe companion at visual wavelengths. However, in the ultraviolet the flux\nemitted by a secondary with T eff > 5500 ~ 6000 K may prevail over that of the\nprimary, and then it can be used to search for candidates to binary AGB stars.\nIn this work, theoretical atmosphere models are used to calculate the UV excess\nin the GALEX near- and far-UV bands due to a main-sequence companion. After\nanalysing a sample of confirmed binary AGB stars, we propose as a criterium for\nbinarity: (1) the detection of the AGB star in the GALEX far-UV band and/or (2)\na GALEX near-UV observed-to-predicted flux ratio > 20. These criteria have been\napplied to a volume-limited sample of AGB stars within 500 pc of the Sun; 34\nout of the sample of 58 AGB stars ( ~ 60%) fulfill them, implying to have a MS\ncompanion of spectral type earlier than K0. The excess in the GALEX near- and\nfar-UV bands cannot be attributed to a single temperature companion star, thus\nsuggesting that the UV emission of the secondary might be absorbed by the\nextended atmosphere and circumstellar envelope of the primary or that UV\nemission is produced in accretion flows.\n", "  We have carried out systematic fracture experiments in a single edge notch\ngeometry over a range of stretch rates on dual crosslink hydrogels made from\npolyvinyl alcohol chains chemically crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and\nphysically crosslinked with borate ions. If the energy release rate necessary\nfor crack propagation was calculated conventionally, by using the work done to\ndeform the sample to the critical value of stretch $\\lambda_c$ where the crack\npropagates, we found that the fracture energy $\\Gamma$ peaks around\n$\\lambda\\sim 0.001 s^{-1}$ before decreasing sharply with increasing stretch\nrate, in contradiction with the measurements of crack velocity. Combining\nsimulations and experimental observations, we propose therefore here a general\nmethod to separate the energy dissipated during loading before crack\npropagation, from that which is dissipated during crack propagation. For fast\nloading rates (with a characteristic strain rate only slightly lower than the\ninverse of the typical breaking time of physical bonds), this improved method\nto estimate a local energy release rate $g_{local}$ at the onset of crack\npropagation, gives a value of the local fracture energy $\\Gamma_{local}$ which\nis constant, consistent with the constant value of the crack propagation\nvelocity measured experimentally. Using this improved method we also obtain the\nvery interesting result that the dual crosslink gels have a much higher value\nof fracture energy at low loading rates than at high loading rates, contrary to\nthe situation in classical chemically crosslinked elastic networks.\n", "  The Fourier-discrete-peridogram are used to identify pulsation modes in\nvariables. We have found two pulsation modes in V1 and V2 among 13 new\nvariables as described by Abbas et al.. The five variables V9 to V13 are not\nshown close to periodic values by analysis of the frequency distribution of\nmulti-band data and also create difficulty to describe their varied nature. The\nmulti-band periodic values of V1 and V6 are matched with known literature\nvalues. The scattering of the varied nature of secondary pulsation modes is\neliminated by moving average methodology. The phase curve of secondary mode is\nfound to be more smooth compared to a prominent mode of pulsation.\n", "  In 1966 Pelofsky proposed an empirical linear correlation between the natural\nlogarithm of the surface tension and the reciprocal viscosity, which seems to\nwork adequately for a wide range of fluids. In particular, it has been shown\nthat it is useful in the case of n-alkanes and their binary and ternary\nmixtures. More recently however, it has been found not to work for several\nionic liquids unless the reciprocal viscosity is raised to a power. The\nexponent of this power was fixed to be 0.3, at least for the studied ionic\nfluids. In the present work, the performance and accuracy of both the original\nPelofsky correlation and the modified expression including the exponent are\nstudied for 56 non-ionic fluids of different kinds over a broad range of\ntemperatures. Also, the temperature range is delimited for which each\nexpression reproduces the surface tension values with average absolute\ndeviations below 1%. The needed coefficients are given for both the broad and\nthe delimited temperature range for each expression. Unfortunately, the results\nshow that the value of the exponent in the modified Pelofsky expression is\nsubstance-dependent for the normal fluids studied.\n", "  The ion collider ring of Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC)\naccommodates a wide range of ion energies, from 20 to 100 GeV for protons or\nfrom 8 to 40 GeV per nucleon for lead ions. In this medium energy range, ions\nare not fully relativistic, which means values of their relativistic beta are\nslightly below 1, leading to an energy dependence of revolution time of the\ncollider ring. On the other hand, electrons with energy 3 GeV and above are\nalready ultra-relativistic such that their speeds are effectively equal to the\nspeed of light. The difference in speeds of colliding electrons and ions in\nJLEIC, when translated into a path-length difference necessary to maintain the\nsame timing between electron and ion bunches, is quite large. In this paper, we\nexplore schemes for synchronizing the electron and ion bunches at a collision\npoint as the ion energy is varied.\n", "  Photoplethysmographic imaging is a camera-based solution for non-contact\ncardiovascular monitoring from a distance. This technology enables monitoring\nin situations where contact-based devices may be problematic or infeasible,\nsuch as ambulatory, sleep, and multi-individual monitoring. However, extracting\nthe blood pulse waveform signal is challenging due to the unknown mixture of\nrelevant (pulsatile) and irrelevant pixels in the scene. Here, we design and\nimplement a signal fusion framework, FusionPPG, for extracting a blood pulse\nwaveform signal with strong temporal fidelity from a scene without requiring\nanatomical priors (e.g., facial tracking). The extraction problem is posed as a\nBayesian least squares fusion problem, and solved using a novel probabilistic\npulsatility model that incorporates both physiologically derived spectral and\nspatial waveform priors to identify pulsatility characteristics in the scene.\nExperimental results show statistically significantly improvements compared to\nthe FaceMeanPPG method ($p<0.001$) and DistancePPG ($p<0.001$) methods. Heart\nrates predicted using FusionPPG correlated strongly with ground truth\nmeasurements ($r^2=0.9952$). FusionPPG was the only method able to assess\ncardiac arrhythmia via temporal analysis.\n", "  We consider convection in an internally heated layer of fluid that is bounded\nbelow by a perfect insulator and above by a poor conductor. The poorly\nconducting boundary is modelled by a fixed heat flux. Using solely analytical\nmethods, we find linear and energy stability thresholds for the static state,\nand we construct a lower bound on the mean temperature that applies to all\nflows. The linear stability analysis yields a Rayleigh number above which the\nstatic state is linearly unstable ($R_L$), and the energy analysis yields a\nRayleigh number below which it is globally stable ($R_E$). For various boundary\nconditions on the velocity, exact expressions for $R_L$ and $R_E$ are found\nusing long-wavelength asymptotics. Each $R_E$ is strictly smaller than the\ncorresponding $R_L$ but is within 1%. The lower bound on the mean temperature\nis proven for no-slip velocity boundary conditions using the background method.\nThe bound guarantees that the mean temperature of the fluid, relative to that\nof the top boundary, grows with the heating rate ($H$) no slower than\n$H^{2/3}$.\n", "  In a structural analysis of the proteasome activator PafE in Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, the binding of the activator or shorter constructs to the 20S\nproteasome core particle (20S CP) or derivatives was measured by isothermal\ntitration calorimetry (Bai et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 113: E1983-E1992.\n2016). The data were fitted by the authors by nonlinear least squares to give\ncurvilinear profiles that, at least in part, appear to fit the data very well.\nHowever, reanalysis of the data shows that the profiles are much better (P <\n0.001) represented as multiphasic, i.e. by a series of straight lines separated\nby discontinuous transitions, often in the form jumps, than by the conventional\ncurvilinear profiles.\n", "  A search has been made for supersymmetry in a final state containing two\nphotons and missing transverse momentum using the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider. The search makes use of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton\ncollision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015. Using a\ncombination of data-driven and Monte-Carlo-based approaches, the Standard Model\nbackground is estimated to be $0.27^{+0.22}_{-0.10}$ events. No events are\nobserved in the signal region; considering the expected background and its\nuncertainty, this observation implies a model-independent 95% CL upper limit of\n0.93 fb (3.0 events) on the visible cross section due to physics beyond the\nStandard Model. In the context of a generalized model of gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking with a bino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, this leads to a lower limit of 1650 GeV on the mass of a degenerate\noctet of gluino states, independent of the mass of the lighter bino-like\nneutralino.\n", "  We compare three different methods to obtain solutions of Sturm-Liouville\nproblems: a successive approximation method and two other iterative methods. We\nlook for solutions with periodic or anti periodic boundary conditions. With\nsome numerical test over the Mathieu equation, we compare the efficiency of\nthese three methods. As an application, we make a numerical analysis on a model\nfor carbon nanotubes.\n", "  We define a new class of Z' models with neutral flavour-changing interactions\nat tree level in the down-quark sector. They are related in an exact way to\nelements of the quark mixing matrix due to an underlying flavoured U(1)' gauge\nsymmetry, rendering these models particularly predictive. The same symmetry\nimplies lepton-flavour non-universal couplings, fully determined by the gauge\nstructure of the model. Our models allow to address several presently observed\ndeviations from the SM and specific correlations among the new physics\ncontributions to the Wilson coefficients C9,10(l) can be tested in b->sll\ntransitions. We furthermore predict lepton-universality violations in Z'\ndecays, testable at the LHC.\n", "  Establishing the relation between the ubiquitous antiferromagnetism in the\nnon-superconducting parent compounds of unconventional superconductors and\ntheir superconducting phase is believed to be important for the understanding\nof the complex physics in these materials. Going from the bulk systems to thin\nfilms strongly affects the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors. For\nFe$_{1+y}$Te, the parent compound of the Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$\nsuperconductors, bulk sensitive neutron diffraction has revealed an in-plane\noriented bicollinear antiferromagnetic structure. Here, we show by\nspin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy that on the surfaces of bulk\nFe$_{1+y}$Te, as well as on thin films grown on the topological insulator\nBi$_2$Te$_3$, the spin direction is canted both away from the surface plane and\nfrom the high-symmetry directions of the surface unit cell, while keeping the\nbicollinear magnetic structure. Our results demonstrate that the magnetism at\nthe Fe-chalcogenide surface markedly deviates from a simple in-plane oriented\nbicollinear antiferromagnetic structure, which implies that the pairing at the\nsurface of the related superconducting compounds might be different from that\nin the bulk.\n", "  We introduce a new Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) model for simulating\nprice evolution in an artificial financial market, based on a multilayer\nnetwork of traders. The model also implements, in a quite realistic way with\nrespect to previous studies, the order book dy- namics, by considering two\nassets with variable fundamental prices. Fat tails in the probability\ndistributions of normalized returns are observed, together with other features\nof real financial markets.\n", "  Two of the most important features of the solar atmosphere are its hot,\nsmooth coronal loops and the concentrations of magnetic shear, known as\nfilament channels, that reside above photospheric polarity inversion lines\n(PILs). The shear observed in filament channels represents magnetic helicity,\nwhile the smoothness of the coronal loops indicates an apparent lack of\nmagnetic helicity in the rest of the corona. At the same time, models that\nattempt to explain the high temperatures observed in these coronal loops\nrequire magnetic energy, in the form of twist, to be injected at the\nphotosphere. In addition to magnetic energy, this twist also represents\nmagnetic helicity. Unlike magnetic energy, magnetic helicity is conserved under\nreconnection, and is consequently expected to accumulate and be observed in the\ncorona. However, filament channels, rather than the coronal loops, are the\nlocations in the corona where magnetic helicity is observed, and it manifests\nitself in the form of shear, rather than twist. This naturally raises the\nquestion: if magnetic helicity needs to be injected to heat coronal loops, why\nis it only observed in filament channels, while coronal loops are observed to\nbe laminar and smooth? This thesis addresses this question using a series of\nnumerical simulations that demonstrate that magnetic helicity is transported\nthroughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection in such a way that it\naccumulates above PILs, forming filament channels, and leaving the rest of the\ncorona generally smooth. In the process, it converts magnetic energy into heat,\naccounting for the large observed temperatures. This thesis presents a model\nfor the formation of filament channels in the solar corona and the presence of\nsmooth, hot coronal loops, and shows how the transport of magnetic helicity\nthroughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection is responsible for both of\nthese phenomena.\n", "  The field of astrobiology has made tremendous progress in modelling\ngalactic-scale habitable zones which offer a stable environment for life to\nform and evolve in complexity. Recently, this idea has been extended to\ncosmological scales by studies modelling the habitability of the local Universe\nin its entirety (e.g. Dayal et al. 2015; Li & Zhang 2015). However, all of\nthese studies have solely focused on estimating the potentially detrimental\neffects of either Type II supernovae (SNII) or Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nignoring the contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). In this study we follow two different approaches, based on (i)\nthe amplitude of deleterious radiation and (ii) the total planet-hosting volume\nirradiated by deleterious radiation. We simultaneously track the contributions\nfrom the key astrophysical sources (SNII, SNIa, AGN and GRBs) for the entire\nUniverse, for both scenarios, to determine its habitability through 13.8\nbillion years of cosmic time. We find that SNII dominate the total radiation\nbudget and the volume irradiated by deleterious radiation at any cosmic epoch\nclosely followed by SNIa (that contribute half as much as SNII), with GRBs and\nAGN making up a negligible portion (<1%). Secondly, as a result of the total\nmass in stars (or the total number of planets) slowly building-up with time and\nthe total deleterious radiation density, and volume affected, falling-off after\nthe first 3 billion years, we find that the Universe has steadily increased in\nhabitability through cosmic time. We find that, depending on the exact model\nassumptions, the Universe is 2.5 to 20 times more habitable today compared to\nwhen life first appeared on the Earth 4 billion years ago. We find that this\nincrease in habitability will persist until the final stars die out over the\nnext hundreds of billions of years.\n", "  In May 2016 IBM released access to its 5-qubit quantum computer to the\nscientific community, its \"IBM Quantum Experience\" since acquiring over 25,000\nusers from students, educators and researchers around the globe. In the short\ntime since the \"IBM Quantum Experience\" became available, a flurry of research\nresults on 5-qubit systems have been published derived from the platform\nhardware. Quintuple is an open-source object-oriented Python module\nimplementing the simulation of the \"IBM Quantum Experience\" hardware. Quintuple\nquantum algorithms can be programmed and run via a custom language fully\ncompatible with the \"IBM Quantum Experience\" or in pure Python. Over 40 example\nprograms are provided with expected results, including Grover's Algorithm and\nthe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Quintuple contributes to the study of 5-qubit\nsystems and the development and debugging of quantum algorithms for deployment\non the \"IBM Quantum Experience\" hardware.\n", "  Recently Stanchev et al. (2015) proposed a technique to derive density\nscaling relations in a star-forming region from analysis of the probability\ndistribution function of column density. We address the possible dependence of\nthe outcome on the selection of probe zones, applying the method to Planck\ndust-opacity data on Orion A. The derived steep scaling relation of mean\ndensity with index -1.6 in the molecular cloud (so called `Central filament')\npoints to its self-gravitating nature. The result is reproduced also for large\nparts of the clouds' vicinity which indicates major role of gravity in the\nenergy balance of the entire star-forming region.\n", "  In this work we present a fully atomistic reactive (ReaxFF force field)\nmolecular dynamics study of the structural and dynamical aspects of the\none-side hydrogenation of graphene membranes, leading to the formation of the\nso-called graphone structure. We have considered different substrates:\ngraphene, few-layers graphene, graphite and platinum at different temperatures.\nOur results showed that the hydrogenation rates are very dependent on the\nsubstrate and thermal effects. Our results also showed that, similarly to\ngraphane, large hydrogenated domains are unlikely to be formed. These\nhydrogenation processes occur through the formation of uncorrelated cluster\ndomains.\n", "  We calculate the complete NNLO QCD corrections to the charm contribution of\nthe rare decay K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar. We encounter several new features, which\nwere absent in lower orders. We discuss them in detail and present the results\nfor the 2-loop matching conditions of the Wilson coefficients, the 3-loop\nanomalous dimensions, and the 2-loop matrix elements of the relevant operators\nthat enter the NNLO renormalization group analysis of the Z-penguin and the\nelectroweak box contribution. The inclusion of the NNLO QCD corrections leads\nto a significant reduction of the theoretical uncertainty from 9.8% down to\n2.4% in the relevant parameter Pc, implying the leftover scale uncertainties in\nBR(K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar) and in the determination of |V_td|, sin(2 beta), and\ngamma from the K -> pi nu nu system to be 1.3%, 1.0%, 0.006, and 1.2 degrees,\nrespectively. For the charm quark MSbar mass mc=(1.30+-0.05) GeV and |V_us|=\n0.2248 the NLO value Pc=0.37+-0.06 is modified to Pc=0.38+-0.04 at the NNLO\nlevel with the latter error fully dominated by the uncertainty in mc. We\npresent tables for Pc as a function of mc and alphas(MZ) and a very accurate\nanalytic formula that summarizes these two dependences as well as the dominant\ntheoretical uncertainties. Adding the recently calculated long-distance\ncontributions we find BR(K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar)=(8.0+-1.1)*10^-11 with the\npresent uncertainties in mc and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa elements being\nthe dominant individual sources in the quoted error. We also emphasize that\nimproved calculations of the long-distance contributions to K+ -> pi+ nu nu-bar\nand of the isospin breaking corrections in the evaluation of the weak current\nmatrix elements from K+ -> pi0 e+ nu would be valuable in order to increase the\npotential of the two golden K -> pi nu nu decays in the search for new physics.\n", "  For the noncommutative torus ${\\cal T}$, in case of the N.C. parameter\n$\\theta = \\frac{Z}{n}$ and the area of ${\\cal T}$ is an integer, we construct\nthe basis of Hilbert space ${\\cal H}_n$ in terms of $\\theta$ functions of the\npositions $z_i$ of $n$ solitons. The loop wrapping around the torus generates\nthe algebra ${\\cal A}_n$. We show that ${\\cal A}_n$ is isomorphic to the $Z_n\n\\times Z_n$ Heisenberg group on $\\theta$ functions. We find the explicit form\nfor the local operators, which is the generators $g$ of an elliptic $su(n)$,\nand transforms covariantly by the global gauge transformation of the Wilson\nloop in ${\\cal A}_n$. By acting on ${\\cal H}_n$ we establish the isomorphism of\n${\\cal A}_n$ and $g$. Then it is easy to give the projection operators\ncorresponding to the solitons and the ABS construction for generating solitons.\nWe embed this $g$ into the $L$-matrix of the elliptic Gaudin and C.M. models to\ngive the dynamics. For $\\theta$ generic case, we introduce the crossing\nparameter $\\eta$ related with $\\theta$ and the modulus of ${\\cal T}$. The\ndynamics of solitons is determined by the transfer matrix $T$ of the elliptic\nquantum group ${\\cal A}_{\\tau, \\eta}$, equivalently by the elliptic Ruijsenaars\noperators $M$. The eigenfunctions of $T$ found by Bethe ansatz appears to be\ntwisted by $\\eta$.\n", "  We use the variational method to obtain approximate analytical expressions\nfor the stationary pulselike solutions in birefringent fibers when differences\nin both phase velocities and group velocities between the two components and\nrapidly oscillating terms are taken into account. After checking the validity\nof the approximation we study how the soliton pulse shape depends on its\nvelocity and nonlinear propagation constant. By numerically solving the\npropagation equation we have found that most of these stationary solutions are\nstable.\n", "  We apply the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy for the partial\nreconstruction of correlated spin states. We determine the minimum set of\nobservables which are necessary for the complete reconstruction of the most\ncorrelated states of systems composed of spins-1/2 (e.g., the Bell and the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states). We investigate to what extent an\nincomplete measurement can reveal nonclassical features of correlated spin\nstates.\n", "  The two-dimensional Radon transform of the Wigner quasiprobability is\nintroduced in canonical form and the functions playing a role in its inversion\nare discussed. The transformation properties of this Radon transform with\nrespect to displacement and squeezing of states are studied and it is shown\nthat the last is equivalent to a symplectic transformation of the variables of\nthe Radon transform with the contragredient matrix to the transformation of the\nvariables in the Wigner quasiprobability. The reconstruction of the density\noperator from the Radon transform and the direct reconstruction of its\nFock-state matrix elements and of its normally ordered moments are discussed.\nIt is found that for finite-order moments the integration over the angle can be\nreduced to a finite sum over a discrete set of angles. The reconstruction of\nthe Fock-state matrix elements from the normally ordered moments leads to a new\nrepresentation of the pattern functions by convergent series over even or odd\nHermite polynomials which is appropriate for practical calculations. The\nstructure of the pattern functions as first derivatives of the products of\nnormalizable and nonnormalizable eigenfunctions to the number operator is\nconsidered from the point of view of this new representation.\n"]}
