A celebrated physical\ninterpretation of such tilings due to R.L. Brooks, C.A.B. Smith, A.H. Stone and\nW.T. Tutte uses direct-current circuits. The new approach of the paper is an\napplication of alternating-current circuits.\n  The following results are obtained:\n  - a necessary condition for a rectangle to be tilable by rectangles of given\nshapes;\n  - a criterion for a rectangle to be tilable by rectangles similar to it but\nnot all homothetic to it;\n  - a criterion for a generic polygon to be tilable by squares.\n  These results generalize the ones of C. Freiling, R. Kenyon, M. Laczkovich,\nD. Rinne and G. Szekeres.\n", "  Two kinds of recursive lattices with the same coordination number but\ndifferent unit cells (2-D square and 3-D cube) are constructed and the\nantiferromagnetic Ising model is solved exactly on them to study the stable and\nmetastable states. The Ising model with multi-particle interactions is designed\nto represent a monatomic system or an alloy. Two solutions of the model exhibit\nthe crystallization of liquid, and the ideal glass transition of supercooled\nliquid respectively. Based on the solutions, the thermodynamics on both\nlattices was examined. In particular, the free energy, energy, and entropy of\nthe ideal glass, supercooled liquid, crystal, and liquid state of the model on\neach lattice were calculated and compared with each other. Interactions between\nparticles farther away than the nearest neighbor distance are taken into\nconsideration. The two lattices show comparable properties on the transition\ntemperatures and the thermodynamic behaviors, which proves that both of them\nare practical to describe the regular 3-D case, while the different effects of\nthe unit types are still obvious.\n", "  A new model of quantum computing has recently been proposed which, in analogy\nwith a classical lambda-calculus, exploits quantum processes which operate on\nother quantum processes. One such quantum meta-operator takes N unitary\ntransformations as input, coherently permutes their ordering, and outputs a new\ncomposite operator which can be applied to a quantum state. Here we propose an\noptical device which implements this type of coherent operator permutation.\nThis device requires only one physical implementation of each operator to be\npermuted.\n", "  Von Neumann's uniqueness theorem is extended to a special class of canonical\ncommutation relations, namely the anti-Fock representations, which are realized\non a Krein space.\n", "  Bound states of dipole-bound negative anions are studied by using a\nnon-adiabatic pseudopotential method and the Berggren expansion involving bound\nstates, decaying resonant states, and non-resonant scattering continuum. The\nmethod is benchmarked by using the traditional technique of direct integration\nof coupled channel equations. A good agreement between the two methods has been\nfound for well-bound states. For weakly-bound subthreshold states with binding\nenergies comparable with rotational energies of the anion, the direct\nintegration approach breaks down and the Berggren expansion method becomes the\ntool of choice.\n", "  In many complex social systems, the timing and frequency of interactions\nbetween individuals are observable but friendship ties are hidden. Recovering\nthese hidden ties, particularly for casual users who are relatively less\nactive, would enable a wide variety of friendship-aware applications in domains\nwhere labeled data are often unavailable, including online advertising and\nnational security. Here, we investigate the accuracy of multiple statistical\nfeatures, based either purely on temporal interaction patterns or on the\ncooperative nature of the interactions, for automatically extracting latent\nsocial ties. Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derived\nfrom an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors for\nrecovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18\nbillion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online game\nHalo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more data\naccumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However,\nperiodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify\n95% of ties, even for casual users. These results clarify the nature of\nfriendship in online social environments and suggest new opportunities and new\nprivacy concerns for friendship-aware applications that do not require the\ndisclosure of private friendship information.\n", "  Squeezed many-body states of atoms are a valuable resource for high precision\nfrequency metrology and could tremendously boost the performance of atomic\nlattice clocks. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a viable approach to spin\nsqueezing in lattice clocks via optical dressing of one clock state to a highly\nexcited Rydberg state, generating switchable atomic interactions. For realistic\nexperimental parameters, this is shown to generate over 10 dB of squeezing in a\nfew microseconds interaction time without affecting the subsequent clock\ninterrogation.\n", "  Members of social networks are given opportunities to bestow positive\nrecognition upon one another by means of constructs such as \"likes\" and\n\"retweets.\" Although recipients no doubt experience utility from these actions,\none might question why these constructs with no intrinsic value for the sender\nare exchanged at all. Here we formulate a metric for the prestige of a member\nof a social network based on his or her place within the network and the rate\nat which \"likes\" are exchanged within his or her social circle. Simulation\nreveals that the 1% most strategically-optimized networks exchange likes at an\naverage rate 23.5% higher than that of their random counterparts. This suggests\nthat purely strategic agents, even with no concern for altruism or the general\nwelfare, experience utility from giving social gratification. Further, we show\nthat prestige-maximization creates a selective pressure for structural features\nassociated with social networks including clustering and the small-world\nproperty.\n", "  The purpose of the SOLIS Zeemanfit Code is to provide a straight-forward,\neasily checked measure of the total magnetic-field strength in the\nhigh-strength umbral regions of the solar disk. In the highest-strength\nregions, the Zeeman splitting of the 6302-angstrom Fe line becomes wide enough\nfor the triplet nature of the line to be visible by eye in non-polarized light.\nTherefore, a three-line fit to the spectra should, in principle, provide a\nfairly robust measure of the total magnetic-field strength.\n  The code uses the Level-1.5 spec-cube data of the SOLIS VSM 6302-vector\nobservations (specifically the Stokes-I and Stokes-V components) to fit the\nline profiles at each appropriate pixel and calculate the\nmagnetic-field-strength from the line-center separation of the two fit 6302.5\nsigma-components. The 6301.5-angstrom Fe line is also present and fit in the\nVSM 6302-vector data, but it is an anomalous-Zeeman line with a weaker response\nto magnetic fields. Therefore, no magnetic- field measure is derived from this\nportion of the spectral fit.\n", "  An $N$ ${L} \\choose {L/2}$-dimensional representation of the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra $TL_L(x)$ is presented. It is also a representation of\nthe cyclic group $Z_N$. We choose $x = 1$ and define a Hamiltonian as a sum of\nthe generators of the algebra acting in this representation. This Hamiltonian\ngives the time evolution operator of a stochastic process. In the finite-size\nscaling limit, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian contains representations of the\nVirasoro algebra with complex highest weights. The $N = 3$ case is discussed in\ndetail. One discusses shortly the consequences of the existence of complex\nVirasoro representations on the physical properties of the systems.\n", "  Interactions among people or objects are often dynamic in nature and can be\nrepresented as a sequence of networks, each providing a snapshot of the\ninteractions over a brief period of time. An important task in analyzing such\nevolving networks is change-point detection, in which we both identify the\ntimes at which the large-scale pattern of interactions changes fundamentally\nand quantify how large and what kind of change occurred. Here, we formalize for\nthe first time the network change-point detection problem within an online\nprobabilistic learning framework and introduce a method that can reliably solve\nit. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with a\nBayesian hypothesis test to quantitatively determine if, when, and precisely\nhow a change point has occurred. We analyze the detectability of our method\nusing synthetic data with known change points of different types and\nmagnitudes, and show that this method is more accurate than several previously\nused alternatives. Applied to two high-resolution evolving social networks,\nthis method identifies a sequence of change points that align with known\nexternal \"shocks\" to these networks.\n", "  The Carnot engine sets an upper limit to the efficiency of a practical heat\nengine. An arbitrary irreversible engine is sometimes believed to behave\nclosely as the Curzon-Ahlborn engine. Efficiency of the latter is obtained\ncommonly by invoking the maximum power principle in a non-equilibrium\nframework. We outline here two plausible routes within the domain of classical\nthermodynamics to arrive at the same expression. Further studies on the\nperformances of available practical engines reveal that a simpler approximate\nformula works much better in respect of bounds to the efficiency. Putting an\nintermediate-temperature reservoir between the actual source and the sink leads\nto a few interesting extra observations.\n", "  Nonlocal correlations, a longstanding foundational topic in quantum\ninformation, have recently found application as a resource for cryptographic\ntasks where not all devices are trusted, for example in settings with a highly\nsecure central hub, such as a bank or government department, and less secure\nsatellite stations which are inherently more vulnerable to hardware \"hacking\"\nattacks. The asymmetric phenomena of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering plays a\nkey role in one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution (1sDI-QKD)\nprotocols. In the context of continuous-variable (CV) QKD schemes utilizing\nGaussian states and measurements, we identify all protocols that can be 1sDI\nand their maximum loss tolerance. Surprisingly, this includes a protocol that\nuses only coherent states. We also establish a direct link between the relevant\nEPR steering inequality and the secret key rate, further strengthening the\nrelationship between these asymmetric notions of nonlocality and device\nindependence. We experimentally implement both entanglement-based and\ncoherent-state protocols, and measure the correlations necessary for 1sDI key\ndistribution up to an applied loss equivalent to 7.5 km and 3.5 km of optical\nfiber transmission respectively. We also engage in detailed modelling to\nunderstand the limits of our current experiment and the potential for further\nimprovements. The new protocols we uncover apply the cheap and efficient\nhardware of CVQKD systems in a significantly more secure setting.\n", "  In this short communication we present an original way to couple the Brownian\nmotion and the heat equation. More in general, we suggest a way for coupling\nthe Langevin equation for a particle, which describes a single realization of\nits trajectory, with the associated Fokker-Planck equation, which instead\ndescribes the evolution of the particle's probability density function.\nNumerical results show that it is indeed possible to obtain a regularized\nBrownian motion and a Brownianized heat equation still preserving the global\nstatistical properties of the solutions. The results also suggest that the more\nmacroscale leads the dynamics the more one can reduce the microscopic degrees\nof freedom.\n", "  Drawing inspiration from real world interacting systems we study a system\nconsisting of two networks that exhibit antagonistic and dependent\ninteractions. By antagonistic and dependent interactions, we mean, that a\nproportion of functional nodes in a network cause failure of nodes in the\nother, while failure of nodes in the other results in failure of links in the\nfirst. As opposed to interdependent networks, which can exhibit first order\nphase transitions, we find that the phase transitions in such networks are\ncontinuous. Our analysis shows that, compared to an isolated network, the\nsystem is more robust against random attacks. Surprisingly, we observe a region\nin the parameter space where the giant connected components of both networks\nstart oscillating. Furthermore, we find that for Erdos-Renyi and scale free\nnetworks the system oscillates only when the dependency and antagonism between\nthe two networks is very high. We believe that this study can further our\nunderstanding of real world interacting systems.\n", "  Bound and resonance states of the dipole-bound anion of hydrogen cyanide\nHCN$^-$ are studied using a non-adiabatic pseudopotential method and the\nBerggren expansion technique involving bound states, decaying resonant states,\nand non-resonant scattering continuum. We devise an algorithm to identify the\nresonant states in the complex energy plane. To characterize spatial\ndistributions of electronic wave functions, we introduce the body-fixed density\nand use it to assign families of resonant states into collective rotational\nbands. We find that the non-adiabatic coupling of electronic motion to\nmolecular rotation results in a transition from the strong-coupling to\nweak-coupling regime. In the strong coupling limit, the electron moving in a\nsubthreshold, spatially extended halo state follows the rotational motion of\nthe molecule. Above the ionization threshold, electron's motion in a resonance\nstate becomes largely decoupled from molecular rotation. Widths of\nresonance-band members depend primarily on the electron orbital angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We study the ODE/IM correspondence for ODE associated to $\\hat{\\mathfrak\ng}$-valued connections, for a simply-laced Lie algebra $\\mathfrak g$. We prove\nthat subdominant solutions to the ODE defined in different fundamental\nrepresentations satisfy a set of quadratic equations called $\\Psi$-system. This\nallows us to show that the generalized spectral determinants satisfy the Bethe\nAnsatz equations.\n", "  We formulate the Gamow shell model (GSM) in coupled-channel (CC)\nrepresentation for the description of proton/neutron radiative capture\nreactions and present the first application of this new formalism for the\ncalculation of cross-sections in mirror reactions 7Be(p,gamma)8B and\n7Li(n,gamma)8Li. The GSM-CC formalism is applied to a translationally-invariant\nHamiltonian with an effective finite-range two-body interaction. Reactions\nchannels are built by GSM wave functions for the ground state 3/2- and the\nfirst excited state 1/2- of 7Be/7Li and the proton/neutron wave function\nexpanded in different partial waves.\n", "  We analyze van der Waals interactions between two rigid polymers with\nsequence-specific, anisotropic polarizabilities along the polymer backbones, so\nthat the dipole moments fluctuate parallel to the polymer backbones. Assuming\nthat each polymer has a quenched-in polarizability sequence which reflects, for\nexample, the polynucleotide sequence of a double-stranded DNA molecule, we\nstudy the van der Waals interaction energy between a pair of such polymers with\nrod-like structure for the cases where their respective polarizability\nsequences are (i) distinct and (ii) identical, with both zero and non-zero\ncorrelation length of the polarizability correlator along the polymer backbones\nin the latter case. For identical polymers, we find a novel $r^{-5}$ scaling\nbehavior of the van der Waals interaction energy for small inter-polymer\nseparation $r$, in contradistinction to the $r^{-4}$ scaling behavior of\ndistinct polymers, with furthermore a pronounced angular dependence favoring\nattraction between sufficiently aligned identical polymers. Such behavior can\nassist the molecular recognition between polymers.\n", "  Professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying the\ndynamics of social competitions. These games are constructed with simple,\nwell-defined rules and payoffs that admit a high-dimensional set of possible\nactions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. The resulting gameplay and efforts to\npredict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports\nprofessionals and enthusiasts. In this paper, we consider two online prediction\nproblems for team sports:~given a partially observed game Who will score next?\nand ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable generative models\nof within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and\non the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models to\ncomprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year\nperiod. By assessing these models' relative goodness-of-fit we shed new light\non the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynamics of each\nsport. Furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our models\nconsistently outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitative\nassessments of the latent team skill, over time.\n", "  The hard disk model is a 2D Gibbsian process of particles interacting via\npure hard core repulsion. At high particle density the model is believed to\nshow orientational order, however, it is known not to exhibit positional order.\nHere we investigate to what extent particle positions may fluctuate. We\nconsider a finite volume version of the model in a box of dimensions $2n \\times\n2n$ with arbitrary boundary configuration,and we show that the mean square\ndisplacement of particles near the center of the box is bounded from below by\n$c \\log n$. The result generalizes to a large class of models with fairly\narbitrary interaction.\n", "  A self-consistent theory is proposed for the general problem of interacting\nundulating fluid membranes subject to the constraint that they do not\ninterpenetrate. We implement the steric constraint via an exact functional\nintegral representation, and through the use of a saddle-point approximation\ntransform it into a novel effective steric potential. The steric potential is\nfound to consist of two contributions: one generated by zero mode fluctuations\nof the membranes, and the other by thermal bending fluctuations. For membranes\nof cross-sectional area $S$, we find that the bending fluctuation part scales\nwith the inter-membrane separation $d$ as $d^{-2}$ for $d \\ll \\sqrt{S}$, but\ncrosses over to $d^{-4}$ scaling for $d \\gg \\sqrt{S}$, whereas the zero mode\npart of the steric potential always scales as $d^{-2}$. For membranes\ninteracting exclusively via the steric potential, we obtain closed-form\nexpressions for the effective interaction potential and for the rms undulation\namplitude $\\sigma$, which becomes small at low temperatures $T$ and/or large\nbending stiffnesses $\\kappa$. Moreover, $\\sigma$ scales as $d$ for $d \\ll\n\\sqrt{S}$, but saturates at $\\sqrt{k_{{\\rm B}} T S/\\kappa}$ for $d \\gg\n\\sqrt{S}$. In addition, using variational Gaussian theory, we apply our\nself-consistent treatment to study inter-membrane interactions subject to three\ndifferent types of potential: (i)~the Moreira-Netz potential for a pair of\nstrongly charged membranes with an intervening solution of multivalent\ncounterions, (ii)~an attractive square well, (iii)~the Morse potential, and\n(iv)~a combination of hydration and van der Waals interactions.\n", "  Measurements of the branching ratios of top quark decays into leptons and\njets using events with $t \\overline{t}$ (top antitop) pairs are reported.\nEvents were recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The collected data sample corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 4.6 ${\\mathrm{fb}}^{-1}$. The measured top quark\nbranching ratios agree with the Standard Model predictions within the\nmeasurement uncertainties of a few percent.\n", "  We calculate the joint distribution $P(S,Q)$ of the scattering matrix $S$ and\ntime-delay matrix $Q=-i\\hbar S^\\dagger dS/dE$ of a chaotic quantum dot coupled\nby point contacts to metal electrodes. While $S$ and $Q$ are statistically\nindependent for ballistic coupling, they become correlated for tunnel coupling.\nWe relate the ensemble averages of $Q$ and $S$ and thereby obtain the average\ndensity of states at the Fermi level. We apply this to a calculation of the\neffect of a tunnel barrier on the Majorana resonance in a topological\nsuperconductor. We find that the presence of a Majorana bound state is hidden\nin the density of states and in the thermal conductance if even a single\nscattering channel has unit tunnel probability. The electrical conductance\nremains sensitive to the appearance of a Majorana bound state, and we calculate\nthe variation of the average conductance through a topological phase\ntransition.\n", "  Strong interactions between single spins and photons are essential for\nquantum networks and distributed quantum computation. They provide the\nnecessary interface for entanglement distribution, non-destructive quantum\nmeasurements, and strong photon-photon interactions. Achieving spin-photon\ninteractions in a solid-state device could enable compact chip-integrated\nquantum circuits operating at gigahertz bandwidths. Many theoretical works have\nsuggested using spins embedded in nanophotonic structures to attain this\nhigh-speed interface. These proposals exploit strong light-matter interactions\nto implement a quantum switch, where the spin flips the state of the photon and\na photon flips the spin-state. However, such a switch has not yet been realized\nusing a solid-state spin system. Here, we report an experimental realization of\na spin-photon quantum switch using a single solid-state spin embedded in a\nnanophotonic cavity. We show that the spin-state strongly modulates the cavity\nreflection coefficient, which conditionally flips the polarization state of a\nreflected photon on picosecond timescales. We also demonstrate the\ncomplementary effect where a single photon reflected from the cavity coherently\nrotates the spin. These strong spin-photon interactions open up a promising\ndirection for solid-state implementations of high-speed quantum networks and\non-chip quantum information processors using nanophotonic devices.\n", "  A Higgs portal dark matter model for explaining the gamma-ray excess from the\ngalactic center can be realized with the extension of local $SU(2)_X$ gauge\nsymmetry with one quadruplet. Due to the residual $Z_3$ discrete symmetry of\n$SU(2)_X$, the new gauge bosons are the stable dark matter candidates. Due to\nthe mixture of the standard model Higgs doublet and the introduced quadruplet,\ndark matter could annihilate into the standard model particles through the\nHiggs portal and new scalar portal. We study the discovery significance of the\nvector dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider. The involved parameters are\nconsistent with the constraints from relic density and direct detection and\nwith the data of the galactic center gamma-ray excess. With $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV\nand luminosities of $100$ and $300$ fb$^{-1}$, we find that a discovery\nsignificance of $S/\\sqrt{B}=5$ can be easily reached if the production of dark\nmatter is through the invisible decays of the Higgs boson and a new scalar\nboson.\n", "  For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the\nnetwork and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of\nindividuals in a social network, geographic location of nodes in the Internet,\nor cellular function of nodes in a gene regulatory network. Here we demonstrate\nhow this \"metadata\" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding of\nnetwork structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection\nin networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a\nnetwork and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done\nwith either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are\ncorrelated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the method\nlearns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata\ndepending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlations\nare also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions about\nthe community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. We\ndemonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on\nreal-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, and\ntechnological domains.\n", "  The pressure-induced structural phase transition in the intermediate-valence\ncompound CeNi has been investigated by X-ray and neutron powder diffraction\ntechniques. For the first time it is shown that the structure of the\npressure-induced CeNi phase (phases) can be described in terms of the Pnma\nspace group. Equations of state for CeNi on both sides of the phase transition\nare derived and an approximate P-T phase diagram is suggested for P < 8 GPa and\nT < 300 K. The observed Cmcm -> Pnma structural transition is analyzed using\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations, which successfully reproduce the\nground state volume, the phase transition pressure, and the volume collapse\nassociated with the phase transition.\n", "  In regimes far beyond the wavebreaking threshold of Raman amplification, we\nshow that significant amplifcation can occur after the onset of wavebreaking,\nbefore phase mixing destroys the coherent coupling between pump, probe and\nplasma wave. Amplification in this regime is therefore a transient effect, with\nthe higher-efficiency \"coherent wavebreaking\" (CWB) regime accessed by using a\nshort, intense probe. Parameter scans illustrate the marked difference in\nbehaviour between below wavebreaking, in which the energy-transfer efficiency\nis high but total energy transfer is low, wavebreaking, in which efficiency is\nlow, and CWB, in which moderate efficiencies allow the highest total energy\ntransfer.\n", "  Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as\nits coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The\ncombinations include the results of the analyses of the $H\\to\\gamma\\gamma,\\,\nZZ^*,\\, WW^*,\\, Z\\gamma,\\, b\\bar{b},\\, \\tau\\tau$ and $\\mu\\mu$ decay modes, and\nthe constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on\nthe off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on\nthe LHC proton-proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to\n4.7 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and 20.3 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining\nall production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised\nto the Standard Model expectation, is $1.18^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$. The observed\nHiggs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order\ncoupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both\nwith and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model\nparticle content in loop processes. The data are found to be compatible with\nthe Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for\nall models considered.\n", "  We consider the problem of correlation functions in the stationary states of\none-dimensional stochastic models having conformal invariance. If one considers\nthe space dependence of the correlators, the novel aspect is that although one\nconsiders systems with periodic boundary conditions, the observables are\ndescribed by boundary operators. From our experience with equilibrium problems\none would have expected bulk operators. Boundary operators have correlators\nhaving critical exponents being half of those of bulk operators. If one studies\nthe space-time dependence of the two-point function, one has to consider one\nboundary and one bulk operators. The Raise and Peel model has conformal\ninvariance as can be shown in the spin 1/2 basis of the Hamiltonian which gives\nthe time evolution of the system. This is an XXZ quantum chain with twisted\nboundary condition and local interactions. This Hamiltonian is integrable and\nthe spectrum is known in the finite-size scaling limit. In the stochastic base\nin which the process is defined, the Hamiltonian is not local anymore. The\nmapping into an SOS model, helps to define new local operators. As a byproduct\nsome new properties of the SOS model are conjectured. The predictions of\nconformal invariance are discussed in the new framework and compared with Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n", "  We consider the van der Waals interaction between a pair of polymers with\nquenched heterogeneous sequences of local polarizabilities along their\nbackbones, and study the effective pairwise interaction energy for both stiff\npolymers and flexible Gaussian coils. In particular, we focus on the cases\nwhere the pair of polarizability sequences are (i)~distinct and (ii)~identical.\nWe find that the pairwise interaction energies of distinct and identical\nGaussian coils are both isotropic and exhibit the same decay behavior for\nseparations larger than the gyration radius, in contradistinction to the\norientationally anisotropic interaction energies of distinct and identical\nstiff polymers. For both Gaussian coils and stiff polymers, the attractive\ninteraction between identical polymers is enhanced if the polarizability\nsequence is more heterogeneous.\n", "  Topology and geometry are essential to our understanding of modern physics,\nunderlying many foundational concepts from high energy theories, quantum\ninformation, and condensed matter physics. In condensed matter systems, a wide\nrange of phenomena stem from the geometry of the band eigenstates, which is\nencoded in the matrix-valued Wilson line for general multi-band systems. Using\nan ultracold gas of Rb atoms loaded in a honeycomb optical lattice, we realize\nstrong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines and\nobserve an evolution in the band populations that directly reveals the band\ngeometry. Our technique enables a full determination of band eigenstates, Berry\ncurvature, and topological invariants, including single- and multi-band Chern\nand $Z_2$ numbers.\n", "  Regge action is represented analogously to how the Palatini action for\ngeneral relativity (GR) as some functional of the metric and a general\nconnection as independent variables represents the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n  The piecewise flat (or simplicial) spacetime of Regge calculus is equipped\nwith some world coordinates and some piecewise affine metric which is\ncompletely defined by the set of edge lengths and the world coordinates of the\nvertices. The conjugate variables are the general nondegenerate matrices on the\n3-simplices which play a role of a general discrete connection. Our previous\nresult on some representation of the Regge calculus action in terms of the\nlocal Euclidean (Minkowsky) frame vectors and orthogonal connection matrices as\nindependent variables is somewhat modified for the considered case of the\ngeneral linear group GL(4,R) of the connection matrices.\n  As a result, we have some action invariant w. r. t. arbitrary change of\ncoordinates of the vertices (and related GL(4,R) transformations in the\n4-simplices). Excluding GL(4,R) connection from this action via the equations\nof motion we have exactly the Regge action for the considered spacetime.\n", "  Spatio-temporal imaging of light propagation is very important in photonics\nbecause it provides the most direct tool available to study the interaction\nbetween light and its host environment. Sub-ps time resolution is needed to\ninvestigate the fine and complex structural features that characterize\ndisordered and heterogeneous structures, which are responsible for a rich array\nof transport physics that have not yet been fully explored. A newly developed\nwide-field imaging system enables us to present a spatio-temporal study on\nlight transport in various disordered media, revealing properties that could\nnot be properly assessed using standard techniques. By extending our\ninvestigation to an almost transparent membrane, a configuration that has been\ndifficult to characterize until now, we unveil the peculiar physics exhibited\nby such thin scattering systems with transport features that go beyond\nmainstream diffusion modeling, despite the occurrence of multiple scattering.\n", "  We present Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) 5-21 micron spectroscopic maps\ntowards 12 regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). These regions include the\nnucleus, bulge, an active region in the star-forming ring, and 9 other regions\nchosen to cover a range of mid-to-far-infrared colours. In line with previous\nresults, PAH feature ratios (6.2 micron and 7.7 micron features compared to the\n11.2 micron feature) measured from our extracted M31 spectra, except the\nnucleus, strongly correlate. The equivalent widths of the main PAH features, as\na function of metallicity and radiation hardness, are consistent with those\nobserved for other nearby spiral and starburst galaxies. Reprocessed data from\nthe ISOCAM instrument on the Infrared Space Observatory agree with the IRS\ndata; early reports of suppressed 6-8 micron features and enhanced 11.3 micron\nfeature intensity and FWHM apparently resulted from background-subtraction\nproblems. The nucleus does not show any PAH emission but does show strong\nsilicate emission at 9.7 micron. Furthermore, different spectral features (11.3\nmicron PAH emission, silicate emission and [NeIII] 15.5 micron line emission)\nhave distinct spatial distributions in the nuclear region: the silicate\nemission is strongest towards the stellar nucleus, while the PAH emission peaks\n15 arcsec north of the nucleus. The PAH feature ratios at this position are\natypical with strong emission at 11.2 microns and 15-20 microns but weak\nemission at 6--8 microns. The nucleus itself is dominated by stellar light\ngiving rise to a strong blue continuum and silicate emission.\n", "  Quantum theory presents us with the tools for computational and communication\nadvantages over classical theory. One approach to uncovering the source of\nthese advantages is to determine how computation and communication power vary\nas quantum theory is replaced by other operationally-defined theories from a\nbroad framework of such theories. Such investigations may reveal some of the\nkey physical features required for powerful computation and communication. In\nthis paper we investigate how simple physical principles bound the power of two\ndifferent computational paradigms which combine computation and communication\nin a non-trivial fashion: computation with advice and interactive proof\nsystems. We show that the existence of non-trivial dynamics in a theory implies\na bound on the power of computation with advice. Moreover, we provide an\nexplicit example of a theory with no non-trivial dynamics in which the power of\ncomputation with advice is unbounded. Finally we show that the power of simple\ninteractive proof systems in theories where local measurements suffice for\ntomography is non-trivially bounded. This result provides a proof that QMA is\ncontained in PP which does not make use of any uniquely quantum structure -\nsuch as the fact that observables correspond to self-adjoint operators - and\nthus may be of independent interest.\n", "  Quantum dots are useful model systems for studying quantum thermoelectric\nbehavior because of their highly energy-dependent electron transport\nproperties, which are tunable by electrostatic gating. As a result of this\nstrong energy dependence, the thermoelectric response of quantum dots is\nexpected to be nonlinear with respect to an applied thermal bias. However,\nuntil now this effect has been challenging to observe because, first, it is\nexperimentally difficult to apply a sufficiently large thermal bias at the\nnanoscale and, second, it is difficult to distinguish thermal bias effects from\npurely temperature-dependent effects due to overall heating of a device. Here\nwe take advantage of a novel thermal biasing technique and demonstrate a\nnonlinear thermoelectric response in a quantum dot which is defined in a\nheterostructured semiconductor nanowire. We also show that a theoretical model\nbased on the Master equations fully explains the observed nonlinear\nthermoelectric response given the energy-dependent transport properties of the\nquantum dot.\n", "  The effect of non-Newtonian rheology, manifested through a viscoelastic\nlinearized Maxwell model, on the time-dependent non-equilibrium concentration\nfluctuations due to free diffusion as well as thermal diffusion of a species is\nanalyzed theoretically. The non-equilibrium process is quantified through the\nconcentration fluctuation auto-correlation function, also known as the dynamic\nstructure factor. The analysis reveals that the effect of rheology is prominent\nfor both the cases of free diffusion and thermal diffusion at long times where\nthe rheology dictates not only the location of the peaks in concentration\nauto-correlations, but also the magnitudes; such peaks in the auto-correlation\nfunction are absent in the case of a Newtonian fluid. At smaller times, for the\ncase of free diffusion presence of time-dependent peak(s) are observed, which\nare weakly dependent on the influence of rheology, a phenomenon which is absent\nin the case of thermal diffusion. Lastly, different regimes of the frequency\ndependent overall dynamic structure factor depending on the interplay of the\nfluid relaxation time and momentum diffusivity are evaluated.\n", "  Real physical systems are only understood, experimentally or theoretically,\nto a finite resolution so in their analysis there is generally an ignorance of\npossible short-range phenomena. It is also well-known that the boundary\nconditions of wavefunctions and fields can be used to model short-range\ninteractions when those interactions are expected, a priori. Here, a real-space\napproach is described wherein an artificial boundary of ignorance is imposed to\nexplicitly exclude from analysis the region of a system wherein short-distance\neffects may be obscure. The (artificial) boundary conditions encode those\nshort-distance effects by parameterizing the possible UV completions of the\nwavefunction. Since measurable quantities, such as spectra and cross sections,\nmust be independent of the position of the artificial boundary, the boundary\nconditions must evolve with the radius of the boundary in a particular way. As\nexamples of this approach, an analysis is performed of the non-relativistic\nfree particle, harmonic oscillator, and Coulomb potential, and some known\nresults for point-like (contact) interactions are recovered, however from a\nnovel perspective. Generically, observables differ from their canonical values\nand symmetries are anomalously broken compared to those of idealized models.\nConnections are made to well-studied physical systems, such as the binding of\nlight nuclei and cold atomic systems. This method is arguably more physically\ntransparent and mathematically easier to use than other techniques that require\nthe regularization and renormalization of delta-function potentials, and may\noffer further generalizations of practical use.\n", "  We derive a general resummation formula for transverse-momentum distributions\nof hard processes at the leading logarithmic level in the high-energy limit, to\nall orders in the strong coupling. Our result is based on a suitable\ngeneralization of high-energy factorization theorems, whereby all-order\nresummation is reduced to the determination of the Born-level process but with\nincoming off-shell gluons. We validate our formula by applying it to Higgs\nproduction in gluon fusion in the infinite top mass limit. We check our result\nup to next-to-leading order by comparison to the high energy limit of the exact\nexpression and to next-to-next-to leading by comparison to NNLL order trasverse\nmomentum (Sudakov) resummation, and we predict the high-energy behaviour at\nnext$^3$-to-leading order. We also show that the structure of the result in the\nsmall transverse momentum limit agrees to all orders with general constraints\nfrom Sudakov resummation.\n", "  A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a\nvector boson with the decay $H\\rightarrow \\tau\\tau$ is presented. The data\ncorrespond to 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity from proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC\nduring 2012. The data agree with the background expectation, and 95%\nconfidence-level upper limits are placed on the cross section of this process.\nThe observed (expected) limit, expressed in terms of the signal strength $\\mu =\n\\sigma/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SM}}$ for $m_\\mathrm{H} = 125 GeV$, is $\\mu <$ 5.6\n(3.7). The measured value of the signal strength is $\\mu = 2.3\\pm1.6$.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of numerical simulations intended to\nstudy the behavior of non-Abelian cosmic strings networks. In particular we are\ninterested in discussing the variations in the asymptotic behavior of the\nsystem as we variate the number of generators for the topological defects. A\nsimple model which should generate cosmic strings is presented and its lattice\ndiscretization is discussed. The evolution of the generated cosmic string\nnetworks is then studied for different values for the number of generators for\nthe topological defects. Scaling solution appears to be approached in most\ncases and we present an argument to justify the lack of scaling for the\nresidual cases.\n", "  The production rates of prompt and non-prompt $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\psi(2\\mathrm{S})$ mesons are measured using 2.1 $fb^{-1}$ and 11.4 $fb^{-1}$\nof data collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV respectively. Production cross-sections\nfor both prompt and non-prompt production sources, ratios of\n$\\psi(2\\mathrm{S})$ to $J/\\psi$ production, and fractions of non-prompt to\ninclusive production for $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2\\mathrm{S})$ are measured\ndouble-differentially as a function of meson $p_{T}$ and rapidity. These\nmeasurements are made in a restricted fiducial volume and also corrected for\ngeometrical acceptance after which they are compared to a variety of\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  One-qubit pure states, living on the surface of Bloch sphere, can be mapped\nonto the usual complex plane by using stereographic projection. In this paper,\nafter reviewing the entanglement of two-qubit pure state, it is shown that the\n\\emph{quaternionic} stereographic projection is related to concurrence measure.\nThis is due to the fact that every two-qubit state, in ordinary complex field,\ncorresponds to the one-qubit state in quaternionic skew field, called\nquaterbit. Like the one-qubit states in complex field, the stereographic\nprojection maps every quaterbit onto a quaternion number whose complex and\nquaternionic parts are related to Schmidt and concurrence terms respectively.\nRather, the same relation is established for three-qubit state under\n\\emph{octonionic} stereographic projection which means that if the state is\nbi-separable then, quaternionic and octonionic terms vanish. Finally, we\ngeneralize recent consequences to $2 \\otimes N$ and $4\\otimes N$ dimensional\nHilbert spaces ($N\\geq 2$) and show that, after stereographic projection, the\nquaternionic and octonionic terms are entanglement sensitive. These trends are\neasily confirmed by direct computation for general multi-particle W- and\nGHZ-states.\n", "  Muon-neutrino elastic scattering on electrons is an observable neutrino\nprocess whose cross section is precisely known. Consequently a measurement of\nthis process in an accelerator-based $\\nu_\\mu$ beam can improve the knowledge\nof the absolute neutrino flux impinging upon the detector; typically this\nknowledge is limited to $\\sim$ 10% due to uncertainties in hadron production\nand focusing. We have isolated a sample of 135 $\\pm$ 17 neutrino-electron\nelastic scattering candidates in the segmented scintillator detector of\nMINERvA, after subtracting backgrounds and correcting for efficiency. We show\nhow this sample can be used to reduce the total uncertainty on the NuMI\n$\\nu_\\mu$ flux from 9% to 6%. Our measurement provides a flux constraint that\nis useful to other experiments using the NuMI beam, and this technique is\napplicable to future neutrino beams operating at multi-GeV energies.\n", "  We study CKT (or bi-HKT) N = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanical sigma\nmodels. They are characterized by the usual and the mirror sectors displaying\neach HKT geometry. When the metric involves isometries, a Hamiltonian reduction\nis possible. The most natural such reduction with respect to a half of bosonic\ntarget space coordinates produces an N = 4 model, related to the twisted\nKaehler model due to Gates, Hull and Rocek, but including certain extra F-terms\nin the superfield action.\n", "  We present a theory for single- and two-phonon charge carrier scattering in\nanisotropic two-dimensional semiconductors applied to single-layer black\nphosphorus (BP). We show that in contrast to graphene, where two-phonon\nprocesses due to the scattering by flexural phonons dominate at any practically\nrelevant temperatures and are independent of the carrier concentration $n$,\ntwo-phonon scattering in BP is less important and can be considered negligible\nat $n\\gtrsim10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. At smaller $n$, however, phonons enter in the\nessentially anharmonic regime. Compared to the hole mobility, which does not\nexhibit strong anisotropy between the principal directions of BP\n($\\mu_{xx}/\\mu_{yy}\\sim1.4$ at $n=10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $T=300$ K), the\nelectron mobility is found to be significantly more anisotropic\n($\\mu_{xx}/\\mu_{yy}\\sim6.2$). Absolute values of $\\mu_{xx}$ do not exceed 250\n(700) cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ for holes (electrons), which can be considered as\nan upper limit for the mobility in BP at room temperature.\n", "  The iron K$\\alpha$ line commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of black hole\ncandidates is produced by X-ray fluorescence of the inner accretion disk. This\nline can potentially be quite a powerful tool to probe the spacetime geometry\naround these objects and test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In a previous\npaper, we studied the ability to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr\nsolution from the standard time-integrated iron line spectrum within the\nCardoso-Pani-Rico framework. In the present work, we expand on that study and\nconsider iron line reverberation mapping in the CPR framework. That is, we\nconsider the time-evolution of the iron line profile in response to\nfluctuations in the X-ray primary source. Our simulations clearly show that the\ntime information in reverberation mapping can better constrain the background\nmetric than the time-integrated approach, and this is true, notably, for the\ndeformation parameter $\\epsilon^r_3$, which is only weakly informed by a\ntime-integrated observation.\n", "  Encoding information in light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) enables\nnetworks to increase channel capacity significantly. However, light in only the\nfundamental Gaussian mode is suitable for fibre transmission, and not higher\norder Laguerre Gaussian modes, which carry OAM. Therefore, building a bridge to\ninterface light with OAM and Gaussian mode time-binning is crucially important.\nHere, we report the realization of a photonic space-time transcoder, by which\nlight with an arbitrary OAM superposition is experimentally converted into a\ntime-bin Gaussian pulse, and vice versa. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate\nthat coherence is well conserved and there is no cross-talk between orthogonal\nmodes. This photonic device is simple and can be built with scalable\narchitecture. Our experimental demonstration paves the way towards a mixed\noptical communication in free-space and optical fibre.\n", "  Using a sensitive statistical test we determine whether or not one can detect\nthe breakdown of linear response given observations of deterministic dynamical\nsystems. A goodness-of-fit statistics is developed for a linear statistical\nmodel of the observations, based on results on central limit theorems for\ndeterministic dynamical systems, and used to detect linear response breakdown.\nWe apply the method to discrete maps which do not obey linear response and show\nthat the successful detection of breakdown depends on the length of the time\nseries, the magnitude of the perturbation and on the choice of the observable.\n  We find that in order to reliably reject the assumption of linear response\nfor typical observables sufficiently large data sets are needed. Even for\nsimple systems such as the logistic map, one needs of the order of $10^6$\nobservations to reliably detect the breakdown, if less observations are\navailable one may be falsely led to conclude that linear response theory is\nvalid. The amount of data required is larger the smaller the applied\nperturbation. For judiciously chosen observables the necessary amount of data\ncan be drastically reduced, but requires detailed {\\em{a priori}} knowledge\nabout the invariant measure which is typically not available for complex\ndynamical systems.\n  Furthermore we explore the use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)\nin cases with limited data length or coarse-graining of observations. The FDT,\nif applied naively to a system without linear response, is shown to be very\nsensitive to the details of the sampling method, resulting in erroneous\npredictions of the response.\n", "  Thermoelectric properties of a model Skyrmion crystal were theoretically\ninvestigated, and it was found that its large anomalous Hall conductivity,\ncorresponding to large Chern numbers induced by its peculiar spin structure\nleads to a large transverse thermoelectric voltage through the anomalous Nernst\neffect. This implies the possibility of finding good thermoelectric materials\namong Skyrmion systems, and thus motivates our quests for them by means of the\nfirst-principles calculations as were employed here.\n", "  A measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry A[FB] of oppositely charged\nlepton pairs (mu mu and e e) produced via Z/gamma* boson exchange in pp\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC. The measurement of A[FB] is performed for dilepton masses\nbetween 40 GeV and 2 TeV and for dilepton rapidity up to 5. The A[FB]\nmeasurements as a function of dilepton mass and rapidity are compared with the\nstandard model predictions.\n", "  After an overview of variational principles for discrete gravity, and on the\nbasis of the approach to conformal transformations in a simplicial PL setting\nproposed by Luo and Glickenstein, we present at a heuristic level an improved\nscheme for addressing the gravitational (Euclidean) path integral and\ngeometrodynamics.\n", "  We report synthesis of under doped non-superconducting parent compound of\niron chalcogenide, i.e FeTe1-xSex (x=0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) single crystals by\nflux free method. These FeTe1-xSex (x=0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) single crystals\nare crystallized in the tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm at room\ntemperature. Detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that\nthe crystals are formed in slab-like morphology structure. Powder X-Ray\ndiffraction (XRD) results show that (0 0 l) peaks are shifted towards higher\nangel with increasing Se concentration. Coupled magnetic and structural phase\ntransition temperature, being seen as a step in resistivity, decreases from\naround 67K for x = 0.0 to 55K for x = 0.05 crystal. Further, the step in\nresistivity is seen to be hysteric ({\\Delta}T) in nature, i.e., different step\ntemperatures in cooling and warming cycles. Interestingly, the hysteric\n({\\Delta}T) becomes narrower from around 5.8K for x =0.0 to 0.95K for x =0.05\ncrystal.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been extensively studied\nin various systems. However, it is not easy to observe in superconducting\nquantum circuits (SQCs), because the Rabi frequency of the strong controlling\nfield corresponding to EIT is limited by the decay rates of the SQCs. Here, we\nshow that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting\ncircuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such\na driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are\napproximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates\nof the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit\nstates. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and\nso-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the\nqubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving\nfield, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed. We\nchoose a three-level system with $\\Lambda$-type transitions in such a driven\ncircuit QED system, and demonstrate how EIT and ATS can be realized in this\ncompound system. We believe that this study will be helpful for EIT experiments\nusing SQCs.\n", "  The influence of initial position on the acceleration of externally-injected\nelectrons in a plasma wakefield is investigated. Test-particle simulations show\npreviously unobserved complex structure in the parameter space, with\nquasi-stable injection channels forming for particles injected in narrow\nregions away from the wake centre. Particles injected into these channels\nremain in the wake for a considerable time after dephasing, and as a result\nachieve significantly higher energy than their neighbours. The result is\nrelevant to both the planning and optimisation of experiments making use of\nexternal injection.\n", "  In the last years the possibility of creating and manipulating quantum states\nof light has paved the way to the development of new technologies exploiting\npeculiar properties of quantum states, as quantum information, quantum\nmetrology & sensing, quantum imaging ...\n  In particular Quantum Imaging addresses the possibility of overcoming limits\nof classical optics by using quantum resources as entanglement or\nsub-poissonian statistics. Albeit quantum imaging is a more recent field than\nother quantum technologies, e.g. quantum information, it is now substantially\nmature for application. Several different protocols have been proposed, some of\nthem only theoretically, others with an experimental implementation and a few\nof them pointing to a clear application. Here we present a few of the most\nmature protocols ranging from ghost imaging to sub shot noise imaging and sub\nRayleigh imaging.\n", "  In the present paper we report the discovery of a new hot Jupiter,\nEPIC211089792 b, first detected by the Super-WASP observatory and then by the\nK2 space mission during its campaign 4. The planet has a period of 3.25d, a\nmass of 0.73 +/- 0.04 Mjup, and a radius of 1.19 +/- 0.02 Rjup. The host star\nis a relatively bright (V=12.5) G7 dwarf with a nearby K5V companion. Based on\nstellar rotation and the abundance of Lithium, we find that the system might be\nas young as about 450 Myr. The observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect\nshows the planet is aligned with respect to the stellar spin. Given the deep\ntransit (20mmag), the magnitude of the star and the presence of a nearby\nstellar companion, the planet is a good target for both space- and ground-based\ntransmission spectroscopy, in particular in the near-infrared where the both\nstars are relatively bright.\n", "  We consider portal models which are ultraweakly coupled with the Standard\nModel, and confront them with observational constraints on dark matter\nabundance and isocurvature perturbations. We assume the hidden sector to\ncontain a real singlet scalar $s$ and a sterile neutrino $\\psi$ coupled to $s$\nvia a pseudoscalar Yukawa term. During inflation, a primordial condensate\nconsisting of the singlet scalar $s$ is generated, and its contribution to the\nisocurvature perturbations is imprinted onto the dark matter abundance. We\ncompute the total dark matter abundance including the contributions from\ncondensate decay and nonthermal production from the Standard Model sector. We\nthen use the Planck limit on isocurvature perturbations to derive a novel\nconstraint connecting dark matter mass and the singlet self coupling with the\nscale of inflation: $m_{\\rm DM}/{\\rm GeV}\\lesssim 0.2\\lambda_{\\rm\ns}^{\\scriptscriptstyle 3/8} \\left(H_*/10^{\\scriptscriptstyle 11}{\\rm\nGeV}\\right)^{\\scriptscriptstyle -3/2}$. This constraint is relevant in most\nportal models ultraweakly coupled with the Standard Model and containing light\nsinglet scalar fields.\n", "  We present a methodology for the construction of parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) designed to provide an accurate representation of PDF\nuncertainties for specific processes or classes of processes with a minimal\nnumber of PDF error sets: specialized minimal PDF sets, or SM-PDFs. We\nconstruct these SM-PDFs in such a way that sets corresponding to different\ninput processes can be combined without losing information, specifically on\ntheir correlations, and that they are robust upon smooth variations of the\nkinematic cuts. The proposed strategy never discards information, so that the\nSM-PDF sets can be enlarged by the addition of new processes, until the prior\nPDF set is eventually recovered for a large enough set of processes. We\nillustrate the method by producing SM-PDFs tailored to Higgs, top quark pair,\nand electroweak gauge boson physics, and determine that, when the PDF4LHC15\ncombined set is used as the prior, around 11, 4 and 11 Hessian eigenvectors\nrespectively are enough to fully describe the corresponding processes.\n", "  A Brownian harmonic oscillator, which dissipates energy either by friction or\nvia emission of electromagnetic radiation, is considered. This Brownian emitter\nis driven by the surrounding thermo-quantum fluctuations, which are\ntheoretically described by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It is shown how\nthe AbrahamLorentz force leads to dependence of the half-width on the peak\nfrequency of the oscillator amplitude spectral density. It is also found that\nfor the case of a charged particle, moving in vacuum at zero temperature, its\nroot-mean-square velocity fluctuation is a universal constant, equal to roughly\n1/18 of the speed of light. The relevant Klein-Kramers and Smoluchowski\nequations are derived as well.\n", "  Women are dramatically underrepresented in computer science at all levels in\nacademia and account for just 15% of tenure-track faculty. Understanding the\ncauses of this gender imbalance would inform both policies intended to rectify\nit and employment decisions by departments and individuals. Progress in this\ndirection, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature\nof faculty hiring and the non-independence of hires. Using comprehensive data\non both hiring outcomes and scholarly productivity for 2659 tenure-track\nfaculty across 205 Ph.D.-granting departments in North America, we investigate\nthe multi-dimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty\nhiring through a network model of the hiring process. Overall, we find that\nhiring outcomes are most directly affected by (i) the relative prestige between\nhiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the\ncandidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender\ndid not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do\nexist, e.g., in scholarly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in\ncareer movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects\nof gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender's\ncovariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments\nrecruit female faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit\nsimilar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the\nsubtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new\ninsights to the underrepresentation of women in computer science.\n", "  Contrary to classical predictions, the optical response of few-nm plasmonic\nparticles depends on particle size due to effects such as nonlocality and\nelectron spill-out. Ensembles of such nanoparticles (NPs) are therefore\nexpected to exhibit a nonclassical inhomogeneous spectral broadening due to\nsize distribution. For a normal distribution of free-electron NPs, and within\nthe simple nonlocal Hydrodynamic Drude Model (HDM), both the nonlocal blueshift\nand the plasmon linewidth are shown to be considerably affected by ensemble\naveraging. Size-variance effects tend however to conceal nonlocality to a\nlesser extent when the homogeneous size-dependent broadening of individual NPs\nis taken into account, either through a local size-dependent damping (SDD)\nmodel or through the Generalized Nonlocal Optical Response (GNOR) theory. The\nrole of ensemble averaging is further explored in realistic distributions of\nnoble-metal NPs, as encountered in experiments, while an analytical expression\nto evaluate the importance of inhomogeneous broadening through measurable\nquantities is developed. Our findings are independent of the specific\nnonclassical theory used, thus providing important insight into a large range\nof experiments on nanoscale and quantum plasmonics.\n", "  We numerically study the quantum phase transitions and the stability of\nMajorana zero modes in a generalized Kitaev model in one dimension when the\nchemical potential is periodically modulating in space. By using the exact\ndiagonalization method for open boundary condition, we investigate the\nground-state phases in terms of the non-local properties such as the\nentanglement spectrum (ES) and the string correlation functions. When we vary\nthe phase of the modulation, the number of the Majorana zero modes changes,\nwhich manifests itself in the degeneracy of the lowest level of the ES. Next,\nwe study the quantum phase transitions driven by the change in the amplitude of\nthe modulation. In particular, for certain values of the wave number and the\nphase of the modulation, we observe a quantum phase transition from one\ntopological phase into another where the string correlation function oscillates\nin space. We also show a case where the degeneracy of the ES does not change\neven for large enough amplitude of the modulation. Finally, we characterize the\nphases of the system with periodic boundary condition by the topological\ninvariant, which reflects the number of the zero-energy excitations.\n", "  The iterative methods to diagonalize matrices and many-body Hamiltonians can\nbe reformulated as flows of Hamiltonians towards diagonalization driven by\nunitary transformations that preserve the spectrum. After a comparative\noverview of the various types of discrete flows (Jacobi, QR-algorithm) and\ndifferential flows (Toda, Wegner, White) that have been introduced in the past,\nwe focus on the random XXZ chain with random fields in order to determine the\nbest closed flow within a given subspace of running Hamiltonians. For the\nspecial case of the free-fermion random XX chain with random fields, the flow\ncoincides with the Toda differential flow for tridiagonal matrices which is\nrelated to the classical integrable Toda chain and which can be seen as the\ncontinuous analog of the discrete QR-algorithm. For the random XXZ chain with\nrandom fields that displays a Many-Body-Localization transition, the present\ndifferential flow should be an interesting alternative to compare with the\ndiscrete flow that has been proposed recently to study the\nMany-Body-Localization properties in a model of interacting fermions (L.\nRademaker and M. Ortuno, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 010404 (2016)).\n", "  Using the Kubo linear-response formalism we derive expressions to calculate\nthe heat current generated by magnetization dynamics in magnets with broken\ninversion symmetry and spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The effect of producing\nheat currents by magnetization dynamics constitutes the Onsager reciprocal of\nthe thermal spin-orbit torque (TSOT), i.e., the generation of torques on the\nmagnetization due to temperature gradients. We find that the energy current\ndriven by magnetization dynamics contains a contribution from the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which needs to be subtracted from the\nKubo linear response of the energy current in order to extract the heat\ncurrent. We show that the expressions of the DMI coefficient can be derived\nelegantly from the DMI energy current. Guided by formal analogies between the\nBerry phase theory of DMI on the one hand and the modern theory of orbital\nmagnetization on the other hand we are led to an interpretation of the latter\nin terms of energy currents as well. Based on \\textit{ab-initio} calculations\nwe investigate the heat current driven by magnetization dynamics in Mn/W(001)\nmagnetic bilayers. We predict that fast domain walls drive strong ITSOT heat\ncurrents.\n", "  In the nucleon electroexcitation reactions, $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to R$, where $R$\nis a nucleon resonance ($N^\\ast$), the electric amplitude $E$, and the\nlongitudinal amplitude $S_{1/2}$, are related by $E \\propto \\frac{\\omega}{|{\\bf\nq}|}S_{1/2}$, at the pseudo-threshold limit ($|{\\bf q}| \\to 0$), where $\\omega$\nand $|{\\bf q}|$ are respectively the energy and the magnitude of three-momentum\nof the photon. The previous relation is usually refereed as the Siegert's\ntheorem. The form of the electric amplitude, defined in terms of the transverse\namplitudes $A_{1/2}$ and $A_{3/2}$, and the explicit coefficients of the\nrelation, depend on the angular momentum and parity ($J^P$) of the resonance\n$R$. The Siegert's theorem is the consequence of the structure of the\nelectromagnetic transition current, which induces constraints between the\nelectromagnetic form factors in the pseudo-threshold limit. In the present\nwork, we study the implications of the Siegert's theorem for the $\\gamma^\\ast N\n\\to \\Delta(1232)$ and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transitions. For the\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transition, in addition to the relation between\nelectric amplitude and longitudinal amplitude, we obtain also a relation\nbetween the two transverse amplitudes: $A_{1/2}= A_{3/2} /\\sqrt{3}$, at the\npseudo-threshold. % The constraints at the pseudo-threshold are tested for the\nMAID2007 parametrizations of the reactions under discussion. New\nparametrizations for the amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ and $S_{1/2}$, for the\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1232)$ and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1520)$ transitions,\nvalid for small and large $Q^2$, are proposed. The new parametrizations are\nconsistent with both: the pseudo-threshold constraints (Siegert's theorem) and\nthe empirical data.\n", "  We derive an analytical expression for the local two-particle vertex of the\nFalicov-Kimball model, including its dependence on all three frequencies, the\nfull vertex and all reducible vertices. This allows us to calculate the self\nenergy in diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean field theory, specifically\nin the dual fermion and the one-particle irreducible approach. Non-local\ncorrelations are thence included and originate here from charge density wave\nfluctuations. At low temperatures and in two dimensions, they lead to a larger\nself energy contribution at low frequencies and a more insulating spectrum.\n", "  We examine the superconducting solution in the Holstein model, where the\nconduction electrons couple to the dispersionless Boson fields, using the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory and Dynamical Mean Field Theory. Although different in\nnumerical values, both methods imply the existence of an optimal Boson energy\nfor superconductivity at a given electron-Boson coupling. This non-monotonous\nbehavior can be understood as an interplay between the polaron and\nsuperconducting physics, as the electron-Boson coupling is the origin of the\nsuperconductor, but at the same time traps the conduction electrons making the\nsystem more insulating. Our calculation provides a simple explanation on the\nrecent experiment on sulfur hydride (H$_2$S), where an optimal pressure for the\nsuperconductivity was observed. The validities of both methods are discussed.\n", "  Fabrication of highly ordered and dense nanofibers assemblies is of key\nimportance in designing high-performance and multi-functional materials. In\nthis work, we design an experimental approach in silico, combining shear flow\nand solvent evaporation to establish nanofiber alignment and densification of\nthe assemblies. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing\ndissipative particle dynamics simulations, where the hydrodynamic and thermal\nfluctuation effects are fully modeled. We find that the microstructural order\nof assembled nanofibers can be established within a specific range of the\nPeclet number and evaporation flux. The underlying mechanism is elucidated by\nconsidering the competition between hydrodynamic coupling and fluctuating\ndynamics of nanofibers. Based on these understandings, we outline a practical\nsetup to fabricate highly ordered and dense nanofiber assemblies.\n", "  Here we report the comparison of the upper critical fields of different\nsuperconductors being calculated by two different theories i.e., Werthamer\nHelfand Hohenburg (WHH) and Ginzberg Landau (GL). All the samples are\nsynthesized through previously known solid state reaction route. Phase purity\nis determined from the Rietveld refinement of powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD)\ndata. High field (up to 14Tesla) magneto transport \\r{ho}(T)H of different\nsuperconductors is studied to estimate their upper critical field (Hc2). The\npresent inter comparison covers from Cuprates (YBa2Cu3O7) - Borides (MgB2) - Fe\npnictides (NdFeAsO0.8F0.2) and chalcogenides (FeSe0.5Te0.5) to robust Nb2PdS5.\nThe upper critical fields [Hc2(T)] at zero temperature are calculated by\nextrapolating the data using GL and WHH equations.\n", "  Aims. The black hole binary SWIFT J1753.5-0127 is providing a unique data set\nto study accretion flows. Various investigations of this system and of other\nblack holes have not, however, led to an agreement on the accretion flow\ngeometry or on the seed photon source for Comptonization during different\nstages of X-ray outbursts. We place constraints on these accretion flow\nproperties by studying long-term spectral variations of this source. Methods.\nWe performed phenomenological and self-consistent broad band spectral modeling\nof Swift J1753.5-0127 using quasi-simultaneous archived data from\nINTEGRAL/ISGRI, Swift/UVOT/XRT/BAT, RXTE/PCA/HEXTE and MAXI/GSC instruments.\nResults. We identify a critical flux limit, F \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\nerg/cm^2/s, and show that the spectral properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are\nmarkedly different above and below this value. Above the limit, during the\noutburst peak, the hot medium seems to intercept roughly 50 percent of the disk\nemission. Below it, in the outburst tail, the contribution of the disk photons\nreduces significantly and the entire spectrum from the optical to X-rays can be\nproduced by a synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. The long-term variations in\nthe hard X-ray spectra are caused by erratic changes of the electron\ntemperatures in the hot medium. Thermal Comptonization models indicate\nunreasonably low hot medium optical depths during the short incursions into the\nsoft state after 2010, suggesting that non-thermal electrons produce the\nComptonized tail in this state. The soft X-ray excess, likely produced by the\naccretion disk, shows peculiarly stable temperatures for over an order of\nmagnitude changes in flux. Conclusions. The long-term spectral trends of SWIFT\nJ1753.5-0127 are likely set by variations of the truncation radius and a\nformation of a hot, quasi-spherical inner flow in the vicinity of the black\nhole. (abridged)\n", "  We study the turbulent regime of chiral (magneto)hydrodynamics for charged\nand neutral matter with chirality imbalance. We find that the chiral\nmagnetohydrodynamics for charged plasmas possesses a unique scaling symmetry,\nonly without fluid helicity under the local charge neutrality. We also find a\ndifferent type of unique scaling symmetry in the chiral hydrodynamics for\nneutral matter with fluid helicity in the inertial range. We show that these\nsymmetries dictate the self-similar inverse cascade of the magnetic and kinetic\nenergies. Our results imply the possible inverse energy cascade in\ncore-collapse supernovae due to the chiral transport of neutrinos.\n", "  Given a non-semisimple automorphism $\\varphi$ of a vertex algebra $V$, the\nfields in a $\\varphi$-twisted $V$-module involve the logarithm of the formal\nvariable, and the action of the Virasoro operator $L_0$ on such module is not\nsemisimple. We construct examples of such modules and realize them explicitly\nas Fock spaces when $V$ is generated by free fields. Specifically, we consider\nthe cases of symplectic fermions (odd superbosons), free fermions, and\n$\\beta\\gamma$-system (even superfermions). In each case, we determine the\naction of the Virasoro algebra.\n", "  Attempts to modify gravity in the infrared typically require a screening\nmechanism to ensure consistency with local tests of gravity. These screening\nmechanisms fit into three broad classes; we investigate theories which are\ncapable of exhibiting more than one type of screening. Specifically, we focus\non a simple model which exhibits both Vainshtein and kinetic screening. We\npoint out that due to the two characteristic length scales in the problem, the\ntype of screening that dominates depends on the mass of the sourcing object,\nallowing for different phenomenology at different scales. We consider embedding\nthis double screening phenomenology in a broader cosmological scenario and show\nthat the simplest examples that exhibit double screening are radiatively\nstable.\n", "  Results of a search for new phenomena in events with an energetic photon and\nlarge missing transverse momentum with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider are reported. The data were collected in proton--proton collisions at\na centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of\n3.2 $\\rm fb^{-1}$. The observed data are in agreement with the Standard Model\nexpectations. Exclusion limits are presented in models of new phenomena\nincluding pair production of dark matter candidates or large extra spatial\ndimensions. In a simplified model of dark matter and an axial-vector mediator,\nthe search excludes mediator masses of up to 710 GeV for dark matter candidate\nmasses up to 150 GeV. In an effective theory of dark matter production, values\nof the suppression scale $M_*$ up to 570 GeV are excluded and the effect of\ntruncation for various coupling values is reported. For the ADD large extra\nspatial dimension model the search places more stringent limits than earlier\nsearches in the same event topology, excluding $M_{\\rm D}$ up to about 2.3\n(2.8) TeV for two (six) additional spatial dimensions; the limits are reduced\nby 20--40% depending on the number of additional spatial dimensions when\napplying a truncation procedure.\n", "  We combined multi-wavelength data for blazars from the Roma-BZCAT catalog and\nanalyzed hundreds of X-ray spectra. We present the fluxes and Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs), in 12 frequency bands from radio to $\\gamma$-rays, for a\nfinal sample of 2214 blazars. Using a model-independent statistical approach,\nwe looked for systematic trends in the SEDs; the most significant trends\ninvolved the radio luminosities and X-ray spectral indices of the blazars. We\nused a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to determine the basis vectors of\nthe blazar SEDs and, in order to maximize the size of the sample, imputed\nmissing fluxes using the K-nearest neighbors method. Using more than an order\nof magnitude more data than was available when Fossati et al. (1997, 1998)\nfirst reported trends of SED shape with blazar luminosity, we confirmed the\nanti-correlation between radio luminosity and synchrotron peak frequency,\nalthough with greater scatter than was seen in the smaller sample. The same\ntrend can be seen between bolometric luminosity and synchrotron peak frequency.\nFinally, we used all available blazar data to determine an empirical SED\ndescription that depends only on the radio luminosity at 1.4~GHz and the\nredshift. We verified that this statistically significant relation was not a\nresult of the luminosity-luminosity correlations that are natural in\nflux-limited samples (i.e., where the correlation is actually caused by the\nredshift rather than the luminosity).\n", "  The production of $Z$ bosons with one or two isolated high-energy photons is\nstudied using $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV. The analyses use a data\nsample with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS\ndetector during the 2012 LHC data taking. The $Z\\gamma$ and $Z\\gamma\\gamma$\nproduction cross sections are measured with leptonic ($e^{+}e^{-}$,\n$\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$, $\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$) decays of the $Z$ boson, in extended fiducial\nregions defined in terms of the lepton and photon acceptance. They are then\ncompared to cross-section predictions from the Standard Model, where the\nsources of the photons are radiation off initial-state quarks and radiative\n$Z$-boson decay to charged leptons, and from fragmentation of final-state\nquarks and gluons into photons. The yields of events with photon transverse\nenergy $E_T >$ 250 GeV from $\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}\\gamma$ events and with $E_T >$\n400 GeV from $\\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ events are used to search for anomalous\ntriple gauge-boson couplings $ZZ\\gamma$ and $Z\\gamma\\gamma$. The yields of\nevents with diphoton invariant mass $m_{\\gamma\\gamma} >$ 200 GeV from\n$\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}\\gamma\\gamma$ events and with $m_{\\gamma\\gamma} > $ 300 GeV\nfrom $\\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma\\gamma$ events are used to search for anomalous quartic\ngauge-boson couplings $ZZ\\gamma\\gamma$ and $Z\\gamma\\gamma\\gamma$. No deviations\nfrom Standard Model predictions are observed and limits are placed on\nparameters used to describe anomalous triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings.\n", "  A search for narrow resonances decaying to an electron and a muon is\npresented. The e-mu mass spectrum is also investigated for non-resonant\ncontributions from the production of quantum black holes (QBHs). The analysis\nis performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\ninverse femtobarns collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. With no evidence for physics\nbeyond the standard model in the invariant mass spectrum of selected e-mu\npairs, upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the product of cross\nsection and branching fraction for signals arising in theories with charged\nlepton flavour violation. In the search for narrow resonances, the resonant\nproduction of a tau sneutrino in R-parity violating supersymmetry is\nconsidered. The tau sneutrino is excluded for masses below 1.28 TeV for\ncouplings lambda[132] = lambda[231] = lambda'[311] = 0.01, and below 2.30 TeV\nfor lambda[132] = lambda[231] = 0.07 and lambda'[311] = 0.11. These are the\nmost stringent limits to date from direct searches at high-energy colliders. In\naddition, the resonance searches are interpreted in terms of a model with heavy\npartners of the Z boson and the photon. In a framework of TeV-scale quantum\ngravity based on a renormalization of Newton's constant, the search for\nnon-resonant contributions to the e-mu mass spectrum excludes QBH production\nbelow a threshold mass M[th] of 1.99 TeV. In models that invoke extra\ndimensions, the bounds range from 2.36 TeV for one extra dimension to 3.63 TeV\nfor six extra dimensions. This is the first search for QBHs decaying into the\ne-mu final state.\n", "  We give explicit analytical expressions for the partition function of\n$U(N)_{k}\\times U(N+M)_{-k}$ ABJ theory at weak coupling ($k\\rightarrow \\infty\n)$ for finite and arbitrary values of $N$ and $M$ (including the ABJM case and\nits mass-deformed generalization). We obtain the expressions by identifying the\none-matrix model formulation with a Meixner-Pollaczek ensemble and using the\ncorresponding orthogonal polynomials, which are also eigenfunctions of a\n$su(1,1)$ quantum oscillator. Wilson loops in mass-deformed ABJM are also\nstudied in the same limit and interpreted in terms of $su(1,1)$ coherent\nstates.\n", "  We employ a novel fluid-particle model to study the shearing behavior of\ngranular soils under different saturation levels, ranging from the dry material\nvia the capillary bridge regime to higher saturation levels with percolating\nclusters. The full complexity of possible liquid morphologies is taken into\naccount, implying the formation of isolated arbitrary-sized liquid clusters\nwith individual Laplace pressures that evolve by liquid exchange via films on\nthe grain surface. Liquid clusters can grow in size, shrink, merge and split,\ndepending on local conditions, changes of accessible liquid and the pore space\nmorphology determined by the granular phase. This phase is represented by a\ndiscrete particle model based on Contact Dynamics, where capillary forces\nexerted from a liquid phase add to the motion of spherical particles. We study\nthe macroscopic response of the system due to an external compression force at\nvarious liquid contents with the help of triaxial shear tests. Additionally,\nthe change in liquid cluster distributions during the compression due to the\ndeformation of the pore space is evaluated close to the critical load.\n", "  The fermi paradox uses an appeal to the mediocrity principle to make it seem\ncounter-intuitive that humanity has not been contacted by extraterrestrial\nintelligence. A numerical, statistical analysis was conducted to determine\nwhether this apparent loneliness is, in fact, unexpected. An inequality was\nderived to relate the frequency of life arising and developing technology on a\nsuitable planet in the galaxy, the average length of time since the first\nbroadcast of such a civilization, and a constant term. An analysis of the\nsphere reached thus far by human communication was also conducted, considering\nour local neighborhood and planets of particular interest. We clearly show that\nhuman communication has not reached a number of stars and planets adequate to\nexpect an answer. These analyses both conclude that the Fermi paradox is not,\nin fact, unexpected. By the mediocrity principle and numerical modeling, it is\nactually unlikely that the Earth would have been reached by extraterrestrial\ncommunication at this point. We predict that under 1 percent of the galaxy has\nbeen reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until\napproximately half of the stars/planets have been reached. We offer a\nprediction that we should not expect this until at least 1,500 years in the\nfuture. Thus the Fermi paradox is not a shocking observation, and humanity may\nvery well be contacted within our species' lifespan.\n", "  We present a symmetry-based approach for prolate-oblate and\nspherical-prolate-oblate shape coexistence, in the framework of the interacting\nboson model of nuclei. The proposed Hamiltonian conserves the SU(3) and\n$\\overline{\\rm SU(3)}$ symmetry for the prolate and oblate ground bands and the\nU(5) symmetry for selected spherical states. Analytic expressions for\nquadrupole moments and $E2$ rates involving these states are derived and\nisomeric states are identified by means of selection rules.\n", "  Using a new geometrical method introduced by Werner, we find the deflection\nangle in the weak limit approximation by a spinning cosmic string in the\ncontext of the Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory of gravity. We begin by adopting the\nString-Randers optical metric, then we apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to the\noptical geometry and derive the leading terms of the deflection angle in the\nequatorial plane. Calculations shows that light deflection is affected by the\nintrinsic spin of the cosmic string and torsion.\n", "  Markov random fields (MRFs) have been widely used as prior models in various\ninverse problems such as tomographic reconstruction. While MRFs provide a\nsimple and often effective way to model the spatial dependencies in images,\nthey suffer from the fact that parameter estimation is difficult. In practice,\nthis means that MRFs typically have very simple structure that cannot\ncompletely capture the subtle characteristics of complex images.\n  In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian mixture Markov random field model\n(GM-MRF) that can be used as a very expressive prior model for inverse problems\nsuch as denoising and reconstruction. The GM-MRF forms a global image model by\nmerging together individual Gaussian-mixture models (GMMs) for image patches.\nIn addition, we present a novel analytical framework for computing MAP\nestimates using the GM-MRF prior model through the construction of surrogate\nfunctions that result in a sequence of quadratic optimizations. We also\nintroduce a simple but effective method to adjust the GM-MRF so as to control\nthe sharpness in low- and high-contrast regions of the reconstruction\nseparately. We demonstrate the value of the model with experiments including\nimage denoising and low-dose CT reconstruction.\n", "  A slab with relative permittivity $\\epsilon = - 1 + i\\delta$ and permeability\n$\\mu = - 1 + i\\delta $ has a critical distance away from the slab where a small\nparticle will either be cloaked or imaged depending on whether it is located\ninside or outside that critical distance. We find that the optical force acting\non a small cylinder under plane wave illumination reaches a maximum value at\nthis critical distance. Contrary to the usual observation that superlens\nsystems should be highly loss-sensitive, this maximum optical force remains a\nconstant when loss is changed within a certain range. For a fixed particle-slab\ndistance, increasing loss can even amplify the optical force acting on the\nsmall cylinder, contrary to the usual belief that loss compromises the response\nof supenlens.\n", "  Samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$), a well-known Kondo insulator in which the\ninsulating bulk arises from strong electron correlations, has recently\nattracted great attention owing to increasing evidence for its topological\nnature, thereby harboring protected surface states. However, corroborative\nspectroscopic evidence is still lacking, unlike in the weakly correlated\ncounterparts, including Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Here we report results from planar\ntunneling that unveil the detailed spectroscopic properties of SmB$_6$. The\ntunneling conductance obtained on the (001) and (011) single crystal surfaces\nreveal linear density of states as expected for two and one Dirac cone(s),\nrespectively. Quite remarkably, it is found that these topological states are\nnot protected completely within the bulk hybridization gap. A phenomenological\nmodel of the tunneling process invoking interaction of the surface states with\nbulk excitations (spin excitons), as predicted by a recent theory, provides a\nconsistent explanation for all of the observed features. Our spectroscopic\nstudy supports and explains the proposed picture of the incompletely protected\nsurface states in this topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$.\n", "  A numerical method to efficiently solve for mixing and reaction of scalars in\na two-dimensional flow field at large P\\'eclet numbers but otherwise arbitrary\nDamk\\\"ohler numbers is reported. We consider a strip of one reactant in a pool\nof another reactant, both of which are advected with the known velocity field.\nWe first establish that the system evolution for such a system under certain\nconditions is described by a locally one-dimensional reaction-diffusion\nproblem. The approximation of a locally one-dimensional dynamics is true for\ncases where the strip thickness is smaller than the local radius of curvature\nand also when the strip thickness is smaller than the distance between adjacent\nstrips. We first demonstrate the method for the transport of a conservative\nscalar under a linear shear flow, point vortex and a chaotic sine flow. We then\nproceed to consider the situation with a simple bimolecular reaction between\ntwo reactants to yield a single product. The methodology presented herewith\nessentially generalizes nontrivially the Diffusive Strip Method developed by\nMeunier and Villermaux (J. Fluid Mech. 662, 134-172 (2010)) to address passive\nscalar transport, to the generalized situation with multiple reacting species.\nIn essence, the reduction of dimensionality of the problem, which renders the\n2D problem 1D, allows one to efficiently model reactive transport under high\nP\\'eclet numbers which are otherwise prohibitively difficult to resolve from\nclassical finite difference or finite element based methods.\n", "  We consider a system of two particles in noncommutative space which is\nrotationally invariant. It is shown that the coordinates of the center-of-mass\nposition and the coordinates of relative motion satisfy noncommutative algebra\nwith corresponding effective tensors of noncommutativity. The hydrogen atom is\nstudied as a two-particle system. We find the corrections to the energy levels\nof the hydrogen atom up to the second order over the parameter of\nnoncommutativity.\n", "  Up-conversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) are a new class of nonlinear optical\nmaterials converting low energy excitation to high energy emission. Recent\nadvances in synthesis techniques enable a control over size, shape, emission\ncolor purity as well as optical tuning [1]. Those UCNCs are characterized by\nhigh surface to volume ratio allowing interesting attributes such as water\nsolubility and biological functionality. UCNCs usually consist of an inorganic\nhost that is doped with Ln^{3+} ions. The most efficient host matrix known is\nthe one used to test our model, namely, NaGdF_4 nanocrystals co-doped with\nEr^{3+} as an acceptor/activator and Yb^{3+} as a donor/sensitizer. In this\nwork, we introduce the theoretical background needed to understand the nature\nof ion-ion interactions occurring in these systems as well as the details of\nthe 4f transitions characteristic of RE-ions. In the second chapter, we present\nour model through a system of rate equations corresponding to a custom energy\ndiagram. Then, we show our simulations producing fits of Time Resolved Photo\nLuminescence (TRPL) data. Finally, we construct an improved model aiming to\nencompass all the processes that seem to be involved in the luminescence of the\nsamples studied and we present the achievements of such approach.\n", "  We rigorously investigated the charge-charge correlation function of the\nionic Hubbard model in two dimensions by reflection positivity. We prove the\nexistence of charge-density waves for large staggered potential $\\Delta$ (i.e.,\n$\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+2V>U$) at low temperatures, where $U$ and $V$ are the on-site\nand nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. The results are\nconsistent with previous numerical simulation results. We argue that the\nabsence of charge-density waves for $\\Delta=0$ and $U$ are large enough (i.e.,\n$U>\\frac{\\Delta}{2}$+2V).\n", "  Anomalous relaxation and diffusion processes have been widely characterized\nby fractional derivative models, where the definition of the fractional-order\nderivative remains a historical debate due to the singular memory kernel that\nchallenges numerical calculations. This study first explores physical\nproperties of relaxation and diffusion models where the fractional derivative\nwas defined recently using an exponential kernel. Analytical analysis shows\nthat the fractional derivative model with an exponential kernel cannot\ncharacterize non-exponential dynamics well-documented in anomalous relaxation\nand diffusion. A legitimate extension of the previous fractional derivative is\nthen proposed by replacing the exponential kernel with a stretched exponential\nkernel. Numerical tests show that the fractional derivative model with the\nstretched exponential kernel can describe a much wider range of anomalous\ndiffusion than the exponential kernel, implying the potential applicability of\nthe new fractional derivative in quantifying real-world, anomalous relaxation\nand diffusion processes.\n", "  In this study, the possible deformation of a single Carbon Nanotube (CNT) ply\nsubjected to a pulsed magnetic field was investigated. In all tests the\ncapacitor bank was charged to 6kJ of energy. A Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV)\nsystem was used to measure velocity or displacement of the CNT ply during the\nexperiments. The resistance of the CNT ply was measured using four-point probe\ntechnique before and after the experiments. Preliminary results show that the\nsingle CNT plies do not permanently deform in response to the pulsed magnetic\nfields. However, they can be displaced, either by themselves a small amount\n(0.6mm) or by a large amount using a driver material. Also, the resistance of\nthe CNT plies may increase or decrease depends on the lay-out (i.e., yarn) and\ncurrent flow directions.\n", "  Time use surveys in Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy and United Kingdom\nare analyzed to provide start, noon and end times for the main activities of a\nsociety: labor (the focus of this preprint), sleeping and eating. Also, the\nlocation at home is analyzed. Local times are converted into mean solar times\nand compared to latitude. Observed trends allow to unveil the winter day as a\nrestriction for the human activity. Alternatively, apparently large time\ndifferences set forth by clocks, becomes smaller when observed as a time\ndistance to winter sunrise or sunset.\n", "  We propose a new method to reconstruct data acquired in a local tomography\nsetup. This method uses an initial reconstruction and refines it by correcting\nthe low frequency artifacts known as the cupping effect. A basis of Gaussian\nfunctions is used to correct the initial reconstruction. The coefficients of\nthis basis are iteratively optimized under the constraint of a known subregion.\nUsing a coarse basis reduces the degrees of freedom of the problem while\nactually correcting the cupping effect. Simulations show that the known region\nconstraint yields an unbiased reconstruction, in accordance to uniqueness\ntheorems stated in local tomography.\n", "  The gauge/gravity duality conjecture claims the equivalence between gauge\ntheory and superstring/M-theory. In particular, the one-dimensional gauge\ntheory of D0-branes and type IIA string theory should agree on properties of\nhot black holes. Type IIA superstring theory predicts the leading $N^2$\nbehavior of the black hole internal energy to be $E/N^2=a_0T^{14/5}+\na_1T^{23/5}+a_2T^{29/5}+\\cdots$ with the supergravity prediction $a_0=7.41$ and\nunknown coefficients $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$ associated with stringy\ncorrections. In order to test this duality we perform a lattice study of the\ngauge theory and extract a continuum, large-$N$ value of $a_0=7.4\\pm 0.5$---the\nfirst direct confirmation of the supergravity prediction at finite\ntemperature---and constrain the stringy corrections ($a_1=-9.7\\pm2.2$ and\n$a_2=5.6\\pm1.8$). We also study the sub-leading $1/N^2$ corrections to the\ninternal energy.\n", "  We extend our previous study of the cool gas responsible for the emission of\nOVII X-ray lines in the cores of clusters and groups of galaxies. This is the\ncoolest X-ray emitting phase and connects the 10,000 K H {\\alpha} emitting gas\nto the million degree phase, providing a useful tool to understand cooling in\nthese objects. We study the location of the O VII gas and its connection to the\nintermediate Fe XVII and hotter O VIII phases. We use high-resolution X-ray\ngrating spectra of elliptical galaxies with strong Fe XVII line emission and\ndetect O VII in 11 of 24 objects. Comparing the O VII detection level and\nresonant scattering, which is sensitive to turbulence and temperature, suggests\nthat OVII is preferably found in cooler objects, where the FeXVII resonant line\nis suppressed due to resonant scattering, indicating subsonic turbulence.\nAlthough a larger sample of sources and further observations is needed to\ndistinguish between effects from temperature and turbulence, our results are\nconsistent with cooling being suppressed at high turbulence as predicted by\nmodels of AGN feedback, gas sloshing and galactic mergers. In some objects the\nOVII resonant-to-forbidden line ratio is decreased by either resonant\nscattering or charge-exchange boosting the forbidden line, as we show for NGC\n4636. Charge-exchange indicates interaction between neutral and ionized gas\nphases. The Perseus cluster also shows a high Fe XVII forbidden-to- resonance\nline ratio, which can be explained with resonant scattering by low-turbulence\ncool gas in the line-of-sight.\n", "  In the present work we study the relationship between population allocation\nand the combined effects of urban size and energy consumption, for two given\nareas and through a major part of the twentieth century. Along these lines a\ngeneral application model is laid down which relates city-growth rates to\ninitial inhabitants and to exosomatic energy increment, the deviations from it\nshowing order in space and time; as shown in a series of maps which hint at\nunaccounted socioeconomic factors. The study of the maps by means of spectral\nanalysis allows finding patterns which reinforce over time, in such a manner\nthat spatial frequencies can be determined whose weight increases up so\ngranting surface evolution estimation.\n", "  Statistics of article page views is useful for measuring the impact of\nindividual articles. Analyzing the temporal evolution of article page views, we\nfind that article page views usually decay over time after reaching a peak,\nespecially exhibiting relaxation with nonexponentiality. This finding suggests\nthat relaxation in article page views resembles physical aging as frequently\nfound in complex systems.\n", "  The complex interactions between turbulence and the free surface, including\nair entrainment processes, in boundary layer shear flows created by vertical\nsurface-piercing plates are considered. A laboratory-scale device was built\nthat utilizes a surface-piercing stainless steel belt that travels in a loop\naround two vertical rollers, with one length of the belt between the rollers\nacting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. The belt is operated both as a\nsuddenly-started plate to reproduce boundary layer flow or at steady state in\nthe presence of a stationary flat plate positioned parallel to the belt to\ncreate a Couette flow with a free surface. Surface profiles are measured with a\ncinematic laser-induced fluorescence system in both experiments and air\nentrainment events and bubble motions are observed with stereo underwater\nwhite-light movies in the suddenly started belt experiment. It is found that\nthe RMS surface height fluctuations, $\\eta$, peak near the boundaries of the\nflows and increase approximately linearly with belt speed. In the Couette flow\nexperiments, a dominant peak in the spectrum of $\\partial\\eta/\\partial t$ is\nfound at the dimensionless frequency $fH/U\\approx 0.7$. In the suddenly started\nbelt experiment, surface fluctuations appear to be strongly influenced by\nsub-surface turbulence within the boundary layer, while ripples propagate\nfreely when farther from the belt. Additionally, some mechanisms for air\nentrainment are observed and comparisons are made to predictions of incipient\nentrainment conditions in Brocchini and Pregrine (J. Fluid Mech., 499, 225-254,\n2001).\n", "  Underwater sound isolation has been a long-standing fundamental issue in\nindustry and military fields. Starting from a simple theoretical model, here an\nair-sealed metasurface is proposed to overcome this problem. Comparing with the\nsample without filling air, the effective impedance of the air-sealed one is\ngreatly reduced and strikingly mismatch with water, accompanying another merit\nof low sound speed. Deeply suppressed sound transmission (~10-5) through such a\nmetasurface is observed experimentally over a wide range of ultrasonic\nfrequencies and incident angles.\n", "  Based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle, a metasurface structure is designed\nto generate a sound vortex beam in airborne environment. The metasurface is\nconstructed by a thin planar plate perforated with a circular array of deep\nsubwavelength resonators with desired phase and amplitude responses. The\nmetasurface approach in making sound vortices is validated well by full-wave\nsimulations and experimental measurements. Potential applications of such\nartificial spiral beams can be anticipated, as exemplified experimentally by\nthe torque effect exerting on an absorbing disk.\n", "  PAL-XFEL, a 4th generation light source, is currently being installed and\nwill be completed by December of 2015 so that users can be supported beginning\nin 2016. PAL-XFEL equipment should continuously maintain the bunch-to-bunch\nbeam parameter (60Hz, Energy 10GeV, Charge 200pC, Bunch Length 60fs, Emittance\nX/Y 0.481mm/0.256mm rad) in order to supply the energy, flux and timing of\nstable photons in tests by beam line users. To this end, PAL-XFEL equipment has\nto be kept precisely aligned (Linear Accelerator +/- 100um, Undulator +/-\n50um). As a part of the process for installing PAL-XFEL, a GPS-used surface\ngeodetic network is being constructed for precise equipment measurement and\nalignment, and the installation of a tunnel measurement network inside\nbuildings is in preparation; additionally, the fiducialization of major\nequipment is underway. After PAL-XFEL equipment is optimized and aligned, if\nthe ground and buildings go through vertical changes during operation,\nmisalignment (and tilt) of equipment including various magnets and RF\nstructures will cause errors in the electron beam trajectory, which will lead\nto changes to the beam parameter. For continuous and systemic measurement of\nvertical changes in buildings and to monitor ground sinking and uplifting, the\nBudker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) Ultrasonic-type Hydrostatic\nLevelling System (HLS) is to be installed and operated in all sections of\nPAL-XFEL for linear accelerator, insertion device (Undulator) and beam line.\nThis study will introduce the operation principle, design concept and\nadvantages (self-calibration) of HLS, and will outline its installation plan\nand operation plan.\n", "  Manipulating materials at the nanometer scale is challenging, particularly if\nalignment with nanoscale electrodes is desired. Here we describe a\nlithography-free, self-aligned nanotrench ablation (SANTA) technique to create\nnanoscale trenches in a polymer like poly(methyl) methacrylate (PMMA). The\nnanotrenches are self-aligned with carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene ribbon\nelectrodes through a simple Joule heating process. Using simulations and\nexperiments we investigate how the Joule power, ambient temperature, PMMA\nthickness, and substrate properties can improve the spatial resolution of this\ntechnique. We achieve sub-20 nm nanotrenches for the first time, by lowering\nthe ambient temperature and reducing the PMMA thickness. We also demonstrate a\nfunctioning nanoscale resistive memory (RRAM) bit self-aligned with a CNT\ncontrol device, achieved through the SANTA approach. This technique provides an\nelegant and inexpensive method to probe nanoscale devices using self-aligned\nelectrodes, without the use of conventional alignment or lithography steps.\n", "  A shear Alfv\\'en wave parametric instability is observed for the first time\nin the laboratory. When a single finite $\\omega/\\Omega_i$ kinetic Alfv\\'en wave\n(KAW) is launched in the Large Plasma Device above a threshold amplitude, three\ndaughter modes are produced. These daughter modes have frequencies and parallel\nwave numbers that are consistent with copropagating KAW sidebands and a low\nfrequency nonresonant mode. The observed process is parametric in nature, with\nthe frequency of the daughter modes varying as a function of pump wave\namplitude. The daughter modes are spatially localized on a gradient of the pump\nwave magnetic field amplitude in the plane perpendicular to the background\nfield, suggesting that perpendicular nonlinear forces (and therefore\n$k_{\\perp}$ of the pump wave) play an important role in the instability\nprocess. Despite this, modulational instability theory with $k_{\\perp}=0$ has\nseveral features in common with the observed nonresonant mode and Alfv\\'en wave\nsidebands.\n", "  In this work, we consider the problem of influence maximization on a\nhypergraph. We first extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model to hypergraphs,\nand prove that the traditional influence maximization problem remains\nsubmodular. We then present a variant of the influence maximization problem\n(HEMI) where one seeks to maximize the number of hyperedges, a majority of\nwhose nodes are influenced. We prove that HEMI is non-submodular under the\ndiffusion model proposed.\n", "  Wavelets encode data at multiple resolutions, which in a wavelet description\nof a quantum field theory, allows for fields to carry, in addition to\nspace-time coordinates, an extra dimension: scale. A recently introduced Exact\nHolographic Mapping [C.H. Lee and X.-L. Qi, Phys. Rev. B 93, 035112 (2016)]\nuses the Haar wavelet basis to represent the free Dirac fermionic quantum field\ntheory (QFT) at multiple renormalization scales thereby inducing an emergent\nbulk geometry in one higher dimension. This construction is, in fact, generic\nand we show how higher families of Daubechies wavelet transforms of 1+1\ndimensional scalar bosonic QFT generate a bulk description with a variable rate\nof renormalization flow. In the massless case, where the boundary is described\nby conformal field theory, the bulk correlations decay with distance consistent\nwith an Anti-de-Sitter space (AdS3) metric whose radius of curvature depends on\nthe wavelet family used. We propose an experimental demonstration of the\nbulk/boundary correspondence via a digital quantum simulation using Gaussian\noperations on a set of quantum harmonic oscillator modes.\n", "  Based on a study of the thermophysical properties, we derived a practical\nformula for the normal zone propagation velocity appropriate for\nREBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ coated conductors in high magnetic fields. An\nanalytical expression to evaluate the current sharing temperature as a function\nof the operating conditions is also proposed. The presented study has allowed\nus to account for experimental results not fully understood in the framework of\nthe models widely used in the literature. In particular, we provided a\nfundamental understanding of the experimental evidence that the normal zone\npropagation velocity in REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ coated conductors can be mainly\ndetermined by the operating current, regardless of the applied field and\ntemperature.\n", "  In recent years several far-field microscopy techniques have been developed\nwhich manage to overcome the diffraction limit of resolution. A unifying\nclassification scheme for them is clearly desirable. We argue that existing\nschemes based on the information capacity of the optical system can not easily\nbe extended to cover e.g., STED microscopy or techniques based on single\nmolecule imaging. We suggest a classification based on a reconstruction of the\nAbbe limit.\n", "  We show that the physical principle \"the adjoint associates to each state a\n`test' for that state\" fully characterises the Hermitian adjoint for pure\nquantum theory, therefore providing the adjoint with operational meaning beyond\nits standard mathematical definition. Also, we show that for general process\ntheories, which all admit a diagrammatic representation, this physical\nprinciple induces a reflection operation.\n", "  We study the long-range force arising between two neutral---of electric\ncharge---aggregates of matter due to a neutrino-pair exchange, in the limit of\nzero neutrino mass. The conceptual basis for the construction of the effective\npotential comes from the coherent scattering amplitude at low values of t. This\namplitude is obtained using the methodology of an unsubtracted dispersion\nrelation in t at threshold for s, where (s, t) are the Lorentz invariant\nscattering variables. The ultraviolet behavior is irrelevant for the long-range\nforce. In turn, the absorptive part in the t-dependence is given by the\ncorresponding unitarity relation. We show that the potential describing this\nforce decreases as $r^{-5}$ at large separation distance r. This interaction is\ndescribed in terms of its own charge, which we call the weak flavor charge of\nthe interacting systems, that depends on the flavor of the neutrino as $Q_W^e =\n2Z-N$, $Q_W^\\mu = Q_W^\\tau = -N$. The flavor dependence of the potential\nfactorizes in the product of the weak charges of the interacting systems, so\nthat the resulting force is always repulsive. Furthermore, this charge is\nproportional to the number of constituent particles, which differs from the\nglobal mass, so this interaction could be disentangled from gravitation through\ndeviations from the Equivalence Principle.\n", "  We demonstrate room-temperature strong-coupling between a mid-infrared\n($\\lambda$=9.9 $\\mu$m) intersubband transition and the fundamental cavity mode\nof a metal-insulator-metal resonator. Patterning of the resonator surface\nenables surface-coupling of the radiation and introduces an energy dispersion\nwhich can be probed with angle-resolved reflectivity. In particular, the\npolaritonic dispersion presents an accessible energy minimum at k=0 where -\npotentially - polaritons can accumulate. We also show that it is possible to\nmaximize the coupling of photons into the polaritonic states and -\nsimultaneously - to engineer the position of the minimum Rabi splitting at a\ndesired value of the in-plane wavevector. This can be precisely accomplished\nvia a simple post-processing technique. The results are confirmed using the\ntemporal coupled mode theory formalism and their significance in the context of\nthe concept of strong critical coupling is highlighted.\n", "  This work investigates the self-excited shock wave oscillations in a\nthree-dimensional planar over-expanded nozzle turbulent flow by means of\nDetached Eddy Simulations. Time resolved wall pressure measurements are used as\nprimary diagnostics. The statistical analysis reveals that the shock\nunsteadiness has common features in terms of the root mean square of the\npressure fluctuations with other classical shock wave/boundary layer\ninteractions, like compression ramps and incident shocks on a flat plate. The\nFourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform are used to conduct the\nspectral analysis. The results of the former indicate that the pressure in the\nshock region is characterized by a broad low-frequency content, without any\nresonant tone. The wavelet analysis, which is well suited to study non\nstationary process, reveals that the pressure signal is characterized by an\namplitude and a frequency modulation in time.\n", "  Recycled pulsars are mainly characterized by their spin periods, B-fields and\nmasses. All these quantities are affected by previous interactions with a\ncompanion star in a binary system. Therefore, we can use these quantities as\nfossil records and learn about binary evolution. Here, I briefly review the\ndistribution of these observed quantities and summarize our current\nunderstanding of the pulsar recycling process.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the production of $X_b$ in the process\n$\\Upsilon(5S,6S)\\to \\gamma X_b$, where $X_b$ is assumed to be the counterpart\nof $X(3872)$ in the bottomonium sector as a $B {\\bar B}^*$ molecular state. We\nuse the effective Lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry to explore the\nrescattering mechanism and calculate their production ratios. Our results have\nshown that the production ratios for the $\\Upsilon(5S,6S) \\to \\gamma X_b$ are\norders of $10^{-5}$ with reasonable cutoff parameter range $\\alpha \\simeq 2\\sim\n3$. The sizeable production ratios may be accessible at the future experiments\nlike forthcoming BelleII, which will provide important clues to the inner\nstructures of the exotic state $X_b$.\n", "  The fundamental efficiency limit of a single bandgap solar cell is about 31%\nat one sun with a bandgap of about Eg = 1.35 eV (1), determined by the\ntrade-off of maximising current with a smaller bandgap and voltage with a\nlarger bandgap. Multiple bandgaps can be introduced to absorb the broad solar\nspectrum more efficiently. This can be realised in multi- junction cells, for\nexample, where two or more cells are stacked on top of each other either\nmechanically or monolithically connected by a tunnel junction. An alternative\nor complementary (see section 1.4) approach is the quantum well cell (QWC).\n", "  The nature of dark energy, driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe,\nis one of the most important issues in modern astrophysics. In order to\nunderstand this phenomenon, we need precise astrophysical probes of the\nuniversal expansion spanning wide redshift ranges. Quasars have recently\nemerged as such a probe, thanks to their high intrinsic luminosities and, most\nimportantly, our ability to measure their luminosity distances independently of\nredshifts. Here we report our ongoing work on observational reverberation\nmapping using the time delay of the Mg II line, performed with the South\nAfrican Large Telescope (SALT).\n", "  In this paper we show that the widely accepted method of the determination of\nCurie temperature (TC) in (Ga,Mn)As samples, based on the position of the peak\nin the temperature derivative of the resistivity,completely fails in the case\nof non-metallic and low-TC unannealed samples. In this case we propose an\nalternative method, also based on electric transport measurements, which\nexploits temperature dependence of the second derivative of the resistivity\nupon magnetic field.\n", "  The exact slope function was first proposed in $SL(2)$ sector and generalized\nto $SU(2)$ sector later. In this note, we consider the slope function in\n$SU(1|1)$ sector of ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM. We derive the quantity through the method\ninvented by N. Gromov and discuss about its validity. Further, we give comments\non the slope function in deformed SYM.\n", "  Despite all the success with developing super-resolution imaging techniques,\nthe Abbe limit poses a severe fundamental restriction on the resolution of\nfar-field imaging systems based on diffraction of light. Imaging with contact\nmicrolenses, such as microspheres or microfibers, can increase the resolution\nby a factor of two beyond the Abbe limit. The theoretical mechanisms of these\nmethods are debated in the literature. In this work, we focus on the recently\nexpressed idea that optical coupling between closely spaced nanoscale objects\ncan lead to the formation of the modes that drastically impact the imaging\nproperties. These coupling effects emerge in nanoplasmonic or nanocavity\nclusters, photonic molecules, or various arrays under resonant excitation\nconditions. The coherent nature of imaging processes is key to understanding\ntheir physical mechanisms. We used a cluster of point dipoles, as a simple\nmodel system, to study and compare the consequences of coherent and incoherent\nimaging. Using finite difference time domain modeling, we show that the\ncoherent images are full of artefacts. The out-of-phase oscillations produce\nzero-intensity points that can be observed with practically unlimited\nresolution (determined by the noise). We showed that depending on the phase\ndistribution, the nanoplasmonic cluster can appear with the arbitrary shape,\nand such images were obtained experimentally.\n", "  We found from experimental data that for noble gases and H$_2$, the energy is\npositive for the gas phase, and negative for the liquid, possibly except the\nsmall vicinity of the critical point, about $(1- T/T_c) \\le 0.005$. The line\n$E=E_c$, in the supercritical region is found to lie close to the Widom line,\nwhere $E_c$ is the critical energy.\n", "  We study the resonance interaction between two quantum electric dipoles\nimmersed in optically active surroundings. Quantum electrodynamics is employed\nto deal with dipole-vacuum interaction. Our results show that the optical\nactivity of surroundings will not change the single atom behaviors while it can\nchange the collective behaviors of the two dipoles, as well as greatly affect\nthe dipole-dipole resonance interaction. Especially, if the orientations of two\ndipoles are orthogonal and respectively perpendicular to the interdipole axis,\nthe interdipole resonance interaction can be established with the help of\noptically active surroundings while there is no resonance interaction in\nvacuum.\n", "  We use first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to\ninvestigate the interplay between oxygen vacancies, A-site cation size /\ntolerance factor, epitaxial strain, ferroelectricity and magnetism in the\nperovskite manganite series, AMnO3 (A=Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+). We find that, as\nexpected, increasing the volume through either chemical pressure or tensile\nstrain generally lowers the formation energy of neutral oxygen vacancies\nconsistent with their established tendency to expand the lattice. Increased\nvolume also favors polar distortions, both because competing rotations of the\noxygen octahedra are suppressed and because coulomb repulsion associated with\ncation off-centering is reduced. Interestingly, the presence of ferroelectric\npolarization favors ferromagnetic over antiferromagnetic ordering due to\nsuppressed antiferromagnetic superexchange as the polar distortion bends the\nMn-O-Mn bond angles away from the optimal 180deg. Intriguingly, we find that\npolar distortions compete with the formation of oxygen vacancies, which have a\nhigher formation energy in the polar phases; conversely the presence of oxygen\nvacancies suppresses the onset of polarization. In contrast, oxygen vacancy\nformation energies are lower for ferromagnetic than antiferromagnetic orderings\nof the same structure type. Our findings suggest a rich and complex phase\ndiagram, in which defect chemistry, polarization, structure and magnetism can\nbe modified using chemical potential, strain, and electric or magnetic fields.\n", "  Since 2004, the images obtained by Cassini spacecraft's on-board cameras have\nrevealed the existence of several small satellites in the Saturn system. Some\nof these small satellites are embedded in arcs of particles. While these\nsatellites and their arcs are known to be in corotation resonances with Mimas,\ntheir origin remains unknown. This work investigates one possible process for\ncapturing bodies into a corotation resonance, which involves raising the\neccentricity of a perturbing body. Therefore, through numerical simulations and\nanalytical studies, we show a scenario that the excitation of Mimas'\neccentricity could capture particles in a corotation resonance and given a\npossible explanation for the origin for the arcs.\n", "  We have observed the supernova remnant 3C~396 in the microwave region using\nthe Parkes 64-m telescope. Observations have been made at 8.4 GHz, 13.5 GHz,\nand 18.6 GHz and in polarisation at 21.5 GHz. We have used data from several\nother observatories, including previously unpublished observations performed by\nthe Green Bank Telescope at 31.2 GHz, to investigate the nature of the\nmicrowave emission of 3C 396. Results show a spectral energy distribution\ndominated by a single component power law emission with $\\alpha=(-0.364 \\pm\n0.017)$. Data do not favour the presence of anomalous microwave emission coming\nfrom the source. Polarised emission at 21.5 GHz is consistent with\nsynchrotron-dominated emission. We present microwave maps and correlate them\nwith infrared (IR) maps in order to characterise the interplay between thermal\ndust and microwave emission. IR vs. microwave TT plots reveal poor correlation\nbetween mid-infrared and microwave emission from the core of the source. On the\nother hand, a correlation is detected in the tail emission of the outer shell\nof 3C 396, which could be ascribed to Galactic contamination.\n", "  A rigorous theory of diffraction scattering from extended objects is\nproposed. The present theory is based on a multiple asymptotic expansion of an\nintegral equation for the exact wave function in terms of the large parameters\nof the problem, which are the range of the potential and the momentum\ncomponents of the incident particle. For small angles of incidence the density\nof positively charged particles on the axis of a chain is always lower than\nunit y and the density of negatively charged particles has a maximum for\ncertain strength of the potential which can exceed considerably unity. The\nconditions of validity of the proposed approach are obtained.\n", "  Achievement of all-optical ultrafast signal modulation and routing by a\nlow-loss nanodevice is a crucial step towards an ultracompact optical chip with\nhigh performance. Here, we propose a specifically designed silicon dimer\nnanoantenna, which is tunable via photoexcitation of dense electron-hole plasma\nwith ultrafast relaxation rate. Basing on this concept, we demonstrate the\neffect of beam steering up to 20 degrees via simple variation of incident\nintensity, being suitable for ultrafast light routing in an optical chip. The\neffect is demonstrated both in the visible and near-IR spectral regions for\nsilicon and germanium based nanoantennas. We also reveal the effect of\nelectron-hole plasma photoexcitation on local density of states (LDOS) in the\ndimer gap and find that the orientation averaged LDOS can be altered by 50\\%,\nwhereas modification of the projected LDOS can be even more dramatic: almost\n500\\% for transverse dipole orientation. Moreover, our analytical model sheds\nlight on transient dynamics of the studied nonlinear nanoantennas, yielding all\ntemporal characteristics of the proposed ultrafast nanodevice. The proposed\nconcept paves the ways to creation of low-loss, ultrafast, and compact devices\nfor optical signal modulation and routing.\n", "  Single-pixel cameras based on the concepts of compressed sensing (CS)\nleverage the inherent structure of images to retrieve them with far fewer\nmeasurements and operate efficiently over a significantly broader spectral\nrange than conventional silicon-based cameras. Recently, photonic time-stretch\n(PTS) technique facilitates the emergence of high-speed single-pixel cameras. A\nsignificant breakthrough in imaging speed of single-pixel cameras enables\nobservation of fast dynamic phenomena. However, according to CS theory, image\nreconstruction is an iterative process that consumes enormous amounts of\ncomputational time and cannot be performed in real time. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel single-pixel imaging technique that can produce\nhigh-quality images through rapid acquisition of their effective spatial\nFourier spectrum. We employ phase-shifting sinusoidal structured illumination\ninstead of random illumination for spectrum acquisition and apply inverse\nFourier transform to the obtained spectrum for image restoration. We evaluate\nthe performance of our prototype system by recognizing quick response (QR)\ncodes and flow cytometric screening of cells. A frame rate of 625 kHz and a\ncompression ratio of 10% are experimentally demonstrated in accordance with the\nrecognition rate of the QR code. An imaging flow cytometer enabling\nhigh-content screening with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 cells/s is\nalso demonstrated. For real-time imaging applications, the proposed\nsingle-pixel microscope can significantly reduce the time required for image\nreconstruction by two orders of magnitude, which can be widely applied in\nindustrial quality control and label-free biomedical imaging.\n", "  Campaigners are increasingly using online social networking platforms for\npromoting products, ideas and information. A popular method of promoting a\nproduct or even an idea is incentivizing individuals to evangelize the idea\nvigorously by providing them with referral rewards in the form of discounts,\ncash backs, or social recognition. Due to budget constraints on scarce\nresources such as money and manpower, it may not be possible to provide\nincentives for the entire population, and hence incentives need to be allocated\njudiciously to appropriate individuals for ensuring the highest possible\noutreach size. We aim to do the same by formulating and solving an optimization\nproblem using percolation theory. In particular, we compute the set of\nindividuals that are provided incentives for minimizing the expected cost while\nensuring a given outreach size. We also solve the problem of computing the set\nof individuals to be incentivized for maximizing the outreach size for given\ncost budget. The optimization problem turns out to be non trivial; it involves\nquantities that need to be computed by numerically solving a fixed point\nequation. Our primary contribution is, that for a fairly general cost\nstructure, we show that the optimization problems can be solved by solving a\nsimple linear program. We believe that our approach of using percolation theory\nto formulate an optimization problem is the first of its kind.\n", "  Among the most striking feature of blue straggler stars (BSS) is the presence\nof multiple sequences of BSSs in the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of\nseveral globular clusters. It is often envisaged that such a multiple BSS\nsequence would arise due a recent core collapse of the host cluster, triggering\na number of stellar collisions and binary mass transfers simultaneously over a\nbrief episode of time. Here we examine this scenario using direct N-body\ncomputations of moderately massive star clusters (of order 10^4 Msun ). As a\npreliminary attempt, these models are initiated with approx. 8-10 Gyr old\nstellar population and King profiles of high concentrations, being \"tuned\" to\nundergo core collapse quickly. BSSs are indeed found to form in a \"burst\" at\nthe onset of the core collapse and several of such BS-bursts occur during the\npost-core-collapse phase. In those models that include a few percent primordial\nbinaries, both collisional and binary BSSs form after the onset of the (near)\ncore-collapse. However, there is as such no clear discrimination between the\ntwo types of BSSs in the corresponding computed CMDs. We note that this may be\ndue to the less number of BSSs formed in these less massive models than that in\nactual globular clusters.\n", "  We present the development, tests and first results of the second generation\nLow Layer Scidar (LOLAS-2). This instrument constitutes a strongly improved\nversion of the prototype Low Layer Scidar, which is aimed at the measurement of\noptical turbulence profiles close to the ground, with high altitude-resolution.\nThe method is based on the Generalised Scidar principle which consists in\ntaking double-star scintillation images on a defocused pupil plane and\ncalculating in real time the autocovariance of the scintillation. The main\ncomponents are an open-truss 40-cm Ritchey-Chr\\'etien telescope, a german-type\nequatorial mount, an Electron Multiplying CCD camera and a dedicated\nacquisition and real-time data processing software. The new optical design of\nLOLAS-2 is significantly simplified compared with the prototype. The\nexperiments carried out to test the permanence of the image within the useful\nzone of the detector and the stability of the telescope focus show that LOLAS-2\ncan function without the use of the autoguiding and autofocus algorithms that\nwere developed for the prototype version. Optical turbulence profiles obtained\nwith the new Low Layer Scidar have the best altitude-resolution ever achieved\nwith Scidar-like techniques (6.3 m). The simplification of the optical layout\nand the improved mechanical properties of the telescope and mount make of\nLOLAS-2 a more robust instrument.\n", "  In this chapter we review the quantitative and qualitative aspects of\ndescribing the properties of magnetic solids on the basis of electronic\nHamiltonian. We show that a spin Hamiltonian approach becomes consistent with\nan electronic Hamiltonian approach if the spin lattice and its associated spin\nexchange parameters, to be used for the spin Hamiltonian, are determined by the\nenergy-mapping analysis based on DFT calculations. The preferred spin\norientation (i.e., the magnetic anisotropy) of a magnetic ion is not predicted\nby a spin Hamiltonian because it does not include the orbital degree of freedom\nexplicitly. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy is readily predicted by\nelectronic structure theories employing both orbital and spin degrees of\nfreedom, if one takes into consideration the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It was\nshown that the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted\nand understood in terms of the HOMO-LUMO interactions of the magnetic ion by\ntaking SOC as perturbation. A spin Hamiltonian gives rise to the spin-half\nmisconception, namely, the blind belief that spin-half magnetic ions do not\npossess magnetic anisotropy that arise from SOC. This misconception is a direct\nconsequence from the limitedness of a spin Hamiltonian that it lacks the\norbital degree of freedom. We show that the magnetic properties of 5d ion\noxides are better explained by the LS-coupling than by the jj-coupling scheme\nof SOC, that the spin-orbital entanglement of 5d ions is not as strong as has\nbeen assumed.\n", "  Under a terraforming scenario, a reactivated hydrological cycle on Mars will\nresult in upwards movement of water due to evaporation and precipitation. If\nMars' embryonic fossilized catchments provide inadequate drainage, Mars'\nlimited supplies of water may be absorbed entirely by crater lakes and\nglaciers, with negative consequences for the terraforming effort. We\ndemonstrate a stable, convergent algorithm for the efficient modeling of water\nflow over disordered terrain. This model is applied to Mars Orbital Laser\nAltimeter data and successfully predicts the formation of fossilized waterways\nand canyons visible only at much higher resolution. This exploratory study\nsuggests that despite its impossibly rugged appearance, ancient water flows\nhave carved channels that provide effective drainage over the majority of Mars'\nsurface. We also provide one possible reconstruction of a terraformed surface\nwater distribution.\n", "  DGRAV News:\n  DGRAV\n  we hear that....\n  Research Briefs:\n  GW150914\n  Obituaries:\n  Remembering Felix Pirani\n  Remembering David Finkelstein\n  Steve, the physicist\n  Remembering Sergio Dain\n  Editorial:\n  Gravitational physics in the modern university\n", "  In computational materials science, predicting the yield strain of\ncrosslinked polymers remains a challenging task. A common approach is to\nidentify yield via the first critical point of stress-strain curves produced by\nmolecular dynamics simulations. However, the simulated data can be excessively\nnoisy, making it difficult to extract meaningful results. In this work, we\ndiscuss an alternate method for identifying yield on the basis of residual\nstrain computations. Notably, the associated raw data produce a sharper signal\nfor yield through a transition in their global behavior. As we show, this\ntransition can be analyzed in terms of simple functions (e.g. hyperbolas) that\nadmit straightforward uncertainty quantification techniques.\n", "  We show that a Carnot cycle operating between a positive\ncanonical-temperature bath and a negative canonical-temperature bath has\nefficiency equal to unity. It follows that a negative canonical-temperature\ncannot be identified with an absolute temperature. We illustrate this with a\nspin in a varying magnetic field.\n", "  Over the years, the concept of leadership has experienced a paradigm shift -\nfrom solitary leader (centralized leadership) to de-centralized leadership or\ndistributed leadership. This paper explores the idea that centralized\nleadership, as earlier suggested, negatively impacts team performance. I\napplied the hypothesis to cricket, a sport in which leaders play an important\nrole in team's success. I generated batting partnership network and evaluated\nthe central-most player in the team, applying tools of social network analysis.\nAnalyzing 3420 matches in one day international cricket and 1979 Test matches\ninvolving 10 teams, I examined the impact of centralized leadership in outcome\nof a contest. I observed that the odds for winning a one day international\nmatch under centralized leadership is 30% higher than the odds for winning\nunder de-centralized leadership. In both forms of cricket (Test and one day\ninternational ), I failed to find evidence that distributed leadership is\nassociated with higher team performance. These results suggest important\nimplications for cricket administrators in development and management of\nworking teams.\n", "  Proteins are an example of heteropolymers able to self-assemble in specific\ntarget structures. The self-assembly of designed artificial heteropolymers is\nstill, to the best of our knowledge, not possible with control over the single\nchain self-assembling properties comparable to what natural proteins can\nachieve. What artificial heteropolymers lacks compared to bio-heteropolymers\nthat grants the latter such a versatility? Is the geometry of the protein\nskeleton the only a particular choice to be designable? Here we introduce a\ngeneral criteria to discriminate which polymer backbones can be designed to\nadopt a predetermined structure. With our approach we can explore different\npolymer backbones and different amino acids alphabets. By comparing the radial\ndistribution functions of designable and not-designable scenarios we identify\nas designability criteria the presence of a particular peak in the radial\ndistribution function that dominates over the random packing of the\nheteropolymer. We show that the peak is a universal feature of all designable\nheteropolymers, as it is dominating also the radial distribution function of\nnatural proteins. Our finding can help in understanding the key features that\nmake proteins a highly designable system. The criteria that we present can be\napplied to engineer new types of self-assembling modular polymers that will\nopen new applications for polymer based material science.\n", "  Nonlinear plant-scale interactions controlling the soil-water balance are\ngenerally not valid at larger spatial scales due to spatial heterogeneity in\nrainfall and vegetation type. The relationships between spatially averaged\nvariables are hysteretic even when unique relationships are imposed at the\nplant scale. The characteristics of these hysteretic relationships depend on\nthe size of the averaging area and the spatial properties of the soil,\nvegetation, and rainfall. We upscale the plant-scale relationships to the scale\nof a regional land-surface model based on simulation data obtained through\nexplicit representation of spatial heterogeneity in rainfall and vegetation\ntype. The proposed upscaled function improves predictions of spatially averaged\nsoil moisture and evapotranspiration relative to the effective-parameter\napproach for a water-limited Texas shrubland. The degree of improvement is a\nfunction of the scales of heterogeneity and the size of the averaging area. We\nalso find that single-valued functions fail to predict spatially averaged\nleakage accurately. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity results in\nscale-dependent hysteretic relationships for the statistical-dynamic and\nMontaldo & Albertson approaches.\n", "  We discuss how the centres of galaxy clusters evolve in time, showing the\nresults of a series of direct N-body simulations. In particular, we followed\nthe evolution of a galaxy cluster with a mass $M_{clus} \\simeq 10^{14}\n$M$_{\\odot}$ in different configurations. The dynamical evolution of the system\nleads in all the cases to the formation of dense and massive sub-structures in\nthe cluster centre, that form in consequence of a series of collisions and\nmerging among galaxies travelling in the cluster core. We investigate how the\nstructural properties of the main merging product depends on the\ncharacteristics of those galaxies that contributed to its formation.\n", "  Recent observations of the Virgo cluster and the Local Group suggested that\nsome galaxies are flowing out from their parent cluster. This may be the\nsignature that dark energy (DE) acts significantly also on small cosmological\nscales. By means of direct N-body simulations we performed several simulations,\nin which the effect of DE and gravity are taken into account, aiming to\ndetermine whether DE can produce an outflow of galaxies compatible with\nobservations. Comparing the different simulations, our results suggest that the\nobserved outflow of galaxies is likely due to the local effect of DE.\n", "  The stress transfer mechanism from a polymer substrate to a nano-inclusion,\nsuch as a graphene flake, is of extreme interest for the production of\neffective nanocomposites. Previous work conducted mainly at the micron scale\nhas shown that the intrinsic mechanism of stress transfer is shear at the\ninterface. However, since the interfacial shear takes its maximum value at the\nvery edge of the nano-inclusion it is of extreme interest to assess the effect\nof edge integrity upon axial stress transfer at the submicron scale. Here, we\nconduct a detailed Raman line mapping near the edges of a monolayer graphene\nflake which is simply supported onto an epoxy based photoresist\n(SU8)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix at steps as small as 100 nm. We\nshow for the first time that, the distribution of axial strain (stress) along\nthe flake deviates somewhat from the classical shear-lag prediction for a\nregion of about 2 um from the edge. This behavior is mainly attributed to the\npresence of residual stresses, unintentional doping and/or edge effects\n(deviation from the equilibrium values of bond lengths and angles, as well as\ndifferent edge chiralities). By considering a simple balance of shear-to-normal\nstresses at the interface we are able to directly convert the strain (stress)\ngradient to values of interfacial shear stress for all the applied tensile\nlevels without assuming classical shear-lag behavior. For large flakes a\nmaximum value of interfacial shear stress (ISS) of 0.4 MPa is obtained prior to\nflake slipping.\n", "  In this work we will derive an anisotropic generalisation of the finitely\nextensible chain model, due to Kuhn and Gr\\\"un, which is well known in rubber\nelasticity. This provides a chain energy that couples elastic behaviour to a\nprobability distribution describing the orientations of liquid crystal monomers\nwithin a main chain elastomer. The key point is to invoke a maximum relative\nentropy assumption on the distribution of bond angles in an observed chain. The\nchain energy's fourth order Taylor expansion is also given, which couples to\nthe second and fourth moments of the nematic distribution function only.\n", "  We discuss some current problems in the relationship between elementary\nparticle physics and gravitation, i.e., in the subject investigated by\nProf.~K.~P.~Staniukovich half a century ago. Specifically, the inflationary\nstage of the Universe evolution, originating from the vacuum polarization and\nparticle creation, corrections to Newton's gravitational law due to exchange of\nlight elementary particles or spontaneous compactification of extra dimensions,\nand constraints on the parameters of axions as probable constituents of dark\nmatter in our Universe are considered. It is pointed out that presently the\nrelationship between elementary particles and gravitation has become an\nexperimental science, and many experiments, directed towards resolution of all\nrelated problems, are performed in many countries.\n", "  The elastocaloric (eC) effects of natural rubber (NR) and shape memory alloys\n(SMAs) are compared and potential improvement for eC performances of SMAs is\nproposed. Both the plateau and hysteresis of stress-strain curve in NR and SMAs\nare observed. They are attributed to the similar phase transformation:\nstrain-induced crystallization (SIC) in NR and martensitic transformation in\nSMAs. For NR, the drawback of large strain can be reduced by pre-strain. For\nSMAs, the stress change with strain is smaller in stress plateau regime. Thus,\nthe drawback of large dynamic stress of SMAs is proposed to be reduced by a\nstatic pre-stress for working directly in this stress plateau regime. Choosing\nan appropriate pre-strain (pre-stress) and strain amplitude can make eC effect\nof NR working in the phase transformation (SIC) regime. This method can improve\nboth the eC strength and fatigue life in NR. Due to the similar phase\ntransformation (martensitic transformation) of SMAs to NR, this method is also\nproposed to improve the eC performances of SMAs.\n", "  We study the diphoton excess at 750 GeV reported by ATLAS and CMS, by\nassuming that it corresponds to a new spin-two resonant state. We model this\nstate as a massive graviton in a two-site model. We show that the very\nstringent bounds from $VV$ final states can be evaded naturally by considering\nthat the Higgs is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. In this case the couplings of\nthe graviton to the longitudinal electroweak gauge bosons can be parametrically\nsuppressed. On the other hand, partial compositeness allows to suppress the\nleptonic channels. We compute loop-induced contributions to the graviton\ncouplings by the presence of the SM third generation of quarks and composite\npartners of the SM fermions and obtain that they are not important. We find\nthat the diphoton signal and the experimental constraints from other decay\nchannels can be reproduced in a large and natural region of the parameter space\nof the theory.\n", "  We consider the Frenet-Serret geometry of null curves in a three and a\nfour-dimensional Minkowski background. We develop a theory of deformations\nadapted to the Frenet-Serret frame. We exploit it to provide a Lagrangian\ndescription of the dynamics of geometric models for null curves.\n"]}
