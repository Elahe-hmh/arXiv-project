Despite the simplicity with which the problem can be\nstated, the solution involves complex statistical issues that require careful\nanalysis. In contrast to the confidence bound, this concept has never been\nformally analyzed, leading to a great variety of often ad hoc solutions. Here\nwe formulate and describe the problem in a self-consistent manner. Detection\nsignificance is usually defined by the acceptable proportion of false positives\n(the TypeI error), and we invoke the complementary concept of false negatives\n(the TypeII error), based on the statistical power of a test, to compute an\nupper limit to the detectable source intensity. To determine the minimum\nintensity that a source must have for it to be detected, we first define a\ndetection threshold, and then compute the probabilities of detecting sources of\nvarious intensities at the given threshold. The intensity that corresponds to\nthe specified TypeII error probability defines that minimum intensity, and is\nidentified as the upper limit. Thus, an upper limit is a characteristic of the\ndetection procedure rather than the strength of any particular source and\nshould not be confused with confidence intervals or other estimates of source\nintensity. This is particularly important given the large number of catalogs\nthat are being generated from increasingly sensitive surveys. We discuss the\ndifferences between these upper limits and confidence bounds. Both measures are\nuseful quantities that should be reported in order to extract the most science\nfrom catalogs, though they answer different statistical questions: an upper\nbound describes an inference range on the source intensity, while an upper\nlimit calibrates the detection process. We provide a recipe for computing upper\nlimits that applies to all detection algorithms.\n", "  We present deep photometric observations of the open cluster NGC 2477 using\nHST/WFPC2. By identifying seven cluster white dwarf candidates, we present an\nanalysis of the white dwarf age of this cluster, using both the traditional\nmethod of fitting isochrones to the white dwarf cooling sequence, and by\nemploying a new Bayesian statistical technique that has been developed by our\ngroup. This new method performs an objective, simultaneous model fit of the\ncluster and stellar parameters (namely age, metallicity, distance, reddening,\nas well as individual stellar masses, mass ratios, and cluster membership) to\nthe photometry. Based on this analysis, we measure a white dwarf age of 1.035\n+/- 0.054 +/- 0.087 Gyr (uncertainties represent the goodness of model fits and\ndiscrepancy among models, respectively), in good agreement with the cluster's\nmain sequence turnoff age. This work is part of our ongoing work to calibrate\nmain sequence turnoff and white dwarf ages using open clusters, and to improve\nthe precision of cluster ages to the ~5% level.\n", "  While considerable advance has been made to account for statistical\nuncertainties in astronomical analyses, systematic instrumental uncertainties\nhave been generally ignored. This can be crucial to a proper interpretation of\nanalysis results because instrumental calibration uncertainty is a form of\nsystematic uncertainty. Ignoring it can underestimate error bars and introduce\nbias into the fitted values of model parameters. Accounting for such\nuncertainties currently requires extensive case-specific simulations if using\nexisting analysis packages. Here we present general statistical methods that\nincorporate calibration uncertainties into spectral analysis of high-energy\ndata. We first present a method based on multiple imputation that can be\napplied with any fitting method, but is necessarily approximate. We then\ndescribe a more exact Bayesian approach that works in conjunction with a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo based fitting. We explore methods for improving computational\nefficiency, and in particular detail a method of summarizing calibration\nuncertainties with a principal component analysis of samples of plausible\ncalibration files. This method is implemented using recently codified Chandra\neffective area uncertainties for low-resolution spectral analysis and is\nverified using both simulated and actual Chandra data. Our procedure for\nincorporating effective area uncertainty is easily generalized to other types\nof calibration uncertainties.\n", "  The problem of quantum state discrimination between two wave functions on a\nring is considered. The optimal minimum-error probability is known to be given\nby the Helstrom bound. A new strategy is introduced by inserting either\nadiabatically or instantaneously an impenetrable barrier. The insertion point,\nindependent of the shape of the initial wave function, becomes a node. The\nresulting modified wave functions can be, if the initial functions are\njudiciously chosen, distinguished with a smaller error probability, and as a\nconsequence the Helstrom bound can be violated under idealised conditions.\n", "  We perform a detailed investigation of multiple hard interactions in\nhadron-hadron collisions. We discuss the space-time, spin and color structure\nof multiple interactions, classify different contributions according to their\npower behavior and provide several elements required for establishing all-order\nfactorization. This also allows us to analyze the structure of Sudakov\nlogarithms in double hard scattering. We show how multiparton distributions can\nbe constrained by lattice calculations, by connecting them with generalized\nparton distributions, and by calculating their behavior at large transverse\nparton momenta.\n", "  There is a huge number of excellent and comprehensive textbooks on quantum\nmechanics. They mainly differ for the approach, more or less oriented to the\nformalism rather than to the phenomenology, as well as for the topics covered.\nThese lectures have been based mainly on the classical textbook by Gasiorowicz\n(1974). I must confess that the main reason for my choice of Gasiorowicz (1974)\nis affective, as it was the textbook where I first learned the basic principles\nof quantum mechanics. Beyond my personal taste, I now recognize that\nGasiorowicz (1974) is still a very good textbook on quantum mechanics, with a\nrigorous theoretical approach accompanied by a wide collection of applications.\nIf the textbook by Gasiorowicz was my main basis, I have taken much also from\nother textbooks such as Phillips (2003), as well as from the excellent\nclassical textbook by Dirac (1981).\n", "  We introduce and treat rigorously a new multi-agent model of the continuous\ndouble auction or in other words the order book (OB). It is designed to explain\ncollective behaviour of the market when new information affecting the market\narrives. The novel feature of the model is two additional slow changing\nparameters, the so-called sentiment functions. These sentiment functions\nmeasure the conception of the fair price of two groups of investors, namely,\nbulls and bears. Our model specifies differential equations for the time\nevolution of sentiment functions and constitutes a nonlinear Markov process\nwhich exhibits long term correlations. We explain the intuition behind\nequations for sentiment functions and present numerical simulations which show\nthat the behaviour of our model is similar to the behaviour of the real market.\nWe also obtain a diffusion limit of the model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type\nprocess with variable volatility. The volatility is proportional to the\ndifference of opinions of bulls and bears about the fair price of a security.\nThe paper is complimentary to our previous work where mathematical proofs are\npresented.\n", "  We conduct experiments in a turbulent bubbly flow to study the nature of the\ntransition between the classical $-$5/3 energy spectrum scaling for a\nsingle-phase turbulent flow and the $-$3 scaling for a swarm of bubbles rising\nin a quiescent liquid and of bubble-dominated turbulence. The bubblance\nparameter, which measures the ratio of the bubble-induced kinetic energy to the\nkinetic energy induced by the turbulent liquid fluctuations before bubble\ninjection, is often used to characterise the bubbly flow. We vary the bubblance\nparameter from $b = \\infty$ (pseudo-turbulence) to $b = 0$ (single-phase flow)\nover 2-3 orders of magnitude ($0.01 - 5$) to study its effect on the turbulent\nenergy spectrum and liquid velocity fluctuations. The probability density\nfunctions (PDFs) of the liquid velocity fluctuations show deviations from the\nGaussian profile for $b > 0$, i.e. when bubbles are present in the system. The\nPDFs are asymmetric with higher probability in the positive tails. The energy\nspectra are found to follow the $-$3 scaling at length scales smaller than the\nsize of the bubbles for bubbly flows. This $-$3 spectrum scaling holds not only\nin the well-established case of pseudo-turbulence, but surprisingly in all\ncases where bubbles are present in the system ($b > 0$). Therefore, it is a\ngeneric feature of turbulent bubbly flows, and the bubblance parameter is\nprobably not a suitable parameter to characterise the energy spectrum in bubbly\nturbulent flows. The physical reason is that the energy input by the bubbles\npasses over only to higher wave numbers, and the energy production due to the\nbubbles can be directly balanced by the viscous dissipation in the bubble wakes\nas suggested by Lance $\\&$ Bataille (1991). In addition, we provide an\nalternative explanation by balancing the energy production of the bubbles with\nviscous dissipation in the Fourier space.\n", "  We apply a self-consistent and robust Bayesian statistical approach to\ndetermining the ages, distances, and ZAMS masses of 28 field DA white dwarfs\nwith ages of approximately 4 to 8 Gyrs. Our technique requires only quality\noptical and near-IR photometry to derive ages with < 15% uncertainties,\ngenerally with little sensitivity to our choice of modern initial-final mass\nrelation. We find that age, distance, and ZAMS mass are correlated in a manner\nthat is too complex to be captured by traditional error propagation techniques.\nWe further find that the posterior distributions of age are often asymmetric,\nindicating that the standard approach to deriving WD ages can yield misleading\nresults.\n", "  We consider classically scale-invariant extensions of the Standard Model (CSI\nESM) which stabilise the Higgs potential and have good dark matter candidates.\nIn this framework all mass scales, including electroweak and dark matter\nmasses, are generated dynamically and have a common origin. We consider Abelian\nand non-Abelian hidden sectors portally coupled to the SM with and without a\nreal singlet scalar. We perform a careful analysis of RG running to determine\nregions in the parameter space where the SM Higgs vacuum is stabilised. After\ncombining this with the LHC Higgs constraints, in models without a singlet,\nnone of the regained parameter space in Abelian ESMs, and only a small section\nin the non-Abelian ESM survives. However, in all singlet-extended models we\nfind that the Higgs vacuum can be stabilised in all of the parameter space\nconsistent with the LHC constraints. These models naturally contain two dark\nmatter candidates: the real singlet and the dark gauge boson in non-Abelian\nmodels. We determine the viable range of parameters in the CSI ESM framework by\ncomputing the relic abundance, imposing direct detection constraints and\ncombining with the LHC Higgs constraints. In addition to being instrumental in\nHiggs stabilisation, we find that the singlet component is required to explain\nthe observed dark matter density.\n", "  The computational cost of counting the number of solutions satisfying a\nBoolean formula, which is a problem instance of #SAT, has proven subtle to\nquantify. Even when finding individual satisfying solutions is computationally\neasy (e.g. 2-SAT, which is in P), determining the number of solutions is\n#P-hard. Recently, computational methods simulating quantum systems experienced\nadvancements due to the development of tensor network algorithms and associated\nquantum physics-inspired techniques. By these methods, we give an algorithm\nusing an axiomatic tensor contraction language for n-variable #SAT instances\nwith complexity $O((g+cd)^{O(1)} 2^c)$ where $c$ is the number of COPY-tensors,\n$g$ is the number of gates, and $d$ is the maximal degree of any COPY-tensor.\nThus, counting problems can be solved efficiently when their tensor network\nexpression has at most $O(\\log c)$ COPY-tensors and polynomial fan-out. This\nframework also admits an intuitive proof of a variant of the Tovey conjecture\n(the r,1-SAT instance of the Dubois-Tovey theorem). This study increases the\ntheory, expressiveness and application of tensor based algorithmic tools and\nprovides an alternative insight on these problems which have a long history in\nstatistical physics and computer science.\n", "  In a secluded dark sector which is coupled to the Standard Model via a Higgs\nportal interaction we arrange for the existence of 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic\nmonopoles and study their implications for cosmology. We point out that a dark\nsector which can accommodate stable monopoles will also contain massless dark\nphotons gamma' as well as charged massive vector bosons W'. The dark matter in\nthis scenario will be a combination of magnetically and electrically charged\nspecies under the unbroken U(1) subgroup of the dark sector. We estimate the\ncosmological production rate of monopoles and the rate of\nmonopole-anti-monopole annihilation and conclude that monopoles with masses of\nfew hundred TeV or greater, can produce sizeable contributions to the observed\ndark matter relic density. We scan over the parameter space and compute the\nrelic density for monopoles and vector bosons. Turning to the dark photon\nradiation, we compute their contribution to the measured density of\nrelativistic particles Neff and also apply observational constraints from the\nBullet cluster and other large scale galaxies on long-range interactions for\nthe self-interacting dark matter components made out of monopoles and out of\ndark vector bosons. At scales relevant for dwarf galaxies we identify regions\non the parameter space where self-interacting monopole and vector dark mater\ncomponents can aid solving the core-cusp and the too-big-to-fail problems.\n", "  We construct a global flat embedding structure of a Taub-NUT-AdS spacetime to\nyield a (6+5)-dimensional novel global embedding Minkowski spacetime. We also\ninvestigate Taub-NUT, Schwarzschild-AdS and Schwarzschild limits of the global\nembedding by exploiting parameter reduction scheme. In particular, we observe\nin the vanishing monopole strength limit of the Taub-NUT-AdS that the parameter\nreduction is not smoothly applicable to the Schwarzschild-AdS, due to the\npresence of imaginary roots of its lapse function associated with event\nhorizon. Moreover, reductions from the Taub-NUT-AdS and Schwarzschild-AdS to\nTaub-NUT and Schwarzschild, respectively, are successfully performed. Finally,\nwe construct the global embedding Minkowski spacetimes for the patches inside\nthe event horizons of the Taub-NUT-AdS and its extended manifolds.\n", "  We investigate the potential of using cosmic voids as a probe to constrain\ncosmological parameters through the gravitational lensing effect of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and make predictions for the next generation\nsurveys. By assuming the detection of a series of $\\approx 5 - 10$ voids along\na line of sight within a square-degree patch of the sky, we found that they can\nbe used to break the degeneracy direction of some of the cosmological parameter\nconstraints (for example $\\omega_b$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$) in comparison with\nthe constraints from random CMB skies with the same size area for a survey with\nextensive integration time. This analysis is based on our current knowledge of\nthe average void profile and analytical estimates of the void number function.\nWe also provide combined cosmological parameter constraints between a sky patch\nwhere series of voids are detected and a patch without voids (a randomly\nselected patch). The full potential of this technique relies on an accurate\ndetermination of the void profile to $\\approx 10$% level. For a small-area CMB\nobservation with extensive integration time and a high signal-to-noise ratio,\nCMB lensing with such series of voids will provide a complementary route to\ncosmological parameter constraints to the CMB observations. Example of\nparameter constraints with a series of five voids on a $1.0^{\\circ} \\times\n1.0^{\\circ}$ patch of the sky are $100\\omega_b = 2.20 \\pm 0.27$, $\\omega_c =\n0.120 \\pm 0.022$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.682 \\pm 0.078$, $\\Delta_{\\mathcal{R}}^2 =\n\\left(2.22 \\pm 7.79\\right) \\times 10^{-9}$, $n_s = 0.962 \\pm 0.097$ and $\\tau =\n0.925 \\pm 1.747$ at 68% C.L.\n", "  We compute the central charge $C_T$ and universal conductivity $C_J$ of $N_F$\nfermions coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field up to next-to-leading order in the\n$1/N_F$ expansion. We discuss implications of these precision computations as a\ndiagnostic for response and entanglement properties of interacting conformal\nfield theories for strongly correlated condensed matter phases and conformal\nquantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall effect is endowed with topologically protected edge modes\nwith gapless Dirac spectrum. Applying a magnetic field locally along the edge\nleads to a gapped edge spectrum with opposite parity for winding of spin\ntexture for conduction and valence band. Using Pancharatnam's prescription for\ngeometric phase it is shown that mismatch of this parity across a $p$-$n$\njunction, which could be engineered into the edge by electrical gate induced\ndoping, leads to a phase dependence in the two-terminal conductance which is\npurely topological (0 or $\\pi$). This fact results in a ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$\nclassification of such junctions with an associated duality. Current asymmetry\nmeasurements which are shown to be robust against electron-electron\ninteractions are proposed to infer this topology.\n", "  In the framework of the algebraic approach to form factors in two-dimensional\nintegrable models of quantum field theory we consider the reduction of the\nsine-Gordon model to the $\\Phi_{13}$-perturbation of minimal conformal models\nof the $M(2,2s+1)$ series. We find in an algebraic form the condition of\ncompatibility of local operators with the reduction. We propose a construction\nthat make it possible to obtain reduction compatible local operators in terms\nof screening currents. As an application we obtain exact multiparticle form\nfactors for the compatible with the reduction conserved currents $T_{\\pm2k}$,\n$\\Theta_{\\pm(2k-2)}$, which correspond to the spin $\\pm(2k-1)$ integrals of\nmotion, for any positive integer~$k$. Furthermore, we obtain all form factors\nof the operators $T_{2k}T_{-2l}$, which generalize the famous $T\\bar T$\noperator. The construction is analytic in the $s$ parameter and, therefore,\nmakes sense in the sine-Gordon theory.\n", "  We study chromo-natural inflation in the axiverse. More precisely, we\ninvestigate natural inflation with two axions coupled with a SU(2) gauge field.\nAssuming a hierarchy between the coupling constants, we find that for certain\ninitial conditions, conventional natural inflation commences and continues for\ntens of e-foldings, and subsequently chromo-natural inflation takes over from\nnatural inflation. For these solutions, we expect that the predictions are in\nagreement with observations on CMB scales. Moreover, since chromo-natural\ninflation occurs in the latter part of the inflationary stage, chiral\nprimordial gravitational waves are produced in the interesting frequency range\nhigher than $10^{-10}$Hz, which might be detectable by future gravitational\nwave observations.\n", "  The \"metric\" structure of nonrelativistic spacetimes consists of a one-form\n(the absolute clock) whose kernel is endowed with a positive-definite metric.\nContrarily to the relativistic case, the metric structure and the torsion do\nnot determine a unique Galilean (i.e. compatible) connection. This subtlety is\nintimately related to the fact that the timelike part of the torsion is\nproportional to the exterior derivative of the absolute clock. When the latter\nis not closed, torsionfreeness and metric-compatibility are thus mutually\nexclusive. We will explore generalisations of Galilean connections along the\ntwo corresponding alternative roads in a series of papers. In the present one,\nwe focus on compatible connections and investigate the equivalence problem\n(i.e. the search for the necessary data allowing to uniquely determine\nconnections) in the torsionfree and torsional cases. More precisely, we\ncharacterise the affine structure of the spaces of such connections and display\nthe associated model vector spaces. In contrast with the relativistic case, the\nmetric structure does not single out a privileged origin for the space of\nmetric-compatible connections. In our construction, the role of the Levi-Civita\nconnection is played by a whole class of privileged origins, the so-called\ntorsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometries recently investigated in the\nliterature. Finally, we discuss a generalisation of Newtonian connections to\nthe torsional case.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a supersymmetric AKNS spectral problem. Two\nelementary and a binary Darboux transformations are constructed. By means of\nreductions, Darboux and B\\\"acklund transformations are given for the\nsupersymmetric modified Korteweg-de Vries, sinh-Gordon and nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. These Darboux and B\\\"acklund transformations are\nadopted for the constructions of integrable discrete super systems, and both\nsemi-discrete and fully discrete systems are presented. Also, the continuum\nlimits of the relevant discrete systems are worked out.\n", "  We analyze the applicability of perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach to the issue\nof $J/\\psi$ recombination at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and calculate the\nrecombination cross section for $c\\bar{c}$ recombination to form $J/\\psi$ as a\nfunction of temperature. The charmonium wavefunction is obtained by employing a\ntemperature dependent phenomenological potential between the $c\\bar{c}$ pair.\nThe temperature dependent formation time of charmonium is also employed in the\ncurrent work. A set of coupled rate equations is established which incorporates\ncolor screening, gluonic dissociation, collisional damping and recombination of\nuncorrelated $c\\bar{c}$ pair in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium. The final\n$J/\\psi$ suppression, thus determined as a function of centrality is compared\nwith the ALICE experimental data at both mid and forward rapidity and CMS\nexperimental data at mid rapidity obtained from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nat center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV.\n  Keywords : Color screening, Recombination, Gluonic dissociation, Collisional\ndamping, Survival probability, pQCD, Charmonium\n  PACS numbers : 12.38.Mh, 12.38.Gc, 25.75.Nq, 24.10.Pa\n", "  It is well known that vacuum equation of arbitrary Lovelock order for static\nspacetime ultimately reduces to a single algebraic equation, we show that the\nsame continues to hold true for pure Lovelock gravity of arbitrary order $N$\nfor topology ${\\bf S^{(n)} \\times S^{(n)}}$. We thus obtain pure Lovelock\nstatic black hole solutions with two-sphere topology for any order $N$, and in\nparticular we study in full detail the third and fourth order Lovelock black\nholes. It is remarkable that thermodynamical stability of black hole discerns\nbetween odd and even $N$, and consequently between negative and positive\n$\\Lambda$ and it favours the former while rejecting the latter.\n", "  The main purpose of this work is to provide reference data on X-ray\nionization yields and energy spectra in liquid Ar to the studies in the field\nof Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) for rare-event and other experiments,\nbased on liquid Ar detectors. We present the results of two related researches.\nFirst, the X-ray recombination coefficients in the energy range of 10-1000 keV\nand ionization yields at different electric fields, between 0.6 and 2.3 kV/cm,\nare determined in liquid Ar based on the results of a dedicated experiment.\nSecond, the energy spectra of pulsed X-rays in liquid Ar in the energy range of\n15-40 keV, obtained in given experiments including that with the two-phase\nCRAD, are interpreted and compared to those calculated using a computer\nprogram, to correctly determine the absorbed X-ray energy. The X-ray\nrecombination coefficients and ionization yields have for the first time been\npresented for liquid Ar in systematic way.\n", "  We investigate finite-size scaling of genuine multisite entanglement in the\nground state of quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. We obtain the ground\nstates of odd- and even-legged Heisenberg ladder Hamiltonians and compute\ngenuine multisite entanglement, the generalized geometric measure (GGM), which\nshows that for even rungs, GGM increases for odd-legged ladder while it\ndecreases for even ones. Interestingly, the ground state obtained by\nshort-range dimer coverings, under the resonating valence bond (RVB) ansatz,\nencapsulates the qualitative features of GGM for both the ladders. We find that\nwhile the GGMs for higher legged odd- and even-ladders converge to a single\nvalue in the asymptotic limit of a large number of rungs, the finite-size\nscaling exponents of the same tend to diverge. The scaling exponent of GGM\nobtained by employing density matrix recursion method is therefore a reliable\nquantity in distinguishing the odd-even dichotomy in Heisenberg ladders, even\nwhen the corresponding multisite entanglements merge.\n", "  Some remarks are made on the theoretical interpretation of recent\nexperimental results on the propagation speed of electromagnetic force fields.\n", "  We present the scalar leptoquark pair production process at the LHC computed\nat the next-to-leading order in QCD, matched to the PYTHIA parton shower using\nthe MC@NLO formalism. We consider the leading order decay of a leptoquark to a\nlepton ($e,\\mu,\\tau$ or $\\nu_e,\\nu_\\mu,\\nu_\\tau$) and a jet and observe the\neffects of parton shower on the final states. For demonstration, we display the\nkinametical distributions of a selection of observables along with their scale\nuncertainties for the 13 TeV LHC. We also present pair production cross\nsections and $K$-factors using massless five-quark flavor scheme for different\nLHC center-of-mass energies. The complete stand-alone code is available online.\n", "  I propose a simple and manageable method that allows for deriving coupling\nconstants of model energy density functionals (EDFs) directly from ab initio\ncalculations performed for finite fermion systems. A proof-of-principle\napplication allows for linking properties of finite nuclei, determined by using\nthe nuclear nonlocal Gogny functional, to the coupling constants of the\nquasilocal Skyrme functional. The method does not rely on properties of\ninfinite fermion systems but on the ab initio calculations in finite systems.\nIt also allows for quantifying merits of different model EDFs in describing the\nab initio results.\n", "  In this letter, by regarding finite-time stability as an inverse problem, we\nreveal the essence of finite-time stability and fixed-time stability. Some\nnecessary and sufficient conditions are given. As application, we give a new\napproach for finite-time and fixed-time synchronization and consensus. Many\nexisting results can be derived by the general approach.\n", "  We calculate angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) for\ninterlayer transport of cuprate superconductors in the presence of ($\\pi,\\pi$)\norder. The order reconstructs the Fermi surface, creating magnetic breakdown\njunctions; we show how such magnetic breakdown effects can be incorporated into\ncalculations of interlayer conductivity for this system. We successfully fit\nexperimental data with our model, and these fits suggest a connection between\n($\\pi,\\pi$) order and the anisotropic scattering observed in overdoped\ncuprates. This work paves the way for the use of AMRO as a tool to distinguish\ndifferent kinds of ordered states.\n", "  The problem of DNA$-$DNA interaction mediated by divalent counterions is\nstudied using a generalized Grand-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation for a system\nof two salts. The effect of the divalent counterion size on the condensation\nbehavior of the DNA bundle is investigated. Experimentally, it is known that\nmultivalent counterions have strong effect on the DNA condensation phenomenon.\nWhile tri- and tetra-valent counterions are shown to easily condense free DNA\nmolecules in solution into toroidal bundles, the situation with divalent\ncounterions are not as clear cut. Some divalent counterions like Mg$^{+2}$ are\nnot able to condense free DNA molecules in solution, while some like Mn$^{+2}$\ncan condense them into disorder bundles. In restricted environment such as in\ntwo dimensional system or inside viral capsid, Mg$^{+2}$ can have strong effect\nand able to condense them, but the condensation varies qualitatively with\ndifferent system, different coions. It has been suggested that divalent\ncounterions can induce attraction between DNA molecules but the strength of the\nattraction is not strong enough to condense free DNA in solution. However, if\nthe configuration entropy of DNA is restricted, these attractions are enough to\ncause appreciable effects. The variations among different divalent salts might\nbe due to the hydration effect of the divalent counterions. In this paper, we\ntry to understand this variation using a very simple parameter, the size of the\ndivalent counterions. We investigate how divalent counterions with different\nsizes can leads to varying qualitative behavior of DNA condensation in\nrestricted environments. Additionally a Grand canonical Monte-Carlo method for\nsimulation of systems with two different salts is presented in detail.\n", "  In the large polaron model of H. Froehlich, the electron-phonon interaction\nis a small perturbation in form sense, but a large perturbation in operator\nsense. This means that the form-domain of the Hamiltonian is not affected by\nthe interaction but the domain of self-adjointness is. In the particular case\nof the Froehlich model, we are nevertheless able, thanks to a recently\npublished new operator bound, to give an explicit characterization of the\ndomain in terms of a suitable dressing transform. Using the mapping properties\nof this dressing transform, we analyze the smoothness of vectors in the domain\nof the Hamiltonian with respect to the position of the electron.\n", "  We obtain scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from a\nWeyl-invariant scalar-tensor theory in de Sitter spacetime. This implies that\nthe Weyl-invariance guarantees to implement the scale-invariance of power\nspectrum in de Sitter spacetime. We establish a deep connection between the\nWeyl-invariance of the action and scale-invariance of power spectrum in de\nSitter spacetime.\n", "  The calculation of finite temperature contributions to the scalar potential\nin a quantum field theory is similar to the calculation of loop corrections at\nzero temperature. In natural extensions of the Standard Model where loop\ncorrections to the Higgs potential cancel between Standard Model degrees of\nfreedom and their symmetry partners, it is interesting to contemplate whether\nfinite temperature corrections also cancel, raising the question of whether a\nbroken phase of electroweak symmetry may persist at high temperature. It is\nwell known that this does not happen in supersymmetric theories because the\nthermal contributions of bosons and fermions do not cancel each other. However,\nfor theories with same spin partners, the answer is less obvious. Using the\nTwin Higgs model as a benchmark, we show that although thermal corrections do\ncancel at the level of quadratic divergences, subleading corrections still\ndrive the system to a restored phase. We further argue that our conclusions\ngeneralize to other well-known extensions of the Standard Model where the Higgs\nis rendered natural by being the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone mode of an approximate\nglobal symmetry.\n", "  The effect of mutual interaction between dark solitons and dispersive waves\nis investigated numerically and analytically. The condition of the resonant\nscattering of dispersive waves on dark solitons is derived and compared against\nthe results of numerical simulations. It is shown that the interaction with\nintense dispersive waves affects the dynamics of the soltons strongly changing\ntheir frequencies and accelerating or decelerating the solitons. It is also\ndemonstrated that two dark solitons can form a cavity for dispersive weaves\nbouncing between the two dark solitons. The differences of the resonant\nscattering of the dispersive waves on the dark and bright solitons are\ndiscussed. In particular we demonstrate that two dark solitons and dispersive\nwave bouncing in between them create solitonic cavity with convex \"mirrors\"\nunlike the concave \"mirror\" in case of the bright solitons.\n", "  We derive a non-perturbative equation for the large scale structure power\nspectrum of long-wavelength modes. Thereby, we use an operator product\nexpansion together with relations between the three-point function and power\nspectrum in the soft limit. The resulting equation encodes the coupling to\nultraviolet (UV) modes in two time-dependent coefficients, which may be\nobtained from response functions to (anisotropic) parameters, such as spatial\ncurvature, in a modified cosmology. We argue that both depend weakly on\nfluctuations deep in the UV. As a byproduct, this implies that the renormalized\nleading order coefficient(s) in the effective field theory (EFT) of large scale\nstructures receive most of their contribution from modes close to the\nnon-linear scale. Consequently, the UV dependence found in explicit\ncomputations within standard perturbation theory stems mostly from\ncounter-term(s). We confront a simplified version of our non-perturbative\nequation against existent numerical simulations, and find good agreement within\nthe expected uncertainties. Our approach can in principle be used to precisely\ninfer the relevance of the leading order EFT coefficient(s) using small volume\nsimulations in an `anisotropic separate universe' framework. Our results\nsuggest that the importance of these coefficient(s) is a $\\sim 10 \\%$ effect,\nand plausibly smaller.\n", "  We present three-body nonrelativistic calculations within the framework of a\npotential model for the kaonic cluster ${K^-}pp$ using two completely different\nmethods: the method of hyperspherical harmonics in the momentum representation\nand the method of Faddeev equations in configuration space. To perform a\nnumerical benchmark, different $NN$ and antikaon-nucleon interactions are\napplied. The results of the calculations for the ground state energy for the\n${K^-}pp$ system obtained by both methods are in reasonable agreement. Although\nthe ground state energy is not sensitive to the $NN$ interaction, it shows very\nstrong dependence on the $\\overset{\\_}{K}N$ potential. We show that the\ndominant clustering of the ${K^-}pp$ system in the configuration $\\Lambda\n(1405)+p$ allows us to calculate the binding energy to good accuracy within a\nsimple cluster approach for the differential Faddeev equations. The theoretical\ndiscrepancies in the binding energy and width for the ${K^-}pp$ system related\nto the different $NN$ and $\\overset{\\_}{K}N$ interactions are addressed.\n", "  A new fluid-dynamic model is developed to numerically simulate the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of polydisperse gas-particle mixtures forming volcanic\nplumes. Starting from the three-dimensional N-phase Eulerian transport\nequations for a mixture of gases and solid particles, we adopt an asymptotic\nexpansion strategy to derive a compressible version of the first-order\nnon-equilibrium model, valid for low concentration regimes and small particles\nStokes $St<0.2$. When $St < 0.001$ the model reduces to the dusty-gas one. The\nnew model is significantly faster than the Eulerian model while retaining the\ncapability to describe gas-particle non-equilibrium. Direct numerical\nsimulation accurately reproduce the dynamics of isotropic turbulence in\nsubsonic regime. For gas-particle mixtures, it describes the main features of\ndensity fluctuations and the preferential concentration of particles by\nturbulence, verifying the model reliability and suitability for the simulation\nof high-Reynolds number and high-temperature regimes. On the other hand,\nLarge-Eddy Numerical Simulations of forced plumes are able to reproduce their\nobserved averaged and instantaneous properties. The self-similar radial profile\nand the development of large-scale structures are reproduced, including the\nrate of entrainment of atmospheric air. Application to the Large-Eddy\nSimulation of the injection of the eruptive mixture in a stratified atmosphere\ndescribes some of important features of turbulent volcanic plumes, including\nair entrainment, buoyancy reversal, and maximum plume height. Coarse particles\npartially decouple from the gas within eddies, modifying the turbulent\nstructure, and preferentially concentrate at the eddy periphery, eventually\nbeing lost from the plume margins due to the gravity. By these mechanisms,\ngas-particle non-equilibrium is able to influence the large-scale behavior of\nvolcanic plumes.\n", "  Recently, there has been much interest in holographic computations of\ntwo-point non-equilibrium Green functions from AdS-Vaidya backgrounds. In the\nstrongly coupled quantum field theory on the boundary, the dual interpretation\nof the background is an equilibration process called a holographic quench. The\ntwo dimensional AdS-Vaidya spacetime is a special case, dual to conformal\nquantum mechanics. We study how the quench is incorporated into a Hamiltonian\n$H + \\theta(t) \\Delta H$ and into correlation functions. With the help of\nrecent work on correlation functions in conformal quantum mechanics, we first\nrederive the known two point functions, and then compute non-equilibrium 3- and\n4-point functions. We also compute the 3-point function Witten diagram in the\ntwo-dimensional AdS-Vaidya background, and find agreement with the conformal\nquantum mechanics result.\n", "  We have presented theoretical and numerical studies on interactions of\ndispersive waves with second order solitons. Disperive wave with considerable\nintensity resonantly colliding with the second order solitons can lead to\nacceleration/decceleration of the later with subsequent central frequency\nshifts, but still well preserve the oscillating structure of the 2-solitons.\nThe 2-soliton creates an effective periodical refractive index profile and thus\nreflected and transmitted dispersive waves generate new spectral bands with\nsharp peak structures. When resonant dispersive waves interact with two second\norder solitons bounding them, multiple scattering with multiple frequency\nconversion of the radiation occurs. Thus 2-solitons and radiation trapped in\nbetween them can produce effective solitonic cavity with \"flat\" or \"concave\nmirrors\" depending on the intensity of the input.\n", "  We report measurement of a spin pumping effect due to fluctuations of the\nmagnetic order of IrMn thin films. A precessing NiFe ferromagnet injected spins\ninto IrMn spin sinks, and enhanced damping was observed around the IrMn\nmagnetic phase transition. Our data was compared to a recently developed theory\nand converted into interfacial spin mixing conductance enhancements. By\nspotting the spin pumping peak, the thickness dependence of the IrMn critical\ntemperature could be determined and the characteristic length for the spin-spin\ninteractions was deduced.\n", "  The dynamics after a quantum quench is determined by the weights of the\ninitial state in the eigenspectrum of the final Hamiltonian, i.e., by the\ndistribution of overlaps in the energy spectrum. We present an analysis of such\noverlap distributions for quenches of the anisotropy parameter in the\none-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model (XXZ chain). We provide\nan overview of the form of the overlap distribution for quenches from various\ninitial anisotropies to various final ones, using numerical exact\ndiagonalization. We show that if the system is prepared in the\nantiferromagnetic N\\'eel state (infinite anisotropy) and released into a\nnon-interacting setup (zero anisotropy, XX point) only a small fraction of the\nfinal eigenstates gives contributions to the post-quench dynamics, and that\nthese eigenstates have identical overlap magnitudes. We derive expressions for\nthe overlaps, and present the selection rules that determine the final\neigenstates having nonzero overlap. We use these results to derive concise\nexpressions for time-dependent quantities (Loschmidt echo, longitudinal and\ntransverse correlators) after the quench. We use perturbative analyses to\nunderstand the overlap distribution for quenches from infinite to small nonzero\nanisotropies, and for quenches from large to zero anisotropy.\n", "  We theoretically investigate light propagation and Anderson localization in\none-dimensional disordered superlattices composed of dielectric stacks with\ngraphene sheets in between. Disorder is introduced either on graphene material\nparameters ({\\it e.g.} Fermi energy) or on the widths of the dielectric stacks.\nWe derive an analytic expression for the localization length $\\xi$, and compare\nit to numerical simulations using transfer matrix technique; a very good\nagreement is found. We demonstrate that the presence of graphene may strongly\nattenuate the anomalously delocalised Breswter modes, and is at the origin of a\nperiodic dependence of $\\xi$ on frequency, in contrast to the usual asymptotic\ndecay, $\\xi \\propto \\omega^{-2}$. By unveiling the effects of graphene on\nAnderson localization of light, we pave the way for new applications of\ngraphene-based, disordered photonic devices in the THz spectral range.\n", "  Despite the tremendous progress of quantum cryptography, efficient quantum\ncommunication over long distances (>1000km) remains an outstanding challenge\ndue to fiber attenuation and operation errors accumulated over the entire\ncommunication distance. Quantum repeaters, as a promising approach, can\novercome both photon loss and operation errors, and hence significantly speedup\nthe communication rate. Depending on the methods used to correct loss and\noperation errors, all the proposed QR schemes can be classified into three\ncategories (generations). Here we present the first systematic comparison of\nthree generations of quantum repeaters by evaluating the cost of both temporal\nand physical resources, and identify the optimized quantum repeater\narchitecture for a given set of experimental parameters. Our work provides a\nroadmap for the experimental realizations of highly efficient quantum networks\nover transcontinental distances.\n", "  Continuous-time quantum error correction (CTQEC) is a technique for\nprotecting quantum information against decoherence, where both the decoherence\nand error correction processes are considered continuous in time. Given any\n[[n,k,d]] quantum stabilizer code, we formulate a class of protocols to\nimplement CTQEC, involving weak coherent measurements and weak unitary\ncorrections. Under this formalism, we show that the minimal required size of\nthe ancillary system is n-k+1 qubits, and we propose one scheme that meets this\nminimal requirement. Furthermore, we compare our method with other known\nschemes, and show that a particular measure of performance described in this\npaper is better when using our method.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental progress in high-resolution scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) techniques, we propose to investigate the local\nquasiparticle density of states around a unitary impurity in the heavy fermion\nsuperconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$. Based on the T-matrix approach we obtain a sharp\nnearly zero-energy resonance state (ZERS) in the strong impurity potential\nscattering localized around the impurity, and find qualitative differences in\nthe spatial pattern of the tunneling conductance modulated by the nodal\nstructure of the superconducting gap. These unique features may be used as a\nprobe of the superconducting gap symmetry and in combination with the further\nSTM measurements, may help to confirm the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ pairing in\nCeCoIn$_{5}$ at ambient pressure.\n", "  We use the Poisson-Boltzmann theory to predict contact angle saturation of\naqueous droplets in electrowetting. Our theory predicts that injection of ions\nfrom the droplet into its surrounding medium is responsible for the deviation\nof the apparent contact angle from the Young-Lippmann equation for large\napplied voltages. The ion injection substantially decreases the Maxwell stress\nand increases the osmotic pressure at the interface between the two media,\nleading to saturation of the apparent contact angle. Moreover, we find that the\ncontact angle does not saturate, but only has a broad minimum that increases\nagain upon further increase of the applied voltage, in agreement with\nexperiments.\n", "  The flux of geoneutrinos at any point on the Earth is a function of the\nabundance and distribution of radioactive elements within our planet. This flux\nhas been successfully detected by the 1-kt KamLAND and 0.3-kt Borexino\ndetectors with these measurements being limited by their low statistics. The\nplanned 20-kt JUNO detector will provide an exciting opportunity to obtain a\nhigh statistics measurement, which will provide data to address several\nquestions of geological importance. This paper presents the JUNO detector\ndesign concept, the expected geo-neutrino signal and corresponding backgrounds.\nThe precision level of geo-neutrino measurements at JUNO is obtained with the\nstandard least-squares method. The potential of the Th/U ratio and mantle\nmeasurements is also discussed.\n", "  Unexpected structure in images of astronomical sources often presents itself\nupon visual inspection of the image, but such apparent structure may either\ncorrespond to true features in the source or be due to noise in the data. This\npaper presents a method for testing whether inferred structure in an image with\nPoisson noise represents a significant departure from a baseline (null) model\nof the image. To infer image structure, we conduct a Bayesian analysis of a\nfull model that uses a multiscale component to allow flexible departures from\nthe posited null model. As a test statistic, we use a tail probability of the\nposterior distribution under the full model. This choice of test statistic\nallows us to estimate a computationally efficient upper bound on a p-value that\nenables us to draw strong conclusions even when there are limited computational\nresources that can be devoted to simulations under the null model. We\ndemonstrate the statistical performance of our method on simulated images.\nApplying our method to an X-ray image of the quasar 0730+257, we find\nsignificant evidence against the null model of a single point source and\nuniform background, lending support to the claim of an X-ray jet.\n", "  Measurements of spin excitations are essential for an understanding of\nspin-mediated pairing for superconductivity; and resonant inelastic X-ray\nscattering (RIXS) provides a considerable opportunity to probe high-energy spin\nexcitations. However, whether RIXS correctly measures the collective spin\nexcitations of doped superconducting cuprates remains under debate. Here we\ndemonstrate distinct Raman- and fluorescence-like RIXS excitations of\nBi$_{1.5}$Pb$_{0.6}$Sr$_{1.54}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+{\\delta}}$ in the mid-infrared\nenergy region. Combining photon-energy and momentum dependent RIXS measurements\nwith theoretical calculations using exact diagonalization provides conclusive\nevidence that the Raman-like RIXS excitations correspond to collective spin\nexcitations, which are magnons in the undoped Mott insulators and evolve into\nparamagnons in doped superconducting compounds. In contrast, the\nfluorescence-like shifts are due primarily to the continuum of particle-hole\nexcitations in the charge channel. Our results show that under the proper\nexperimental conditions RIXS indeed can be used to probe paramagnons in doped\nhigh-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors.\n", "  Even though it was discovered more than a decade ago, LSR1610-0040 remains an\nenigma. This object has a peculiar spectrum that exhibits some features\ntypically found in L subdwarfs, and others common in the spectra of more\nmassive M dwarf stars. It is also a binary system with a known astrometric\norbital solution. Given the available data, it remains a challenge to reconcile\nthe observed properties of the combined light of LSR1610-0040AB with current\ntheoretical models of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We present the results\nof a joint fit to both astrometric and radial velocity measurements of this\nunresolved, low-mass binary. We find that the photocentric orbit has a period\n$P = 633.0 \\pm 1.7$ days, somewhat longer than previous results, with\neccentricity of $e = 0.42 \\pm 0.03$, and we estimate that the semi-major axis\nof the orbit of the primary is $a_1 \\approx 0.32$ AU, consistent with previous\nresults. While a complete characterization of the system is limited by our\nsmall number of radial velocity measurements, we establish a likely primary\nmass range of $0.09 - 0.10 M_\\odot$ from photometric and color-magnitude data.\nFor a primary mass in this range, the secondary is constrained to be $0.06 -\n0.075 M_\\odot$, making a negligible contribution to the total I-band\nluminosity. This effectively rules out the possibility of the secondary being a\ncompact object such as an old, low-mass white dwarf. Based on our analysis, we\npredict a likely angular separation at apoapsis comparable to the resolution\nlimits of current high-resolution imaging systems. Measuring the angular\nseparation of the A & B components would finally enable a full, unambiguous\nsolution for the masses of the components of this system.\n", "  Neutrinoless double-beta ($0 \\nu \\beta \\beta$) decay is a promising beyond\nStandard Model process. Two-neutrino double-beta ($2 \\nu \\beta \\beta$) decay is\nan associated process that is allowed by the Standard Model, and it was\nobserved in about 10 isotopes, including decays to the excited states of the\ndaughter. $^{124}$Sn was the first isotope whose double-beta decay modes were\ninvestigated experimentally, and despite few other recent efforts, no signal\nhas been seen so far. Shell model calculations were able to make reliable\npredictions for $2 \\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay half-lives. Here we use shell model\ncalculations to predict the $2 \\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay half-life of $^{124}$Sn.\nOur results are quite different from the existing quasiparticle random-phase\napproximation (QRPA) results, and we envision that they will be useful for\nguiding future experiments. We also present shell model nuclear matrix elements\nfor two potentially competing mechanisms to the $0 \\nu \\beta \\beta$ decay of\n$^{124}$Sn.\n", "  The observation of a pair of simultaneous twin kHz QPOs in the power density\nspectrum of a neutron star or a black hole allows its mass-angular-momentum\nrelation to be constrained. Situations in which the observed simultaneous pairs\nare more than one allow the different models of the kHz QPOs to be falsified.\nDiscrepancy between the estimates coming from the different pairs would call\nthe used model into question. In the current paper the relativistic precession\nmodel is applied to the twin kHz QPOs that appear in the light curves of three\ngroups of observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR\nJ17511-3057. It was found that the predictions of one of the groups are\npractically in conflict with the other two. Another interesting result is that\nthe region in which the kHz QPOs have been born is rather broad and extends\nquite far from the ISCO.\n", "  PSR J1357$-$6429 is a young radio pulsar that was detected in X-rays and\n$\\gamma$-rays. We present the high spatial resolution near-infrared imaging of\nthe pulsar field in $J$, $H$ and $K_s$ bands obtained with the VLT/NaCo using\nthe Adaptive Optic system. We found a faint source at the most precise pulsar\nradio position which we propose as the pulsar near-infrared counterpart\ncandidate. It is confidently detected in the $J$ and $K_s$ bands, with $J$ =\n23.51$\\pm$0.24 and $K_s$ = 21.82$\\pm$0.25. There is a hint of the source in the\n$H$ band with an upper limit $H$ $>$ 22.8. The dereddened source fluxes are\ncompatible with the extrapolation of the pulsar X-ray spectrum towards the\nnear-infrared. If the candidate is the true counterpart, by this property PSR\nJ1357$-$6429 would be similar to the nearby middle-age pulsar PSR B0656+14. In\nthis case, both pulsars demonstrate an unusually high near-infrared efficiency\nrelative to the X-ray efficiency as compared to other pulsars detected in both\nranges.\n", "  Entropic cosmology assumes several forms of entropy on the horizon of the\nuniverse, where the entropy can be considered to behave as if it were related\nto the exchange (the transfer) of energy. To discuss this exchangeability, the\nconsistency of the two continuity equations obtained from two different methods\nis examined, focusing on a homogeneous, isotropic, spatially flat, and\nmatter-dominated universe. The first continuity equation is derived from the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, whereas the second equation is from the Friedmann\nand acceleration equations. To study the influence of forms of entropy on the\nconsistency, a phenomenological entropic-force model is examined, using a\ngeneral form of entropy proportional to the $n$-th power of the Hubble horizon.\nIn this formulation, the Bekenstein entropy (an area entropy), the\nTsallis--Cirto black-hole entropy (a volume entropy), and a quartic entropy are\nrepresented by $n=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The two continuity equations\nfor the present model are found to be consistent with each other, especially\nwhen $n=2$, i.e., the Bekenstein entropy. The exchange of energy between the\nbulk (the universe) and the boundary (the horizon of the universe) should be a\nviable scenario consistent with the holographic principle.\n", "  Using the Feynman-Dyson diagram technique, we study nonlinear\npolariton-polariton scattering in a two-dimensional micropillar-based optical\nsuperlattice with hexagonal symmetry. We demonstrate that both the emerging\npolariton chirality and the loop Feynman diagrams up to infinite order should\nbe strictly accounted for in the evaluation of the self-energy of the system.\nFurther, we explicitly show that in such a design the time of polariton\nscattering towards the Dirac points can be drastically decreased which can be\nused, for instance, in engineering novel classes of polariton lasers with\nsubstantially reduced thresholds.\n", "  Using $567\\rm{pb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collisions recorded at\n$\\sqrt{s}=4.599\\rm{GeV}$ with the BESIII detector, we report first measurements\nof absolute hadronic branching fractions of Cabibbo-favored decays of the\n$\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ baryon with a double-tag technique. A global least-square\nfitter is utilized to improve the measured precision. Among the measurements\nfor twelve $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ decay modes, the branching fraction for\n$\\Lambda_{c}^{+} \\rightarrow pK^-\\pi^+$ is determined to be\n$(5.84\\pm0.27\\pm0.23)\\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the\nsecond is systematic. In addition, the measurements of the branching fractions\nof the other eleven Cabbibo-favored hadronic decay modes are significantly\nimproved.\n", "  We demonstrate direct cooling of gaseous formaldehyde (H2CO) to the\nmicrokelvin regime. Our approach, optoelectrical Sisyphus cooling, provides a\nsimple dissipative cooling method applicable to electrically trapped dipolar\nmolecules. By reducing the temperature by three orders of magnitude and\nincreasing the phase-space density by a factor of ~$10^4$ we generate an\nensemble of $3\\cdot10^5$ molecules with a temperature of about 420\\mu K,\npopulating a single rotational state with more than 80% purity.\n", "  We show how to exactly calculate the refined indices of N=4 U(1) times U(N)\nsupersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics in the Coulomb branch by using the\nlocalization technique. The Coulomb branch localization is discussed from the\nviewpoint of both non-linear and gauged linear sigma models. A classification\nof fixed points in the Coulomb branch differs from one in the Higgs branch, but\nthe derived indices completely agree with the results which were obtained by\nthe localization in the Higgs branch. In the Coulomb branch localization, the\nrefined indices can be written as a summation over different sets of the\nCoulomb branch fixed points. We also discuss a space-time picture of the fixed\npoints in the Coulomb branch.\n", "  The impact of boundary scattering on non-diffusive thermal relaxation of a\ntransient grating in thin membranes is rigorously analyzed using the\nmultidimensional phonon Boltzmann equation. The gray Boltzmann simulation\nresults indicate that approximating models derived from previously reported\none-dimensional relaxation model and Fuchs-Sondheimer model fail to describe\nthe thermal relaxation of membranes with thickness comparable with phonon mean\nfree path. Effective thermal conductivities from spectral Boltzmann simulations\ncompletely free of any fitting parameters are shown to agree reasonably well\nwith experimental results. These findings are important for improving our\nfundamental understanding of non-diffusive thermal transport in membranes and\nother nanostructures.\n", "  We study the perturbative phase diagram of semi-simple fermionic gauge\ntheories resembling the Standard Model. We investigate an $SU(N)$ gauge theory\nwith $M$ Dirac flavors where we gauge first an $SU(M)_L$ and then an $SU(2)_L\n\\subset SU(M)_L$ of the original global symmetry $SU(M)_L\\times SU(M)_R \\times\nU(1) $ of the theory. To avoid gauge anomalies we add lepton-like particles. At\nthe two-loops level an intriguing phase diagram appears. We uncover phases in\nwhich one, two or three fixed points exist and discuss the associated flows of\nthe coupling constants. We discover a phase featuring complete asymptotic\nfreedom and simultaneously an interacting infrared fixed point in both\ncouplings. The analysis further reveals special renormalisation group\ntrajectories along which one coupling displays asymptotic freedom and the other\nasymptotic safety, while both flowing in the infrared to an interacting fixed\npoint. These are \\emph{safety free} trajectories. We briefly sketch out\npossible phenomenological implications, among which an independent way to\ngenerate near-conformal dynamics a l\\'a walking is investigated.\n", "  We study the spinful fermionic Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling using a\ncombination of quantum cluster methods: cluster perturbation theory (CPT), the\nvariational cluster approximation (VCA), and cluster dynamical mean-field\ntheory (CDMFT). We explore possible zero-temperature phases of the model as a\nfunction of on-site repulsive interaction strength and next-nearest-neighbor\nhopping amplitude and phase. Our approach allows us to access the regime of\nintermediate interaction strength, where charge fluctuations are significant\nand effective spin model descriptions may not be justified. Our approach also\nimproves upon mean-field solutions of the Haldane-Hubbard model by retaining\nlocal quantum fluctuations and treating them nonperturbatively. We find a\ncorrelated topological Chern insulator for weak interactions and a\ntopologically trivial N\\'eel antiferromagnetic insulator for strong\ninteractions. For intermediate interactions, we find that topologically\nnontrivial N\\'eel antiferromagnetic insulating phases and/or a topologically\nnontrivial nonmagnetic insulating phase may be stabilized.\n", "  We show that contrary to naive expectations the recently observed diphoton\nexcess can be explained by a vector resonance, which decays to a photon and a\nlight scalar $s$, followed by a decay of the scalar into two photons: $Z'\n\\rightarrow \\gamma s \\rightarrow 3 \\gamma$. As the two photons from the scalar\ndecay are highly boosted, the experimental signature is an apparent diphoton\nfinal state. In fact all the necessary ingredients are naturally present in\n$Z'$ models: Additional fermions with electroweak quantum numbers are required\nin order to render the theory anomaly free and naturally induce the required\neffective couplings, while the hidden Higgs which gives mass to the $Z'$ can be\nvery light. In particular no new coloured states are required in this\nframework. We also show that in such a setup the width of the resonance can be\nrather large, while all couplings remain perturbative.\n", "  As part of the T-REX project, a number of R&D and prototyping activities have\nbeen carried out during the last years to explore the applicability of gaseous\nMicromegas-read TPCs in rare event searches like double beta decay (DBD), axion\nresearch and low-mass WIMP searches. In both this and its companion paper, we\ncompile the main results of the project and give an outlook of application\nprospects for this detection technique. While in the companion paper we focus\non axions and WIMPs, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the\nmeasurement of the DBD of $^{136}$Xe in a high pressure Xe (HPXe) TPC.\nParticularly relevant are the results obtained in Xe + TMA mixtures with\nmicrobulk Micromegas, showing very promising results in terms of gain,\nstability of operation, and energy resolution at pressures up to 10 bar. TMA at\nlevels of $\\sim$1\\% reduces electron diffusion by a factor of 10 with respect\nto pure Xe, improving the quality of the topological pattern, with a positive\nimpact on the discrimination capability. Operation with a medium size prototype\n(30 cm diameter and 38 cm drift) of 1 kg of Xe at 10 bar in the fiducial\nvolumen has allowed to test the detection concept in realistic experimental\nconditions. Microbulk Micromegas are able to image the DBD ionization signature\nwith high quality while, at the same time, measuring its energy deposition with\na resolution of at least $\\sim$3% FWHM @ Q$_{\\beta\\beta}$, and probably down to\n$\\sim$1% FWHM. In addition, first results on the topological signature\ninformation show promising background discrimination capabilities out of reach\nof other experimental implementations. Moreover, microbulk Micromegas have very\nlow levels of intrinsic radioactivity, and offer cost-effective scaling-up\noptions. All these results demonstrate that Micromegas-read HPXe TPC is a very\ncompetitive technique for the next generation DBD experiments.\n", "  Heavy axion-like particles, called axizillas, are simple extensions of the\nstandard model(SM). An axizilla is required not to couple to the quarks,\nleptons, and Brout-Englert-Higgs doublets of the SM, but couple to the gauge\nanomalies of the $W^\\pm, Z$ and photon. It is possible to have its branching\nratios(BRs) to two photons greater than 10% and to two $Z$'s less than 10%. To\nhave a (production cross section)$\\cdot $(BR to di-photons) at a\n$10^{-38}\\,\\textrm{cm}^2$ level, a TeV scale heavy quark $Q$ is required for\nthe gluon--quark fusion process. The decay of $Q$ to axizilla plus quark, and\nthe subsequent decay of the axizilla to two photons can be fitted at the\nrequired level of $10^{-38}\\,\\textrm{cm}^2$.\n", "  Ten years have passed since the beginning of graphene research. In this\nperiod we have witnessed breakthroughs both in fundamental and applied\nresearch. However, the development of graphene devices for mass production has\nnot yet reached the same level of progress. The architecture of graphene\nfield-effect transistors (FET) has not significantly changed, and the\nintegration of devices at the wafer scale has generally not been sought.\nCurrently, whenever an electrolyte-gated FET (EGFET) is used, an external,\ncumbersome, out-of-plane gate electrode is required. Here, an alternative\narchitecture for graphene EGFET is presented. In this architecture, source,\ndrain, and gate are in the same plane, eliminating the need for an external\ngate electrode and the use of an additional reservoir to confine the\nelectrolyte inside the transistor active zone. This planar structure with an\nintegrated gate allows for wafer-scale fabrication of high-performance graphene\nEGFETs, with carrier mobility up to 1800 cm2 V-1 s-1. As a proof-of principle,\na chemical sensor was achieved. It is shown that the sensor can discriminate\nbetween saline solutions of different concentrations. The proposed architecture\nwill facilitate the mass production of graphene sensors, materializing the\npotential of previous achievements in fundamental and applied graphene\nresearch.\n", "  We use the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive of ultraviolet (UV) quasar\nspectroscopy to conduct the first blind survey for damped Ly-alpha absorbers\n(DLAs) at low redshift (z < 1.6). Our statistical sample includes 463 quasars\nwith spectral coverage spanning a total redshift path, dz = 123.3 or an\nabsorption path, dX = 229.7. Within this survey path, we identify 4 DLAs,\ndefined as absorbers with HI column density N(HI) >= 10^20.3cm-2, which implies\nan incidence per absorption length, l(X)= 0.017(+0.014-0.008) at a median\nsurvey path redshift of z=0.623. While our estimate of l(X) is lower than\nearlier estimates at z ~ 0 from HI 21cm emission studies, the results are\nconsistent within the measurement uncertainties. Our dataset is too small to\nproperly sample the N(HI) frequency distribution function f(N(HI),X), but the\nobserved distribution agrees with previous estimates at z > 2. Adopting the z >\n2 shape of f(N(HI),X), we infer an HI mass density at z ~ 0.6 of rho_HI =\n0.25(+0.20-0.12) x 10^8 Msol Mpc-3. This is significantly lower than previous\nestimates from targeted DLA surveys with the HST, but consistent with results\nfrom low-z HI 21cm observations, and suggests that the neutral gas density of\nthe universe has been decreasing over the past 10 Gyrs.\n", "  We report the observation of colossal positive magnetoresistance (MR) in\nsingle crystalline, high mobility TaAs2 semimetal. The excellent fit of MR by a\nsingle quadratic function of the magnetic field B over a wide temperature range\n(T = 2-300 K) suggests the semiclassical nature of the MR. The measurements of\nHall effect and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, as well as band structure\ncalculations suggest that the giant MR originates from the nearly perfectly\ncompensated electrons and holes in TaAs2. The quadratic MR can even exceed\n1,200,000% at B = 9 T and T = 2 K, which is one of the largest values among\nthose of all known semi-metallic compounds including the very recently\ndiscovered WTe2 and NbSb2. The giant positive magnetoresistance in TaAs2, which\nnot only has a fundamentally different origin from the negative colossal MR\nobserved in magnetic systems, but also provides a nice complemental system that\nwill be beneficial for applications in magnetoelectronic devices\n", "  Models of X-ray reverberation from extended coronae are developed from\ngeneral relativistic ray tracing simulations. Reverberation lags between\ncorrelated variability in the directly observed continuum emission and that\nreflected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time\nbetween the corona and reflecting disc. X-ray reverberation is detected from an\nincreasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are\nobserved, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation\nsignature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at\nlow frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3keV.\nThese features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays\noriginating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from\ncoronae extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal\npropagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity\npropagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying\naccretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to\nturbulence locally on the disc. We find that the observed features of X-ray\nreverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale\nvariability is dominated by the viscous propagation of fluctuations through the\ncorona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc\nbut with a bright central region in which fluctuations propagate up the black\nhole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost\nregions of the accretion flow.\n", "  The entanglement entropy of a free quantum field in a coherent state is\nindependent of its stress energy content. We use this result to highlight the\nfact that while the Einstein equations for first order variations about a\nlocally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields seem to\nfollow from Jacobson's principle of maximal vacuum entanglement entropy, their\npossible derivation from this principle for the physically relevant case of\nfinite but small variations remains an open issue. We also apply this result to\nthe context of Bianchi's identification, independent of unknown Planck scale\nphysics, of the first order variation of Bekenstein Hawking area with that of\nvacuum entanglement entropy. We argue that under certain technical assumptions\nthis identification seems not to be extendible to the context of finite but\nsmall variations to coherent states. Our particular method of estimation of\nentanglement entropy variation reveals the existence of certain contributions\nover and above those appearing in Jacobson's and Bianchi's works. We discuss\nthe sense in which these contributions may be subleading to those already\npresent in these works.\n", "  By systematically varying the mobility of self-propelled particles in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) lattice, we experimentally study the influence of particle\nmobility on system's collective motion. Our system is intrinsically\nnon-equilibrium due to the lack of energy equipartition. By constructing the\ncovariance matrix of spatial fluctuations and solving for its eigenmodes, we\nobtain the collective motions of the system with various magnitudes.\nInterestingly, our structurally ordered non-equilibrium system exhibits almost\nidentical properties as disordered glassy systems under thermal equilibrium:\nthe modes with large overall motions are spatially correlated and\nquasilocalized while the modes with small collective motions are highly\nlocalized, resembling the low- and high-frequency modes in glass. More\nsurprisingly, a peak similar to the boson peak forms in our non-equilibrium\nsystem as the number of mobile particles increases, revealing the possible\norigin of the boson peak from a dynamic aspect. We further illustrate that the\nspatially-correlated large-movement modes can be produced by the cooperation of\nhighly-active particles above a threshold fraction, while the localized\nsmall-movement modes can be created by adding individual inactive particles.\nOur study clarifies the role of mobility in collective motions, and further\nsuggests a promising possibility of extending the powerful mode analysis\napproach to non-equilibrium systems.\n", "  Here we fitted a 4-arm spiral structure to the more accurate data on global\narm pitch angle and arm longitude tangents, to get the start of each spiral arm\nnear the Galactic nucleus. We find that the tangent to the 'start of the\nSagittarius' spiral arm (arm middle) is at l= -17 degrees +/- 0.5 degree, while\nthe tangent to the 'start of the Norma' spiral arm (arm middle) is at l= +20\ndegrees +/- 0.5 degree.\n  Earlier, we published a compilation of observations and analysis of the\ntangent to each spiral arm tracer, from longitudes +23 degrees to +340 degrees;\nhere we cover the arm tracers in the remaining longitudes +340 degrees (=- 20\ndegrees) to +23 degrees. Our model arm tangents are confirmed through the\nrecent observed masers data (at the arm's inner edge). Observed arm tracers in\nthe inner Galaxy show an offset from the mid-arm; this was also found elsewhere\nin the Milky Way disk (Vallee 2014c).\n  In addition, we collated the observed tangents to the so-called '3-kpc-arm'\nfeatures; here they are found statistically to be near l= -18 degrees +/- 2\ndegrees and near l= +21 degrees +/- 2 degrees, after excluding misidentified\nspiral arms. We find that the model-computed arm tangents in the inner Galaxcy\nare spatially coincident with the mean longitude of the observed tangents to\nthe '3-kpc-arm' features (same galactic longitudes, within the errors). These\nspatial similarities may be suggestive of a contiguous space.\n", "  General relativity has passed all solar system experiments and neutron star\nbased tests, such as binary pulsar observations, with flying colors. A more\nexotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or\nmore black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the universe,\nproviding probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are\nmotivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large\ndeviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while\nrecovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general\nrelativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general\nrelativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational\ndegrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher\ncurvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is 4 dimensional. Altering a\ncharacteristic leads to a different extension of general relativity: (i)\nscalar-tensor theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity,\nand (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe\nblack hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints\non each theory using black hole-based tests of gravity. We close this review by\nlisting some of the open problems in model-independent tests and within each\nspecific theory.\n", "  We study excitations of solitary waves -- the kinks -- in scalar models with\ndegree eight polynomial self-interaction in (1+1) dimensions. We perform\nnumerical studies of scattering of two kinks with an exponential asymptotic off\neach other and analyse the occurring resonance phenomena. We connect these\nphenomena to the energy exchange between the translational and the vibrational\nmodes of the colliding kinks. We also point out that the interaction of two\nkinks with power-law asymptotic can lead to a long-range interaction between\nthe two kinks.\n", "  We derive the expressions for the full angular distributions of $\\bar B\\to\nD\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ and $\\bar B\\to D^{\\ast }\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decays and\ndiscuss the spectra on each angle separately. The coefficient functions,\ndepending on helicity amplitudes, can then be combined in an ensemble of\nobservables which can then be used to check for the presence of New Physics. We\nexamine the sensitivity of each of these observables on the presence of\nnon-Standard Model interaction terms at low energies. The expressions presented\nhere are general and can be used for studying any other semileptonic\npseudoscalar to pseudoscalar/vector meson decay. We also examine the problem of\npollution of the $\\bar B\\to D^{\\ast}(\\to D\\pi)_S\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decay sample\nby the $\\bar B\\to D_0^{\\ast}(\\to D\\pi)\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ events, and point out\nthat a measurement of two particular quantities could clarify whether or not\nthe $(D\\pi)_{S-\\rm wave}$ in the vicinity of $D^\\ast$-peak is (approximately)\ndescribed by the Breit-Wigner formula.\n", "  The fabrication of oxide electronics devices is presently hindered by the\nlack of standardized and well established patterning procedures, applicable\ndown to the nanoscale. In this work, the authors propose a procedure to obtain\npatterns with resolution around 100 nm on (La,Sr)MnO3/LaAlO3/SrTiO3\nheterostructures. Our method is based on a multistep technique, which includes\nwet and dry etching, epitaxial masking, and e-beam lithography. Our procedure\nis devised to define independent patterns on the interfacial two dimensional\nelectron gas and on the metallic top electrode, while preserving an all-in situ\napproach for the heterostructure growth. The authors show results on nano-scale\ndevices based on (La,Sr)MnO3/LaAlO3/SrTiO3, suitable for oxide spintronics\napplications.\n", "  We construct new families of discrete vector orthogonal polynomials that have\nthe property to be eigenfunctions of some difference operator. They are\nextensions of Charlier, Meixner and Kravchuk polynomial systems. The ideas\nbehind our approach lie in the studies of bispectral operators. We exploit\nautomorphisms of associative algebras which transform elementary (vector)\northogonal polynomial systems which are eigenfunctions of a difference operator\ninto other systems of this type. While the extension of Charlier polynomilas is\nwell known it is obtained by different methods. The extension of Meixner\npolynomial system is new.\n", "  This paper presents the first topological analysis of the economic structure\nof an entire country based on payments data obtained from Swedbank. This data\nset is exclusive in its kind because around 80% of Estonia's bank transactions\nare done through Swedbank, hence, the economic structure of the country can be\nreconstructed. Scale-free networks are commonly observed in a wide array of\ndifferent contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are\ncomprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are\nestablished by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and\nstructural properties of this network. We also describe its topology,\ncomponents and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural\ncharacteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a\npower law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We\nidentify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency\nagainst random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches.\nWith this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes\nis possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with\nrespect to economic shocks.\n", "  We study the decays of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson into a pair of\npseudoscalar Higgs states within U(1)_N extensions of the MSSM.\n", "  Despite the evaluation systems of human movement that have been advancing in\nrecent decades, their use are not feasible for clinical practice because it has\na high cost and scarcity of trained operators to interpret their results. An\nideal videogrammetry system should be easy to use, low cost, with minimal\nequipment, and fast realization. The CvMob is a free tool for dynamic\nevaluation of human movements that express measurements in figures, tables, and\ngraphics. This paper aims to determine if CvMob is a reliable tool for the\nevaluation of two dimensional human gait. This is a validity and reliability\nstudy. The sample was composed of 56 healthy individuals who walked on a\n9-meterlong walkway and were simultaneously filmed by CvMob and Vicon system\ncameras. Linear trajectories and angular measurements were compared to validate\nthe CvMob system, and inter and intrarater findings of the same measurements\nwere used to determine reliability. A strong correlation (rs mean = 0.988) of\nthe linear trajectories between systems and inter and intrarater analysis were\nfound. According to the Bland-Altman method, the angles that had good agreement\nbetween systems were maximum flexion and extension (stance and swing) of the\nknee and dorsiflexion range of motion and stride length. The CvMob is a\nreliable tool for analysis of linear motion and lengths in two-dimensional\nevaluations of human gait. The angular measurements demonstrate high agreement\nfor the knee joint; however, the hip and ankle measurements were limited by\ndifferences between systems.\n", "  Two-dimensional graphene plasmon-based technologies will enable the\ndevelopment of fast, compact and inexpensive active photonic elements because,\nunlike plasmons in other materials, graphene plasmons can be tuned via the\ndoping level. Such tuning is harnessed within terahertz quantum cascade lasers\nto reversibly alter their emission. This is achieved in two key steps: First by\nexciting graphene plasmons within an aperiodic lattice laser and, second, by\nengineering photon lifetimes, linking graphene's Fermi energy with the\nround-trip gain. Modal gain and hence laser spectra are highly sensitive to the\ndoping of an integrated, electrically controllable, graphene layer.\nDemonstration of the integrated graphene plasmon laser principle lays the\nfoundation for a new generation of active, programmable plasmonic metamaterials\nwith major implications across photonics, material sciences and nanotechnology.\n", "  Over the past 30 years, jet observables have proven to provide important\ninformation about the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. I\nreview the challenges, results, and open problems of jet physics in heavy-ion\ncollisions, discussing the main ideas as well as some most recent results\nfocussing on two major jet observables, the nuclear modification factor and the\nhigh-pT elliptic flow.\n", "  Neutron and nuclear beta decay correlation coefficients are linearly\nsensitive to the exotic scalar and tensor interactions that are not included in\nthe Standard Model. The proposed experiment will measure simultaneously 11\nneutron correlation coefficients ($a$, $A$, $B$, $D$, $H$, $L$, $N$, $R$, $S$,\n$U$, $V$) where 5 of them ($H$, $L$, $S$, $U$, $V$) were never addressed\nbefore. Silicon pixel detectors are considered as promising alternative to\nmulti-wire gas chambers devoted for electron tracking in the original setup.\nThe expected sensitivity limits for $\\epsilon_S$ and $\\epsilon_T$ -- EFT\nparameters describing the scalar and tensor contributions to be extracted from\nthe transverse electron polarization related coefficients $H$, $L$, $N$, $R$,\n$S$, $U$, $V$ are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the charge transport properties of hybrid\nnanoparticles (NPs) based on the polymeric 1D compound [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4),\nwhich is one of the most promising SCO systems for designing electronic\ndevices. In particular, we used for the first time hybrid SCO NPs covered with\na silica shell and placed in between single-layer graphene electrodes. We\nevidence a reproducible thermal hysteresis loop in the conductance above\nroom-temperature, meaning that no degradation of the current levels has been\ndetected; we thus conclude that the robustness of the spin-transition is\nsignificantly improved as compared with previous results and with other reports\nwhere even larger assemblies and SCO objects were involved. This bistability\ncombined with the versatility of graphene represents a promising scenario for a\nvariety of technological applications but also for future sophisticated\nfundamental studies.\n", "  Competition between two main attractors of the distributed chaos, one\nassociated with translational symmetry (homogeneity) and another associated\nwith rotational symmetry (isotropy), has been studied in freely decaying\nturbulence. It is shown that, unlike the case of statistically stationary\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence, the attractor associated with rotational\nsymmetry (and controlled by Loitsyanskii integral) can dominate turbulent local\ndynamics in an intermediate stage of the decay, because the attractor\nassociated with translational symmetry (and controlled by Birkhoff-Saffman\nintegral) is still not developed enough. The DNS data have been used in order\nto support this conclusion.\n", "  This is a brief summary of the 11th Applied Antineutrino Physics 2015\nworkshop held at the Virginia Tech Arlington Research Facility from December\n7-8, 2015.\n", "  We demonstrate how quantum computation can provide non-trivial improvements\nin the computational and statistical complexity of the perceptron model. We\ndevelop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm\nexploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane\nusing a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$, namely\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound\nof $O(\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}})$ through quantum means, where $\\gamma$ denotes the\nmargin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum\namplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron\nmodel.\n", "  The present paper investigates state space analysis of memristor based series\nand parallel RLCM circuits. The stability analysis is carried out with the help\nof eigenvalues formulation method, pole-zero plot and transient response of\nsystem. The state space analysis is successfully applied and eigenvalues of the\ntwo circuits are calculated. It is found that the, system follows negative real\npart of eigenvalues. The result clearly shows that addition of memristor in\ncircuits will not alter the stability of system. It is found that systems poles\nlocated at left hand side of the S plane, which indicates stable performance of\nsystem. It clearly evident that eigenvalues has negative real part hence two\nsystems are internally stable.\n", "  This paper reviews gravitational wave sources and their detection. One of the\nmost exciting potential sources of gravitational waves are coalescing binary\nblack hole systems. They can occur on all mass scales and be formed in numerous\nways, many of which are not understood. They are generally invisible in\nelectromagnetic waves, and they provide opportunities for deep investigation of\nEinstein's general theory of relativity. Sect. 1 of this paper considers ways\nthat binary black holes can be created in the universe, and includes the\nprediction that binary black hole coalescence events are likely to be the first\ngravitational wave sources to be detected. The next parts of this paper address\nthe detection of chirp waveforms from coalescence events in noisy data. Such\nanalysis is computationally intensive. Sect. 2 reviews a new and powerful\nmethod of signal detection based on the GPU-implemented summed parallel\ninfinite impulse response filters. Such filters are intrinsically real time\nalorithms, that can be used to rapidly detect and localise signals. Sect. 3 of\nthe paper reviews the use of GPU processors for rapid searching for\ngravitational wave bursts that can arise from black hole births and\ncoalescences. In sect. 4 the use of GPU processors to enable fast efficient\nstatistical significance testing of gravitational wave event candidates is\nreviewed. Sect. 5 of this paper addresses the method of multimessenger\nastronomy where the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational\nwave events can be used to identify sources, understand their nature and obtain\nmuch greater science outcomes from each identified event.\n", "  We study under which conditions a scalar particle is a viable WIMP Dark\nMatter candidate with Higgs and dilaton interactions. The theory is a composite\nHiggs model with top partial compositeness where both the Higgs and the Dark\nMatter candidate arise as pseudo Goldstone boson of the coset SO(6)/SO(5) from\na new physics sector. We highlight the role of the dilaton in direct and\nindirect searches. We find that a Dark Matter particle with a mass around\n200-400 GeV and a relatively light dilaton are a fair prediction of the model.\n", "  Urban population scaling of resource use, creativity metrics, and human\nbehaviors has been widely studied. These studies have not looked in detail at\nthe full range of human environments which represent a continuum from the most\nrural to heavily urban. We examined monthly police crime reports and property\ntransaction values across all 573 Parliamentary Constituencies in England and\nWales, finding that scaling models based on population density provided a far\nsuperior framework to traditional population scaling. We found four types of\nscaling: i) non-urban scaling in which a single power law explained the\nrelationship between the metrics and population density from the most rural to\nheavily urban environments, ii) accelerated scaling in which high population\ndensity was associated with an increase in the power-law exponent, iii)\ninhibited scaling where the urban environment resulted in a reduction in the\npower-law exponent but remained positive, and iv) collapsed scaling where\ntransition to the high density environment resulted in a negative scaling\nexponent. Urban scaling transitions, when observed, took place universally\nbetween 10 and 70 people per hectare. This study significantly refines our\nunderstanding of urban scaling, making clear that some of what has been\npreviously ascribed to urban environments may simply be the high density\nportion of non-urban scaling. It also makes clear that some metrics undergo\nspecific transitions in urban environments and these transitions can include\nnegative scaling exponents indicative of collapse. This study gives promise of\nfar more sophisticated scale adjusted metrics and indicates that studies of\nurban scaling represent a high density subsection of overall scaling\nrelationships which continue into rural environments.\n", "  We report on the phase diagram of competing magnetic interactions at\nnanoscale in engineered ultra-thin trilayer heterostructures of\nLaTiO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$/YTiO$_{3}$, in which the interfacial inversion symmetry\nis explicitly broken. Combined atomic layer resolved scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopy and electrical\ntransport have confirmed the formation of a spatially separated two-dimensional\nelectron liquid and high density two-dimensional localized magnetic moments at\nthe LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$/YTiO$_3$ interfaces, respectively.\nResonant soft X-ray linear dichroism spectroscopy has demonstrated the presence\nof orbital polarization of the conductive LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and localized\nSrTiO$_3$/YTiO$_3$ electrons. Our results provide a route with prospects for\nexploring new magnetic interfaces, designing tunable two-dimensional\n$d$-electron Kondo lattice, and potential spin Hall applications.\n", "  We discuss student difficulties in distinguishing between the physical space\nand Hilbert space and difficulties related to the Time-independent Schroedinger\nequation and measurements in quantum mechanics. These difficulties were\nidentified by administering written surveys and by conducting individual\ninterviews with students.\n", "  We are investigating cognitive issues in learning quantum mechanics in order\nto develop effective teaching and learning tools. The analysis of cognitive\nissues is particularly important for bridging the gap between the quantitative\nand conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics and for ensuring that the learning\ntools help students build a robust knowledge structure. We discuss the\ncognitive aspects of quantum mechanics that are similar or different from those\nof introductory physics and their implications for developing strategies to\nhelp students develop a good grasp of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We describe a study in which introductory physics students engage in\nreflection with peers about problem solving. The recitations for an\nintroductory physics course with 200 students were broken into the \"Peer\nReflection\" (PR) group and the traditional group. Each week in recitation,\nstudents in the PR group reflected in small teams on selected problems from the\nhomework and discussed why solutions of some students employed better problem\nsolving strategies than others. The graduate and undergraduate teaching\nassistants (TAs) in the PR group recitations provided guidance and coaching to\nhelp students learn effective problem solving heuristics. In the recitations\nfor the traditional group, students had the opportunity to ask the graduate TA\nquestions about the homework before they took a weekly quiz. The traditional\ngroup recitation quiz questions were similar to the homework questions selected\nfor \"peer reflection\" in the PR group recitations. As one measure of the impact\nof this intervention, we investigated how likely students were to draw diagrams\nto help with problem solving. On the final exam with only multiple-choice\nquestions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the traditional\ngroup, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since there was no\npartial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books, students did not\ndraw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and must value the use\nof diagrams for solving problems if they drew them. We also find that,\nregardless of whether the students belonged to the traditional or PR groups,\nthose who drew more diagrams for the multiple-choice questions outperformed\nthose who did not draw them.\n", "  We analyze online collective evaluation processes through positive and\nnegative votes in various social media. We find two modes of collective\nevaluations that stem from the existence of filter bubbles. Above a threshold\nof collective attention, negativity grows faster with positivity, as a sign of\nthe burst of a filter bubble when information reaches beyond the local social\ncontext of a user. We analyze how collectively evaluated content can reach\nlarge social contexts and create polarization, showing that emotions expressed\nthrough text play a key role in collective evaluation processes.\n", "  The Yang-Baxter equation is an important tool in theoretical physics, with\nmany applications in different domains that span from condensed matter to\nstring theory. Recently, the interest on the equation has increased due to its\nconnection to quantum information processing. It has been shown that the\nYang-Baxter equation is closely related to quantum entanglement and quantum\ncomputation. Therefore, owing to the broad relevance of this equation, besides\ntheoretical studies, it also became significant to pursue its experimental\nimplementation. Here, we show an experimental realization of the Yang-Baxter\nequation and verify its validity through a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\ninterferometric setup. Our experiment was performed on a liquid state\nIodotrifluoroethylene sample which contains molecules with three qubits. We use\nControlled-transfer gates that allow us to build a pseudo-pure state from which\nwe are able to apply a quantum information protocol that implements the\nYang-Baxter equation.\n", "  We investigate the difficulties that undergraduate students in quantum\nmechanics courses have in transferring learning from previous courses or within\nthe same course from one context to another by administering written tests and\nconducting individual interviews. Quantum mechanics is abstract and its\nparadigm is very different from the classical one. A good grasp of the\nprinciples of quantum mechanics requires creating and organizing a knowledge\nstructure consistent with the quantum postulates. Previously learned concepts\nsuch as the principle of superposition and probability can be useful in quantum\nmechanics if students are given opportunity to build associations between new\nand prior knowledge. We also discuss the need for better alignment between\nquantum mechanics and modern physics courses taken previously because\nsemi-classical models can impede internalization of the quantum paradigm in\nmore advanced courses.\n", "  Charge transfer states in organic semiconductors play crucial roles in\nprocesses such as singlet fission and exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor\ninterfaces. Recently, a time-resolved spectroscopy study of\ndinaphtho[2,3-b:2'3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (DNTT) thin films provided\nevidence for the formation of mixed Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons after\nthe photoexcitation. Here we investigate optical properties and excitation\ndynamics of the DNTT thin films by combining ab initio calculations and a\nstochastic Schrodinger equation. Our theory predicts that the low-energy\nFrenkel exciton band consists of 8 to 47% CT character. The quantum dynamics\nsimulations show coherent dynamics of Frenkel and CT states in 50 fs after the\noptical excitation. We demonstrate the role of charge delocalization and\nlocalization in the mixing of CT states with Frenkel excitons as well as the\nrole of their decoherence.\n", "  In this study, we examine introductory physics students' ability to perform\nanalogical reasoning between two isomorphic problems which employ the same\nunderlying physics principles but have different surface features. Three\nhundred and sixty two students from a calculus-based and an algebra-based\nintroductory physics course were given a quiz in the recitation in which they\nhad to first learn from a solved problem provided and take advantage of what\nthey learned from it to solve another problem (which we call the quiz problem)\nwhich was isomorphic. Previous research suggests that the multiple-concept quiz\nproblem is challenging for introductory students. Students in different\nrecitation classes received different interventions in order to help them\ndiscern and exploit the underlying similarities of the isomorphic solved and\nquiz problems. We also conducted think-aloud interviews with four introductory\nstudents in order to understand in-depth the difficulties they had and explore\nstrategies to provide better scaffolding. We found that most students were able\nto learn from the solved problem to some extent with the scaffolding provided\nand invoke the relevant principles in the quiz problem. However, they were not\nnecessarily able to apply the principles correctly. Research suggests that more\nscaffolding is needed to help students in applying these principles\nappropriately. We outline a few possible strategies for future investigation.\n", "  It is well-known that introductory physics students often have alternative\nconceptions that are inconsistent with established physical principles and\nconcepts. Invoking alternative conceptions in quantitative problem-solving\nprocess can derail the entire process. In order to help students solve\nquantitative problems involving strong alternative conceptions correctly,\nappropriate scaffolding support can be helpful. The goal of this study is to\nexamine how different scaffolding supports involving analogical problem solving\ninfluence introductory physics students' performance on a target quantitative\nproblem in a situation where many students' solution process is derailed due to\nalternative conceptions. Three different scaffolding supports were designed and\nimplemented in calculus-based and algebra-based introductory physics courses to\nevaluate the level of scaffolding needed to help students learn from an\nanalogical problem that is similar in the underlying principles but for which\nthe problem solving process is not derailed by alternative conceptions. We\nfound that for the quantitative problem involving strong alternative\nconceptions, simply guiding students to work through the solution of the\nanalogical problem first was not enough to help most students discern the\nsimilarity between the two problems. However, if additional scaffolding\nsupports that directly helped students examine and repair their knowledge\nelements involving alternative conceptions were provided, students were more\nlikely to discern the underlying similarities between the problems and avoid\ngetting derailed by alternative conceptions when solving the targeted problem.\nWe also found that some scaffolding supports were more effective in the\ncalculus-based course than in the algebra-based course. This finding emphasizes\nthe fact that appropriate scaffolding support must be determined via research\nin order to be effective.\n", "  We consider a convex curve $\\gamma$ lying on the Sphere or Hyperbolic plane.\nWe study the problem of existence of polynomial in velocities integrals for\nBirkhoff billiard inside the domain bounded by $\\gamma$. We extend the result\nby S. Bolotin (1992) and get new obstructions on polynomial integrability in\nterms of the dual curve $\\Gamma$. We follow a method which was introduced by S.\nTabachnikov for Outer billiards in the plane and was applied later on in our\nrecent paper to Birkhoff billiards with the help of a new the so called Angular\nbilliard.\n", "  In this study, we examine introductory physics students' ability to perform\nanalogical reasoning between two isomorphic problems which employ the same\nunderlying physics principles but have different surface features. Three\nhundred and eighty two students from a calculus-based and an algebra-based\nintroductory physics course were asked to learn from a solved problem provided\nand take advantage of what they learned from it to solve another isomorphic\nproblem (which we call the quiz problem). The solved problem provided has two\nsub-problems while the quiz problem has three sub-problems, which is known to\nbe challenging for introductory students from previous research. In addition to\nthe solved problem, students also received extra scaffolding supports that were\nintended to help them discern and exploit the underlying similarities of the\nisomorphic solved and quiz problems. The results suggest that students had\ngreat difficulty in transferring what they learned from a 2-step problem to a\n3-step problem. Although most students were able to learn from the solved\nproblem to some extent with the scaffolding provided and invoke the relevant\nprinciples in the quiz problem, they were not necessarily able to apply the\nprinciples correctly. We also conducted think-aloud interviews with 6\nintroductory students in order to understand in-depth the difficulties they had\nand explore strategies to provide better scaffolding. The interviews suggest\nthat students often superficially mapped the principles employed in the solved\nproblem to the quiz problem without necessarily understanding the governing\nconditions underlying each principle and examining the applicability of the\nprinciple in the new situation in an in-depth manner. Findings suggest that\nmore scaffolding is needed to help students in transferring from a two-step\nproblem to a three step problem and applying the physics principles\nappropriately.\n", "  Magnetism of 3d transition metals at high density has always received wide\ninterest due to existence of magnetism at the core of the Earth. For\nferromagnetic cobalt, although there is a theoretical prediction that its\nmagnetic moment would vanish when the density increases to about 1.4 times the\nnormal value, so far there is no experimental evidence. We have discovered the\nexistence of ultrathin superdense nonmagnetic cobalt layers in a\npolycrystalline cobalt thin film. The densities of these layers are about\n1.3-1.4 times the normal density of Co. This has been revealed by X-ray\nreflectometry experiments, which provide a depth profile of the electron\nscattering length density, and corroborated by polarized neutron reflectometry\n(PNR) experiments. The superdense Co layer has an fcc structure, unlike hcp\nstructure for bulk Co, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The\nmagnetic depth profile, obtained by PNR, shows that the superdense Co layers at\nthe film-substrate interface and near the top of the film are nonmagnetic. The\nmajor part of the Co film has the usual density and magnetic moment.\n", "  We describe the difficulties advanced undergraduate and graduate students\nhave with quantum measurement. To reduce these difficulties, we have developed\nresearch-based learning tools such as the Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial\n(QuILT) and peer instruction tools. A preliminary evaluation shows that these\nlearning tools are effective in improving students' understanding of concepts\nrelated to quantum measurement.\n", "  As part of a larger study to understand instructors' considerations regarding\nthe learning and teaching of problem solving in an introductory physics course,\nwe investigated beliefs of first-year graduate teaching assistants (TAs)\nregarding the use of example solutions in introductory physics. In particular,\nwe examine how the goal of promoting expert-like problem solving is manifested\nin the considerations of graduate TAs choices of example solutions. Twenty-four\nfirst-year graduate TAs were asked to discuss their goals for presenting\nexample solutions to students. They were also provided with different example\nsolutions and asked to discuss their preferences for prominent solution\nfeatures. TAs' awareness, preferences and actual practices related to solution\nfeatures were examined in light of recommendations from the literature for the\nmodeling of expert-like problem solving approaches. The study concludes that\nthe goal of helping students develop an expert-like problem solving approach\nunderlies many TAs' considerations for the use of example solutions. TAs,\nhowever, do not notice and do not use many features described in the research\nliterature as supportive of this goal. A possible explanation for this gap\nbetween their belief and practices is that these features conflict with another\npowerful set of values concerned with keeping students engaged, setting\nadequate standards, as well as pragmatic considerations such as time\nrequirements and the assignment of grades.\n", "  Based on the crystal structures of the previously proposed low energy\nphosphorene allotropes {\\eta}-P and {\\theta}-P (Nano. Lett. 2015, 15, 3557), we\npropose five new structural stable phosphorene boys (XX-XY or XY-XY) and girls\n(XX-XX) through gene (XY from {\\eta}-P and XX from {\\theta}-P) recombination\nmethods. All of these five new phosphorene allotropes are obviously different\nfrom their parents, showing very different and fascinating two-dimensional\npatterns between each other. The dynamical stabilities of these phosphorene\nallotropes are confirmed positive and some of them are confirmed energetically\nmore favorable than their parents ({\\eta}-P and {\\theta}-P). Especially, the\nXX-XX type girl G1-P is confirmed energetically more favorable than all the\npreviously proposed phosphorene allotropes, including black phosphorene\n({\\alpha}-P, ACS Nano, 2014, 8, 4033) and blue phosphorene ({\\beta}-P, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 2014, 112, 176802), which is expected to be synthesized in future\nexperiment through vapor deposition. Our results show that such a new promising\nphosphorene allotrope G1-P is an excellent candidate for potential applications\nin nano-electronics according to its middle band gap about 1.58 eV from\nDFT-HSE06 calculation.\n", "  A new detection scheme capable of acquiring the entire spatiotemporal profile\nof terahertz radiation in a single laser shot is being demonstrated. The design\nallows temporal resolution of the order of transform-limited pulse duration of\nthe probe, which is an absolute benefit over the compromised resolution of\notherwise prevalent single-shot detection schemes based on spectral encoding of\nterahertz waveform on a temporally chirped readout pulse. This makes the\ntechnique perfectly suitable for sensitive spectroscopy studies. The single\nshot detection technique presented here relies on space-to-time mapping of\nterahertz temporal profile by use of a converging probe intensity front. The\npresent approach does not require any specialized optics and is implemented\nusing very straightforward alignment procedure. It has shown to reproduce the\ntemporal waveform of terahertz radiation faithfully.\n", "  Identifying key agents for the transmission of diseases (ideas, technology,\netc.) across social networks has predominantly relied on measures of centrality\non a static base network or a temporally flattened graph of agent interactions.\nVarious measures have been proposed as the best trackers of influence, such as\ndegree centrality, betweenness, and $k$-shell, depending on the structure of\nthe connectivity. We consider SIR and SIS propagation dynamics on a\ntemporally-extruded network of observed interactions and measure the\nconditional marginal spread as the change in the magnitude of the infection\ngiven the removal of each agent at each time: its temporal knockout (TKO)\nscore. We argue that the exhaustive approach of the TKO score makes it an\neffective benchmark measure for evaluating the accuracy of other, often more\npractical, measures of influence. We find that none of the common network\nmeasures applied to the induced flat graphs are accurate predictors of network\npropagation influence on the systems studied; however, temporal networks and\nthe TKO measure provide the requisite targets for the hunt for effective\npredictive measures.\n", "  A self-consistent system of nonlinear spinor and Bianchi type-V anisotropic\ngravitational fields are investigated. It is found that the presence of\nnontrivial non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor of the spinor\nfield imposes some severe restrictions to the system. As a result two different\nsolutions are found. In one case the metric functions are similar to each\nother, i.e., $a_1 \\sim a_2 \\sim a_3$ and the spinor mass and spinor field\nnonlinearity do not disappear from the system. In this case the spacetime\nexpands with acceleration in case of a positive self-coupling constant\n$\\lambda$. A negative $\\lambda$ gives rise to a cyclic or periodical mode of\nexpansion. In the second case the spinor mass and the spinor field nonlinearity\nvanish and the Universe expands linearly with time.\n", "  The gravity-driven motion of rigid particles in a viscous fluid is relevant\nin many natural and industrial processes, yet this has mainly been investigated\nfor spherical particles. We therefore consider the sedimentation of\nnon-spherical (spheroidal) isolated and particle pairs in a viscous fluid via\nnumerical simulations using the Immersed Boundary Method. The simulations\nperformed here show that the critical Galileo number for the onset of secondary\nmotions decreases as the spheroid aspect ratio departs from 1. Above this\ncritical threshold, oblate particles perform a zigzagging motion whereas\nprolate particles rotate around the vertical axis while having their broad side\nfacing the falling direction. Instabilities of the vortices in the wake follow\nwhen farther increasing the Galileo number. We also study the\ndrafting-kissing-tumbling associated with the settling of particle pairs. We\nfind that the interaction time increases significantly for non-spherical\nparticles and, more interestingly, spheroidal particles are attracted from\nlarger lateral displacements. This has important implications for the\nestimation of collision kernels and can result in increasing clustering in\nsuspensions of sedimenting spheroids.\n", "  A generalization of the recently discovered cooperative internal conversion\nprocess is investigated theoretically. In the cooperative internal conversion\nprocess by proton exchange investigated the coupling of bound-free electron and\nproton transitions due to the dipole term of their Coulomb interaction permits\ncooperation of two nuclei leading to proton exchange and an electron emission.\nGeneral expression of the cross section of the process obtained in the one\nparticle spherical nuclear shell model is presented. As a numerical example the\ncooperative internal conversion process by proton exchange in $Al$ is dealt\nwith. As a further generalization, cooperative internal conversion process by\nheavy charged particle exchange and as an example of it the cooperative\ninternal conversion process by triton exchange is discussed. The process is\nalso connected to the field of nuclear waste disposal.\n", "  This paper shall provide a summary of not yet published technical innovations\nto the GREGOR Fabry-Perot Interferometer (GFPI) at the 1.5m GREGOR Solar\nTelescope (Europe's largest solar telescope) that I implemented in 2013 as the\nInstrument Scientist of the GFPI. It also represents an overview of important\nand not yet published observational results that I achieved with the GFPI in\n2013. The results and achievements can be considered a milestone in the further\ndevelopment, scientific verification and final acceptance of this instrument.\nThe instrument is now in operation and employed by the international scientific\ncommunity.\n", "  Single-domain, epitaxially-grown Nb(110)/Au(111)/Nb(110) trilayers are\nstudied in order to elucidate the superconducting proximity effect in the\nAu(111) layer. The critical current density, superconducting coherence length,\nand superconducting transition temperature, all show a non-monotonic dependence\non the thickness of the Au layer. The analysis of the experimental data\nreasonably argues that a form of order-parameter oscillation is intrinsic to\nthe proximity-induced Cooper pairs in the Au layer. We find that relative phase\nof the superconducting order parameter in the two Nb(110) layers changes sign\nas a function of Au(111) layer thickness tAu, offering a route to achieving a\n{\\pi} junction for 0.94 nm<tAu<1.88 nm.\n", "  Copper oxide nanostructures with spherical (0D), needle (1D) and hierarchical\ncauliflower (3D) morphologies are used to demonstrate superhydrophobic,\nsuperoleophobic and slippery behavior. These nanostructures are synthesized on\ngalvanized steel substrates using a simple chemical bath deposition method by\ntuning precursor concentration. Subsequent coating of low surface energy\npolymer, polydimethylsiloxane, results in superhydrophobicity with water\ncontact angle ~160(2){\\deg} and critical sliding angle ~2{\\deg}. When\nfunctionalized with low-surface energy perfluoroalkyl silane, these surfaces\ndisplay high repellency for low surface tension oils and hydrocarbons. Among\nthem, the hierarchical cauliflower morphology exhibits better re-entrant\nstructure thus show the best superoleophobicity with 149{\\deg} contact angle\nfor dodecane having surface tension 25.3 mNm-1. If these nanostructured\nsubstrates are infused with lubricant Silicone oil, they show excellent\nslippery behavior for water drops. Due to the lubricating nature of Silicone\noil, the Silicone oil infused slippery surfaces (SOIS) show low contact angle\nhysteresis (~2{\\deg}) and critical tilt angle (~2{\\deg}). The hierarchical\ncauliflower nanostrcuture exhibit better slippery characteristics and stability\ncompared to the other nanostructured surfaces.\n", "  Magnetoresistance loops under in-plane applied field were measured on\nperpendicularly magnetized magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) pillars with nominal\ndiameters ranging from 50 to 150 nm. By fitting the hard-axis magnetoresistance\nloops to an analytical model, the effective anisotropy fields in both free and\nreference layers were derived and their variations in temperature range between\n340K and 5K were determined. It is found that an accurate fitting is possible\nonly if a second-order anisotropy term of the form $-K_{2}cos^4{\\theta}$, is\nadded to the fitting model. This higher order contribution exists both in the\nfree and reference layers and its sign is opposite to that of the first order\nanisotropy constant, $K_{1}$. At room temperatures the estimated $-K_{2}/K_{1}$\nratios are 0.1 and 0.24 for the free and reference layers, respectively. The\nratio is more than doubled at low temperatures altering the ground state of the\nreference layer from 'easy-axis' to 'easy-cone' regime. Easy-cone state has\nclear signatures in the shape of the hard-axis magnetoresistance loops. The\nsame behavior was observed in all measured devices regardless of their\ndiameter. The existence of this higher order anisotropy was confirmed\nexperimentally on FeCoB/MgO sheet films by ferromagnetic resonance technique.\nIt is of interfacial nature and is believed to be linked to spatial\nfluctuations at the nanoscale of the anisotropy parameter at the FeCoB/MgO\ninterface, in agreement with Dieny-Vedyayev model.\n", "  Recent data for $\\eta$ and $\\eta\\prime$ photoproduction on protons obtained\nby the A2 Collaboration at MAMI are presented. The total cross section for\n$\\eta$ photoproduction demonstrates a cusp at the energy corresponding to the\n$\\eta\\prime$ threshold. The new data and existing data from GRAAL, CBELSA/TAPS,\nand CLAS collaborations have been analyzed by an expansion in terms of\nassociated Legendre polynomials. %A Legendre decomposition shows the\nsensitivity to small partial-wave contributions. The isobar model $\\eta$MAID\nupdated with $\\eta \\prime$ channel and new resonances have been used to fit the\nnew data. The new solution $\\eta$MAID-2015 reasonably good describes the data\nin the photon beam energy region up to 3.7 GeV.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to draw attention of readers to a problem of\npossible differences in generation of magnetic storms induced by various large\nscale solar wind (SW) streams: CIR, Sheath and ICME (including MC and Ejecta).\nRecently we showed that when using a modification of formula by Burton et al.\n[1975] for connection of interplanetary conditions with Dst and Dst* indices\nthe efficiency of storm generation by Sheath and CIR is about 50 percent higher\nthan generation by ICME [Nikolaeva et al., 2013, 2015]. In the literature there\nare many various functions coupling (FC) various interplanetary parameters with\nmagnetospheric state. In this work we study the efficiency of main phase storm\ngeneration by different SW streams when using 12 another FCs on the basis of\nOMNI data during 1976 ... 2000. Obtained results show that for most part of FCs\nSheaths have the highest efficiency and MCs have the lowest efficiency in\naccordance with our previous results. The reliability of the obtained data and\npossible reasons of divergences for various FCs and various SW types require\nfurther researches.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the Schrodinger equation with a general kinetic\nenergy operator. The conservation law is proved and the probability continuity\nequation is deducted in a general sense. Examples with a Hermitian kinetic\nenergy operator include the standard Schrodinger equation, the relativistic\nSchrodinger equation, the fractional Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation,\nand the deformed Schrodinger equation. We reveal that the Klein-Gordon equation\nhas a hidden non-Hermitian kinetic energy operator. The probability continuity\nequation with sources indicates that there exists a different way of\nprobability transportation, which is probability teleportation. An average\nformula is deducted from the relativistic Schrodinger equation, the Dirac\nequation, and the K-G equation.\n", "  We show how the Dubinin isotherm and its extensions can be related to the\nisotherms derived from the general BrouersSotolongo isotherm. We compare them\nusing benzene vapor adsorbed on activated carbon data from one of the original\nDubinin paper. We use the same procedure to analyze data from the thesis of\nMarquezMontesino on the adsorption on activated carbon prepared from pinus\ncaribaea saw dust. We conclude by proposing a simple methodology to determine\nthe macroscopic information given by genuine statistical isotherms.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between post-translational folding and escape of\ntwo small single-domain proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnel by using Langevin\ndynamics with coarse-grained models. It is shown that at temperatures lower or\nnear the temperature of the fastest folding, folding proceeds concomitantly\nwith the escape process, resulting in vectorial folding and enhancement of\nfoldability of nascent proteins. The concomitance between the two processes,\nhowever, deteriorates as temperature increases. Our folding simulations as well\nas free energy calculation by using umbrella sampling show that, at low\ntemperatures, folding at the tunnel follows one or two specific pathways\nwithout kinetic traps. It is shown that the escape time can be mapped to a\none-dimensional diffusion model with two different regimes for temperatures\nabove and below the folding transition temperature. Attractive interactions\nbetween amino acids and attractive sites on the tunnel wall lead to a free\nenergy barrier along the escape route of protein. It is suggested that this\nbarrier slows down the escape process and consequently promotes correct folding\nof the released nascent protein.\n", "  The great interest to the two and three dimensionally periodic structures,\ncalled photonic crystals (PCs), has begun with the pioneer works of\nYablonovitch and John as one can efficiently control the propagation of the\nelectromagnetic (EM) waves in the same manner with semiconductors that affect\nthe electron conduction. One of the main peculiar properties of PCs is that\nthey have photonic band gap in the transmission spectrum similar to electronic\nband gap and hence, they are able to prevent the light to propagate in certain\nfrequency regions irrespective of the propagation direction in space. Inside\nthe band gaps, neither optical modes nor spontaneous emissions exist. Breaking\nthe rotational and mirror symmetries of PC unit cells provides rich dispersive\nfeatures such as tilted self-collimation, and wavelength de-multiplexing\neffects. Another important issue in PC designs is that it is feasible to design\ngraded index medium if the parameters of the two dimensional PCs is\nintentionally rearranged. That type of configuration is known as Graded index\nphotonic crystals (GRIN PCs). The implementations of GRIN via periodic\nstructures provide great flexibilities in terms of designing different index\ngradient and photonic integrated circuit components such as couplers, lenses,\nand mode order converters. It is crucial to deliver optical signal without any\nloss for the long distances where light diffraction plays an important role.\nHence, dealing with the alternative solution to light diffraction phenomena\nusing 2D axicon shape annular type photonic structure is another topic of this\nthesis. In addition to conventional photonic all dielectric structures, we have\nproposed gain-loss modulated parity-time (PT-) symmetric photonic structures to\nobtain strong asymmetric light transmission close to the crystallographic\nresonances or, equivalently, close to high-symmetry points.\n", "  Despite the common misconception of nearly static organisms, plants do\ninteract continuously with the environment and with each other. It is fair to\nassume that during their evolution they developed particular features to\novercome problems and to exploit possibilities from environment. In this paper\nwe introduce various quantitative measures based on recent advancements in\ncomplex network theory that allow to measure the effective similarities of\nvarious species. By using this approach on the similarity in fruit-typology\necological traits we obtain a clear plant classification in a way similar to\ntraditional taxonomic classification. This result is not trivial, since a\nsimilar analysis done on the basis of diaspore morphological properties do not\nprovide any clear parameter to classify plants species. Complex network theory\ncan then be used in order to determine which feature amongst many can be used\nto distinguish scope and possibly evolution of plants. Future uses of this\napproach range from functional classification to quantitative determination of\nplant communities in nature.\n", "  The paper presents a nonlinear state-feedback control design approach for\nlong-time average cost control, where the control effort is assumed to be\nexpensive. The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite\nprogramming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand\nside is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key\nidea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al., Phil. Trans.\nR. Soc. A, 372, 2014), is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost\nfunction involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the\nupper bound of the same average. As such, controller design requires the\nsimultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function,\nsimilar to a Lyapunov function. The present paper introduces a method resolving\nthe well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. The method\nis based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it\nfollows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic\noptimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial\ncoefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions\nof state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is\napplied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that\nmitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar\nregime via rotary oscillations. Control results on a reduced-order model of the\nactuated wake and in direct numerical simulation are reported.\n", "  We study and predict the interfacial tension, solubility parameters and\nFlory-Huggins parameters of binary mixtures as functions of pressure and\ntemperature, using multiscale numerical simulation. A mesoscopic approach is\nproposed for simulating the pressure dependence of the interfacial tension for\nbinary mixtures, at different temperatures, using classical Dissipative\nParticle Dynamics (DPD). The thermodynamic properties of real systems are\nreproduced via the parametrization of the repulsive interaction parameters as\nfunctions of pressure and temperature via Molecular Dynamics simulations. Using\nthis methodology, we calculate and analyze the cohesive density energy and the\nsolubility parameters of different species obtaining excellent agreement with\nreported experimental behavior. The pressure- and temperature-dependent\nFlory-Huggins and repulsive DPD interaction parameters for binary mixtures are\nalso obtained and validated against experimental data. This multiscale\nmethodology offers the benefit of being applicable for any species and under\ndifficult or non-feasible experimental conditions, at a relatively low\ncomputational cost.\n", "  This paper reviews the 1994 proof that the spectral gap of Hamiltonian\nquantum systems capable of universal computation is uncomputable.\n", "  Quantitative analysis of discontinuity of basic characteristics of quantum\nstates and channels is presented.\n  First we consider general estimates for discontinuity jump (loss) of the von\nNeumann entropy for a given converging sequence of states. It is shown, in\nparticular, that for any sequence the loss of entropy is upper bounded by the\nloss of mean energy (with the coefficient characterizing Hamiltonian of a\nsystem).\n  Then we prove that discontinuity jumps of several correlation and\nentanglement measures in composite quantum systems are upper bounded by loss of\none of the marginal entropies (with a corresponding coefficient).\n  We also analyse discontinuity of the output entropy of a quantum operation\nand of basic information charateristics of a quantum channel with respect to\nsimultaneous variations of an input state and of a channel.\n", "  A brief overview of mesoscopic modelling via dissipative particle dynamics is\npresented, with emphasis on the appropriate parametrisation and how to\ncalculate the relevant parameters for given realistic systems. The dependence\non concentration and temperature of the interaction parameters is also\nconsidered, as well as some applications.\n", "  Perfect single-crystal neutron interferometers are adversely sensitive to\nenvironmental disturbances, particularly mechanical vibrations. The sensitivity\nto vibrations results from the slow velocity of thermal neutrons and the long\nmeasurement time that are encountered in a typical experiment. Consequently, to\nachieve a good interference solutions for reducing vibration other than those\nnormally used in optical experiments must be explored. Here we introduce a\ngeometry for a neutron interferometer that is less sensitive to low-frequency\nvibrations. This design may be compared with both dynamical decoupling methods\nand decoherence-free subspaces that are described in quantum information\nprocessing. By removing the need for bulky vibration isolation setups, this\ndesign will make it easier to adopt neutron interferometry to a wide range of\napplications and increase its sensitivity.\n", "  Over the past 10 years Bayesian methods have rapidly grown more popular as\nseveral computationally intensive statistical algorithms have become feasible\nwith increased computer power. In this paper, we begin with a general\ndescription of the Bayesian paradigm for statistical inference and the various\nstate-of-the-art model fitting techniques that we employ (e.g., Gibbs sampler\nand Metropolis- Hastings). These algorithms are very flexible and can be used\nto fit models that account for the highly hierarchical structure inherent in\nthe collection of high-quality spectra and thus can keep pace with the\naccelerating progress of new space telescope designs. The methods we develop,\nwhich will soon be available in the CIAO software package, explicitly model\nphoton arrivals as a Poisson process and, thus, have no difficulty with high\nresolution low count X-ray and gamma-ray data. We expect these methods to be\nuseful not only for the recently launched Chandra X-ray observatory and XMM but\nalso new generation telescopes such as Constellation X, GLAST, etc. In the\ncontext of two examples (Quasar S5 0014+813 and Hybrid-Chromosphere Supergiant\nStar alpha TrA) we illustrate a new highly structured model and how Bayesian\nposterior sampling can be used to compute estimates, error bars, and credible\nintervals for the various model parameters.\n", "  The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the related $F$ test, do not (even\nasymptotically) adhere to their nominal $\\chi^2$ and $F$ distributions in many\nstatistical tests common in astrophysics, thereby casting many marginal line or\nsource detections and non-detections into doubt. Although there are many\nlegitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be\nimpossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has\nbecome common practice to use the LRT or the $F$ test for detecting a line in a\nspectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain\nrequired regularity conditions. In these and other settings that involve\ntesting a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, {\\it\ncontrary to common practice, the nominal $\\chi^2$ distribution for the LRT or\nthe $F$ distribution for the $F$ test should not be used}. In this paper, we\ncharacterize an important class of problems where the LRT and the $F$ test fail\nand illustrate this non-standard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible\nacceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive\nprobability-values. We present this method in some detail, as it is a simple,\nrobust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using\nthe gamma-ray burst of May 8, 1997 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of\nan Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation.\n", "  We analyze the effectiveness of working in pairs on the Conceptual Survey of\nElectricity and Magnetism test in a calculus-based introductory physics course.\nThe group performance shows large normalized gain and evidence for\nco-construction. We discuss the effect of pairing students with different\nindividual achievements.\n", "  The growth by molecular diffusion (Reynold's number (Re) = 0) of ice crystals\nof different shapes, represented by the Sherwood number (Sh) is calculated\nusing an electrical analog which relates capacity (C) to Sh. Although\nexperimental data on dependence of Sh on Re for various ice crystals of\ninterest in cloud physics have been previously obtained, extrapolation of the\ndata to smaller particles for Re=0 has been unreliable. We present a simple\ncomputational algorithm for computing Sh at Re=0 for various crystals of\ninterest, which will allow proper coverage over the whole Re range applicable\nto ice crystals. The method we present can be applied to any crystal of\nrectilinear shape. The approach was as follows: the model crystal is positioned\nin a box and an electric field is applied between the crystal and the box,\nsimulating the initial growth stage of ice crystals. Using a finite Cartesian\ngrid system of variable lattice separations, the corners of ice crystal are\nassigned to particular lattice points, thereby defining the geometry of the\ncrystal. A discrete version of Gauss' flux law is developed and used for this\nlattice system. Sh (at Re=0) is obtained for hexagonal plates, hexagonal\ncolumns, broad branched crystals, stellar crystals, and capped columns. Our\ncalculations reveal that our simple computational algorithm provides the values\nof Sh for these shapes to within 5% error from the values obtained through\nestimates in previous studies.\n", "  A program for molecular calculations with B functions is reported and its\nperformance is analyzed. All the one- and two-center integrals, and the\nthree-center nuclear attraction integrals are computed by direct procedures,\nusing previously developed algorithms. The three- and four-center electron\nrepulsion integrals are computed by means of Gaussian expansions of the B\nfunctions. A new procedure for obtaining these expansions is also reported.\nSome results on full molecular calculations are included to show the\ncapabilities of the program and the quality of the B functions to represent the\nelectronic functions in molecules.\n"]}
