The model equation has been\nproposed by Kuznetsov and the attractor seems to be of the Smale-Williams type.\n", "  Photon sources are fundamental components for any quantum photonic\ntechnology. The ability to generate high count-rate and low-noise correlated\nphoton pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion using bulk crystals has\nbeen the cornerstone of modern quantum optics. However, future practical\nquantum technologies will require a scalable integration approach, and\nwaveguide-based photon sources with high-count rate and low-noise\ncharacteristics will be an essential part of chip-based quantum technologies.\nHere, we demonstrate photon pair generation through spontaneous four-wave\nmixing in a silicon micro-ring resonator, reporting a maximum\ncoincidence-to-accidental (CAR) ratio of 602 (+-) 37, and a maximum photon pair\ngeneration rate of 123 MHz (+-) 11 KHz. To overcome free-carrier related\nperformance degradations we have investigated reverse biased p-i-n structures,\ndemonstrating an improvement in the pair generation rate by a factor of up to\n2, with negligible impact on CAR.\n", "  The introduction of active learning into physics education at the university\nlevel may be crucial for improved learning outcomes. In UNIST (Ulsan National\nInstitute of Science and Technology), introductory physics has been redesigned\nto reduce the time spent on unidirectional lectures, while increasing the time\ndevoted to classroom activities which facilitate the interaction between\nstudents and the instructors, as well as increasing the interaction between\nstudent peers. We measured student achievement and the degree of student\nsatisfaction in order to evaluate the impact of the new learning methods on\nstudent learning outcomes. In the first semester, we redesigned a class of N_I\n= 176 students with a reduction in lecture hours and replaced them with\npre-class self studies and in-class problem solving, and compared it with the\ntraditional lecture based class of N_II = 161 students. We found that even\nthough the midterm results of two classes were similar, the final average score\nof the redesigned class was 10 points higher than the traditional class. In the\nsecond semester, we applied our strategy to three classes but controlled the\nproportion of face-to-face lectures to the entire class meeting hours\nsystematically to be 1/3 in `Class 1' of N1 = 160 students, 1/2 in 'Class 2' of\nN2 = 176 students and 2/3 in `Class 3' of N3 = 177 students. (Abridged)\n", "  We study the effect of disorder in strongly interacting small atomic chains.\nUsing the Kotliar- Ruckenstein slave-boson approach we diagonalize the\nHamiltonian via scattering matrix theory. We numerically solve the Kondo\ntransmission and the slave-boson parameters that allow us to calculate the\nKondo temperature. We demonstrate that in the weak disorder regime, disorder in\nthe energy levels of the dopants induces a non-screened disorder in the Kondo\ncouplings of the atoms. We show that disorder increases the Kondo temperature\nof a perfect chain. We find that this disorder in the couplings comes from a\nlocal distribution of Kondo temperatures along the chain. We propose two\nexperimental setups where the impact of local Kondo temperatures can be\nobserved.\n", "  We endow the set of isomorphic classes of matroids with a new Hopf algebra\nstructure, in which the coproduct is implemented via the combinatorial\noperations of restriction and deletion. We also initiate the investigation of\ndendriform coalgebra structures on matroids and introduce a monomial invariant\nwhich satisfy a convolution identity with respect to restriction and deletion.\n", "  We consider real and complex Clifford algebras of arbitrary even and odd\ndimensions and prove generalizations of Pauli's theorem for two sets of\nClifford algebra elements that satisfy the main anticommutative conditions. In\nour proof we use some special operators - generalized Reynolds operators. This\nmethod allows us to obtain an algorithm to compute elements that connect two\ndifferent sets of Clifford algebra elements.\n", "  Since the three dimensional (3D) Dirac semi-metal Cd$_3$As$_2$ exists close\nto topological phase boundaries, in principle it should be possible to drive it\ninto exotic new phases, like topological superconductors, by breaking certain\nsymmetries. Here we show that the mesoscopic point-contacts between silver (Ag)\nand Cd$_3$As$_2$ exhibit superconductivity up to a critical temperature (onset)\nof 6 K while neither Cd$_3$As$_2$ nor Ag are superconductors. A gap amplitude\nof 6.5 meV is measured spectroscopically in this phase that varies weakly with\ntemperature and survives up to a remarkably high temperature of 13 K indicating\nthe presence of a robust normal-state pseudogap. The observations indicate the\nemergence of a new unconventional superconducting phase that exists only in a\nquantum mechanically confined region under a point-contact between a Dirac\nsemi-metal and a normal metal.\n", "  Entanglement--one of the most delicate phenomena in nature--is an essential\nresource for quantum information applications. Large entangled cluster states\nhave been predicted to enable universal quantum computation, with the required\nsingle- qubit measurements readily implemented with photons. Useful large-scale\nsystems must generate and control qubit entanglement on-chip, where quantum\ninformation is naturally encoded in photon path. Here we report a silicon\nphotonic chip which integrates resonant-enhanced sources, filters, and\nreconfigurable optics to generate a path-entangled two-qubit state--the\nsmallest non-trivial cluster state--and analyse its entanglement. We show that\nring-resonator-based spontaneous four-wave mixing sources can be made highly\nindistinguishable, despite their nonlinear dynamics, and the first evidence\nthat their frequency correlations are small, as predicted. We use quantum state\ntomography, and the strict Bell-CHSH inequality to quantify entanglement in the\ndevice, confirming its high performance. This work integrates essential\ncomponents for building devices and systems to harness quantum entanglement on\nthe large scale.\n", "  The single-particle density is the most basic quantity that can be calculated\nfrom a given many-body wave function. It provides the probability to find a\nparticle at a given position when the average over many realizations of an\nexperiment is taken. However, the outcome of single experimental shots of\nultracold atom experiments is determined by the $N$-particle probability\ndensity. This difference can lead to surprising results. For example,\nindependent Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with definite particle numbers\nform interference fringes even though no fringes would be expected based on the\nsingle-particle density [1-4]. By drawing random deviates from the $N$-particle\nprobability density single experimental shots can be simulated from first\nprinciples [1, 3, 5]. However, obtaining expressions for the $N$-particle\nprobability density of realistic time-dependent many-body systems has so far\nbeen elusive. Here, we show how single experimental shots of general ultracold\nbosonic systems can be simulated based on numerical solutions of the many-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. We show how full counting distributions of observables\ninvolving any number of particles can be obtained and how correlation functions\nof any order can be evaluated. As examples we show the appearance of\ninterference fringes in interacting independent BECs, fluctuations in the\ncollisions of strongly attractive BECs, the appearance of randomly fluctuating\nvortices in rotating systems and the center of mass fluctuations of attractive\nBECs in a harmonic trap. The method described is broadly applicable to bosonic\nmany-body systems whose phenomenology is driven by information beyond what is\ntypically available in low-order correlation functions.\n", "  The synthesis of ultra-long lived acoustic phonons in a variety of materials\nand device geometries could enable a range of new coherent information\nprocessing and sensing technologies; many forms of phonon dissipation pose a\nbarrier to this goal. We explore linear and nonlinear contributions to phonon\ndissipation in silica at cryogenic temperatures using fiber-optic structures\nthat tightly confine both photons and phonons to the fiber-optic core. When\nimmersed in helium, this fiber system supports nearly perfect guidance of 9 GHz\nacoustic phonons; strong electrostrictively mediated photon-phonon coupling (or\nguided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering) permits a flexible form of\nlaser-based phonon spectroscopy. Through linear and nonlinear phonon\nspectroscopy, we isolate the effects of disorder-induced two-level tunneling\nstates as a source of phononic dissipation in this system. We show that an\nensemble of such two-level tunneling states can be driven into\ntransparency--virtually eliminating this source of phonon dissipation over a\nbroad range of frequencies. Experimental studies of phononic self-frequency\nsaturation show excellent agreement with a theoretical model accounting for the\nphonon coupling to an ensemble of two-level tunneling states. Extending these\nresults, we demonstrate a general approach to suppress dissipation produced by\ntwo-level tunneling states via cross-saturation, where the lifetime of a\nphonons at one frequency can be extended by the presence of a high intensity\nacoustic beam at another frequency. Although these studies were carried out in\nsilica, our findings are quite general, and can be applied to a range of\nmaterials systems and device geometries.\n", "  We present a modal approach to compute the Purcell factor in Mie resonators\nexhibiting both electric and magnetic resonances. The analytic expressions of\nthe normal modes are used to calculate the effective volumes. We show that\nimportant features of the effective volume can be predicted thanks to the\ntranslation-addition coefficients of a displaced dipole. Using our formalism,\nit is easy to see that, in general, the Purcell factor of Mie resonators is not\ndominated by a single mode, but rather by a large superposition. Finally we\nconsider a silicon resonator homogeneously doped with electric dipolar\nemitters, and we show that the average electric Purcell factor dominates over\nthe magnetic one.\n", "  For continuous weak measurement of qubits, we obtain exact expressions for\nweak values (WVs) from the post-selection restricted average of measurement\noutputs, by using both the quantumtrajectory- equation (QTE) and quantum\nBayesian approach. The former is applicable to short-time weak measurement,\nwhile the latter can relax the measurement strength to finite. We find that\neven in the \"very\" weak limit the result can be essentially different from the\none originally proposed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman (AAV), in a sense that\nour result incorporates non-perturbative correction which could be important\nwhen the AAV's WV is large. Within the Bayesian framework, we obtain also\nelegant expressions for finite measurement strength and find that the\namplifier's noise in quantum measurement has no effect on the WVs. In\nparticular, we obtain very useful result for homodyne measurement in\ncircuit-QED system, which allows for measuring the real and imaginary parts of\nthe AAV's WV by simply tuning the phase of the local oscillator. This advantage\ncan be exploited as efficient state-tomography technique.\n", "  We report a high-pressure 75As NMR study on the heavily hole-doped iron\npnictide superconductor KFe2As2 (Tc~3.8 K). The low-energy spin fluctuations\nare found to decrease with applied pressure up to 2 GPa, but then increase\nagain, changing in lockstep with the pressure-induced evolution of Tc. Their\ndiverging nature suggests close proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point\nat a negative pressure of P~-0.6 GPa. Above 2.4 GPa, the 75As satellite spectra\nsplit below 40 K, indicating a breaking of As site symmetry and an incipient\ncharge order. These pressure-controlled phenomena demonstrate the presence of\nnearly-critical fluctuations in both spin and charge, providing essential input\nfor the origin of superconductivity.\n", "  Selecting excitations in localized orbitals to calculate long-range\ncorrelation contributions to range-separated density-functional theory can\nreduce the overall computational effort significantly. Beyond simple selection\nschemes of excited determinants, the dispersion-only approximation, which\navoids counterpoise-corrected monomer calculations, is shown to be particularly\ninteresting in this context, which we apply to the random-phase approximation.\nThe approach has been tested on dimers of formamide, water, methane and\nbenzene.\n", "  We consider (continuum) mass ratios of the lightest `glueballs' as a function\nof N for SO(N) and SU(N) lattice gauge theories in D=2+1. We observe that the\nleading large N correction is usually sufficient to describe the N-dependence\nof SO(N.geq.3) and SU(N.geq.2), within the errors of the numerical calculation.\nJust as interesting is the fact that the coefficient of this correction almost\ninvariably turns out to be anomalously small, for both SO(N) and SU(N). We\npoint out that this can follow naturally from the strong constraints that one\nnaively expects from the Lie algebra equivalence between certain SO(N) and\nSU(N') theories and the equivalence of SO(infinity) and SU(infinity). The same\nargument for a weak N-dependence can in principle apply to SU(N) and SO(N)\ngauge theories in D=3+1.\n", "  In this work we revisit the important and controversial concept of quantum\nweak values, aiming to provide a simplified understanding to its associated\nphysics and the origin of anomaly. Taking the Stern-Gerlach setup as a working\nsystem, we base our analysis on an exact treatment in terms of quantum Bayesian\napproach. We also make particular connection with a very recent work, where the\nanomaly of the weak values was claimed from the pure statistics in association\nwith \"disturbance\" and \"post-selection\", rather than the unique quantum nature.\nOur analysis resolves the related controversies through a clear and\nquantitative way.\n", "  We study the quasiparticles of the one-band $t$-$J$ and $t$-$t'$-$t\"$-$J$\nmodels using a variational approximation that includes spin fluctuations in the\nvicinity of the hole. We explain why the spin fluctuations and the longer range\nhopping have complementary contributions to the quasiparticle dynamics, and\nthus why both are essential to obtain a dispersion in agreement with that\nmeasured experimentally. This is very different from the three-band Emery model\nin the strongly-correlated limit, where the same variational approximation\nshows that spin fluctuations have a minor effect on the quasiparticle dynamics.\nThis difference proves that these one-band and three-band models describe\nqualitatively different quasiparticles, and therefore they they cannot both be\nsuitable to describe the physics of underdoped cuprates.\n", "  The equations governing atmospheric flows are nonlinear. Consequently, the\nhierarchy of cumulant equations is not closed. But because atmospheric flows\nare inhomogeneous and anisotropic, the nonlinearity may manifest itself only\nweakly through interactions of mean fields with disturbances such as thermals\nor eddies. In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant\nequations hold promise as a closure strategy.\n  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate\nthe dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study\nthe growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,\nleading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.\nWe demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in\nwhich interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but\ninteractions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of\nthe convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent\ntransport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale\nwaves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a\ncumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of\nsuch waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some\ncircumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the\nplanetary rotation rate is large enough. However, CE2 fails to capture the flow\nevolution when nonlinear eddy--eddy interactions in surf zones become\nimportant. Higher-order closures can capture these missing interactions.\n  The results point to new ways in which the dynamics of turbulent boundary\nlayers may be represented in climate models, and they illustrate different\nclasses of nonlinear processes that can control wave dissipation and momentum\nfluxes in the troposphere.\n", "  We model the charge, spin, and heat currents in ferromagnetic metal$|$normal\nmetal$|$normal metal trilayer structures in the two current model, taking into\naccount bulk and interface thermoelectric properties as well as Joule heating.\nResults include the temperature distribution as well as resistance-current\ncurves that reproduce the observed shifted parabolic characteristics. Thin\ntunneling barriers can enhance the apparent Peltier cooling. The model agrees\nwith experimental results for wide multilayer pillars, but the giant effects\nobserved for diameters $\\lesssim 100\\,$nm are still under discussion.\n", "  Massive gravity in the weak field limit is described by the Fierz-Pauli\ntheory with 5 degrees of freedom in four dimensions. In this theory, we\ncalculate the gravitomagnetic effects (potential energy) between two\npoint-like, spinning sources that also orbit around each other in the limit\nwhere the spins and the velocities are small. Spin-spin, spin-orbit and\norbit-orbit interactions in massive gravity theory have rather remarkable,\ndiscrete differences from their counterparts in General Relativity. Our\ncomputation is applicable for large distances, for example, for interaction\nbetween galaxies or galaxy clusters where massive gravity is expected to play a\nrole. We also extend the computations to quadratic gravity theories in four\ndimensions and find the lowest order gravitomagnetic effects and show that at\nsmall separations quadratic gravity behaves differently than General\nRelativity.\n", "  A novel kind of crystal order in high-density nanoconfined bilayer ice is\nproposed from molecular dynamics and density-functional theory simulations. A\nfirst-order transition is observed between a low-temperature proton-ordered\nsolid and a high-temperature proton-disordered solid. The latter is shown to\npossess crystalline order for the oxygen positions, arranged on a close-packed\ntriangular lattice with AA stacking. Uniquely amongst the ice phases, the\ntriangular bilayer is characterized by two levels of disorder (for the bonding\nnetwork and for the protons) which results in a configurational entropy twice\nthat of bulk ice.\n", "  We study the resonant decay of the primordial Standard Model Higgs condensate\nafter inflation into $SU(2)$ gauge bosons on the lattice. We find that the\nnon-Abelian interactions between the gauge bosons quickly extend the momentum\ndistribution towards high values, efficiently destroying the condensate after\nthe onset of backreaction. For the inflationary scale $H = 10^8$ GeV, we find\nthat 90% of the Higgs condensate has decayed after $n \\sim 10$ oscillation\ncycles. This differs significantly from the Abelian case where, given the same\ncoupling strengths, most of the condensate would persist after the resonance.\n", "  A theoretical framework is introduced to model the dynamical changes of the\nstate of polarization during transmission in coherent fibre-optic systems. The\nmodel generalizes the one-dimensional phase noise random walk to higher\ndimensions, accounting for random polarization drifts, emulating a random walk\non the Poincar\\'e sphere, which has been successfully verified using\nexperimental data. The model is described in the Jones, Stokes and real\nfour-dimensional formalisms, and the mapping between them is derived. Such a\nmodel will be increasingly important in simulating and optimizing future\nsystems, where polarization-multiplexed transmission and sophisticated digital\nsignal processing will be natural parts. The proposed polarization drift model\nis the first of its kind as prior work either models polarization drift as a\ndeterministic process or focuses on polarization-mode dispersion in systems\nwhere the state of polarization does not affect the receiver performance. We\nexpect the model to be useful in a wide-range of photonics applications where\nstochastic polarization fluctuation is an issue.\n", "  A theory for wave mechanical systems with local inversion and translation\nsymmetries is developed employing the two-dimensional solution space of the\nstationary Schr\\\"odinger equation. The local symmetries of the potential are\nencoded into corresponding local basis vectors in terms of symmetry-induced\ntwo-point invariant currents which map the basis amplitudes between\nsymmetry-related points. A universal wavefunction structure in locally\nsymmetric potentials is revealed, independently of the physical boundary\nconditions, by using special local bases which are adapted to the existing\nlocal symmetries. The local symmetry bases enable efficient computation of\nspatially resolved wave amplitudes in systems with arbitrary combinations of\nlocal inversion and translation symmetries. The approach opens the perspective\nof a flexible analysis and control of wave localization in structurally complex\nsystems.\n", "  Developing efficient framework for quantum measurements is of essential\nimportance to quantum science and technology. In this work, for the important\nsuperconducting circuit-QED setup, we present a rigorous and analytic solution\nfor the effective quantum trajectory equation (QTE) after polaron\ntransformation and converted to the form of Stratonovich calculus. We find that\nthe solution is a generalization of the elegant quantum Bayesian approach\ndeveloped in arXiv:1111.4016 by Korotokov and currently applied to circuit-QED\nmeasurements. The new result improves both the diagonal and offdiagonal\nelements of the qubit density matrix, via amending the distribution\nprobabilities of the output currents and several important phase factors.\nCompared to numerical integration of the QTE, the resultant quantum Bayesian\nrule promises higher efficiency to update the measured state, and allows more\nefficient and analytical studies for some interesting problems such as quantum\nweak values, past quantum state, and quantum state smoothing. The method of\nthis work opens also a new way to obtain quantum Bayesian formulas for other\nsystems and in more complicated cases.\n", "  The phase relation between quantum states represents an essential resource\nfor the storage and processing of quantum information. While quantum phases are\ncommonly controlled dynamically by tuning energetic interactions, utilizing\ngeometric phases that accumulate during cyclic evolution may offer superior\nrobustness to noise. To date, demonstrations of geometric phase control in\nsolid-state systems rely on microwave fields that have limited spatial\nresolution. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method based on stimulated\nRaman adiabatic passage to accumulate a geometric phase, the Berry phase, in an\nindividual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using diffraction-limited\nlaser light, we guide the NV center's spin along loops on the Bloch sphere to\nenclose arbitrary Berry phase and characterize these trajectories through\ntime-resolved state tomography. We investigate the limits of this control due\nto loss of adiabiaticity and decoherence, as well as its robustness to noise\nintentionally introduced into the experimental control parameters, finding its\nresilience to be independent of the amount of Berry phase enclosed. These\ntechniques set the foundation for optical geometric manipulation in future\nimplementations of photonic networks of solid state qubits linked and\ncontrolled by light.\n", "  We consider a stochastic, continuous state and time opinion model where each\nagent's opinion locally interacts with other agents' opinions in the system,\nand there is also exogenous randomness. The interaction tends to create\nclusters of common opinion. By using linear stability analysis of the\nassociated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation that governs the empirical density\nof opinions in the limit of infinitely many agents, we can estimate the number\nof clusters, the time to cluster formation and the critical strength of\nrandomness so as to have cluster formation. We also discuss the cluster\ndynamics after their formation, the width and the effective diffusivity of the\nclusters. Finally, the long term behavior of clusters is explored numerically.\nExtensive numerical simulations confirm our analytical findings.\n", "  We present the largest number of Milky Way sized dark matter halos simulated\nat very high mass ($\\sim$$10^4$ M$_\\odot$/particle) and temporal resolution\n($\\sim$5 Myrs/snapshot) done to date, quadrupling what is currently available\nin the literature. This initial suite consists of the first 24 halos of the\n$Caterpillar$ $Project$ (www.caterpillarproject.org) whose project goal of 60 -\n70 halos will be made public when complete. We resolve $\\sim$20,000\ngravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo. Over\nthe ranges set by our spatial resolution our convergence is excellent and\nimprovements were made upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to better\nidentify substructure at such high resolutions (e.g., on average we recover\n$\\sim$4 subhalos in each host halo above 10$^8$ M$_\\odot$ which would have\notherwise not been found using conventional methods). For our relaxed halos,\nthe inner profiles are reasonably fit by Einasto profiles ($\\alpha$ = 0.169\n$\\pm$ 0.023) though this depends on the relaxed nature and assembly history of\na given halo. Averaging over all halos, the substructure mass fraction is\n$f_{m,subs} = 0.121 \\pm 0.041$, and mass function slope is d$N$/d$M\\propto\nM^{-1.88 \\pm 0.10}$ though we find scatter in the normalizations for fixed halo\nmass due to more concentrated hosts having less subhalos at fixed subhalo mass.\nThere are no biases stemming from Lagrangian volume selection as all Lagrangian\nvolume types are included in our sample. Our detailed contamination study of\n264 low resolution halos has resulted in obtaining very large and\nunprecedented, high-resolution regions around our host halos for our target\nresolution (sphere of radius $\\sim$$1.4 \\pm 0.4$ Mpc) allowing for accurate\nstudies of low mass dwarf galaxies at large galactocentric radii and the very\nfirst stellar systems at high redshift ($z \\geq$ 10).\n", "  We report the measurement of muons and muon-induced phosphorescence in\nDM-Ice17, a NaI(Tl) direct detection dark matter experiment at the South Pole.\nMuon interactions in the crystal are identified by their observed pulse shape\nand large energy depositions. The measured muon rate in DM-Ice17 is 2.93 +/-\n0.04 muons/crystal/day with a modulation amplitude of 12.3 +/- 1.7%, consistent\nwith expectation. Following muon interactions, we observe long-lived\nphosphorescence in the NaI(Tl) crystals with a decay time of 5.5 +/- 0.5 s. The\nprompt energy deposited by a muon is correlated to the amount of delayed\nphosphorescence, the brightest of which consist of tens of millions of photons.\nThese photons are distributed over tens of seconds with a rate and arrival\ntiming that do not mimic a scintillation signal above 2 keVee. While the\nproperties of phosphorescence vary among individual crystals, the\nannually-modulating signal observed by DAMA cannot be accounted for by\nphosphorescence with the characteristics observed in DM-Ice17.\n", "  A large part of the interest in magnets with frustrated antiferromagnetic\ninteractions comes from the many new phases found in applied magnetic field. In\nthis Article, we explore some of the new phases which arise in a model with\nfrustrated ferromagnetic interactions, the $J_1-J_2-J_3$ Heisenberg model on a\nsquare lattice. Using a combination of classical Monte-Carlo simulation and\nspin-wave theory, we uncover behaviour reminiscent of some widely-studied\nfrustrated antiferromagnets, but with a number of new twists. We first\ndemonstrate that, for a suitable choice of parameters, the phase diagram as a\nfunction of magnetic field and temperature is nearly identical to that of the\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, including the celebrated\n1/3-magnetisation plateau. We then examine how this phase diagram changes when\nthe model is tuned to a point where the classical ground--state is highly\ndegenerate. In this case, two new phases emerge; a classical,\nfinite-temperature spin-liquid, characterised by a \"ring\" in the spin\nstructure--factor $\\mathcal{S}({\\mathbf q})$; and a vortex crystal, a\nmultiple-Q state with finite magnetisation, which can be viewed as an ordered\nlattice of magnetic vortices. All of these new phases persist for a wide range\nof magnetic field. We discuss the relationship between these results and\npublished studies of frustrated antiferromagnets, together with some of the\nmaterials where these new phases might be observed in experiment.\n", "  Gravitational waves from binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole/neutron\nstar (BHNS) inspirals are primary sources for detection by the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The tidal forces acting on the\nneutron stars induce changes in the phase evolution of the gravitational\nwaveform, and these changes can be used to constrain the nuclear equation of\nstate. Current methods of generating BNS and BHNS waveforms rely on either\ncomputationally challenging full 3D hydrodynamical simulations or approximate\nanalytic solutions. We introduce a new method for computing inspiral waveforms\nfor BNS/BHNS systems by adding the post-Newtonian (PN) tidal effects to full\nnumerical simulations of binary black holes (BBHs), effectively replacing the\nnontidal terms in the PN expansion with BBH results. Comparing a waveform\ngenerated with this method against a full hydrodynamical simulation of a BNS\ninspiral yields a phase difference of $<1$ radian over $\\sim 15$ orbits. The\nnumerical phase accuracy required of BNS simulations to measure the accuracy of\nthe method we present here is estimated as a function of the tidal\ndeformability parameter ${\\lambda}$.\n", "  We investigate analytically the production of entropy during a breathing\ncycle in healthy and diseased lungs. First, we calculate entropy production in\nhealthy lungs by applying the laws of thermodynamics to the well-known\ntranspulmonary pressure-volume ($P-V$) curves of the lung under the assumption\nthat lung tissue behaves as an entropy spring-like rubber. The bulk modulus,\n$B$, of the lung is also derived from these calculations. Second, we extend\nthis approach to elastic recoil disorders of the lung such as occur in\npulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. These diseases are characterized by\nparticular alterations in the $P-V$ relationship. For example, in fibrotic\nlungs $B$ increases monotonically with disease progression, while in emphysema\nthe opposite occurs. These diseases can thus be mimicked simply by making\nappropriate adjustments to the parameters of the $P-V$ curve. Using Clausius's\nformalism, we show that entropy production, $\\Delta S$, is related to the\nhysteresis area, $\\Delta A$, enclosed by the $P-V$ curve during a breathing\ncycle, namely, $\\Delta S=\\Delta A/T$, where $T$ is the body temperature.\nAlthough $\\Delta A$ is highly dependent on the disease, such formula applies to\nhealthy as well as diseased lungs, regardless of the disease stage. Finally, we\nuse {\\it ansatzs} to predict analytically the entropy produced by the fibrotic\nand emphysematous lungs.\n", "  We present \"radially-resolved-equilibrium-models\" for the growth of stellar\nand gaseous disks in cosmologically accreting massive halos. Our focus is on\nobjects that evolve to redshifts $z\\sim 2$. We solve the time-dependent\nequations that govern the radially dependent star-formation rates, inflows and\noutflows from and to the inter- and circum-galactic medium, and inward radial\ngas flows within the disks. The stellar and gaseous disks reach equilibrium\nconfigurations on dynamical time scales much shorter than variations in the\ncosmological dark matter halo growth and baryonic accretions rates. We show\nanalytically that mass and global angular momentum conservation naturally give\nrise to exponential gas and stellar disks over many radial length scales. As\nexpected, the gaseous disks are more extended as set by the condition Toomre\n$Q<1$ for star-formation. The disks rapidly become baryon dominated. For\nmassive, $5\\times 10^{12}M_\\odot$ halos at redshift $z=2$, we reproduced the\ntypical observed star-formation rates of $\\sim 100 \\, M_\\odot \\, {\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$, stellar masses $\\sim 9\\times 10^{10}\\, M_\\odot$, gas contents $\\sim\n10^{11}\\, M_\\odot$, half mass sizes of 4.5 and 5.8 kpc for the stars and gas,\nand characteristic surface densities of $500$ and $ 400\\, M_\\odot \\, {\\rm\npc}^{-2}$ for the stars and gas.\n", "  We compare the sensitivity of precision measurements of lepton flavour\nobservables to the reach of the LHC in a case study of lepton-flavour violating\noperators of dimension six with two leptons and two quarks. For light quarks\nprecision measurements always yield the more stringent constraints. The LHC\ncomplements precision measurements for operators with heavier quarks.\nCompetitive limits can already be set on the cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ > 600 - 800\nGeV for operators with right-handed $\\tau$ leptons using the LHC run 1 data.\n", "  We introduce a new integrable supersymmetric lattice chain which violates\nfermion conservation and exhibits fermion-hole symmetry. The model displays\nexponential degeneracy in every eigenstate including the groundstate. This\ndegeneracy is expressed in the possibility to create any number of zero modes\nreminiscent of Cooper pairs.\n", "  Magneto-dielectric spectra of La0.95Ca0.05CoO3 covering the crossover of spin\nstates reveals strong coupling of its spin and dipolar degrees of freedom.\nSignature of spin-state transition at 30K clearly manifests in magnetization,\nsupported by Co L_3,2-edge XAS data on the doped-specimen as consistent with\nits suppressed T_SST vs. ~150K for pure LaCoO3. Dispersive activation-step\n{\\Delta}{\\epsilon}'(T_{\\omega})~O(10^2) and relaxation-peak\n{\\epsilon}\"(T_{\\omega}) reflect the allied influence of coexistent spin-states\non the dielectric character. Dipolar relaxation in the LS regime below T_SST is\npartly segmental (VFT kinetics) featuring magnetic-field tunability, whereas in\nthe LS/IS-spin disordered state above 30K, it is uncorrelated (Arrhenic\nkinetics) and almost impervious to the H-field. Kinetics-switchover defines the\ndipolar-glass transition temperature Tg(H), below which the\nmagneto-thermally-activated cooperative relaxations freeze-out by the VFT\ntemperature T_0(H). Applied H-field facilitates thermally-activated SST and\naccelerates the dipolar relaxations; a critical 5T field collapsing the entire\nkinetics into a single Arrhenic behavior. Magneto-electricity (ME) spanning\nsizable thermo-spectral range registers diverse signatures here in the kinetic,\nspectral, and field behaviors, in contrast to the static/perturbative ME\nobserved close to the spin-ordering in typical multiferroics. Intrinsic\nmagneto-dielectricity (50%) along with vanishing magneto-loss is obtained at\n(27K/50kHz)_9T. Sub-linear deviant field-hysteretic split seen in\n{\\epsilon}'(H)|_>4T suggests the emergence of robust dipoles organized into\nnano-clusters, realized by the internally-generated high magneto-electric\nfield. An elaborate {\\omega}-T multi-dispersions diagram maps the rich variety\nof phase/response patterns, revealing the highly-interacting magnetic and\nelectric moments in the system.\n", "  Drug metabolites usually have structures of split-ring resonators (SRRs),\nwhich might lead to negative permittivity and permeability in electromagnetic\nfield. As a result, in the UV-vis region, the latent fingermarks images of drug\naddicts and non drug users are inverse. The optical properties of latent\nfingermarks are quite different between drug addicts and non-drug users. This\nis a technic superiority for crime scene investigation to distinguish them. In\nthis paper, we calculate the permittivity and permeability of drug metabolites\nusing tight-binding model. The latent fingermarks of smokers and non-smokers\nare given as an example.\n", "  We measure the far-field intensity of vortex beams going through nanoholes.\nThe process is analyzed in terms of helicity and total angular momentum. It is\nseen that the total angular momentum is preserved in the process, and helicity\nis not. We compute the ratio between the two transmitted helicity components,\n$\\gamma_{m,p}$. We observe that this ratio is highly dependent on the helicity\n($p$) and the angular momentum ($m$) of the incident vortex beam in\nconsideration. Due to the mirror symmetry of the nanoholes, we are able to\nrelate the transmission properties of vortex beams with a certain helicity and\nangular momentum, with the ones with opposite helicity and angular momentum.\nInterestingly, vortex beams enhance the $\\gamma_{m,p}$ ratio as compared to\nthose obtained by Gaussian beams.\n", "  Self-testing refers to the possibility of characterizing uniquely (up to\nlocal isometries) the state and measurements contained in quantum devices,\nbased only on the observed input-output statistics. Already in the basic case\nof the two-qubit singlet, self-testing is not unique: the two known criteria\n(the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality and the Mayers-Yao correlations)\nare not equivalent. It is unknown how many criteria there are. In this paper,\nwe find the whole set of criteria for the ideal self-testing of singlet with\ntwo measurements and two outcomes on each side: it coincides with all the\nextremal points of the quantum set that can be obtained by measuring the\nsinglet.\n", "  The recent observation of a ferroelectric-like structural transition in\nmetallic LiOsO$_3$ has generated a flurry of interest in the properties of\npolar metals. Such materials are thought to be rare because free electrons\nscreen out the long-range electrostatic forces that favor a polar structure\nwith a dipole moment in every unit cell. In this work, we question whether\nlong-range electrostatic forces are always the most important ingredient in\ndriving polar distortions. We use crystal chemical models, in combination with\nfirst-principles Density Functional Theory calculations, to explore the\nmechanisms of inversion-symmetry breaking in LiOsO$_3$ and both insulating and\nelectron-doped ATiO$_3$ perovskites, A = Ba, Sr, Ca. Although electrostatic\nforces do play a significant role in driving the polar instability of BaTiO$_3$\n(which is suppressed under electron doping), the polar phases of CaTiO$_3$ and\nLiOsO$_3$ emerge through a mechanism driven by local bonding preferences and\nthis mechanism is `resistant' to the presence of charge carriers. Hence, our\nresults suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility between\nmetallicity and polar distortions. We use the insights gained from our\ncalculations to suggest design principles for new polar metals and promising\navenues for further research.\n", "  Based on an examination of the solutions to the Killing Vector equations for\nthe FLRW-metric in co moving coordinates , it is conjectured and proved that\nthe components(in these coordinates) of Killing Vectors, when suitably scaled\nby functions, are \\emph{zero modes} of the corresponding \\emph{scalar}\nLaplacian. The complete such set of zero modes(infinitely many) are explicitly\nconstructed for the two-sphere. They are parametrised by an integer n. For\n$n\\,\\ge\\,2$, all the solutions are \\emph{irregular} (in the sense that they are\nneither well defined everywhere nor are \\emph{square-integrable}). The\nassociated 2-d vectors are also \\emph{not normalisable}. The $n=0$ solutions\nbeing constants (these correspond to the zero angular momentum solutions) are\nregular and normalizable. Not all of the $n=1$ solutions are regular but the\nassociated vectors are normalizable. Of course, the action of scalar Laplacian\ncoordinate independent significance only when acting on scalars. However, our\nconclusions have an unambiguous meaning as long as one works in this coordinate\nsystem. As an intermediate step, the covariant Laplacians(vector Laplacians) of\nKilling vectors are worked out for four-manifolds in two different ways, both\nof which have the novelty of not explicitly needing the connections. It is\nfurther shown that for certain maximally symmetric sub-manifolds(hypersurfaces\nof one or more constant comoving coordinates) of the FLRW-spaces also, the\nscaled Killing vector components are zero modes of their corresponding scalar\nLaplacians. The Killing vectors for the maximally symmetric four-manifolds are\nworked out using the elegant embedding formalism originally due to\nSchr\\\"odinger . Some consequences of our results are worked out. Relevance to\nsome very recent works on zero modes in AdS/CFT correspondences , as well as on\nbraneworld scenarios is briefly commented upon.\n", "  This paper presents some unusual dynamics of the Rabinovich-Fabrikant system,\nsuch as \"virtual\" saddles, \"tornado\"-like stable cycles and hidden chaotic\nattractors. Due to the strong nonlinearity and high complexity, the results are\nobtained numerically with some insightful descriptions and discussions.\n", "  Recent observations indicate that a high production rate of positrons (strong\n511 keV line) and a significant amount of excess GeV gamma-ray exist in our\nGalactic bulge. The latter issue can be explained by $\\sim 40$ GeV dark matter\nannihilation through $b \\bar{b}$ channel while the former one remains a\nmystery. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that a large amount of high\ndensity gas might exist near the Galactic Centre million years ago to account\nfor the young, massive stars extending from 0.04 pc - 7 pc. In this article, I\npropose a new scenario and show that the 40 GeV dark matter annihilation model\ncan also explain the required positron production rate (511 keV line) in the\nbulge due to the existence of the high density gas cloud near the supermassive\nblack hole long time ago.\n", "  The pressure dependence of the upper critical field, $H_\\textrm{c2,c}$, of\nsingle crystalline FeSe was studied using measurements of the inter-plane\nresistivity, $\\rho_{\\textrm{c}}$ in magnetic fields parallel to tetragonal\n$c$-axis. $H_\\textrm{c2,c}(T)$ curves obtained under hydrostatic pressures up\nto $1.56$ GPa, the range over which the superconducting transition temperature,\n$T_\\textrm{c}$, of FeSe exhibits a non-monotonic dependence with local maximum\nat $p_1\\approx$ 0.8 GPa and local minimum at $p_2\\approx$ 1.2 GPa. The slope of\nthe upper critical field at $T_\\textrm{c}$,\n$\\left(\\textrm{d}H_\\text{c2,c}/\\textrm{d}T\\right)_{T_\\textrm{c}}$, also\nexhibits a non-monotonic pressure dependence with distinct changes at $p_1$ and\n$p_2$. For $p<p_1$ the slope can be described within multi-band orbital model.\nFor both $p_1<p <p_2$ and $p>p_2$ the slope is in good quantitative agreement\nwith a single band, orbital Helfand-Werthamer theory with Fermi velocities\ndetermined from Shubnikov-de Haas measurements. This finding indicates that\nFermi surface changes are responsible for the local minimum of\n$T_\\textrm{c}(p)$ at $p_2\\approx$ 1.2 GPa.\n", "  Trajectory-based mixed quantum-classical approaches to coupled\nelectron-nuclear dynamics suffer from well-studied problems such as the lack of\n(or incorrect account for) decoherence in the trajectory surface hopping method\nand the inability of reproducing the spatial splitting of a nuclear wave packet\nin Ehrenfest-like dynamics. In the context of electronic non-adiabatic\nprocesses, these problems can result in wrong predictions for quantum\npopulations and in unphysical outcomes for the nuclear dynamics. In this paper\nwe propose a solution to these issues by approximating the coupled electronic\nand nuclear equations within the framework of the exact factorization of the\nelectron-nuclear wave function. We present a simple quantum-classical scheme\nbased on coupled classical trajectories, and test it against the full quantum\nmechanical solution from wave packet dynamics for some model situations which\nrepresent particularly challenging problems for the above-mentioned traditional\nmethods.\n", "  We report the first detection of a gap and a ring in 336 GHz dust continuum\nemission from the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The gap and ring are located at around\n25 and 41 au from the central star, respectively, and are associated with the\nCO snow line at ~30 au. The gap has a radial width of less than 15 au and a\nmass deficit of more than 23%, taking into account that the observations are\nlimited to an angular resolution of ~15 au. In addition, the 13CO and C18O J =\n3 - 2 lines show a decrement in CO line emission throughout the disk, down to\n~10 au, indicating a freeze-out of gas-phase CO onto grain surfaces and\npossible subsequent surface reactions to form larger molecules. The observed\ngap could be caused by gravitational interaction between the disk gas and a\nplanet with a mass less than super-Neptune (2M_{Neptune}), or could be the\nresult of the destruction of large dust aggregates due to the sintering of CO\nice.\n", "  Recently, an extension of the topologically massive gravity (TMG) in $2+1$\ndimensions, dubbed as minimal massive gravity (MMG), was found which is free of\nthe bulk-boundary unitarity clash that inflicts the former theory and all the\nother known three dimensional theories. Field equations of MMG differ from\nthose of TMG at quadratic terms in the curvature that do not come from the\nvariation of an action depending on the metric alone. Here we show that MMG is\na unique theory and there does not exist a deformation of TMG or MMG at the\ncubic and quartic order (and beyond) in the curvature that is consistent at the\nlevel of the field equations. The only extension of TMG with the desired bulk\nand boundary properties having a single massive degree of freedom is MMG.\n", "  We have used high-resolution neutron Larmor diffraction and capacitative\ndilatometry to investigate spontaneous and forced magnetostriction in undoped,\nantiferromagnetic YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.0}$, the parent compound of a prominent\nfamily of high-temperature superconductors. Upon cooling below the N\\'eel\ntemperature, $T_N = 420$~K, Larmor diffraction reveals the formation of\nmagneto-structural domains of characteristic size $\\sim 240$~nm. In the\nantiferromagnetic state, dilatometry reveals a minute ($4 \\times 10^{-6}$)\northorhombic distortion of the crystal lattice in external magnetic fields. We\nattribute these observations to exchange striction and spin-orbit coupling\ninduced magnetostriction, respectively, and show that they have an important\ninfluence on the thermal and charge transport properties of undoped and lightly\ndoped cuprates.\n", "  The exploitation of present and future synoptic (multi-band and multi-epoch)\nsurveys requires an extensive use of automatic methods for data processing and\ndata interpretation. In this work, using data extracted from the Catalina Real\nTime Transient Survey (CRTS), we investigate the classification performance of\nsome well tested methods: Random Forest, MLPQNA (Multi Layer Perceptron with\nQuasi Newton Algorithm) and K-Nearest Neighbors, paying special attention to\nthe feature selection phase. In order to do so, several classification\nexperiments were performed. Namely: identification of cataclysmic variables,\nseparation between galactic and extra-galactic objects and identification of\nsupernovae.\n", "  Weyl semimetals provide the realization of Weyl fermions in solid-state\nphysics. Among all the physical phenomena that are enabled by Weyl semimetals,\nthe chiral anomaly is the most unusual one. Here, we report signatures of the\nchiral anomaly in the magneto-transport measurements on the first Weyl\nsemimetal TaAs. We show negative magnetoresistance under parallel electric and\nmagnetic fields, that is, unlike most metals whose resistivity increases under\nan external magnetic field, we observe that our high mobility TaAs samples\nbecome more conductive as a magnetic field is applied along the direction of\nthe current for certain ranges of the field strength. We present systematically\ndetailed data and careful analyses, which allow us to exclude other possible\norigins of the observed negative magnetoresistance. Our transport data,\ncorroborated by photoemission measurements, first-principles calculations and\ntheoretical analyses, collectively demonstrate signatures of the Weyl fermion\nchiral anomaly in the magneto-transport of TaAs.\n", "  We provide evidence that gallium purity is the primary impediment to\nattainment of ultra-high mobility in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in\nAlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The purity\nof gallium can be enhanced dramatically by in-situ high temperature outgassing\nwithin an operating MBE. Based on analysis of data from an initial growth\ncampaign in a new MBE system and modifications employed for a 2nd growth\ncampaign, we have produced 2DEGs with low temperature mobility in excess of\n35x10^6cm2/Vs at density n=3.0x10^11/cm2 and mobility 18x10^6cm2/Vs at\nn=1.1x1011/cm2. Our 2nd campaign data indicate that gallium purity remains the\nfactor currently limiting mobility <40x10^6cm2/Vs. We describe strategies to\novercome this limitation.\n", "  We present a catalogue of dense cores in a $\\sim 4^\\circ\\times2^\\circ$ field\nof the Taurus star-forming region, inclusive of the L1495 cloud, derived from\nHerschel SPIRE and PACS observations in the 70 $\\mu$m, 160 $\\mu$m, 250 $\\mu$m,\n350 $\\mu$m, and 500 $\\mu$m continuum bands. Estimates of mean dust temperature\nand total mass are derived using modified blackbody fits to the spectral energy\ndistributions. We detect 525 starless cores of which $\\sim10$-20% are\ngravitationally bound and therefore presumably prestellar. Our census of\nunbound objects is $\\sim85$% complete for $M>0.015\\,M_\\odot$ in low density\nregions ($A_V\\stackrel{<}{_\\sim}5$ mag), while the bound (prestellar) subset is\n$\\sim85$% complete for $M>0.1\\,M_\\odot$ overall. The prestellar core mass\nfunction (CMF) is consistent with lognormal form, resembling the stellar system\ninitial mass function, as has been reported previously. All of the inferred\nprestellar cores lie on filamentary structures whose column densities exceed\nthe expected threshold for filamentary collapse, in agreement with previous\nreports. Unlike the prestellar CMF, the unbound starless CMF is not lognormal,\nbut instead is consistent with a power-law form below $0.3\\,M_\\odot$ and shows\nno evidence for a low-mass turnover. It resembles previously reported mass\ndistributions for CO clumps at low masses ($M\\stackrel{<}{_\\sim}0.3\\,M_\\odot$).\nThe volume density PDF, however, is accurately lognormal except at high\ndensities. It is consistent with the effects of self-gravity on magnetized\nsupersonic turbulence. The only significant deviation from lognormality is a\nhigh-density tail which can be attributed unambiguously to prestellar cores.\n", "  Vesicles are involved in a vast variety of transport processes in living\norganisms. Additionally, they serve as a model for the dynamics of cell\nsuspensions. Predicting the rheological properties of their suspensions is\nstill an open question, as even the interaction of pairs is yet to be fully\nunderstood. Here we analyse the effect of a single vesicle, undergoing\ntank-treading motion, on its surrounding shear flow by studying the induced\ndisturbance field $\\delta \\vec{V}$, the difference between the velocity field\nin its presence and absence. The comparison between experiments and numerical\nsimulations reveals an impressive agreement. Tracking ridges in the disturbance\nfield magnitude landscape, we identify the principal directions along which the\nvelocity difference field is analysed in the vesicle vicinity. The disturbance\nmagnitude is found to be significant up to about 4 vesicles radii and can be\ndescribed by a power law decay with the distance $d$ from the vesicle $ \\|\n\\delta \\vec{V} \\| \\propto d^{-3/2}$. This is consistent with previous\nexperimental results on the separation distance between two interacting\nvesicles under similar conditions, for which their dynamics is altered. This is\nan indication of vesicles long-range effect via the disturbance field and calls\nfor the proper incorporation of long-range hydrodynamic interactions when\nattempting to derive rheological properties of vesicle suspensions.\n", "  The microscopic dynamics of laser-driven coherent synchrotron emission\ntransmitted through thin foils are investigated using particle-in-cell\nsimulations. For normal incidence interactions, we identify the formation of\ntwo distinct electron nanobunches from which emission takes place each\nhalf-cycle of the driving laser pulse. These emissions are separated temporally\nby 130 attoseconds and are dominant in different frequency ranges, which is a\ndirect consequence of the distinct characteristics of each electron nanobunch.\nThis may be exploited through spectral filtering to isolate these emissions,\ngenerating electromagnetic pulses of duration ~70 as.\n", "  O2 and O3 have been long considered the most robust individual biosignature\ngases in a planetary atmosphere, yet multiple mechanisms that may produce them\nin the absence of life have been described. However, these abiotic planetary\nmechanisms modify the environment in potentially identifiable ways. Here we\nbriefly discuss two of the most detectable spectral discriminants for abiotic\nO2/O3: CO and O4. We produce the first explicit self-consistent simulations of\nthese spectral discriminants as they may be seen by JWST. If JWST-NIRISS and/or\nNIRSpec observe CO (2.35, 4.6 um) in conjunction with CO2 (1.6, 2.0, 4.3 um) in\nthe transmission spectrum of a terrestrial planet it could indicate robust CO2\nphotolysis and suggest that a future detection of O2 or O3 might not be\nbiogenic. Strong O4 bands seen in transmission at 1.06 and 1.27 um could be\ndiagnostic of a post-runaway O2-dominated atmosphere from massive H-escape. We\nfind that for these false positive scenarios, CO at 2.35 um, CO2 at 2.0 and 4.3\num, and O4 at 1.27 um are all stronger features in transmission than O2/O3 and\ncould be detected with SNRs $\\gtrsim$ 3 for an Earth-size planet orbiting a\nnearby M dwarf star with as few as 10 transits, assuming photon-limited noise.\nO4 bands could also be sought in UV/VIS/NIR reflected light (at 0.345, 0.36,\n0.38, 0.445, 0.475, 0.53, 0.57, 0.63, 1.06, and 1.27 um) by a next generation\ndirect-imaging telescope such as LUVOIR/HDST or HabEx and would indicate an\noxygen atmosphere too massive to be biologically produced.\n", "  Refocusing of a quantum system in NMR and quantum information processing can\nbe achieved by application of short pulses according to the methods of spin\necho and dynamical decoupling. However, these methods are strongly limited by\nthe requirement that the evolution of the system between pulses be suitably\nsmall. Here we show how refocusing may be achieved for arbitrary (but\ntime-independent) evolution of the system between pulses. We first illustrate\nthe procedure with one-qubit systems, and then generalize to $d$-dimensional\nquantum systems. We also give an application of this result to quantum\ncomputation, proving a new version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that does not\nrequire inverse gates.\n", "  A critical review is presented on the most recent attempt to generally\nexplain the notion of \"statistical symmetry\". This particular explanation,\nhowever, is incomplete and misses one important and essential aspect. The aim\nof this short note is to provide this missing information and to clarify this\nnotion on the basis of a few instructive examples.\n", "  By applying the infinite-mass boundary condition, we analytically calculate\nthe confined states and the corresponding wave functions of AA-stacked bilayer\ngraphene quantum {dots} in the presence of an uniform magnetic field $B$. It is\nfound that the energy spectrum shows two set of levels, which are the double\ncopies of the energy spectrum for single layer graphene, shifted up-down by\n$+\\gamma$ and $-\\gamma$, respectively. However, the obtained spectrum exhibits\ndifferent symmetries between the electron and hole states as well as the\nintervalley symmetries. It is noticed that, the applied magnetic field breaks\nall symmetries, except one related to the intervalley electron-hole symmetry,\ni.e. $E^e(\\tau,m)=-E^h(\\tau,m)$. Two different regimes of confinement are\nfound: the first one is due to the infinite-mass barrier at weak $B$ and the\nsecond is dominated by the magnetic field as long as $B$ is large. We\nnumerically investigated the basics features of the energy spectrum to show the\nmain similarities and differences with respect to monolayer graphene,\nAB-stacked bilayer graphene and semiconductor quantum dots.\n", "  ((1+1)-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$ super-symmetric field theory and\n(3+1)-dimensional ${\\cal N}=2$ super-symmetric gauge theory are discussed in a,\nmore or less, unified way, designed to identify the quantum BPS states in both\nsystems. Euclidean 4-dimensional gauge theory with ${\\cal N}=2$ twisted\nsuper-symmetry is also analized. ${\\bf C}^\\infty$-topological invariants are\nidentified as certain n-point correlation functions in this QFT framework. The\ntwist of the effective dual Abelian gauge theory is briefly described, both\nfrom mathematical and physical viewpoints. The physical nature of the\ntopological defects arising in these systems, kinks, BPS and Dirac monopoles,\nBPST instantons, Liouville and Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen selfdual vortices,\netcetera, is analyzed,\n  The thread of the story connecting the QFT systems treated respectively in\nSections \\S.3 and \\S.4 is the process of TWIST that leads from a conventional\nextended Supersymetric Gauge Theory to the topological ${\\cal N}=2$ SUSY\nDonaldson QFT. Within Section \\S.3 the $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}$-dualities establish a\nlink between the weak coupling regime of the original gauge theory and the\nWilsonian (abelian) effective gauge theory arising at low energies. We shall\nalso look after the reminiscences of these dualities between the twisted TQFT\nsystems of Section \\S.4.\n", "  We study the distribution and evolution of the stellar mass and the star\nformation rate (SFR) of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) over $ 0.04<z<1.3 $\nusing a large sample of $ 407 $ X-ray galaxy groups selected from the COSMOS,\nAEGIS, and XMM-LSS fields. We compare our results with predictions from the\nsemi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation. In contrast to model\npredictions, we find that, as the universe evolves, the stellar mass\ndistribution evolves towards a normal distribution. This distribution tends to\nskew to low mass BGGs at all redshifts implying the presence of a star-forming\npopulation of the BGGs with $ M_S\\sim10^{10.5} M_{\\odot} $ which results in the\nshape of the stellar mass distribution deviating from a normal distribution. In\nagreement with models and previous studies, we find that the mean stellar mass\nof BGGs grows with time by a factor of $\\sim2$ between $z=1.3$ to $z=0.1$,\nhowever, the significant growth occurs above $ z=0.4$. The BGGs are not\nentirely a dormant population of galaxies, as low mass BGGs in low mass halos\nare more active in forming stars than the BGGs in more massive halos, over the\nsame redshift range. We find that the average SFR of the BGGs evolves steeply\nwith redshift and fraction of the passive BGGs increases as a function of\nincreasing stellar mass and halo mass. Finally, we show that the specific SFR\nof the BGGs within halos with $ M_{200} \\leq 10^{13.4} M_{\\odot} $ decreases\nwith increasing halo mass at $ z<0.4 $.\n", "  Mn1-xZnxCr2O4 (0<x<1) single crystals have been grown by the chemical vapor\ntransport (CVT) method. The crystallographic, magnetic, and thermal transport\nproperties of the single crystals were investigated by the room-temperature\nX-ray diffraction, magnetization M(T) and specific heat CP(T) measurements.\nMn1-xZnxCr2O4 crystals show a cubic structure, the lattice constant a decreases\nwith the increasing content x of the doped Zn2+ ions and follows the Vegard\nlaw. Based on the magnetization and heat capacity measurements, the magnetic\nevolution of Mn1-xZnxCr2O4 crystals has been discussed. For 0<x<0.3, the\nmagnetic ground state is the coexistence of the collinear ferrimagnetic order\n(CFIM) and spiral ferrimagnetic one (SFIM), which is similar to that of the\nparent MnCr2O4. When x changes from 0.3 to 0.8, the SFIM is progressively\nsuppressed and spin glass-like behavior is observed. When x is above 0.8, an\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order presents. At the same time, the magnetic specific\nheat (Cmag.) was also investigated and the results are coincident with the\nmagnetic measurements. The possible reasons based on the disorder effect and\nthe reduced molecular field effect induced by the substitution of Mn2+ ions by\nnonmagnetic Zn2+ ones in Mn1-xZnxCr2O4 crystals have been discussed.\n", "  Layered oxides have been intensively studied due to their high designability\nfor various electronic functions. Here we synthesize a new oxide as epitaxial\nthin film form by pulsed laser deposition. Film characterizations including\ncross-section and plan-view transmission electron microscopy confirm that the\nfilm is composed of twisted stack of triangular-lattice Rh and Bi layers. We\nforesee that the concept of twisted oxide layers will open up a new route to\ndesign further functional layered oxides.\n", "  We report on magneto-transport measurements on low-density, large-area\nmonolayer epitaxial graphene devices grown on SiC. We show that the zero-energy\nLandau level (LL) in monolayer graphene, which is predicted to be magnetic\nfield ($B$)-independent, can float up above the Fermi energy at low $B$. This\nis supported by the temperature ($T$)-driven flow diagram approximated by the\nsemi-circle law as well as the $T$-independent point in the Hall conductivity\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ near $e^2/h$. Our experimental data are in sharp contrast to\nconventional understanding of the zeroth LL and metallic-like behavior in\npristine graphene prepared by mechanical exfoliation at low $T$. This\nsurprising result can be ascribed to substrate-induced sublattice symmetry\nbreaking which splits the degeneracy of the zeroth Landau level. Our finding\nprovides a unified picture regarding the metallic behavior in pristine graphene\nprepared by mechanical exfoliation, and the insulating behavior and the\ninsulator-quantum Hall transition in monolayer epitaxial graphene.\n", "  Density-functional theory calculations are used to verify the atomic\nstructure of the $\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$ silicene phase grown on the\nAg(111) surface. Recent experimental studies strongly suggested that the\nprevious double-layer silicene model should be replaced with a Ag-mixed\ndouble-layer model resembling the top layers of the\nAg/Si(111)-($\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$) surface. In our calculations, the\nAg-mixed double-layer model is indeed energetically favored over the\ndouble-layer silicene model and well reproduces the reported scanning-tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy data. Especially, the structural origin of the\nexperimental band structure is clarified as the top Ag-Si mixed layer, unlike\nthe experimental interpretations as either a silicene layer or the Ag(111)\nsubstrate.\n", "  Within the framework of a Beyond Standard Model (BSM) with a local $SU(3)$\nfamily symmetry, we report an updated fit of parameters which account for the\nknown spectrum of quarks and charged lepton masses and the quark mixing in a\n$4\\times 4$ non-unitary $V_{CKM}$. In this scenario, ordinary heavy fermions,\ntop and bottom quarks and tau lepton, become massive at tree level from Dirac\nSee-saw mechanisms implemented by the introduction of a new set of $SU(2)_L$\nweak singlet vector-like fermions, $U,D,E,N$, with $N$ a sterile neutrino. The\n$N_{L,R}$ sterile neutrinos allow the implementation of a $8\\times 8$ general\nSee-saw Majorana neutrino mass matrix with four massless eigenvalues at tree\nlevel. Hence, light fermions, including neutrinos, obtain masses from loop\nradiative corrections mediated by the massive $SU(3)$ gauge bosons. $SU(3)$\nfamily symmetry is broken spontaneously in two stages, whose hierarchy of\nscales yield an approximate $SU(2)$ global symmetry associated with the $Z_1,\nY_1^\\pm$ gauge boson masses of the order of 2 TeV. A global fit of parameters\nto include neutrino masses and lepton mixing is in progress.\n", "  Three-wave mixing of ordinary and backward electromagnetic waves in pulsed\nregime is investigated in the metamaterials, which enable co-existence and\nphase matching of such waves. It is shown that opposite direction of phase\nvelocity and energy flux in backward waves gives rise to extraordinary\ntransient processes in greatly enhanced optical parametric amplification and in\nfrequency up or down shifting nonlinear reflectivity. The discovered transients\nresemble slowed response of an oscillator on pulsed excitation in the vicinity\nof its resonance\n", "  It is shown by the Wilson numerical renormalization group method that a\nstrongly correlated impurity with a crystalline-electric-field singlet ground\nstate in the f^2-configuration exhibits an anomalous local Fermi liquid state\nin which the static magnetic susceptibility remains an uncorrelated value while\nthe NMR relaxation rate is enhanced in proportion to the square of the mass\nenhancement factor. Namely, the Korringa-Shiba relation is apparently broken.\nThis feature closely matches the anomalous behaviors observed in UPt_3, i.e.,\nthe coexistence of an unenhanced value of the Knight shift due to\nquasiparticles contribution (the decrease across the superconducting\ntransition) and the enhanced relaxation rate of NMR. Such an anomalous Fermi\nliquid behavior suggests that the Fermi liquid corrections for the\nsusceptibility are highly anisotropic.\n", "  The process of fermion production in the field of a magnetic dipole on a de\nSitter expanding universe is analyzed. The amplitude and probability for\nproduction of massive fermions are obtained using the exact solution of the\nDirac equation written in the momentum-helicity basis. We found that the most\nprobable transitions are those that generate the fermion pair perpendicular to\nthe direction of the magnetic field. The behavior of the probability is\ngraphically studied for large/small values of the expansion factor, and a\ndetailed analysis of the probability in terms of the angle between the momenta\nvectors of the particle and antiparticle is performed. The phenomenon of\nfermion production is significant only at large expansion which corresponds to\nthe conditions from the early Universe. When the expansion factor vanishes we\nrecover the Minkowski limit where this process is forbidden by the simultaneous\nenergy-momentum conservation.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize a secured direct communication process between N\nusers with partial and full cooperation of quantum server. The security\nanalysis of authentication and communication processes against many types of\nattacks proved that the attacker cannot gain any information during\nintercepting either authentication or communication processes. Hence, the\nsecurity of transmitted message among N users is ensured as the attacker\nintroduces an error probability irrespective of the sequence of measurement.\n", "  We provide an algorithm for generation of momenta (or energies) of\nrelativistic particles according to the relativistic Bose-Einstein or\nFermi-Dirac distributions. The algorithm uses rejection method with effectively\nselected comparison function so that the acceptance rate of the generated\nvalues is always better than 0.9. It might find its use in Monte-Carlo\ngenerators of particles from reactions in high-energy physics.\n", "  In this paper, we report the effect of filament radius and filament\nresistivity on the saturated temperature of ZnO, TiO2, WO3 and HfO2 Resistive\nRandom Access Memory (RRAM) devices. We resort to the thermal reaction model of\nRRAM for the present analysis. The results substantiate decrease in saturated\ntemperature with increase in the radius and resistivity of filament for the\ninvestigated RRAM devices. Moreover, a sudden change in the saturated\ntemperature at a lower value of filament radius and resistivity is observed as\nagainst the steady change at the medium and higher value of the filament radius\nand resistivity. Results confirm the dependence of saturated temperature on the\nfilament size and resistivity in RRAM.\n", "  We present a simple order book mechanism that regulates an artificial\nfinancial market with self-organized criticality dynamics and fat tails of\nreturns distribution. The model shows the role played by individual imitation\nin determining trading decisions, while fruitfully replicates typical aggregate\nmarket behavior as the \"self-fulfilling prophecy\". We also address the role of\nrandom traders as a possible decentralized solution to dampen market\nfluctuations.\n", "  The extension of the Ramo-Schockley-Pellegrini theorem for quantum systems\nallows to define a positive-operator valued measure (POVM) for the total\nconduction plus displacement electrical current. The resulting current operator\nis characterized by two parameters, viz. the width of the associated Gaussian\nfunctions and the lapse of time between consecutive measurements. For large\nGaussian dispersions and small time intervals, the operator obeys to a\ncontinuous weak-measurement scheme. Contrarily, in the limit of very narrow\nGaussian widths and a single-shot measurement, the operator corresponds to a\nstandard von Neumann (projective) measurement. We have implemented the\nresulting measurement protocol into a quantum electron transport simulator.\nNumerical results for a resonant tunneling diode show the great sensibility of\ncurrent-voltage characteristics to different parameter configurations of the\ntotal current operator.\n", "  Closed quantum systems obey the Schroedinger equation whereas nonequilibrium\nbehavior of many of systems is routinely described in terms of classical,\nMarkovian stochastic processes. Evidently, there are fundamental differences\nbetween those two types of behavior. We discuss the conditions under which the\nunitary dynamics may be mapped onto pertinent classical stochastic processes.\nThis is first principally addressed based on the notions of \"consistency\" and\n\"Markovianity.\" Numerical data are presented that show that the above\nconditions are to good approximation fulfilled for Heisenberg-type spin models\ncomprising 12-20 spins. The accuracy to which these conditions are met\nincreases with system size.\n", "  Cu(pz)2(ClO4)2 (with pz denoting pyrazine, C4H4N2) is among the best\nrealizations of a two-dimensional spin-1/2 square-lattice antiferromagnet.\nBelow T_N = 4.21 K, its weak interlayer couplings induce a 3D magnetic order,\nstrongly influenced by external magnetic fields and/or hydrostatic pressure.\nPrevious work, focusing on the [H, T] phase diagram, identified a spin-flop\ntransition, resulting in a field-tunable bicritical point. However, the\ninfluence of external pressure has not been investigated yet. Here we explore\nthe extended [p, H, T] phase diagram of Cu(pz)2(ClO4)2 under pressures up to 12\nkbar and magnetic fields up to 7.1 T, via magnetometry and 35Cl nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The application of magnetic fields\nenhances T_XY , the crossover temperature from the Heisenberg to the XY model,\nthus pointing to an enhancement of the effective anisotropy. The applied\npressure has an opposite effect [dT_N/dp = 0.050(8) K/kbar], as it modifies\nmarginally the interlayer couplings, but likely changes more significantly the\norbital reorientation and the square-lattice deformation. This results in a\nremodeling of the effective Hamiltonian, whereby the field and pressure effects\ncompensate each other. Finally, by comparing the experimental data with\nnumerical simulations we estimate T_BKT, the temperature of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless topological transition and argue why it is\ninaccessible in our case.\n", "  This paper presents an investigation of the dynamics of two coupled\nnon-identical FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons with quadratic term and delayed synaptic\nconnection. We consider coupling strength and time delay as bifurcation\nparameters, and try to classify all possible dynamics. Bifurcation diagrams are\nobtained numerically or analytically from the mathematical model, and the\nparameter regions of different behaviors are clarified. The neural system\nexhibits a unique rest point or three ones by employing the saddle-node\nbifurcation, when strong coupling is applied in the system. Also the trivial\nrest point shows transcritical bifurcation with one of the new rest points. The\nasymptotic stability and possible Hopf and Bautin bifurcations of the trivial\nrest point are studied by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation.\nFold cycle, torus, fold-torus, and big homoclinic bifurcations of limit cycles,\ntogether with $1:1$ and $1:4$ resonances are found. The delay-dependent\nstability regions are illustrated in the parameter plane, through which the\ndouble-Hopf, Hopf-transcritical, and double-zero bifurcation points can be\nobtained from the intersection of different bifurcation branches. Various\npatterns of multistability have been observed, both for small and large values\nof delay. The system may exhibit synchronous and anti-phase periodic solutions,\nwhich occur due to Hopf, fold cycle and torus bifurcations. By increasing the\nrange of parameter $\\tau$ other branches of fold and torus bifurcations appear,\nwhich lead to creation of more stable periodic solutions.\n", "  We present a simple spherically symmetric and regular solution of Einstein's\nequations with two parameters $k$ and $M$, which matches to Schwarzschild's\nsolution, satisfies the weak energy conditions in the interior region and for\nsmall $r$ behaves like the de Sitter solution. Its energy density $\\rho$ and\nits radial pressure $p_r$ satisfy the relation $\\rho+p_r=0$. For some values of\n$k/M$ the solution does not have an event horizon and the event horizon of\nSchwarzschild's solution is inside the matching surface. Therefore it describes\nthe formation of a gravitational soliton, which is shown to be stable.\nGravitational solitons are related to dark matter. For the other values of\n$k/M$ it is a regular black hole solution.\n", "  The brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the majority of relaxed, cool core\ngalaxy clusters is radio loud, showing non-thermal radio jets and lobes ejected\nby the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). Such relativistic plasma has been\nunambiguously shown to interact with the surrounding thermal intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) thanks to spectacular images where the lobe radio emission is\nobserved to fill the cavities in the X-ray-emitting gas. This `radio-mode AGN\nfeedback' phenomenon, which is thought to quench cooling flows, is widespread\nand is critical to understand the physics of the inner regions of galaxy\nclusters and the properties of the central BCG. At the same time,\nmechanically-powerful AGN are likely to drive turbulence in the central ICM\nwhich may contribute to gas heating and also play a role for the origin of\nnon-thermal emission on cluster-scales. Diffuse non-thermal emission has been\nobserved in a number of cool core clusters in the form of a radio mini-halo\nsurrounding the radio-loud BCG on scales comparable to that of the cooling\nregion. This contribution outlines the main points covered by the talk on these\ntopics. In particular, after summarizing the cooling flow regulation by AGN\nheating and the non-thermal emission from cool core clusters, we present a\nrecent study of the largest collection of known mini-halo clusters (~ 20\nobjects) which investigated the scenario of a common origin of radio mini-halos\nand gas heating. We further discuss the prospects offered by future radio\nsurveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for building large (>> 100\nobjects), unbiased mini-halo samples while probing at the same time the\npresence of radio-AGN feedback in the host clusters.\n", "  Necessary conditions are obtained for certain types of rational delay\ndifferential equations to admit a non-rational meromorphic solution of\nhyper-order less than one. The equations obtained include delay Painlev\\'e\nequations and equations solved by elliptic functions.\n", "  We investigate the processes that lead to the generation of mean flows in\ntwo-dimensional anelastic convection. The simple model consists of a plane\nlayer that is rotating about an axis inclined to gravity. The results are\ntwo-fold: firstly we numerically investigate the onset of convection in\nthree-dimensions, paying particular attention to the role of stratification and\nhighlight a curious symmetry. Secondly, we investigate the mechanisms that\ndrive both zonal and meridional flows in two dimensions. We find that, in\ngeneral, non-trivial Reynolds stresses can lead to systematic flows and, using\nstatistical measures, we quantify the role of stratification in modifying the\ncoherence of these flows.\n", "  Influence of permanent magnetic field up to 7.5 T on plasma emission and\nlaser-assisted Au nanoparticles fragmentation in water is experimentally\nstudied. It is found that presence of magnetic field causes the breakdown\nplasma emission to start earlier regarding to laser pulse. Field presence also\naccelerates the fragmentation of nanoparticles down to a few nanometers.\nDependence of Au NPs fragmentation rate in water on magnetic field intensity is\ninvestigated. The results are discussed on the basis of laser-induced plasma\ninteraction with magnetic field.\n", "  We extend the Eckart theorem, from the ground state to excited statew, which\nintroduces an energy augmentation to the variation criterion for excited\nstates. It is shown that the energy of a very good excited state trial function\ncan be slightly lower than the exact eigenvalue. Further, the energy calculated\nby the trial excited state wave function, which is the closest to the exact\neigenstate through Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization to a ground state\napproximant, is lower than the exact eigenvalue as well. In order to avoid the\nvariation restrictions inherent in the upper bound variation theory based on\nHylleraas, Undheim, and McDonald [HUM] and Eckart Theorem, we have proposed a\nnew variation functional Omega-n and proved that it has a local minimum at the\neigenstates, which allows approaching the eigenstate unlimitedly by variation\nof the trial wave function. As an example, we calculated the energy and the\nradial expectation values of Triplet-S(even) Helium atom by the new variation\nfunctional, and by HUM and Eckart theorem, respectively, for comparison. Our\npreliminary numerical results reveal that the energy of the calculated excited\nstates 3rd Triplet-S(even) and 4th Triplet-S(even) may be slightly lower than\nthe exact eigenvalue (inaccessible by HUM theory) according to the General\nEckart Theorem proved here, while the approximate wave function is better than\nHUM.\n", "  -- A scientific hurdle in manufacturing solid films by drying colloidal\nlayers is preventing them from fracturing. This paper examines how the drying\nrate of colloidal liquids influences the particle packing at the nanoscale in\ncorrelation with the crack patterns observed at the macroscale. Increasing the\ndrying rate results in more ordered, denser solid structures, and the dried\nsamples have more cracks.Yet, introducing a holding period (at a prescribed\npoint) during the drying protocol results in a more disordered solid structure\nwith significantly less cracks. To interpret these observations, this paper\nconjectures that a longer drying protocol favors the formation of aggregates.\nIt is further argued that the number and size of the aggregates increase as the\ndrying rate decreases. This results in the formation of a more disordered,\nporous film from the viewpoint of the particle packing, and a more resistant\nfilm, i.e. less cracks, from the macroscale viewpoint.\n", "  An argument is given to associate integrable nonintegrable transition of\ndiscrete maps with the transition of Lawvere's fixed point theorem to its own\ncontrapositive. We show that the classical description of nonlinear maps is\nneither complete nor totally predictable.\n", "  Multiferroics are promising for sensor and memory applications, but despite\nall efforts invested in their research no single-phase material displaying both\nferroelectricity and large magnetization at room-temperature has hitherto been\nreported. This situation has substantially been improved in the novel relaxor\nferroelectric single-phase , where polar nanoregions (PNR) transform into\nstatic-PNR (SPNR) as evidenced by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and\nsimultaneously enable congruent multiferroic clusters (MFC) to emerge from\ninherent ferrimagnetic Bi(Fe,Co)O3 regions as verified by magnetic force\nmicroscopy (MFM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). On these MFC,\nexceptionally large direct and converse magnetoelectric coupling coefficients,\nat room-temperature, were measured by PFM and MFM respectively. We expect the\nnon-ergodic relaxor properties which are governed by the Bi0.5K0.5TiO3\ncomponent to play a vital role in the strong ME coupling, by providing an\nelectrically and mechanically flexible environment to MFC. This new class of\nnon-ergodic relaxor multiferroics bears great potential for applications.\nEspecially the prospect of a ME nanodot storage device seems appealing.\n", "  In this talk I summarize the physics case of the International Linear\nCollider (ILC) focusing on its potential towards discovery, discrimation or\ndisentanglement of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).\n", "  We study a variational model for the quasistatic growth of cracks with\nfractional di- mension in brittle materials. We give a minimal set of\nproperties of the collection of admissible cracks which ensure the existence of\na quasistatic evolution. Both the an- tiplane and the planar cases are treated.\n", "  The current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which\ndisrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the prevailing view of\nsociety is based on the ontological primacy of stable hierarchical structures,\nwhich is no longer adequate.\n  We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing\nsocial system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it\nfollows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of\nindividuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive\nprocesses in the evolution of a system.\n  The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system -- an ecology of\ninteracting social subsystems -- each of which is also a living cognitive\nsystem. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social\nsystems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The\nLiving Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics\nand the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of\nInformation and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work.\n  We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research -- distributed\nsocial governance -- which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on\nstable structures within global society.\n", "  Hard X-ray spectra of 28 bright Seyfert galaxies observed with INTEGRAL were\nanalyzed together with the X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Suzaku and RXTE.\nThese broad-band data were fitted with a model assuming a thermal\nComptonization as a primary continuum component. We tested several model\noptions through a fitting of the Comptonized continuum accompanied by a complex\nabsorption and a Compton reflection. Both the large data set used and the model\nspace explored allowed us to accurately determine a mean temperature kTe of the\nelectron plasma, the Compton parameter y and the Compton reflection strength R\nfor the majority of objects in the sample. Our main finding is that a vast\nmajority of the sample (20 objects) is characterized by kTe < 100 keV, and only\nfor two objects we found kTe > 200 keV. The median kTe for entire sample is\n48(-14,+57) keV. The distribution of the y parameter is bimodal, with a broad\ncomponent centered at ~0.8 and a narrow peak at ~1.1. A complex, dual absorber\nmodel improved the fit for all data sets, compared to a simple absorption\nmodel, reducing the fitted strength of Compton reflection by a factor of about\n2. Modest reflection (median R ~0.32) together with a high ratio of Comptonized\nto seed photon fluxes point towards a geometry with a compact hard X-ray\nemitting region well separated from the accretion disc. Our results imply that\nthe template Seyferts spectra used in AGN population synthesis models should be\nrevised.\n", "  Supersymmetry can explain the observed dark matter relic density with a\nneutralino dark matter particle and a coannihilating, almost mass-degenerate\nsparticle. If this were the case in nature, a linear electron positron collider\nlike the ILC could discover the two sparticles if their masses are in the\nkinematic reach of the collider. This contribution discusses which observations\nare necessary at the ILC for predicting the dark matter relic density correctly\nand for confirming that the observed lightest neutralino is the only kind of\ndark matter. We take the case of stau coannihilation as an example.\n", "  Prompt neutrino fluxes due to the interactions of high-energy cosmic rays\nwith the Earth's atmosphere are backgrounds in the search for high-energy\nneutrinos of galactic or extra-galactic origin performed by Very Large Volume\nNeutrino Telescopes. We summarize our predictions for prompt neutrinos, showing\ntheir basic features as emerging from the calculation in a QCD framework\ncapable of describing recent charm data from the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  In this paper we present a kinetic model with stochastic game-type\ninteractions, analyzing the relationship between the level of political\ncompetition in a society and the degree of economic liberalization. The above\nissue regards the complex interactions between economy and institutional\npolicies intended to introduce technological innovations in a society, where\ntechnological innovations are intended in a broad sense comprehending reforms\ncritical to production. A special focus is placed on the political replacement\neffect described in a macroscopic model by Acemoglu and Robinson (AR-model,\nhenceforth), which can determine the phenomenon of innovation 'blocking',\npossibly leading to economic backwardness. One of the goals of our modelization\nis to obtain a mesoscopic dynamical model whose macroscopic outputs are\nqualitatively comparable with stylized facts of the AR-model. A set of\nnumerical solutions is presented showing the non monotonous relationship\nbetween economic liberization and political competition, which can be\nconsidered as an emergent phenomenon of the complex socio-economic interaction\ndynamic.\n", "  We demonstrate the use of a compound optical cavity as linear displacement\ndetector, by measuring the thermal motion of a silicon nitride suspended\nmembrane acting as the external mirror of a near-infrared Littrow laser diode.\nFluctuations in the laser optical power induced by the membrane vibrations are\ncollected by a photodiode integrated within the laser, and then measured with a\nspectrum analyzer. The dynamics of the membrane driven by a piezoelectric\nactuator is investigated as a function of air pressure and actuator\ndisplacement in a homodyne configuration. The high Q-factor ($\\sim 3.4\\cdot\n10^4$ at $8.3 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ mbar) of the fundamental mechanical mode at $\\sim\n73$ kHz guarantees a detection sensitivity high enough for direct measurement\nof thermal motion at room temperature ($\\sim 87$ pm RMS). The compound cavity\nsystem here introduced can be employed as a table-top, cost-effective linear\ndisplacement detector for cavity optomechanics. Furthermore, thanks to the\nstrong optical nonlinearities of the laser compound cavity, these systems open\nnew perspectives in the study of non-Markovian quantum properties at the\nmesoscale.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the contribution of dust scattering to the\ndiffuse H-alpha emission observed in nearby galaxies. As initial conditions for\nthe spatial distribution of HII regions, gas, and dust, we take three Milky\nWay-like galaxies from state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations\nthat implement different prescriptions for star formation, feedback, and\nchemical enrichment. Radiative transfer has been solved a posteriori, using the\npublicly-available Monte Carlo code Sunrise to take into account dust\nabsorption and scattering of the H-alpha photons, originating exclusively from\nthe HII regions. No contribution from recombinations in the diffuse ionized gas\n(DIG) component is explicitly or implicitly included in our model. Our main\nresult is that the flux arising from scattered light is of the order of 1-2 per\ncent of the H-alpha flux coming directly from the HII regions. Building upon\nprevious studies, we conclude that the DIG contributes lass than 50 per cent of\nthe total H-alpha emission.\n", "  In this article we will construct the most general torsion-free\nparity-invariant covariant theory of gravity that is free from ghost-like and\ntachyonic nstabilities around constant curvature space-times in four\ndimensions. Specifically, this includes the Minkowski, de Sitter and anti-de\nSitter backgrounds. We will first argue in details how starting from a general\ncovariant action for the metric one arrives at an \"equivalent\" action that at\nmost contains terms that are quadratic in curvatures but nevertheless is\nsufficient for the purpose of studying stability of the original action. We\nwill then briefly discuss how such a \"quadratic curvature action\" can be\ndecomposed in a covariant formalism into separate sectors involving the tensor,\nvector and scalar modes of the metric tensor; most of the details of the\nanalysis however, will be presented in an accompanying paper. We will find that\nonly the transverse and trace-less spin-2 graviton with its two helicity states\nand possibly a spin-0 Brans-Dicke type scalar degree of freedom are left to\npropagate in 4 dimensions. This will also enable us to arrive at the\nconsistency conditions required to make the theory perturbatively stable around\nconstant curvature backgrounds.\n  This will be included as a chapter in the book entitled \"At the Frontier of\nSpacetime - Scalar-Tensor Theory, Bells Inequality, Machs Principle, Exotic\nSmoothness\" (Springer 2016)\n", "  The mixing of an impurity into a flowing fluid is an important process in\nmany areas of science, including geophysical processes, chemical reactors, and\nmicrofluidic devices. In some cases, for example periodic flows, the concepts\nof nonlinear dynamics provide a deep theoretical basis for understanding\nmixing. Unfortunately, the building blocks of this theory, i.e. the fixed\npoints and invariant manifolds of the associated Poincare map, have remained\ninaccessible to direct experimental study, thus limiting the insight that could\nbe obtained. Using precision measurements of tracer particle trajectories in a\ntwo-dimensional fluid flow producing chaotic mixing, we directly measure the\ntime-dependent stretching and compression fields. These quantities, previously\navailable only numerically, attain local maxima along lines coinciding with the\nstable and unstable manifolds, thus revealing the dynamical structures that\ncontrol mixing. Contours or level sets of a passive impurity field are found to\nbe aligned parallel to the lines of large compression (unstable manifolds) at\neach instant. This connection appears to persist as the onset of turbulence is\napproached.\n"]}
