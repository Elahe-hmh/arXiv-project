The 9-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries admitted by\nthe model is found. It is shown that the rotating shallow water equations are\nrelated with the classical shallow water model with the change of variables.\nThe derived symmetries are used to generate new exact solutions of the rotating\nshallow equations. In particular, a new class of time-periodic solutions with\nquasi-closed particle trajectories is constructed and studied. The symmetry\nreduction method is also used to obtain some invariant solutions of the model.\nExamples of these solutions are presented with a brief physical interpretation.\n", "  We report clear experimental signatures of the theoretically unexpected\ngas-liquid transition in the first three monolayers of $^3$He adsorbed on\ngraphite. The transition is inferred from the linear density dependence of the\n$\\gamma$-coefficient of the heat capacity measured in the degenerate region (2\n$\\le T \\le$80 mK) below a critical liquid density ($\\rho_{c0}$). Surprisingly,\nthe measured $\\rho_{c0}$ values (0.6$\\sim$0.9 nm$^{-2}$) are nearly the same\nfor all these monolayers in spite of their quite different environments. We\nconclude that the ground-state of $^3$He in strict two dimensions is not a\ndilute quantum gas but a self-bound quantum liquid with the lowest density ever\nfound.\n", "  The transition-matrix ($T$-matrix) approach provides a general formalism to\nstudy scattering problems in various areas of physics, including acoustics\n(scalar fields) and electromagnetics (vector fields), and is related to the\ntheory of the scattering matrix ($S$-matrix) used in quantum mechanics and\nquantum field theory. Focusing on electromagnetic scattering, we highlight an\nalternative formulation of the $T$-matrix approach, based on the use of the\nreactance matrix or $K$-matrix, which is more suited to formal studies of\nenergy conservation constraints (such as the optical theorem). We show in\nparticular that electrostatics or quasi-static approximations can be corrected\nwithin this framework to satisfy the energy conservation constraints associated\nwith radiation. A general formula for such a radiative correction is explicitly\nobtained, and empirical expressions proposed in earlier studies are shown to be\nspecial cases of this general formula. This work therefore provides a\njustification of the empirical radiative correction to the dipolar\npolarizability and a generalization of this correction to any types of point or\nbody scatterers of arbitrary shapes, including higher multipolar orders.\n", "  Quantum measurement finds the observed system in a collapsed state, rather\nthan in the state predicted by the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Yet there is a\nrelatively spread opinion that the wavefunction collapse can be explained by\nunitary evolution (for instance in the decoherence approach, if we take into\naccount the environment).\n  In this article it is proven a mathematical result which severely restricts\nthe initial conditions for which measurements have definite outcomes, if pure\nunitary evolution is assumed. This no-go theorem remains true even if we take\nthe environment into account. The result does not forbid a unitary description\nof the measurement process, it only shows that such a description is possible\nonly for very restricted initial conditions.\n  The existence of such restrictions of the initial conditions can be\nunderstood in the four-dimensional block universe perspective, as a requirement\nof global self-consistency of the solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  Scale independence is a ubiquitous feature of complex systems which implies a\nhighly skewed distribution of resources with no characteristic scale. Research\nhas long focused on why systems as varied as protein networks, evolution and\nstock actions all feature scale independence. Assuming that they simply do, we\nfocus here on describing how this behaviour emerges, in contrast to more\nidealized models usually considered. We arrive at the conjecture that a minimal\nmodel to explain the growth towards scale independence involves only two\ncoupled dynamical features: the first is the well-known preferential attachment\nprinciple and the second is a general form of delayed temporal scaling. While\nthe first is sufficient, the second is present in all studied data and appears\nto maximize the speed of convergence to true scale independence. The delay in\nthis temporal scaling acts as a coupling between population growth and\nindividual activity. Together, these two dynamical properties appear to pave a\nprecise evolution path, such that even an instantaneous snapshot of a\ndistribution is enough to reconstruct the past of the system and predict its\nfuture. We validate our approach and confirm its usefulness on diverse spheres\nof human activities ranging from scientific and artistic productivity, to\nsexual relations and online traffic.\n", "  Transformation optics is a powerful tool to design various novel devices,\nsuch as invisibility cloak. Fantastic effects from this technique are usually\naccompanied with singular mappings, resulting in challenging implementations\nand narrow bands of working frequencies. Here in this article, we find that\nFabry-P\\'erot resonances can be used to design various transformation optical\ndevices that are not only easy to realize but also can work well for a set of\nresonant frequencies (multiple frequencies). As an example, we fabricate a\nprototype for a cylindrical concentrator for microwaves.\n", "  The one-dimension Russo--Smereka kinetic equation describing the propagation\nof nonlinear concentration waves in a rarefied bubbly fluid is considered.\nReductions of the model to finite component systems are derived. Stability of\nthe bubbly flow in terms of hyperbolicity of the kinetic equation is studied.\nConservation form of the model is proposed and numerical solution of the Cauchy\nproblem with discontinuous initial data is obtained.\n", "  The objective of the present study is twofold. First, the last developments\nand validation results of a hybrid model designed to simulate fire patterns in\nheterogeneous landscapes are presented. The model combines the features of a\nstochastic small-world network model with those of a deterministic\nsemi-physical model of the interaction between burning and non-burning cells\nthat strongly depends on local conditions of wind, topography, and vegetation.\nRadiation and convection from the flaming zone, and radiative heat loss to the\nambient are considered in the preheating process of unburned cells. Second, the\nmodel is applied to an Australian grassland fire experiment as well as to a\nreal fire that took place in Corsica in 2009. Predictions compare favorably to\nexperiments in terms of rate of spread, area and shape of the burn. Finally,\nthe sensitivity of the model outcomes (here the rate of spread) to six input\nparameters is studied using a two-level full factorial design.\n", "  Over the last two decades, lattice Boltzmann methods have become an\nincreasingly popular tool to compute the flow in complex geometries such as\nporous media. In addition to single phase simulations allowing, for example, a\nprecise quantification of the permeability of a porous sample, a number of\nextensions to the lattice Boltzmann method are available which allow to study\nmultiphase and multicomponent flows on a pore scale level. In this article we\ngive an extensive overview on a number of these diffuse interface models and\ndiscuss their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, we shortly report on\nmultiphase flows containing solid particles, as well as implementation details\nand optimization issues.\n", "  We prove that whenever the coherent information of a one-mode Gaussian\nchannel is non-zero its supremum is achieved for the infinite input power. This\nis a well established fact for the zero added classical noise, whereas the\nnonzero case has not been studied in detail. The presented analysis fills the\ngap for three canonical classes of one-mode Gaussian channels: the lossy,\namplifying and additive classical noise channel class. For the remaining\none-mode Gaussian channel classes the coherent information is known to vanish.\n", "  A finite and unitary nonlocal formulation of quantum gravity is applied to\nthe cosmological constant problem. The entire functions in momentum space at\nthe graviton-standard model particle loop vertices generate an exponential\nsuppression of the vacuum density and the cosmological constant to produce\nagreement with their observational bounds.\n", "  A mixed quantal-semiquantal theory is presented in which the semiquantal\nsqueezed-state wave packet describes the heavy degrees of freedom. We first\nderive mean-field equations of motion from the time-dependent variational\nprinciple. Then, in order to take into account the interparticle correlation,\nin particular the 'quantum backreaction' beyond the mean-field approximation,\nwe introduce the stochastic particle description for both the quantal and\nsemiquantal parts. A numerical application on a model of O2 scattering from a\nPt surface demonstrates that the proposed scheme gives correct asymptotic\nbehavior of the scattering probability, with improvement over the mixed\nquantum-classical scheme with Bohmian particles, which is comprehended by\ncomparing the Bohmian and the stochastic trajectories.\n", "  The geometric approach [1312.1262] to iterated variations of local\nfunctionals -- e.g., of the (master-)action functional -- resulted in an\nextension of the deformation quantisation technique to the set-up of Poisson\nmodels of field theory [IHES/M/15/13]. It also allowed of a rigorous proof\n([1312.1262],[1210.0726]) for the main inter-relations between the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky (BV) Laplacian $\\Delta$ and variational Schouten bracket.\nThe ad hoc use of these relations had been a known analytic difficulty in the\nBV-formalism for quantisation of gauge systems; now achieved, the proof does\nactually not require the assumption of graded-commutativity [1210.0726].\nExplained in our previous work, geometry's self-regularisation is rendered by\nGel'fand's calculus of singular linear integral operators supported on the\ndiagonal.\n  We now illustrate that analytic technique by inspecting the validity\nmechanism [1312.4140] for the graded Jacobi identity which the variational\nSchouten bracket does satisfy (whence $\\Delta^2=0$, i.e., the BV-Laplacian is a\ndifferential acting in the algebra of local functionals). By using one tuple of\nthree variational multi-vectors twice, we contrast the new logic of iterated\nvariations -- when the right-hand side of Jacobi's identity vanishes altogether\n-- with the old method: interlacing its steps and stops, it could produce some\nnon-zero representative of the trivial class in the top-degree horizontal\ncohomology. But we then show at once by an elementary counterexample why, in\nthe frames of the old approach that did not rely on Gel'fand's calculus, the\nBV-Laplacian failed to be a graded derivation of the variational Schouten\nbracket.\n  Keywords: Variational multi-vectors, Schouten bracket, Jacobi identity,\nBatalin-Vilkovisky Laplacian, symbolic computations.\n  PACS: 02.40.-k, 11.10.-z; also 02.30.Ik, 02.30.Jr, 11.15.-q, 11.30.-j\n", "  The conditions of critical coupling of light to Tamm plasmons are\ninvestigated with comprehensive numerical simulations, highlighting the\nparameters that maximise absorption of incident light in the metal layer. The\nasymmetric response in reflection and absorption with respect to the direction\nof incidence is discussed, the two cases yielding different optimal coupling\nconditions. These findings are relevant for the design of optimised Tamm\nstructures, particularly in applications such as narrow-band thermal emitters,\nfield-enhanced spectroscopy and refractive-index sensing.\n", "  Using the latest observational data we obtain a lower bound on the initial\nvalue of the quintessence field in thawing quintessence models of dark energy.\nFor potentials of the form V(\\phi) \\phi^{\\pm2} we find that the initial value\n|\\phi_i|>7x10^{18}\\gev. We then relate \\phi_i to the duration of inflation by\nassuming that the initial value of the quintessence field is determined by\nquantum fluctuations of the quintessence field during inflation. From the lower\nbound on $\\phi_i$ we obtain a lower bound on the number of e-foldings of\ninflation, namely, N>2x10^{11}. We obtain similar bounds for other power law\npotentials for which too we obtain |\\phi_{i}|>O(M_{P}.\n", "  A time evolution operator in the interaction picture is given by\nexponentiating an interaction Hamiltonian $H$. Important examples of\nHamiltonians, often encountered in quantum optics, condensed matter and high\nenergy physics, are of a general form $H=r(A^\\dagger-A)$, where $A$ is a\nmultimode boson operator and $r$ is the coupling constant. If no simple\nfactorization formula for the evolution operator exists, the calculation of the\nevolution operator is a notoriously difficult problem. In this case the only\navailable option may be to Taylor expand the operator in $r$ and act on a state\nof interest $\\psi$. But this brute-force method quickly hits the complexity\nbarrier since the number of evaluated expressions increases exponentially. We\nrelate a combinatorial structure called Dyck paths to the action of a boson\nword (monomial) and a large class of monomial sums on a quantum state $\\psi$.\nThis allows us to cross the exponential gap and make the problem of a boson\nunitary operator evaluation computationally tractable by achieving\npolynomial-time complexity for an extensive family of physically interesting\nmultimode Hamiltonians. We further test our method on a cubic boson Hamiltonian\nwhose Taylor series is known to diverge for all nonzero values of the coupling\nconstant and an analytic continuation via a Pad\\'e approximant must be\nperformed.\n", "  The effect of the intersite and interplane Coulomb interactions between the\nDirac fermions on the formation of the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity in\nbilayer doped graphene is studied disregarding the effects of the van der Waals\npotential of the substrate and both magnetic and non-magnetic impurities. The\nphase diagram determining the boundaries of superconductive domains with\ndifferent types of symmetry of the order parameter is built using the extended\nHubbard model in the Born weak-coupling approximation with allowance for the\nintratomic, interatomic, and interlayer Coulomb interactions between electrons.\nIt is shown that the Kohn-Luttinger polarization contributions up to the second\norder of perturbation theory in the Coulomb interaction inclusively and an\naccount for the long-range intraplane Coulomb interactions significantly affect\nthe competition between the superconducting $f-$, $p+ip-$, and $d+id-$wave\npairings. It is demonstrated that the account for the interplane Coulomb\ninteraction enhances the critical temperature of the transition to the\nsuperconducting phase.\n", "  We analyze the conditions under which a statistical error analysis can be\ncarried out in the case of $\\pi\\pi$ scattering, namely the normality of\nresiduals in the conventional $\\chi^2$-fit method. Here we check that the\ncurrent and benchmarking analyses only present very small violations of the\nnormality requirements. In particular, we show how it is possible to amend\nslightly the selection of the experimental data, and improve the normality of\nresiduals.\n  As an example, we discuss the $0^{++}$ channel and the implications for the\n$f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances, obtaining that the new selection of data\nprovides very similar and compatible results. In addition, the effect on the\n$f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonance pole parameters is almost negligible, which\nreinforces the central results and the uncertainty analysis performed in these\nbenchmarking determinations.\n", "  We consider oscillators evolving subject to a periodic driving force that\ndynamically entangles them, and argue that this gives the linearized evolution\naround periodic orbits in a general chaotic Hamiltonian dynamical system. We\nshow that the entanglement entropy, after tracing over half of the oscillators,\ngenerically asymptotes to linear growth at a rate given by the sum of the\npositive Lyapunov exponents of the system. These exponents give a classical\nentropy growth rate, in the sense of Kolmogorov, Sinai and Pesin. We also\ncalculate the dependence of this entropy on linear mixtures of the oscillator\nHilbert space factors, to investigate the dependence of the entanglement\nentropy on the choice of coarse-graining. We find that for almost all choices\nthe asymptotic growth rate is the same.\n", "  We study the models with the Majorana neutrino masses generated radiatively\nby two-loop diagrams due to the Yukawa $\\rho \\bar \\ell_R^c \\ell_R$ and\neffective $\\rho^{\\pm\\pm} W^\\mp W^\\mp$ couplings along with a scalar triplet\n$\\Delta$, where $\\rho$ is a doubly charged singlet scalar, $\\ell_R$ the charged\nlepton and $W$ the charged gauge boson. A generic feature in these types of\nmodels is that the neutrino mass spectrum has to be a normal hierarchy.\nFurthermore, by using the neutrino oscillation data and comparing with the\nglobal fitting result in the literature, we find a unique neutrino mass matrix\nand predict the Dirac and two Majorana CP phases to be $1.40\\pi$, $1.11\\pi$ and\n$1.47\\pi$, respectively. We also discuss the model parameters constrained by\nthe lepton flavor violating processes and electroweak oblique parameters. In\naddition, we show that the rate of the neutrinoless double beta decay\n$(0\\nu\\beta\\beta)$ can be as large as the current experimental bound as it is\ndominated by the short-range contribution at tree level, whereas the\ntraditional long-range one is negligible.\n", "  Dark Higgs is very generic in dark matter models where DM is stabilized by\nsome spontaneously broken dark gauge symmetries. Motivated by the FERMI\nobservation of $\\sim$GeV scale $\\gamma$-ray excess from the galactic center\n(GC), we investigate a scenario that a pair of dark matter $X$ annihilates into\na pair of dark Higgs $H_2$, which subsequently decays into standard model\nparticles through its mixing with SM Higgs boson. Besides the two-body decay of\n$H_2$, we also include multibody decay channels of the dark Higgs. We find that\nthe best-fit point is around $M_X\\simeq 95.0$GeV, $M_{H_2}\\simeq 86.7$GeV,\n$\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle\\simeq 4.0\\times 10^{-26}\\textrm{cm}^3\\textrm{/s}$ and\ngives a p-value $\\simeq 0.40$. Implication of this result is described in the\ncontext of dark matter models with dark gauge symmetries. Since such a dark\nHiggs boson is very difficult to produce at colliders, indirect DM detections\nof cosmic $\\gamma$-rays could be an important probe of dark sectors,\ncomplementary to collider searches.\n", "  A central question in quantum information theory is to determine how well\nlost information can be reconstructed. Crucially, the corresponding recovery\noperation should perform well without knowing the information to be\nreconstructed. In this work, we show that the quantum conditional mutual\ninformation measures the performance of such recovery operations. More\nprecisely, we prove that the conditional mutual information $I(A:C|B)$ of a\ntripartite quantum state $\\rho_{ABC}$ can be bounded from below by its distance\nto the closest recovered state $\\mathcal{R}_{B \\to BC}(\\rho_{AB})$, where the\n$C$-part is reconstructed from the $B$-part only and the recovery map\n$\\mathcal{R}_{B \\to BC}$ merely depends on $\\rho_{BC}$. One particular\napplication of this result implies the equivalence between two different\napproaches to define topological order in quantum systems.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the effect of particle size on the motion of\npassive polystyrene spheres in suspensions of Escherichia coli. Using particles\ncovering a range of sizes from 0.6 to 39 microns, we probe particle dynamics at\nboth short and long time scales. In all cases, the particles exhibit\nsuper-diffusive ballistic behavior at short times before eventually\ntransitioning to diffusive behavior. Surprisingly, we find a regime in which\nlarger particles can diffuse faster than smaller particles: the particle\nlong-time effective diffusivity exhibits a peak in particle size, which is a\ndeviation from classical thermal diffusion. We also find that the active\ncontribution to particle diffusion is controlled by a dimensionless parameter,\nthe Peclet number. A minimal model qualitatively explains the existence of the\neffective diffusivity peak and its dependence on bacterial concentration. Our\nresults have broad implications on characterizing active fluids using concepts\ndrawn from classical thermodynamics.\n", "  We examine the behavior of the retarded Green's function in theories with\nLifshitz scaling symmetry, both through dual gravitational models and a direct\nfield theory approach. In contrast with the case of a relativistic CFT, where\nthe Green's function is fixed (up to normalization) by symmetry, the generic\nLifshitz Green's function can a priori depend on an arbitrary function\n$\\mathcal G(\\hat\\omega)$, where $\\hat\\omega=\\omega/|\\vec k|^z$ is the\nscale-invariant ratio of frequency to wavenumber, with dynamical exponent $z$.\nNevertheless, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of the retarded Green's\nfunction (i.e. the spectral function) of scalar operators is exponentially\nsuppressed in a window of frequencies near zero. This behavior is universal in\nall Lifshitz theories without additional constraining symmetries. On the\ngravity side, this result is robust against higher derivative corrections,\nwhile on the field theory side we present two $z=2$ examples where the\nexponential suppression arises from summing the perturbative expansion to\ninfinite order.\n", "  We investigate the Rabi oscillation of an atom placed inside a quantum cavity\nwhere each mirror is formed by a chain of atoms trapped near a one-dimensional\nwaveguide. This proposal was studied previously with the use of Markov\napproximation, where the delay due to the finite travel time of light between\nthe two cavity mirrors is neglected. We show that Rabi oscillation analogous to\nthat obtained with high-finesse classical cavities is achieved only when this\ntravel time is much larger than the time scale that characterizes the\ncollective response of the atomic chain. Therefore, the delay must be taken\ninto account and the dynamics of the problem is inherently non-Markovian.\nParameters of interest such as the Rabi frequency and the cavity loss rate due\nto photon leakage through the mirrors are obtained.\n", "  We analyze the effect of having minimum length on a two dimensional\nanisotropic simple harmonic oscillator with PT symmetric imaginary interaction\nperturbatively. First order correction to the general state is calculated\nanalytically to show that it remains real as long as PT symmetry is unbroken.\nThe characteristics of PT phase transition remain unaltered in this deformed\nformulation of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We revisit the possibility of relating lepton mixing angles with lepton mass\nhierarchies in a model-independent way. Guided by the existence of such\nrelations in the quark sector, we first consider all the mixing angles, both in\ncharged lepton and neutrino sectors to be related to the respective mass\nratios. This allows us to calculate the leptonic mixing angles observed in\nneutrino oscillations as functions of the lightest neutrino mass. We show that\nfor both normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses, this scenario does\nnot give rise to correct leptonic mixing angles. We then show that correct\nleptonic mixing angles can be generated with normal hierarchical neutrino\nmasses if the relation between mixing angle and mass ratio is restricted to 1-2\nand 1-3 mixing in both charged lepton and neutrino sectors leaving the 2-3\nmixing angles as free parameters. We then restrict the lightest neutrino mass\nas well as the difference between 2-3 mixing angles in charged lepton and\nneutrino sectors from the requirement of producing correct leptonic mixing\nangles. We constrain the lightest neutrino mass to be around $0.002$ eV and\nleptonic Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$ such that\n$\\sin^2{\\delta_{CP}}\\sim(0.35-0.50)$. We also construct the leptonic mass\nmatrices in terms of $2-3$ mixing angles and lightest neutrino mass and briefly\ncomment on the possibility of realizing texture zeros in the neutrino mass\nmatrix.\n", "  In a previous publication, we have established a collinearly-improved version\nof the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, which resums to all orders the\nradiative corrections enhanced by large double transverse logarithms. Here, we\nstudy the relevance of this equation as a tool for phenomenology, by\nconfronting it to the HERA data. To that aim, we first improve the perturbative\naccuracy of our resummation, by including two classes of single-logarithmic\ncorrections: those generated by the first non-singular terms in the DGLAP\nsplitting functions and those expressing the one-loop running of the QCD\ncoupling. The equation thus obtained includes all the next-to-leading order\ncorrections to the BK equation which are enhanced by (single or double)\ncollinear logarithms. We then use numerical solutions to this equation to fit\nthe HERA data for the electron-proton reduced cross-section at small Bjorken x.\nWe obtain good quality fits for physically acceptable initial conditions. Our\nbest fit, which shows a good stability up to virtualities as large as Q^2=400\nGeV^2 for the exchanged photon, uses as an initial condition the\nrunning-coupling version of the McLerran-Venugopalan model, with the QCD\ncoupling running according to the smallest dipole prescription.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the notion of hom-big brackets, which is a\ngeneralization of Kosmann-Schwarzbach's big brackets. We show that it gives\nrise to a graded hom-Lie algebra. Thus, it is a useful tool to study\nhom-structures. In particular, we use it to describe hom-Lie bialgebras and\nhom-Nijenhuis operators.\n", "  We prove global existence of appropriate weak solutions for the compressible\nNavier--Stokes equations for more general stress tensor than those covered by\nP.-L. Lions and E. Feireisl's theory. More precisely we focus on more general\npressure laws which are not thermodynamically stable; we are also able to\nhandle some anisotropy in the viscous stress tensor. To give answers to these\ntwo longstanding problems, we revisit the classical compactness theory on the\ndensity by obtaining precise quantitative regularity estimates: This requires a\nmore precise analysis of the structure of the equations combined to a novel\napproach to the compactness of the continuity equation. These two cases open\nthe theory to important physical applications, for instance to describe solar\nevents (virial pressure law), geophysical flows (eddy viscosity) or biological\nsituations (anisotropy).\n", "  In this paper a practical case of a finite periodic Parity Time chain made of\nresonant dielectric cylinders is considered. The paper analyzes a more general\ncase where PT symmetry is achieved by modulating both the real and imaginary\npart of the material refractive index along the resonator chain. The\nband-structure of the finite periodic PT resonator chains is compared to\ninfinite chains in order to understand the complex interdependence of the Bloch\nphase and the amount of the gain/loss in the system that causes the PT symmetry\nto break. The results show that the type of the modulation along the unit cell\ncan significantly affect the position of the threshold point of the PT system.\nIn all cases the lowest threshold is achieved near the end of the Brillouin\nzone. In the case of finite PT-chains, and for a particular type of modulation,\nearly PT symmetry breaking is observed and shown to be caused by the presence\nof termination states localized at the edges of the finite chain resulting in\nlocalized lasing and dissipative modes at each end of the chain.\n", "  Here we report experimental results on the fluctuations of injected power in\nconfined turbulence. Specifically, we have studied a von K\\'arm\\'an swirling\nflow with constant external torque applied to the stirrers. Two experiments\nwere performed at nearly equal Reynolds numbers, in geometrically similar\nexperimental setups. Air was utilized in one of them and water in the other.\nWith air, it was found that the probability density function of power\nfluctuations is strongly asymmetric, while with water, it is nearly Gaussian.\nThis suggests that the outcome of a big change of the fluid density in the\nflow-stirrer interaction is not simply a change in the amplitude of stirrers'\nresponse. In the case of water, with a density roughly 830 times greater than\nair density, the coupling between the flow and the stirrers is stronger, so\nthat they follow more closely the fluctuations of the average rotation of the\nnearby flow. When the fluid is air, the coupling is much weaker. The result is\nnot just a smaller response of the stirrers to the torque exerted by the flow;\nthe PDF of the injected power becomes strongly asymmetric and its spectrum\nacquires a broad region that scales as $f^{-2}$. Thus, the asymmetry of the\nprobability density functions of torque or angular speed could be related to\nthe inability of the stirrers to respond to flow stresses. This happens, for\ninstance, when the torque exerted by the flow is weak, due to small fluid\ndensity, or when the stirrers' moment of inertia is large. Moreover, a\ncorrelation analysis reveals that the features of the energy transfer dynamics\nwith water are qualitatively and quantitatively different to what is observed\nwith air as working fluid.\n", "  We address the issue of the reducibility of the dynamics on a multilayer\nnetwork to an equivalent process on an aggregated single-layer network. As a\ntypical example of models for opinion formation in social networks, we\nimplement the voter model on a two-layer multiplex network, and we study its\ndynamics as a function of two control parameters, namely the fraction of edges\nsimultaneously existing in both layers of the network (edge overlap), and the\nfraction of nodes participating in both layers (interlayer connectivity or\ndegree of multiplexity). We compute the asymptotic value of the number of\nactive links (interface density) in the thermodynamic limit, and the time to\nreach an absorbing state for finite systems, and we compare the numerical\nresults with the analytical predictions on equivalent single-layer networks\nobtained through various possible aggregation procedures. We find a large\nregion of parameters where the interface density of large multiplexes gives\nsystematic deviations from that of the aggregates. We show that neither of the\nstandard aggregation procedures is able to capture the highly nonlinear\nincrease in the lifetime of a finite size multiplex at small interlayer\nconnectivity. These results indicate that multiplexity should be appropriately\ntaken into account when studying voter model dynamics, and that, in general,\nsingle-layer approximations might be not accurate enough to properly understand\nprocesses occurring on multiplex networks, since they might flatten out\nrelevant dynamical details.\n", "  We construct a complete action for open superstring field theory that\nincludes the Neveu-Schwarz sector and the Ramond sector. For the Neveu-Schwarz\nsector, we use the string field in the large Hilbert space of the\nsuperconformal ghost sector, and the action in the Neveu-Schwarz sector is the\nsame as the Wess-Zumino-Witten-like action of the Berkovits formulation. For\nthe Ramond sector, it is known that the BRST cohomology on an appropriate\nsubspace of the small Hilbert space reproduces the correct spectrum, and we use\nthe string field projected to this subspace. We show that the action is\ninvariant under gauge transformations that are consistent with the projection\nfor the string field in the Ramond sector.\n", "  Layered inorganic materials, such as the transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs), have attracted much attention due to their exceptional electronic and\noptical properties. Reliable synthesis and characterization of these materials\nmust be developed if these properties are to be exploited. Herein, we present\nlow-frequency Raman analysis of MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2 and WS2 grown by chemical\nvapour deposition (CVD). Raman spectra are acquired over large areas allowing\nchanges in the position and intensity of the shear and layer-breathing modes to\nbe visualized in maps. This allows detailed characterization of mono- and\nfew-layered TMDs which is complementary to well-established (high-frequency)\nRaman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. This study presents a major stepping\nstone in fundamental understanding of layered materials as mapping the\nlow-frequency modes allows the quality, symmetry, stacking configuration and\nlayer number of 2D materials to be probed over large areas. In addition, we\nreport on anomalous resonance effects in the low-frequency region of the WS2\nRaman spectrum.\n", "  Neutrinos play a crucial role in the collapse and explosion of massive stars,\ngoverning the infall dynamics of the stellar core, triggering and fueling the\nexplosion and driving the cooling and deleptonization of the newly formed\nneutron star. Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of\nthe explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only\ndirect probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.\nIn this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics\nand signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the\ncapability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield\nfaithful information of the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a\nfuture Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would\nprovide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented\nrichness of detail. Exploiting the treasure of the measured neutrino events\nrequires a careful discrimination of source-generated properties from signal\nfeatures that originate on the way to the detector. As for the latter, we\ndiscuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with neutrino-neutrino\ninteractions that occur in the deepest stellar regions; matter effects that\nmodify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical stellar envelope;\nneutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural features associated\nwith the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass motions in post-shock\nlayers. Finally, we highlight our current understanding of the formation of the\ndiffuse supernova neutrino background and we analyse the perspectives for a\ndetection of this relic signal that integrates the contributions from all past\ncore-collapse supernovae in the Universe.\n", "  We study the radio/X-ray correlation in Cyg X-3. It has been known that the\nsoft and hard X-ray fluxes in the hard spectral state are correlated positively\nand negatively, respectively, with the radio flux. We show that this implies\nthat the observed $\\sim$1--100 keV flux (which is a fair approximation to the\nbolometric flux) is completely uncorrelated with the radio flux. We can recover\na positive correlation (seen in other sources and expected theoretically) if\nthe soft X-rays are strongly absorbed by a local medium. Then, however, the\nintrinsic X-ray spectrum of Cyg X-3 in its hard state becomes relatively soft,\nsimilar to that of an intermediate spectral state of black-hole binaries, but\nnot to their true hard state. We also find the radio spectra in the hard state\nof Cyg X-3 are hard on average, and the flux distributions of the radio\nemission and soft X-rays can be described by sums of two log-normal functions.\nWe compare Cyg X-3 with other X-ray binaries using colour-colour,\ncolour-Eddington ratio and Eddington ratio-radio flux diagrams. We find Cyg X-3\nto be spectrally most similar to GRS 1915+105, except that Cyg X-3 is\nsubstantially more radio loud, which appears to be due to its jet emission\nenhanced by interaction with the powerful stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet\ndonor.\n", "  Higgs pair production at the LHC from gluon fusion is small in the Standard\nModel, but can be enhanced in models where a resonant enhancement is allowed.\nWe examine the effect of a resonant contribution from a second scalar arising\nin a model with a gauge singlet scalar field in addition to the usual SU(2)\nscalar doublet, with mass up to $M_H$~600 GeV and discuss the interference\neffects in double Higgs production. We compute the NLO QCD corrections in the\nlarge $m_t$ limit and show that they can significantly distort kinematic\ndistributions near the resonance peak.\n", "  A further development of the evolutionary picture of A+A collisions, which we\ncall the integrated HydroKinetic Model (iHKM), is proposed. The model comprises\na generator of the initial state GLISSANDO, pre-thermal dynamics of A+A\ncollisions leading to thermalization, subsequent relativistic viscous\nhydrodynamic expansion of quark-gluon and hadron medium (vHLLE), its\nparticlization, and finally hadronic cascade ultrarelativistic QMD. We\ncalculate mid-rapidity charged-particle multiplicities, pion, kaon, and\nantiproton spectra, charged-particle elliptic flows, and pion interferometry\nradii for Pb+Pb collisions at the energies available at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider, $\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV, at different centralities. We find that the\nbest description of the experimental data is reached when the initial states\nare attributed to the very small initial time 0.1 fm/c, the pre-thermal stage\n(thermalization process) lasts at least until 1 fm/c, and the shear viscosity\nat the hydrodynamic stage of the matter evolution has its minimal value,\n$\\eta/s = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}$. At the same time it is observed that the various\nmomentum anisotropies of the initial states, different initial and relaxation\ntimes, as well as even a treatment of the pre-thermal stage within just viscous\nor ideal hydrodynamic approach, leads sometimes to worse but nevertheless\nsimilar results, if the normalization of maximal initial energy density in most\ncentral events is adjusted to reproduce the final hadron multiplicity in each\nscenario. This can explain a good enough data description in numerous variants\nof hybrid models without a prethermal stage when the initial energy densities\nare defined up to a common factor.\n", "  We developed a table-top vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser with $113.778$nm\nwavelength (10.897eV) and demonstrated its viability as a photon source for\nhigh resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This\nsub-nanosecond pulsed VUV laser operates at a repetition rate of 10MHz,\nprovides a flux of 2$\\times$10$^{12}$ photons/second, and enables photoemission\nwith energy and momentum resolutions better than 2meV and 0.012\\AA$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. Space-charge induced energy shifts and spectral broadenings can\nbe reduced below 2meV. The setup reaches electron momenta up to 1.2\\AA$^{-1}$,\ngranting full access to the first Brillouin zone of most materials. Control\nover the linear polarization, repetition rate, and photon flux of the VUV\nsource facilitates ARPES investigations of a broad range of quantum materials,\nbridging the application gap between contemporary low energy laser-based ARPES\nand synchrotron-based ARPES. We describe the principles and operational\ncharacteristics of this source, and showcase its performance for rare earth\nmetal tritellurides, high temperature cuprate superconductors and iron-based\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We calculate the mean and variance of net-baryon number and net-electric\ncharge distributions from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using a next-to-leading\norder Taylor expansion in terms of temperature and chemical potentials. We\ncompare these expansions with experimental data from STAR and PHENIX, determine\nthe freeze-out temperature in the limit of vanishing baryon chemical potential,\nand, for the first time, constrain the curvature of the freeze-out line through\na direct comparison between experimental data on net-charge fluctuations and a\nQCD calculation. We obtain a bound on the curvature coefficient, kappa_2^f <\n0.011, that is compatible with lattice QCD results on the curvature of the QCD\ntransition line.\n", "  We reinvestigate the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of\nthe Tomonaga-Luttinger model. In particular, we focus on the role of the\nmomentum-dependence of the two-particle interaction V(q). Usually, V(q) is\nassumed to be a constant and integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet `by\nhand' employing an ad hoc procedure. As the momentum dependence of the\ninteraction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense this does not\naffect the universal low-energy properties of the model, e.g. exponents of\npower laws, if all energy scales are sent to zero. If, however, the momentum k\nis fixed away from the Fermi momentum k_F, with |k-k_F| setting a nonvanishing\nenergy scale, the details of V(q) start to matter. We provide strong evidence\nthat any curvature of the two-particle interaction at small transferred\nmomentum q destroys power-law scaling of the momentum resolved spectral\nfunction as a function of energy. Even for |k-k_F| much smaller than the\nmomentum space range of the interaction the spectral line shape depends on the\ndetails of V(q). The significance of our results for universality in the\nLuttinger liquid sense, for experiments on quasi one-dimensional metals, and\nfor recent attempts to compute the spectral function of one-dimensional\ncorrelated systems taking effects of the curvature of the single-particle\ndispersion into account (nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology) is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Enhanced optical absorption of molecules in the vicinity of metallic\nnanostructures is key to a number of surface-enhanced spectroscopies and of\ngreat general interest to the fields of plasmonics and nano-optics. Yet,\nexperimental access to this absorbance has long proven elusive. We here present\ndirect measurements of the intrinsic absorbance of dye-molecules adsorbed onto\nsilver nanospheres, and crucially, at sub-monolayer concentrations where\ndye--dye interactions become negligible. With a large detuning from the plasmon\nresonance, distinct shifts and broadening of the molecular resonances reveal\nthe intrinsic properties of the dye in contact with the metal colloid, in\ncontrast to the often studied strong-coupling regime where the optical\nproperties of the dye-molecules cannot be isolated. The observation of these\nshifts together with the ability to routinely measure them has broad\nimplications in the interpretation of experiments involving resonant molecules\non metallic surfaces, such as surface-enhanced spectroscopies and many aspects\nof molecular plasmonics.\n", "  We have analyzed the Magellanic Stream (MS) using the deepest and the most\nresolved H I survey of the Southern Hemisphere (the Galactic All-Sky Survey).\nThe overall Stream is structured into two filaments, suggesting two\nram-pressure tails lagging behind the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), and resembling\ntwo close, transonic, von Karman vortex streets. The past motions of the Clouds\nappear imprinted in them, implying almost parallel initial orbits, and then a\nradical change after their passage near the N(H I) peak of the MS. This is\nconsistent with a recent collision between the MCs, $200-300$ Myr ago, which\nhas stripped their gas further into small clouds, spreading them out along a\ngigantic bow shock, perpendicular to the MS. The Stream is formed by the\ninterplay between stellar feedback and the ram pressure exerted by hot gas in\nthe Milky Way (MW) halo with $\\rho_{hot}$= $10^{-4}$ $cm^{-3}$ at 50-70 kpc, a\nvalue necessary to explain the MS multiphase high-velocity clouds. The\ncorresponding hydrodynamic modeling provides the currently most accurate\nreproduction of the whole H I Stream morphology, of its velocity, and column\ndensity profiles along $L_{MS}$. The 'ram pressure plus collision' scenario\nrequires tidal dwarf galaxies, which are assumed to be the Cloud and dSph\nprogenitors, to have left imprints in the MS and the Leading Arm, respectively.\nThe simulated LMC and SMC have baryonic mass, kinematics and proper motions\nconsistent with observations. This supports a novel paradigm for the MS System,\nwhich could have its origin in material expelled toward the MW by the ancient\ngas-rich merger that formed M31.\n", "  This paper investigates a particular type of wormhole. The wormhole solutions\nstudied are obtained by sewing together two static, spherically symmetric,\ncharged black-hole metrics at their horizons. The charged wormholes are in a\nbackground Kalb-Ramond field, which is the source of the necessary tension in\nthe gravitational field. The metric-tensor elements are studied by numerically\nsolving Einstein's equations with stress-energy-tensor elements given by the\ncombination of static electric and Kalb-Ramond fields. For a certain range of\nelectric charge the tension is positive away from the wormhole throat, but the\ntension is negative near the throat, making it non-traversable. The wormholes\nare found to be quasi-stable against decay via gravitational instanton\ntunnelling.\n", "  We study the radial part of the MICZ-Kepler problem in an algebraic way by\nusing the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We obtain the energy spectrum and the\neigenfunctions of this problem from the $su(1,1)$ theory of unitary\nrepresentations and the tilting transformation to the stationary Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. We construct the physical Perelomov number coherent states for this\nproblem and compute some expectation values. Also, we obtain the time evolution\nof these coherent states.\n", "  We explore the impact of incorporating physically motivated ionisation and\nrecombination rates on the history and topology of cosmic reionisation, by\nincorporating inputs from small-volume hydrodynamic simulations into a\nsemi-numerical code, SimFast21, that evolves reionisation on large scales. We\nemploy radiative hydrodynamic simulations to parameterize the ionisation rate\nRion and recombination rate Rrec as functions of halo mass, overdensity and\nredshift. We find that Rion is super-linearly dependent on halo mass (Rion ~\nMh^1.41), in contrast to previous assumptions. We implement these scalings into\nSimFast21 to identify the ionized regions. We tune our models to be consistent\nwith recent observations of the optical depth, ionizing emissivity, and neutral\nfraction by the end of reionisation. We require an average photon escape\nfraction fesc=0.04 within ~ 0.5 cMpc cells, independent of halo mass or\nredshift, to simultaneously match these data. We present predictions for the\n21cm power spectrum, and show that it is converged with respect to simulation\nvolume. We find that introducing superlinearly mass-dependent ionisations\nincreases the duration of reionisation and boosts the small-scale 21cm power by\n~ 2-3 at intermediate phases of reionisation. Introducing inhomogeneous\nrecombinations reduces ionised bubble sizes and suppresses large-scale 21cm\npower by ~ 2-3. Moreover, gas clumping on sub-cell scales has a minimal effect\non the 21cm power, indicating that robust predictions do not depend on the\nbehaviour of kpc-scale structures. The superlinear ionisations significantly\nincrease the median halo mass scale for ionising photon output to >10^10 Mo,\ngiving greater hope for detecting most of ionising sources with next-generation\nfacilities. These results highlight the importance of more accurately treating\nionising sources and recombinations for modeling reionisation and its 21cm\nsignal.\n", "  We study the interference between two parallel-propagating Gaussian beams,\noriginated from the same source, as their transverse separation is tuned. The\ninterference pattern as a function of such separation lead us to determine the\nspatial coherence length of the original beam, in a similar way that a\nMichelson-Morley interferometer can be employed to measure the temporal\ncoherence of a transform limited pulse. Moreover, performing a Fourier\ntransform of the two-beam transverse plane, we observe an intensity modulation\nin the transverse momentum variable. This observation resembles the Alford and\nGold Effect reported in time and frequency variables so far.\n", "  The effect of pressure on the Raman spectrum of PbWO4 has been investigated\nup to 48 GPa in a diamond-anvil cell using neon as pressure-transmitting\nmedium. Changes are detected in the Raman spectrum at 6.8 GPa as a consequence\nof a structural phase transition from the tetragonal scheelite structure to the\nmonoclinic PbWO4-III structure. Two additional phase transitions are detected\nat 15.5 and 21.2 GPa to the previously unknown crystalline phases IV and V. The\nlast one remains stable up to 43.3 GPa. At 47.7 GPa all Raman modes disappear,\nwhich could be caused by a pressure-induced amorphization. All structural\nchanges are reversible, being the scheelite phase recovered at ambient\npressure. However, the two most intense modes of the PbWO4-III phase are still\npresent after full decompression, indicating that this phase coexists as a\nminority metastable phase with the scheelite phase after pressure release. The\nwavenumber of the Raman modes and their pressure dependencies are reported for\nthe four crystalline phases. The present reported results are compared with\nprevious studies.\n", "  Improvements in current instruments and the advent of next-generation\ninstruments will soon push observational 21 cm cosmology into a new era, with\nhigh significance measurements of both the power spectrum and the mean\n(\"global\") signal of the 21 cm brightness temperature. In this paper we use the\nrecently commenced Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array as a worked example to\nprovide forecasts on astrophysical and cosmological parameter constraints. In\ndoing so we improve upon previous forecasts in a number of ways. First, we\nprovide updated forecasts using the latest best-fit cosmological parameters\nfrom the Planck satellite, exploring the impact of different Planck datasets on\n21 cm experiments. We also show that despite the exquisite constraints that\nother probes have placed on cosmological parameters, the remaining\nuncertainties are still large enough to have a non-negligible impact on\nupcoming 21 cm data analyses. While this complicates high-precision constraints\non reionization models, it provides an avenue for 21 cm reionization\nmeasurements to constrain cosmology. We additionally forecast HERA's ability to\nmeasure the ionization history using a combination of power spectrum\nmeasurements and semi-analytic simulations. Finally, we consider ways in which\n21 cm global signal and power spectrum measurements can be combined, and\npropose a method by which power spectrum results can be used to train a compact\nparameterization of the global signal. This parameterization reduces the number\nof parameters needed to describe the global signal, increasing the likelihood\nof a high significance measurement.\n", "  We study the zero-frequency current noise of the interacting resonant level\nmodel for arbitrary bias voltages using a functional renormalization group\napproach. For this we extend the existing nonequilibrium scheme by deriving and\nsolving flow equations for the current-vertex functions. On-resonance\nartificial divergences of the latter found in lowest-order perturbation theory\nin the two-particle interaction are consistently removed. Away from resonance\nthey are shifted to higher orders. This allows us to gain a comprehensive\npicture of the current noise in the scaling limit. At high bias voltages, the\ncurrent noise exhibits a universal power-law decay, whose exponent is to\nleading order in the interaction identical to that of the current. The\neffective charge on resonance is analyzed in detail employing properties of the\nvertex correction. We find that it is only modified to second or higher order\nin the two-particle interaction.\n", "  We provide a detailed user guide for SMARTIES, a suite of Matlab codes for\nthe calculation of the optical properties of oblate and prolate spheroidal\nparticles, with comparable capabilities and ease-of-use as Mie theory for\nspheres. SMARTIES is a Matlab implementation of an improved T-matrix algorithm\nfor the theoretical modelling of electromagnetic scattering by particles of\nspheroidal shape. The theory behind the improvements in numerical accuracy and\nconvergence is briefly summarised, with reference to the original publications.\nInstructions of use, and a detailed description of the code structure, its\nrange of applicability, as well as guidelines for further developments by\nadvanced users are discussed in separate sections of this user guide. The code\nmay be useful to researchers seeking a fast, accurate and reliable tool to\nsimulate the near-field and far-field optical properties of elongated\nparticles, but will also appeal to other developers of light-scattering\nsoftware seeking a reliable benchmark for non-spherical particles with a\nchallenging aspect ratio and/or refractive index contrast.\n", "  Low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the heavy-fermion superconductor\nURu$_2$Si$_2$ were investigated by specific-heat $C(T, H, \\phi, \\theta)$\nmeasurements of a high-quality single crystal. The occurrence of QP excitations\ndue to the Doppler-shift effect was detected regardless of the field direction\nin $C(H)$ of the present clean sample, which is in sharp contrast to a previous\nreport. Furthermore, the polar-angle-dependent $C(\\theta)$ measured under a\nrotating magnetic field within the ac plane exhibits a shoulder-like anomaly at\n$\\theta \\sim 45$ deg and a sharp dip at $\\theta = 90$ deg ($H \\parallel a$) in\nthe moderate-field region. These features are supported by theoretical analyses\nbased on microscopic calculations assuming the gap symmetry of $k_z(k_x+ik_y)$,\nwhose gap structure is characterized by a combination of a horizontal line node\nat the equator and point nodes at the poles. The present results have settled\nthe previous controversy over the gap structure of URu$_2$Si$_2$ and have\nauthenticated its chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.\n", "  We use large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine the\ntensile yield mechanism of orthorhombic polyethylene (PE) crystals with finite\nchains spanning $10^2-10^4$ carbons in length. We find the yield stress\n$\\sigma_y$ saturates for long chains at 6.3 GPa, agreeing well with\nexperiments. We show chains do not break but always yield by slip, after\nnucleation of 1D dislocations at chain ends. Dislocations are accurately\ndescribed by a Frenkel-Kontorova model parametrized by the mechanical\nproperties of an ideal crystal. We compute a dislocation core size\n$\\xi\\approx25$\\AA\\ and determine the high and low strain rate limits of\n$\\sigma_y$. Our results suggest characterizing the 1D dislocations of polymer\ncrystals as an efficient method for numerically predicting the ultimate tensile\nstrength of aligned fibers.\n", "  The ability to initialize quantum registers in pure states lies at the core\nof many applications of quantum technologies, from sensing to quantum\ninformation processing and computation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nincreasing the polarization bias of an ensemble of two-level register spins by\nmeans of joint coherent manipulations, involving a second ensemble of ancillary\nspins and energy dissipation into an external heat bath. We formulate this spin\nrefrigeration protocol, akin to algorithmic cooling, in the general language of\nquantum feedback control, and identify the relevant thermodynamic variables\ninvolved. Our analysis is two-fold: on the one hand, we assess the optimality\nof the protocol by means of suitable figures of merit, accounting for both its\nwork cost and effectiveness; on the other hand, we characterise the nature of\ncorrelations built up between the register and the ancilla. In particular, we\nobserve that neither the amount of classical correlations nor the quantum\nentanglement seem to be key ingredients fuelling our spin refrigeration\nprotocol. We report instead that a more general indicator of quantumness beyond\nentanglement, the so-called quantum discord, is closely related to the cooling\nperformance.\n", "  In recent experiments bosonic [Atala et al., Nat. Phys. 10, 588 (2014), B. K.\nStuhl et al., Science 349, 1514 (2015)] as well as fermionic ladders [M.\nMancini et al., Science 349, 1510 (2015)] with a uniform flux were studied and\ndifferent interesting many-body states were observed. Motivated by these\nexperiments, we extend the uniform synthetic magnetic field to a periodic case\nand show that a commensurate synthetic magnetic field offers an alternative\nscheme to realize topological phases in many-body systems of ultra-cold Fermi\ngases in ladder-like optical lattices. Using the exact diagonalization, we\nnumerically determine the topological band structure, edge states, non-zero\nChern numbers, Hofstadter-like-butterfly spectrum, and a complete phase diagram\nof non-interacting fermionic ladders.\n", "  We present a method to numerically evaluate infrared-finite one- and two-loop\nintegrals within the Four-Dimensional Regularization/Renormalization approach,\nin which a small mass serves as regulator. Typical integrals exhibit a\nlogarithmic dependence on this mass, which we extract with the aid of suitable\nsubtraction terms that can easily be integrated analytically until the\nlogarithmic structure is revealed. As first physical applications to test the\nmethod, we calculate QCD corrections to the decay rates of scalar and\npseudoscalar Higgs bosons into two photons in the limit of an infinite\ntop-quark mass as well as to the $\\rho$ parameter.\n", "  We conducted an 18 month long study of the weather conditions of the\nVallecitos, a proposed site in Mexico to harbor the northern array of the\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). It is located in Sierra de San Pedro Martir\n(SPM) a few kilometers away from Observatorio Astron\\'omico Nacional. The study\nis based on data collected by the ATMOSCOPE, a multi-sensor instrument\nmeasuring the weather and sky conditions, which was commissioned and built by\nthe CTA Consortium. Additionally, we compare the weather conditions of the\noptical observatory at SPM to the Vallecitos regarding temperature, humidity,\nand wind distributions. It appears that the excellent conditions at the optical\nobservatory benefit from the presence of microclimate established in the\nVallecitos.\n", "  Strong coupling of molecules to the vacuum field of micro cavities can modify\nthe potential energy surfaces opening new photophysical and photochemical\nreaction pathways. While the influence of laser fields is usually described in\nterms of classical field, coupling to the vacuum state of a cavity has to be\ndescribed in terms of dressed photon-matter states (polaritons) which require\nquantized fields. We present a derivation of the non-adiabatic couplings for\nsingle molecules in the strong coupling regime suitable for the calculation of\nthe dressed state dynamics. The formalism allows to use quantities readily\naccessible from quantum chemistry codes like the adiabatic potential energy\nsurfaces and dipole moments to carry out wave packet simulations in the dressed\nbasis. The implications for photochemistry are demonstrated for a set of model\nsystems representing typical situations found in molecules.\n", "  In this work we study the quasilocal energy as in [11] for a constant radius\nsurface in Kerr spacetime in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We show that under\nsuitable conditions for isometric embedding, for a stationary observer the\nquasilocal energy defined in [11] for constant radius in a Kerr like spacetime\nis exactly equal to the Brown-York quasilocal energy [2]. By some careful\nestimations, we show that for a constant radius surface in the Kerr spacetime\nwhich is outside the ergosphere the embedding conditions for the previous\nresult are satisfied. We discuss extremal solutions as described in [14]. We\nprove a uniqueness result. We find all extremal solutions in the Minkowski\nspacetime. Finally, we show that near the horizon of the Kerr spacetime for the\nsmall rotation case the extremal solutions are trivial.\n", "  Predicting human mobility flows at different spatial scales is challenged by\nthe heterogeneity of individual trajectories and the multi-scale nature of\ntransportation networks. As vast amounts of digital traces of human behaviour\nbecome available, an opportunity arises to improve mobility models by\nintegrating into them proxy data on mobility collected by a variety of digital\nplatforms and location-aware services. Here we propose a hybrid model of human\nmobility that integrates a large-scale publicly available dataset from a\npopular photo-sharing system with the classical gravity model, under a stacked\nregression procedure. We validate the performance and generalizability of our\napproach using two ground-truth datasets on air travel and daily commuting in\nthe United States: using two different cross-validation schemes we show that\nthe hybrid model affords enhanced mobility prediction at both spatial scales.\n", "  An approach to testing theories describing a multiverse, that has gained\ninterest of late, involves comparing theory-generated probability distributions\nover observables with their experimentally measured values. It is likely that\nsuch distributions, were we indeed able to calculate them unambiguously, will\nassign low probabilities to any such experimental measurements. An alternative\nto thereby rejecting these theories, is to conditionalize the distributions\ninvolved by restricting attention to domains of the multiverse in which we\nmight arise. In order to elicit a crisp prediction, however, one needs to make\na further assumption about how typical we are of the chosen domains. In this\npaper, we investigate interactions between the spectra of available assumptions\nregarding both conditionalization and typicality, and draw out the effects of\nthese interactions in a concrete setting; namely, on predictions of the total\nnumber of species that contribute significantly to dark matter. In particular,\nfor each conditionalization scheme studied, we analyze how correlations between\ndensities of different dark matter species affect the prediction, and explicate\nthe effects of assumptions regarding typicality. We find that the effects of\ncorrelations can depend on the conditionalization scheme, and that in each case\natypicality can significantly change the prediction. In doing so, we\ndemonstrate the existence of overlaps in the predictions of different\n\"frameworks\" consisting of conjunctions of theory, conditionalization scheme\nand typicality assumption. This conclusion highlights the acute challenges\ninvolved in using such tests to identify a preferred framework that aims to\ndescribe our observational situation in a multiverse.\n", "  The discovery of apparent cosmological acceleration has spawned a huge number\nof dark energy and modified gravity theories. The f(R) models of gravity are\nobtained when one replaces the Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert action by\nan arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. In this work we provide expressions\nfor the equations of state (EoS) for perturbations which completely\ncharacterize the linearized perturbations in f(R) gravity, including the\nscalar, vector, and tensor modes. The EoS formalism is a powerful and elegant\nparametrization where the modification to General Relativity are treated as a\ndark-energy-fluid. The perturbed dark-energy-fluid variables such as the\nanisotropic stress or the entropy perturbation are explicitly given in terms of\nparameters of the model of interest.\n", "  We analyse the complex-valued Klein-Gordon Equation from an integrability\nperspective by the implementation of the Lie Theory of Continuous Groups, where\nthis equation is governed by power-law nonlinearity. We write the equations in\nterms of real dependent variables and examine both the two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional models. In the case of the two-dimensional model the analysis\nis extended by the determination of Noether point symmetries and conserved\nvectors via the construction of a Lagrangian.\n", "  Thermomechanical cycles with a ferroelectric working substance convert heat\nto electrical energy. As shown here, magnetoelectrically coupled\nferroelectric/ferromangtic composites (also called multiferroics) add new\nfunctionalities and allow for an efficient thermal energy harvesting at room\ntemperature by exploiting the pyroelectric effect. By virtue of the\nmagnetoelectric coupling, external electric and magnetic fields can steer the\noperation of these heat engines. Our theoretical predictions are based on a\ncombination of Landau-Khalatnikov-Tani approach (with a\nGinzburg-Landau-Devonshire potential) to simulate the ferroelectric dynamics\ncoupled to the magnetic dynamics. The latter is treated via the\nelectric-polarization-dependent Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Performing an\nadapted Olsen cycle we show that a multiferroic working substance is\npotentially much more superior to sole ferroelectrics, as far as thermal energy\nharvesting using pyroelectric effect is concerned. Our proposal holds promise\nnot only for low-energy consuming devices but also for cooling technology.\n", "  I extract new limits on the coefficient of the effective operator generated\nby tree-level graviton exchange in large extra dimensions from $pp \\rightarrow\njj$ angular distributions at LHC: $M_T > 6.8$ TeV (CMS after $2.6 fb^{-1}$ of\nintegrated luminosity) and $M_T > 8.3$ TeV (ATLAS after $3.6 fb^{-1}$). I also\ncompare such limits to the ones obtained using the full graviton amplitude, and\ndiscuss the impact of additional constrains arising from other datasets, such\nas Mono-Jet.\n", "  A survey is given on the status of 3-loop heavy flavor corrections to\ndeep-inelastic structure functions at large enough virtualities $Q^2$.\n", "  Oxygen migration in tantalum oxide, a promising next-generation storage\nmaterial, is studied using in-operando x-ray absorption spectromicroscopy and\nis used to microphysically describe accelerated evolution of conduction channel\nand device failure. The resulting ring-like patterns of oxygen concentration\nare modeled using thermophoretic forces and Fick diffusion, establishing the\ncritical role of temperature-activated oxygen migration that has been under\nquestion lately.\n", "  It is well known that the equations of motion obtained from Newtons second\nlaw of motion can be obtained from a Lagrangian via the Euler-Lagrangian\nformulation if and only if the equations of motion satisfy the Helmholtz\nconditions. In this pedagogical article we give a simple proof of the above\nstatement and show its application to simple mechanical and dissipative\nsystems.\n", "  In standard quantum mechanics, complex numbers are used to describe the\nwavefunction. Although complex numbers have proven sufficient to predict the\nresults of existing experiments, there is no apparent theoretical reason to\nchoose them over real numbers or generalizations of complex numbers, i.e.\nhyper-complex numbers. Experiments performed to date have proven that real\nnumbers are insufficient, but whether or not hyper-complex numbers are required\nremains an open question. Quantum theories based on hyper-complex numbers are\none example of a post-quantum theory, which must be put on a firm experimental\nfoundation. Here we experimentally probe hyper-complex quantum theories, by\nstudying one of their deviations from complex quantum theory: the\nnon-commutativity of phases. We do so by passing single photons through a\nSagnac interferometer containing two physically different phases, having\nrefractive indices of opposite sign. By showing that the phases commute with\nhigh precision, we place limits on a particular prediction of hyper-complex\nquantum theories.\n", "  We present Pipe3D, an analysis pipeline based on the FIT3D fitting tool,\ndevel- oped to explore the properties of the stellar populations and ionized\ngas of Integral Field Spectroscopy data. Pipe3D was created to provide with\ncoherent, simple to distribute, and comparable dataproducts, independently of\nthe origin of the data, focused on the data of the most recent IFU surveys\n(e.g., CALIFA, MaNGA, and SAMI), and the last generation IFS instruments (e.g.,\nMUSE). Along this article we describe the different steps involved in the\nanalysis of the data, illustrating them by showing the dataproducts derived for\nNGC 2916, observed by CALIFA and P-MaNGA. As a practical use of the pipeline we\npresent the complete set of dataproducts derived for the 200 datacubes that\ncomprises the V500 setup of the CALIFA Data Release 2 (DR2), making them freely\navailable through the network\n(ftp://ftp.caha.es/CALIFA/dataproducts/DR2/Pipe3D). Finally, we explore the\nhypothesis that the properties of the stellar populations and ionized gas of\ngalaxies at the effective radius are representative of the overall average\nones, finding that this is indeed the case.\n", "  We present the results of clustering analysis on the $z \\sim 2$ star-forming\ngalaxies. By combining our data with data from publicly available archives, we\ncollect $g$-, $\\zb / z$-, and $K$-band imaging data over 5.2 deg$^{2}$, which\nrepresents the largest area BzK/gzK survey. We apply colour corrections to\ntranslate our filter-set to those used in the original BzK selection for the\ngzK selection. Because of the wide survey area, we obtain a sample of 41,112\nstar-forming gzK galaxies at $z \\sim 2$ (sgzKs) down to $\\KAB < 23.0$, and\ndetermine high-quality two-point angular correlation functions (ACFs). Our ACFs\nshow an apparent excess from power-law behaviour at small angular scale\n$(\\theta \\la 0.01^{\\circ})$, which corresponds the virial radius of a dark halo\nat $z \\sim 2$ with a mass of $\\sim 10^{13} \\Msun$. We find that the correlation\nlengths are consistent with the previous estimates over all magnitude range;\nhowever, our results are evaluated with a smaller margin of error than that in\nprevious studies. The large amount of data enables us to determine ACFs\ndifferentially depending on the luminosity of the subset of the data. The mean\nhalo mass of faint sgzKs $(22.0 < K \\leq 23.0)$ was found to be $\\Mh =\n(1.32^{+0.09}_{-0.12}) \\times 10^{12} h^{-1} \\Msun$, whereas bright sgzKs\n($18.0 \\leq K \\leq 21.0)$ were found to reside in dark haloes with a mass of\n$\\Mh = (3.26^{+1.23}_{-1.02}) \\times 10^{13} h^{-1} \\Msun$.\n", "  We present the results of an halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis of\nstar-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 2$. We obtained high-quality angular\ncorrelation functions based on a large sgzK sample, which enabled us to carry\nout the HOD analysis. The mean halo mass and the HOD mass parameters are found\nto increase monotonically with increasing $K$-band magnitude, suggesting that\nmore luminous galaxies reside in more massive dark haloes. The luminosity\ndependence of the HOD mass parameters was found to be the same as in the local\nUniverse; however, the masses were larger than in the local Universe over all\nranges of magnitude. This implies that galaxies at $z \\sim 2$ tend to form in\nmore massive dark haloes than in the local Universe, a process known as\ndownsizing. By analysing the dark halo mass evolution using the extended\nPress--Schechter formalism and the number evolution of satellite galaxies in a\ndark halo, we find that faint Lyman break galaxies at $z \\sim 4$ could evolve\ninto the faintest sgzKs $(22.0 < K \\leq 23.0)$ at $z \\sim 2$ and into the\nMilky-Way-like galaxies or elliptical galaxies in the local Universe, whereas\nthe most luminous sgzKs $(18.0 \\leq K \\leq 21.0)$ could evolve into the most\nmassive systems in the local Universe. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) of\nthe sgzKs was found to be consistent with the prediction of the model, except\nthat the SHMR of the faintest sgzKs was smaller than the prediction at $z \\sim\n2$. This discrepancy may be attributed that our samples are confined to\nstar-forming galaxies.\n", "  In a recent article Giustina et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 250401 (2015)]\nreport on an advanced Bell experiment, simultaneously closing loopholes for\nlocal hidden-variable theories. The authors claim that 'local realism' has been\nrefuted, unless 'truly exotic hypotheses' are made. Here I argue that a\nparticularly wide and natural class of local hidden-variable theories survives,\nfor instance when the hidden variables describe a background field. Such\nbackground-based theories exploit the freedom-of-choice loophole, which cannot\nbe closed for this type of hidden variables. The dynamics of such models can be\nillustrated by existing systems, e.g. from fluid mechanics.\n", "  Maps of the large-scale structure of the Universe at redshifts 2-4 can be\nmade with the Lyman-alpha forest which are complementary to low redshift galaxy\nsurveys. We apply the Wiener interpolation method of Caucci et al. to construct\nthree-dimensional maps from sets of Lyman-alpha forest spectra taken from\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We mimic some current and future quasar\nredshift surveys (BOSS, eBOSS and MS-DESI) by choosing similar sightline\ndensities. We use these appropriate subsets of the Lyman-alpha absorption\nsightlines to reconstruct the full three dimensional Lyman-alpha flux field and\nperform comparisons between the true and the reconstructed fields. We study\nglobal statistical properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) maps with\nauto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis, slice plots, local peaks and\npoint by point scatter. We find that both the density field and the statistical\nproper- ties of the IGM are recovered well enough that the resulting IGM maps\ncan be meaningfully considered to represent large-scale maps of the Universe in\nagreement with Caucci et al., on larger scales and for sparser sightlines than\nhad been tested previously. Quantitatively, for sightline parameters comparable\nto current and near future surveys the correlation coefficient between true and\nreconstructed fields is r > 0.9 on scales > 30 h^-1 Mpc. The properties of the\nmaps are relatively insensitive to the precise form of the covariance matrix\nused. The final BOSS quasar Lyman-alpha forest sample will allow maps to be\nmade with a resolution of ~ 30 h^-1 Mpc over a volume of ~ 15 h^-3 Gpc^3\nbetween redshifts 1.9 and 2.3.\n", "  We study the importance of double parton scattering (DPS) in Mueller-Navelet\njets production at the LHC. We evaluate this contribution in kinematics\ncorresponding to existing and possible future measurements at the LHC, for the\ncross section and the azimuthal correlation of the jets.\n", "  This note is an expanded version of the author's contribution to the\nProceedings of the ICMP Santiago, 2015, and is based on a talk given by the\nsecond author at the same Congress. It concerns a research program devoted to\nthe characterization of the absolutely continuous spectrum of a self-adjoint\noperator H in terms of the transport properties of a suitable class of open\nquantum systems canonically associated to H.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the chemistry and kinematics of red giants\nin the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. Spectroscopy at 8500 Angstroms was\nacquired for 72 red giant stars across two fields using FORS2 at the VLT. Line\nof sight extinction was individually estimated for each target star to\naccommodate the variable reddening across NGC 6822. The mean radial velocity\nwas found to be v_helio = (52.8 +/- 2.2) km/s with dispersion rms = 24.1 km/s,\nin agreement with other studies. Ca II triplet equivalent widths were converted\ninto [Fe/H] metallicities using a V magnitude proxy for surface gravity. The\naverage metallicity was [Fe/H] = (-0.84 +/- 0.04) with dispersion rms = 0.31\ndex and interquartile range 0.48. Our assignment of individual reddening values\nmakes our analysis more sensitive to spatial variations in metallicity than\nprevious studies. We divide our sample into metal-rich and metal-poor stars;\nthe former are found to cluster towards small radii with the metal-poor stars\nmore evenly distributed across the galaxy. The velocity dispersion of the\nmetal-poor stars is higher than that of the metal-rich stars; combined with the\nage-metallicity relation this indicates that older populations have either been\ndynamically heated or were born in a less disclike distribution. The low ratio\n(v_rot/v_rms) suggests that within the inner 10', NGC 6822's stars are\ndynamically decoupled from the HI gas, possibly in a thick disc or spheroid.\n", "  In this paper we conduct numerical simulation of CdS/CIGS solar cells by use\nof the AMPS-1D software aiming to formulate the optimal design of the new\nmulti-junction tandem solar cell providing its most efficient operation. We\nstart with the numerical simulation of single-junction CdS/CIGS solar cells,\nwhich shows that its highest efficiency of 17.3% could be achieved by the\nthickness of CIGS p-layer of 200 nm. This result is in a good agreement with\nexperimental data where the highest efficiency was 17.1% with the solar cell\nthickness of 1 micron. By use of the results of the numerical simulation of the\nsingle-junction solar cells we developed the design and conducted optimization\nof the new multi-junction tandem CdS/CIGS solar cell structure. Numerical\nsimulation shows that the maximum efficiency of this solar cell is equal to\n48.3%, which could be obtained with the thickness of the CIGS p-layer of 600 nm\nat a standard illumination of AM 1.5.\n", "  Latest observational data provides evidence that the emissions from Sgr A*\noriginate from an accretion disc within ten gravitational radii of the\ndynamical centre of Milky Way. We investigate the physical processes\nresponsible for the variable observed emissions from the compact radio source\nSgr A*. We study the evolution of the variable emission region and analyse\nlight curves and time-resolved spectra of emissions originated at the surface\nof the accretion disk, close to the event horizon, near the marginally stable\norbit of a Kerr black hole.\n", "  Using a high-performance computing cluster to mosaic 4,787 pointings, we have\nimaged the 100 sq. deg. South Pole Telescope (SPT) deep-field at 2.1 GHz using\nthe Australian Telescope Compact Array to an rms of 80 $\\mu$Jy and a resolution\nof 8\". Our goal is to generate an independent sample of radio-selected galaxy\nclusters to study how the radio properties compare with cluster properties at\nother wavelengths, over a wide range of redshifts in order to construct a\ntimeline of their evolution out to $z \\sim 1.3$. A preliminary analysis of the\nsource catalogue suggests there is no spatial correlation between the clusters\nidentified in the SPT-SZ catalogue and our wide-angle tail galaxies.\n", "  Interest in the inert or noble- gas atoms in general arises because they are\nideal as test systems for various theoretical models of electron scattering and\nalso since their interaction processes serve as reference for the determination\nof instrumental responses in electron scattering experiments. The ionization\ncross section data of ground state inert gas atoms He through Xe are considered\nto be benchmark data. Our aim in this paper is to provide theoretical results\non electron scattering with Radon atoms, as it would complete the studies on\nthe entire inert gas column. That is possible with this particular column only,\nin view of the preceding literature on He through Xe . Inert gas radon is\nradioactive, and would be a difficult target for electron scattering\nexperiments. In the present calculations, the complications arising from\nradioactivity are not considered. We provide hitherto unavailable cross\nsections on atomic radon, and also provide opportunity of the comparison of\nelectron impact cross sections over all the inert gas targets.\n", "  We present recent polarimetric results of magnetically active late-type\ndwarfs. The polarization in these stars is found to be wavelength dependent,\ndecreasing towards the longer wavelength. The average values of degree of\npolarization in these active dwarfs are found to be 0.16+/-0.01, 0.080+/-0.006,\n0.056+/-0.004 and 0.042+/-0.003 per cent in B, V, R, and I bands, respectively.\nPresent results indicate that polarization in the majority of active dwarfs are\nprimarily due to sum of the polarization by magnetic intensification and\nscattering. However, supplementary sources of the polarization are also found\nto be present in some active stars. The correlations between the degree of\npolarization and various activity parameters like Rossby number, chromospheric\nactivity indicator and coronal activity indicator are found to be stronger in B\nband and weaker in I band.\n", "  Objective: The study investigates the effect on cooperation in multiplayer\ngames, when the population from which all individuals are drawn is structured -\ni.e. when a given individual is only competing with a small subset of the\nentire population.\n  Method: To optimize the focus on multiplayer effects, a class of games were\nchosen for which the payoff depends nonlinearly on the number of cooperators -\nthis ensures that the game cannot be represented as a sum of pair-wise\ninteractions, and increases the likelihood of observing behaviour different\nfrom that seen in two-player games. The chosen class of games are named\n\"threshold games\", and are defined by a threshold, $M > 0$, which describes the\nminimal number of cooperators in a given match required for all the\nparticipants to receive a benefit. The model was studied primarily through\nnumerical simulations of large populations of individuals, each with\ninteraction neighbourhoods described by various classes of networks.\n  Results: When comparing the level of cooperation in a structured population\nto the mean-field model, we find that most types of structure lead to a\ndecrease in cooperation. This is both interesting and novel, simply due to the\ngenerality and breadth of relevance of the model - it is likely that any model\nwith similar payoff structure exhibits related behaviour.\n  More importantly, we find that the details of the behaviour depends to a\nlarge extent on the size of the immediate neighbourhoods of the individuals, as\ndictated by the network structure. In effect, the players behave as if they are\npart of a much smaller, fully mixed, population, which we suggest an expression\nfor.\n", "  There is ample evidence, dating as far back as Low's theorem, that the\nuniversality of soft emissions extends beyond leading power in the soft energy.\nThis universality can, in principle, be exploited to generalise the formalism\nof threshold resummations beyond leading power in the threshold variable. In\nthe past years, several phenomenological approaches have been partially\nsuccessful in performing such a resummation. Here, we briefly review some\nrecent developments which pave the way to a solution of this problem, at least\nfor electroweak annihilation processes.\n", "  Based on the quantum technique of weak measurement, we propose a scheme to\nprotect the entanglement from correlated amplitude damping decoherence. In\ncontrast to the results of memoryless amplitude damping channel, we show that\nthe memory effects play a significant role in the suppression of entanglement\nsudden death and protection of entanglement under severe decoherence. Moreover,\nwe find that the initial entanglement could be drastically amplified by the\ncombination of weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal even under the\ncorrelated amplitude damping channel. The underlying mechanism can be\nattributed to the probabilistic nature of weak measurements.\n", "  Super Li-rich stars form a very small and enigmatic group whose existence\ncannot be explained in terms of the standard stellar evolution theory. The goal\nof our study is to check the reality of this group of cool giants based on an\nindependent technique. We have carried out such a check using the K giant HD\n77361 (HR 3597), which has previously been assigned to this rare type, as an\nexample. We have redetermined the effective temperature Teff and surface\ngravity log g for this star. We have applied two different methods, photometric\nand spectroscopic, to estimate Teff (the accuracy of the Li-abundance\ndetermination depends significantly on this parameter). The value of log g has\nbeen found from the highly accurate parallax of this nearby star. To apply the\nphotometric method of determining Teff, we have performed UBV observations of\nthe star, which yielded V = 6.18 +/- 0.03, B - V = 1.13 +/- 0.01, and U - B =\n1.18+/-0.05. The following parameters of the star have been found: effective\ntemperature Teff = 4370+/- 100 K, surface gravity log g = 2.30 +/- 0.10, iron\nabundance log e(Fe) = 7.49 +/- 0.14, microturbulence Vt = 1.1 +/- 0.2 km/s,\nrotational velocity V sin i = 4.5 km/s, and mass M = 1.3 +/- 0.2 Msun. The\nlithium abundance has been determined from a non-LTE analysis of three Li I\nlines: the resonance line at 6707.8 ?A and the subordinate lines at 6103.6 and\n8126.4 ?A (the latter in a blend with a CN molecular line). We have found a\nhigh lithium abundance, log e(Li) = 3.75 +/- 0.11, which exceeds considerably\nthe initial abundance log e(Li) = 3.2 +/- 0.1 for young stars in the solar\nneighborhood. Thus, we have confirmed that the K giant HD 77361 actually\nbelongs to the type of super Li-rich stars.\n", "  The unique and remarkable properties of graphene can be exploited as the\nbasis to a wide range of applications. However, in spite of years of\ninvestigations there are some important graphene properties that are not still\nfully understood, as for example, its wettability. There are controversial\nreported results whether graphene is really hydrophobic or hydrophilic. In\norder to address this problem we have carried out classical molecular dynamics\nsimulations of water nanodroplets shot against graphene surface. Our results\nshow that the contact angle values between the nanodroplets and graphene\nsurfaces depend on the initial droplet velocity value and these angles can\nchange from 86 degrees (hydrophobic) to 35 degrees (hydrophilic). Our\npreliminary results indicate that the graphene wettability can be dependent on\nspreading liquid dynamics and which can explain some of the apparent\ninconsistencies reported in the literature.\n", "  We study the holomorphic extension associated with power series, i.e., the\nanalytic continuation from the unit disk to the cut-plane $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus\n[1,+\\infty)$. Analogous results are obtained also in the study of trigonometric\nseries: we establish conditions on the series coefficients which are sufficient\nto guarantee the series to have a KMS analytic structure. In the case of power\nseries we show the connection between the unique (Carlsonian) interpolation of\nthe coefficients of the series and the Laplace transform of a probability\ndistribution. Finally, we outline a procedure which allows us to obtain a\nnumerical approximation of the jump function across the cut starting from a\nfinite number of power series coefficients. By using the same methodology, the\nthermal Green functions at real time can be numerically approximated from the\nknowledge of a finite number of noisy Fourier coefficients in the expansion of\nthe thermal Green functions along the imaginary axis of the complex time plane.\n", "  For imaging faint exoplanets and disks, a coronagraph-equipped observatory\nneeds focal plane wavefront correction to recover high contrast. The most\nefficient correction methods iteratively estimate the stellar electric field\nand suppress it with active optics. The estimation requires several images from\nthe science camera per iteration. To maximize the science yield, it is\ndesirable both to have fast wavefront correction and to utilize all the\ncorrection images for science target detection. Exoplanets and disks are\nincoherent with their stars, so a nonlinear estimator is required to estimate\nboth the incoherent intensity and the stellar electric field. Such techniques\nassume a high level of stability found only on space-based observatories and\npossibly ground-based telescopes with extreme adaptive optics. In this paper,\nwe implement a nonlinear estimator, the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF),\nto enable fast wavefront correction and a recursive, nearly-optimal estimate of\nthe incoherent light. In Princeton's High Contrast Imaging Laboratory we\ndemonstrate that the IEKF allows wavefront correction at least as fast as with\na Kalman filter and provides the most accurate detection of a faint companion.\nThe nonlinear IEKF formalism allows us to pursue other strategies such as\nparameter estimation to improve wavefront correction.\n", "  In this paper we present the full classification of the symmetry-invariant\nsolutions for the Gibbons--Tsarev equation. Then we use these solutions to\nconstruct explicit expressions for reductions of Benney's moments equations, to\nget solutions of Pavlov's equation, and to find integrable reductions of the\nFerapontov--Huard--Zhang system, which describes implicit two-phase solutions\nof the dKP equation.\n", "  Many-body correlations and macroscopic quantum behaviors are fascinating\ncondensed matter problems. A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and\nmethods is the Kondo model which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to\na continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems and can be\nexplored with tunable nanostructures. Although Kondo physics is usually\nassociated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic\nmagnetic moments, theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum\nstates are coupled to a continuum. Here we demonstrate the previously elusive\n`charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a\nsingle-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin-1/2 constituted by two\ndegenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island. In contrast to other\nKondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an\nelectrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel, thereby\nproviding an unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear\npath to multi-channel Kondo physics. Using a weakly coupled probe, we reveal\nthe renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels\ncompeting to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how\nthe predicted quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum\ncritical point. Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate,\non a fully characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions\nfor the finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality.\n", "  In oncology, treating cancer with a beam of photons is a well established\ntherapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer\npatients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing\nradiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering\ntheir cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to\nsignificant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout\nthe beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy\nare competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based\ntherapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of\nnon-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)\ntherapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very\ninteresting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer\nmanagement is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,\ne.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy\nand/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser\ntechnology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing\nthe cost of the needed installations. The aim of this review is to present some\nlaser-based future objectives for cancer radiation therapy, aiming to address\nthe relevant advances in the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation therapy, i.e.\nprotons and heavy ions therapy, as well as photodynamic targeted and molecular\ntherapies.\n", "  Since it has been shown that the silicon trimer has a highly multi-reference\ncharacter, accurate multi-reference configuration interaction calculations are\nperformed to elucidate its electronic manifold. Emphasis is given to the long\nrange part of the potential, aiming to understand the atom-diatom collisions\ndynamical aspects, to describe conical intersections and important saddle\npoints along the reactive path. Potential energy surface main features analysis\nare performed for benchmarking, and highly accurate values for structures,\nvibrational constants and energy gaps are reported, as well as the unpublished\nspin-orbit coupling magnitude. The results predict that inter-system crossings\nwill play an important role in dynamical simulations, specially in triplet\nstate quenching, making the problem of constructing a precise potential energy\nsurface more complicated and multi-layer dependent. The ground state is\npredicted to be the singlet one, but since the singlet-triplet gap is rather\nsmall (2.448 kJ/mol) both of them are expected to be populated at room\ntemperature.\n", "  We apply a new approach based on three relativistic groups (bradyon, tachyon\nand instanton) forming the `Lorentz groupoid' which allows, in particular, to\nconsider tachyons without introducing imaginary masses and negative energies\n(related, as known, to violation of causality and unitarity). This leads to\neffectively scalar conglomerate composed of tachyonic neutrino and antineutrino\nspinor wave functions as a viable model for stationary dark matter. We also\nbriefly discuss a relevant early non-stationary high-energy stage of the\nuniverse evolution.\n", "  Rapid, non-destructive characterization of molecular level chemistry for\norganic matter (OM) is experimentally challenging. Raman spectroscopy is one of\nthe most widely used techniques for non-destructive chemical characterization,\nalthough it currently does not provide detailed identification of molecular\ncomponents in OM, due to the combination of diffraction-limited spatial\nresolution and poor applicability of peak-fitting algorithms. Here, we develop\na genome-inspired collective molecular structure fingerprinting approach, which\nutilizes ab initio calculations and data mining techniques to extract molecular\nlevel chemistry from the Raman spectra of OM. We illustrate the power of such\nan approach by identifying representative molecular fingerprints in OM, for\nwhich the molecular chemistry is to date inaccessible using non-destructive\ncharacterization techniques. Chemical properties such as aromatic cluster size\ndistribution and H/C ratio can now be quantified directly using the identified\nmolecular fingerprints. Our approach will enable non-destructive identification\nof chemical signatures with their correlation to the preservation of\nbiosignatures in OM, accurate detection and quantification of environmental\ncontamination, as well as objective assessment of OM with respect to their\nchemical contents.\n", "  Tractography is typically performed for each subject using the diffusion\ntensor imaging (DTI) data in its native subject space rather than in some space\ncommon to the entire study cohort. Despite performing tractography on a\npopulation average in a normalized space, the latter is considered less\nfavorably at the \\emph{individual} subject level because it requires spatial\ntransformations of DTI data that involve non-linear warping and reorientation\nof the tensors. Although the commonly used reorientation strategies such as\nfinite strain and preservation of principle direction are expected to result in\nadequate accuracy for voxel based analyses of DTI measures such as fractional\nanisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), the reorientations are not always exact\nexcept in the case of rigid transformations. Small imperfections in\nreorientation at individual voxel level accumulate and could potentially affect\nthe tractography results adversely. This study aims to evaluate and compare\ndeterministic white matter fiber tracking in non-linearly warped DTI against\nthat in native DTI. The data present promising evidence that tractography in\nnon-linear warped DTI data could indeed be a viable and valid option for\nvarious statistical analysis of DTI data in a spatially normalized space.\n", "  Gauge fields associated to the Dirac matrix algebra used with the standard\nquadratic gauge field Lagrangian lead to an extended gravitational Lagrangian\nwhich includes the Einstein-Hilbert one, plus quadratic, cosmological constant\nand torsion terms. This note looks at three cases : the static central\nsymmetric field, the isotropic expanding universe, and the asymptotic field of\na rotating body, and show that, in weak gravitational fields, there is no\ncontradiction with General Relativity results.\n", "  We present a set of simulations of relativistic jets from accretion disk\ninitial setup with a new code in Fortran 90 to get numerical solutions of a\nsystem of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) partial\ndifferential equations in a fixed Black Hole (BH) spacetime which is able to\nshow substructures formations inside the jet as well as a lobe formation on the\ndisk. For this, a central scheme of finite volume method without dimensional\nsplit and no Riemann solvers (a Nessyahu-Tadmor method) was implemented. Thus,\nwe were able to obtain stable numerical solutions with spurious oscillations\nunder control and no excessive numerical dissipation. We setup a magnetized\naccretion disk uncharged plasma surrounding a central Schwarzschild BH immersed\nin a magnetosphere which evolve to the ejection of matter in the form of jet\nwith its substructures over a distance of almost twenty times the BH radius.\n", "  We treat the baryon as a composite system made out of a \"core\" of three\nquarks (as in the standard quark model) surrounded by a \"sea\" (of gluons and\n$q\\bar{q}$-pairs) which is specified by its total quantum numbers like flavor,\nspin and color. Specifically, we assume the sea to be a flavor octet with spin\n0 but no color. The general wavefunction for spin 1/2 baryons with such a sea\ncomponent is given and an application to the magnetic moments is considered.\nNumerical analysis shows that the scalar sea can provide a good fit to the\nmagnetic moment data using experimental errors.\n"]}
