While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes\nnon-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the\naction of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector\ncan be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov\nsubspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the\nevaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is\nspoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This\nis cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov\nsubspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing\nmodified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a\ndiscontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the\nimproved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective\nwhen the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many\ntimes on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted\nusing an iterative method.\n", "  We suggest a solution to the problem of some apparently excessive\ncontributions to the cosmological constant from Standard-Model condensates.\n", "  It has been shown that for each Killing-Yano (KY)-form accepted by an\n$n$-dimensional (pseudo)Riemannian manifold of arbitrary signature, two basic\ngravitational currents can be defined. Conservation of the currents are\nexplicitly proved by showing co-exactness of the one and co-closedness of the\nother. Some general geometrical facts implied by these conservation laws are\nalso elucidated. In particular, the conservation of the one-form currents\nimplies that the scalar curvature of the manifold is a flow invariant for all\nof its Killing vector fields. It also directly follows that, while all KY-forms\nand their Hodge duals on a constant curvature manifold are the eigenforms of\nthe Laplace-Beltrami operator, for an Einstein manifold this is certain only\nfor KY 1-forms, $(n-1)$-forms and their Hodge duals.\n", "  The S matrix of e--e scattering has the structure of a projection operator\nthat projects incoming separable product states onto entangled two-electron\nstates. In this projection operator the empirical value of the fine-structure\nconstant alpha acts as a normalization factor. When the structure of the\ntwo-particle state space is known, a theoretical value of the normalization\nfactor can be calculated. For an irreducible two-particle representation of the\nPoincare group, the calculated normalization factor matches Wyler's\nsemi-empirical formula for the fine-structure constant alpha. The empirical\nvalue of alpha, therefore, provides experimental evidence that the state space\nof two interacting electrons belongs to an irreducible two-particle\nrepresentation of the Poincare group.\n", "  Binary/multiple status can affect stars at all stages of their lifetimes:\nevolution onto the main sequence, properties on the main sequence, and\nsubsequent evolution. 5 $M_\\odot$ stars have provided a wealth of information\nabout the binary properties fairly massive stars. The combination of cool\nevolved primaries and hot secondaries in Cepheids (geriatric B stars) have\nyielded detailed information about the distribution of mass ratios. and have\nalso provided a surprisingly high fraction of triple systems. Ground-based\nradial velocity orbits combined with satellite data from Hubble, FUSE, IUE, and\nChandra are needed to provide full information about the systems, including the\nmasses. As a recent example, X-ray observations can identify low mass\ncompanions which are young enough to be physical companions. Typically binary\nstatus and properties (separation, eccentricity, mass ratio) determine whether\nany stage of evolution takes an exotic form.\n", "  In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has\nincreased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star mass\ndistribution in detail. We critically review radio pulsar mass measurements and\npresent a detailed examination through which we are able to put stringent\nconstraints on the underlying neutron star mass distribution. For the first\ntime, we are able to analyze a sizable population of neutron star-white dwarf\nsystems in addition to double neutron star systems with a technique that\naccounts for systematically different measurement errors. We find that neutron\nstars that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect\ndistinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff\nvalues. Neutron stars in double neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf\nsystems show consistent respective peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun which\nsuggest significant mass accretion (Delta m~0.15 Msun) has occurred during the\nspin up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double neutron\nstar systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred\nmass range is significantly wider for neutron stars that have gone through\nrecycling. We find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for neutron stars with white dwarf\ncompanions which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum neutron star\nmass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state\nmodels as viable configurations for neutron star matter. The lack of truncation\nclose to the maximum mass cutoff suggests that the 2 Msun limit is set by\nevolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and\nthe existence of rare super-massive neutron stars is possible.\n", "  In the present work, we study the cosmological model with fermionic field and\nwith the non-canonical kinetic term (f-essence). We also present some important\nreductions of the model as well as its some generalizations. We also found the\nexact solution of the model and examine the influence of such gravity-fermion\ninteraction on the observed accelerated expansion of our universe. Several\nfermionic and bosonic-fermionic DBI models were constructed as some particular\nreductions of f-essence and g-essence, respectively and their Chaplygin gas\ncounterparts are found. Finally, some nonlinear models of bouncing and cyclic\nuniverses are proposed.\n", "  We present a new method based on a Bayesian hierarchical model to extract\nconstraints on cosmological parameters from SNIa data obtained with the SALT-II\nlightcurve fitter. We demonstrate with simulated data sets that our method\ndelivers tighter statistical constraints on the cosmological parameters over\n90% of the time, that it reduces statistical bias typically by a factor ~ 2-3\nand that it has better coverage properties than the usual chi-squared approach.\nAs a further benefit, a full posterior probability distribution for the\ndispersion of the intrinsic magnitude of SNe is obtained. We apply this method\nto recent SNIa data, and by combining them with CMB and BAO data we obtain\nOmega_m=0.28 +/- 0.02, Omega_Lambda=0.73 +/- 0.01 (assuming w=-1) and\nOmega_m=0.28 +/- 0.01, w=-0.90 +/- 0.05 (assuming flatness; statistical\nuncertainties only). We constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the B-band\nmagnitude of the SNIa population, obtaining sigma_mu^int = 0.13 +/- 0.01 [mag].\nApplications to systematic uncertainties will be discussed in a forthcoming\npaper.\n", "  Multiwavelength opportunities have provided important new insights into the\nproperties of binary/multiple 5 Msun stars. The combination of cool evolved\nprimaries and hot secondaries in Cepheids (geriatric B stars) has yielded\ndetailed information about the distribution of mass ratios. It has also\nprovided a surprisingly high fraction of triple systems. Ground-based radial\nvelocity orbits combined with satellite data from Hubble, FUSE, IUE, and\nChandra can provide full information about the systems, including the masses.\nIn particular, X-ray observations can identify low mass companions which are\nyoung enough to be physical companions. These multiwavelength observations\nprovide important tests for star formation scenarios including diffenences\nbetween high and low mass results and differences between close and wide\nbinaries.\n", "  We present a nonlocal formulation of contact mechanics that accounts for the\ninterplay of deformations due to multiple contact forces acting on a single\nparticle. The analytical formulation considers the effects of nonlocal\nmesoscopic deformations characteristic of confined granular systems and,\ntherefore, removes the classical restriction of independent contacts. This is\nin sharp contrast to traditional contact mechanics theories, which are strictly\nlocal and assume that contacts are independent regardless the confinement of\nthe particles. For definiteness, we restrict attention to elastic spheres in\nthe absence of gravitational forces, adhesion or friction. Hence, a notable\nfeature of the nonlocal formulation is that, when nonlocal effects are\nneglected, it reduces to Hertz theory. Furthermore, we show that, under the\npreceding assumptions and up to moderate macroscopic deformations, the\npredictions of the nonlocal contact formulation are in remarkable agreement\nwith detailed finite-element simulations and experimental observations, and in\nlarge disagreement with Hertz theory predictions---supporting that the\nassumption of independent contacts only holds for small deformations. The\ndiscrepancy between the extended theory presented in this work and Hertz theory\nis borne out by studying periodic homogeneous systems and disordered\nheterogeneous systems.\n", "  We present a mesoscopic approach to granular crystal dynamics, which\ncomprises a three-dimensional finite-element model and a one-dimensional\nregularized contact model. The approach investigates the role of\nvibrational-energy trapping effects in the dynamic behavior of one-dimensional\nchains of particles in contact (i.e., granular crystals), under small to\nmoderate impact velocities. The only inputs of the models are the geometry and\nthe elastic material properties of the individual particles that form the\nsystem. We present detailed verification results and validate the model\ncomparing its predictions with experimental data. This approach provides a\nphysically sound, first-principle description of dissipative losses in granular\nsystems.\n", "  The Causal Dynamical Triangulation model of quantum gravity (CDT) has a\ntransfer matrix, relating spatial geometries at adjacent (discrete lattice)\ntimes. The transfer matrix uniquely determines the theory. We show that the\nmeasurements of the scale factor of the (CDT) universe are well described by an\neffective transfer matrix where the matrix elements are labeled only by the\nscale factor. Using computer simulations we determine the effective transfer\nmatrix elements and show how they relate to an effective minisuperspace action\nat all scales.\n", "  We analyze the state space of a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic sources.\nHere we consider an extended state space which includes null geodesics in this\nbackground. The evolution equations for all the state observables are derived.\nDynamical systems approach is used to study the evolution of these equations.\nThe asymptotic stable fixed points for all the evolution equations are found.\nWe also check our analytic results with numerical analysis of these dynamical\nequations. The evolution of the state observables are studied both in cosmic\ntime and using a dimensionless time variable. Then we repeat the same analysis\nwith a more realistic scenario, adding the isotropic (dust like dark) matter\nand a cosmological constant (dark energy) to our anisotropic sources, to study\ntheir co-evolution. The universe now approaches a de~Sitter space\nasymptotically dominated by the cosmological constant. The cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropy maps due to shear are also generated in this scenario,\nassuming that the universe contains anisotropic matter along with the usual\n(dark) matter and vacuum (dark) energy since decoupling. We find that they\ncontribute dominantly to the CMB quadrupole. We also constrain the current\nlevel of anisotropy and also search for any cosmic preferred axis present in\nthe data. We use the Union~2 Supernovae data to this extent. An anisotropy axis\nclose to the mirror symmetry axis seen in the cosmic microwave background data\nfrom Planck probe is found.\n", "  The model of quantum associative memories (QAM) we propose here consists in\nsimplifying and generalizing that of Rigui Zhou \\etal \\cite{zhou2012} who uses\nthe quantum matrix with binary decision diagram and nonlinear search algorithm\nin his model. It is worth noting that David Rosenbaum put forth the quantum\nmatrix with binary decision diagram \\cite{Rosenbaum2010} and Abrams and Llyod\ndid the nonlinear algorithm. \\cite{Abrams1998} Our model gives the possibility\nto retrieve one of the sought states in multi-values retrieving scheme when a\nmeasure on the first register is done. It is better than Grover's algorithm and\nits modified form which need $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{2^n} {m}})$ steps when\nthey are used as the retrieval algorithm. $n$ is the number of qubit of the\nfirst register and $m$ the number of values $x$ for which $f(x)=1$. As the\nnonlinearity makes the system highly susceptible to noise, an analysis of the\ninfluence of the single qubit noise channels on the Nonlinear Search Algorithm\nof our model of QAM, shows a fidelity of about $0.7$ whatever the number of\nqubits present in the first register.\n", "  In this paper we illustrate the potential role which relative limit cycles\nmay play in biolocomotion. We do this by describing, in great detail, an\nelementary example of reduction of a lightly dissipative system modeling\ncrawling-type locomotion in 3D. The symmetry group SE(2) is the set of rigid\ntransformations of the horizontal (ground) plane. Given a time-periodic\nperturbation, the system will admit a relative limit cycle whereupon each\nperiod is related to the previous by a fixed translation and rotation along the\nground. This toy model identifies how symmetry reduction and dissipation can\nconspire to create robust behavior in crawling, and possibly walking,\nlocomotion.\n", "  We analyze the angular distributions of B -> K^* (-> K pi) l^+ l^- and B -> K\nl^+ l^- decays in the region of low hadronic recoil in a model-independent way\nby taking into account the complete set of dimension-six operators [sbar Gamma\nb][lbar Gamma' l]. We obtain several novel low-recoil observables with high\nsensitivity to non-standard-model Dirac structures, including CP-asymmetries\nwhich do not require flavor tagging. The transversity observables H_T^(1,3,4,5)\nare found to be insensitive to hadronic matrix elements and their uncertainties\neven when considering the complete set of operators. In the most general\nscenario we show that the low recoil operator product expansion can be probed\nat the few-percent level using the angular observable J_7. Higher sensitivities\nare possible assuming no tensor contributions, specifically by testing the\nlow-recoil relation |H_T^(1)|=1. We explicitly demonstrate the gain in reach of\nthe low-recoil observables in accessing the ratio |C_9/C_10| compared to the\nforward-backward asymmetry, and probing CP-violating right-handed currents Im\nC_10'. We give updated Standard Model predictions for key observables in B ->\nK^(*) l^+ l^- decays.\n", "  We try to design a simple model exhibiting self-organized criticality, which\nis amenable to a rigorous mathematical analysis. To this end, we modify the\ngeneralized Ising Curie-Weiss model by implementing an automatic control of the\ninverse temperature. For a class of symmetric distributions whose density\nsatisfies some integrability conditions, we prove that the sum $S_n$ of the\nrandom variables behaves as in the typical critical generalized Ising\nCurie-Weiss model. The fluctuations are of order $n^{3/4}$, and the limiting\nlaw is $C\\exp(-\\lambda x^4)\\,dx$ where $C$ and $\\lambda$ are suitable positive\nconstants.\n", "  We study the dynamics of two conservatively coupled H\\'enon maps at different\nlevels of dissipation. It is shown that the decrease of dissipation leads to\nchanges in the parameter plane structure and scenarios of transition to chaos\ncomparing with the case of infinitely strong dissipation. Particularly, the\nFeigenbaum line becomes divided into several fragments. Some of these fragments\nhave critical points of different types, namely of C and H type, as their\nterminal points. Also the mechanisms of formation of these Feigenbaum line\nruptures are described.\n", "  Motivated by the transmission of topological surface states through atomic\nscale steps, we study the transport of gapless Dirac fermions on hyperbolic\nsurfaces. We confirm that, independent of the curvature of the hyperbolae and\nthe sharpness of the corners, no backward scattering takes place and\ntransmission of the topological surface states is completely independent of the\ngeometrical shape (within the hyperbolic model) of the surface. The density of\nstates of the electrons, however, shows a dip at concave step edges which can\nbe measured by an STM tip. We also show that the tunneling conductance measured\nby a polarized scanning tunneling probe exhibits an unconventional dependence\non the polar and azimuthal angles of the magnetization of the tip as a function\nof the curvature of the surface and the sharpness of the edge.\n", "  We derive general conditions for the emergence of singlet Feshbach molecules\nin the presence of artificial Zeeman fields for arbritary mixtures of Rashba\nand Dresselhaus spin-orbit orbit coupling in two or three dimensions. We focus\non the formation of two-particle bound states resulting from interactions\nbetween ultra-cold spin-1/2 fermions, under the assumption that interactions\nare short-ranged and occur only in the s-wave channel. In this case, we\ncalculate explicitly binding energies of Feshbach molecules and analyze their\ndependence on spin-orbit couplings, Zeeman fields, interactions and center of\nmass momentum, paying particular attention to the experimentally relevant case\nof spin-orbit couplings with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus (ERD) amplitudes.\n", "  Optical frequency combs enable coherent data transmission on hundreds of\nwavelength channels and have the potential to revolutionize terabit\ncommunications. Generation of Kerr combs in nonlinear integrated microcavities\nrepresents a particularly promising option enabling line spacings of tens of\nGHz, compliant with wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) grids. However, Kerr\ncombs may exhibit strong phase noise and multiplet spectral lines, and this has\nmade high-speed data transmission impossible up to now. Recent work has shown\nthat systematic adjustment of pump conditions enables low phase-noise Kerr\ncombs with singlet spectral lines. Here we demonstrate that Kerr combs are\nsuited for coherent data transmission with advanced modulation formats that\npose stringent requirements on the spectral purity of the optical source. In a\nfirst experiment, we encode a data stream of 392 Gbit/s on subsequent lines of\na Kerr comb using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 16-state quadrature\namplitude modulation (16QAM). A second experiment shows feedback-stabilization\nof a Kerr comb and transmission of a 1.44 Tbit/s data stream over a distance of\nup to 300 km. The results demonstrate that Kerr combs can meet the highly\ndemanding requirements of multi-terabit/s coherent communications and thus\noffer a solution towards chip-scale terabit/s transceivers.\n", "  These notes aim at providing a pedagogical and pedestrian introduction to the\nsubject and assume no previous knowledge apart from that of general relativity.\nWe shall first recall the \"frame\" formulation of the later theory, then\nparticularize it to three dimensions, and will end those preliminaries by\nreviewing the formulation of three-dimensional gravity as a gauge theory\ngoverned by a Chern-Simons action. An analogous path is then followed for\nhigher-spin fields at the free level. Once the equivalent Chern-Simons action\nis established thereof, it is then explained how one can formulate\nthree-dimensional higher-spin theories at the non-linear level by considering\nhigher-spin Lie algebras. We then move on to commenting on what has already\nbeen done in the context of these theories and what interesting areas of\nresearch are currently under investigation.\n", "  We study the evolution of the renormalized volume functional for\nasymptotically Poincare-Einstein metrics (M,g) which are evolving by normalized\nRicci flow. In particular, we prove that the time derivative of the\nrenormalized volume along the flow is the negative integral of scal(g(t)) +\nn(n-1) over the manifold. This implies that if scal(g(0))+n(n-1) is\nnon-negative at t=0, then the renormalized volume decreases monotonically.\n  We also discuss how, when n=4, our results describe the Hawking-Page phase\ntransition. Differences in renormalized volumes give rigorous meaning to the\nHawking-Page difference of actions and describe the free energy liberated in\nthe transition.\n", "  Atmospheric neutrinos are produced during cascades initiated by the\ninteraction of primary cosmic rays with air nuclei. In this paper, a\nmeasurement of the atmospheric \\nu_\\mu + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu energy spectrum in the\nenergy range 0.1 - 200 TeV is presented, using data collected by the ANTARES\nunderwater neutrino telescope from 2008 to 2011. Overall, the measured flux is\n~25% higher than predicted by the conventional neutrino flux, and compatible\nwith the measurements reported in ice. The flux is compatible with a single\npower-law dependence with spectral index \\gamma_{meas}=3.58\\pm 0.12. With the\npresent statistics the contribution of prompt neutrinos cannot be established.\n", "  In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has\nincreased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star (NS)\nmass distribution in detail. We critically review the radio pulsar mass\nmeasurements. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population\nof NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a\nskewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that\nNSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive\nsignatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in\ndouble neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent\nrespective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass\naccretion (delta m~0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width\nof the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight\ninitial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for\nNSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 Msun for\nNSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the\nmaximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation\nof state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation\nclose to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred\nmass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by\nevolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and\nthe existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible.\n", "  Fast-spinning newborn pulsars are intriguing candidate sources of ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The acceleration of particles with a given\ncomposition in a fraction of the extragalactic pulsar population can give a\nconsistent explanation for the measurements of the Auger Observatory. We\ncalculate the associated diffuse neutrino flux produced while particles cross\nthe supernova ejecta surrounding the stars. We show that in the minimal pulsar\nscenario that are compatible with the UHECR data, the effective optical depth\nto hadronuclear interactions is larger than unity at ultrahigh energies. Thus,\neven in the most pessimistic case, one expects energy fluxes of $\\sim 0.1 - 1\n\\,\\rm EeV$ neutrinos that should be detectable with IceCube or Askaryan Radio\nArray within a decade.\n", "  The effect of nuclear deformation on the isoscalar toroidal and compression\ndipole modes in prolate $^{170}$Yb is studied in the framework of the\nrandom-phase-approximation method with a representative set of Skyrme forces\n(SV-bas, SLy6, SkM$^*$ and SkI3). It is shown that the deformation crucially\nredistributes the strength of both modes. The compression mode has the same\nsequence of $\\mu$=0 and 1 branches as the isovector giant dipole resonance\nwhere for prolate nuclei the $\\mu=0$ mode is lower in energy ($\\mu$ being the\nprojection of the axial momentum of the mode). Instead, the toroidal mode\nexhibits an anomalous (opposite) sequence where the $\\mu$=1 branch precedes the\n$\\mu$=0 one.\n", "  We study a smooth analogue of jumping curves of a holomorphic vector bundle,\nand use Yang-Mills theory over $ S ^{2} $ to show that any non-trivial, smooth\nHermitian vector bundle $E $ over a smooth simply connected manifold, must have\nsuch curves. This is used to give new examples complex manifolds for which a\nnon-trivial holomorphic vector bundle must have jumping curves in the classical\nsense, (when $c_1 (E)$ is zero). We also use this to give a new proof a theorem\nof Gromov on the norm of curvature of unitary connections, and make the theorem\nslightly sharper. Lastly we define a sequence of new non-trivial integer\ninvariants of smooth manifolds, connected to this theory of smooth jumping\ncurves, and make some computations of these invariants. Our methods include an\napplication of the recently developed Morse-Bott chain complex for the\nYang-Mills functional over $S ^{2} $.\n", "  Anti-self-dual (ASD) 4-dimensional complex Einstein spaces with nonzero\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ equipped with a nonnul Killing vector are\nconsidered. It is shown, that any conformally nonflat metric of such spaces can\nbe always brought to a special form and the Einstein field equations can be\nreduced to the Boyer-Finley-Pleba\\'nski equation (Toda field equation). Some\nalternative form of the metric are discussed. All possible real slices\n(neutral, Euclidean and Lorentzian) of ASD complex spaces admitting a nonnull\nKilling vector are found.\n", "  Two basic concepts of nuclear vorticity, hydrodynamical (HD) and\nRawenthall-Wambach (RW), are critically inspected. As a test case, we consider\nthe interplay of irrotational and vortical motion in isoscalar electric dipole\nE1(T=0) modes in $^{208}$Pb, namely the toroidal and compression modes. The\nmodes are described in a self-consistent random-phase-approximation (RPA) with\nthe Skyrme force SLy6. They are examined in terms of strength functions,\ntransition densities, current fields, and formfactors. It is shown that the RW\nconception (suggesting the upper component of the nuclear current as the\nvorticity indicator) is not robust. The HD vorticity is not easily applicable\neither because the definition of a velocity field is too involved in nuclear\nsystems. Instead, the vorticity is better characterized by the toroidal\nstrength which closely corresponds to HD treatment and is approximately\ndecoupled from the continuity equation.\n", "  We study the single site lattice gauge theory of SU(N) coupled to one Dirac\nflavor of fermion in the adjoint representation. We utilize M\\\"obius fermions\nfor this study, and accelerate the calculation with graphics processing units\n(GPUs). Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that for sufficiently large\ninverse 't Hooft coupling b = 1/g^2 N, and for N \\leq 10 the distribution of\ntraced Polyakov loops has \"fingers\" that extend from the origin. However, in\nthe massless case the distribution of eigenvalues of the untraced Polyakov loop\nbecomes uniform at large N, indicating preservation of center symmetry in the\nthermodynamic limit. By contrast, for a large mass and large b, the\ndistribution is highly nonuniform in the same limit, indicating spontaneous\ncenter symmetry breaking. These conclusions are confirmed by comparing to the\nquenched case, as well as by examining another observable based on the average\nvalue of the modulus of the traced Polyakov loop. The result of this\ninvestigation is that with massless adjoint fermions center symmetry is\nstabilized and the Eguchi-Kawai reduction should be successful; this is in\nagreement with most other studies.\n", "  We present a tally of Milky Way late-type dwarf stars in 68 WFC3\npure-parallel fields (227 arcmin^2) from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies\n(BoRG) survey for high-redshift galaxies. Using spectroscopically identified\nM-dwarfs in two public surveys, the CANDELS and the ERS mosaics, we identify a\nmorphological selection criterion using the half-light radius (r50), a\nnear-infrared J-H, G-J color region where M-dwarfs are found, and a V-J\nrelation with M-dwarf subtype. We apply this morphological selection of stellar\nobjects, color-color selection of M-dwarfs and optical-near-infrared color\nsubtyping to compile a catalog of 274 M-dwarfs belonging to the disk of the\nMilky Way with a limiting magnitude of m_F125W < 24.\n  Based on the M-dwarfs statistics, we conclude that (a) the previously\nidentified North/South discrepancy in M-dwarf numbers persists in our sample;\nthere are more M-dwarfs in the Northern fields on average than in Southern\nones, (b) the Milky Way's single disk scale-height for M-dwarfs is 0.3-4 kpc,\ndepending on sub-type, (c) {\\bf ERRATUM:} we present corrected coordinates\n(AstroPy) and distances and find a constant $z_0$=600 pc for all types. (d) a\nsecond component is visible in the vertical distribution, with a different,\nmuch higher scale-height. We report the M-dwarf component of the Sagittarius\nstream in one of our fields with 11 confirmed M-dwarfs, 7 of which are at the\nstream's distance.\n  The dwarf scale-height and the relative low incidence in our fields of L- and\nT-dwarfs in these fields makes it unlikely that these stars will be interlopers\nin great numbers in color-selected samples of high-redshift galaxies. The\nrelative ubiquity of M-dwarfs however will make them ideal tracers of Galactic\nHalo substructure with EUCLID and reference stars for JWST observations.\n", "  We study asymptotic behavior for determinants of $n\\times n$ Toeplitz\nmatrices corresponding to symbols with two Fisher-Hartwig singularities at the\ndistance $2t\\ge0$ from each other on the unit circle. We obtain large $n$\nasymptotics which are uniform for $0<t<t_0$ where $t_0$ is fixed. They describe\nthe transition as $t\\to 0$ between the asymptotic regimes of 2 singularities\nand 1 singularity. The asymptotics involve a particular solution to the\nPainlev\\'e V equation. We obtain small and large argument expansions of this\nsolution. As applications of our results we prove a conjecture of Dyson on the\nlargest occupation number in the ground state of a one-dimensional Bose gas,\nand a conjecture of Fyodorov and Keating on the second moment of powers of the\ncharacteristic polynomials of random matrices.\n", "  Rod-like bacteria maintain their cylindrical shapes with remarkable precision\nduring growth. However, they are also capable to adapt their shapes to external\nforces and constraints, for example by growing into narrow or curved\nconfinements. Despite being one of the simplest morphologies, we are still far\nfrom a full understanding of how shape is robustly regulated, and how bacteria\nobtain their near-perfect cylindrical shapes with excellent precision. However,\nrecent experimental and theoretical findings suggest that cell-wall geometry\nand mechanical stress play important roles in regulating cell shape in rod-like\nbacteria. We review our current understanding of the cell wall architecture and\nthe growth dynamics, and discuss possible candidates for regulatory cues of\nshape regulation in the absence or presence of external constraints. Finally,\nwe suggest further future experimental and theoretical directions, which may\nhelp to shed light on this fundamental problem.\n", "  We investigate the issue of how accurately we can constrain the lepton number\nasymmetry xi_nu = mu_nu/T_nu in the Universe by using future observations of 21\ncm line fluctuations and cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that\ncombinations of the 21 cm line and the CMB observations can constrain the\nlepton asymmetry better than big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Additionally, we\nalso discuss constraints on xi_nu in the presence of some extra radiation, and\nshow that the 21 cm line observations can substantially improve the constraints\nobtained by CMB alone, and allow us to distinguish the effects of the lepton\nasymmetry from the ones of extra radiation.\n", "  It has been known for almost three decades that many $\\mathrm{NP}$-hard\noptimization problems can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to\nstructures of constant treewidth. In this work we provide the first extension\nof such results to the quantum setting. We show that given a quantum circuit\n$C$ with $n$ uninitialized inputs, $\\mathit{poly}(n)$ gates, and treewidth $t$,\none can compute in time $(\\frac{n}{\\delta})^{\\exp(O(t))}$ a classical\nassignment $y\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ that maximizes the acceptance probability of $C$ up\nto a $\\delta$ additive factor. In particular, our algorithm runs in polynomial\ntime if $t$ is constant and $1/poly(n) < \\delta < 1$. For unrestricted values\nof $t$, this problem is known to be complete for the complexity class\n$\\mathrm{QCMA}$, a quantum generalization of MA. In contrast, we show that the\nsame problem is $\\mathrm{NP}$-complete if $t=O(\\log n)$ even when $\\delta$ is\nconstant.\n  On the other hand, we show that given a $n$-input quantum circuit $C$ of\ntreewidth $t=O(\\log n)$, and a constant $\\delta<1/2$, it is\n$\\mathrm{QMA}$-complete to determine whether there exists a quantum state\n$\\mid\\!\\varphi\\rangle \\in (\\mathbb{C}^d)^{\\otimes n}$ such that the acceptance\nprobability of $C\\mid\\!\\varphi\\rangle$ is greater than $1-\\delta$, or whether\nfor every such state $\\mid\\!\\varphi\\rangle$, the acceptance probability of\n$C\\mid\\!\\varphi\\rangle$ is less than $\\delta$. As a consequence, under the\nwidely believed assumption that $\\mathrm{QMA} \\neq \\mathrm{NP}$, we have that\nquantum witnesses are strictly more powerful than classical witnesses with\nrespect to Merlin-Arthur protocols in which the verifier is a quantum circuit\nof logarithmic treewidth.\n", "  We study the problem of a random Gaussian vector field given that a\nparticular real quadratic form $\\mathcal{Q}$ is arbitrarily large. We prove\nthat in such a case the Gaussian field is primarily governed by the fundamental\neigenmode of a particular operator. As a good check of our proposition we use\nit to re-derive the result of Adler dealing with the structure of field in the\nvicinity of a high local maxima. We have also applied our result to an\nincompressible homogeneous Gaussian random flow in the limit of large local\nhelicity and calculate the structure of the flow.\n", "  We present THz range optical conductivity data of a thin film of the near\nquantum critical heavy fermion compound CeFe$_2$Ge$_2$. Our complex\nconductivity measurements find a deviation from conventional Drude-like\ntransport in a temperature range previously reported to exhibit unconventional\nbehavior. We calculate the frequency dependent effective mass and scattering\nrate using an extended Drude model analysis. We find the inelastic scattering\nrate can be described by a temperature dependent power-law $\\omega^{n(T)}$\nwhere $n(T)$ approaches $\\sim1.0 \\pm 0.2$ at 1.5 K. This is compared to the\n$\\rho \\sim T^{1.5}$ behavior claimed in dc resistivity data and the $\\rho \\sim\nT^{2}$ expected from Fermi-liquid theory. In addition to a low temperature mass\nrenormalization, we find an anomalous mass renormalization that persists to\nhigh temperature. We attribute this to a Hund's coupling in the Fe states in a\nmanner similar to that recently proposed in the ferro-pnictides. CeFe$_2$Ge$_2$\nappears to be a very interesting system where one may study the interplay\nbetween the usual $4f$ lattice Kondo effect and this Hund's enhanced Kondo\neffect in the $3d$ states.\n", "  We present our study on the emergent states of two interacting nonlinear\nsystems with differing dynamical time scales. We find that the inability of the\ninteracting systems to fall in step leads to difference in phase as well as\nchange in amplitude. If the mismatch is small, the systems settle to a\nfrequency synchronized state with constant phase difference. But as mismatch in\ntime scale increases, the systems have to compromise to a state of no\noscillations. We illustrate this for standard nonlinear systems and identify\nthe regions of quenched dynamics in the parameter plane. The transition curves\nto this state are studied analytically and confirmed by direct numerical\nsimulations. As an important special case, we revisit the well-known model of\ncoupled ocean atmosphere system used in climate studies for the interactive\ndynamics of a fast oscillating atmosphere and slowly changing ocean. Our study\nin this context indicates occurrence of multi stable periodic states and steady\nstates of convection coexisting in the system, with a complex basin structure.\n", "  It has been proposed recently that interacting Symmetry Protected Topological\n(SPT) phases can be classified using cobordism theory. We test this proposal in\nthe case of fermionic SPT phases with Z/2 symmetry, where Z/2 is either\ntime-reversal or an internal symmetry. We find that cobordism classification\ncorrectly describes all known fermionic SPT phases in space dimension less than\nor equal to 3 and also predicts that all such phases can be realized by free\nfermions. In higher dimensions we predict the existence of inherently\ninteracting fermionic SPT phases.\n", "  In superconductors the zero-resistance current-flow is protected from\ndissipation at finite temperatures (T) by virtue of the short-circuit condition\nmaintained by the electrons that remain in the condensed state. The recently\nsuggested finite-T insulator and the \"superinsulating\" phase are different\nbecause any residual mechanism of conduction will eventually become dominant as\nthe finite-T insulator sets-in. If the residual conduction is small it may be\npossible to observe the transition to these intriguing states. We show that the\nconductivity of the high magnetic-field insulator terminating superconductivity\nin amorphous indium-oxide exhibits an abrupt drop, and seem to approach a zero\nconductance at T<0.04 K. We discuss our results in the light of theories that\nlead to a finite-T insulator.\n", "  Entanglement spectrum of finite-size correlated electron systems are\ninvestigated using the Gutzwiller projection technique. The product of largest\neigenvalue and rank of the block reduced density matrix, which is a measure of\ndistance of the state from the maximally entangled state of the corresponding\nrank, is seen to characterise the insulator to metal crossover in the state.\nThe fraction of distinct eigenvalues exhibits a `chaotic' behaviour in the\ncrossover region, and it shows a `integrable' behaviour at both insulating and\nmetallic ends. The integrated entanglement spectrum obeys conformal field\ntheory (CFT) prediction at the metal and insulator ends, but shows a noticeable\ndeviation from CFT prediction in the crossover regime, thus it can also track a\nmetal-insulator crossover. A modification of the CFT result for the\nentanglement spectrum for finite size is proposed which holds in the crossover\nregime also. The adjacent level spacing distribution of unfolded non-zero\neigenvalues for intermediate values of Gutzwiller projection parameter $g$ is\nthe same as that of an ensemble of random matrices obtained by replacing each\nblock of reduced density matrix by a random real symmetric Toeplitz matrix. It\nis strongly peaked at zero, with an exponential tail proportional to\n$e^{-(n/R)s}$, where $s$ is the adjacent level spacing, $n$ is number of\ndistinct eigenvalues and $R$ is the rank of the reduced density matrix.\n", "  The conventional explanation of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering attributes\nthe enhancement to the antenna effect focusing the electromagnetic field into\nsub-wavelength volumes. Here we introduce a new model that additionally\naccounts for the dynamical and coherent nature of the plasmon-molecule\ninteraction and thereby reveals an enhancement mechanism not contemplated\nbefore: dynamical backaction amplification of molecular vibrations. We first\nmap the problem onto the canonical model of cavity optomechanics, in which the\nmolecular vibration and the plasmon are \\textit{parametrically coupled}. The\noptomechanical coupling rate, from which we derive the Raman cross section, is\ncomputed from the molecules Raman activities and the plasmonic field\ndistribution. When the plasmon decay rate is comparable or smaller than the\nvibrational frequency and the excitation laser is blue-detuned from the plasmon\nonto the vibrational sideband, the resulting delayed feedback force can lead to\nefficient parametric amplification of molecular vibrations. The optomechanical\ntheory provides a quantitative framework for the calculation of enhanced\ncross-sections, recovers known results, and enables the design of novel systems\nthat leverage dynamical backaction to achieve additional, mode-selective\nenhancement. It yields a new understanding of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering\nand opens a route to molecular quantum optomechanics.\n", "  Deterministic control over the periodic geometrical arrangement of the\nconstituent atoms is the backbone of the material properties, that along with\nthe interactions define the electronic and magnetic ground state. Following\nthis notion, a bilayer of a prototypical rare-earth nickelate, NdNiO$_3$,\ncombined with a dielectric spacer, LaAlO$_3$, has been layered along the pseudo\ncubic [111] direction. The resulting artificial graphene-like Mott crystal with\nmagnetic 3$d$ electrons has antiferromagnetic correlations. In addition, a\ncombination of resonant X-ray linear dichroism measurements and\n\\textit{ab-initio} calculations reveal the presence of an ordered orbital\npattern, which is unattainable in either bulk nickelates or nickelate based\nheterostructures grown along the [001] direction. These findings highlight\nanother promising venue towards designing new quantum many-body states by\nvirtue of geometrical engineering.\n", "  The isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) in Samarium isotopes (from\nspherical $^{144}$Sm to deformed $^{148-154}$Sm) is investigated within the\nSkyrme random-phase-approximation (RPA) for a variety of Skyrme forces. The\nexact RPA and its separable version (SRPA) are used for spherical and deformed\nnuclei, respectively. The quadrupole deformation is shown to yield two effects:\nthe GMR broadens and attains a two-peak structure due to the coupling with the\nquadrupole giant resonance.\n", "  We model the elasticity of the cerebral cortex as a layered material with\nbending energy along the layers and elastic energy between them in both planar\nand polar geometries. The cortex is also subjected to axons pulling from the\nunderlying white matter. Above a critical threshold force, a \"flat\" cortex\nconfiguration becomes unstable and periodic unduluations emerge, i.e. a\nbuckling instability occurs. These undulations may indeed initiate folds in the\ncortex. We identify analytically the critical force and the critical wavelength\nof the undulations. Both quantities are physiologically relevant values. Our\nmodel is a revised version of the axonal tension model for cortex folding, with\nour version taking into account the layered structure of the cortex. Moreover,\nour model draws a connection with another competing model for cortex folding,\nnamely the differential growth-induced buckling model. For the polar geometry,\nwe study the relationship between brain size and the critical force and\nwavelength to understand why small mice brains exhibit no folds, while larger\nhuman brains do, for example. Finally, an estimate of the bending rigidity\nconstant for the cortex can be made based on the critical wavelength.\n", "  An infinite number of physically nontrivial symmetries are found for abelian\ngauge theories with massless charged particles. They are generated by large\n$U(1)$ gauge transformations that asymptotically approach an arbitrary function\n$\\varepsilon(z,\\bar{z})$ on the conformal sphere at future null infinity\n($\\mathscr I^+$) but are independent of the retarded time. The value of\n$\\varepsilon$ at past null infinity ($\\mathscr I^-$) is determined from that on\n$\\mathscr I^+$ by the condition that it take the same value at either end of\nany light ray crossing Minkowski space. The $\\varepsilon\\neq$ constant\nsymmetries are spontaneously broken in the usual vacuum. The associated\nGoldstone modes are zero-momentum photons and comprise a $U(1)$ boson living on\nthe conformal sphere. The Ward identity associated with this asymptotic\nsymmetry is shown to be the abelian soft photon theorem.\n", "  The tomographic reconstruction of the state of a quantum-mechanical system is\nan essential component in the development of quantum technologies. We present\nan overview of different tomographic methods for determining the\nquantum-mechanical density matrix of a single qubit: (scaled) direct inversion,\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE), minimum Fisher information distance, and\nBayesian mean estimation (BME). We discuss the different prior densities in the\nspace of density matrices, on which both MLE and BME depend, as well as ways of\nincluding experimental errors and of estimating tomography errors. As a measure\nof the accuracy of these methods we average the trace distance between a given\ndensity matrix and the tomographic density matrices it can give rise to through\nexperimental measurements. We find that the BME provides the most accurate\nestimate of the density matrix, and suggest using either the pure-state prior,\nif the system is known to be in a rather pure state, or the Bures prior if any\nstate is possible. The MLE is found to be slightly less accurate. We comment on\nthe extrapolation of these results to larger systems.\n", "  Phase field equations describe the novel approach to the Stefan problems. We\ncalculate these equations numerically performed in two-dimensions. We take full\nadvantage of the phase field parameter $\\varphi$ to track the interface on\nwhich complicated movements or changes are needed. More precisely, we analyze\nthe dissolution and/or precipitation without the unknown velocity functions\nlike the Navier-Stokes equations numerically.\n", "  A common biquadratic potential for the Higgs field $h$ and an additional\nscalar field $\\phi$, non minimally coupled to gravity, is considered in locally\nscale symmetric approaches to standard model fields in curved spacetime. A\ncommon ground state of the two scalar fields exists and couples both fields to\ngravity, more precisely to scalar curvature $R$. In Einstein gauge ($\\phi =\nconst$, often called \"Einstein frame\"), also $R$ is scaled to a constant. This\ncondition makes perfect sense, even in the general case, in the Weyl geometric\napproach. There it has been called {\\em Weyl gauge}, because it was first\nconsidered by Weyl in the different context of his original scale geometric\ntheory of gravity of 1918. Now it seems to get new meaning as a combined effect\nof electroweak theory and gravity, and their common influence on atomic\nfrequencies.\n", "  We introduce superconducting proximity effects in Weyl semi-metals (WSM) with\nbroken time reversal symmetry by tunnel coupling one of its surfaces to an\ns-wave superconductor using the Green's function approach. We find that the\nband structure develops coherence peaks, but despite the presence of metallic\nstates in the bulk, the coherence peaks do not extend far into the bulk and\nremain confined to a few layers close to the interface, similar to the\nproximity effect in the topological insulators (TI) which are gapped in the\nbulk. The Weyl nodes remain unaffected, and in that sense, no true gap\ndevelops. We also study the various induced p and s-wave pairing amplitudes\nclassified by their symmetries, as a function of the various relevant\nparameters of the theory and note the exponential decay of the induced pairings\nin the bulk both in the TI and the WSM, even at finite chemical potential.\n", "  We propose a general framework for determining optimal relationships for\ntensile strength of doubly convex tablets under diametrical compression. This\napproach is based on the observation that tensile strength is directly\nproportional to the breaking force and inversely proportional to a non-linear\nfunction of geometric parameters and materials properties. This generalization\nreduces to the analytical expression commonly used for flat faced tablets,\ni.e., Hertz solution, and to the empirical relationship currently used in the\npharmaceutical industry for convex-faced tablets, i.e., Pitt's equation. Under\nproper parametrization, optimal tensile strength relationship can be determined\nfrom experimental results by minimizing a figure of merit of choice. This\noptimization is performed under the first-order approximation that a flat faced\ntablet and a doubly curved tablet have the same tensile strength if they have\nthe same relative density and are made of the same powder, under equivalent\nmanufacturing conditions. Furthermore, we provide a set of recommendations and\nbest practices for assessing the performance of optimal tensile strength\nrelationships in general. Based on these guidelines, we identify two new\nmodels, namely the general and mechanistic models, which are effective and\npredictive alternatives to the tensile strength relationship currently used in\nthe pharmaceutical industry.\n", "  A number of groups have employed radio observations of the Galactic center to\nderive stringent constraints on the annihilation cross section of weakly\ninteracting dark matter. In this paper, we show that electron energy losses in\nthis region are likely to be dominated by inverse Compton scattering on the\ninterstellar radiation field, rather than by synchrotron, considerably relaxing\nthe constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section compared to\nprevious works. Strong convective winds, which are well motivated by recent\nobservations, may also significantly weaken synchrotron constraints. After\ntaking these factors into account, we find that radio constraints on\nannihilating dark matter are orders of magnitude less stringent than previously\nreported, and are generally weaker than those derived from current gamma-ray\nobservations.\n", "  Although lower hybrid waves have been shown to be effective in driving plasma\ncurrent in present-day tokamaks, they are predicted to strongly interact with\nthe energetic alpha particles born from fusion reactions in eventual tokamak\nreactors. However, in the presence of the expected steep alpha particle birth\ngradient, this interaction can produce wave amplification rather than wave\ndamping. Here, we identify the flexibilities and constraints in achieving this\namplification effect through a consideration of symmetries in the channeling\ninteraction, in the wave propagation, and in the tokamak field configuration.\nInterestingly, for standard LH current drive that supports the poloidal\nmagnetic field, we find that wave amplification through alpha channeling is\nfundamentally coupled to the poorly understood parallel wavenumber upshift. In\nso doing, we show that wave launch from the tokamak high-field side is\nfavorable both for alpha-channeling and for achieving the parallel wavenumber\nupshift.\n", "  We propose a heralded quantum repeater protocol based on the general\ninterface between the circularly polarized photon and the quantum dot embedded\nin a double-sided optical microcavity. Our effective time-bin encoding on\nphotons results in the deterministic faithful entanglement distribution with\none optical fiber for the transmission of each photon in our protocol, not two\nor more. Our efficient parity-check detector implemented with only one\ninput-output process of a single photon as a result of cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics makes the entanglement channel extension and entanglement\npurification in quantum repeater far more efficient than others, and it has the\npotential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation as well. Meanwhile,\nthe deviation from a collective-noise channel leads to some phase-flip errors\non the nonlocal electron spins shared by the parties and these errors can be\ndepressed by our simplified entanglement purification process. Finally, we\ndiscuss the performance of our proposal, concluding that it is feasible with\ncurrent technology.\n", "  The partition function of four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories\non S^4 computes the exact Kahler potential on the space of exactly marginal\ncouplings [1]. We present a new elementary proof of this result using\nsupersymmetry Ward identities. The partition function is a section rather than\na function, and is subject to ambiguities coming from Kahler transformations\nacting on the Kahler potential. This ambiguity is realized by a local\nsupergravity counterterm in the underlying SCFT. We provide an explicit\nconstruction of the Kahler ambiguity counterterm in the four dimensional N=2\noff-shell supergravity theory that admits S^4 as a supersymmetric background.\n", "  The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground\npresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck HFI polarization data\nfrom 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra $C_\\ell^{EE,BB}$\nover the range $40<\\ell<600$ well away from the Galactic plane. These will\nbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination\nof the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that\nstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large\nfractions of the sky using $C_\\ell$. For the dust, they are well described by\npower laws in $\\ell$ with exponents $\\alpha^{EE,BB}=-2.42\\pm0.02$. The\namplitudes of the polarization $C_\\ell$ vary with the average brightness in a\nway similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence\nis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\\beta_d=1.59$ and\n$T_d=19.6$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic\n$B$- and $E$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting\nregions there are no \"clean\" windows where primordial CMB $B$-mode polarization\ncould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate\nthe level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field. Extrapolation of\nthe Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power\n$\\ell(\\ell+1)C_\\ell^{BB}/(2\\pi)$ of $1.32\\times10^{-2}\\mu$K$_{CMB}^2$ over the\n$40<\\ell<120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\\pm0.29$ and there is an\nadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same\nunits. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\\ell$ range,\nwhich highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even in\nthe cleanest windows of the sky.\n", "  The all-sky Planck survey in 9 frequency bands was used to search for\nemission from all 274 known Galactic supernova remnants. Of these, 16 were\ndetected in at least two Planck frequencies. The radio-through-microwave\nspectral energy distributions were compiled to determine the emission mechanism\nfor microwave emission. In only one case, IC 443, is there high-frequency\nemission clearly from dust associated with the supernova remnant.In all cases,\nthe low-frequency emission is from synchrotron radiation. A single power law,\nas predicted for a population of relativistic particles with energy\ndistribution that extends continuously to high energies, is evident for many\nsources, including the Crab and PKS 1209-51/52. A decrease in flux density\nrelative to the extrapolation of radio emission is evident in several sources.\nTheir spectral energy distributions can be approximated as broken power laws,\n$S_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{-\\alpha}$, with the spectral index, alpha, increasing by\n0.5-1 above a break frequency in the range 10-60 GHz. The break could be due to\nsynchrotron losses.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations are powerful tools for understanding the effects of\nradiation interactions within detector devices allowing not only to evaluate\ntypical estimates for experimental measurements and to serve as means for\ndesigning experiments but to provide additional information that are usually\nnot easily accessible experimentally. A simple numerical approach to describe\nthe functioning of pixelated detectors is presented in this paper. Estimates\nfrom a variety of simulated setups are obtained and the observed features\ncompared with experimental results to verify to which extent they are correctly\ndescribed by this method. Fundamental curves such as interaction probability\nand reconstructed energy deposited are calculated as function of beam energy.\nPixel response, charge sharing effects and resolution estimates are also\nobtained.\n", "  The tunneling ionization of a hydrogen atom excited in the presence of a\nstatic electric field is investigated for the case where, before being\nextracted, the electron has an orbital angular momentum L perpendicular to the\nfield E. The escaping electron has a nonzero mean transverse velocity <vT> in\nthe direction of E cross <L>. This asymmetry is similar to the Collins effect\nin the fragmentation into hadrons of a transversely polarized quark. In\naddition, the linear Stark effect make <L> and <vT> oscillate in time. The\ndegree of asymmetry is calculated at leading order in E for an initial state of\nmaximum transverse <L>. The conditions for the observation of this asymmetry\nare discussed.\n", "  The role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structures\nobserved in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a debated topic. The Planck\nall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353GHz provide the\nrequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation between\nthe structures of the Galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, both\nin the diffuse ISM and in molecular clouds. The data reveal structures, or\nridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the Stokes Q and/or U maps.\nWe focus on structures at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes with column\ndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We measure the magnetic field\norientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present an\nalgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensity\nmap. We use analytical models to account for projection effects. Comparing\npolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratio\nbetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magnetic\nfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. We find that\nthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on the\nstructures. This trend becomes more striking for increasing polarization\nfraction and decreasing column density. We interpret the increase of alignment\nwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. The\ndecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss of\ncorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. In\nmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,\nwhich cannot be accounted for by projection effects. We discuss our results in\nthe context of models and MHD simulations, which describe the formation of\nstructures in the magnetized ISM.\n", "  Some properties of multi-qubit systems interacting with noisy environment is\ndiscussed. The amount of the survival entanglement is quantified for the GHZ\nand W-states. It is shown that the entanglement decay depends on the noise type\n( correlated or non-correlated), number of interacted qubits with the\nenvironment and the initial state which passes through this noisy environment.\nIn general, the GHZ is more fragile than the W-state. The phenomena of\nentanglement sudden death appears only for non-correlated noise.\n", "  We consider in the paper the Nonsymmetric Kaluza-Klein Theory finding a\ncondition for a color confinemet in the theory. We consider also a\nKerner-Wong-Kopczynski equation in this theory. The Nonsymmetric Kaluza-Klein\nTheory with a spontaneous symmetry breaking and Higgs' mechanism is examined.\nWe find a mass spectrum for a broken gauge bosons and Higgs'particles. We\nderive a generalisation of Kerner-Wong-Kopczynski equation in the presence of\nHiggs' field A new term in the equation is a generalization of a Lorentz force\nterm for a Higgs' field. We consider also a bosonic part of GSW\n(Glashow-Salam-Weinberg)model in our theory,getting masses for W, Z bosons and\na Higgs' boson agreed with an experiment.\n", "  A possible relation of the low-lying E1 (pygmy resonance) and toroidal\nstrengths is analyzed by using Skyrme-RPA results for the strength functions,\ntransition densities and current fields in $^{208}$Pb. It is shown that the\nirrotational pygmy motion can appear as a local manifestation of the collective\nvortical toroidal dipole resonance (TDR) at the nuclear surface. The RPA\nresults are compared to unperturbed (1ph) ones.\n", "  We demonstrate reservoir computing with a physical system using a single\nautonomous Boolean logic element with time-delay feedback. The system generates\na chaotic transient with a window of consistency lasting between 30 and 300 ns,\nwhich we show is sufficient for reservoir computing. We then characterize the\ndependence of computational performance on system parameters to find the best\noperating point of the reservoir. When the best parameters are chosen, the\nreservoir is able to classify short input patterns with performance that\ndecreases over time. In particular, we show that four distinct input patterns\ncan be classified for 70 ns, even though the inputs are only provided to the\nreservoir for 7.5 ns.\n", "  Planck observations at 353GHz provide the first fully-sampled maps of the\npolarized dust emission towards interstellar filaments and their backgrounds.\nThe polarization data provide insight on the structure of their magnetic field\n(B). We present the polarization maps of three nearby star forming filament of\nmoderate column density (NH~10^22cm^-2): Musca, B211, and L1506. We use the\nspatial information to separate Stokes I, Q, and U of the filaments from those\nof their backgrounds, an essential step to measure the intrinsic polarization\nfraction (p) and angle (psi) of each emission component. We find that the\npolarization angles in the three filaments (psi_fil) are coherent along their\nlengths and not the same as in their backgrounds (psi_bg). The differences\nbetween psi_fil and psi_bg are 12deg, 6deg, and 54deg for Musca, B211, and\nL1506, respectively. These differences for Musca and L1506 are larger than the\ndispersions of psi, both along the filaments and in their backgrounds. The\nobserved changes of psi are direct evidence for variations of the orientation\nof the plane of the sky (POS) projection of the B-field. As in previous\nstudies, we find a decrease of several percent of p with NH. We show that the\ndrop in p cannot be explained by random fluctuations of the orientation of B\nwithin the filaments because they are too small (sigma_psi<10deg). We recognize\nthe degeneracy between dust alignment efficiency and the structure of B in\ncausing variations in p, but we argue that the decrease of p from the\nbackgrounds to the filaments results in part from depolarization associated\nwith the 3D structure of B: both its orientation in the POS and with respect to\nthe POS. We do not resolve the inner structure of the filaments, but at the\nsmallest scales accessible with Planck (~0.2pc), the observed changes of psi\nand p hold information on the B-field structure within filaments.\n", "  This is a review of the Quantum Chromodynamics Cosmological Phase\nTransitions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma, the production of heavy quark states via\np-p collisions and RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions) using the mixed\nhybrid theory for the $\\Psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ states; and the possible\ndetection of the Quark-Gluon Plasma via heavy quark production using RHIC.\nRecent research on fragmentation for the production of D mesons is reviewed, as\nis future theoretical and experimental research on the Collins and Sivers\nfragmentation functions for pions produced in polarized p-p collisions.\n", "  We consider the general problem of estimating an unknown control parameter of\nan open quantum system. We establish a direct relation between the evolution of\nboth system and environment and the precision with which the parameter can be\nestimated. We show that when the open quantum system undergoes a first-order\ndynamical phase transition the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which gives\nthe upper bound on the achievable precision of any measurement of the system\nand environment, becomes quadratic in observation time (cf. \"Heisenberg\nscaling\"). In fact, the QFI is identical to the variance of the dynamical\nobservable that characterises the phases that coexist at the transition, and\nenhanced scaling is a consequence of the divergence of the variance of this\nobservable at the transition point. This identification allows to establish the\nfinite time scaling of the QFI. Near the transition the QFI is quadratic in\ntime for times shorter than the correlation time of the dynamics. In the regime\nof enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the QFI\ninvolves measuring both system and output. As a particular realisation of these\nideas, we describe a theoretical scheme for quantum enhanced phase estimation\nusing the photons being emitted from a quantum system near the coexistence of\ndynamical phases with distinct photon emission rates.\n", "  In superconductors, electrons bound into Cooper pairs conduct a\ndissipationless current. The strength of the Cooper pairs scales with the value\nof the critical transition temperature (Tc). In cuprate high-Tc\nsuperconductors, however, the pairing mechanism is still unexplained. Here we\nunveil why in the cuprates the Cooper pairs are so strongly bound to work out\nthe extraordinary high Tc. From one-to-one correspondence between numerical\nsimulation on a microscopic cuprate model and a simple two-component fermion\nmodel, we show that hidden fermions emerge from the strong electron correlation\nand give birth to the strongly bound Cooper pairs. This mechanism is distinct\nfrom a conventional pairing mediated by some bosonic glue, such as phonons in\nconventional superconductors. The hidden fermions survive even above Tc and\ngenerate the strange-metal pseudogap phase. This reveals an unprecedented\ndirect relationship between the pseudogap phase and superconductivity in the\ncuprates.\n", "  Heavy ions channeling through crystals with multi-GeV kinetic energies can\ncreate electron-positron pairs. In the framework of the ion, the energy of\nvirtual photons arising from the periodic crystal potential may exceed the\nthreshold $2mc^2$. The repeated periodic collisions with the crystal ions yield\nhigh pair production rates. When the virtual photon frequency matches a nuclear\ntransition in the ion, the production rate can be resonantly increased. In this\ntwo-step excitation-pair conversion scheme, the excitation rates are coherently\nenhanced, and they scale approximately quadratically with the number of crystal\nsites along the channel.\n", "  We propose a family of local CSS stabilizer codes as possible candidates for\nself-correcting quantum memories in 3D. The construction is inspired by the\nclassical Ising model on a Sierpinski carpet fractal, which acts as a classical\nself-correcting memory. Our models are naturally defined on fractal subsets of\na 4D hypercubic lattice with Hausdorff dimension less than 3. Though this does\nnot imply that these models can be realised with local interactions in 3D\nEuclidean space, we also discuss this possibility. The X and Z sectors of the\ncode are dual to one another, and we show that there exists a finite\ntemperature phase transition associated with each of these sectors, providing\nevidence that the system may robustly store quantum information at finite\ntemperature.\n", "  The problem of discontinuous functions and their representations in the form\nof Legendre polynomial series in quantum nuclear scattering theory is presented\nbriefly. The problem is quite old yet not adequately explained in numerous\nQuantum Theory textbooks and sometimes not correctly understood by physicists.\nThis problem might be quite important in interpretation and analyses of nuclear\nelastic scattering data and so requires to be stated in a more detailed and\nclear way.\n", "  In this paper a Weyl geometric scalar tensor theory of gravity with scalar\nfield $\\Phi$ and scale invariant cubic (\"aquadratic\") kinetic Lagrangian is\nintroduced. Einstein gauge (comparable to Einstein frame in Jordan-Brans-Dicke\ntheory) is most natural for studying trajectories. In it, the Weylian scale\nconnection induces an additional acceleration which in the weak field, static,\nlow velocity limit acquires the deep MOND form of Milgrom/Bekenstein's gravity.\nThe energy momentum of $\\Phi$ leads to another add on to Newton acceleration.\nBoth additional accelerations together imply a MOND-ian phenomenology of the\nmodel. It has unusual transition functions. They imply higher phantom energy\ndensity than in the case of the more common MOND models with transition\nfunctions $\\mu_1(x), \\, \\mu_2(x)$. A considerable part of it is due to the\nscalar field's energy density which, in our model, gives a scale and generally\ncovariant expression for the self-energy of the gravitational field.\n", "  The isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) in spherical nuclei\n$^{100-132}$Sn, $^{144}$Sm, and $^{208}$Pb is investigated within the Skyrme\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA) for a variety of Skyrme forces and different\npairing options. The calculated GMR strength functions are directly compared to\nthe available experimental distributions. It is shown that, in accordance to\nresults of other groups, description of GMR in Sn and heavier Sm/Pb nuclei\nneeds different values of the nuclear incompressibilty, $K \\approx$ 200 or 230\nMeV, respectively. Thus none from the used Skyrme forces is able to describe\nGMR in these nuclei simultaneously. The GMR peak energy in open-shell\n$^{120}$Sn is found to depend on the isoscalar effective mass, which might be\npartly used for a solution of the above problem. Some important aspects of the\nproblem (discrepancies of available experimental data, proper treatment of the\nvolume and surface compression in finite nuclei, etc) are briefly discussed.\n", "  We use our mixed hybrid model for the $\\Psi(2S)$ state to estimate $\\Psi(2S)$\nto $J/\\Psi(1S)$ suppression in p-Pb collisions, and the $\\Upsilon(3S)$ state to\nestimate $\\Upsilon(3S)$ to $\\Upsilon(1S)$ suppression in Pb-Pb collisions, and\ncompare to recent experimental measurements.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied nonstationary radiative spherically symmetric\nspacetime, in general covariant theory ($U(1)$ extension) of {the}\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the minimum coupling, in the post-newtonian\napproximation (PPN), without the projectability condition and in the infrared\nlimit. The Newtonian prepotential $\\varphi$ was assumed null. We have shown\nthat there is not the analogue of the Vaidya's solution in the\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Theory (HLT) with the minimum coupling, as we know in the\nGeneral Relativity Theory (GRT).\n", "  We study \"the Wojcik model\" which is a discrete-time quantum walk (QW) with\none defect in one dimension, introduced by Wojcik et al.. For the Wojcik model,\nwe give the weak convergence theorem describing the ballistic behavior of the\nwalker in the probability distribution in a rescaled position-space. In our\nprevious studies, we obtained the time-averaged limit and stationary measures\nconcerning localization for the Wojcik model. As a result, we get the\nmathematical expression of the whole picture of the behavior of the walker for\nthe Wojcik model. Here the coexistence of localization and the ballistic\nspreading is one of the peculiar properties of one-dimensional QWs with one\ndefect. Due to the coexistence, it has been strongly expected to utilize QWs to\nquantum search algorithms. In order to derive the weak convergence theorem, we\ntake advantage of the generating function method. We emphasize that the\ntime-averaged limit measure is symmetric for the origin, however, the weight\nfunction in the weak limit measure is asymmetric in general, which implies that\nthe weak convergence theorem represents the asymmetry of the probability\ndistribution. Furthermore, the weak limit measure heavily depends on the phase\nof the defect and initial state of the walker. Comparing with our previous\nstudies, we also show some numerical results of the probability distribution to\nconfirm that our result is relevant mathematically, and consider the effect of\nchanging the phase and initial coin state on the probability distribution, or\nthe ballistic spreading, which is one of the motivations of our study.\n", "  Planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making it\npossible to trace the Galactic magnetic field structure that pervades the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). We combine polarization data from Planck with\nrotation measure (RM) observations towards a massive star-forming region, the\nRosette Nebula in the Monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic field\nstructure and the impact of an expanding HII region on the morphology of the\nfield. We derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed to\nevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion of\nionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ISM. From the RM data we\nestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field of\nabout 3microG (towards the observer) in the Rosette Nebula, for a uniform\nelectron density of about 12cm-3. The dust shell that surrounds the Rosette HII\nregion is clearly observed in the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz, with a\npolarization signal significantly different from that of the local background\nwhen considered as a whole. The Planck observations constrain the\nplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the Rosette's parent\nmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along the\nGalactic plane. The Planck data are compared with the analytical model, which\npredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shell\nfor a given orientation of the field. This comparison leads to an upper limit\nof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field\nin the Rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of\n4%. This field direction can reproduce the RM values detected in the ionized\nregion if the magnetic field strength in the Monoceros molecular cloud is in\nthe range 6.5--9microG.\n", "  Using Wilson renormalization group, we show that if no integrated vector\noperator of scaling dimension $-1$ exists, then scale invariance implies\nconformal invariance. By using the Lebowitz inequalities, we prove that this\nnecessary condition is fulfilled in all dimensions for the Ising universality\nclass. This shows, in particular, that scale invariance implies conformal\ninvariance for the three-dimensional Ising model.\n", "  We develop a theory for long-distance quantum key distribution based on\nconcatenated entanglement swapping using parametric down-conversion sources and\nshow numerical results of our model. The model incorporates practical resources\nincluding multi-pair sources, inefficient detectors with dark counts and lossy\nchannels. We calculate the maximum secret key-generation ratefor up to three\nentanglement swapping stations by optimizing over resource parameters, and our\nnumerical simulation shows that the range of quantum key distribution can in\nprinciple be markedly increased but at the expense of an atrociously unfeasible\nsecret key-generation rate; however, the upper bound of our key rates closely\napproach the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde upper bound. Our analysis demonstrates the need\nfor new technology such as quantum memory to synchronize photons and our\nmethods should serve as a valuable component for accurately modelling\nquantum-memory-based long-distance quantum key distribution.\n", "  The formation of conducting channels of Ti${}_4$O${}_7$ inside\nTiO${}_2$-based memristors is believed to be the origin for the change in\nelectric resistivity of these devices. While the properties of the bulk\nmaterials are reasonably known, the interface between them has not been studied\nup to now mostly due to their different crystalline structures. In this work we\npresent a way to match the interfaces between TiO${}_2$ and Ti${}_4$O${}_7$ and\nsubsequently the band offset between these materials is obtained from density\nfunctional theory based calculations. The results show that while the valence\nband is located at the Ti${}_4$O${}_7$, the conduction band is found at the\nTiO${}_2$ structure, resulting into a type II interface. In this case, the\nTi${}_4$O${}_7$ would act as a donor to the TiO${}_2$ matrix.\n", "  In this paper, we exhibit the non-formal star-exponential of the Lie group\nSL(2,R) realized geometrically on the curvature contraction of its one-sheeted\nhyperboloid orbits endowed with its natural non-formal star-product. It is done\nby a direct resolution of the defining equation of the star-exponential and\nproduces an expression with Bessel functions. This yields a continuous group\nhomomorphism from SL(2,R) into the von Neumann algebra of multipliers of the\nHilbert algebra underlied by this natural star-product. As an application, we\nprove a new identity on Bessel functions.\n", "  Within ten nearby (d < 450 pc) Gould Belt molecular clouds we evaluate\nstatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected on\nthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of Galactic dust\nobserved by Planck at 353 GHz, and the gas column density structures,\nquantified by the gradient of the column density, $N_H$. The selected regions,\ncovering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angular\nresolution of 10' FWHM, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in the\nnearest cloud. The column densities in the selected regions range from $N_H\n\\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulk\nof the molecular clouds. The relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixel\nand analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called\n\"Histogram of Relative Orientations\". Throughout this study, we assume that the\npolarized emission observed by Planck at 353 GHz is representative of the\nprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume a\nconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.\nWithin most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressively\nwith increasing $N_H$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferred\norientation to preferentially perpendicular. In simulations of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relative\norientation is a signature of Alfv\\'enic or sub-Alfv\\'enic turbulence, implying\nthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scales\nprobed by Planck. We compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimates\nwe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the Planck\nobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation and\nevolution.\n", "  In this contribution, we investigate the entanglement behavior of a composite\nsystem consists of two different dimensional subsystems in non-inertial frames.\nIn particular, we consider a composite system of qubit(two-dimensional)\nsubsystem, and qutrit, (three-dimensional) subsystem. The degree of\nentanglement is quantified for different cases, where it is assumed that the\ntwo-subsystems are simultaneously or non- simultaneously accelerated. The\nentanglement decays as the acceleration of any subsystem increases.In general,\nthe decay rate of entanglement increases as the dimensional of the accelerated\nsubsystem increases. These results could be important in building an\naccelerated quantum network consists of different dimensions nodes.\n", "  We report measurements of a new type of magnetoresistance in Pt and Ta thin\nfilms. The spin accumulation created at the surfaces of the film by the spin\nHall effect decreases in a magnetic field because of the Hanle effect,\nresulting in an increase of the electrical resistance as predicted by Dyakonov\n[PRL 99, 126601 (2007)]. The angular dependence of this magnetoresistance\nresembles the recently discovered spin Hall magnetoresistance in Pt/Y3Fe5O12\nbilayers, although the presence of a ferromagnetic insulator is not required.\nWe show that this Hanle magnetoresistance is an alternative, simple way to\nquantitatively study the coupling between charge and spin currents in metals\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  The laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum fidelity, dependent on\nthe underlying system dimensionality $D$, have so far been verified in exactly\nsolvable $1D$ models, belonging to or equivalent to interacting, quadratic\n(quasifree), spinless or spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The obtained results\nare so appealing that in quest for correlation lengths and associated universal\ncritical indices $\\nu$, which characterize the divergence of correlation\nlengths on approaching critical points, one might be inclined to substitute the\nhard task of determining an asymptotic behavior of a two-point correlation\nfunction by an easier one, of determining the quantum-critical scaling of the\nquantum fidelity. However, the role of system's dimensionality has been left as\nan open problem. Our aim in this paper is to fill up this gap, at least\npartially, by verifying the laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum\nfidelity in a $2D$ case. To this end, we study correlation functions and\nquantum fidelity of $2D$ exactly solvable models, which are interacting,\nquasifree, spinfull, lattice-fermion models. The considered $2D$ models exhibit\nnew, as compared with $1D$ ones, features:at a given quantum-critical point\nthere exists a multitude of correlation lengths and multiple universal critical\nindices $\\nu$, since these quantities depend on spatial directions, moreover,\nthe indices $\\nu$ may assume larger values. These facts follow from the\nobtained by us analytical asymptotic formulae for two-point correlation\nfunctions. In such new circumstances we discuss the behavior of quantum\nfidelity from the perspective of quantum-critical scaling theory. In\nparticular, we are interested in finding out to what extent the quantum\nfidelity approach may be an alternative to the correlation-function approach in\nstudies of quantum-critical points beyond 1D.\n", "  Results of a search for decays of massive particles to fully hadronic final\nstates are presented. This search uses 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the\nATLAS detector in $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV proton--proton collisions at the LHC.\nSignatures based on high jet multiplicities without requirements on the missing\ntransverse momentum are used to search for $R$-parity-violating supersymmetric\ngluino pair production with subsequent decays to quarks. The analysis is\nperformed using a requirement on the number of jets, in combination with\nseparate requirements on the number of $b$-tagged jets, as well as a\ntopological observable formed from the scalar sum of the mass values of\nlarge-radius jets in the event. Results are interpreted in the context of all\npossible branching ratios of direct gluino decays to various quark flavors. No\nsignificant deviation is observed from the expected Standard Model backgrounds\nestimated using jet-counting as well as data-driven templates of the\ntotal-jet-mass spectra. Gluino pair decays to ten or more quarks via\nintermediate neutralinos are excluded for a gluino with mass $m_{\\tilde{g}} <\n1$ TeV for a neutralino mass $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} = 500$ GeV. Direct gluino\ndecays to six quarks are excluded for $m_{\\tilde{g}} < 917$ GeV for\nlight-flavor final states, and results for various flavor hypotheses are\npresented.\n", "  Properly modulated flatband lattices have a divergent density of states at\nthe flatband energy. Quasiperiodic modulations are known to host a metal\ninsulator transition already in one space dimension. Their embedding into\nflatband geometries consequently allows for a precise engineering and fine\ntuning of mobility edges. We obtain analytic expressions for singular mobility\nedges for two flatband lattice examples. In particular, we engineer cases with\narbitrarily small energy separations of mobility edge, zeroes, and\ndivergencies.\n", "  Transport by helical edge states of a quantum spin Hall insulator is\nexperimentally characterized by a weakly temperature-dependent mean free path\nof a few microns and by reproducible conductance oscillations, challenging\nproposed theoretical explanations. We consider a model where edge electrons\nexperience spatially random Rashba spin-orbit coupling and couple to a magnetic\nimpurity with spin S >= 1/2. In a finite bias steady state, we find for S > 1/2\nan impurity induced resistance with a temperature dependence in agreement with\nexperiments. Since backscattering is elastic, interference between different\nscatterers possibly explains conductance fluctuations.\n", "  Observation of high-temperature superconductivity in sulfur hydrides at\nmegabar pressures has generated an irresistible wave on searching for new\nsuperconductors in other compressed hydrogen-rich compounds. An immediate\neffort is towards exploration of the relevant candidate of tellurium hydrides,\nwhere tellurium is isoelectronic to sulfur but it has a heavier atomic mass and\nmuch weaker electronegativity. The hitherto unknown phase diagram of tellurium\nhydrides at high pressures was investigated by a first-principles swarm\nstructure search. Four energetically stable and metallic stoichiometries of\nH4Te, H5Te2, HTe and HTe3 were uncovered above 140 GPa, showing a distinct\npotential energy map of tellurium hydrides from those in sulfur and selenium\nhydrides. The two hydrogen-rich H4Te and H5Te2 species adopt ionic structures\ncontaining exotic quasi-molecular H2 and linear H3 units, respectively. Strong\nelectron-phonon couplings associated with the intermediate-frequency H-derived\nwagging and bending modes make them good superconductors with high Tc in the\nrange of 46-104 K.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic(AFM) insulator-superconductor transition has been\nalways a center of interest in the underlying physics of unconventional\nsuperconductors. The quantum phase transition between Mott insulator with AFM\nand superconductor can be induced by doping charge carriers in high-Tc cuprate\nsuperconductors. For the best characterized organic superconductors of\nk-(BEDT-TTF)2X (X=anion), a first order transition between AFM insulator and\nsuperconductor can be tuned by applied external pressure or chemical pressure.\nAlso, the superconducting state can be directly developed from AFM insulator by\napplication of pressure in Cs3C60. The resemblance of these phase diagrams\nhints a universal mechanism governing the unconventional superconductivity in\nclose proximity to AFM insulators. However, the superconductivity in iron-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors evolves from an AFM bad metal by doping charge\ncarriers, and no superconductor-insulator transition has been observed so far.\nHere, we report a first-order transition from superconductor to insulator with\na strong charge doping induced by ionic gating in the thin flakes of single\ncrystal (Li,Fe)OHFeSe. The Tc is continuously enhanced with electron doping by\nionic gating up to a maximum Tc of 43 K, and a striking\nsuperconductor-insulator transition occurs just at the verge of optimal doping\nwith highest Tc. A novel phase diagram of temperature-gating voltage with the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition is mapped out, indicating that the\nsuperconductor -insulator transition is a common feature for unconventional\nsuperconductivity. These results help to uncover the underlying physics of\niron-based superconductivity as well as the universal mechanism of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity. Our finding also suggests that the gate-controlled strong\ncharge doping makes it possible to explore novel states of matter in a way\nbeyond traditional methods.\n", "  In this work, we introduce GRChombo: a new numerical relativity code which\nincorporates full adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) using block structured\nBerger-Rigoutsos grid generation. The code supports non-trivial\n\"many-boxes-in-many-boxes\" mesh hierarchies and massive parallelism through the\nMessage Passing Interface (MPI). GRChombo evolves the Einstein equation using\nthe standard BSSN formalism, with an option to turn on CCZ4 constraint damping\nif required. The AMR capability permits the study of a range of new physics\nwhich has previously been computationally infeasible in a full 3+1 setting,\nwhilst also significantly simplifying the process of setting up the mesh for\nthese problems. We show that GRChombo can stably and accurately evolve standard\nspacetimes such as binary black hole mergers and scalar collapses into black\nholes, demonstrate the performance characteristics of our code, and discuss\nvarious physics problems which stand to benefit from the AMR technique.\n", "  High temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides and chalcogenides\nemerges when a magnetic phase is suppressed. The multi-orbital character and\nthe strength of correlations underlie this complex phenomenology, involving\nmagnetic softness and anisotropies, with Hund's coupling playing an important\nrole. We review here the different theoretical approaches used to describe the\nmagnetic interactions in these systems. We show that taking into account the\norbital degree of freedom allows us to unify in a single phase diagram the main\nmechanisms proposed to explain the (\\pi,0) order in iron pnictides: the\nnesting-driven, the exchange between localized spins, and the Hund induced\nmagnetic state with orbital differentiation. Comparison of theoretical\nestimates and experimental results helps locate the Fe superconductors in the\nphase diagram. In addition, orbital physics is crucial to address the magnetic\nsoftness, the doping dependent properties, and the anisotropies.\n", "  The Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model of coupled inertial, Hamiltonian\nrotors is a prototype for conservative dynamics in systems with long-range\ninteractions. We consider the case where the interactions between the rotors\nare governed by a network described by a weighted adjacency matrix. By studying\nthe linear stability of the incoherent state, we find that the transition to\nsynchrony occurs at a coupling constant $K$ inversely proportional to the\nlargest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. We derive a closed system of\nequations for a set of local order parameters and use these equations to study\nthe effect of network heterogeneity on the synchronization of the rotors. We\nfind that for values of $K$ just beyond the transition to synchronization the\ndegree of synchronization is highly dependent on the network's heterogeneity,\nbut that for large values of $K$ the degree of synchronization is robust to\nchanges in the heterogeneity of the network's degree distribution. Our results\nare illustrated with numerical simulations on Erd\\\"os-Renyi networks and\nnetworks with power-law degree distributions.\n", "  If the beginning of inflation is defined at the moment when the vacuum energy\nof the inflaton starts to dominate, the energy density of the other fields at\nthat moment is (by definition) comparable to the inflaton. Although the\nfraction will be small at the horizon exit due to the inflationary expansion,\nthey can alter the scale dependence of the spectrum. At the same time, velocity\nof the inflaton field may not coincide with the slow-roll (attractor) velocity.\nThose dynamics could be ubiquitous but can easily alter the scale dependence of\nthe spectrum. Since the scale dependence is currently used to constrain or even\nexclude inflation models, it is very important to measure its shift, which is\ndue to the dynamics that does not appear in the original inflation model.\nConsidering typical examples, we show that the spectral index of the tensor\nmode is a useful measure of such effect. Precise measurement of the higher\nrunnings of the scalar mode will be helpful in discriminating the source.\n", "  We use the three-scale framework of Hu et al. to show how the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background anisotropy spectrum depends on the fundamental constants.\nAs expected, the spectrum depends only on \\emph{dimensionless} combinations of\nthe constants, and we emphasize the points that make this generally true for\ncosmological observables. Our analysis suggests that the CMB spectrum shape is\nmostly determined by $\\alpha^2m_e/m_p$ and the proton-CDM-particle mass ratio,\n$m_p/\\mchi$. The distance to the last-scattering surface depends on\n$Gm_p\\mchi/\\hbar c$, so published CMB observational limits on time variations\nof the constants implicitly assume the time-independence of this quantity, as\nwell as assuming a flat-\\lcdm~cosmological model. On the other hand,\nlow-redshift BAO, $H_0$ and baryon-mass-fraction measurements can be combined\nwith the \\emph{shape} of the CMB spectrum to give information that is largely\nindependent of these assumptions. In particular we show that the\npre-recombination values of $G\\mchi^2/\\hbar c$, $m_p/\\mchi$ and\n$\\alpha^2m_e/m_p$ are equal to their present values at a precision of\n$\\sim15\\%$.\n", "  We construct the NHEG phase space, the classical phase space of Near-Horizon\nExtremal Geometries with fixed angular momenta and entropy, and with the\nlargest symmetry algebra. We focus on vacuum solutions to $d$ dimensional\nEinstein gravity. Each element in the phase space is a geometry with\n$SL(2,\\mathbb R)\\times U(1)^{d-3}$ isometries which has vanishing $SL(2,\\mathbb\nR)$ and constant $U(1)$ charges. We construct an on-shell vanishing symplectic\nstructure, which leads to an infinite set of symplectic symmetries. In four\nspacetime dimensions, the phase space is unique and the symmetry algebra\nconsists of the familiar Virasoro algebra, while in $d>4$ dimensions the\nsymmetry algebra, the NHEG algebra, contains infinitely many Virasoro\nsubalgebras. The nontrivial central term of the algebra is proportional to the\nblack hole entropy. This phase space and in particular its symmetries might\nserve as a basis for a semiclassical description of extremal rotating black\nhole microstates.\n", "  We study the effective transfer matrix within the semiclassical and\nbifurcation phases of CDT quantum gravity. We find that for sufficiently large\nlattice volumes the kinetic term of the effective transfer matrix has a\ndifferent sign in each of the two phases. We argue that this sign change can be\nviewed as a Wick rotation of the metric. We discuss the likely microscopic\nmechanism responsible for the bifurcation phase transition, and propose an\norder parameter that can potentially be used to determine the precise location\nand order of the transition. Using the effective transfer matrix we\napproximately locate the position of the bifurcation transition in some region\nof coupling constant space, allowing us to present an updated version of the\nCDT phase diagram.\n", "  In the present paper we examine, from the purely theoretical point of view\nand in a model-independent way, the case, when matter, gauge and Higgs fields\nare allowed to propagate in the bulk of five-dimensional brane world models\nwith compact extra dimension, and the Standard Model fields and their\ninteractions are supposed to be reproduced by the corresponding zero\nKaluza-Klein modes. An unexpected result is that in order to avoid possible\npathological behavior in the fermion sector, it is necessary to impose\nconstraints on the fermion field Lagrangian. In the case when the fermion zero\nmodes are supposed to be localized at one of the branes, these constraints\nimply an additional relation between the vacuum profile of the Higgs field and\nthe form of the background metric. Moreover, this relation between the vacuum\nprofile of the Higgs field and the form of the background metric results in the\nexact reproduction of the gauge boson and fermion sectors of the Standard Model\nby the corresponding zero mode four-dimensional effective theory in all the\nphysically relevant cases, allowed by the absence of pathologies. Meanwhile,\ndeviations from these conditions can lead either back to pathological behavior\nin the fermion sector or to a variance between the resulting zero mode\nfour-dimensional effective theory and the Standard Model, which, depending on\nthe model at hand, may, in principle, result in constraints putting the theory\nout of the reach of the present day experiments.\n", "  Explosive percolation in a network is a phase transition where a large\nportion of nodes becomes connected with an addition of a small number of edges.\nAlthough extensively studied in random network models and reconstructed real\nnetworks, explosive percolation has not been observed in a more realistic\nscenario where a network is generated by thresholding a similarity matrix\ndescribing between-node associations. In this report, I examine construction\nschemes of such thresholded networks, and demonstrate that explosive\npercolation can be observed by introducing edges in a particular order.\n", "  We use numerical and analytical tools to demonstrate arguments in favor of\nthe existence of a family of smooth, symplectic diffeomorphisms of the\ntwo-dimensional torus that have both a positive measure set with positive\nLyapunov exponent and a positive measure set with zero Lyapunov exponent. The\nfamily we study is the unfolding of an almost-hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the\nboundary of the set of Anosov diffeomorphisms, proposed by Lewowicz.\n", "  Fine structures in the tunneling spectra of superconductors have been widely\nused to identify fingerprints of the interaction responsible for Cooper\npairing. Here we show that for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of Pb, the\ninclusion of inelastic tunneling processes is crucial for the proper\ninterpretation of these fine structures. For STM the usual McMillan inversion\nalgorithm of tunneling spectra must therefore be modified to include inelastic\ntunneling events, an insight that is crucial for the identification of the\npairing glue in conventional and unconventional superconductors alike.\n", "  Single-layer FeSe film on SrTiO3(001) was recently found to be the champion\nof interfacial superconducting systems, with a much enhanced superconductivity\nthan the bulk iron-based superconductors. Its superconducting mechanism is of\ngreat interest. Although the film has a simple Fermi surface topology, its\npairing symmetry is unsettled. Here by using low-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM), we systematically investigated the superconductivity of\nsingle-layer FeSe/SrTiO3(001) films. We observed fully gapped tunneling\nspectrum and magnetic vortex lattice in the film. Quasi-particle interference\n(QPI) patterns reveal scatterings between and within the electron pockets, and\nput constraints on possible pairing symmetries. By introducing impurity atoms\nonto the sample, we show that the magnetic impurities (Cr, Mn) can locally\nsuppress the superconductivity but the non-magnetic impurities (Zn, Ag and K)\ncannot. Our results indicate that single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 has a plain s-wave\nparing symmetry whose order parameter has the same phase on all Fermi surface\nsections.\n", "  Recent experimental findings and theoretical predictions suggest that\nnitrogen-doped CVD-grown graphene may give rise to electronic band gaps due to\nimpurity distributions which favour segregation on a single sublattice. Here we\ndemonstrate theoretically that such distributions give rise to more complex\nbehaviour in the presence of edges, where geometry determines whether electrons\nin the sample view the impurities as a gap-opening average potential or as\nscatterers. Zigzag edges give rise to the latter case, and remove the\nelectronic bandgaps predicted in extended graphene samples. We predict that\nsuch behaviour will give rise to leakage near grain boundaries with a similar\ngeometry or in zigzag-edged etched devices. Furthermore, we examine the\nformation of one-dimensional metallic channels at interfaces between different\nsublattice domains, which should be observable experimentally and offer\nintriguing waveguiding possibilities.\n", "  The Kawazumi-Zhang invariant $\\varphi$ for compact genus-two Riemann surfaces\nwas recently shown to be a eigenmode of the Laplacian on the Siegel upper\nhalf-plane, away from the separating degeneration divisor. Using this fact and\nthe known behavior of $\\varphi$ in the non-separating degeneration limit, it is\nshown that $\\varphi$ is equal to the Theta lift of the unique (up to\nnormalization) weak Jacobi form of weight $-2$. This identification provides\nthe complete Fourier-Jacobi expansion of $\\varphi$ near the non-separating\nnode, gives full control on the asymptotics of $\\varphi$ in the various\ndegeneration limits, and provides a efficient numerical procedure to evaluate\n$\\varphi$ to arbitrary accuracy. It also reveals a mock-type holomorphic Siegel\nmodular form of weight $-2$ underlying $\\varphi$. From the general relation\nbetween the Faltings invariant, the Kawazumi-Zhang invariant and the\ndiscriminant for hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, a Theta lift representation\nfor the Faltings invariant in genus two readily follows.\n", "  This paper proposes a simple model to capture the complexity of multi-layer\nsystems where their constituent layers affect, are affected by, each other. The\nphysical layer is a circuit composed by a power source and resistors in\nparallel. Individual agents can add, remove or keep the resistors they have,\nand their decisions aiming at maximising the delivered power - a non-linear\nfunction dependent on the others' behaviour - based on their internal state,\ntheir global state perception, the information received from their neighbours\nin the communication network, and a randomised selfishness. We develop an\nagent-based simulation to analyse the effects of number of agents (size of the\nsystem), communication network topology, communication errors and the minimum\npower gain that triggers a behavioural change. Our results show that a\nwave-like behaviour at macro-level (caused by individual changes in the\ndecision layer) can only emerge for a specific system size, the ratio between\ncooperators and defectors depends on minimum gain assumed - lower minimal gains\nlead to less cooperation and vice-versa, different communication network\ntopologies lead to different levels of power utilisation and fairness at the\nphysical layer, and a certain level of error in the communication layer leads\nto more cooperation.\n", "  Band-inverted electron-hole bilayers support quantum spin Hall insulator and\nexciton condensate phases. We investigate such a bilayer in an external\nmagnetic field. We show that the interlayer correlations lead to formation of a\nhelical quantum Hall exciton condensate state. In contrast to the chiral edge\nstates of the quantum Hall exciton condensate in electron-electron bilayers,\nexistence of the counterpropagating edge modes results in formation of a ground\nstate spin-texture not supporting gapless single-particle excitations. This\nfeature has deep consequences for the low energy behavior of the system.\nNamely, the charged edge excitations in a sufficiently narrow Hall bar are\nconfined, i.e.~a charge on one of the edges always gives rise to an opposite\ncharge on the other edge. Moreover, we show that magnetic field and gate\nvoltages allow to control confinement-deconfinement transition of charged edge\nexcitations, which can be probed with nonlocal conductance.\nConfinement-deconfinement transitions are of great interest, not least because\nof their possible significance in shedding light on the confinement problem of\nquarks.\n", "  Optimally hybrid numerical solvers were constructed for massively parallel\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem (GEP).The strong scaling benchmark was carried\nout on the K computer and other supercomputers for electronic structure\ncalculation problems in the matrix sizes of M = 10^4-10^6 with upto 105 cores.\nThe procedure of GEP is decomposed into the two subprocedures of the reducer to\nthe standard eigenvalue problem (SEP) and the solver of SEP. A hybrid solver is\nconstructed, when a routine is chosen for each subprocedure from the three\nparallel solver libraries of ScaLAPACK, ELPA and EigenExa. The hybrid solvers\nwith the two newer libraries, ELPA and EigenExa, give better benchmark results\nthan the conventional ScaLAPACK library. The detailed analysis on the results\nimplies that the reducer can be a bottleneck in next-generation (exa-scale)\nsupercomputers, which indicates the guidance for future research. The code was\ndeveloped as a middleware and a mini-application and will appear online.\n", "  The expressions of momentum and energy of a particle in special relativity\nare often derived in a quite unconvincing manner in elementary text, by\nresorting either to electrodynamic or quantum considerations, or via the\nintroduction of the less-than-elementary concept of a four-vector. It is\ninstead possible, by exploiting considerations introduced by P. Epstein and A.\nEinstein and exploited later by Feynman, to obtain a fully elementary\nderivation of these expressions and of the $E=mc^2$ formula exploiting only\nLorentz transformations and the postulate of the conservation of quantities\ndefined for point-like particles which reduce to the Newtonian expressions of\nmomentum and energy in the classical limit.\n", "  The control of light transmission through a Fabry-Perot cavity containing\natoms is theoretically investigated, when the cavity mode beam and an\nintersecting control beam are both close to specific atomic resonances. A\nfour-level atomic system is considered and its interaction with the cavity mode\nis studied by solving for the time dependent cavity field and atomic state\npopulations. The conditions for optical bistability of the atom-cavity system\nare obtained in steady state limit. For an ensemble of atoms in the cavity\nmode, the response of the intra-cavity light intensity to the intersecting\nresonant beam is understood for stationary atoms (closed system) and non-static\natoms (open system). The open system is modelled by adjusting the atomic state\npopulations to represent the exchange of atoms in the cavity mode, with the\nthermal environment. The solutions to the model are used to qualitatively\nexplain the observed steady state and transient behaviour of the light in the\ncavity mode, in Sharma et. al. [1]. The control behaviour with three- and\ntwo-level atomic systems is also studied, and the rich physics arising out of\nthese systems, for closed and open atomic systems is discussed.\n", "  We consider Higgs production in gluon fusion and in particular the prediction\nof the Higgs transverse momentum distribution. We discuss the ambiguities\naffecting the matching procedure between fixed order matrix elements and the\nresummation to all orders of the terms enhanced by $\\log(p_T^H/m_H)$ factors.\nFollowing a recent proposal (Grazzini et al., hep-ph/1306.4581), we argue that\nthe gluon fusion process, computed considering two active quark flavors, is a\nmultiscale problem from the point of view of the resummation of the collinear\nsingular terms. We perform an analysis at parton level of the collinear\nbehavior of the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ real emission amplitudes; relying on\nthe collinear singularities structure of the latter, we derive an upper limit\nto the range of transverse momenta where the collinear approximation is valid.\nThis scale is then used as the value of the resummation scale in the analytic\nresummation framework or as the value of the $h$ parameter in the POWHEG-BOX\ncode. A variation of this scale can be used to generate an uncertainty band\nassociated to the matching procedure. Finally, we provide a phenomenological\nanalysis in the Standard Model, in the Two Higgs Doublet Model and in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In the two latter cases, we provide an\nansatz for the central value of the matching parameters not only for a Standard\nModel-like Higgs boson, but also for heavy scalars and in scenarios where the\nbottom quark may play the dominant role.\n", "  We present a manifestly local, diffeomorphism invariant and locally Poincare\ninvariant formulation of vacuum energy sequestering. In this theory, quantum\nvacuum energy generated by matter loops is cancelled by auxiliary fields. The\nauxiliary fields decouple from gravity almost completely. Their only residual\neffect is an a priori arbitrary, finite contribution to the curvature of the\nbackground geometry, which is radiatively stable. Its value is to be determined\nby a measurement, like the finite part of any radiatively stable UV-sensitive\nquantity in quantum field theory.\n", "  Applying the general framework for local zeta regularization proposed in Part\nI of this series of papers, we renormalize the vacuum expectation value of the\nstress-energy tensor (and of the total energy) for a scalar field in presence\nof an external harmonic potential.\n", "  The amplitude of localized quantum states in random or disordered media may\nexhibit long range exponential decay. We present here a theory that unveils the\nexistence of an effective potential which finely governs the confinement of\nthese states. In this picture, the boundaries of the localization subregions\nfor low energy eigenfunctions correspond to the barriers of this effective\npotential, and the long range exponential decay characteristic of Anderson\nlocalization is explained as the consequence of multiple tunneling in the dense\nnetwork of barriers created by this effective potential. Finally, we show that\nthe Weyl's formula based on this potential turns out to be a remarkable\napproximation of the density of states for a large variety of one-dimensional\nsystems, periodic or random.\n", "  The quest for a B-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on the\npolarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires the\ncharacterization of foreground polarization from Galactic dust. We present a\nstatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 GHz Planck Stokes\nmaps at high Galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as a\npolarized foreground to the CMB. We filter the intensity and polarization maps\nto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetry\nbetween E-modes and B-modes is observed. Using the Smoothed Hessian Major Axis\nFilament Finder, we identify 259 filaments at high Galactic latitude, with\nlengths larger or equal to 2\\deg\\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for a\ntypical distance of 100 pc). These filaments show a preferred orientation\nparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derived\nfrom their polarization angles. We present mean maps of the filaments in Stokes\nI, Q, U, E, and B, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align the\norientations of the filaments. Combining the stacked images and the histogram\nof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of the\nfilaments to be 11 %. Furthermore, we show that the correlation between the\nfilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the E and B\nasymmetry and the $C_{\\ell}^{TE}/C_{\\ell}^{EE}$ ratio, reported in the power\nspectra analysis of the Planck 353 GHz polarization maps. Future models of the\ndust foreground for CMB polarization studies will need to take into account the\nobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure of\ninterstellar matter.\n", "  The idea to utilize not only the charge but also the spin of electrons in the\noperation of electronic devices has led to the development of spintronics,\ncausing a revolution in how information is stored and processed. A novel\nadvancement would be to develop ultrafast spintronics using femtosecond laser\npulses. Employing terahertz (10$^{12}$ Hz) emission spectroscopy, we\ndemonstrate optical generation of spin-polarized electric currents at the\ninterfaces of metallic ferromagnetic heterostructures at the femtosecond\ntimescale. The direction of the photocurrent is controlled by the helicity of\nthe circularly polarized light. These results open up new opportunities for\nrealizing spintronics in the unprecedented terahertz regime and provide new\ninsights in all-optical control of magnetism.\n", "  Non-linear charge transport in SIS Josephson junctions has a unique signature\nin the shuttled charge quantum between the two superconductors. In the\nzero-bias limit Cooper pairs, each with twice the electron charge, carry the\nJosephson current. An applied bias $V_{SD}$ leads to multiple Andreev\nreflections (MAR), which in the limit of weak tunneling probability should lead\nto integer multiples of the electron charge $ne$ traversing the junction, with\n$n$ integer larger than $2{\\Delta}/eV_{SD}$ and ${\\Delta}$ the superconducting\norder parameter. Exceptionally, just above the gap, $eV_{SD}>2{\\Delta}$, with\nAndreev reflections suppressed, one would expect the current to be carried by\npartitioned quasiparticles; each with energy dependent charge, being a\nsuperposition of an electron and a hole. Employing shot noise measurements in\nan SIS junction induced in an InAs nanowire (with noise proportional to the\npartitioned charge), we first observed quantization of the partitioned charge\n$q=e^*/e=n$, with $n=1-4$; thus reaffirming the validity of our charge\ninterpretation. Concentrating next on the bias region\n$eV_{SD}{\\approx}2{\\Delta}$, we found a reproducible and clear dip in the\nextracted charge to $q{\\approx}0.6$, which, after excluding other\npossibilities, we attribute to the partitioned quasiparticle charge. Such dip\nis supported by numerical simulations of our SIS structure.\n", "  Applying the general framework for local zeta regularization proposed in Part\nI of this series of papers, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation\nvalue of several observables (in particular, of the stress-energy tensor and of\nthe total energy) for a massless scalar field confined within a rectangular box\nof arbitrary dimension.\n", "  The Jahn-Teller distortion, by its very nature, is often at the heart of the\nvarious electronic properties displayed by perovskites and related materials.\nDespite the Jahn-Teller mode being non- polar in nature, we devise and\ndemonstrate in the present letter an electric field control of Jahn-Teller\ndistortions in bulk perovskites. The electric field control is enabled through\nan anharmonic lattice mode coupling between the Jahn-Teller distortion and a\npolar mode. We confirm this coupling, and explicitly an electric field effect,\nthrough first principles calculations. The coupling will always exist within\nthe P b2 1 m space group, which is found to be the favoured ground state for\nvarious perovskites under sufficient tensile epitaxial strain. Intriguingly,\nthe calculations reveal that this mechanism is not only restricted to\nJahn-Teller active systems, promising a general route to tune or induce novel\nelectronic functionality in perovskites as a whole.\n", "  Recently hints of lepton flavor non-universality emerged in the BaBar and\nLHCb experiments. In this paper we propose tests of lepton universality in\n$\\nu_{\\tau}$ scattering. To parametrize the new physics we adopt an effective\nLagrangian approach and consider the neutrino deep inelastic scattering\nprocesses $\\nu_{\\tau}+ N \\to \\tau + X$ and $\\nu_{\\mu}+ N \\to \\mu + X$ where we\nassume the largest new physics effects are in the $\\tau$ sector. We also\nconsider an explicit leptoquark model in our calculations. In order to make\ncomparison with the standard model and also in order to cancel out the\nuncertainties of the parton distribution functions, we consider the ratio of\ntotal and differential cross sections of tau-neutrino to muon-neutrino\nscattering. We find new physics effects that can possibly be observed at the\nproposed Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment at CERN.\n", "  Crystallography may be the gold standard of protein structure determination,\nbut obtaining the necessary high-quality crystals is also in some ways akin to\nprospecting for the precious metal. The tools and models developed in soft\nmatter physics to understand colloidal assembly offer some insights into the\nproblem of crystallizing proteins. This topical review describes the various\nanalogies that have been made between proteins and colloids in that context. We\nhighlight the explanatory power of patchy particle models, but also the\nchallenges of providing guidance for crystallizing specific proteins. We\nconclude with a presentation of possible future research directions. This\narticle is intended for soft matter scientists interested in protein\ncrystallization as a self-assembly problem, and as an introduction to the\npertinent physics literature for protein scientists more generally.\n", "  Light top squarks (stops) and light higgsinos are the key features of natural\nSUSY, where the higgsinos $\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{1,2}$\nare nearly degenerate and act as the missing transverse energy ($E^{miss}_T$)\nat the LHC. Besides the strong production, the stop can be produced via the\nelectroweak interaction. The determination of the electroweak properties of the\nstop is an essential task for the LHC and future colliders. So in this paper,\nwe investigate the single stop ($\\tilde{t}_1$) production $pp \\to \\tilde{t}_1+\nE^{miss}_T$ in the natural SUSY at the LHC, which gives the monotop signature\n$t+ E^{miss}_T$ from $\\tilde{t}_1\\to t \\tilde{\\chi}^0_{1,2}$ or the monobottom\nsignature $b+ E^{miss}_T$ from $\\tilde{t}_1 \\to b \\tilde{\\chi}^+_{1}$. We\nperform Monte Carlo simulations for these signatures and obtain the results:\n(1) The signal $b+ E^{miss}_T$ has a better sensitivity than $t+ E^{miss}_T$\nfor probing natural SUSY; (2) The parameter region with a higgsino mass 100\nGeV$\\lesssim \\mu \\lesssim$ 225 GeV and stop mass $m_{\\tilde{t}_1} \\lesssim$ 620\nGeV, can be probed through the single stop production with $S/\\sqrt{B} > 3$ and\n$4\\% \\lesssim S/B \\lesssim19\\%$ at 14 TeV HL-LHC with an integrated luminosity\nof 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  We revisit three of the mathematical formalisms used to describe magnetized\nquark matter in compact objects within the MIT and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodels and then compare their results. The tree formalisms are based on 1)\nisotropic equations of state, 2) anisotropic equations of state with different\nparallel and perpendicular pressures and 3) the assumption of a chaotic field\napproximation that results in a truly isotropic equation of state. We have seen\nthat the magnetization obtained with both models is very different: while the\nMIT model produces well-behaved curves that are always positive for large\nmagnetic fields, the NJL model yields a magnetization with lots of spikes and\nnegative values. This fact has strong consequences on the results based on the\nexistence of anisotropic equations of state. We have also seen that, while the\nisotropic formalism results in maximum stellar masses that increase\nconsiderably when the magnetic fields increase, maximum masses obtained with\nthe chaotic field approximation never vary more than 5.5$\\%$. The effect of the\nmagnetic field on the radii is opposed in the MIT and NJL models: with both\nformalisms, isotropic and chaotic field approximation, for a fixed mass, the\nradii increase with the increase of the magnetic field in the MIT bag model and\ndecrease in the NJL, the radii of quark stars described by the NJL model being\nsmaller than the ones described by the MIT model.\n", "  We present thermal measurements of large area (over $1,000$~$\\mu$m$^2$)\nmonolayer graphene samples at cryogenic temperatures to study the\nelectron-phonon thermal conductivity of graphene. By using two large samples\nwith areas which differ by a factor of 10, we are able to clearly show the area\ndependence of the electron-phonon cooling. We find that, at temperatures far\nbelow the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature $T_\\mathrm{BG}$, the electron-phonon\ncooling power is accurately described by the $T^4$ temperature dependence\npredicted for clean samples. Using this model, we are able to extract a value\nfor the electron-phonon coupling constant as a function of gate voltage, and\nthe graphene electron-lattice deformation potential. We also present results\nfor thermal conductance at higher temperatures, above $T_\\mathrm{BG}/4$, for\nwhich the clean limit no longer applies. In this regime we find a cooling power\nwhich is accurately described qualitatively, but not quantitatively, by a model\nwhich predicts the emission of very high energy phonons through a\ndisorder-assisted mechanism.\n", "  Studying the reflection of X-rays off the inner edge of the accretion disk in\na neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, allows us to investigate the accretion\ngeometry and to constrain the radius of the neutron star. We report on a NuSTAR\nobservation of 4U 1608-52 obtained during a faint outburst in 2014 when the\nneutron star, which has a known spin frequency of 620 Hz, was accreting at\n~1-2% of the Eddington limit. The 3-79 keV continuum emission was dominated by\na Gamma~2 power law, with a ~1-2% contribution from a kTbb~0.3-0.6 keV black\nbody component. The high-quality NuSTAR spectrum reveals the hallmarks of disk\nreflection; a broad iron line peaking near 7~keV and a Compton back-scattering\nhump around ~20-30 keV. Modeling the disk reflection spectrum points to a\nbinary inclination of i~30-40 degrees and a small `coronal' height of h<8.5\nGM/c2. Furthermore, our spectral analysis suggests that the inner disk radius\nextended to Rin~7-10 GM/c2, close to the innermost stable circular obit. This\nconstrains the neutron star radius to R<21 km and the redshift from the stellar\nsurface to z>0.12, for a mass of M=1.5 Msun and a spin parameter of a=0.29.\n", "  We observe strong collective coupling between an optical cavity and the\nforbidden spin singlet to triplet optical transition $^1$S$_0$ to $^3$P$_1$ in\nan ensemble of $^{88}$Sr. Despite the transition being 1000 times weaker than a\ntypical dipole transition, we observe a well resolved vacuum Rabi splitting. We\nuse the observed vacuum Rabi splitting to make non-destructive measurements of\natomic population with the equivalent of projection-noise limited sensitivity\nand minimal heating ($<0.01$ photon recoils/atom). This technique may be used\nto enhance the performance of optical lattice clocks by generating entangled\nstates and reducing dead time.\n", "  The black hole candidates exhibit fast variability of their X-ray emission on\na wide range of timescales. The short, coherent variations, with frequencies\nabove 1 Hz, are referred to as quasi-periodic oscillations, and are generally\nexplained by resonant effects in the black hole accretion flow. The purely\nstochastic variability that occurs due to turbulent conditions in the plasma,\nis quantified by the power density spectra and appears practically in all types\nof sources and their spectral states. The specific kind of quasi-periodic\nflares is expected, when the global structure of the accretion flow, governed\nby the nonlinear hydrodynamics, induces fluctuations around a fixed point\nsolution. These conditions, which occur at high accretion rates, lead to the\nvariability in the sense of deterministic chaos. We study the nonlinear\nbehaviour of X-ray sources using the recurrence analysis method. We estimate\nquantitatively the indications for deterministic chaos, such as the Renyi's\nentropy, for the observed time series, and we compare them with the surrogate\ndata. Using the data collected by RXTE satellite, we reveal the oscillations\npattern and the observable properties of six black hole systems. We confirm\nthat both the well known microquasar GRS 1915+105, as well as its recently\ndiscovered analogue, IGR J17091-3624, exhibit variability characteristic to\ndeterministic chaotic system. We conclude therefore that the underlying nature\nof the process must be intrinsically connected in these sources with the\naccretion flow instability, that leads to the limit cycle oscillations around a\nfixed point. Furthermore, we studied four other black hole candidates with high\naccretion rates. For GX 339-4, GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1550-564 we obtained\nsignificant results for some observations, whereas for XTE J1650-500 no such\ndata set was found.\n", "  The effect of the helicity on the dynamics of the turbulent flows is\ninvestigated. The aim is to disentangle the role of helicity in fixing the\ndirection, the intensity and the fluctuations of the energy transfer across the\ninertial range of scales. We introduce an external parameter, $\\alpha$, that\ncontrols the mismatch between the number of positive and negative helically\npolarized Fourier modes. We present the first set of direct numerical\nsimulations of Navier-Stokes equations from the fully symmetrical case,\n$\\alpha=0$, to the fully asymmetrical case, $\\alpha=1$, when only helical modes\nof one sign survive. We found a singular dependency of the direction of the\nenergy cascade on $\\alpha$, measuring a positive forward flux as soon as only a\nfew modes with different helical polarities are present. On the other hand,\nsmall-scales fluctuations are sensitive only to the degree of mode-reduction,\nleading to a vanishing intermittency already for values of $\\alpha \\sim 0.1$\nand independently of the degree of mirror symmetry-breaking. Our findings\nsuggest that intermittency is the result of a global mode-coupling in Fourier\nspace.\n", "  We present a new method to characterize unresolved point sources (PSs),\ngeneralizing traditional template fits to account for non-Poissonian photon\nstatistics. We apply this method to Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray data\nto characterize PS populations at high latitudes and in the Inner Galaxy. We\nfind that PSs (resolved and unresolved) account for ~50% of the total\nextragalactic gamma-ray background in the energy range ~1.9 to 11.9 GeV. Within\n10$^\\circ$ of the Galactic Center with $|b| \\geq 2^\\circ$, we find that ~5-10%\nof the flux can be accounted for by a population of unresolved PSs, distributed\nconsistently with the observed ~GeV gamma-ray excess in this region. The excess\nis fully absorbed by such a population, in preference to dark-matter\nannihilation. The inferred source population is dominated by near-threshold\nsources, which may be detectable in future searches.\n", "  The first flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA)\nexperiment recorded 16 radio signals that were emitted by cosmic-ray induced\nair showers. For 14 of these events, this radiation was reflected from the ice.\nThe dominant contribution to the radiation from the deflection of positrons and\nelectrons in the geomagnetic field, which is beamed in the direction of motion\nof the air shower. This radiation is reflected from the ice and subsequently\ndetected by the ANITA experiment at a flight altitude of 36km. In this paper,\nwe estimate the energy of the 14 individual events and find that the mean\nenergy of the cosmic-ray sample is 2.9 EeV. By simulating the ANITA flight, we\ncalculate its exposure for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We estimate for the\nfirst time the cosmic-ray flux derived only from radio observations. In\naddition, we find that the Monte Carlo simulation of the ANITA data set is in\nagreement with the total number of observed events and with the properties of\nthose events.\n", "  We use rigorous group-theoretic techniques and molecular dynamics to\ninvestigate the connection between structural symmetry and ionic conductivity\nin the garnet family of solid Li-ion electrolytes. We identify new ordered\nphases and order-disorder phase transitions that are relevant for conductivity\noptimization. Ionic transport in this materials family is controlled by the\nfrustration of the Li sublattice caused by incommensurability with the host\nstructure at non-integer Li concentrations, while ordered phases explain\nregions of sharply lower conductivity. Disorder is therefore predicted to be\noptimal for ionic transport in this and other conductor families with strong Li\ninteraction.\n", "  We construct the classical phase space of geometries in the near-horizon\nregion of vacuum extremal black holes as announced in [arXiv:1503.07861].\nMotivated by the uniqueness theorems for such solutions and for perturbations\naround them, we build a family of metrics depending upon a single periodic\nfunction defined on the torus spanned by the $U(1)$ isometry directions. We\nshow that this set of metrics is equipped with a consistent symplectic\nstructure and hence defines a phase space. The phase space forms a\nrepresentation of an infinite dimensional algebra of so-called symplectic\nsymmetries. The symmetry algebra is an extension of the Virasoro algebra whose\ncentral extension is the black hole entropy. We motivate the choice of\ndiffeomorphisms leading to the phase space and explicitly derive the symplectic\nstructure, the algebra of symplectic symmetries and the corresponding conserved\ncharges. We also discuss a formulation of these charges with a Liouville type\nstress-tensor on the torus defined by the $U(1)$ isometries and outline\npossible future directions.\n", "  Non-Markovian effects in the evolution of open quantum systems have recently\nattracted widespread interest, particularly in the context of assessing the\nefficiency of energy and charge transfer in nanoscale biomolecular networks and\nquantum technologies. With the aid of many-body simulation methods, we uncover\nand analyse an ultrafast environmental process that causes energy relaxation in\nthe reduced system to depend explicitly on the phase relation of the initial\nstate preparation. Remarkably, for particular phases and system parameters, the\nnet energy flow is uphill, transiently violating the principle of detailed\nbalance, and implying that energy is spontaneously taken up from the\nenvironment. A theoretical analysis reveals that non-secular contributions,\nsignificant only within the environmental correlation time, underlie this\neffect. This suggests that environmental energy harvesting will be observable\nacross a wide range of coupled quantum systems.\n", "  We present an analysis of the effects of beam deconvolution on noise\nproperties in CMB measurements. The analysis is built around the artDeco beam\ndeconvolver code. We derive a low-resolution noise covariance matrix that\ndescribes the residual noise in deconvolution products, both in harmonic and\npixel space. The matrix models the residual correlated noise that remains in\ntime-ordered data after destriping, and the effect of deconvolution on it. To\nvalidate the results, we generate noise simulations that mimic the data from\nthe Planck LFI instrument. A $\\chi^2$ test for the full 70 GHz covariance in\nmultipole range $\\ell=0-50$ yields a mean reduced $\\chi^2$ of 1.0037. We\ncompare two destriping options, full and independent destriping, when\ndeconvolving subsets of available data. Full destriping leaves substantially\nless residual noise, but leaves data sets intercorrelated. We derive also a\nwhite noise covariance matrix that provides an approximation of the full noise\nat high multipoles, and study the properties on high-resolution noise in pixel\nspace through simulations.\n", "  The control of multiferroic domains through external electric fields has been\nstudied by dielectric measurements and by polarized neutron diffraction on\nsingle-crystalline TbMnO$_3$. Full hysteresis cycles were recorded by varying\nan external field of the order of several kV/mm and by recording the chiral\nmagnetic scattering as well as the charge in a sample capacitor. Both methods\nyield comparable coercive fields that increase upon cooling.\n", "  Increasing the spin imbalance in superconductors can spatially modulate the\ngap by forming Cooper pairs with finite momentum. For large imbalances compared\nto the Fermi energy, the inhomogeneous FFLO superconductor ultimately becomes a\nnormal metal. There is mounting experimental evidence for this scenario in 2D\norganic superconductors in large in-plane magnetic fields; this is complemented\nby ongoing efforts to realize this scenario in coupled tubes of atomic Fermi\ngases with spin imbalance. Yet, a theory for the phase transition from a metal\nto an FFLO superconductor has not been developed so far and the universality\nclass has remained unknown. Here we propose and analyze a spin imbalance driven\nquantum critical point between a 2D metal and an FFLO phase in anisotropic\nelectron systems. We derive the effective action for electrons and bosonic FFLO\npairs at this quantum phase transition. Using this action, we predict non-Fermi\nliquid behavior and the absence of quasi-particles at a discrete set of hot\nspots on the Fermi surfaces. This results in strange power-laws in\nthermodynamics and response functions, which are testable with existing\nexperimental set-ups on 2D organic superconductors and may also serve as\nsignatures of the elusive FFLO phase itself. The proposed universality class is\ndistinct from previously known quantum critical metals and, because its\ncritical fluctuations appear already in the pairing channel, a promising\ncandidate for naked metallic quantum criticality over extended temperature\nranges.\n", "  The adaptive immune system relies on the diversity of receptors expressed on\nthe surface of B and T-cells to protect the organism from a vast amount of\npathogenic threats. The proliferation and degradation dynamics of different\ncell types (B cells, T cells, naive, memory) is governed by a variety of\nantigenic and environmental signals, yet the observed clone sizes follow a\nuniversal power law distribution. Guided by this reproducibility we propose\neffective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective\nfitness. This fitness is determined by growth factors acting either on clones\nof cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on\nsingle cells with no regards for clones. We identify fluctuations in the\nfitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to\nthe observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments we\ncharacterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide\ntools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and\norganisms. Our results generalize to any evolving population in a fluctuating\nenvironment.\n", "  The ding-a-ling model is a kind of half lattice and half hard-point-gas (HPG)\nmodel. The original ding-a-ling model proposed by Casati {\\it et.al} does not\nconserve total momentum and has been found to exhibit normal heat conduction\nbehavior. Recently, a modified ding-a-ling model which conserves total momentum\nhas been studied and normal heat conduction has also been claimed. In this\nwork, we propose a full lattice ding-a-ling model without hard point collisions\nwhere total momentum is also conserved. We investigate the heat conduction and\nenergy diffusion of this full lattice ding-a-ling model with three different\nnonlinear inter-particle potential forms. For symmetrical potential lattices,\nthe thermal conductivities diverges with lattice length and their energy\ndiffusions are superdiffusive signaturing anomalous heat conduction. For\nasymmetrical potential lattices, although the thermal conductivity seems to\nconverge as the length increases, the energy diffusion is definitely deviating\nfrom normal diffusion behavior indicating anomalous heat conduction as well. No\nnormal heat conduction behavior can be found for the full lattice ding-a-ling\nmodel.\n", "  $e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ is an integral part of the global precision analysis\nprogram which is becoming more relevant after the discovery of the Higgs boson.\nWe analyze the current situation of precision calculations of inclusive\n$e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ observables, and study the prospects of incorporating them\ninto the framework of global precision electroweak analyses in light of\nper-mil-level cross section measurements at proposed future facilities. We\npresent expansion formulas for the observables, making the dependence on the\ninputs clear. Also, the calculation of new physics effects is demonstrated in\nthe effective field theory framework for universal theories. We go beyond the\ntriple-gauge-couplings parametrization, and illustrate the complementarity of\n$e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ and other precision data at the observables level.\n", "  We study the role that both vacuum fluctuations and vacuum entanglement of a\nscalar field play in identifying the spacetime topology, which is not\nprescribed from first principles---neither in general relativity or quantum\ngravity. We analyze how the entanglement and observable correlations acquired\nbetween two particle detectors are sensitive to the spatial topology of\nspacetime. We examine the detector's time evolution to all orders in\nperturbation theory and then study the phenomenon of vacuum entanglement\nharvesting in Minkowski spacetime and two flat topologically distinct\nspacetimes constructed from identifications of the Minkowski space. We show\nthat, for instance, if the spatial topology induces a preferred direction, this\ndirection may be inferred from the dependence of correlations between the two\ndetectors on their orientation. We therefore show that vacuum fluctuations and\nvacuum entanglement harvesting makes it, in principle, possible to distinguish\nspacetimes with identical local geometry that differ only in their topology.\n", "  We have performed DC and AC magnetization measurements for the rare-earth\nmagnetic alloy systems Gd_{0.62}Y_{0.38}, Tb_{0.86}Y_{0.14}, and\nDy_{0.97}Y_{0.03}. These materials commonly exhibit a proper helical magnetic\nstructure, and ferromagnetic structure at lower temperatures.In all of these\nmaterials, a difference between zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization and\nfield-cooled (FC) magnetization and a hysteresis loop in the M-H curve have\nbeen observed in the helimagnetic phases. The non-equilibrium behavior is\npossibly caused by a common nature, e. g., chiral domain structures. In\naddition to the above behavior, strong non-linearity of the magnetization and\nslow spin dynamics have been observed around the N'eel temperature only in\nGd$_{0.62}$Y$_{0.38}$. The spin-glass like behavior observed in\nGd_{0.62}Y_{0.38} could be related to a novel glassy state such as a\nhelical-glass state.\n", "  The pentaquark component is included in the proton wave functions to study\nphi meson production proton-antiproton annihilation reactions. With all\npossible configurations of the uuds subsystem proposed for describing the\nstrangeness spin and magnetic moment of the proton, we estimate the branching\nratios of the annihilation reactions at rest proton-antiproton to phi + X\n(X=pi, eta, rho, omega) from atomic proton-antiproton S- and P-wave states by\nusing effective quark line diagrams incorporating the 3P0 model. The best\nagreement of theoretical prediction with the experimental data is found when\nthe pentaquark configuration of the proton wave function takes the flavor-spin\nsymmetry, [4]_FS [22]_F [22]_S.\n", "  Hubbard-like Hamiltonians are widely used to describe on-site Coulomb\ninteractions in magnetic and strongly-correlated solids, but there is much\nconfusion in the literature about the form these Hamiltonians should take for\nshells of p and d orbitals. This paper derives the most general s, p and d\norbital Hubbard-like Hamiltonians consistent with the relevant symmetries, and\npresents them in ways convenient for practical calculations. We use the full\nconfiguration interaction method to study p and d orbital dimers and compare\nresults obtained using the correct Hamiltonian and the collinear and vector\nStoner Hamiltonians. The Stoner Hamiltonians can fail to describe properly the\nnature of the ground state, the time evolution of excited states, and the\nelectronic heat capacity.\n", "  We report the observation of quantum reflection from a narrow, attractive,\npotential using bright solitary matter-waves formed from a 85Rb Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. We create narrow potentials using a tightly focused, red-detuned\nlaser beam, and observe reflection of up to 25% of the atoms, along with the\ntrapping of atoms at the position of the beam. We show that the observed\nreflected fraction is much larger than theoretical predictions for a narrow\nGaussian potential well; a more detailed model of bright soliton propagation,\naccounting for the generic presence of small subsidiary intensity maxima in the\nred-detuned beam, suggests that these small intensity maxima are the cause of\nthis enhanced reflection.\n", "  There is compelling evidence that most -if not all- galaxies harbour a\nsuper-massive black hole (SMBH) at their nucleus, hence binaries of these\nmassive objects are an inevitable product of the hierarchical evolution of\nstructures in the universe, and represent an important but thus-far elusive\nphase of galaxy evolution. Gas accretion via a circumbinary disc is thought to\nbe important for the dynamical evolution of SMBH binaries, as well as in\nproducing luminous emission that can be used to infer their properties. One\nplausible source of the gaseous fuel is clumps of gas formed due to turbulence\nand gravitational instabilities in the interstellar medium, that later fall\ntoward and interact with the binary. In this context, we model numerically the\nevolution of turbulent clouds in near-radial infall onto equal-mass SMBH\nbinaries, using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. We present a total\nof 12 simulations that explore different possible pericentre distances and\nrelative inclinations, and show that the formation of circumbinary discs and\ndiscs around each SMBH ('mini-discs') depend on those parameters. We also study\nthe dynamics of the formed discs, and the variability of the feeding rate onto\nthe SMBHs in the different configurations.\n", "  The partition function of the two-dimensional Ising model is exactly obtained\non a lattice with a twisted boundary condition. The continuum limit of the\nmodel off the critical temperature is found to give the mass-deformed Ising\nconformal field theory (CFT) on the torus with the complex structure $\\tau$. We\nfind that the renormalization group (RG) flow of the mass parameter can be\nholographically described in terms of the three-dimensional gravity including a\nscalar field with a simple nonlinear kinetic function and a quadratic\npotential.\n", "  We set up a field theory model to describe the longitudinal low energy modes\nin high density matter present in white dwarf stars. At the relevant scales,\nions -- the nuclei of oxygen, carbon and helium -- are treated as heavy\npoint-like spin-0 charged particles in an effective field theory approach,\nwhile the electron dynamics is described by the Dirac Lagrangian at the\none-loop level. We show that there always exists a longitudinal gapless mode in\nthe system irrespective whether the ions are in a plasma, crystal, or quantum\nliquid state. For certain values of the parameters, the gapless mode can be\ninterpreted as a zero sound mode and, for other values, as an ion acoustic\nwave; we show that the zero sound and ion acoustic wave are complementary to\neach other. We discuss possible physical consequences of these modes for\nproperties of white dwarfs.\n", "  We derive the evolution equation for the second order curvature perturbation\nusing standard techniques of cosmological perturbation theory. We do this for\ndifferent definitions of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation, arising\nfrom different splits of the spatial metric, and compare the expressions. The\nresults are valid at all scales and include all contributions from scalar,\nvector and tensor perturbations, as well as anisotropic stress, with all our\nresults written purely in terms of gauge invariant quantities. Taking the\nlarge-scale approximation, we find that a conserved quantity exists only if, in\naddition to the non-adiabatic pressure, the transverse traceless part of the\nanisotropic stress tensor is also negligible. We also find that the version of\nthe gauge invariant curvature perturbation which is exactly conserved is the\none defined with the determinant of the spatial part of the inverse metric.\n", "  When an impurity interacts with a bath of phonons it forms a polaron. For\nincreasing interaction strengths the mass of the polaron increases and it can\nbecome self-trapped. For impurity atoms inside an atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) the nature of this transition is subject of debate. While\nFeynman's variational approach predicts a sharp transition for light\nimpurities, renormalization group studies always predict an extended\nintermediate-coupling region characterized by large phonon correlations. To\ninvestigate this intricate regime we suggest a versatile experimental setup\nthat allows to tune both the mass of the impurity and its interactions with the\nBEC. The impurity is realized as a dark-state polariton (DSP) inside a quasi\ntwo-dimensional BEC. We show that its interactions with the Bogoliubov phonons\nlead to photonic polarons, described by the Bogoliubov-Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian,\nand make theoretical predictions using an extension of a recently introduced\nrenormalization group approach to Fr\\\"ohlich polarons.\n", "  We synthesize and partly review recent developments relating the physics of\nthe half-filled Landau level in two dimensions to correlated surface states of\ntopological insulators in three dimensions. The latter are in turn related to\nthe physics of certain three dimensional quantum spin liquid states. The\nresulting insights provide an interesting answer to the old question of how\nparticle-hole symmetry is realized in composite fermion liquids. Specifically\nthe metallic state at filling $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}$ - described originally in\npioneering work by Halperin , Lee, and Read as a liquid of composite fermions -\nwas proposed recently by Son to be described by a particle-hole symmetric\neffective field theory distinct from that in the prior literature. We show how\nthe relation to topological insulator surface states leads to a physical\nunderstanding of the correctness of this proposal. We develop a simple picture\nof the particle-hole symmetric composite fermion through a modification of\nolder pictures as electrically neutral \"dipolar\" particles. We revisit the\nphenomenology of composite fermi liquids (with or without particle-hole\nsymmetry), and show that their heat/electrical transport dramatically violates\nthe conventional Wiedemann-Franz law but satisfies a modified one. We also\ndiscuss the implications of these insights for finding physical realizations of\ncorrelated topological insulator surfaces.\n", "  We perform a joint analysis of current data from cosmology and laboratory\nexperiments to constrain the neutrino mass parameters in the framework of\nbayesian statistics, also accounting for uncertainties in nuclear modeling,\nrelevant for neutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay ($0\\nu2\\beta$) searches. We find\nthat a combination of current oscillation, cosmological and $0\\nu2\\beta$ data\nconstrains $m_{\\beta\\beta}~<~0.045\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ ($0.014 \\, \\mathrm{eV} <\nm_{\\beta\\beta} < 0.066 \\,\\mathrm{eV}$) at 95\\% C.L. for normal (inverted)\nhierarchy. This result is in practice dominated by the cosmological and\noscillation data, so it is not affected by uncertainties related to the\ninterpretation of $0\\nu2\\beta$ data, like nuclear modeling, or the exact\nparticle physics mechanism underlying the process. We then perform forecasts\nfor forthcoming and next-generation experiments, and find that in the case of\nnormal hierarchy, given a total mass of $0.1\\,$ eV, and assuming a\nfactor-of-two uncertainty in the modeling of the relevant nuclear matrix\nelements, it will be possible to measure the total mass itself, the effective\nMajorana mass and the effective electron mass with an accuracy (at 95\\% C.L.)\nof $0.05$, $0.015$, $0.02\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ respectively, as well as to be\nsensitive to one of the Majorana phases. This assumes that neutrinos are\nMajorana particles and that the mass mechanism gives the dominant contribution\nto $0\\nu2\\beta$ decay. We argue that more precise nuclear modeling will be\ncrucial to improve these sensitivities.\n", "  We present a concept of non-Gaussian measurement composed of a non-Gaussian\nancillary state, linear optics and adaptive heterodyne measurement, and on the\nbasis of this we also propose a simple scheme of implementing a quantum cubic\ngate on a traveling light beam. In analysis of the cubic gate in the Heisenberg\nrepresentation, we find that nonlinearity of the gate is independent from\nnonclassicality; the nonlinearity is generated solely by a classical nonlinear\nadaptive control in a measurement-and-feedforward process while the\nnonclassicality is attached by the non-Gaussian ancilla that suppresses excess\nnoise in the output. By exploiting the noise term as a figure of merit, we\nconsider the optimum non-Gaussian ancilla that can be prepared within reach of\ncurrent technologies and discuss performance of the gate. It is a crucial step\ntowards experimental implementation of the quantum cubic gate.\n", "  We demonstrate the appearance of zero-energy bound states satisfying the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermionic algebra in interacting quantum wires with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity.\n  The fourfold degeneracy of these states is protected by time-reversal\nsymmetry and fermion-parity conservation, and leads to an $8 \\pi$ periodicity\nof the Josephson current due to the tunneling of fractionalized excitations\nwith charge $e/2$. Even in the presence of perturbations, we propose that this\nperiodicity will remain visible in driven, current-biased Shapiro step\nmeasurements on current state-of-the-art Rashba wires.\n", "  Motivated by the colossal negative thermal expansion recently found in\nBiNiO$_3$, the valence transition accompanied by the charge transfer between\nthe Bi and Ni sites is theoretically studied. We introduce an effective model\nfor Bi-$6s$ and Ni-$3d$ orbitals with taking into account the valence skipping\nof Bi cations, and investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase\ndiagrams within the mean-field approximation. We find that the valence\ntransition is caused by commensurate locking of the electron filling in each\norbital associated with charge and magnetic orderings, and the critical\ntemperature and the nature of the transitions are strongly affected by the\nrelative energy between the Bi and Ni levels and the effective\nelectron-electron interaction in the Bi sites. The obtained phase diagram well\nexplains the temperature- and pressure-driven valence transitions in BiNiO$_3$\nand the systematic variation of valence states for a series of Bi and Pb\nperovskite oxides.\n", "  We select $f(R)$ gravity models that undergo scale factor duality\ntransformations. As a starting point, we consider the tree-level effective\ngravitational action of bosonic String Theory coupled with the dilaton field.\nThis theory inherits the Busher's duality of its parent String Theory. Using\nconformal transformations of the metric tensor, it is possible to map the\ntree-level dilaton-graviton string effective action into $f(R)$ gravity,\nrelating the dilaton field to the Ricci scalar curvature. Furthermore, the\nduality can be framed under the standard of Noether symmetries and exact\ncosmological solutions are derived. Using suitable changes of variables, the\nstring-based $f(R)$ Lagrangians are shown in cases where the duality\ntransformation becomes a parity inversion.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos in the electronvolt mass range are hinted at by a number of\nterrestrial neutrino experiments. However, such neutrinos are highly\nincompatible with data from the Cosmic Microwave Background and large scale\nstructure. This paper discusses how charging sterile neutrinos under a new\npseudoscalar interaction can reconcile eV sterile neutrinos with terrestrial\nneutrino data. We show that this model can reconcile eV sterile neutrinos in\ncosmology, providing a fit to all available data which is way better than the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model with one additional fully thermalized sterile\nneutrino. In particular it also prefers a value of the Hubble parameter much\ncloser to the locally measured value.\n", "  In this paper we show that in addition to the known minimal surfaces which\nappear in the literature for computing the entanglement entropy there are other\nminimal surfaces with non-zero extrinsic curvature. We use the approach of\nregularization procedure for computing the quadratic and cubic curvature\ninvariants on manifolds with squashed cones. The results can be used to find\nthe leading and universal terms of the holographic entanglement entropy to\nunderstand which solution corresponds to the actual minimal surface.\n", "  We experimentally determine the equation of state of a laser cooled gas. By\nemploying the Lane-Emden formalism, widely used in astrophysics, we derive the\nequilibrium atomic profiles in large magneto optical traps where the\nthermodynamic effects are cast in a polytropic equation of state. The effects\nof multiple scattering of light are included, which results in a generalized\nLane-Emden equation for the atomic profiles. A detailed experimental\ninvestigation reveals an excellent agreement with the model, with a two-fold\nsignificance. In one hand, we can infer on the details of the equation of state\nof the system, from an ideal gas to a correlated phase due to an effective\nelectrical charge for the atoms, which is accurately described by a\nmicroscopical description of the effective electrostatic interaction. On the\nother hand, we are able map the effects of multiple scattering onto directly\ncontrollable experimental variables, which paves the way to subsequent\nexperimental investigations of this collective interaction.\n", "  We have studied the role of thermalization in lifetime reduction of quantum\nmemory based on multi-atomic ensembles. Herein, it is shown to be impossible to\nremove the thermaization-caused decoherence in such systems using the methods\nof dynamical decoupling. We have analyzed the existing models of the\nthermalization and have proposed a new understanding of the thermalization as a\nresult of the internal processes which are not described in the unitary quantum\ndynamics formalism. The possible ways for reducing the negative influence of\nthermalization on the quantum memory lifetime are also discussed.\n", "  The anomalously large experimentally measured ratios of the semitauonic decay\n$B\\rightarrow D^{(*)} +\\tau+\\nu$ and the corresponding semileptonic\n$B\\rightarrow D^{*} +\\l+\\bar{\\nu}_l$ disagree with the predictions of the\nstandard E.W + QCD model(S.M).\n  We briefly comment on this disagreement and on possible new physics\nexplanations which are rather constrained and difficult to implement.\n", "  We show that the Standard Model vacuum can be stabilized if all particle\npropagators are non-minimally coupled to gravity. This is due to a\nHiggs-background dependent redefinition of the Standard Model fields: in terms\nof canonical variables and in the large Higgs field limit, the quantum\nfluctuations of the redefined fields are suppressed by the Higgs background.\nThus, in this regime, quantum corrections to the tree-level electroweak\npotential are negligible. Finally, we show that in this framework the Higgs\nboson can be responsible for inflation. Due to a numerical coincidence that\noriginates from the CMB data, inflation can happen if the Higgs boson mass, the\ntop mass, and the QCD coupling lie in a region of the parameter space\napproximately equivalent than the one allowing for electroweak vacuum stability\nin the Standard Model. We find some (small) regions in the Standard Model\nparameter space in which the new interaction \"rescues\" the electroweak vacuum,\nwhich would not be stable in the Standard Model.\n", "  The integro-differential wave equation for the probability density function\nfor a classical one-dimensional L\\'evy walk with continuous sample paths has\nbeen derived. This equation involves a classical wave operator together with\nmemory integrals describing the spatio-temporal coupling of the L\\'evy walk. It\nis valid for any running time PDF and it does not involve any long-time\nlarge-scale approximations. It generalizes the well-known telegraph equation\nobtained from the persistent random walk. Several non-Markovian cases are\nconsidered when the particle's velocity alternates at the gamma and power-law\ndistributed random times.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the predictions of the forward approximation in some\nmodels which exhibit an Anderson (single-) or many-body localized phase. This\napproximation, which consists in summing over the amplitudes of only the\nshortest paths in the locator expansion, is known to over-estimate the critical\nvalue of the disorder which determines the onset of the localized phase.\nNevertheless, the results provided by the approximation become more and more\naccurate as the local coordination (dimensionality) of the graph, defined by\nthe hopping matrix, is made larger. In this sense, the forward approximation\ncan be regarded as a mean field theory for the Anderson transition in infinite\ndimensions. The sum can be efficiently computed using transfer matrix\ntechniques, and the results are compared with the most precise exact\ndiagonalization results available.\n  For the Anderson problem, we find a critical value of the disorder which is\n$0.9\\%$ off the most precise available numerical value already in 5 spatial\ndimensions, while for the many-body localized phase of the Heisenberg model\nwith random fields the critical disorder $h_c=4.0\\pm 0.3$ is strikingly close\nto the most recent results obtained by exact diagonalization. In both cases we\nobtain a critical exponent $\\nu=1$. In the Anderson case, the latter does not\nshow dependence on the dimensionality, as it is common within mean field\napproximations.\n  We discuss the relevance of the correlations between the shortest paths for\nboth the single- and many-body problems, and comment on the connections of our\nresults with the problem of directed polymers in random medium.\n", "  We experimentally and numerically demonstrate deterministic creation and\nmanipulation of a pair of oppositely charged singly quantized vortices in a\nhighly oblate Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Two identical blue-detuned,\nfocused Gaussian laser beams that pierce the BEC serve as repulsive obstacles\nfor the superfluid atomic gas; by controlling the positions of the beams within\nthe plane of the BEC, superfluid flow is deterministically established around\neach beam such that two vortices of opposite circulation are generated by the\nmotion of the beams, with each vortex pinned to the \\emph{in situ} position of\na laser beam. We study the vortex creation process, and show that the vortices\ncan be moved about within the BEC by translating the positions of the laser\nbeams. This technique can serve as a building block in future experimental\ntechniques to create, on-demand, deterministic arrangements of few or many\nvortices within a BEC for precise studies of vortex dynamics and vortex\ninteractions.\n", "  We numerically investigate an experimentally viable method, that we will\nrefer to as the \"chopsticks method\", for generating and manipulating on-demand\nseveral vortices in a highly oblate atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in\norder to initialize complex vortex distributions for studies of vortex\ndynamics. The method utilizes moving laser beams (the \"chopsticks\") to\ngenerate, capture and transport vortices inside and outside the BEC. We examine\nin detail this methodology and show a wide parameter range of applicability for\nthe prototypical two-vortex case, and show case examples of producing and\nmanipulating several vortices for which there is no net circulation, equal\nnumbers of positive and negative circulation vortices, and for which there is\none net quantum of circulation. We find that the presence of dissipation can\nhelp stabilize the pinning of the vortices on their respective laser beam\npinning sites. Finally, we illustrate how to utilize laser beams as\nrepositories that hold large numbers of vortices and how to deposit individual\nvortices in a sequential fashion in the repositories in order to construct\nsuperfluid flows about the repository beams with several quanta of circulation.\n", "  We study the finite-shear-rate rheology of disordered solids by means of\nmolecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. By systematically varying the\ndamping magnitude $\\zeta$ in the low-temperature limit, we identify two well\ndefined flow regimes, separated by a thin (temperature-dependent) crossover\nregion. In the overdamped regime, the athermal rheology is governed by the\ncompetition between elastic forces and viscous forces, whose ratio gives the\nWeissenberg number $Wi= \\zeta \\dot\\gamma$ (up to elastic parameters); the\nmacroscopic stress $\\Sigma$ follows the frequently encountered Herschel-Bulkley\nlaw $\\Sigma= \\Sigma\\_0 + k \\sqrt{Wi}$, with yield stress\n$\\Sigma\\_0\\textgreater{}0$. In the underdamped (inertial) regime, dramatic\nchanges in the rheology are observed for low damping: the flow curve becomes\nnon-monotonic. This change is not caused by longer-lived correlations in the\nparticle dynamics at lower damping; instead, for weak dissipation, the sample\nheats up considerably due to, and in proportion to, the driving. By suitably\nthermostatting more or less underdamped systems, we show that their rheology\nonly depends on their kinetic temperature and the shear rate, rescaled with\nEinstein's vibration frequency.\n", "  We study a three-dimensional plaquette spin model whose low temperature\ndynamics is glassy, due to localised defects and effective kinetic constraints.\nWhile the thermodynamics of this system is smooth at all temperatures, we show\nthat coupling it to a second system with a fixed (quenched) configuration can\nlead to a phase transition, at finite coupling. The order parameter is the\noverlap between the copies, and the transition is between phases of low and\nhigh overlap. We find critical points whose properties are consistent with\nrandom-field Ising universality. We analyse the interfacial free energy cost\nbetween the high- and low-overlap states that coexist at (and below) the\ncritical point, and we use this cost as the basis for a finite-size scaling\nanalysis. We discuss these results in the context of mean-field and dynamical\nfacilitation theories of the glass transition.\n", "  A new generalization of the Hawking-Hayward quasilocal energy to\nscalar-tensor gravity is proposed without assuming symmetries, asymptotic\nflatness, or special spacetime metrics. The procedure followed is simple but\npowerful and consists of writing the scalar-tensor field equations as effective\nEinstein equations and then applying the standard definition of quasilocal\nmass.\n", "  We show here that an extension of the Hamiltonian theory developed by us over\nthe years furnishes a composite fermion (CF) description of the $\\nu\n=\\frac{1}{2}$ state that is particle-hole (PH) symmetric, has a charge density\nthat obeys the magnetic translation algebra of the lowest Landau level (LLL),\nand exhibits cherished ideas from highly successful wave functions, such as a\nneutral quasi-particle with a certain dipole moment related to its momentum. We\nalso a provide an extension away from $\\nu=\\frac{1}{2}$ which has the features\nfrom $\\nu=\\frac{1}{2}$ and implements the the PH transformation on the LLL as\nan anti-unitary operator ${\\cal T}$ with ${\\cal T}^2=-1$. This extension of our\npast work was inspired by Son, who showed that the CF may be viewed as a Dirac\nfermion on which the particle-hole transformation of LLL electrons is realized\nas time-reversal, and Wang and Senthil who provided a very attractive\ninterpretation of the CF as the bound state of a semion and anti-semion of\ncharge $\\pm {e\\over 2}$. Along the way we also found a representation with all\nthe features listed above except that now ${\\cal T}^2=+1$. We suspect it\ncorresponds to an emergent charge-conjugation symmetry of the $\\nu =1$ boson\nproblem analyzed by Read.\n", "  One-dimensional multi-component Fermi or Bose systems with strong zero-range\ninteractions can be described in terms of local exchange coefficients and\nmapping the problem into a spin model is thus possible. For arbitrary external\nconfining potentials the local exchanges are given by highly non-trivial\ngeometric factors that depend solely on the geometry of the confinement through\nthe single-particle eigenstates of the external potential. To obtain accurate\neffective Hamiltonians to describe such systems one needs to be able to compute\nthese geometric factors with high precision which is difficult due to the\ncomputational complexity of the high-dimensional integrals involved. An\napproach using the local density approximation would therefore be a most\nwelcome approximation due to its simplicity. Here we assess the accuracy of the\nlocal density approximation by going beyond the simple harmonic oscillator that\nhas been the focus of previous studies and consider some double-wells of\ncurrent experimental interest. We find that the local density approximation\nworks quite well as long as the potentials resemble harmonic wells but break\ndown for larger barriers. In order to explore the consequences of applying the\nlocal density approximation in a concrete setup we consider quantum state\ntransfer in the effective spin models that one obtains. Here we find that even\nminute deviations in the local exchange coefficients between the exact and the\nlocal density approximation can induce large deviations in the fidelity of\nstate transfer for four, five, and six particles.\n", "  Several lifetimes in 23Mg have been determined for the first time using the\nDoppler-shift attenuation method. A Monte Carlo simulation code has been\nwritten to model the gamma-ray line shape. An upper limit of 12 fs at the 95%\nC.L. has been obtained for the astrophysically important 7787 keV state.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the anatomy of frequency-domain gravitational-wave\nsignals from non-precessing black-hole coalescences with the goal of\nconstructing accurate phenomenological waveform models. We first present new\nnumerical-relativity simulations for mass ratios up to 18 including spins. From\na comparison of different post-Newtonian approximants with numerical-relativity\ndata we select the uncalibrated SEOBNRv2 model as the most appropriate for the\npurpose of constructing hybrid post-Newtonian/numerical-relativity waveforms,\nand we discuss how we prepare time-domain and frequency-domain hybrid data\nsets. We then use our data together with results in the literature to calibrate\nsimple explicit expressions for the final spin and radiated energy. Equipped\nwith our prediction for the final state we then develop a simple and accurate\nmerger-ringdown-model based on modified Lorentzians in the gravitational wave\namplitude and phase, and we discuss a simple method to represent the low\nfrequency signal augmenting the TaylorF2 post-Newtonian approximant with terms\ncorresponding to higher orders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We finally\ndiscuss different options for modelling the small intermediate frequency regime\nbetween inspiral and merger-ringdown. A complete phenomenological model based\non the present work is presented in a companion paper.\n", "  We present a new frequency-domain phenomenological model of the\ngravitational-wave signal from the inspiral, merger and ringdown of\nnon-precessing (aligned-spin) black-hole binaries. The model is calibrated to\n19 hybrid effective-one-body--numerical-relativity waveforms up to mass ratios\nof 1:18 and black-hole spins of $|a/m| \\sim 0.85$ ($0.98$ for equal-mass\nsystems). The inspiral part of the model consists of an extension of\nfrequency-domain post-Newtonian expressions, using higher-order terms fit to\nthe hybrids. The merger-ringdown is based on a phenomenological ansatz that has\nbeen significantly improved over previous models. The model exhibits mismatches\nof typically less than 1\\% against all 19 calibration hybrids, and an\nadditional 29 verification hybrids, which provide strong evidence that, over\nthe calibration region, the model is sufficiently accurate for all relevant\ngravitational-wave astronomy applications with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo\ndetectors. Beyond the calibration region the model produces physically\nreasonable results, although we recommend caution in assuming that \\emph{any}\nmerger-ringdown waveform model is accurate outside its calibration region. As\nan example, we note that an alternative non-precessing model, SEOBNRv2\n(calibrated up to spins of only 0.5 for unequal-mass systems), exhibits\nmismatch errors of up to 10\\% for high spins outside its calibration region. We\nconclude that waveform models would benefit most from a larger number of\nnumerical-relativity simulations of high-aligned-spin unequal-mass binaries.\n", "  Observation of non-zero neutrino masses at a scale $\\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2}$\neV is a major problem in the otherwise highly successful Standard Model. The\nmost elegant mechanism to explain such tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw\nmechanism with right handed neutrinos. However, the required seesaw scale is so\nhigh, $\\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, it will not have any collider implications. Recently,\nan explicit model has been constructed to realize the seesaw mechanism with the\nright handed neutrinos at the electroweak scale. The model has a mirror\nsymmetry having both the left and right lepton and quark doublets and singlets\nfor the same $SU(2)_W $ gauge symmetry. Additional Higgs multiplets have been\nintroduced to realize this scenario. It turns out that these extra Higgs fields\nalso help to satisfy the precision electroweak tests, and other observables.\nBecause the scale of the symmetry breaking is electroweak, both the mirror\nquark and mirror leptons have masses in the electroweak scale in the range $\n\\sim 150 - 800 $ GeV. The mirror quarks / leptons decay to ordinary quarks\n/leptons plus very light neutral scalars. In this work, we calculate the final\nstate signals arising from the pair productions of these mirror quarks and\ntheir subsequent decays. We find that these signals are well observable over\nthe Standard Model background for $13$ TeV LHC. Depending on the associated\nYukawa couplings, these decays can also give rise displaced vertices with long\ndecay length, very different from the usual displaced vertices associated with\nb decays.\n", "  Positioned between crystalline solids and liquids, disordered many-particle\nsystems which are stealthy and hyperuniform represent new states of matter that\nare endowed with novel physical and thermodynamic properties. Such stealthy and\nhyperuniform states are unique in that they are transparent to radiation for a\nrange of wavenumbers around the origin. In this work, we employ recently\ndeveloped inverse statistical-mechanical methods, which seek to obtain the\noptimal set of interactions that will spontaneously produce a targeted\nstructure or configuration as a unique ground state, to investigate the\nspin-spin interaction potentials required to stabilize disordered stealthy\nhyperuniform one-dimensional (1D) Ising-like spin chains. By performing an\nexhaustive search over the spin configurations that can be enumerated on\nperiodic 1D integer lattices containing $N=2,3,\\ldots,36$ sites, we were able\nto identify and structurally characterize \\textit{all} stealthy hyperuniform\nspin chains in this range of system sizes. Within this pool of stealthy\nhyperuniform spin configurations, we then utilized such inverse optimization\ntechniques to demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform spin chains can be\nrealized as either unique or degenerate disordered ground states of radial\nlong-ranged (relative to the spin chain length) spin-spin interactions. Such\nexotic ground states are distinctly different from spin glasses in both their\ninherent structural properties and the nature of the spin-spin interactions\nrequired to stabilize them. As such, the implications and significance of the\nexistence of such disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground state spin systems\nwarrants further study, including whether their bulk physical properties and\nexcited states, like their many-particle system counterparts, are singularly\nremarkable, and can be experimentally realized.\n", "  We study the interplay between large-spin, spin-orbit coupling, and\nsuperfluidity for bosons in a two dimensional optical lattice, focusing on the\nspin-1 spin-orbit coupled system recently realized at the Joint Quantum\nInstitute [Campbell et. al., arXiv:1501.05984]. We find a rich quantum phase\ndiagram, where, in addition to the conventional phases ---superfluid and\ninsulator--- contained in the spin-$1$ Bose-Hubbard model, there are new\nlattice symmetry breaking phases. For weak interactions, the interplay between\ntwo length scales, the lattice momentum and the spin-orbit wave-vector induce a\nphase transition from a uniform superfluid to a phase where bosons\nsimultaneously condense at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone at a\nnon-zero spin-orbit strength. This state is characterized by spin density wave\norder, which arises from the spin-$1$ nature of the system. Interactions\nsuppress spin density wave order, and favor a superfluid \\textit{only} at the\nBrillouin zone edge. This state has spatially oscillating mean field order\nparameters, but a homogeneous density. We show that the spin density wave\nsuperfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus\nestablish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb,\n$^7$Li, and $^{41}$K.\n", "  A search for single top-quark production via flavour changing neutral current\nprocesses from gluon plus up- or charm--quark initial states in proton--proton\ncollisions at the LHC is presented. Data collected with the ATLAS detector in\n2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of $8\\;\\mbox{TeV}$ and corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $20.3\\;\\mbox{fb}^{-1}$ are used. Candidate events for\na top quark decaying into a lepton, a neutrino and a jet are selected and\nclassified into signal- and background-like candidates using a neural network.\nNo signal is observed and an upper limit on the production cross-section\nmultiplied by the $t \\rightarrow Wb$ branching fraction is set. The observed\n$95\\,\\%$ CL limit is $\\sigma_{qg \\rightarrow t} \\times B(t \\rightarrow Wb)<\n3.4\\;\\mbox{pb}$ and the expected $95\\,\\%$ CL limit is $\\sigma_{qg \\rightarrow\nt} \\times B(t \\rightarrow Wb)< 2.9\\;\\mbox{pb}$. The observed limit can be\ninterpreted as upper limits on the coupling constants of the flavour changing\nneutral current interactions divided by the scale of new physics\n$\\kappa_{ugt}/\\Lambda < 5.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\;\\mbox{TeV}^{-1}$ and\n$\\kappa_{cgt}/\\Lambda < 13 \\times 10^{-3}\\;\\mbox{TeV}^{-1}$ and on the\nbranching fractions $B(t \\rightarrow ug) < 4 \\times 10^{-5}$ and $B(t\n\\rightarrow cg) < 20 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n", "  Mono-$X$ signatures are a powerful collider probe of the nature of dark\nmatter. We show that mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ may be key signatures of\npseudo-scalar portal interactions between dark matter and the SM. We\ndemonstrate this using a simple renormalizable version of the portal, with a\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet-Model as electroweak symmetry breaking sector. Mono-$Z$ and\nmono-Higgs signatures in this scenario are of resonant type, which constitutes\na novel type of dark matter signature at LHC.\n", "  To draw inferences about gamma-ray burst (GRB) source populations based on\nSwift observations, it is essential to understand the detection efficiency of\nthe Swift burst alert telescope (BAT). This study considers the problem of\nmodeling the Swift/BAT triggering algorithm for long GRBs, a computationally\nexpensive procedure, and models it using machine learning algorithms. A large\nsample of simulated GRBs from Lien 2014 is used to train various models: random\nforests, boosted decision trees (with AdaBoost), support vector machines, and\nartificial neural networks. The best models have accuracies of $\\gtrsim97\\%$\n($\\lesssim 3\\%$ error), which is a significant improvement on a cut in GRB flux\nwhich has an accuracy of $89.6\\%$ ($10.4\\%$ error). These models are then used\nto measure the detection efficiency of Swift as a function of redshift $z$,\nwhich is used to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on the GRB rate\ndistribution. We find a local GRB rate density of $n_0 \\sim\n0.48^{+0.41}_{-0.23} \\ {\\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\\rm yr}^{-1}$ with power-law indices of\n$n_1 \\sim 1.7^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ and $n_2 \\sim -5.9^{+5.7}_{-0.1}$ for GRBs above\nand below a break point of $z_1 \\sim 6.8^{+2.8}_{-3.2}$. This methodology is\nable to improve upon earlier studies by more accurately modeling Swift\ndetection and using this for fully Bayesian model fitting. The code used in\nthis is analysis is publicly available online\n(https://github.com/PBGraff/SwiftGRB_PEanalysis).\n", "  Many-body eigenfunctions of the total spin operator can be constructed from\nthe spin and spatial wavefunctions with non-trivial permutation symmetries.\nSpin-dependent interactions can lead to relaxation of the spin eigenstates to\nthe thermal equilibrium. A mechanism that stabilizes the many-body entangled\nstates is proposed here. Surprisingly, in spite coupling with the chaotic\nmotion of the spatial degrees of freedom, the spin relaxation can be suppressed\nby destructive quantum interference due to spherical vector and tensor terms of\nthe spin-dependent interactions. Tuning the scattering lengths by the method of\nFeshbach resonances, readily available in cold atomic labs, can enhance the\nrelaxation timescales by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  Among Markovian processes, the hallmark of L\\'evy flights is superdiffusion,\nor faster-than-Brownian dynamics. Here we show that L\\'evy laws, as well as\nGaussians, can also be the limit distributions of processes with long range\nmemory that exhibit very slow diffusion, logarithmic in time. These processes\nare path-dependent and anomalous motion emerges from frequent relocations to\nalready visited sites. We show how the Central Limit Theorem is modified in\nthis context, keeping the usual distinction between analytic and non-analytic\ncharacteristic functions. A fluctuation-dissipation relation is also derived.\nOur results may have important applications in the study of animal and human\ndisplacements.\n", "  We study spacetimes that lead to a separable Klein-Gordon equation in a\ngeneral dimension. We introduce an ansatz for the metric in higher dimensions\nmotivated by analogical work by Carter in four dimensions and find solutions of\nthe Klein-Gordon equation. For such a metric we solve the Einstein equations\nand regain the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetime as one of our results. Other solutions\nlead to the Einstein-K\\\"ahler metric of a Euclidean signature. Next we\ninvestigate a warped geometry of two Klein-Gordon separable spaces with a\nproperly chosen warped factor. We show that the resulting metric leads also to\na separable Klein--Gordon equation and we find the corresponding solutions.\nFinally, we solve the Einstein equations for the warped geometry and obtain new\nsolutions.\n", "  The spectral properties of interacting strongly chaotic systems are\ninvestigated for growing interaction strength. A very sensitive transition from\nPoisson statistics to that of random matrix theory is found. We introduce a new\nrandom matrix ensemble modeling this dynamical symmetry breaking transition\nwhich turns out to be universal and depends on a single scaling parameter only.\nCoupled kicked rotors, a dynamical systems paradigm for such transitions, are\ncompared with this ensemble and excellent agreement is found for the\nnearest-neighbor-spacing distribution. It turns out that this transition is\ndescribed quite accurately using perturbation theory.\n", "  The effect of the photon emission (bremsstrahlung) in the cross section of\nthe process of direct production of the Higgs boson in the future high\nluminosity electron and muon colliders is calculated. It was found that cross\nsection at the top of the Higgs boson resonance peak is reduced by factor 0.347\nfor the electron collider and 0.548 for the muon collider. Machine spread of\nthe centre of the mass energy of 4.2MeV (equal to the Higgs width) would reduce\npeak cross section further, by factor 0.170 and 0.256 (QED and energy spread)\nfor electron and muon beams respectively. Possible uncertainties in the\nresummed QED calculations are discussed. Numerical results for the lineshape\ncross section including QED and many values of the machine energy spread are\nprovided.\n", "  Using a generalized random recurrent neural network model, and by extending\nour recently developed mean-field approach [J. Aljadeff, M. Stern, T. Sharpee,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 114, 088101 (2015)], we study the relationship between the\nnetwork connectivity structure and its low dimensional dynamics. Each\nconnection in the network is a random number with mean 0 and variance that\ndepends on pre- and post-synaptic neurons through a sufficiently smooth\nfunction $g$ of their identities. We find that these networks undergo a phase\ntransition from a silent to a chaotic state at a critical point we derive as a\nfunction of $g$. Above the critical point, although unit activation levels are\nchaotic, their autocorrelation functions are restricted to a low dimensional\nsubspace. This provides a direct link between the network's structure and some\nof its functional characteristics. We discuss example applications of the\ngeneral results to neuroscience where we derive the support of the spectrum of\nconnectivity matrices with heterogeneous and possibly correlated degree\ndistributions, and to ecology where we study the stability of the cascade model\nfor food web structure.\n", "  We show that a two-dimensional topological superconductor (TSC) can be\nrealized in a hybrid system with a conventional $s$-wave superconductor\nproximity-coupled to a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state from the Rashba and\nexchange effects in single layer graphene. With very low or even zero doping\nnear the Dirac points, i.e., two inequivalent valleys, this TSC has a Chern\nnumber as large as four, which supports four Majorana edge modes. More\nimportantly, we show that this TSC has a robust topologically nontrivial bulk\nexcitation gap, which can be larger or even one order of magnitude larger than\nthe proximity-induced superconducting gap. This unique property paves a way for\nthe application of QAH insulators as seed materials to realize robust TSCs and\nMajorana modes.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied non stationary dust spherically symmetric\nspacetime, in general covariant theory ($U(1)$ extension) of the\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with the minimally coupling and non-minimum\ncoupling with matter, in the post-newtonian approximation (PPN) in the infrared\nlimit. The Newtonian prepotential $\\varphi$ was assumed null. The aim of this\nwork is to know if we can have the same spacetime, as we know in the General\nRelativity Theory (GRT), in Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Theory (HLT) in this limit. We\nhave shown that there is not an analogy of the dust solution in HLT with the\nminimally coupling, as in GRT.\n  Using non-minimum coupling with matter, we have shown that the solution\nadmits a process of gravitational collapse, leaving a singularity at the end.\nThis solution has, qualitatively, the same temporal behaviour as the dust\ncollapse in GRT. However, we have also found a second possible solution,\nrepresenting a bounce behavior that is not found in GRT.\n", "  Excitonic couplings between (bacterio)chlorophyll molecules are necessary for\nsimulating energy transport in photosynthetic complexes. Many techniques for\ncalculating the couplings are in use, from the simple (but inaccurate)\npoint-dipole approximation to fully quantum-chemical methods. We compared\nseveral approximations to determine their range of applicability, noting that\nthe propagation of experimental uncertainties poses a fundamental limit on the\nachievable accuracy. In particular, the uncertainty in crystallographic\ncoordinates yields an uncertainty of about 20% in the calculated couplings.\nBecause quantum-chemical corrections are smaller than 20% in most biologically\nrelevant cases, their considerable computational cost is rarely justified. We\ntherefore recommend the electrostatic TrEsp method across the entire range of\nmolecular separations and orientations because its cost is minimal and it\ngenerally agrees with quantum-chemical calculations to better than the\ngeometric uncertainty. We also caution against computationally optimizing a\ncrystal structure before calculating couplings, as it can lead to large,\nuncontrollable errors. Understanding the unavoidable uncertainties can guard\nagainst striving for unrealistic precision; at the same time, detailed\nbenchmarks can allow important qualitative questions--which do not depend on\nthe precise values of the simulation parameters--to be addressed with greater\nconfidence about the conclusions.\n", "  A large area ring-imaging Cherenkov detector has been designed to provide\nclean hadron identification capability in the momentum range from 3 GeV/c up to\n8 GeV/c for the CLAS12 experiments at the upgraded 12 GeV continuous electron\nbeam accelerator facility of Jefferson Laboratory. The adopted solution\nforesees a novel hybrid optics design based on aerogel radiator, composite\nmirrors and high-packed and high-segmented photon detectors. Cherenkov light\nwill either be imaged directly (forward tracks) or after two mirror reflections\n(large angle tracks). We report here the results of the tests of a large scale\nprototype of the RICH detector performed with the hadron beam of the CERN T9\nexperimental hall for the direct detection configuration. The tests\ndemonstrated that the proposed design provides the required pion-to-kaon\nrejection factor of 1:500 in the whole momentum range.\n", "  We calculate the genuine long-range multi-particle rapidity correlation\nfunctions, $C_{n}(y_1,...,y_n)$ for $n=3,4,5,6$, originating from fluctuations\nof the fireball longitudinal shape. In these correlation functions any\ncontribution from the short-range two-particle correlations, and in general up\nto $(n-1)$-particle in $C_n$, is suppressed. The information about the\nfluctuating fireball shape in rapidity is encoded in the cumulants of\ncoefficients of the orthogonal polynomial expansion of particle distributions\nin rapidity.\n", "  The so-called star-forming main sequence of galaxies is the apparent tight\nrelationship between the star formation rate and stellar mass of a galaxy.\nPrevious studies exclude galaxies which are not strictly 'star forming' from\nthe main sequence, because they do not lie on the same tight relation. Using\nlocal galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we have classified galaxies\naccording to their emission line ratios, and studied their location on the star\nformation rate - stellar mass plane. We find that galaxies form a sequence from\nthe `blue cloud' galaxies which are actively forming stars, through a\ncombination of composite, Seyfert, and LINER (Low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line region) galaxies, ending as 'red-and-dead' galaxies. The sequence\nsupports an evolutionary pathway for galaxies in which star formation quenching\nby active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a key role.\n", "  We explore theoretically how to tune the dynamics of a quasi one-dimensional\nharmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) due to an additional red-\nand blue-detuned Hermite-Gaussian dimple trap (HGdT). To this end we study a\nBEC in a highly non-equilibrium state, which is not possible in a traditional\nharmonically confined trap. Our system is modeled by a time-dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, which is numerically solved by the Crank-Nicolson\nmethod in both imaginary and real time. For equilibrium, we obtain a condensate\nwith two bumps/dips which are induced by the chosen TEM$_{01}$ mode for the\nred/blue-detuned HGdT, respectively. Afterwards, in time-of-flight dynamics, we\nexamine the adherence/decay of the two bumps/dips in the condensate, which are\ninduced by the still present red/blue-detuned HGdT, respectively. On the other\nhand, once the red/blue HGdT potential is switched off, shock-waves or\nbi-trains of gray/dark pair-solitons are created. During this process it is\nfound that the generation of gray/dark pair-solitons bi-trains are generic\nphenomena of collisions of moderately/fully fragmented BEC. Additionally, it\nturns out that the special shape of generated solitons in the harmonically\ntrapped BEC firmly depends upon the geometry of the HGdT.\n", "  We study Klein tunneling in polariton graphene. We show that the photonic\nspin-orbit coupling associated with the energy splitting between TE and TM\nphotonic modes can be described as an emergent gauge field. It suppresses the\nKlein tunnelling in small energy range close to the Dirac points. Thanks to\npolariton spin-anisotropic interactions, polarized optical pumping allows to\ncreate potential barriers acting on a single polariton spin. We show that the\nresulting spin-dependent Klein tunneling can be used to create a perfectly\ntransmitting polarization rotator operating at microscopic scale.\n", "  The ground states of the frustrated pyrochlore oxide\nTb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$, sensitively depending on the small\noff-stoichiometry parameter $x$, have been studied by specific heat\nmeasurements using well characterized samples. Single crystal\nTb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ boules grown by the standard floating zone\ntechnique are shown to exhibit concentration ($x$) gradient. This\noff-stoichiometry parameter is determined by precisely measuring the lattice\nconstant of small samples cut from a crystal boule. Specific heat shows that\nthe phase boundary of the electric quadrupolar state has a dome structure in\nthe $x$-$T$ phase diagram with the highest $T_{\\text{c}} \\simeq 0.5$ K at about\n$x = 0.01$. This phase diagram suggests that the putative U(1) quantum\nspin-liquid state of Tb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ exists in the range\n$x<x_{\\text{c}} \\simeq -0.0025 $, which is separated from the quadrupolar state\nvia a first-order phase-transition line $x=x_{\\text{c}}$.\n", "  Random walks, and in particular, their first passage times, are ubiquitous in\nnature. Using direct enumeration of paths, we find the first return time\ndistribution of a 1D random walker, which is a heavy-tailed distribution with\ninfinite mean. Using the same method we find the last return time distribution,\nwhich follows the arcsine law. Both results have a broad range of applications\nin physics and other disciplines. The derivation presented here is readily\naccessible to physics undergraduates, and provides an elementary introduction\ninto random walks and their intriguing properties.\n", "  The optical properties of LiFeAs with $T_c \\simeq$ 18 K have been determined\nin the normal and superconducting states. The superposition of two Drude\ncomponents yields a good description of the low-frequency optical response in\nthe normal state. Below $T_c$, the optical conductivity reveals two isotropic\nsuperconducting gaps with $\\Delta_{1} \\simeq 2.9$ $\\pm$ 0.2 meV and $\\Delta_{2}\n\\simeq 5.5$ $\\pm$ 0.4 meV. A comparison between the superconducting-state\nMattis-Bardeen and the normal-state Drude components, in combination with a\nspectral weight analysis, indicates that the spectral weight associated with a\nband which has a very small scattering rate is fully transferred to the\nsuperfluid weight upon the superconducting condensate. These observations\nprovide clear evidence for the coexistence of clean- and dirty-limit\nsuperconductivity in LiFeAs.\n", "  We study theoretically potential advantages of two-component mixtures in\noptical lattices with state-dependent tunneling for approaching\nlong-range-order phases and detecting easy-axis antiferromagnetic correlations.\nWhile we do not find additional advantages of mixtures with large hopping\nimbalance for approaching quantum magnetism in a harmonic trap, it is shown\nthat a nonzero difference in hopping amplitudes remains highly important for a\nproper symmetry breaking in the pseudospin space for the single-site-resolution\nimaging and can be advantageously used for a significant increase of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and thus detecting long-range easy-axis antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations in the corresponding experiments.\n", "  We describe how to obtain the imprimitivity bimodules of the noncommutative\ntorus from a \"principal bundle\" construction, where the total space is a\nquasi-associative deformation of a 3-dimensional Heisenberg manifold.\n", "  Spatial adiabatic passage processes for ultracold atoms trapped in\ntunnel-coupled cylindrically symmetric concentric potentials are investigated.\nSpecifically, we discuss the matter-wave analogue of the rapid adiabatic\npassage (RAP) technique for a high fidelity and robust loading of a single atom\ninto a harmonic ring potential from a harmonic trap, and for its transport\nbetween two concentric rings. We also consider a system of three concentric\nrings and investigate the transport of a single atom between the innermost and\nthe outermost rings making use of the matter-wave analogue of the stimulated\nRaman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique. We describe the RAP-like and\nSTIRAP-like dynamics by means of a two- and a three-state models, respectively,\nobtaining good agreement with the numerical simulations of the corresponding\ntwo-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We introduce partially-parity-time-symmetric (pPT-symmetric) azimuthal\npotentials composed from individual PT-symmetric cells located on a ring, where\ntwo azimuthal directions are nonequivalent in a sense that in such potentials\nexcitations carrying topological dislo-cations exhibit different dynamics for\ndifferent directions of energy circulation in the initial field distribution.\nSuch non-conservative ratchet-like structures support rich families of stable\nvortex solitons in cubic nonlinear media, whose properties depend on the sign\nof the topological charge due to the nonequivalence of azimuthal directions. In\ncontrast, oppositely charged vortex solitons remain equivalent in similar fully\nPT-symmetric potentials. The vortex solitons in the pPT- and PT-symmetric\npotentials are shown to feature qualitatively different internal current\ndistributions, which are described by different discrete rotation symmetries of\nthe intensity profiles.\n", "  The ATLAS Collaboration has reported excesses in the search for resonant\ndiboson production with decay modes to hadronic final states at a diboson\ninvariant mass around 2 TeV in boosted jets from $WZ$, $W^+W^-$, and $ZZ$\nchannels. Given potential contamination, we investigate the anomalies in\nleptophobic $U(1)_{\\rm LP}$ models. We show that leptophobic models can be\nconstructed in flipped $SU(5)\\times U(1)_X$ models from free fermionic string\nconstructions and Pati-Salam models from D-brane constructions. Additionally,\nwe perform a collider phenomenological analysis to study production cross\nsections for $pp \\to Z' \\to jj/t \\bar{t}/WW/Zh$ and discover the excess can be\ninterpreted in both the leptophobic flipped $SU(5)\\times U(1)_X$ models and\nintersecting D-branes.\n", "  In a previous paper, we presented conjectures of the recurrence relations\nwith constant coefficients for the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of\nLaguerre, Jacobi, Wilson and Askey-Wilson types. In this paper we present a\nproof for the Laguerre and Jacobi cases. Their bispectral properties are also\ndiscussed, which give a method to obtain the coefficients of the recurrence\nrelations explicitly. This paper extends to the Laguerre and Jacobi cases the\nbispectral techniques recently introduced by G\\'omez-Ullate et al. to derive\nexplicit expressions for the coefficients of the recurrence relations satisfied\nby exceptional polynomials of Hermite type.\n", "  We analyze time evolution of a spherically symmetric collapsing matter from a\npoint of view that black holes evaporate by nature. We first consider a\nspherical thin shell that falls in the metric of an evaporating Schwarzschild\nblack hole of which the radius $a(t)$ decreases in time. The important point is\nthat the shell can never reach $a(t)$ but it approaches $a(t)-a(t)\\frac{d\na(t)}{d t}$. This situation holds at any radius because the motion of a shell\nin a spherically symmetric system is not affected by the outside. In this way,\nwe find that the collapsing matter evaporates without forming a horizon.\nNevertheless, a Hawking-like radiation is created in the metric, and the object\nlooks the same as a conventional black hole from the outside. We then discuss\nhow the information of the matter is recovered. We also consider a black hole\nthat is adiabatically grown in the heat bath and obtain the interior metric. We\nshow that it is the self-consistent solution of $G_{\\mu\\nu}=8\\pi G \\langle\nT_{\\mu\\nu} \\rangle$ and that the four-dimensional Weyl anomaly induces the\nradiation and a strong angular pressure. Finally, we analyze the internal\nstructures of the charged and the slowly rotating black holes.\n", "  The alignment of interstellar dust grains with magnetic fields provides a key\nmethod for measuring the strength and morphology of the fields. In turn, this\nprovides a means to study the role of magnetic fields from diffuse gas to dense\nstar-forming regions. The physical mechanism for aligning the grains has been a\nlong-term subject of study and debate. The theory of radiative torques, in\nwhich an anisotropic radiation field imparts sufficient torques to align the\ngrains while simultaneously spinning them to high rotational velocities, has\npassed a number of observational tests. Here we use archival polarization data\nin dense regions of the Orion molecular cloud (OMC-1) at 100, 350, and\n$850\\,\\mu$m to test the prediction that the alignment efficiency is dependent\nupon the relative orientations of the magnetic field and radiation anisotropy.\nWe find that the expected polarization signal, with a 180-degree period, exists\nat all wavelengths out to radii of 1.5 arcminutes centered on the BNKL object\nin OMC-1. The probabilities that these signals would occur due to random noise\nare low ($\\lesssim$1\\%), and are lowest towards BNKL compared to the rest of\nthe cloud. Additionally, the relative magnetic field to radiation anisotropy\ndirections accord with theoretical predictions in that they agree to better\nthan 15 degrees at $100\\,\\mu$m and 4 degrees at $350\\,\\mu$m.\n", "  The possibility to construct an inflationary scenario for\nrenormalization-group improved potentials corresponding to the Higgs sector of\nfinite gauge models is investigated. Taking into account quantum corrections to\nthe renormalization-group potential which sums all leading logs of perturbation\ntheory is essential for a successful realization of the inflationary scenario,\nwith very reasonable parameter values. The inflationary models thus obtained\nare seen to be in good agreement with the most recent and accurate\nobservational data. More specifically, the values of the relevant inflationary\nparameters, $n_s$ and $r$, are close to the corresponding ones in the $R^2$ and\nHiggs-driven inflation scenarios. It is shown that the model here constructed\nand Higgs-driven inflation belong to the same class of cosmological attractors.\n", "  The implementation of a functional quantum computer involves entangling and\ncoherent manipulation of a large number of qubits. For qubits based on electron\nspins confined in quantum dots, which are among the most investigated\nsolid-state qubits at present, architectural challenges are often encountered\nin the design of quantum circuits attempting to assemble the qubits within the\nvery limited space available. Here, we provide a solution to such challenges\nbased on an approach to realizing entanglement of spin qubits over long\ndistances. We show that long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction of\nconfined electron spins can be established by quantum Hall edge states, leading\nto an exchange coupling of spin qubits. The coupling is anisotropic and can be\neither Ising-type or XY-type, depending on the spin polarization of the edge\nstate. Such a property, combined with the dependence of the electron spin\nsusceptibility on the chirality of the edge state, can be utilized to gain\nvaluable insights into the topological nature of various quantum Hall states.\n", "  We study the Quantum Measurement Process in a Stern-Gerlach setup with the\nspin of a silver atom as the quantum system and the position as the apparatus.\nThe system and the apparatus are treated quantum-mechanically using unitary\nevolution. The new ingredient in our analysis is the idea that the probes\ndetermining the position of the silver atom are limited in resolution. We show\nusing a Wigner matrix that due to the coarseness of the detection process, the\npure density matrix appears to evolve to an impure one. We quantify the\ninformation gained about the spin in a coarse position measurement.\n", "  We present a complete description of top quark pair production in association\nwith a jet in the dilepton channel. Our calculation is accurate to\nnext-to-leading order in QCD (NLO) and includes all non-resonant diagrams,\ninterferences and off-shell effects of the top quark. Moreover, non-resonant\nand off-shell effects due to the finite W gauge boson width are taken into\naccount. This calculation constitutes the first fully realistic NLO computation\nfor top quark pair production with a final state jet in hadronic collisions.\nNumerical results for differential distributions as well as total cross\nsections are presented for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at 8 TeV. With our\ninclusive cuts, NLO predictions reduce the unphysical scale dependence by more\nthan a factor of 3 and lower the total rate by about 13% compared to leading\norder QCD (LO) predictions. In addition, the size of the top quark off-shell\neffects is estimated to be below 2%.\n", "  The extrinsic dephasing of a hole spin confined to a self-assembled quantum\ndot is dominated by charge noise acting on an electric-field dependent\ng-factor. Here we propose the use of the optical Stark effect to reduce the\nsensitivity of the effective hole Zeeman energy to fluctuations in the local\nelectric-field. Calculations using measured quantum dot parameters are\npresented, and demonstrate a factor of 10-100 reduction in the extrinsic\ndephasing. Compared to active stabilization methods, this technique should\nbenefit from reduced experimental complexity.\n", "  Two major challenges in the development of optomechanical devices are\nachieving a low mechanical and optical loss rate and vibration isolation from\nthe environment. We address both issues by fabricating trampoline resonators\nmade from low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) Si$_3$N$_4$ with a\ndistributed bragg reflector (DBR) mirror. We design a nested double resonator\nstructure with 80 dB of mechanical isolation from the mounting surface at the\ninner resonator frequency, and we demonstrate up to 45 dB of isolation at lower\nfrequencies in agreement with the design. We reliably fabricate devices with\nmechanical quality factors of around 400,000 at room temperature. In addition\nthese devices were used to form optical cavities with finesse up to 181,000\n$\\pm$ 1,000. These promising parameters will enable experiments in the quantum\nregime with macroscopic mechanical resonators.\n", "  We discuss non-perturbative corrections to the neutrino sector, in the\ncontext of a D-brane Pati-Salam-like model, that can be obtained as a simple\nalternative to $SO(10)$ GUT's in theories with open and unoriented strings. In\nsuch D-brane models, exotic stringy instantons can correct the right-handed\nneutrino mass matrix in a calculable way, thus affecting mass hierarchies and\nmodifying the see-saw mechanism to what we name exotic see-saw. For a wide\nrange of parameters, a compact spectrum of right-handed neutrino masses can\noccur that gives rise to a predictive scenario for low energy observables. This\nmodel also provides a viable mechanism for Baryon Asymmetry in the Universe\n(BAU) through leptogenesis. Finally, a Majorana mass for the neutron is\nnaturally predicted in the model, leading to potentially testable\nneutron-antineutron oscillations. Combined measurements in neutrino and\nneutron-antineutron sectors could provide precious informations on physics at\nthe quantum gravity scale.\n", "  This abstract will be modified after correcting the minor error in Eq.(2)\n", "  Considering two-dimensional electron gases under a perpendicular magnetic\nfield, we pinpoint a specific kind of long-range bipartite entanglement of the\nelectronic motions. This entanglement is achieved through the introduction of\nbicomplex spinorial eigenfunctions admitting a polar decomposition in terms of\na real modulus and three real phases. Within this bicomplex geometry the\ncyclotron motions of two electrons are intrinsically tied, so that the\nhighlighted eigenstates of the kinetic energy operator actually describe the\nfree motion of a genuine electron pair. Most remarkably, these states embody\nphase singularities in the four-dimensional (4D) space, with singular points\ncorresponding to the simultaneous undetermination of the three phases. Because\nthe entanglement between the two electrons forming a pair, as well as the\nwinding and parity quantum numbers characterizing the 4D phase singularity, are\ntopological in nature, we expect them to manifest some robustness in the\npresence of a smooth disorder potential and an electron-electron interaction\npotential. The relevance of this effective approach in terms of 4D vortices of\nelectron pairs is discussed in the context of the fractional quantum Hall\neffect.\n", "  We investigate direct and indirect constraints on the complete set of\nanomalous CP-violating Higgs couplings to quarks and gluons originating from\ndimension-6 operators, by studying their signatures at the LHC and in electric\ndipole moments (EDMs). We show that existing uncertainties in hadronic and\nnuclear matrix elements have a significant impact on the interpretation of EDM\nexperiments, and we quantify the improvements needed to fully exploit the power\nof EDM searches. Currently, the best bounds on the anomalous CP-violating Higgs\ninteractions come from a combination of EDM measurements and the data from LHC\nRun 1. We argue that Higgs production cross section and branching ratios\nmeasurements at the LHC Run 2 will not improve the constraints significantly.\nOn the other hand, the bounds on the couplings scale roughly linearly with EDM\nlimits, so that future theoretical and experimental EDM developments can have a\nmajor impact in pinning down interactions of the Higgs.\n", "  Tunneling Magnetoresistance between two ferrromagnets is an issue of\nfundamental importance in spintronics. In this work, we show that tunneling\nmagnetoresistance can also emerge in junctions composed of ferromagnets and\ntime-reversal invariant topological superconductors without spin-rotation\nsymmetry. Here the physical origin is that when the spin-polarization direction\nof injected electron from the ferromagnet lying in the same plane of the\nspin-polarization direction of Majorana zero modes, the electron will undergo a\nperfect spin-equal Andreev reflection, while injected electrons with other\nspin-polarization direction will be partially Andreev reflected and partially\nnormal reflected, which consequently have a lower conductance, and therefore,\nthe magnetoresistance effect emerges. Compared to conventional magnetic tunnel\njunctions, an unprecedented advantage of the junctions studied here is that\narbitrary high tunneling magnetoresistance can be obtained even the\nmagnetization of the ferromagnets are weak and the insulating tunneling\nbarriers are featureless. Our findings provide a new fascinating mechanism to\nobtain high tunneling magnetoresistance.\n", "  Measurements of the cross sections for top quark pairs produced in\nassociation with a W or Z boson are presented, using 8 TeV pp collision data\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse femtobarns, collected\nby the CMS experiment at the LHC. Final states are selected in which the\nassociated W boson decays to a charged lepton and a neutrino or the Z boson\ndecays to two charged leptons. Signal events are identified by matching\nreconstructed objects in the detector to specific final state particles from\nttW or ttZ decays. The ttW cross section is measured to be 382 +117 -102 fb\nwith a significance of 4.8 standard deviations from the background-only\nhypothesis. The ttZ cross section is measured to be 242 +65 -55 fb with a\nsignificance of 6.4 standard deviations from the background-only hypothesis.\nThese measurements are used to set bounds on five anomalous dimension-six\noperators that would affect the ttW and ttZ cross sections.\n", "  A resonant-state expansion (RSE) for open optical systems with a general\nfrequency dispersion of the relative permittivity, described by a finite number\nof simple poles, is presented. As in the non-dispersive case, the RSE of\ndispersive systems converts Maxwell's wave equation into a linear matrix\neigenvalue problem in the basis of unperturbed resonant states, in this way\nnumerically exactly determining all relevant eigenmodes of the optical system.\nThis dispersive RSE is verified by application to the analytically solvable\nsystem of a sphere in vacuum, with a dispersion of the dielectric constant\ndescribed by the Drude and Drude-Lorentz models. We calculate the change of the\noptical modes when converting the sphere material from gold to non-dispersive\nsilica and back to gold, and evaluate the accuracy using the exact solutions.\n", "  We identify a nontrivial 4-state Landau-Zener model for which transition\nprobabilities between any pair of diabatic states can be determined\nanalytically and exactly. The model describes an experimentally accessible\nsystem of two interacting qubits, such as a localized state in a Dirac material\nwith both valley and spin degrees of freedom or a singly charged quantum dot\n(QD) molecule with spin orbit coupling. Application of the linearly\ntime-dependent magnetic field induces a sequence of quantum level crossings\nwith possibility of interference of different trajectories in a semiclassical\npicture. We argue that this system satisfies the criteria of integrability in\nthe multistate Landau-Zener theory, which allows us to derive explicit exact\nanalytical expressions for the transition probability matrix. We also argue\nthat this model is likely a special case of a larger class of solvable systems,\nand present a 6-state generalization as an example.\n", "  Background: The advent of new dedicated experimental programs on hyperon\nphysics is rapidly boosting the field, and the possibility of synthetizing\nmultiple strange hypernuclei requires the addition of the strangeness degree of\nfreedom to the models dedicated to nuclear structure and nuclear matter studies\nat low energy.\n  Purpose: We want to settle the influence of strangeness on the nuclear\nliquid-gas phase transition. Because of the large uncertainties concerning the\nhyperon sector, we do not aim at a quantitative estimation of the phase diagram\nbut rather at a qualitative description of the phenomenology, as model\nindependent as possible.\n  Method: We analyze the phase diagram of low density matter composed of\nneutrons, protons and $\\Lambda$ hyperons using a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)\nmodel. We largely explore the parameter space to pin down generic features of\nthe phase transition, and compare the results to ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations.\n  Results: We show that the liquid-gas phase transition is only slightly\nquenched by the addition of hyperons. Strangeness is seen to be an order\nparameter of the phase transition, meaning that dilute strange matter is\nexpected to be unstable with respect to the formation of hyper-clusters.\n  Conclusions: More quantitative results within the RMF model need improved\nfunctionals at low density, possibly fitted to ab-initio calculations of\nnuclear and $\\Lambda$ matter.\n", "  Irradiation effects in close binaries are crucial for a reliable\ndetermination of system parameters and understanding the close binary\nevolution. We study irradiated light originating from the low mass component of\nan eclipsing system comprising a hot subdwarf primary and a low mass companion,\nto precisely interpret their high precision photometric and spectroscopic data,\nand accurately determine their system and surface parameters. We re-analyse the\narchival VLT/UVES spectra of AA Dor system where irradiation features have\nalready been detected. After removing the predominant contribution of the hot\nsubdwarf primary, the residual spectra reveal more than 100 emission lines from\nthe heated side of the secondary with maximum intensity close to the phases\naround secondary eclipse. We analyse 22 narrow emission lines of the irradiated\nsecondary, mainly of OII, with a few CII lines. Their phase profiles constrain\nthe emission region of the heated side to a radius $\\geq$ 95% of the radius of\nthe secondary. The shape of their velocity profiles reveals two distinct\nasymmetry features one at the quadrature and the other at the secondary\neclipse. We identify more than 70 weaker emission lines originating from HeI,\nNII, SiIII, CaII and MgII. We correct the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the\ncenter-of-light to the centre-of-mass of the secondary and calculate accurate\nmasses of both components. The resulting masses $M_{1}$=0.46 $\\pm$\n0.01$M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{2}$=0.079 $\\pm$ 0.002$M_{\\odot}$ are in perfect\naccordance with those of a canonical hot subdwarf primary and a low mass star\njust at the substellar limit for the companion. We compute a first generation\natmosphere model of the irradiated low mass secondary, which matches the\nobserved spectrum well. We find an indication of an extended atmosphere of the\nirradiated secondary star.\n", "  We present a theory of magnetotransport phenomena related to the chiral\nanomaly in Weyl semimetals. We show that conductivity, thermal conductivity,\nthermoelectric and the sound absorption coefficients exhibit strong and\nanisotropic magnetic field dependences. We also discuss properties of\nmagneto-plasmons and magneto-polaritons, whose existence is entirely determined\nby the chiral anomaly. Finally, we discuss the conditions of applicability of\nthe quasi-classical description of electron transport phenomena related to the\nchiral anomaly.\n", "  71Ga NQR, magnetization and specific heat measurements have been performed on\npolycrystalline Ge doped FeGa3 samples. A crossover from an insulator to a\ncorrelated local moment metal in the low doping regime and the evolution of\nitinerant ferromagnet upon further doping is found. For the nearly critical\nconcentration at the threshold of ferromagnetic order, xC=0.15, (1/T1T)\nexhibits a pronounced T4/3 power law over two orders of magnitude in\ntemperature which indicates 3D quantum critical ferromagnetic fluctuations.\nFurthermore, for the ordered x = 0.2 sample (TC = 6 K) 1/T1T could be fitted\nwell in the frame of Moriya's SCR theory for weakly FM systems with 1/T1T\nproportional to chi. In contrast to this, the low doping regime nicely displays\nlocal moment behavior where 1/T1T proportional to chi2 is valid. For\ntemperature tending to zero the Sommerfeld ratio = (C/T) is enhanced (70\nmJ/mole-K2 for x = 0.1) which indicates the formation of heavy 3d-electrons.\n", "  We show that simplified models used to describe the interactions of dark\nmatter with Standard Model particles do not in general respect gauge invariance\nand that perturbative unitarity may be violated in large regions of the\nparameter space. The modifications necessary to cure these inconsistencies may\nimply a much richer phenomenology and lead to stringent constraints on the\nmodel. We illustrate these observations by considering the simplified model of\na fermionic dark matter particle and a vector mediator. Imposing gauge\ninvariance then leads to strong constraints from dilepton resonance searches\nand electroweak precision tests. Furthermore, the new states required to\nrestore perturbative unitarity can mix with Standard Model states and mediate\ninteractions between the dark and the visible sector, leading to new\nexperimental signatures such as invisible Higgs decays. The resulting\nconstraints are typically stronger than the 'classic' constraints on DM\nsimplified models such as monojet searches and make it difficult to avoid\nthermal overproduction of dark matter.\n", "  We report an experimental realisation of Maxwell's demon in a photonic setup.\nWe show that a measurement at the single-photon level followed by a\nfeed-forward operation allows the extraction of work from intense thermal light\ninto an electric circuit. The interpretation of the experiment stimulates the\nderivation of a new equality relating work extraction to information acquired\nby measurement. We derive a bound using this relation and show that it is in\nagreement with the experimental results. Our work puts forward photonic systems\nas a platform for experiments related to information in thermodynamics.\n", "  We maintain that the wavefunction is an ensemble property rather than an\nindividual particle property. For individual particles, we propose an ontology\nunderwritten by the Heisenberg representation. It consists of properties\nrepresented by deterministic operators, which may have nonlocal dynamics.\nRelying on nonlocal dynamics, we show how interference phenomena can be\nunderstood without having to conceive of the quantum state as wave-like.\nNonlocal information is provided by a modular momentum operator. By augmenting\nthe individual particle ontology with a final state and employing weak\nmeasurements, we show how both interference and which-path can be deduced for\nthe same system. This situation is most intuitively understood through a\ntime-symmetric Heisenberg representation. Indeed, we contend that a\ntime-symmetric operator-based ontology captures the essence of quantum\nmechanics, particularly its nonlocal nature, better than any wavefunction-based\nontology.\n", "  We study one-dimensional strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures by both the\nexact Bethe-ansatz method and variational perturbation theory within the\ndegenerate ground state subspace of the system in the infinitely repulsive\nlimit. Based on the exact solution of the one-dimensional Bose-Fermi gas with\nequal boson-boson and boson-fermion interaction strengths, we demonstrate that\nthe ground state energy is degenerate for different Bose-Fermi configurations\nand the degeneracy is lifted when the interaction deviates the infinitely\ninteracting limit. We then show that the ground properties in the strongly\ninteracting regime can be well characterized by using the variational\nperturbation method within the degenerate ground state subspace, which can be\napplied to deal with more general cases with anisotropic interactions and in\nexternal traps. Our results indicate that the total ground-state density\nprofile in the strongly repulsive regime behaves like the polarized\nnoninteracting fermions, whereas the density distributions of bosons and\nfermions display different properties for different Bose-Fermi configurations\nand are sensitive to the anisotropy of interactions.\n", "  The isospin, spin and parity dependent potential of a pair of $B$ mesons is\ncomputed using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD with two flavours of degenerate\ndynamical quarks. The $B$ meson is addressed in the static-light approximation,\ni.e.\\ the $b$ quarks are infinitely heavy. From the results of the $B\\,B$\nmeson-meson potentials, a simple rule can be deduced stating which isospin,\nspin and parity combinations correspond to attractive and which to repulsive\nforces. We provide fits to the ground state potentials in the attractive\nchannels and discuss the potentials in the repulsive and excited channels. The\nattractive channels are most important since they can possibly lead to a bound\nfour-quark state, i.e.\\ a $\\bar{b}\\bar{b}ud$ tetraquark. Using these attractive\npotentials in the Schr\\\"odinger equation, we find indication for such a\ntetraquark state of two static bottom antiquarks and two light $u/d$ quarks\nwith mass extrapolated down to the physical value.\n", "  We present a pilot study of the z=2.923 radio galaxy MRC0943-242, where we\nfor the first time combine information from ALMA and MUSE data cubes. Even with\nmodest integration times, we disentangle an AGN and a starburst dominated set\nof components. These data reveal a highly complex morphology, as the AGN,\nstarburst, and molecular gas components show up as widely separated sources in\ndust continuum, optical continuum and CO line emission observations. CO(1-0)\nand CO(8-7) line emission suggest that there is a molecular gas reservoir\noffset from both the dust and the optical continuum that is located ~90kpc from\nthe AGN. The UV line emission has a complex structure in emission and\nabsorption. The line emission is mostly due to i) a large scale ionisation cone\nenergised by the AGN, ii) a Ly-alpha emitting bridge of gas between the radio\ngalaxy and a heavily star-forming set of components. Strangely, the ionisation\ncone has no Ly-alpha emission. We find this is due to an optically thick layer\nof neutral gas with unity covering fraction spread out over a region of at\nleast ~100kpc from the AGN. Other, less thick absorption components are\nassociated with Ly-alpha emitting gas within a few tens of kpc from the radio\ngalaxy and are connected by a bridge of emission. We speculate that this linear\nstructure of dust, Ly-alpha and CO emission, and the redshifted absorption seen\nin the circum-nuclear region may represent an accretion flow feeding gas into\nthis massive AGN host galaxy.\n", "  Scalar-tensor~(ST) theories of gravity are natural phenomenological\nextensions to general relativity. Although these theories are severely\nconstrained both by solar system experiments and by binary pulsar observations,\na large set of ST families remain consistent with these observations. Recent\nwork has suggested probing the unconstrained region of the parameter space of\nST theories based on the stability properties of highly compact neutron stars.\nHere, the dynamical evolution of very compact stars in a fully nonlinear code\ndemonstrates that the stars do become unstable and that the instability, in\nsome cases, drives the stars to collapse. We discuss the implications of these\nresults in light of recent observations of the most massive neutron star yet\nobserved. In particular, such observations suggest that such a star would be\nsubject to the instability for a certain regime; its existence therefore\nsupports a bound on the ST parameter space.\n", "  We propose a modified Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) scheme that uses\narbitrary-dimensional qudit probes and polynomially localized Hamiltonians. We\nfind that with an appropriate scaling of parameters, the teleported energy\nscales with the teleportation distance more favourably than the non-local tails\nof the Hamiltonians. We show that by allowing the exchange of arbitrary amounts\nof information between agents and in a suitable limit, an arbitrarily large\namount of energy can be teleported through a massless quantum field.\n", "  We propose a general method to analytically solve transport equations during\na cosmic phase transition without making approximations based on the assumption\nthat any transport coefficient is large. Using the MSSM as an example we derive\nthe solutions to a set of $3$ transport equations derived under the assumption\nof supergauge equilibrium and the diffusion approximation. The result is then\nrederived efficiently using a technique we present involving a parametrized\nansatz which turns the process of deriving a solution into an almost elementary\nproblem. We then show how both the derivation and the parametrized ansatz\ntechnique can be generalized to solve an arbitrary number of transport\nequations. Finally we derive a perturbative series that relaxes the usual\napproximation that inactivates VEV dependent relaxation and CP violating source\nterms at the bubble wall and through the symmetric phase.\n", "  In heavy-fermion superconductor Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_x$CoIn$_5$ system, Yb doping\nwas reported to cause a possible change from nodal $d$-wave superconductivity\nto a fully gapped $d$-wave molecular superfluid of composite pairs near $x\n\\approx$ 0.07 (nominal value $x_{nom}$ = 0.2). Here we present systematic\nthermal conductivity measurements on Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_x$CoIn$_5$ ($x$ = 0.013,\n0.084, and 0.163) single crystals. The observed finite residual linear term\n$\\kappa_0/T$ is insensitive to Yb doping, verifying the universal heat\nconduction of nodal $d$-wave superconducting gap in Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_x$CoIn$_5$.\nSimilar universal heat conduction is also observed in\nCeCo(In$_{1-y}$Cd$_y$)$_5$ system. These results reveal robust nodal $d$-wave\ngap in CeCoIn$_5$ upon Yb or Cd doping.\n", "  There is a deep tension between the well-developed theory of gravitational\nwaves from isolated systems and the presence of a positive cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$, however tiny. In particular, even the post-Newtonian\nquadrupole formula, derived by Einstein in 1918, has not been generalized to\ninclude a positive $\\Lambda$. We first explain the principal difficulties and\nthen show that it is possible to overcome them in the weak field limit. These\nresults also provide concrete hints for constructing the $\\Lambda >0$\ngeneralization of the Bondi-Sachs framework for full, non-linear general\nrelativity.\n", "  Mg is the alpha element of choice for Galactic population and chemical\nevolution studies as it is easily detectable in all late-type stars. Such\nstudies require precise elemental abundances, and thus departures from LTE need\nto be accounted for. Our goal is to provide reliable departure coefficients and\nequivalent widths in non-LTE, and for reference in LTE, for diagnostic lines of\nMg studied in late-type stars. These can be used e.g., to correct LTE spectra\nand abundances. Using the model atom built and tested in the preceding paper in\nthis series, we performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations in a grid of\n3945 stellar 1D atmospheric models. We used a sub-grid of 86 models to explore\nthe propagation of errors in the recent atomic collision calculations to the\nradiative transfer results. We obtained departure coefficients for all the\nlevels and equivalent widths (in LTE and non-LTE) for all the radiative\ntransitions included in the \"final\" model atom of Osorio et al.. We present and\ndescribe our results and show some examples of applications of the data. The\nerrors due to uncertainties in the collisional data are investigated and\ntabulated. The results for equivalent widths and departure coefficients are\nmade freely available. Giants tend to have negative abundance corrections while\ndwarfs have positive, though small, corrections. Error analysis results show\nthat uncertainties related to the atomic collision data are typically of order\n0.01 dex or less, although for few stellar models in specific lines\nuncertainties can be as large as 0.03 dex. As these errors are less than or of\nthe same order as typical corrections, we expect that we can use these results\nto extract Mg abundances from high quality spectra more reliably than from\nclassical LTE analysis.\n", "  We explain how to compute meson masses in the large $N$ limit using the\ntwisted Eguchi-Kawai model. A very simple formula is derived, and we show how\nit leads in a fast and efficient way to results which are in fairly good\nagreement with other determinations. The method is easily extensible to reduced\nmodels with dynamical fermions based on the twisted reduction idea.\n", "  We use the CARMA millimeter interferometer to map the Antennae Galaxies\n(NGC4038/39), tracing the bulk of the molecular gas via the 12CO(1-0) line and\ndenser molecular gas via the high density transitions HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0),\nCS(2-1), and HNC(1-0). We detect bright emission from all tracers in both the\ntwo nuclei and three locales in the overlap region between the two nuclei.\nThese three overlap region peaks correspond to previously identified\n\"supergiant molecular clouds\". We combine the CARMA data with Herschel infrared\n(IR) data to compare observational indicators of the star formation efficiency\n(SFR/H2~IR/CO), dense gas fraction (HCN/CO), and dense gas star formation\nefficiency (IR/HCN). Regions within the Antennae show ratios consistent with\nthose seen for entire galaxies, but these ratios vary by up to a factor of 6\nwithin the galaxy. The five detected regions vary strongly in both their\nintegrated intensities and these ratios. The northern nucleus is the brightest\nregion in mm-wave line emission, while the overlap region is the brightest part\nof the system in the IR. We combine the CARMA and Herschel data with ALMA CO\ndata to report line ratio patterns for each bright point. CO shows a declining\nspectral line energy distribution, consistent with previous studies. HCO+(1-0)\nemission is stronger than HCN(1-0) emission, perhaps indicating either more gas\nat moderate densities or higher optical depth than is commonly seen in more\nadvanced mergers.\n", "  The enrichment in s-process elements of barium stars is known to be due to\npollution by mass transfer from a companion formerly on the thermally-pulsing\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB), now a carbon-oxygen white-dwarf (WD). This paper\ninvestigates the relationship between the s-process enrichment in the barium\nstar and the mass of its WD companion. It is expected that helium WDs, which\nhave masses smaller than about 0.5 Msun and never reached the AGB phase, should\nnot pollute with s-process elements their giant companion, which should thus\nnever turn into a barium star. Spectra with a resolution of R ~ 86000 were\nobtained with the HERMES spectrograph on the 1.2-m Mercator telescope for a\nsample of 11 binary systems involving WD companions of various masses. We use\nstandard 1D LTE MARCS model atmospheres coupled with the Turbospectrum\nradiative-transfer code to derive the atmospheric parameters using equivalent\nwidths of FeI and Fe II lines. The abundances of s-process elements for the\nentire sample of 11 binary stars were derived homogeneously. The sample\nencompasses all levels of overabundances: from solar [s/Fe]=0 to 1.5 dex in the\n2 binary systems with S-star primaries (for which dedicated MARCS model\natmospheres were used). The primary components of binary systems with a WD more\nmassive than 0.5 Msun are enriched in s-process elements. We also found a trend\nof increasing [s/Fe] with [C/Fe] or [(C+N)/Fe]. Our results conform to the\nexpectation that binary systems with WD companions less massive than 0.5 Msun\ndo not host barium stars.\n", "  We present new accurate abundances for five neutron-capture (Y, La, Ce, Nd,\nEu) elements in 73 classical Cepheids located across the Galactic thin disk.\nIndividual abundances are based on high spectral resolution (R ~ 38,000) and\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~ 50-300) spectra collected with UVES at ESO\nVLT for the DIONYSOS project. Taking account for similar Cepheid abundances\nprovided either by our group (111 stars) or available in the literature, we end\nup with a sample of 435 Cepheids covering a broad range in iron abundances\n(-1.6 < [Fe/H] < 0.6). We found, using homogeneous individual distances and\nabundance scales, well defined gradients for the above elements. However, the\nslope of the light s-process element (Y) is at least a factor of two steeper\nthan the slopes of heavy s- (La, Ce, Nd) and r- (Eu) process elements. The s to\nr abundance ratio ([La/Eu]) of Cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelation\nwith of both Eu and Fe. On the other hand, Galactic field stars attain an\nalmost constant value and only when they approach solar iron abundance display\na mild enhancement in La. The [Y/Eu] ratio shows a mild evidence of a\ncorrelation with Eu and, in particular, with iron abundance for field Galactic\nstars. We also investigated the s-process index - [hs/ls] - and we found a well\ndefined anticorrelation, as expected, between [La/Y] and iron abundance.\nMoreover, we found a strong correlation between [La/Y] and [La/Fe] and, in\nparticular, a clear separation between Galactic and Sagittarius red giants.\nFinally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass asymptotic giant\nbranch stars and the observed [La/Y] ratio indicate a very good agreement over\nthe entire metallicity range covered by Cepheids. However, the observed spread,\nat fixed iron content, is larger than predicted by current models.\n", "  In this work we theoretically investigate a hybrid system of two\noptomechanically coupled resonators, which exhibits induced transparency. This\nis realized by coupling an optical ring resonator to a toroid. In the\nsemiclassical analyses, the system displays bistabilities, isolated branches\n(isolas) and self-sustained oscillation dynamics. Furthermore, we find that the\ninduced transparency transparency window sensitively relies on the mechanical\nmotion. Based on this fact, we show that the described system can be used as a\nweak force detector and the optimal sensitivity can beat the standard quantum\nlimit without using feedback control or squeezing under available experimental\nconditions.\n", "  Although QCD axion models are widely studied as solutions to the strong CP\nproblem, they generically confront severe fine-tuning problems to guarantee the\nanomalous PQ symmetry. In this letter, we propose a simple QCD axion model\nwithout any fine-tunings. We introduce an extra dimension and a pair of extra\nquarks living on two branes separately, which is also charged under a bulk\nAbelian gauge symmetry. We assume a monopole condensation on our brane at an\nintermediate scale, which implies that the extra quarks develop the chiral\nsymmetry breaking and the PQ symmetry is broken. In contrast to the original\nKim's model, our model explains the origin of the PQ symmetry thanks to the\nextra dimension and avoids the cosmological domain wall problem because of the\nchiral symmetry breaking in the Abelian gauge theory.\n", "  We present a generalized hydrogen model for the binding energies ($E_B$) of\nexcitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials that sheds light on the fundamental\ndifferences between excitons in two and three dimensions. In contrast to the\nwell-known hydrogen model of three-dimensional (3D) excitons, the description\nof 2D excitons is complicated by the fact that the screening cannot be assumed\nto be local. We show that one can consistently define an effective 2D\ndielectric constant by averaging the screening over the extend of the exciton.\nFor an ideal 2D semiconductor this leads to a simple expression for $E_B$ that\nonly depends on the excitonic mass and the 2D polarizability $\\alpha$. The\nmodel is shown to produce accurate results for 51 transition metal\ndichalcogenides. Remarkably, over a wide range of polarizabilities the\nexpression becomes independent of the mass and we obtain\n$E_B^{2D}\\approx3/(4\\pi\\alpha)$, which explains the recently observed linear\nscaling of exciton binding energies with band gap. It is also shown that the\nmodel accurately reproduces the non-hydrogenic Rydberg series in WS$_2$ and can\naccount for screening from the environment.\n", "  The miniaturization of current image sensors is largely limited by the volume\nof the optical elements. Using a sub-wavelength patterned quasi-periodic\nstructure, also known as a metasurface, one can build planar optical elements\nbased on the principle of diffraction. However, it was believed that high\nrefractive index materials are required for metasurface optics. Here, we show\nthat one can employ the design principles of a metasurface even with low\ncontrast materials, such as silicon nitride. We validate our theory by\nfabricating and experimentally characterizing several silicon nitride based\nlenses and vortex beam generators . The fabricated lenses achieved beam spots\nof less than 1 {\\mu}m with numerical apertures as high as ~ 0.75. A\ntransmission efficiency of 90% and focusing efficiency of 40% in the visible\nregime was observed. Our results pave the way towards building low-loss\nmetasurface based optical elements at visible frequencies using low contrast\nmaterials.\n", "  Realization of a free-standing graphene is always a demanding task. Here we\nuse scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to study the crystallographic\nstructure and electronic properties of the uniform free-standing graphene\nlayers obtained by intercalation of oxygen monolayer in the \"strongly\" bonded\ngraphene/Ru(0001) interface. Spectroscopic data show that such graphene layer\nis heavily p-doped with the Dirac point located at 552 meV above the Fermi\nlevel. Experimental data are understood within DFT and the observed effects are\nin good agreement with the theoretical data.\n", "  The exclusive semileptonic decay $B \\rightarrow \\pi \\ell \\nu$ is a key\nprocess for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element\n$V_{ub}$ from the comparison of experimental rates as a function of $q^2$ with\ntheoretically determined form factors. The sensitivity of the form factors to\nthe $u/d$ quark mass has meant significant systematic uncertainties in lattice\nQCD calculations at unphysically heavy pion masses. Here we give the first\nlattice QCD calculations of this process for u/d quark masses going down to\ntheir physical values, calculating the $f_0$ form factor at zero recoil to 3\\%.\nWe are able to resolve a long-standing controversy by showing that the\nsoft-pion theorem result $f_0(q^2_{max}) = f_B/f_{\\pi}$ does hold as $m_{\\pi}\n\\rightarrow 0$. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism for the\nlight quarks and show that staggered chiral perturbation theory for the\n$m_{\\pi}$ dependence is almost identical to continuum chiral perturbation\ntheory for $f_0$, $f_B$ and $f_{\\pi}$. We also give results for other processes\nsuch as $B_s \\rightarrow K \\ell \\nu$.\n", "  The Yukawa one-component plasma (OCP) is a paradigm model for describing\nplasmas that contain one component of interest and one or more other components\nthat can be treated as a neutralizing, screening background. In appropriately\nscaled units, interactions are characterized entirely by a screening parameter,\n$\\kappa$. As a result, systems of similar $\\kappa$ show the same dynamics,\nregardless of the underlying parameters (e.g., density and temperature). We\ndemonstrate this behavior using ultracold neutral plasmas (UNP) created by\nphotoionizing a cold ($T\\le10$ mK) gas. The ions in UNP systems are well\ndescribed by the Yukawa model, with the electrons providing the screening.\nCreation of the plasma through photoionization can be thought of as a rapid\nquench from $\\kappa_{0}=\\infty$ to a final $\\kappa$ value set by the electron\ndensity and temperature. We demonstrate experimentally that the post-quench\ndynamics are universal in $\\kappa$ over a factor of 30 in density and an order\nof magnitude in temperature. Results are compared with molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We also demonstrate that features of the post-quench kinetic\nenergy evolution, such as disorder-induced heating and kinetic-energy\noscillations, can be used to determine the plasma density and the electron\ntemperature.\n", "  In recent years there have been many attempts to characterize the occurrence\nof stellar, BD and planetary-mass companions to solar-type stars, with the aim\nof constraining formation mechanisms. From RV observations a dearth of\ncompanions with masses between 10-40 MJup has been noticed at close\nseparations, suggesting the possibility of a distinct formation mechanism for\nobjects above and below this range. We present a model for the substellar\ncompanion mass function (CMF). It consists of the superposition of the planet\nand BD companion mass distributions, assuming that we can extrapolate the RV\nmeasured companion mass function for planets to larger separations and the\nstellar companion mass-ratio distribution over all separations into the BD mass\nregime. By using both the results of the VLT/NaCo large program and the\ncomplementary archive datasets that probe the occurrence of planets and BDs on\nwide orbits around solar-type stars, we place some constraints on the planet\nand BD distributions. We developed a MC simulation tool to predict the outcome\nof a given survey, depending on the shape of the orbital parameter\ndistributions. Comparing the predictions with the results of the observations,\nwe calculate how likely different models are and which can be ruled out.\nCurrent observations are consistent with the proposed model for the CMF, as\nlong as a sufficiently small outer truncation radius is introduced for the\nplanet separation distribution. The results of the direct imaging surveys\nsearching for substellar companions around Sun-like stars are consistent with a\ncombined substellar mass spectrum of planets and BDs. This mass distribution\nhas a minimum between 10 and 50 MJup, in agreement with RV measurements. The\ndearth of objects in this mass range would naturally arise from the shape of\nthe mass distribution, without the introduction of any distinct formation\nmechanism for BDs.\n", "  We show how the horizon geometry and entropy of a Semiclassical Black Hole\ncan be reconstructed from a system of $N>>1$ horizonless conic singularities\nwith average opening angle at the horizon $\\langle \\Theta \\rangle=2\\pi$. This\nconclusion is strongly motivated by a generalized Wheeler-De Witt equation for\nquantum black holes. We will argument how infalling information will be\ninevitably chaotized in these systems. A part of the initial probability\ndensity will be trapped inside the system, in back and forth scatterings among\nconic singularities, for a characteristic time close to the Semiclassical BH\nlife-time. Further implications on information paradoxes are discussed.\n", "  Here we study multiplayer linear games, a natural generalization of XOR games\nto multiple outcomes. We generalize a recently proposed efficiently computable\nbound, in terms of the norm of a game matrix, on the quantum value of 2-player\ngames to linear games with $n$ players. As an example, we bound the quantum\nvalue of a generalization of the well-known CHSH game to $n$ players and $d$\noutcomes. We also apply the bound to show in a simple manner that any\nnontrivial functional box, that could lead to trivialization of communication\ncomplexity in a multiparty scenario, cannot be realized in quantum mechanics.\nWe then present a systematic method to derive device-independent witnesses of\ngenuine tripartite entanglement.\n", "  We report on a search for monochromatic $\\gamma$-ray features in the spectra\nof galaxy clusters observed by the \\emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. Galaxy\nclusters are the largest structures in the Universe that are bound by dark\nmatter (DM), making them an important testing ground for possible\nself-interactions or decays of the DM particles. Monochromatic $\\gamma$-ray\nlines provide a unique signature due to the absence of astrophysical\nbackgrounds and are as such considered a smoking-gun signature for new physics.\nAn unbinned joint likelihood analysis of the sixteen most promising clusters\nusing five years of data at energies between 10 and 400 GeV revealed no\nsignificant features. For the case of self-annihilation, we set upper limits on\nthe monochromatic velocity-averaged interaction cross section. These limits are\ncompatible with those obtained from observations of the Galactic Center, albeit\nweaker due to the larger distance to the studied clusters.\n", "  The goal of the paper is to categorify Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, aiming at\nproviding foundation for a direct construction of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory as an\nExtended Topological Quantum Field Theory. The main tool is cohomology with\ncoefficients in a Picard groupoid, namely the Picard groupoid of hermitian\nlines.\n", "  The precise arrangement of microscopic objects is critical to the development\nof functional materials and ornately patterned surfaces. Here, we present an\nacoustics-based method for the rapid arrangement of microscopic particles into\norganized and programmable architectures, which are periodically spaced within\na square assembly chamber. This macroscale device employs two-dimensional bulk\nacoustic standing waves to propel particles along the base of the chamber\ntoward pressure nodes or antinodes, depending on the acoustic contrast factor\nof the particle, and is capable of simultaneously creating thousands of\nsize-limited, isotropic and anisotropic assemblies within minutes. We pair\nexperiments with Brownian dynamics simulations to model the migration kinetics\nand assembly patterns of spherical microparticles. We use these insights to\npredict and subsequently validate the onset of buckling of the assemblies into\nthree-dimensional clusters by experiments upon increasing the acoustic pressure\namplitude and the particle concentration. The simulations are also used to\ninform our experiments for the assembly of non-spherical particles, which are\nthen recovered via fluid evaporation and directly inspected by electron\nmicroscopy. This method for assembly of particles offers several notable\nadvantages over other approaches (e.g., magnetics, electrokinetics and optical\ntweezing) including simplicity, speed and scalability and can also be used in\nconcert with other such approaches for enhancing the types of assemblies\nachievable.\n", "  Integral field spectroscopy studies based on CALIFA data have recently\nrevealed the presence of ongoing low-level star formation (SF) in the periphery\nof ~10% of local early-type galaxies (ETGs), witnessing a still ongoing\ninside-out galaxy growth process. A distinctive property of the nebular\ncomponent in these ETGs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, with\nthe inner zone displaying LINER emission with a H\\alpha equivalent width\nEW~1{\\AA}, and the outer one (3{\\AA}<EW<~20{\\AA}) showing HII-region\ncharacteristics. Using CALIFA IFS data, we empirically demonstrate that the\nconfinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strong\naperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+\nETGs: At low redshift (<~0.45), SDSS spectroscopy is restricted to the inner\n(SF-devoid LINER) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as\n\"retired\" galaxies (systems lacking SF and whose faint emission is powered by\npAGB stars). Only at higher z's the SDSS aperture can encompass the outer SF\nzone, permitting their unbiased classification as \"composite SF/LINER\". We also\ndemonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on the\nclassification of i+ ETGs via standard BPT emission-line ratios consists in a\nmonotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the \"seagull\"\ndistribution. Motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoretically\nthese biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as a\nfunction of z. To this end, we devise a simple model, which involves an\noutwardly propagating SF process, that reproduces the radial extent and\ntwo-zone EW distribution of i+ ETGs. By simulating on this model the\nspectroscopic SDSS aperture, we find that SDSS studies at z<~1 are\nprogressively restricted to the inner LINER-zone, and miss an increasingly\nlarge portion of the H\\alpha-emitting periphery.\n", "  Building upon our previous work on two-dimensional stringy black holes and\nits extension to spherically-symmetric four-dimensional stringy black holes, we\nshow how the latter retain information. A key r\\^ole is played by an\ninfinite-dimensional $W_\\infty$ symmetry that preserves the area of an isolated\nblack-hole horizon and hence its entropy. The exactly-marginal conformal\nworld-sheet operator representing a massless stringy particle interacting with\nthe black hole necessarily includes a contribution from $W_\\infty$ generators\nin its vertex function. This admixture manifests the transfer of information\nbetween the string black hole and external particles. We discuss different\nmanifestations of $W_\\infty$ symmetry in black-hole physics and the connections\nbetween them.\n", "  We re-investigate the holographic superconductor in hyperscaling violation\ngeometry by considering the coupling between the probed Maxwell field and the\nbackground dilaton. We find that the phenomenon of superconductivity still\nexists, but with properties affected by such a coupling. The critical\ntemperature decreases as the hyperscaling violation exponent is increased. The\ninfluence of the dynamical exponent on the critical temperature becomes\ncomplicated which depends on the mass of the probed scalar field and the\nhyperscaling violation exponent. The results of the frequency gap show a large\ndeviation from the expected universal relation.\n", "  In disordered Weyl semimetals, mechanisms of topological origin lead to novel\nmechanisms of transport, which manifest themselves in unconventional types of\nelectromagnetic response. Prominent examples of transport phenomena particular\nto the Weyl context include the anomalous Hall effect, the chiral magnetic\neffect, and the formation of totally field dominated regimes of transport in\nwhich the longitudinal conductance is proportional to an external magnetic\nfield. In this paper, we discuss the manifestations of these phenomena at large\nlength scales including the cases of strong disorder and/or magnetic field\nwhich are beyond the scope of diagrammatic perturbation theory. Our perhaps\nmost striking finding is the identification of a novel regime of\ndrift/diffusion transport where diffusion at short scales gives way to\neffectively ballistic dynamics at large scales, before a re-entrance to\ndiffusion takes place at yet larger scales. We will show that this regime plays\na key role in understanding the interplay of the various types of\nmagnetoresponse of the system. Our results are obtained by describing the\nstrongly disordered system in terms of an effective field theory of\nChern-Simons type. The paper contains a self-contained derivation of this\ntheory, and a discussion of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (noise)\ntransport phenomena following from it.\n", "  A model for composite elementary Standard Model (SM) particles based upon\nmagnetically bound vorton pairs, briefly introduced here, predicts the\nexistence of a complete family of magnetically charged particles, as well as\ntheir neutral isotopic partners (all counterparts to the SM elementary\nparticles), in which the lowest mass (charged) particle would be an\nelectrically neutral stable lepton, but which carries a magnetic charge\nequivalent to 1e. This new particle, which we call a magneticon (a counterpart\nto the electron) would be pair produced at all e+e- colliders at an Ecm above\ntwice its mass. In addition, PP and PPbar colliders should also be able to\nproduce these new particles through the Drell-Yan process. To our knowledge, no\nmonopole search experiment has been sensitive to such a low-charged magnetic\nmonopole above a particle mass of about 5 GeV/c2. Hence, we propose that a\nsearch for such a stable particle of magnetic charge 1e should be undertaken.\nWe have taken the ATLAS detector at the LHC as an example in which this search\nmight be done. To this end, we have modeled the magnetic fields and muon\ntrigger chambers of this detector. We show results from a simple Monte Carlo\nsimulation program to indicate how these particles might look in the detector\nand describe how one might search for these new particles in the ATLAS data\nstream.\n", "  We match the non-relativistic quark model, with both flavor dependent and\nflavor independent effective quark-quark interactions, to the spin-flavor\noperator basis of the 1/Nc expansion for the L=1 non-strange baryons. We obtain\nanalytic expressions for the coefficients of the 1/Nc operators in terms of\nradial integrals that depend on the shape and relative strength of the\nspin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor interactions of the model, which are left\nunspecified. We obtain several new, parameter-free relations between the seven\nmasses and the two mixing angles that can discriminate between different\nspin-flavor structures of the effective quark-quark interaction. We discuss in\ndetail how a general parametrization of the mass matrix depends on the mixing\nangles and is constrained by the assumptions on the effective quark-quark\ninteraction. We find that, within the present experimental uncertainties,\nconsistency with the best values of the mixing angles as determined by a recent\nglobal fit to masses and decays does not exclude any of the two most extreme\npossibilities of flavor dependent (independent) quark-quark interactions, as\ngenerated by meson (gluon) exchange interactions.\n", "  Top squark (stop) plays a key role in the radiative stability of the Higgs\nboson mass in supersymmetry (SUSY). The LHC searches for stop have made a great\nprogress and tightly constrained the stop mass during Run-1. In this work, we\nuse the LHC Run-1 data to determine the lower mass limit of the right-handed\nstop in a natural SUSY scenario, where the higgsinos $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_{1,2}$ and\n$\\tilde{\\chi}^\\pm_{1}$ are light and nearly degenerate. We find that the stop\nmass has been excluded up to 430 GeV for $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\lesssim 250$\nGeV and to 540 GeV for $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\simeq 100$ GeV by the Run-1 SUSY\nsearches for $2b+E^{miss}_T$ and $1\\ell+jets+E^{miss}_T$, respectively. In a\nsmall strip of parameter space with $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\gtrsim 190$ GeV, the\nstop mass can still be as light as 210 GeV and compatible with the Higgs mass\nmeasurement and the monojet bound. The 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 20\nfb$^{-1}$ can further cover such a light stop window by monojet and\n$2b+E^{miss}_T$ searches and push the lower bound of the stop mass to 710 GeV.\nWe also explore the potential to use the Higgs golden ratio,\n$D_{\\gamma\\gamma}=\\sigma(pp \\to h \\to \\gamma\\gamma)/\\sigma(pp \\to h \\to ZZ^*\n\\to4\\ell^\\pm)$, as a complementary probe for the light and compressed stop. If\nthis golden ratio can be measured at percent level at the high luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) or future $e^+e^-$ colliders, the light stop can be excluded for most\nof the currently allowed parameter region.\n", "  We discuss how entropy bounds, which are not respected in the standard\ncosmology, constrain the parameters of a previously suggested cosmology with a\nfinite total mass. In that alternative cosmology the matter density was\npostulated to be a spatial delta function at the time of the big bang\nthereafter diffusing rapidly outward with constant total mass. Also discussed\nhere are some related issues including the cosmic onion question, the\ninformation content of the universe, and the question of whether light trapping\nregions exist on a cosmic scale.\n", "  This document contains information supplementary to the article [1], but it\nis self-contained and can be read independently as a pedagogical review. In the\nfirst part, we explain our conventions for the tight-binding description of\nelectronic states on the hexagonal Bravais lattice in two dimensions. We derive\nthe Rashba spin splitting from elementary symmetry conditions, and subsequently\nconstruct a minimal tight-binding model which displays Rashba spin splitting\nnear the center of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding\nsymmetry conditions for a two-particle interaction in a second-quantized\nframework. In the second part, we describe our conventions for the temperature\nGreen functions, in terms of which the renormalization group equations in [1]\nhave been formulated. We also provide a brief summary of the most important\ndefinitions and properties of temperature Green functions.\n  [1] G. A. H. Schober, K.-U. Giering, M. M. Scherer, C. Honerkamp, and M.\nSalmhofer, arXiv:1409.7087.\n", "  The modified number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling $v_{n}/n_{q}^{n/2}\n\\sim KE_{T}/n_{q}$ for mesons and baryons and the scaling relation $v_{n} \\sim\nv_{2}^{n/2}$ for higher-order anisotropic flows, which were observed\nexperimentally, have been investigated at top RHIC energy. It has been found\nthat the modified NCQ scaling can not be obtained from the naive coalescence\neven by taking into account event-by-event fluctuations but may be due to\nhadronic afterburner or thermal freeze-out. In addition, we observed that the\nbehavior of the $v_{n}/v_{2}^{n/2}$ ratio is sensitive to the partonic\ninteraction, and it is different for mesons and baryons from the naive\ncoalescence but is expected to be almost the same experimentally.\n", "  The uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature is of key relevance for\nmany applications in the warm dense matter regime, e.g. dense plasmas and laser\nexcited solids. Also, the quality of density functional theory calculations\ncrucially relies on the availability of accurate data for the\nexchange-correlation energy. Recently, new benchmark results for the N = 33\nspin-polarized electrons at high density, r_s = r/a_B <= 4 and low temperature,\nhave been obtained with the configuration path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC)\nmethod [T. Schoof et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 130402 (2015)]. To achieve\nthese results, the original CPIMC algorithm [T. Schoof et al., Contrib. Plasma\nPhys. 51, 687 (2011)] had to be further optimized to cope with the fermion sign\nproblem (FSP). It is the purpose of this paper to give detailed information on\nthe manifestation of the FSP in CPIMC simulations of the UEG and to demonstrate\nhow it can be turned into a controllable convergence problem. In addition, we\npresent new thermodynamic results for higher temperatures. Finally, to overcome\nthe limitations of CPIMC towards strong coupling, we invoke an independent\nmethod|the recently developed permutation blocking path integral Monte Carlo\napproach [T. Dornheim et al., accepted for publication in J. Chem Phys.,\narXiv:1508.03221]. The combination of both approaches is able to yield ab\ninitio data for the UEG over the entire density range, above a temperature of\nabout one half of the Fermi temperature. Comparison with restricted path\nintegral Monte Carlo data [E. W. Brown et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 146405\n(2013)] allows us to quantify the systematic error arising from the free\nparticle nodes.\n", "  We perform theoretical analysis of polarization-sensitive Raman spectroscopy\non NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As, EuFe$2$As$_2$, SrFe$_2$As$_2$, and\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, focusing on two features seen in the $B_{1g}$\nsymmetry channel (in one Fe unit cell notation): the strong temperature\ndependence of the static, uniform Raman response in the normal state and the\nexistence of a collective mode in the superconducting state. We show that both\nfeatures can be explained by the coupling of fermions to pairs of magnetic\nfluctuations via the Aslamazov-Larkin process. We first analyze\nmagnetically-mediated Raman intensity at the leading two-loop order and then\ninclude interactions between pairs of magnetic fluctuations. We show that the\nfull Raman intensity in the $B_{1g}$ channel can be viewed as the result of the\ncoupling of light to Ising-nematic susceptibility via Aslamazov-Larkin process.\nWe argue that the singular temperature dependence in the normal state is the\ncombination of the temperature dependencies of the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex and\nof Ising-nematic susceptibility. We discuss two scenarios for the resonance\nbelow $T_c$. In one, the resonance is due to the development of a pole in the\nfully renormalized Ising-nematic susceptibility. The other is the orbital\nexcitonic scenario, in which spin fluctuations generate an attractive\ninteraction between low-energy fermions.\n", "  We investigate the use of stochastically estimated light quark propagators in\ncorrelation functions involving a static color source. To this end we compute\nthe static-light meson pseudoscalar correlation function in the stochastic LapH\nframework, using an ensemble of $N_f= 2+1$ gauge configurations generated\nthrough the CLS effort. We extract the static-light as well as the\nstatic-strange mass with good statistical precision. Together with the static\npotential, we obtain a preliminary estimate for the expected mixing region.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological background evolution and perturbations in a\ngeneral class of spatially covariant theories of gravity, which propagates two\ntensor modes and one scalar mode. We show that the structure of the theory is\npreserved under the disformal transformation. We also evaluate the primordial\nspectra for both the gravitational waves and the curvature perturbation, which\nare invariant under the disformal transformation. Due to the existence of\nhigher spatial derivatives, the quadratic Lagrangian for the tensor modes\nitself cannot be transformed to the form in the Einstein frame. Nevertheless,\nthere exists a one-parameter family of frames in which the spectrum of the\ngravitational waves takes the standard form in the Einstein frame.\n", "  We numerically study the head-on scattering of a 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic\nmonopole and antimonopole for a wide range of parameters. In contrast to the\nscattering of a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ kink and antikink in 1+1 dimensions, we find\nthat the monopole and antimonopole annihilate even when scattered at\nrelativistic velocities. If the monopole and antimonopole have a relative\ntwist, there is a repulsive force between them and they can initially be\nreflected. However, in every case we have examined, the reflected monopoles\nremain bound and eventually annihilate. We also calculate the magnetic helicity\nin the aftermath of monopole-antimonopole annihilation and confirm the\nconversion of relative twist to magnetic helicity as discussed earlier in the\nelectroweak case.\n", "  For a tetragonal material, order parameters of $p_x$ and $p_y$ symmetry are\nrelated by rotation and hence have the same $T_{\\rm c}$ at a mean-field level.\nThis degeneracy can be lifted by a symmetry-breaking field, like (uniaxial)\nin-plane strain, such that at $T_{\\rm c}$, the order parameter is only of $p_x$\nor $p_y$ symmetry. Only at a lower temperature also the respective other order\nparameter condenses to form a chiral $p$-wave state. At the mean-field level,\nthe derivative of $T_{\\rm c}$ with strain is discontinuous at zero strain. We\nanalyze consequences of (thermal) fluctuations on the strain-temperature phase\ndiagram within a Ginzburg-Landau approach. We find that the order-parameter\nfluctuations can drive the transition to be weakly first order, rounding off\nthis discontinuity. We discuss the possibility of a second-order transition\ninto a non-superconducting time-reversal-symmetry-breaking phase and\nconsequences for the spin-triplet superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.\n", "  We develop a model to study tetraquark production in hadronic collisions. We\nfocus on double parton scattering and formulate a version of the color\nevaporation model for the production of the $X(3872)$ and of the $T_{4c}$\ntetraquark, a state composed by the $c \\bar{c} c \\bar{c}$ quarks. We find that\nthe production cross section grows rapidly with the collision energy $\\sqrt{s}$\nand make predictions for the forthcoming higher energy data of the LHC.\n", "  In this paper, we study a generalization of twisted (groupoid) equivariant\n$\\mathrm{K}$-theory in the sense of Freed-Moore for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded\n$\\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. It is defined by using Fredholm operators on Hilbert\nmodules with twisted representations. We compare it with another description\nusing odd symmetries, which is a generalization of van Daele's\n$\\mathrm{K}$-theory for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Banach algebras. In particular,\nwe obtain a simple presentation of the twisted equivariant $\\mathrm{K}$-group\nwhen the $\\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra is trivially graded. It is applied for the\nbulk-edge correspondence of topological insulators with CT-type symmetries.\n", "  Contrary to what might be expected, when an organic dye is sputtered onto an\nopaque holey metal film, transmission bands can be observed at the absorption\nenergies of the molecules. This phenomenon, known as absorption-induced\ntransparency, is aided by a strong modification of the propagation properties\nof light inside the holes when filled by the molecules. Despite having been\ninitially observed in metallic structures in the optical regime, new routes for\ninvestigation and applications at different spectral regimes can be devised.\nHere, in order to illustrate the potential use of absorption induced\ntransparency at terahertz, a method for molecular detection is presented,\nsupported by a theoretical analysis.\n", "  We have used the Herschel-HIFI instrument to observe both nuclear spin\nsymmetries of amidogen (NH2) towards the high-mass star-forming regions W31C\n(G10.6-0.4), W49N (G43.2-0.1), W51 (G49.5-0.4) and G34.3+0.1. The aim is to\ninvestigate the ratio of nuclear spin types, the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR), of\nNH2. The excited NH2 transitions are used to construct radiative transfer\nmodels of the hot cores and surrounding envelopes in order to investigate the\nexcitation and possible emission of the ground state rotational transitions of\northo-NH2 N_(K_a,K_c} J=1_(1,1) 3/2 - 0_(0,0) 1/2 and para-NH2 2_(1,2) 5/2 -\n1_(0,1) 3/2$ used in the OPR calculations. Our best estimate of the average OPR\nin the envelopes lie above the high temperature limit of three for W49N,\nspecifically 3.5 with formal errors of \\pm0.1, but for W31C, W51, and G34.3+0.1\nwe find lower values of 2.5\\pm0.1, 2.7\\pm0.1, and 2.3\\pm0.1, respectively. Such\nlow values are strictly forbidden in thermodynamical equilibrium since the OPR\nis expected to increase above three at low temperatures. In the translucent\ninterstellar gas towards W31C, where the excitation effects are low, we find\nsimilar values between 2.2\\pm0.2 and 2.9\\pm0.2. In contrast, we find an OPR of\n3.4\\pm0.1 in the dense and cold filament connected to W51, and also two lower\nlimits of >4.2 and >5.0 in two other translucent gas components towards W31C\nand W49N. At low temperatures (T \\lesssim 50 K) the OPR of H2 is <10^-1, far\nlower than the terrestrial laboratory normal value of three. In such a\n\"para-enriched H2\" gas, our astrochemical models can reproduce the variations\nof the observed OPR, both below and above the thermodynamical equilibrium\nvalue, by considering nuclear-spin gas-phase chemistry. The models suggest that\nvalues below three arise in regions with temperatures >20-25 K, depending on\ntime, and values above three at lower temperatures.\n", "  High confinement, integrated silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides have recently\nemerged as attractive platform for on-chip nonlinear optical devices. The\nfabrication of high-Q SiN microresonators with anomalous group velocity\ndispersion (GVD) has enabled broadband nonlinear optical frequency comb\ngeneration. Such frequency combs have been successfully applied in coherent\ncommunication and ultrashort pulse generation. However, the reliable\nfabrication of high confinement waveguides from stoichiometric, high stress SiN\nremains challenging. Here we present a novel photonic Damascene fabrication\nprocess enabling the use of substrate topography for stress control and thin\nfilm crack prevention. With close to unity sample yield we fabricate\nmicroresonators with $1.35\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ thick waveguides and optical Q\nfactors of $3.7\\times10^{6}$ and demonstrate single temporal dissipative Kerr\nsoliton (DKS) based coherent optical frequency comb generation. Our newly\ndeveloped process is interesting also for other material platforms, photonic\nintegration and mid infrared Kerr comb generation.\n", "  The field-driven magnetisation reversal processes in disordered systems\nexhibit a collective behaviour that is manifested in the scale-invariance of\navalanches, closely related to underlying dynamical mechanisms. Using the\nmultifractal time series analysis, we study the structure of fluctuations at\ndifferent scales in the accompanying Barkhausen noise. The stochastic signal\nrepresents the magnetisation discontinuities along the hysteresis loop of a\n3-dimensional random field Ising model simulated for varied disorder strength\nand driving rates. The analysis of the spectrum of the generalised Hurst\nexponents reveals that the segments of the signal with large fluctuations\nrepresent two distinct classes of stochastic processes in weak and strong\npinning regimes. Furthermore, increased driving rates have a profound effect on\nthe small fluctuation segments and broadening of the spectrum. The study of the\ntemporal correlations, sequences of avalanches, and their scaling features\ncomplements the quantitative measures of the collective dynamics at the\nhysteresis loop. The multifractal properties of Barkhausen noise describe the\ndynamical state of domains and precisely discriminate the weak pinning,\npermitting the motion of individual walls, from the mechanisms occurring in\nstrongly disordered systems. The multifractal nature of the reversal processes\nis particularly relevant for currently investigated memory devices that utilize\na controlled motion of individual domain walls.\n", "  We consider the production of dark matter in association with a pair of top\nquarks, mediated by a scalar or pseudoscalar particle in a generic Simplified\nModel. We demonstrate that the difference of azimuthal angle between the two\nleptons $\\Delta \\phi_{ll}$, in the dileptonic top decay mode, can directly\nprobe the CP-properties of the mediator. We estimate the constraints to\nstrength and CP-structure of dark matter production for these well-motivated\nSimplified Models from the LHC Run II.\n", "  We discuss the case of correlators in CFT made of pure contact terms, without\na corresponding bare part. We show two examples. The first is provided by the\nconformal limits of a free massive fermion theory in 3d. We show that the\n(conserved) current correlators are in one-to-one correspondence with the terms\nof the 3d gauge CS action. The second is the Pontryagin trace anomaly. The\ncorresponding 3-point correlator is nonvanishing even though the corresponding\nuntraced correlator vanishes.\n", "  Real world quantum systems are open to perpetual influence from the wider\nenvironment. Quantum gravitational fluctuations provide a most fundamental\nsource of the environmental influence through their universal interactions with\nall forms of energy and matter causing decoherence. This may have subtle\nimplications on precision laboratory experiments and astronomical observations\nand could limit the ultimate capacities for quantum technologies prone to\ndecoherence. To establish the essential physical mechanism of decoherence under\nweak spacetime fluctuations, we carry out a sequence of analytical steps\nutilizing the Dirac constraint quantization and gauge invariant influence\nfunctional techniques, resulting in a general master equation of a compact\nform, that describes an open quantum gravitational system with arbitrary\nbosonic fields. An initial application of the theory is illustrated by the\nimplied quantum gravitational dissipation of light as well as (non)relativistic\nmassive or massless scalar particles. Related effects could eventually lead to\nimportant physical consequences including those on a cosmological scale and for\na large number of correlated particles.\n", "  Stellar activity patterns are responsible for jitter effects that are\nobserved at different timescales and amplitudes. These effects are currently in\nthe focus of many exoplanet search projects, since the lack of a well-defined\ncharacterization and correction strategy hampers the detection of the signals\nassociated with small exoplanets. Accurate simulations of the stellar\nphotosphere can provide synthetic time series data. These may help to\ninvestigate the relation between activity jitter and stellar parameters when\nconsidering different active region patterns. Moreover, jitters can be analysed\nat different wavelength scales in order to design strategies to remove or\nminimize them. In this work we present the StarSim tool, which is based on a\nmodel for a spotted rotating photosphere built from the integration of the\nspectral contribution of a fine grid of surface elements. The model includes\nall significant effects affecting the flux intensities and the wavelength of\nspectral features produced by active regions and planets. A specific\napplication for the characterization and modelling of the spectral signature of\nactive regions is considered, showing that the chromatic effects of faculae are\ndominant for low temperature contrasts of spots. Synthetic time series are\nmodelled for HD 189733. Our algorithm reproduces both the photometry and the\nRVs to good precision, generally better than the studies published to date. We\nevaluate the RV signature of the activity in HD 189733 by exploring a grid of\nsolutions from the photometry. We find that the use of RV data in the inverse\nproblem could break degeneracies and allow for a better determination of some\nstellar and activity parameters. In addition, the effects of spots are studied\nfor a set of simulated transit photometry, showing that these can introduce\nvariations which are very similar to the signal of an atmosphere dominated by\ndust.\n", "  We study the magnetic flux carried by pores located outside active regions\nwith sunspots and investigate their possible contribution to the reversal of\nthe global magnetic field of the Sun. We find that they contain a total flux of\ncomparable amplitude to the total magnetic flux contained in polar caps. The\npores located at distances of 40--100~Mm from the closest active region have\nsystematically the correct sign to contribute to the polar cap reversal. These\npores can predominantly be found in bipolar magnetic regions. We propose that\nduring grand minima of solar activity, such a systematic polarity trend, akin\nto a weak magnetic (Babcock-Leighton-like) source term could still be operating\nbut was missed by the contemporary observers due to the limited resolving power\nof their telescopes.\n", "  We explore the tensor perturbation of the $f(T)$ brane embedded in an AdS$_5$\nspacetime. With the transverse-traceless condition, we get the tensor\nperturbation equation of the $f(T)$ brane and show that the stability of this\nbrane system can be ensured. In addition, we take $ f(T)=T+\\alpha T^2$ as an\nexample to analyse the localization problem of the graviton zero mode. It is\nshown that the graviton zero mode can be localized on the brane.\n", "  Vortex lattices in rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates lead to a\nperiodic modulation of the superfluid density with a triangular symmetry. Here\nwe show that this symmetry can be combined with an external perturbation in\norder to create super-lattice structures with two or more periodicities.\nConsidering a condensate which is kicked by an optical lattice potential, we\nfind the appearance of transient moir\\'e lattice structures, which can be\nidentified using the kinetic energy spectrum.\n", "  We continue our series of studies of high-energy collisions of black holes\ninvestigating unequal-mass, boosted head-on collisions in four dimensions. We\nshow that the fraction of the center-of-mass energy radiated as gravitational\nwaves becomes independent of mass ratio and approximately equal to $13\\%$ at\nlarge energies. We support this conclusion with calculations using black hole\nperturbation theory and Smarr's zero-frequency limit approximation. These\nresults lend strong support to the conjecture that the detailed structure of\nthe colliding objects is irrelevant at high energies.\n", "  We develop a Gaussian state treatment that allows a transparent quantum\ndescription of the continuous, nondestructive imaging of and feedback on a\nBose-Einstein condensate. We have previously demonstrated [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{115}, 060401 (2015)] that the measurement back action of stroboscopic\nimaging leads to selective squeezing and entanglement of quantized density\noscillations. Here, we investigate how the squeezing and entanglement are\naffected by the finite spatial resolution and geometry of the probe laser beam\nand of the detector and how they can be optimized.\n", "  By a combination of first-principles calculations and semi-classical\nBoltzmann transport theory, we investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on\nthe electronic structure and transport properties of PtCoO$_2$ and PdCoO$_2$.\nIn contrast to the rather uniform elastic response of both systems, we predict\nfor PtCoO$_2$ a high sensitivity of the out-of-plane transport properties to\nstrain, which is not present in PdCoO$_2$. At ambient temperature, we identify\na considerable absolute change in the thermopower from $-107\\,\\mu$V/K at\n$-5\\,$\\% compressive strain to $-303\\,\\mu$V/K at $+5\\,$\\% tensile strain. This\nremarkable response is related to distinct changes of the Fermi surface, which\ninvolve the crossing of two additional bands at a moderate compressive in-plane\nstrain. Combining our transport results with available experimental data on\nelectrical and lattice thermal conductivity we predict a thermoelectric figure\nof merit of up to $ZT$$\\,=\\,$$0.25$ at $T$$\\,=\\,$$600\\,$K for strained\nPtCoO$_2$.\n", "  Many metals display resistivity saturation - a substantial decrease in the\nslope of the resistivity as a function of temperature, that occurs when the\nelectron scattering rate $\\tau^{-1}$ becomes comparable to the Fermi energy\n$E_F/\\hbar$ (the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit). At such temperatures, the usual\ndescription of a metal in terms of ballistically propagating quasiparticles is\nno longer valid. We present a tractable model of a large $N$ number of\nelectronic bands coupled to $N^2$ optical phonon modes, which displays a\ncrossover behavior in the resistivity at temperatures where $\\tau^{-1}\\sim\nE_F/\\hbar$. At low temperatures, the resistivity obeys the familiar linear\nform, while at high temperatures, the resistivity still increases linearly, but\nwith a modified slope (that can be either lower or higher than the\nlow-temperature slope, depending on the band structure). The high temperature\nnon-Boltzmann regime is interpreted by considering the diffusion constant and\nthe compressibility, both of which scale as the inverse square root of the\ntemperature.\n", "  We present an analytic microscopic theory showing that in a large class of\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quasiperiodic quantum kicked rotors, a dynamical analog of\nthe integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) emerges from an intrinsic chaotic\nstructure. Specifically, the inverse of the Planck's quantum ($h_e$) and the\nrotor's energy growth rate mimic the `filling fraction' and the `longitudinal\nconductivity' in conventional IQHE, respectively, and a hidden quantum number\nis found to mimic the `quantized Hall conductivity'. We show that for an\ninfinite discrete set of critical values of $h_e$, the long-time energy growth\nrate is universal and of order of unity (`metallic' phase), but otherwise\nvanishes (`insulating' phase). Moreover, the rotor insulating phases are\ntopological, each of which is characterized by a hidden quantum number. This\nnumber exhibits universal behavior for small $h_e$, i.e., it jumps by unity\nwhenever $h_e$ decreases, passing through each critical value. This intriguing\nphenomenon is not triggered by the like of Landau band filling, well-known to\nbe the mechanism for conventional IQHE, and far beyond the canonical\nThouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs paradigm for quantum Hall transitions.\nInstead, this dynamical phenomenon is of strong chaos origin; it does not occur\nwhen the dynamics is (partially) regular. More precisely, we find that, for the\nfirst time, a topological object, similar to the topological theta angle in\nquantum chromodynamics, emerges from strongly chaotic motion at microscopic\nscales, and its renormalization gives the hidden quantum number.Our analytic\nresults are confirmed by numerical simulations.Our findings indicate that rich\ntopological quantum phenomena can emerge from chaos and might point to a new\ndirection of study in the interdisciplinary area straddling chaotic dynamics\nand condensed matter physics.\n", "  Al$_{x}$Cr$_{1-x}$ composite cathodes with Al contents of x = 0.75, 0.5 and\n0.25 were exposed to cathodic arc plasmas in Ar, N$_2$ and O$_2$ atmospheres\nand their erosion behaviour was studied. Cross-sectional analysis of the\nelemental distribution of the near-surface zone in the cathodes by scanning\nelectron microscopy revealed the formation of a modified layer for all cathodes\nand atmospheres. Due to intermixing of Al and Cr in the heat-affected zone,\nintermetallic Al-Cr phases formed as evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis.\nCathode poisoning effects in the reactive N$_2$ and O$_2$ atmospheres were\nnon-uniform as a result of the applied magnetic field configuration. With the\nexception of oxide islands on Al-rich cathodes, reactive layers were absent in\nthe circular erosion zone, while nitrides and oxides formed in the less eroded\ncentre region of the cathodes.\n", "  We investigate single CoFeB nanotubes with hexagonal cross-section using\ndynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM). We develop both an analytical model\nbased on the Stoner-Wohlfarth approximation and a broadly applicable numerical\nframework for analyzing DCM measurements of magnetic nanostructures.\nMagnetometry data show the presence of a uniformly magnetized configuration at\nhigh external fields with $\\mu_0 M_s =1.3 \\pm 0.1$ T and non-uniform\nconfigurations at low fields. In this low-field regime, comparison between\nnumerical simulations and DCM measurements supports the existence of\nflux-closure configurations. Crucially, evidence of such configurations is only\napparent because of the sensitivity of DCM to single nanotubes, whereas\nconventional measurements of ensembles are often obscured by sample-to-sample\ninhomogeneities in size, shape, and orientation\n", "  In this paper we firstly demonstrate step by step that the factorization\nhypothesis is valid at the next-to-leading order (NLO) for the exclusive\nprocess $\\rho \\gamma^{\\star} \\to \\rho$ by employing the collinear factorization\napproach, and then extend this proof to the case of the $k_T$ factorization by\ntaking into account the transversal momentum of the light external quark\n(anti-quark) lines in the $\\rho$ meson. At the NLO level, we then show that the\nsoft divergences from different sub-diagrams will be canceled each other in the\nquark level, while the remaining collinear divergences can be absorbed into the\nNLO meson wave functions. The full NLO amplitudes can therefore be factorized\nas the convolution of the NLO wave functions $ \\Phi^{(1)}_{\\rho}$ and the\ninfrared-finite leading order (LO) hard kernels $G^0_{X,IJ,kl}$ in the $k_T$\nfactorization. We also write down the polarized NLO $\\rho$ meson wave functions\nin the form of nonlocal hadron matrix elements with the gauge factor integral\npath deviating from the light cone. These NLO $\\rho$ meson wave functions can\nbe used to calculate the NLO hard corrections to some relevant exclusive\nprocesses, such as $B \\to \\rho$ transition.\n", "  Recently, a suspicion arose that the free electrons in planetary nebulae\n(PNe) and HII regions might have non-thermal energy distributions. In this\nscenario, a kappa index is introduced to characterize the electron energy\ndistributions, with smaller kappa values indicating larger deviations from\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Assuming that this is the case, we determine\nthe kappa values for a sample of PNe and HII regions by comparing the\nintensities of [OIII] collisionally excited lines and the hydrogen Balmer jump.\nWe find the average kappa indices of PNe and HII regions to be 27 and 32,\nrespectively. Correlations between the resultant kappa values and various\nphysical properties of the nebulae are examined to explore the potential origin\nof non-thermal electrons in photoionized gaseous nebulae. However, no positive\nresult is obtained. Thus the current analysis does not lend to support to the\nidea that kappa-distributed electrons are present in PNe and HII regions.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of the Georgi-Machacek model at next-to-leading\norder (NLO) in QCD matched to parton shower, using a fully-automated tool chain\nbased on MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and FeynRules. We focus on the production of the\nfermiophobic custodial fiveplet scalars H_5^0, H_5^+/-, and H_5^++/-- through\nvector boson fusion (VBF), associated production with a vector boson (V H_5),\nand scalar pair production (H_5 H_5). For these production mechanisms we\ncompute NLO corrections to production rates as well as to differential\ndistributions. Our results demonstrate that the Standard Model (SM) overall\nK-factors for such processes cannot in general be directly applied to\nbeyond-the-SM distributions, due both to differences in the scalar electroweak\ncharges and to variation of the K-factors over the differential distributions.\n", "  We present a method for solving the first-order field equations in a\npost-Newtonian (PN) expansion. Our calculations generalize work of Bini and\nDamour and subsequently Kavanagh et al., to consider eccentric orbits on a\nSchwarzschild background. We derive expressions for the retarded metric\nperturbation at the location of the particle for all $\\ell$-modes. We find\nthat, despite first appearances, the Regge-Wheeler gauge metric perturbation is\n$C^0$ at the particle for all $\\ell$. As a first use of our solutions, we\ncompute the gauge-invariant quantity $\\langle U \\rangle$ through 4PN while\nsimultaneously expanding in eccentricity through $e^{10}$. By anticipating the\n$e\\to 1$ singular behavior at each PN order, we greatly improve the accuracy of\nour results for large $e$. We use $\\langle U \\rangle$ to find 4PN contributions\nto the effective one body potential $\\hat Q$ through $e^{10}$ and at linear\norder in the mass-ratio.\n", "  We propose and analyze a simple mesoscopic quantum heat engine that exhibits\nboth high-power and high-efficiency. The system consists of a biased Josephson\njunction coupled to two microwave cavities, with each cavity coupled to a\nthermal bath. Resonant Cooper pair tunneling occurs with the exchange of\nphotons between cavities, and a temperature difference between the baths can\nnaturally lead to a current against the voltage, and hence work. As a\nconsequence of the unique properties of Cooper-pair tunneling, the heat current\nis completely separated from the charge current. This combined with the strong\nenergy-selectivity of the process leads to an extremely high efficiency.\n", "  We present precise theoretical predictions for the absolute branching\nfractions of $\\Lambda_c^+ \\to \\Lambda \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell\\,(\\ell=e,\\mu)$ decays in\nthe covariant confined quark model. This study is motivated by two recent and\naccurate measurements of the absolute branching fractions of $\\Lambda_c^+ \\to p\nK^- \\pi^+$ and $\\Lambda_c^+ \\to \\Lambda e^+ \\nu_e$ by the Belle Collaboration\nat the KEKB and by the BESIII Collaboration at the BEPCII. Our predictions for\nthe branching fractions are consistent with both experimental results. We also\nprovide detailed numerical results for differential decay distributions and\npolarization observables.\n", "  GS 0836-429 is a neutron star X-ray transient that displays Type-I X-ray\nbursts. In 2003 and 2004 it experienced two outbursts in X-rays. We present\nhere an analysis of the system bursting properties during these outbursts. We\nstudied the evolution of the 2003-2004 outbursts in soft X-rays using RXTE\n(2.5-12 keV; ASM), and in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL (17-80 keV, IBIS/ISGRI).\nUsing data from the JEM-X monitor onboard INTEGRAL we detected 61 Type-I X-ray\nbursts, and confirm that the source displayed a quasi-periodic burst recurrence\ntime of about 2.3 hours. We improve the characterization of the fuel\ncomposition, as well as the description of the typical burst durations and\nfluences. We estimate the average value of $\\alpha$ to be $49\\pm\\,3$. This\nvalue together with the observed burst profiles indicate a regime of a mixed\nHe/H runaway triggered by unstable helium ignition. In addition, we report the\ndetection of four series of double bursts, with burst recurrence times of\n$\\leq\\,20$ minutes. The measured recurrence time in double bursts is too short\nto allow the accretion of enough fresh material, necessary to trigger a Type-I\nX-ray burst. This suggests the presence of left-over, unburned material from\nthe preceding burst which gets ignited in a time scale of minutes. The energies\nand time scales of the secondary bursts suggest a lower fraction of hydrogen\ncompared to that estimated for the primary bursts. The persistent emission was\nroughly constant during the period when the Type I X-ray bursts were detected.\nWe derive an average accretion rate during our observations of\n$\\dot{m}\\sim\\,8\\,\\%\\,\\dot{m}_{Edd}$. The spectrum of the persistent emission\ncan be fit with a non-thermal component, indicative for the source to be in a\nhard state when the INTEGRAL observations were performed.\n", "  With their high beam energy and intensity, existing and near-future proton\nbeam dumps provide an excellent opportunity to search for new very weakly\ncoupled particles in the MeV to GeV mass range. One particularly interesting\nexample is a so-called axion-like particle (ALP), i.e. a pseudoscalar coupled\nto two photons. The challenge in proton beam dumps is to reliably calculate the\nproduction of the new particles from the interactions of two composite objects,\nthe proton and the target atoms. In this work we argue that Primakoff\nproduction of ALPs proceeds in a momentum range where production rates and\nangular distributions can be determined to sufficient precision using simple\nelectromagnetic form factors. Reanalysing past proton beam dump experiments for\nthis production channel, we derive novel constraints on the parameter space for\nALPs. We show that the NA62 experiment at CERN could probe unexplored parameter\nspace by running in 'dump mode' for a few days and discuss opportunities for\nfuture experiments such as SHiP.\n", "  The mechanism by which the Fermi surface of high-$T_c$ cuprates undergoes a\ndramatic change from a large hole-like barrel to small arcs or pockets on\nentering the pseudogap phase remains a question of fundamental importance. Here\nwe calculate the normal-state Hall coefficient from the resonating-valence-bond\nspin-liquid model developed by Yang, Rice and Zhang. In this model,\nreconstruction of the Fermi surface occurs via an intermediate regime where the\nFermi surface consists of both hole- and electron-like pockets. We find that\nthe doping $(x)$ dependence of the Hall number transitions from $1+x$ to $x$\nover this narrow doping range. At low temperatures, a switch from a downturn to\nan upturn in the Hall coefficient signals the departure of the electron-like\npockets from the Fermi surface.\n", "  We summarise some of the main observational challenges for the standard\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model and describe how results\nrecently presented in the parallel session `Large--scale Structure and\nStatistics' (DE3) at the `Fourteenth Marcel Grossman Meeting on General\nRelativity' are related to these challenges.\n", "  By using variational wave functions and quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we\ninvestigate the complete phase diagram of the Heisenberg model on the\nanisotropic triangular lattice, where two out of three bonds have\nsuper-exchange couplings $J$ and the third one has instead $J^\\prime$. This\nmodel interpolates between the square lattice and the isotropic triangular one,\nfor $J^\\prime/J \\le 1$, and between the isotropic triangular lattice and a set\nof decoupled chains, for $J/J^\\prime \\le 1$. We consider all the\nfully-symmetric spin liquids that can be constructed with the fermionic\nprojective-symmetry group classification [Y. Zhou and X.-G. Wen,\narXiv:cond-mat/0210662] and we compare them with the spiral magnetic orders\nthat can be accommodated on finite clusters. Our results show that, for\n$J^\\prime/J \\le 1$, the phase diagram is dominated by magnetic orderings, even\nthough a spin-liquid state may be possible in a small parameter window, i.e.,\n$0.7 \\lesssim J^\\prime/J \\lesssim 0.8$. In contrast, for $J/J^\\prime \\le 1$, a\nlarge spin-liquid region appears close to the limit of decoupled chains, i.e.,\nfor $J/J^\\prime \\lesssim 0.6$, while magnetically ordered phases with spiral\norder are stabilized close to the isotropic point.\n", "  (Abridged) Recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the Galactic\ndisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.\nIn this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporal\nvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. We used a\nGaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, to\nseparate in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane a clean disk star subsample from the\nGaia-ESO survey internal data release 2. We find that the sample is separated\ninto five groups associated with major Galactic components; the metal-rich end\nof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.\nThis is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the Apache Point\nObservatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The two\nmetal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition\n([Fe/H]>-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. This\nholds true at different radial regions. The distribution of Galactocentric\nradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([Fe/H]<-0.25 dex) is\nshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. Moreover,\nthe metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale height\nintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and it\ndisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. These stars might have\nformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formation\ntaking place in the internal thin disk. Their enhancement levels might be due\nto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or the\ninner halo. The smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distribution\nwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] suggested by\nthe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.\n", "  We investigate the interlayer phonon modes in $N$-layer rhenium diselenide\n(ReSe$_2$) and rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) by means of ultralow-frequency\nmicro-Raman spectroscopy. These transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit a\nstable distorted octahedral (1T') phase with significant in-plane anisotropy,\nleading to sizable splitting of the (in-plane) layer shear modes. The\nfan-diagrams associated with the measured frequencies of the interlayer shear\nmodes and the (out-of-plane) interlayer breathing modes are perfectly described\nby a finite linear chain model and allow the determination of the interlayer\nforce constants. Nearly identical values are found for ReSe$_2$ and ReS$_2$.\nThe latter are appreciably smaller than but on the same order of magnitude as\nthe interlayer force constants reported in graphite and in trigonal prismatic\n(2Hc) transition metal dichalcogenides (such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$,\nWS$_2$, WSe$_2$), demonstrating the importance of van der Waals interactions in\n$N$-layer ReSe$_2$ and ReS$_2$. In-plane anisotropy results in a complex\nangular dependence of the intensity of all Raman modes, which can be\nempirically utilized to determine the crystal orientation. However, we also\ndemonstrate that the angular dependence of the Raman response drastically\ndepends on the incoming photon energy, shedding light on the importance of\nresonant exciton-phonon coupling in ReSe$_2$ and ReS$_2$.\n", "  We present a novel nuclear energy density functional method to calculate\nspectroscopic properties of atomic nuclei. Intrinsic nuclear quadrupole\ndeformations and rotational frequencies are considered simultaneously as the\ndegrees of freedom within a symmetry conserving configuration mixing framework.\nThe present method allows the study of nuclear states with collective and\nsingle-particle character. We calculate the fascinating structure of the\nsemi-magic 44S nucleus as a first application of the method, obtaining an\nexcellent quantitative agreement both with the available experimental data and\nwith state-of-the-art shell model calculations.\n", "  Recent interferometer observations have found that the D2O/HDO abundance\nratio is higher than that of HDO/H2O by about one order of magnitude in the\nvicinity of low-mass protostar NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, where water ice has\nsublimated. Previous laboratory and theoretical studies show that the D2O/HDO\nice ratio should be lower than the HDO/H2O ice ratio, if HDO and D2O ices are\nformed simultaneously with H2O ice. In this work, we propose that the observed\nfeature, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is a natural consequence of chemical evolution in\nthe early cold stages of low-mass star formation: 1) majority of oxygen is\nlocked up in water ice and other molecules in molecular clouds, where water\ndeuteration is not efficient, and 2) water ice formation continues with much\nreduced efficiency in cold prestellar/protostellar cores, where deuteration\nprocesses are highly enhanced due to the drop of the ortho-para ratio of H2,\nthe weaker UV radiation field, etc. Using a simple analytical model and gas-ice\nastrochemical simulations tracing the evolution from the formation of molecular\nclouds to protostellar cores, we show that the proposed scenario can\nquantitatively explain the observed HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios. We also find\nthat the majority of HDO and D2O ices are likely formed in cold\nprestellar/protostellar cores rather than in molecular clouds, where the\nmajority of H2O ice is formed. This work demonstrates the power of the\ncombination of the HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios as a tool to reveal the past\nhistory of water ice formation in the early cold stages of star formation and\nwhen the enrichment of deuterium in the bulk of water occurred. Further\nobservations are needed to explore if the relation, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is\ncommon in low-mass protostellar sources.\n", "  We reconsider the force-balance relation on an isolated vortex in the flux\nflow state within the scheme of time-dependent-Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation.\nWe define force on the vortex by the total force on superconducting electrons\nin the region $S$ surrounding the vortex. We derive the local momentum balance\nrelation of superconducting electrons and then find the force-balance relation\non isolated vortex with taking account of the fact that the transport current\nin charged superconductors are inherently spatially varying with the scale of\npenetration depth $\\lambda$. We also find that nature of the driving force is\nhydrodynamic when $S$ is the disk with radius $R$ satisfying $\\xi\\ll R\\ll\n\\lambda$ ($\\xi$ is the coherence length) while the hydrodynamic and magnetic\nparts contribute equally to the driving force for $\\lambda \\lesssim R$.\n", "  The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light and matter waves is a parameter\nthat is getting increasingly more attention over the past couple of years.\nBeams with a well defined OAM, the so-called vortex beams, are applied already\nin e.g. telecommunication, astrophysics, nanomanipulation and chiral\nmeasurements in optics and electron microscopy. Also the OAM of a wave induced\nby the interaction with a sample, shows great potential of interest. In all\nthese experiments it is crucial to measure the exact (local) OAM content of the\nwave, whether it is an incoming vortex beam or an exit wave after interacting\nwith a sample. In this work we investigate the use of spiral phase plates as an\nalternative to the programmable phase plates used in optics to measure OAM. We\nderive analytically how these can be used to study the local OAM components of\nany wave function. By means of numerical simulations we illustrate how the OAM\nof a pure vortex beam can be measured. We also look at a sum of misaligned\nvortex beams and show how using SPPs the position and the OAM of each\nindividual beam can be detected. Finally we look at the OAM induced by a\nmagnetic dipole on a free electron wave and show how the SPP can be used to\nlocalize the magnetic poles and measure their \"magnetic charge\".\n  Although our findings can be applied to study the OAM of any wave function,\nthey are of particular interest for electron microscopy where versatile\nprogrammable phase plates do not yet exist.\n", "  Spectral characterization of young, giant exoplanets detected by direct\nimaging is one of the tasks of the new generation of high-contrast imagers. For\nthis purpose, the VLT/SPHERE instrument includes a unique long-slit\nspectroscopy (LSS) mode coupled with Lyot coronagraphy in its infrared\ndual-band imager and spectrograph (IRDIS). The performance of this mode is\nintrinsically limited by the use of a non-optimal coronagraph, but in a\nprevious work we demonstrated that it could be significantly improved at small\ninner-working angles using the stop-less Lyot coronagraph (SLLC). We now\npresent the development, testing, and validation of the first SLLC prototype\nfor VLT/SPHERE. Based on the transmission profile previously proposed, the\nprototype was manufactured using microdots technology and was installed inside\nthe instrument in 2014. The transmission measurements agree well with the\nspecifications, except in the very low transmissions (<5% in amplitude). The\nperformance of the SLLC is tested in both imaging and spectroscopy using data\nacquired on the internal source. In imaging, we obtain a raw contrast gain of a\nfactor 10 at 0.3\" and 5 at 0.5\" with the SLLC. Using data acquired with a\nfocal-plane mask, we also demonstrate that no Lyot stop is required to reach\nthe full performance, which validates the SLLC concept. Comparison with a\nrealistic simulation model shows that we are currently limited by the internal\nphase aberrations of SPHERE. In spectroscopy, we obtain a gain of ~1 mag in a\nlimited range of angular separations. Simulations show that although the main\nlimitation comes from phase errors, the performance in the non-SLLC case is\nvery close to the ultimate limit of the LSS mode. Finally, we obtain the very\nfirst on-sky data with the SLLC, which appear extremely promising for the\nfuture scientific exploitation of an apodized LSS mode in SPHERE.\n", "  We consider the phenomenology of a resonance that couples to photons but not\ngluons, and estimate its production rate at the LHC from photon-photon fusion\nin elastic pp scattering using the effective photon and narrow width\napproximations. The rate is sensitive only to the mass, the spin, the total\nwidth of the resonance, and its branching fraction to photons. Production cross\nsections of 5-10 fb at 13 TeV can be easily accommodated for a 750 GeV\nresonance with partial photon width of 15 GeV. This provides the minimal\nexplanation of the reported diphoton anomaly in the early LHC Run II data.\n", "  We study quasinormal modes of black holes in Lovelock gravity. We formulate\nthe WKB method adapted to Lovelock gravity for the calculation of quasinormal\nfrequencies (QNFs). As a demonstration, we calculate various QNFs of Lovelock\nblack holes in seven and eight dimensions. We find that the QNFs show\nremarkable features depending on the coefficients of the Lovelock terms, the\nspecies of perturbations, and spacetime dimensions. In the case of the scalar\nfield, when we increase the coefficient of the third order Lovelock term, the\nreal part of QNFs increases, but the decay rate becomes small irrespective of\nthe mass of the black hole. For small black holes, the decay rate ceases to\ndepend on the Gauss-Bonnet term. In the case of tensor type perturbations of\nthe metric field, the tendency of the real part of QNFs is opposite to that of\nthe scalar field. The QNFs of vector type perturbations of the metric show no\nparticular behavior. The behavior of QNFs of the scalar type perturbations of\nthe metric field is similar to the vector type. However, available data are\nrather sparse, which indicates that the WKB method is not applicable to many\nmodels for this sector.\n", "  Precise polarisation measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nrequire accurate knowledge of the instrument orientation relative to the sky\nframe used to define the cosmological Stokes parameters. Suitable celestial\ncalibration sources that could be used to measure the polarimeter orientation\nangle are limited, so current experiments commonly `self-calibrate.' The\nself-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $EB$ and $TB$\ncross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model, so any\ndetected $EB$ and $TB$ signals must be due to systematic errors. However, this\nassumption neglects the fact that polarized Galactic foregrounds in a given\nportion of the sky may have non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ cross-spectra. If these\nforeground signals remain in the observations, then they will bias the\nself-calibrated telescope polarisation angle and produce a spurious $B$-mode\nsignal. In this paper we estimate the foreground-induced bias for various\ninstrument configurations and then expand the self-calibration formalism to\naccount for polarized foreground signals. Assuming the $EB$ correlation signal\nfor dust is in the range constrained by angular power spectrum measurements\nfrom Planck at 353 GHz (scaled down to 150 GHz), then the bias is negligible\nfor high angular resolution experiments, which have access to CMB-dominated\nhigh $\\ell$ modes with which to self-calibrate. Low-resolution experiments\nobserving particularly dusty sky patches can have a bias as large as\n$0.5^\\circ$. A miscalibration of this magnitude generates a spurious $BB$\nsignal corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of approximately\n$r\\sim2\\times10^{-3}$, within the targeted range of planned experiments.\n", "  The magnetic properties of the layered oxypnictide LaMnAsO have been\nrevisited using neutron scattering and magnetization measurements. The present\nmeasurements identify the N\\'{e}el temperature $T_N$ = 360(1) K. Below $T_N$\nthe critical exponent describing the magnetic order parameter is $\\beta$ =\n0.33$-$0.35, consistent with a three dimensional Heisenberg model. Above this\ntemperature, diffuse magnetic scattering indicative of short-range magnetic\norder is observed, and this scattering persists up to $T_{SRO}$ = 650(10) K.\nThe magnetic susceptibility shows a weak anomaly at $T_{SRO}$ and no anomaly at\n$T_N$. Analysis of the diffuse scattering data using a reverse Monte Carlo\nalgorithm indicates that above $T_N$ nearly two- dimensional, short-range\nmagnetic order is present with a correlation length of 9.3(3) {\\AA} within the\nMn layers at 400 K. The inelastic scattering data reveal a spin-gap of 3.5 meV\nin the long-range ordered state, and strong, low-energy (quasi-elastic)\nmagnetic excitations emerging in the short-range ordered state. Comparison with\nother related compounds correlates the distortion of the Mn coordination\ntetrahedra to the sign of the magnetic exchange along the layer-stacking\ndirection, and suggests that short-range order above $T_N$ is a common feature\nin the magnetic behavior of layered Mn-based pnictides and oxypnictides.\n", "  A recent claim of possible superfluid behaviour of parahydrogen films\nintercalated within a crystalline matrix of Na atoms is examined. Quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations at finite temperature yield strong numerical evidence that\nthe system forms at low temperature a non-superfluid crystalline phase,\ncommensurate with the underlying impurity lattice. The physics of this system\nis therefore qualitatively identical to that observed in similar settings,\nextensively studied in precedence. Comparison of numerical results obtained\nhere, with those of the reference in which the prediction of superfluidity\n(disproven here) was made, points to likely bias in the computational\nmethodology adopted therein.\n", "  The internal stability of the electron has been debated for a century at both\nthe classical and the quantum level. Recently, a local force density balance\nwas established for the 1s electron in the H atom, based on the energy-momentum\ntensor of the classical Dirac field. This methodology is now extended to\nquantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum\npolarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any\ncharged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal\nstructure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization\ninduced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point\ncharge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and\ndegeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are\nbalanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The\nforce densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac\nsea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha,\nthe force densities remain balanced. This result establishes a local force\nbalance for a prototypical manybody system.\n", "  Understanding the duration of past, on-going and future volcanic eruptions is\nan important scientific goal and a key societal need. We present a new\nmethodology for forecasting the duration of on-going and future lava dome\neruptions based on a database (DomeHaz) recently compiled by the authors. The\ndatabase includes duration and composition for 177 such eruptions, with\n\"eruption\" defined as the period encompassing individual episodes of dome\ngrowth along with associated quiescent periods during which extrusion pauses\nbut unrest continues. In a key finding we show that probability distributions\nfor dome eruption durations are both heavy-tailed and composition-dependent. We\nconstruct Objective Bayes statistical models featuring heavy-tailed Generalized\nPareto distributions with composition-specific parameters to make forecasts\nabout the durations of new and on-going eruptions that depend on both eruption\nduration-to-date and composition. Our Bayesian predictive distributions reflect\nboth uncertainty about model parameter values (epistemic uncertainty) and the\nnatural variability of the geologic processes (aleatoric uncertainty). The\nresults are illustrated by presenting likely trajectories for fourteen\ndome-building eruptions on-going in 2015. Full representation of the\nuncertainty is presented for two key eruptions, Soufri{\\'{e}}re Hills Volcano\nin Montserrat (10--139 years, median 35yr) and Sinabung, Indonesia (1--17\nyears, median 4yr). Uncertainties are high, but, importantly, quantifiable.\nThis work provides for the first time a quantitative and transferable method\nand rationale on which to base long-term planning decisions for lava dome\nforming volcanoes, with wide potential use and transferability to forecasts of\nother types of eruptions and other adverse events across the geohazard\nspectrum.\n", "  Because isolated high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are found at great distances\nfrom the Galactic radiation field and because they have subsolar metallicities,\nthere have been no detections of dust in these structures. A key problem in\nthis search is the removal of foreground dust emission. Using the\nEffelsberg-Bonn HI Survey and the Planck far-infrared data, we investigate a\nbright, cold, and clumpy HVC. This cloud apparently undergoes an interaction\nwith the ambient medium and thus has great potential to form dust. To remove\nthe local foreground dust emission we used a regularised, generalised linear\nmodel and we show the advantages of this approach with respect to other\nmethods. To estimate the dust emissivity of the HVC, we set up a simple\nBayesian model with mildly informative priors to perform the line fit instead\nof an ordinary linear least-squares approach. We find that the foreground can\nbe modelled accurately and robustly with our approach and is limited mostly by\nthe cosmic infrared background. Despite this improvement, we did not detect any\nsignificant dust emission from this promising HVC. The 3-sigma upper limit to\nthe dust emissivity is an order of magnitude below the typical values for the\nGalactic interstellar medium.\n", "  A manifestly T-dual invariant formulation of bosonic string theory is\ndiscussed here. It can be obtained by making both the usual string compact\ncoordinates and their duals explicitly appear, on the same footing, in the\nworld-sheet action. A peculiarity of such a model is the loss of the local\nLorentz invariance which is required to be recovered on-shell. This dictates a\nconstraint on the backgrounds which characterizes the double geometry of the\ntarget space. Constant and non-constant backgrounds are considered. In the\nformer case, the local Lorentz constraint implies the geometry of a double\ntorus with an $O(D,D)$ invariance. In the latter, it is shown how and when the\n$O(D,D)$ invariance still holds and when deformations from it can be implied.\nResults of the quantization of the free theory are also briefly exhibited.\n", "  We discuss the idea of maximal jets introduced by Falcke & Biermann in 1995.\nAccording to it, the maximum possible jet power in its internal energy equals\nthe kinetic power in its rest mass. We show this result is incorrect because of\nan unfortunate algebraic mistake.\n", "  We discuss a stochastic model for the behavior of electrons in a magnetically\nconfined plasma having axial symmetry. The aim of the work is to provide an\nexplanation for the density limit observed in the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade\nmachine. The dynamical framework deals with an electron embedded in a\nstationary and uniform magnetic field and affected by an orthogonal random\nelectric field. The behavior of the average plasma profile is determined by the\nappropriate Fokker-Planck equation associated to the considered model and the\ndisruptive effects of the stochastic electric field is shown. The comparison\nbetween the addressed model and the experimental data allows to fix the\nrelevant spatial scale of such a stochastic field. It is found to be of the\norder of the Tokamak micro-physics scale, i.e. few millimeters. Moreover, it is\nclarified how the diffusion process outlines a dependence on the magnetic field\nas $\\sim B^{-3/2}$.\n", "  (Abridged) Aims. We derive the physical properties of a filament discovered\nin the dark cometary-shaped cloud L1251. Methods. Mapping observations in the\nNH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines, encompassing 300 positions toward L1251,\nwere performed with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope at a spatial resolution of\n40 arcsec and a spectral resolution of 0.045 km/s. Results. The filament L1251A\nconsists of three condensations (alpha, beta, and gamma) of elongated\nmorphology, which are combined in a long and narrow structure covering a 38\narcmin by 3 arcmin angular range. The opposite chirality (dextral and\nsinistral) of the alpha+beta and gamma condensations indicates magnetic field\nhelicities of two types, negative and positive, which were most probably caused\nby dynamo mechanisms. We estimated the magnetic Reynolds number Rm > 600 and\nthe Rossby number R < 1, which means that dynamo action is important.\n", "  We perform path integral Monte Carlo simulations to study the imaginary time\ndynamics of metastable supercooled superfluid states and nearly superglassy\nstates of a one component fluid of spinless bosons square wells. Our study\nshows that the identity of the particles and the exchange symmetry is crucial\nfor the frustration necessary to obtain metastable states in the quantum\nregime. Whereas the simulation time has to be chosen to determine whether we\nare in a metastable state or not, the imaginary time dynamics tells us if we\nare or not close to an arrested glassy state.\n", "  We present ALMA detections of the [NII] 205$\\mu$m and CO(12-11) emission\nlines, and the tentative detection of [CI] $^3$P$_1$ - $^3$P$_0$ for the\nstrongly lensed ($\\mu$=5.7$\\pm$0.5) dusty, star-forming galaxy SPT-S\nJ213242-5802.9 (hereafter SPT2132-58) at z=4.77. The [NII] and CO(12-11) lines\nare detected at 11.5 and 8.5 $\\sigma$ level, respectively, by our band-6\nobservations. The [CI] line is detected at 3.2 $\\sigma$ after a re-analysis of\nexisting band-3 data. The [CI] luminosity implies a gas mass of\n3.8$\\pm$1.2$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, and consequently a very short depletion\ntimescale of 34$\\pm$13 Myr and a CO-luminosity-to-gas-mass conversion factor\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ of 1.0$\\pm$0.3 M$_\\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$.\nSPT2132-58 is an extreme starburst with an intrinsic star formation rate of\n1100$\\pm$200 M$_\\odot$/yr. We find a [CII]/[NII] ratio of 26$\\pm$7, which is\nthe highest reported at z$>$4. This suggests that SPT2132-58 hosts an evolved\ninterstellar medium (0.5 Z$_\\odot$<Z<1.5 Z$_\\odot$), which may be dominated by\nphotodissociation regions. The CO(2-1) and CO(5-4) transitions have lower\nCO-to-far-infrared ratios than local and high-redshift samples, while CO(12-11)\nis similar to these samples, suggesting the presence of an additional very\nexcited component or an AGN.\n", "  High contact resistances have blocked the progress of devices based on MX2 (M\n= Mo,W; X = S,Se,Te) 2D semiconductors. Interface states formed at MX2/metal\ncontacts pin the Fermi level, leading to sizable Schottky barriers for p-type\ncontacts in particular. We show that (i) one can remove the interface states by\ncovering the metal by a 2D layer, which is van der Waals-bonded to the MX2\nlayer, and (ii) one can choose the buffer layer such, that it yields a p-type\ncontact with a zero Schottky barrier height. We identify possible buffer layers\nsuch as graphene, a monolayer of h-BN, or an oxide layer with a high electron\naffinity, such as MoO3. The most elegant solution is a metallic M'X'2 layer\nwith a high work function. A NbS2 monolayer adsorbed on a metal yields a high\nwork function contact, irrespective of the metal, which gives a barrierless\ncontact to all MX2 layers.\n", "  For discrete-state stochastic systems obeying Markovian dynamics, we\nestablish the counterpart of the conditional reversibility theorem obtained by\nGallavotti for deterministic systems [Ann. de l'Institut Henri Poincar\\'e (A)\n70, 429 (1999)]. Our result states that stochastic trajectories conditioned on\nopposite values of entropy production are related by time reversal, in the\nlong-time limit. In other words, the probability of observing a particular\nsequence of events, given a long trajectory with a specified entropy production\nrate $\\sigma$, is the same as the probability of observing the time-reversed\nsequence of events, given a trajectory conditioned on the opposite entropy\nproduction, $-\\sigma$, where both trajectories are sampled from the same\nunderlying Markov process. To obtain our result, we use an equivalence between\nconditioned (\"microcanonical\") and biased (\"canonical\") ensembles of\nnonequilibrium trajectories. We provide an example to illustrate our findings.\n", "  A solid wooden cube fragments into pieces as we sequentially drill holes\nthrough it randomly. This seemingly straightforward observation encompasses\ndeep and nontrivial geometrical and probabilistic behavior that is discussed\nhere. Combining numerical simulations and rigorous results, we find\noff-critical scale-free behavior and a continuous transition at a critical\ndensity of holes that significantly differs from classical percolation.\n", "  We achieve the enhancement of circular photogalvanic effect arising from the\nphoto-injection of spins in topological insulator thin films by tuning the\nFermi level ($E_{\\rm F}$). A series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films\nwere tailored so that the Fermi energy ranges above 0.34 eV to below 0.29 eV of\nthe Dirac point, i.e., from the bulk conduction band bottom to the valence band\ntop through the bulk in-gap surface-Dirac cone. The circular photogalvanic\ncurrent, indicating a flow of spin-polarized surface-Dirac electrons, shows a\npronounced peak when the $E_{\\rm F}$ is set near the Dirac point and is also\ncorrelated with the carrier mobility. Our observation reveals that there are\nsubstantial scatterings between the surface-Dirac and bulkstate electrons in\nthe generation process of spin-polarized photocurrent, which can be avoided by\ndesigning the electronic structure in topological insulators.\n", "  It was shown recently that the constraints on the initial data for Einstein's\nequations may be posed as an evolutionary problem [9]. In one of the proposed\ntwo methods the constraints can be replaced by a first order symmetrizable\nhyperbolic system and a subsidiary algebraic relation. Here, by assuming that\nthe initial data surface is smoothly foliated by a one-parameter family of\ntopological two-spheres, the basic variables are recast in terms of\nspin-weighted fields. This allows one to replace all the angular derivatives in\nthe evolutionary system by the Newman-Penrose $\\eth$ and $\\bar{\\eth}$ operators\nwhich, in turn, opens up a new avenue to solve the constraints by integrating\nthe resulting system using suitable numerical schemes. In particular, by\nreplacing the $\\eth$ and $\\bar{\\eth}$ operators either by a finite difference\nor by a pseudo-spectral representation or by applying a spectral decomposition\nin terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, the evolutionary equations may\nbe put into the form of a coupled system of non-linear ordinary differential\nequations.\n", "  The model independent measurement of the absolute ZH cross section of the\nHiggsstrahlung process e+e- -> ZH is an unique measurement at the ILC\nindispensable for measuring the Higgs couplings and their deviations from the\nStandard Model in order to identify new physics models. The performance in\nmeasuring the ZH cross section using events in which the Higgs boson recoils\nagainst a Z boson which decays into a pair of muons or electrons has been\ndemonstrated based on full simulation of the ILD detector for three center of\nmass energies 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations (Pe-,Pe+)\n=(-80%, +30%) and (+80%, -30%). This paper demonstrates in detail that the\nanalysis which achieved these results are model independent to the sub-percent\nlevel. Data selection methods are designed to optimize the precisions of the ZH\ncross section and at the same time minimize the bias on the measured due to\ndiscrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs decay modes. Under conservative\nassumptions which take into account unknown Higgs decay modes, the relative\nbias on the ZH cross section is shown to be smaller than 0.2% for all\ncenter-of-mass energies, which is five times below even the smallest ZH cross\nsection statistical uncertainties expected from the leptonic recoil\nmeasurements in a full 20 years ILC physics program.\n", "  Minimum model calculations on the co-action of hole vanishing Lifshitz\ntransitions and correlation effects in ferropnictides are presented. The\ncalculations predict non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and huge mass enhancements of\nthe charge carriers at the Fermi level. The findings are compared with recent\nARPES experiments and with measurements of transport and thermal properties of\nferropnictides. The results from the calculation can be also applied to other\nunconventional superconductors and question the traditional view of quantum\ncritical points.\n", "  The Fock expansion [1] describes the $S$-state wave function of the\ntwo-electron atomic system in the vicinity of the triple coalescence point. The\npresent work constitutes the additional appendix to our paper [2] devoted to\nrefinement and further development of calculation of the angular Fock\ncoefficients of the Fock expansion. We derive the explicit analytic expressions\nfor the complicated subcomponents $\\psi_{4,1}^{(2d)}$ and $\\psi_{3,0}^{(2c)}$\nof the angular Fock coefficients. An unusual method of using the Wolfram\nMathematica was applied.\n", "  The growth of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z > 6 is still a\nmajor challenge for theoretical models. If it starts from black hole (BH)\nremnants of Population III stars (light seeds with mass ~ 100 Msun) it requires\nsuper-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from heavy seeds\nformed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10^5 Msun BH. Here we investigate\nthe relative role of light and heavy seeds as BH progenitors of the first\nSMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model\nGAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z > 6\nquasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and heavy seeds\nin the progenitor galaxies, we find that the formation of a few heavy seeds\n(between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth\nof SMBHs at z > 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between\nchemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the\nconditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas\n(Z < Zcr and JLW > Jcr). We find that heavy seeds can not form if dust cooling\ntriggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D > Dcr).\nIn addition, the relative importance of light and heavy seeds depends on the\nadopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of\ncold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.\n", "  Simple relations for deriving the oxygen abundance in HII regions with\nintensities of the three strong emission lines R_2, R_3, and N_2 (R\ncalibration) or S_2, R_3, and N_2 (S calibration) in their spectra are\nsuggested. A sample of 313 reference HII regions of the counterpart method is\nused as calibrating data points. Relations for the determination of nitrogen\nabundances, the R calibration, are also constructed. We find that the oxygen\nand nitrogen abundances in high-metallicity HII regions can be estimated using\nthe intensities of the two strong lines R_2 and N_2 (or S_2 and N_2 for oxygen)\nonly. The corresponding two-dimensional relations are provided. There are\nconsiderable advantages of the suggested calibration relations as compared to\nthe existing ones. First, the oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through\nthe suggested calibrations agree with the Te-based abundances within ~0.1 dex\nover the whole metallicity range, i.e., the relative accuracy of the\ncalibration-based abundances is 0.1 dex. Although we constructed distinct\nrelations for high- and low-metallicity objects, the separation between these\ntwo can be simply obtained from the intensity of the N_2 line. Moreover, the\napplicability ranges of the high- and low-metallicity relations overlap for\nadjacent metallicities, i.e., the transition zone disappears. Second, the\noxygen abundances produced by the two suggested calibrations are in remarkable\nagreement with each other. In fact, the R-based and S-based oxygen abundances\nagree within ~0.05 dex in the majority of cases for more than three thousand\nHII region spectra.\n", "  Two-dimensional Scarf~II quantum model is considered in the framework of\nSupersymmetrical Quantum Mechanics (SUSY QM). Previously obtained results for\nthis integrable system are systematized, and some new properties are derived.\nIn particular, it is shown that the model is exactly or quasi-exactly solvable\nin different regions of parameter of the system. The degeneracy of the spectrum\nis detected for some specific values of parameters. The action of the symmetry\noperators of fourth order in momenta is calculated for the arbitrary wave\nfunctions, obtained by means of double shape invariance.\n", "  Non hermitian Hamiltonians play an important role in the study of dissipative\nquantum systems. We show that using states with time dependent normalization\ncan simplify the description of such systems especially in the context of the\nclassical limit. We apply this prescription to study the damped harmonic\noscillator system. This is then used to study the problem of radiation in leaky\ncavity.\n", "  Spontaneously evolving living systems can be modelled as continuous-time\ndynamical systems (DSs), whose evolution rules are determined by their velocity\nvector fields. We point out that because of their architectural plasticity,\nbiological neural networks belong to a novel type of DSs whose velocity field\nis plastic, albeit within bounds, and affected by sensory stimuli. We introduce\nDSs with fully plastic velocity fields self-organising under the influence of\nstimuli, called self-shaping DSs, and propose that a system of this class\nrepresents a conceptual model of a cognitive system. We propose a simple\nphenomenological model that within a single field-shaping mechanism carries out\na set of essential cognitive functions without any supervision and online, just\nlike living cognitive systems do. The performance of this model is illustrated\nexperimentally with musical examples. Unlike in artificial neural networks,\nthis mechanism does not produce spurious attractors and in principle does not\nlimit memory size. Implementation of this principle could pave the way to\ncreating artificial intelligent devices of a new type.\n", "  It is proposed that the rate of relaxation in a liquid is better described by\nthe geometric mean of the van Hove distribution function, rather than the\nstandard arithmetic mean used to obtain the mean squared displacement. The\ndifference between the two means is shown to increase significantly with an\nincrease in the non-Gaussian character of the displacement distribution.\nPreliminary results indicate that the geometric diffusion constant results in a\nsubstantial reduction of the deviation from Stokes-Einstein scaling.\n", "  This is a survey of our program of perturbative quantization of gauge\ntheories on manifolds with boundary compatible with cutting/pasting and with\ngauge symmetry treated by means of a cohomological resolution\n(Batalin-Vilkovisky) formalism. We also give two explicit quantum examples --\nabelian BF theory and the Poisson sigma model. This exposition is based on a\ntalk by P.M. at the ICMP 2015 in Santiago de Chile.\n", "  We present a new geometrical method aimed at determining the members of open\nclusters. The methodology estimates, in an N-dimensional space, the membership\nprobabilities by means of the distances between every star and the cluster\ncentral overdensity. It can handle different sets of variables, which have to\nsatisfy the simple condition of being more densely distributed for the cluster\nmembers than for the field stars (as positions, proper motions, radial\nvelocities and/or parallaxes are). Unlike other existing techniques, this fact\nmakes the method more flexible and so can be easily applied to different\ndatasets. To quantify how the method identifies the clus- ter members, we\ndesign series of realistic simulations recreating sky regions in both position\nand proper motion subspaces populated by clusters and field stars. The re-\nsults, using different simulated datasets (N = 1, 2 and 4 variables), show that\nthe method properly recovers a very high fraction of simulated cluster members,\nwith a low number of misclassified stars. To compare the goodness of our\nmethodology, we also run other existing algorithms on the same simulated data.\nThe results show that our method has a similar or even better performance than\nthe other techniques. We study the robustness of the new methodology from\ndifferent subsamplings of the ini- tial sample, showing a progressive\ndeterioration of the capability of our method as the fraction of missing\nobjects increases. Finally, we apply all the methodologies to the real cluster\nNGC 2682, indicating that our methodology is again in good agreement with\npreceding studies.\n", "  Closed system of time equations for nonrelativistic gravitation field and\nhydrodynamic medium was obtained by taking into account binary correlations of\nthe field, which is the generalization of Jeans theory. Distribution function\nof the systemwas built on the basis of the Bogolyubov reduced description\nmethod. Calculations were carried out up to the first order of a perturbation\ntheory in interaction. Adiabatic and enthropic types of perturbations were\ncorrected and two new types of perturbations were found.\n", "  Nonlinear phenomena of lepton-photon interactions in external backgrounds\nwith a generalised periodic plane-wave geometry are studied. We discuss\nnonlinear Compton scattering in head-on lepton-photon collisions extended\nproperly to beyond the soft-photon regime. In addition, our results are applied\nto stimulated lepton-antilepton pair production in photon collisions with\nunrestricted energies. Derivations are considered semi-classically based on\nunperturbed fermionic Volkov representations encoding the full interaction with\nthe background field. Closed expressions for total probabilities considering\nS-matrix elements have been derived. The general formula is applied to Compton\nscattering by an electron propagating in an external laser-like background. We\nobtain additive contributions in the extended unconstrained result which turns\nout to be stringently required in the highly nonlinear regime. A detailed\ncomparison of contributing harmonics is discussed for various field parameters.\n", "  Changing someone's opinion is arguably one of the most important challenges\nof social interaction. The underlying process proves difficult to study: it is\nhard to know how someone's opinions are formed and whether and how someone's\nviews shift. Fortunately, ChangeMyView, an active community on Reddit, provides\na platform where users present their own opinions and reasoning, invite others\nto contest them, and acknowledge when the ensuing discussions change their\noriginal views. In this work, we study these interactions to understand the\nmechanisms behind persuasion.\n  We find that persuasive arguments are characterized by interesting patterns\nof interaction dynamics, such as participant entry-order and degree of\nback-and-forth exchange. Furthermore, by comparing similar counterarguments to\nthe same opinion, we show that language factors play an essential role. In\nparticular, the interplay between the language of the opinion holder and that\nof the counterargument provides highly predictive cues of persuasiveness.\nFinally, since even in this favorable setting people may not be persuaded, we\ninvestigate the problem of determining whether someone's opinion is susceptible\nto being changed at all. For this more difficult task, we show that stylistic\nchoices in how the opinion is expressed carry predictive power.\n", "  The evolved, massive highly eccentric binary system, eta Carinae, underwent a\nperiastron passage in the summer of 2014. We obtained two coordinated X-ray\nobservations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during the elevated X-ray flux state\nand just before the X-ray minimum flux state around this passage. These NuSTAR\nobservations clearly detected X-ray emission associated with eta Car extending\nup to ~50 keV for the first time. The NuSTAR spectrum above 10 keV can be fit\nwith the bremsstrahlung tail from a kT ~6 keV plasma. This temperature is Delta\nkT ~2 keV higher than those measured from the iron K emission line complex, if\nthe shocked gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium. This result may\nsuggest that the companion star's pre-shock wind velocity is underestimated.\nThe NuSTAR observation near the X-ray minimum state showed a gradual decline in\nthe X-ray emission by 40% at energies above 5 keV in a day, the largest rate of\nchange of the X-ray flux yet observed in individual eta Car observations. The\ncolumn density to the hardest emission component, NH ~1e24 cm-2, marked one of\nthe highest values ever observed for eta Car, strongly suggesting increased\nobscuration of the wind-wind colliding X-ray emission by the thick primary\nstellar wind prior to superior conjunction. Neither observation detected the\npower-law component in the extremely hard band that INTEGRAL and Suzaku\nobserved prior to 2011. If the non-detection by NuSTAR is caused by absorption,\nthe power-law source must be small and located very near the WWC apex.\nAlternatively, it may be that the power-law source is not related to either eta\nCar or the GeV gamma-ray source.\n", "  A model for gravitational collapse where the event horizon is a quantum\ncritical phase transition is extended to provide an explanation for the origin\nof the observable universe, where the expanding universe that we observe today\nwas proceeded by a flat universe with a negative cosmological constant. In\nprincipal this allows one derive all the features of our universe from a single\nparameter: the magnitude of the pre-big bang negative vacuum energy density. In\nthis paper a simple model for the big bang is introduced which allows us to\nrelate the present day energy density and temperature fluctuations of the CMB,\nto the present day density of dark matter. This model for the big bang also\nmakes a dramatic prediction: dark matter mostly consists of compact objects\nwith a masses on the order of 10^4 solar masses. Remarkably this is consistent\nwith numerical simulations for how primordial fluctuations in the density of\ndark give rise to the observed inhomogeneous distribution of matter in our\nuniverse. Our model for the big bang also allows for the production of some\ncompact objects with masses greater than 10^4 solar masses, which is consistent\nwith numerical simulations of structure formation which require massive\nprimordial comapact objects as the seeds for galaxies in order to explain\ngalactic morphologies.\n", "  I clarify the differences between various approaches in the literature which\nattempt to link gravity and thermodynamics. I then describe a new perspective\nbased on the following features: (1) As in the case of any other matter field,\nthe gravitational field equations should also remain unchanged if a constant is\nadded to the Lagrangian; in other words, the field equations of gravity should\nremain invariant under the transformation $T^a_b \\to T^a_b + \\delta^a_b\n$(constant). (2) Each event of spacetime has a certain number ($f$) of\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom (`atoms of spacetime'). This quantity $f$ is\nproportional to the area measure of an equi-geodesic surface, centered at that\nevent, when the geodesic distance tends to zero. The spacetime should have a\nzero-point length in order for $f$ to remain finite. (3) The dynamics is\ndetermined by extremizing the heat density at all events of the spacetime. The\nheat density is the sum of a part contributed by matter and a part contributed\nby the atoms of spacetime, with the latter being $L_P^{-4} f$. The implications\nof this approach are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we formulate a regular $q$-fractional Sturm--Liouville problem\n(qFSLP) which includes the left-sided Riemann--Liouville and the right-sided\nCaputo q-fractional derivatives of the same order $\\alpha$, $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$.\nThe properties of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are investigated. A\n$q$-fractional version of the Wronskian is defined and its relation to the\nsimplicity of the eigenfunctions is verified. We use the fixed point theorem to\nintroduce a sufficient condition on eigenvalues for the existence and\nuniqueness of the associated eigenfunctions when $\\alpha>1/2$. These results\nare a generalization of the integer regular $q$-Sturm--Liouville problem\nintroduced by Annaby and Mansour in[1]. An example for a qFSLP whose\neigenfunctions are little $q$-Jacobi polynomials is introduced.\n", "  We have studied the hidden long-range order (LRO) of the frustrated\npyrochlore magnet Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by means of specific-heat experiments and\nMonte-Carlo (MC) simulations, which has been discussed as the LRO of quadrupole\nmoments inherent to the non-Kramers ion of Tb$^{3+}$. We have found that the\nsharp specific-heat peak is collapsed into a broad hump by magnetic fields\nabove 0.3 T for $H//[001]$. This result, qualitatively reproduced by MC\nsimulations, suggests that a field-induced magnetic state overcomes the\nquadrupolar LRO state, as a similar case of a classical spin ice. The present\nresults support the interpretation that Tb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ is a\nunique material in the boundary between the quadrupolar ($x \\geq x_c =\n-0.0025$) and spin-liquid ($x \\leq x_c$) states, where the magnetic field along\nthe [001] axis is a tuning parameter which induces the magnetic ordered state.\n", "  Coronary stents have changed the way in which coronary artery diseases are\nmanaged. Although bare-metal stents can be traced back to 1994, long term\nefficacy of these stents has been shattered by ISR (In-Stent restenosis) and\nlate stent thrombosis. Research on finding a solution to these issues has led\nto the development of DESs (Drug eluting stents). However long term\neffectiveness of DESs and various drug delivery systems have raised concerns.\nAlso current DESs does not have the capability to adjust the drug dose or\nrelease kinetics that corresponds to the diseased status of the affected\nvessel. Through the use of a drug delivery system which employs controlled drug\nrelease, it may be possible to control the release rate of the pharmacological\ndrugs or substances of interest, and therefore one might be able to circumvent\nthe range of events that leads to ISR, thus preventing the need for further\ninvasive interventions. To overcome the limitations of drug delivery systems,\nthe administration of drugs using nanoparticle based microcapsules as carriers\nis being researched for their ability to facilitate a sustained, prolonged and\ncontrolled release of drugs. But still much research is needed to evaluate and\nfix issues relating toxicity, chemical and mechanical properties of the\nnanoparticles. This project combines a range of nanobiotechnological techniques\nto synthesise nano-components which are finally assembled together to get the\nmicrocapsules which could be used in drug delivery systems. The microcapsules\nwere engineered keeping in mind their potential use in an ultrasound based drug\ndelivery system.\n", "  I review recent progress in the extraction of unpolarized parton\ndistributions in the proton and in nuclei from a unified point of view that\nhighlights how the interplay between high energy particle physics and lower\nenergy nuclear physics can be of mutual benefit to either field. Areas of\noverlap range from the search for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC,\nto the study of the non perturbative structure of nucleons and the emergence of\nnuclei from quark and gluon degrees of freedom, to the interaction of colored\nprobes in a cold nuclear medium.\n", "  In this paper it is performed the biomechanical analysis of Uchi Mata family,\nthe unifying vision of biomechanics let coaches and teachers to approach\ncompetition and lessons in different way. Uchi Mata and all throws that are in\nthe biomechanical group of Couple applied by trunk - leg showed that these most\neffective techniques in high level competition, are in fact also energetically\nless expensive than those of the Lever group. The overview of the sportive judo\nbooks that show the different kind of Uchi Mata, for example, are in term of\nBiomechanics always the same movement. The Japanese different vision informed\nalso the studies among the world that never analyzed the unifying vision. The\ncomplementary tools to increase the effectiveness are also analyzed and few New\nor Chaotic application of trunk-leg family. The Physical and biomechanical\nbackground is analyzed showing that these throws are also bio-mechanically\nsimpler, relying only on closing the distance and apply Couple . GAI plus\nCouple. Their intrinsic simplicity, however, hides a different complexity from\nthose of the Lever which, remember, they need a high motor coordination to be\neffective. In fact, being able to apply these techniques of Couple require a\nparticular timing ability.\n", "  In underdoped cuprate superconductors, a rich competition occurs between\nsuperconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) order. Whether rotational\nsymmetry breaking (nematicity) occurs intrinsically and generically or as a\nconsequence of other orders is under debate. Here we employ resonant x-ray\nscattering in stripe-ordered (La,M)_2CuO_4 to probe the relationship between\nelectronic nematicity of the Cu 3d orbitals, structure of the (La,M)_2O_2\nlayers, and CDW order. We find distinct temperature dependences for the\nstructure of the (La,M)_2O_2 layers and the electronic nematicity of the CuO_2\nplanes, with only the latter being enhanced by the onset of CDW order. These\nresults identify electronic nematicity as an order parameter that is distinct\nfrom a purely structural order parameter in underdoped striped cuprates.\n", "  Current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM) is regarded as a promising way\ntowards achieving emerging high-density, high-speed and low-power non-volatile\ndevices. Racetrack memory is an attractive spintronic memory based on this\nphenomenon, which can store and transfer a series of data along a magnetic\nnanowire. However, storage capacity issue is always one of the most serious\nbottlenecks hindering its application for practical systems. This paper focuses\non the potential of racetrack memory towards large capacity. The investigations\ncovering from device level to system level have been carried out. Various\nalternative mechanisms to improve the capacity of racetrack memory have been\nproposed and elucidated, e.g. magnetic field assistance, chiral DW motion and\nvoltage-controlled flexible DW pinning. All of them can increase nanowire\nlength, allowing enhanced feasibility of large-capacity racetrack memory. By\nusing SPICE compatible racetrack memory electrical model and commercial CMOS 28\nnm design kit, mixed simulations are performed to validate their\nfunctionalities and analyze their performance. System level evaluations\ndemonstrate the impact of capacity improvement on overall system. Compared with\ntraditional SRAM based cache, racetrack memory based cache shows its advantages\nin terms of execution time and energy consumption.\n", "  The entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism provides a useful framework\nfor constructing quantum error-correcting codes (QECC), which can transform\narbitrary classical linear codes into entanglement-assisted quantum error\ncorrecting codes (EAQECCs) by using pre-shared entanglement between the sender\nand the receiver. In this paper, we construct five classes of\nentanglement-assisted quantum MDS (EAQMDS) codes based on classical MDS codes\nby exploiting one or more pre-shared maximally entangled states. We show that\nthese EAQMDS codes have much larger minimum distance than the standard quantum\nMDS (QMDS) codes of the same length, and three classes of these EAQMDS codes\nconsume only one pair of maximally entangled states.\n", "  Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few\nyears, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow\namong many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such\ncompanies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful\nexamples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and\npolicy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence\nof Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a\nfalse dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any\nregulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no\nevidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from\nthe Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out\nwhere and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing\ninformation with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic\nconditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform.\nThe reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the\nyears. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional\nregulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why,\nfinally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are\nresponsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of\n\"algorithmic regulation\".\n", "  We present exact analytical solutions to the classical equations of motion\nand analyze the dynamical consequences of the existence of a minimal length for\nthe free particle, particle in a linear potential, anti-symmetric constant\nforce oscillator, harmonic oscillator, vertical harmonic oscillator, linear\ndiatomic chain, and linear triatomic chain. It turns out that a minimal length\nincreases the speed of a free particle and the rate of fall of a particle that\nis subject to the influence of a linear potential. Our results suggest that the\ncharacteristic frequency of systems tend to increase when there is a minimal\nlength. This is a common feature that we observed for the oscillator systems\nthat we have considered.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the reason for the diversity of interpretations of\nquantum mechanics is that they are not connected by continuity relations with\nclassical physics, and also the reason is the impossibility of operationalist\ndefinition of the vector of state. The problem lies in the incompatibility of\nthe philosophical foundations of interpretations, which results in the\ndifficulty of building a unified picture of the world. To solve the problem, we\nidentify general philosophical foundation of interpretations of quantum\nmechanics and built their classification. We also show that in more general\ntheories, the part of which is quantum mechanics, it is possible to integrate\n(reconcile) the philosophical foundations of interpretations.\n", "  A four-state clock ferromagnetic model is studied in the presence of\ndifferent configurations of anisotropies and random fields. The model is\nconsidered in the limit of infinite-range interactions, for which the\nmean-field approach becomes exact. Both representations of Cartesian spin\ncomponents and two Ising variables are used, in terms of which the physical\nproperties and phase diagrams are discussed. The random fields follow bimodal\nprobability distributions and the richest criticality is found when the fields,\napplied in the two Ising systems, are not correlated. The phase diagrams\npresent new interesting topologies, with a wide variety of critical\npoints,which are expected to be useful in describing different complex\nphenomena.\n", "  In many-body nonlinear systems with sufficient anharmonicity, a special kind\nof lattice vibrations, namely, Localized Anharmonic Vibrations (LAV) can be\nexcited either thermally or by external triggering, in which the amplitude of\natomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons)\nthat determine the system temperature. Coherency and persistence of LAV may\nhave drastic effect on chemical and nuclear reaction rates due to time-periodic\nmodulation of reaction sites. One example is a strong acceleration of chemical\nreaction rates driven by thermally-activated \"jumps\" over the reaction barrier\ndue to the time-periodic modulation of the barrier height in the LAV vicinity.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, the reaction rate is controlled by quantum\ntunneling through the barrier rather than by classical jumping over it. A giant\nincrease of sub-barrier transparency was demonstrated for a parabolic potential\nwell with the time-periodic eigenfrequency, when the modulation frequency\nexceeds the eigenfrequency by a factor of ~2 (parametric regime). Such regime\ncan be realized for a hydrogen or deuterium atom in metal hydrides/deuterides,\nsuch as NiH or PdD, in the vicinity of LAV. We present an analytical solution\nof the Schrodinger equation for a nonstationary harmonic oscillator, analyze\nthe parametric regime in details and discuss its applications to the tunnel\neffect and to D-D fusion in PdD lattice. We obtain simple analytical\nexpressions for the increase of amplitude and energy of zero-point oscillations\n(ZPO) induced by the parametric modulation. Based on that, we demonstrate a\ndrastic increase of the D-D fusion rate with in-creasing number of modulation\nperiods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account\nsuppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations.\n", "  We analyze an optical data cube of the nuclear region of NGC 3621, taken with\nthe integral field unit of the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph. We found that\nthe previously detected central line emission in this galaxy actually comes\nfrom a blob, located at a projected distance of 2.14\" +/- 0.08\" (70.1 +/- 2.6\npc) from the stellar nucleus. Only diffuse emission was detected in the rest of\nthe field of view, with a deficit of emission at the position of the stellar\nnucleus. Diagnostic diagram analysis reveals that the off-centered emitting\nblob has a Seyfert 2 spectrum. We propose that the line-emitting blob may be a\n\"fossil\" emission-line region or a light \"echo\" from an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN), which was significantly brighter in the past. Our estimates indicate\nthat the bolometric luminosity of the AGN must have decreased by a factor of\n~13 - 500 during the last ~230 years. A second scenario to explain the\nmorphology of the line-emitting areas in the nuclear region of NGC 3621\ninvolves no decrease of the AGN bolometric luminosity and establishes that the\nAGN is highly obscured toward the observer but not toward the line-emitting\nblob. The third scenario proposed here assumes that the off-centered\nline-emitting blob is a recoiling supermassive black hole, after the\ncoalescence of two black holes. Finally, an additional hypothesis is that the\ncentral X-ray source is not an AGN, but an X-ray binary. This idea is\nconsistent with all the scenarios we proposed.\n", "  Electronic structures associated with the flat (polar) Se/Te- or\nTl-terminated surfaces of TlBiSe$_2$ and TlBiTe$_2$ are predicted to harbor not\nonly Dirac cone states, but also trivial dangling bond states near the Fermi\nenergy. However, the latter, trivial states have never been observed in\nphotoemission measurements. In order to address this discrepancy, we have\ncarried out {\\it ab-initio} calculations for various surfaces of TlBiSe$_2$ and\nTlBiTe$_2$. A rough nonpolar surface with an equal number of Se/Te and Tl atoms\nin the surface atomic layer is found to destroy the trivial dangling bond\nstates, leaving only the Dirac cone states in the bulk energy gap. The\nresulting energy dispersions of the Dirac states are in good accord with the\ncorresponding experimental dispersions in TlBiSe$_2$ as well as TlBiTe$_2$. We\nalso show that in the case of flat, Se terminated, high-index (221) and (112)\nsurfaces of TlBiSe$_2$, the trivial surface states shift energetically below\nthe Dirac node and become well-separated from the Dirac cone states.\n", "  We have used the Union2.1 SNIa compilation to search for possible Hubble\nexpansion anisotropies, dividing the sky in 9 solid angles containing roughly\nthe same number of SNIa, as well as in the two Galactic hemispheres. We\nidentified only one sky region, containing 82 SNIa (~15% of total sample with\n$z>0.02$), that indeed appears to share a significantly different Hubble\nexpansion than the rest of the sample. However, this behavior appears to be\nattributed to the joint \"erratic\" behavior of only three SNIa and not to an\nanisotropic expansion. We also find that the northern and southern galactic\nhemispheres have different cosmological parameter solutions but still not\nsignificant enough to assert the detection of a Hubble expansion anisotropy. We\nconclude that even a few outliers can have such an effect as to induce\nartificial indications of anisotropies, when the number of analysed SNIa is\nrelatively small.\n", "  Kac--Moody groups $G$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ have been conjectured to occur as\nsymmetry groups of supergravity theories dimensionally reduced to dimensions\nless than 3, and their integral forms $G(\\mathbb{Z})$ conjecturally encode\nquantized symmetries. In this review paper, we briefly introduce the\nconjectural symmetries of Kac--Moody groups in supergravity as well as the\nknown evidence for these conjectures. We describe constructions of Kac--Moody\ngroups over $\\R$ and $\\Z$ using certain choices of fundamental modules that are\nconsidered to have physical relevance. Eisenstein series on certain finite\ndimensional algebraic groups are known to encode quantum corrections in the low\nenergy limit of superstring theories. We describe briefly how the construction\nof Eisenstein series extends to Kac--Moody groups. The constant terms of\nEisenstein series on $E_9$, $E_{10}$ and $E_{11}$ are predicted to encode\nperturbative string theory corrections.\n", "  III-Nitride quantum dots have emerged as a new chip-scale system for quantum\ninformation science, which combines electrical and optical interfaces on a\nsemiconductor chip that is compatible with non-cryogenic operating\ntemperatures. Yet most work has been limited to optical excitations. To enable\nsingle-spin based quantum optical and quantum information research, we\ndemonstrate here quantized charging in optically active, site-controlled\nIII-Nitride quantum dots. Single-electron charging was confirmed by the voltage\ndependence of the energy, dipole moment, fine structures and polarization\nproperties of the exciton states in the quantum dots. The fundamental energy\nstructures of the quantum dots were identified, including neutral and charged\nexcitons, fine structures of excitons, and A and B excitons. The results lay\nthe ground for coherent control of single charges in III-Nitride QDs, opening a\ndoor to III-Nitride based spintronics and spin-qubit quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  Critical exponent $\\eta$ (Fisher exponent) in $O(N)$-symmetric\n$\\varphi^4$-model was calculated using renormalization group approach in the\nspace of fixed dimension $D=2$ up to 6~loops. The calculation of the\nrenormalization constants was performed with the use of $R'$-operation and\nspecific values for diagrams were calculated in Feynman representation using\nsector decomposition method. Presented approach allows easy automation and\ngeneralization for the case of complex symmetries. Also a summation of the\nperturbation series was obtained by Borel transformation with conformal\nmapping. The contribution of the 6-th term of the series led to the increase of\nthe Fisher exponent in $O(1)$ model up to $8\\%$.\n", "  The concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeiglinger (C-GHZ) state which is a new\ntype of logic-qubit entanglement has attracted a lot of attentions recently. We\npresent a feasible entanglement concentration protocol (ECP) for logic-qubit\nentanglement. This ECP is based on the linear optics, and it does not know the\ninitial coefficients of the less-entangled C-GHZ state. This protocol can be\nextended to arbitrary C-GHZ state. This protocol may be useful in future\nquantum information processing tasks.\n", "  Rocket technology, originally developed for military applications, has\nprovided a low-cost observing platform to carry critical and rapid-response\nscientific investigations for over 70 years. Even with the development of\nlaunch vehicles that could put satellites into orbit, high altitude sounding\nrockets have remained relevant. In addition to science observations, sounding\nrockets provide a unique technology test platform and a valuable training\nground for scientists and engineers. Most importantly, sounding rockets remain\nthe only way to explore the tenuous regions of the Earth's atmosphere (the\nupper stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower ionosphere/thermosphere) above\nballoon altitudes ($\\sim$40 km) and below satellite orbits ($\\sim$160 km). They\ncan lift remote sensing telescope payloads with masses up to 400 kg to\naltitudes of 350 km providing observing times of up to 6 minutes above the\nblocking influence of Earth's atmosphere. Though a number of sounding rocket\nresearch programs exist around the world, this article focuses on the NASA\nSounding Rocket Program, and particularly on the astrophysical and solar\nsounding rocket payloads.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate enhanced wavelength conversion in a Q=7500\ndeeply etched AlGaAs-nanowaveguide microresonator via degenerate\ncontinuous-wave four-wave mixing with a pump power of 24 mW. The maximum\nconversion efficiency is -43 dB and accounts for 12 dB enhancement compared to\nthat of a straight nanowaveguide. The experimental results and theoretical\npredictions agree very well and show optimized conversion efficiency of -15 dB.\nThis work represents a step toward realizing a fully integrated optical devices\nfor generating new optical frequencies.\n", "  In this paper, we speculate on a possible application of Liquid Crystal\nElastomers to the field of soft robotics. In particular, we study a concept for\nlimbless locomotion that is amenable to miniaturisation. For this purpose, we\nformulate and solve the evolution equations for a strip of nematic elastomer,\nsubject to directional frictional interactions with a flat solid substrate, and\ncyclically actuated by a spatially uniform, time-periodic stimulus (e.g.,\ntemperature change). The presence of frictional forces that are sensitive to\nthe direction of sliding transforms reciprocal, 'breathing-like' deformations\ninto directed forward motion. We derive formulas quantifying this motion in the\ncase of distributed friction, by solving a differential inclusion for the\ndisplacement field. The simpler case of concentrated frictional interactions at\nthe two ends of the strip is also solved, in order to provide a benchmark to\ncompare the continuously distributed case with a finite-dimensional benchmark.\nWe also provide explicit formulas for the axial force along the crawler body.\n", "  The Derivative Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation is an $L^2$-critical\nnonlinear dispersive equation model for Alfv\\'en waves in space plasmas. Recent\nnumerical studies on an $L^2$-supercritical extension of this equation provide\nevidence of finite time singularities. Near the singular point, the solution is\ndescribed by a universal profile that solves a nonlinear elliptic eigenvalue\nproblem depending only on the strength of the nonlinearity. In the present\nwork, we describe the deformation of the profile and its parameters near\ncriticality, combining asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations.\n", "  Using parallels with the quantum scattering theory, developed for processes\nin nuclear and mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos, we construct a reduced\nGoogle matrix $G_R$ which describes the properties and interactions of a\ncertain subset of selected nodes belonging to a much larger directed network.\nThe matrix $G_R$ takes into account effective interactions between subset nodes\nby all their indirect links via the whole network. We argue that this approach\ngives new possibilities to analyze effective interactions in a group of nodes\nembedded in a large directed networks. Possible efficient numerical methods for\nthe practical computation of $G_R$ are also described.\n", "  The study of polarized branching ratio and different lepton polarization\nasymmeteries in the exclusive rare decays $B\\rightarrow\nK^{\\ast}\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}$ ($\\ell=\\mu , \\tau$) have been made in the standard\nmodel (SM) and in type III of the THDM. It has been found that the effects\narise from the THDM are quite promising in the longitudinal and transverse\npolarized branching ratios $(\\mathcal{B}_{L, T})$. Likewise, in case of $\\mu$'s\nas final state leptons, the polarized branching ratios have an order of\nmagnitude difference from their SM results. Similar trends have also been\nobserved both in the longitudinal and normal lepton polarization asymmetries\n$P_{L, N}$ as well as their average values. We hope that the possible\nsignatures of these observables in $B\\rightarrow K^{\\ast}\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}$\ndecays at different on going and future experiments will serve as a good tool\nin the indirect searches of an extra Higgs boson doublet.\n", "  Frequently observed divergence of numerical solutions to benchmark flows of\nthe UCM viscoelastic fluid is a known and widely discussed issue. Some authors\nconsider such singularities \"invincible\". The article argues this position, to\nwhich end it considers two typical flows with a stagnation point, often a place\nof the flows' singularity: counterflows and a flow spread over a wall. For the\ncounterflows numerical and asymptotic analytical solutions are presented. Both\nkinds of flows turn out regular in the stagnation points, in particular, for\nhigh Weissenberg numbers. A good accordance is demonstrated between the\nanalytical and numerical results.\n", "  We consider the Weyl-Yang gauge theory of gravitation in a\n$(4+3)$-dimensional curved space-time within the scenario of the non-Abelian\nKaluza-Klein theory for the source and torsion-free limits. The explicit forms\nof the field equations containing a new spin current term and the\nenergy-momentum tensors in the usual four dimensions are obtained by the\nwell-known dimensional reduction procedure. In this limit, these field\nequations admit (anti)-dyon and magnetic (anti)-monopole solutions as well as a\nnon-Einsteinian solution in the presence of a generalized Wu-Yang ansatz and\nsome specific scalar potentials when the extra dimensions associated with the\nround and squashed three-sphere $S^{3}$ are, respectively, included. The\n(anti)-dyonic solution has similar properties to those of the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter black holes of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system.\nThe cosmological constant naturally appears in this approach, and that it\nassociates with the constant dilaton field as well as the three-sphere radius.\nIt is demonstrated that the squashing parameter $\\ell$ not only behaves as the\nconstant charge, but also its sign can determine whether the solution is a\ndyon/monopole or an anti-dyon/anti-monopole. It is also shown that whether the\nsource term reduces to Camenzind's current density, and that the existence of\nnon-constant dilaton fields is essential for finding new black hole solutions\nin the Weyl-Yang gauge theory.\n", "  Recent experiments have demonstrated that dynein motor exhibits catch bonding\nbehaviour, in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with\nincreasing force, for a certain range of force. Motivated by these experiments,\nwe propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond\ndeformation (TFBD) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical\napplied load force. We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional\ntransport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within\nthe framework of this model. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic\nchanges in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin\ndriven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict\nthat, under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can\nactually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport\nproperties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of\nthe catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor. This phase plot\nyields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable\nmodifications of motor transport and binding properties. Our work necessitates\na reexamination of existing theories of collective bidirectional transport of\ncellular cargo where the catch bond effect of dynein described in this paper is\nexpected to play a crucial role.\n", "  We use the notion of energy solutions of the stochastic Burgers equation to\ngive a short proof of the Hairer-Quastel universality result for a class of\nstationary weakly asymmetric stochastic PDEs.\n", "  We demonstrate that continuous time quantum walks on several types of\nbranching graphs, including graphs with loops, are identical to quantum walks\non simpler linear chain graphs. We also show graph types for which such\nequivalence does not exist. Several instructive examples are discussed, and a\ngeneral approach to analyze more complex branching graphs is formulated. It is\nfurther illustrated with a return quantum walk solution for a cube graph with\nadjustable complex hopping amplitudes.\n", "  We derive an exact formula of orbital susceptibility expressed in terms of\nBloch wave functions, starting from the exact one-line formula by Fukuyama in\nterms of Green's functions. The obtained formula contains four contributions:\n(1) Landau-Peierls susceptibility, (2) interband contribution, (3) Fermi\nsurface contribution, and (4) contribution from occupied states. Except for the\nLandau-Peierls susceptibility, the other three contributions involve the\ncrystal-momentum derivatives of Bloch wave functions. Physical meaning of each\nterm is clarified. The present formula is simplified compared with those\nobtained previously by Hebborn et al. Based on the formula, it is seen first of\nall that diamagnetism from core electrons and Van Vleck susceptibility are the\nonly contributions in the atomic limit. The band effects are then studied in\nterms of linear combination of atomic orbital treating overlap integrals\nbetween atomic orbitals as a perturbation and the itinerant feature of Bloch\nelectrons in solids are clarified systematically for the first time.\n", "  Quantum mechanics provides a statistical description about nature, and thus\nwould be incomplete if its statistical predictions could not be accounted for\nsome realistic models with hidden variables. There are, however, two powerful\ntheorems against the hidden-variable theories showing that certain quantum\nfeatures cannot be reproduced based on two rationale premises of classicality,\nthe Bell theorem, and noncontextuality, due to Bell, Kochen and Specker (BKS) .\nTests of the Bell inequality and the BKS theorem are both of fundamental\ninterests and of great significance . The Bell theorem has already been\nexperimentally verified extensively on many different systems , while the\nquantum contextuality, which is independent of nonlocality and manifests itself\neven in a single object, is experimentally more demanding. Moreover, the\ncontextuality has been shown to play a critical role to supply the `magic' for\nquantum computation, making more extensive experimental verifications in\npotential systems for quantum computing even more stringent. Here we report an\nexperimental verification of quantum contextuality on an individual atomic\nnuclear spin-1 system in solids under ambient condition. Such a three-level\nsystem is indivisible and thus the compatibility loophole, which exists in the\nexperiments performed on bipartite systems, is closed. Our experimental results\nconfirm that the quantum contextuality cannot be explained by nonlocal\nentanglement, revealing the fundamental quantumness other than\nlocality/nonlocality within the intrinsic spin freedom of a concrete natural\natomic solid-state system at room temperature.\n", "  Analysis of synoptic data from the Vector Stokes Magnetograph (VSM) of the\nSynoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) and the NASA/NSO\nSpectromagnetograph (SPM) at the NSO/Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope facility shows\nthat the reversals of solar polar magnetic fields exhibit elements of a\nstochastic process, which may include the development of specific patterns of\nemerging magnetic flux, and the asymmetry in activity between northern and\nsouthern hemispheres. The presence of such irregularities makes the modeling\nand prediction of polar field reversals extremely hard if possible. In a\nclassical model of solar activity cycle, the unipolar magnetic regions (UMRs)\nof predominantly following polarity fields are transported polewards due to\nmeridional flows and diffusion. The UMRs gradually cancel out the polar\nmagnetic field of the previous cycle, and re-build the polar field of opposite\npolarity setting the stage for the next cycle. We show, however, that this\ndeterministic picture can be easily altered by the developing of a strong\ncenter of activity, or by the emergence of an extremely large active region, or\nby a \"strategically placed\" coronal hole. We demonstrate that the activity\noccurring during the current cycle 24 may be the result of this randomness in\nthe evolution of the solar surface magnetic field.\n", "  The paper presents a program to construct a non-relativistic relational\nBohmian theory, that is, a theory of $N$ moving point-like particles that\ndispenses with space and time as fundamental background structures. The\nrelational program proposed is based on the best-matching framework originally\ndeveloped by Julian Barbour. In particular, the paper focuses on the conceptual\nproblems that arise when trying to implement such a program. It is argued that\npursuing a relational strategy in the Bohmian context leads to a more\nparsimonious ontology than that of standard Bohmian mechanics without betraying\nthe original motivations for adopting a primitive ontology approach to quantum\nphysics. It is also shown how a relational Bohmian approach might clarify the\nissue of the timelessness of the dynamics resulting from the quantization of a\nclassical relational system of particles.\n", "  In a recent letter, Milione et al. reported the Pancharatnam-Berry phase\n(PBP) on a higher-order Poincar\\'e sphere (HOPS) [Phys. Rev. Lett, 108, 190401\n(2012)]. They used two spin-orbit converters (SOCs) to make a trajectory along\nthe HOPS. However, the SOCs actually do not make a path on the HOPS. We briefly\ndiscuss a way of acquiring a PBP made by SOCs.\n", "  The effect of electron doping on the structural, transport, and magnetic\nproperties of Mn (IV) - rich Ca1-xYxMnO3 (x < 0.2) samples have been\ninvestigated using neutron diffraction, neutron depolarization, magnetization\nand resistivity techniques. The temperature dependence of resistivity follows\nthe small polaron model and the activation energy exhibits a minimum for x=0.1\nsample. A phase separated magnetic ground state consisting of ferromagnetic\ndomains (~7microns) embedded in G-type antiferromagnetic matrix is observed in\nthe sample, x = 0.1. The transition to the long range magnetically ordered\nstate in this sample is preceded by a Griffiths phase. On lowering temperature\nbelow 300K a structural transition from orthorhombic structure (Pnma) to a\nmonoclinic structure (P21/m) is observed in the case of x=0.2 sample. The\nferromagnetic behavior in this case is suppressed and the antiferromagnetic\nordering is described by coexisting C-type and G-type magnetic structures\ncorresponding to the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases, respectively.<\n", "  There is no fundamental limit to the precision of a classical measurement.\nThe position of a meter's needle can be determined with an arbitrarily small\nuncertainty. In the quantum realm, however, fundamental quantum fluctuations\ndue to the Heisenberg principle limit the measurement precision. The simplest\nmeasurement procedures, involving semi-classical states of the meter, lead to a\nfluctuation-limited imprecision at the standard quantum limit. By engineering\nthe quantum state of the meter system, the measurement imprecision can be\nreduced down to the fundamental Heisenberg Limit (HL). Quantum-enabled\nmetrology techniques are thus in high demand and the focus of an intense\nactivity. We report here a quantum-enabled measurement of an electric field\nbased on this approach. We cast Rydberg atoms in Schr\\\"odinger cat states,\nsuperpositions of atomic levels with radically different polarizabilites. We\nuse a quantum interference process to perform a measurement close to the HL,\nreaching a single-shot sensitivity of 1.2 mV/cm for a 100 ns interaction time,\ncorresponding to 30 $\\mu$V/cm/Hz^(1/2) at our 3 kHz repetition rate. This\nhighly sensitive, non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement\nextends the realm of electrometric techniques and could have important\npractical applications. Detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices\nat a ~100 $\\mu$m distance, with a MegaHertz bandwith is within reach.\n", "  In this paper a method is introduced, to visualize bifurcated stent grafts in\nCT-Data. The aim is to improve therapy planning for minimal invasive treatment\nof abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Due to precise measurement of the\nabdominal aortic aneurysm and exact simulation of the bifurcated stent graft,\nphysicians are supported in choosing a suitable stent prior to an intervention.\nThe presented method can be used to measure the dimensions of the abdominal\naortic aneurysm as well as simulate a bifurcated stent graft. Both of these\nprocedures are based on a preceding segmentation and skeletonization of the\naortic, right and left iliac. Using these centerlines (aortic, right and left\niliac) a bifurcated initial stent is constructed. Through the implementation of\nan ACM method the initial stent is fit iteratively to the vessel walls - due to\nthe influence of external forces (distance- as well as balloonforce). Following\nthe fitting process, the crucial values for choosing a bifurcated stent graft\nare measured, e.g. aortic diameter, right and left common iliac diameter,\nminimum diameter of distal neck. The selected stent is then simulated to the\nCT-Data - starting with the initial stent. It hereby becomes apparent if the\ndimensions of the bifurcated stent graft are exact, i.e. the fitting to the\narteries was done properly and no ostium was covered.\n", "  Cloud-to-ground lightning is the most common among atmospheric discharges.\nSince electric fields in the vicinity of a thunder-cloud do not exceed 250 kV/m\nthe physical process that triggers the lightning remains unexplained. [1, 2, 3]\nRecent measurements established a weak correlation between solar wind and\nincidence of lightning. [4] Here we show, that if an ionized path created by\ncosmic rays provides a trigger, the distribution of lengths between two\nsuccessive forking points in a lightning channel (internodes) closely resembles\nthe exponential distribution with average length between 415 m and 510 m. The\nresults, if confirmed, imply that a thunder-cell may be an additional source of\nfast elementary particles that initiate lightning process.\n", "  We show that deliberately engineered spatially dispersive metamaterial slab\ncan enable co-existence and phase matching of contra-propagating ordinary\nfundamental and backward second harmonic electromagnetic modes. Energy flux and\nphase velocity are contra-directed in backward waves which determines\nextraordinary nonlinear-optical propagation processes. Frequencies, phase and\ngroup velocities, as well as nanowavequide losses inherent to the\nelectromagnetic modes supported by the metamaterial can be tailored to optimize\nnonlinear-optical conversion of frequencies and propagation directions of the\ncoupled waves. Such a possibility, which is of paramount importance for\nnonlinear photonics, is proved with numerical model of the hyperbolic\nmetamaterial made of carbon nanotubes standing on metal surface. Extraordinary\nproperties of backward-wave second harmonic in the THz and IR propagating in\nthe reflection direction are investigated with focus on pulsed regime.\n", "  This letter presents the development of ultrasonic coda wave interferometry\nto locate and image microcracks created within consolidated granular media,\npolymer concrete. Results show that microcracks can be detected through coda\nwaves when the polymer concrete is submitted to a linear resonance. In\naddition, the multiple scattering revealed to be dependent on the plane in\nwhich the resonance is excited. In that sense, Acoustic emission measurements\nwere performed under flexural resonances generated in (XY) and (XZ) planes to\nverify the existence of a possible structural anisotropy related to\nmicrocracks. Recorded acoustic signatures revealed important differences in the\nfrequency contents, depending on the considered plane, with a consequent wealth\non the involved mechanisms during the microcracks vibrations.\n", "  We use six years (2003 to 2008) of Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment\nIII microlensing observations to derive the survey detection efficiency for a\nrange of planetary masses and projected distances from the host star. We\nperform an independent analysis of the microlensing light curves to extract the\nevent parameters and compute the planet detection probability given the data.\n2433 light curves satisfy our quality selection criteria and are retained for\nfurther processing. The aggregate of the detection probabilities over the range\nexplored yields the expected number of microlensing planet detections. We\nemploy a Galactic model to convert this distribution from dimensionless to\nphysical units, \\alpha/au and M_E. The survey sensitivity to small planets is\nhighest in the range 1 to 4 au, shifting to slightly larger separations for\nmore massive ones.\n", "  A three dimensional molecular dynamic code is used to study the generation of\nfusion neutrons from Coulomb explosion of Deuterium clusters driven by intense\nnear infra-red (NIR) laser ($\\lambda=800nm$) of femtosecond pulse duration\n($\\tau=50 fs$) under beam-target interaction scheme. We have considered various\nclusters of average sizes ($\\langle R_0\\rangle$=80,140,200\\AA) which are\nirradiated by a laser of peak spatial-temporal intensity of 1$\\times10^{18}\nW/cm^{2}$. The effects of cluster size and spatial laser intensity distribution\non ion energies due to the Coulomb explosion of the cluster are included by\nconvolution of single cluster single intensity ion energy distribution function\n(IEDF) over a range of cluster sizes and laser intensities. The final\nconvoluted IEDF gets broadened on both lower and higher energy sides due to\nthis procedure. Furthermore, the neutron yield which takes into account the\nconvoluted IEDF, also gets modified by a factor of $\\sim$2 compared to the case\nwhen convolution effects are ignored.\n", "  First-principles calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) with\nGGA-PBE exchange-correlation scheme have been employed to predict the\nstructural, the elastic and the electronic properties of newly discovered\nlithium silicide superconductor, Li2PtSi3, for the first time. All the\ntheoretical results are compared with those calculated recently for\nisostructural Li2IrSi3. The present study sheds light on the effect of\nreplacement of transition metal element Ir with Pt on different mechanical,\nelectronic, and superconducting properties. The effect of spin-orbit coupling\non electronic band structure was found to be insignificant for Li2PtSi3. The\ndifference in superconducting transition temperatures of Li2PtSi3 and Li2IrSi3\narises primarily due to the difference in electronic energy density of states\nat the Fermi level. Somewhat reduced Debye temperature in Li2PtSi3 plays a\nminor role. We have discussed the implications of the theoretical results in\ndetails in this study.\n", "  The tremendous popular success of Chaos Theory shares some common points with\nthe not less fortunate Relativity: they both rely on a misunderstanding.\nIndeed, ironically , the scientific meaning of these terms for mathematicians\nand physicists is quite opposite to the one most people have in mind and are\nattracted by. One may suspect that part of the psychological roots of this\nseductive appeal relies in the fact that with these ambiguous names, together\nwith some superficial clich{\\'e}s or slogans immediately related to them (\"the\nbutterfly effect\" or \"everything is relative\"), some have the more or less\nsecret hope to find matter that would undermine two pillars of science, namely\nits ability to predict and to bring out a universal objectivity. Here I propose\nto focus on Chaos Theory and illustrate on several examples how, very much like\nRelativity, it strengthens the position it seems to contend with at first\nsight: the failure of predictability can be overcome and leads to precise,\nstable and even more universal predictions.\n", "  Given a probability density $P({\\bf x}|{\\boldsymbol \\lambda})$, where $\\bf x$\nrepresents continuous degrees of freedom and $\\lambda$ a set of parameters, it\nis possible to construct a general identity relating expectations of observable\nquantities, which is a generalization of the equipartition theorem in\nThermodynamics.\n  In this work we explore some of the consequences of this relation, both in\nthe context of sampling distributions and Bayesian posteriors, and how it can\nbe used to extract some information without the need for explicit calculation\nof the partition function (or the Bayesian evidence, in the case of posterior\nexpectations). Together with the general family of fluctuation theorems it\nconstitutes a powerful tool for Bayesian/MaxEnt problems.\n", "  The behaviour of the 2D model system - the Ikeda map - is investigated in the\nweakly dissipative regime under external forcing on the incommensurate\nfrequency. Coexistence of a large number of stable invariant curves is shown.\nDependence of the number of coexisting attractors on the external forcing\namplitude and nonlinearity parameter is investigated.\n", "  Activation cross-sections data of longer-lived products of proton induced\nnuclear reactions on dysprosium were extended up to 65 MeV by using stacked\nfoil irradiation and gamma spectrometry experimental methods. Experimental\ncross-sections data for the formation of the radionuclides $^{159}$Dy,\n$^{157}$Dy, $^{155}$Dy, $^{161}$Tb, $^{160}$Tb, $^{156}$Tb, $^{155}$Tb,\n$^{154m2}$Tb, $^{154m1}$Tb, $^{154g}$Tb, $^{153}$Tb, $^{152}$Tb and $^{151}$Tb\nare reported in the 36-65 MeV energy range, and compared with an old dataset\nfrom 1964. The experimental data were also compared with the results of cross\nsection calculations of the ALICE and EMPIRE nuclear model codes and of the\nTALYS nuclear reaction model code as listed in the latest on-line libraries\nTENDL 2013.\n", "  Series solutions for a large family of single equation Dyson-Schwinger\nequations are given as expansions over decorated rooted connected chord\ndiagrams. The analytic input to the new expansions are the expansions of the\nregularized integrals for the primitive graphs building the Dyson-Schwinger\nequation. Each decorated chord diagram contributes a weighted monomial in the\ncoefficients of the expansions of the primitives and so indexes the analytic\nsolution in a tightly controlled way.\n", "  In this paper, we apply three diagnostics including $Om$, Statefinder\nhierarchy and the growth rate of perturbations into discriminating the two\nparametric models for the effective pressure with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. By\nusing the $Om$ diagnostic, we find that both the model 1 and the model 2 can be\nhardly distinguished from each other as well as the $\\Lambda$CDM model in terms\nof 68\\% confidence level. As a supplement, by using the Statefinder hierarchy\ndiagnostics and the growth rate of perturbations, we discover that not only can\nour two parametric models be well distinguished from $\\Lambda$CDM model, but\nalso, by comparing with $Om$ diagnostic, the model 1 and the model 2 can be\ndistinguished better from each other. In addition, we also explore the fate of\nuniverse evolution of our two models by means of the rip analysis.\n", "  Pastewka & Robbins (PNAS, 111(9), 3298-3303, 2014) recently have proposed a\ncriterion to distinguish when two surfaces will stick together or not, and\nsuggested it shows a large conflict with asperity theories. It is found that\ntheir criterion corresponds very closely to the Fuller and Tabor asperity model\none when bandwidth {\\alpha} is small, but otherwise involves a rms ampliture of\nroughness reduced by a factor Sqrt({\\alpha}). Therefore, it implies the\nstickiness of any rough surface is the same as that of the surface where\npractically all wavelength components of roughness are removed except the very\nfine ones, which is perhaps counterintuitive. The results are therefore very\ninteresting, if confirmed. Possible sources of approximations are indicated,\nand a significant error is found in plotting the pull-off data which may\nimprove the fit with Fuller and Tabor. However, still they show finite pull-off\nvalues in cases where both their own criterion and an asperity based one seem\nto suggest non stickiness, and the results are in these respects inconclusive.\n", "  This work investigates in which form quantities with Planck dimensions occur\nalready in the common quantum theory with local Lorentz symmetry. Since such\nPlanck quantities as Planck length or Planck mass involve the Planck constant\nh, the velocity of light c and the Newton gravitational constant G, the\nrelativistic Dirac equation (h, c) in the Newtonian gravitational potential (G)\ncan be considered as a test theory. The evaluation of the break-off condition\nof the power series of the radial energy eigenfunctions of a purely\ngravitational atom leads to exact terms for the energy eigenvalues E for\nvarious special cases of the quantum numbers N, k and n = N + |k|. It turns out\nthat a meaningful atom model, based solely on Newtonian gravitational forces,\ncan result if, inter alia, the test mass m in the gravitational field of the\nmass M is selected to be smaller than the Planck mass.\n", "  We propose a model to create synthetic networks that may also serve as a\nnarrative of a certain kind of infrastructure network evolution. It consists of\nan initialization phase with the network extending tree-like for minimum cost\nand a growth phase with an attachment rule giving a trade-off between\ncost-optimization and redundancy. Furthermore, we implement the feature of some\nlines being split during the grid's evolution. We show that the resulting\ndegree distribution has an exponential tail and may show a maximum at degree\ntwo, suitable to observations of real-world power grid networks. In particular,\nthe mean degree and the slope of the exponential decay can be controlled in\npartial independence. To verify to which extent the degree distribution is\ndescribed by our analytic form, we conduct statistical tests, showing that the\nhypothesis of an exponential tail is well-accepted for our model data.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of localization, interactions and (pseudo)spin\ndegrees of freedom on quantum states of particles on the lattice. Our results\nshow that breaking the paradigm density-density interaction $U_0\\gg$\n(pseudo)spin-(pseudo)spin interaction $U_s$ will drive the sequence of quantum\nphase transitions (QPT), where (pseudo)spin state and particle ordering, in\ncase of several particle species, on the lattice are strongly changed. QPT\ndriven by competing interactions, $|U_s|\\sim U_0$, manifest itself in\nsingularities of effective exchange integrals. $|U_s|\\sim U_0$ implies a\nfrustration when the interactions standing alone drive the system to different\nphases. Even at $U_s=0$, there is typically a QPT induced by $U_s$ sign change.\nVector cold atoms, Fermions or Bosons, on optical lattices are the\nstate-of-the-art realization of our system where $U_s$ is tunable \\textit{in\nsitu}.\n", "  We discuss a curious observation: at energies from the ISR and up to the LHC,\ninclusively, the differential cross-section of elastic proton-proton scattering\nremains almost energy-independent at the transferred momentum t =-0.21 GeV^2 at\nthe level of 7,5 mb/GeV^2.The latter value can be considered as a prediction\nfor dsigma/dt at 13 TeV. We also obtain a lower bound for the forward pp slope\nat 13 GeV.\n", "  We investigate numerically the critical behaviour which occurs in the\ncollapse of both spherically symmetric and asymmetric scalar field bubbles with\nfull general relativity. We use a minimally coupled scalar field subject to a\n\"double well\" interaction potential, with the bubble wall spanning the barrier\nbetween two degenerate minima. We find that the spherically symmetric case\nexhibits Type 2 critical behaviour with the critical index consistent with a\nvalue of gamma = 0.37 as expected. In the asymmetric case, we find that again\nour results are consistent with a value of gamma = 0.37 for the dominant\nunstable mode. We do not see strong evidence of echoing in the solutions, which\ncould be due to the fact that the coordinates are not well adapted to the\nechoing behaviour, or due to being still too far from the critical point to\nproperly observe the critical solution.\n", "  Very recently there was a report of the discovery using piezoelectric force\nmicroscopy (PFM) of a switchable ferroelectric polarization in 1.6 % tensile\nstrained TiO2 thin film with anatase crystal structure (see N. Deepak et al.\nAdv. Funct. Mater. 2014, 24, 2844). The polarization disappeared only above 450\nK, which was assigned as a Curie temperature, Tc. Here we have performed X-ray\ndiffraction, second-harmonic generation (SHG) and infrared investigations of\nthe same films. Phonon frequencies exhibit less than a 10 % shift down with the\ntensile strain and no anomaly near expected TC. SHG experiment did not reveal\nany signal characteristic for inversion symmetry breaking, as expected in\nferroelectric phase, and the c-lattice parameter exhibits no anomaly on heating\nnear expected TC. Based on these results, we can summarize that we were not\nable to confirm the previously discovered ferroelectricity in tensile-strained\nanatase-TiO2 thin films.\n", "  Tulczyjew triple for physical systems with configuration manifold equipped\nwith Lie group structure is constructed and discussed. The case of systems\ninvariant with respect to group acton is considered together with appropriate\nreduction of the Tulczyjew triple. The theory is applied to free rigid-body\ndynamics.\n", "  Minkowski space is shown to be globally stable as a solution to the\nEinstein--Vlasov system in the case when all particles have zero mass. The\nproof proceeds by showing that the matter must be supported in the \"wave zone\",\nand then proving a small data semi-global existence result for the\ncharacteristic initial value problem for the massless Einstein--Vlasov system\nin this region. This relies on weighted estimates for the solution which, for\nthe Vlasov part, are obtained by introducing the Sasaki metric on the mass\nshell and estimating Jacobi fields with respect to this metric by geometric\nquantities on the spacetime. The stability of Minkowski space result for the\nvacuum Einstein equations is then appealed to for the remaining regions.\n", "  In paper [1] unpredictable points were introduced based on Poisson stability,\nand this gives rise to the existence of chaos in the quasi-minimal set. This\ntime, an unpredictable function is determined as an unpredictable point in the\nBebutov dynamical system. The existence of an unpredictable solution and\nconsequently chaos of a quasi-linear system of ordinary differential equations\nare verified. This is the first time that the description of chaos is initiated\nfrom a single function, but not on a collection of them. The results can be\neasily extended to different types of differential equations. An application of\nthe main theorem for Duffing equations is provided.\n", "  Mermin's inequality is the generalization of the Bell-CHSH inequality for\nthree qubit states. The violation of the Mermin inequality guarantees the fact\nthat there exists quantum non-locality either between two or three qubits in a\nthree qubit system. In the absence of an analytical result to this effect, in\norder to check for the violation of Mermin's inequality one has to perform a\nnumerical optimization procedure for even three qubit pure states. Here we\nderive an analytical formula for the maximum value of the expectation of the\nMermin operator in terms of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, that gives the\nmaximal violation of the Mermin inequality for all three qubit pure and mixed\nstates.\n", "  We propose a method to generate a single peak at a distinct energy in the ion\nflux-energy distribution function (IDF) at the electrode surfaces in\ncapacitively coupled plasmas. The technique is based on the tailoring of the\ndriving voltage waveform, i.e. adjusting the phases and amplitudes of the\napplied harmonics, to optimize the accumulation of ions created by charge\nexchange collisions and their subsequent acceleration by the sheath electric\nfield. The position of the peak (i.e. the ion energy) and the flux of the ions\nwithin the peak of the IDF can be controlled in a wide domain by tuning the\nparameters of the applied RF voltage waveform, allowing optimization of various\napplications where surface reactions are induced at particular ion energies.\n", "  The present paper corresponds to the third work of the author related to the\nmagnetotransport properties concerning on the graphene systems. In the first\none the integer quantum Hall effect in the monolayer graphene, (MG), MGIQHE,\nwas analysed, (Hidalgo, 2014). The subject of the second one was the\nunderstanding of the fractional quantum Hall also in the MG, (MGFQHE),\n(Hidalgo, 2015), basing us in our model on the fractional quantum Hall effect\nin semiconductor quantum systems, Hidalgo (2013). The aim of the present work\nis the analysis of the integer quantum Hall effect observed in bilayer\ngraphene, (BG), BGIQHE, as a function of both, the gate voltage and the\nmagnetic field. Our approach is a single electron approach, firstly developed\nfor the study of the integer quantum Hall (IQHE) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\neffects of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in any semiconductor quantum\nwell (QW), (Hidalgo, 1995, 1998, 2007). The extension of this model for the BG\nreproduces its main observed features for the IQHE and the SdH, and as a\nfunction of both, the gate voltage and the magnetic field, in particular the\nplateaux at the values , with n=0,1,2... Therefore, the approach integrates the\nquantum Hall effects (integer and fractional) observed in both, QW and\ngraphene, in the same physical frame.\n", "  Due in part to the increased pace of cultural and environmental change, as\nwell as increased competition due to globalization, innovation is become one of\nthe primary concerns of the 21st century. We present an academic course\ndesigned to develop cognitive abilities related to creativity within an\nengineering education context, based on a conceptual framework rooted in\ncognitive sciences. The course was held at \\'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\\'eal\n(\\'EPM), a world renowned engineering school and a pillar in Canada's\nengineering community. The course was offered twice in the 2014-2015 academic\nyear and more than 30 students from the graduate and undergraduate programs\nparticipated. The course incorporated ten pedagogical strategies, including\nserious games, an observation book, individual and group projects, etc., that\nwere expected to facilitate the development of cognitive abilities related to\ncreativity such as encoding, and associative analytical thinking. The CEDA\n(Creative Engineering Design Assessment) test was used to measure the students'\ncreativity at the beginning and at the end of the course. Field notes were\ntaken after each of the 15 three-hour sessions to qualitatively document the\neducative intervention along the semester and students gave anonymous written\nfeedback after completing the last session. Quantitative and qualitative\nresults suggest that an increase in creativity is possible to obtain with a\ncourse designed to development cognitive abilities related to creativity. Also,\nstudents appreciated the course, found it relevant, and made important,\nmeaningful learnings regarding the creative process, its cognitive mechanism\nand the approaches available to increase it.\n", "  Most individuals in social networks experience a so-called Friendship\nParadox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This effect may\nexplain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to\nreduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is\npoorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness\nparadox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we\nreport the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a\nlarge-scale online social network of $39,110$ Twitter users. Our results reveal\nthat popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals\nexperience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect\nis shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and\nthe fact that users cluster assortatively by level of happiness. Our results\nindicate that the topology of online social networks and the distribution of\nhappiness in some populations can cause widespread psycho-social effects that\naffect the well-being of billions of individuals.\n", "  Model-theoretic aspects of exotic smoothness were studied long ago uncovering\nunexpected relations to noncommutative spaces and quantum theory. Some of these\nrelations were worked out in detail in later work. An important point in the\nargumentation was the forcing construction of Cohen but without a direct\napplication to exotic smoothness. In this article we assign the set-theoretic\nforcing on trees to Casson handles and characterize small exotic smooth $R^4$\nfrom this point of view. Moreover, we show how models in some Grothendieck\ntoposes can help describing such differential structures in dimension 4. These\nresults can be used to obtain the deformation of the algebra of usual complex\nfunctions to the noncommutative algebra of operators on a Hilbert space. We\nalso discuss the results in the context of the Epstein-Glaser renormalization\nin QFT.\n", "  In an attempt to model the observed enhancement of adhesion in some classical\nexperiments in the 1970-1980's, Persson introduced in his theory of adhesion\nbetween rough solids a term which corresponds to an area increase due to\nroughness. In the old experiments, the adhesion enhancement was shown to be up\nto one order of magnitude, whereas the area increase could not be defined\nquantitatively because of possibly multiscale roughness. However, in more\nrecent studies by Guduru and collaborators, this enhancement has been further\nexplained with classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics theory, the area\nenhancement has been shown to be negligible, and therefore the problem of\nadhesion of rough surfaces remains qualitatively and quantitatively unsolved by\nPersson's theory.\n", "  The relativistic acceleration of an electron in a uniform gravitational field\nis calculated numerically using the generalization of the Dirac equation to\ncurved spacetime. Equivalent results are also obtained analytically using an\niterative approach that is not based on the WKB approximation, which has been\nused extensively in the past. The acceleration is found to be proportional to a\nfactor of $(1-3v^2/c^2)$ using Schwarzschild coordinates, which is consistent\nwith the classical geodesic of a particle. These techniques may be useful in\nresolving the differences between commonly-used approximations.\n", "  We present measurements of the growth of long columnar ice crystals from\nwater vapor over a broad range of temperatures and supersaturation levels in\nair. Starting with thin, c-axis ice needle crystals, we observed their\nsubsequent growth behavior in a vapor diffusion chamber, extracting the initial\nradial growth velocities of the needles under controlled conditions.\nApproximating the hexagonal needle crystals as infinitely long cylinders, we\ncreated an analytical growth model that includes effects from particle\ndiffusion of water molecules through the surrounding air along with the\ndiffusion of heat generated by solidification. With only minimal adjustment of\nmodel parameters, we obtained excellent agreement with our experimental data.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects from\nparticle and heat diffusion have been measured in ice growth from water vapor.\nThis analysis further provides an accurate method for calibration of the\nwater-vapor supersaturation levels in experimental growth chambers.\n", "  We review recent work on active colloids or swimmers, such as self-propelled\nmicroorganisms, phoretic colloidal particles, and artificial micro-robotic\nsystems, moving in fluid-like environments. These environments can be\nwater-like and Newtonian but can frequently contain macromolecules, flexible\npolymers, soft cells, or hard particles, which impart complex, nonlinear\nrheological features to the fluid. While significant progress has been made on\nunderstanding how active colloids move and interact in Newtonian fluids, little\nis known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-Newtonian fluids. An\nemerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically\nchange the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. Simultaneously, a moving\nswimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows, that can modify\nthe medium (fluid) rheological properties. This two-way, non-linear coupling at\nmicroscopic scales has profound implications at meso- and macro-scales: steady\nstate suspension properties, emergent collective behavior, and transport of\npassive tracer particles. Recent exciting theoretical results and current\ndebate on quantifying these complex active fluids highlight the need for\nconceptually simple experiments to guide our understanding.\n", "  We present a comprehensive formalism for the simulation and optimisation of\nCRLs in both condensing and full-field imaging configurations. The approach\nextends ray transfer matrix analysis to account for x-ray attenuation by the\nlens material. Closed analytical expressions for critical imaging parameters\nsuch as numerical aperture, vignetting, chromatic aberration and focal length\nare provided for both thin- and thick-lens imaging geometries.\n", "  If spin liquids have been famously defined by what they are not, i.e.\nordered, the past years have seen the frontier between order and spin liquid\nstarting to fade, with a growing number of materials whose low-temperature\nphysics cannot be explained without co-existence of (partial) magnetic order\nand spin fluctuations. Here we study an example of such co-existence in the\npresence of magnetic dipolar interactions, related to spin ice, where the order\nis long range and the fluctuations support a Coulomb gauge field. Topological\ndefects are effectively coupled via energetic and entropic Coulomb\ninteractions, the latter one being stronger than for the spin-ice ground state.\nDepending on whether these defects break the divergence-free condition of the\nCoulomb gauge field or the long-range order, they are respectively categorized\nas monopoles - as in spin ice - or monopole holes, in analogy with electron\nholes in semiconductors. The long-range order plays the role of a\nfully-occupied valence band, while the Coulomb spin liquid can be seen as an\nempty conducting band. These results are discussed in the context of other\nlattices and models which support a similar co-existence of Coulomb gauge field\nand long-range order. We conclude this work by explaining how dipolar\ninteractions lift the spin liquid degeneracy at very low energy scale by\nmaximizing the number of flippable plaquettes, in light of the equivalent\nquantum dimer model.\n", "  This paper proposes an approach for comparing interlocked board networks over\ntime to test for statistically significant change. In addition to contributing\nto the conversation about whether the Mizruchi hypothesis (that a\ndisintegration of power is occurring within the corporate elite) holds or not,\nwe propose novel methods to handle a longitudinal investigation of a series of\nsocial networks where the nodes undergo a few modifications at each time point.\nMethodologically, our contribution is twofold: we extend a Bayesian model\nhereto applied to compare two time periods to a longer time period, and we\ndefine and employ the concept of a hull of a sequence of social networks, which\nmakes it possible to circumvent the problem of changing nodes over time.\n", "  Monitoring of the Sun and its activity is a task of growing importance in the\nframe of space weather research and awareness. Major space weather disturbances\nat Earth have their origin in energetic outbursts from the Sun: solar flares,\ncoronal mass ejections and associated solar energetic particles. In this review\nwe discuss the importance and complementarity of ground-based and space-based\nobservations for space weather studies. The main focus is drawn on ground-based\nobservations in the visible range of the spectrum, in particular in the\ndiagnostically manifold H$\\alpha$ spectral line, which enables us to detect and\nstudy solar flares, filaments, filament eruptions, and Moreton waves. Existing\nH$\\alpha$ networks such as the GONG and the Global High-Resolution H$\\alpha$\nNetwork are discussed. As an example of solar observations from space weather\nresearch to operations, we present the system of real-time detection of\nH$\\alpha$ flares and filaments established at Kanzelh\\\"ohe Observatory (KSO;\nAustria) in the frame of the ESA Space Situational Awareness programme. During\nthe evaluation period 7/2013 - 11/2015, KSO provided 3020 hours of real-time\nH$\\alpha$ observations at the SWE portal. In total, 824 H$\\alpha$ flares were\ndetected and classified by the real-time detection system, including 174 events\nof H$\\alpha$ importance class 1 and larger. For the total sample of events,\n95\\% of the automatically determined flare peak times lie within $\\pm$5 min of\nthe values given in the official optical flares reports (by NOAA and KSO), and\n76\\% of the start times. The heliographic positions determined are better than\n$\\pm$5$^\\circ$. The probability of detection of flares of importance 1 or\nlarger is 95\\%, with a false alarm rate of 16\\%. These numbers confirm the high\npotential of automatic flare detection and alerting from ground-based\nobservatories.\n", "  A cosmological magnetic field affects the time evolution of the cosmic matter\ndensity field. The squared Alfven velocity of the cosmic fluid is proportional\nto an ensemble average energy density of a primordial magnetic field (PMF), and\nit prevents the matter density field from collapsing in the horizon scale. The\nmatter-radiation equality time also is delayed by the presence of an ensemble\naverage energy density of a PMF. The ensemble average energy density of the PMF\nalso affects the matter power spectrum (MPS) through the Meszaros effect and\nthe potential decay. Since the ensemble average energy density of the PMF is\nnot a first order perturbation but a zero order source in the linear\nperturbation equations for the cosmology, to correctly understand the overall\neffects of the PMF on the MPS, we should significantly revise previous\napproaches to research for the MPS with the PMF by considering both the effects\nof the zero and first order sources from the PMF in the linear perturbation\ntheory. We apply the effects of the zero order sources from the PMF to\ntheoretical computations of the MPS for the first time. We also analyze the\noverall PMF effects on the MPS. The CMB polarizations are affected the weak\nlensing. The weak lensing is determined by the MPS. Therefore, we have to\nconsider the zero order sources of the PMF to gain a correct understanding not\nonly of the MPS but also the CMB polarization.\n", "  We refine our previous proposal for systematically classifying 4d rank-1\n$\\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs by constructing their possible Coulomb branch geometries.\nFour new recently discussed rank-1 theories, including novel $\\mathcal{N}=3$\nSCFTs, sit beautifully in our refined classification framework. By arguing for\nthe consistency of their RG flows we can make a strong case for the existence\nof at least four additional rank-1 SCFTs, nearly doubling the number of known\nrank-1 SCFTs.\n  The refinement consists of relaxing the assumption that the flavor symmetries\nof the SCFTs have no discrete factors. This results in an enlarged (but finite)\nset of possible rank-1 SCFTs. Their existence can be further constrained using\nconsistency of their central charges and RG flows.\n", "  We show that the dynamical freezing of vortex structures nucleated at diluted\ndensities in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ samples with a dense\ndistribution of columnar defects, $B \\sim 10^{-2} B_{\\Phi}$ with\n$B_{\\Phi}=5$\\,kG, results in configurations with liquid-like correlations. We\npropose a freezing model considering a relaxation dynamics dominated by\ndouble-kink excitations driven by the local stresses obtained directly from\nexperimental images. With this model we estimate the relaxation barrier and the\nfreezing temperature. We argue that the low-field frozen vortex structures\nnucleated in a dense distribution of columnar defects thus correspond to an\nout-of-equilibrium non-entangled liquid with strongly reduced mobility rather\nthan to a snapshot of a metastable state with divergent activation barriers as\nfor instance expected for the Bose-glass phase at equilibrium.\n", "  We present a theoretical and experimental analysis of nonlinear thermo-optic\neffects in suspended chalcogenide glass nanobeam cavities. We measure the power\ndependent resonance peaks and characterise the dynamic nonlinear thermo-optic\nresponse of the cavity under modulated light input. Several distinct nonlinear\ncharacteristics are identified, including a modified spectral response\ncontaining periodic fringes, a critical wavelength jump and saturated time\ndelay for modulation frequency faster than the thermal characteristic time. We\nreveal that the coupling to a parasitic Fabry-Perot cavity enables isolated\nthermal equilibrium states resulting in the discontinuous thermo-optic critical\npoint.\n", "  The first generation of quantum computers are on the horizon, fabricated from\nquantum hardware platforms that may soon be able to tackle certain tasks that\ncannot be performed or modelled with conventional computers. These quantum\ndevices will not likely be universal or fully programmable, but special-purpose\nprocessors whose hardware will be tightly co-designed with particular target\napplications. Trapped atomic ions are a leading platform for first generation\nquantum computers, but are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general\npurpose devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are\natomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 10^15, and their\nquantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use of external\nfields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of the qubits\nthemselves. In this article we show how a modular quantum computer of any size\ncan be engineered from ion crystals, and how the wiring between ion trap qubits\ncan be tailored to a variety of applications and quantum computing protocols.\n", "  Defects in semiconductors can exhibit multiple charge states, which can be\nused for charge storage applications. Here we consider such charge storage in a\nseries of oxygen deficient phases of TiO$_2$, known as Magn\\'eli phases. These\nTi$_n$O$_{2n-1}$ Magn\\'eli phases present well-defined crystalline structures,\ni. e., their deviation from stoichiometry is accommodated by changes in space\ngroup as opposed to point defects. We show that these phases exhibit\nintermediate bands with the same electronic quadruple donor transitions akin to\ninterstitial Ti defect levels in TiO$_2$-rutile. Thus, the Magn\\'eli phases\nbehave as if they contained a very large pseudo-defect density: $\\frac{1}{2}$\nper formula unit Ti$_n$O$_{2n-1}$. Depending on the Fermi Energy the whole\nmaterial will become charged. These crystals are natural charge storage\nmaterials with a storage capacity that rivals the best known supercapacitors.\n", "  Starting off with two distinct initially static stellar cores (i) Florides\ninterior (constant density, vanishing radial pressure) and (ii) Wyman interior\n(constant density, nonvanishing radial pressure), we explore the dynamics of\nthese two models once hydrostatic equilibrium is lost. We show that although\nthe time of formation of horizon, evolution of the mass and proper radius are\nindependent of the chosen initially static configurations, there is a\nsignificant difference in the temperature profiles of the radiating bodies as\nthe collapse proceeds.\n", "  We report the application of Titius-Bode's law on 43 exoplanetary systems\ncontaining four or more planets. Due to the fact that most of these systems\nhave their planets located within compact regions extending for less than the\nsemi-major axis of Mercury we found the necessity to scale down the Titius-Bode\nlaw in each case. In this short article we present sample calculations for\nthree systems out of the whole set. Results show that all systems studied are\nverifying the applicability of the law with high accuracy. Consequently our\ninvestigation verifies practically the scale invariance of Titius-Bode law. The\nresults of this study buildup the confidence in predicting positions of the\nexoplanets according to Titius-Bode's law besides enabling diagnosing possible\nreasons of deviations.\n", "  Superantiwettability, including superhydrophobicity, is an enhanced effect of\nsurface ruggedness via the Cassie-Baxter wetting state, and has many\napplications such as antifouling, drop manipulation, and self-cleaning.\nHowever, superantiwettability is easily broken due to Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel\nwetting state transition caused by various environmental disturbances. Since\nall observed reverse transitions required energy inputs, it was believed that\nthe Cassie-Baxter state couldn't be monostable. Here we show that there is a\nregime in the phase space of the receding contact angle and ruggedness\nparameters in which a Wenzel state can automatically transit into the\nCassie-Baxter one without an external energy input, namely the Cassie-Baxter\nstate in this regime is monostable. We further find a simple criterion that\npredicts very well experimentally observed Wenzel to Cassie-Baxter transitions\nfor different liquids placed on various pillar-structured substrates. These\nresults can be used as a guide for designing and engineering durable\nsuperantiwetting surfaces.\n", "  Thermonuclear fusion reactivity is a pivotal quantity in the studies\npertaining to fusion energy production, fusion ignition and energy break-even\nanalysis in both inertially and magnetically confined systems. Although nuclear\nfusion reactivity and thereafter the power density of a magnetic confinement\nfusion reactor and the fulfillment of the ignition criterion are quantitatively\ndetermined by assuming the ion speed distribution to be Maxwellian, a\nsignificant population of suprathermal ions,with energy greater than the\nquasi-Maxwellian background plasma temperature, is generated by the fusion\nreactions and auxiliary heating in the fusion devices. In the current work\n3-parameter Dagum speed distribution has been introduced to include the effect\nof suprathermal ion population in the calculation of total fusion reactivity.\nThe extent of enhancement in the fusion reactivity, at different back-ground\ntemperatures of the fusion fuel plasma, due to the suprathermal ion population\nhas also been discussed.\n", "  Gyrokinetic modeling is appropriate for describing Tokamak plasma turbulence,\nand the gyroaverage operator is a cornerstone of this approach. In a\ngyrokinetic code, the gyroaveraging scheme needs to be accurate enough to avoid\nspoiling the data but also requires a low computation cost because it is\napplied often on the main unknown, the 5D guiding-center distribution function,\nand on the 3D electric potentials. In the present paper, we improve a\ngyroaverage scheme based on Hermite interpolation used in the Gysela code. This\ninitial implementation represents a too large fraction of the total execution\ntime. The gyroaverage operator has been reformulated and is now expressed as a\nmatrix-vector product and a cache-friendly algorithm has been setup. Different\ntechniques have been investigated to quicken the computations by more than a\nfactor two. Description of the algorithms is given, together with an analysis\nof the achieved performance.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a general method to obtain the exact solutions of\nthe degree distributions for RBDN with network size decline. First by\nstochastic process rules, the steady state transformation equations and steady\nstate degree distribution equations are given in the case of m>2, 0<p<1/2 ,\nthen the average degree of network with n nodes is introduced to calculate the\ndegree distribution. Especially, taking m=3 as an example, we explain the\ndetailed solving process, in which computer simulation is used to verify our\ndegree distribution solutions. In addition, the tail characteristics of the\ndegree distribution are discussed. Our findings suggest that the degree\ndistributions will exhibit Poisson tail property for the declining RBDN.\n", "  Site-occupancy disorder, defined as the non-periodic occupation of lattice\nsites in a crystal structure, is a ubiquitous phenomenon in solid-state physics\nand chemistry. Examples are mineral solid solutions, synthetic\nnon-stoichiometric compounds and metal alloys. The experimental investigation\nof these materials using diffraction techniques only provides averaged\ninformation of their structure. However, many properties of interest in these\nsolids are determined by the local geometry and degree of disorder, which\nescape an \"average crystal\" description, either from experiments or from\ntheory. In this paper, we describe a methodology for the computer simulation of\nsite-disordered solids, based on the consideration of configurational ensembles\nand statistical mechanics, where the number of occupancy configurations is\nreduced by taking advantage of the crystal symmetry of the lattice.\nThermodynamics and non-thermodynamic properties are then defined from the\nstatistics in the symmetry-adapted configurational ensemble. We will briefly\nsummarize and discuss some recent applications of this methodology to problems\nin materials science.\n", "  The stress-driven motion of dislocations in crystalline solids, and thus the\nensuing plastic deformation process, is greatly influenced by the presence or\nabsence of various point-like defects such as precipitates or solute atoms.\nThese defects act as obstacles for dislocation motion and hence affect the\nmechanical properties of the material. Here we combine molecular dynamics\nstudies with three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations in\norder to model the interaction between different kinds of precipitates and a\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\langle 1 1 1\\rangle$ $\\{1 1 0\\}$ edge dislocation in BCC iron. We\nhave implemented immobile spherical precipitates into the ParaDis discrete\ndislocation dynamics code, with the dislocations interacting with the\nprecipitates via a Gaussian potential, generating a normal force acting on the\ndislocation segments. The parameters used in the discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations for the precipitate potential, the dislocation mobility, shear\nmodulus and dislocation core energy are obtained from molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We compare the critical stresses needed to unpin the dislocation\nfrom the precipitate in molecular dynamics and discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations in order to fit the two methods together, and discuss the variety\nof the relevant pinning/depinning mechanisms.\n", "  Unipolar pre-seismic magnetic field pulses have been observed first by Bleier\net al. (2009) and Villante et al. (2010) and Nenovski et al. (2013). In the\npresent study a detailed analysis of the pulses is conducted looking for\nsignatures of transient signals similar to that recorded at the 2009 Aquila\nearthquake main shock (Nenovski, 2015). Various magnetic field data around the\nAquila earthquake provide an instrumental basis for such an analysis. In\naddition to fluxgate magnetometer data (already examined in previous studies),\noverhauser magnetometer data are involved. The result is a detection and\ndiscrimination of transient signals of diffusive form that appear prior to the\nearthquake main shock.\n", "  In the present work, we consider a charged black hole in five dimensional\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity where the {\\alpha} corrected entropy term is\nconsidered. We examine the horizon radii product, entropy product, Hawking\ntemperature product and free energy product for both event horizon and Cauchy\nhorizon. Our motive is to check whether the same quantity for event horizon and\nCauchy horizon is free of mass, i.e., global or not. We further study the\nstability of such black hole by computing the specific heat and free energy for\nboth the horizons. All these calculation might be helpful to understand the\nmicroscopic nature of such black holes.\n", "  The distribution of asteroid sizes by semimajor axes and the distribution of\nthe number of asteroids by albedo values for separate families are used to\nselection the asteroid families more clearly. An analysis of the families\nidentified by Masiero et al. (2013) was carried out with the use of the\ndistributions of D(a) and N(p), there were defined correctly and incorrectly\nselected families. A decreasing of the mean albedo with semi-major axis\nincreasing take place almost for all correctly selected families and which are\nnot truncated by resonances. The decrease is statistically significant for the\nmajority of these families. There is none family at a significant increase of\nalbedo. This confirms our previous conclusion on existence of a\nnon-gravitational effect in the asteroid belt which causes the spatial\nseparation of asteroids with different albedos.\n", "  The energy and momentum of the Bianchi type $III$ universes are obtained\nusing different prescriptions for the energy-momentum complexes in the\nframework of General Relativity. The energy and momentum of the Bianchi $III$\nuniverse is found to be zero for the M\\o{}ller prescription. For all other\nprescriptions the energy and momentum vanish when the metric parameter $h$\nvanishes. In an earlier work, Tripathy et al. \\cite{SKT15} have obtained the\nenergy and momentum of Bianchi $VI_h$ metric and found that the energy of the\nUniverse vanish only for $h=-1$. This result raised a question: why this\nspecific choice?. We explored the Tryon's conjecture that 'the Universe must\nhave a zero net value for all conserved quantities' to get some ideas on the\nspecific values of this parameter for Bianchi type Universes.\n", "  A two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbors ferromagnetic\ninteractions is implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\nboard.Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using an efficient\nhardware representation of individual spins and a combined global-local LFSR\nrandom number generator. Consistent results regarding the descriptive\nproperties of magnetic systems, like energy, magnetization and susceptibility\nare obtained while a speed-up factor of approximately 6 times is achieved in\ncomparison to previous FPGA-based published works and almost $10^4$ times in\ncomparison to a standard CPU simulation. A detailed description of the logic\ndesign used is given together with a careful analysis of the quality of the\nrandom number generator used. The obtained results confirm the potential of\nFPGAs for analyzing the statistical mechanics of magnetic systems.\n", "  The article reviews how to measure one and the same photon at both output\nports of a beam splitter.\n", "  We propose a model for membrane-cortex adhesion which couples membrane\ndeformations, hydrodynamics and kinetics of membrane-cortex ligands. In its\nsimplest form, the model gives explicit predictions for the critical pressure\nfor membrane detachment and for the value of adhesion energy. We show that\nthese quantities exhibit a significant dependence on the active acto-myosin\nstresses. The model provides a simple framework to access quantitative\ninformation on cortical activity by means of micropipette experiments. We also\nextend the model to incorporate fluctuations and show that detailed information\non the stability of membrane-cortex coupling can be obtained by a combination\nof micropipette aspiration and fluctuation spectroscopy measurements.\n", "  In this work, two experimentally feasible methods of decoherence\nengineering-one based on the application of stochastic classical kicks and the\nother based on temporally randomized pulse sequences are combined. A different\ncoupling interaction is proposed, which leads to amplitude damping as compared\nto existing methods which model phase damping, utilizing the $zz$ coupling\ninteraction. The decoherence process on combining the stochastic kick method\nand the randomized pulse sequence method and the effectiveness of dynamical\ndecoupling under these coupling interactions are analyzed. Finally, a\ncounter-intuitive result where decoherence is suppressed in the presence of two\nnoise sources under certain resonant conditions is presented.\n", "  We use the renormalization group theory to study the directed bond\npercolation (Gribov process) near its second-order phase transition between\nabsorbing and active state. We present a numerical calculation of the\nrenormalization group functions in the $\\epsilon$-expansion where $\\epsilon$ is\na deviation from the upper critical dimension $d_c = 4$. Within this procedure\nanomalous dimensions $\\gamma$ are expressed in terms of irreducible\nrenormalized Feynman diagrams and thus the calculation of renormalization\nconstants could be entirely skipped. The renormalization group is included by\nmeans of the $R$ operation, and for computational purposes we choose the null\nmomentum subtraction scheme.\n", "  This article considers execution and analysis of laboratory experiments of\npedestrians moving in a quasi-one-dimensional system with periodic boundary\nconditions. To analyze characteristics of jams in the system we aim to use the\nwhole experimental setup as the measurement area. Thus the trajectories are\ntransformed to a new coordinate system. We show that the trajectory data from\nthe straight and curved parts are comparable and assume that the distributions\nof the residuals come from the same continuous distribution. Regarding the\ntrajectories of the entire setup, the creation of stop-and-go waves in\npedestrian traffic can be investigated and described.\n", "  Mesoscopic dynamics of self-organized structures is the most important aspect\nin the description of complex living systems. The Belousov--Zhabotinsky (B--Z)\nreaction is in this respect a convenient testbed because it represents a\nprototype of chemical self-organization with a rich variety of emergent\nwave-spiral patterns. Using a multi-state stochastic hotchpotch model, we show\nhere that the mesoscopic behaviour of the non-stirred B--Z reaction is both\nqualitatively and quantitatively susceptible to the description in terms of\nstochastic multilevel cellular automata. This further implies that the\nmesoscopic dynamics of the non-stirred B--Z reaction results from a delicate\ninterplay between a) a maximal number of available states within the elementary\ntime lag (i.e. a minimal time interval needed for demise of a final state) and\nb) an imprecision or uncertainty in the definition of state. If either the\nnumber of time lags is largely different from 7 or the maximal number of\navailable states is smaller than 20, the physicochemical conditions are\ninappropriate for a formation of the wave-spiral patterns. Furthermore, a white\nnoise seems to be key for the formation of circular structures (target\npatterns) which could not be as yet systematically explained in existing\nmodels.\n", "  We consider the thermodynamics of a horizon surface from the viewpoint of the\nvacuum tension $\\tau =(c^4/4G )$. Numerically, $\\tau \\approx 3.026\\times\n10^{43}$ Newton. In order of magnitude, this is the tension that has been\nproposed for microscopic string models of gravity. However, after decades of\nhard work on string theory models of gravity, there is no firm scientific\nevidence that such models of gravity apply empirically. Our purpose is thereby\nto discuss the gravitational tension in terms of the conventional Einstein\ngeneral theory of relativity that apparently does explain much and maybe all of\npresently known experimental gravity data. The central result is that matter on\nthe horizon surface is bound by the entropy-area law by tension in the closely\nanalogous sense that the Wilson action-area law also describes a surface\nconfinement.\n", "  The magnitude of the work function to bring an electron from a metal into the\nexclusion zone water layer making hydrophilic contact with the metallic\ninterface is theoretically computed. The agreement with recent experimental\nmeasurements is satisfactory.\n", "  This work deals with an inverse boundary value problem arising from the\nequation of heat conduction. We reconstruct small perturbations of the\n(isotropic) heat conductivity distribution from partial (on accessible part of\nthe boundary) dynamic boundary measurements and for finite interval in time. By\nconstructing of appropriate test functions, using a control method, we provide\na rigorous derivation of the inverse Fourier transform of the perturbations in\nthe diffusion coefficient as the leading order of an appropriate averaging of\nthe partial dynamic boundary measurements.\n", "  We extend de la Fuente and Romero's defining equation for uniform\nacceleration in a general curved spacetime from linear acceleration to the full\nLorentz covariant uniform acceleration. In a flat spacetime background, we have\nexplicit solutions. We use generalized Fermi-Walker transport to parallel\ntransport the Frenet basis along the trajectory. In flat spacetime, we obtain\nvelocity and acceleration transformations from a uniformly accelerated system\nto an inertial system. We obtain the time dilation between accelerated clocks.\nWe apply our acceleration transformations to the motion of a charged particle\nin a constant electromagnetic field and recover the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac\nequation.\n", "  Recent VLA and CARMA observations have shown proto-stars in binaries with\nunprecedented resolution. Specifically, the proto-stellar masses of systems\nsuch as CB230 IRS1 and L1165-SMM1 have been detected in the range of $0.1-0.25\n\\, M_{\\odot}$. These are much more massive than the masses generally obtained\nby numerical simulations of binary formation, around $0.01 \\, M_{\\odot}$.\nMotivated by these discrepancies in mass, in this paper we study the formation\nmass of a binary system as a function of the total mass of its parent core. To\nachieve this objective, we present a set of numerical simulations of the\ngravitational collapse of a uniform and rotating core, in which azimuthal\nsymmetric mass seeds are initially implemented in order to favor the formation\nof a dense filament, out of which a binary system may be formed by direct\nfragmentation. We first observed that this binary formation process is\ndiminished when the total mass of the parent core $M_0$ is increased; then we\nincreased the level of the ratio of kinetic energy to the gravitational energy,\ndenoted by $\\beta$, initially supplied to the rotating core, in order to\nachieve the desired direct fragmentation of the filament. Next, we found that\nthe mass of the binary fragment increases with the mass of the parent core, as\nexpected. In this paper we confirm this expectation and also measure the binary\nmass $M_f$ obtained from an initial $M_0$. We then show a schematic diagram\n$M_0$ vs $\\beta$, where the desired binary configurations are located while the\nratio of the thermal energy to the gravitational energy $\\alpha$ is kept fixed.\nWe also report some basic physical data of the proto-stellar fragments that\nform the binary system, including the formation mass $M_f$, and its\ncorresponding $\\alpha_f$ and $\\beta_f$.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the classical Drude model of electrical\nconductivity, one of the fundamental models in the theory of electrical\nconductivity, is inconsistent with the special relativity. Due to this\nincorrect model, a current carrying closed circuit is thought not to produce\nsecond order electric field according to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.\nBut, Edwards et al. detected a small second order electric field radially\npointing toward a current carrying conductor in a superconducting Nb-Ti coil.\nAssis et al. claim to show that Maxwell's theory does not predict any second\norder forces and hence we should take Weber's electrodynamics seriously. But,\nwe show that not only a magnetic field, but also a second order electric field\nis produced in the vicinity of a current carrying conductor, which is\nconsistent with Maxwell's theory. This electric field points radially toward\nthe current carrying conductor as detected in Edwards' experiments. We also\nshow that the positive field, detected by Sansbury in a U-shaped copper\nconductor carrying a constant current, should be created as a consequence of\nour theory. We then estimate the order of the strength of this electric field\nand show that it is in agreement with the experimental values.\n", "  Multi-TeV center of mass energy ep colliders based on the Future Circular\nCollider (FCC) and linear colliders (LC) are proposed and corresponding\nluminosity values are estimated. Parameters of upgraded versions of the FCC are\ndetermined to optimize luminosity of electron-proton collisions keeping\nbeam-beam effects in mind. It is shown that L_{ep}\\sim10^{32}\\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\ncan be achieved with moderate upgrade of the FCC parameters.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors represent the thinnest, air\nstable semiconducting materials known. Their unique optical, electronic and\nmechanical properties hold great potential for harnessing them as key\ncomponents in novel applications for electronics and optoelectronics. However,\nthe charge transport behavior in 2D semiconductors is more susceptible to\nexternal surroundings (e.g. gaseous adsorbates from air and trapped charges in\nsubstrates) and their electronic performance is generally lower than\ncorresponding bulk materials due to the fact that surface and bulk coincide. In\nthis article, we review recent progress on the charge transport properties and\ncarrier mobility engineering of 2D transition metal chalcogenides, with a\nparticular focus on the markedly high dependence of carrier mobility on\nthickness. We unveil the origin of this unique thickness dependence and\nelaborate the devised strategies to master it for carrier mobility\noptimization. Specifically, physical and chemical methods towards the\noptimization of the major factors influencing the extrinsic transport such as\nelectrode/semiconductor contacts, interfacial Coulomb impurities and atomic\ndefects are discussed. In particular, the use of \\textit{ad-hoc} molecules\nmakes it possible to engineer the interface with the dielectric and heal the\nvacancies in such materials. By casting fresh light onto the theoretical and\nexperimental works, we provide a guide for improving the electronic performance\nof the 2D semiconductors, with the ultimate goal of achieving technologically\nviable atomically thin (opto)electronics.\n", "  We introduce an algorithm to estimate the redshift distribution of a sample\nof galaxies selected photometrically given a subsample with measured\nspectroscopic redshifts. The approach uses a non-parametric Voronoi\ntessellation density estimator to interpolate the galaxy distribution in the\nredshift and photometric color space. We test the method on a mock dataset with\na known color-redshift distribution. We find that the Voronoi tessellation\nestimator performs well at reconstructing the tails of the redshift\ndistribution of individual galaxies and gives unbiased estimates of the first\nand second moments. The source code is publicly available at\nhttp://bitbucket.org/bengranett/tailz.\n", "  The covariant St\\\"{u}ckelberg formalism is applied to bi-gravity in order to\nrevisit the issue of absence of the Boulware-Deser (BD) ghost. We first confirm\nthat the leading order action in the decoupling limit for helicity-2 modes of\nmetrics and helicity-0 mode of St\\\"{u}ckelberg perturbations does not lead to\nhigher time derivative in equations of motion, which suggests the absence of\nthe BD ghost. By extending this method, we reconfirm that the BD ghost does not\nappear for arbitrary order of the perturbations at the decoupling limit in\nbi-gravity.\n", "  The data of ground-based telescopes of Global Oscillation Network Group\n(GONG) obtained in the H-alpha line provide an opportunity to study the\nlong-period oscillations of chromospheric filaments (quiescent prominence). For\nthe first time, on the base of time-series of 5 days duration, combined from\nthe observations of three observatories of the GONG, a new ultra-low mode, with\nperiod between 20 and 30 hours, was reliably detected in oscillations of a\nlong-lived dark filament on the solar disc.\n", "  Stokes perturbative solution of the nonlinear (boundary value dependent)\nsurface gravity wave problem is known to provide results of reasonable accuracy\nto engineers in estimating the phase speed and amplitudes of such nonlinear\nwaves. The weakling in this structure though is the presence of aperiodic\nsecular variation in the solution that does not agree with the known periodic\npropagation of surface waves. This has historically necessitated increasingly\nhigher ordered (perturbative) approximations in the representation of the\nvelocity profile. The present article ameliorates this long standing\ntheoretical insufficiency by invoking a compact exact $n$-ordered solution in\nthe asymptotic infinite depth limit, primarily based on a representation\nstructured around the third ordered perturbative solution, that leads to a\nseamless extension to higher order (e.g. fifth order) forms existing in the\nliterature. The result from this study is expected to improve phenomenological\nengineering estimates, now that any desired higher ordered expansion may be\ncompacted within the same representation, but without any aperiodicity in the\nspectral pattern of the wave guides.\n", "  The European School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young\nphysicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances in\nelementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on quantum\nfield theory and the Standard Model, quantum chromodynamics, flavour physics,\nneutrino physics, physics beyond the Standard Model, cosmology, heavy ion\nphysics, statistical data analysis, as well as an account for the physics\nresults with the data accumulated during the first run of the LHC.\n", "  We present the results of 3D, high-resolution calculations of neutron star\nmergers. Using Newtonian gravity, but adding the forces from the emission of\ngravitational waves, we solve the hydrodynamics equations using the smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics method. The microscopic properties of the neutron star\nmatter are described in terms of a new nuclear equation of state (EOS) based on\nthe tables of Shen et al. (1998). The effects of neutrino emission of all\nflavours are accounted for. The new EOS is noticeably stiffer than the\nLattimer-Swesty-EOS used in previous investigations. We find in general\nsomewhat lower temperatures than previous investigations. This allows a\nsubstantial fraction of heavy nuclei to be present even in the inner parts of\nthe torus that forms around the central object and yields important\ncontributions to the neutrino opacity. The central object shows a rapid\ndifferential rotation with periods of $\\sim$ 2ms, which we suspect to stabilize\nthe central object on (at least) the simulation time scale against\ngravitational collapse. The differential rotation could wind up initial\nmagnetic fields to $\\sim 10^17$ G.\n", "  Arrival directions of extensive air showers by using world data are\nconsidered. It is found that the shower distribution in zenith angle at the\nenergies E>10^{19} eV and E>4x10^{19} eV differs from each other. By our\nestimations, the shower with E>10^{20} eV at the Sugar array was not\nregistered. The mass composition of very high-energy cosmic rays has been\nestimated. It is shown that E>4x10^{19} eV cosmic rays are, most likely, super\nheavy nuclei with charge Z>26.\n", "  SDSS (DR1 and DR2) has recently proposed 7 new DO white dwarfs as well as 6\nnew PG1159 stars. This is a significant increase in the known number of DOs and\nPG1159 stars. Our spectral analyses provide stellar parameters which can then\nbe used to derive constraints for the evolution of H-deficient white dwarfs. A\ncomprehensive understanding of these objects is still severely hampered by\nlow-number statistics.\n", "  We present here the computer model of the distribution of the luminosity,\nproduced by old isolated neutron stars (OINSs) accreting from the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). We show, that for different mean velocities of OINSs the\ndistribution of the luminosity has a torus-like structure, with the maximum at\n$\\approx 5 kpc$.\n", "  The data of BVR observations of the middle-aged radio pulsar PSR 0656+14 on\nJanuary, 20/21 at the BTA (6-m) are presented. The brightness is determined in\nCousins B filter B ~~25.1 with lambda_eff=4448A in adjacent for HST F130LP\nlong-pass filter of a star-like object, coinsiding with the position of VLA\nradio source. Relatively large observed V and R fluxes (<~3sigma or > 10E-30\nergs cm^-2 s^-2 Hz^-1) can witness a non-thermal nature of optical radiation of\nthis pulsar up to lambda~~6600A. Most probably in the UV-optical (BVR) spectral\nrange a power-law spectrum is superimposed on the thermal-like radiation of the\nentire neutron star surface what can be related to a mechanism itself of the\npulsar activity.\n", "  Cosmology is very exciting for three reasons. There is a very successful\nstandard model - the hot big bang - which describes the evolution of the\nUniverse from 10^{-2} sec onward. There are bold ideas, foremost among them are\ninflation and cold dark matter, which can extend the standard cosmology to\nwithin 10^{-32} sec of the bang and address some of the most fundamental\nquestions in cosmology. There is a flood of data - from determinations of the\nHubble constant to measurements of CBR anisotropy - that are testing inflation\nand cold dark matter.\n", "  If the universe is finite and smaller than the distance to the surface of\nlast scatter, then the signature of the topology of the universe is writ on the\nmicrowave background sky. Previous efforts to search for this topology have\nfocused on one particular model: a toroidal flat universe. We show how both the\nhigh degree of spatial symmetry of this topology and the integrability of its\ngeodesics make it unreliable as a paradigmatic example, and discuss why\ntopology on scales significantly smaller than the horizon are not ruled out by\nprevious analyses focussing on this special case. We show that in these small\nuniverses the microwave background will be identified at the intersections of\nthe surface of last scattering as seen by different ``copies'' of the observer.\nSince the surface of last scattering is a sphere, these intersections will be\ncircles, regardless of the background geometry or topology. We therefore\npropose a statistic that is sensitive to all small finite homogeneous\ntopologies. Here, small means that the distance to the surface of last scatter\nis smaller than the ``periodicity scale'' of the universe.\n", "  Recent evidence for pentaquark baryons in the channels $\\Xi^-\\pi^-$,\n$\\Xi^-\\pi^+$ and their anti-particles claimed by the NA49 collaboration is\ncritically confronted with the vast amount of existing data on $\\Xi$\nspectroscopy which was accumulated over the past decades. It is shown that the\nclaim is at least partially inconsistent with these data. In addition two\nfurther exotic channels of the pentaquark type available in the NA49 data are\ninvestigated. It is argued that this study leads to internal inconsistency with\nthe purported signals.\n", "  We describe a cosmology of the very early universe, based on the holographic\nprinciple of 't Hooft and Susskind. We have described the initial state as a\ndense black hole fluid. Here we present a mathematical model of this heuristic\npicture, as well as a non-rigorous discussion of how a more normal universe\ncould evolve out of such a state. The gross features of the cosmology depend on\na few parameters, which cannot yet be calculated from first principles. For\nsome range of these parameters, microwave background fluctuations originate\nfrom fluctuations in the black hole fluid, and have characteristics different\nfrom those of most inflationary models.\n"]}
