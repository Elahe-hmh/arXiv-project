valued\nmeasures (PObVMs) [which serve to connect state-induced expectation values and\nclassical probabilities] and the `CC condition' [which stipulates that the sets\nof observables and pure states be mutually separating] is proposed as a\nuniversal mechanics potentially covering all physical phenomena. It facilitates\ndevelopment of an autonomous formalism for quantum mechanics. Quantum systems,\ndefined algebraically as supmech Hamiltonian systems with non-supercommutative\nsystem algebras, are shown to inevitably have Hilbert space based realizations\n(so as to accommodate rigged Hilbert space based Dirac bra-ket formalism),\ngenerally admitting commutative superselection rules. Traditional features of\nquantum mechanics of finite particle systems appear naturally. A treatment of\nlocalizability much simpler and more general than the traditional one is given.\nTreating massive particles as localizable elementary quantum systems, the\nSchr$\\ddot{o}$dinger wave functions with traditional Born interpretation appear\nas natural objects for the description of their pure states and the\nSchr$\\ddot{o}$dinger equation for them is obtained without ever using a\nclassical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. A provisional set of axioms for the\nsupmech program is given.\n", "  We introduce a higher rank analog of the Pandharipande-Thomas theory of\nstable pairs on a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$. More precisely, we develop a moduli\ntheory for frozen triples given by the data $O^r(-n)\\rightarrow F$ where $F$ is\na sheaf of pure dimension 1. The moduli space of such objects does not\nnaturally determine an enumerative theory: that is, it does not naturally\npossess a perfect symmetric obstruction theory. Instead, we build a\nzero-dimensional virtual fundamental class by hand, by truncating a\ndeformation-obstruction theory coming from the moduli of objects in the derived\ncategory of $X$. This yields the first deformation-theoretic construction of a\nhigher-rank enumerative theory for Calabi-Yau threefolds. We calculate this\nenumerative theory for local $\\mathbb{P}^1$ using the Graber-Pandharipande\nvirtual localization technique.\n", "  We introduce a higher rank analog of the Joyce-Song theory of stable pairs.\nGiven a nonsingular projective Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, we define the higher\nrank Joyce-Song pairs given by ${O}^{r}_{X}(-n)\\rightarrow F$ where $F$ is a\npure coherent sheaf with one dimensional support, $r>1$ and $n\\gg 0$ is a fixed\ninteger. We equip the higher rank pairs with a Joyce-Song stability condition\nand compute their associated invariants using the wallcrossing techniques in\nthe category of weakly semistable objects.\n", "  The thermal conductivity k of the iron-arsenide superconductor K-Ba122 was\nmeasured down to 50 mK in a magnetic field up to 15 T, for a heat current\nparallel and perpendicular to the tetragonal c axis. In the range from optimal\ndoping (x ~ 0.4) down to x = 0.16, there is no residual linear term in k(T) at\nT = 0, showing that there are no nodes in the superconducting gap anywhere on\nthe Fermi surface. Upon crossing below x = 0.16, a large residual linear term\nsuddenly appears, signaling the onset of nodes in the superconducting gap, most\nlikely vertical line nodes running along the c axis. We discuss two scenarios:\n1) accidental nodes in an s-wave gap, resulting from a strong modulation of the\ngap around the Fermi surface, in which minima deepen rapidly with underdoping;\n2) a phase transition from a nodeless s-wave state to a d-wave state, in which\nnodes are imposed by symmetry.\n", "  We characterise the performance of a surface-electrode ion \"chip\" trap\nfabricated using established semiconductor integrated circuit and\nmicro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) microfabrication processes which are in\nprinciple scalable to much larger ion trap arrays, as proposed for implementing\nion trap quantum information processing. We measure rf ion micromotion parallel\nand perpendicular to the plane of the trap electrodes, and find that on-package\ncapacitors reduce this to <~ 10 nm in amplitude. We also measure ion trapping\nlifetime, charging effects due to laser light incident on the trap electrodes,\nand the heating rate for a single trapped ion. The performance of this trap is\nfound to be comparable with others of the same size scale.\n", "  This is the first of a sequence of papers proving the quantum invariance\nunder ordinary flops over an arbitrary smooth base.\n  In this first part, we determine the defect of the cup product under the\ncanonical correspondence and show that it is corrected by the small quantum\nproduct attached to the extremal ray. We then perform various reductions to\nreduce the problem to the local models.\n  In Part II, we develop a quantum Leray--Hirsch theorem and use it to show\nthat the big quantum cohomology ring is invariant under analytic continuations\nin the K\\\"ahler moduli space for ordinary flops of splitting type. In Part III,\ntogether with F. Qu, we remove the splitting condition by developing a quantum\nsplitting principle, and hence solve the problem completely.\n", "  Laser-cleaning of the electrodes in a planar micro-fabricated ion trap has\nbeen attempted using ns pulses from a tripled Nd:YAG laser at 355nm. The effect\nof the laser pulses at several energy density levels has been tested by\nmeasuring the heating rate of a single 40Ca+ trapped ion as a function of its\nsecular frequency. A reduction of the electric-field noise spectral density by\n~50% has been observed and a change in the frequency dependence also noticed.\nThis is the first reported experiment where the \"anomalous heating\" phenomenon\nhas been reduced by removing the source as opposed to reducing its thermal\ndriving by cryogenic cooling. This technique may open the way to better control\nof the electrode surface quality in ion microtraps.\n", "  Recently, we introduced a new procedure for computing a class of one-loop\nBPS-saturated amplitudes in String Theory, which expresses them as a sum of\none-loop contributions of all perturbative BPS states in a manifestly T-duality\ninvariant fashion. In this paper, we extend this procedure to all BPS-saturated\namplitudes of the form \\int_F \\Gamma_{d+k,d} {\\Phi}, with {\\Phi} being a weak\n(almost) holomorphic modular form of weight -k/2. We use the fact that any such\n{\\Phi} can be expressed as a linear combination of certain absolutely\nconvergent Poincar\\'e series, against which the fundamental domain F can be\nunfolded. The resulting BPS-state sum neatly exhibits the singularities of the\namplitude at points of gauge symmetry enhancement, in a chamber-independent\nfashion. We illustrate our method with concrete examples of interest in\nheterotic string compactifications.\n", "  We investigate the ground and low energy states of a one dimensional non\nlocal free energy functional describing at a mean field level a spin system\nwith both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. In particular, the\nantiferromagnetic interaction is assumed to have a range much larger than the\nferromagnetic one. The competition between these two effects is expected to\nlead to the spontaneous emergence of a regular alternation of long intervals on\nwhich the spin profile is magnetized either up or down, with an oscillation\nscale intermediate between the range of the ferromagnetic and that of the\nantiferromagnetic interaction. In this sense, the optimal or quasi-optimal\nprofiles are \"froth-like\": if seen on the scale of the antiferromagnetic\npotential they look neutral, but if seen at the microscope they actually\nconsist of big bubbles of two different phases alternating among each other. In\nthis paper we prove the validity of this picture, we compute the oscillation\nscale of the quasi-optimal profiles and we quantify their distance in norm from\na reference periodic profile. The proof consists of two main steps: we first\ncoarse grain the system on a scale intermediate between the range of the\nferromagnetic potential and the expected optimal oscillation scale; in this way\nwe reduce the original functional to an effective \"sharp interface\" one. Next,\nwe study the latter by reflection positivity methods, which require as a key\ningredient the exact locality of the short range term. Our proof has the\nconceptual interest of combining coarse graining with reflection positivity\nmethods, an idea that is presumably useful in much more general contexts than\nthe one studied here.\n", "  The goal of this work is to develop a simple analytic description of the\nemission properties (spectrum and polarization) of the condensed, strongly\nmagnetized surface of neutron stars. We have improved the method of van\nAdelsberg et al. (2005) (arXiv:astro-ph/0406001) for calculating the spectral\nproperties of condensed magnetized surfaces. Using the improved method, we\ncalculate the reflectivity of an iron surface at magnetic field strengths B\n\\sim (10^{12} - 10^{14}) G, with various inclinations of the magnetic field\nlines and radiation beam with respect to the surface and each other. We\nconstruct analytic expressions for the emissivity of this surface as functions\nof the photon energy, magnetic field strength, and the three angles that\ndetermine the geometry of the local problem. Using these expressions, we\ncalculate X-ray spectra for neutron stars with condensed iron surfaces covered\nby thin partially ionized hydrogen atmospheres. We develop simple analytic\ndescriptions of the intensity and polarization of radiation emitted or\nreflected by condensed iron surfaces of neutron stars with strong magnetic\nfields typical for isolated neutron stars. This description provides boundary\nconditions at the bottom of a thin atmosphere, which are more accurate than\npreviously used approximations. The spectra calculated with this improvement\nshow absorption features different from those in simplified models. The\napproach developed in this paper yields results that can facilitate modeling\nand interpretation of the X-ray spectra of isolated, strongly magnetized,\nthermally emitting neutron stars.\n", "  We show how the recently developed theory of geodesic transport barriers for\nfluid flows can be used to uncover key invariant manifolds in externally\nforced, one-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems. Specifically, invariant sets\nin such systems turn out to be shadowed by least-stretching geodesics of the\nCauchy-Green strain tensor computed from the flow map of the forced mechanical\nsystem. This approach enables the finite-time visualization of generalized\nstable and unstable manifolds, attractors and generalized KAM curves under\narbitrary forcing, when Poincare maps are not available. We illustrate these\nresults by detailed visualizations of the key finite-time invariant sets of\nconservatively and dissipatively forced Duffing oscillators.\n", "  The non-linear second order Born-Infeld equation is reduced to a simpler\nfirst order complex equation, which can be trivially solved for the coordinates\nas functions of the field. Each solution is determined by the choice of a\nholomorphic function subjected to boundary conditions. The explanation of the\nmethod is accompanied by applications to Born-Infeld electrostatics,\nmagnetostatics and wave propagation.\n", "  It is shown that the results of CP and T violation experiments can be\ninterpreted using a very general framework that does not require a Hilbert\nspace of states or linear operators to represent the symmetries or dynamics.\nAnalysis within this general framework brings out the aspects of quantum\nmechanics that are essential for this interpretation. More importantly, should\nquantum mechanics be eventually replaced by a new paradigm, this framework\ncould \\emph{still} be used to establish violation of CP and T invariance from\nthe already known experimental results.\n  This work arose as a `formal response' to a talk \"Three Merry Roads to\nT-Violation\" by Dr. Bryan Roberts [1]. Both talks were given at a \"Workshop on\nCosmology and Time\" held at Penn State in April 2013, which brought together\nphysicists and philosophers of science.\n", "  We report the detection of quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at ~41 mHz in the\ntransient high-mass Be/X-ray binary pulsar 4U~0115+634 using data from the\nRossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observatory. The observations used in the\npresent work were carried out during X-ray outbursts in 1999 March-April, 2004\nSeptember-October and 2008 March-April. This frequency of the newly detected\nQPO was found to vary in 27-46 mHz range. This ~41 mHz QPO was detected in four\nof the 36 pointed RXTE Proportional Counter Array (PCA) observations during\n1999 outburst where as during 2004 and 2008 outbursts, it was detected in four\nand three times out of 33 and 26 observations, respectively. Though QPOs at ~2\nmHz, and ~62 mHz were reported earlier, the ~41 mHz QPO and its first harmonic\nwere detected for the first time in this pulsar. There are three RXTE/PCA\nobservations where multiple QPOs were detected in the power density spectrum of\n4U~0115+634. Simultaneous presence of multiple QPOs is rarely seen in accretion\npowered X-ray pulsars. Spectral analysis of all the pointed RXTE/PCA\nobservations revealed that the 3-30 keV energy spectrum was well described by\nNegative and Positive Power-law with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model\nalong with interstellar absorption and cyclotron absorption components. During\nthe three X-ray outbursts, however, no systematic variation in any of the\nspectral parameters other than the earlier reported anti-correlation between\ncyclotron absorption energy and luminosity was seen. Presence of any systematic\nvariation of QPO frequency and rms of QPO with source flux were also\ninvestigated yielding negative results.\n", "  In rare-earth doped single crystalline CaFe2As2, the mysterious small volume\nfraction which superconducts up to 49 K, much higher than the bulk Tc ~ 30s K,\nhas prompted a long search for a hidden variable that could enhance the Tc by\nmore than 30% in iron-based superconductors of the same structure. Here we\nreport a chemical, structural, and magnetic study of CaFe2As2 systematically\ndoped with La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. Coincident with the high Tc phase, we find\nextreme magnetic anisotropy, accompanied by an unexpected doping-independent Tc\nand equally unexpected superparamagnetic clusters associated with As vacancies.\nThese observations lead us to conjecture that the tantalizing Tc enhancement\nmay be associated with naturally occurring chemical interfaces and may thus\nprovide a new paradigm in the search for superconductors with higher Tc.\n", "  Let X be the total space of the canonical bundle of P^2. We study the\ngeneralized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, defined in the work of Joyce-Song, of\nthe moduli spaces of the 2-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on X with\nfirst Chern class equal to k times the class of the zero section of X. When\nk=1, 2 or 3, and semistability implies stability, we express the invariants in\nterms of known modular forms. We prove a combinatorial formula for the\ninvariants when k=2 in the presence of the strictly semistable sheaves, and\nverify the BPS integrality conjecture of Joyce-Song in some cases.\n", "  In Deepak Dhar's model of abelian distributed processors, automata occupy the\nvertices of a graph and communicate via the edges. We show that two simple\naxioms ensure that the final output does not depend on the order in which the\nautomata process their inputs. A collection of automata obeying these axioms is\ncalled an \"abelian network\". We prove a least action principle for abelian\nnetworks. As an application, we show how abelian networks can solve certain\nlinear and nonlinear integer programs asynchronously.\n  In most previously studied abelian networks, the input alphabet of each\nautomaton consists of a single letter; in contrast, we propose two non-unary\nexamples of abelian networks: \"oil and water\" and \"abelian mobile agents\".\n", "  We present timing and broad-band spectral studies of the high mass X-ray\nbinary pulsar 4U 1909+07 using data from Suzaku observation during 2010\nNovember 2-3. The pulse period of the pulsar is estimated to be 604.11+/-0.14\ns. Pulsations are seen in the X-ray light curve up to ~70 keV. The pulse\nprofile is found to be strongly energy-dependent: a complex, multi-peaked\nstructure at low energy that becomes a simple single peak at higher energy. We\nfound that the 1-70 keV pulse averaged continuum can be fitted by the sum of a\nblack body and a partial covering Negative and Positive power-law with\nEXponential cutoff (NPEX) model. A weak iron fluorescence emission line at 6.4\nkeV was detected in the spectrum. An absorption like feature at ~44 keV was\nclearly seen in the residue of the spectral fitting, independent of the\ncontinuum model adopted. To check the possible presence of a CRSF in the\nspectrum, we normalized the pulsar spectrum with the spectrum of the Crab\nNebula. The resulting Crab ratio also showed a clear dip centered at ~44 keV.\nWe performed statistical tests on the residue of the spectral fitting and also\non the Crab spectral ratio to determine the significance of the absorption like\nfeature and identified it as a CRSF of the pulsar. We estimated the\ncorresponding surface magnetic field of the pulsar to be 3.8 x 10^12 Gauss.\n", "  Recent reports of interface-induced superconductivity in the unit-cell films\nof FeSe on SrTiO3 with a Tc up to ~ 65+-5 K, highest among the Fe-based\nsuperconductors and second only to that of the cuprates, have generated great\nexcitement. Here we show results of the first magnetic and resistive\ninvestigation on the 1-4 unit-cell FeSe-films on SrTiO3. The samples display\nthe Meissner state below ~ 20 K with a penetration field as low as 0.1 Oe due\nto large edge effect at 2 K, a mesoscopic superconducting state comprising\npatches of dimension < 1 micrometer up to 45~55 K and an unusual relaxation of\nthe diamagnetic signal up to 80 K, suggesting possible superconductivity at\nthis high temperature. The observations demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of\nthe superconducting state in these films and offer new insights into the role\nof interfaces in high temperature superconductivity proposed and future\nsuperconducting electronics fabricated.\n", "  The first three sections of this article contain a broad brush summary of the\nprofound changes in the notion of time in fundamental physics that were brought\nabout by three revolutions: the foundations of mechanics distilled by Newton in\nhis Principia, the discovery of special relativity by Einstein and its\nreformulation by Minkowski, and, finally, the fusion of geometry and gravity in\nEinstein's general relativity. The fourth section discusses two aspects of yet\nanother deep revision that waits in the wings as we attempt to unify general\nrelativity with quantum physics.\n", "  An ab initio calculation of the sum rules of the neutral weak response\nfunctions in $^{12}$C is reported, based on a realistic Hamiltonian, including\ntwo- and three-nucleon potentials, and on realistic currents, consisting of\none- and two-body terms. We find that the sum rules of the response functions\nassociated with the longitudinal and transverse components of the (space-like)\nneutral current are largest and that a significant portion ($\\simeq 30$ %) of\nthe calculated strength is due to two-body terms. This fact may have\nimplications for the MiniBooNE and other neutrino quasi-elastic scattering data\non nuclei.\n", "  We study a class of Hermitian random matrices which includes and generalizes\nWigner matrices, heavy-tailed random matrices, and sparse random matrices such\nas the adjacency matrices of Erdos-Renyi random graphs with p ~ 1/N. Our NxN\nrandom matrices have real entries which are i.i.d. up to symmetry. The\ndistributions may depend on N, however, the sums of rows must converge in\ndistribution; it is then well-known that the limiting distributions are\ninfinitely divisible.\n  We show that a limiting empirical spectral distribution (LSD) exists, and via\nlocal weak convergence of associated graphs, the LSD corresponds to the\nspectral measure at the root of a Poisson weighted infinite skeleton tree. This\ngraph is formed by connecting infinitely many Poisson weighted infinite trees\nusing a backbone structure. One example covered by the results are matrices\nwith i.i.d. entries having infinite second moments, but normalized to be in the\nGaussian domain of attraction. In this case, the limiting graph is just the\npositive integer line rooted at 1, and as expected, the LSD is Wigner's\nsemi-circle law. The results also extend to self-adjoint complex matrices and\nalso to Wishart matrices.\n", "  We study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of W states analytically with\nrespect to SU(2) rotations in the basic decoherence channels i.e. depolarizing\n(DPC), amplitude damping (ADC) and phase damping (PDC), and present the\ninteresting behavior of QFI of W states, especially when compared to that of\nGHZ states [Ma et al., Phys. Rev. A, 84, 022302 (2011)]. We find that when\ninitially pure W states are under decoherence, i) DPC: as decoherence starts\nand increases, QFI smoothly decays; ii) ADC: just as decoherence starts, QFI\nexhibits a sudden drop to the shot noise level and as decoherence increases,\nQFI continues to decrease to zero and then increases back to the shot noise\nlevel; iii) PDC: just as decoherence starts, a sudden death of QFI occurs and\nQFI remains zero for any rate of decoherence, therefore W states in phase\ndamping channel do not provide phase sensitivity. We also find that, on the\ncontrary to GHZ states, pure or decohered W states are not sensitive with\nrespect to rotations in z direction and the sensitivities with respect to\nrotations in x and y directions are equal to each other, implying no sudden\nchange points of QFI due to competition between directions.\n", "  We first formulate, in the framework of effective Lagrangian, the general\nform of the effective interactions of the lightest Higgs boson h and a heavier\nneutral Higgs boson H in a multi-Higgs system taking account of Higgs mixing\neffect. We regard h as the discovered Higgs boson which has been shown to be\nconsistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The obtained effective\ninteractions contain extra parameters reflecting the Higgs mixing effect. Next,\nWe study the constraints on the anomalous coupling constants of H from both the\nrequirement of the unitarity of the S matrix and the exclusion bounds on the SM\nHiggs boson obtained from the experimental data at the 7--8 TeV LHC. From this\nwe obtain the available range of the anomalous coupling constants of H, with\nwhich H is not excluded by the yet known theoretical and experimental\nconstraints. We then study the signatures of H at the 14 TeV LHC. In this\npaper, we suggest taking weak-boson scattering and pp to VH* to VVV as\nsensitive processes for probing H model independently at the 14 TeV LHC. We\ntake several examples with the anomalous HVV coupling constants in the\navailable ranges to do the numerical study. a full tree-level calculation at\nthe hadron level is given with signals and backgrounds carefully calculated. We\nimpose a series of proper kinematic cuts to effectively suppress the\nbackgrounds. It is shown that, in both the VV scattering and the pp to VH* to\nVVV processes, H boson can be discovered from the invariant mass distributions\nof the final state particles with reasonable integrated luminosity. Especially,\nin the pp to VH* to VVV process, the invariant mass distribution of the final\nstate jets can show a clear resonance peak of H. Finally, we propose several\nphysical observables from which the values of the anomalous coupling constants\nf_W and f_{WW} can be measured experimentally.\n", "  We consider a transmission line resonator which is driven by electrons\ntunneling through a voltage-biased tunnel junction. Using the Born-Markovian\nquantum master equation in the polaron basis we investigate the nonequilibrium\nphoton state and emission spectrum of the resonator as well as properties of\nthe transport current across the tunnel junction and its noise spectrum. The\nelectroluminescence is optimized, with maximum peak height and narrow\nlinewidth, when the back-action of the tunnel junction on the resonator and the\ndecay rate of the resonator are similar in strength. For strong coupling\nbetween the resonator and tunnel junction, multi-photon effects show up in the\nnoise spectrum of the transport current.\n", "  Given a holomorphic iterated function scheme with a finite symmetry group\n$G$, we show that the associated dynamical zeta function factorizes into\nsymmetry-reduced analytic zeta functions that are parametrized by the unitary\nirreducible representations of $G$. We show that this factorization implies a\nfactorization of the Selberg zeta function on symmetric $n$-funneled surfaces\nand that the symmetry factorization simplifies the numerical calculations of\nthe resonances by several orders of magnitude. As an application this allows us\nto provide a detailed study of the spectral gap and we observe for the first\ntime the existence of a macroscopic spectral gap on Schottky surfaces.\n", "  We study the geodesic two- and three-point functions of random weighted cubic\nmaps, which are obtained by assigning random edge lengths to random cubic\nplanar maps. Explicit expressions are obtained by taking limits of recently\nestablished bivariate multi-point functions of general planar maps. We give an\nalternative interpretation of the two-point function in terms of an Eden model\nexploration process on a random planar triangulation. Finally, the scaling\nlimits of the multi-point functions are studied, showing in particular that the\ntwo- and three-point functions of the Brownian map are recovered as the number\nof faces is taken to infinity.\n", "  The lepton flavor violating decay of the Higgs boson $H\\to l_Al_B$ is studied\nwithin two qualitatively different extensions of the Yukawa sector: one\nrenormalizable and the other nonrenormalizable; both incorporating Lorentz\nviolation in a model-independent fashion. These extensions are characterized by\nYukawa-like matrices, the former by a constant Lorentz 2-tensor $Y^{AB}_{\\mu\n\\nu}$, whereas the latter by a constant Lorentz vector $Y^{AB}_\\mu$. It is\nfound that the experimental constraints on the decays $l_A\\to l_B\\gamma$\nseverely restrict lepton flavor violating Higgs signals in the renormalizable\nscenario. In this context, it is found that $BR(H\\to \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp)$ and\n$BR(H\\to \\tau^\\pm \\mu^\\mp)$ cannot be larger than $10^{-18}$ and $10^{-11}$,\nrespectively. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, transitions mediated by the\nHiggs or the $Z$ gauge boson are induced at tree level, and we find mild\nrestrictions on lepton flavor violation. Using the experimental limits on the\nthree-body decays $l_A \\to l_B \\bar{l}_Cl_C$ to constraint the vector\n$Y^{AB}_\\mu$, it is found that the branching ratio for the decays $H\\to \\mu^\\pm\ne^\\mp$ is of about $4\\times 10^{-9}$, more important, a branching ratio of\n$7\\times 10^{-4}$ is found for the $\\tau^\\pm \\mu^\\mp$ mode. Accordingly, the\ndecay $H \\to \\tau^\\pm \\mu^\\mp$ could be at the reach of future measurements.\nThe lepton flavor violating decays of the $Z$ gauge boson were also studied. In\nthe renormalizable scenario, it was found the undetectable branching ratios\n$BR(Z\\to \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp)<5.7\\times 10^{-21}$ and $BR(Z\\to \\tau^\\pm\n\\mu^\\mp)<2.0\\times 10^{-12}$. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, it was found\nthat $BR(Z\\to \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp)<0.67\\times 10^{-12}$ and $BR(Z\\to \\tau^\\pm\n\\mu^\\mp)<1.12\\times 10^{-7}$. Although the latter branching ratio is relatively\nlarge, it still could not be within the range of future measurements.\n", "  Jupiter's zonal jets and Great Red Spot are well known from still images. Yet\nthe planet's atmosphere is highly unsteady, which suggests that the actual\nmaterial transport barriers delineating its main features should be\ntime-dependent. Rare video footages of Jupiter's clouds provide an opportunity\nto verify this expectation from optically reconstructed velocity fields.\nAvailable videos, however, provide short-time and temporally aperiodic velocity\nfields that defy classical dynamical systems analyses focused on asymptotic\nfeatures. To this end, we use here the recent theory of geodesic transport\nbarriers to uncover finite-time mixing barriers in the wind field extracted\nfrom a video captured by NASA's Cassini space mission. More broadly, the\napproach described here provides a systematic and frame-invariant way to\nextract dynamic coherent structures from time-resolved remote observations of\nunsteady continua.\n", "  We study the ergodic properties of eigenfunctions of Schr\\\"odinger operators\non a closed connected Riemannian manifold $M$ in case that the underlying\nHamiltonian system possesses certain symmetries. More precisely, let $M$ carry\nan isometric effective action of a compact connected Lie group $G$. We prove an\nequivariant quantum ergodicity theorem assuming that the symmetry-reduced\nHamiltonian flow on the principal stratum of the singular symplectic reduction\nof $M$ is ergodic. We deduce the theorem by proving an equivariant version of\nthe semiclassical Weyl law, relying on recent results on singular equivariant\nasymptotics. It implies an equivariant version of the\nShnirelman-Zelditch-Colin-de-Verdi\\`{e}re theorem, as well as a representation\ntheoretic equidistribution theorem. In case that $G$ is trivial, one recovers\nthe classical results.\n", "  The fast evolution of microstructure is key to understanding crackling\nphenomena. It has been proposed that formation of a nonlinear zone around a\nmoving crack tip controls the crack tip velocity. Progress in understanding the\nphysics of this critical zone has been limited due to the lack of hard data\ndescribing the detailed complex physical processes that occur within. For the\nfirst time, we show that the signature of the non-linear elastic zone around a\nmicroscopic dynamic crack maps directly to generic phases of acoustic noises,\nsupporting the formation of a strongly weak zone near the moving crack tips. We\nadditionally show that the rate of traversing to non-linear zone controls the\nrate of weakening, i.e. speed of global rupture propagation. We measure the\npower-law dependence of nonlinear zone size on the traversing rate, and show\nthat our observations are in agreement with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) .\n", "  The $D^*\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ and $D\\bar{D}'^*(2600)$ interactions are studied in\na one-boson-exchange model. Isovector bound state solutions with spin parity\n$J^P=1^{+}$ are found from the $D^*\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ interaction, which may be\nrelated to the observed charged charmonium-like state $Z(4430)$. There is no\nbound state solution found from the $D\\bar{D}'^*(2600)$ interaction.\n", "  We describe how multirefence dynamic correlation theories can be naturally\nobtained as single-reference correlation theories in a canonically transformed\nframe. Such canonically transformed correlation theories are very simple and\ninvolve identical expressions to their single-reference counterparts. The\ncorresponding excitations involve quasiparticles rather than the bare particles\nof the system. High-order density matrices (or their approximations) and the\nnumerical metric instabilities common to multireference correlation theories do\nnot appear. As an example, we formulate the Bogoliubov canonically transformed\nversion of second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory and demonstrate\nits performance in hydrogen, water, nitrogen, and BeH$_2$ bond dissociation.\n", "  In this work we analyze the dynamics of collisionless self-gravitating\nsystems described by the f(R)-gravity and Boltzmann equation in the weak field\napproximation, focusing on the Jeans instability for theses systems. The field\nequations in this approximation were obtained within the Palatini formalism.\nThrough the solution of coupled equations we achieved the collapse criterion\nfor infinite homogeneous fluid and stellar systems, which is given by a\ndispersion relation. This result is compared with the results of the standard\ncase and the case for f(R)-gravity in metric formalism, in order to see the\ndifference among them. The limit of instability varies according to which\ntheory of gravity is adopted.\n", "  Reference metrics are used to define the differential structure on multicube\nrepresentations of manifolds, i.e., they provide a simple and practical way to\ndefine what it means globally for tensor fields and their derivatives to be\ncontinuous. This paper introduces a general procedure for constructing\nreference metrics automatically on multicube representations of manifolds with\narbitrary topologies. The method is tested here by constructing reference\nmetrics for compact, orientable two-dimensional manifolds with genera between\nzero and five. These metrics are shown to satisfy the Gauss-Bonnet identity\nnumerically to the level of truncation error (which converges toward zero as\nthe numerical resolution is increased). These reference metrics can be made\nsmoother and more uniform by evolving them with Ricci flow. This smoothing\nprocedure is tested on the two-dimensional reference metrics constructed here.\nThese smoothing evolutions (using volume-normalized Ricci flow with DeTurck\ngauge fixing) are all shown to produce reference metrics with constant scalar\ncurvatures (at the level of numerical truncation error).\n", "  We investigate the fragmentation instability of hairy black holes in the\ntheory with a Gauss$-$Bonnet(GB) term in asymptotically flat spacetime. Our\napproach is through the non-perturbative fragmentation instability. By this\napproach, we investigate whether the initial black hole can be broken into two\nblack holes by comparing the entropy of the initial black hole with the sum of\nthose of two fragmented black holes. The relation between the black hole\ninstability and the GB coupling with dilaton hair are presented. We describe\nthe phase diagrams with respect to the mass of the black hole solutions and\ncoupling constants. We find that a perturbatively stable black hole can be\nunstable under fragmentation.\n", "  The future of quantum communication relies on quantum networks composed by\nobservers sharing multipartite quantum states. The certification of\nmultipartite entanglement will be crucial to the usefulness of these networks.\nIn many real situations it is natural to assume that some observers are more\ntrusted than others in the sense that they have more knowledge of their\nmeasurement apparatuses. Here we propose a general method to certify all kinds\nof multipartite entanglement in this asymmetric scenario and experimentally\ndemonstrate it in an optical experiment. Our results, which can be seen as a\ndefinition of genuine multipartite quantum steering, give a method to detect\nentanglement in a scenario in between the standard entanglement and fully\ndevice-independent scenarios, and provide a basis for semi-device-independent\ncryptographic applications in quantum networks.\n", "  We present the results obtained from broadband spectroscopy of the high mass\nX-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using data from a Suzaku observation in 2006 September\n13-14 covering 0.29-0.72 orbital phase range. The light curves showed\nsignificant and rapid variation in source flux during entire observation. We\ndid not find any signature of pulsations in the light curves. However, a\nquasi-periodic oscillation at ~20 mHz was detected in the power density\nspectrum of the source. The 1-70 keV spectrum was fitted with various continuum\nmodels. However, we found that the partially absorbed high energy cutoff\npower-law and Negative and Positive power-law with Exponential cutoff (NPEX)\nmodels described the source spectrum well. Iron emission lines at 6.4 keV and\n7.1 keV were detected in the source spectrum. An absorption like feature at ~39\nkeV was detected in the residuals while fitting the data with NPEX model.\nConsidering the feature as cyclotron absorption line, the surface magnetic\nfield of the neutron star was estimated to be ~3.4 times 10^12 Gauss. To\nunderstand the cause of rapid variation in the source flux, time-resolved\nspectroscopy was carried out by dividing the observation into 20 narrow\nsegments. The results obtained from the time-resolved spectroscopy are\ninterpreted as the accretion of inhomogeneously distributed matter in the\nstellar wind of the supergiant companion star as the cause of observed flux\nvariation in 4U 1700-37. A sharp increase in column density after ~0.63 orbital\nphase indicates the presence of an accretion wake that blocks the continuum and\nproduces the eclipse like low-flux segment.\n", "  Ab initio calculations of the quasi-elastic electromagnetic and neutral-weak\nresponse functions of 4He and 12C are carried out for the first time. They are\nbased on a realistic approach to nuclear dynamics, in which the strong\ninteractions are described by two- and three-nucleon potentials and the\nelectroweak interactions with external fields include one- and two-body terms.\nThe Green's function Monte Carlo method is used to calculate directly the\nLaplace transforms of the response functions, and maximum-entropy techniques\nare employed to invert the resulting imaginary-time correlation functions with\nassociated statistical errors. The theoretical results, confirmed by experiment\nin the electromagnetic case, show that two-body currents generate excess\ntransverse strength from threshold to the quasi-elastic to the dip region and\nbeyond. These findings challenge the conventional picture of quasi-elastic\ninclusive scattering as being largely dominated by single-nucleon knockout\nprocesses.\n", "  In this paper, we derive from the principle of least action the equation of\nmotion for a continuous medium with regularized density field in the context of\nmeasures. The eventual equation of motion depends on the order in which\nregularization and the principle of least action are applied. We obtain two\ndifferent equations, whose discrete counterparts coincide with the scheme used\ntraditionally in the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical method\n(e.g. Monaghan), and with the equation treated by Di Lisio et al.,\nrespectively. Additionally, we prove the convergence in the Wasserstein\ndistance of the corresponding measure-valued evolutions, moreover providing the\norder of convergence of the SPH method. The convergence holds for a general\nclass of force fields, including external and internal conservative forces,\nfriction and non-local interactions. The proof of convergence is illustrated\nnumerically by means of one and two-dimensional examples.\n", "  This paper deals with the theoretical modeling of anisotropic compact stars\nin the framework of $f(T)$ theory of gravity, where $T$ is torsion scalar. To\nthis end, we have used the exact solutions of Krori and Barua metric to a\nstatic spherically symmetric metric. The unknown constants involved in the\nKrori and Barua metric have been specified by using the masses and radii of\ncompact stars 4$U$1820-30, Her X-1, SAX J 1808-3658. The physical properties of\nthese stars have been analyzed in the framework of $f(T)$ theory. In this\nsetting, we have checked the anisotropic behavior, regularity conditions,\nstability and surface redshift of the compact stars.\n", "  We study dephasing in electron transport through a large quantum dot (a\nFabry-Perot interferometer) in the fractional quantum Hall regime with filling\nfactor $2/3$. In the regime of sequential tunneling, dephasing occurs due to\nelectron fractionalization into counterpropagating charge and neutral edge\nmodes on the dot. In particular, when the charge mode moves much faster than\nthe neutral mode, and at temperatures higher than the level spacing of the dot,\nelectron fractionalization combined with tje fractional statistics of the\ncharge mode leads to the dephasing selectively suppressing $h/e$ Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations but not $h/(2e)$ oscillations, resulting in oscillation-period\nhalving.\n", "  AWPP is a complexity class introduced by Fenner, Fortnow, Kurtz, and Li,\nwhich is defined using GapP functions. Although it is an important class as the\nbest upperbound of BQP, its definition seems to be somehow artificial, and\ntherefore it would be better if we have some \"physical interpretation\" of AWPP.\nHere we provide a quantum physical interpretation of AWPP: we show that AWPP is\nequal to the class of problems efficiently solved by a quantum computer with\nthe ability of postselecting an event whose probability is close to an FP\nfunction. This result is applied to also obtain a quantum physical\ninterpretation of APP. In addition, we consider \"classical physical analogue\"\nof these results, and show that a restricted version of ${\\rm BPP}_{\\rm path}$\ncontains ${\\rm UP}\\cap{\\rm coUP}$ and is contained in WAPP.\n", "  The \"SOS\" in the title does not refer to the international distress signal,\nbut to \"solid-on-solid\" (SOS) surface growth. The catastrophic cascades are\nthose observed by Buldyrev {\\it et al.} in interdependent networks, which we\nre-interpret as multiplex networks with agents that can only survive if they\nmutually support each other, and whose survival struggle we map onto an SOS\ntype growth model. This mapping not only reveals non-trivial structures in the\nphase space of the model, but also leads to a new and extremely efficient\nsimulation algorithm. We use this algorithm to study interdependent agents on\nduplex Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER) networks and on lattices with dimensions 2, 3, 4,\nand 5. We obtain new and surprising results in all these cases, and we correct\nstatements in the literature for ER networks and for 2-d lattices. In\nparticular, we find that $d=4$ is the upper critical dimension, that the\npercolation transition is continuous for $d\\leq 4$ but -- at least for $d\\neq\n3$ -- not in the universality class of ordinary percolation. For ER networks we\nverify that the cluster statistics is exactly described by mean field theory,\nbut find evidence that the cascade process is not. For $d=5$ we find a first\norder transition as for ER networks, but we find also that small clusters have\na nontrivial mass distribution that scales at the transition point. Finally,\nfor $d=2$ with intermediate range dependency links we propose a scenario\ndifferent from that proposed in W. Li {\\it et al.}, PRL {\\bf 108}, 228702\n(2012).\n", "  During this work, an interacting chameleon like scalar field scenario, by\nconsidering SNeIa, CMB, BAO and OHD data sets is investigated. In fact, the\ninvestigation is realized by introducing an ansatz for the effective dark\nenergy equation of state, which mimics the behaviour of chameleon like models.\nBased on this assumption, some cosmological parameters including Hubble,\ndeceleration and coincidence parameters in such mechanism are analysed. It is\nrealized that, to estimate the free parameters of a theoretical model, by\nregarding the systematic errors it better the whole of the above observational\ndata sets to be considered. In fact, if one considers SNeIa, CMB and BAO but\ndisregards OHD it maybe leads to different results. Also to get a better\noverlap between the counters with the constraint $\\chi _{\\rm{m}}^2\\leq 1$, the\n$\\chi _{\\rm{T}}^2$ function could be re-weighted. The relative probability\nfunctions are plotted for marginalized likelihood $\\mathcal{L}\n(\\Omega_{\\rm{m0}} ,\\omega_1, \\beta)$ according to two dimensional confidence\nlevels $68.3\\%$, $90\\%$ and $95.4\\%$. Meanwhile, the value of free parameters\nwhich maximize the marginalized likelihoods using above confidence levels are\nobtained. In addition, based on these calculations the minimum value of\n$\\chi^2$ based on free parameters of an ansatz for the effective dark energy\nequation of state are achieved.\n", "  We investigate the dose and dose-rate dependence of the mutation frequency\ncaused by artificial radiations with Whack-A-Mole (WAM) model which we have\nrecently proposed. In particular, we pay special attention to the case of\nlong-term and low dose-rate exposure. The results indicate that the dose-rate\ndependence is successfully described with WAM model and it may replace the\nso-called DDREF, the concept of which has long been adopted to take account of\nthe difference between the high dose-rate data and the low dose-rate ones.\nBasic properties of WAM model are discussed emphasizing the dose-rate\ndependence to demonstrate how the explicit dose-rate dependence built in the\nmodel plays a key role. By adopting the parameters that are determined to fit\nthe mega mouse experiments, biological effects of long-term exposure to\nextremely low dose-rate radiation are discussed. In WAM model, the effects of\nthe long-term exposure show a saturation property, which makes a clear\ndistinction from the LNT hypothesis which predicts a linear increase of the\neffects with time.\n", "  In living cells, membrane morphology is regulated by various proteins. Many\nmembrane reshaping proteins contain a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, which\nconsists of a banana-shaped rod. The BAR domain bends the biomembrane along the\nrod axis and the features of this anisotropic bending have recently been\nstudied. Here, we report on the role of the BAR protein rods in inducing\nmembrane tubulation, using large-scale coarse-grained simulations. We reveal\nthat a small spontaneous side curvature perpendicular to the rod can\ndrastically alter the tubulation dynamics at high protein density, whereas no\nsignificant difference is obtained at low density. A percolated network is\nintermediately formed depending on the side curvature. This network suppresses\ntubule protrusion, leading to the slow formation of fewer tubules. Thus, the\nside curvature, which is generated by protein--protein and membrane--protein\ninteractions, plays a significant role in tubulation dynamics. We also find\nthat positive surface tensions and the vesicle membrane curvature can stabilize\nthis network structure by suppressing the tubulation.\n", "  At visible and infrared frequencies, metals show tantalizing promise for\nstrong subwavelength resonances, but material loss typically dampens the\nresponse. We derive fundamental limits to the optical response of absorptive\nsystems, bounding the largest enhancements possible given intrinsic material\nlosses. Through basic conservation-of-energy principles, we derive\ngeometry-independent limits to per-volume absorption and scattering rates, and\nto local-density-of-states enhancements that represent the power radiated or\nexpended by a dipole near a material body. We provide examples of structures\nthat approach our absorption and scattering limits at any frequency, by\ncontrast, we find that common \"antenna\" structures fall far short of our\nradiative LDOS bounds, suggesting the possibility for significant further\nimprovement. Underlying the limits is a simple metric, $|\\chi|^2 /\n\\operatorname{Im} \\chi$ for a material with susceptibility $\\chi$, that enables\nbroad technological evaluation of lossy materials across optical frequencies.\n", "  We experimentally investigate spin-orbit torques and spin pumping in NiFe/Pt\nbilayers with direct and interrupted interfaces. The damping-like and\nfield-like torques are simultaneously measured with spin-torque ferromagnetic\nresonance tuned by a dc bias current, whereas spin pumping is measured\nelectrically through the inverse spin Hall effect using a microwave cavity.\nInsertion of an atomically thin Cu dusting layer at the interface reduces the\ndamping-like torque, field-like torque, and spin pumping by nearly the same\nfactor of ~1.4. This finding confirms that the observed spin-orbit torques\npredominantly arise from diffusive transport of spin current generated by the\nspin Hall effect. We also find that spin-current scattering at the NiFe/Pt\ninterface contributes to additional enhancement in magnetization damping that\nis distinct from spin pumping.\n", "  We propose a realistic model with Majorana neutrinos in the framework of\nunifying the three generations of fermions by point interactions in an extra\ndimension. This model can simultaneously explain the origin of fermion\ngenerations, fermion masses and mixing, and the smallness of the masses of\nMajorana neutrinos. We show that there are two mechanisms working together to\nsuppress the neutrino masses significantly, so we do not have to introduce a\nvery large extra-dimension cut-off scale. One is the type-I seesaw mechanism\nand the other is the overlap integration of localized lepton wave functions. A\nsinglet scalar with an exponential-like VEV plays a central role in these two\nmechanisms. For consistency in this model we introduce a $U(1)'$ gauge\nsymmetry, which will be broken by the singlet scalar. Parameters of our model\ncan fit the masses and flavor mixing data well. These parameters can also\npredict all CP violating phases including the Majorana ones and accidentally\nrescue the proton from decay.\n", "  Magnetoelectric (ME) materials are of fundamental interest and show broad\npotential for technological applications. Commonly the dominant contribution to\nthe ME response is the lattice-mediated one, which is proportional to both the\nBorn electric charge $Z^{\\rm e}$ and its analogue, the dynamical magnetic\ncharge $Z^{\\rm m}$. Our previous study has shown that exchange striction acting\non noncollinear spins induces much larger magnetic charges than those that\ndepend on spin-orbit coupling. The hexagonal manganites $R$MnO$_3$ and ferrites\n$R$FeO$_3$ ($R$ = Sc, Y, In, Ho-Lu) exhibit strong couplings between electric,\nmagnetic and structural degrees of freedom, with the transition-metal ions in\nthe basal plane antiferromagnetically coupled through super-exchange so as to\nform a 120$^\\circ$ noncollinear spin arrangement. Here we present a theoretical\nstudy of the magnetic charges, and of the spin-lattice and spin-electronic ME\nconstants, in these hexagonal manganites and ferrites, clarifying the\nconditions under which exchange striction leads to an enhanced $Z^{\\rm m}$\nvalues and anomalously large in-plane spin-lattice ME effects.\n", "  We investigate the transient dynamics of a lumped-element oscillator based on\na dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The SQUID is shunted\nwith a capacitor forming a nonlinear oscillator with resonance frequency in the\nrange of several GHz. The resonance frequency is varied by tuning the Josephson\ninductance of the SQUID with on-chip flux lines. We report measurements of\ndecaying oscillations in the time domain following a brief excitation with a\nmicrowave pulse. The nonlinearity of the SQUID oscillator is probed by\nobserving the ringdown response for different excitation amplitudes while the\nSQUID potential is varied by adjusting the flux bias. Simulations are performed\non a model circuit by numerically solving the corresponding Langevin equations\nincorporating the SQUID potential at the experimental temperature and using\nparameters obtained from separate measurements characterizing the SQUID\noscillator. Simulations are in good agreement with the experimental\nobservations of the ringdowns as a function of applied magnetic flux and pulse\namplitude. We observe a crossover between the occurrence of ringdowns close to\nresonance and adiabatic following at larger detuning from the resonance. We\nalso discuss the occurrence of phase jumps at large amplitude drive. Finally,\nwe briefly outline prospects for a readout scheme for superconducting flux\nqubits based on the discrimination between ringdown signals for different\nlevels of magnetic flux coupled to the SQUID.\n", "  A special feature of the ground state in a topologically ordered phase is the\nexistence of large scale correlations depending only on the topology of the\nregions. These correlations can be detected by the topological entanglement\nentropy or by a measure called irreducible correlation. We show that these two\nmeasures coincide for states obeying an area law and having zero-correlation\nlength. Moreover, we provide an operational meaning for these measures by\nproving its equivalence to the optimal rate of a particular class of secret\nsharing protocols. This establishes an information-theoretical approach to\nmultipartite correlations in topologically ordered systems.\n", "  We study the prospects for long-lived charged particle (LLCP) searches at\ncurrent and future LHC runs and at a 100 TeV pp collider, using Drell-Yan\nslepton pair production as an example. Because momentum measurements become\nmore challenging for very energetic particles, we carefully treat the expected\nmomentum resolution. At the same time, a novel feature of 100 TeV collisions is\nthe significant energy loss of energetic muons in detectors. We use this to\nhelp discriminate between muons and LLCPs. We find that the 14 TeV LHC with an\nintegrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$ can probe LLCP slepton masses up to 1.2\nTeV, and a 100 TeV pp collider with 3 ab$^{-1}$ can probe LLCP slepton masses\nup to 4 TeV, using time-of-flight measurements. These searches will have\nstriking implications for dark matter, with the LHC definitively testing the\npossibility of slepton-neutralino co-annihilating WIMP dark matter, and with\nthe LHC and future hadron colliders having a strong potential for discovering\nLLCPs in models with superWIMP dark matter.\n", "  We develop a quantum information protocol that models the biological\nbehaviors of individuals living in a natural selection scenario. The\nartificially engineered evolution of the quantum living units shows the\nfundamental features of life in a common environment, such as self-replication,\nmutation, interaction of individuals, and death. We propose how to mimic these\nbio-inspired features in a quantum-mechanical formalism, which allows for an\nexperimental implementation achievable with current quantum platforms. This\nresult paves the way for the realization of artificial life and embodied\nevolution with quantum technologies.\n", "  We discuss how long strings can arise at the stretched horizon and how they\ncan account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We use the thermal scalar field\ntheory to derive the asymptotic density of states and corresponding stress\ntensor of a microcanonical long string gas in Rindler space. We show that the\nequality of the Hagedorn and Hawking temperatures gives rise to the tree-level\nentropy of large black holes in accordance with the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald\nformula.\n", "  We show that the observed fluxes, spectra and sky distributions of the high\nenergy diffuse backgrounds of astronomical neutrinos, gamma rays and cosmic ray\npositrons satisfy simple relations expected from their common production in\nhadronic collisions of high energy cosmic rays (CRs) with diffuse matter. This\nprovides compelling evidence that the high energy neutrino, gamma ray, and\npositron backgrounds have a common origin - hadronic meson production by cosmic\nrays in our Galaxy and in external galaxies rather than through the\ndecay/annihilation of dark matter particles.\n", "  We constrain the Higgs boson (Yukawa) coupling to quarks in the first two\ngenerations in the $H\\to ZZ$ final states. Deviation of these couplings from\nthe Standard Model values leads to change in the Higgs boson width and in the\ncross sections of relevant processes. In the Higgs boson resonance region, an\nincreased light Yukawa coupling leads to an increased Higgs boson width, which\nin turn leads to a decreased cross section. In the off-shell region, increased\nYukawa couplings result in an enhancement of the Higgs boson signal through\n$q\\bar{q}$ annihilation. With the assumption of scaling one Yukawa coupling at\na time, this study is conceptually simple and yields results with the same\norder of magnitude as the tightest in the literature. The study is based on\nresults published by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2014, corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities of $5.1\\ifb$ at a centre-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}=7\\tev$ and $19.7\\ifb$ at $8\\tev$.\n", "  We study the probe of the gauge-phobic (or nearly gauge-phobic) heavy Higgs\nbosons (GPHB) at high energy hadron colliders including the 14 TeV LHC and the\n50 TeV Super Proton-Proton Collider (SppC). We take the process $pp\\to t\\bar t\nt\\bar t$, and study it at the hadron level including simulating the jet\nformation and top quark tagging (with jet substructure). We show that, for a\nGPHB with $M^{}_H<800$ GeV, $M^{}_H$ can be determined by adjusting the value\nof $M^{}_H$ in the theoretical $p^{}_T(b_1)$ distribution to fit the observed\n$p^{}_T(b_1)$ distribution, and the resonance peak can be seen at the SppC for\n$M^{}_H$=800 GeV and 1 TeV.\n", "  We investigate a Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) scalar field, $\\Phi$, with\npower-law potential in the presence of a second scalar field, $\\phi$, with an\nexponential potential, in both the Jordan and the Einstein frames. We present\nthe relation of our model with the induced gravity model with power-law\npotential and the integrability of this kind of models is discussed when the\nquintessence field $\\phi$ is massless, and has a small velocity. We prove that\nin JBD theory, the de Sitter solution is not a natural attractor but an\nintermediate accelerated solution of the form $a(t)\\simeq e^{\\alpha_1\nt^{p_1}}$, as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ where $\\alpha_1>0$ and $0<p_1<1$, for a\nwide range of parameters. Furthermore, in the Einstein frame we get that the\nattractor is also an intermediate accelerated solution of the form\n$\\mathfrak{a}(\\mathfrak{t})\\simeq e^{\\alpha_2 \\mathfrak{t}^{p_2}}$ as\n$\\mathfrak{t}\\rightarrow \\infty$ where $\\alpha_2>0$ and $0<p_2<1$, for the same\nconditions on the parameters as in the Jordan frame. In the special case of a\nquadratic potential in the Jordan frame, or for a constant potential in the\nEinstein's frame, these solutions are of saddle type. Finally, we present a\nspecific elaboration of our extension of the induced gravity model in the\nJordan frame, which corresponds to a linear potential of $\\Phi$. The dynamical\nsystem is then reduced to a two dimensional one, and the late-time attractor is\nlinked with the exact solution found for the induced gravity model. In this\nexample the intermediate accelerated solution does not exist, and the attractor\nsolution has an asymptotic de Sitter-like evolution law for the scale factor.\nApart from some fine-tuned examples such as the linear, and quadratic potential\n${U}(\\Phi)$ in the Jordan frame, it is true that intermediate accelerated\nsolutions are generic late-time attractors in a modified JBD theory.\n", "  Hawking radiation (HR) of massive vector particles from a rotating Warped\nAnti-de Sitter black hole in 2+1 dimensions (WAdS$_{\\text{3}}$BH) is studied in\ndetail. The quantum tunneling approach with the Hamilton-Jacobi method (HJM) is\napplied in the Proca equation (PE), and we show that the radial function yields\nthe tunneling rate of the outgoing particles. Comparing the result obtained\nwith the Boltzmann factor, we satisfactorily reproduce the Hawking temperature\n(HT) of the WAdS$_{\\text{3}}$BH.\n", "  X-ray photoelectron spectra provide a wealth of information on the electronic\nstructure. The extraction of molecular details requires adequate theoretical\nmethods, which in case of transition metal complexes has to account for effects\ndue to the multi-configurational and spin-mixed nature of the many-electron\nwave function. Here, the Restricted Active Space Self-Consistent Field method\nincluding spin-orbit coupling is used to cope with this challenge and to\ncalculate valence and core photoelectron spectra. The intensities are estimated\nwithin the frameworks of the Dyson orbital formalism and the sudden\napproximation. Thereby, we utilize an efficient computational algorithm that is\nbased on a biorthonormal basis transformation. The approach is applied to the\nvalence photoionization of the gas phase water molecule and to the core\nionization spectrum of the $\\text{[Fe(H}_2\\text{O)}_6\\text{]}^{2+}$ complex.\nThe results show good agreement with the experimental data obtained in this\nwork, whereas the sudden approximation demonstrates distinct deviations from\nexperiments.\n", "  The mean-field dynamics of a Bose gas is shown to break down at time $\\tau_h\n= (c_1/\\gamma) \\ln N$ where $\\gamma$ is the Lyapunov exponent of the mean-field\ntheory, $N$ is the number of bosons, and $c_1$ is a system-dependent constant.\nThe breakdown time $\\tau_h$ is essentially the Ehrenfest time that\ncharacterizes the breakdown of the correspondence between classical and quantum\ndynamics. This breakdown can be well described by the quantum fidelity defined\nfor reduced density matrices. Our results are obtained with the formalism in\nparticle-number phase space and are illustrated with a triple-well model. The\nlogarithmic quantum-classical correspondence time may be verified\nexperimentally with Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  We consider the motion of a particle in a uniform field in noncommutative\nspace which is rotationally invariant. On the basis of exact calculations it is\nshown that there is an effect of coordinate noncommutativity on the mass of a\nparticle. A particular case of motion of a particle in a uniform gravitational\nfield is considered and the equivalence principle is studied. We propose the\nway to solve the problem of violation of the equivalence principle in the\nrotationally invariant noncommutative space.\n", "  We have systematically grown large single crystals of layered compound\nbeta-PdBi2, both the hole-doped PdBi2-xPbx and the electron-doped NaxPdBi2, and\nstudied their magnetic and transport properties. Hall-effect measurement on\nPdBi2, PdBi1.8Pb0.2, and Na0.057PdBi2 shows that the charge transport is\ndominated by electrons in all of the samples. The electron concentration is\nsubstantially reduced upon Pb-doping in PdBi2-xPbx and increased upon\nNa-intercalation in NaxPdBi2, indicating the effective hole-doping by Pb and\nelectron-doping by Na. We observed a monotonic decrease of superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) from 5.4K in undoped PdBi2 to less than 2K for x >\n0.35 in hole-doped PdBi2-xPbx. Meanwhile, a rapid decrease of Tc with the Na\nintercalation is also observed in the electron-doped NaxPdBi2, which is in\ndisagreement with the theoretical expectation. In addition, both the\nmagnetoresistance and Hall resistance further reveal evidence for a possible\nspin density wave (SDW)-like transition below 50K in the Na-intercalated PdBi2\nsample. The complete phase diagram is thus established from hole-doping to\nelectron-doping. Meanwhile, high pressure study of the undoped PdBi2 shows that\nthe Tc is linearly suppressed under pressure with a dTc/dP coefficient of\n-0.28K/GPa.\n", "  A new analysis is given of numerical simulation data on the archetype square\nlattice Ising Spin Glasses (ISG) with a bimodal ($\\pm J$) and Gaussian\ninteraction distributions. It is well established that the ordering temperature\nof both models is zero. The Gaussian has a non-degenerate ground state so\nexponent $\\eta \\equiv 0$ and it has a continuous distribution of energy levels.\nFor the bimodal model, above a size dependent cross-over temperature $T^{*}(L)$\nthere is a regime of effectively continuous energy levels; below $T^{*}(L)$\nthere is a distinct regime dominated by the highly degenerate ground state plus\nan energy gap to the excited states. $T^{*}(L)$ tends to zero at very large $L$\nleaving only the effectively continuous regime in the thermodynamic limit. We\nshow that in this regime the critical exponent $\\eta$ is not zero, so the\neffectively continuous regime $2$D bimodal ISG is not in the same universality\nclass as the $2$D Gaussian ISG. The simulation data on both models are analyzed\nusing a scaling variable $\\tau = T^2/(1+T^2)$ suitable for zero temperature\ntransition ISGs, together with appropriate scaling expressions. Accurate\nsimulation estimates can be obtained for the temperature dependence of the\nthermodynamic limit reduced susceptibility $\\chi(\\tau)$ and second moment\ncorrelation length $\\xi(\\tau)$ over the entire range of temperature from zero\nto infinity. The Gaussian critical exponent from the simulations $\\nu = 3.5(1)$\nis in full agreement with the well established value from the literature. The\nbimodal exponent from the thermodynamic limit regime analysis is $\\nu =\n4.2(1)$, once again different from the Gaussian value.\n", "  We investigate whether Higgs inflation can occur in the Standard Model\nstarting from natural initial conditions or not. The Higgs has a non-minimal\ncoupling to the Ricci scalar. We confine our attention to the regime where\nquantum Einstein gravity effects are small in order to have results that are\nindependent of the ultraviolet completion of gravity. At the classical level we\nfind no tuning is required to have a successful Higgs inflation, provided the\ninitial homogeneity condition is satisfied. On the other hand, at the quantum\nlevel we obtain that the renormalization for large non-minimal coupling\nrequires an additional degree of freedom that transforms Higgs inflation into\nStarobinsky $R^2$ inflation, unless a tuning of the initial values of the\nrunning parameters is made.\n", "  Integrated sources of indistinguishable photons have attracted a lot of\nattention because of their applications in quantum communication and optical\nquantum computing. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-compact quantum splitter for\ndegenerate single photons based on a monolithic chip incorporating Sagnac loop\nand a micro-ring resonator with a footprint of 0.011 mm2, generating and\ndeterministically splitting indistinguishable photon pairs using time-reversed\nHong-Ou-Mandel interference. The ring resonator provides enhanced photon\ngeneration rate, and the Sagnac loop ensures the photons travel through equal\npath lengths and interfere with the correct phase to enable the reversed HOM\neffect to take place. In the experiment, we observed a HOM dip visibility of\n94.5 +- 3.3 %, indicating the photons generated by the degenerate single photon\nsource are in a suitable state for further integration with other components\nfor quantum applications, such as controlled-NOT gates.\n", "  This thesis concerns the study of high-temperature string theory on curved\nbackgrounds, generalizing the notions of Hagedorn temperature and thermal\nscalar to general backgrounds. Chapter 2 contains a review on string\nthermodynamics in flat space, setting the stage. Chapters 3 and 4 contain the\ndetailed study of the random walk picture in a general curved background.\nChapters 5 and 6 then apply this to Rindler space, the near-horizon\napproximation of a generic (uncharged) black hole. Chapters 7 and 8 contain a\nstudy of the AdS3 and BTZ WZW models where we study the thermal spectrum and\nthe resulting random walk picture that emerges. Chapters 9 and 10 attempt to\ndraw general conclusions from the study of the two specific examples earlier:\nwe draw lessons on string thermodynamics in general and on (perturbative)\nstring thermodynamics around black hole horizons. For the latter, we point out\na possible link to the firewall paradox. Finally, chapter 11 contains a\ndetailed discussion on the near-Hagedorn (and high-energy) stress tensor in a\ngeneric spacetime, the results of which are applied to provide a description of\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in terms of long string equilibration.\n", "  The loop quantization of the Schwarzschild interior region, as described by a\nhomogeneous anisotropic Kantowski-Sachs model, is re-examined. As several\nstudies of different -inequivalent- loop quantizations have shown, to date\nthere exists no fully satisfactory quantum theory for this model. This fact\nposes challenges to the validity of some scenarios to address the black hole\ninformation problem. Here we put forward a novel viewpoint to construct the\nquantum theory that builds from some of the models available in the literature.\nThe final picture is a quantum theory that is both independent of any auxiliary\nstructure and possesses a correct low curvature limit. It represents a subtle\nbut non-trivial modification of the original prescription given by Ashtekar and\nBojowald. It is shown that the quantum gravitational constraint is well defined\npast the singularity and that its effective dynamics possesses a bounce into an\nexpanding regime. The classical singularity is avoided, and a semiclassical\nspacetime satisfying vacuum Einstein's equations is recovered on the \"other\nside\" of the bounce. We argue that such metric represents the interior region\nof a white-hole spacetime, but for which the corresponding \"white-hole mass\"\ndiffers from the original black hole mass. Furthermore, we find that the value\nof the white-hole mass is proportional to the third power of the starting black\nhole mass.\n", "  The retrieval of phases from intensity measurements is a key process in many\nfields in science, from optical microscopy to x-ray crystallography. Here we\nstudy phase retrieval of a one-dimensional multi-phase object that is\nilluminated by quantum states of light. We generalize the iterative\nGerchberg-Saxton algorithm to photon correlation measurements on the output\nplane, rather than the standard intensity measurements. We report a numerical\ncomparison of classical and quantum phase retrieval of a small one-dimensional\nobject of discrete phases from its far-field diffraction. While the classical\nalgorithm was ambiguous and often converged to wrong solutions, quantum light\nproduced a unique reconstruction with smaller errors and faster convergence. We\nattribute these improvements to a larger Hilbert space that constrains the\nalgorithm.\n", "  A magneto-orbital coupling mechanism is proposed to account for the weak\nenergy gap at the Fermi energy in the $(\\pi,0)$ ordered SDW state of a\nrealistic three band model for iron pnictides involving $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, and\n$d_{xy}$ Fe orbitals. The orbital mixing terms between the $d_{xy}$ and\n$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbitals, which are important in reproducing the orbital\ncomposition of the elliptical electron pockets at $(\\pm \\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pm\n\\pi)$, are shown to play a key role in the energy gap formation in the SDW\nstate.\n", "  Many-body approaches to open quantum systems have recently become powerful\ntools for investigating the detailed role of dissipative environments in\ndiverse non-equilibrium molecular and condensed matter processes. Here, we\nreport the development of an efficient algorithm that utilises a time-dependent\nvariational principle for matrix product states to evolve large\nsystem-environment states. By thus capturing all system-environment\ncorrelations, we reproduce the highly non-perturbative, quantum-critical\ndynamics of the zero temperature spin-boson model, and then exploit the\nmany-body information to output a complete time-frequency spectrum of the\nenvironmental excitations. We highlight how theoretical 'environmental spectra'\ncould yield valuable insights into a wide range of complex dissipative\nprocesses, by showing that correlated motion of modes entangled with the spin\ncan appear with persistent vibrational coherence, in spite of incoherent spin\nrelaxation.\n", "  We study the temperature-dependent quantum correction to conductivity due to\nthe interplay of spin density fluctuations and weak disorder for a\ntwo-dimensional metal near an antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point.\nAFM spin density fluctuations carry large momenta around the ordering vector\n$\\mathbf{Q}$ and, at lowest order of the spin-fermion coupling, only scatter\nelectrons between \"hot spots\" of the Fermi surface which are connected by\n$\\mathbf{Q}$. Earlier, it was seen that the quantum interference between AFM\nspin density fluctuations and soft diffusive modes of the disordered metal is\nsuppressed, a consequence of the large-momentum scattering. The suppression of\nthis interference results in a non-singular temperature dependence of the\ncorresponding interaction correction to conductivity. However, at higher order\nof the spin-fermion coupling, electrons on the entire Fermi surface can be\nscattered successively by two spin density fluctuations and, in total, suffer a\nsmall momentum transfer. This higher-order process can be described by\ncomposite modes which carry small momenta. We show that the interference\nbetween formally subleading composite modes and diffusive modes generates\nsingular interaction corrections which ultimately dominate over the\nnon-singular first-order correction at low temperatures. We derive an effective\nlow-energy theory from the spin-fermion model which includes the\nabove-mentioned higher-order process implicitly and show that for weak\nspin-fermion coupling the small-momentum transfer is mediated by a composite\npropagator. Employing the conventional diagrammatic approach to impurity\nscattering, we find the correction $\\delta \\sigma \\sim +\\ln^2 T$ for\ntemperatures above an exponentially small crossover scale.\n", "  A theoretical study of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in ultrathin lossy\nmetal films is presented. The dispersion relation of such films is well known\nand can be solved numerically to obtain a combination of long-range (LR-) and\nshort-range (SR-) eigenmodes. In this contribution, a simple solution for the\nSR-SPPs is derived. An approximation for the LR- eigenmodes can be found\nelsewhere. To validate the approximation, a two dimensional (2D) periodic array\nof small holes is studied subsequently. The spectral response of the array is\nobtained by full-wave simulations and the results compared with those\ncalculated analytically, showing an excellent agreement for small holes.\n", "  We use world-line methods for pseudo-supersymmetry to construct\n$sl(2|1)$-invariant actions for the $(2,2,0)$ chiral and ($1,2,1)$ real\nsupermultiplets of the twisted $D$-module representations of the $sl(2|1)$\nsuperalgebra. The derived one-dimensional topological conformal $\\sigma$-models\nare invariant under nilpotent operators. The actions are constructed for both\nparabolic and hyperbolic/trigonometric realizations (with extra potential terms\nin the latter case). The scaling dimension $\\lambda$ of the supermultiplets\ndefines a coupling constant, $2\\lambda+1$, the free theories being recovered at\n$\\lambda=-\\frac{1}{2}$. We also present, generalizing previous works, the\n$D$-module representations of one-dimensional superconformal algebras induced\nby ${\\cal N}=(p,q)$ pseudo-supersymmetry acting on $(k,n,n-k)$ supermultiplets.\nBesides $sl(2|1)$, we obtain the superalgebras $A(1,1)$, $D(2,1;\\alpha)$,\n$D(3,1)$, $D(4,1)$, $A(2,1)$ from $(p,q)= (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,1)$,\nat given $k,n$ and critical values of $\\lambda$.\n", "  Systems with long-range interactions display a short-time relaxation towards\nQuasi Stationary States (QSS) whose lifetime increases with the system size. In\nthe paradigmatic Hamiltonian Mean-field Model (HMF) out-of-equilibrium phase\ntransitions are predicted and numerically detected which separate homogeneous\n(zero magnetization) and inhomogeneous (nonzero magnetization) QSS. In the\nformer regime, the velocity distribution presents (at least) two large,\nsymmetric, bumps, which cannot be self-consistently explained by resorting to\nthe conventional Lynden-Bell maximum entropy approach. We propose a generalized\nmaximum entropy scheme which accounts for the pseudo-conservation of additional\ncharges, the even momenta of the single particle distribution. These latter are\nset to the asymptotic values, as estimated by direct integration of the\nunderlying Vlasov equation, which formally holds in the thermodynamic limit.\nMethodologically, we operate in the framework of a generalized Gibbs ensemble,\nas sometimes defined in statistical quantum mechanics, which contains an\ninfinite number of conserved charges. The agreement between theory and\nsimulations is satisfying, both above and below the out of equilibrium\ntransition threshold. A precedently unaccessible feature of the QSS, the\nmultiple bumps in the velocity profile, is resolved by our new approach.\n", "  The Rashba interaction induced when inversion symmetry is broken in solids is\na key interaction connecting spin and charge for realizing novel\nmagnetoelectric cross-correlation effects. Here, we theoretically explore the\noptical properties of a bulk Rashba conductor by calculating the transport\ncoefficients at finite frequencies. It is demonstrated that the combination of\ndirect and inverse Edelstein effects leads to a softening of the plasma\nfrequency for the electric field perpendicular to the Rashba field, resulting\nin a hyperbolic electromagnetic metamaterial. In the presence of magnetization,\na significant enhancement of anisotropic propagation (directional dichroism) is\npredicted because of interband transition edge singularity.Based on an\neffective Hamiltonian analysis, the dichroism is demonstrated to be driven by\ntoroidal and quadratic moments of the magnetic Rashba system. The effective\ntheory of the cross-correlation effects has the same mathematical structure as\nthat of insulating multiferroics.\n", "  We propose a method of detecting a phase transition in a generalized P\\'olya\nurn in an information cascade experiment. The method is based on the asymptotic\nbehavior of the correlation $C(t)$ between the first subject's choice and the\n$t+1$-th subject's choice, the limit value of which, $c\\equiv \\lim_{t\\to\n\\infty}C(t)$, is the order parameter of the phase transition. To verify the\nmethod, we perform a voting experiment using two-choice questions. An urn X is\nchosen at random from two urns A and B, which contain red and blue balls in\ndifferent configurations. Subjects sequentially guess whether X is A or B using\ninformation about the prior subjects' choices and the color of a ball randomly\ndrawn from X. The color tells the subject which is X with probability $q$. We\nset $q\\in \\{5/9,6/9,7/9,8/9\\}$ by controlling the configurations of red and\nblue balls in A and B. The (average) lengths of the sequence of the subjects\nare 63, 63, 54.0, and 60.5 for $q\\in \\{5/9,6/9,7/9,8/9\\}$, respectively. We\ndescribe the sequential voting process by a nonlinear P\\'olya urn model. The\nmodel suggests the possibility of a phase transition when $q$ changes. We show\nthat $c>0\\,\\,\\,(=0)$ for $q=5/9,6/9\\,\\,\\,(7/9,8/9 )$ and detect the phase\ntransition using the proposed method.\n", "  It was recently pointed out that if an absorbing boundary condition is\nimposed at infinity, an asymptotically anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild black hole\nwith a spherical horizon takes only a finite amount of time to evaporate away\neven if its initial mass is arbitrarily large. We show that this is a rather\ngeneric property in AdS spacetimes: regardless of their horizon topologies,\nneutral AdS black holes in general relativity take about the same amount of\ntime to evaporate down to the same size of order L, the AdS length scale. Our\ndiscussion focuses on the case in which the black hole has toral event horizon.\nA brief comment is made on the hyperbolic case, i.e. for black holes with\nnegatively curved horizons.\n", "  Using quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ calculations, we re-examined the\nelectronic structure of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and SrRuO$_3$. Our calculations show that\nthe correlation effects beyond the conventional LDA (local density\napproximation) and GGA (generalized gradient approximation) are reasonably well\ncaptured by QS$GW$ self-energy without any {\\it ad hoc} parameter or any\nambiguity related to the double-counting and the downfolding issues. While the\nspectral weight transfer to the lower and upper Hubbard band is not observed,\nthe noticeable bandwidth reduction and effective mass enhancement are obtained.\nImportant features in the electronic structures that have been debated over the\nlast decades such as the photoemission spectra at around $-3$ eV in\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$ and the half-metallicity for SrRuO$_3$ are discussed in the light\nof our QS$GW$ results and in comparison with the previous studies. The\npromising aspects of QS$GW$ are highlighted as the first-principles calculation\nmethod to describe the moderately correlated 4$d$ transition metal oxides along\nwith its limitations.\n", "  Quantum spatial search has been widely studied with most of the study\nfocusing on quantum walk algorithms. We show that quantum walk algorithms are\nextremely sensitive to systematic errors. We present a recursive algorithm\nwhich offers significant robustness to certain systematic errors. To search N\nitems, our recursive algorithm can tolerate errors of size O(1/\\sqrt{\\ln N})\nwhich is exponentially better than quantum walk algorithms for which tolerable\nerror size is only O(\\ln N/\\sqrt{N}). Also, our algorithm does not need any\nancilla qubit. Thus our algorithm is much easier to implement experimentally\ncompared to quantum walk algorithms.\n", "  In this article, we construct the diquark-diquark-antiquark type\ninterpolating currents, and study the masses and pole residues of the\n$J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and ${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$ hidden-charmed pentaquark states in\ndetails with the QCD sum rules by calculating the contributions of the vacuum\ncondensates up to dimension-10 in the operator product expansion. In\ncalculations, we use the formula $\\mu=\\sqrt{M^2_{P_c}-(2{\\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to\ndetermine the energy scales of the QCD spectral densities. The present\npredictions favor assigning the $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ to be the\n${\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and ${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$ pentaquark states, respectively.\n", "  The Born-Infeld equation in the plane is usefully captured in complex\nlanguage. The general exact solution can be written as a combination of\nholomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions. However, this solution only\nexpresses the potential in an implicit way. We rework the formulation to obtain\nthe complex potential in an explicit way, by means of a perturbative procedure.\nWe take care of the secular behavior common to this kind of approach, by\nresorting to a symmetry the equation has at the considered order of\napproximation. We apply the method to build approximated solutions to\nBorn-Infeld electrodynamics. We solve for BI electromagnetic waves traveling in\nopposite directions. We study the propagation at interfaces, with the aim of\nsearching for effects susceptible to experimental detection. In particular, we\nshow that a reflected wave is produced when a wave is incident on a semi-space\ncontaining a magnetostatic field.\n", "  In the absence of disorder, electrons can display glassy behavior through\nsupercooling the liquid state, avoiding the solidification into a charge\nordered state. Such supercooled electron liquids are experimentally found in\norganic $\\theta$-$MM'$ compounds. We present theoretical results that\nqualitatively capture the experimental findings. At intermediate temperatures,\nthe conducting state crosses over into a weakly insulating pseudogap phase. The\nstripe order phase transition is first order, so that the liquid phase is\nmetastable below $T_s$. In the supercooled liquid phase the resistivity\nincreases further and the density of states at the Fermi level is suppressed,\nindicating kinetic arrest and the formation of a glassy state. Our results are\nobtained using classical Extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory.\n", "  We further pursue an approach to the sign problem of quantum chromodynamics\nat nonzero chemical potential, in which configurations of the lattice path\nintegral are gathered into subsets. In the subset construction we multiply each\ntemporal link by center elements independently and in a first step neglect the\ngauge action. The positivity of the subset weights -- shown for 0+1 dimensions\nin an earlier study -- extends to larger lattices: for two sites in the\ntemporal direction and arbitrary spatial extent we give a proof of the\npositivity by decomposing the subset weight in positive summands. From\nnumerical evidence we conjecture that the positivity persists on larger\nlattices and that the gauge action can be reintroduced through mild\nreweighting. First results on the quark number obtained with this method in two\ndimensions are shown as well.\n", "  Encoding readout methods based on different schemes have been successfully\ndeveloped and tested with different types of position-sensitive detectors with\nstrip-readout structures. However, how to construct an encoding scheme in a\nmore general and systematic way is still under study. In this paper, we present\na graph model for the encoding scheme. With this model, encoding schemes can be\nstudied in a more systematic way. It is shown that by using an encoding readout\nmethod, a maximum of n(n-1)/2+1 strips can be processed with n channels if n is\nodd, while a maximum of (n(n-2))/2+2 strips can be processed with n channels if\nn is even. Furthermore, based on the model, the encoding scheme construction\nproblem can be translated into a problem in graph theory, the aim of which is\nto construct an Eulerian trail such that the length of the shortest subcycle is\nas long as possible. A more general approach to constructing the encoding\nscheme is found by solving the associated mathematical problem. In addition, an\nencoding scheme prototype has been constructed, and verified with MRPC\ndetectors.\n", "  We consider non-equilibrium time evolution after a quench of a global\nHamiltonian parameter in systems described by Hamiltonians with local\ninteractions. Within this background, we propose a protocol that allows to\nchange global properties of the state by flipping a switch that modifies a\nlocal term of the Hamiltonian (creating a defect). A light-cone that separates\ntwo globally different regions originates from the switch. The expectation\nvalues of macroscopic observables, that is to say local observables that are\nspatially averaged within a subsystem, slowly approach new asymptotic values\ndetermined by the defect. The process is almost reversible: flipping again the\nswitch produces a new light-cone with the two regions inverted. Finally, we\ntest the protocol under repeated projective measurements. As explicit example\nwe study the dynamics in a simple exactly solvable model but analogues\ndescriptions apply also to generic models.\n", "  We consider the tight-binding model with cubic symmetry that may be relevant\nfor the description of a certain class of Weyl semimetals. We take into account\nelastic deformations of the semimetal through the modification of hopping\nparameters. This modification results in the appearance of emergent gauge field\nand the coordinate dependent anisotropic Fermi velocity. The latter may be\ninterpreted as emergent gravitational field.\n", "  In quantum game theory, one of the most intriguing and important questions\nis, \"Is it possible to get quantum advantages without any modification of the\nclassical game?\" The answer to this question so far has largely been negative.\nSo far, it has usually been thought that a change of the classical game setting\nappears to be unavoidable for getting the quantum advantages. However, we give\nan affirmative answer here, focusing on the decision-making process (we call\n'reasoning') to generate the best strategy, which may occur internally, e.g.,\nin the player's brain. To show this, we consider a classical guessing game. We\nthen define a one-player reasoning problem in the context of the\ndecision-making theory, where the machinery processes are designed to simulate\nclassical and quantum reasoning. In such settings, we present a scenario where\na rational player is able to make better use of his/her weak preferences due to\nquantum reasoning, without any altering or resetting of the classically defined\ngame. We also argue in further analysis that the quantum reasoning may make the\nplayer fail, and even make the situation worse, due to any inappropriate\npreferences.\n", "  In quantum adiabatic algorithm, as the adiabatic parameter $s(t)$ changes\nslowly from zero to one with finite rate, a transition to excited states\ninevitably occurs and this induces an intrinsic computational error. We show\nthat this computational error depends not only on the total computation time\n$T$ but also on the time derivatives of the adiabatic parameter $s(t)$ at the\nbeginning and the end of evolution. Previous work (Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{82},\n052305) also suggested this result. With six typical paths, we systematically\ndemonstrate how to optimally design an adiabatic path to reduce the\ncomputational errors. Our method has a clear physical picture and also explains\nthe pattern of computational error. In this paper we focus on quantum adiabatic\nsearch algorithm although our results are general.\n", "  Radar has been widely used in military, security, and rescue. Metamaterial\ncloak is employed in stealth targets to evade radar detection. Hence modern\nradar should be reconfigurable at multi-bands for detecting stealth targets,\nwhich might be realized based on microwave photonics. Here, we demonstrate an\nall-optical bandwidth-tailorable radar architecture. It is a coherent system\nutilizing one mode-locked laser for both signal generation and reception.\nHeterodyning of two individually filtered optical pulses that are pre-chirped\nvia wavelength-to-time mapping generates wideband linearly-chirped radar\nsignal. The working bands can be flexibly tailored with desired bandwidth at\nuser-preferred carrier frequency. After modulated onto the pre-chirped optical\npulse, radar echoes are time-stretched and frequency-compressed by several\ntimes. The digitization becomes much easier without loss of detection ability.\nWe believe that the demonstration can innovate the radar's architecture with\nultra-high range resolution.\n", "  This work explores a fundamental dynamical structure for a wide range of\nmany-body quantum systems under periodic driving. Generically, in the\nthermodynamic limit, such systems are known to heat up to infinite temperature\nstates after infinite-time evolution, irrespective of dynamical details. In the\npresent study, instead of considering infinitely long-time scale, we aim to\nprovide a framework to understand the long but finite time behavior, namely the\ntransient dynamics. In the analysis, we focus on the Floquet-Magnus (FM)\nexpansion that gives a formal expression of the effective Hamiltonian on the\nsystem. Although in general the full series expansion is not convergent in the\nthermodynamics limit, we give a clear relationship between the FM expansion and\nthe transient dynamics. More precisely, we rigorously show that a truncated\nversion of the FM expansion accurately describes the exact dynamics for a\nfinite-time scale. Our result reveals a reliable time scale of the validity of\nthe FM expansion, which can be comparable to the experimental time scale.\nFurthermore, we discuss several dynamical phenomena, such as the effect of\nsmall integrability breaking, efficient numerical simulation of periodically\ndriven systems, dynamical localization and thermalization. Especially on\nthermalization, we discuss generic scenario of the prethermalization phenomenon\nin periodically driven systems.\n", "  Functional materials design normally focuses on structurally-ordered systems\nbecause disorder is considered detrimental to many important physical\nproperties. Here we challenge this paradigm by showing that particular types of\nstrongly-correlated disorder can give rise to useful characteristics that are\ninaccessible to ordered states. A judicious combination of low-symmetry\nbuilding unit and high-symmetry topological template leads to aperiodic\n\"procrystalline\" solids that harbour this type of topological disorder. We\nidentify key classes of procrystalline states together with their\ncharacteristic diffraction behaviour, and establish a variety of mappings onto\nknown and target materials. Crucially, the strongly-correlated disorder we\nconsider is associated with specific sets of modulation periodicities\ndistributed throughout the Brillouin zone. Lattice dynamical calculations\nreveal selective disorder-phonon coupling to lattice vibrations characterised\nby these same periodicities. The principal effect on the phonon spectrum is to\nbring about dispersion in energy rather than wave-vector, as in the\npoorly-understood \"waterfall\" effect observed in relaxor ferroelectrics. This\nproperty of procrystalline solids suggests a mechanism by which\nstrongly-correlated topological disorder might allow new and useful\nfunctionalities, including independently-optimised thermal and electronic\ntransport behaviour as required for high-performance thermoelectrics.\n", "  We suggest the so-called bosonic seesaw mechanism in the context of a\nclassically conformal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with two\nHiggs doublet fields. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry is radiatively broken via the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, which also generates the mass terms for the two\nHiggs doublets through quartic Higgs couplings. Their masses are all positive\nbut, nevertheless, the electroweak symmetry breaking is realized by the bosonic\nseesaw mechanism. Analyzing the renormalization group evolutions for all model\ncouplings, we find that a large hierarchy among the quartic Higgs couplings,\nwhich is crucial for the bosonic seesaw mechanism to work, is dramatically\nreduced toward high energies. Therefore, the bosonic seesaw is naturally\nrealized with only a mild hierarchy, if some fundamental theory, which provides\nthe origin of the classically conformal invariance, completes our model at some\nhigh energy, for example, the Planck scale. We identify the regions of model\nparameters which satisfy the perturbativity of the running couplings and the\nelectroweak vacuum stability as well as the naturalness of the electroweak\nscale.\n", "  Semiquantum key distribution allows a quantum party to share a random key\nwith a \"classical\" party who only can prepare and measure qubits in the\ncomputational basis or reorder some qubits when he has access to a quantum\nchannel. In this work, we present a protocol where a secret key can be\nestablished between a quantum user and an almost classical user who only needs\nthe quantum ability to access quantum channels, by securely delegating quantum\ncomputation to a quantum server. We show the proposed protocol is robust even\nwhen the delegated quantum server is a powerful adversary, and is\nexperimentally feasible with current technology. As one party of our protocol\nis the most quantum-resource efficient, it can be more practical and\nsignificantly widen the applicability scope of quantum key distribution.\n", "  In low-energy effective string theory, $\\alpha'$ corrections involve the\ncoupling of the dilaton field to Gauss-Bonnet term. We assume that the dilaton\npotential is fine tuned so that the dilaton field may oscillate rapidly for a\nwhile around the minimum of its potential but the inflation background is not\naffected. By numerical method, we find that if the dilaton starts to oscillate\nat the time of about $\\sim 60$ e-folds before the end of inflation,\n$\\alpha^\\prime$ correction may bring unusual oscillations to the inflationary\ngravitational wave spectrum, which might be measurably imprinted in the CMB\nB-mode polarization.\n", "  Instances of discrete quantum systems coupled to a continuum of oscillators\nare ubiquitous in physics. Often the continua are approximated by a discrete\nset of modes. We derive analytical error bounds on expectation values of system\nobservables that have been time evolved under such discretised Hamiltonians.\nThese bounds take on the form of a function of time and the number of discrete\nmodes, where the discrete modes are chosen according to Gauss quadrature rules.\nThe derivation makes use of tools from the field of Lieb-Robinson bounds and\nthe theory of orthonormal polynominals.\n", "  We demonstrate that for general conformal field theories (CFTs), the\nentanglement for small perturbations of the vacuum is organized in a novel\nholographic way. For spherical entangling regions in a constant time slice,\nperturbations in the entanglement entropy are solutions of a Klein-Gordon\nequation in an auxiliary de Sitter (dS) spacetime. The role of the emergent\ntime-like direction in dS is played by the size of the entangling sphere. For\nCFTs with extra conserved charges, e.g., higher spin charges, we show that each\ncharge gives rise to a separate dynamical scalar field in dS.\n", "  All inequivalent realizations of the Galilei algebras of dimensions not\ngreater than five are constructed using the algebraic approach proposed by I.\nShirokov. The varieties of the deformed Galilei algebras are discussed and\nfamilies of one-parametric deformations are presented in explicit form. It is\nalso shown that a number of well-known and physically interesting equations and\nsystems are invariant with respect to the considered Galilei algebras or their\ndeformations.\n", "  The inverse cascade of magnetic energy occurs when helicity or rotational\ninstability exists in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system. This well known\nphenomenon has been considered as a basis for the large scale magnetic field in\nuniverse. However nonhelical magnetic energy in a decaying MHD system also\nmigrates toward the large scale, which holds vital clues to the origin of large\nscale magnetic field in a quiescent astrophysical system. Zeldovich's rope\ndynamo model is considered as a basic and symbolistic model of magnetic field\namplification. However, the rope model assuming specific external forces like\nbuoyancy or Coriolis force is not appropriate for a decaying turbulent system\nwithout any external force. So we suggest a new dynamo model based on magnetic\ninduction equation excluding a forcing source. This model shows the expansion\nand growth of magnetic field (flux) is basically the redistribution of energy\nin the system. The transfer of magnetic energy is in fact a successive\ninduction of magnetic field resulted from the interaction between the fluid\nmotion and seed magnetic field. We also discuss about an analytic theorem based\non the scaling invariant MHD equation.\n", "  We study the possibility of fractional quantum Hall effects in HgTe quantum\nwells using exact diagonalization. Our results show that Laughlin states, the\nMoore-Read state, and the Read-Rezayi $Z_3$ state can all be supported.\nHowever, near the level crossing point (of the single-particle spectrum), the\ngap can be destroyed by Landau level mixing, and the Moore-Read state and the\nRead-Rezayi state dominate over their respective competing states only for wide\nwells. For smaller well widths the Moore-Read state crosses over to the\ncomposite fermion Fermi sea, while the Read-Rezayi state loses its dominance\nover the hierarchy state.\n", "  The CRESST-II experiment uses cryogenic detectors to search for nuclear\nrecoil events induced by the elastic scattering of dark matter particles in\nCaWO$_4$ crystals. Given the low energy threshold of our detectors in\ncombination with light target nuclei, low mass dark matter particles can be\nprobed with high sensitivity. In this letter we present the results from data\nof a single detector module corresponding to 52 kg live days. A blind analysis\nis carried out. With an energy threshold for nuclear recoils of 307 eV we\nsubstantially enhance the sensitivity for light dark matter. Thereby, we extend\nthe reach of direct dark matter experiments to the sub-region and demonstrate\nthat the energy threshold is the key parameter in the search for low mass dark\nmatter particles.\n", "  A simplest case, where a contribution to a color ordered multi-gluon\namplitude, describing a three body partonic interaction, can split into two\nweakly correlated two-body gluon scattering amplitudes and may thus contribute\nto a Double Parton Interaction, is briefly discussed. We find that the color\nordered amplitude is not enhanced in the typical configuration generated by a\nDPI, where the transverse momenta of final state gluons are compensated\npairwise, while a dominant contribution to the multi-gluon amplitude is due to\nterms proportional to the fusion amplitude of two initial state gluons. Which\ncorresponds to an amplitude effectively describing a two rather than a\nthree-body partonic interaction.\n", "  In this paper we present a general method for estimating rates of accidental\ncoincidence between a pair of single photon detectors operated within their\nsaturation regimes. By folding the effects of recovery time of both detectors\nand the detection circuit into an \"effective duty cycle\" we are able to\naccomodate complex recovery behaviour at high event rates. As an example, we\nprovide a detailed high-level model for the behaviour of passively quenched\navalanche photodiodes, and demonstrate effective background subtraction at\nrates commonly associated with detector saturation. We show that by\npost-processing using the updated model, we observe an improvement in\npolarization correlation visibility from 88.7% to 96.9% in our experimental\ndataset. This technique will be useful in improving the signal-to-noise ratio\nin applications which depend on coincidence measurements, especially in\nsituations where rapid changes in flux may cause detector saturation.\n", "  A flux formulation of Double Field Theory on group manifold is derived and\napplied to study generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, which give rise\nto a bosonic subsector of half-maximal, electrically gauged supergravities. In\ncontrast to the flux formulation of original DFT, the covariant fluxes split\ninto a fluctuation and a background part. The latter is connected to a\n$2D$-dimensional, pseudo Riemannian manifold, which is isomorphic to a Lie\ngroup embedded into O($D,D$). All fields and parameters of generalized\ndiffeomorphisms are supported on this manifold, whose metric is spanned by the\nbackground vielbein $E_A{}^I \\in$ GL($2D$). This vielbein takes the role of the\ntwist in conventional generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications. By doing\nso, it solves the long standing problem of constructing an appropriate twist\nfor each solution of the embedding tensor. Using the geometric structure,\nabsent in original DFT, $E_A{}^I$ is identified with the left invariant\nMaurer-Cartan form on the group manifold, in the same way as it is done in\ngeometric Scherk-Schwarz reductions. We show in detail how the Maurer-Cartan\nform for semisimple and solvable Lie groups is constructed starting from the\nLie algebra. For all compact embeddings in O($3,3$), we calculate $E_A{}^I$.\n", "  A search for fermionic top quark partners T of charge 2/3 is presented. The\nsearch is carried out in proton-proton collisions corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected at a center-of-mass\nenergy of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The T quarks are\nassumed to be produced strongly in pairs and can decay into tH, tZ, and bW. The\nsearch is performed in five exclusive channels: a single-lepton channel, a\nmultilepton channel, two all-hadronic channels optimized either for the bW or\nthe tH decay, and one channel in which the Higgs boson decays into two photons.\nThe results are found to be compatible with the standard model expectations in\nall the investigated final states. A statistical combination of these results\nis performed and lower limits on the T quark mass are set. Depending on the\nbranching fractions, lower mass limits between 720 and 920 GeV at 95%\nconfidence level are found. These are among the strongest limits on vector-like\nT quarks obtained to date.\n", "  Microscopic optical potentials for low energy proton reactions have been\nobtained by folding density dependent M3Y interaction derived from nuclear\nmatter calculation with densities from mean field approach to study\nastrophysically important proton rich nuclei in mass 100-120 region. We compare\nS factors for low-energy $(p,\\gamma)$ reactions with available experimental\ndata and further calculate astrophysical reaction rates for $(p,\\gamma)$ and\n$(p,n)$ reactions. Again we choose some nonlinear R3Y interactions from RMF\ncalculation and folded them with corresponding RMF densities to reproduce\nexperimental S factor values in this mass region. Finally the effect of\nnonlinearity on our result is discussed.\n", "  An explicit perturbative computation of the Mori's memory function was\nperformed by G\\\"otze and W\\\"olfle (GW) to calculate Generalized Drude\nscattering (GDS) rate for the case of electron-impurity and electron-phonon\nscattering in metals by assuming constant electronic density of states at the\nFermi energy. In the present investigation, we go beyond this assumption and\nextend the GW formalism to the case in which there is a gap around the Fermi\nsurface in electron density of states. The resulting GDS is compared with a\nrecent one by Sharapov and Carbotte (SC) obtained through a different route. We\nfind good agreement between the two at finite frequencies. However, we find\ndiscrepancies in the dc scattering rate. These are due to a crucial assumption\nmade in SC namely $\\omega >> \\vert \\Sigma(\\epsilon+\\omega) -\n\\Sigma^{*}(\\epsilon)\\vert$. No such high frequency assumption is made in the\nmemory function based technique.\n", "  A new approach is developed to evaluate contribution of the electron-electron\ncorrelations into bremsstrahlung from few-electron ions and atoms. Our approach\nis based on the explicit formula for the electron density distribution in such\nsystems. We derive the closed analytical formula for the matrix elements which\nare needed for highly accurate computations of atomic form-factors of\ntwo-electron atoms and ions. We also discuss the energy loss due to\nbremsstrahlung in a plasma which contains multi-charged ions and free\nelectrons. Bremsstrahlung from a high-temperature plasma is considered as well\nas its role in the high-temperature burn-up of deuterium plasma.\n", "  We introduce a hybrid method to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy by\nsimultaneous measurements of responses of at least two detectors to\nantineutrino and neutrino fluxes from accretion and cooling phases of\ncore-collapse supernovae. The (anti)neutrino-nucleus cross sections for\n$^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb are calculated in the framework of the relativistic\nnuclear energy density functional and weak interaction Hamiltonian, while the\ncross sections for inelastic scattering on free protons\n$\\mathrm{p}(\\bar{\\nu}_\\mathrm{e},\\mathrm{e}^{+})\\mathrm{n}$ are obtained using\nheavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory. The modelling of (anti)neutrino fluxes\nemitted from a protoneutron star in a core-collapse supernova include\ncollective and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effects inside the exploding star.\nThe particle emission rates from the elementary decay modes of the daughter\nnuclei are calculated for normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. It is\nshown that simultaneous use of (anti)neutrino detectors with different target\nmaterial allows to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy from the ratios of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{e}$- and $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mathrm{e}$-induced particle emissions. This\nhybrid method favors neutrinos from the supernova cooling phase and the\nimplementation of detectors with heavier target nuclei ($^{208}$Pb) for the\nneutrino sector, while for antineutrinos the use of free protons in mineral oil\nor water is the appropriate choice.\n", "  Skyrmions are topological spin textures of interest for fundamental science\nand applications. Previous theoretical studies have focused on systems with\nbroken bulk inversion symmetry, where skyrmions are stabilized by easy-axis\nanisotropy. We investigate here systems that break surface inversion symmetry,\nin addition to possible broken bulk inversion. This leads to two distinct\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) terms with strengths $D_\\perp$, arising from Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC), and $D_\\parallel$ from Dresselhaus SOC. We show that\nskyrmions become progressively more stable with increasing\n$D_\\perp/D_\\parallel$, extending into the regime of easy-plane anisotropy. We\nfind that the spin texture and topological charge density of skyrmions develops\nnontrivial spatial structure, with quantized topological charge in a unit cell\ngiven by a Chern number. Our results give a design principle for tuning Rashba\nSOC and magnetic anisotropy to stabilize skyrmions in thin films, surfaces,\ninterfaces and bulk magnetic materials that break mirror symmetry.\n", "  Understanding the formation of Cooper pairs and the resulting thermodynamic\nproperties of a low-dimensional Fermi gas is an important area of research,\nelucidating our understanding of high temperature superconductors. In lower\ndimensions quantum fluctuations are expected to play an increasingly important\nrole and the reliability of strong-coupling theories becomes questionable.\nHere, we present a comparison of recent thermodynamic measurements and\ntheoretical predictions from different many-body $T$-matrix theories for a\ntwo-dimensional strongly interacting Fermi gas in the normal state. We find\nthat the fully self-consistent $T$-matrix theory provides the best description\nof the experimental data over a wide range of temperatures and interatomic\ninteractions. Our comparison reveals the crucial role played by the\ninteractions between Cooper pairs and suggests that the future development of a\nquantitative strong-coupling theory for two-dimensional Fermi superfluids must\nexplicitly take into account the diagrams that are responsible for pair-pair\ninteractions.\n", "  The relativistic particle-vibration coupling (RPVC) model is extended by the\ninclusion of spin- and isospin-flip excitation modes into the phonon space,\nintroducing a new mechanism of dynamical interaction between nucleons with\ndifferent isospin in the nuclear medium. Protons and neutrons exchange by\ncollective modes which are formed by isovector $\\pi$ and $\\rho$-mesons, in\nturn, softened considerably because of coupling to nucleons of the medium.\nThese modes are investigated within the proton-neutron relativistic random\nphase approximation (pn-RRPA) and relativistic proton-neutron time blocking\napproximation (pn-RTBA). The appearance of isospin-flip states with sizable\ntransition probabilities at low energies points out that they are likely to\ncouple to the single-particle degrees of freedom and, in addition to isoscalar\nlow-lying phonons, to modify their spectroscopic characteristics. Such a\ncoupling is quantified for the shell structure of $^{100,132}$Sn and found\nsignificant for the location of the dominant single-particle states.\n", "  An analysis of dijet events in PbPb and pp collisions is performed to explore\nthe properties of energy loss by partons traveling in a quark-gluon plasma.\nData are collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV at\nthe LHC. The distribution of transverse momentum (pT) surrounding dijet systems\nis measured by selecting charged particles in different ranges of pT and at\ndifferent angular cones of pseudorapidity and azimuth. The measurement is\nperformed as a function of centrality of the PbPb collisions, the pT asymmetry\nof the jets in the dijet pair, and the distance parameter R used in the anti-kt\njet clustering algorithm. In events with unbalanced dijets, PbPb collisions\nshow an enhanced multiplicity in the hemisphere of the subleading jet, with the\npT imbalance compensated by an excess of low-pT particles at large angles from\nthe jet axes.\n", "  General criteria for the existence of conformally flat Riemannian solutions\nin 3D Poincar\\'e gauge theory without matter are formulated. Using these\ncriteria, we show that the Oliva-Tempo-Troncoso black hole, a solution of the\nBergshoeff-Hohm-Town\\-send gravity, is also an exact vacuum solution of the\nPoincar\\'e gauge theory. The related conserved charges, calculated from the\nHamiltonian boundary term, are shown to satisfy the first law of black hole\nthermodynamics. The form of the boundary term is verified by using the\ncovariant Hamiltonian approach.\n", "  Dilute polymer solutions are known to exhibit purely elastic instabilities\neven when the fluid inertia is negligible. Here we report the quantitative\nevidence of two consecutive oscillatory elastic instabilities in an elongation\nflow of a dilute polymer solution as realized in a T-junction geometry with a\nlong recirculating cavity. The main result reported here is the observation and\ncharacterization of the first transition as a forward Hopf bifurcation resulted\nin a uniformly oscillating state due to breaking of time translational\ninvariance. This unexpected finding is in contrast with previous experiments\nand numerical simulations performed in similar ranges of the $Wi$ and $Re$\nnumbers, where the forward fork-bifurcation into a steady asymmetric flow due\nto the broken spatial inversion symmetry was reported. We discuss the plausible\ndiscrepancy between our findings and previous studies that could be attributed\nto the long recirculating cavity, where the length of the recirculating cavity\nplays a crucial role in the breaking of time translational invariance instead\nof the spatial inversion. The second transition is manifested via time\naperiodic transverse fluctuations of the interface between the dyed and undyed\nfluid streams at the channel junction and advected downstream by the mean flow.\nBoth instabilities are characterized by fluid discharge-rate and simultaneous\nimaging of the interface between the dyed and undyed fluid streams in the\noutflow channel.\n", "  Strengthening of materials and preventing abrupt fracture are really\nchallenging jobs in the field of engineering and material science. Such\nproblems can be resolved by using composite materials. In this work, we have\nstudied the fracture process of a composite material in light of fiber bundle\nmodel with different elastic constants as well as different random threshold\nbreaking strength of fibers. The critical width of the threshold distribution\n($\\delta_c$), for which abrupt failure occurs, is studied both analytically and\nnumerically with increasing number of components $(k)$ in the composite and it\nis shown that $\\delta_c$ is inversely related to $k$. Corresponding phase\ndiagram for the model suggests decrease in the tendency of abrupt fracture as\nnumber of components in the composite increase.\n", "  Using the density-matrix renormalization group in combination with the\nChebyshev polynomial expansion technique, we study the two-hole excitation\nspectrum of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the entire filling range from\nthe completely occupied band (n=2) down to half-filling (n=1). For strong\ninteractions, the spectra reveal multiplon physics, i.e., relevant final states\nare characterized by two (doublon), three (triplon), four (quadruplon) and more\nholes, potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite\nlifetime. These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely\ndifferent spectral weights as well as to different continua. The complex\nmultiplon phenomenology is analyzed by interpreting not only local and\nk-resolved two-hole spectra but also three- and four-hole spectra for the\nHubbard model and by referring to effective low-energy models. In addition, a\nfilter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific\ninformation on the final states at a given excitation energy. While multiplons\ncomposed of an odd number of holes do neither form stable compounds nor\nwell-defined resonances unless a nearest-neighbor density interaction V is\nadded to the Hamiltonian, the doublon and the quadruplon are well-defined\nresonances. The k-resolved four-hole spectrum at n=2 represents an interesting\nspecial case where a completely stable quadruplon turns into a resonance by\nmerging with the doublon-doublon continuum at a critical wave vector. For all\nfillings with n > 1, the doublon lifetime is strongly k-dependent and is even\ninfinite at the Brillouin zone edges as demonstrated by k-resolved two-hole\nspectra. This can be traced back to the \"hidden\" charge-SU(2) symmetry of the\nmodel which is explicitly broken off half-filling and gives rise to a massive\ncollective excitation, even for arbitrary higher-dimensional but bipartite\nlattices.\n", "  Luttinger liquids (LLs) are one dimensional systems with well-understood\ninstabilities due to umklapp or backscattering. We study a generalization of\nthe Luttinger model, which incorporates a time reversal symmetry breaking\ninteraction producing a complex forward scattering amplitude ($g_2$ process).\nThe resulting low energy state is still a LL, and belongs to the family of\ninteracting Schulz-Shastry models. Remarkably, it becomes increasingly robust\nagainst additional perturbations -- for purely imaginary $g_2$, both umklapp\nand local backscattering are always irrelevant. Changing the phase of the\ninteraction generates a non-trivial Berry phase, with a universal geometric\nphase difference between ground and a one boson excited state depending only on\nthe LL parameter.\n", "  We introduce brane brick models, a novel type of Type IIA brane\nconfigurations consisting of D4-branes ending on an NS5-brane. Brane brick\nmodels are T-dual to D1-branes over singular toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. They\nfully encode the infinite class of 2d (generically) N=(0,2) gauge theories on\nthe worldvolume of the D1-branes and streamline their connection to the probed\ngeometries. For this purpose, we also introduce new combinatorial procedures\nfor deriving the Calabi-Yau associated to a given gauge theory and vice versa.\n", "  Unidirectional light transport in one-dimensional nanomaterials at the\nquantum level is a crucial goal to achieve for upcoming computational devices.\nWe here employ a full-quantum mechanical approach based on master equation to\ndescribe unidirectional light transport through a pair of two-level systems\ncoupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By comparing with published\nsemi-classical results, we find that the nonlinearity of the system is reduced,\nthereby reducing also the unidirectional light transport efficiency. Albeit not\nfully efficient, we find that the considered quantum system can work as a light\ndiode with an efficiency of approximately 60%. Our results may be used in\nquantum computation with classical and quantized light.\n", "  We study the exclusive semileptonic $B$-meson decays $B\\to\nK(\\pi)\\ell^+\\ell^-$, $B\\to K(\\pi)\\nu\\bar\\nu$, and $B\\to\\pi\\tau\\nu$, computing\nobservables in the Standard model using the recent lattice-QCD results for the\nunderlying form factors from the Fermilab Lattice and MILC Collaborations.\nThese processes provide theoretically clean windows into physics beyond the\nStandard Model because the hadronic uncertainties are now under good control\nfor suitably binned observables. For example, the resulting partially\nintegrated branching fractions for $B\\to\\pi\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $B\\to K\\mu^+\\mu^-$\noutside the charmonium resonance region are 1-2$\\sigma$ higher than the LHCb\nCollaboration's recent measurements, where the theoretical and experimental\nerrors are commensurate. The combined tension is 1.7$\\sigma$. Combining the\nStandard-Model rates with LHCb's measurements yields values for the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements\n$|V_{td}|=7.45{(69)}\\times10^{-3}$, $|V_{ts}|=35.7(1.5)\\times10^{-3}$, and\n$|V_{td}/V_{ts}|=0.201{(20)}$, which are compatible with the values obtained\nfrom neutral $B_{(s)}$-meson oscillations and have competitive uncertainties.\nAlternatively, taking the CKM matrix elements from unitarity, we constrain\nnew-physics contributions at the electroweak scale. The constraints on the\nWilson coefficients ${\\rm Re}(C_9)$ and ${\\rm Re}(C_{10})$ from\n$B\\to\\pi\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $B\\to K\\mu^+\\mu^-$ are competitive with those from\n$B\\to K^* \\mu^+\\mu^-$, and display a 2.0$\\sigma$ tension with the Standard\nModel. Our predictions for $B\\to K(\\pi)\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $B\\to\\pi\\tau\\nu$ are\nclose to the current experimental limits.\n", "  Recently we have reported on a compact microcontroller-based unit developed\nto accurately synchronise excimer laser pulses (Robert Mingesz et al, Fluct.\nNoise Lett. 11, 1240007 (2012), DOI: 10.1142/S021947751240007X,\narXiv:1109.2632). We have shown that dithering based on the random jitter noise\nplus pseudorandom numbers can be used in the digital control system to\nradically reduce the long-term drift of the laser pulse from the trigger and to\nimprove the accuracy of the synchronisation. In this update paper we present\nour new experimental results obtained by the use of the delay controller unit\nto tune the timing of a KrF excimer laser as an addition to our previous\nnumerical simulation results. The hardware was interfaced to the laser using\noptical signal paths in order to reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic\ninterference and the control algorithm tested by simulations were applied in\nthe experiments. We have found that the system is able to reduce the delay\nuncertainty very close to the theoretical limit and performs well in real\napplications. The simple, compact and flexible system is universal enough to be\nused in various multidisciplinary applications as well.\n", "  We determined the magnetic B-T phase diagram of PdFe bilayer on Ir(111)\nsurface by performing Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations based on an\neffective classical spin model. The parameters of the spin model were\ndetermined by ab initio methods. At low temperatures we found three types of\nordered phases, while at higher temperatures, below the completely disordered\nparamagnetic phase, a large region of the phase diagram is associated with a\nfluctuation-disordered phase. Within the applied model, this state is\ncharacterized by the presence of skyrmions with finite lifetime. According to\nthe simulations, this lifetime follows the Arrhenius law as a function of\ntemperature.\n", "  In the composite models with colored substructure of the fermions the color\nsinglet leptons are accompanied by a composite color octet partners, which are\nknown as leptogluons. We consider the effect of leptogluons in the dilepton\nproduction at the LHC and show that in the reachable parameter range this\neffect is typically dominated by t-channel leptogluon exchange (indirect\nchannel). We show that this channel alone can give a sizable contribution to\nthe dimuon production at the LHC for TeV scale values of the invariant mass of\nthe muon-antimuon pairs.\n", "  Cold Rydberg atoms are known to display dipole-dipole interaction allowed\nresonances, also called F\\\"orster resonances, which lead to an efficient energy\ntransfer when the proper electric field is used. This electric field also\nenables resonances which do not respect the dipole-dipole selection rules under\nzero field. A few of these quasi-forbidden resonances have been observed but\nthey are often overlooked. Here we show that in cold $^{133}$Cs atoms there is\na large number of these resonances that display a significant transfer\nefficiency due to their strong interactions, even at low electric field. We\nalso develop a graphical method enabling to find all possible resonances\nsimultaneously. The resulting dramatic increase in the total number of\naddressable resonant energy transfers at different electric fields could have\nimplications in the search for few-body interactions or macro-molecules built\nfrom Rydberg atoms.\n", "  We present here the first abundance analysis of 44 late B, A and F-type\nmembers of the young open cluster M6 (NGC 6405, age about 75 Myrs). Spectra,\ncovering the 4500 to 5800 \\AA{} wavelength range, were obtained using the\nFLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph attached to the ESO Very Large Telescopes (VLT). We\ndetermined the atmospheric parameters using calibrations of the Geneva\nphotometry and by adjusting the $H_{\\beta}$ profiles to synthetic ones. The\nabundances of up to 20 chemical elements, were derived for 19 late B, 16 A and\n9 F stars by iteratively adjusting synthetic spectra to the observations. We\nalso derived a mean cluster metallicity of $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]=0.07\\pm0.03}$ dex\nfrom the iron abundances of the F-type stars. We find that, for most chemical\nelements, the normal late B and A-type stars exhibit larger star-to-star\nabundance variations than the F-type stars do probably because of the faster\nrotation of the B and A stars. The abundances of C, O, Mg, Si and Sc appear to\nbe anticorrelated to that of Fe, while the opposite holds for the abundances of\nCa, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Y, and Ba about as expected if radiative diffusion is\nefficient in the envelopes of these stars. In the course of this analysis, we\ndiscovered five new peculiar stars: one mild-Am, one Am, and one Fm star (HD\n318091, CD-32 13109, GSC 07380-01211), one HgMn star (HD 318126), and one\nHe-weak P-rich (HD 318101) star. We also discovered a new spectroscopic binary,\nmost likely a SB2. We performed a detailed modelling of HD 318101,the new\nHe-weak P-rich CP star, using the Montr\\'eal stellar evolution code XEVOL which\ntreats self-consistently all particle transport processes. Although the overall\nabundance pattern of this star is properly reproduced, we find that detailed\nabundances (in particular the high P excess) resisted modelling attempts even\nwhen a range of turbulence profiles and mass loss rates were considered.\n", "  We point out a subtlety in choosing the radiation gauge (A_z=0 combined with\nthe Lorenz gauge) for gauge fields in AdS/QCD for black hole backgrounds. We\nthen demonstrate the effect of this on the momentum-dependence of the spectral\nfunctions of the J/psi vector meson, showing a spreading with momentum and a\nbreaking of isotropy, in contrast to previous results in the literature. We\nalso discuss the dependence on a background magnetic field, following our\nearlier proposed model.\n", "  We have used a plane-wave expansion method to theoretically study the\nfar-field head-media optical interaction in HAMR. For the ASTC media stack\nspecifically, we notice the outstanding sensitivity related to interlayer's\noptical thickness for media reflection and magnetic layer's light absorption.\nWith 10-nm interlayer thickness change, the recording layer absorption can be\nchanged by more than 25%. The 2-D results are found to correlate well with full\n3-D model and magnetic recording tests on flyable disc with different\ninterlayer thickness.\n", "  The prototype of the NIKA2 camera, NIKA, is an instrument operating at the\nIRAM 30-m telescope, which can observe simultaneously at 150 and 260GHz. One of\nthe main goals of NIKA2 is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy\nclusters at high resolution using the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect. Such\nobservations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure\ndistributions even at high redshifts. However, an important fraction of\nclusters host submm and/or radio point sources, which can significantly affect\nthe reconstructed signal. Here we report on <20\" resolution observations at 150\nand 260GHz of the cluster MACSJ1424, which hosts both radio and submm point\nsources. We examine the morphology of the tSZ signal and compare it to other\ndatasets. The NIKA data are combined with Herschel satellite data to study the\nSED of the submm point source contaminants. We then perform a joint\nreconstruction of the intracluster medium (ICM) electronic pressure and density\nby combining NIKA, Planck, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data, focusing on the impact\nof the radio and submm sources on the reconstructed pressure profile. We find\nthat large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources\nbecause of the resolved nature of the NIKA observations. The reconstructed\npressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point\nsources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints\non the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these\ncontaminants. The comparison with X-ray only data shows good agreement for the\npressure, temperature, and entropy profiles, which all indicate that MACSJ1424\nis a dynamically relaxed cool core system. The present observations illustrate\nthe possibility of measuring these quantities with a relatively small\nintegration time, even at high redshift and without X-ray spectroscopy.\n", "  The nuclear electric dipole moment is a very sensitive probe of CP violation\nbeyond the standard model, and for light nuclei, it can be evaluated accurately\nusing few-body calculational methods. In this talk, we present the deuteron,\n$^3$He, $^3$H, $^6$Li, and $^9$Be electric dipole moments calculated using the\nGaussian expansion method with a realistic nuclear force, and assuming the\none-meson exchange model for the P, CP-odd nuclear force. We then give future\nprospects for models beyond the standard model such as the supersymmetry.\n", "  In cosmological first-order phase transitions, gravitational waves are\ngenerated by the collisions of bubble walls and by the bulk motions caused in\nthe fluid. A sizeable signal may result from fast-moving walls. In this work we\nstudy the hydrodynamics associated to the fastest propagation modes, namely,\nultra-relativistic detonations and runaway solutions. We compute the energy\ninjected by the phase transition into the fluid and the energy which\naccumulates in the bubble walls. We provide analytic approximations and fits as\nfunctions of the net force acting on the wall, which can be readily evaluated\nfor specific models. We also study the back-reaction of hydrodynamics on the\nwall motion, and we discuss the extrapolation of the friction force away from\nthe ultra-relativistic limit. We use these results to estimate the\ngravitational wave signal from detonations and runaway walls.\n", "  This paper presents two models that exemplify psychological factors as a\ndeterminant and as a consequence of social network characteristics. There is an\nendogeneity considered in network formation: while the social experiences have\nimpacts on people, their current psychological states and traits affect network\nevolution. The first model is an agent-based model over Bianconi-Barabasi\nnetworks, used to explain the relation between network size, extroversion, and\nage of individuals. The second model deals with the emergence of urban tribes\nas a consequence of a smaller propensity to communicate with different with\ndifferent traits and opinions.\n", "  We demonstrate simple and robust methods for Doppler cooling and obtaining\nhigh fluorescence from trapped 43Ca+ ions at a magnetic field of 146 Gauss.\nThis field gives access to a magnetic-field-independent \"atomic clock\" qubit\ntransition within the ground level hyperfine structure of the ion, but also\ncauses the complex internal structure of the 64 states relevant to Doppler\ncooling to be spread over many times the atomic transition line-width. Using a\ntime-dependent optical Bloch equation simulation of the system we develop a\nsimple scheme to Doppler-cool the ion on a two-photon dark resonance, which is\nrobust to typical experimental variations in laser intensities, detunings and\npolarizations. We experimentally demonstrate cooling to a temperature of 0.3\nmK, slightly below the Doppler limit for the corresponding two-level system,\nand then use Raman sideband laser cooling to cool further to the ground states\nof the ion's radial motional modes. These methods will enable two-qubit\nentangling gates with this ion, which is one of the most promising qubits so\nfar developed.\n", "  The abelian sandpile model defines a Markov chain whose states are\ninteger-valued functions on the vertices of a simple connected graph $G$. By\nviewing this chain as a (nonreversible) random walk on an abelian group, we\ngive a formula for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors in terms of `multiplicative\nharmonic functions' on the vertices of $G$. We show that the spectral gap of\nthe sandpile chain is within a constant factor of the length of the shortest\nnon-integer vector in the dual Laplacian lattice, while the mixing time is at\nmost a constant times the smoothing parameter of the Laplacian lattice. We find\na surprising inverse relationship between the spectral gap of the sandpile\nchain and that of simple random walk on $G$: If the latter has a sufficiently\nlarge spectral gap, then the former has a small gap! In the case where $G$ is\nthe complete graph on $n$ vertices, we show that the sandpile chain exhibits\ncutoff at time $\\frac{1}{4\\pi^{2}}n^{3}\\log n$.\n", "  Arrival directions of 40 neutrino events with energies >~100 TeV, observed by\nthe IceCube experiment, are studied. Their distribution in the Galactic\nlatitude and in the angular distance to the Galactic Center allow to search for\nthe Milky-Way disk and halo-related components, respectively. No statistically\nsignificant evidence for the disk component is found, though even 100% disk\norigin of the flux is allowed at the 90% confidence level. Contrary, the\nGalactic Center-Anticenter dipole anisotropy, specific for dark-matter decays\n(annihilation) or for interactions of cosmic rays with the extended halo of\ncircumgalactic gas, is clearly favoured over the isotropic distribution (the\nprobability of a fluctuation of the isotropic signal is ~2%).\n", "  There are a lot of works within a class of classically scale invariant model,\nwhich is motivated by solving the gauge hierarchy problem. In this context, the\nHiggs mass vanishes at the UV scale due to the classically scale invariance,\nand is generated via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. Since the mass generation\nshould occur not so far from the electroweak scale, we extend the standard\nmodel only around the TeV scale. We construct a model which can achieve the\ngauge coupling unification at the UV scale. In the same way, the model can\nrealize the vacuum stability, smallness of active neutrino masses, baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, and dark matter relic abundance. The model predicts\nthe existence vector-like fermions charged under $SU(3)_C$ with masses lower\nthan $1\\,{\\rm TeV}$, and the SM singlet Majorana dark matter with mass lower\nthan $2.6\\,{\\rm TeV}$.\n", "  Accurate stellar parameters are needed in numerous domains of astrophysics.\nThe position of stars on the H-R diagram is an important indication of their\nstructure and evolution, and it helps improve stellar models. Furthermore, the\nage and mass of stars hosting planets are required elements for studying\nexoplanetary systems. We aim at determining accurate parameters of a set of 18\nbright exoplanet host and potential host stars from interferometric\nmeasurements, photometry, and stellar models. Using the VEGA/CHARA\ninterferometer, we measured the angular diameters of 18 stars, ten of which\nhost exoplanets. We combined them with their distances to estimate their radii.\nWe used photometry to derive their bolometric flux and, then, their effective\ntemperature and luminosity to place them on the H-R diagram. We then used the\nPARSEC models to derive their best fit ages and masses, with error bars derived\nfrom MC calculations. Our interferometric measurements lead to an average of\n1.9% uncertainty on angular diameters and 3% on stellar radii. There is good\nagreement between measured and indirect estimations of angular diameters (from\nSED fitting or SB relations) for MS stars, but not as good for more evolved\nstars. For each star, we provide a likelihood map in the mass-age plane;\ntypically, two distinct sets of solutions appear (an old and a young age). The\nerrors on the ages and masses that we provide account for the metallicity\nuncertainties, which are often neglected by other works. From measurements of\nits radius and density, we also provide the mass of 55 Cnc independently of\nmodels. From the stellar masses, we provide new estimates of semi-major axes\nand minimum masses of exoplanets with reliable uncertainties. We also derive\nthe radius, density, and mass of 55 Cnc e, a super-Earth that transits its\nstellar host. Our exoplanetary parameters reflect the known population of\nexoplanets.\n", "  By applying the recurrence approach and coupling constant metamorphosis, we\nconstruct higher order integrals of motion for the Stackel equivalents of the\n$N$-dimensional superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb model with non-central terms and\nthe double singular oscillators of type ($n, N-n$). We show how the integrals\nof motion generate higher rank cubic algebra $C(3)\\oplus L_1\\oplus L_2$ with\nstructure constants involving Casimir operators of the Lie algebras $L_1$ and\n$L_2$. The realizations of the cubic algebras in terms of deformed oscillators\nenable us to construct finite dimensional unitary representations and derive\nthe degenerate energy spectra of the corresponding superintegrable systems.\n", "  Microring resonators made from silicon are becoming a popular microscale\ndevice format for generating photon pairs at telecommunications wavelengths at\nroom temperature. In compact devices with a footprint less than $5\\times\n10^{-4}$ mm$^2$, we demonstrate pair generation using only a few microwatts of\naverage pump power. We discuss the role played by important parameters such as\nthe loss, group-velocity dispersion and the ring-waveguide coupling coefficient\nin finding the optimum operating point for silicon microring pair generation.\nSilicon photonics can be fabricated using deep ultraviolet lithography\nwafer-scale fabrication processes, which is scalable and cost-effective. Such\nsmall devices and low pump power requirements, and the side-coupled waveguide\ngeometry which uses an integrated waveguide, could be beneficial for future\nscaled-up architectures where many pair-generation devices are required on the\nsame chip.\n", "  We present a model of a spin-squeezed rotation sensor utilising the Sagnac\neffect in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring trap. The two input\nstates for the interferometer are seeded using Raman pulses with Laguerre-Gauss\nbeams and are amplified by the bosonic enhancement of spin-exchange collisions,\nresulting in spin-squeezing and potential quantum enhancement in the\ninterferometry. The ring geometry has an advantage over separated beam path\natomic rotation sensors due to the uniform condensate density. We model the\ninterferometer both analytically and numerically for realistic experimental\nparameters and find that significant quantum enhancement is possible, but this\nenhancement is partially degraded when working in a regime with strong atomic\ninteractions.\n", "  We have studied the superlattices with alternating block layers (BLs) of\nheavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 and conventional-metal YbCoIn5 by\nsite-selective nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy, which uniquely\noffers spatially-resolved dynamical magnetic information. We find that the\npresence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations is confined to the Ce-BLs,\nindicating that magnetic degrees of freedom of f-electrons are quenched inside\nthe Yb-BLs. Contrary to simple expectations that the two-dimensionalization\nenhances fluctuations, we observe that antiferromagnetic fluctuations are\nrapidly suppressed with decreasing Ce-BL thickness. Moreover, the suppression\nis more prominent near the interfaces between the BLs. These results imply\nsignificant effects of local inversion-symmetry breaking at the interfaces.\n", "  In the quest aimed at unveiling alternative plasmonic elements overcoming\nnoble metals for selected applications in photonics, we investigate by\nnumerical simulations the near ultraviolet-to-near infrared optical response of\nsolid and liquid Bi nanospheres embedded in a dielectric matrix. We also\ndetermine the resulting transmission contrast upon reversible solid-liquid\nphase transition to evaluate their potential for switchable optical filtering.\nThe optical response of the solid (liquid) Bi nanospheres is ruled by localized\npolaritonic (plasmonic) resonances tunable by controlling the diameter. For a\nselected diameter between 20 nm and 50 nm, both solid and liquid nanospheres\npresent a dipolar resonance inducing a strong peak extinction in the near\nultraviolet, however at different photon energies. This enables a high\ntransmission contrast at selected near ultraviolet photon energies. It is\nestimated that a two-dimensional assembly of 30 nm solid Bi nanospheres with a\nsurface coverage of 32% will almost totally extinct (transmission of 2%) a near\nultraviolet 3.45 eV (359 nm) light beam, whereas upon phase transition the\nresulting liquid Bi nanospheres will show a transmission of 30%. This work\nappeals to the fabrication of locally reconfigurable optical metamaterials for\nintegrated switchable near ultraviolet optics.\n", "  Using the transfer matrix in the angular-momentum space we investigate the\nimpact of trigonal warping on magnetotransport and scaling properties of a\nballistic bilayer graphene in the Corbino geometry. Although the conductivity\nat the charge-neutrality point and zero magnetic field exhibits a one-parameter\nscaling, the shot-noise characteristics, quantified by the Fano factor\n$\\mathcal{F}$ and the third charge-transfer cumulant $\\mathcal{R}$, remain\npseudodiffusive. This shows that the pseudodiffusive transport regime in\nbilayer graphene is not related to the universal value of the conductivity but\ncan be identified by higher charge-transfer cumulants. For Corbino disks with\nlarger radii ratios the conductivity is suppressed by the trigonal warping,\nmainly because the symmetry reduction amplifies backscattering for normal modes\ncorresponding to angular-momentum eigenvalues $\\pm{}2\\hbar$. Weak magnetic\nfields enhance the conductivity, reaching the maximal value near the crossover\nfield $B_L=\\frac{4}{3}\\sqrt{3}\\,({\\hbar}/{e})\\,t't_\\perp\\!\\left[{t_0^2a(R_{\\rm\no}-R_{\\rm i})}\\right]^{-1}$, where $t_0$ ($t_\\perp$) is the nearest-neighbor\nintra- (inter-)layer hopping integral, $t'$ is the skew-interlayer hopping\nintegral, and $R_{\\rm o}$ ($R_{\\rm i}$) is the outer (inner) disk radius. For\nmagnetic fields $B\\gtrsim{}B_L$ we observe quasiperiodic conductance\noscillations characterized by the decreasing mean value\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle-\\sigma_0\\propto{}B_L/B$, where $\\sigma_0=(8/\\pi)\\,e^2/h$.\nThe conductivity, as well as higher charge-transfer cumulants, show beating\npatterns with an envelope period proportional to $\\sqrt{B/B_L}$. This\nconstitutes a qualitative difference between the high-field ($B\\gg{}B_L$)\nmagnetotransport in the $t'=0$ case (earlier discussed in Ref. [1]) and in the\n$t'\\neq{}0$ case, providing a finite-system analog of the Lifshitz transition.\n", "  We consider two twist operators that lead to kappa-Poincare Hopf algebra, the\nfirst being an Abelian one and the second corresponding to a light-like\nkappa-deformation of Poincare algebra. The advantage of the second one is that\nit is expressed solely in terms of Poincare generators. In contrast to this,\nthe Abelian twist goes out of the boundaries of Poincare algebra and runs into\nenvelope of the general linear algebra. Some of the physical applications of\nthese two different twist operators are considered. In particular, we use the\nAbelian twist to construct the statistics flip operator compatible with the\naction of deformed symmetry group. Furthermore, we use the light-like twist\noperator to define a star product and subsequently to formulate a free scalar\nfield theory compatible with kappa-Poincare Hopf algebra and appropriate for\nconsidering the interacting phi^4 scalar field model on kappa-deformed space.\n", "  Exact solutions of a massive complex scalar field equation in the geometry of\na Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (stringy) black hole with magnetic charge is\nexplored. The separated radial and angular parts of the wave equation are\nsolved exactly in the non-extreme case. The angular part is shown to be an\nordinary spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics with a spin-weight depending on the\nmagnetic charge. The radial part is achieved to reduce a confluent Heun\nequation with a multiplier. Finally, based on the solutions, it is shown that\nHawking temperature of the magnetically charged stringy black hole has the same\nvalue as that of the Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  Growth of high-quality single-crystalline InSb layers remains challenging in\nmaterial science. Such layered InSb materials are highly desired for searching\nfor and manipulation of Majorana fermions in solid state, a fundamental\nresearch task in physics today, and for development of novel high-speed\nnanoelectronic and infrared optoelectronic devices. Here we report on a new\nroute towards growth of single-crystalline, layered InSb materials. We\ndemonstrate the successful growth of free-standing, two-dimensional InSb\nnanosheets on one-dimensional InAs nanowires by molecular-beam epitaxy. The\ngrown InSb nanosheets are pure zinc-blende single crystals. The length and\nwidth of the InSb nanosheets are up to several micrometers and the thickness is\ndown to ~10 nm. The InSb nanosheets show a clear ambipolar behavior and a high\nelectron mobility. Our work will open up new technology routes towards the\ndevelopment of InSb-based devices for applications in nanoelectronics,\noptoelectronics and quantum electronics, and for study of fundamental physical\nphenomena.\n", "  We studied the evolution of Wightman correlator in a thermalizing state\nmodeled by AdS_3-Vaidya background. We gave a prescription for calculating\nWightman correlator in coordinate space without using any approximation. For\nequal-time correlator $\\langle O(v,x)O(v,0)\\rangle$, we obtained an enhancement\nfactor $v^2$ due to long range correlation present in the initial state. This\nwas missed by previous studies based on geodesic approximation. We found that\nthe long range correlation in initial state does not lead to significant\nmodification to thermalization time as compared to known results with generic\ninitial state. We also studied spatially integrated Wightman correlator and\nshowed evidence on the distinction between long distance and small momentum\nphysics for an out-of-equilibrium state. We also calculated radiation spectrum\nof particle weakly coupled to $O$ and found lower frequency mode approaches\nthermal spectrum faster than high frequency mode.\n", "  We investigate the ultralow-frequency Raman response of atomically thin ReS2,\na special type of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with unique distorted 1T\nstructure. Bilayer and few-layer ReS2 exhibit rich Raman spectra at frequencies\nbelow 50 cm-1, where a panoply of interlayer shear and breathing modes are\nobserved. The emergence of these interlayer phonon modes indicate that the ReS2\nlayers are coupled and stacked orderly, in contrast to the general belief that\nthe ReS2 layers are decoupled from one another. While the interlayer breathing\nmodes can be described by a linear chain model as in other 2D layered crystals,\nthe shear modes exhibit distinctive behavior due to the in-plane lattice\ndistortion. In particular, the two shear modes in bilayer ReS2 are\nnon-degenerate and well separated in the Raman spectrum, in contrast to the\ndoubly degenerate shear modes in other 2D materials. By carrying out\ncomprehensive first-principles calculations, we can account for the frequency\nand Raman intensity of the interlayer modes, and determine the stacking order\nin bilayer ReS2.\n", "  Path integral molecular dynamics simulations, combined with an ab initio\nevaluation of interactions using electronic structure theory, incorporate the\nquantum mechanical nature of both the electrons and nuclei, which are essential\nto accurately describe systems containing light nuclei. However, path integral\nsimulations have traditionally required a computational cost around two orders\nof magnitude greater than treating the nuclei classically, making them\nprohibitively costly for most applications. Here we show that the cost of path\nintegral simulations can be dramatically reduced by extending our ring polymer\ncontraction approach to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. By using\ndensity functional tight binding as a reference system, we show that our ab\ninitio ring polymer contraction (AI-RPC) scheme gives rapid and systematic\nconvergence to the full path integral density functional theory result. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency of this approach in ab initio simulations of liquid\nwater and the reactive protonated and deprotonated water dimer systems. We find\nthat the vast majority of the nuclear quantum effects are accurately captured\nusing contraction to just the ring polymer centroid, which requires the same\nnumber of density functional theory calculations as a classical simulation.\nCombined with a multiple time step scheme using the same reference system,\nwhich allows the time step to be increased, our implementation is as fast as a\ntypical classical ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and 35$\\times$ faster\nthan a full path integral calculation, while still exactly including the\nquantum sampling of nuclei. This development thus offers a route to routinely\ninclude nuclear quantum effects in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at\nnegligible computational cost.\n", "  We perform global linear stability analysis and idealized numerical\nsimulations in global thermal balance to understand the condensation of cold\ngas from hot/virial atmospheres (coronae), in particular the intracluster\nmedium (ICM). We pay particular attention to geometry (e.g., spherical versus\nplane-parallel) and the nature of the gravitational potential. Global linear\nanalysis gives a similar value for the fastest growing thermal instability\nmodes in spherical and Cartesian geometries. Simulations and observations\nsuggest that cooling in halos critically depends on the ratio of the cooling\ntime to the free-fall time ($t_{cool}/t_{ff}$). Extended cold gas condenses out\nof the ICM only if this ratio is smaller than a threshold value close to 10.\nPrevious works highlighted the difference between the nature of cold gas\ncondensation in spherical and plane-parallel atmospheres; namely, cold gas\ncondensation appeared easier in spherical atmospheres. This apparent difference\ndue to geometry arises because the previous plane-parallel simulations focussed\non {\\em in situ} condensation of multiphase gas but spherical simulations\nstudied condensation {\\em anywhere} in the box. Unlike previous claims, our\nnonlinear simulations show that there are only minor differences in cold gas\ncondensation, either in situ or anywhere, for different geometries. The amount\nof cold gas condensing depends on the shape of the gravitational potential\nwell; gas has more time to condense if gravitational acceleration decreases\ntoward the center. In our idealized simulations with heating balancing cooling\nin each layer, there can be significant mass/energy/momentum transfer across\nlayers that can trigger condensation and drive $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$ far beyond the\ncritical value close to 10. Triggered condensation is very prominent in\nplane-parallel simulations, in which a large amount of cold gas condenses out.\n", "  That superpositions of states can be useful for performing tasks in quantum\nsystems has been known since the early days of quantum information, but only\nrecently has quantitative theory of quantum coherence been proposed. Here we\napply that theory to an analysis of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which depends\non quantum coherence for its operation. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves a\ndecision problem, and we focus on a probabilistic version of that problem,\ncomparing probability of being correct for both classical and quantum\nprocedures. In addition, we study a related decision problem in which the\nquantum procedure has one-sided error while the classical procedure has\ntwo-sided error. The role of coherence on the quantum success probabilities in\nboth of these problems is examined.\n", "  To exploit the full potential of radio measurements of cosmic-ray air showers\nat MHz frequencies, a detector timing synchronization within 1 ns is needed.\nLarge distributed radio detector arrays such as the Auger Engineering Radio\nArray (AERA) rely on timing via the Global Positioning System (GPS) for the\nsynchronization of individual detector station clocks. Unfortunately, GPS\ntiming is expected to have an accuracy no better than about 5 ns. In practice,\nin particular in AERA, the GPS clocks exhibit drifts on the order of tens of\nns. We developed a technique to correct for the GPS drifts, and an independent\nmethod is used for cross-checks that indeed we reach nanosecond-scale timing\naccuracy by this correction. First, we operate a \"beacon transmitter\" which\nemits defined sine waves detected by AERA antennas recorded within the physics\ndata. The relative phasing of these sine waves can be used to correct for GPS\nclock drifts. In addition to this, we observe radio pulses emitted by\ncommercial airplanes, the position of which we determine in real time from\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasts intercepted with a software-defined\nradio. From the known source location and the measured arrival times of the\npulses we determine relative timing offsets between radio detector stations. We\ndemonstrate with a combined analysis that the two methods give a consistent\ntiming calibration with an accuracy of 2 ns or better. Consequently, the beacon\nmethod alone can be used in the future to continuously determine and correct\nfor GPS clock drifts in each individual event measured by AERA.\n", "  We calculate for the first time the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the\ndeuteron, $^3$H, and $^3$He nuclei generated by the one-meson exchange CP-odd\nnuclear force in the standard model. The effective $|\\Delta S| = 1$ four-quark\noperators are matched to the $|\\Delta S| = 1$ standard model processes\ninvolving the CP phase of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix at the\nelectroweak scale and run down to the hadronic scale $\\mu = 1$ GeV according to\nthe renormalization group evolution in the next-to-leading logarithmic order.\nAt the hadronic scale, the hadron matrix elements are modeled in the\nfactorization approach. We then obtain the one-meson (pion, eta meson, and\nkaon) exchange CP-odd nuclear force, which is the combination of the $|\\Delta\nS| = 1$ meson-baryon vertices which issue from the penguin operator and the\nhyperon-nucleon transition. From this CP-odd nuclear force, the nuclear EDM is\ncalculated with the realistic Argonne $v18$ interaction and the CP-odd nuclear\nforce using the Gaussian expansion method. It is found that the EDMs of light\nnuclear systems are of order $O(10^{-31}) e $ cm. We also estimate the standard\nmodel contribution to other hadronic CP violating observables such as the EDMs\nof $^6$Li, $^9$Be nuclei, and the atomic EDMs of $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg,\n$^{211}$Rn, and $^{225}$Ra generated through the nuclear Schiff moment. We then\nanalyze the source of theoretical uncertainties and show some possible ways to\novercome them.\n", "  The study of high-redshift bright quasars is crucial to gather information\nabout the history of galaxy assembly and evolution. Variability analyses can\nprovide useful data on the physics of the quasar processes and their relation\nwith the host galaxy. In this study, we aim at measuring the black hole mass of\nthe bright lensed BAL QSO APM 08279+5255 at $z=3.911$ through reverberation\nmapping, and at updating and extending the monitoring of its C IV absorption\nline variability. Thanks to 138 R-band photometric data and 30 spectra\navailable over 16 years of observations, we perform the first reverberation\nmapping of the Si IV and C IV emission lines for a high-luminosity quasar at\nhigh redshift. We also cross-correlate the C IV absorption equivalent width\nvariations with the continuum light curve, in order to estimate the\nrecombination time lags of the various absorbers and infer the physical\nconditions of the ionised gas. We find a reverberation-mapping time lag of\n$\\sim 900$ rest-frame days for both Si IV and C IV emission lines. This is\nconsistent with an extension of the BLR size-to-luminosity relation for active\ngalactic nuclei up to a luminosity of $\\sim 10^{48}$ erg/s, and implies a black\nhole mass of $10^{10}$ $M_\\odot$. Additionally, we measure a recombination time\nlag of $\\sim 160$ days in the rest frame for the C IV narrow absorption system,\nwhich implies an electron density of the absorbing gas of $\\sim 2.5 \\cdot 10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$. The measured black hole mass of APM 08279+5255 indicates that the\nquasar resides in an under-massive host-galaxy bulge with $M_{bulge} \\sim 7.5\nM_{BH}$, and that the lens magnification is lower than $\\sim 8$. Finally, the\ninferred electron density of the narrow-line absorber implies a distance of the\norder of 10 kpc of the absorbing gas from the quasar, placing it within the\nhost galaxy.\n", "  We study the optimal control problem of maximizing the spread of an\ninformation epidemic on a social network. Information propagation is modeled as\na Susceptible-Infected (SI) process and the campaign budget is fixed. Direct\nrecruitment and word-of-mouth incentives are the two strategies to accelerate\ninformation spreading (controls). We allow for multiple controls depending on\nthe degree of the nodes/individuals. The solution optimally allocates the\nscarce resource over the campaign duration and the degree class groups. We\nstudy the impact of the degree distribution of the network on the controls and\npresent results for Erdos-Renyi and scale free networks. Results show that more\nresource is allocated to high degree nodes in the case of scale free networks\nbut medium degree nodes in the case of Erdos-Renyi networks. We study the\neffects of various model parameters on the optimal strategy and quantify the\nimprovement offered by the optimal strategy over the static and bang-bang\ncontrol strategies. The effect of the time varying spreading rate on the\ncontrols is explored as the interest level of the population in the subject of\nthe campaign may change over time. We show the existence of a solution to the\nformulated optimal control problem, which has non-linear isoperimetric\nconstraints, using novel techniques that is general and can be used in other\nsimilar optimal control problems. This work may be of interest to political,\nsocial awareness, or crowdfunding campaigners and product marketing managers,\nand with some modifications may be used for mitigating biological epidemics.\n", "  In this paper, we prove that there is a weakly universal cellular automaton\non the pentagrid with two states. This paper improves in some sense a previous\nresult with three states. Both results make use of \\textit{\\`a la Moore}\nneighbourhood. However, the result with three states is rotation invariant\nwhile that with two states is not. In both cases, at each step of the\ncomputation, the set of non quiescent states has always infinitely many cycles.\n", "  A new type of dark matter (DM) theories are proposed in the light of the\nstandard model (SM) singlet scalar $\\phi$ which is responsible for the diphoton\nexcess at the LHC Run 2. In the so-called $\\phi$-portal DM models, after taking\ninto account the LHC constraints and DM direct detection limits, we show that\nin the perturbative framework DM as either a SM singlet scalar or Dirac fermion\ncan be allowed in a wide mass range between 400 GeV and 3 TeV. The DM can be\ndirectly detected in SM multi-jets and missing energy.\n", "  A novel interferometric method - SLIVER (Super Localization by Image\ninVERsion interferometry) - is proposed for estimating the separation of two\nincoherent point sources with a mean squared error that does not deteriorate as\nthe sources are brought closer. The essential component of the interferometer\nis an image inversion device that inverts the field in the transverse plane\nabout the optical axis, assumed to pass through the centroid of the sources.\nThe performance of the device is analyzed using the Cram\\'er-Rao bound applied\nto the statistics of spatially-unresolved photon counting using photon\nnumber-resolving and on-off detectors. The analysis is supported by Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of the maximum likelihood estimator for the source separation,\ndemonstrating the superlocalization effect for separations well below that set\nby the Rayleigh criterion. Simulations indicating the robustness of SLIVER to\nmismatch between the optical axis and the centroid are also presented. The\nresults are valid for any imaging system with a circularly symmetric\npoint-spread function.\n", "  Precanonical quantization is based on a generalization of the Hamiltonian\nformalism to field theory, the so-called De Donder-Weyl (DW) theory, which does\nnot require a spacetime splitting and treats the space-time variables on an\nequal footing. Quantum dynamics is described by a precanonical wave function on\nthe finite dimensional space of field coordinates and space-time coordinates,\nwhich satisfies a partial derivative precanonical Schr\\\"odinger equation. The\nstandard QFT in the functional Schr\\\"odinger representation can be derived from\nthe precanonical quantization in a limiting case. An analysis of the\nconstraints within the DW Hamiltonian formulation of the Einstein-Palatini\nvielbein formulation of GR and quantization of the generalized Dirac brackets\ndefined on differential forms lead to the covariant precanonical Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for quantum gravity. The resulting dynamics of quantum gravity is\ndescribed by the wave function or transition amplitudes on the total space of\nthe bundle of spin connections over space-time. Thus, precanonical quantization\nleads to the \"spin connection foam\" picture of quantum geometry represented by\na generally non-Gaussian random field of spin connection coefficients, whose\nprobability distribution is given by the precanonical wave function. The\nnormalizability of precanonical wave functions is argued to lead to the\nquantum-gravitational avoidance of curvature singularities. Possible\nconnections with LQG are briefly discussed.\n", "  The physics of a superconductor subjected to a magnetic field is known to be\nequivalent to neutrino oscillations. Examining the properties of\nsinglet-triplet oscillations in the magnetic field, a sterile neutrino--shown\nto be a Majorana fermion--is suggested to be represented by singlet Cooper\npairs and moderates flavor oscillations between three flavor neutrinos (triplet\nCooper pairs). A superconductor-exchange spring system's rotating magnetization\nprofile is used to simulate the mass-flavor oscillations in the neutrino case\nand the physics of neutrino oscillations are discussed. Symmetry protected\ntriplet components are presented as weak process states. Phases acquired due to\nthe Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov effect produce a complex phase that may be\nresponsible for charge-parity violation in flavor oscillations.\n", "  The presence of mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in exoplanetary systems is a\nnew exciting field of celestial mechanics which motivates us to consider this\nwork to study the dynamical behaviour of exoplanetary systems by time evolution\nof the orbital elements of the planets. Mainly, we study the influence of\nplanetary perturbations on semimajor axis and eccentricity. We identify\n$(r+1):r$ MMR terms in the expression of disturbing function and obtain the\nperturbations from the truncated disturbing function. Using the expansion of\nthe disturbing function of three-body problem and an analytical approach, we\nsolve the equations of motion. The solution which is obtained analytically is\ncompared with that of obtained by numerical method to validate our analytical\nresult. In this work, we consider three exoplanetary systems namely Kepler-62,\nHD 200964 and Kepler-11. We have plotted the evolution of the resonant angles\nand found that they librate around constant value. In view of this, our opinion\nis that two planets of each system Kepler-62, HD 200964 and Kepler-11 are in\n2:1, 4:3 and 5:4 mean motion resonances, respectively.\n  Keywords:astrometry - celestial mechanics - planetary systems.\n", "  We report the timing and spectral properties of Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX\n304-1 by using two Suzaku observations during its 2010 August and 2012 January\nX-ray outbursts. Pulsations at ~275 s were clearly detected in the light curves\nfrom both the observations. Pulse profiles were found to be strongly\nenergy-dependent. During 2010 observation, prominent dips seen in soft X-ray\n($\\leq$10 keV) pulse profiles were found to be absent at higher energies.\nHowever, during 2012 observation, the pulse profiles were complex due to the\npresence of several dips. Significant changes in the shape of the pulse\nprofiles were detected at high energies ($>$35 keV). A phase shift of $\\sim$0.3\nwas detected while comparing the phase of main dip in pulse profiles below and\nabove $\\sim$35 keV. Broad-band energy spectrum of pulsar was well described by\na partially absorbed Negative and Positive power-law with Exponential cutoff\n(NPEX) model with 6.4 keV iron line and a cyclotron absorption feature. Energy\nof cyclotron absorption line was found to be $\\sim$53 and 50 keV for 2010 and\n2012 observations, respectively, indicating a marginal positive dependence on\nsource luminosity. Based on the results obtained from phase-resolved\nspectroscopy, the absorption dips in the pulse profiles can be interpreted as\ndue to the presence of additional matter at same phases. Observed positive\ncorrelation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity, and significant\npulse-phase variation of cyclotron parameters are discussed in the perspective\nof theoretical models on cyclotron absorption line in X-ray pulsars.\n", "  In its decade of operation the Cassini mission has allowed us to look deep\ninto Saturn's atmosphere and investigate the processes occurring below its\nenshrouding haze. We use Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS)\n4.6-5.2 micron data from early in the mission to investigate the location and\nproperties of Saturn's cloud structure between 0.6 and 5 bars. We average\nnightside spectra from 2006 over latitude circles and model the spectral limb\ndarkening using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and retrieval tool. We present\nour best-fit deep cloud model for latitudes between -40 and 50 degrees, along\nwith retrieved abundances for NH3, PH3 and AsH3. We find an increase in NH3\nabundance at the equator, a cloud base at ~2.3 bar and no evidence for cloud\nparticles with strong absorption features in the 4.6-5.2 micron wavelength\nrange, all of which are consistent with previous work. Non-scattering cloud\nmodels assuming a composition of either NH3 or NH4SH, with a scattering haze\noverlying, fit limb darkening curves and spectra at all latitudes well; the\nretrieved optical depth for the tropospheric haze is decreased in the northern\n(winter) hemisphere, implying that the haze has a photochemical origin. Our\nability to test this hypothesis by examining spectra at different seasons is\nrestricted by the varying geometry of VIMS observations over the life of the\nmission, and the appearance of the Saturn storm towards the end of 2010.\n", "  Viscous and gravitational fingering refer to flow instabilities in porous\nmedia that are triggered by adverse mobility or density ratios, respectively.\nThese instabilities have been studied extensively in the past for 1)\nsingle-phase flow (e.g., contaminant transport in groundwater,\nfirst-contact-miscible displacement of oil by gas in hydrocarbon production),\nand 2) multi-phase immiscible and incompressible flow (e.g.,\nwater-alternating-gas (WAG) injection in oil reservoirs). Fingering in\nmultiphase compositional and compressible flow has received much less\nattention, perhaps due to its high computational complexity. However, many\nimportant subsurface processes involve multiple phases that exchange species.\nExamples are carbon sequestration in saline aquifers and enhanced oil recovery\n(EOR) by gas or WAG injection below the minimum miscibility pressure. In\nmultiphase flow, relative permeabilities affect the mobility contrast for a\ngiven viscosity ratio. Phase behavior can also change local fluid properties,\nwhich can either enhance or mitigate viscous and gravitational instabilities.\nThis work presents a detailed study of fingering behavior in compositional\nmultiphase flow in two and three dimensions and considers the effects of 1)\nFickian diffusion, 2) mechanical dispersion, 3) flow rates, 4) domain size and\ngeometry, 5) formation heterogeneities, 6) gravity, and 7) relative\npermeabilities. Results show that fingering in compositional multiphase flow is\nprofoundly different from miscible conditions and upscaling techniques used for\nthe latter case are unlikely to be generalizable to the former.\n", "  Coupled length and time scales determine the dynamic behavior of polymers and\nunderlie their unique viscoelastic properties. To resolve the long-time\ndynamics it is imperative to determine which time and length scales must be\ncorrectly modeled. Here we probe the degree of coarse graining required to\nsimultaneously retain significant atomistic details and access large length and\ntime scales. The degree of coarse graining in turn sets the minimum length\nscale instrumental in defining polymer properties and dynamics. Using linear\npolyethylene as a model system, we probe how coarse graining scale affects the\nmeasured dynamics. Iterative Boltzmann inversion is used to derive\ncoarse-grained potentials with 2-6 methylene groups per coarse-grained bead\nfrom a fully atomistic melt simulation. We show that atomistic detail is\ncritical to capturing large scale dynamics. Using these models we simulate\npolyethylene melts for times over 500 {\\mu}s to study the viscoelastic\nproperties of well-entangled polymer chains.\n", "  Dynamic control of conductivity and optical properties via atomic structure\nchanges is of tremendous technological importance in information storage.\nEnergy consumption considerations provide a driving force toward employing thin\nmaterials in devices. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are nearly\natomically-thin materials that can exist in multiple crystal structures, each\nwith distinct electrical properties. Using density functional approaches, we\ndiscover that electrostatic gating device configurations have the potential to\ndrive structural semiconductor-to-semimetal phase transitions in some monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. For the first time, we show that the\ndynamical control of this phase transition can be achieved in carefully\ndesigned electronic devices. We discover that the semiconductor-to-semimetal\nphase transition in monolayer MoTe2 can be driven by a gate voltage of several\nVolts with appropriate choice of dielectric. Structural transitions in\nmonolayer TaSe2 are predicted to occur under similar conditions. While the\nrequired field magnitudes are large for these two materials, we find that the\ngate voltage for the transition can be reduced arbitrarily by alloying, e.g.\nfor MoxW1-xTe2 monolayers. We have developed a method for computing phase\ndiagrams of monolayer materials with respect to charge and voltage, validated\nby comparing to direct calculations and experimental measurements. Our findings\nidentify a new physical mechanism, not existing in bulk materials, to\ndynamically control structural phase transitions in two-dimensional materials,\nenabling potential applications in phase-change electronic devices.\n", "  We investigate the emergence of subdiffusive transport by obstruction in\ncontinuum models for molecular crowding. While the underlying percolation\ntransition for the accessible space displays universal behavior, the dynamic\nproperties depend in a subtle non-universal way on the transport through narrow\nchannels. At the same time, the different universality classes are robust with\nrespect to introducing correlations in the obstacle matrix as we demonstrate\nfor quenched hard-sphere liquids as underlying structures. Our results confirm\nthat the microscopic dynamics can dominate the relaxational behavior even at\nlong times, in striking contrast to glassy dynamics.\n", "  We review aspects of our formalism for differential geometry on\nnoncommutative and nonassociative spaces which arise from cochain twist\ndeformation quantization of manifolds. We work in the simplest setting of\ntrivial vector bundles and flush out the details of our approach providing\nexplicit expressions for all bimodule operations, and for connections and\ncurvature. As applications, we describe the constructions of physically viable\naction functionals for Yang-Mills theory and Einstein-Cartan gravity on\nnoncommutative and nonassociative spaces, as first steps towards more elaborate\nmodels relevant to non-geometric flux deformations of geometry in closed string\ntheory.\n", "  We present a weak lensing study of the galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 at\n$z=1.75$, which is the highest redshift strong lensing cluster known and the\nmost distant cluster for which a weak lensing analysis has been undertaken.\nUsing F160W, F814W, and F606W observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, we\ndetect tangential shear at $2\\sigma$ significance. Fitting a\nNavarro-Frenk-White mass profile to the shear with a theoretical median\nmass-concentration relation, we derive a mass\n$M_{200,\\mathrm{crit}}=2.3^{+2.1}_{-1.4}\\times10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$. This mass\nis consistent with previous mass estimates from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect, X-ray, and strong lensing. The cluster lies on the local SZ-weak\nlensing mass scaling relation observed at low redshift, indicative of minimal\nevolution in this relation.\n", "  We investigate the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect for time-dependent\ngauge fields. We prove that the non-Abelian AB phase shift related to\ntime-dependent gauge fields, in which the electric and magnetic fields are\nwritten in the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ generators, vanishes up to the\nfirst order expansion of the phase factor. Therefore, the flux quantization in\na superconductor ring does not appear in the time-dependent Abelian or\nnon-Abelian AB effect.\n", "  Microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) provides a way to build large\nground based sub-mm instruments such as NIKA and A-MKID. For such instruments,\ntherefore, it is important to understand and characterize the response to\nensure good linearity and calibration over wide dynamic range. We propose to\nuse the MKID readout frequency response to determine the MKID responsivity to\nan input optical source power. A signal can be measured in a KID as a change in\nthe phase of the readout signal with respect to the KID resonant circle.\nFundamentally, this phase change is due to a shift in the KID resonance\nfrequency, in turn due to a radiation induced change in the quasiparticle\nnumber in the superconducting resonator. We show that shift in resonant\nfrequency can be determined from the phase shift by using KID phase versus\nfrequency dependence using a previously measured resonant frequency. Working in\nthis calculated resonant frequency, we gain near linearity and constant\ncalibration to a constant optical signal applied in a wide range of operating\npoints on the resonance and readout powers. This calibration method has three\nparticular advantages: first, it is fast enough to be used to calibrate large\narrays, with pixel counts in the thousand of pixels; second, it is based on\ndata that are already necessary to determine KID positions; third, it can be\ndone without applying any optical source in front of the array.\n", "  We present quantum algorithms to realize geometric transformations (two-point\nswappings, symmetric flips, local flips, orthogonal rotations, and\ntranslations) based on an $n$-qubit normal arbitrary superposition state\n(NASS). These transformations are implemented using quantum circuits consisting\nof basic quantum gates, which are constructed with polynomial numbers of\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit gates. Complexity analysis shows that the global\noperators (symmetric flips, local flips, orthogonal rotations) can be\nimplemented with $O(n)$ gates. The proposed geometric transformations are used\nto facilitate applications of quantum images with low complexity.\n", "  Recently, the complete action for an N=1 pure supergravity action in 4\ndimensions that allows a positive, negative or zero cosmological constant has\nbeen constructed. The action is the generalization of a Volkov-Akulov action\nfor the Goldstino coupled to supergravity. The construction uses a nilpotent\nmultiplet.\n  This paper is written in honour of Philippe Spindel. AVP enjoyed\ncollaborations and many interactions with Philippe, who has always appreciated\nvery precise derivations. We use this occasion to give a very detailed account\nof the calculations that lead to the published results. We review aspects of\nsupersymmetry with de Sitter backgrounds, the treatment of auxiliary fields,\nand other ingredients in the construction.\n", "  It is well established that many galaxies, like our Milky Way, exhibit spiral\npatterns. The entire galactic disc rotates about the galactic centre with\ndifferent speeds; higher closer to the centre, lower at greater distances -\nthat is, galactic discs do not rotate like a solid compact disc. The spiral\narms are the part of the galactic disc where many young stars are being born.\nSince young stars are also brightest, we can see the spiral structure of other\ngalaxies from afar. Typically spiral galaxies are copiously observed at\nredshifts z ~ 1. The recently observed grand-design galaxy Q2343-BX442 at\nz=2.18, however, implies uncertain origin of its spiral structure. Indeed such\n\"old\" galaxies usually look rather clumpy because of their dynamically hot\ndiscs. In this report, based on self-similarity, we argue that spiral\nstructures may also appear in heavy-ion collisions as messengers of phase\ntransitions. Thus, spiral structures in galactic patterns may be traced back to\na few microseconds after the Big Bang.\n", "  We consider deformations of the $SU(3)$ Affine Toda theory (AT) and\ninvestigate the integrability properties of the deformed theories. We find that\nfor some special deformations all conserved quantities change to being\nconserved only asymptotically, {\\it i.e.} in the process of the scattering of\ntwo solitons these charges do vary in time, but they return, after the\nscattering, to the values they had prior to the scattering. This phenomenon,\nwhich we have called quasi-integrability, is related to special properties of\nthe two-soliton solutions under space-time parity transformations. Some\nproperties of the AT solitons are discussed, especially those involving\ninteresting static multi-soliton solutions. We support our analytical studies\nwith detailed numerical ones in which the time evolution has been simulated by\nthe 4th order Runge-Kutta method. We find that for some perturbations the\nsolitons repel and for the others they form a quasi-bound state. When we send\nsolitons towards each other they can repel when they come close together with\nor without `flipping' the fields of the model. The solitons radiate very little\nand appear to be stable. These results support the ideas of\nquasi-integrability, {\\it i.e.} that many effects of integrability also\napproximately hold for the deformed models.\n", "  General properties of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation which is widely\nused in quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry are considered. Merits and\ndemerits of the original Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation method are analyzed.\nWhile this method does not satisfy the Eriksen condition of the\nFoldy-Wouthuysen transformation, it can be corrected with the use of the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We show a possibility of such a correction\nand propose an appropriate algorithm of calculations. An applicability of the\ncorrected Foldy-Wouthuysen method is restricted by the condition of convergence\nof a series of relativistic corrections.\n", "  Turbulence theory is usually concerned with the statistical moments of the\nvelocity or its fluctuations. One could also analyze the implicit probability\ndistributions. This is the purview of information theory. Here we use\ninformation theory, specifically the conditional entropy, to analyze (quasi-)2D\nturbulence. We recast Richardson's \"eddy hypothesis\" that large eddies break up\ninto small eddies in time in the language of information theory. In addition to\nconfirming Richardson's idea, we find that self-similarity and turbulent length\nscales reappear naturally. Not surprisingly, we also find that the direction of\ninformation transfer is the same as the direction of the cascade itself.\nConsequently, intermittency may be considered a necessary companion to all\nturbulent flows.\n", "  One of the major computational bottlenecks in one-body reduced density matrix\n(1RDM) functional theory is the evaluation of approximate 1RDM functionals and\ntheir derivatives. The reason is that more advanced approximate functionals are\nalmost exclusively defined in the natural orbital basis, so a 4-index\ntransformation of the two-electron integrals appears to be unavoidable. I will\nshow that this is not the case and that so-called separable functionals can be\nevaluated much more efficiently, i.e. only at cubic cost in the basis size.\nSince most approximate functionals are actually separable, this new algorithm\nis an important development to make 1RDM functional theory calculations\nfeasible for large electronic systems.\n", "  By methods of numerical simulations the dynamics of interaction of radially\nsymmetric Bellavin-Polyakov type topological vortex in (2+1)-dimensional O(3)\nnonlinear sigma model is investigated. Obtained numerically the model of\ntopological vortex decay for different values of radius of ring-shaped\nstructure of their energy density onto the localized perturbations, where the\nsum of Hopf index is preserved. It is shown that the stability of topological\nsolitons, in particularly, depends on the values of radius of ring-shaped\nstructure of their energy density.\n", "  We consider classical gauge theory on a principal bundle P->X in a case of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking characterized by the reduction of a structure\ngroup G of P->X to its closed subgroup H. This reduction is ensured by the\nexistence of global sections of the quotient bundle P/H->X treated as classical\nHiggs fields. Matter fields with an exact symmetry group H in such gauge theory\nare considered in the pairs with Higgs fields, and they are represented by\nsections of a composite bundle Y->P/H->X, where Y->P/H is a fiber bundle\nassociated to a principal bundle P->P/H with a structure group H. A key point\nis that a composite bundle Y->X is proved to be associated to a principal\nG-bundle P->X. Therefore, though matter fields possess an exact symmetry group\nH, their gauge G-invariant theory in the presence of Higgs fields can be\ndeveloped. Its gauge invariant Lagrangian factorizes through the vertical\ncovariant differential determined by a connection on a principal H-bundle\nP->P/H. In a case of the Cartan decomposition of a Lie algebra of G, this\nconnection can be expressed in terms of a connection on a principal bundle\nP->X, i.e., gauge potentials for a group of broken symmetries G.\n", "  Mergers of compact objects are considered prime sources of gravitational\nwaves (GW) and will soon be targets of GW observatories such as the\nAdvanced-LIGO, VIRGO etc. Finding electromagnetic counterparts of these GW\nsources will be important to understand their nature. We discuss possible\nelectromagnetic signatures of the mergers. We show that the BH-BH mergers could\nhave luminosities which exceed Eddington luminosity from unity to several\norders of magnitude depending on the masses of the merging BHs. As a result\nthese mergers could be explosive, release up to $10^{51}$ erg of energy and\nshine as radio transients. At any given time we expect about a few such\ntransients in the sky at GHz frequencies which could be detected out to about\n300 Mpc. It has also been argued that these radio transients would look alike\nradio supernovae with comparable detection rates. Multi-band follow up could,\nhowever, distinguish between the mergers and supernovae.\n", "  Exact eigenstates of the parallel coupled double quantum dots attached to the\nnon-interacting leads taken in zero-bandwidth limit are analytically obtained\nin each particle and spin sector. The ground state of the half-filled system is\nidentified from a four dimensional subspace of the twenty dimensional Hilbert\nspace for different values of tunable parameters of the system viz. the energy\nlevels of the quantum dots, the interdot tunneling matrix-element, the ondot\nand interdot Coulomb interactions and quantities like spin-spin correlation\nbetween the dots, occupancies of the dots are calculated. In the parameter\nspace of the interdot tunneling matrix-element and ondot Coulomb interaction,\nthe dots exhibit both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlation. There is\na critical dependency of the interdot tunneling matrix-element on the ondot\nCoulomb interaction which leads to transition from the ferromagnetic\ncorrelation to the antiferromagnetic correlation as the interdot tunneling\nmatrix-element is increased. The ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations also exist in the absence of interdot tunneling matrix-element\nthrough indirect exchange via the leads. The interdot Coulomb interaction is\nfound to affect this dependency considerably.\n", "  We experimentally investigate an optical frequency standard based on the\n$^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\\to {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole (\\textit{E}3)\ntransition of a single trapped $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ion. For the spectroscopy of this\nstrongly forbidden transition, we utilize a Ramsey-type excitation scheme that\nprovides immunity to probe-induced frequency shifts. The cancellation of these\nshifts is controlled by interleaved single-pulse Rabi spectroscopy which\nreduces the related relative frequency uncertainty to $1.1\\times 10^{-18}$. To\ndetermine the frequency shift due to thermal radiation emitted by the ion's\nenvironment, we measure the static scalar differential polarizability of the\n\\textit{E}3 transition as $0.888(16)\\times 10^{-40}$ J m$^2$/V$^2$ and a\ndynamic correction $\\eta(300~\\text{K})=-0.0015(7)$. This reduces the\nuncertainty due to thermal radiation to $1.8\\times 10^{-18}$. The residual\nmotion of the ion yields the largest contribution $(2.1\\times 10^{-18})$ to the\ntotal systematic relative uncertainty of the clock of $3.2\\times 10^{-18}$.\n", "  We present ten new radio continuum (RC) detections at catalogued planetary\nnebula (PN) positions in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC): SMPS6, LIN 41, LIN\n142, SMP S13, SMP S14, SMP S16, J18, SMP S18, SMP S19 and SMP S22.\nAdditionally, six SMC radio PNe previously detected, LIN 45, SMP S11, SMPS17,\nLIN321, LIN339 and SMPS24 are also investigated (re-observed) here making up a\npopulation of 16 radio detections of catalogued PNe in the SMC. These 16 radio\ndetections represent ~15 % of the total catalogued PN population in the SMC. We\nshow that six of these objects have characteristics that suggest that they are\nPN mimics: LIN 41, LIN 45, SMP S11, LIN 142, LIN 321 and LIN 339. We also\npresent our results for the surface brightness - PN radius relation\n({\\Sigma}-D) of the SMC radio PN population. These are consistent with previous\nSMC and LMC PN measurements of the ({\\Sigma}-D) relation.\n", "  The exploration of the fundamental structure of strongly interacting matter\nhas always thrived on the complementarity of lepton scattering and purely\nhadronic probes. As the community eagerly anticipates a future electron ion\ncollider (EIC) in the U.S., an outstanding scientific opportunity remains to\ncomplete \"must-do\" measurements in p+p and p+A physics in the years preceding\nthe EIC. As we describe in this document, these measurements will be essential\nto fully realize the scientific promise of the EIC by provid-ing a\ncomprehensive set of measurements in hadronic collisions that, when combined\nwith data from the EIC, will establish the validity and limits of factorization\nand universality. The outlined program will on the one hand lay the groundwork\nfor the EIC, both scientifically and in terms of refining the experimental\nrequirements for the physics program at the EIC, and thus be the natural next\nstep on the path towards an electron-ion collider. On the other hand, while\nmuch of the physics in this program is unique to proton-proton and\nproton-nucleus collisions and offers discovery potential on its own, when\ncombined with data from the EIC it will provide a broad foundation to a deeper\nunderstanding of fundamental QCD.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional Ising strip bounded by two planar, inhomogeneous\nwalls. The inhomogeneity of each wall is modeled by a magnetic field acting on\nsurface spins. It is equal to $+h_1$ except for a group of $N_1$ sites where it\nis equal to $-h_1$. The inhomogeneities of the upper and lower wall are shifted\nwith respect to each other by a lateral distance $L$. Using exact\ndiagonalization of the transfer matrix, we study both the lateral and normal\ncritical Casimir forces as well as magnetization profiles for a wide range of\ntemperatures and system parameters. The lateral critical Casimir force tends to\nreduce the shift between the inhomogeneities, and the excess normal force is\nattractive. Upon increasing the shift $L$ we observe, depending on the\ntemperature, three different scenarios of breaking of the capillary bridge of\nnegative magnetization connecting the inhomogeneities of the walls across the\nstrip. As long as there exists a capillary bridge in the system, the magnitude\nof the excess total critical Casimir force is almost constant, with its\ndirection depending on $L$. By investigating the bridge morphologies we have\nfound a relation between the point at which the bridge breaks and the\ninflection point of the force. We provide a simple argument that some of the\nproperties reported here should also hold for a whole range of different models\nof the strip with the same type of inhomogeneity.\n", "  We investigate the pressure dependence of the upper critical fields\n({\\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$) for FeSe single crystals with pressure up to 2.57 GPa.\nThe superconducting (SC) properties show a disparate behavior across a critical\npressure where the pressure-induced antiferromagnetic phase coexists with\nsuperconductivity. The magnetoresistance for $H//ab$ and $H//c$ is very\ndifferent: for $H//c$, magnetic field induces and enhances a hump in the\nresistivity close to the $T_c$ for pressures higher than 1.2 GPa, while it is\nabsent for $H//ab$. Since the measured {\\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$ for FeSe samples is\nsmaller than the orbital limited upper critical field ($H$$^{orb}$$_{c2}$)\nestimated by the Werthamer Helfand and Hohenberg (WHH) model, the Maki\nparameter ({\\alpha}) related to Pauli spin-paramagnetic effects is additionally\nconsidered to describe the temperature dependence of {\\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$($T$).\nInterestingly, the {\\alpha} value is hardly affected by pressure for $H//ab$,\nwhile it strongly increases with pressure for $H//c$. The pressure evolution of\nthe {\\mu}$_0$$H$$_{c2}$(0)s for the FeSe single crystals is found to be almost\nsimilar to that of $T_c$($P$), suggesting that the pressure-induced magnetic\norder adversely affects the upper critical fields as well as the SC transition\ntemperature.\n", "  Three phases are typically observed during solar flares: the preflare,\nimpulsive, and decay phases. During the impulsive phase, it is believed that\nthe electrons and other particles are accelerated after the stored energy in\nthe magnetic field is released by reconnection. The impulsivity of a solar\nflare is a quantifiable property that shows how quickly this initial energy\nrelease occurs. It is measured via the impulsivity parameter, which we define\nas the inverse of the overall duration of the impulsive phase. We take the\nlatter as the raw width of the most prominent nonthermal emission of the flare.\nWe computed this observable over a work sample of 48 M-class events that\noccurred during the current Solar Cycle 24 by using three different methods.\nThe first method takes into account all of the nonthermal flare emission and\ngives very accurate results, while the other two just cover fixed energy\nintervals (30-40 keV and 25-50 keV) and are useful for fast calculations. We\npropose an alternative way to classify solar flares according to their\nimpulsivity parameter values, defining three different types of impulsivity,\nnamely, high, medium, and low. This system of classification is independent of\nthe manner used to calculated the impulsivity parameter. Lastly, we show the\nrelevance of this tool as a discriminator of different HXR generation\nprocesses.\n", "  We present an update of our lattice QCD study of the vacuum polarization\nfunction using O$(a)$-improved $N_ {\\rm f} =2$ Wilson fermions with increased\nstatistics and a large set of momenta. The resulting points are highly\ncorrelated and thus require a correlated fitting procedure. We employ an\nextended frequentist method to estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the\nmomentum dependence and to the continuum and chiral extrapolations. We present\npreliminary results of the leading order hadronic contribution of the anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the muon $\\left(a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{HLO}}\\right)$ at the physical\npoint for $u,d,s$ and $c$ valence quarks.\n", "  Strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in graphene grown on tungsten disulfide\n(WS2) has been recently observed, leading to energy gap opening by SOI. Energy\ngap in graphene may also be induced by sublattice symmetry breaking (SSB) where\nenergy level in A-sublattice is not equal to that in B-sublattice. SSB-gap may\nbe produced by growing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride or silicon carbide.\nIn this work, we investigate transport property in a SOI/SSB/SOI gapped\ngraphene junction, focusing the effect of interplay of SOI and SSB. We find\nthat, lattice-pseudospin polarization (L-PSP) can be controlled perfectly from\n+100% to -100% by gate voltage. This is due to the fact that in graphene grown\non WS2, the carriers carry lattice-pseudo spin degree of freedom \"up and down\".\nThe SSB-gapped graphene exhibits pseudo-ferromagnetism to play the role of\nlattice-pseudospin filtering barrier. It is also found that the SOI and\nSSB-gaps in graphene may be measured by characteristic of L-PSP in the\njunction. The proposed controllable-lattice-pseudospin currents may be\napplicable for graphene-based pseudospintronics.\n", "  We propose a new constraint on millicharged dark matter from considerations\non galaxy clusters. The charged dark matter moves under the influence of the\nrandomly oriented magnetic fields in galaxy clusters, and the corresponding\ndark matter density profile can significantly differ from the concordance CDM\npredictions which are well supported from the galaxy cluster observations. With\na typical amplitude of magnetic fields $B=\\mathcal O(1)\\,\\mu$G and dark matter\nvelocity $v=\\mathcal O(100)\\,$km/sec at a cluster radius $R\\simeq 1\\,$Mpc, we\nclaim that the charge $\\epsilon e$ ($e$ is the elementary charge) of dark\nmatter with mass $m$ should be bounded as $\\epsilon \\lesssim 10^{-14}(m/{\\rm\nGeV})$ which is substantially tighter than the other previous constraints.\n", "  Recently, S. Aggarwal et al. [Chin. Phys. B 24 (2015) 053201] reported energy\nlevels, radiative rates and lifetimes for the lowest 148 levels belonging to\nthe 3s$^2$3p, 3s3p$^2$, 3s$^2$3d, 3s3p3d, 3p$^3$, 3p$^2$3d, 3s3d$^2$, 3p3d$^2$,\nand 3d$^3$ configurations of Al-like tungsten. While their calculated energies\nfor the levels and the radiative rates for transitions are correct, the\nreported results for lifetimes are completely wrong. According to our\ncalculations, errors in their reported lifetimes are up to 14 orders of\nmagnitude for over 90\\% of the levels. Here we report the correct lifetimes and\nexplain the reasons for discrepancies.\n", "  Calculations of energy levels, radiative rates and lifetimes are reported for\neight ions of tungsten, i.e. S-like (W LIX) to F-like (W LXVI). A large number\nof levels has been considered for each ion and extensive configuration\ninteraction has been included among a range of configurations. For the\ncalculations, the general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package (GRASP)\nhas been adopted, and radiative rates (as well as oscillator strengths and line\nstrengths) are listed for all E1, E2, M1, and M2 transitions of the ions.\nComparisons have been made with earlier available experimental and theoretical\nenergies, although these are limited to only a few levels for most ions.\nTherefore for additional accuracy assessments, particularly for energy levels,\nanalogous calculations have been performed with the flexible atomic code (FAC).\n", "  In his 1916 ground-breaking general relativity paper Einstein had imposed a\nrestrictive coordinate condition, his field equations were valid for coordinate\nsystems which are unimodular. Later, Einstein published a paper on\ngravitational waves. The solution presented in this paper did not satisfy the\nabove restrictive condition. In his gravitational waves paper, Einstein\nconcluded that gravitational fields propagate at the speed of light. The\nsolution is the Minkowski flat metric plus a small disturbance propagating in a\nflat spacetime. Einstein calculated the small deviation from Minkowski metric\nin a manner analogous to that of retarded potentials in electrodynamics.\nHowever, in obtaining the above derivation, Einstein made a mathematical error.\nThis error caused him to obtain three different types of waves compatible with\nhis approximate field equations: longitudinal waves, transverse waves and a new\ntype of wave. Einstein added an Addendum in which he suggested that in systems\nin unimodular coordinates only waves of the third type occur and these waves\ntransport energy. He became obsessed with his unimodular coordinates.\nEinstein's colleagues demonstrated to him that in the coordinate system in\nunimodular coordinates the gravitational wave of a mass point carry no energy,\nbut Einstein tried to persuade them that he had actually not made a mistake in\nhis gravitational waves paper. Einstein, however, eventually accepted his\ncolleagues results and dropped the restrictive unimodular coordinates. This\nfinally led him to discover plane transverse gravitational waves.\n", "  A mathematical model for computation of the fluid pressure in a reservoir\ndrained by a horizontal multiple fractured well is proposed. The model is\napplicable for an arbitrary network of fractures with different finite\nconductivities of each segment, for variable in space and time physical\nparameters of the reservoir and for different field development plans. The\nvariational formulation of the model allows effective numerical simulation\nusing the finite element method. Case studies demonstrate how the main flow\ncharacteristics (well productivity, pressure distribution) depend on the\ngeometrical and physical characteristics of the reservoir and of the fracture\nnetwork. The presented model is suitable for estimation of the productivity of\na multiple fractured well and as an optimization tool for efficient reservoir\ndevelopment.\n", "  Atomically thin semi-conductors are characterized by strongly bound excitons\nwhich govern the optical properties of the materials below and near the band\nedge. Efficient conversion of photons into electrical current requires, as a\nfirst step, the dissociation of the exciton into free electrons and holes. Here\nwe calculate the dissociation rates of excitons in monolayer MoS$_2$ as a\nfunction of an applied in-plane electric field. The dissociation rates are\nobtained as the inverse lifetime of the resonant states of a two-dimensional\nHydrogenic Hamiltonian which describes the exciton within the Mott-Wannier\nmodel. The resonances are computed using complex scaling, and the effective\nmasses and screened electron-hole interaction defining the Hydrogenic\nHamiltonian are computed from first-principles. For field strengths above 0.1\nV/nm the dissociation lifetime is shorter than 1 picosecond, which is shorter\nthan the lifetime of other, competing, decay mechanisms. Interestingly,\nencapsulation of the \\moly layer in just two layers of hBN, enhances the\ndissociation rate by around one order of magnitude due to the increased\nscreening showing that dielectric engineering is an effective way to control\nexciton lifetimes in two-dimensional materials.\n", "  We report a study of the relaxation time of the restoration of the resistive\nsuperconducting state in single crystalline boron-doped diamond using\namplitude-modulated absorption of (sub-)THz radiation (AMAR). The films grown\non an insulating diamond substrate have a low carrier density of about\n2.5x10^{21} cm^{-3} and a critical temperature of about 2 K. By changing the\nmodulation frequency we find a high-frequency rolloff which we associate with\nthe characterstic time of energy relaxation between the electron and the phonon\nsystems or the relaxation time for nonequilibrium superconductivity. Our main\nresult is that the electron-phonon scattering time varies clearly as T^{-2},\nover the accessible temperature range of 1.7 to 2.2 K. In addition, we find,\nupon approaching the critical temperature T_c, evidence for an increasing\nrelaxation time on both sides of T_c.\n", "  We give an overview of results on critical phenomena in 4 dimensions,\nobtained recently using a rigorous renormalisation group method. In particular,\nfor the $n$-component $|\\varphi|^4$ spin model in dimension 4, with small\ncoupling constant, we prove that the susceptibility diverges with a logarithmic\ncorrection to the mean-field behaviour with exponent $(n+2)/(n+8)$. This result\nextends rigorously to $n=0$, interpreted as a supersymmetric version of the\nmodel that represents exactly the continuous-time weakly self-avoiding walk. We\nalso analyse the critical two-point function of the weakly self-avoiding walk,\nthe specific heat and pressure of the $|\\varphi|^4$ model, as well as scaling\nlimits of the spin field close to the critical point.\n", "  An exact rotating anisotropic fluid solution and a family of exact rotating\nanisotropic fluid solutions are presented which satisfy all energy conditions\nfor certain values of their parameters. The components of the Ricci tensor the\neigenvalues of this tensor and the energy-momentum tensor of the solutions are\ngiven explicitly. All have the ring singularity of Kerr's solution and in\naddition the solution one more singularity and some solutions of the family\nadditional singularities.The solution matches to the extremal solution of Kerr\non two surfaces, which are thin shells and for proper values of the parameters\nof the solution approximate oblate spheroids. One of these surfaces has\npositive surface density. The solutions of the family satisfy the matching\nconditions with the solution of Kerr on two pair of surfaces, which are again\nthin shells. The surface density of one pair of surfaces is given explicitly.\nAlso for proper values of the parameters of the solutions the surfaces of the\nother pair approximate oblate spheroids.\n", "  Young stellar objects (YSOs) may not accumulate their mass steadily, as was\npreviously thought, but in a series of violent events manifesting themselves as\nsharp stellar brightening. These events can be caused by fragmentation due to\ngravitational instabilities in massive gaseous disks surrounding young stars,\nfollowed by migration of dense gaseous clumps onto the star. We report our high\nangular resolution, coronagraphic near-infrared polarization imaging\nobservations using the High Contrast Instrument for the Subaru Next Generation\nAdaptive Optics (HiCIAO) of the Subaru 8.2 m Telescope, towards four YSOs which\nare undergoing luminous accretion outbursts. The obtained infrared images have\nverified the presence of several hundred AUs scale arms and arcs surrounding\nthese YSOs. In addition, our hydrodynamics simulations and radiative transfer\nmodels further demonstrate that these observed structures can indeed be\nexplained by strong gravitational instabilities occurring at the beginning of\nthe disk formation phase. The effect of those tempestuous episodes of disk\nevolution on star and planet formation remains to be understood.\n", "  In this paper, a 3D conjugated heat transfer model for Nano-Encapsulated\nPhase Change Materials (NEPCMs) cooled Micro Pin Fin Heat Sink (MPFHS) is\npresented. The governing equations of flow and heat transfer are solved using a\nfinite volume method based on collocated grid and the results are validated\nwith the available data reported in the literature. The effect of nanoparticles\nvolume fraction (C = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3), inlet velocity (Vin = 0.015, 0.030, 0.045\nm/s), and bottom wall temperature (Twall = 299.15, 303.15, 315.15, 350.15 K)\nare studied on Nusselt and Euler numbers as well as temperature contours in the\nsystem. The results indicate that significant heat transfer enhancement is\nachieved when using NEPCM slurry as an advanced coolant. The maximum Nusselt\nnumber when NEPCM slurry (C = 0.3) with Vin = 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 (m/s) is\nemployed, are 2.27, 1.81, 1.56 times higher than the ones with base fluid,\nrespectively. However, with increasing bottom wall temperature, the Nusselt\nnumber first increases then decreases. The former is due to higher heat\ntransfer capability of coolant at temperatures over the melting range of PCM\nparticles due to partial melting of nanoparticles in this range. While, the\nlatter phenomena is due to the lower capability of NEPCM particles and\nconsequently coolant in absorbing heat at coolant temperatures higher than the\ntemperature correspond to fully melted NEPCM. It was observed that NEPCM slurry\nhas a drastic effect on Euler number, and with increasing volume fraction and\ndecreasing inlet velocity, the Euler number increases accordingly.\n", "  \\SCWO is a tetragonal ($I4/m$) double perovskite with diamagnetic W$^{6+}$\n(5d$^0$) and (Jahn-Teller-active) Cu$^{2+}$ (3$d^9$) in a rocksalt-ordered\narrangement on the B sites, modelling an anisotropic fcc-lattice\nantiferromagnet with $S=1/2$. We have studied the magnetic structure, dynamics\nand thermodynamic properties of this material above and below the\n\\Neel{}-ordering transition at $T_{\\textrm{N}} = 24$~K. Muon spin relaxation\nspectroscopy, neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy experiments show\nthat the transition at $T_{\\textrm{N}}$ on heating is from static 3D type-2\nantiferromagnetism to 2D dynamic correlations that remain detectable up to\n100~K. Above $T_{\\textrm{N}}$ the muon relaxation is described by a compressed\nexponential decay, revealing a strong correlation between the spin fluctuation\nrate and the 2D correlation length. The low-temperature muon data and the\nentropy release around $T_{\\textrm{N}}$ as obtained from the heat capacity data\npoint to small magnetic domains, probably of the order of 60~\\AA{}. We note\nthat the material behaves more like a quasi-2D square lattice antiferromagnet\nthan could be expected considering its structure only. A possible explanation\nmight lie in the unusual strong spin-orbit-coupled magnetism of the W 5$d$\nlevels, as the dominant exchange interaction is via the Cu-O-W-O-Cu pathway.\n", "  If an active Janus particle is trapped at the interface between a liquid and\na fluid, its self-propelled motion along the interface is affected by a net\ntorque on the particle due to the viscosity contrast between the two adjacent\nfluid phases. For a simple model of an active, spherical Janus colloid we\nanalyze the conditions under which translation occurs along the interface and\nwe provide estimates of the corresponding persistence length. We show that\nunder certain conditions the persistence length of such a particle is\nsignificantly larger than the corresponding one in the bulk liquid, which is in\nline with the trends observed in recent experimental studies.\n", "  The plasmon-enhanced second harmonic generation in the subwavelength neutral\nmetal cubic nanoparticles is calculated for the first time in the hydrodynamic\nand cold plasma approximations. The theory is developed that takes into account\nall singularities of the electromagnetic field at the cubic nanoparticle\nsurface. The results are compared to the linear case for the nanocube and to\nthose for a spherical nanoparticle. In the latter case, they demonstrate very\nstrong enhancement of the local field strength and the second harmonic signal.\n", "  Achieving control over the directionality of active colloids is essential for\ntheir use in practical applications such as cargo carriers in microfluidic\ndevices. So far, guidance of spherical Janus colloids was mainly realized using\nspecially engineered magnetic multilayer coatings combined with external\nmagnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate that step-like sub-micron topographical\nfeatures can be used as reliable docking and guiding devices for chemically\nactive spherical Janus colloids. For various topographic features (stripes,\nsquares or circular posts) docking of the colloid at the feature edge is robust\nand reliable. Furthermore, the colloids move along the edges for significantly\nlong times, which systematically increase with fuel concentration. The observed\nphenomenology is qualitatively captured by a simple continuum model of\nself-diffusiophoresis near confining boundaries, indicating that the chemical\nactivity and associated hydrodynamic interactions with the nearby topography\nare the main physical ingredients behind the observed behaviour.\n", "  We investigate the effect of short chains on slip of highly entangled\npolystyrenes (PS) during thin film dewetting from non-wetting fluorinated\nsurfaces. Binary and ternary mixtures were prepared from monodisperse PS with\nweight average molecular weights $5 < M_\\textrm{w} < 490$ kg/mol. Flow dynamics\nand rim morphology of dewetting holes were captured using optical and atomic\nforce microscopy. Slip properties are assessed in the framework of hydrodynamic\nmodels describing the rim height profile of dewetting holes. We show that short\nchains with $M_\\textrm{w}$ below the polymer critical molecular weight for\nentanglements, $M_\\textrm{c}$, can play an important role in slip of highly\nentangled polymers. Among mixtures of the same $M_\\textrm{w}$, those containing\nchains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ exhibit larger slip lengths as the number average\nmolecular weight, $M_\\textrm{n}$, decreases. The slip enhancement effect is\nonly applicable when chains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ are mixed with highly\nentangled chains such that the content of the long chain component,\n$\\phi_\\textrm{L}$, is dominant ($\\phi_\\textrm{L}<0.5$). These results suggest\nthat short chains affect slip of highly entangled polymers on non-wetting\nsurfaces due to the physical or chemical disparities of end groups, and any\nassociated dynamical effect their presence may have, as compared to the\nbackbone units. The enhanced slip in this regard is attributed to the impact of\nchain end groups or short chain enrichment on the effective interfacial\nfriction coefficient. Accordingly, for entangled PS, a higher concentration of\nend groups or short chains at the interface results in a lower effective\nfriction coefficient which consequently enhances the slip length.\n", "  This document was prepared by the community that is active in Italy, within\nINFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare), in the field of\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The experimental study of the phase\ndiagram of strongly-interacting matter and of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\ndeconfined state will proceed, in the next 10-15 years, along two directions:\nthe high-energy regime at RHIC and at the LHC, and the low-energy regime at\nFAIR, NICA, SPS and RHIC. The Italian community is strongly involved in the\npresent and future programme of the ALICE experiment, the upgrade of which will\nopen, in the 2020s, a new phase of high-precision characterisation of the QGP\nproperties at the LHC. As a complement of this main activity, there is a\ngrowing interest in a possible future experiment at the SPS, which would target\nthe search for the onset of deconfinement using dimuon measurements. On a\nlonger timescale, the community looks with interest at the ongoing studies and\ndiscussions on a possible fixed-target programme using the LHC ion beams and on\nthe Future Circular Collider.\n", "  The nucleosynthesis in the first massive stars may be constrained by\nobserving the surface composition of long-lived very iron-poor stars born\naround 10 billion years ago from material enriched by their ejecta. Many\ninteresting clues on physical processes having occurred in the first stars can\nbe obtained just based on nuclear aspects. Two facts are particularly clear, 1)\nin these first massive stars, mixing must have occurred between the H-burning\nand the He-burning zone during their nuclear lifetimes; 2) only the outer\nlayers of these massive stars have enriched the material from which the very\niron-poor stars, observed today in the halo, have formed. These two basic\nrequirements can be obtained by rotating stellar models at very low\nmetallicity. In the present paper, we discuss the arguments supporting this\nview and illustrates the sensitivity of the results concerning the [Mg/Al]\nratio on the rate of the reaction Na(23)(p,\\gamma)Mg(24).\n", "  Regardless of the unspecific notions of photons as light complexes, radiation\nbundles or wave packets, the radiation from a single state transition is at\nmost a single continuous wave train that starts and ends with the transition.\nThe radiation equilibrium spectrum must be the superposition sum of the spectra\nof such wave trains. A classical equipartition of wave trains cannot diverge\nsince they would be finite in number, whereas standing wave modes are by\ndefinition infinite, which had doomed Rayleigh's theory, and concern only the\ntotal radiation. Wave trains are the microscopic entities of radiation\ninteracting with matter, that correspond to molecules in kinetic theory. Their\nquantization came from matter transitions in Einstein's 1917 derivation of\nPlanck's law. The spectral scatter of wave trains by Doppler shifts, which\ncause the wavelength displacements in Wien's law used for the frequency\ndependence in Einstein's derivation, is shown to yield the shape of the Planck\nspectrum. A Lorentz transform property of Doppler shifts discovered by Einstein\nis further shown equivalently necessary and sufficient to have corrected\nRayleigh's theory.\n", "  Electromagnetic vector potential has physical significance in quantum\nmechanics as revealed by the Aharonov-Bohm effect for charged particles.\nHowever, till date it is thought that we cannot measure the vector potential\ndirectly as this is not a gauge invariant quantity. Contrary to this belief,\nhere we show that one can indeed measure the electromagnetic vector potential\nusing the notion of weak value. We show that it is simply the difference\nbetween the weak value of the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the\npresence and absence of magnetic field. This suggests that the vector potential\nis not only a physical entity but can be measured directly in the experiment.\n", "  We classify two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians in terms of their computational\ncomplexity. Suppose one has a two-qubit commuting Hamiltonian H which one can\napply to any pair of qubits, starting in a computational basis state. We prove\na dichotomy theorem: either this model is efficiently classically simulable or\nit allows one to sample from probability distributions which cannot be sampled\nfrom classically unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, the\nonly simulable Hamiltonians are those which fail to generate entanglement. This\nshows that generic two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians can be used to perform\ncomputational tasks which are intractable for classical computers under\nplausible assumptions. Our proof makes use of new postselection gadgets and Lie\ntheory.\n", "  We investigate bipolar sunspot regions and how tilt angle and footpoint\nseparation vary during emergence and decay. The Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory collects data at a higher cadence\nthan historical records and allows for a detailed analysis of regions over\ntheir lifetimes. We sample the umbral tilt angle, footpoint separation, and\numbral area of 235 bipolar sunspot regions in Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager\n- Debrecen Data (HMIDD) with an hourly cadence. We use the time when the umbral\narea peaks as time zero to distinguish between the emergence and decay periods\nof each region and we limit our analysis of tilt and separation behavior over\ntime to within +/-96 hours of time zero. Tilt angle evolution is distinctly\ndifferent for regions with small (~30 MSH), midsize (~50 MSH), and large (~110\nMSH) maximum umbral areas, with 45 and 90 MSH being useful divisions in\nseparating the groups. At the peak umbral area, we determine median tilt angles\nfor small (7.6 degrees), midsize (5.9 degrees) and large (9.3 degrees) regions.\nWithin +/-48 hours of the time of peak umbral area, large regions steadily\nincrease in tilt angle, midsize regions are nearly constant, and small regions\nshow evidence of negative tilt during emergence. A period of growth in\nfootpoint separation occurs over a 72-hr period for all of the regions from\nroughly 40 to 70 Mm. The smallest bipoles (< 9 MSH) are outliers in that they\ndo not obey Joy's law and have a much smaller footpoint separation. We confirm\nMunoz-Jaramillo et al. (2015) results that the sunspots appear to be two\ndistinct populations.\n", "  We study the effects of external magnetic fields on the precision of\nparameter estimation with thermal entanglement of two spins in XX model, in the\npresence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Calculating the quantum\nFisher information, we show that homogeneous magnetic field B, inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field b or DM interaction D increases the precision of parameter\nestimation, overwhelming the destructive effects of thermalization. We also\nshow that for the model in consideration, the effects of b and D are the same.\nHowever, the existence of both b and B (or both D and B) decreases the\nprecision. We find that in order to increase the precision in parameter\nestimation tasks, applying b in the ferromagnetic case and B in the\nantiferromagnetic case should be preferred.\n", "  The velocity autocorrelation function (VAF) for a two-dimensional\none-component plasma (OCP) is investigated by employing molecular dynamics\ntechniques. The VAF exhibits well defined oscillations whose frequency is\nindependent of the dimensionless coupling parameter Gamma. However, the\npresence of a uniform perpendicular external magnetic field increases the\nheight of the first peak. Molecular dynamics computer simulation results are\npresented for a two-dimensional OCP in a perpendicular magnetic field as a\nfunction of the Plasma parameter. Our simulation results clearly indicate that\nat high temperature, the magnetic field affects the VAF in a substantial way.\n", "  We give a short introduction to Feynman diagrams, with many exercises. Text\nis targeted at students who had little or no prior exposure to quantum field\ntheory. We present condensed description of single-particle Dirac equation,\nfree quantum fields and construction of Feynman amplitude using Feynman\ndiagrams. As an example, we give a detailed calculation of cross-section for\nannihilation of electron and positron into a muon pair. We also show how such\ncalculations are done with the aid of computer.\n", "  Aluminum borohydride (Al(BH$_4$)$_3$) is an example of a promising hydrogen\nstorage material with exceptional hydrogen densities by weight and volume and a\nlow hydrogen desorption temperature. But, unfortunately, its production of\ndiborane (B$_2$H$_6$) gases upon heating to release the hydrogen restricts its\npractical use. To elucidate this issue, we investigate the properties of a\nnumber of metal borohydrides with the same problem and find that the\nelectronegativity of the metal cation is not the best descriptor of diborane\nproduction. We show that, instead, the closely related formation enthalpy is a\nbetter descriptor and we find that diborane production is an exponential\nfunction thereof. We conclude that diborane production is sufficiently\nsuppressed for formation enthalpies of $-$80 kJ/mol BH$_4$ or lower, providing\nspecific design guidelines to tune existing metal borohydrides or synthesize\nnew ones. We then use first-principles methods to study the effects of Sc\nalloying in Al(BH$_4$)$_3$. Our results for the thermodynamic properties of the\nAl$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$(BH$_4$)$_3$ alloy clearly show the stabilizing effect of Sc\nalloying and thus the suppression of diborane production. We conclude that\nstabilizing Al(BH$_4$)$_3$ and similar borohydrides via alloying or other means\nis a promising route to suppress diborane production and thus develop viable\nhydrogen storage materials.\n", "  SPAD cameras offer single photon detection sensitivity, high frame rates and\nzero readout noise. They are a core technology for widefield FLIM, but have\nfurther potential in ultra-fast imaging applications. However, in practice\nsensitivity falls behind that of EMCCD and sCMOS devices due to the lower\nphoton detection efficiency of SPAD arrays. This paper considers the\napplication of a binary SPAD camera to the capture of blinking molecules as\npart of a superresolution (dSTORM/PALM) experiment. Simulation and experimental\nstudies demonstrate that the effective sensitivity of the camera can be\nimproved significantly by aggregation of signal only binary frames. The\nsimulations also indicate that with future advances in SPAD camera technology,\nSPAD devices could in time outperform existing scientific cameras when\ncapturing fast temporal dynamics.\n", "  Einstein-Hilbert action with a determinantal invariant has been considered.\nThe obtained field equation contains the \\texttt{inverse Ricci tensor},\n$\\Re_{\\alpha\\beta}$. The linearized solution of invariant has been examined,\nand constant curvature space-time metric solution of the field equation gives\ndifferent curvature constant for each values of $\\sigma$. $\\sigma=0$ gives a\ntrivial solution for constant curvature, $R_{0}$.\n", "  We consider the chiral field model of the source of the Kerr-Newman (KN)\nsolution and obtain that it represents a supersymmetric spinning soliton,\nbounded by the chiral domain wall (DW) of the ellipsoidal form. The known\nmethod for transformation of the planar DW to Bogomolnyi form we generalize to\nthe curved DW-bubble adapted to the Kerr coordinate system and obtain the\nsupersymmetric BPS-saturated source of the KN solution, having some remarkable\nfeatures, in particular, the quantum angular momentum. The main new result is\nthat the source forms a breather, i.e. the DW-antiDW combination. Taking into\naccount that the KN solution describes the spinning particles with gyromagnetic\nratio g = 2, as that of the Dirac electron, we touch the problem of the\ncompatibility of the spinning particles with gravity.\n", "  The QueSERA Study Group (QSG) have been tasked by the RadioNet Board to\nproduce a White Paper on the future organisation and coordination of radio\nastronomy in Europe. This White Paper describes the options discussed by the\nQSG, and our conclusions on how to move forward. We propose, that as a first\nstep, RadioNet-work, be established as an entity that persists between EC\ncontracts, and that takes responsibility for preparing or coordinating\nresponses to EC opportunities specific to the field of radio astronomy research\ninfrastructures. RadioNet-work should provide a safety net that ensures that\ncooperation and collaboration between the various radio astronomy partners in\nEurope is maintained with or without EC funding.\n", "  We analytically study the scalar perturbation of non-asymptotically flat\n(NAF) rotating linear dilaton black holes (RLDBHs) in 4-dimensions. We show\nthat both radial and angular wave equations can be solved in terms of the\nhypergeometric functions. The exact greybody factor (GF), the absorption\ncross-section (ACS), and the decay rate (DR) for the massless scalar waves are\ncomputed for these black holes (BHs). The results obtained for ACS and DR are\ndiscussed through graphs.\n", "  We investigate physics based design of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar\ncells using self-consistent computational modeling. The significance of band\nalignment engineering and optimized carrier mobility are quantitatively\nexplored as a function of sub bandgap defect densities (N_t) in the bulk CQD.\nFor $N_t \\leq 10^{15} cm^{-3}$, band alignment engineering near the interface\nof CQD and the metal contact could significantly improve open circuit voltage\nby suppressing the forward bias dark current. This effect could enhance cell\nefficiency up to ~37% for thinner $(< 1 \\mu m)$ CQD layers. For thicker $(> 1\n\\mu m)$ CQD layer, the effect of band engineering is diminished as the forward\nbias dark current becomes diffusion-limited and less dependent on the\ninterfacial band offsets. An optimal carrier mobility in CQD lies in the range\n~ 10^{-2} cm^2/Vs - 10^0 cm^2/Vs and shows variation as a function of CQD layer\nthickness and the interfacial band offset. For $N_t \\approx 10^{14} cm^{-3}$,\nan optimally designed cell could provide ~20% efficiency under AM1.5G solar\nspectrum without employing advanced structural optimizations such as the\nnanostructured electrodes. These physical insights contribute to a better\nunderstanding of quantum dot solar cell design, allowing a step further towards\na highly efficient and a low cost solar cell technology.\n", "  The paper refutes the model and claims published in the Solid State\nCommunications [1] as well as elsewhere. The theoretical approach proposed in\n\"The multicaloric effect in multiferroic materials\" by Melvin M.~Vopson has a\nnumber of inaccuracies and mistakes. The Author of [1] does not pay necessary\nattention to the range of applicability of the derived equations and confuses\nthe dependent and independent variables. The resulting equations for\nelectrically and magnetically induced multicaloric effects are incorrect and\ncannot be used for measurement interpretation.\n", "  This Response is concerned with the recent Comment of Ruiz-Herrera,\n\"Limitations of the Method of Lagrangian Descriptors\" [arXiv:1510.04838],\ncriticising the method of Lagrangian Descriptors. In spite of the significant\nbody of literature asserting the contrary, Ruiz-Herrera claims that the method\nfails to reveal the presence of stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic\ntrajectories in incompressible systems and in almost all linear systems. He\nsupports this claim by considering the method of Lagrangian descriptors applied\nto three specific examples. However in this response we show that Ruiz-Herrera\ndoes not understand the proper application and interpretation of the method\nand, when correctly applied, the method beautifully and unambiguously detects\nthe stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic trajectories in his\nexamples.\n", "  The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum entanglement experiments is at best\nincomplete, since the intermediate state induced by collapse of the wave\nfunction apparently depends upon the inertial rest frame in which the\nexperiment is observed. While the Many Worlds Interpretation of Everett, MWI,\navoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the\nspecial theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past,\npresent and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules\nout Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by\npostulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are\nidentical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they\ndiverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event\nthen emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens\ndivided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of\nsuch universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking\nof it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe\nHypothesis proposed by Tegmark. However, while Tegmark wished to avoid\ncontamination from Goedelian self referential knots, not only does such\ncontamination appear to be inevitable, it brings an unexpected benefit. The\nmathematical hierarchy required by the enigmatic footnote 48a in the paper by\nGoedel leads to an explanation for a unitary evolution of deterministic quantum\nrules across the multiverse while accounting for quantum uncertainty within an\nindividual universe. Other aspects of this structure, called here the Plexus,\nare discussed, including awareness of existence and other questions raised by\nthe hypothesis.\n", "  Statistical mechanics descriptions of the second law of thermodynamics\ngenerally imply point-like particles driven by a dissipative overall mechanism\nfor their simultaneous time-evolution. As the number of involved particles\ngrows larger, it becomes more and more unlikely that they by itself adopt an\noff-equilibrium state with lower entropy. We present a macroscopic\ncounterexample of the second law that repeatedly and spontaneously produces an\nentropy sink, thus recurrently enables us to harvest energy that sidesteps all\nthe compensation interactions with the surroundings. Hence, this mechanism\nextracts energy from a single reservoir. This proves true in an experiment and\nis explained as a consequence of size effects, among them nonzero particle\nextent that marginally amend crucial peculiarities of thermodynamic equilibrium\ndynamics.\n", "  This paper is a follow-up to a previous paper on fermions. A simple state sum\nmodel for a scalar field on a triangulated 1-manifold is constructed. The model\nis independent of the triangulation and gives exactly the same partition\nfunction as the continuum functional integral with zeta function\nregularisation. For a certain choice of gauge group, the state sum model on the\ncircle is equivalent to the path integral for the simple harmonic oscillator.\n", "  Power-law dwell times have been observed for molecular motors in living\ncells, but the origins of these trapped states are not known. We introduce a\nminimal model of motors moving on a two-dimensional network of filaments, and\nsimulations of its dynamics exhibit statistics comparable to those observed\nexperimentally. Analysis of the model trajectories, as well as experimental\nparticle tracking data, reveals a state in which motors cycle unproductively at\njunctions of three or more filaments. We formulate a master equation for these\njunction dynamics and show that the time required to escape from this\nvortex-like state can account for the power-law dwell times. We identify trends\nin the dynamics with the motor valency for further experimental validation. We\ndemonstrate that these trends exist in individual trajectories of myosin II on\nan actin network. We discuss how cells could regulate intracellular transport\nand, in turn, biological function, by controlling their cytoskeletal network\nstructures locally.\n", "  Perfectly transparent metamaterial structures of arbitrary shapes,\nconstructed from coordinate stretching and contractions, are presented.\nCoordinate stretching has been used for 2 decades in perfectly matched layers\n(PMLs) to electromagnetically simulate infinite domains in numerical\ntechniques, but this concept is applied here for the first time to realize a\nphysical transmission medium. The transparent medium does not scatter\nelectromagnetic waves, i.e. it is reflection-less for all incidence angles and\nall excitation frequencies. It may be implemented in the form of metasurfaces\nand will clearly find a myriad of applications if it can be efficiently\nmanufactured.\n", "  The ability to manipulate oxygen anion defects rather than metal cations in\ncomplex oxides can facilitate creating new functionalities critical for\nemerging energy and device technologies. However, the difficulty in activating\noxygen at reduced temperatures hinders the deliberate control of important\ndefects, oxygen vacancies. Here, strontium cobaltite (SrCoOx) is used to\ndemonstrate that epitaxial strain is a powerful tool for manipulating the\noxygen vacancy concentration even under highly oxidizing environments and at\nannealing temperatures as low as 300 C. By applying a small biaxial tensile\nstrain (2%), the oxygen activation energy barrier decreases by ~30%, resulting\nin a tunable oxygen deficient steady-state under conditions that would normally\nfully oxidize unstrained cobaltite. These strain-induced changes in oxygen\nstoichiometry drive the cobaltite from a ferromagnetic metal towards an\nantiferromagnetic insulator. The ability to decouple the oxygen vacancy\nconcentration from its typical dependence on the operational environment is\nuseful for effectively designing oxides materials with a specific oxygen\nstoichiometry.\n", "  An asymptotically exact continuum dislocation theory of single crystal bars\nunder torsion is proposed. The dislocation distribution minimizing energy of\nthe bar with zero torque is shown to be uniform. If the applied torque is\nnon-zero, the minimizer exhibits a dislocation-free zone at the outer ring of\nthe bar's cross-section. The non-uniform distribution of dislocations in\nequilibrium as well as the twist angle per unit length are found in terms of\nthe given torque. With the energy dissipation being taken into account, there\nexists an elastic core region, while dislocation are concentrated in a ring\nbetween two dislocation-free zones. This leads to the change of the stress\ndistribution increasing the critical threshold of the torque.\n", "  All data are digitized, and hence are essentially integers rather than true\nreal numbers. Ordinarily this causes no difficulties since the truncation or\nrounding usually occurs below the noise level. However, in some instances, when\nthe instruments or data delivery and storage systems are designed with less\nthan optimal regard for the data or the subsequent data analysis, the effects\nof digitization may be comparable to important features contained within the\ndata. In these cases, information has been irrevocably lost in the truncation\nprocess. While there exist techniques for dealing with truncated data, we\npropose a straightforward method that will allow us to detect this problem\nbefore the data analysis stage. It is based on an optimal histogram binning\nalgorithm that can identify when the statistical structure of the digitization\nis on the order of the statistical structure of the data set itself.\n", "  The standard theory of quantum computation relies on the idea that the basic\ninformation quantity is represented by a superposition of elements of the\ncanonical basis and the notion of probability naturally follows from the Born\nrule. In this work we consider three valued quantum computational logics. More\nspecifically, we will focus on the Hilbert space C^3, we discuss extensions of\nseveral gates to this space and, using the notion of effect probability, we\nprovide a characterization of its states.\n", "  Metamaterials represent one of the most vibrant fields of modern science and\ntechnology. They are generally dispersive structures in the direct and\nreciprocal space and time domains. Upon this consideration, I overview here a\nnumber of metamaterial innovations developed by colleagues and myself in the\nholistic framework of space and time dispersion engineering. Moreover, I\nprovide some thoughts regarding the future perspectives of the area.\n", "  The paper presents the general concept of spacetime processing metasurfaces,\nsynthesized by generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs). It is shown\nthat such metasurfaces can perform multiple simultaneous spatio-temporal\nprocessing transformations on incident electromagnetic waves. A time-reversal\nspace-generalized-refraction metasurface and a multi-time-space-differentiating\nmetasurfaces are presented as applications of the general spacetime processing\nmetasurface concept.\n", "  We report on a micromagnetic numerical simulation study of dynamic couplings\nbetween neighboring skyrmions in narrow-width nanostrips. We explored the\ncoupled gyration modes and their characteristic dispersions in terms of the\ninterdistance between the neighboring skyrmions. The application of\nperpendicular magnetic fields, importantly, allows for control/modification of\nthe dispersion of the coupled modes. Coupled skyrmion gyration modes provide a\nnew type of efficient, reliable, fast, low-power-consumption information-signal\npropagation in narrow-width straight and curved nanostrips, as driven\npredominantly by the exchange interaction between individual nano-scale\nskyrmions.\n", "  When there is a deviation from the inequality $d\\ll {{l}_{\\varepsilon }}$\n($d$ is the contact diameter, and ${{l}_{\\varepsilon }}$ is the energy\nrelaxation length of the electrons), structural features are produced on the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of $S-c-N$ contacts at characteristic phonon\nenergies because of the decrease in $\\Delta $ due to the accumulation of\nnonequilibrium phonons with low group velocities near the contact.\n", "  The path probability of a particle undergoing stochastic motion is studied by\nthe use of functional technique, and the general formula is derived for the\npath probability distribution functional. The probability of finding paths\ninside a tube/band, the center of which is stipulated by a given path, is\nanalytically evaluated in a way analogous to continuous measurements in quantum\nmechanics. Then, the formalism developed here is applied to the stochastic\ndynamics of stock price in finance.\n", "  An initial radial electric field, $E_r(0)$, in an axisymmetric tokamak,\nresults in geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) oscillations. The GAMs Landau damp,\nresulting in a much smaller final residual electric field, $E_r(\\infty)$, and\naccompanying parallel zonal flows (Rosenbluth and Hinton, 1998 PRL 80, 724,\nhereafter RH). The phenomenon exhibits a large effective mass (inertia due to\nflows), with an enhancement of order the well-known RH factor. In apparent\nparadox, the final angular momentum in the RH parallel zonal flow is much\nsmaller than the angular momentum expected from the well-known rapid precession\nof the trapped particle population in the final electric field. In addition, an\neffective mass calculated naively based on the rapid trapped particle (TP)\nprecession is much larger than the RH factor. A drift kinetic calculation is\npresented showing that the mathematical origin of the extra mass factor is a\nshift, proportional to $E_r$, of the usual energy coordinates in phase space.\nImportantly, this shift contributes to the effective mass even if the system is\nlinearized in $E_r$, and can be interpreted as a first order linear shift in\nthe Jacobian. Further, the Jacobian shift recovers the large TP precession flow\nand also uncovers the presence of reverse circulating particle flows that, to\nlowest order, are equal and opposite to the TP precession. A detailed\ncalculation is presented. Work supported by DOE.\n", "  This study examines the magnetotransport response observed in flakes of the\n3D topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3, including indium superconducting\nelectrodes, and demonstrates two critical transitions in the magnetoresistive\nresponse with decreasing temperatures below T = 3.4K. The first transition is\nattributed to superconductivity in the indium electrodes, and the second\ntransition, with a critical field exceeding the transition field of indium, is\nattributed to a proximity effect at the 2D planar interface of this hybrid\nTI/superconductor structure.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are apparently one-time, relatively bright radio\npulses that have been observed in recent years. The origin of FRBs is currently\nunknown and many instruments are being built to detect more of these bursts to\nbetter characterize their physical properties and identify the source\npopulation. ALFABURST is one such instrument. ALFABURST takes advantage of the\n7-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver on the 305-m Arecibo Radio\nTelescope in Puerto Rico, to detect FRBs in real-time at L-band (1.4 GHz). We\npresent the results of recent on-sky tests and observations undertaken during\nthe commissioning phase of the instrument. ALFABURST is now available for\ncommensal observations with other ALFA projects.\n", "  A new method involving the effective wave function is used to define the mass\nof a particle in a standard five-dimensional extension of general relativity.\nThe mass is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the scalar field of the\nextra dimension. Since the scalar field is global and depends on the\ncoordinates, this definition for the particle mass agrees with Machs Principle.\n", "  We present a new, explicit sum formula for symmetric Macdonald polynomials\n$P_\\lambda$ and show that they can be written as a trace over a product of\n(infinite dimensional) matrices. These matrices satisfy the\nZamolodchikov--Faddeev (ZF) algebra. We construct solutions of the ZF algebra\nfrom a rank-reduced version of the Yang--Baxter algebra. As a corollary, we\nfind that the normalization of the stationary measure of the multi-species\nasymmetric exclusion process is a Macdonald polynomial with all variables set\nequal to one.\n", "  Echelle spectrographs with their high resolution plays important role in\ndetermination of characteristics of stellar lines. Wide field of applications\nis focused mainly on the measurements of precise radial velocity applied in\nexoplanetary research. In my diploma thesis I am concentrated on the\ncalibration of the Ond\\v{r}ejov Echelle Spectrograph at Astronomical Institute\nof the Czech Academy of Sciences. My role was to investigate the wide field of\nopportunities how to process the data with the best possible results.\nSuccessful reduction was performed by both Image Reduction and Analysis\nFacility (IRAF) and for Open source Pipeline for ESPaDOnS Reduction and\nAnalysis. This thesis includes the comparison of both pipelines.\n", "  In the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model away from half-filled,\nthe local antiferromagnetic exchange coupling can provide the pairing mechanism\nof quasiparticles via the Kondo screening effect, leading to the heavy fermion\nsuperconductivity. We find that the pairing symmetry \\textit{strongly} depends\non the Fermi surface (FS) structure in the normal metallic state. When\n$J_{H}/J_{K}$ is very small, the FS is a small hole-like circle around the\ncorner of the Brillouin zone, and the s-wave pairing symmetry has a lower\nground state energy. For the intermediate coupling values of $J_{H}/J_{K}$, the\nextended s-wave pairing symmetry gives the favored ground state. However, when\n$J_{H}/J_{K}$ is larger than a critical value, the FS transforms into four\nsmall hole pockets crossing the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone, and\nthe d-wave pairing symmetry becomes more favorable. In that regime, the\nresulting superconducting state is characterized by either nodal d-wave or\nnodeless d-wave state, depending on the conduction electron filling factor as\nwell. A continuous phase transition exists between these two states. This\nresult may be related to the phase transition of the nodal d-wave state to a\nfully gapped state, which is recently observed in Yb doped CeCoIn$_{5}$.\n", "  We assumed a stress tensor is necessary on the event horizon of a\nSchwarzschild black hole or on the Rindler horizon for the Israel matching\nconditions to be satisfied. We found the surface energy density $\\rho_{s}$ is\nvanishing but the surface pressure $p_{s}$ equals $1/16\\pi l$ in both cases,\nwhere $l$ is the proper distance from the horizon. The junction relations are\napplied both for $r =$ const. and $T =$ const. surfaces, with the same results\nfor the surface parameters $\\rho_{s}$ and $p_{s}$. We emphasize the nonstatic\nfeature of the spacetimes beyond the corresponding horizons.\n", "  The question of the uniqueness of energy-momentum tensors in the linearized\ngeneral relativity and in the linear massive gravity is analyzed without using\nvariational techniques. We start from a natural ansatz for the form of the\ntensor (for example, that it is a linear combination of the terms quadratic in\nthe first derivatives), and require it to be conserved as a consequence of\nfield equations. In the case of the linear gravity in a general gauge we find a\nfour-parametric system of conserved second-rank tensors which contains a unique\nsymmetric tensor. This turns out to be the linearized Landau-Lifshitz\npseudotensor employed often in full general relativity. We elucidate the\nrelation of the four-parametric system to the expression proposed recently by\nButcher et al. \"on physical grounds\" in harmonic gauge, and we show that the\nresults coincide in the case of high-frequency waves in vacuum after a suitable\naveraging. In the massive gravity we show how one can arrive at the expression\nwhich coincides with the \"generalized linear symmetric Landau-Lifshitz\" tensor.\nHowever, there exists another uniquely given simpler symmetric tensor which can\nbe obtained by adding the divergence of a suitable superpotential to the\ncanonical energy-momentum tensor following from the Fierz-Pauli action. In\ncontrast to the symmetric tensor derived by the Belinfante procedure which\ninvolves the second derivatives of the field variables, this expression\ncontains only the field and its first derivatives. It is simpler than the\ngeneralized Landau-Lifshitz tensor but both yield the same total quantities\nsince they differ by the divergence of a superpotential. We also discuss the\nrole of the gauge conditions in the proofs of the uniqueness. In the Appendix,\nthe use of the symbolic tensor manipulation software Cadabra is briefly\ndescribed.\n", "  The control of polarization, an essential property of light, is of wide\nscientific and technological interest. The general problem of generating\narbitrary time-varying states of polarization (SOP) has always been\nmathematically formulated by a series of linear transformations, i.e. a product\nof matrices, imposing a serial architecture. Here we show a parallel\narchitecture described by a sum of matrices. The theory is experimentally\ndemonstrated by modulating spatially-separated polarization components of a\nlaser using a digital micromirror device that are subsequently beam combined.\nThis method greatly expands the parameter space for engineering devices that\ncontrol polarization. Consequently, performance characteristics, such as speed,\nstability, and spectral range, are entirely dictated by the technologies of\noptical intensity modulation, including absorption, reflection, emission, and\nscattering. This opens up important prospects for polarization state generation\n(PSG) with unique performance characteristics and applications in spectroscopic\nellipsometry, spectropolarimetry, communications, imaging, and security.\n", "  Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers have attracted much attention for\ntheir novel optical properties and efficient light-matter interactions. When\nexcited by incident laser, the optical response of MoS2 monolayers was\neffectively modified by elementary photo-excited excitons owing to their large\nexciton binding energy, which can be facilitated for the optical-controllable\nexciton-plasmon interactions. Inspired by this concept, we experimentally\ninvestigated active light control of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in MoS2-Ag\nhybrid nanostructures. The white light spectra of SPR were gradually\nred-shifted by increasing laser power, which was distinctly different from the\none of bare Ag nanostructure. This spectroscopic tunability can be further\ncontrolled by near-field coupling strength and polarization state of light, and\nselectively applied to the control of plasmonic dark mode. An analytical\nLorentz model for photo-excited excitons induced modulation of MoS2 dielectric\nfunction was developed to explain the insight physics of this SPR tunability.\nOur study opens new possibilities to the development of all-optical controlled\nnanophotonic devices based on 2D materials.\n", "  Cosmic-ray neutron probes are widely used to monitor environmental water\ncontent near the surface. The method averages over tens of hectares and is\nunrivaled in serving representative data for agriculture and hydrological\nmodels at the hectometer scale. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the\nsensor response to environmental heterogeneity is not fully understood.\nKnowledge of the support volume is a prerequisite for the proper interpretation\nand validation of hydrogeophysical data. In a previous study, several physical\nsimplifications have been introduced into a neutron transport model in order to\nderive the characteristics of the cosmic-ray probe's footprint. We utilize a\nrefined source and energy spectrum for cosmic-ray neutrons and simulate their\nresponse to a variety of environmental conditions. Results indicate that the\nmethod is particularly sensitive to soil moisture in the first tens of meters\naround the probe, whereas the radial weights are changing dynamically with\nambient water. The footprint radius ranges from 130 to 240 m depending on air\nhumidity, soil moisture and vegetation. The moisture-dependent penetration\ndepth of 15 to 83 cm decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor.\nHowever, the footprint circle remains almost isotropic in complex terrain with\nnearby rivers, roads or hill slopes. Our findings suggest that a dynamically\nweighted average of point measurements is essential for accurate calibration\nand validation. The new insights will have important impact on signal\ninterpretation, sensor installation, data interpolation from mobile surveys,\nand the choice of appropriate resolutions for data assimilation into\nhydrological models.\n", "  In this paper, the reported experimental data in [Sci. Rep., 2012, 2, 533]\nrelated to electrical transport properties in bulk ZnO, ZnMgO/ZnO, and\nZnMgO/ZnO/ZnMgO single and double heterostructures were analyzed quantitatively\nand the most important scattering parameters for controlling electron\nconcentration and electron mobility were obtained. Treatment of intrinsic\nmechanisms included polar-optical phonon scattering, piezoelectric scattering\nand acoustic deformation potential scattering. For extrinsic mechanisms,\nionized impurity, dislocation scattering, and strain-induced fields were\nincluded. For bulk ZnO, the reported experimental data were corrected for\nremoving the effects of a degenerate layer at the ZnO/sapphire interface via a\ntwo layer Hall effect model. Also, donor density, acceptor density and donor\nactivation energy were determined via the charge balance equation. This sample\nexhibited hopping conduction below 50K and dislocation scattering closely\ncontrolled electron mobility closely. The obtained results indicated that the\nenhancement of electron mobility in double sample, compared with the single\none, can be attributed to the reduction of dislocation density, two dimensional\nimpurity density in the potential well due to background impurities, and/or\ninterface charge and strain-induced fields, which can be related to better\nelectron confinement in the channel and enhancement in the sheet carrier\nconcentration of 2DEG in this sample.\n", "  Liquid crystal elastomers represent a novel class of programmable\nshape-transforming materials whose shape change trajectory is encoded in the\nmaterial's nematic director field. Using three-dimensional nonlinear finite\nelement elastodynamics simulation, we model a variety of different actuation\ngeometries and device designs: thin films containing topological defects,\npatterns that induce formation of folds and twists, and a bas-relief structure.\nThe inclusion of finite bending energy in the simulation model reveals features\nof actuation trajectory that may be absent when bending energy is neglected. We\nexamine geometries with a director pattern uniform through the film thickness\nencoding multiple regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Simulations indicate\nthat heating such a system uniformly produces a disordered state with curved\nregions emerging randomly in both directions due to the film's up-down\nsymmetry. By contrast, applying a thermal gradient by heating the material\nfirst on one side breaks up-down symmetry and results in a deterministic\ntrajectory producing a more ordered final shape. We demonstrate that a folding\nzone design containing cut-out areas accommodates transverse displacements\nwithout warping or buckling; and demonstrate that bas-relief and more complex\nbent-twisted structures can be assembled by combining simple design motifs.\n", "  Asteroid families form as a result of large-scale collisions among main belt\nasteroids. The orbital distribution of fragments after a family-forming impact\ncould inform us about their ejection velocities. Unfortunately, however, orbits\ndynamically evolve by a number of effects, including the Yarkovsky drift,\nchaotic diffusion, and gravitational encounters with massive asteroids, such\nthat it is difficult to infer the ejection velocities eons after each family's\nformation. Here we analyze the inclination distribution of asteroid families,\nbecause proper inclination can remain constant over long time intervals, and\ncould help us to understand the distribution of the component of the ejection\nvelocity that is perpendicular to the orbital plane ($v_{W}$). From modeling\nthe initial breakup, we find that the distribution of $v_{W}$ of the fragments,\nwhich manage to escape the parent body's gravity, should be more peaked than a\nGaussian distribution (i.e., be leptokurtic) even if the initial distribution\nwas Gaussian. We surveyed known asteroid families for signs of a peaked\ndistribution of $v_{W}$ using a statistical measure of the distribution\npeakedness or flatness known as kurtosis. We identified eight families whose\n$v_{W}$ distribution is significantly leptokurtic. These cases (e.g. the\nKoronis family) are located in dynamically quiet regions of the main belt,\nwhere, presumably, the initial distribution of $v_{W}$ was not modified by\nsubsequent orbital evolution. We suggest that, in these cases, the inclination\ndistribution can be used to obtain interesting information about the original\nejection velocity field.\n", "  An asteroid family forms as a result of a collision between an impactor and a\nparent body. The fragments with ejection speeds higher than the escape velocity\nfrom the parent body can escape its gravitational pull. The cloud of escaping\ndebris can be identified by the proximity of orbits in proper element, or\nfrequency, domains. Obtaining estimates of the original ejection speed can\nprovide valuable constraints on the physical processes occurring during\ncollision, and used to calibrate impact simulations. Unfortunately, proper\nelements of asteroids families are modified by gravitational and\nnon-gravitational effects, such as resonant dynamics, encounters with massive\nbodies, and the Yarkovsky effect, such that information on the original\nejection speeds is often lost, especially for older, more evolved families.\n  It has been recently suggested that the distribution in proper inclination of\nthe Koronis family may have not been significantly perturbed by local dynamics,\nand that information on the component of the ejection velocity that is\nperpendicular to the orbital plane ($v_W$), may still be available, at least in\npart. In this work we estimate the magnitude of the original ejection velocity\nspeeds of Koronis members using the observed distribution in proper\neccentricity and inclination, and accounting for the spread caused by dynamical\neffects. Our results show that i) the spread in the original ejection speeds\nis, to within a 15% error, inversely proportional to the fragment size, and ii)\nthe minimum ejection velocity is of the order of 50 m/s, with larger values\npossible depending on the orbital configuration at the break-up.\n", "  A prerequisite for achieving seismic invisibility is to demonstrate the\nability of civil engineers to control seismic waves with artificially\nstructured soils. We carry out large-scale field tests with a structured soil\nmade of a grid consisting of cylindrical and vertical holes in the ground and a\nlow frequency artificial source (< 10 Hz). This allows the identification of a\ndistribution of energy inside the grid, which can be interpreted as the\nconsequence of an effective negative refraction index. Such a flat lens\nreminiscent of what Veselago and Pendry envisioned for light opens avenues in\nseismic metamaterials to counteract the most devastating components of seismic\nsignals.\n", "  We present a new approach to super-resolution optical imaging, based on\nstructured illumination in hyperbolic media. The proposed system allows for\nplanar geometry, has unlimited field of view, and is robust with respect to\noptical noise and material losses.\n", "  We report on luminance measurements of the summer night sky at a field site\non a freshwater lake in northeastern Germany (Lake Stechlin) to evaluate the\namount of artificial skyglow from nearby and distant towns in the context of a\nplanned study on light pollution. The site is located about 70 km north of\nBerlin in a rural area possibly belonging to one of the darkest regions in\nGermany. Continuous monitoring of the zenith sky luminance between June and\nSeptember 2015 was conducted utilizing a Sky Quality Meter. With this device,\ntypical values for clear nights in the range of 21.5-21.7\nmag$_{SQM}/$arcsec$^2$ were measured, which is on the order of the natural sky\nbrightness during starry nights. On overcast nights, values down to 22.84\nmag$_{SQM}/$arcsec$^2$ were obtained, which is about one third as bright as on\nclear nights. The luminance measured on clear nights as well as the darkening\nwith the presence of clouds indicate that there is very little influence of\nartificial skyglow on the zenith sky brightness at this location. Furthermore,\nfish-eye lens sky imaging luminance photometry was performed with a digital\nsingle-lens reflex camera on a clear night in the absence of moonlight. The\nphotographs unravel several distant towns as possible sources of light\npollution on the horizon. However, the low level of artificial skyglow makes\nthe field site at Lake Stechlin an excellent location to study the effects of\nskyglow on a lake ecosystem in a controlled fashion.\n", "  The prohibitive cost of performing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tasks with\na very large number of input parameters can be addressed, if the response\nexhibits some special structure that can be discovered and exploited. Several\nphysical responses exhibit a special structure known as an active subspace\n(AS), a linear manifold of the stochastic space characterized by maximal\nresponse variation. The idea is that one should first identify this low\ndimensional manifold, project the high-dimensional input onto it, and then link\nthe projection to the output. In this work, we develop a probabilistic version\nof AS which is gradient-free and robust to observational noise. Our approach\nrelies on a novel Gaussian process regression with built-in dimensionality\nreduction with the AS represented as an orthogonal projection matrix that\nserves as yet another covariance function hyper-parameter to be estimated from\nthe data. To train the model, we design a two-step maximum likelihood\noptimization procedure that ensures the orthogonality of the projection matrix\nby exploiting recent results on the Stiefel manifold. The additional benefit of\nour probabilistic formulation is that it allows us to select the dimensionality\nof the AS via the Bayesian information criterion. We validate our approach by\nshowing that it can discover the right AS in synthetic examples without\ngradient information using both noiseless and noisy observations. We\ndemonstrate that our method is able to discover the same AS as the classical\napproach in a challenging one-hundred-dimensional problem involving an elliptic\nstochastic partial differential equation with random conductivity. Finally, we\nuse our approach to study the effect of geometric and material uncertainties in\nthe propagation of solitary waves in a one-dimensional granular system.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a promising degree of freedom for\nfundamental studies in electromagnetics and quantum mechanics. The unlimited\nstate space of OAM shows a great potential to enhance channel capacities of\nclassical and quantum communications. By exploring the Pancharatnam-Berry phase\nconcept and engineering anisotropic scatterers in a metasurface with spatially\nvarying orientations, a plane wave with zero OAM can be converted to a vortex\nbeam carrying nonzero OAM. In this paper, we proposed two types of novel PEC\n(perfect electric conductor)-PMC (perfect magnetic conductor) anisotropic\nmetasurfaces. One is composed of azimuthally continuous loops and the other is\nconstructed by azimuthally discontinuous dipole scatterers. Both types of\nmetasurfaces are mounted on a mushroom-type high impedance surface. Compared to\nprevious metasurface designs for generating OAM, the proposed ones achieve\nnearly perfect conversion efficiency. In view of the eliminated vertical\ncomponent of electric field, the continuous metasurface shows very smooth phase\npattern at the near-field region, which cannot be achieved by convectional\nmetasurfaces composed of discrete scatterers. On the other hand, the\nmetasurface with discrete dipole scatterers shows a great flexibility to\ngenerate OAM with arbitrary topological charges. Our work is fundamentally and\npractically important to high-performance OAM generation.\n", "  A reciprocal transformation for a 3-component Camassa-Holm type system is\nconstructed to connect it with the first negative flow of a generalized MKdV\nhierarchy, and a bi-Hamiltonian structure for the transformed system is also\nconsidered.\n", "  An atlas of spectra of the unique high luminosity objects MWC 314 and\nIRC+10420 taken with the CCD echelle spectrograph (R=15000) at the prime focus\nof the 6-m telescope of SAO is presented. About 320 emission and absorption\nfeatures of stellar, circumstellar and interstellar nature are identified in\nthe interval between 4790 and 7520 \\AA{}. Their relative intensities and radial\nvelocities are given and the distinctions of their profiles are discussed.\n", "  Control of the magnetization vector in ferromagnetic films and\nheterostructures by using electric tools instead of external magnetic fields\ncan lead to low-power memory devices. We observe the robust changes in\nmagnetization states of a thin (about 30 nm) film of alpha-Fe covered by the\nnaturally formed layer ( about 6 nm in thickness) of iron ohyhydroxides (FeOOH)\nunder discharging a capacitor through the film. Strikingly, the magnetization\nvector is switchable by the discharge even with no any biasing field at room\ntemperatures. In this electrically induced magnetization switching (EIMS) we\nreveal the key role of the FeOOH layer. We demonstrate experimental evidences\nthat not the discharge current itself but the electric field (of the order of\n10 kV/m) generated by this current is responsible for EIMS. The results\nreported here provide a plausible explanation of the observed phenomenon in\nterms of electric-field-induced weak ferromagnetism in the FeOOH layer and its\ncoupling with the underlying alpha-Fe.\n", "  We perform lattice numerical simulations to study the phase transition of QCD\nat finite temperature to clarify the nature of the transition of massless two\nflavor QCD. We investigate QCD with two light and Nf heavy quarks instead of\ntwo-flavor QCD, and focus on the light quark mass dependence of the critical\nheavy mass, below which the transition is of first order. The heavy quarks are\nincorporated into two flavor configurations in the form of the hopping\nparameter expansion through the reweighting technique. The nature of the\ntransition is identified by the shape of the constraint effective potential at\nthe critical temperature. Our result indicates that the critical heavy mass\nremains finite in the chiral limit of the two flavors, suggesting the phase\ntransition of massless two-flavor QCD is of second order.\n", "  We characterize the groupoids for which an operator is Fredholm if, and only\nif, its principal symbol and all its boundary restrictions are invertible. A\ngroupoid with this property is called {\\em Fredholm}. Using results on the\nEffros-Hahn conjecture, we show that an almost amenable, Hausdorff, second\ncountable groupoid is Fredholm. Many groupoids, and hence many\npseudodifferential operators appearing in practice, fit into this framework. In\nparticular, one can use these results to characterize the Fredholm operators on\nmanifolds with cylindrical and poly-cylindrical ends, on manifolds that are\nasymptotically Euclidean or asymptotically hyperbolic, on products of such\nmanifolds, and on many others. Moreover, we show that the desingularization of\nLie groupoids preserves the class of Fredholm groupoids.\n", "  A method for accurate modeling of a reflector antenna system with a wideband\nphased array feed is presented and used to study the effects of the number of\nactive antenna elements and associated receiving channels on the receiving\nsensitivity of the antenna system. Numerical results are shown for a practical\ndesign named APERTIF that is currently under developed at The Netherlands\nInstitute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON).\n", "  We study genuine finite density effects in QCD-like theories with\nthree-dimensional Polyakov-loop effective theories for heavy quarks. These are\nderived from the full QCD-like theories by combined strong-coupling and hopping\nexpansions. In particular, we investigate the cold and dense regimes of phase\ndiagrams where we expect to find Bose-Einstein-condensation of diquark baryons\nor a fermionic first-order liquid-gas transition, depending on the gauge group\nof the theory. In two-color QCD, for example, we observe evidence of a\ncontinuous zero-temperature transition to finite diquark density when the quark\nchemical potential $\\mu$ reaches half the diquark mass, i.e. without binding\nenergy. In G$_2$-QCD we observe, in addition to this \"Silver Blaze\" onset of\ndiquark density, a second transition in the density towards an exponential\nincrease by roughly $3\\mu/T$ corresponding to a finite density of\nG$_2$-nucleons.\n", "  In this paper, we present a numerical electromagnetic model of a focal plane\narray in combination with a multi-channel receiver. Initial experimental\nvalidation results are shown that confirm the expected predictions from the\nmodel.\n", "  Recently, S. Aggarwal [Chin. Phys. B 23 (2014) 093203] reported energy\nlevels, radiative rates and lifetimes for the lowest 60 levels belonging to the\n2s$^2$2p$^5$, 2s2p$^6$ and 2s$^2$2p$^4$3$\\ell$ configurations of F-like\ntungsten. There is no discrepancy for his calculated energies for the levels\nand the radiative rates for the limited number of E1 transitions, but the\nreported results for lifetimes are highly inaccurate. According to our\ncalculations, errors in his reported lifetimes are up to 6 orders of magnitude\nfor several levels. Here we report the correct lifetimes for future comparisons\nand applications, and also explain the reason for discrepancies.\n", "  The paper presents the study of tunnel current-voltage characteristics of Au,\nPd and Pt nanoclusters deposited onto the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite\n(HOPG) surface by pulsed laser deposition. The analysis of tunnel\ncurrent-voltage characteristics obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n(STS) allowed to recover the thermoelectric power value of nanoclusters. It was\nfound that the value of thermoelectric power of pulsed laser deposited\nnanoclusters depends on nanocluster material and shows qualitative difference\nin size dependence for different materials of nanoclusters. Thus,\nthermoelectric power value of PLD Pd nanoclusters decreases with increasing of\nnanocluster size, while for Au nanoclusters this value increases. The analysis\nof the results are discussed.\n", "  The given work is devoted to the modern developments in the field of radio\nastronomy instrumentation. In particular, the sensitivity of the multi-beam\nreflector radio telescope which is fed by phased array (PAF) is considered.\nUsing PAF as reflector feed allows obtaining wide and continuous field of view\n(FOV) of the telescope. This has several advantages with compare to\nhorn-cluster feeds which are described in this work. The sensitivity inside\nwhole FOV was computed using three different beamforming schemes.\n", "  The model of the reflector antenna system with focal plane array, low-noise\namplifier and beamformer is developed in the work. The beamformer strategy is\nsuggested to reduce the receiving sensitivity ripple inside field of view of\nthe telescope, while the sensitivity itself drops slightly (less than 10%). The\nsystem APERTIF (which is currently under development in Netherlands Institute\nFor Radioastronomy, ASTRON) has been analyzed using developed model, and\nnumerical results are presented. The obtained numerical results have been\nverified experimentally in anechoic chamber as well as on one of the dishes of\nthe Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (all measurements have been done in\nASTRON).\n", "  We have investigated both static and dynamic magnetic properties of\npolycrystalline CaRu$_{1-x}$Sc$_{x}$O$_{3}$ system in order to clarify the role\nof Sc ions as a disorder for magnetic ordering. We have observed typical\nfeatures of a ferromagnetic cluster glass state below around 40 K: (i) a broad,\nfrequency-dependent peak in the ac magnetic susceptibility, (ii) a slow\nrelaxation of the magnetization, and (iii) a continuous increase in the dc\nmagnetic susceptibility in field cooling process. The composition dependence of\ncharacteristic parameters for the cluster glass state suggests that chemical\nsegregation can hardly explain the clustering mechanism. We propose a possible\npicture that the ferromagnetic clusters are distributed uniformly and form the\nglassy state embedded in the paramagnetic and metallic host of CaRuO$_{3}$.\n", "  We derive a model of quantum-classical hybrids for a simplified model of\nquantum electrodynamics in the framework of the stochastic variational method.\nIn this model, charged particle trajectories are affected by the interaction\nwith quantized electromagnetic fields, and this quantum-classical interaction\ninduces a displacement current. We further investigate a geometric phase in the\nwave functional of the gauge field configuration, which is induced by adiabatic\nmotions of the charged particles. This phase contains the quantum-classical\nbackreaction effect and usual Berry's phase is reproduced in the vanishing\nlimit of the fluctuation of the charged particle trajectories.\n", "  In this note, we propose a closed formula for the partition function $Z(t,q)$\nof the $\\beta\\gamma$ system on the cone of pure spinors. We give the answer in\nterms of theta functions, $q$-Pochhammer symbols and Eisenstein series.\n", "  Around 1936, Einstein wrote to his close friend Max Born telling him that,\ntogether with Nathan Rosen, he had arrived at the interesting result that\ngravitational waves did not exist, though they had been assumed a certainty to\nthe first approximation. He finally had found a mistake in his 1936 paper with\nRosen and believed that gravitational waves do exist. However, in 1938,\nEinstein again obtained the result that there could be no gravitational waves!\n", "  Coherent transport of excitations along chains of coupled quantum systems\nrepresents an interesting problem with a number of applications ranging from\nquantum optics to solar cell technology. A convenient tool for studying such\nprocesses are quantum walks. They allow to determine in a quantitative way all\nthe process features. We study the survival probability and the transport\nefficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The\npropagation of excitation is modeled by a discrete-time (coined) quantum walk.\nFor a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its\nactual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays\nexponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the\nsurvival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the\nevolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its\npresent position, i.e. the propagation is modeled by a lazy quantum walk, then\npart of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never\nreaches the sink. In such a case, the survival probability does not vanish and\nthe excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport\nefficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for\nsome lazy quantum walks dynamical percolations of the ring eliminate the\ntrapping effect and efficient excitation transport can be achieved.\n", "  The reactive growth of cobalt germanide on Ge(001) was investigated by means\nof in-situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy photoemission electron microscopy\n(XAS-PEEM), micro-illumination low-energy electron diffraction ($\\mu$-LEED),\nand ex-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). At a Co deposition temperature of\n670{\\deg}C, a rich morphology with different island shapes and dimensions is\nobserved, and a correlation between island morphology and stoichiometry is\nfound. Combining XAS-PEEM and $\\mu$-LEED, we were able to identify a large part\nof the islands to consist of CoGe$_2$, with many of them having an unusual\nepitaxial relationship: CoGe$_2$[$\\bar110$](111) $\\parallel$\nGe[$\\bar110$](001). Side facets with (112) and (113) orientation have been\nfound for such islands. However, two additional phases were observed, most\nlikely Co$_5$Ge$_7$ and CoGe. The occurrence of these intermediate phases is\npromoted by defects, as revealed by comparing growth on Ge(001) single crystals\nand on Ge(001)/Si(001) epilayer substrates.\n", "  We propose changes to the colour reconnection model in the Monte Carlo event\ngenerator Herwig in order to remove the quasi diffractive events from the soft\nmultiple parton interactions. We then implement explicitly soft diffraction and\nshow some preliminary results.\n", "  Most processes in nature are coupled; however, extensive null models for\ngenerating such processes still lacks. We present a new method to generate two\ncoupled Gaussian stochastic processes with arbitrary correlation functions.\nThis method is developed by modifying the Fourier filtering method. The\nrobustness of this method is proved by generating two coupled fractional\nBrownian motions and extending its range of application to Gaussian random\nfields.\n", "  The dynamics of magnetic field penetration into thin-walled superconducting\nniobium cylinders is experimentally investigated. It is shown that magnetic\nfield penetrates through the wall of a cylinder in a series of giant jumps with\namplitude 10 - 20 Oe and duration of a few $\\mu$s. The jumps take place when\nthe total current in the wall, not the current density, exceeds some critical\nvalue. In addition there are small jumps and/or smooth penetration, and their\ncontribution can reach 20% of the total penetrating flux. It is demonstrated\nthat the magnetic field inside the cylinder exhibits several oscillations. The\nnumber of giant jumps reduces with temperature.\n", "  An efficient method is presented for solving axisymmetric, frictionless\ncontact problems between a rigid punch and an elastically non-homogeneous,\npower-law graded half-space. Provided that the contact area is simply-connected\nprofiles of arbitrary shape can be considered. Moreover, adhesion in the\nframework of the generalized JKR-theory can be taken into account. All results\nagree exactly with those given by three-dimensional contact theories. The\nmethod uses the fact that three-dimensional contact problems can be mapped to\none-dimensional ones with a properly defined Winkler-foundation; hence, the\nmethod is to be understood as an extension of the method of dimensionality\nreduction. A prerequisite of its applicability forms the generality of contact\nstiffness regardless of the geometry of the axisymmetric profile, which is\nproved. All the necessary mapping rules are derived and their ease of use\nexplained by solving contact problems based on actual examples and up to now\nunsolved problems.\n  -----\n  Es wird eine sehr effiziente Methode zur exakten L\\\"osung des\naxialsymmetrischen, reibungsfreien Kontaktproblems zwischen einem starren\nIndenter und einem elastisch inhomogenen Halbraum vorgestellt, dessen\nElastizit\\\"smodul mit der Tiefe nach einem Potenzgesetz zunimmt. Unter der\nVoraussetzung einer einfach zusammenh\\\"angenden Kontaktfl\\\"ache k\\\"onnen\nbeliebig geformte Profile angenommen und auch Kontakte mit Adh\\\"asion gel\\\"ost\nwerden. Die Methode nutzt die Tatsache aus, dass dreidimensionale\nKontaktprobleme auf Kontaktprobleme mit einer eindimensionalen Winklerschen\nBettung abgebildet werden k\\\"onnen und ist daher als Erweiterung der Methode\nder Dimensionsreduktion zu verstehen. In diesem Beitrag werden alle notwendigen\nAbbildungsregeln hergeleitet und ihre einfache Anwendung zur L\\\"osung von\nKontaktproblemen anhand von aktuellen Beispielen und bisher ungel\\\"osten\nProblemen erl\\\"autert.\n", "  The specificity of molecular recognition is important to molecular\nself-organization. A prominent example is the biological cell where, within a\nhighly crowded molecular environment, a myriad of different molecular receptor\npairs recognize their binding partner with astonishing accuracy. In thermal\nequilibrium it is usually admitted that the affinity of recognizer pairs only\ndepends on the nature of the two binding molecules. Accordingly, Boltzmann\nfactors of binding energy differences relate the molecular affinities among\ndifferent target molecules that compete for the same probe. Here, we consider\nthe molecular recognition of short DNA oligonucleotide single strands. We show\nthat a better matching oligonucleotide strand can prevail against a\ndisproportionally more concentrated competitor that exhibits reduced affinity\ndue to a mismatch. The magnitude of deviation from the simple picture above may\nreach several orders of magnitude. In our experiments the effective molecular\naffinity of a given strand remains elevated only as long as the better matching\ncompetitor is not present. We interpret our observations based on an\nenergy-barrier of entropic origin that occurs if two competing oligonucleotide\nstrands occupy the same probe simultaneously. In this situation the relative\nbinding affinities are reduced asymmetrically, which leads to an expression of\nthe free energy landscape that represents a formal analogue of a Landau\ndescription of phase transitions. Our mean field description reproduces the\nobservations in quantitative agreement. The advantage of improved molecular\nrecognition comes at no energetic cost other than the design of the molecular\nensemble, and the introduction of the competitor. It will be interesting to see\nif mechanisms along similar lines as exposed here, contribute to the molecular\nsynergy that occurs in biological systems.\n", "  In this letter we report the stress induced Mn charge-ordering process in the\nLiMn2O4 spinel, evidenced by the lattice strain evolutions due to the\nJahn-Teller effects. In-situ neutron diffraction, reveals that the initial\nstage of this process at low stress, indicating the eg electron localization at\nthe preferential Mn sites during the early phase transition, as an underlying\ncharge ordering mechanism in the charge-frustrated LiMn2O4. The initial stage\nof this transition exhibits as a progressive lattice and charge evolution,\nwithout showing a first-order behavior.\n", "  In this paper we present a large-scale sensitivity study of reaction rates in\nthe main component of the $s$ process. The aim of this study is to identify all\nrates, which have a global effect on the $s$ process abundance distribution and\nthe three most important rates for the production of each isotope. We have\nperformed a sensitivity study on the radiative $^{13}$C-pocket and on the\nconvective thermal pulse, sites of the $s$ process in AGB stars. We identified\n22 rates, which have the highest impact on the $s$-process abundances in AGB\nstars.\n", "  We prove that any regular integral invariant of volume-preserving\ntransformations is equivalent to the helicity. Specifically, given a functional\n$\\mathcal I$ defined on exact divergence-free vector fields of class $C^1$ on a\ncompact 3-manifold that is associated with a well-behaved integral kernel, we\nprove that $\\mathcal I$ is invariant under arbitrary volume-preserving\ndiffeomorphisms if and only if it is a function of the helicity.\n", "  Conventional linear optical activity effects are widely used for studying\nchiral materials. However, poor contrast and artifacts due to sample anisotropy\nlimit the applicability of these methods. Here we demonstrate that nonlinear\nsecond-harmonic-generation circular dichroism spectral microscopy can overcome\nthese limits. In intact collagenous tissues, clear spectral resonance is\nobserved with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. By performing gradual protein\ndenaturation studies, we show that the resonant responses are dominantly due to\nthe molecular chirality.\n", "  We report on the observation of spin whirls in a radially expanding polariton\ncondensate formed under non-resonant optical excitation. Real space imaging of\npolarization- and time-resolved photoluminescence reveal a spiralling\npolarization pattern in the plane of the microcavity. Simulations of the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of a spinor condensate reveal the crucial role of\npolariton interactions with a spinor exciton reservoir. Harnessing spin\ndependent interactions between the exciton reservoir and polariton condensates\nallows for the manipulation of spin currents and the realization of dynamic\ncollective spin effects in solid state systems.\n", "  We holographically study the effect of back reaction on the hydrodynamical\nproperties of $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ strongly coupled super Yang-Mills (SYM) thermal\nplasma. The back reaction we consider arises from the presence of static heavy\nquarks uniformly distributed over $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM plasma. In order to\nstudy the hydrodynamical properties, we use heavy quark as well as heavy\nquark-antiquark bound state as probes and compute the jet quenching parameter,\nscreening length and binding energy. We also consider the rotational dynamics\nof heavy probe quark in the back-reacted plasma and analyse associated energy\nloss. We observe that the presence of back reaction enhances the energy-loss in\nthe thermal plasma. Finally, we show that there is no effect of angular drag on\nthe rotational motion of quark-antiquark bound state probing the back reacted\nthermal plasma.\n", "  The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can\novercome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a\ncritical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum\ncomputers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a\n\"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the\nlifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has\nthus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works\nhave demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,\nphotons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily\nillustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test\nthe capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over\ntime. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by\nsuppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded\nin superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting\nresonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using\nreal-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and\ncorrect. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the\nencoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20\ntimes greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an\nuncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element\nof the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the\npower of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC\nschemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction\nfrom confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system\nperformance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.\n", "  Collisions of gas particles with a drifting grain give rise to a mechanical\ntorque on the grain. Recent work by Lazarian & Hoang showed that mechanical\ntorques might play a significant role in aligning helical grains along the\ninterstellar magnetic field direction, even in the case of subsonic drift. We\ncompute the mechanical torques on 13 different irregular grains and examine\ntheir resulting rotational dynamics, assuming steady rotation about the\nprincipal axis of greatest moment of inertia. We find that the alignment\nefficiency in the subsonic drift regime depends sensitively on the grain shape,\nwith more efficient alignment for shapes with a substantial mechanical torque\neven in the case of no drift. The alignment is typically more efficient for\nsupersonic drift. A more rigorous analysis of the dynamics is required to\ndefinitively appraise the role of mechanical torques in grain alignment.\n", "  Parrondo's paradox is about a paradoxical game and gambling where two\nprobabilistic losing games can be combined to form a winning game. While the\ncounter intuitive game is interesting in itself, it can be thought of a\ndiscrete version of Brownian flashing ratchet which are employed to understand\nnoise induced order. There are plenty of examples from physics to biology and\nsocial sciences where the stochastic thermal fluctuations actually help\nachieving positive movements. In our study, we study various combinations of\nlosing games in order to understand how and how far the losing combinations\nresult in winning. Further we devise an alternative model to study the similar\nparadox. The work reported here is mostly done through computer simulations.\n", "  The roots of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods is usually attributed to\nReed and Hills in a paper published in 1973 on the numerical approximation of\nthe neutron transport equation [18]. In fact, the adventure really started with\na rather thoroughfull series of five papers by Cockburn and Shu in the late\n80's [7, 5, 9, 6, 8]. Then, the fame of the method, which could be seen as a\ncompromise between Finite Elements (the center of the method being a weak\nformulation) and Finite Volumes (the basis functions are defined cell-wise, the\ncells being the elements of the primal mesh) increased and slowly investigated\nsuccessfully all the domains of Partial Differential Equations numerical\nintegration. In particular, one can cite the ground papers for the common\ntreatment of convection-diffusion equations [4, 3] or the treatment of pure\nelliptic equations [2, 17]. For more information on the history of\nDiscontinuous Galerkin method, please refer to section 1.1 of [15]. Today, DG\nmethods are widely used in all kind of manners and have applications in almost\nall fields of applied mathematics. (TODO: cite applications and\nstructured/unstructured meshes, steady/unsteady, etc...). The methods is now\nmature enough to deserve entire text books, among which I cite a reference book\non Nodal DG Methods by Henthaven and Warburton [15] with the ground basis of DG\nintegration, numerical analysis of its linear behavior and generalization to\nmultiple dimensions. Lately, since 2010, thanks to a ground work of Zhang and\nShu [26, 27, 25, 28, 29], Discontinuous Galerkin methods are eventually able to\ncombine high order accuracy and certain preservation of convex constraints,\nsuch as the positivity of a given quantity, for example. These new steps\nforward are very promising since it brings us very close to the \"Ultimate\nConservative Scheme\", [23, 1].\n", "  Fast-burning mechanism describes the rapid penetration, with a sharp-shaped\nwave-front, of a strong magnetic field into a conductive metal whose electric\nresistance poses an abrupt rise at some critical temperature. With its\nwave-front sweeping over a solid metal, the fast-burning can melt or vaporize\nthe metal very rapidly. This paper derives formulas for the existence\nconditions and wave-front velocity of a fast-burning.\n", "  We investigate the effects of isospin asymmetry on the competition between\ncolor-superconductivity and inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in dense\ntwo-flavor quark matter using an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We confirm\nthe appearance of a coexistence window where chiral symmetry is inhomogeneously\nbroken and a nonzero spatially homogeneous diquark gap is present, consistently\nwith previous works, and show that such a phase survives at nonzero isospin\nchemical potentials. We also discuss how the model phase structure becomes\nmodified as large isospin asymmetries are considered.\n", "  This is an elementary introduction to basic tools of supersymmetry: the\nspacetime symmetries, gauge theory and its application in gravity, spinors and\nsuperalgebras. Special attention is devoted to conformal and anti-de Sitter\nalgebras.\n", "  We discuss a continuous variables method of quantum key distribution\nemploying strongly polarized coherent states of light. The key encoding is\nperformed using the variables known as Stokes parameters, rather than the field\nquadratures. Their quantum counterpart, the Stokes operators $\\hat{S}_i$\n(i=1,2,3), constitute a set of non-commuting operators, being the precision of\nsimultaneous measurements of a pair of them limited by an uncertainty-like\nrelation. Alice transmits a conveniently modulated two-mode coherent state, and\nBob randomly measures one of the Stokes parameters of the incoming beam. After\nperforming reconciliation and privacy amplification procedures, it is possible\nto distill a secret common key. We also consider a non-ideal situation, in\nwhich coherent states with thermal noise, instead of pure coherent states, are\nused for encoding.\n", "  We propose a two-photon micromaser-based scheme for the generation of a\nnonclassical state from a mixed state. We conclude that a faster, as well as a\nhigher degree of field purity is achieved in comparison to one-photon\nprocesses. We investigate the statistical properties of the resulting field\nstates, for initial thermal and (phase-diffused) coherent states.\nQuasiprobabilities are employed to characterize the state of the generated\nfields.\n"]}
