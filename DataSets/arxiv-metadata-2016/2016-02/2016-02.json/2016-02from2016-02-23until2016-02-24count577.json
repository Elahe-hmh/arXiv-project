"abstract": ["  We report a practical non-postselection entanglement concentration scheme in\nwhich a maximally entangled Bell-state photon pair is produced from two pairs\nof partially (or non-maximally) entangled photons. Since this scheme is built\nonly upon linear optical elements and does not require photon-number resolving\ndetectors, it has immediate applications in experimental implementations of\nvarious quantum information protocols which require two-photon Bell-states.\n", "  We show that adsorption of one lithium atom to a polyacenes, i.e. chains of\nlinearly fused benzene rings, will cause this chain to be slightly deformed. If\nwe adsorb a second identical atom on the opposite side of the same ring, this\ndeformation is dramatically enhanced despite of the fact, that a symmetric\nconfiguration seems possible. We argue, that this may be due to an instability\nof the Jahn-Teller type possibly indeed to a Peierls instability.\n", "  The one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process describes the strongly\nfluctuating dynamics of particles, freely hopping between the nearest-neighbour\nsites of a chain such that one of them disappears with probability 1 if two\nparticles meet. The exact two-time correlation and response function in the\none-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process are derived from the\nempty-interval-particle method. The main quantity is the conditional\nprobability of finding an empty interval of n consecutive sites, if at distance\nd a site is occupied by a particle. Closed equations of motion are derived such\nthat the probabilities needed for the calculation of correlators and responses,\nrespectively, are distinguished by different initial and boundary conditions.\nIn this way, the dynamical scaling of these two-time observables is analysed in\nthe longtime ageing regime. A new generalised fluctuation-dissipation ratio\nwith an universal and finite limit is proposed.\n", "  Historically, there have been many attempts to produce an appropriate\nmathematical formalism for modeling the nature of physical space, such as\nEuclid's geometry, Descartes' system of Cartesian coordinates, the Argand\nplane, Hamilton's quaternions and Gibbs' vector system using the dot and cross\nproducts. We illustrate however, that Clifford's geometric algebra (GA)\nprovides the most elegant description of physical space. Supporting this\nconclusion, we firstly show how geometric algebra subsumes the key elements of\nthe competing formalisms and secondly how it provides an intuitive\nrepresentation of the basic concepts of points, lines, areas and volumes. We\nalso provide two examples where GA has been found to provide an improved\ndescription of two key physical phenomena, electromagnetism and quantum theory,\nwithout using tensors or complex vector spaces. This paper also provides\npedagogical tutorial-style coverage of the various basic applications of\ngeometric algebra in physics.\n", "  The 'Internal Linear Combination' (ILC) component separation method has been\nextensively used to extract a single component, the CMB, from the WMAP\nmultifrequency data. We generalise the ILC approach for separating other\nmillimetre astrophysical emissions. We construct in particular a\nmultidimensional ILC filter, which can be used, for instance, to estimate the\ndiffuse emission of a complex component originating from multiple correlated\nemissions, such as the total emission of the Galactic interstellar medium. The\nperformance of such generalised ILC methods, implemented on a needlet frame, is\ntested on simulations of Planck mission observations, for which we successfully\nreconstruct a low noise estimate of emission from astrophysical foregrounds\nwith vanishing CMB and SZ contamination.\n", "  Simultaneous dense coding guarantees that Bob and Charlie simultaneously\nreceive their respective information from Alice in their respective processes\nof dense coding. The idea is to use the so-called locking operation to \"lock\"\nthe entanglement channels, thus requiring a joint unlocking operation by Bob\nand Charlie in order to simultaneously obtain the information sent by Alice. We\npresent some new results on simultaneous dense coding: (1) We propose three\nsimultaneous dense coding protocols, which use different $N$-dimensional\nentanglement (Bell state, W state and GHZ state). (2) Besides the quantum\nFourier transform, two new locking operators are introduced (the double\ncontrolled-NOT operator and the SWAP operator). (3) In the case that spatially\ndistant Bob and Charlie have to finalise the protocol by implementing the\nunlocking operation through communication, we improve our protocol's fairness,\nwith respect to Bob and Charlie, by implementing the unlocking operation in\nseries of steps. (4) We improve the security of simultaneous dense coding\nagainst the intercept-resend attack. (5) We show that simultaneous dense coding\ncan be used to implement a fair contract signing protocol. (6) We also show\nthat the $N$-dimensional quantum Fourier transform can act as the locking\noperator in simultaneous teleportation of $N$-level quantum systems.\n", "  We consider the determination of a conductivity function in a two-dimensional\ndomain from the Cauchy data of the solutions of the conductivity equation on\nthe boundary. We prove uniqueness results for this inverse problem, posed by\nCalderon, for conductivities that are degenerate, that is, they may not be\nbounded from above or below. In particular, for scalar conductivities we solve\nthe inverse problem in a class which is larger than $L^\\infty$. Also, we give\nnew counterexamples for the uniqueness of the inverse conductivity problem.\n  We say that a conductivity is visible if the inverse problem is solvable so\nthat the inside of the domain can be uniquely determined, up to a change of\ncoordinates, using the boundary measurements. The present counterexamples for\nthe inverse problem have been related to the invisibility cloaking. This means\nthat there are conductivities for which a part of the domain is shielded from\ndetection via boundary measurements. Such conductivities are called\ninvisibility cloaks.\n  In the present paper we identify the borderline of the visible conductivities\nand the borderline of invisibility cloaking conductivities. Surprisingly, these\nborderlines are not the same. We show that between the visible and the cloaking\nconductivities there are the electric holograms, conductivities which create an\nillusion of a non-existing body. The electric holograms give counterexamples\nfor the uniqueness of the inverse problem which are less degenerate than the\npreviously known ones.\n", "  We present several families of total boolean functions which have exact\nquantum query complexity which is a constant multiple (between 1/2 and 2/3) of\ntheir classical query complexity, and show that optimal quantum algorithms for\nthese functions cannot be obtained by simply computing parities of pairs of\nbits. We also characterise the model of nonadaptive exact quantum query\ncomplexity in terms of coding theory and completely characterise the query\ncomplexity of symmetric boolean functions in this context. These results were\noriginally inspired by numerically solving the semidefinite programs\ncharacterising quantum query complexity for small problem sizes. We include\nnumerical results giving the optimal success probabilities achievable by\nquantum algorithms computing all boolean functions on up to 4 bits, and all\nsymmetric boolean functions on up to 6 bits.\n", "  It is shown that the evidence asserted in the Comment [arXiv:1205.6418] on\nthe chemical composition data published by Carpinteri et al. [Strain 47 (Suppl.\n2), 282 (2011)]-that the data \"cannot be the result of independent measurements\nas claimed by the authors\" -may be not necessarily true. A simpler fact could\nexplain the identical assay values found for some of the chemical components,\nwithout this implying the asserted impossible correlations. The simpler reason\ndoes not invalidate the published numerical data, being related only to\nincorrect notation. On the other hand, it is out the scope of the present\ncomment implying any evaluation about the physical validity of the data or\nabout the conclusions drawn in the original paper.\n", "  We have studied the low-lying excitations of a chain of coupled circuit-QED\nsystems, and report several intriguing properties of its two nearly degenerate\nground states. The ground states are Schr\\\"odinger cat states at a truly large\nscale, involving maximal entanglement between the resonator and the qubit, and\nare mathematically equivalent to Majorana bound states. With a suitable design\nof physical qubits, they are protected against local fluctuations and\nconstitute a non-local qubit. Further, they can be probed and manipulated\ncoherently by attaching an empty resonator to one end of the circuit-QED chain.\n", "  Graphene has received a great deal of attention and this has more recently\nextended to boron nitride sheets (BNS) with a similar structure. Both have\nhexagonal lattices and it is only the alternation of atoms in boron nitride,\nwhich changes the symmetry structure. This difference can for example be seen\nin the mean field equations, which for the corners of the Brillouin Zone are\nDirac equations. For the case of graphene (equal atoms) we have the equation\nfor massless particles, while for Boron Nitride has a finite gap and is more\nnear a Dirac equation with mass near this gap.. Carbon structures in general\nand in particular also graphene can adsorb electron donors, such as alkaline\natoms or molecules with a dipole moment. Typically these atoms and the dipoles\ncan only attach in the sense to donate electron density. Some results for small\nsheet like structures are available.\n", "  The mass composition of high energy cosmic rays depends on their production,\nacceleration, and propagation. The study of cosmic ray composition can\ntherefore reveal hints of the origin of these particles. At the South Pole, the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory is capable of measuring two components of cosmic\nray air showers in coincidence: the electromagnetic component at high altitude\n(2835 m) using the IceTop surface array, and the muonic component above ~1 TeV\nusing the IceCube array. This unique detector arrangement provides an\nopportunity for precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and\ncomposition in the region of the knee and beyond. We present the results of a\nneural network analysis technique to study the cosmic ray composition and the\nenergy spectrum from 1 PeV to 30 PeV using data recorded using the\n40-string/40-station configuration of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n", "  IceTop, the surface component of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the\nSouth Pole, is an air shower array with an area of 1 km2. The detector allows a\ndetailed exploration of the mass composition of primary cosmic rays in the\nenergy range from about 100 TeV to 1 EeV by exploiting the correlation between\nthe shower energy measured in IceTop and the energy deposited by muons in the\ndeep ice. In this paper we report on the technical design, construction and\ninstallation, the trigger and data acquisition systems as well as the software\nframework for calibration, reconstruction and simulation. Finally the first\nexperience from commissioning and operating the detector and the performance as\nan air shower detector will be discussed.\n", "  We study a model for continuous-opinion dynamics under bounded confidence. In\nparticular, we analyze the importance of the initial distribution of opinions\nin determining the asymptotic configuration. Thus, we sketch the structure of\nattractors of the dynamical system, by means of the numerical computation of\nthe time evolution of the agents density. We show that, for a given bound of\nconfidence, a consensus can be encouraged or prevented by certain initial\nconditions. Furthermore, a noisy perturbation is added to the system with the\npurpose of modeling the free will of the agents. As a consequence, the\nimportance of the initial condition is partially replaced by that of the\nstatistical distribution of the noise. Nevertheless, we still find evidence of\nthe influence of the initial state upon the final configuration for a short\nrange of the bound of confidence parameter.\n", "  The measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in large\nCherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separating\nextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. This\ntechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially to\nlarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.\n", "  In a previous study \\cite{n} we investigate the bound states of the\nHamiltonian describing a quantum particle living on three dimensional straight\nstrip of width $d$. We impose the Neumann boundary condition on a disc window\nof radius $a$ and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the remained part of the\nboundary of the strip. We proved that such system exhibits discrete eigenvalues\nbelow the essential spectrum for any $a>0$. In the present work we study the\neffect of a magnetic filed of Aharonov-Bohm type when the magnetic field is\nturned on this system. Precisely we prove that in the presence of such magnetic\nfiled there is some critical values of $a_0>0$, for which we have absence of\nthe discrete spectrum for $\\displaystyle 0<\\frac{a}{d}<a_0$. We give a\nsufficient condition for the existence of discrete eigenvalues.\n", "  The scenario of isospin-violating dark matter (IVDM) with destructive\ninterference between DM-proton and DM-neutron scatterings provides a potential\npossibility to reconcile the experimental results of DAMA, CoGeNT and XENON. We\nexplore the constraints on the IVDM from other direct detection experiments\nsuch as CRESST and SIMPLE, etc. and from the indirect DM searches such as the\nantiproton flux measured by BESS-Polar II. The results show that the relevant\ncouplings in IVDM scenario are severely constrained.\n", "  The overarching goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that complementarity is\nat the heart of quantum information theory, that it allows us to make (some)\nsense of just what information \"quantum information\" refers to, and that it is\nuseful in understanding and constructing quantum information processing\nprotocols. The detailed research results which form the basis of these claims\nare to be found in the included papers, and the aim here is to present an\noverview comprehensible to a more general audience.\n", "  We propose a mechanism by which chloromethane and dichloromethane\ndecomposition reaction occurs on the surfaces of graphene. To this end we have\nperformed calculations on the graphene surface with metal adsorption on the\nsheet on the opposite side of reactions to reduce the formation of free-radical\nintermediates.\n", "  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, approximately 1 km^3 in size, is now\ncomplete with 86 strings deployed in the Antarctic ice. IceCube detects the\nCherenkov radiation emitted by charged particles passing through or created in\nthe ice. To realize the full potential of the detector, the properties of light\npropagation in the ice in and around the detector must be well understood. This\nreport presents a new method of fitting the model of light propagation in the\nice to a data set of in-situ light source events collected with IceCube. The\nresulting set of derived parameters, namely the measured values of scattering\nand absorption coefficients vs. depth, is presented and a comparison of IceCube\ndata with simulations based on the new model is shown.\n", "  In order to understand the interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nand star formation during the evolution of galaxies, we investigate 142\ngalaxies detected in both X-ray and 70{\\mu}m observations in the COSMOS (Cosmic\nEvolution Survey) field. All of our data are obtained from the archive, X-ray\npoint source catalogs from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations; far-infrared\n70{\\mu}m point source catalog from Spitzer-MIPS observations. Although the IRAC\n[3.6{\\mu}m]-[4.5{\\mu}m] vs. [5.8{\\mu}m]-[8.0{\\mu}m] colours of our sample\nindicate that only ~63% of our sources would be classified as AGN, the ratio of\nthe rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity to the total infrared luminosity\n(8-1000{\\mu}m) shows that all of the sample has comparatively higher X-ray\nluminosity than that expected from pure star-forming galaxies, suggesting the\npresence of an AGN in all of our sources. From the analysis of the X-ray\nhardness ratio, we find that sources with both 70{\\mu}m and X-ray detection\ntend to have a higher hardness ratio relative to the whole X-ray selected\nsource population, suggesting the presence of more X-ray absorption in the\n70{\\mu}m detected sources. In addition, we find that the observed far-infrared\ncolours of 70{\\mu}m detected sources with and without X-ray emission are\nsimilar, suggesting the far-infrared emission could be mainly powered by star\nformation.\n", "  In this paper we construct a discrete simulation of an expanding homogeneous\nand isotropic space-time that expands via expansion of its basic elements to\nfigure out properties and characteristics of such a space-time and derive\nconclusions. We prove that in such an expanding space-time, the geodesics are\ncurved and more precisely, they fluctuate on the boundaries of the expanding\nbasic elements. The non existence of privileged expansion direction leads to\nthe existence of an infinity of fluctuating geodesics between any two locations\nin this space-time, that provides a prediction of polarization in geometric\noptics, and a prediction of an earlier acceleration of the expansion as for the\ncosmic inflation model. This simulation is a case study and an example of\nspace-time with variable topology using the principle of variation of topology\nvia a transformation that creates holes.\n", "  We investigate how special relativity influences the transmission of\nclassical information through quantum channels by evaluating the Holevo bound\nwhen the sender and the receiver are in (relativistic) relative motion. By\nusing the spin degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 fermions to encode the classical\ninformation we show that, for some configurations, the accessible information\nin the receiver can be increased when the spin detector moves fast enough. This\nis possible by allowing the momentum wave packet of one of the particles to be\nwide enough while the momentum wave packets of other particles are kept\nrelatively narrow. In this way, one can take advantage of the fact that boosts\nentangle the spin and momentum degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 fermions to\nincrease the accessible information in the former. We close the paper with a\ndiscussion of how this relativistic quantum channel cannot in general be\ndescribed by completely positive quantum maps.\n", "  We report the discovery in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SDSS-III\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of seventeen broad absorption line\n(BAL) quasars with high-ionization troughs that include absorption redshifted\nrelative to the quasar rest frame. The redshifted troughs extend to velocities\nup to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.\nApproximately 1 in 1000 BAL quasars with blueshifted C IV absorption also has\nredshifted C IV absorption; objects with C IV absorption present only at\nredshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. In more than half of our\nobjects, redshifted absorption is seen in C II or Al III as well as C IV,\nmaking low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among BAL\nquasars with redshifted troughs than among standard BAL quasars. However, the C\nIV absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller than\nthose of standard BAL quasars with low-ionization absorption. We consider\nseveral possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. The two most likely\npossibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or in\ndifferent ones. Rotationally dominated outflows seen against a quasar's\nextended continuum source can produce redshifted and blueshifted absorption,\nbut variability consistent with this scenario is seen in only one of the four\nobjects with multiple spectra. The infall of relatively dense and\nlow-ionization gas to radii as small as 400 Schwarzschild radii can in\nprinciple explain the observed range of trough profiles, but current models do\nnot easily explain the origin and survival of such gas. Whatever the origin(s)\nof the absorbing gas in these objects, it must be located at small radii to\nexplain its large redshifted velocities, and thus offers a novel probe of the\ninner regions of quasars.\n", "  We study the internal kinematics of galaxy clusters in the region beyond the\nsphere of virialization. Galaxies around a virialized cluster are infalling\ntowards the cluster centre with a non-zero mean radial velocity. We develop a\nnew formalism for describing the dynamical state of clusters, by generalizing\nthe standard Jeans formalism with the inclusion of the peculiar infall motions\nof galaxies and the Hubble expansion as well as the contributions due to\nbackground cosmology. Using empirical fits to the radial profiles of density,\nmean radial velocity and velocity anisotropy of both a stacked cluster-mass\nhalo and two isolated halos of a cosmological dark matter only simulation, we\nverify that our generalized Jeans equation correctly predicts the radial\nvelocity dispersion out to 4 virial radii. We find that the radial velocity\ndispersion inferred from the standard Jeans equation is accurate up to 2 virial\nradii, but overestimated by \\approx 20% for the stacked halo and by \\approx 40%\nfor the isolated halos, in the range \\approx 2-3 virial radii. Our model\ndepends on the logarithmic growth rate of the virial radius (function of halo\nmass or concentration), which we estimate in 7 different ways, and on the\ndeparture from self-similarity of the evolution of the peculiar velocity\nprofile in virial units.\n", "  We present the results of a search for neutrino point sources using the\nIceCube data collected between April 2008 and May 2011 with three partially\ncompleted configurations of the detector: the 40-, 59- and 79-string\nconfigurations. The live-time of this data set are 1,040 days. An unbinned\nmaximum likelihood ratio test was used to search for an excess of neutrinos\nabove the atmospheric background at any given direction in the sky. By adding\ntwo more years of data with improved event selection and reconstruction\ntechniques, the sensitivity was improved by a factor 3.5 or more with respect\nto the previously published results obtained with the 40-string configuration\nof IceCube. We performed an all-sky survey and a dedicated search using a\ncatalog of \\textit{a priori} selected objects observed by other telescopes. In\nboth searches, the data are compatible with the background-only hypothesis. In\nthe absence of evidence for a signal, we set upper limits on the flux of muon\nneutrinos. For an E$^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum, the observed limits are between\n0.9 and $23.2\\times 10^{-12}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. We also report\nupper limits for neutrino emission from groups of sources which were selected\naccording to theoretical models or observational parameters and analysed with a\nstacking approach.\n", "  Fluctuation geometry was recently proposed as a counterpart approach of\nRiemannian geometry of inference theory. This theory describes the geometric\nfeatures of the statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ of random events that are\ndescribed by a family of continuous distributions $dp(x|\\theta)$. A main goal\nof this work is to clarify the statistical relevance of Levi-Civita curvature\ntensor $R_{ijkl}(x|\\theta)$ of the statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}$. For this\npurpose, the notion of \\emph{irreducible statistical correlations} is\nintroduced. Specifically, a distribution $dp(x|\\theta)$ exhibits irreducible\nstatistical correlations if every distribution $dp(\\check{x}|\\theta)$ obtained\nfrom $dp(x|\\theta)$ by considering a coordinate change $\\check{x}=\\phi(x)$\ncannot be factorized into independent distributions as\n$dp(\\check{x}|\\theta)=\\prod_{i}dp^{(i)}(\\check{x}^{i}|\\theta)$. It is shown\nthat the curvature tensor $R_{ijkl}(x|\\theta)$ arises as a direct indicator\nabout the existence of irreducible statistical correlations. Moreover, the\ncurvature scalar $R(x|\\theta)$ allows to introduce a criterium for the\napplicability of the \\emph{gaussian approximation} of a given distribution\nfunction. This type of asymptotic result is obtained in the framework of the\nsecond-order geometric expansion of the distributions family $dp(x|\\theta)$,\nwhich appears as a counterpart development of the high-order asymptotic theory\nof statistical estimation. In physics, fluctuation geometry represents the\nmathematical apparatus of a Riemannian extension for Einstein's fluctuation\ntheory of statistical mechanics. Some exact results of fluctuation geometry are\nnow employed to derive the \\emph{invariant fluctuation theorems}.\n", "  The IceCube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep natural\nAntarctic ice into a Cherenkov detector. Muon neutrinos are detected and their\ndirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon track\ninside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. Reconstructing the muon\ntrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering in\nthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muons\ninside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. This\nmanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstruction\nproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover the\ntrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determine\nhow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. Rather than\nsolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that are\napplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment the\ndetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statistical\ntechniques. These can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstruction\nand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. Using the metric of\nmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, we\nimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. We also\npresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: we\ncan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.\n", "  The research in quantum gravity has jauntily grown in the recent years,\nintersecting with conceptual and philosophical issues that have a long history.\nIn this paper I analyze the conceptual basis on which Loop Quantum Gravity has\ngrown, the way it deals with some classical problems of philosophy of science\nand the main methodological and philosophical assumptions on which it is based.\nIn particular, I emphasize the importance that atomism (in the broadest sense)\nand relationalism have had in the construction of the theory.\n", "  Fluctuations in the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) and the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe\neach contain clues about the nature of the earliest moments of time. The next\ngeneration of CMB and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments are poised to\ntest the leading paradigm for these earliest moments---the theory of cosmic\ninflation---and to detect the imprints of the inflationary epoch, thereby\ndramatically increasing our understanding of fundamental physics and the early\nuniverse.\n  A future CMB experiment with sufficient angular resolution and frequency\ncoverage that surveys at least 1% of the sky to a depth of 1 uK-arcmin can\ndeliver a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that will either result in a\n5-sigma measurement of the energy scale of inflation or rule out all\nlarge-field inflation models, even in the presence of foregrounds and the\ngravitational lensing B-mode signal. LSS experiments, particularly\nspectroscopic surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, will\ncomplement the CMB effort by improving current constraints on running of the\nspectral index by up to a factor of four, improving constraints on curvature by\na factor of ten, and providing non-Gaussianity constraints that are competitive\nwith the current CMB bounds.\n", "  We use an on-chip superconducting resonator as a sensitive meter to probe the\nproperties of graphene double quantum dots at microwave frequencies.\nSpecifically, we investigate the charge dephasing rates in a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics architecture. The dephasing rates strongly depend on the number\nof charges in the dots, and the variation has a period of four charges, over an\nextended range of charge numbers. Although the exact mechanism of this fourfold\nperiodicity in dephasing rates is an open problem, our observations hint at the\nfourfold degeneracy expected in graphene from its spin and valley degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  We consider a two-parameter family of R\\'enyi relative entropies\n$D_{\\alpha,z}(\\rho||\\sigma)$ that are quantum generalisations of the classical\nR\\'enyi divergence $D_{\\alpha}(p||q)$. This family includes many known relative\nentropies (or divergences) such as the quantum relative entropy, the recently\ndefined quantum R\\'enyi divergences, as well as the quantum R\\'enyi relative\nentropies. All its members satisfy the quantum generalizations of R\\'enyi's\naxioms for a divergence. We consider the range of the parameters $\\alpha,z$ for\nwhich the data processing inequality holds. We also investigate a variety of\nlimiting cases for the two parameters, obtaining explicit formulas for each one\nof them.\n", "  A previously unknown optical transient (OT 120926) has been observed in the\nconstellation Bootes. The transient flared to magnitude 4.7, which is\ncomparable to the visual magnitudes of the nearby stars $\\pi$ Boo and\n$\\omicron$ Boo. Database searches do not yield an unambiguous identification of\na quiescent counterpart of this transient but do identify several candidates.\nHowever, none of the candidate stellar counterparts have shown any credible\nevidence of previous variability in the All-Sky Automated Survey or the\nCatalina Real-time Transient Survey. A flare on the nearby high proper motion,\nprobable M dwarf star LP 440-48 could have produced OT 120926, but the\namplitude of the flare would be an unprecedented 11.3 magnitudes. The current\nrecord amplitude for such flares on M dwarfs is 9.5 magnitudes.\n", "  We report on the search for neutrino-induced particle-showers, so-called\ncascades, in the IceCube-40 detector. The data for this search was collected\nbetween April 2008 and May 2009 when the first 40 IceCube strings were deployed\nand operational. Three complementary searches were performed, each optimized\nfor different energy regimes. The analysis with the lowest energy threshold (2\nTeV) targeted atmospheric neutrinos. A total of 67 events were found,\nconsistent with the expectation of 41 atmospheric muons and 30 atmospheric\nneutrino events. The two other analyses targeted a harder, astrophysical\nneutrino flux. The analysis with an intermediate threshold of 25 TeV lead to\nthe observation of 14 cascade-like events, again consistent with the prediction\nof 3.0 atmospheric neutrino and 7.7 atmospheric muon events. We hence set an\nupper limit of $E^2 \\Phi_{lim} \\leq 7.46\\times10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{GeV sr^{-1}\ns^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ (90% C.L.) on the diffuse flux from astrophysical neutrinos of\nall neutrino flavors, applicable to the energy range 25 TeV to 5 PeV, assuming\nan $E_{\\nu}^{-2}$ spectrum and a neutrino flavor ratio of 1:1:1 at the Earth.\nThe third analysis utilized a larger and optimized sample of atmospheric muon\nbackground simulation, leading to a higher energy threshold of 100 TeV. Three\nevents were found over a background prediction of 0.04 atmospheric muon events\nand 0.21 events from the flux of conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos.\nIncluding systematic errors this corresponds to a $2.7\\sigma$ excess with\nrespect to the background-only hypothesis. Our observation of neutrino event\ncandidates above 100 TeV complements IceCube's recently observed evidence for\nhigh-energy astrophysical neutrinos.\n", "  We compare of the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) saturation during magnetic\nstorms induced by various types of the solar wind drivers. By using the model\nof Siscoe-Hill\n\\citep{Hilletal1976,Siscoeetal2002a,Siscoeetal2002b,Siscoeetal2004,Siscoe2011}\nwe evaluate criteria of the CPCP saturation during the main phases of 257\nmagnetic storms ($Dst_{min} \\le -50$ nT) induced by the following types of the\nsolar wind streams: magnetic clouds (MC), Ejecta, the compress region Sheath\nbefore MC ($Sh_{MC}$) and before Ejecta ($Sh_{E}$), corotating interaction\nregions (CIR) and indeterminate type (IND). Our analysis shows that occurrence\nrate of the CPCP saturation is higher for storms induced by ICME ($13.2%$) than\nfor storms driven by CIR ($3.5%$) or by IND ($3.5%$).The CPCP saturation was\nobtained more often for storms initiated by MC ($25%$) than by Ejecta ($2.9%$);\nit was obtained for $8.6%$ of magnetic storms induced by sum of MC and Ejecta,\nand for $21.5%$ magnetic storms induced by Sheath before them (sum of $Sh_{MC}$\nand $Sh_{E}$). These results allow us to conclude that occurrence rate of the\nCPCP saturation at the main phase of magnetic storms depends on the type of the\nsolar wind stream.\n", "  We study Einstein's equations with an isotropic but inhomogeneous metric in\nthe cosmic rest frame. The equations are solved perturbatively in the late\nUniverse. The leading plus next-to-leading order results agree with\nobservations without using a cosmological constant or dark matter.\n", "  We combine user-centric Twitter data with video-centric YouTube data to\nanalyze who watches and shares what on YouTube. Combination of two data sets,\nwith 87k Twitter users, 5.6mln YouTube videos and 15mln video sharing events,\nallows rich analysis going beyond what could be obtained with either of the two\ndata sets individually. For Twitter, we generate user features relating to\nactivity, interests and demographics. For YouTube, we obtain video features for\ntopic, popularity and polarization. These two feature sets are combined through\nsharing events for YouTube URLs on Twitter. This combination is done both in a\nuser-, a video- and a sharing-event-centric manner. For the user-centric\nanalysis, we show how Twitter user features correlate both with YouTube\nfeatures and with sharing-related features. As two examples, we show urban\nusers are quicker to share than rural users and for some notions of \"influence\"\ninfluential users on Twitter share videos with a higher number of views. For\nthe video-centric analysis, we find a superlinear relation between initial\nTwitter shares and the final amounts of views, showing the correlated behavior\nof Twitter. On user impact, we find the total amount of followers of users that\nshared the video in the first week does not affect its final popularity.\nHowever, aggregated user retweet rates serve as a better predictor for YouTube\nvideo popularity. For the sharing-centric analysis, we reveal existence of\ncorrelated behavior concerning the time between video creation and sharing\nwithin certain timescales, showing the time onset for a coherent response, and\nthe time limit after which collective responses are extremely unlikely. We show\nthat response times depend on video category, revealing that Twitter sharing of\na video is highly dependent on its content. To the best of our knowledge this\nis the first large-scale study combining YouTube and Twitter data.\n", "  We perform ab-initio calculations needed to predict the cross-section of an\nexperimentally accessible (1+1') resonance-enhanced multiphoton dissociation\n(REMPD) pathway in AlH+. Experimenting on AlH+ ions held in a radiofrequency\nPaul trap, we confirm dissociation via this channel with analysis performed\nusing time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the use of REMPD for\nrotational state analysis, and we measure the rotational distribution of\ntrapped AlH+ to be consistent with the expected thermal distribution. AlH+ is a\nparticularly interesting species for ion trap work because of its electronic\nlevel structure, which makes it amenable to proposals for rotational optical\npumping, direct Doppler cooling, and single-molecule fluorescence detection.\nPotential applications of trapped AlH+ include searches for time-varying\nconstants, quantum information processing, and ultracold chemistry studies.\n", "  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a large Cherenkov detector instrumenting\n$1\\,\\mathrm{km}^3$ of Antarctic ice. The detector can be used to search for\nsignatures of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Here, we describe the\nsearch for non-relativistic, magnetic monopoles as remnants of the GUT (Grand\nUnified Theory) era shortly after the Big Bang. These monopoles may catalyze\nthe decay of nucleons via the Rubakov-Callan effect with a cross section\nsuggested to be in the range of $10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$ to\n$10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. In IceCube, the Cherenkov light from nucleon decays\nalong the monopole trajectory would produce a characteristic hit pattern. This\npaper presents the results of an analysis of first data taken from May 2011\nuntil May 2012 with a dedicated slow-particle trigger for DeepCore, a\nsubdetector of IceCube. A second analysis provides better sensitivity for the\nbrightest non-relativistic monopoles using data taken from May 2009 until May\n2010. In both analyses no monopole signal was observed. For catalysis cross\nsections of $10^{-22}\\,(10^{-24})\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$ the flux of non-relativistic\nGUT monopoles is constrained up to a level of $\\Phi_{90} \\le\n10^{-18}\\,(10^{-17})\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}}$ at a 90% confidence level,\nwhich is three orders of magnitude below the Parker bound. The limits assume a\ndominant decay of the proton into a positron and a neutral pion. These results\nimprove the current best experimental limits by one to two orders of magnitude,\nfor a wide range of assumed speeds and catalysis cross sections.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of BaTi$_{2}$As$_{2}$O have been\ninvestigated using both the first-principles and analytical methods. The\nfull-potential linearized augmented plane-wave calculations show that the most\nstable state is a site-selective antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal with a\n$\\text{2}\\times \\text{1}\\times \\text{1}$ magnetic unit cell containing two\nnonmagnetic Ti atoms and two other Ti atoms with antiparallel moments. Further\nanalysis to Fermi surface and spin susceptibility shows that the site-selective\nAFM ground state is driven by the Fermi surface nesting and the Coulomb\ncorrelation. Meanwhile, the charge density distribution remains uniform,\nsuggesting that the phase transition at $200$ K in experiment is a\nspin-density-wave (SDW) transition.\n", "  Past studies have identified a spatially extended excess of $\\sim$1-3 GeV\ngamma rays from the region surrounding the Galactic Center, consistent with the\nemission expected from annihilating dark matter. We revisit and scrutinize this\nsignal with the intention of further constraining its characteristics and\norigin. By applying cuts to the \\textit{Fermi} event parameter CTBCORE, we\nsuppress the tails of the point spread function and generate high resolution\ngamma-ray maps, enabling us to more easily separate the various gamma-ray\ncomponents. Within these maps, we find the GeV excess to be robust and highly\nstatistically significant, with a spectrum, angular distribution, and overall\nnormalization that is in good agreement with that predicted by simple\nannihilating dark matter models. For example, the signal is very well fit by a\n36-51 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ with an annihilation\ncross section of $\\sigma v = (1-3)\\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s (normalized to a\nlocal dark matter density of 0.4 GeV/cm$^3$). Furthermore, we confirm that the\nangular distribution of the excess is approximately spherically symmetric and\ncentered around the dynamical center of the Milky Way (within\n$\\sim$$0.05^{\\circ}$ of Sgr A$^*$), showing no sign of elongation along the\nGalactic Plane. The signal is observed to extend to at least $\\simeq10^{\\circ}$\nfrom the Galactic Center, disfavoring the possibility that this emission\noriginates from millisecond pulsars.\n", "  Using methods of condensed matter and statistical physics, we examine the\ntransport of excitons through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex from a\nreceiving antenna to a reaction center. Writing the equations of motion for the\nexciton creation/annihilation operators, we are able to describe the exciton\ndynamics, even in the regime when the reorganization energy is of the order of\nthe intra-system couplings. In particular, we obtain the well-known quantum\noscillations of the site populations. We determine the exciton transfer\nefficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment. While\nthe majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath, we\naddress the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and\nexamine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy\ntransfer efficiency. We find that, for the vibronic frequencies below 16 meV,\nthe exciton transfer is drastically suppressed. We attribute this effect to the\nformation of \"polaronic states\" where the exciton is transferred back and forth\nbetween the two pigments with the absorption/emission of the vibronic quanta,\ninstead of proceeding to the reaction center. The same effect suppresses the\nquantum beating at the vibronic frequency of 25 meV. We also show that the\nefficiency of the energy transfer can be enhanced when the vibronic mode\nstrongly couples to the third pigment only, instead of coupling to the entire\nsystem.\n", "  The quantum correlation of octave-spanning time-energy entangled bi-photons\ncan be as short as a single optical cycle. Many experiments designed to explore\nand exploit this correlation require a uniform spectral phase\n(transform-limited) with very low loss. So far, transform-limited single-cycle\nbi-photons were not demonstrated, primarily due to lack of precision control of\nthe spectral phase. Here, we demonstrate precise correction of the\nspectral-phase of near-octave bi-photons to less than ($<\\pi/20$) (residual\nphase) over nearly a full octave in frequency ($\\approx1330-2600$ nm). Using a\nprism-pair with an effectively-negative separation, we obtain tuned, very\nlow-loss compensation of both the 2nd and 4th dispersion orders. We verify the\nbi-photons spectral phase directly, using a non-classical bi-photon\ninterference effect.\n", "  Optical oscillators present a powerful optimization mechanism. The inherent\ncompetition for the gain resources between possible modes of oscillation\nentails the prevalence of the most efficient single mode. We harness this\n'ultrafast' coherent feedback to optimize an optical field \\emph{in time}, and\nshow that when an optical oscillator based on a molecular gain medium is\nsynchronously-pumped by ultrashort pulses, a temporally coherent multi mode\nfield can develop that optimally dumps a general, dynamically-evolving\nvibrational wave-packet, into a \\emph{single vibrational target state}.\nMeasuring the emitted field opens a new window to visualization and control of\nfast molecular dynamics. The realization of such a coherent oscillator with hot\nalkali dimers appears within experimental reach.\n", "  An analytical framework is presented to understand the effects of a\nfluctuating intensity of the cosmic ionising background on the correlations of\nthe Ly{\\alpha} forest transmission fraction measured in quasar spectra. In the\nabsence of intensity fluctuations, the Ly{\\alpha} power spectrum should have\nthe expected cold dark matter power spectrum with redshift distortions in the\nlinear regime, with a bias factor b_{\\delta} and a redshift distortion\nparameter {\\beta} that depend on redshift but are independent of scale. The\nintensity fluctuations introduce a scale dependence in both b_{\\delta} and\n{\\beta}, but keeping their product b_{\\delta}{\\beta} fixed. Observations of the\nLy{\\alpha} correlations and cross-correlations with radiation sources like\nthose being done at present in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III (Busca et al. 2013;\nSlosar et al. 2013; Font-Ribera et al. 2014) have the potential to measure this\nscale dependence, which reflects the biasing properties of the sources and\nabsorbers of the ionising background. We also compute a second term affecting\nthe Ly{\\alpha} spectrum, due to shot noise in the sources of radiation. This\nterm is very large if luminous quasars are assumed to produce the ionising\nbackground and to emit isotropically with a constant luminosity, but should be\nreduced by a contribution from galaxies, and by the finite lifetime and\nanisotropic emission of quasars.\n", "  We argue that, under certain plausible assumptions, de Sitter space settles\ninto a quiescent vacuum in which there are no dynamical quantum fluctuations.\nSuch fluctuations require either an evolving microstate, or time-dependent\nhistories of out-of-equilibrium recording devices, which we argue are absent in\nstationary states. For a massive scalar field in a fixed de Sitter background,\nthe cosmic no-hair theorem implies that the state of the patch approaches the\nvacuum, where there are no fluctuations. We argue that an analogous conclusion\nholds whenever a patch of de Sitter is embedded in a larger theory with an\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert space, including semiclassical quantum gravity\nwith false vacua or complementarity in theories with at least one Minkowski\nvacuum. This reasoning provides an escape from the Boltzmann brain problem in\nsuch theories. It also implies that vacuum states do not uptunnel to\nhigher-energy vacua and that perturbations do not decohere while slow-roll\ninflation occurs, suggesting that eternal inflation is much less common than\noften supposed. On the other hand, if a de Sitter patch is a closed system with\na finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there will be Poincare recurrences and\ndynamical Boltzmann fluctuations into lower-entropy states. Our analysis does\nnot alter the conventional understanding of the origin of density fluctuations\nfrom primordial inflation, since reheating naturally generates a high-entropy\nenvironment and leads to decoherence, nor does it affect the existence of\nnon-dynamical vacuum fluctuations such as those that give rise to the Casimir\neffect.\n", "  Basal-plane stacking faults are an important class of optically active\nstructural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H\nstacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound\nstate in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of\nexcitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking\nfaults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons\nwith characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of\ndetecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite\ncrystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence\nproperties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated\nwith different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these\nenergies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined\nStark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from\nthe spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is\nextended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other\nfactors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related\npeaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The\nconsiderations presented in this article should be transferable also to other\nwurtzite semiconductors.\n", "  A recent expansion of cold and ultracold molecule applications has led to\nrenewed focus on molecular species preparation under ultrahigh vacuum\nconditions. Meanwhile, molecular beams have been used to study gas phase\nchemical reactions for decades. In this manuscript, we describe an apparatus\nthat uses pulsed molecular beam technology to achieve high local gas densities,\nleading to faster reaction rates with cold trapped ions. We characterize the\nbeam's spatial profile using the trapped ions themselves. This apparatus could\nbe used for preparation of molecular species by reactions requiring excitation\nof trapped ion precursors to states with short lifetimes or for obtaining a\nhigh reaction rate with minimal increase of background chamber pressure.\n", "  We present results on searches for point-like sources of neutrinos using four\nyears of IceCube data, including the first year of data from the completed\n86-string detector. The total livetime of the combined dataset is 1,373 days.\nFor an E$^{-2}$ spectrum the median sensitivity at 90\\% C.L. is $\\sim 10^{-12}$\nTeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 1 TeV$-$1 PeV in the northern\nsky and $\\sim 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 100\nTeV $-$ 100 PeV in the southern sky. The sensitivity has improved from both the\nadditional year of data and the introduction of improved reconstructions\ncompared to previous publications. In addition, we present the first results\nfrom an all-sky search for extended sources of neutrinos. We update results of\nsearches for neutrino emission from stacked catalogs of sources, and test five\nnew catalogs; two of Galactic supernova remnants and three of active galactic\nnuclei. In all cases, the data are compatible with the background-only\nhypothesis, and upper limits on the flux of muon neutrinos are reported for the\nsources considered.\n", "  Using a variational Monte Carlo method, we investigate the nematic state in\niron-base superconductors based on a three-band Hubbard model. Our results\ndemonstrate that the nematic state, formed by introducing an anisotropic\nhopping order into the projected wave function, can arise in the underdoped\nregime when a realistic off-site Coulomb interaction $V$ is considered. {\\color\n{red} We demonstrate that the off-site Coulomb interaction $V$, which is\nneglected so far in the analysis of iron-base superconductors, make a dominant\ncontribution to the stabilization of nematic state. We calculate the doping\ndependencies of the anisotropic properties such as the unequal occupation of\n$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, anisotropies of kinetic energy and spin\ncorrelations, and show that they are all suppressed upon electron doping, which\nare consistent with the intrinsic anisotropies observed by optical spectrum\nmeasurement and ARPES experiments.\n", "  Fluid motion in tanks is usually described in space industry with the\nso-called Lomen hypothesis which assumes the vorticity is null in the moving\nframe. We establish in this contribution that this hypothesis is valid only for\nuniform rotational motions. We give a more general formulation of this coupling\nproblem, with a compact formulation. We consider the mechanical modeling of a\nrigid body with a motion of small amplitude, containing an incompressible fluid\nin the linearized regime. We first establish that the fluid motion remains\nirrotational in a Galilean referential if it is true at the initial time. When\ncontinuity of normal velocity and pressure are prescribed on the free surface,\nwe establish that the global coupled problem conserves an energy functional\ncomposed by three terms. We introduce the Stokes - Zhukovsky vector fields,\nsolving Neumann problems for the Laplace operator in the fluid in order to\nrepresent the rotational rigid motion with irrotational vector fields. Then we\nhave a good framework to consider the coupled problem between the fluid and the\nrigid motion. The coupling between the free surface and the ad hoc component of\nthe velocity potential introduces a \"Neumann to Dirichlet\" operator that allows\nto write the coupled system in a very compact form. The final expression of a\nLagrangian for the coupled system is derived and the Euler-Lagrange equations\nof the coupled motion are presented.\n", "  We derive frequency correlation and exit probability expressions for photons\ngenerated via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in nonlinear\nwaveguides that exhibit linear scattering loss. Such loss is included within a\ngeneral Hamiltonian formalism by connecting waveguide modes to reservoir modes\nwith a phenomenological coupling Hamiltonian, the parameters of which are later\nrelated to the usual loss coefficients. In the limit of a low probability of\nSPDC pair production, the presence of loss requires that we write the usual\nlossless generated pair state as a reduced density operator, and we find that\nthis density operator is naturally composed of two photon, one photon, and zero\nphoton contributions. The biphoton probability density, or joint spectral\nintensity (JSI), associated with the two-photon contribution is determined not\nonly by a phase matching term, but also by a loss matching term. The relative\nsize of the loss coefficients within this term lead to three qualitatively\ndifferent regimes of SPDC JSIs. If either the pump or generated photon loss is\nmuch higher than the other, the side lobes of the phase matching squared sinc\nfunction are washed out. On the other hand, if pump and generated photon loss\nare appropriately balanced, the lossy JSI is identical to the lossless JSI.\nFinally, if the generated photon loss is frequency dependent, the shape of the\nJSI can be altered more severely, potentially leading to generated photons that\nare less frequency correlated though also produced less efficiently when\ncompared to photons generated in low-loss waveguides.\n", "  On a warped five-dimensional Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW)\nspacetime, dark energy can be induced by a U(1) scalar-gauge field on the\nbrane. We consider a zero effective cosmological constant, i.e., the\nRandall-Sundrum(RS) fine-tuning and no bulk matter fields. The standard model\nfields interact via the bulk Weyl tensor and cause brane fluctuations. Due to\nthe warp factor, disturbances don't fade away during the expansion of the\nuniverse. The late-time behavior could be significant deviate from the standard\nevolution of the universe. The effect is triggered by the time-dependent part\nof the warp factor. The self-gravitating cosmic string builds up a huge mass\nper unit length in the bulk and can induce massive KK-modes felt on the brane.\nFrom a nonlinear perturbation analysis it is found that the effective Einstein\nequations contain a \"back-reaction\" term on the righthand side caused by the\nprojected 5D Weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. The propagation\nequations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fields show\nexplicit $\\varphi$-dependency.\n", "  A closed expression is given for the generating function of (virtual)\nPoincar\\'e polynomials of moduli spaces of semi-stable sheaves on the\nprojective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$ with arbitrary rank $r$ and Chern classes. This\ngenerating function is known to equal the partition function of topologically\ntwisted gauge theory with $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry and gauge group $U(r)$,\nwhich localizes on the Hermitian Yang-Mills solutions of the gauge field. To\nclassify and study the novel generating functions, the notion of Appell\nfunctions with signature $(n_+,n_-)$ is introduced. For $n_-=1$, these novel\nfunctions reduce to the known class of Appell functions with multiple variables\nor higher level.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of coupled condensate formation dynamics on the\nhistory of initial stochastic domain formation in the context of\ninstantaneously quenched elongated harmonically-trapped immiscible\ntwo-component atomic Bose gases. The spontaneous generation of defects in the\nfastest condensing component, and subsequent coarse-graining dynamics, can lead\nto a deep oscillating microtrap into which the other component condenses,\nthereby establishing a long-lived composite defect in the form of a dark-bright\nsolitary wave. We numerically map out diverse key aspects of these competing\ngrowth dynamics, focussing on the role of shot-to-shot fluctuations and global\nparameter changes (initial state choices, quench parameters and condensate\ngrowth rates). We conclude that phase-separated structures observable on\nexperimental timescales are likely to be metastable states whose form is\ninfluenced by the stability and dynamics of the spontaneously-emerging\ndark-bright solitary wave.\n", "  Intrinsic discrete nature in thermodynamic properties of Fermi gases appears\nunder strongly confined and degenerate conditions. For a rectangular\nconfinement domain, thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas are\nexpressed in their exact summation forms. For 1D, 2D and 3D nano domains,\nvariations of both number of particles and internal energy per particle with\nchemical potential are examined. It is shown that their relation with chemical\npotential exhibits a discrete nature which allows them to take only some\ndefinite values. Furthermore, quasi-irregular oscillatory-like sharp peaks are\nobserved in heat capacity. New nano devices can be developed based on these\nbehaviors.\n", "  In this work, we propose an alternative stochastic model for the fundamental\ndiagram of traffic flow with minimal number of parameters. Our approach is\nbased on a mesoscopic viewpoint of the traffic system in terms of the dynamics\nof vehicle speed transitions. A key feature of the present approach lies in its\nstochastic nature which makes it possible to study not only the\nflow-concentration relation, namely, the fundamental diagram, but also its\nuncertainty, namely, the variance of the fundamental diagram \\textemdash an\nimportant characteristic in the observed traffic flow data. It is shown that in\nthe simplified versions of the model consisting of only a few speed states,\nanalytic solutions for both quantities can be obtained, which facilitate the\ndiscussion of the corresponding physical content. We also show that the effect\nof vehicle size can be included into the model by introducing the maximal\ncongestion density $k_{max}$. By making use of this parameter, the free flow\nregion and congested flow region are naturally divided, and the transition is\ncharacterized by the capacity drop at the maximum of the flow-concentration\nrelation. The model parameters are then adjusted to the observed traffic flow\non the I-80 Freeway Dataset in the San Francisco area from the NGSIM program,\nwhere both the fundamental diagram and its variance are reasonably reproduced.\nDespite its simplicity, we argue that the current model provides an alternative\ndescription for the fundamental diagram and its uncertainty in the study of\ntraffic flow.\n", "  We investigate the nature of excitons bound to I1 basal-plane stacking faults\n[(I1;X)] in GaN nanowire ensembles by continuous-wave and time-resolved\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy. Based on the linear increase of the radiative\nlifetime of these excitons with temperature, they are demonstrated to exhibit a\ntwo-dimensional density of states, i. e., a basal-plane stacking fault acts as\na quantum well. From the slope of the linear increase, we determine the\noscillator strength of the (I1;X) and show that the value obtained reflects the\npresence of large internal electrostatic fields across the stacking fault.\nWhile the recombination of donor-bound and free excitons in the GaN nanowire\nensemble is dominated by nonradiative phenonema already at 10 K, we observe\nthat the (I1;X) recombines purely radiatively up to 60 K. This finding provides\nimportant insight into the nonradiative recombination processes in GaN\nnanowires. First, the radiative lifetime of about 6 ns measured at 60 K sets an\nupper limit for the surface recombination velocity of 450 cm/s considering the\nnanowires mean diameter of 105 nm. Second, the density of nonradiative centers\nresponsible for the fast decay of donor-bound and free excitons cannot be\nhigher than 2x10^16 cm^-3. As a consequence, the nonradiative decay of\ndonor-bound excitons in these GaN nanowire ensembles has to occur indirectly\nvia the free exciton state.\n", "  In these lectures I give an introduction to the quantum physics of black\nholes, including recent developments based on quantum information theory such\nas the firewall paradox and its various cousins. I also give an introduction to\nholography and the AdS/CFT correspondence, focusing on those aspects which are\nrelevant for the black hole information problem.\n", "  Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging approach for studies\nand novel treatments of major depressive disorder (MDD). EEG performed\nsimultaneously with an rtfMRI-nf procedure allows an independent evaluation of\nrtfMRI-nf brain modulation effects. Frontal EEG asymmetry in the alpha band is\na widely used measure of emotion and motivation that shows profound changes in\ndepression. However, it has never been directly related to simultaneously\nacquired fMRI data. We report the first study investigating\nelectrophysiological correlates of the rtfMRI-nf procedure, by combining\nrtfMRI-nf with simultaneous and passive EEG recordings. In this pilot study,\nMDD patients in the experimental group (n=13) learned to upregulate BOLD\nactivity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion\ninduction task. MDD patients in the control group (n=11) were provided with a\nsham rtfMRI-nf. Correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry in the upper alpha\nband and BOLD activity across the brain were examined. Average individual\nchanges in frontal EEG asymmetry during the rtfMRI-nf task for the experimental\ngroup showed a significant positive correlation with the MDD patients'\ndepression severity ratings, consistent with an inverse correlation between the\ndepression severity and frontal EEG asymmetry at rest. Temporal correlations\nbetween frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced,\nduring the rtfMRI-nf task, for the amygdala and many regions associated with\nemotion regulation. Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala\nBOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry. Our EEG asymmetry results suggest that\nthe rtfMRI-nf training targeting the amygdala is beneficial to MDD patients,\nand that alpha-asymmetry EEG-nf would be compatible with the amygdala\nrtfMRI-nf. Combination of the two could enhance emotion regulation training and\nbenefit MDD patients.\n", "  We present the development and application of a generic analysis scheme for\nthe measurement of neutrino spectra with the IceCube detector. This scheme is\nbased on regularized unfolding, preceded by an event selection which uses a\nMinimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm to select the relevant variables\nand a Random Forest for the classification of events. The analysis has been\ndeveloped using IceCube data from the 59-string configuration of the detector.\n27,771 neutrino candidates were detected in 346 days of livetime. A rejection\nof 99.9999% of the atmospheric muon background is achieved. The energy spectrum\nof the atmospheric neutrino flux is obtained using the TRUEE unfolding program.\nThe unfolded spectrum of atmospheric muon neutrinos covers an energy range from\n100 GeV to 1 PeV. Compared to the previous measurement using the detector in\nthe 40-string configuration, the analysis presented here, extends the upper end\nof the atmospheric neutrino spectrum by more than a factor of two, reaching an\nenergy region that has not been previously accessed by spectral measurements.\n", "  In this paper is studied HC-model on a Cayley tree and under some conditions\non parameters of the HC-model we prove existence of the weakly periodic (non\nperiodic) Gibbs measures for normal divisor of the index four.\n", "  In this article Denis Diderot's Fifth Memoir of 1748 on the problem of a\npendulum damped by air resistance is discussed. Diderot wrote the Memoir in\norder to clarify an assumption Newton made without further justification in the\nfirst pages of the Principia in connection with an experiment to verify the\nThird Law of Motion using colliding pendulums. To explain the differences\nbetween experimental and theoretical values of momentum in the collision\nexperiments he conducted Newton assumed that the bob was retarded by an air\nresistance $F_R$ proportional to the velocity $v$. By giving Newton's arguments\na mathematical scaffolding and recasting his geometrical reasoning in the\nlanguage of differential calculus, Diderot provides a step-by-step solution\nguide to the problem and proposes experiments to settle the question about the\nappropriate form of $F_R$, which for Diderot quadratic in $v$, that is $F_R\n\\sim v^2$.\n  The solution of Diderot is presented in full detail and his results are\ncompared to those obtained from a Lindstedt-Poincare approximation for an\noscillator with quadratic damping. It is shown that, up to a prefactor, both\ncoincide. Some results that one can derive from his approach are presented and\ndiscussed for the first time. Experimental evidence to support Diderot's or\nNewton's claims is discussed together with the limitations of their solutions.\nSome misprints in the original memoir are pointed out.\n", "  The surface exponents, the scaling behavior and the bulk porosity of a\ngeneralized ballistic deposition (GBD) model are studied. In nature, there\nexist particles with varying degrees of stickiness ranging from completely\nnon-sticky to fully sticky. Such particles may adhere to any one of the\nsuccessively encountered surfaces, depending on a sticking probability %should\nhave the possibility of sticking to any of the %allowed points of contact on\nthe surface with a sticking probability that is governed by the underlying\nstochastic mechanism. The microscopic configurations possible in this model are\nmuch larger than those allowed in existing models of ballistic deposition and\ncompetitive growth models that seek to mix ballistic and random deposition\nprocesses. In this article, we find the scaling exponents for surface width and\nporosity for the proposed GBD model. In terms of scaled width $\\widetilde{W}$\nand scaled time $\\tilde{t}$, the numerical data collapse on to a single curve,\ndemonstrating successful scaling with sticking probability p and system size L.\nSimilar scaling behavior is also found for the porosity.\n", "  We consider a many body fermionic system with an incommensurate external\npotential and a short range interaction in one dimension. We prove that, for\ncertain densities and weak interactions, the zero temperature thermodynamical\ncorrelations are exponentially decaying for large distances, a property\nindicating persistence of localization in the interacting ground state. The\nanalysis is based on Renormalization Group, and convergence of the renormalized\nexpansion is achieved using fermionic cancellations and controlling the small\ndivisor problem assuming a Diophantine condition for the frequency.\n", "  Tuning the chain-end functionality of a short-chain cationic homopolymer,\nowing to the nature of the initiator used in the ATRP polymerisation step, can\nbe used to mediate the formation of a gel of this poly(electrolyte) in water.\nWhile a neutral end group gives a solution of low viscosity, a highly\nhomogeneous gel is obtained with a phosphonate anionic moiety, as characterized\nby rheometry and diffusion NMR. This novel type of supramolecular control over\npoly(electrolytic) gel formation could find potential use in a variety of\napplications in the field of electroactive materials.\n", "  We compare the effects of turning off and turning on the T=0 interaction on\nthe spectra of 92Pd and 48Cr--both 8 particle systems. We find qualitative\ndifferences for the 2 nuclei.Turning the T=0 interaction off destroys the\nlinearity in 92Pd but not in 48Cr. We also consider B(E2)'s and static\nquadruple moments.\n", "  Thermal dilepton radiation from the hot fireballs created in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions provides unique insights into the properties of the\nproduced medium. We first show how the predictions of hadronic many-body theory\nfor a melting $\\rho$ meson, coupled with QGP emission utilizing a modern\nlattice-QCD based equation of state, yield a quantitative description of\ndilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions at the SPS and the RHIC beam energy\nscan program. We utilize these results to systematically extract the excess\nyields and their invariant-mass spectral slopes to predict the excitation\nfunction of fireball lifetimes and (early) temperatures, respectively. We\nthereby demonstrate that future measurements of these quantities can yield\nunprecedented information on basic fireball properties. Specifically, our\npredictions quantify the relation between the measured and maximal fireball\ntemperatures, and the proportionality of excess yields and total lifetime. This\ninformation can serve as a \"caloric\" curve to search for a first-order QCD\nphase transition, and to detect non-monotonous lifetime variations possibly\nrelated to critical phenomena.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) collaboration has reported a hotspot of 19\nultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Using a universal model with one source\nand energy-dependent magnetic deflections, we show that the distribution of the\nTA hotspot events is consistent with a single source hypothesis, although\nmultiple sources cannot be ruled out. The chance probability of this\ndistribution arising from a homogeneous distribution is $0.2\\%$. We describe a\nMonte Carlo Bayesian (MCB) inference approach, which can be used to derive\nparameters of the magnetic fields as well as the source coordinates, and we\napply this method to the TA hotspot data, inferring the location of the likely\nsource. We discuss possible applications of the same approach to future data.\n", "  In this letter, we demonstrate switching of nanomagnets through RKKY\ninteractions in topological insulator-based magnetoelectric devices. The\nswitching speed is dependent on the size of the ferromagnets.\n", "  A recent and unexpected discrepancy between \\textit{ab initio} simulations\nand the interpretation of a laser shock experiment on aluminum, probed by X-ray\nThomson scattering (XRTS), is addressed. The ion-ion structure factor deduced\nfrom the XRTS elastic peak (ion feature) is only compatible with a strongly\ncoupled out-of-equilibrium state. Orbital free molecular dynamics simulations\nwith ions colder than the electrons are employed to interpret the experiment.\nThe relevance of decoupled temperatures for ions and electrons is discussed.\nThe possibility that it mimics a transient, or metastable, out-of-equilibrium\nstate after melting is also suggested.\n", "  Separability and entanglement for n-qubits systems are quantified by using\nHilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions in which the density matrices are\ndecomposed into various terms representing certain one qubit, two-qubits,and\nlarger qubits measurements. The present method is more general than previous\nmethods for bipartite systems as it can be used for quantification of\nentanglement for large n-qubits systems.We demonstrate the use of such method\nby analyzing three qubits GHZ states, and three qubits general Bell states\nproduced by a certain multiplications of Braid operators, operating on the\ncomputational basis of states. Quantum correlations are obtained by measuring\nall qubits of these systems, while a measurement of a part of the system gives\nonly classical correlations. Quantification of entanglement for these systems\nis given by the use of HS decompositions.\n", "  The Time Renormalization Group (TRG) is an effective method for accurate\ncalculations of the matter power spectrum at the scale of the first baryonic\nacoustic oscillations. By using a particular variable transformation in the TRG\nformalism, we can reduce the 2D integral in the source term of the equations of\nmotion for the power spectrum into a series of 1D integrals. The shape of the\nintegrand allows us to pre-compute only thirteen antiderivatives numerically,\nwhich can then be reused when evaluating the outer integral. While this\nintroduces a few challenges to keep numerical noise under control, we find that\nthe computation time for nonlinear corrections to the matter power spectrum\ndecreases by a factor of 50. This opens up the possibility to use of TRG for\nmass production as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. A Fortran code\ndemonstrating this new algorithm has been made publicly available.\n", "  (abridged) The majority of star-forming galaxies follow a simple empirical\ncorrelation in the star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass ($M_*$) plane,\nusually referred to as the star formation Main Sequence (MS). Here we combine a\nset of hydro-dynamical simulations of interacting galactic disks with\nstate-of-the-art radiative transfer codes to analyze how the evolution of\nmergers is reflected upon the properties of the MS. We present\n\\textsc{Chiburst}, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED) code that fits the multi-wavelength, broad-band photometry\nof galaxies and derives stellar masses, star formation rates, and geometrical\nproperties of the dust distribution. We apply this tool to the SEDs of\nsimulated mergers and compare the derived results with the reference output\nfrom the simulations. Our results indicate that changes in the SEDs of mergers\nas they approach coalescence and depart from the MS are related to an evolution\nof dust geometry in scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. This is reflected\nin a correlation between the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the\ncompactness parameter $\\mathcal{C}$, that parametrizes this geometry and hence\nthe evolution of dust temperature ($T_{\\rm{dust}}$) with time. As mergers\napproach coalescence, they depart from the MS and increase their compactness,\nwhich implies that moderate outliers of the MS are consistent with late-type\nmergers. By further applying our method to real observations of Luminous\nInfrared Galaxies (LIRGs), we show that the merger scenario is unable to\nexplain these extreme outliers of the MS. Only by significantly increasing the\ngas fraction in the simulations are we able to reproduce the SEDs of LIRGs.\n", "  Accommodating both a 126 GeV mass and Standard Model (SM) like couplings for\nthe Higgs has a fine tuning price in supersymmetric models. Examples are the\nMSSM, in which SM-like couplings are natural, but raising the Higgs mass up to\n126 GeV requires a considerable tuning, or the NMSSM, in which the situation is\nreversed: the Higgs is naturally heavier, but being SM-like requires some\ntuning. We show that models with non-decoupling D-terms alleviate this tension\n- a 126 GeV SM-like Higgs comes out basically with no fine tuning cost. In\naddition, the analysis of the fine tuning of the extended gauge sector shows\nthat naturalness requires the heavy gauge bosons to likely be within the LHC\nrun II reach.\n", "  Building on the 10-way symmetry classification of disordered fermions, the\nauthors have recently given a homotopy-theoretic proof of Kitaev's \"Periodic\nTable\" for topological insulators and superconductors. The present paper offers\nan introduction to the physical setting and the mathematical model used. Basic\nto the proof is the so-called Diagonal Map, a natural transformation akin to\nthe Bott map of algebraic topology, which increases by one unit both the\nmomentum-space dimension and the symmetry index of translation-invariant ground\nstates of gapped free-fermion systems. This mapping is illustrated here with a\nfew examples of interest.\n", "  This work investigates the impact of cosmic flows and density perturbations\non Hubble constant $H_0$ measurements using nonlinear phase-space\nreconstructions of the Local Universe (LU). In particular, we rely on 25\nconstrained N-body simulations of the LU using the 2MRS galaxy sample within\ndistances of 90 Mpc/h. These have been randomly extended up to volumes\nenclosing 360 Mpc/h with augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory (750\nsimulations in total), accounting in this way for gravitational mode coupling\nfrom larger scales, correcting for periodic boundary effects, and estimating\nsystematics of missing attractors ($\\sigma_{\\rm large}=134$ km/s). We report on\nLocal Group speed reconstructions, which are compatible with CMB-dipole\nmeasurements: $|v_{\\rm LG}|=685\\pm137$ km/s. The direction $(l,b)=(260.5\\pm\n13.3,39.1\\pm 10.4)^\\circ$ is compatible with observations after considering the\nvariance of large scales. Accounting for large scales, our local bulk flow\nestimations assuming a $\\Lambda$CDM model are compatible with estimates based\non velocity data derived from the Tully-Fisher relation.\n  We focus on low redshift supernova measurements ($0.01<z<0.025$), which have\nbeen found to disagree with probes at larger distances. Our analysis indicates\nthat there are two effects contributing to this tension. First, the anisotropic\ndistribution of supernovae aligns with the velocity dipole and induces a\nsystematic boost in $H_0$. Second, a divergent region surrounding the Virgo\nSupercluster is responsible for an additional positive bias in $H_0$. Taking\nthese effects into account yields a correction of $\\Delta H_0=-1.76 \\pm 0.21 $\nkm/s/Mpc, thereby reducing the tension between local probes and more distant\nprobes. Effectively $H_0$ is lower by about $2\\%$.\n", "  We consider a simple renormalizable dark matter model consisting of two real\nscalars with a mass splitting $\\delta$, interacting with the SM particles\nthrough the Higgs portal. We find a viable parameter space respecting all the\nbounds imposed by invisible Higgs decay experiments at the LHC, the direct\ndetection experiments by XENON100 and LUX and the dark matter relic abundance\nprovided by WMAP and Planck. Despite the singlet scalar dark matter model that\nis fragile against the future direct detection experiments, the scalar split\nmodel introduced here survives such forthcoming bounds. We emphasize on the\nrole of the co-annihilation processes and the mixing effects in this feature.\nFor $m_{\\text{DM}} \\sim 63$ GeV in this model we can explain as well the\nobserved gamma-ray excess in the analyses of the Fermi-LAT data at Galactic\nlatitudes $2^{\\circ} \\leq |b| \\leq 20^{\\circ}$ and Galactic longitudes $|l| <\n20^{\\circ}$.\n", "  We study the representations of the three-dimensional Euclidean Snyder-de\nSitter algebra. This algebra generates the symmetries of a model admitting two\nfundamental scales (Planck mass and cosmological constant) and is invariant\nunder the Born reciprocity for exchange of positions and momenta. Its\nrepresentations can be obtained starting from those of the Snyder algebra, and\nexploiting the geometrical properties of the phase space, that can be\nidentified with a Grassmannian manifold. Both the position and momentum\noperators turn out to have a discrete spectrum.\n", "  Energy dissipation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is known to be\nhighly intermittent in space, being concentrated in sheet-like coherent\nstructures. Much less is known about intermittency in time, another fundamental\naspect of turbulence which has great importance for observations of solar\nflares and other space/astrophysical phenomena. In this Letter, we investigate\nthe temporal intermittency of energy dissipation in numerical simulations of\nMHD turbulence. We consider four-dimensional spatiotemporal structures, \"flare\nevents\", responsible for a large fraction of the energy dissipation. We find\nthat although the flare events are often highly complex, they exhibit robust\npower-law distributions and scaling relations. We find that the probability\ndistribution of dissipated energy has a power law index close to -1.75, similar\nto observations of solar flares, indicating that intense dissipative events\ndominate the heating of the system. We also discuss the temporal asymmetry of\nflare events as a signature of the turbulent cascade.\n", "  Physicists have argued that periodic orbit bunching leads to universal\nspectral fluctuations for chaotic quantum systems. To establish a more detailed\nmathematical understanding of this fact, it is first necessary to look more\nclosely at the classical side of the problem and determine orbit pairs\nconsisting of orbits which have similar actions. We specialize to the geodesic\nflow on compact factors of the hyperbolic plane as a classical chaotic system.\nThe companion paper [Huynh and Kunze, 2015] proved the existence of a unique\nperiodic partner orbit for a given periodic orbit with a small-angle\nself-crossing in configuration space that is a 2-encounter and derived an\nestimate for the action difference of the orbit pair. In this paper, we provide\nan inductive argument to deal with higher-order encounters: we prove that a\ngiven periodic orbit including an $L$-parallel encounter has $(L-1)!-1$ partner\norbits; we construct partner orbits and give estimates for the action\ndifferences between orbit pairs.\n", "  Despite strong interest in the starburst (hereafter SB) phenomenon, the\nconcept remains ill-defined. We use a strict definition of SB to examine the\nstatistical properties of local SB and post-starburst (hereafter PB) galaxies.\nWe also seek relationships to active galaxies. Potential SB galaxies are\nselected from the SDSS DR7 and their stellar content is analysed. We apply an\nage dependent dust attenuation correction and derive star formation rates\n(SFR), ages and masses of the young and old populations. The photometric masses\nnicely agree with dynamical masses derived from the H-alpha emission line\nwidth. To select SB galaxies, we use the birthrate parameter b=SFR/<SFR>,\nrequiring b>=3. The PB sample is selected from the citerion EW(Hdelta_abs)>=6\nA. Only 1% of star-forming galaxies are found to be SB galaxies. They\ncontribute 3-6% to the stellar production and are therefore unimportant for the\nlocal star formation activity. The median SB age is 70 Myr, roughly independent\nof mass. The b-parameter strongly depends on burst age. Values close to b=60\nare found at ages ~10 Myr, while almost no SBs are found at ages >1 Gyr. The\nmedian baryonic burst mass fraction of sub-L* galaxies is 5%, decreasing slowly\nwith mass. The median mass fraction of the recent burst in the PB sample is\n5-10%. The age-mass distribution of the progenitors of the PBs is bimodal with\na break at log(M)~10.6 above which the ages are doubled. The SB and PB\nluminosity functions (hereafter LFs) follow each other closely until M_r~-21,\nwhen AGNs begin to dominate. The PB LF continues to follow the AGN LF while SB\nloose significance. This suggests that the number of luminous SBs is\nunderestimated by about one dex at high luminosities, due to large amounts of\ndust and/or AGN blending. It also indicates that the SB phase preceded the AGN\nphase. We also discuss the conditions for global gas outflow caused by stellar\nfeedback.\n", "  Stringent limits are set on the long-lived lepton-like sector of the\nphenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM) and the\nanomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) model. The limits are derived\nfrom the results presented in a recent search for long-lived charged particles\nin proton-proton collisions, based on data collected by the CMS detector at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. In the pMSSM\nparameter sub-space considered, 95.9% of the points predicting charginos with a\nlifetime of at least 10 ns are excluded. These constraints on the pMSSM are the\nfirst obtained at the LHC. Charginos with a lifetime greater than 100 ns and\nmasses up to about 800 GeV in the AMSB model are also excluded. The method\ndescribed can also be used to set constraints on other models.\n", "  Photo-induced forces can be used to manipulate and cool the mechanical motion\nof oscillators. When the oscillator is used as a force sensor, such as in\natomic force microscopy, active feedback is an enticing route to enhancing\nmeasurement performance. Here, we show broadband multimode cooling of $-23$ dB\ndown to a temperature of $8 \\pm 1$~K in the stationary regime. Through the use\nof periodic quiescence feedback cooling, we show improved signal-to-noise\nratios for the measurement of transient signals. We compare the performance of\nreal feedback to numerical post-processing of data and show that both methods\nproduce similar improvements to the signal-to-noise ratio of force\nmeasurements. We achieved a room temperature force measurement sensitivity of\n$< 2\\times10^{-16}$ N with integration time of less than $0.1$ ms. The high\nprecision and fast force microscopy results presented will potentially benefit\napplications in biosensing, molecular metrology, subsurface imaging and\naccelerometry.\n", "  An ideal Maxwell-Boltzmann gas confined in various rectangular nano domains\nis considered under quantum size effects. Thermodynamic quantities are\ncalculated from their relations with partition function which consists of\ntriple infinite summations over momentum states in each direction. To get\nanalytical expressions, summations are converted to integrals for macro systems\nby continuum approximation which fails at nanoscales. To avoid both from the\nnumerical calculation of summations and the failure of their integral\napproximations at nanoscale, a method which gives an analytical expression for\nsingle particle partition function (SPPF) is proposed. It's shown that\ndimensional transition in momentum space occurs at certain magnitude of\nconfinement. Therefore, to represent SPPF by lower-dimensional analytical\nexpressions becomes possible rather than numerical calculation of summations.\nConsidering rectangular domains with different aspect ratios, comparison of the\nresults of derived expressions with those of summation forms of SPPF is done.\nIt's shown that analytical expressions for SPPF give very precise results with\nmaximum relative errors of around 1%, 2% and 3% at just the transition point\nfor single, double and triple transitions respectively. Based on dimensional\ntransitions, expressions for free energy, entropy, internal energy, chemical\npotential, heat capacity and pressure are given analytically valid for any\nscale.\n", "  We apply a new method based upon thermofield dynamics (TFD) to study\nentanglement of finite-spin systems with non-competitive external fields for\nboth equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases. For the equilibrium finite-spin\nsystems, the temperature dependence of the extended density matrices is derived\nusing this method, and the effect of non-competitive external field is\ndemonstrated. For the non-equilibrium finite-spin systems, the time dependence\nof the extended density matrices and the extended entanglement entropies is\nderived in accordance with von Noumann equation, and the dissipative dynamics\nof the finite-spin systems is argued. Consequently, the applicability of the\nTFD-based method to describe entanglement is confirmed in both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium cases with the external fieds.\n", "  Throughout this paper we investigate the complex structure of the conifold\n$C(T^{1,1})$ basically making use of the interplay between symplectic and\ncomplex approaches of the K\\\"{a}hler toric manifolds. The description of the\nCalabi-Yau manifold $C(T^{1,1})$ using toric data allows us to write explicitly\nthe complex coordinates and apply standard methods for extracting special\nKilling forms on the base manifold. As an outcome, we obtain the complete set\nof special Killing forms on the five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space\n$T^{1,1}$.\n", "  Quantum transport through disordered structures is inhibited by (Anderson)\nlocalization effects. The disorder can be either topological as in random\nnetworks or energetical as in the original Anderson model. In both cases the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian associated with the network become localized. We\nshow how to overcome localization by network multiplexing. Here, multiple\nlayers of random networks with the same number of nodes are stacked in such a\nway that in the perpendicular directions regular one-dimensional networks are\nformed. Depending on the ratio of the coupling within the layer and\nperpendicular to it, transport gets either enhanced or diminished. In\nparticular, if the couplings are of the same order, transport gets enhanced and\nlocalization effects can be overcome. We exemplify our results by two examples:\nmultiplexes of random networks and of one-dimensional Anderson models.\n", "  We report that many exact invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations\nfor both pipe and channel flows are well represented by just few modes of the\nmodel of McKeon & Sharma J. Fl. Mech. 658, 356 (2010). This model provides\nmodes that act as a basis to decompose the velocity field, ordered by their\namplitude of response to forcing arising from the interaction between scales.\nThe model was originally derived from the Navier-Stokes equations to represent\nturbulent flows and has been used to explain coherent structure and to predict\nturbulent statistics. This establishes a surprising new link between the two\ndistinct approaches to understanding turbulence.\n", "  In this review we discuss spin and charge transport properties in\ngraphene-based single-layer and few-layer spin-valve devices. We give an\noverview of challenges and recent advances in the field of device fabrication\nand discuss two of our fabrication methods in more detail which result in\ndistinctly different device performances. In the first class of devices, Co/MgO\nelectrodes are directly deposited onto graphene which results in rough\nMgO-to-Co interfaces and favor the formation of conducting pinholes throughout\nthe MgO layer. We show that the contact resistance area product (R$_c$A) is a\nbenchmark for spin transport properties as it scales with the measured spin\nlifetime in these devices indicating that contact-induced spin dephasing is the\nbottleneck for spin transport even in devices with large R$_c$A values. In a\nsecond class of devices, Co/MgO electrodes are first patterned onto a silicon\nsubstrate. Subsequently, a graphene-hBN heterostructure is directly transferred\nonto these prepatterned electrodes which provides improved interface\nproperties. This is seen by a strong enhancement of both charge and spin\ntransport properties yielding charge carrier mobilities exceeding 20000\ncm$^2$/(Vs) and spin lifetimes up to 3.7 ns at room temperature. We discuss\nseveral shortcomings in the determination of both quantities which complicates\nthe analysis of both extrinsic and intrinsic spin scattering mechanisms.\nFurthermore, we show that contacts can be the origin of a second charge\nneutrality point in gate dependent resistance measurements which is influenced\nby the quantum capacitance of the underlying graphene layer.\n", "  We describe a NOVel form of Adaptive softening (NovA) for collisionless\n$N$-body simulations, implemented in the Ramses adaptive mesh refinement code.\nWe introduce a refinement criterion that the particle distribution within each\ncell be sufficiently isotropic, as measured by its moment of inertia tensor. In\nthis way, collapse is only refined if it occurs along all three axes, ensuring\nthat the softening $\\epsilon$ is always of order twice the largest\ninter-particle spacing in a cell. This more conservative force softening\ncriterion is designed to minimise spurious two-body effects, while maintaining\nhigh force resolution in collapsed regions of the flow. We test NovA using an\nantisymmetric perturbed plane wave collapse (`Valinia' test) before applying it\nto warm dark matter (WDM) simulations. For the Valinia test, we show that --\nunlike the standard $N$-body method -- NovA produces no numerical fragmentation\nwhile still being able to correctly capture fine caustics and shells around the\ncollapsing regions. For the WDM simulations, we find that NovA converges\nsignificantly more rapidly than standard $N$-body, producing little or no\nspurious halos on small scales. We show, however, that determining whether or\nnot halos exist below the free streaming mass $M_{\\rm fs}$ is complicated by\nthe fact that our halo finder (AHF) likely incorrectly labels some caustics and\ncriss-crossing filaments as halos, while one or two particularly massive\nfilaments appear to fragment in any version of NovA where refinement is\nallowed. Such massive filaments may be physically unstable to collapse, as is\nthe case for infinite, static, self-gravitating cylinders. We will use NovA in\nforthcoming papers to study the issue of halo formation below $M_{\\rm fs}$;\nfilament stability; and to obtain new constraints on the temperature of dark\nmatter.\n", "  Black holes are among the most fascinating objects populating our universe.\nTheir characteristic features, encompassing spacetime singularities, event\nhorizons, and black hole thermodynamics, provide a rich testing ground for\nquantum gravity ideas. In this note we observe that the renormalization group\nimproved Schwarzschild black holes constructed by Bonanno and Reuter within\nWeinberg's asymptotic safety program constitute a prototypical example of a\nHayward geometry used to model non-singular black holes within quantum gravity\nphenomenology. Moreover, they share many features of a Planck star: their\neffective geometry naturally incorporates the one-loop corrections found in the\neffective field theory framework, their Kretschmann scalar is bounded, and the\nblack hole singularity is replaced by a regular de Sitter patch. The role of\nthe cosmological constant in the renormalization group improvement process is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The concept of emergence is critically analyzed in particular with respect to\nthe assumed emergence of mental properties from a neuronal basis. We argue that\nso-called contextual emergence is needed to avoid an eliminatory reductionism.\nQuantum-like features of the emergent qualities are to be expected. As a\nconsequence, non-causal relations like entanglement correlations have to be\nconsidered as full fledged elements of reality. \"Observable extension\" is\nproposed as a contextual alternative to emergence avoiding the asymmetry\nbetween purportedly basic and emergent properties.\n", "  Thus far, judging the fate of a massive star (either a neutron star (NS) or a\nblack hole) solely by its structure prior to core collapse has been ambiguous.\nOur work and previous attempts find a non-monotonic variation of successful and\nfailed supernovae with zero-age main-sequence mass, for which no single\nstructural parameter can serve as a good predictive measure. However, we\nidentify two parameters computed from the pre-collapse structure of the\nprogenitor, which in combination allow for a clear separation of exploding and\nnon-exploding cases with only few exceptions (~1-2.5%) in our set of 621\ninvestigated stellar models. One parameter is M4, defining the normalized\nenclosed mass for a dimensionless entropy per nucleon of s=4, and the other is\nmu4 = d(m/M_sun)/d(r/1000 km) at s=4, being the normalized mass-derivative at\nthis location. The two parameters mu4 and M4*mu4 can be directly linked to the\nmass-infall rate, Mdot, of the collapsing star and the electron-type neutrino\nluminosity of the accreting proto-NS, L_nue ~ M_ns*Mdot, which play a crucial\nrole in the \"critical luminosity\" concept for the theoretical description of\nneutrino-driven explosions as runaway phenomenon of the stalled accretion\nshock. All models were evolved employing the approach of Ugliano et al. for\nsimulating neutrino-driven explosions in spherical symmetry. The neutrino\nemission of the accretion layer is approximated by a gray transport solver,\nwhile the uncertain neutrino emission of the 1.1 M_sun proto-NS core is\nparametrized by an analytic model. The free parameters connected to the\ncore-boundary prescription are calibrated to reproduce the observables of\nSupernova 1987A for five different progenitor models.\n", "  The unphysical spin-2 massive degrees of freedom in higher derivative gravity\nmay be either massive unphysical ghosts or tachyonic ghosts. In the last case\nthere is no Planck-scale threshold protecting vacuum cosmological solutions\nfrom instabilities. Within the anomaly-induced action formalism the\nphoton-driven IR running of the coefficient of the Weyl-squared term makes the\nghost eventually becoming tachyon, that should produce a gravitational\nexplosion of vacuum. This effect is stable under higher loop corrections and\ntakes place also in known versions of perturbative quantum gravity. However,\nthe contribution of massless fields in the far IR are not the same in flat and\nde~Sitter spaces. In the asymptotically deSitter case one can observe a kind of\nIR decoupling, which protects the cosmological solution from the future\ntachyonic instabilities.\n", "  If the Hartle-Hawking wave function is the correct boundary condition of our\nuniverse, the history of our universe will be well approximated by an\ninstanton. Although this instanton should be classicalized at infinity, as long\nas we are observing a process of each history, we may detect a\nnon-classicalized part of field combinations. When we apply it to a dark energy\nmodel, this non-classicalized part of fields can be well embedded to a\nquintessence and a phantom model, i.e., a quintom model. Because of the\nproperty of complexified instantons, the phantomness will be naturally free\nfrom a big rip singularity. This phantomness does not cause perturbative\ninstabilities, as it is an effect emergent from the entire wave function. Our\nwork may thus provide a theoretical basis for the quintom models, whose\nequation of state (EoS) can cross the cosmological constant boundary (CCB)\nphenomenologically.\n", "  Trapping ultracold atoms in optical lattices enabled numerous breakthroughs\nuniting several disciplines. Coupling these systems to quantized light leads to\na plethora of new phenomena and has opened up a new field of study. Here we\nintroduce a physically novel source of competition in a many-body strongly\ncorrelated system: We prove that quantum backaction of global measurement is\nable to efficiently compete with intrinsic short-range dynamics of an atomic\nsystem. The competition becomes possible due to the ability to change the\nspatial profile of a global measurement at a microscopic scale comparable to\nthe lattice period without the need of single site addressing. In coherence\nwith a general physical concept, where new competitions typically lead to new\nphenomena, we demonstrate novel nontrivial dynamical effects such as\nlarge-scale multimode oscillations, long-range entanglement and correlated\ntunneling, as well as selective suppression and enhancement of dynamical\nprocesses beyond the projective limit of the quantum Zeno effect. We\ndemonstrate both the break-up and protection of strongly interacting fermion\npairs by measurement. Such a quantum optical approach introduces into many-body\nphysics novel processes, objects, and methods of quantum engineering, including\nthe design of many-body entangled environments for open systems.\n", "  With the completion of the Planck mission, in order to continue to gather\ncosmological information it has become crucial to understand the Large Scale\nStructures (LSS) of the universe to percent accuracy. The Effective Field\nTheory of LSS (EFTofLSS) is a novel theoretical framework that aims to develop\nan analytic understanding of LSS at long distances, where inhomogeneities are\nsmall. We further develop the description of biased tracers in the EFTofLSS to\naccount for the effect of baryonic physics and primordial non-Gaussianities,\nfinding that new bias coefficients are required. Then, restricting to dark\nmatter with Gaussian initial conditions, we describe the prediction of the\nEFTofLSS for the one-loop halo-halo and halo-matter two-point functions, and\nfor the tree-level halo-halo-halo, matter-halo-halo and matter-matter-halo\nthree-point functions. Several new bias coefficients are needed in the\nEFTofLSS, even though their contribution at a given order can be degenerate and\nthe same parameters contribute to multiple observables. We develop a method to\nreduce the number of biases to an irreducible basis, and find that, at the\norder at which we work, seven bias parameters are enough to describe this\nextremely rich set of statistics. We then compare with the output of $N$-body\nsimulations. For the lowest mass bin, we find percent level agreement up to\n$k\\simeq 0.3\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for the one-loop two-point functions, and up\nto $k\\simeq 0.15\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for the tree-level three-point functions,\nwith the $k$-reach decreasing with higher mass bins. This is consistent with\nthe theoretical estimates, and suggests that the cosmological information in\nLSS amenable to analytical control is much more than previously believed.\n", "  The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions, their role in topological\nquantum computation, and the possibility of realizing them in condensed matter\nsystems, has attracted considerable attention. While there have been recent\nreports of zero energy modes in single particle tunneling density of states,\ntheir identity as Majorana modes has so far not been unequivocally established.\nWe make predictions for the local compressibility $\\kappa_{\\rm{loc}}$, tuned by\nchanging the chemical potential $\\mu$ in a semiconducting nanowire with strong\nspin-orbit coupling and in a Zeeman field in proximity to a superconductor,\nthat has been proposed as a candidate system for observing Majorana modes. We\nshow that in the center of the wire, the topological phase transition is\nsignaled by a divergence of $\\kappa_{\\rm{loc}}$ as a function of $\\mu$ which is\nan important diagnostic of the topological phase transition. We also find that\na single strong impurity potential can lead to a local {\\it negative}\ncompressibility at the topological phase transition. The origin of such\nanomalous behavior can be traced to the formation of Andreev bound states close\nto topological phase transitions. Measurable by a scanning electron transistor,\nthe compressibility includes contributions from both single particle states and\ncollective modes and is therefore a complimentary probe from scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We present an analytic study of domain-wall statics and dynamics in\nferromagnetic nanotubes with spin-orbit-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI). Even at the level of statics, dramatic effects arise from\nthe interplay of space curvature and DMI: the domains become chirally twisted\nleading to more compact domain walls. The dynamics of these chiral structures\nexhibits several interesting features. Under weak applied currents, they\npropagate without distortion. The dynamical response is further enriched by the\napplication of an external magnetic field: the domain wall velocity becomes\nchirality-dependent and can be significantly increased by varying the DMI.\nThese characteristics allow for enhanced control of domain wall motion in\nnanotubes with DMI, increasing their potential as information carriers in\nfuture logic and storage devices.\n", "  A recent experiment has detected collision-induced frequency shifts in bright\nmatter-wave solitons for the first time [Nat. Phys. 10, 918 (2014)]. Using a\nparticle model, we derive the frequency shift for two solitons in a harmonic\ntrap, and compare it to the results of the recent experiment and reported\ntheoretical approximation. We find regimes where the frequency shift is much\nsmaller than previously predicted, and propose experiments to test these\nfindings. We also predict that reducing the experimental trap frequency will\nreveal for the first time soliton molecules or soliton bound states in a cold\natoms system. The dynamics of such bound states are found to be both highly\nphase-dependent, and sensitive to the residual 3D nature of the experiment.\n", "  We analyze the characteristic series, the $KO$ series and the series\nassociated with the Witten genus, and their analytic forms as the $q$-analogs\nof classical special functions (in particular $q$-analog of the beta integral\nand the gamma function). $q$-series admit an analytic interpretation in terms\nof the spectral Ruelle functions, and their relations to appropriate elliptic\nmodular forms can be described. We show that there is a deep correspondence\nbetween the characteristic series of the Witten genus and $KO$ characteristic\nseries, on one side, and the denominator identities and characters of $N=2$\nsuperconformal algebras, and the affine Lie (super)algebras on the other. We\nrepresent the characteristic series in the form of double series using the\nHecke-Rogers modular identity.\n", "  When pulling a probe particle in a many-particle system with fixed velocity,\nthe probe's effective friction, defined as average pulling force over its\nvelocity, $\\gamma_{eff}:=\\langle F_{ex}\\rangle/u$, first keeps constant (linear\nresponse), then decreases (thinning) and finally increases (thickening). We\npropose a three-time-scales picture (TTSP) to unify thinning and thickening\nbehaviour. The points of the TTSP are that there are three distinct time scales\nof bath particles: diffusion, damping, and single probe-bath (P-B) collision;\nthe dominating time scales, which are controlled by the pulling velocity,\ndetermine the behaviour of the probe's friction. We confirm the TTSP by\nLangevin dynamics simulation. Microscopically, we find that for computing the\neffective friction, Maxwellian distribution of bath particles' velocities works\nin low Reynolds number (Re) but fails in high Re. It can be understood based on\nthe microscopic mechanism of thickening obtained in the $T=0$ limit. Based on\nthe TTSP, we explain different thinning and thickening observations in some\nearlier literature.\n", "  The primary goal of this study is to observe how complex the behaviors of\nCepheids can be, and to show how the continued monitoring of Cepheids at\nmultiple wavelengths can begin to reveal their \"secret lives.\"\n  We aim to achieve this through optical photometry, UV spectroscopy and X-ray\nimaging. Through Villanova's guaranteed access to ground-based telescopes, we\nhave secured well-covered light curves as regularly as possible. Amplitudes and\ntimes of max brightness were obtained and compared to previous literature\nresults. At UV wavelengths, we have secured hi-res spectra of 2 nearby Cepheids\n- delta Cep and beta Dor - with HST-COS. Also, we have obtained X-ray images of\n5 Cepheids with XMM-Newton and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and further\nobservations with both satellites have been proposed for (XMM) and approved\n(Chandra).\n  Optical photometry has shown that 8 of the 10 observed Cepheids have\namplitude variability, or hints thereof, and all 10 show period variability\n(recent, long-term or possibly periodic). The UV spectra reveal emission lines\nfrom heated atmospheric plasmas of 10^4 - 10^5 K that vary in phase with the\nCepheid pulsations. The X-ray images have detected the three nearest Cepheids\nobserved (Polaris, delta Cep and beta Dor), while the distances of the other\ntwo place their fluxes likely at or below detector background levels. The X-ray\nfluxes for delta Cep show possible phased variability, but anti-correlated with\nthe UV emission lines (i.e. high X-ray flux during low UV flux, and vice\nversa).\n  Further data are required to ultimately confirm Blazhko-like cycles in\nCepheids, X-ray variability with phase and the particulars of the high-energy\nvariability such as phase-lags between atmospheric plasma emissions of\ndifferent temperature and the exact contributions of the possible heating\nmechanism.\n", "  We study the entanglement R\\'{e}nyi $\\alpha$-entropy (ER$\\alpha $E) as the\nmeasure of entanglement. Instead of a single quantity in standard entanglement\nquantification for a quantum state by using the von Neumann entropy for the\nwell-accepted entanglement of formation (EoF), the ER$\\alpha $E gives a\ncontinuous spectrum parametrized by variable $\\alpha $ as the entanglement\nmeasure, and it reduces to the standard EoF in the special case $\\alpha\n\\rightarrow 1$. The ER$\\alpha $E provides more information in entanglement\nquantification, and can be used such as in determining the convertibility of\nentangled states by local operations and classical communication. A series of\nnew results are obtained: (i) we can show that ER$\\alpha $E of two states,\nwhich can be mixed or pure, may be incomparable, in contrast to the fact that\nthere always exists an order for EoF of two states; (ii) similar as the case of\nEoF, we study in a fully analytical way the ER$\\alpha $E for arbitrary\ntwo-qubit states, the Werner states and isotropic states in general\nd-dimension; (iii) we provide a proof of the previous conjecture for the\nanalytical functional form of EoF of isotropic states in arbitrary d-dimension.\n", "  We study the splitting probabilities for a one-dimensional Brownian motion in\na cage whose two boundaries move at constant speeds $c_1$ and $c_2$. This\nconfiguration corresponds to the capture of a diffusing, but skittish lamb,\nwith an approaching shepherd on the left and a precipice on the right. We\nderive compact expressions for these splitting probabilities when the cage is\nexpanding. We also obtain the time-dependent first-passage probability to the\nleft boundary, as well as the splitting probability to this boundary, when the\ncage is either expanding or contracting. The boundary motions have a\nnon-trivial impact on the splitting probabilities, leading to multiple regimes\nof behavior that depend on the expansion or contraction speed of the cage. In\nparticular, the probability to capture the lamb is maximized when the shepherd\nmoves at a non-zero optimal speed if the initial lamb position and the ratio\nbetween the two boundary speeds satisfy certain conditions.\n", "  We develop reverse versions of hypercontractive inequalities for quantum\nchannels. By generalizing classical techniques, we prove a reverse\nhypercontractive inequality for tensor products of qubit depolarizing channels.\nWe apply this to obtain a rapid mixing result for depolarizing noise applied to\nlarge subspaces, and to prove bounds on a quantum generalization of\nnon-interactive correlation distillation.\n", "  In order to reveal many-body interactions in the three-dimensional (3D)\nperovskite manganite, we have performed an $in$ $situ$ angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on La$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) and\ninvestigated the behaviors of quasiparticles. We observe quasiparticle peaks\naround the Fermi momentum, both in the electron and the hole bands, and clear\nkinks throughout the hole Fermi surface in the ARPES band dispersion. The\nisotropic behavior sharply contrasts to the strong anisotropic quasiparticle\nexcitation observed in layered manganites. These results suggest that polaronic\nquasiparticles by coupling of the electrons with Jahn-Teller phonons play an\nimportant role in the physical properties of the ferromagnetic metallic phase\nin 3D manganite LSMO.\n", "  The origin of large magnetic fields in the Universe remains currently\nunknown. We investigate here a mechanism before recombination based on known\nphysics. The source of the vorticity is due to the changes in the photon\ndistribution function caused by the fluctuations in the background photons. We\nshow that the magnetic field generated in the MHD limit, due to the Coulomb\nscattering, is of the order $10^{-49}$~G on a coherence scale of 10 kpc. We\nexplicitly show that the magnetic fields generated from this process are\nsustainable and are not erased by resistive diffusion. We compare the results\nwith current observations and discuss the implications. Our seed magnetic\nfields are generated on small scales whereas the main mechanisms studied in the\nliterature are on scale bigger than 1 Mpc. However, compared to more exotic\ntheories generating seed magnetic fields on similar scales, the strength of our\nfields are generally smaller.\n", "  The collective behaviour of hadronic particles has been observed in high\nmultiplicity proton-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), as well\nas in deuteron-gold collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC).\nIn this work we present the first calculation, in the hydrodynamic framework,\nof thermal photon radiation from such small collision systems. Owing to their\ncompact size, these systems can reach temperatures comparable to those in\ncentral nucleus-nucleus collisions. The thermal photons can thus shine over the\nprompt background, and increase the low $p_T$ direct photon spectrum by a\nfactor of 2-3 in 0-1% p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. This thermal photon\nenhancement can therefore serve as a clean signature of the existence of a hot\nquark-gluon plasma during the evolution of these small collision systems, as\nwell as validate hydrodynamic behavior in small systems.\n", "  We explore the concept of a graph homomorphism through the lens of\nC$^*$-algebras and operator systems. We start by studying the various notions\nof a quantum graph homomorphism and examine how they are related to each other.\nWe then define and study a C$^*$-algebra that encodes all the information about\nthese homomorphisms and establish a connection between computational complexity\nand the representation of these algebras. We use this C$^*$-algebra to define a\nnew quantum chromatic number and establish some basic properties of this\nnumber. We then suggest a way of studying these quantum graph homomorphisms\nusing certain completely positive maps and describe their structure. Finally,\nwe use these completely positive maps to define the notion of a \"quantum\" core\nof a graph.\n", "  Reciprocity is a universal principle that has a profound impact on many areas\nof physics. A fundamental phenomenon in condensed-matter physics, optical\nphysics and acoustics, arising from reciprocity, is the constructive\ninterference of quantum or classical waves which propagate along time-reversed\npaths in disordered media, leading to, for example, weak localization and\nmetal-insulator transition. Previous studies have shown that such coherent\neffects are suppressed when reciprocity is broken. Here we show that by\nbreaking reciprocity in a controlled manner, we can tune, rather than simply\nsuppress, these phenomena. In particular, we manipulate coherent backscattering\nof light, also known as weak localization. By utilizing a non-reciprocal\nmagneto-optical effect, we control the interference between time-reversed paths\ninside a multimode fiber with strong mode mixing, and realize a continuous\ntransition from the well-known peak to a dip in the backscattered intensity.\nOur results may open new possibilities for coherent control of classical and\nquantum waves in complex systems\n", "  We discuss a manifestly covariant way of arriving at the quantization rules\nbased on causality, with no reference to Poisson or Peierls brackets of any\nkind.\n", "  We sudy the creation of nonlocal states with ultracold atoms trapped in an\noptical lattice. We show that these states violate Bell inequality by measuring\none- and two-body correlations. Our scheme only requires beam splitting\noperations and global phase shifts, and can be realized within the current\ntechnology, employing single-site addressing. This proposal paves the way to\nstudy multipartite nonlocality and entanglement in ultracold atomic systems.\n", "  The determination of the normal and transverse (frictional) inter-particle\nforces within a granular medium is a long standing, taunting, and yet\nunresolved problem. We present a new formalism which employs the knowledge of\nthe external forces and the orientations of contacts between particles (of any\ngiven sizes), to compute all the inter-particle forces. Having solved this\nproblem we exemplify the efficacy of the formalism showing that the force\nchains in such systems are determined by an expansion in the eigenfunctions of\na newly defined operator.\n", "  We consider the Yang-Mills equations with a matrix gauge group $G$ on the de\nSitter dS$_4$, anti-de Sitter AdS$_4$ and Minkowski $R^{3,1}$ spaces. On all\nthese spaces one can introduce a doubly warped metric in the form $d s^2 =-d\nu^2 + f^2 d v^2 +h^2 d s^2_{H^2}$, where $f$ and $h$ are the functions of $u$\nand $d s^2_{H^2}$ is the metric on the two-dimensional hyperbolic space $H^2$.\nWe show that in the adiabatic limit, when the metric on $H^2$ is scaled down,\nthe Yang-Mills equations become the sigma-model equations describing harmonic\nmaps from a two-dimensional manifold (dS$_2$, AdS$_2$ or $R^{1,1}$,\nrespectively) into the based loop group $\\Omega G=C^\\infty (S^1, G)/G$ of\nsmooth maps from the boundary circle $S^1=\\partial H^2$ of $H^2$ into the gauge\ngroup $G$. From this correspondence and the implicit function theorem it\nfollows that the moduli space of Yang-Mills theory with a gauge group $G$ in\nfour dimensions is bijective to the moduli space of two-dimensional sigma model\nwith $\\Omega G$ as the target space. The sigma-model field equations can be\nreduced to equations of geodesics on $\\Omega G$, solutions of which yield\nmagnetic-type configurations of Yang-Mills fields. The group $\\Omega G$\nnaturally acts on their moduli space.\n", "  We discuss the prospects to probe the light-quark Yukawa couplings to the\nHiggs boson. The Higgs coupling to the charm quark can be probed both via\ninclusive and exclusive approaches. On the inclusive frontier, we use our\nrecently proposed method together with published experimental studies for the\nsensitivity of the Higgs coupling to bottom quarks to find that the\nhigh-luminosity LHC can be sensitive to modifications of the charm Yukawa of\nthe order of a few times its standard model (SM) value. We also present a\npreliminary study of this mode for a 100 TeV hadronic machine (with similar\nluminosity) and find that the bound can be further improved, possibly within\nthe reach of the expected signal in the SM. On the exclusive frontier, we use\nthe recent ATLAS search for charmonia and photon final state. This study yields\nthe first measurement of the background relevant to these modes. Using this\nbackground measurement we project that at the high-luminosity LHC, unless the\nanalysis strategy is changed, the sensitivity of the exclusive final state to\nthe charm Yukawa to the charm Yukawa will be rather poor, of the order of 50\ntimes the SM coupling. We then use a Monte-Carlo study to rescale the above\nbackgrounds to the h->phi gamma case and obtain a much weaker sensitivity to\nthe strange Yukawa, of order of 3000 times the SM value. We briefly speculate\nwhat would be required to improve the prospects of the exclusive modes.\n", "  The Milky Way is expected to be embedded in a halo of dark matter particles,\nwith the highest density in the central region, and decreasing density with the\nhalo-centric radius. Dark matter might be indirectly detectable at Earth\nthrough a flux of stable particles generated in dark matter annihilations and\npeaked in the direction of the Galactic Center. We present a search for an\nexcess flux of muon (anti-) neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the\nGalactic Center using the cubic-kilometer-sized IceCube neutrino detector at\nthe South Pole. There, the Galactic Center is always seen above the horizon.\nThus, new and dedicated veto techniques against atmospheric muons are required\nto make the southern hemisphere accessible for IceCube. We used 319.7 live-days\nof data from IceCube operating in its 79-string configuration during 2010 and\n2011. No neutrino excess was found and the final result is compatible with the\nbackground. We present upper limits on the self-annihilation cross-section,\n$\\left<\\sigma_\\mathrm{A} v\\right>$, for WIMP masses ranging from 30 GeV up to\n10 TeV, assuming cuspy (NFW) and flat-cored (Burkert) dark matter halo\nprofiles, reaching down to $\\simeq 4 \\cdot 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and\n$\\simeq 2.6 \\cdot 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for the $\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$\nchannel, respectively.\n", "  A pathway to the formation of planetesimals, and eventually giant planets,\nmay occur in concentrations of dust grains trapped in pressure maxima. Dramatic\ncrescent-shaped dust concentrations have been seen in recent radio images at\nsub-mm wavelengths. These disk asymmetries could represent the initial phases\nof planet formation in the dust trap scenario, provided that grain sizes are\nspatially segregated. A testable prediction of azimuthal dust trapping is that\nprogressively larger grains should be more sharply confined and furthermore the\ntrapped grains should follow a distribution that is markedly different from the\ngas. However, gas tracers such as CO and the infrared emission from small\ngrains are both very optically thick where the submm continuum originates, so\nobservations have been unable to test the trapping predictions or to identify\ncompact concentrations of larger grains required for planet formation by\ncore-accretion. Here we report multifrequency observations of HD142527, from\n34GHz to 700GHz, that reveal a compact concentration of ~cm-sized grains, with\na few Earth masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of ~mm-sized particles.\nThe emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than ~1mm are optically thick and\ntrace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner\nregions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest dust\ngrains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust trapping is\nefficient for approximately cm-sized grains and leads to enhanced\nconcentrations, while the smaller grains largely reflect the gas distribution.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyze a three dimensional supersymmetric\nChern-Simons theory on a manifold with a boundary. The boundary we will\nconsider in this paper will be defined by $n\\cdot x=0$, where $n$ is a\nlight-like vector. It will be demonstrated that this boundary is preserved\nunder the action of the $SIM(1)$ subgroup of the Lorentz group. Furthermore,\nthe presence of this boundary will break half of the supersymmetry of the\noriginal theory. As the original Chern-Simons theory had $\\mathcal{N} =1$\nsupersymmetry in absence of a boundary, it will only have $\\mathcal{N}=1/2$\nsupersymmetry in presence of this boundary. We will also observe that the\nChern-Simons theory can be made gauge invariant by introducing new degrees of\nfreedom on the boundary. The gauge transformation of these new degrees of\nfreedom will exactly cancel the boundary term obtained from the gauge\ntransformation of the Chern-Simons theory.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics simulations for a first principles-based effective\nHamiltonian to calculate two important quantities characterizing the\nelectrocaloric effect in BaTiO$_3$, the adiabatic temperature change $\\Delta T$\nand the isothermal entropy change $\\Delta S$, for different electric field\nstrengths. We compare direct and indirect methods to obtain $\\Delta T$ and\n$\\Delta S$, and we confirm that both methods indeed lead to identical result\nprovided that the system does not actually undergo a first order phase\ntransition. We also show that a large electrocaloric response is obtained for\nelectric fields beyond the critical field strength for the first order phase\ntransition. Furthermore, our work fills several gaps regarding the application\nof the first principles-based effective Hamiltonian approach, which represents\na very attractive and powerful method for the quantitative prediction of\nelectrocaloric properties. In particular, we discuss the importance of\nmaintaining thermal equilibrium during the field ramping when calculating\n$\\Delta T$ using the direct method within a molecular dynamics approach.\n", "  We study vacuum polarisation effects of a Dirac field coupled to an external\nscalar field and derive a semi-classical expansion of the regu-larised vacuum\nenergy. The leading order of this expansion is given by a classical formula due\nto Chin, Lee-Wick and Walecka, for which our result provides the first rigorous\nproof. We then discuss applications to the non-relativistic large-coupling\nlimit of an interacting system, and to the stability of homogeneous systems.\n", "  We construct a new isentropic equation of state (EOS) at finite temperature\n\"CRover\" on the basis of the hadron-quark crossover at high density. By using\nthe new EOS, we study the structure of hot neutron stars at birth with the\ntypical lepton fraction ($Y_l=0.3-0.4$) and the typical entropy per baryon\n($S=1-2$). Due to the gradual appearance of quark degrees of freedom at high\ndensity, the temperature T and the baryon density at the center of the hot\nneutron stars with the hadron-quark crossover are found to be smaller than\nthose without the crossover by a factor of 2 or more. Typical energy release\ndue to the contraction of a hot neutron star to a cold neutron star with 1.4\nsolarmass is shown to be about 0.04 solarmass with the spin-up rate about 14%.\n", "  The Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) is the total emission from past accretion\nactivity onto supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\npeaks in the hard X-ray band (30 keV). In this paper, we identify a significant\nselection effect operating on the CXB and flux-limited AGN surveys, and outline\nhow they must depend heavily on the spin distribution of black holes. We show\nthat, due to the higher radiative efficiency of rapidly-spinning black holes,\nthey will be over-represented in the X-ray background, and therefore could be a\ndominant contributor to the CXB. Using a simple bimodal spin distribution, we\ndemonstrate that only 15 per cent maximally-spinning AGN can produce 50 per\ncent of the CXB. We also illustrate that invoking a small population of\nmaximally-spinning black holes in CXB synthesis models can reproduce the CXB\npeak without requiring large numbers of Compton-thick AGN. The spin bias is\neven more pronounced for flux-limited surveys: 7 per cent of sources with\nmaximally-spinning black holes can produce half of the source counts. The\ndetectability for maximum spin black holes can be further boosted in hard (>10\nkeV) X-rays by up to ~60 per cent due to pronounced ionised reflection,\nreducing the percentage of maximally spinning black holes required to produce\nhalf of the CXB or survey number counts further. A host of observations are\nconsistent with an over-representation of high-spin black holes. Future NuSTAR\nand ASTRO-H hard X-ray surveys will provide the best constraints on the role of\nspin within the AGN population.\n", "  In any atomic species, the spherically symmetric potential originating from\nthe charged nucleus results in fundamental symmetry properties governing the\nstructure of atomic states and transition rules between them. If atoms are\nexposed to external electric fields, these properties are modified giving rise\nto energy shifts such as the AC Stark-effect in varying fields and, contrary to\nthis in a constant (DC) electric field for high enough field strengths, the\nbreaking of the atomic symmetry which causes fundamental changes in the atom's\nproperties. This has already been observed for atomic Rydberg states with high\nprincipal quantum numbers. Here, we report on the observation of effects linked\nto symmetry breaking in helium within the optical cycle of the utilized strong\nvisible laser fields for states with principal quantum number n=2. These\nfindings were enabled by temporally resolving the dynamics better than the\nsub-optical cycle of the applied laser field, utilizing the method of\nattosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS). We identify the\nspectroscopic fingerprint of instantaneous polarization and breaking of the\nsymmetry of the atom in the intense visible femtosecond pulse used in an ATAS\nexperiment and develop a time domain picture describing the dipole response\nthat leads to these signatures. In the future, this general experimental\napproach can be used to measure strong-field induced symmetry-breaking effects\nin other atomic or molecular systems also consisting of two or more active\nelectrons and thus to examine new routes to their bound-state and\ntransition-state control by laser fields.\n", "  We start by studying a peeling process on finite random planar maps with\nfaces of arbitrary degrees determined by a general weight sequence, which\nsatisfies an admissibility criterion. The corresponding perimeter process is\nidentified as a biased random walk, in terms of which the admissibility\ncriterion has a very simple interpretation. The finite random planar maps under\nconsideration were recently proved to possess a well-defined local limit known\nas the infinite Boltzmann planar map (IBPM). Inspired by recent work of Curien\nand Le Gall, we show that the peeling process on the IBPM can be obtained from\nthe peeling process of finite random maps by conditioning the perimeter process\nto stay positive. The simplicity of the resulting description of the peeling\nprocess allows us to obtain the scaling limit of the associated perimeter and\nvolume process for arbitrary regular critical weight sequences.\n", "  The 122$^{*}$ series of iron-chalcogenide superconductors, for example\nK$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$, only possesses electron Fermi pockets. Their\ndistinctive electronic structure challenges the picture built upon iron\npnictide superconductors, where both electron and hole Fermi pockets coexist.\nHowever, partly due to the intrinsic phase separation in this family of\ncompounds, many aspects of their behavior remain elusive. In particular, the\nevolution of the 122$^{*}$ series of iron-chalcogenides with chemical\nsubstitution still lacks a microscopic and unified interpretation. Using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we studied a major fraction of\n122$^{*}$ iron-chalcogenides, including the isovalently `doped'\nK$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$, Rb$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$Te$_z$ and\n(Tl,K)$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$. We found that the bandwidths of the low\nenergy Fe \\textit{3d} bands in these materials depend on doping; and more\ncrucially, as the bandwidth decreases, the ground state evolves from a metal to\na superconductor, and eventually to an insulator, yet the Fermi surface in the\nmetallic phases is unaffected by the isovalent dopants. Moreover, the\ncorrelation-driven insulator found here with small band filling may be a novel\ninsulating phase. Our study shows that almost all the known 122$^{*}$-series\niron chalcogenides can be understood {\\it via} one unifying phase diagram which\nimplies that moderate correlation strength is beneficial for the\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  A scaled quantum computer with donor spins in silicon would benefit from a\nviable semiconductor framework and a strong inherent decoupling of the qubits\nfrom the noisy environment. Coupling neighbouring spins via the natural\nexchange interaction according to current designs requires gate control\nstructures with extremely small length scales. We present a silicon\narchitecture where bismuth donors with long coherence times are coupled to\nelectrons that can shuttle between adjacent quantum dots, thus relaxing the\npitch requirements and allowing space between donors for classical control\ndevices. An adiabatic SWAP operation within each donor/dot pair solves the\nscalability issues intrinsic to exchange-based two-qubit gates, as it does not\nrely on sub-nanometer precision in donor placement and is robust against noise\nin the control fields. We use this SWAP together with well established global\nmicrowave Rabi pulses and parallel electron shuttling to construct a surface\ncode that needs minimal, feasible local control.\n", "  We study a supergauge transformation of a complex superfield which generates\na chiral superfield in two-dimensional ${\\cal N}=(2,2)$ theory. This complex\nsuperfield is referred to as the prepotential of the chiral superfield. Since\nthere exist redundant component fields in the prepotential, we remove some of\nthem by a gauge-fixing condition. This situation is parallel to that of a\nvector superfield. In order to obtain a suitable configuration of the GLSM for\nthe exotic five-brane which gives rise to a nongeometric background, we impose\na relatively relaxed gauge-fixing condition. It turns out that the gauge-fixed\nprepotential is different from a semichiral superfield whose scalar field\nrepresents a coordinate of generalized K\\\"{a}hler geometry.\n", "  We reports direct and scalable measurement of multiparticle entanglement\nconcurrence and three-tangle with embedding photonic quantum simulators. In\nthis embedding framework [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240502 (2013)], $N$-qubit\nentanglement monotone, which associates with non-Hermitian operators, can be\nefficiently measured with only 2 (for even $N$) and 6 (for odd $N$) local\nmeasurement settings. Our experiment uses a multiphoton quantum simulator to\nmimic the dynamical entanglement evolution and track its concurrence and\nthree-tangle.\n", "  We demonstrate the long range strong coupling of magnetostatic modes in\nspatially separated ferromagnets mediated by a microwave frequency cavity. Two\nspheres of yttrium iron garnet are embedded in the cavity and their\nmagnetostatic modes probed using a dispersive measurement technique. We find\nthey are strongly coupled to each other even when detuned from the cavity\nmodes. We investigate the dependence of the magnet-magnet coupling on the\ncavity detuning $\\Delta$, and find a $1/\\Delta$ dependence also characteristic\nof cavity-coupled superconducting qubits. Dark states of the coupled\nmagnetostatic modes of the system are observed, and ascribed to mismatches\nbetween the symmetries of the modes and the drive field.\n", "  Photons of a laser beam driving the upper motional sideband of an\noptomechanical cavity can decay into photon-phonon pairs by means of an\noptomechanical parametric process. The phononic state can subsequently be\nmapped to a photonic state by exciting the lower sideband, hence creating\nphoton-photon pairs out of an optomechanical system. We here demonstrate that\nthese pairs can violate a Bell inequality when they are measured with photon\ncounting techniques preceded by small displacement operations in the phase\nspace. Our results show how to detect non-local light-mechanical correlations\nand open the way for device-independent quantum optomechanics where\nnon-classical light-mechanical correlations can be certified without\nassumptions on the state structure or on the measurement devices.\n", "  We derive an explicit sum formula for symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Our\nexpression contains multiple sums over the symmetric group and uses the action\nof Hecke generators on the ring of polynomials. In the special cases $t=1$ and\n$q=0$, we recover known expressions for the monomial symmetric and\nHall-Littlewood polynomials, respectively. Other specializations of our formula\ngive new expressions for the Jack and $q$-Whittaker polynomials.\n", "  The interplay between quantum-mechanical properties, such as coherence, and\nclassical notions, such as energy, is a subtle topic at the forefront of\nquantum thermodynamics. The traditional Carnot argument limits the conversion\nof heat to work; here we critically assess the problem of converting coherence\nto work. Through a careful account of all resources involved in the\nthermodynamic transformations within a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we\nshow that there exist thermal machines extracting work from coherence\narbitrarily well. Such machines only need to act on individual copies of a\nstate and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal\nmachine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted\nas work. However, even bounded thermal machines can be reused infinitely many\ntimes in the process of work extraction from coherence.\n", "  Opto- and electromechanical systems offer an effective platform to test\nquantum theory and its predictions at macroscopic scales. To date, all\nexperiments presuppose the validity of quantum mechanics, but could in\nprinciple be described by a hypothetical local statistical theory. Here we\nsuggest a Bell test using the electromechanical Einstein-Podolski-Rosen\nentangled state recently generated by Palomaki et al., which would rule out any\nlocal and realistic explanation of the measured data without assuming the\nvalidity of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. It additionally provides a\ndevice-independent way to verify electromechanical entanglement. The parameter\nregime required for our scheme has been demonstrated or is within reach of\ncurrent experiments.\n", "  We present an improved numerical relativity (NR) calibration of the new\neffective-one-body (EOB) model for coalescing non precessing spinning black\nhole binaries recently introduced by Damour and Nagar [Physical Review D 90,\n044018 (2014)]. We do so by comparing the EOB predictions to both the phasing\nand the energetics provided by two independent sets of NR data covering mass\nratios $1\\leq q \\leq 9.989$ and dimensionless spin range $-0.95\\leq \\chi\\leq\n+0.994$. One set of data is a subset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)\ncatalog of public waveforms; the other set consists of new simulations obtained\nwith the Llama code plus Cauchy Characteristic Evolution. We present the first\nsystematic computation of the gauge-invariant relation between the binding\nenergy and the total angular momentum, $E_{b}(j)$, for a large sample of,\nspin-aligned, SXS and Llama data. The dynamics of the EOB model presented here\ninvolves only two free functional parameters, one ($a_6^c(\\nu)$) entering the\nnon spinning sector, as a 5PN effective correction to the interaction\npotential, and one ($c_3(\\tilde{a}_1,\\tilde{a}_2,\\nu))$ in the spinning sector,\nas an effective next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order correction to the\nspin-orbit coupling. These parameters are determined (together with a third\nfunctional parameter $\\Delta t_{\\rm NQC}(\\chi)$ entering the waveform) by\ncomparing the EOB phasing with the SXS phasing, the consistency of the\nenergetics being checked afterwards. The quality of the analytical model for\ngravitational wave data analysis purposes is assessed by computing the EOB/NR\nfaithfulness. Over the NR data sample and when varying the total mass between\n20 and 200~$M_\\odot$ the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (integrated over the NR\nfrequency range) is found to vary between $99.493\\%$ and $99.984\\%$ with a\nmedian value of $99.944\\%$.\n", "  We propose a superconducting circuit comprising a dc-SQUID with mechanically\ncompliant arm embedded in a coplanar microwave cavity that realizes an\noptomechanical system with a degenerate or non-degenerate parametric\ninteraction generated via the dynamical Casimir effect. For experimentally\nfeasible parameters, this setup is capable of reaching the single-photon,\nultra-strong coupling regime, while simultaneously possessing a parametric\ncoupling strength approaching the renormalized cavity frequency. This opens up\nthe possibility of observing the interplay between these two fundamental\nnonlinearities at the single-photon level.\n", "  The abundance of compact, massive, early-type galaxies (ETGs) provides\nimportant constraints to galaxy formation scenarios. Thanks to the area\ncovered, depth, excellent spatial resolution and seeing, the ESO Public optical\nKilo Degree Survey (KiDS), carried out with the VLT Survey Telescope (VST),\noffers a unique opportunity to conduct a complete census of the most compact\ngalaxies in the Universe. This paper presents a first census of such systems\nfrom the first 156 square degrees of KiDS. Our analysis relies on g-, r-, and\ni-band effective radii ($R_{\\rm e}$), derived by fitting galaxy images with\nPSF-convolved S\\'ersic models, high-quality photometric redshifts, $z_{\\rm\nphot}$, estimated from machine learning techniques, and stellar masses, $M_{\\rm\n\\star}$, calculated from KiDS aperture photometry. After massiveness ($M_{\\rm\n\\star} > 8 \\times 10^{10}\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$) and compactness ($R_{\\rm e} < 1.5\n\\, \\rm kpc$ in g-, r- and i-bands) criteria are applied, a visual inspection of\nthe candidates plus near-infrared photometry from VIKING-DR1 are used to refine\nour sample. The final catalog, to be spectroscopically confirmed, consists of\n92 systems in the redshift range $z \\sim 0.2-0.7$. This sample, which we expect\nto increase by a factor of ten over the total survey area, represents the first\nattempt to select massive super-compact ETGs (MSCGs) in KiDS. We investigate\nthe impact of redshift systematics in the selection, finding that this seems to\nbe a major source of contamination in our sample. A preliminary analysis shows\nthat MSCGs exhibit negative internal colour gradients, consistent with a\npassive evolution of these systems. We find that the number density of MSCGs is\nonly mildly consistent with predictions from simulations at $z>0.2$, while no\nsuch system is found at $z < 0.2$.\n", "  The depletion interaction mediated by non-adsorbing polymers promotes\ncondensation and assembly of repulsive colloidal particles into diverse\nhigher-order structures and materials. One example, with particularly rich\nemergent behaviors, is the formation of two-dimensional colloidal membranes\nfrom a suspension of filamentous $\\it{fd}$ viruses, which act as rods with\neffective repulsive interactions, and dextran, which acts as a condensing,\ndepletion-inducing agent. Colloidal membranes exhibit chiral twist even when\nthe constituent virus mixture lacks macroscopic chirality, change from a\ncircular shape to a striking starfish shape upon changing the chirality of\nconstituent rods, and partially coalesce via domain walls through which the\nviruses twist by $180^\\circ$. We formulate an entropically-motivated theory\nthat can quantitatively explain these experimental structures and measurements,\nboth previously published and newly performed, over a wide range of\nexperimental conditions. Our results elucidate how entropy alone, manifested\nthrough the viruses as Frank elastic energy and through the depletants as an\neffective surface tension, drives the formation and behavior of these diverse\nstructures. Our generalizable principles propose the existence of analogous\neffects in molecular membranes and can be exploited in the design of\nreconfigurable colloidal structures.\n", "  Matter-neutrino resonances (MNR) can occur in environments where the flux of\nelectron antineutrinos is greater than the flux of electron neutrinos. These\nresonances may result in dramatic neutrino flavor transformation. Compact\nobject merger disks are an example of an environment where electron\nantineutrinos outnumber neutrinos. We study MNR resonances in several such disk\nconfigurations and find two qualitatively different types of matter-neutrino\nresonances: a standard MNR and a symmetric MNR. We examine the transformation\nthat occurs in each type of resonance and explore the consequences for\nnucleosynthesis.\n", "  Precision absolute gravity measurements are growing in importance, especially\nin the context of the new definition of the kilogram. For the case of free-fall\nabsolute gravimeters with a Michelson-type interferometer tracking the position\nof a free falling body, one of the effects that needs to be taken into account\nis the speed of light perturbation due to the finite speed of propagation of\nlight. This effect has been extensively discussed in the past, and there is at\npresent a disagreement between different studies. In this work, we present the\nanalysis of new data and confirm the result expected from the theoretical\nanalysis applied nowadays in free-fall gravimeters. We also review the standard\nderivations of this effect (by using phase shift or Doppler effect arguments)\nand show their equivalence.\n", "  Intermediate mass protostarsprovide a bridge between theories of low- and\nhigh-mass star formation. Emerging molecular outflows can be used to determine\nthe influence of fragmentation and multiplicity on protostellar evolution\nthrough the correlation of outflow forces of intermediate mass protostars with\nthe luminosity. The aim of this paper is to derive outflow forces from outflows\nof six intermediate mass protostellar regions and validate the apparent\ncorrelation between total luminosity and outflow force seen in earlier work, as\nwell as remove uncertainties caused by different methodology. By comparing CO\n6--5 observations obtained with APEX with non-LTE radiative transfer model\npredictions, optical depths, temperatures, densities of the gas of the\nmolecular outflows are derived. Outflow forces, dynamical timescales and\nkinetic luminosities are subsequently calculated. Outflow parameters, including\nthe forces, were derived for all sources. Temperatures in excess of 50 K were\nfound for all flows, in line with recent low-mass results. However, comparison\nwith other studies could not corroborate conclusions from earlier work on\nintermediate mass protostars which hypothesized that fragmentation enhances\noutflow forces in clustered intermediate mass star formation. Any enhancement\nin comparison with the classical relation between outflow force and luminosity\ncan be attributed the use of a higher excitation line and improvement in\nmethods; They are in line with results from low-mass protostars using similar\ntechniques. The role of fragmentation on outflows is an important ingredient to\nunderstand clustered star formation and the link between low and high-mass star\nformation. However, detailed information on spatial scales of a few 100 AU,\ncovering all individual members is needed to make the necessary progress.\n", "  Can a black hole that suffers a superradiant instability evolve towards a\n'hairy' configuration which is stable? We address this question in the context\nof Einstein-charged scalar field theory. First, we describe a family of static\nblack hole solutions which possess charged scalar-field hair confined within a\nmirror-like boundary. Next, we derive a set of equations which govern the\nlinear, spherically symmetric perturbations of these hairy solutions. We\npresent numerical evidence which suggests that, unlike the vacuum solutions,\nthe (single-node) hairy solutions are stable under linear perturbations. Thus,\nit is plausible that stable hairy black holes represent the end-point of the\nsuperradiant instability of electrically-charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holes\nin a cavity; we outline ways to explore this hypothesis.\n", "  We present an efficient quantum algorithm for beyond-Born-Oppenheimer\nmolecular energy computations. Our approach combines the quantum full\nconfiguration interaction method with the nuclear orbital plus molecular\norbital (NOMO) method. We give the details of the algorithm and demonstrate its\nperformance by classical simulations. Two isotopomers of the hydrogen molecule\n(H$_2$, HT) were chosen as representative examples and calculations of the\nlowest rotationless vibrational transition energies were simulated.\n", "  Hypergraph states form a family of multiparticle quantum states that\ngeneralizes the well-known concept of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states,\ncluster states, and more broadly graph states. We study the nonlocal properties\nof quantum hypergraph states. We demonstrate that the correlations in\nhypergraph states can be used to derive various types of nonlocality proofs,\nincluding Hardy-type arguments and Bell inequalities for genuine multiparticle\nnonlocality. Moreover, we show that hypergraph states allow for an\nexponentially increasing violation of local realism which is robust against\nloss of particles. Our results suggest that certain classes of hypergraph\nstates are novel resources for quantum metrology and measurement-based quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  Topological insulators have attracted abundant attention for a variety of\nreasons -- notably, the possibility for lossless energy transport through edge\nstates `protected' against disorder. Topological effects like the Quantum Hall\nstate can be induced through a gauge field, which is however hard to create in\npractice, especially for charge-neutral particles. One way to induce an\neffective gauge potential is through a dynamic, time-periodic modulation of the\nlattice confining such particles. In this way, the Haldane Quantum Hall effect\nwas recently observed in a cold atom system. Here, we show how this same effect\ncan be induced for light confined to a lattice of identical optical resonators,\nusing an on-site modulation of the resonant frequencies. We further demonstrate\nthe existence of one-directional edge states immune to back-scattering losses,\nand discuss the possibilities for a practical implementation, which would\nenable slow-light devices of unprecedented quality.\n", "  It has previously been conjectured that the theory of free fundamental\nscalars minimally coupled to a Chern Simons gauge field is dual to the theory\nof critical fundamental fermions minimally coupled to a level rank dual Chern\nSimons gauge field. In this paper we study RG flows away from these two fixed\npoints by turning on relevant operators. In the t' Hooft large N limit we\ncompute the thermal partition along each of these flows and find a map of\nparameters under which the two partition functions agree exactly with each\nother all the way from the UV to the IR. We conjecture that the bosonic and\nfermionic RG flows are dual to each other under this map of parameters. Our\nflows can be tuned to end at the gauged critical scalar theory and gauged free\nfermionic theories respectively. Assuming the validity of our conjecture, this\ntuned trajectory may be viewed as RG flow from the gauged theory of free bosons\nto the gauged theory of free fermions.\n", "  AlN thin films have been grown on Si (100) substrates by reactive ion beam\nsputter deposition (IBSD) at different substrate temperatures varying from room\ntemperature (RT) to 500oC. Substrate temperature induced microstructural\ntransition from amorphous at RT, nanocrystalline at 300oC to microcrystalline\nat 400oC has been observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Average\nsurface roughness (Ra) and morphology has been explored by using Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM). UV-VIS spectrophotometry has been employed to probe the\nsubstrate temperature induced changes in optical band-gap (Eg) of grown thin\nfilms in reflectance mode. It was found that Eg was increased from 5.08 to 5.21\neV as substrate temperature was increased from RT to 500oC. Urbach energy tail\n(Eu) along with weak absorption tail (WAT) energy (Et) have been estimated to\naccount for the optical disorder which was found to decrease with associated\nincrease in Eg.\n", "  We review the recently discovered spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and\nrelated effects from a theoretical point of view. The SMR is observed in\nbilayers of a magnetic insulator and a metal, in which spin currents\naregenerated in the normal metal due to the spin Hall effect. The associated\nangular momentum transfer to the ferromagnetic layer and thereby the electrical\nresistance is modulated by the angle between the applied current and the\nmagnetization direction. The SMR provides a convenient tool to non-invasively\nmeasure the magnetization direction and spin-transfer torque to an insulator.\nWe introduce the minimal theoretical instruments to calculate the SMR, i.e.\nspin diffusion theory and quantum mechanical boundary conditions. This leads to\na small set of parameters that can be fitted to experiments. We discuss the\nlimitations of the theory as well as alternative mechanisms such as the\nferromagnetic proximity effect and Rashba spin-orbit torques, and point out new\ndevelopments related to the SMR.\n", "  We report the discovery of the sixth known eclipsing double white dwarf (WD)\nsystem, SDSS J1152+0248, with a 2.3968 +/- 0.0003 h orbital period, in data\nfrom the Kepler Mission's K2 continuation. Analysing and modelling the K2 data\ntogether with ground-based fast photometry, spectroscopy, and radial-velocity\nmeasurements, we determine that the primary is a DA-type WD with mass M1 = 0.47\n+/- 0.11 Msun, radius R1 = 0.0197 +/- 0.0035 Rsun, and cooling age t1 = 52 +/-\n36 Myr. No lines are detected, to within our sensitivity, from the secondary\nWD, but it is likely also of type DA. Its central surface brightness, as\nmeasured from the secondary eclipse, is 0.31 of the primary's surface\nbrightness. Its mass, radius, and cooling age, respectively, are M2 = 0.44 +/-\n0.09 Msun, R2 = 0.0223 +0.0064 -0.0050 Rsun, and t2 = 230 +/- 100 Myr. SDSS\nJ1152+0248 is a near twin of the double-lined eclipsing WD system CSS 41177.\n", "  We consider the emission spectrum of high-energy electrons in an intense\nlaser field. At high intensities ($a_0\\sim200$) we find that the QED theory\npredicts a narrower angular spread of emissions than the classical theory. This\nis due to the classical theory overestimating the energy loss of the particles,\nresulting in them becoming more susceptible to reflection in the laser pulse.\n", "  Motivated by high interest in the close relation between string theory and\nblack hole solutions, in this paper, we take into account the\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian in the context of massive gravity. We examine\nthe possibility of black hole in this regard, and discuss the types of\nhorizons. Next, we calculate conserved and thermodynamic quantities and check\nthe validity of the first law of thermodynamics. In addition, we investigate\nthe stability of these black holes in context of canonical ensemble. We show\nthat number, type and place of phase transition points may be significantly\naffected by different parameters. Next, by considering cosmological constant as\nthermodynamical pressure, we will extend phase space and calculate critical\nvalues. Then, we construct thermodynamical spacetime by considering mass as\nthermodynamical potential. We study geometrical thermodynamics of these black\nholes in context of heat capacity and extended phase space. We show that\nstudying heat capacity, geometrical thermodynamics and critical behavior in\nextended phase space lead to consistent results. Finally, we will employ a new\nmethod for obtaining critical values and show that the results of this method\nare consistent with those of other methods.\n", "  This paper experimentally and theoretically investigates the fundamental\nbounds on radio localization precision of far-field Received Signal Strength\n(RSS) measurements. RSS measurements are proportional to power-flow\nmeasurements time-averaged over periods long compared to the coherence time of\nthe radiation. Our experiments are performed in a novel localization setup\nusing 2.4GHz quasi-monochromatic radiation, which corresponds to a mean\nwavelength of 12.5cm. We experimentally and theoretically show that RSS\nmeasurements are cross-correlated over a minimum distance that approaches the\ndiffraction limit, which equals half the mean wavelength of the radiation. Our\nexperiments show that measuring RSS beyond a sampling density of one sample per\nhalf the mean wavelength does not increase localization precision, as the\nRoot-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) converges asymptotically to roughly half the\nmean wavelength. This adds to the evidence that the diffraction limit\ndetermines (1) the lower bound on localization precision and (2) the sampling\ndensity that provides optimal localization precision. We experimentally\nvalidate the theoretical relations between Fisher information, Cram\\'er-Rao\nLower Bound (CRLB) and uncertainty, where uncertainty is lower bounded by\ndiffraction as derived from coherence and speckle theory. When we reconcile\nFisher Information with diffraction, the CRLB matches the experimental results\nwith an accuracy of 97-98%.\n", "  Ultracold neutrons (UCNs) were produced in a 4 liter volume of superfluid\nhelium using the PF1B cold neutron beam facility at the Institut Laue-Langevin\nand then extracted to a detector at room temperature. With a converter\ntemperature of 1.08 K the number of accumulated UCNs was counted to be\n$91,\\!700 \\pm 300$. From this, we derive a volumetric UCN production rate of\n$(6.9 \\pm 1.7)\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\,s^{-1}}$, which includes a correction for\nlosses in the converter during UCN extraction caused by a short storage time,\nbut not accounting for UCN transport and detection efficiencies. The\nup-scattering rate of UCNs due to excitations in the superfluid was studied by\nscanning the temperature between 1.2-2.4 K. Using the temperature-dependent UCN\nproduction rate calculated from inelastic neutron scattering data in the\nanalysis, the only UCN up-scattering process found to be present was from\ntwo-phonon scattering. Our analysis rules out contributions from the other\nscattering processes to $\\lesssim 10\\%$ of their predicted levels.\n", "  We study electromagnetic field propagation through a planar three-waveguide\ncoupler with linear gain and loss, in a configuration that is the optical\nanalog of a quantum $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, and provide its\nclosed-form analytic propagator. At an specific propagation length, we show\nthat the device provides all-optical amplitude to phase modulation with a $\\pi$\nmodulation range, if an extra binary phase is allowed in the reference signal,\nas well as phase to amplitude modulation, with an amplitude modulation range\nthat depends linearly on the gain-to-coupling ratio of the system.\n", "  We expand the Tsallis distribution in a Taylor series of powers of (q-1),\nwhere q is the Tsallis parameter, assuming q is very close to 1. This helps in\nstudying the degree of deviation of transverse momentum spectra and other\nthermodynamic quantities from a thermalized Boltzmann distribution. After\nchecking thermodynamic consistency, we provide analytical results for the\nTsallis distribution in the presence of collective flow up to the first order\nof (q-1). The formulae are compared with the experimental data.\n", "  Quantum steering refers to the possibility for Alice to remotely steer Bob's\nstate by performing local measurements on her half of a bipartite system. Two\nnecessary ingredients for steering are entanglement and incompatibility of\nAlice's measurements. In particular, it has been recently proven that for the\ncase of pure states of maximal Schmidt rank the problem of steerability for\nBob's assemblage is equivalent to the problem of joint measurability for\nAlice's observables. We show that such an equivalence holds in general, namely,\nthe steerability of any assemblage can always be formulated as a joint\nmeasurability problem, and vice versa. We use this connection to introduce\nsteering inequalities from joint measurability criteria and develop quantifiers\nfor the incompatibility of measurements.\n", "  There are claims in the literature that the cosmological constant problem\ncould be solved in a braneworld model with two large (micron-sized)\nsupersymmetric extra dimensions. The mechanism relies on two basic ingredients:\nFirst, the cosmological constant only curves the compact bulk geometry into a\nrugby shape while the 4D curvature stays flat. Second, a brane-localized flux\nterm is introduced in order to circumvent Weinberg's fine-tuning argument,\nwhich otherwise enters here through a backdoor via the flux quantization\ncondition. In this paper, we show that the latter mechanism does not work in\nthe way it was designed: The only localized flux coupling that guarantees a\nflat on-brane geometry is one which preserves the scale invariance of the bulk\ntheory. Consequently, Weinberg's argument applies, making a fine-tuning\nnecessary again. The only remaining window of opportunity lies within scale\ninvariance breaking brane couplings, for which the tuning could be avoided.\nWhether the corresponding 4D curvature could be kept under control and in\nagreement with the observed value will be answered in our companion paper\n[arXiv:1512.03800].\n", "  In many applications a source of the black-body radiation (BBR) can be highly\nanisotropic. This leads to the BBR shift that depends on tensor polarizability\nand on the projection of the total angular momentum of ions and atoms in a\ntrap. We derived formula for the anisotropic BBR shift and performed numerical\ncalculations of this effect for Ca$^+$ and Yb$^+$ transitions of experimental\ninterest. These ions used for a design of high-precision atomic clocks,\nfundamental physics tests such as search for the Lorentz invariance violation\nand space-time variation of the fundamental constants, and quantum information.\nAnisotropic BBR shift may be one of the major systematic effect in these\nexperiments.\n", "  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves with extraordinary rapidity.\nHowever, its evolution is constrained by interactions between mutations in its\nfitness landscape. Here we show that an Ising model describing these\ninteractions, inferred from sequence data obtained prior to the use of\nantiretroviral drugs, can be used to identify clinically significant sites of\nresistance mutations. Successful predictions of the resistance sites indicate\nprogress in the development of successful models of real viral evolution at the\nsingle residue level, and suggest that our approach may be applied to help\ndesign new therapies that are less prone to failure even where resistance data\nis not yet available.\n", "  Elemental 2D materials exhibit intriguing heat transport and phononic\nproperties. Here we have investigated the lattice thermal conductivity of newly\nproposed arsenene, the 2D honeycomb structure of arsenic, using {\\it ab initio}\ncalculations. Solving the Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, we predict\na highly anisotropic thermal conductivity, of $30.4$ and $7.8$ W/mK along the\nzigzag and armchair directions, respectively at room temperature. Our\ncalculations reveal that phonons with mean free paths between $20$ nm and $1$\n$\\mu$m provide the main contribution to the large thermal conductivity in the\nzig-zag direction, mean free paths of phonons contributing to heat transport in\nthe armchair directions range between $20$ and $100$ nm. The obtained low and\nanisotropic thermal conductivity, and feasibility of synthesis, in addition to\nother reports on high electron mobility, make arsenene a promising material for\na variety of applications, including thermal management and thermoelectric\ndevices.\n", "  We consider a particular one-parameter family of q-analogues of multiple zeta\nvalues. The intrinsic q-regularisation permits an extension of these q-multiple\nzeta values to negative integers. Renormalised multiple zeta values satisfying\nthe quasi-shuffle product are obtained using an Hopf algebraic Birkhoff\nfactorisation together with minimal subtraction.\n", "  A fundamental understanding of phonon transport in stanene is crucial to\npredict the thermal performance in potential stanene-based devices. By\ncombining first-principle calculation and phonon Boltzmann transport equation,\nwe obtain the lattice thermal conductivity of stanene. A much lower thermal\nconductivity (11.6 W/mK) is observed in stanene, which indicates higher\nthermoelectric efficiency over other 2D materials. The contributions of\nacoustic and optical phonons to the lattice thermal conductivity are evaluated.\nDetailed analysis of phase space for three-phonon processes shows that phonon\nscattering channels LA+LA/TA/ZA$\\leftrightarrow$TA/ZA are restricted, leading\nto the dominant contributions of high-group-velocity LA phonons to the thermal\nconductivity. The size dependence of thermal conductivity is investigated as\nwell for the purpose of the design of thermoelectric nanostructures.\n", "  Diamondoids are hydrocarbons having a carbon scaffold comprised from\npolymer-like composites of adamantane cages. The present paper describes\ncomputed total energies and \"SWB-tension\" energies (often referred to as\n\"strain\" energies) for species having $n$ adamantane or diamantane units\nsharing pairwise: one carbon atom (spiro-[n]adamantane or\nspiro-[$n$]diamantane); one C-C bond (one-bond-sharing-[$n$]adamantane or\none-bond-sharing-[$n$]diamantane); or one chair-shaped hexagon of carbon atoms\n(1234-helical-cata-[$n$]diamantanes). Each of the five investigated\npolymer-like types is considered either as an acyclic or a cyclic chain of\nadamantane- or diamantane-unit cages. With increasing $n$ values, SWB-tension\nenergies for acyclic aggregates are found to increase linearly, while the net\nSWB-tension energies of cyclic aggregates often go thru a minimum at a suitable\nvalue of $n$. In all five cases, a limiting common energy per unit ($E/n$ ) is\nfound to be approached by both cyclic and acyclic chains as $n\\to \\infty $, as\nrevealed from plots of $E/n$ versus $1/n$ for acyclic chains and of $E/n$\nversus $1/n^2$ for cyclic chains.\n", "  We propose an approach for collective enhancement of precision for remotely\nlocated optical lattice clocks and a way of generation of the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen state of remote clocks. Close to Heisenberg scaling of\nthe clock precision with the number of clocks M can be achieved even for an\noptical channel connecting clocks with substantial losses. This scenario\nutilizes a collective quantum nondemolition measurement on clocks with parallel\nBloch vectors for enhanced measurement precision. We provide an optimal network\nsolution for distant clocks as well as for clocks positioned in close proximity\nof each other. In the second scenario, we employ collective dissipation to\ndrive two clocks with oppositely oriented Bloch vectors into a steady state\nentanglement. The corresponding EPR entanglement provides enhanced time sharing\nbeyond the projection noise limit between the two quantum synchronized clocks\nprotected from eavesdropping, as well as allows better characterization of\nsystematic effects.\n", "  We identify a new universality class in one-dimensional driven open quantum\nsystems with a dark state. Salient features are the persistence of both the\nmicroscopic non-equilibrium conditions as well as the quantum coherence of\ndynamics close to criticality. This provides a non-equilibrium analogue of\nquantum criticality, and is sharply distinct from more generic driven systems,\nwhere both effective thermalization as well as asymptotic decoherence ensue,\nparalleling classical dynamical criticality. We quantify universality by\ncomputing the full set of independent critical exponents within a functional\nrenormalization group approach.\n", "  Central frequency is a key parameter of storage rings. This paper presents\nthe measurement of central frequency of the HLS-II storage ring using the\nsextupole modulation method. Firstly, the basis of central frequency\nmeasurement of the electron storage ring is briefly introduced. Then, the error\nsources and the optimized measurement method for the HLS-II storage ring are\ndiscussed. The workflow of the self-compiled Matlab script used in central\nfrequency measurement is also described. In the end, the results achieved by\nusing two methods to cross-check each other are shown. The measured value of\nthe central frequency demonstrates that the real circumference of the HLS-II\nstorage ring agrees well with the designed value.\n", "  We study the effects of Coulomb interaction between 2D Weyl fermions with\nanisotropic dispersion which displays relativistic dynamics along one direction\nand Newtonian dynamics along the other. Such a dispersion can be realized in\nphosphorene under electric field or strain, in TiO$_2$/VO$_2$ superlattices,\nand, more generally, at the quantum critical point between a nodal semimetal\nand an insulator in systems with a chiral symmetry. Using the one-loop\nrenormalization group approach in combination with the large-$N$ expansion, we\nfind that the system displays interaction-driven non-Fermi liquid behavior in a\nwide range of intermediate frequencies and marginal Fermi liquid behavior at\nthe smallest frequencies. In the non-Fermi liquid regime, the quasiparticle\nresidue $Z$ at energy $E$ scales as $Z \\propto E^a$ with $a >0$, and the\nparameters of the fermionic dispersion acquire anomalous dimensions. In the\nmarginal Fermi-liquid regime, $Z \\propto (|\\log E|)^{-b}$ with universal $b =\n3/2$.\n", "  The topological crystalline insulator tin telluride is known to host\nsuperconductivity when doped with indium (Sn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te), and for low\nindium contents ($x=0.04$) it is known that the topological surface states are\npreserved. Here we present the growth, characterization and angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy analysis of samples with much heavier In doping (up\nto $x\\approx0.4$), a regime where the superconducting temperature is increased\nnearly fourfold. We demonstrate that despite strong p-type doping, Dirac-like\nsurface states persist.\n", "  The many-body localization transition is a dynamical quantum phase transition\nbetween a localized and an extended phase. We study this transition in the XXZ\nmodel with disordered magnetic field and focus on the time evolution following\na global quantum quench. While the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement and\nspin fluctuations are already known to provide insights into the nature of the\nmany-body localized phases, we discuss the relevance of these quantities in the\ncontext of the localization transition. In particular, we observe that near the\ntransition the long time limits of both quantities show behavior similar to\ndivergent thermodynamic fluctuations.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate the flow field that emerges\nfrom a rod-like microrotor rotating about its center in a non-axisymmetric\nmanner. A simple theoretical model is proposed that uses a superposition of two\nrotlets as a fundamental solution to the Stokes equation. The predictions of\nthis model are compared to measurements of the azimuthal and radial\nmicrofluidic velocity field components that are induced by a rotor composed of\nfused microscopic spheres. The rotor is driven magnetically and the fluid flow\nis measured with the help of a probe particle fixed by an optical tweezer. We\nfind considerable deviations of the mere azimuthal flow pattern induced by a\nsingle rotating sphere as it has been reported by Di Leonardo \\textit{et al.}\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 134502 (2006)]. Notably, the presence of a radial\nvelocity component that manifests itself by an oscillation of the probe\nparticle with twice the rotor frequency is observed. These findings open up a\nway to discuss possible radial transport in microfluidic devices.\n", "  The operation of an integrated two-dimensional complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor inverter with well-matched input/output voltages is\nreported. The circuit combines a few-layer MoS2 n-MOSFET and a black phosphorus\n(BP) p-MOSFET fabricated using a common local backgate electrode with thin (20\nnm) HfO2 gate dielectric. The constituent devices have linear threshold\nvoltages of -0.8 V and +0.8 V and produce peak transconductances of 16 uS/um\nand 41 uS/um for the MoS2 n-MOSFET and BP p-MOSFET, respectively. The inverter\nshows a voltage gain of 3.5 at a supply voltage, VDD = 2.5 V, and has peak\nswitching current of 108 uA and off-state current of 8.4 uA (2.4 uA) at VIN = 0\n(VIN = 2.5 V). In addition, the inverter has voltage gain greater than unity\nfor VDD > 0.5 V, has open butterfly curves for VDD > 1 V, and achieves static\nnoise margin over 500 mV at VDD = 2.5 V. The voltage gain was found to be\ninsensitive to temperature between 270 K and 340 K, and AC large and\nsmall-signal operation was demonstrated at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The\ndemonstration of a complementary 2D inverter which operates in a symmetric\nvoltage window suitable for driving a subsequent logic stage is a significant\nstep forward in developing practical applications for devices based upon 2D\nmaterials.\n", "  We introduce Rosetta, a program allowing for the translation between\ndifferent bases of effective field theory operators. We present the main\nfunctions of the program and provide an example of usage. One of the\nLagrangians which Rosetta can translate into has been implemented into\nFeynRules, which allows Rosetta to be interfaced into various high-energy\nphysics programs such as Monte Carlo event generators. In addition to popular\nbases choices, such as the Warsaw and Strongly Interacting Light Higgs bases\nalready implemented in the program, we also detail how to add new operator\nbases into the Rosetta package. In this way, phenomenological studies using an\neffective field theory framework can be straightforwardly performed.\n", "  We study the transient heat current out of a confined electron system into a\nweakly coupled electrode in response to a voltage switch. We show that the\ndecay of the Coulomb interaction energy for this repulsive system exhibits\nsignatures of electron-electron attraction, and is governed by an\ninteraction-independent rate. This can only be understood from a general\nduality that relates the non-unitary evolution of a quantum system to that of a\ndual model with inverted energies. Deriving from the fermion-parity\nsuperselection postulate, this duality applies to a large class of open\nsystems.\n", "  The dynamics of many natural systems is dominated by non-linear waves\npropagating through the medium. We show that the dynamics of non-linear wave\nfronts with positive surface tension can be formulated as a gradient system.\nThe variational potential is simply given by a linear combination of the\noccupied volume and surface area of the wave front, and changes monotonically\nin time. Finally, we demonstrate that vortex filaments can be written as a\ngradient system only if their binormal velocity component vanishes, which\noccurs in chemical system with equal diffusion of reactants.\n", "  We theoretically study, through combining the density functional theory and\nan unfolding technique, the electronic band structure and the charge doping\neffects for the deposition of potassium (K) on multilayer FeSe films grown on\nSrTiO3 (001) surface. These results form a theoretical base line for further\ndetailed studies of low-temperature electronic properties and their multiway\nquantum engineering of FeSe thin films. We explain the Fermi surface topology\nobserved in experiment and formulate the amount of doped electrons as a\nfunction of atomic K coverage. We show that the atomic K deposition efficiently\ndopes electrons to top layer FeSe. Both checkerboard and pair-checkerboard\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) FeSe layers show electron pockets at M point and no\nFermi pocket at $\\Gamma$ point with moderate atomic K coverage. The electron\ntransfer from K adsorbate to FeSe film introduces a strong electric field,\nwhich leads to a double-Weyl cone structure at M point in the Brillouin zone of\ncheckerboard-AFM FeSe. We demonstrate that with experimentally accessible heavy\nelectron doping, an electron-like Fermi pocket will emerge at $\\Gamma$ point,\nwhich should manifest itself in modulating the high-temperature\nsuperconductivity of FeSe thin films.\n", "  We report a measurement of the differential cross section of $\\pi^0$ pair\nproduction in single-tag two-photon collisions, $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi^0\n\\pi^0$, in $e^+ e^-$ scattering. The cross section is measured for $Q^2$ up to\n30 GeV$^2$, where $Q^2$ is the negative of the invariant mass squared of the\ntagged photon, in the kinematic range 0.5 GeV < W < 2.1 GeV and $|\\cos\n\\theta^*|$ < 1.0 for the total energy and pion scattering angle, respectively,\nin the $\\gamma^* \\gamma$ center-of-mass system. The results are based on a data\nsample of 759 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB\nasymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider. The transition form factor of the\n$f_0(980)$ and that of the $f_2(1270)$ with the helicity-0, -1, and -2\ncomponents separately are measured for the first time and are compared with\ntheoretical calculations.\n", "  Spin-$S$ Heisenberg quantum antiferromagnets on the Kagome lattice offer,\nwhen placed in a magnetic field, a fantastic playground to observe exotic\nphases of matter with (magnetic analogs of) superfluid, charge, bond or nematic\norders, or a coexistence of several of the latter. In this context, we have\nobtained the (zero temperature) phase diagrams up to $S=2$ directly in the\nthermodynamic limit thanks to infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS),\na tensor network numerical tool. We find incompressible phases characterized by\na magnetization plateau vs field and stabilized by spontaneous breaking of\npoint group or lattice translation symmetry(ies). The nature of such phases may\nbe semi-classical, as the plateaus at $\\frac{1}{3}$th, $(1-\\frac{2}{9S})$th and\n$(1-\\frac{1}{9S})$th of the saturated magnetization (the latter followed by a\nmacroscopic magnetization jump), or fully quantum as the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\frac{1}{9}$-plateau exhibiting coexistence of charge and bond orders. Upon\nrestoration of the spin rotation $U(1)$ symmetry a finite compressibility\nappears, although lattice symmetry breaking persists. For integer spin values\nwe also identify spin gapped phases at low enough field, such as the $S=2$\n(topologically trivial) spin liquid with no symmetry breaking, neither spin nor\nlattice.\n", "  Polariton polarization can be described in terms of a pseudospin which can be\noriented along the $x,\\,y,$ or $z$ axis, similarly to electron and hole spin.\nUnlike electrons and holes where time-reversal symmetry requires that the\nspin-orbit interaction be odd in the momentum, the analogue of the spin-orbit\ninteraction for polaritons, the so-called TE-TM splitting, is even in the\nmomentum. We calculate and compare spin transport of polariton, electron, and\nhole systems, in the diffusive regime of many scatterings. After dimensional\nrescaling diffusive systems with spatially uniform particle densities have\nidentical dynamics, regardless of the particle type. Differences between the\nthree particles appear in spatially non-uniform systems, with pumps at a\nspecific localized point. We consider both oscillating pumps and transient\n(delta-function) pumps. In such systems each particle type produces distinctive\nspin patterns. The particles can be distinguished by their differing spatial\nmultipole character, their response and resonances in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield, and their relative magnitude which is largest for electrons and weakest\nfor holes. These patterns are manifested both in response to unpolarized pumps\nwhich produce in-plane and perpendicular spin signals, and to polarized pumps\nwhere the spin precesses from in-plane to out-of-plane and vice versa. These\nresults will be useful for designing systems with large spin polarization\nsignals, for identifying the dominant spin-orbit interaction and measuring\nsubdominant terms in experimental devices, and for measuring the scattering\ntime and the spin-orbit coupling's magnitude.\n", "  Using extended mean field theory (EMFT) on the lattice, we study properties\nof the Higgs-Yukawa model as an approximation of the standard model Higgs\nsector, and the effect of higher dimension operators. We note that the\ndiscussion of vacuum stability is completely modified in the presence of a\n$\\phi^6$ term, and that the Higgs mass no longer appears fine tuned. We also\nstudy the finite temperature transition. Without higher dimension operators the\ntransition is found to be second order (crossover with gauge fields) for the\nexperimental value of the Higgs mass $M_h=125$ GeV. By taking a $\\phi^6$\ninteraction in the Higgs potential as a proxy for a UV completion of the\nstandard model, the transition becomes stronger and turns first order if the\nscale of new physics, i.e. the mass of the lightest mediator particle, is\naround $1.5$ TeV. This implies that electroweak baryogenesis may be viable in\nmodels which introduce new particles around that scale.\n", "  Using cosmological simulations, we address the interplay between structure\nand star formation in high-redshift galaxies via the evolution of surface\ndensity profiles. Our sample consists of 26 galaxies evolving in the redshift\nrange $z=7-1$, spanning the stellar mass range $(0.2-6.4)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$\nat $z=2$. We recover the main trends by stacking the profiles in accordance to\ntheir evolution phases. Following a wet compaction event that typically occurs\nwhen the stellar mass is $\\sim10^{9.5}~M_{\\odot}$ at $z\\sim2-4$, the gas\ndevelops a cusp inside the effective radius, associated with a peak in\nstar-formation rate (SFR). The SFR peak and the associated feedback, in the\nabsence of further gas inflow to the centre, marks the onset of gas depletion\nfrom the central 1 kpc, leading to quenching of the central SFR. An extended,\nstar-forming ring that forms by fresh gas during the central quenching process\nshows as a rising specific SFR (sSFR) profile, which is interpreted as\ninside-out quenching. Before quenching, the stellar density profile grows\nself-similarly, maintaining its log-log shape because the sSFR is similar at\nall radii. During the quenching process, the stellar density saturates to a\nconstant value, especially in the inner 1 kpc. The stellar mass and SFR\nprofiles deduced from observations show very similar shapes, consistent with\nthe scenario of wet compaction leading to inside-out quenching and the\nsubsequent saturation of a dense stellar core. We predict a cuspy gas profile\nduring the blue nugget phase, and a gas-depleted core, sometimes surrounded by\na ring, in the post-blue nugget phase.\n", "  In contrast to bulk FeSe superconductor, heavily electron-doped FeSe-derived\nsuperconductors show relatively high Tc without hole Fermi surfaces and nodal\nsuperconducting gap structure, which pose great challenges on pairing theories\nin the iron-based superconductors. In the heavily electron-doped FeSe-based\nsuperconductors, the dominant factors and the exact working mechanism that is\nresponsible for the high Tc need to be clarified. In particular, a clean\ncontrol of carrier concentration remains to be a challenge for revealing how\nsuperconductivity and Fermi surface topology evolves with carrier concentration\nin bulk FeSe. Here, we report the evolution of superconductivity in the FeSe\nthin flake with systematically regulated carrier concentrations by\nliquid-gating technique. High-temperature superconductivity at 48 K can be\nachieved only with electron doping tuned by gate voltage in FeSe thin flake\nwith Tc less than 10 K. This is the first time to achieve such a high\ntemperature superconductivity in FeSe without either epitaxial interface or\nexternal pressure. It definitely proves that the simple electron-doping process\nis able to induce high-temperature superconductivity with Tc as high as 48 K in\nbulk FeSe. Intriguingly, our data also indicates that the superconductivity is\nsuddenly changed from low-Tc phase to high-Tc phase with a Lifshitz transition\nat certain carrier concentration. These results help us to build a unified\npicture to understand the high-temperature superconductivity among all\nFeSe-derived superconductors and shed light on further pursuit of higher Tc in\nthese materials.\n", "  A detailed analysis to find a missing $\\psi(4S)$ is made by utilizing the\nrecent precise mesurements of the cross section for the process $e^+e^-\\to\n\\psi(2S)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ by Belle. Assuming three resonances $Y(4360)$, $Y(4660)$,\nand $\\psi(4S)$ to fit the data, we obtain the resonance parameters for\n$\\psi(4S)$ as $m=4243$ MeV and $\\Gamma=16 \\pm 31$ MeV showing a narrow state as\npredicted before. A combined fit to the data $e^+ e^- \\to \\psi(2S) \\pi^+ \\pi^-,\n\\ h_c \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, and $\\chi_{c0} \\omega$ is also performed to obtain the\nsimilar resonance parameters of $\\psi(4S)$. The upper limit of the branching\nratio is fitted to be $\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(4S)\\to\\psi(2S)\\pi^+\\pi^-) < 3\\times\n10^{-3}$, which can be understood by hadronic loop contributions in reasonable\nparameters range. In addition, the ratios of the branching ratios of the\n$\\psi(4S)$ dipion transition to the one of $\\psi(4S)\\to\\chi_{c0}\\omega$ are\nfitted, which can be further measured by BESIII and forthcoming BelleII to\nconfirm the existence of $\\psi(4S)$.\n", "  Phonons are essential for understanding the thermal properties in monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, which limit their thermal performance for\npotential applications. We investigate the lattice dynamics and thermodynamic\nproperties of MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 by first principles calculations. The\nobtained phonon frequencies and thermal conductivities agree well with the\nmeasurements. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of MoS2 is highest\namong the three materials due to its much lower average atomic mass. We also\ndiscuss the competition between mass effect, interatomic bonding and anharmonic\nvibrations in determining the thermal conductivity of WS2. Strong covalent W-S\nbonding and low anharmonicity in WS2 are found to be crucial in understanding\nits much higher thermal conductivity compared to MoSe2.\n", "  II-VI and III-V tetrahedral semiconductors have significant potential for\nnovel optoelectronic applications. In the present work, some of the optical and\nelectronic properties of these groups of semiconductors have been studied using\na recently proposed empirical relationship for refractive index from energy\ngap. The calculated values of these properties are also compared with those\ncalculated from some well known relationships. From an analysis of the\ncalculated electronic polarisability of these tetrahedral binary semiconductors\nfrom different formulations, we have proposed an empirical relation for its\ncalculation. The predicted values of electronic polarisability of these\nsemiconductors agree fairly well with the known values over a wide range of\nenergy gap.\n", "  We propose a possibility that the inflaton potential is significantly\nmodified after inflation due to heavy field dynamics. During inflation there\nmay be a heavy scalar field stabilized at a value deviated from the low-energy\nminimum. As the heavy field moves to the low-energy minimum, the inflaton\npotential could be significantly modified. In extreme cases, the inflaton\npotential vanishes and the inflaton becomes almost massless at some time after\ninflation. Such transition of the inflaton potential has interesting\nimplications for primordial density perturbations, reheating, creation of\nunwanted relics, dark radiation, and experimental search for light degrees of\nfreedom. To be concrete, we consider a chaotic inflation in supergravity where\nthe inflaton mass parameter is promoted to a modulus field, finding that the\ninflaton becomes stable after the transition and contributes to dark matter.\nAnother example is the new inflation by the MSSM Higgs field which acquires a\nlarge expectation value just after inflation, but it returns to the origin\nafter the transition and settles down at the electroweak vacuum. Interestingly,\nthe smallness of the electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale is directly\nrelated to the flatness of the inflaton potential.\n", "  We prove the occurrence of a phase transition accompanied by the emergence of\ncycles of diverging lengths in the random interchange process on the hypercube.\n", "  We investigate the superfluid behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate of\n$^6$Li molecules. In the experiment by Weimer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,\n095301 (2015) a condensate is stirred by a weak, red-detuned laser beam along a\ncircular path around the trap center. The rate of induced heating increases\nsteeply above a velocity $v_c$, which we define as the critical velocity. Below\nthis velocity, the moving beam creates almost no heating. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate a quantitative understanding of the critical velocity. Using both\nnumerical and analytical methods, we identify the non-zero temperature, the\ncircular motion of the stirrer, and the density profile of the cloud as key\nfactors influencing the magnitude of $v_c$. A direct comparison to the\nexperimental data shows excellent agreement.\n", "  Even though ion/atom-collision is a mature field of atomic physics great\ndiscrepancies between experiment and theoretical calculations are still common.\nHere we present experimental results with highest momentum resolution on single\nionization of helium induced by 1\\,MeV protons and compare these to different\ntheoretical calculations. The overall agreement is strikingly good and already\nthe first Born approximation yields good agreement between theory and\nexperiment. This has been expected since several decades, but so far has not\nbeen accomplished. The influence of projectile coherence effects on the\nmeasured data is shortly discussed in line with an ongoing dispute on the\nexistence of nodal structures in the electron angular emission distributions.\n", "  Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of\nstar-formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution\nof galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible\nreplenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in\nthe upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short\ndepletion times (\"blue nuggets\"), while the lower-SFR galaxies in the lower\nenvelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions and longer\ndepletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS.\nStellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS\nridge on timescales $\\sim0.4~t_{\\mathrm{Hubble}}$ ($\\sim1$ Gyr at $z\\sim3$).\nThe propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers,\ncounter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at\nthe upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and\noutflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at\nthe lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by\nfresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the\nreplenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas\ncompaction, depletion and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow\n($\\pm0.3$ dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes\n($M_{\\mathrm{vir}}>10^{11.5}~M_\\odot$) and/or at low redshifts ($z<3$), where\nthe replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the\nobserved bending down of the MS at the massive end.\n", "  Vacuum polarization of charged massless fermions is investigated in the\nsuperposition of Coulomb and Aharonov--Bohm (AB) potentials in 2+1 dimensions.\nFor this purpose we construct the Green function of the two-dimensional Dirac\nequation with Coulomb and AB potentials (via the regular and irregular\nsolutions of the radial Dirac equation) and calculate the vacuum polarization\ncharge density in these fields in the so-called subcritical and supercritical\nregimes.\n  The role of the self-adjoint extension parameter is discussed in terms of the\nphysics of problem. We hope that our results will be helpful in the more deep\nunderstanding the fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and can be\napplied to the problems of charged impurity screening in graphene with taking\ninto consideration the electron spin.\n", "  While it is often stated that the notion of electroweak (EW) naturalness in\nsupersymmetric models is subjective, fuzzy and model-dependent, here we argue\nthe contrary: electroweak naturalness can be elevated to a {\\it principle}\nwhich is both objective and predictive. We demonstrate visually when too much\nfine-tuning sets in at the electroweak scale which corresponds numerically to\nthe measure \\Delta_{BG}~\\Delta_{EW}> 30. While many constrained SUSY models are\nalready excluded by this value, we derive updated upper bounds on sparticle\nmasses within the two-extra parameter non-universal Higgs model (NUHM2). We\nconfirm the classic Barbieri-Giudice (BG) result that \\Delta_{BG}<30 implies mu\n<350 GeV. However, by combining dependent soft terms which appear as multiples\nof m_{3/2} in supergravity models, then we obtain m(gluino)< 4 TeV as opposed\nto the BG result that m(gluino)<350 GeV. We compare the NUHM2 results to a\nsimilar scan in the pMSSM with 19 weak scale parameters. In the pMSSM with\ncomplete one-loop scalar potential plus dominant two-loop terms, then a\nm(gluino)<7 TeV bound is found. Our tabulation of upper bounds provides a\ntarget for experimenters seeking to discover or else falsify the existence of\nweak scale supersymmetry. In an Appendix, we show contributions to the\nnaturalness measure from one-loop contributions to the weak scale scalar\npotential.\n", "  Two electronic channels competing to screen a single impurity spin, as in the\ntwo-channel Kondo model, are expected to generate a ground state with\nnontrivial entanglement structure. We exploit a spin-chain representation of\nthe two-channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy,\nnegativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization\ngroup approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels we\nconfirm field-theory predictions for the boundary entropy difference, $\\ln\n(g_{UV}/g_{IR})=\\ln(2)/2$, between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the\nleading $\\ln(x)/x$ impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity\nentanglement, $S_{\\text{imp}}$, is shown to scale with the characteristic\nlength $\\xi_{2CK}$. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of\nthe impurity with one of the channels $-$ as measured by the negativity$-$\nfaithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition\nappearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit\ndetermination of critical exponents, $\\nu\\!\\approx\\! 2$ and $\\beta \\!\\approx\\!\n0.2$. Remarkably, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement only in the\nvicinity of the critical channel-symmetric point.\n", "  Using the Stochastic Adhesion Model (SAM) as a simple toy model for cosmic\nstructure formation, we study renormalization and the removal of the cutoff\ndependence from loop integrals in perturbative calculations. SAM shares the\nsame symmetry with the full system of continuity+Euler equations and includes a\nviscosity term and a stochastic noise term, similar to the effective theories\nrecently put forward to model CDM clustering. We show in this context that if\nthe viscosity and noise terms are treated as perturbative corrections to the\nstandard eulerian perturbation theory, they are necessarily non-local in time.\nTo ensure Galilean Invariance higher order vertices related to the viscosity\nand the noise must then be added and we explicitly show at one-loop that these\nterms act as counter terms for vertex diagrams. The Ward Identities ensure that\nthe non-local-in-time theory can be renormalized consistently. Another\npossibility is to include the viscosity in the linear propagator, resulting in\nexponential damping at high wavenumber. The resulting local-in-time theory is\nthen renormalizable to one loop, requiring less free parameters for its\nrenormalization.\n", "  We demonstrate that there is an optimal forcing length scale for low Prandtl\nnumber dynamo flows, that can significantly reduce the required energy\ninjection rate. The investigation is based on simulations of the induction\nequation in a periodic box of size $2\\pi L$. The flows considered are turbulent\nABC flows forced at different forcing wavenumbers $k_f$ simulated using a\nsubgrid turbulent model. The critical magnetic Reynolds number $Rm_c^T$\ndecreases as the forcing wavenumber $k_f$ increases from the smallest allowed\n$k_{min}=1/L$. At large $k_f$ on the other hand, $Rm_c^T$ increases with the\nforcing wavenumber as $Rm_c^T \\propto \\sqrt{ k_f}$ in agreement with mean-field\nscaling prediction. At $k_f L\\simeq 4$ an optimal wavenumber is reached where\n$Rm_c^T$ obtains its minimum value. At this optimal wavenumber $Rm_c^T$ is\nsmaller by more than a factor of ten than the case forced in $k_f=1$. This\nleads to a reduction of the energy injection rate by three orders of magnitude\nwhen compared to the case that the system is forced in the largest scales and\nthus provides a new strategy for the design of a fully turbulent experimental\ndynamo.\n", "  Future particle accelerators such as the the SLAC ``Linac Coherent Light\nSource-II'' (LCLS-II) and the proposed Cornell Energy Recovery Linac (ERL)\nrequire hundreds of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities operating in\ncontinuous wave (CW) mode. In order to achieve economic feasibility of projects\nsuch as these, the cavities must achieve a very high intrinsic quality factor\n($Q_0$) to keep cryogenic losses within feasible limits. To reach these high\n$Q_0$'s in the case of LCLS-II, nitrogen-doping has been proposed as a cavity\npreparation technique. When dealing with $Q_0$'s greater than 1\\e{10}, the\neffects of ambient magnetic field on $Q_0$ become significant. Here we show\nthat the sensitivity to RF losses from trapped magnetic field in a cavity's\nwalls is strongly dependent on the cavity preparation. Specifically, standard\nelectropolished and 120$^\\circ$C baked cavities show a residual resistance\nsensitivity to trapped magnetic flux of $\\sim0.6$ and $\\sim0.8$ n$\\Omega$/mG\ntrapped, respectively, while nitrogen-doped cavities show a sensitivity of\n$\\sim$ 1 to 5 n$\\Omega$/mG trapped. We show that this difference in\nsensitivities is directly related to the mean free path of the RF surface layer\nof the niobium: shorter mean free paths lead to less residual resistance\nsensitivity to trapped magnetic flux in the dirty limit ($\\ell<<\\xi_0$) while\nlonger mean free paths lead to lower sensitivity in the clean limit\n($\\ell>>\\xi_0$). These experimental results are also shown to have good\nagreement with recent theoretical predictions for pinned vortex lines\noscillating in RF fields.\n", "  We report the detection of extended Ly alpha emission around individual\nstar-forming galaxies at redshifts z = 3-6 in an ultradeep exposure of the\nHubble Deep Field South obtained with MUSE on the ESO-VLT. The data reach a\nlimiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 in\nazimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement over\nprevious narrowband imaging. Our sample consists of 26 spectroscopically\nconfirmed Ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_AB >~ 27) galaxies.\nIn most objects the Ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the UV\ncontinuum light. While 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show no\nsignificantly detected Ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest that\nthis is just due to insufficient S/N. Ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be\n(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 M_sun) star-forming galaxies\nat z>3. We decompose the Ly alpha emission of each object into a compact\n`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes and\nluminosities of the haloes. The extended Ly alpha emission approximately\nfollows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of a\nfew kpc. While these haloes are thus quite modest in terms of their absolute\nsizes, they are larger by a factor of 5-15 than the corresponding rest-frame UV\ncontinuum sources as seen by HST. They are also much more extended, by a factor\n~5, than Ly alpha haloes around low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Between\n~40% and >90% of the observed Ly alpha flux comes from the extended halo\ncomponent, with no obvious correlation of this fraction with either the\nabsolute or the relative size of the Ly alpha halo. Our observations provide\ndirect insights into the spatial distribution of at least partly neutral gas\nresiding in the circumgalactic medium of low to intermediate mass galaxies at z\n> 3.\n", "  We perform micromagnetic simulations of the magnetization distribution in\ninverse opal-like structures (IOLS) made from ferromagnetic materials (nickel\nand cobalt). It is shown that the unit cell of these complex structures, whose\ncharacteristic length is approximately 700 nm, can be divided into a set of\nstructural elements some of which behave like Ising-like objects. A spin-ice\nbehavior of IOLS is observed in a broad range of external magnetic fields.\nNumerical results describe successfully the experimental hysteresis curves of\nthe magnetization in Ni- and Co-based IOLS. We conclude that ferromagnetic IOLS\ncan be considered as the first realization of three-dimensional artificial spin\nice.\n", "  Self-organization and pattern formation in network-organized systems emerges\nfrom the collective activation and interaction of many interconnected units. A\nstriking feature of these non-equilibrium structures is that they are often\nlocalized and robust: only a small subset of the nodes, or cell assembly, is\nactivated. Understanding the role of cell assemblies as basic functional units\nin neural networks and socio-technical systems emerges as a fundamental\nchallenge in network theory. A key open question is how these elementary\nbuilding blocks emerge, and how they operate, linking structure and function in\ncomplex networks. Here we show that a network analogue of the Swift-Hohenberg\ncontinuum model---a minimal-ingredients model of nodal activation and\ninteraction within a complex network---is able to produce a complex suite of\nlocalized patterns. Hence, the spontaneous formation of robust operational cell\nassemblies in complex networks can be explained as the result of\nself-organization, even in the absence of synaptic reinforcements. Our results\nshow that these self-organized, local structures can provide robust functional\nunits to understand natural and socio-technical network-organized processes.\n", "  Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses, generated by a process known as\nlaser-induced electron recollision, are a key ingredient for attosecond\nmetrology, providing a tool to precisely initiate and probe sub-femtosecond\ndynamics in the microcosms of atoms, molecules and solids[1]. However, with the\ncurrent technology, extending attosecond metrology to scrutinize the dynamics\nof the inner-shell electrons is a challenge, that is because of the lower\nefficiency in generating the required soft x-ray \\hbar\\omega>300 eV attosecond\nbursts and the lower absorption cross-sections in this spectral range. A way\naround this problem is to use the recolliding electron to directly initiate the\ndesired inner-shell process, instead of using the currently low flux x-ray\nattosecond sources.Such an excitation process occurs in a sub-femtosecond\ntimescale, and may provide the necessary \"pump\" step in a pump-probe\nexperiment[2]. Here we used a few cycle infrared \\lambda_{0}~1800nm source[3]\nand observed direct evidences for inner-shell excitations through the\nlaser-induced electron recollision process. It is the first step toward\ntime-resolved core-hole studies in the keV energy range with sub-femtosecond\ntime resolution.\n", "  We propose a scheme for continuous detection of itinerant microwave photons\nin circuit quantum electrodynamics. In the proposed device, a superconducting\nqubit is coupled dispersively to two resonators: one is used to form an\nimpedance-matched $\\Lambda$ system that deterministically captures incoming\nphotons, and the other is used for continuous monitoring of the event. The\npresent scheme enables efficient photon detection: for realistic system\nparameters, the detection efficiency reaches 0.9 with a bandwidth of about ten\nmegahertz.\n", "  Polymorphism offers rich and virtually unexplored space for discovering novel\nfunctional materials. To harness this potential approaches capable of both\nexploring the space of polymorphs and assessing their realizability are needed.\nOne such approach devised for partially ionic solids is presented. The\nstructure prediction part is carried out by performing local DFT relaxations on\na large set of random supperlattices (RSLs) with atoms distributed randomly\nover different planes in a way that favors cation-anion coordination. Applying\nthe RSL sampling on MgO, ZnO and SnO2 reveals that the resulting probability of\noccurrence of a given structure offers a measure of its realizability\nexplaining fully the experimentally observed, metastable polymorphs in these\nthree systems.\n", "  A new class of multilayered functional materials has recently emerged in\nwhich the component atomic layers are held together by weak van der Waals\nforces that preserve the structural integrity and physical properties of each\nlayer. An exemplar of such a structure is a transistor device in which\nrelativistic Dirac Fermions can resonantly tunnel through a boron nitride\nbarrier, a few atomic layers thick, sandwiched between two graphene electrodes.\nAn applied magnetic field quantises graphene's gapless conduction and valence\nband states into discrete Landau levels, allowing us to resolve individual\ninter-Landau level transitions and thereby demonstrate that the energy,\nmomentum and chiral properties of the electrons are conserved in the tunnelling\nprocess. We also demonstrate that the change in the semiclassical cyclotron\ntrajectories, following a tunnelling event, is a form of Klein tunnelling for\ninter-layer transitions.\n", "  We introduce a model-independent approach to the null test of the cosmic\ncurvature which is geometrically related to the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and\nluminosity distance $d_L(z)$. Combining the independent observations of $H(z)$\nand $d_L(z)$, we use the model-independent smoothing technique, Gaussian\nprocesses, to reconstruct them and determine the cosmic curvature\n$\\Omega_K^{(0)}$ in the null test relation. The null test is totally\ngeometrical and without assuming any cosmological model. We show that the\ncosmic curvature $\\Omega_K^{(0)}=0$ is consistent with current observational\ndata sets, falling within the $1\\sigma$ limit. To demonstrate the effect on the\nprecision of the null test, we produce a series of simulated data of the models\nwith different $\\Omega_K^{(0)}$. Future observations in better quality can\nprovide a greater improvement to constrain or refute the flat universe with\n$\\Omega_K^{(0)}=0$.\n", "  It is shown that the basic observed properties of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nare accounted for if one assumes that the GRBs arise by blueshifting the\nemission radiation of hydrogen and helium generated during the last scattering\nepoch. The blueshift generator for a single GRB is a region with a nonconstant\nbang-time function $t_B(r)$ (described by a Lema\\^{\\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T)\nexact solution of Einstein's equations) matched into a homogeneous and\nisotropic (Friedmann) background. Blueshift visible to the present observer\narises \\textit{only on those rays that are emitted radially in an L--T region}.\nThe paper presents three L--T models with different Big Bang profiles, adapted\nfor the highest and the lowest end of the GRB frequency range. The models\naccount for: (1) The observed frequency range of the GRBs; (2) Their limited\nduration; (3) The afterglows; (4) Their hypothetical collimation into narrow\njets; (5) The large distances to their sources; (6) The multitude of the\nobserved GRBs. Properties (2), (3) and (6) are accounted for only\nqualitatively. With a small correction of the parameters of the model, the\nimplied perturbations of the CMB radiation will be consistent with those\nactually caused by the GRBs. A complete model of the Universe would consist of\nmany L--T regions with different $t_B(r)$ profiles, matched into the same\nFriedmann background. This paper is meant to be an initial exploration of the\npossibilities offered by models of this kind; the actual fitting of all\nparameters to observational results requires fine-tuning of several\ninterconnected variables and is left for a separate study.\n", "  We develop analytic and numerical models of the properties of super-Eddington\nstellar winds, motivated by phases in stellar evolution when super-Eddington\nenergy deposition (via, e.g., unstable fusion, wave heating, or a binary\ncompanion) heats a region near the stellar surface. This appears to occur in\nluminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical\nnovae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds\nEddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not\nplay a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties\ndepend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot\nG)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the\nheating region vesc(r_h). For vc > vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large\nradii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc < vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind\nthe wind material and thus Edot_w < Edot. Multidimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations without radiation diffusion using FLASH and one-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations with radiation diffusion using MESA are in good\nagreement with the analytic predictions. The photon luminosity from the wind is\nitself super-Eddington but in many cases the photon luminosity is likely\ndominated by `internal shocks' in the wind. We discuss the application of our\nmodels to eruptive mass loss from massive stars and argue that the wind models\ndescribed here can account for the broad properties of LBV outflows and the\nenhanced mass loss in the years prior to Type IIn core-collapse supernovae.\n", "  We report on the highest precision yet achieved in the measurement of the\npolarization of a low energy, $\\mathcal{O}$(1 GeV), electron beam, accomplished\nusing a new polarimeter based on electron-photon scattering, in Hall~C at\nJefferson Lab. A number of technical innovations were necessary, including a\nnovel method for precise control of the laser polarization in a cavity and a\nnovel diamond micro-strip detector which was able to capture most of the\nspectrum of scattered electrons. The data analysis technique exploited track\nfinding, the high granularity of the detector and its large acceptance. The\npolarization of the $180~\\mu$A, $1.16$~GeV electron beam was measured with a\nstatistical precision of $<$~1\\% per hour and a systematic uncertainty of\n0.59\\%. This exceeds the level of precision required by the \\qweak experiment,\na measurement of the vector weak charge of the proton. Proposed future\nlow-energy experiments require polarization uncertainty $<$~0.4\\%, and this\nresult represents an important demonstration of that possibility. This\nmeasurement is also the first use of diamond detectors for particle tracking in\nan experiment.\n", "  We study scalar field configurations around Kerr black holes with a\ntime-independent energy-momentum tensor. These stationary `scalar clouds',\nconfined near the black hole (BH) by their own mass or a mirror at fixed\nradius, exist at the threshold for energy extraction via superradiance.\nMotivated by the electromagnetic Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, we explore\nwhether scalar clouds could serve as a proxy for the force-free magnetosphere\nin the BZ process. We find that a stationary energy-extracting scalar cloud\nsolution exists when the reflecting mirror is replaced by a semi-permeable\nsurface which allows the cloud to radiate some energy to infinity while\nmaintaining self-sustained superradiance. The radial energy flux displays the\nsame behaviour for rapidly rotating holes as magnetohydrodynamic simulations\npredict for the BZ mechanism.\n", "  Measurements of midrapidity charged particle multiplicity distributions,\n$dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta$, and midrapidity transverse-energy distributions,\n$dE_T/d\\eta$, are presented for a variety of collision systems and energies.\nIncluded are distributions for Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$,\n130, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, 14.5, and 7.7 GeV, Cu$+$Cu collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ and 62.4 GeV, Cu$+$Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, U$+$U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=193$ GeV,\n$d$$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV, and $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$\nGeV. Centrality-dependent distributions at midrapidity are presented in terms\nof the number of nucleon participants, $N_{\\rm part}$, and the number of\nconstituent quark participants, $N_{q{\\rm p}}$. For all $A$$+$$A$ collisions\ndown to $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=7.7$ GeV, it is observed that the midrapidity data\nare better described by scaling with $N_{q{\\rm p}}$ than scaling with $N_{\\rm\npart}$. Also presented are estimates of the Bjorken energy density,\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm BJ}$, and the ratio of $dE_T/d\\eta$ to $dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta$,\nthe latter of which is seen to be constant as a function of centrality for all\nsystems.\n", "  We study the effect of temperature (T) and baryon density ({\\mu}) dependent\nhadron masses on the thermodynamics of hadronic matter. We use linear scaling\nrule in terms of constituent quark masses for all hadrons except for light\nmesons. T and {\\mu} dependent constituent quark masses and the light mesons\nmasses are computed using 2+1 flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We compute\nthe thermodynamical quantities of hadronic matter within excluded volume hadron\nresonance gas model (EHRG) with these T and {\\mu} dependent hadron masses. We\nconfront the thermodynamical quantities with the lattice quantum chromodynamics\n(LQCD) at {\\mu} = 0 GeV. Further, we comment on the effect of T and {\\mu}\ndependent hadron masses on the transport properties near the transition\ntemperature.\n", "  We consider the superpotential formalism to describe the evolution of scalar\nfields during inflation, generalizing it to include the case with non-canonical\nkinetic terms. We provide a characterization of the attractor behaviour of the\nbackground evolution in terms of first and second slow-roll parameters (which\nneed not be small). We find that the superpotential is useful in justifying the\nseparate universe approximation from the gradient expansion, and also in\ncomputing the spectra of primordial perturbations around attractor solutions in\nthe $\\delta N$ formalism. As an application, we consider a class of models\nwhere the background trajectories for the inflaton fields are derived from a\nproduct separable superpotential. In the perspective of the holographic\ninflation scenario, such models are dual to a deformed CFT boundary theory,\nwith $D$ mutually uncorrelated deformation operators. We compute the bulk power\nspectra of primordial adiabatic and entropy cosmological perturbations, and\nshow that the results agree with the ones obtained by using conformal\nperturbation theory in the dual picture.\n", "  We consider a family of percolation models in which geometry and connectivity\nare defined by two independent random processes. Such models merge\ncharacteristics of discrete and continuous percolation. We develop an algorithm\nallowing effective computation of both universal and modelspecific percolation\nquantities in the case when both random processes are Poisson processes. The\nalgorithm extends percolation algorithm by Newman and Ziff (M.E.J. Newman and\nR.M. Ziff, Phys Rev E, 64(1):016706, 2001) to handle inhomogeneous lattices. In\nparticular, we use the proposed method to compute critical exponents and\ncluster density distribution in two and three dimensions for the model of\nparallel random tubes connected randomly by bonds, which models the\nconnectivity properties of activated carbon.\n", "  ${\\textbf{Background:}}$ Atomic nuclei often exhibit collective\nrotational-like behavior in highly excited states, well above the particle\nemission threshold. What determines the existence of collective motion in the\ncontinuum region, is not fully understood.\n  ${\\textbf{Purpose:}}$ In this work, by studying the collective rotation of\nthe positive-parity deformed configurations of the one-neutron halo nucleus\n$^{11}$Be, we assess different mechanisms that stabilize collective behavior\nbeyond the limits of particle stability.\n  ${\\textbf{Method:}}$ To solve a particle-plus-core problem, we employ a\nnon-adiabatic coupled-channel formalism and the Berggren single-particle\nensemble, which explicitly contains bound states, narrow resonances, and the\nscattering continuum. We study the valence-neutron density in the intrinsic\nrotor frame to assess the validity of the adiabatic approach as the excitation\nenergy increases.\n  ${\\textbf{Results:}}$ We demonstrate that collective rotation of the ground\nband of $^{11}$Be is stabilized by (i) the fact that the $\\ell=0$ one-neutron\ndecay channel is closed, and (ii) the angular momentum alignment, which\nincreases the parentage of high-$\\ell$ components at high spins; both effects\nact in concert to decrease decay widths of ground-state band members. This is\nnot the case for higher-lying states of $^{11}$Be, where the $\\ell=0$\nneutron-decay channel is open and often dominates.\n  ${\\textbf{Conclusion:}}$ We demonstrate that long-lived collective states can\nexist at high excitation energy in weakly bound neutron drip-line nuclei such\nas $^{11}$Be.\n", "  Cosmic string loops contain cusps which decay by emitting bursts of\nparticles. A significant fraction of the released energy is in the form of\nphotons. These photons are injected non-thermally and can hence cause spectral\ndistortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Under the assumption that\ncusps are robust against gravitational back-reaction, we compute the fractional\nenergy density released as photons in the redshift interval where such\nnon-thermal photon injection causes CMB spectral distortions. Whereas current\nconstraints on such spectral distortions are not strong enough to constrain the\nstring tension, future missions such as the PIXIE experiment will be able to\nprovide limits which rule out a range of string tensions between $G \\mu \\sim\n10^{-15}$ and $G \\mu \\sim 10^{-12}$, thus ruling out particle physics models\nyielding these kind of intermediate-scale cosmic strings.\n", "  We consider the optimization of Markovian dynamics to pursue the fastest\nconvergence to the stationary state. The brachistochrone method is applied to\nthe continuous-time master equation for finite-size systems. The principle of\nleast action leads to a brachistochrone equation for the transition-rate\nmatrix. Three-state systems are explicitly analyzed, and we find that the\nsolution violates the detailed balance condition. The properties of the\nsolution are studied in detail to observe the optimality of the solution. We\nalso discuss the counterdiabatic driving for the Markovian dynamics. The\ntransition-rate matrix is then divided into two parts, and the state is given\nby an eigenstate of the first part. The second part violates the detailed\nbalance condition and plays the role of a counterdiabatic term.\n", "  We consider quantum quenches from an ideal Bose condensate to the\nLieb-Liniger model with arbitrary attractive interaction strength. We focus on\nthe properties of the non-equilibrium steady state reached at late times after\nthe quench. Using recently developed methods based on integrability, we obtain\nan exact description of the stationary state for a large number of bosons. A\ndistinctive feature of this state is the presence of a hierarchy of\nmulti-particle bound states. We determine the dependence of their densities on\ninteraction strength and obtain an exact expression for the stationary value of\nthe local pair correlation $g_2$. We discuss ramifications of our results for\ncold atom experiments.\n", "  An observational review is provided of the properties of accretion disks\naround young stars. It concerns the primordial disks of intermediate- and\nhigh-mass young stellar objects in embedded and optically revealed phases. The\nproperties were derived from spatially resolved observations and therefore\npredominantly obtained with interferometric means, either in the\nradio/(sub)millimeter or in the optical/infrared wavelength regions. We make\nsummaries and comparisons of the physical properties, kinematics, and dynamics\nof these circumstellar structures and delineate trends where possible. Amongst\nothers, we report on a quadratic trend of mass accretion rates with mass from T\nTauri stars to the highest mass young stellar objects and on the systematic\ndifference in mass infall and accretion rates.\n", "  We present a study of the fully relativistic spherical collapse in presence\nof quintessence using on Numerical Relativity, following the method proposed by\nthe authors in a previous article [arXiv:1409.3476]. We ascertain the validity\nof the method by studying the evolution of a spherically symmetric quintessence\ninhomogeneity on a de Sitter background and we find that it has an impact on\nthe local expansion around the centre of coordinates. We then proceed to\ncompare the results of our method to those of the more largely adopted top-hat\nmodel. We find that quintessence inhomogeneities do build up under the effect\nthat matter inhomogeneities have on the local space-time yet remain very small\ndue to the presence of momentum transfer from the over-dense to the background\nregions. We expect that these might have an even more important role in\nmodified theories of gravitation.\n", "  A city is not a tree but a semi-lattice. To use a perhaps more familiar term,\na city is a complex network. The complex network constitutes a unique\ntopological perspective on cities and enables us to better understand the kind\nof problem a city is. The topological perspective differentiates it from the\nperspectives of Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics that deal with\nessentially regular shapes and more or less similar things. Many urban\ntheories, such as the Central Place Theory, Zipf's Law, the Image of the City,\nand the Theory of Centers can be interpreted from the point of view of complex\nnetworks. A livable city consists of far more small things than large ones, and\ntheir shapes tend to be irregular and rough. This chapter illustrates the\ncomplex network view and argues that we must abandon the kind of thinking\n(mis-)guided by Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics, and instead adopt\nfractal geometry, power-law statistics, and Alexander's living geometry to\ndevelop sustainable cities.\n  Keywords: Scaling, living structure, theory of centers, objective beauty,\nhead/tail breaks\n", "  Amongst standard model parameters that are constrained by cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) observations, the optical depth $\\tau$ stands out as a\nnuisance parameter. While $\\tau$ provides some crude limits on reionization, it\nalso degrades constraints on other cosmological parameters. Here we explore how\n21 cm cosmology---as a direct probe of reionization---can be used to\nindependently predict $\\tau$ in an effort to improve CMB parameter constraints.\nWe develop two complementary schemes for doing so. The first uses 21 cm power\nspectrum observations in conjunction with semi-analytic simulations to predict\n$\\tau$. The other uses global 21 cm measurements to directly constrain low\nredshift (post-reheating) contributions to $\\tau$ in a relatively\nmodel-independent way. Forecasting the performance of the upcoming Hydrogen\nEpoch of Reionization Array, we find that significant reductions in the errors\non $\\tau$ can be achieved. These results are particularly effective at breaking\nthe CMB degeneracy between $\\tau$ and the amplitude of the primordial\nfluctuation spectrum $A_s$, with errors on $\\ln (10^{10} A_s)$ reduced by up to\na factor of four. Stage 4 CMB constraints on the neutrino mass sum are also\nimproved, with errors potentially reduced to $12\\,\\textrm{meV}$ regardless of\nwhether CMB experiments can precisely measure the reionization bump in\npolarization power spectra. Observations of the 21 cm line are therefore\ncapable of improving not only our understanding of reionization astrophysics,\nbut also of cosmology in general.\n", "  We report the Coulomb mediated hybridization of excitonic states in an\noptically active, artificial quantum dot molecule. By probing the optical\nresponse of the artificial molecule as a function of the static electric field\napplied along the molecular axis, we observe unexpected avoided level crossings\nthat do not arise from the dominant single particle tunnel coupling. We\nidentify a new few-particle coupling mechanism stemming from Coulomb\ninteractions between different neutral exciton states. Such Coulomb resonances\nhybridize the exciton wave function over four different electron and hole\nsingle-particle orbitals. Comparisons of experimental observations with\nmicroscopic 8-band $k \\cdot p$ calculations taking into account a realistic\nquantum dot geometry show good agreement and reveal that the Coulomb resonances\narise from broken symmetry in the artificial molecule.\n", "  We present a fully automated framework based on the FeynRules and MadGraph5\naMC@NLO programs that allows for accurate simulations of supersymmetric QCD\nprocesses at the LHC. Starting directly from a model Lagrangian that features\nsquark and gluino interactions, event generation is achieved at the\nnext-to-leading order in QCD, matching short-distance events to parton showers\nand including the subsequent decay of the produced supersymmetric particles. As\nan application, we study the impact of higher-order corrections in gluino\npair-production in a simplified benchmark scenario inspired by current gluino\nLHC searches.\n", "  The black hole in the center of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, has the largest\nmass-to-distance ratio among all known black holes in the Universe. This\nproperty makes Sgr A* the optimal target for testing the gravitational no-hair\ntheorem. In the near future, major developments in instrumentation will provide\nthe tools for high-precision studies of its spacetime via observations of\nrelativistic effects in stellar orbits, in the timing of pulsars, and in\nhorizon-scale images of its accretion flow. We explore here the prospect of\nmeasuring the properties of the black-hole spacetime using all these three\ntypes of observations. We show that the correlated uncertainties in the\nmeasurements of the black-hole spin and quadrupole moment using the orbits of\nstars and pulsars are nearly orthogonal to those obtained from measuring the\nshape and size of the shadow the black hole casts on the surrounding emission.\nCombining these three types of observations will, therefore, allow us to assess\nand quantify systematic biases and uncertainties in each measurement and lead\nto a highly accurate, quantitative test of the gravitational no-hair theorem.\n", "  We use a complete and rigorous statistical indicator to measure the level of\nconcordance between cosmological data sets, without relying on the inspection\nof the marginal posterior distribution of some selected parameters. We apply\nthis test to state of the art cosmological data sets, to assess their agreement\nwithin the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We find that there is a good level of\nconcordance between all the experiments with one noticeable exception. There is\nsubstantial evidence of tension between the CMB, temperature and polarization,\nmeasurements of the Planck satellite and the data from the CFHTLenS weak\nlensing survey even when applying ultra conservative cuts. These results\nrobustly point toward the possibility of having unaccounted systematic effects\nin the data, an incomplete modelling of the cosmological predictions or hints\ntoward new physical phenomena.\n", "  In this work we investigate a model for the early Universe in a Bianchi\ntype-I metric, where the sources of the gravitational field are a fermionic and\na bosonic field, interacting through a Yukawa potential, following the standard\nmodel of elementary particles. It is shown that the fermionic field has a\nnegative pressure, while the boson has a small positive pressure. The fermionic\nfield is the responsible for an accelerated regime at early times, but since\nthe total pressure tends to zero for large times, a transition to a decelerated\nregime occurs. Here the Yukawa potential answers for the duration of the\naccelerated regime, since by decreasing the value of its coupling constant the\ntransition accelerated-decelerated occurs in later times. The isotropization\nwhich occurs for late times is due to the presence of the fermionic field as\none of the sources of the gravitational field.\n", "  It is known that the Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations can be observed in the\nHall resistivity, although their amplitude is much weaker than the amplitude of\nthe diagonal resistivity oscillations. Employing a model of two-dimensional\nmassive Dirac fermions that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, we demonstrate that\nthe amplitude of the Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations of the anomalous Hall\nconductivity is the same as that of the diagonal conductivity. We argue that\nthe oscillations of the anomalous Hall conductivity can be observed by studying\nthe valley Hall effect in graphene superlattices and the spin Hall effect in\nthe low-buckled Dirac materials.\n", "  We develop a general hydrodynamic framework for computing direct current\nthermal and electric transport in a strongly interacting finite temperature\nquantum system near a Lorentz-invariant quantum critical point. Our framework\nis non-perturbative in the strength of long wavelength fluctuations in the\nbackground charge density of the electronic fluid, and requires the rate of\nelectron-electron scattering to be faster than the rate of electron-impurity\nscattering. We use this formalism to compute transport coefficients in the\nDirac fluid in clean samples of graphene near the charge neutrality point, and\nfind results insensitive to long range Coulomb interactions. Numerical results\nare compared to recent experimental data on thermal and electrical conductivity\nin the Dirac fluid in graphene and substantially improved quantitative\nagreement over existing hydrodynamic theories is found. We comment on the\ninterplay between the Dirac fluid and acoustic and optical phonons, and\nqualitatively explain experimentally observed effects. Our work paves the way\nfor quantitative contact between experimentally realized condensed matter\nsystems and the wide body of high energy inspired theories on transport in\ninteracting many-body quantum systems.\n", "  AGT relations imply that the four-point conformal block admits a\ndecomposition into a sum over pairs of Young diagrams of essentially rational\nNekrasov functions - this is immediately seen when conformal block is\nrepresented in the form of a matrix model. However, the q-deformation of the\nsame block has a deeper decomposition - into a sum over a quadruple of Young\ndiagrams of a product of four topological vertices. We analyze the interplay\nbetween these two decompositions, their properties and their generalization to\nmulti-point conformal blocks. In the latter case we explain how Dotsenko-Fateev\nall-with-all (star) pair \"interaction\" is reduced to the quiver model\nnearest-neighbor (chain) one. We give new identities for q-Selberg averages of\npairs of generalized Macdonald polynomials. We also translate the slicing\ninvariance of refined topological strings into the language of conformal blocks\nand interpret it as abelianization of generalized Macdonald polynomials.\n", "  Josephson junctions made with conventional s-wave superconductors and\ncontaining multiple layers of ferromagnetic materials can carry spin-triplet\nsupercurrent in the presence of certain types of magnetic inhomogeneity. In\njunctions containing three ferromagnetic layers, the triplet supercurrent is\npredicted to be maximal when the magnetizations of adjacent layers are\northogonal, and zero when the magnetizations of any two adjacent layers are\nparallel. Here we demonstrate on-off control of the spin-triplet supercurrent\nin such junctions, achieved by rotating the magnetization direction of one of\nthe three layers by 90$^{\\circ}$. We obtain \"on-off\" ratios of 5, 7, and 19 for\nthe supercurrent in the three samples studied so far. These observations\ndirectly confirm one of the most salient predictions of the theory, and pave\nthe way for applications of spin-triplet Josephson junctions in the nascent\narea of \"superconducting spintronics.\"\n", "  IRAS 22134+5834 was observed in the centimeter with (E)VLA, 3~mm with CARMA,\n2~mm with PdBI, and 1.3~mm with SMA, to study the continuum emission as well as\nthe molecular lines, that trace different physical conditions of the gas to\nstudy the influence of massive YSOs on nearby starless cores, and the possible\nimplications in the clustered star formation process. The multi-wavelength\ncentimeter continuum observations revealed two radio sources within the\ncluster, VLA1 and VLA2. VLA1 is considered to be an optically thin UCHII region\nwith a size of 0.01~pc and sits at the edge of the near-infrared (NIR) cluster.\nThe flux of ionizing photons of the VLA1 corresponds to a B1 ZAMS star. VLA2 is\nassociated with an infrared point source and has a negative spectral index. We\nresolved six millimeter continuum cores at 2~mm, MM2 is associated with the\nUCHII region VLA1, and other dense cores are distributed around the UCH{\\sc ii}\nregion. Two high-mass starless clumps (HMSC), HMSC-E (east) and HMSC-W (west),\nare detected around the NIR cluster with N$_2$H$^+$(1--0) and NH$_3$ emission,\nand show different physical and chemical properties. Two N$_2$D$^+$ cores are\ndetected on an NH$_3$ filament close to the UCHII region, with a projected\nseparation of $\\sim$8000~AU at the assumed distance of 2.6~kpc. The kinematic\nproperties of the molecular line emission confirm the expansion of the UCHII\nregion and that the molecular cloud around the near infrared (NIR) cluster is\nalso expanding. Our multi-wavelength study has revealed different generations\nof star formation in IRAS 22134+5834. The formed intermediate- to massive stars\nshow strong impact on nearby starless clumps. We propose that while the stellar\nwind from the UCHII region and the NIR cluster drives the large scale bubble,\nthe starless clumps and HMPOs formed at the edge of the cluster.\n", "  The annihilation of non-relativistic dark matter particles at tree level can\nbe strongly enhanced by the radiation of an additional gauge boson. This is\nparticularly true for the helicity-suppressed annihilation of Majorana\nparticles, like neutralinos, into fermion pairs. Surprisingly, and despite the\npotentially large effect due to the strong coupling, this has so far been\nstudied in much less detail for the internal bremsstrahlung of gluons than for\nphotons or electroweak gauge bosons. Here, we aim at bridging that gap by\npresenting a general analysis of neutralino annihilation into quark anti-quark\npairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and\nkeeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We\nfind in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for\nscenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest\nneutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and\ngamma-ray spectra. Both effects significantly impact limits from indirect\nsearches for dark matter and are thus important to be taken into account in,\ne.g., global scans. For extensive scans, on the other hand, full calculations\nof QCD corrections are numerically typically too expensive to perform for each\npoint in parameter space. We present here for the first time an efficient,\nnumerically fast implementation of QCD corrections, extendable in a\nstraight-forward way to non-supersymmetric models, which avoids computationally\ndemanding full one-loop calculations or event generator runs and yet fully\ncaptures the leading effects relevant for indirect dark matter searches. In\nthis context, we also present updated constraints on dark matter annihilation\nfrom cosmic-ray antiproton data. Finally, we comment on the impact of our\nresults on relic density calculations.\n", "  The dynamics of nonlinear systems qualitatively change depending on their\nparameters, which is called bifurcation. A quantum-mechanical nonlinear\noscillator can yield a quantum superposition of two oscillation states, known\nas a Schr\\\"odinger cat state, via quantum adiabatic evolution through its\nbifurcation point. Here we propose a quantum computer comprising such quantum\nnonlinear oscillators, instead of quantum bits, to solve hard combinatorial\noptimization problems. The nonlinear oscillator network finds optimal solutions\nvia quantum adiabatic evolution, where nonlinear terms are increased slowly, in\ncontrast to conventional adiabatic quantum computation or quantum annealing,\nwhere quantum fluctuation terms are decreased slowly. As a result of numerical\nsimulations, it is concluded that quantum superposition and quantum fluctuation\nwork effectively to find optimal solutions. It is also notable that the present\ncomputer is analogous to neural computers, which are also networks of nonlinear\ncomponents. Thus, the present scheme will open new possibilities for quantum\ncomputation, nonlinear science, and artificial intelligence.\n", "  Most modern astrophysical datasets are multi-dimensional; a characteristic\nthat can nowadays generally be conserved and exploited scientifically during\nthe data reduction/simulation and analysis cascades. Yet, the same\nmulti-dimensional datasets are systematically cropped, sliced and/or projected\nto printable two-dimensional (2-D) diagrams at the publication stage. In this\narticle, we introduce the concept of the \"X3D pathway\" as a mean of simplifying\nand easing the access to data visualization and publication via\nthree-dimensional (3-D) diagrams. The X3D pathway exploits the facts that 1)\nthe X3D 3-D file format lies at the center of a product tree that includes\ninteractive HTML documents, 3-D printing, and high-end animations, and 2) all\nhigh-impact-factor & peer-reviewed journals in Astrophysics are now published\n(some exclusively) online. We argue that the X3D standard is an ideal vector\nfor sharing multi-dimensional datasets, as it provides direct access to a range\nof different data visualization techniques, is fully-open source, and is a well\ndefined ISO standard. Unlike other earlier propositions to publish\nmulti-dimensional datasets via 3-D diagrams, the X3D pathway is not tied to\nspecific software (prone to rapid and unexpected evolution), but instead\ncompatible with a range of open-source software already in use by our\ncommunity. The interactive HTML branch of the X3D pathway is also actively\nsupported by leading peer-reviewed journals in the field of Astrophysics.\nFinally, this article provides interested readers with a detailed set of\npractical astrophysical examples designed to act as a stepping stone towards\nthe implementation of the X3D pathway for any other dataset.\n", "  We demonstrate a monolithically integrable heralded photon source in a\nfemtosecond laser direct written glass waveguide. The generation of photon\npairs with a wide wavelength separation requires a concomitant large\nbirefringence in the normal dispersion regime. Here, by incorporation of\nside-stress tracks, we produce a waveguide with a birefringence of\n$1.64\\times~10^{-4}$ and propagation loss as low as 0.21 dB/cm near 980~nm. We\nmeasure photon pairs with 300~nm wavelength separation at an internal\ngeneration rate exceeding $5.05\\times10^6$/s. The second order correlations\nindicate that the generated photon pairs are in a strongly non-classical\nregime.\n", "  Observation of replica bands in the ARPES spectra of the single-layer FeSe on\nstrontium titanate substrate revealed a phonon component among mechanisms\nbehind high Tc superconductivity there. We study the interaction of the\nin-layer FeSe electrons with the electric potential of the longitudinal (LO)\nmodes at surface of bulk SrTiO3. A two-dimensional system of charges at the\nFeSe/SrTiO3 interface includes both the itinerant and immobile electrons. The\nlatter significantly change the interface characteristics, increasing screening\nat the substrate surface and reducing thereby the strength of the electron-LO\nphonon interactions. In that follows the dielectric constant serves as a free\nparameter and is found from the ARPES data for the replicas. The\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb screening is accounted for in the random phase\napproximation. It is shown that the model is applicable within the whole range\nof the parameters typical for current experiments. The estimates allow\nconcluding that the LO-phonon mediated pairing alone cannot account for the\ntemperatures of the superconducting transition Tc in the single-layer\nFeSe/SrTiO3 reported in these experiments. This does not exclude that the\nLO-phonons mechanism can become more significant in the differently and better\nprepared single layer FeSe films. Available experiments are briefly discussed.\nThus far no data exist on the dependence of Tc on the concentration of\nelectrons doped into the in-layer FeSe band.\n", "  We present the calculation of the Lyman-alpha (Lyman-$\\alpha$) transmitted\nflux fluctuations with full relativistic corrections to the first order. Even\nthough several studies exist on relativistic effects in galaxy clustering, this\nis the first study to extend the formalism to a different tracer of underlying\nmatter at unique redshift range ($z=2-5$). Furthermore, we show a comprehensive\napplication of our calculations of the Quasar-Lyman-$\\alpha$ cross-correlation\nfunction. Our results indicate that the signal of relativistic effects is\nsizeable at Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale mainly due to the large\ndifference in density bias factors of our tracers. We construct an observable,\nthe anti-symmetric part of the cross-correlation function, that is dominated by\nthe relativistic signal and offers a new way to measure the relativistic terms\nat relatively small scales. The analysis shows that relativistic effects are\nimportant when considering cross-correlations between tracers with very\ndifferent biases, and should be included in the data analysis of the current\nand future surveys. Moreover, the idea presented in this paper is highly\ncomplementary to other techniques and observable trying to isolate the effect\nof the relativistic corrections and thus test the validity of the theory of\ngravity beyond the Newtonian regime.\n", "  We consider a superconducting microwave cavity capacitively coupled to both a\nquantum conductor and its electronic reservoirs. We analyze in details how the\nmeasurements of the cavity microwave field, which are related to the electronic\ncharge susceptibility, can be used to extract information on the transport\nproperties of the quantum conductor. We show that the asymmetry of the\ncapacitive couplings between the electronic reservoirs and the cavity plays a\ncrucial role in relating optical measurements to transport properties. For\nasymmetric capacitive couplings, photonic measurements can be used to probe the\nfinite low frequency admittance of the quantum conductor, the real part of\nwhich being related to the differential conductance. In particular, when the\nquantum dot is far from resonance, the charge susceptibility is directly\nproportional to the admittance for a large range of frequencies and voltages.\nHowever, when the quantum conductor is near a resonance, such a relation\ngenerally holds only at low frequency and for equal tunnel coupling or low\nvoltage. Beyond this low-energy near equilibrium regime, the charge\nsusceptibility and thus the optical transmission offers new insights on the\nquantum conductors since the optical observables are not directly connected to\ntransport quantities. For symmetric lead capacitive couplings, we show that the\noptical measurements can be used to reveal the Korringa-Shiba relation,\nconnecting the reactive to the dissipative part of the susceptibility, at low\nfrequency and low bias.\n", "  The hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins (or, Overhauser noise) has long\nbeen viewed as a leading source of decoherence in individual quantum dot spin\nqubits. Here we show that in a coupled multi-qubit system consisting of as few\nas four spins, interactions with nuclear spins can have the opposite effect\nwhere they instead preserve the collective quantum state of the system. This\nnoise-induced state preservation can be realized in a linear spin qubit array\nusing current technological capabilities. Our proposal requires no control over\nthe Overhauser fields in the array; only experimental control over the average\ninterqubit coupling between nearest neighbors is needed, and this is readily\nachieved by tuning gate voltages. Our results illustrate how the role of the\nenvironment can transform from harmful to helpful in the progression from\nsingle-qubit to multi-qubit quantum systems.\n", "  Deformation twinning in pure aluminum has been considered to be a unique\nproperty of nanostructured aluminum. A lingering mystery is whether deformation\ntwinning occurs in coarse-grained or single-crystal aluminum, at scales beyond\nnanotwins. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of macro\ndeformation twins in single-crystal aluminum formed under ultrahigh strain-rate\n($\\sim$10$^6$ s$^{-1}$), large shear strain (200$\\%$) via dynamic equal channel\nangular pressing. Deformation twinning is rooted in the rate dependences of\ndislocation motion and twinning, which are coupled, complementary processes\nduring severe plastic deformation under ultrahigh strain rates.\n", "  One of the missing elements for realising an integrated optical circuit is a\nrectifying device playing the role of an optical diode. A proposal based on a\npair of two-level atoms strongly coupled to a one-dimenisonal waveguide showed\na promising behavior based on a semi-classical study [Fratini et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 113, 243601 (2014)]. Our study in the full quantum regime shows\nthat, in such a device, rectification is a purely multi-photon effect. For an\ninput field in a coherent state, rectification reaches up to $70\\%$ for the\nrange of power in which one of the two atoms is excited, but not both.\n", "  Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are a natural byproduct of galaxy\nmergers. Previous studies have shown that flares from stellar tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) are modified by the presence of a secondary perturber, causing\ninterruptions in the light curve. We study the dynamics of TDE debris in the\npresence of a milliparsec-separated MBHB by integrating ballistic particle\norbits in the time-varying potential of the binary. We find that gaps in the\nlight curve appear when material misses the accretion radius on its first\nreturn to pericentre. Subsequent recurrences can be decomposed into\n\"continuous\" and \"delayed\" components, which exhibit different behaviour. We\nfind that this potential can substantially alter the locations of stream\nself-intersections. When debris is confined to the plane, we find that close\nencounters with the secondary BH leave noticeable signatures on the fallback\nrate and can result in significant accretion onto the secondary BH. Tight,\nequal-mass MBHBs accrete equally, periodically trading the infalling stream.\n", "  We study the transmission of information and correlations through quantum\nfields in cosmological backgrounds. With this aim, we make use of quantum\ninformation tools to quantify the classical and quantum correlations induced by\na quantum massless scalar field in two particle detectors, one located in the\nearly universe (Alice's) and the other located at a later time (Bob's). In\nparticular, we focus on two phenomena: a) the consequences on the transmission\nof information of the violations of the strong Huygens principle for quantum\nfields, and b) the analysis of the field vacuum correlations via correlation\nharvesting from Alice to Bob. We will study a standard cosmological model first\nand then assess whether these results also hold if we use other than the\ngeneral relativistic dynamics. As a particular example, we will study the\ntransmission of information through the Big Bounce, that replaces the Big Bang,\nin the effective dynamics of Loop Quantum Cosmology.\n", "  We propose a general framework for constructing universal steering criteria\nthat are applicable to arbitrary bipartite states and measurement settings of\nthe steering party. The same framework is also useful for studying the joint\nmeasurement problem. Based on the data-processing inequality for an extended\nR\\'enyi relative entropy, we then introduce a family of universal steering\ninequalities, which detect steering much more efficiently than those\ninequalities known before. As illustrations, we show unbounded violation of a\nsteering inequality for assemblages constructed from mutually unbiased bases\nand establish an interesting connection between maximally steerable assemblages\nand complete sets of mutually unbiased bases. We also provide a single steering\ninequality that can detect all bipartite pure states of full Schmidt rank. In\nthe course of study, we generalize a number of results intimately connected to\ndata-processing inequalities, which are of independent interest.\n", "  The Majorana neutrino in type-I seesaw and the pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in the\ninverse seesaw can have sizable mixings with the light neutrinos in the\nstandard model (SM), through which the heavy neutrinos can be produced at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). In producing the heavy neutrinos we study a\nvariety of initial states such as quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon as\nwell as photon mediated processes. For the Majorana heavy neutrino production\nwe consider same-sign di-lepton plus di-jet as the signal events. Using the\nrecent ATLAS and CMS data at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV with 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ and 19.7\nfb$^{-1}$ luminosities, respectively, we obtain direct upper bounds on the\nlight-heavy neutrino mixing angles. For the pseudo-Dirac heavy neutrino\nproduction we consider the final sate with tri-lepton plus missing energy as\nthe signal events. Using the recent anomalous multi-lepton search by CMS at\n$\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV with 19.5 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity we obtain upper bounds on the\nmixing angles. Taking the varieties of initial states into account, the\npreviously obtained upper bounds on the mixing angles have been improved. We\nscale our results at the 8 TeV LHC to obtain a prospective search reach at the\n14 TeV LHC with high luminosities.\n", "  The influence of the collimating conditions of the incident beam on\ndiffraction patterns produced by grazing scattering of fast atoms off crystal\nsurfaces is studied within a semi-quantum approach, named Surface Initial Value\nRepresentation (SIVR) approximation. In this approach we incorporate a\nrealistic description of the incident particle in terms of the collimating\nparameters, which determine the surface area that is coherently illuminated.\nThe model is applied to He atoms colliding with a LiF(001) surface after\npassing through a rectangular aperture. As it was experimentally observed [1],\nSIVR spectra as a function of the azimuthal angle are very sensitive to the\nwidth of the collimating slit. We also found that the length of the collimating\naperture affects polar angle distributions, introducing additional interference\nstructures for the longer collimating slits.\n", "  In the energy range from few TeV to 25 TeV, upper bounds on the dark matter\ndecay rate into high energy monochromatic neutrinos have recently become\ncomparable to those on monochromatic gamma-ray lines. This implies clear\npossibilities of a future double \"smoking-gun\" evidence for the dark matter\nparticle, from the observation of both a gamma and a neutrino line at the same\nenergy. In particular, we show that a scenario where both lines are induced\nfrom the same dark matter particle decay leads to correlations that can already\nbe tested. We study this \"double monochromatic\" scenario by considering the\ncomplete list of lowest dimensional effective operators that could induce such\na decay. Furthermore, we argue that, on top of lines from decays into two-body\nfinal states, three-body final states can also be highly relevant. In addition\nto producing a distinct hard photon spectrum, three-body final states also\nproduce a line-like feature in the neutrino spectrum that can be searched for\nby neutrino telescopes.\n", "  We study the chiral behavior of the electromagnetic (EM) form factors of pion\nand kaon in three-flavor lattice QCD. In order to make a direct comparison of\nthe lattice data with chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), we employ the overlap\nquark action that has exact chiral symmetry. Gauge ensembles are generated at a\nlattice spacing of 0.11 fm with four pion masses ranging between M_pi \\simeq\n290 MeV and 540 MeV and with a strange quark mass m_s close to its physical\nvalue. We utilize the all-to-all quark propagator technique to calculate the EM\nform factors with high precision. Their dependence on m_s and on the momentum\ntransfer is studied by using the reweighting technique and the twisted boundary\nconditions for the quark fields, respectively. A detailed comparison with SU(2)\nand SU(3) ChPT reveals that the next-to-next-to-leading order terms in the\nchiral expansion are important to describe the chiral behavior of the form\nfactors in the pion mass range studied in this work. We estimate the relevant\nlow-energy constants and the charge radii, and find reasonable agreement with\nphenomenological and experimental results.\n", "  The driving of charge carriers confined in a quantum well lacking the center\nof space inversion by an alternating electric field leads to the formation of a\ndirect electric current. We develop a microscopic theory of such a quantum\nratchet effect for quantum wells subjected to a static magnetic field. We show\nthat the ratchet current emerges for a linearly polarized alternating electric\nfield as well as a rotating electric field and drastically increases at the\ncyclotron resonance conditions. For the magnetic field tilted with respect to\nthe quantum well normal, the ratchet current contains an additional resonance\nat the first subharmonic of the cyclotron resonance.\n", "  We present a unitary multichannel model for $\\bar{K}N$ scattering in the\nresonance region that fulfills unitarity. It has the correct analytical\nproperties for the amplitudes once they are extended to the complex-$s$ plane\nand the partial waves have the right threshold behavior. To determine the\nparameters of the model, we have fitted single-energy partial waves up to\n$J=7/2$ and up to 2.15 GeV of energy in the center-of-mass reference frame\nobtaining the poles of the $\\Lambda^*$ and $\\Sigma^*$ resonances, which are\ncompared to previous analyses. We provide the most comprehensive picture of the\n$S=-1$ hyperon spectrum to date. Important differences are found between the\navailable analyses making the gathering of further experimental information on\n$\\bar{K}N$ scattering mandatory to make progress in the assessment of the\nhyperon spectrum.\n", "  We show that the bipartite logarithmic entanglement negativity (EN) of\nquantum spin models obeys an area law at all nonzero temperatures. We develop\nnumerical linked cluster (NLC) expansions for the `area-law' logarithmic\nentanglement negativity as a function of temperature and other parameters. For\none-dimensional models the results of NLC are compared with exact\ndiagonalization on finite systems and are found to agree very well. The NLC\nresults are also obtained for two dimensional XXZ and transverse-field Ising\nmodels. In all cases, we find a sudden onset (or sudden death) of negativity at\na finite temperature above which the negativity is zero. We use perturbation\ntheory to develop a physical picture for this sudden onset (or sudden death).\nThe onset of EN or its magnitude are insensitive to classical\nfinite-temperature phase transitions, supporting the argument for absence of\nany role of quantum mechanics at such transitions. On approach to a quantum\ncritical point at $T=0$, negativity shows critical scaling in size and\ntemperature.\n", "  The Inert Doublet Model relies on a discrete symmetry to prevent couplings of\nthe new scalars to Standard Model fermions. This stabilizes the lightest inert\nstate, which can then contribute to the observed dark matter density. In the\npresence of additional approximate symmetries, the resulting spectrum of exotic\nscalars can be compressed. Here, we study the phenomenological and cosmological\nimplications of this scenario. We derive new limits on the compressed Inert\nDoublet Model from LEP, and outline the prospects for exclusion and discovery\nof this model at dark matter experiments, the LHC, and future colliders.\n", "  Detailed experimental and theoretical studies of the temperature dependence\nof the effect of different scattering mechanisms on electrical transport\nproperties of graphene devices are presented. We find that for high mobility\ndevices the transport properties are mainly governed by completely screened\nshort range impurity scattering. On the other hand, for the low mobility\ndevices transport properties are determined by both types of scattering\npotentials - long range due to ionized impurities and short range due to\ncompletely screened charged impurities. The results could be explained in the\nframework of Boltzmann transport equations involving the two independent\nscattering mechanisms.\n", "  We study the existence of first integrals in nonholonomic systems with\nsymmetry. First we define the concept of $\\mathcal{M}$-cotangent lift of a\nvector field on a manifold $Q$ in order to unify the works [Balseiro P., Arch.\nRation. Mech. Anal. 214 (2014), 453-501, arXiv:1301.1091], [Fass\\`o F., Ramos\nA., Sansonetto N., Regul. Chaotic Dyn. 12 (2007), 579-588], and [Fass\\`o F.,\nGiacobbe A., Sansonetto N., Rep. Math. Phys. 62 (2008), 345-367]. Second, we\nstudy gauge symmetries and gauge momenta, in the cases in which there are the\nsymmetries that satisfy the so-called vertical symmetry condition. Under such\ncondition we can predict the number of linearly independent first integrals\n(that are gauge momenta). We illustrate the theory with two examples.\n", "  We report on the study of interstellar extinction across the Tarantula nebula\n(30 Doradus), in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using observations from the Hubble\nTarantula Treasury Project in the 0.3 - 1.6 micron range. The considerable and\npatchy extinction inside the nebula causes about 3500 red clump stars to be\nscattered along the reddening vector in the colour-magnitude diagrams, thereby\nallowing an accurate determination of the reddening slope in all bands. The\nmeasured slope of the reddening vector is remarkably steeper in all bands than\nin the the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium. At optical wavelengths, the\nlarger ratio of total-to-selective extinction, namely Rv = 4.5 +/- 0.2, implies\nthe presence of a grey component in the extinction law, due to a larger\nfraction of large grains. The extra large grains are most likely ices from\nsupernova ejecta and will significantly alter the extinction properties of the\nregion until they sublimate in 50 - 100 Myr. We discuss the implications of\nthis extinction law for the Tarantula nebula and in general for regions of\nmassive star formation in galaxies. Our results suggest that fluxes of strongly\nstar forming regions are likely to be underestimated by a factor of about 2 in\nthe optical.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of TaAs, a prototype Weyl semimetal.\nTaAs crystals show weak diamagnetism with magnetic susceptibility of about -7 *\n10^{-7} emu/(g*Oe) at 5 K. A general feature is the appearance of a minimum at\naround 185 K in magnetization measurements as a function of temperature. No\nphase transition is observed in the temperature range between 5 K and 400 K.\nThe magnetic properties indicate that the intrinsic Fermi level in TaAs is not\nlocated at the Weyl nodes, in agreement with the theory prediction.\n", "  Recent experiments access the time-resolved photoelectron signal originating\nfrom plasmon satellites in correlated materials and address their build-up and\ndecay in real time. Motivated by these developments, we present the\nKadanoff-Baym formalism for the nonequilibrium time evolution of interacting\nfermions and bosons. In contrast to the fermionic case the bosons are described\nby second-order differential equations. Solution of the bosonic Kadanoff-Baym\nequations - which is the central ingredient of this work - requires substantial\nmodification of the usual two-times electronic propagation scheme. The solution\nis quite general and can be applied to a number of problems, such as the\ninteraction of electrons with quantized photons, phonons and other bosonic\nexcitations. Here, the formalism is applied to the photoemission from a deep\ncore hole accompanied by plasmon excitation. We compute the time-resolved\nphotoelectron spectra and discuss the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic\nelectron energy losses and their interference.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of the next generation of flavor-based\nlow-energy experiments to probe the supersymmetric parameter space in the\ncontext of the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM), and examine the complementarity\nwith direct searches for Supersymmetry at the 13 TeV LHC in a quantitative\nmanner. To this end, we enlarge the previously studied pMSSM parameter space to\ninclude all physical non-zero CP-violating phases, namely those associated with\nthe gaugino mass parameters, Higgsino mass parameter, and the tri-linear\ncouplings of the top quark, bottom quark and tau lepton. We find that future\nelectric dipole moment and flavor measurements can have a strong impact on the\nviability of these models even if the sparticle spectrum is out of reach of the\n13 TeV LHC. In particular, the lack of positive signals in future low-energy\nprobes would exclude values of the phases between ${\\cal O}(10^{-2})$ and\n${\\cal O}(10^{-1})$. We also find regions of parameter space where large phases\nremain allowed due to cancellations. Most interestingly, in some rare\nprocesses, such as BR($B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ ), we find that contributions\narising from CP-violating phases can bring the potentially large SUSY\ncontributions into better agreement with experiment and Standard Model\npredictions.\n", "  The known static electro-vacuum black holes in a globally AdS$_4$ background\nhave an event horizon which is geometrically a round sphere. In this work we\nargue that the situation is different in models with matter fields possessing\nan explicit dependence on the azimuthal angle $\\varphi$, which, however, does\nnot manifest at the level of the energy-momentum tensor. As a result, the full\nsolutions are axially symmetric only, possessing a single (timelike) Killing\nvector field. Explicit examples of such static black holes are constructed in\nEinstein--(complex) scalar field and Einstein--Yang-Mills theories. The basic\nproperties of these solutions are discussed, looking for generic features. For\nexample, we notice that the horizon has an oblate spheroidal shape for\nsolutions with a scalar field and a prolate one for black holes with Yang-Mills\nfields. The deviation from sphericity of the horizon geometry manifests itself\nin the holographic stress-tensor. Finally, based on the results obtained in the\nprobe limit, we conjecture the existence in the Einstein-Maxwell theory of\nstatic black holes with axial symmetry only.\n", "  We investigate the strain dependence of the ferroelectric polarization and\nthe structure of the ferroelectric domain walls in the layered\nperovskite-related barium fluorides, BaMF$_4$ (M=Mg, Zn). The unusual\n\"geometric ferroelectricity\" in these materials is driven by the softening of a\nsingle polar phonon mode consisting of rotations of the MF$_6$ octahedra\naccompanied by polar displacements of the Ba cations, and in contrast to\nconventional ferroelectrics involves minimal electronic rehybridization. We\ntherefore anticipate a different strain dependence of the polarization, and\nalternative domain wall structures compared with those found in conventional\nferroelectric materials. Using first-principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT) within the general gradient approximation (GGA), we\ncalculate the variation of the crystal structure and the ferroelectric\npolarization under both compressive and tensile strain. We perform structural\nrelaxations of neutral domain walls between oppositely oriented directions of\nthe ferroelectric polarization and calculate their corresponding energies to\ndetermine which are most likely to form. We compare our results to literature\nvalues for conventional perovskite oxides to provide a source of comparison for\nunderstanding the ferroelectric properties of alternative non-oxide materials\nsuch as the barium fluorides.\n", "  We present the CosmoBolognaLib, a large set of Open Source C++ numerical\nlibraries for cosmological calculations. CosmoBolognaLib is a living project\naimed at defining a common numerical environment for cosmological\ninvestigations of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In particular, one\nof the primary focuses of this software is to help in handling astronomical\ncatalogues, both real and simulated, measuring one-point, two-point and\nthree-point statistics in configuration space, and performing cosmological\nanalyses. In this paper, we discuss the main features of this software,\nproviding an overview of all the available C++ classes implemented up to now.\nBoth the CosmoBolognaLib and their associated doxygen documentation can be\nfreely downloaded at https://github.com/federicomarulli/CosmoBolognaLib. We\nprovide also some examples to explain how these libraries can be included in\neither C++ or Python codes.\n", "  We examine the internal consistency of the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) temperature anisotropy power spectrum. We show that tension\nexists between cosmological constant cold dark matter (LCDM) model parameters\ninferred from multipoles l<1000 (roughly those accessible to Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe), and from l>=1000, particularly the CDM density,\nOmega_ch^2, which is discrepant at 2.5 sigma for a Planck-motivated prior on\nthe optical depth, tau=0.07+/-0.02. We find some parameter tensions to be\nlarger than previously reported because of inaccuracy in the code used by the\nPlanck Collaboration to generate model spectra. The Planck l>=1000 constraints\nare also in tension with low-redshift data sets, including Planck's own\nmeasurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum (2.4 sigma), and the most precise\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination (2.5 sigma). The Hubble\nconstant predicted by Planck from l>=1000, H_0=64.1+/-1.7 km/s/Mpc, disagrees\nwith the most precise local distance ladder measurement of 73.0+/-2.4 km/s/Mpc\nat the 3.0 sigma level, while the Planck value from l<1000, 69.7+/-1.7\nkm/s/Mpc, is consistent within 1 sigma. A discrepancy between the Planck and\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT) high-multipole CMB spectra disfavors interpreting\nthese tensions as evidence for new physics. We conclude that the parameters\nfrom the Planck high-multipole spectrum probably differ from the underlying\nvalues due to either an unlikely statistical fluctuation or unaccounted-for\nsystematics persisting in the Planck data.\n", "  We combine tunable mid-infrared (MIR) pump pulses with time- and\nangle-resolved two-photon photoemission to study ultrafast photoexcitation of\nthe topological surface state (TSS) of Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. It is revealed that\nMIR pulses permit a direct excitation of the unoccupied TSS owing to an optical\ncoupling across the Dirac point. The novel optical coupling provokes asymmetric\ntransient populations of the TSS at ${\\pm}k_{||}$, which mirrors a macroscopic\nphotoexcited electric surface current. By observing the decay of the asymmetric\npopulation, we directly demonstrate the dynamics of the long-lived photocurrent\nand its protection against backscattering. Our discovery promises important\nadvantages of photoexcitation by MIR pulses for spintronic applications.\n", "  The pseudo-Newtonian potential of Paczynski and Wiita for particles orbiting\na Schwarzschild black hole is generalized to arbitrary static and spherically\nsymmetric spacetimes, including black hole solutions of alternative theories of\ngravity. In addition to being more general, our prescription differs\nsubstantially from a previous one in the literature, showing that even the\nassociation of a pseudo-Newtonian potential with a simple black hole metric is\nnot unique.\n", "  In earlier work, we derived a nonlinear, nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation for\nthe Yard-Sale Model of asset exchange. In the absence of redistribution, we\nshowed that the Gini coefficient is a Lyapunov functional for this model,\ntending to one in the time-asymptotic limit, corresponding to maximal\ninequality. When a one-parameter model of redistribution is introduced, we\nshowed that the model admits a steady state similar to Pareto's Law.\n  In this work, we analyze the form of this distribution in greater detail,\nboth analytically and numerically. We find that, while Pareto's Law is\napproximately valid for low redistribution, it gives way to something like\nGibrat's Law at higher redistribution. We also prove that, while this Pareto or\nGibrat behavior persists over many orders of magnitude, it ultimately gives way\nto gaussian decay at extremely large wealth.\n  Following the work of Moukarzel et al., we introduce a bias in favor of the\nwealthier agent. We derive the corresponding modification to the Fokker-Planck\nequation, and we show this leads to wealth condensation when the bias exceeds a\ncritical value. Earlier work took the bias to be a discontinuous function of\nthe wealth differential between the two transacting agents, and reported a\nfirst-order phase transition to absolute oligarchy. By contrast, in this work\nwe take the bias to be a continuous function of the wealth differential, and\nconsequently we observe a second-order phase transition with a region of\ncoexistence between the oligarch and a distribution of non-oligarchs.\n  We additionally show that the onset of wealth condensation has a reciprocal\neffect on the character of the non-oligarchical part of the distribution.\nSpecifically, we show that the above-mentioned gaussian decay at extremely\nlarge wealth is valid both above and below criticality, but degenerates to\nexponential decay precisely at criticality.\n", "  In this paper, the question of observability of a heavy charged Higgs in the\nmass range 400 GeV < mH < 1000 GeV, is addressed. The production process is set\nto pp -> H+ -> tb at 14 TeV LHC. The analysis benefits from top tagging\ntechnique which is based on finding a fat jet as a result of the boosted top\nquark decay in signal events. A detailed hadron level analysis is performed and\nselection efficiencies are presented with different charged Higgs mass\nhypotheses. Finally running toy experiments and using pseudo-data, a fit over\nsignal plus background distributions is performed to assess possibility of\nreconstructing the charged Higgs peak and its invariant mass measurement. It is\nshown that the charged Higgs mass can well be reconstructed in the mass range\n500 GeV to 1 TeV, with a signal significance which depends on tanbeta.\nEventually 5sigma discovery and 95% C.L. exclusion contours are also provided.\n", "  We consider the motion of a point-like impurity through a three-dimensional\ntwo-component Bose-Einstein condensate subject to Weyl spin-orbit coupling.\nUsing linear-response theory, we calculate the drag force felt by the impurity\nand the associated anisotropic critical velocity from the spectrum of\nelementary excitations. The drag force is shown to be generally not collinear\nwith the velocity of the impurity. This unusual behavior is a consequence of\ncondensation into a finite-momentum state due to the spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We study the transport efficiency of excitations on complex quantum networks\nwith loops. For this we consider sequentially growing networks with different\ntopologies of the sequential subgraphs. This can lead either to a universal\ncomplete breakdown of transport for complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs or\nto optimal transport for ring-like sequential subgraphs. The transition to\noptimal transport can be triggered by systematically reducing the number of\nloops of complete-graph-like sequential subgraphs in a small-world procedure.\nThese effects are explained on the basis of the spectral properties of the\nnetwork's Hamiltonian. Our theoretical considerations are supported by\nnumerical Monte-Carlo simulations for complex quantum networks with a\nscale-free size distribution of sequential subgraphs and a small-world-type\ntransition to optimal transport.\n", "  We have developed a lab work module where we teach undergraduate students how\nto quantify the dynamics of a suspension of microscopic particles, measuring\nand analyzing the motion of those particles at the individual level or as a\ngroup. Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) is a relatively recent technique\nthat precisely does that and constitutes an alternative method to more\nclassical techniques such as dynamics light scattering (DLS) or video particle\ntracking (VPT). DDM consists in imaging a particle dispersion with a standard\nlight microscope and a camera. The image analysis requires the students to code\nand relies on digital Fourier transform to obtain the intermediate scattering\nfunction, an autocorrelation function that characterizes the dynamics of the\ndispersion. We first illustrate DDM on the textbook case of colloids where we\nmeasure the diffusion coefficient. Then we show that DDM is a pertinent tool to\ncharacterize biologic systems such as motile bacteria i.e.bacteria that can\nself propel, where we not only determine the diffusion coefficient but also the\nvelocity and the fraction of motile bacteria. Finally, so that our paper can be\nused as a tutorial to the DDM technique, we have joined to this article movies\nof the colloidal and bacterial suspensions and the DDM algorithm in both Matlab\nand Python to analyze the movies.\n", "  We consider the general scalar field Horndeski Lagrangian coupled to matter.\nWithin this class of models, we present two results that are independent of the\nparticular form of the model. First, we show that in a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker metric the Horndeski Lagrangian coincides with the\npressure of the scalar field. Second, we employ the previous result to identify\nthe most general form of the Lagrangian that allows for cosmological scaling\nsolutions, i.e. solutions where the ratio of matter to field density and the\nequation of state remain constant. Scaling solutions of this kind may help\nsolving the coincidence problem since in this case the presently observed ratio\nof matter to dark energy does not depend on initial conditions, but rather on\nthe theoretical parameters.\n", "  As a part of the long-term program at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO),\nthe Mn I 539.4 nm line has been observed for nearly three solar cycles using\nthe McMath telescope and the 13.5 m spectrograph in double-pass mode. These\nfull-disk spectrophotometric observations revealed an unusually strong change\nof this line's parameters over the solar cycle. Optical pumping by the Mg II k\nline was originally proposed to explain these variations. More recent studies\nhave proposed that this is not required and that the magnetic variability might\nexplain it. Magnetic variability is also the mechanism that drives the changes\nin total solar irradiance variations (TSI). With this work we investigate this\nproposition quantitatively by using using the model SATIRE-S. We applied\nexactly the same model atmospheres and value of the free parameter as were used\nin previous solar irradiance reconstructions to now model the variation in the\nMn I 539.4 nm line profile and in neighboring Fe I lines. We compared the\nresults of the theoretical model with KPNO observations. Our result confirms\nthat optical pumping of the Mn I 539.4 nm line by Mg II k is not the main cause\nof its solar cycle change. It also provides independent confirmation of solar\nirradiance models which are based on the assumption that irradiance variations\nare caused by the evolution of the solar surface magnetic flux. The result\nobtained here also supports the spectral irradiance variations computed by\nthese models.\n", "  Meson factories are powerful drivers of diverse physics programmes. With beam\npowers already in the MW-regime attention has to be turned to target and beam\nline design to further significantly increase surface muon rates available for\nexperiments. For this reason we have explored the possibility of using a\nneutron spallation target as a source of surface muons by performing detailed\nGeant4 simulations with pion production cross sections based on a\nparametrization of existing data. While the spallation target outperforms\nstandard targets in the backward direction by more than a factor 7 it is not\nmore efficient than standard targets viewed under 90{\\deg}. Not surprisingly,\nthe geometry of the target plays a large role in the generation of surface\nmuons. Through careful optimization, a gain in surface muon rate of between 30\n- 60% over the standard \"box-like\" target used at the Paul Scherrer Institute\ncould be achieved by employing a rotated slab target. An additional 10% gain\ncould also be possible by utilizing novel target materials such as, e.g., boron\ncarbide.\n", "  The retainability of canonical distributions for a Brownian particle\ncontrolled by a time-dependent harmonic potential is investigated in the\noverdamped and underdamped situations, respectively. Because of different time\nscales, the overdamped and underdamped Langevin equations (as well as the\ncorresponding Fokker-Planck equations) lead to distinctive restrictions on\nprotocols maintaining canonical distributions. Two special cases are analyzed\nin details: First, a Brownian particle is controlled by a time-dependent\nharmonic potential and embedded in medium with constant temperature; Second, a\nBrownian particle is controlled by a time-dependent harmonic potential and\nembedded in a medium whose temperature is tuned together with the potential\nstiffness to keep a constant effective temperature of the Brownian particle. We\nfind that the canonical distributions are usually retainable for both the\noverdamped and underdamped situations in the former case. However, the\ncanonical distributions are retainable merely for the overdamped situation in\nthe latter case. We also investigate general time-dependent potentials beyond\nthe harmonic form and find that the retainability of canonical distributions\ndepends sensitively on the specific form of potentials.\n", "  We present a new solar flux atlas with the aim to understand wavelength\nprecision and accuracy in solar benchmark data. The atlas covers the wavelength\nrange 405--2300 nm and was observed at the Institut f\\\"ur Astrophysik,\nG\\\"ottingen (IAG) with a Fourier Transform Spectrograph. In contrast to other\nFTS atlases, the entire visible wavelength range was observed simultaneously\nusing only one spectrograph setting. We compare the wavelength solution of the\nnew atlas to the Kitt Peak solar flux atlases and to the HARPS frequency-comb\ncalibrated solar atlas. Comparison reveals systematics in the two Kitt Peak FTS\natlases resulting from their wavelength scale construction, and shows\nconsistency between the IAG and the HARPS atlas. We conclude that the IAG atlas\nis precise and accurate on the order of $\\pm 10$ m s$^{-1}$ in the wavelength\nrange 405--1065 nm while the Kitt Peak atlases show deviations as large as\nseveral ten to 100 m s$^{-1}$. We determine absolute convective blueshift\nacross the spectrum from the IAG atlas and report slight differences relative\nto results from the Kitt Peak atlas that we attribute to the differences\nbetween wavelength scales. We conclude that benchmark solar data with accurate\nwavelength solution are crucial to better understand the effect of convection\non stellar RV measurements, which is one of the main limitations of Doppler\nspectroscopy at m s$^{-1}$ precision.\n", "  We merge advanced ab initio schemes (standard density functional theory,\nhybrid functionals and the GW approximation) with model Hamiltonian approaches\n(tight-binding and Heisenberg Hamiltonian) to study the evolution of the\nelectronic, magnetic and dielectric properties of the manganite family RMnO3 (R\n= La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd). The link between first principles and\ntight-binding is established by downfolding the physically relevant subset of\n3d bands with e_g character by means of maximally localized Wannier functions\n(MLWFs) using the VASP2WANNIER90 interface. The MLWFs are then used to\nconstruct a tight-binding Hamiltonian. The dispersion of the TB e_g bands at\nall levels are found to match closely the MLWFs. We provide a complete set of\nTB parameters which can serve as guidance for the interpretation of future\nstudies based on many-body Hamiltonian approaches. In particular, we find that\nthe Hund's rule coupling strength, the Jahn-Teller coupling strength, and the\nHubbard interaction parameter U remain nearly constant for all the members of\nthe RMnO3 series, whereas the nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes show a\nmonotonic attenuation as expected from the trend of the tolerance factor.\nMagnetic exchange interactions, computed by mapping a large set of hybrid\nfunctional total energies onto an Heisenberg Hamiltonian, clarify the origin of\nthe A-type magnetic ordering observed in the early rare-earth manganite series\nas arising from a net negative out-of-plane interaction energy. The obtained\nexchange parameters are used to estimate the Neel temperature by means of Monte\nCarlo simulations. The resulting data capture well the monotonic decrease of\nthe ordering temperature down the R series, in agreement with experiments.\n", "  Two new families of exact solutions to the Einstein equations for a\nconformastatic spacetime with axial symmetry are presented which describe thin\ndisks of dust immersed in a spheroidal halo. The solutions are obtained by\nexpressing the metric function in terms of an auxiliary function which\nsatisfies the Laplace equation, a characteristic property of the conformastatic\nspacetimes. The first family of solutions is obtained from the displacement,\ncut and reflexion method, which introduces a discontinuity in the first\n$z$-derivate of the metric tensor across the plane of the disk. The second\nfamily of solutions is obtained by using the oblate spheroidal coordinates\nbecause they adapt to the shape of the source and introduce naturally a cutting\nradius for the disk. The energy densities of the disk and the halo are\neverywhere positive and well behaved and their energy-momentum tensor agrees\nwith all the energy conditions. Some particular solutions for the energy\ndensity of the disk and the halo are presented and the rotational curves are\nobtained by solving the geodesic equation for a particle that moves in circular\norbits in the plane of the disk.\n", "  In this work we investigate the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nsensitivity to the velocity power spectrum in high opacity regimes of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). For our analysis we use synthetic\nPosition-Position-Velocity (PPV) cubes of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, post processed to include radiative\ntransfer effects from CO. We find that PCA analysis is very different from the\ntools based on the traditional power spectrum of PPV data cubes. Our major\nfinding is that PCA is also sensitive to the phase information of PPV cubes and\nthis allows PCA to detect the changes of the underlying velocity and density\nspectra at high opacities, where the spectral analysis of the maps provides the\nuniversal -3 spectrum in accordance with the predictions of Lazarian \\&\nPogosyan (2004) theory. This makes PCA potentially a valuable tool for studies\nof turbulence at high opacities provided that the proper gauging of the PCA\nindex is made. The later, however, we found to be not easy, as the PCA results\nchange in an irregular way for data with high sonic Mach numbers. This is in\ncontrast to synthetic Brownian noise data used for velocity and density fields\nthat show monotonic PCA behavior. We attribute this difference to the PCA's\nsensitivity to Fourier phase information.\n", "  [Abridged] Context. The young systems PZ Tel and HD 1160, hosting known\nlow-mass companions, were observed during the commissioning of the new planet\nfinder SPHERE with several imaging and spectroscopic modes. Aims. We aim to\nrefine the physical properties and architecture of both systems. Methods. We\nuse SPHERE commissioning data and REM observations, as well as literature and\nunpublished data from VLT/SINFONI, VLT/NaCo, Gemini/NICI, and Keck/NIRC2.\nResults. We derive new photometry and confirm the nearly daily photometric\nvariability of PZ Tel A. Using literature data spanning 38 yr, we show that the\nstar also exhibits a long-term variability trend. The 0.63-3.8 mic SED of PZ\nTel B allows us to revise its properties: spectral type M7+/-1, Teff=2700+/-100\nK, log(g)<4.5 dex, log(L/L_Sun)=-2.51+/-0.10 dex, and mass 38-72 MJ. The 1-3.8\nmic SED of HD 1160 B suggests a massive brown dwarf or a low-mass star with\nspectral type M5.5-7.0, Teff=3000+/-100 K, [M/H]=-0.5-0.0 dex,\nlog(L/L_Sun)=-2.81+/-0.10 dex, and mass 39-168 MJ. We confirm the deceleration\nand high eccentricity (e>0.66) of PZ Tel B. For e<0.9, the inclination,\nlongitude of the ascending node, and time of periastron passage are well\nconstrained. The system is seen close to an edge-on geometry. We reject other\nbrown dwarf candidates outside 0.25\" for both systems, and massive giant\nplanets (>4 MJ) outside 0.5\" for the PZ Tel system. We also show that K1-K2\ncolor can be used with YJH low-resolution spectra to identify young L-type\ncompanions, provided high photometric accuracy (<0.05 mag) is achieved.\nConclusions. SPHERE opens new horizons in the study of young brown dwarfs and\ngiant exoplanets thanks to high-contrast imaging capabilities at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths, as well as high signal-to-noise spectroscopy in the\nnear-infrared from low (R~30-50) to medium resolutions (R~350).\n", "  The planetary system discovered around the young A-type HR8799 provides a\nunique laboratory to: a) test planet formation theories, b) probe the diversity\nof system architectures at these separations, and c) perform comparative\n(exo)planetology. We present and exploit new near-infrared images and\nintegral-field spectra of the four gas giants surrounding HR8799 obtained with\nSPHERE, the new planet finder instrument at the Very Large Telescope, during\nthe commissioning and science verification phase of the instrument\n(July-December 2014). With these new data, we contribute to completing the\nspectral energy distribution of these bodies in the 1.0-2.5 $\\mu$m range. We\nalso provide new astrometric data, in particular for planet e, to further\nconstrain the orbits. We used the infrared dual-band imager and spectrograph\n(IRDIS) subsystem to obtain pupil-stabilized, dual-band $H2H3$ (1.593 $\\mu$m,\n1.667 $\\mu$m), $K1K2$ (2.110 $\\mu$m, 2.251 $\\mu$m), and broadband $J$ (1.245\n$\\mu$m) images of the four planets. IRDIS was operated in parallel with the\nintegral field spectrograph (IFS) of SPHERE to collect low-resolution\n($R\\sim30$), near-infrared (0.94-1.64 $\\mu$m) spectra of the two innermost\nplanets HR8799d and e. The data were reduced with dedicated algorithms, such as\nthe Karhunen-Lo\\`eve image projection (KLIP), to reveal the planets. We used\nthe so-called negative planets injection technique to extract their photometry,\nspectra, and measure their positions. We illustrate the astrometric performance\nof SPHERE through sample orbital fits compatible with SPHERE and literature\ndata.\n", "  Thermally-driven spin-transfer torques have recently been reported in\nelectrically insulating ferromagnet$|$normal-metal heterostructures. In this\npaper, we propose two physically distinct mechanisms for such torques. The\nfirst is a local effect: out-of-equilibrium, thermally-activated magnons in the\nferromagnet, driven by a spin Seebeck effect, exert a torque on the\nmagnetization via magnon-magnon scattering with coherent dynamics. The second\nis a nonlocal effect which requires an additional magnetic layer to provide the\nsymmetry breaking necessary to realize a thermal torque. The simplest structure\nin which to induce a nonlocal thermal torque is a spin valve composed of two\ninsulating magnets separated by a normal metal spacer; there, a thermal flux\ngenerates a pure spin current through the spin valve, which results in a torque\nwhen the magnetizations of the layers are misaligned.\n", "  Quantum computers are designed to outperform standard computers by running\nquantum algorithms. Areas in which quantum algorithms can be applied include\ncryptography, search and optimisation, simulation of quantum systems, and\nsolving large systems of linear equations. Here we briefly survey some known\nquantum algorithms, with an emphasis on a broad overview of their applications\nrather than their technical details. We include a discussion of recent\ndevelopments and near-term applications of quantum algorithms.\n", "  In the standard inflationary scenario, primordial perturbations are\nadiabatic. The amplitudes of most types of isocurvature perturbations are\ngenerally constrained by current data to be small. If, however, there is a\nbaryon-density perturbation that is compensated by a dark-matter perturbation\nin such a way that the total matter density is unperturbed, then this\ncompensated isocurvature perturbation (CIP) has no observable consequence in\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) at linear order in the CIP amplitude.\nHere we search for the effects of CIPs on CMB power spectra to quadratic order\nin the CIP amplitude. An analysis of the Planck temperature data leads to an\nupper bound $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2 \\leq 7.1\\times 10^{-3}$, at the 68\\% confidence\nlevel, to the variance $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2$ of the CIP amplitude. This is then\nstrengthened to $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2\\leq 5.0\\times 10^{-3}$ if Planck\nsmall-angle polarization data are included. A cosmic-variance-limited CMB\nexperiment could improve the $1\\sigma$ sensitivity to CIPs to $\\Delta^2_{\\rm\nrms} \\lesssim 9\\times 10^{-4}$. It is also found that adding CIPs to the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model can improve the fit of the observed smoothing of\nCMB acoustic peaks just as much as adding a non-standard lensing amplitude.\n", "  We report the electronic properties of superconductivity in the topological\nnodal-line semimetal PbTaSe$_2$. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements\naccompanied by band calculations confirmed the nodal-line band structure in the\nnormal state of single crystalline PbTaSe$_2$. Resistivity,\nmagnetic-susceptibility and specific heat measurements have also been performed\non high-quality single crystals. We observed upward features and large\nanisotropy in upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) measured in-plane\n(H//\\textbf{ab}) and out-plane (H//\\textbf{c}), respectively. Especially,\n$H_{c2}$ measured in H//\\textbf{ab} shows sudden upward features rather than a\nsignal of saturation in ultralow temperatures. The specific heat measurements\nunder magnetic field reveal a full superconducting gap with no gapless nodes.\nThese behaviors in this clean noncentrosymmetric superconductor is possibly\nrelated to the underlying exotic physics, providing important clue for\nrealization of topological superconductivity.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of nonequilibrium phase transitions under the\ninfluence of disorder that locally breaks the symmetry between two symmetrical\nmacroscopic absorbing states. In equilibrium systems such \"random-field\"\ndisorder destroys the phase transition in low dimensions by preventing\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, we show here that random-field\ndisorder fails to destroy the nonequilibrium phase transition of the one- and\ntwo-dimensional generalized contact process. Instead, it modifies the dynamics\nin the symmetry-broken phase. Specifically, the dynamics in the one-dimensional\ncase is described by a Sinai walk of the domain walls between two different\nabsorbing states. In the two-dimensional case, we map the dynamics onto that of\nthe well studied low-temperature random-field Ising model. We also study the\ncritical behavior of the nonequilibrium phase transition and characterize its\nuniversality class in one dimension. We support our results by large-scale\nMonte Carlo simulations, and we discuss the applicability of our theory to\nother systems.\n", "  The Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula for on-shell scattering amplitudes are\nextended off-shell. The off-shell amplitudes are M\\\"obius invariant, and have\nthe same momentum poles as the on-shell amplitudes. The same technique is also\nused to obtain off-shell massive scalar and vector boson amplitudes.\n", "  We apply the worldline formalism to amplitudes in scalar quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) involving open scalar lines, with an emphasis on their\nnon-perturbative gauge dependence. At the tree-level, we study the scalar\npropagator interacting with any number of photons in configuration space as\nwell as in momentum space. At one-loop we rederive, in an efficient way, the\noff-shell vertex in an arbitrary dimension and any covariant gauge.\nGeneralizing the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation (LKFT) for the\nnon-perturbative propagator, we find simple non-perturbative transformation\nrules for arbitrary x-space amplitudes under a change of the covariant gauge\nparameter in terms of conformal cross ratios.\n", "  (Abridged) Combining the deepest Herschel extragalactic surveys (PEP,\nGOODS-H, HerMES), and Monte Carlo mock catalogs, we explore the robustness of\ndust mass estimates based on modeling of broad band spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) with two popular approaches: Draine & Li (2007, DL07) and\na modified black body (MBB). As long as the observed SED extends to at least\n160-200 micron in the rest frame, M(dust) can be recovered with a >3 sigma\nsignificance and without the occurrence of systematics. An average offset of a\nfactor ~1.5 exists between DL07- and MBB-based dust masses, based on consistent\ndust properties. At the depth of the deepest Herschel surveys (in the GOODS-S\nfield) it is possible to retrieve dust masses with a S/N>=3 for galaxies on the\nmain sequence of star formation (MS) down to M(stars)~1e10 [M(sun)] up to z~1.\nAt higher redshift (z<=2) the same result is achieved only for objects at the\ntip of the MS or lying above it. Molecular gas masses, obtained converting\nM(dust) through the metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio delta(GDR), are\nconsistent with those based on the scaling of depletion time, and on CO\nspectroscopy. Focusing on CO-detected galaxies at z>1, the delta(GDR)\ndependence on metallicity is consistent with the local relation. We combine\nfar-IR Herschel data and sub-mm ALMA expected fluxes to study the advantages of\na full SED coverage.\n", "  We present integral field spectroscopic observations with the Potsdam Multi\nAperture Spectrophotometer of all 14 galaxies in the $z\\sim 0.1$ Lyman Alpha\nReference Sample (LARS). We produce 2D line of sight velocity maps and velocity\ndispersion maps from the Balmer $\\alpha$ (H$\\alpha$) emission in our data\ncubes. These maps trace the spectral and spatial properties of the LARS\ngalaxies' intrinsic Ly$\\alpha$ radiation field. We show our kinematic maps\nspatially registered onto the Hubble Space Telescope H$\\alpha$ and Lyman\n$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) images. Only for individual galaxies a causal connection\nbetween spatially resolved H$\\alpha$ kinematics and Ly$\\alpha$ photometry can\nbe conjectured. However, no general trend can be established for the whole\nsample. Furthermore, we compute non-parametric global kinematical statistics --\nintrinsic velocity dispersion $\\sigma_0$, shearing velocity $v_\\mathrm{shear}$,\nand the $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0$ ratio -- from our kinematic maps. In\ngeneral LARS galaxies are characterised by high intrinsic velocity dispersions\n(54\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ median) and low shearing velocities (65\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$\nmedian). $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0$ values range from 0.5 to 3.2 with an\naverage of 1.5. Noteworthy, five galaxies of the sample are dispersion\ndominated systems with $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0 <1$ and are thus\nkinematically similar to turbulent star forming galaxies seen at high redshift.\nWhen linking our kinematical statistics to the global LARS Ly$\\alpha$\nproperties, we find that dispersion dominated systems show higher Ly$\\alpha$\nequivalent widths and higher Ly$\\alpha$ escape fractions than systems with\n$v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0 > 1$. Our result indicates that turbulence in\nactively star-forming systems is causally connected to interstellar medium\nconditions that favour an escape of Ly$\\alpha$ radiation.\n", "  Recent high-resolution absorption spectroscopy on excited excitons in cuprous\noxide [Nature (London) 514, 343 (2014)] has revealed significant deviations of\ntheir spectrum from that of the ideal hydrogen-like series. Here we show that\nthe complex band dispersion of the crystal, which determines the kinetic energy\nof electrons and holes, strongly affects the exciton binding energy.\nSpecifically, we show that the nonparabolicity of the band dispersion is the\nmain cause of the deviation from the hydrogen series. Experimental data\ncollected from high-resolution absorption spectroscopy in electric fields\nvalidate the assignment of the deviation to the nonparabolicity of the band\ndispersion.\n", "  Velocity distribution functions (VDFs) that exhibit a power-law dependence on\nthe high-energy tail have been the subject of intense research by the plasma\nphysics community. Such functions, known as kappa or superthermal\ndistributions, have been found to provide a better fitting to the VDFs measured\nby spacecraft in the solar wind. One of the problems that is being addressed on\nthis new light is the temperature anisotropy of solar wind protons and\nelectrons. In the literature, the general treatment for waves excited by\n(bi-)Maxwellian plasmas is well-established. However, for kappa distributions,\nthe wave characteristics have been studied mostly for the limiting cases of\npurely parallel or perpendicular propagation, relative to the ambient magnetic\nfield. Contributions to the general case of obliquely-propagating\nelectromagnetic waves have been scarcely reported so far. The absence of a\ngeneral treatment prevents a complete analysis of the wave-particle interaction\nin kappa plasmas, since some instabilities can operate simultaneously both in\nthe parallel and oblique directions. In a recent work, Gaelzer and Ziebell [J.\nGeophys. Res. 119, 9334 (2014)] obtained expressions for the dielectric tensor\nand dispersion relations for the low-frequency, quasi-perpendicular dispersive\nAlfv\\'en waves resulting from a kappa VDF. In the present work, the formalism\nintroduced by Ref. 1 is generalized for the general case of electrostatic\nand/or electromagnetic waves propagating in a kappa plasma in any frequency\nrange and for arbitrary angles. An isotropic distribution is considered, but\nthe methods used here can be easily applied to more general anisotropic\ndistributions, such as the bi-kappa or product-bi-kappa.\n", "  We present an investigation of spinning black holes in\nEinstein--Gauss-Bonnet--dilaton (EGBd) theory. The solutions are found within a\nnon-perturbative approach, by directly solving the field equations. These\nstationary axially symmetric black holes are asymptotically flat. They possess\na non-trivial scalar field outside their regular event horizon. We present an\noverview of the parameter space of the solutions together with a study of their\nbasic properties. We point out that the EGBd black holes can exhibit some\nphysical differences when compared to the Kerr solution. For example, their\nmass is always bounded from below, while their angular momentum can exceed the\nKerr bound, Also, in contrast to the Kerr case, the extremal solutions are\nsingular, with the scalar field diverging on the horizon.\n", "  A search is presented for a new, light boson with a mass of about 1 GeV and\ndecaying promptly to jets of collimated electrons and/or muons (lepton-jets).\nThe analysis is performed with 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton--proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Events are required to contain at least two\nlepton-jets. This study finds no statistically significant deviation from\npredictions of the Standard Model and places 95\\% confidence-level upper limits\non the contribution of new phenomena beyond the SM, incuding SUSY-portal and\nHiggs-portal models, on the number of events with lepton-jets.\n", "  A graph state and a graph code respectively are defined based on a\nmathematical simple graph. In this work, we examine a relation between a graph\nstate and a graph code both obtained from the same graph, and show that a graph\nstate is a superposition of logical qubits of the related graph code. By using\nthe relation, we first discuss that a local complementation which has been used\nfor a graph state can be useful for searching locally equivalent stabilizer\ncodes, and second provide a method to find a stabilizer group of a graph code.\n", "  By making use of the variational tricomplex, a covariant procedure is\nproposed for deriving the classical BRST charge of the BFV formalism from a\ngiven BV master action.\n", "  We propose to demonstrate nonreciprocal conversion between microwave and\noptical photons in an electro-optomechanical system where a microwave mode and\nan optical mode are coupled indirectly via two non-degenerate mechanical modes.\nThe nonreciprocal conversion is obtained in the broken time-reversal symmetry\nregime, where the conversion of photons from one frequency to the other is\nenhanced for constructive quantum interference while the conversion in the\nreversal direction is suppressed due to destructive quantum interference. It is\ninteresting that the nonreciprocal response between the microwave and optical\nmodes in the electro-optomechanical system appears at two different frequencies\nwith opposite directions. The proposal can be used to realize nonreciprocal\nconversion between photons of any two distinctive modes with different\nfrequencies. Moreover, the electro-optomechanical system can also be used to\nconstruct a three-port circulator for three optical modes with distinctively\ndifferent frequencies by adding an auxiliary optical mode coupled to one of the\nmechanical modes.\n", "  The classical ground states of the SU(4) Heisenberg model on the face\ncentered cubic lattice constitute a highly degenerate manifold. We explicitly\nconstruct all the classical ground states of the model. To describe quantum\nfluctuations above these classical states, we apply linear flavor-wave theory.\nAt zero temperature, the bosonic flavor waves select the simplest of these\nSU(4) symmetry breaking states, the four-sublattice ordered state defined by\nthe cubic unit cell of the fcc lattice. Due to geometrical constraints, flavor\nwaves interact along specific planes only, thus rendering the system\neffectively two dimensional and forbidding ordering at finite temperatures. We\nargue that longer range interactions generated by quantum fluctuations can\nshift the transition to finite temperatures.\n", "  Modified gravity theories often contain a scalar field of gravitational\nstrength which interacts with matter. We examine constraints on the range and\nthe coupling strength of a scalar gravitational degree of freedom using a\nsubset of current data that can be safely analyzed within the linear\nperturbation theory. Using a model-independent implementation of scalar-tensor\ntheories in MGCAMB in terms of two functions of the scale factor describing the\nmass and the coupling of the scalar degree of freedom, we derive constraints on\nthe $f(R)$, generalized chameleon, Symmetron and Dilaton models. Since most of\nthe large scale structure data available today is from relatively low\nredshifts, only a limited range of observed scales is in the linear regime,\nleading to relatively weak constraints. We then perform a forecast for a future\nlarge scale structure survey, such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),\nwhich will map a significant volume at higher redshifts, and show that it will\nproduce much stronger constraints on scalar interactions in specific models. We\nalso perform a principal component analysis and find that future surveys should\nbe able to provide tight constraints on several eigenmodes of the scalar mass\nevolution.\n", "  The cosmic web defines the large scale distribution of matter we see in the\nUniverse today. Classifying the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments and\nnodes allows one to explore structure formation and the role environmental\nfactors have on halo and galaxy properties. While existing studies of cosmic\nweb classification concentrate on grid based methods, this work explores a\nLagrangian approach where the V-web algorithm proposed by Hoffman et al. (2012)\nis implemented with techniques borrowed from smoothed particle hydrodynamics.\nThe Lagrangian approach allows one to classify individual objects (e.g.\nparticles or halos) based on properties of their nearest neighbours in an\nadaptive manner. It can be applied directly to a halo sample which dramatically\nreduces computational cost and potentially allows an application of this\nclassification scheme to observed galaxy samples. Finally, the Lagrangian\nnature admits a straight forward inclusion of the Hubble flow negating the\nnecessity of a visually defined threshold value which is commonly employed by\ngrid based classification methods.\n", "  We derive composite pulse sequences that achieve high-fidelity excitation of\ntwo-state systems in an optically dense, inhomogeneously broadened ensemble.\nThe composite pulses are resistant to distortions due to the back-action of the\nmedium they propagate in and are able to create high-fidelity inversion to\noptical depths $\\alpha z>10$. They function well with smooth pulse shapes used\nfor coherent control of optical atomic transitions in quantum computation and\ncommunication. They are an intermediary solution between single $\\pi$-pulse\nexcitation schemes and adiabatic passage schemes, being far more error tolerant\nthan the former but still considerably faster than the latter.\n", "  The recent observation of very high energy cosmic neutrinos by IceCube\nheralds the beginning of neutrino astronomy. At these energies, the dominant\nbackground to the astrophysical signal is the flux of `prompt' neutrinos,\narising from the decay of charmed mesons produced by cosmic ray collisions in\nthe atmosphere. In this work we provide predictions for the prompt atmospheric\nneutrino flux in the framework of perturbative QCD, using state-of-the-art\nMonte Carlo event generators. Our calculation includes the constraints set by\ncharm production measurements from the LHCb experiment at 7 TeV, and has been\nrecently validated with the corresponding 13 TeV data. Our results for the\nprompt flux are a factor of about 2 below the previous benchmark calculation,\nin general agreement with two other recent estimates, and with an improved\nestimate of the uncertainty. This alleviates the existing tension between the\ntheoretical prediction and IceCube limits, and suggests that a direct direction\nof the prompt flux is imminent.\n", "  Filaments play a central role in the molecular clouds' evolution, but their\ninternal dynamical properties remain poorly characterized. To further explore\nthe physical state of these structures, we have investigated the kinematic\nproperties of the Musca cloud. We have sampled the main axis of this\nfilamentary cloud in $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2--1) lines using APEX\nobservations. The different line profiles in Musca shows that this cloud\npresents a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its $\\sim$6.5 pc of\nlength. With an internal gas kinematics dominated by thermal motions (i.e.,\n$\\sigma_{NT}/c_s\\lesssim1$) and large-scale velocity gradients, these results\nreveal Musca as the longest velocity-coherent, sonic-like object identified so\nfar in the ISM. The transonic properties of Musca present a clear departure\nfrom the predicted supersonic velocity dispersions expected in the Larson's\nvelocity dispersion-size relationship, and constitute the first observational\nevidence of a filament fully decoupled from the turbulent regime over\nmulti-parsec scales.\n", "  We study the link between atomic motion and exciton transport in flexible\nRydberg aggregates, assemblies of highly excited light alkali atoms, for which\nmotion due to dipole-dipole interaction becomes relevant. In two\none-dimensional atom chains crossing at a right angle adiabatic exciton\ntransport is affected by a conical intersection of excitonic energy surfaces,\nwhich induces controllable non-adiabatic effects. A joint exciton/motion pulse\nthat is initially governed by a single energy surface is coherently split into\ntwo modes after crossing the intersection. The modes induce strongly different\natomic motion, leading to clear signatures of non-adiabatic effects in atomic\ndensity profiles. We have shown how this scenario can be exploited as an\nexciton switch, controlling direction and coherence properties of the joint\npulse on the second of the chains [K.~Leonhardt {\\it et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.\n{\\bf 113} 223001 (2014)]. In this article we discuss the underlying complex\ndynamics in detail, characterise the switch and derive our isotropic\ninteraction model from a realistic anisotropic one with the addition of a\nmagnetic bias field.\n", "  This paper develops constraints on the values of the fundamental constants\nthat allow universes to be habitable. We focus on the fine structure constant\n$\\alpha$ and the gravitational structure constant $\\alpha_G$, and find the\nregion in the $\\alpha$-$\\alpha_G$ plane that supports working stars and\nhabitable planets. This work is motivated, in part, by the possibility that\ndifferent versions of the laws of physics could be realized within other\nuniverses. The following constraints are enforced: [A] long-lived stable\nnuclear burning stars exist, [B] planetary surface temperatures are hot enough\nto support chemical reactions, [C] stellar lifetimes are long enough to allow\nbiological evolution, [D] planets are massive enough to maintain atmospheres,\n[E] planets are small enough in mass to remain non-degenerate, [F] planets are\nmassive enough to support sufficiently complex biospheres, [G] planets are\nsmaller in mass than their host stars, and [H] stars are smaller in mass than\ntheir host galaxies. This paper delineates the portion of the\n$\\alpha$-$\\alpha_G$ plane that satisfies all of these constraints. The results\nindicate that viable universes --- with working stars and habitable planets ---\ncan exist within a parameter space where the structure constants $\\alpha$ and\n$\\alpha_G$ vary by several orders of magnitude. These constraints also provide\nupper bounds on the structure constants ($\\alpha,\\alpha_G$) and their ratio. We\nfind the limit $\\alpha_G/\\alpha<10^{-34}$, which shows that habitable universes\nmust have a large hierarchy between the strengths of the gravitational force\nand the electromagnetic force.\n", "  How to obtain germanene with Dirac electrons preserved is still an open\nchallenge. Here we report a sandwich-dehydrogenation approach, i.e., to\nfabricate germanene through dehydrogenating germanane in a sandwiched\nstructure. The dehydrogenation can spontaneously occur for the sandwiched\nstructure, which overcomes the problem of amorphization in the heating\ndehydrogenation approach. The obtained germanene preserve the Dirac electronic\nproperties very well. Moreover, the Fermi velocity of germanene can be\nefficiently manipulated through controlling the interlayer spacing between\ngermanane and the sandwiching surfaces. Our results indicate a guideline for\nfabrication of prefect two-dimensional materials.\n", "  We analyze the three-point vertex function that describes the coupling of\nfermionic particle-hole pairs in a metal to spin or charge fluctuations at\nnon-zero momentum. We consider Ward identities, which connect two-particle\nvertex functions to the self energy, in the framework of a Hubbard model. These\nare derived using conservation laws following from local symmetries. The\ngenerators considered are the spin density and particle density. It is shown\nthat at certain antiferromagnetic critical points, where the quasiparticle\neffective mass is diverging, the vertex function describing the coupling of\nparticle-hole pairs to the spin density Fourier component at the\nantiferromagnetic wavevector is also divergent. Then we give an explicit\ncalculation of the irreducible vertex function for the case of\nthree-dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations, and show that it is\nproportional to the diverging quasiparticle effective mass .\n", "  The density and isospin dependences of the nonrelativistic nucleon effective\nmass ($m^*$) are studied, which is a measure of the nonlocality of the single\nparticle (s.p.) potential. We decouple it further into the so called k-mass\n($m^*_k$, i.e., the nonlocality in space) and E-mass ($m^*_E$, i.e., the\nnonlocality in time). Both masses are determined and compared from the latest\nversions of the nonrelativistic Brueckner-Hartree Fock (BHF) model and the\nrelativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) model. The latter are achieved based on the\ncorresponding Schr\\\"{o}dinger equivalent s.p. potential in a relativistic\nframework. We demonstrate the origins of different effective masses and discuss\nalso their neutron-proton splitting in the asymmetric matter in different\nmodels. We find that the neutron-proton splittings of both the k-mass and the\nE-mass have the same asymmetry dependences at considered densities, namely\n$m^*_{k,n} > m^*_{k,p}$ and $m^*_{E,p} > m^*_{E,n}$. However, the resulting\nsplittings of nucleon effective masses could have different asymmetry\ndependences in the two models, because they could be dominated either by that\nof the k-mass (then we have $m^*_n > m^*_p$ in the BHF model) or by that of the\nE-mass (then we have $m^*_p > m^*_n$ in the RHF model).\n", "  An equation for a viscous incompressible fluid on a spheroidal surface which\nis dual to the perturbation around the near-near horizon extreme Kerr (n-NHEK)\nblack hole is derived. It is also shown that an expansion scalar $\\theta$ of a\ncongruence of null geodesics on the null horizon of the perturbed n-NHEK\nspacetime, which is dual to a viscous incompressible fluid, is not positive\nsemi-definite, even if initial conditions on the velocity are smooth. Unless\ninitial conditions are elaborated, caustics of null congruence will occur on\nthe horizon in the future. A similar result is obtained for a perturbed\nSchwarzschild black hole spacetime which is dual to a viscous incompressible\nfluid on $S^2$. An initial condition that $\\theta$ be positive semi-definite at\nany point on $S^2$ is a necessary condition for the existence of smooth\nsolutions to incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equation on $S^2$.\n", "  This work studies universal finite size scaling functions for the number of\n1d spanning avalanches in a two-dimensional disordered system with boundary\nconditions of different nature and different aspect ratios. For this purpose,\nwe consider the 2d Random Field Ising Model at T = 0 driven by the external\nfield H with athermal dynamics implemented with periodic and forced boundary\nconditions. We choose a convenient scaling variable z that accounts for the\ndeformation of the distance to the critical point caused by the aspect ratio.\nMoreover, assuming that the dependence of the finite size scaling functions on\nthe aspect ratio can be accounted by an additional multiplicative factor, we\nhave been able to collapse data for different system sizes, different aspect\nratios and different nature of the boundary conditions into a single scaling\nfunction Q.\n", "  The detailed composition of most metal-poor halo stars has been found to be\nvery uniform. However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing\nmetallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the\nso-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic\nchemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects\nthat of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer\nof chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should\nthen all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency\nand orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without\nover-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,\nrespectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper\ndiscusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider\na similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically\nsignificant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,\nwhile four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and\nnormal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single\nstars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the\nbinaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the\nnucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these\nancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on\ntheir natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier,\nexternal source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona\nfide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon\nand its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and\nimplications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems. Abridged.\n", "  We examine subhaloes and galaxies residing in a simulated LCDM galaxy cluster\n($M^{\\rm crit}_{200}=1.1\\times10^{15}M_\\odot/h$) produced by hydrodynamical\ncodes ranging from classic Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), newer SPH\ncodes, adaptive and moving mesh codes. These codes use subgrid models to\ncapture galaxy formation physics. We compare how well these codes reproduce the\nsame subhaloes/galaxies in gravity only, non-radiative hydrodynamics and full\nfeedback physics runs by looking at the overall subhalo/galaxy distribution and\non an individual objects basis. We find the subhalo population is reproduced to\nwithin $\\lesssim10\\%$ for both dark matter only and non-radiative runs, with\nindividual objects showing code-to-code scatter of $\\lesssim0.1$ dex, although\nthe gas in non-radiative simulations shows significant scatter. Including\nfeedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and\n$V_{max}$ distributions vary by $\\approx20\\%$. The galaxy populations also show\nstriking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar\nin almost all codes, the number of galaxies with $10^{9}M_\\odot/h\\lesssim\nM_*\\lesssim 10^{12}M_\\odot/h$ can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies\nshow code-to-code scatter of $\\sim0.5$ dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong\nsystematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies $70\\%$ smaller\nthan others. The diversity partially arises from the inclusion/absence of AGN\nfeedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that\nsubgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of\nbuilding galaxies in all environments remains a challenge. We argue even basic\ngalaxy properties, such as the stellar mass to halo mass, should be treated\nwith errors bars of $\\sim0.2-0.4$ dex.\n", "  The packing of hard spheres (HS) of diameter $\\sigma$ in a cylinder has been\nused to model experimental systems, such as fullerenes in nanotubes and\ncolloidal wire assembly. Finding the densest packings of HS under this type of\nconfinement, however, grows increasingly complex with the cylinder diameter,\n$D$. Little is thus known about the densest achievable packings for\n$D>2.873\\sigma$. In this work, we extend the identification of the packings up\nto $D=4.00\\sigma$ by adapting Torquato-Jiao's adaptive-shrinking-cell\nformulation and sequential-linear-programming (SLP) technique. We identify 17\nnew structures, almost all of them chiral. Beyond $D\\approx2.85\\sigma$, most of\nthe structures consist of an outer shell and an inner core that compete for\nbeing close packed. In some cases, the shell adopts its own maximum density\nconfiguration, and the stacking of core spheres within it is quasiperiodic. In\nother cases, an interplay between the two components is observed, which may\nresult in simple periodic structures. In yet other cases, the very distinction\nbetween core and shell vanishes, resulting in more exotic packing geometries,\nincluding some that are three-dimensional extensions of structures obtained\nfrom packing hard disks in a circle.\n", "  We report on ballistic transport over more than 28 \\mu m in graphene grown by\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) that is fully encapsulated in hexagonal boron\nnitride. The structures are fabricated by an advanced dry van-der-Waals\ntransfer method and exhibit carrier mobilities of up to three million\ncm$^2$/(Vs). The ballistic nature of charge transport is probed by measuring\nthe bend resistance in cross- and square-shaped devices. Temperature dependent\nmeasurements furthermore prove that ballistic transport is maintained exceeding\n1 \\mu m up to 200 K.\n", "  We present a magneto-Raman study on high-quality single-layer graphene grown\nby chemical vapor deposition (CVD) that is fully encapsulated in hexagonal\nboron nitride by a dry transfer technique. By analyzing the Raman D, G, and 2D\npeaks, we find that the structural quality of the samples is comparable to\nstate-of-the-art exfoliated graphene flakes. From B field dependent Raman\nmeasurements, we extract the broadening and associated lifetime of the G peak\ndue to anharmonic effects. Furthermore, we determine the decay width and\nlifetime of Landau level (LL) transitions from magneto-phonon resonances as a\nfunction of laser power. At low laser power, we find a minimal decay width of\n140 1/cm highlighting the high electronic quality of the CVD-grown graphene. At\nhigher laser power, we observe an increase of the LL decay width leading to a\nsaturation with the corresponding lifetime saturating at a minimal value of 18\nfs.\n", "  Recent discoveries on topological characterization of gapless systems have\nattracted interest in both theoretical studies and experimental realizations.\nExamples of such gapless topological phases are Weyl semimetals, which exhibit\n3D Dirac cones (Weyl points), and nodal line semimetals, which are\ncharacterized by line nodes (two bands touching along a line). Inspired by our\nprevious discoveries that the kicked Harper model exhibits many fascinating\nfeatures of Floquet topological phases, in this manuscript we consider a\ngeneralization of the model, where two additional periodic system parameters\nare introduced into the Hamiltonian to serve as artificial dimensions, so as to\nsimulate a 3D system. We observe that by increasing the hopping strength and\nthe kicking strength of the system, many new band touching points at Floquet\nquasienergies $0$ and $\\pi$ will start to appear. Some of them are Weyl points,\nwhile the others form line nodes in the parameter space. By taking open\nboundary conditions along the physical dimension, edge states analogues to\nFermi arcs in static Weyl semimetal systems are observed. Finally, by designing\nan adiabatic pumping scheme, the chirality of the Weyl points and the $\\pi$\nBerry phase around line nodes can be manifested.\n", "  We derive the limiting form of graviton radiation in gravitational scattering\nat transplanckian energies ($E\\gg M_P$) and small deflection angles. We show\nthat --- owing to the graviton's spin 2 --- such limiting form unifies the\nsoft- and Regge- regimes of emission, by covering a broad angular range, from\nforward fragmentation to deeply central region. The single-exchange emission\namplitudes have a nice expression in terms of the transformation phases of\nhelicity amplitudes under rotations. As a result, the multiple-exchange\nemission amplitudes can be resummed via an impact parameter $b$-space\nfactorization theorem that takes into account all coherence effects. We then\nsee the emergence of an energy spectrum of the emitted radiation which, being\ntuned on $\\hbar/R \\sim M_P^2/E \\ll M_P$, is reminiscent of Hawking's radiation.\nSuch a spectrum is much softer than the one na\\\"ively expected for increasing\ninput energies and neatly solves a potential energy crisis. Furthermore, by\nincluding rescattering corrections in the (quantum) factorization formula, we\nare able to recover the classical limit and to find the corresponding quantum\ncorrections. Perspectives for the extrapolation of such limiting radiation\ntowards the classical collapse regime (where $b$ is of the order of the\ngravitational radius $R$) are also discussed.\n", "  Context. Known TeV sources detected by major Cerenkov telescopes are\ninvestigated to identify possible MeV-GeV gamma-ray counterparts. Aims. A\nsystematic study of the known sources in the web-based TeVCat Catalog has been\nperformed to search for possible gamma-ray counterpart on the AGILE data\ncollected during the first period of operations in observing pointing mode.\nMethods. For each TeV source, a search for a possible gamma-ray counterpart\nbased on a multi-source Maximum Likelihood algorithm is performed on the AGILE\ndata taken with the GRID instrument from July 2007 to October 2009. Results. In\ncase of high-significance detection, the average gamma-ray flux is estimated.\nFor the cases of low-significance detection the 95 % Confidence Level (C.L.)\nflux upper limit is given. 52 TeV sources out of 152 (corresponding to ~34 % of\nthe analysed sample) show a significant excess in the AGILE data covering the\npointing observation period. Conclusions. This analysis found 26 new AGILE\nsources with respect to the AGILE reference catalogs, 15 of which are Galactic,\n7 are extragalactic and 4 are unidentified. Detailed tables with all available\ninformation on the analysed sources are presented.\n", "  We investigate the impact of unquenching effects on QCD Green's functions, in\nthe form of quark-loop contributions to both the gluon propagator and\nthree-gluon vertex, in a three-loop inspired truncation of the three-particle\nirreducible (3PI) effective action. The fully coupled system of Dyson-Schwinger\nequations for the quark-gluon-, ghost-gluon- and three-gluon vertices, together\nwith the quark propagator, are solved self-consistently; our only input are the\nghost and gluon propagators themselves that are constrained by calculations\nwithin Lattice QCD. We find that the two different unquenching effects have\nroughly equal, but opposite, impact on the quark-gluon vertex and quark\npropagator, with an overall negative impact on the latter. By taking further\nderivatives of the 3PI effective action, we construct the corresponding\nquark-antiquark kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for mesons. The leading\ncomponent is gluon exchange between two fully-dressed quark-gluon vertices,\nthus introducing for the first time an obvious scalar-scalar component to the\nbinding. We gain access to time-like properties of bound-states by analytically\ncontinuing the coupled system of Dyson--Schwinger equations to the complex\nplane. We observe that the vector axial-vector splitting is in accord with\nexperiment and that the lightest quark-antiquark scalar meson is above 1 GeV in\nmass.\n", "  We provide a detailed analysis of how bosonic dark matter \"condensates\"\ninteract with compact stars, extending significantly the results of a recent\nLetter. We focus on bosonic fields with mass $m_B$, such as axions, axion-like\ncandidates and hidden photons. Self-gravitating bosonic fields generically form\n\"breathing\" configurations, where both the spacetime geometry and the field\noscillate, and can interact and cluster at the center of stars. We construct\nstellar configurations formed by a perfect fluid and a bosonic condensate, and\nwhich may describe the late stages of dark-matter accretion onto stars, in dark\nmatter-rich environments. These composite stars oscillate at a frequency which\nis a multiple of $f=2.5\\times 10^{14}\\,\\left(m_{B}c^2/eV\\right)\\,{\\rm Hz}$.\nUsing perturbative analysis and Numerical Relativity techniques, we show that\nthese stars are generically stable, and we provide criteria for instability.\nOur results also indicate that the growth of the dark matter core is halted\nclose to the Chandrasekhar limit. We thus dispel a myth concerning dark matter\naccretion by stars: dark mater accretion does not necessarily lead to the\ndestruction of the star, nor to collapse to a black hole. Finally, we argue\nthat stars with long-lived bosonic cores may also develop in other theories\nwith effective mass couplings, such as (massless) scalar-tensor theories.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of scalar waves induced by matter sources in\nthe context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity which include screening\nmechanisms for the scalar degree of freedom. The usual approach when studying\nthese theories in the non-linear regime of cosmological perturbations is based\non the assumption that scalar waves travel at the speed of light. Within\nGeneral Relativity such approximation is good and leads to no loss of accuracy\nin the estimation of observables. We find, however, that mass terms and\nnon-linearities in the equations of motion lead to propagation and dispersion\nvelocities significantly different from the speed of light. As the group\nvelocity is the one associated to the propagation of signals, a reduction of\nits value has direct impact on the behavior and dynamics of nonlinear\nstructures within modified gravity theories with screening. For instance, the\ninternal dynamics of galaxies and satellites submerged in large dark matter\nhalos could be affected by the fact that the group velocity is smaller than the\nspeed of light. It is therefore important, within such framework, to take into\naccount the fact that different part of a galaxy will see changes in the\nenvironment at different times. A full non-static analysis may be necessary\nunder those conditions.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a selective sampling procedure to preferentially\nevaluate a potential energy surface (PES) in a part of the configuration space\ngoverning a physical property of interest. The proposed sampling procedure is\nbased on a machine learning method called the Gaussian process (GP), which is\nused to construct a statistical model of the PES for identifying the region of\ninterest in the configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed procedure for atomic diffusion and ionic conduction, specifically the\nproton conduction in a well-studied proton-conducting oxide, barium zirconate\nBaZrO3. The results of the demonstration study indicate that our procedure can\nefficiently identify the low-energy region characterizing the proton conduction\nin the host crystal lattice, and that the descriptors used for the statistical\nPES model have a great influence on the performance.\n", "  We consider the interaction of hydrogen-like atoms with a strong laser field\nand show that the strong field approximation and all its variants may be\ngrouped into a set of families of approximation schemes. This is done by\nintroducing an ansatz describing the electron wave packet as the sum of the\ninitial state wave function times a phase factor and a function which is the\nperturbative solution in the Coulomb potential of an inhomogeneous\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. It is the phase factor that\ncharacterizes a given family. In each of these families, the velocity and\nlength gauge version of the approximation scheme lead to the same results at\neach order in the Coulomb potential. By contrast, irrespective of the gauge,\napproximation schemes belonging to different families give different results.\nFurthermore, this new formulation of the strong field approximations allows us\nto gain deeper insight into the validity of the strong field approximation\nschemes. In particular, we address two important questions: the role of the\nCoulomb potential in the output channel and the convergence of the perturbative\nseries in the Coulomb potential. In all the physical situations we consider\nhere, our results are compared to those obtained by solving numerically the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  Hydrogen embrittlement of metals is widely observed, but its atomistic\norigins remain little understood and much debated. Combining a unique\nidentification of interstitial sites through polyhedral tessellation and\nfirst-principles calculations, we study hydrogen adsorption at grain boundaries\nin a variety of face-centered cubic metals of Ni, Cu, gamma-Fe and Pd. We\ndiscover the chemomechanical origin of variation of adsorption energetics for\ninterstitial hydrogen at grain boundaries. A general chemomechanical formula is\nestablished to provide accurate assessments of hydrogen trapping and\nsegregation energetics at grain boundaries, and it also offers direct\nexplanations for certain experimental observations. The present study deepens\nour mechanistic understanding of the role of grain boundaries in hydrogen\nembrittlement, and promises a viable path towards predictive microstructure\nengineering against hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals.\n", "  The rotational instability of the electric polarization P during phase\ntransformations between ferroelectric phases is of great practical interest,\nsince it may be accompanied by extremely large values of the piezoelectric\ncoefficient, and a divergence of the coupled shear compliance contributes to\nsuch enhancements. In the literature, this had been explicitly calculated in\nthe framework of the Landau theory and discussed with specific numerical\nsimulations involving tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral ferroelectric\nphases. When monoclinic phases are involved, such an approach is practically\nimpossible, and an approximated treatment had been proposed, based on the\nobservation that in those cases there are shear strains almost linearly coupled\nto the transverse component of P, implying a divergence of the Curie-Weiss type\nin the associated compliances. Here the argument is extended to the general\ncase of transitions whose major effect is a rotation of the polarization, and\nthe limits of its validity are discussed. As experimental verification, the\nelastic response of BaTiO3 is measured and analyzed, together with those of\nother ferroelectric perovskites available in the literature, like KNN.\n", "  A search for narrow resonances in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV is presented. The invariant mass distribution of the two leading jets is\nmeasured with the CMS detector using a data set corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.4 inverse femtobarns. The highest observed dijet mass is 6.1\nTeV. The distribution is smooth and no evidence for resonant particles is\nobserved. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross\nsection for narrow resonances with masses above 1.5 TeV. When interpreted in\nthe context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with\nmasses below 7.0 TeV, scalar diquarks below 6.0 TeV, axigluons and colorons\nbelow 5.1 TeV, excited quarks below 5.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.1 TeV,\nand W' bosons below 2.6 TeV. These results significantly extend previously\npublished limits.\n", "  We study the effect of dipolar interactions on the level of squeezing in\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates by using the single mode approximation. We\nlimit our consideration to the $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie subalgebra spanned by\nspin operators. The biaxial nature of dipolar interactions allows for dynamical\ngeneration of spin-squeezed states in the system. We analyze the phase\nportraits in the reduced mean-filed space in order to determine positions of\nunstable fixed points. We calculate numerically spin squeezing parameter\nshowing that it is possible to reach the strongest squeezing set by the\ntwo-axis countertwisting model. We partially explain scaling with the system\nsize by using the Gaussian approach and the frozen spin approximation.\n", "  We investigate the stability of a free scalar field nonminimally coupled to\ngravity under linear perturbations in the spacetime of a charged spherical\nshell. Our analysis is performed in the context of quantum field theory in\ncurved spacetimes. This paper completes previous analyses which considered the\nexponential enhancement of vacuum fluctuations in the spacetime of massive\nshells.\n", "  We present observations of CK Vul obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThe infrared spectrum reveals a warm dust continuum with nebular, molecular\nhydrogen and HCN lines superimposed, together with the \"Unidentified Infrared\"\n(UIR) features. The nebular lines are consistent with emission by a low density\ngas. We conclude that the Spitzer data, combined with other information, are\nincompatible with CK Vul being a classical nova remnant in \"hibernation\" after\nthe event of 1670, a \"Very Late Thermal Pulse\", a \"Luminous Red Variable\" such\nas V838 Mon, or a \"Diffusion-induced nova\". The true nature of CK Vul remains a\nmystery.\n", "  The latest data released by the BaBar Collaboration on azimuthal correlations\nmeasured for pion-kaon and kaon-kaon pairs produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilations\nallow, for the first time, a direct extraction of the kaon Collins functions.\nThese functions are then used to compute the kaon Collins asymmetries in Semi\nInclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering processes, which result in good agreement\nwith the measurements performed by the HERMES and COMPASS Collaborations.\n", "  Detection of ~ 0.1-70 GeV prompt gamma-ray emission from the exceptionally\nbright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 130427A by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope provides\nan opportunity to explore the physical processes of GeV gamma-ray emission from\nthe GRB jets. In this work we discuss interactions of Iron and Oxygen nuclei\nwith observed keV-MeV photons in the jet of GRB 130427A in order to explain an\nadditional, hard spectral component observed during 11.5-33 second after\ntrigger. The photodisintegration time scale for Iron nuclei is comparable to or\nshorter than this duration. We find that gamma rays resulting from the Iron\nnuclei disintegration can account for the hard power-law component of the\nspectra in the 1-70 GeV range, before the gamma-gamma to electron-positron pair\nproduction with low-energy photons severely attenuates emission of higher\nenergy photons. Electron antineutrinos from the secondary neutron decay, on the\nother hand, can be emitted with energies up to 2 TeV. The flux of these\nneutrinos is low and consistent with non-detection of GRB 130427A by the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory. The required total energy in the Iron nuclei for\nthis hadronic model for GeV emission is approximately 10 times the observed\ntotal energy released in the prompt keV-MeV emission.\n", "  We report an investigation of the superconducting order parameter of the\nnoncentrosymmetric compound PbTaSe$_2$, which is believed to have a\ntopologically nontrivial band structure. Precise measurements of the London\npenetration depth $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$ obtained using a tunnel diode oscillator\n(TDO) based method show an exponential temperature dependence at $T\\ll T_c$,\nsuggesting a nodeless superconducting gap structure. A single band s-wave model\nwell describes the corresponding normalized superfluid density, with a gap\nmagnitude of $\\Delta(0)=1.85T_c$. This is very close to the value of $1.76T_c$\nfor weak-coupling BCS superconductors, indicating conventional fully-gapped\nsuperconductivity in PbTaSe$_2$.\n", "  The current-current correlation function is a useful concept in the theory of\nelectron transport in homogeneous solids. The finite-temperature conductivity\ntensor as well as Anderson's localization length can be computed entirely from\nthis correlation function. Based on the critical behavior of these two physical\nquantities near the plateau-insulator or plateau-plateau transitions in the\ninteger quantum Hall effect, we derive an asymptotic formula for the\ncurrent-current correlation function, which enables us to make several\ntheoretical predictions about its generic behavior. For the disordered\nHofstadter model, we employ numerical simulations to map the current-current\ncorrelation function, obtain its asymptotic form near a critical point and\nconfirm the theoretical predictions.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the annihilation signals of the inert dark\nmatter doublet model in its high mass regime. Concretely, we study the\nprospects to observe gamma-ray signals of the model in current and projected\nCherenkov telescopes taking into account the Sommerfeld effect and including\nthe contribution to the spectrum from gamma-ray lines as well as from internal\nbremsstrahlung. We show that present observations of the galactic center by the\nH.E.S.S. instrument are able to exclude regions of the parameter space that\ngive the correct dark matter relic abundance. In particular, models with the\ncharged and the neutral components of the inert doublet nearly degenerate in\nmass have strong gamma-ray signals. Furthermore, for dark matter particle\nmasses above 1 TeV, we find that the non-observation of the continuum of\nphotons generated by the hadronization of the annihilation products typically\ngive stronger constraints on the model parameters than the sharp spectral\nfeatures associated to annihilation into monochromatic photons and the internal\nbremsstrahlung process. Lastly, we also analyze the interplay between indirect\nand direct detection searches for this model, concluding that the prospects for\nthe former are more promising. In particular, we find that the upcoming\nCherenkov Telescope Array will be able to probe a significant part of the high\nmass regime of the model.\n", "  We report families of two-dimensional (2D) composite solitons in spinor\ndipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, with two localized components linearly mixed\nby the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and the intrinsic nonlinearity represented by\nthe dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between atomic magnetic moments polarized\nin-plane by an external magnetic field. Recently, stable solitons were\npredicted in the form of \\textit{semi-vortices} (composites built of coupled\nfundamental and vortical components) in the 2D system combining the SOC and\ncontact attractive interactions. Replacing the latter by the anisotropic\nlong-range DDI, we demonstrate that, for a fixed norm of the soliton, the\nsystem supports a \\emph{continuous family} of stable spatially asymmetric\nvortex solitons (AVSs), parameterized by an offset of the pivot of the vortical\ncomponent relative to its fundamental counterpart. The offset is limited by a\ncertain maximum value, while the energy of the AVS practically does not depend\non the offset. At small values of the norm, the vortex solitons are subject to\na weak oscillatory instability. In the present system, with the Galilean\ninvariance broken by the SOC, the composite solitons are set in motion by a\nkick whose strength exceeds a certain depinning value. The kicked solitons\nfeature a negative effective mass, drifting along a spiral trajectory opposite\nto the direction of the kick. A critical angular velocity, up to which the\nsemi-vortices may follow rotation of the polarizing magnetic field, is found\ntoo.\n", "  We present our numerical study of three-dimensional QED with 2, 4, 6 and 8\nflavors of massless two-component fermions using a parity-preserving lattice\nregularization with Wilson fermions. We study the behavior of low-lying\neigenvalues of the massless improved Wilson-Dirac operator as a function of\nthree-dimensional physical volume, after taking the continuum limit at fixed\nphysical volumes. We find the following evidences against the presence of\nbilinear condensate: the eigenvalues do not scale as the inverse of the\nthree-dimensional physical volume, and the number variance associated with\nthese eigenvalues do not exhibit ergodic behavior. The inverse participation\nratio (IPR) of the associated eigenvectors exhibits a multi-fractal volume\nscaling. The relation satisfied by number variance and IPR suggests critical\nbehavior.\n", "  Quantifying entanglement in composite systems is a fundamental challenge, yet\nexact results are only available in few special cases. This is because hard\noptimization problems are routinely involved, such as finding the convex\ndecomposition of a mixed state with the minimal average pure-state\nentanglement, the so-called convex roof. We show that under certain conditions\nsuch a problem becomes trivial. Precisely, we prove by a geometric argument\nthat polynomial entanglement measures of degree 2 are independent of the choice\nof pure-state decomposition of a mixed state, when the latter has only one pure\nunentangled state in its range. This allows for the analytical evaluation of\nconvex roof extended entanglement measures in classes of rank-two states\nobeying such condition. We give explicit examples for the square root of the\nthree-tangle in three-qubit states, and show that several representative\nclasses of four-qubit pure states have marginals that enjoy this property.\n", "  We show that a thin film of Weyl or Dirac semimetal with a strong in-plane\nmagnetic field becomes a novel two-dimensional Fermi liquid with interesting\nproperties. The Fermi surface in this system is strongly anisotropic, which\noriginates from a combination of chiral bulk channels and the Fermi arcs. The\narea enclosed by the Fermi surface depends strongly on the in-plane magnetic\nfield component parallel to the Weyl/Dirac node splitting, which leads to\nunusual behavior in quantum oscillations when the magnetic field is tilted out\nof the plane. We estimate the oscillation frequencies and the regimes where\nsuch effects could be seen in Cd$_3$As$_2$, Na$_3$Bi, and TaAs.\n", "  We report on a precision measurement of the $D$ line tune-out wavelength of\n$^{87}$Rubidium in the hyperfine ground state $|F=1, m_F=0,\\pm1 \\rangle$\nmanifold at 790 nm, where the scalar ac Stark shifts of the $D_1$ and the $D_2$\nlines cancel. This wavelength is sensitive to usually neglected contributions\nfrom vector and tensor ac Stark shifts, transitions to higher principle quantum\nnumbers, and core electrons. The ac Stark shift is probed by Kapitza-Dirac\nscattering of a Rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical\nlattice in free space and controlled magnetic environment. The tune-out\nwavelength of the magnetically insensitive $m_F=0$ state was determined to\n790.01858(23) nm with sub pm accuracy. An in situ absolute polarization, and\nmagnetic background field measurement is performed by employing the ac vector\nStark shift for the $m_F=\\pm 1$ states. Comparing our findings to theory, we\nget quantitative insight into atomic physics beyond commonly used two-level\natom approximations or the neglect of inner shell contributions.\n", "  We present a combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and\nfirst-principles calculations study of the electronic structure of LaAgSb$_2$\nin the entire first Brillouin zone. We observe a Dirac-cone-like structure in\nthe vicinity of the Fermi level formed by the crossing of two linear energy\nbands, as well as the nested segments of Fermi surface pocket emerging from the\ncone. Our ARPES results show the close relationship of the Dirac cone to the\ncharge-density-wave ordering, providing consistent explanations for exotic\nbehaviors in this material.\n", "  We classified the reddest ($r-J>2.2$) stars observed by the NASA $Kepler$\nmission into main sequence dwarf or evolved giant stars and determined the\nproperties of 4216 M dwarfs based on a comparison of available photometry with\nthat of nearby calibrator stars, as well as available proper motions and\nspectra. We revised the properties of candidate transiting planets using the\nstellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to identify companion stars, and,\nin the case of binaries, fitting light curves to identify the likely planet\nhost. In 49 of 54 systems we validated the primary as the host star. We\ninferred the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method of\niterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models of planet orbital\ngeometry and clustering and found that one where planets are exponentially\ndistributed and almost precisely coplanar best describes the distribution of\nmulti-planet systems. We determined that $Kepler$ M dwarfs host an average of\n$2.2 \\pm 0.3$ planets with radii of 1-4$R_{\\oplus}$ and orbital periods of\n1.5-180 d. The radius distribution peaks at $\\sim 1.2R_{\\oplus}$ and is\nessentially zero at $4R_{\\oplus}$, although we identify three giant planet\ncandidates other than the previously confirmed Kepler-45b. There is suggestive\nbut not significant evidence that the radius distribution varies with orbital\nperiod. The distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for a\ndecline for orbits less than a few days. Twelve candidate planets, including\ntwo Jupiter-size objects, experience an irradiance below the threshold level\nfor a runaway greenhouse on an Earth-like planet and are thus in a \"habitable\nzone\".\n", "  We produce the first concrete evidence that violation of the weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture can occur in asymptotically flat spaces of five\ndimensions by numerically evolving perturbed black rings. For certain thin\nrings, we identify a new, elastic-type instability dominating the evolution,\ncausing the system to settle to a spherical black hole. However, for\nsufficiently thin rings the Gregory-Laflamme mode is dominant, and the\ninstability unfolds similarly to that of black strings, where the horizon\ndevelops a structure of bulges connected by necks which become ever thinner\nover time.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of the total mass distribution of the galaxy\ncluster RXCJ2248 ($z=0.348$) with a set of high-precision strong lensing\nmodels, which take advantage of extensive spectroscopic information on many\nmultiply lensed systems. In the effort to understand and quantify inherent\nsystematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of\n22 models where we use different samples of multiple image families,\nparametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. As input\ninformation for the strong lensing models, we use the CLASH HST imaging data\nand spectroscopic follow-up observations, carried out with the VIMOS and MUSE\nspectrographs, to identify bona-fide multiple images. A total of 16 background\nsources, over the redshift range $1.0-6.1$, are multiply lensed into 47 images,\n24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to 10 individual\nsources. The cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in the\nmodels are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple images\non the lens plane. We show that with a careful selection of a sample of\nspectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model reproduces\ntheir observed positions with a rms of $0.3$ in a fixed flat $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information lead to biases in the\nvalues of the model parameters. Allowing cosmological parameters to vary\ntogether with the cluster parameters, we find (at $68\\%$ confidence level)\n$\\Omega_m=0.25^{+0.13}_{-0.16}$ and $w=-1.07^{+0.16}_{-0.42}$ for a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, and $\\Omega_m=0.31^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ and\n$\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.38^{+0.38}_{-0.27}$ for a universe with $w=-1$ and free\ncurvature. Using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of RXCJ2248, we\nestimate the impact of the line of sight mass structure on the positional rms\nto be $0.3\\pm 0.1$.(ABRIDGED)\n", "  We study the dynamics of optically-induced nuclear spin polarization in a\nfluorine-doped ZnSe epilayer via time-resolved Kerr rotation. The nuclear\npolarization in the vicinity of a fluorine donor is induced by interaction with\ncoherently precessing electron spins in a magnetic field applied in the Voigt\ngeometry. It is detected by nuclei-induced changes in the electron spin\ncoherence signal. This all-optical technique allows us to measure the\nlongitudinal spin relaxation time $T_{1}$ of the $^{77}\\text{Se}$ isotope in a\nmagnetic field range from 10 to 130~mT under illumination. We combine the\noptical technique with radio frequency methods to address the coherent spin\ndynamics of the nuclei and measure Rabi oscillations, Ramsey fringes and the\nnuclear spin echo. The inhomogeneous spin dephasing time $T_{2}^{*}$ and the\nspin coherence time $T_{2}$ of the $^{77}\\text{Se}$ isotope are measured. While\nthe $T_{1}$ time is on the order of several milliseconds, the $T_{2}$ time is\nseveral hundred microseconds. The experimentally determined condition $T_{1}\\gg\nT_{2}$ verifies the validity of the classical model of nuclear spin cooling for\ndescribing the optically-induced nuclear spin polarization.\n", "  Using the weak-noise theory, we evaluate the probability distribution\n$\\mathcal{P}(H,t)$ of large deviations of height $H$ of the evolving surface\nheight $h(x,t)$ in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in one dimension when\nstarting from a flat interface. We also determine the optimal history of the\ninterface, conditioned on reaching the height $H$ at time $t$. We argue that\nthe tails of $\\mathcal{P}$ behave, at arbitrary time $t>0$, and in a proper\nmoving frame, as $-\\ln \\mathcal{P}\\sim |H|^{5/2}$ and $\\sim |H|^{3/2}$. The\n$3/2$ tail coincides with the asymptotic of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble\nTracy-Widom distribution, previously observed at long times.\n", "  Infrared dark clouds are kinematically complex molecular structures in the\ninterstellar medium that can host sites of massive star formation. We present 4\nsquare arcminute maps of the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J = 3 to 2 lines from\nselected locations within the C and F (G028.37+00.07 and G034.43+00.24)\ninfrared dark clouds (IRDCs), as well as single pointing observations of the\n13CO and C18O J = 2 to 1 lines towards three cores within these clouds. We\nderive CO gas temperatures throughout the maps and find that CO is\nsignificantly frozen out within these IRDCs. We find that the CO depletion\ntends to be the highest near column density peaks, with maximum depletion\nfactors between 5 and 9 in IRDC F and between 16 and 31 in IRDC C. We also\ndetect multiple velocity components and complex kinematic structure in both\nIRDCs. Therefore, the kinematics of IRDCs seem to point to dynamically evolving\nstructures yielding dense cores with considerable depletion factors.\n", "  Over the past five decades, radio astronomy has shown that molecular\ncomplexity is a natural outcome of interstellar chemistry, in particular in\nstar forming regions. However, the pathways that lead to the formation of\ncomplex molecules are not completely understood and the depth of chemical\ncomplexity has not been entirely revealed. In addition, the sulfur chemistry in\nthe dense interstellar medium is not well understood.\n  We want to know the relative abundances of alkanethiols and alkanols in the\nGalactic Center source Sagittarius B2(N2), the northern hot molecular core in\nSgr B2(N), whose relatively small line widths are favorable for studying the\nmolecular complexity in space.\n  We investigated spectroscopic parameter sets that were able to reproduce\npublished laboratory rotational spectra of ethanethiol and studied effects that\nmodify intensities in the predicted rotational spectrum of ethanol. We used the\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in its Cycles~0 and 1 for a spectral line\nsurvey of Sagittarius B2(N) between 84 and 114.4 GHz. These data were analyzed\nby assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for each molecule. Our\nobservations are supplemented by astrochemical modeling; a new network is used\nfor the first time that includes reaction pathways for alkanethiols.\n  The column density ratios involving methanol, ethanol, and methanethiol in\nSgr B2(N2) are similar to values reported for Orion KL, but those involving\nethanethiol are significantly different and suggest that the detection of\nethanethiol reported toward Orion KL is uncertain. Our chemical model presently\ndoes not permit the prediction of sufficiently accurate column densities of\nalkanethiols or their ratios among alkanethiols and alkanols. Therefore,\nadditional observational results are required to establish the level of C2H5SH\nin the dense and warm interstellar medium with certainty.\n", "  Interfacing a single photon with another quantum system is a key capability\nin modern quantum information science. It allows quantum states of matter, such\nas spin states of atoms, atomic ensembles or solids, to be prepared and\nmanipulated by photon counting and, in particular, to be distributed over long\ndistances. Such light-matter interfaces have become crucial to fundamental\ntests of quantum physics and realizations of quantum networks. Here we report\nnon-classical correlations between single photons and phonons -- the quanta of\nmechanical motion -- from a nanomechanical resonator. We implement a full\nquantum protocol involving initialization of the resonator in its quantum\nground state of motion and subsequent generation and read-out of correlated\nphotonphonon pairs. The observed violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is\nclear evidence for the non-classical nature of the mechanical state generated.\nOur results demonstrate the availability of on-chip solid-state mechanical\nresonators as light-matter quantum interfaces. The performance we achieved will\nenable studies of macroscopic quantum phenomena as well as applications in\nquantum communication, as quantum memories and as quantum transducers.\n", "  An anomaly-free U(1) gauge extension of the standard model (SM) is presented.\nOnly one Higgs doublet with a nonzero vacuum expectation is required as in the\nSM. New fermions and scalars as well as all SM particles transform nontrivially\nunder this U(1), resulting in a model of three active neutrinos and one sterile\nneutrino, all acquiring radiative masses. Charged-lepton masses are also\nradiative as well as the mixing between active and sterile neutrinos. At the\nsame time, a residual $Z_2$ symmetry of the U(1) gauge symmetry remains exact,\nallowing for the existence of dark matter.\n", "  H2 is the simplest and the most abundant molecule in the ISM, and its\nformation precedes the formation of other molecules. Understanding the\ndynamical influence of the environment and the interplay between the thermal\nprocesses related to the formation and destruction of H2 and the structure of\nthe cloud is mandatory to understand correctly the observations of H2. We\nperform high resolution MHD colliding flow simulations with the AMR code RAMSES\nin which the physics of H2 has been included. We compare the simulation results\nwith various observations including the column densities of excited rotational\nlevels. Due to a combination of thermal pressure, ram pressure and gravity, the\nclouds produced at the converging point of HI streams are highly inhomogeneous.\nH2 molecules quickly form in relatively dense clumps and spread into the\ndiffuse interclump gas. This in particular leads to the existence of\nsignificant abundances of H2 in the diffuse and warm gas that lies in between\nclumps. Simulations and observations show similar trends, specially for the\nHI-to-H2 transition. The abundances of excited rotational levels, calculated at\nequilibrium in the simulations are very similar to the observed abundances\ninferred from FUSE results. This is a direct consequence of the presence of the\nH2 enriched diffuse and warm gas. Our simulations show that H2 rapidly forms in\nthe dense clumps and, due to the complex structure of molecular clouds, quickly\nspreads at lower densities. Consequently a significant fraction of warm H2\nexists in the low density gas. This warm H2 leads to column densities of\nexcited rotational levels close to the observed ones likely revealing the\ncomplex intermix between the warm and the cold gas in molecular clouds. This\nsuggests that the 2-phase structure of molecular clouds is an essential\ningredient to fully understand molecular hydrogen in these objects.\n", "  Optical observations provide convincing evidence that the optical phase of\nthe Crab pulsar follows the radio one closely. Since optical data do not depend\non dispersion measure variations, they provide a robust and independent\nconfirmation of the radio timing solution. The aim of this paper is to find a\nglobal mathematical description of Crab pulsar's phase as a function of time\nfor the complete set of published Jodrell Bank radio ephemerides (JBE) in the\nperiod 1988-2014. We apply the mathematical techniques developed for analyzing\noptical observations to the analysis of JBE. We break the whole period into a\nseries of episodes and express the phase of the pulsar in each episode as the\nsum of two analytical functions. The first function is the best-fitting local\nbraking index law, and the second function represents small residuals from this\nlaw with an amplitude of only a few turns, which rapidly relaxes to the local\nbraking index law. From our analysis, we demonstrate that the power law index\nundergoes \"instantaneous\" changes at the time of observed jumps in rotational\nfrequency (glitches). We find that the phase evolution of the Crab pulsar is\ndominated by a series of constant braking law episodes, with the braking index\nchanging abruptly after each episode in the range of values between 2.1 and\n2.6. Deviations from such a regular phase description behave as oscillations\ntriggered by glitches and amount to fewer than 40 turns during the above\nperiod, in which the pulsar has made more than 2.0e10 turns. Our analysis does\nnot favor the explanation that glitches are connected to phenomena occurring in\nthe interior of the pulsar. On the contrary, timing irregularities and changes\nin slow down rate seem to point to electromagnetic interaction of the pulsar\nwith the surrounding environment.\n", "  We analyze the contribution of the quiver kinetic energy acquired by an\nelectron in an oscillating electric field to the energy balance in atomic\nionization processes by a short laser pulse. Due to the time dependence of this\nadditional kinetic energy, a temporal average is assumed to maintain a\nstationary energy conservation rule. This rule is used to predict the position\nof the peaks observed in the photo electron spectra (PE). For a flat top pulse\nenvelope, the mean value of the quiver energy over the whole pulse leads to the\nconcept of ponderomotive energy $U_{p}$. However for a short pulse with a fast\nchanging field intensity a stationarity approximation could not be precise. We\ncheck these concepts by studying first the photoelectron (PE) spectrum within\nthe Semiclassical Model (SCM) for a multiple steps pulses. The SCM offers the\npossibility to establish a connection between emission times and the PE\nspectrum in the energy domain. We show that PE substructures stem from\nionization at different times mapping the pulse envelope. We also present the\nanalysis of the PE spectrum for a realistic sine-squared envelope within the\nCoulomb-Volkov and \\textit{ab initio} calculations solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. We found that the electron emission amplitudes produced\nat different times interfere with each other and produce a new additional\npattern, that overlap the above-threshold ionization (ATI) peaks.\n", "  Feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN) is one of the most promising\nheating mechanisms to circumvent the cooling-flow problem in galaxy clusters.\nHowever, the role of thermal conduction remains unclear. Previous studies have\nshown that anisotropic thermal conduction in cluster cool cores (CC) could\ndrive the heat-flux driven buoyancy instabilities (HBI) that re-orient the\nfield lines in the azimuthal directions and isolate the cores from conductive\nheating from the outskirts. However, how the AGN interacts with the HBI is\nstill unknown. To understand these interwined processes, we perform the first\n3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of isolated CC clusters that include\nanisotropic conduction, radiative cooling, and AGN feedback. We find that: (1)\nFor realistic magnetic field strengths in clusters, magnetic tension can\nsuppress a significant portion of HBI-unstable modes and thus the HBI is either\ncompletely inhibited or significantly impaired, depending on the unknown\nmagnetic field coherence length. (2) Turbulence driven by AGN jets can\neffectively randomize magnetic field lines and sustain conductivity at ~1/3 of\nthe Spitzer value; however, the AGN-driven turbulence is not volume-filling.\n(3) Conductive heating within the cores could contribute to ~10% of the\nradiative losses in Perseus-like clusters and up to ~50% for clusters twice the\nmass of Perseus. (4) Thermal conduction has various impacts on the AGN activity\nand ICM properties for the hottest clusters, which may be searched by future\nobservations to constrain the level of conductivity in clusters. The\ndistribution of cold gas and the implications are also discussed.\n", "  We apply variational principles from statistical physics and the Landau\ntheory of phase transitions to multicomponent alloys using the\nmultiple-scattering theory of Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) and the coherent\npotential approximation (CPA). This theory is a multicomponent generalization\nof the $S^{(2)}$ theory of binary alloys developed by G. M. Stocks, J. B.\nStaunton, D. D. Johnson and others. It is highly relevant to the chemical phase\nstability of high-entropy alloys as it predicts the kind and size of\nfinite-temperature chemical fluctuations. In doing so it includes effects of\nrearranging charge and other electronics due to changing site occupancies. When\nchemical fluctuations grow without bound an absolute instability occurs and a\nsecond-order order-disorder phase transition may be inferred. The S$^{(2)}$\ntheory is predicated on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem; thus we derive the\nlinear response of the CPA medium to perturbations in site-dependent chemical\npotentials in great detail. The theory lends itself to a natural interpretation\nin terms of competing effects: entropy driving disorder and favorable pair\ninteractions driving atomic ordering. To further clarify interpretation we\npresent results for representative ternary alloys CuAgAu, NiPdPt, RhPdAg, and\nCoNiCu within a frozen charge (or band-only) approximation. These results\ninclude the so-called Onsager mean field correction that extends the\ntemperature range for which the theory is valid.\n", "  We study slowly rotating, asymptotically flat black holes in Einstein-aether\ntheory and show that solutions that are free from naked finite area\nsingularities form a two-parameter family. These parameters can be thought of\nas the mass and angular momentum of the black hole, while there are no\nindependent aether charges. We also show that the aether has non-vanishing\nvorticity throughout the spacetime, as a result of which there is no\nhypersurface that resembles the universal horizon found in static, spherically\nsymmetric solutions. Moreover, for experimentally viable choices of the\ncoupling constants, the frame-dragging potential of our solutions only shows\npercent-level deviations from the corresponding quantities in General\nRelativity and Horava gravity. Finally, we uncover and discuss several\nsubtleties in the correspondence between Einstein-aether theory and Horava\ngravity solutions in the $c_\\omega\\to\\infty$ limit.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a sample of X-shaped radio-sources (XRSs). These\nobjects show, in addition to the main lobes, a pair of wings producing their\npeculiar radio morphology. We obtain our sample by selecting from the initial\nlist of Cheung (2007, AJ, 133, 2097) the 53 galaxies with the better defined\nwings and with available SDSS images. We identified the host galaxies and\nmeasured their optical position angle, obtaining a positive result in 22 cases.\nThe orientation of the secondary radio structures shows a strong connection\nwith the optical axis, with all (but one) wing forming a angle larger than 40\ndegrees with the host major axis. The probability that this is compatible with\na uniform distribution is P = 0.9 10E-4. Spectra are available from the SDSS\nfor 28 XRSs. We modeled them to extract information on their emission lines and\nstellar population properties. The sample is formed by approximately the same\nnumber of high and low excitation galaxies (HEG and LEG); this classification\nis essential for a proper comparison with non-winged radio-galaxies. XRSs\nfollow the same relations between radio and line luminosity defined by\nradio-galaxies in the 3C sample. While in HEGs a young stellar population is\noften present, this is not detected in the 13 LEGs, again in agreement with the\nproperties of non XRSs. The lack of young stars in LEGs support the idea that\nthey did not experiences a recent gas rich merger. The connection between the\noptical axis and the wings orientation, as well as the stellar population and\nemission lines properties, provide further support for an hydro-dynamic origin\nof the radio-wings (for example associated with the expansion of the radio\ncocoon in an asymmetric external medium) rather than with a change of\norientation of the jet axis.\n", "  We present 3D hydrodynamic adiabatic simulations of a shock interacting with\na dense, elongated cloud. We compare how the nature of the interaction changes\nwith the filament's length and its orientation to the shock, and with the shock\nMach number and the density contrast of the filament. We then examine the\ndifferences with respect to 3D spherical-cloud calculations. We find\nsignificant differences in the morphology of the interaction when M=10 and\nchi=100: in many cases 3 parallel rolls are formed, and spread further apart\nwith time, and periodic vortex shedding can occur off the ends of oblique\nfilaments. Sideways-on filaments are accelerated more quickly, and initially\nlose mass more quickly than spherical clouds due to their greater surface area\nto volume ratio. However, at late stages they lose mass more slowly, due to the\nreduced relative speed between the filament and the postshock flow. The\nacceleration and mixing timescales can vary by a factor of 2 as the filament\norientation changes. Oblique filaments can achieve transverse velocities up to\n10% of the shock speed. Some aspects of our simulations are compared against\nexperimental and numerical work on rigid cylinders.\n", "  Two empirical formulae for the lepton and quark masses (i.e. Kartavtsev's\nextended Koide formulae), $K_l=(\\sum_l m_l)/(\\sum_l\\sqrt{m_l})^2=2/3$ and\n$K_q=(\\sum_q m_q)/(\\sum_q\\sqrt{m_q})^2=2/3$, are explored in this paper. For\nthe lepton sector, we show that $K_l=2/3$, only if the uncertainty of the tauon\nmass is relaxed to about $2\\sigma$ confidence level, and the neutrino masses\ncan consequently be extracted with the current experimental data. For the quark\nsector, the extended Koide formula should only be applied to the running quark\nmasses, and $K_q$ is found to be rather insensitive to the renormalization\neffects in a large range of energy scales from GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV. However,\n$K_q$ is always slightly larger than $2/3$, but the discrepancy is merely about\n$5\\%$.\n", "  We study a system of nanowires, i.e., the theory of 1+1 dimensional massless\nfermions interacting with 3+1 dimensional U(1) gauge fields. When allowing for\nnon-zero chemical potentials, this system has a complex action problem in the\nconventional formulation. We show that the partition sum can be mapped to a\ndual representation where the fermions correspond to dimers and oriented loops\non 2-dimensional planes embedded in 4 dimensions. The dual degrees of freedom\nfor the gauge fields are surfaces that either are closed or bounded by the\nfermion loops. In terms of the dual variables the complex action problem is\novercome and Monte Carlo simulations are possible for arbitrary chemical\npotentials.\n", "  Context: Transmission spectroscopy has proven to be a useful tool for the\nstudy of exoplanet atmospheres, and has lead to the detection of a small number\nof elements and molecules (Na, K, H$_2$O), but also revealed that many planets\nshow flat transmission spectra consistent with the presence of opaque\nhigh-altitude hazes or clouds.\n  Aims: We apply this technique to the $M_P=0.38 M_{jup}$, $R_p=1.12 R_{jup}$,\n$P=2.78d$ planet WASP-49b, aiming to characterize its transmission spectrum\nbetween 0.73 and 1 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m and search for the features of K and H$_2$O.\n  Methods: Three transits of WASP-49b have been observed with the FORS2\ninstrument installed at the VLT/UT1 telescope at the ESO Paranal site. We used\nFORS2 in MXU mode with grism GRIS_600z, producing simultaneous multiwavelength\ntransit lightcurves throughout the i' and z' bands. We combined these data with\nindependent broadband photometry from the Euler and TRAPPIST telescopes to\nobtain a good measurement of the transit shape. Strong correlated noise\nstructures are present in the FORS2 lightcurves, which are due to rotating\nflat-field structures that are introduced by inhomogeneities of the linear\natmospheric dispersion corrector's transparency. We accounted for these\nstructures by constructing common noise models from the residuals of\nlightcurves bearing the same noise structures, and used them together with\nsimple parametric models to infer the transmission spectrum.\n  Results: We present three independent transmission spectra of WASP-49b\nbetween 0.73 and 1.02 $\\mu m$, as well as a transmission spectrum between 0.65\nand 1.02 $\\mu m$ from the combined analysis of FORS2 and broadband data. The\nresults obtained from the three individual epochs agree well. The transmission\nspectrum of WASP-49b is best fit by atmospheric models containing a cloud deck\nat pressure levels of 1 mbar or lower.\n", "  Slow neutron captures are responsible for the production of about $50\\%$ of\nelements heavier than iron, mainly, occurring during the asymptotic giant\nbranch phase of low-mass stars ($1$ $\\lesssim M$/M$_{\\odot}$ $\\lesssim$ $3$),\nwhere the main neutron source is the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction.\nThis last is activated from locally-produced $^{13}$C, formed by partial mixing\nof hydrogen into the He-rich layers. We present here the first attempt at\ndescribing a physical mechanism for the formation of the $^{13}$C reservoir,\nstudying the mass circulation induced by magnetic buoyancy and without adding\nnew free parameters to those already involved in stellar modelling. Our\napproach represents the application, to the stellar layers relevant for\n$s$-processing, of recent exact, analytical 2D and 3D models for\nmagneto-hydrodynamic processes at the base of convective envelopes in evolved\nstars in order to promote downflows of envelope material for mass conservation,\nduring the occurrence of a dredge-up phenomenon. We find that the proton\npenetration is characterized by small concentrations, but extended over a large\nfractional mass of the He-layers, thus producing $^{13}$C reservoirs of several\n$10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The ensuing $^{13}$C-enriched zone has an almost flat\nprofile, while only a limited production of $^{14}$N occurs. In order to verify\nthe effects of our new findings we show how the abundances of the main\n$s$-component nuclei can be accounted for in solar proportions and how our\nlarge $^{13}$C-reservoir allows us to solve a few so far unexplained features\nin the abundance distribution of post-AGB objects.\n", "  The depolarization properties of a medium with associated Mueller matrix M\nare characterized through two complementary sets of parameters, namely the\nthree indices of polarimetric purity (IPP), which are directly linked to the\nrelative weights of the spectral components of M and provide complete\ninformation on the structure of polarimetric randomness, but are insensitive to\nthe specific polarimetric behaviors that originate the lack of randomness; and\nthe set of three components of purity (CP), constituted by the polarizance, the\ndiattenuation and the degree of spherical purity. The relations between these\nsets of physical invariant quantities are studied by means of their\nrepresentation into a common purity figure. Furthermore, the polarimetric\nproperties of a general Mueller matrix are parameterized in terms of sixteen\nmeaningful quantities, three of them being the IPP, which together the CP\nprovide complete information of the amount and sources of depolarization of the\nmedium to which M is associated.\n", "  Transition discs are protoplanetary discs that show evidence for large holes\nor wide gaps (with widths comparable to their radii) in their dust component.\nThese discs could be giving us clues about the disc destruction mechanism or\nhints about the location and time-scales for the formation of planets. However,\nat the moment there remain key gaps in our theoretical understanding. The vast\nmajority of transition discs are accreting onto their central stars, indicating\nthat - at least close to the star - dust has been depleted from the gas by a\nvery large amount. In this review, we discuss evidence for two distinct\npopulations of transition discs: mm-faint - those with low mm-fluxes, small\nholes ($\\lesssim$10AU) and low accretion rates (~1e-10-1e-9 Msun/yr) and\nmm-bright - discs with large mm-fluxes, large holes ($\\gtrsim$20 AU) and high\naccretion rates ~1e-8 Msun/yr. MM-faint transition discs are consistent with\nwhat would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however,\nmm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We\ndiscuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs:\nphotoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on\nhow they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the\nobserved population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically\nthick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation\nand planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to\nconstrain models of planet formation. Finally, we suggest that the few discs\nwith primordial looking SEDs, but serendipitously imaged, showing large\ncavities in the mm (e.g. MWC758 & WSB 60) may represent a hidden population of\nassociated objects. Characterising and understanding how these objects fit into\nthe overall paradigm may allow us to unravel the mystery of transition discs.\n", "  We report on the realization of sub-Doppler laser cooling of sodium atoms in\ngray molasses using the D1 optical transition ($3s\\, ^2S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 3p\\,\n^2P_{1/2}$) at 589.8 nm. The technique is applied to samples containing\n$3\\times10^9$ atoms, previously cooled to 350 $\\mu$K in a magneto-optical trap,\nand it leads to temperatures as low as 9 $\\mu$K and phase-space densities in\nthe range of $10^{-4}$. The capture efficiency of the gray molasses is larger\nthan 2/3, and we observe no density-dependent heating for densities up to\n$10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$.\n", "  We investigate the intermittency of energy dissipation in Alfvenic turbulence\nby considering the statistics of the coarse-grained energy dissipation rate,\nusing direct measurements from numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence and surrogate measurements from the solar wind. We compare the\nresults to the predictions of the log-normal and log-Poisson random cascade\nmodels. We find that, to a very good approximation, the log-normal model\ndescribes the probability density function for the energy dissipation over a\nbroad range of scales, but does not accurately describe the scaling exponents\nof the moments. The log-Poisson model better describes the scaling exponents of\nthe moments, while the comparison with the probability density function is not\nstraightforward.\n", "  Massive, evolved stars play a crucial role in the metal-enrichment, dust\nbudget, and energetics of the interstellar medium, however, the details of\ntheir evolution are uncertain because of their rarity and short lifetimes\nbefore exploding as supernovae. Discrepancies between theoretical predictions\nfrom single-star evolutionary models and observations of massive stars have\nevoked a shifting paradigm that implicates the importance of binary\ninteraction. We present mid- to far-infrared observations from the\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) of a conical \"helix\"\nof warm dust ($\\sim180$ K) that appears to extend from the Wolf-Rayet star\nWR102c. Our interpretation of the helix is a precessing, collimated outflow\nthat emerged from WR102c during a previous evolutionary phase as a rapidly\nrotating luminous blue variable. We attribute the precession of WR102c to\ngravitational interactions with an unseen compact binary companion whose\norbital period can be constrained to $800\\,\\mathrm{d}<P<1400$ d from the\ninferred precession period, $\\tau_p\\sim1.4\\times10^4$ yr, and limits imposed on\nthe stellar and orbital parameters of the system. Our results concur with the\nrange of orbital periods ($P\\lesssim1500$ d) where spin-up via mass exchange is\nexpected to occur for massive binary systems.\n", "  With the XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, for the first time, we acquired\nbroad-band spectra of two unidentified X-ray sources towards the Galactic\nbulge: 1RXS J180556.1$-$343818 and 1RXS J173905.2$-$392615. The 1RXS\nJ180556.1$-$343818 spectrum in the $0.3$-$7$ keV band was explained by X-ray\nemission originated from an optically-thin thermal plasma with temperatures of\n$0.5$ and $1.7$ keV. The estimated absorption column density of $N_{\\rm H} \\sim\n4 \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ was significantly smaller than the Galactic HI\ncolumn density towards the source. A candidate of its optical counterpart, HD\n321269, was found within $4''$. In terms of the X-ray properties and the\npositional coincidence, it is quite conceivable that 1RXS J180556.1$-$343818 is\nan active G giant. We also found a dim X-ray source that was positionally\nconsistent with 1RXS J173905.2$-$392615. Assuming that the X-ray spectrum can\nbe reproduced with an absorbed optically-thin thermal plasma model with $kT =\n1.6$ keV, the X-ray flux in the $0.5$-$8$ keV band was $8.7 \\times 10^{-14}$\nerg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, fainter by a factor of $\\sim 7$ than that of 1RXS\nJ173905.2$-$392615 during the ROSAT observation. The follow-up observations we\nconducted revealed that these two sources would belong to the Galactic disk,\nrather than the Galactic bulge.\n", "  We show that low-mass-scale string compactifications, with a generic D-brane\nconfiguration that realizes the standard model by open strings, can explain the\nrelatively broad peak in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum at 750 GeV\nrecently reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Under reasonable\nassumptions, we demonstrate that the excess could originate from a closed\nstring (possibly axionic) excitation \\varphi that has a coupling with gauge\nkinetic terms. We estimate the \\varphi production rate from photon-photon\nfusion in elastic pp scattering, using the effective photon and narrow width\napproximations. For string scales above todays lower limit M_s \\approx 7 TeV,\nwe can accommodate the diphoton rate observed at Run II while maintaining\nconsistency with Run I data.\n", "  Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a model system that has been used to understand\nclosely-occurring multiband electronic (Mott) and structural (Peierls)\ntransitions for over half a century due to continued scientific and\ntechnological interests. Among the many techniques used to study VO2, the most\nfrequently used involve electromagnetic radiation as a probe. Understanding of\nthe distinct physical information provided by different probing radiations is\nincomplete, mostly owing to the complicated nature of the phase transitions.\nHere we use transmission of spatially averaged infrared ({\\lambda}=1500 nm) and\nvisible ({\\lambda}=500 nm) radiations followed by spectroscopy and nanoscale\nimaging using x-rays ({\\lambda}=2.25-2.38 nm) to probe the same VO2 sample\nwhile controlling the ambient temperature across its hysteretic phase\ntransitions and monitoring its electrical resistance. We directly observed\nnanoscale puddles of distinct electronic and structural compositions during the\ntransition. The two main results are that, during both heating and cooling, the\ntransition of infrared and visible transmission occur at significantly lower\ntemperatures than the Mott transition; and the electronic (Mott) transition\noccurs before the structural (Peierls) transition in temperature. We use our\ndata to provide insights into possible microphysical origins of the different\ntransition characteristics. We highlight that it is important to understand\nthese effects because small changes in the nature of the probe can yield\nquantitatively, and even qualitatively, different results when applied to a\nnon-trivial multiband phase transition. Our results guide more judicious use of\nprobe type and interpretation of the resulting data.\n", "  Depending on whether a T Tauri star accretes material from its circumstellar\ndisk or not, different X-ray emission properties can be found. The accretion\nshocks produce cool heating of the plasma, contributing to the soft X-ray\nemission from the star. Using X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultra-deep\nProject and accretion rates that were obtained with the Hubble Space\nTelescope/WFPC2 photometric measurements in the Orion Nebula Cluster, we\nstudied the relation between the accretion processes and the X-ray emissions of\na coherent sample of T Tauri sources in the region. We performed regression and\ncorrelation analyses of our sample of T Tauri stars between the X-ray\nparameters, stellar properties, and the accretion measurements. We find that a\nclear anti-correlation is present between the residual X-ray luminosity and the\naccretion rates in our samples in Orion that is consistent with that found on\nthe XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus molecular cloud (XEST) study. We\nprovide a catalog with X-ray luminosities (corrected from distance) and\naccretion measurements of an Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) T Tauri stars sample.\nAlthough Orion and Taurus display strong differences in their properties (total\ngas and dust mass, star density, strong irradiation from massive stars), we\nfind that a similar relation between the residual X-ray emission and accretion\nrate is present in the Taurus molecular cloud and in the accreting samples from\nthe Orion Nebula Cluster. The spread in the data suggests dependencies of the\naccretion rates and the X-ray luminosities other than the stellar mass, but the\nsimilarity between Orion and Taurus hints at the environment not being one of\nthem. The anti-correlation between the residual X-ray luminosity and mass\naccretion rate is inherent to the T Tauri stars in general, independent of\ntheir birthplace and environment, and intrinsic to early stellar evolution.\n", "  We explore the shadow of certain class generalized Kerr black holes, which\nare non vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations with exotic matter. The\nimages depend on the angular momentum of the compact object, the characteristic\nparameter $l$ of the model, and the inclination angle of the observer. The\nresults are compared with the case of the Kerr black hole and the Kerr naked\nsingularity.\n", "  The theory of very special relativity (VSR) proposed by Cohen and Glashow\ncontains an intrinsic preferred direction. Starting from the irreducible\nunitary representation of the inhomogeneous VSR group $ISIM(2)$, we present a\nrigorous construction of quantum field theory with a preferred direction. We\nfind, although the particles and their quantum fields between the VSR and\nLorentz sectors are physically different, they share many similarities. The\nmassive spin-half and spin-one vector fields are local and satisfy the Dirac\nand Proca equations respectively. This result can be generalised to higher-spin\nfield theories. By studying the Yukawa and standard gauge interactions, we\nobtain a qualitative understanding on the effects of the preferred direction.\nIts effect is manifest for polarised processes but are otherwise absent.\n", "  Context. To investigate the dynamical properties of protostellar jets. Aims.\nDetermine the proper motion of protostellar jets around Class 0 and Class I\nsources in an active star forming region in Serpens. Methods. Multi-epoch deep\nimages in the 2.122 $\\mu$m line of molecular hydrogen, v=1-0 S(1), obtained\nwith the near-infrared instrument NOTCam over a time-scale of 10 years, are\nused to determine proper motion of knots and jets. K-band spectroscopy of the\nbrighter knots is used to supply radial velocities, estimate extinction,\nexcitation temperature, and H$_2$ column densities towards these knots.\nResults. We measure the proper motion of 31 knots over different time scales\n(2, 4, 6, and 10 years). The typical tangential velocity is around 50 km/s for\nthe 10 year base-line, but for shorter time-scales a maximum tangential\nvelocity up to 300 km/s is found for a few knots. Based on morphology, velocity\ninformation and the locations of known protostars, we argue for the existence\nof at least three partly overlapping and deeply embedded flows, one Class 0\nflow and two Class I flows. The multi-epoch proper motion results indicate\ntime-variable velocities of the knots, for the first time directly measured for\na Class 0 jet. We find in general higher velocities for the Class 0 jet than\nfor the two Class I jets. While the bolometric luminosites of the three driving\nsources are about equal, the derived mass flow rate (dM/dt)$_{\\rm out}$ is two\norders of magnitude higher in the Class 0 flow than in the two Class I flows.\n", "  Problem solving (e.g., drug design, traffic engineering, software\ndevelopment) by task forces represents a substantial portion of the economy of\ndeveloped countries. Here we use an agent-based model of cooperative problem\nsolving systems to study the influence of diversity on the performance of a\ntask force. We assume that agents cooperate by exchanging information on their\npartial success and use that information to imitate the more successful agent\nin the system -- the model. The agents differ only in their propensities to\ncopy the model. We find that, for easy tasks, the optimal organization is a\nhomogeneous system composed of agents with the highest possible copy\npropensities. For difficult tasks, we find that diversity can prevent the\nsystem from being trapped in sub-optimal solutions. However, when the system\nsize is adjusted to maximize performance the homogeneous systems outperform the\nheterogeneous systems, i.e., for optimal performance, sameness should be\npreferred to diversity.\n", "  Recent population synthesis simulations of Pop III stars suggest that the\nevent rate of coalescence of $\\sim 30M_\\odot$--$30M_\\odot$ binary black holes\ncan be high enough for the detection by the second generation gravitational\nwave detectors. The frequencies of chirp signal as well as quasinormal modes\nare near the best sensitivity of these detectors so that it would be possible\nto confirm Einstein's general relativity. Using the WKB method, we suggest that\nfor the typical value of spin parameter $a/M\\sim 0.7$ from numerical relativity\nresults of the coalescence of binary black holes, the strong gravity of the\nblack hole space-time at around the radius $2M$, which is just $\\sim 1.17$\ntimes the event horizon radius, would be confirmed as predicted by general\nrelativity. The expected event rate with the signal-to-noise ratio $> 35$\nneeded for the determination of the quasinormal mode frequency with the\nmeaningful accuracy is $0.17$--$7.2$~${\\rm\nevents~yr^{-1}~(SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}))} \\cdot (\\rm\n[f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33)$ where ${\\rm SFR_p}$ and ${\\rm f_b}$ are the peak value of\nthe Pop III star formation rate and the fraction of binaries, respectively. As\nfor the possible optical counter part, if the merged black hole of mass $M\\sim\n60M_\\odot$ is in the interstellar matter with $n\\sim 100~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ and the\nproper motion of black hole is $\\sim 1~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the luminosity is\n$\\sim 10^{40}~{\\rm erg~ s^{-1}}$ which can be detected up to $\\sim 300~{\\rm\nMpc}$, for example, by Subaru-HSC and LSST with the limiting magnitude 26.\n", "  We propose a four-loop induced radiative neutrino mass model inspired by the\ndiphoton excess at 750 GeV recently reported by ATLAS and CMS, in which a\nsizable diphoton excess is obtained via photon fusion introducing multi\ndoubly-charged scalar bosons. Also we discuss the muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment, and a dark matter candidate. The main process to explain the observed\nrelic density relies on the final state of the new particle at 750 GeV. Finally\nwe show the numerical results and obtain allowed region of several physical\nvalues in our model.\n", "  We report on X-ray observations of the 5.54 s transient magnetar XTE\nJ1810-197 using the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories, analyzing new data\nfrom 2008 through 2014, and re-analyzing data from 2003 through 2007 with the\nbenefit of these six years of new data. From the discovery of XTE J1810-197\nduring its 2003 outburst to the most recent 2014 observations, its 0.3-10 keV\nX-ray flux has declined by a factor of about 50 from 4.1E-11 to 8.1E-13\nerg/cm^2/s. Its X-ray spectrum has now reached a steady state. Pulsations\ncontinue to be detected from a 0.3 keV thermal hot-spot that remains on the\nneutron star surface. The luminosity of this hot-spot exceeds XTE J1810-197's\nspin down luminosity, indicating continuing magnetar activity. We find that XTE\nJ1810-197's X-ray spectrum is best described by a multiple component blackbody\nmodel in which the coldest 0.14 keV component likely originates from the entire\nneutron star surface, and the thermal hot-spot is, at different epochs, well\ndescribed by an either one or two-component blackbody model. A 1.2 keV\nabsorption line, possibly due to resonant proton scattering, is detected at all\nepochs. The X-ray flux of the hot spot decreased by approximately 20% between\n2008 March and 2009 March, the same period during which XTE J1810-197 became\nradio quiet.\n", "  The ground state of large Hubbard $U$ limit of a honeycomb lattice near\nhalf-filling is known to be a singlet $d+id$-wave superconductor. It is also\nknown that this $d+id$ superconductor exhibits a chiral $p+ip$ pairing locally\nat the Dirac cone, characterized by a $2\\mathbb{Z}$ topological invariant. By\nconstructing a dual transformation, we demonstrate that this $2\\mathbb{Z}$\ntopological superconductor is equivalent to a collection of two topological\nferromagnetic insulators. As a result of the duality, the topology of the\nelectronic structures for a $d+id$ superconductor is controllable via the\nchange of the chemical potential by tuning the gate voltage. In particular,\ninstead of being always a chiral superconductor, we find that the $d+id$\nsuperconductor undergoes a topological phase transition from a chiral\nsuperconductor to a quasi-helical superconductor as the gap amplitude or the\nchemical potential decreases. The quasi-helical superconducting phase is found\nto be characterized by a topological invariant in the pseudo-spin charge sector\nwith vanishing both the Chern number and the spin Chern number. We further\nelucidate the topological phase transition by analyzing the relationship\nbetween the topological invariant and the rotation symmetry. Due to the angular\nmomentum carried by the gap function and spin-orbit interactions, we show that\nby placing $d+id$ superconductors in proximity to ferromagnets, varieties of\nchiral superconducting phases characterized by higher Chern numbers can be\naccessed, providing a new platform for hosting large numbers of Majorana modes\nat edges.\n", "  The physical mechanisms that induce the transformation of a certain mass of\ngas in new stars are far from being well understood. Infrared bubbles\nassociated with HII regions have been considered to be good samples of\ninvestigating triggered star formation. In this paper we report on the\ninvestigation of the dust properties of the infrared bubble N4 around the HII\nregion G11.898+0.747, analyzing its interaction with its surroundings and star\nformation histories therein, with the aim of determining the possibility of\nstar formation triggered by the expansion of the bubble. Using Herschel PACS\nand SPIRE images with a wide wavelength coverage, we reveal the dust properties\nover the entire bubble. Meanwhile, we are able to identify six dust clumps\nsurrounding the bubble, with a mean size of 0.50 pc, temperature of about 22 K,\nmean column density of 1.7 $\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, mean volume density of\nabout 4.4 $\\times10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and a mean mass of 320 $M_{\\odot}$. In\naddition, from PAH emission seen at 8 $\\mu$m, free-free emission detected at 20\ncm and a probability density function in special regions, we could identify\nclear signatures of the influence of the HII region on the surroundings. There\nare hints of star formation, though further investigation is required to\ndemonstrate that N4 is the triggering source.\n", "  We report the discovery of 42 white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission\nfield, including nine new confirmed pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs\n(ZZ Ceti stars). Guided by the Kepler-INT Survey (KIS), we selected white dwarf\ncandidates on the basis of their U-g, g-r, and r-H_alpha photometric colours.\nWe followed up these candidates with high-signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy\nfrom the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope. Using ground-based, time-series\nphotometry, we put our sample of new spectroscopically characterized white\ndwarfs in the context of the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Prior to our\nsearch, only two pulsating white dwarfs had been observed by Kepler.\nUltimately, four of our new ZZ Cetis were observed from space. These rich\ndatasets are helping initiate a rapid advancement in the asteroseismic\ninvestigation of pulsating white dwarfs, which continues with the extended\nKepler mission, K2.\n", "  We propose a kind of novel topological quantum state of semimetals in a\nquasi-one-dimensional (1D) crystals BaMX$_3$ (M = V, Nb or Ta; X = S or Se)\nfamily by using symmetry analysis and first principles calculation. We find\nthat in BaVS$_3$ the valence and conduction bands are degenerate in the\n$k_z=\\pi/c$ plane ($c$ is the lattice constant along $\\hat{z}$ axis) of the\nBrillouin Zone (BZ). These nodal points form a node-surface and they are\nprotected by a nonsymmorphic crystal symmetry consisting of a two-fold rotation\nabout the $\\hat{z}$ axis and a half-translation along the same $\\hat{z}$ axis.\nThe band degeneracy in the node-surface is lifted in BaTaS$_3$ by including\nstrong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of Ta. The node-surface is reduced into 1D\nnode-lines along the high-symmetry paths $k_x=0$ and $k_x$ = $\\pm{\\sqrt{3}}k_y$\non the $k_z=\\pi/c$ plane. These node-lines are robust against SOC and\nguaranteed by the symmetries of $P6_3/mmc$ space group. These node-line states\nare entirely different from previous proposals which are based on the\naccidental band touchings. We also propose a useful material design for\nrealizing topological node-surface and node-line semimetals.\n", "  We measured the gas abundance profiles in a sample of 122 face-on spiral\ngalaxies observed by the CALIFA survey and included all spaxels whose line\nemission was consistent with star formation. This type of analysis allowed us\nto improve the statistics with respect to previous studies, and to properly\nestimate the oxygen distribution across the entire disc to a distance of up to\n3-4 disc effective radii (r$_e$). We confirm the results obtained from\nclassical HII region analysis. In addition to the general negative gradient, an\nouter flattening can be observed in the oxygen abundance radial profile. An\ninner drop is also found in some cases. There is a common abundance gradient\nbetween 0.5 and 2.0 r$_e$ of $\\alpha_{O/H} = -\\,0.075\\,\\rm{dex}/r_e$ with a\nscatter of $\\sigma = 0.016\\,\\rm{dex}/r_e$ when normalising the distances to the\ndisc effective radius. By performing a set of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we\ndetermined that this slope is independent of other galaxy properties, such as\nmorphology, absolute magnitude, and the presence or absence of bars. In\nparticular, barred galaxies do not seem to display shallower gradients, as\npredicted by numerical simulations. Interestingly, we find that most of the\ngalaxies in the sample with reliable oxygen abundance values beyond $\\sim 2$\neffective radii (57 galaxies) present a flattening of the abundance gradient in\nthese outer regions. This flattening is not associated with any morphological\nfeature, which suggests that it is a common property of disc galaxies. Finally,\nwe detect a drop or truncation of the abundance in the inner regions of 27\ngalaxies in the sample; this is only visible for the most massive galaxies.\n", "  The nature and origin of the asteroids orbiting in near-Earth space,\nincluding those on a potentially hazardous trajectory, is of both scientific\ninterest and practical importance. We aim here at determining the taxonomy of a\nlarge sample of near-Earth (NEA) and Mars-crosser (MC) asteroids and analyze\nthe distribution of these classes with orbit. We use this distribution to\nidentify their source regions and to study the strength of planetary encounters\nto refresh asteroid surfaces. We measure the photometry of these asteroids over\nfour filters at visible wavelengths on images taken by the SDSS. These colors\nare used to classify the asteroids into a taxonomy consistent with the widely\nused Bus-DeMeo taxonomy based on spectroscopy. We report here on the taxonomic\nclassification of 206 NEAs and 776 MCs determined from SDSS photometry,\nrepresenting an increase of 40% and 663% of known taxonomy classifications in\nthese populations. Using the source region mapper by Greenstreet et al. (2012),\nwe compare the taxonomic distribution among NEAs and main-belt asteroids of\nsimilar diameters. Both distributions agree at the few percent level for the\ninner part of the Main Belt and we confirm this region as a main source of\nnear-Earth objects. The effect of planetary encounters on asteroid surfaces are\nalso studied by developing a simple model of forces acting on a surface grain\nduring planetary encounter, which provides the minimum distance at which a\nclose approach should occur to trigger resurfacing events. By integrating\nnumerically the orbit of the 519 S-type and 46 Q-type asteroids back in time\nand monitoring their encounter distance with planets, we seek to understand the\nconditions for resurfacing events. The population of Q-type is found to present\nstatistically more encounters with Venus and the Earth than S-types, although\nboth types present the same amount of encounters with Mars.\n", "  Amorphous solids yield at a critical value of the strain (in strain\ncontrolled experiments); for larger strains the average stress can no longer\nincrease - the system displays an elasto-plastic steady state. A long standing\nriddle in the materials community is what is the difference between the\nmicroscopic states of the material before and after yield. Explanations in the\nliterature are material specific, but the universality of the phenomenon begs a\nuniversal answer. We argue here that there is no fundamental difference in the\nstates of matter before and after yield, but the yield is a bona-fide first\norder phase transition between a highly restricted set of possible\nconfigurations residing in a small region of phase space to a vastly rich set\nof configurations which include many marginally stable ones. To show this we\nemploy an order parameter of universal applicability, independent of the\nmicroscopic interactions, that is successful in quantifying the transition in\nan unambiguous manner.\n", "  We present new observations of the \"supernova impostor\" SN 2010da using the\nChandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope. During the initial\n2010 outburst, the 0.3-10 keV luminosity was observed by Swift to be\n$\\sim5\\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and faded by a factor of $\\sim$25 in a four\nmonth period. Our two new Chandra observations show a factor of $\\sim$10\nincrease in the 0.35-8 keV X-ray flux, from $\\sim$4$\\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$\nto $4\\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in $\\sim$6 months, and the X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent in both observations with a power law photon index of $\\Gamma\\sim0$.\nWe find evidence of X-ray spectral state changes: when SN 2010da is in a\nhigh-luminosity state, the X-ray spectrum is harder ($\\Gamma\\sim0$) compared to\nthe low-luminosity state ($\\Gamma\\sim1.2\\pm0.8$). Using our Hubble\nobservations, we fit the color magnitude diagram of the coeval stellar\npopulation to estimate a time since formation of the SN 2010da progenitor\nsystem of $\\lesssim$5 Myr. Our observations are consistent with SN 2010da being\na high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) composed of a neutron star and a luminous blue\nvariable-like companion, although we cannot rule out the possibility that SN\n2010da is an unusually X-ray bright massive star. The $\\lesssim$5 Myr age is\nconsistent with the theoretically predicted delay time between the formation of\na massive binary and the onset of the HMXB phase. It is possible that the\ninitial 2010 outburst marked the beginning of X-ray production in the system,\nmaking SN 2010da possibly the first massive progenitor binary ever observed to\nevolve into an HMXB.\n", "  We present an analytical model that considers energy arising from a magnetar\ncentral engine. The results of fitting this model to the optical and X-ray\nlight curves (LCs) of five long-duration $\\gamma$-ray bursts (LGRBs) and two\nultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), including their associated supernovae (SNe), show\nthat emission from a magnetar central engine cannot be solely responsible for\npowering an LGRB-SN. While the early AG-dominated phase can be well described\nwith our model, the predicted SN luminosity is underluminous by a factor of\n$3-17$. We use this as compelling evidence that additional sources of heating\nmust be present to power an LGRB-SN, which we argue must be radioactive\nheating. Our self-consistent modelling approach was able to successfully\ndescribe all phases of ULGRB 111209A / SN 2011kl, from the early afterglow to\nthe later SN, where we determined for the magnetar central engine a magnetic\nfield strength of $1.1-1.3\\times10^{15}$ G, an initial spin period of\n$11.5-13.0$ ms, a spin-down time of $4.8-6.5$ d, and an initial energy of\n$1.2-1.6\\times10^{50}$ erg. These values are entirely consistent with those\ndetermined by other authors. The luminosity of a magnetar-powered SN is\ndirectly related to how long the central engine is active, where central\nengines with longer durations give rise to brighter SNe. The spin-down\ntimescales of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are of order months to years,\nwhich provides a natural explanation as to why SN 2011kl was less luminous than\nSLSNe that are also powered by emission from magnetar central engines.\n", "  We show that the cumulative CO emission from galaxies throughout cosmic\nhistory distorts the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at a\nlevel that is well above the detection limit of future instruments, such as the\nPrimordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). The modeled CO signal has a prominent\nbump in the frequency interval 100-200 GHz, with a characteristic peak\nintensity of ~ 2$\\times$10$^{-23}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. Most of the\nCO foreground originates from modest redshifts, z ~ 2-5, and needs to be\nefficiently removed for more subtle distortions from the earlier universe to be\ndetected.\n", "  Empirical research has shown performance improvement of many different\ntechnological domains occurs exponentially but with widely varying improvement\nrates. What causes some technologies to improve faster than others do? Previous\nquantitative modeling research has identified artifact interactions, where a\ndesign change in one component influences others, as an important determinant\nof improvement rates. The models predict that improvement rate for a domain is\nproportional to the inverse of the domain interaction parameter. However, no\nempirical research has previously studied and tested the dependence of\nimprovement rates on artifact interactions. A challenge to testing the\ndependence is that any method for measuring interactions has to be applicable\nto a wide variety of technologies. Here we propose a patent-based method that\nis both technology domain-agnostic and less costly than alternative methods. We\nuse textual content from patent sets in 27 domains to find the influence of\ninteractions on improvement rates. Qualitative analysis identified six specific\nkeywords that signal artifact interactions. Patent sets from each domain were\nthen examined to determine the total count of these 6 keywords in each domain,\ngiving an estimate of artifact interactions in each domain. It is found that\nimprovement rates are positively correlated with the inverse of the total count\nof keywords with correlation coefficient of +0.56 with a p-value of 0.002. The\nempirical results agree with model predictions and support the suggestion that\ndomains with higher number of artifacts interactions (higher complexity) will\nimprove at a slower pace.\n", "  Charge and heat transport in nano-structures is dominated by non-equilibrium\neffects which strongly influence their behaviour. These effects are studied in\na setup consisting of three external leads, one of which is considered as a\nheat reservoir and is tunnel-coupled to two cold electrodes via two\nindependently controlled quantum dots. The energy flow from the hot electrode\ntogether with energy filtering provided by quantum dots leads to a voltage bias\nbetween the cold electrodes. The heat and charge currents in the device\neffectively flow in mutually perpendicular directions, allowing for their\nindependent control. The non-equilibrium screening changes the values of the\nsystem parameters needed for its optimal performance but leaves the maximal\noutput power and efficiency unchanged. Our results are important from the\ntheoretical point of view as well as for the practical implementation and the\ncontrol of the proposed heat engine.\n", "  The composition and structure of the upper atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant\nPlanets (EGPs) are affected by the high-energy spectrum of their host stars\nfrom soft X-rays to EUV. This emission depends on the activity level of the\nstar, which is primarily determined by its age. We focus upon EGPs orbiting K-\nand M-dwarf stars of different ages. XUV spectra for these stars are\nconstructed using a coronal model. These spectra are used to drive both a\nthermospheric model and an ionospheric model, providing densities of neutral\nand ion species. Ionisation is included through photo-ionisation and\nelectron-impact processes. We find that EGP ionospheres at all orbital\ndistances considered and around all stars selected are dominated by the\nlong-lived H$^+$ ion. In addition, planets with upper atmospheres where H$_2$\nis not substantially dissociated have a layer in which H$_3^+$ is the major ion\nat the base of the ionosphere. For fast-rotating planets, densities of\nshort-lived H$_3^+$ undergo significant diurnal variations, with the maximum\nvalue being driven by the stellar X-ray flux. In contrast, densities of\nlonger-lived H$^+$ show very little day/night variability and the magnitude is\ndriven by the level of stellar EUV flux. The H$_3^+$ peak in EGPs with upper\natmospheres where H$_2$ is dissociated under strong stellar illumination is\npushed to altitudes below the homopause, where this ion is likely to be\ndestroyed through reactions with heavy species. The inclusion of secondary\nionisation processes produces significantly enhanced ion and electron densities\nat altitudes below the main EUV ionisation peak, as compared to models that do\nnot include electron-impact ionisation. We estimate infrared emissions from\nH$_3^+$, and while, in an H/H$_2$/He atmosphere, these are larger from planets\norbiting close to more active stars, they still appear too low to be detected\nwith current observatories.\n", "  We provide CoRoT and Spitzer light curves, as well as broad-band\nmulti-wavelength photometry and high resolution, multi- and single-epoch\nspectroscopy for 17 classical T Tauris in NGC 2264 whose CoRoT light curves\n(LCs) exemplify the \"stochastic\" LC class as defined in Cody et al. (2014). The\nmost probable physical mechanism to explain the optical variability in this LC\nclass is time-dependent mass accretion onto the stellar photosphere, producing\ntransient hot spots. As evidence in favor of this hypothesis, multi-epoch high\nresolution spectra for a subset of these stars shows that their veiling levels\nalso vary in time and that this veiling variability is consistent in both\namplitude and timescale with the optical LC morphology. Furthermore, the\nveiling variability is well-correlated with the strength of the HeI 6678A\nemission line, a feature predicted by models to arise in accretion shocks on or\nnear the stellar photosphere. Stars with accretion burst LC morphology\n(Stauffer et al. 2014) are also attributed to variable mass accretion. Both the\nstochastic and accretion burst LCs can be explained by a simple model of\nrandomly occurring flux bursts, with the stochastic LC class having a higher\nfrequency of lower amplitude events. Based on their UV excesses, veiling, and\nmean Ha equivalent widths, members of the stochastic LC class have only\nmoderate time-averaged mass accretion rates. The most common feature of their\nHa profiles is for them to exhibit blue-shifted absorption features, most\nlikely originating in a disk wind. The lack of periodic signatures in the LCs\nsuggests that little of the variability is due to long-lived hot spots rotating\ninto or out of our line of sight; instead, the primary driver of the observed\nphotometric variability is likely to be instabilities in the inner disk that\nlead to variable mass accretion.\n", "  Relationships between beam power and accretion disk luminosity are studied\nfor a sample of 55 HERG, 13 LERG, and 29 RLQ with powerful outflows. The ratio\nof beam power to disk luminosity tends to be high for LERG, low for RLQ, and\nspans the full range of values for HERG. Writing general expressions for the\ndisk luminosity and beam power and applying the empirically determined\nrelationships allows a function that parameterizes the spins of the holes to be\nestimated. Interestingly, one of the solutions that is consistent with the data\nhas a functional form that is remarkably similar to that expected in the\ngeneralized Blandford-Znajek model with a magnetic field that is similar in\nform to that expected in MAD and ADAF models. Values of the spin function,\nobtained independent of specific outflow models, suggest that spin and AGN type\nare not related for these types of sources. The spin function can be used to\nsolve for black hole spin in the context of particular outflow models, and one\nexample is provided.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the mass-metallicity (MZ) relation with a\nlarge sample of 53,444 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $0.04<z<0.12$, selected\nfrom the catalog of MPA-JHU emission-line measurements for the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. Regarding the sample of SFGs, we correct the\nobservational bias and raise the aperture covering fractions to check the\nreliability of the metallicity evolution. We show that (1) the redshift\nevolution of log($\\rm H\\alpha$) and log(O III) luminosities is displayed in our\nsample; (2) we find the metallicity evolution of $\\sim 0.15$ dex at $\\rm log\n(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim9.3$ in SFGs at $0.04<z<0.12$; (3) after applying the\nluminosity thresholds of log$(L_{\\rm H \\alpha})>41.0$ and log$(L_{\\rm O\\\nIII})>39.7$, we find that metallicity evolution is shown well, and that SFR\nevolution still is shown well under the latter luminosity threshold, but the\nevolution is not observed under the former one; (4) the evolution of the MZ\nrelation seems to disappear at about $\\rm log(M_{*}/M_\\odot)>10.0$ after\napplying the luminosity threshold of log$(L_{\\rm H \\alpha})>41.0$ or\nlog$(L_{\\rm O\\ III})>39.7$; (5) we find $\\alpha =0.09$ and $\\alpha =0.07$ in\nthe equation ($\\mu={\\rm log}M_{*}-\\alpha \\rm log(SFR)$) for log$(L_{\\rm H\n\\alpha})>41.0$ and log$(L_{\\rm O\\ III})>39.7$ samples, respectively, and these\nimply that the evolution of the MZ relation may have a weaker dependence on SFR\nin our sample.\n", "  The uniform electron gas or UEG (also known as jellium) is one of the most\nfundamental models in condensed-matter physics and the cornerstone of the most\npopular approximation --- the local-density approximation --- within\ndensity-functional theory. In this article, we provide a detailed review on the\nenergetics of the UEG at high, intermediate and low densities, and in one, two\nand three dimensions. We also report the best quantum Monte Carlo and\nsymmetry-broken Hartree-Fock calculations available in the literature for the\nUEG and discuss the phase diagrams of jellium.\n", "  Kaon photoproduction on the proton is studied in the resonance region using\nan isobar model. The higher-spin nucleon (3/2 and 5/2) and hyperon (3/2)\nresonances were included in the model utilizing the consistent formalism by\nPascalutsa and they were found to play an important role in data description.\nThe spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 hyperon resonances in combination with the Born terms\ncontribute significantly to the background part of the amplitude. Various forms\nof the hadron form factor were considered in the construction and the dipole\nand multidipole forms were selected as those most suitable for the data\ndescription. Model parameters were fitted to new experimental data from CLAS,\nLEPS, and GRAAL collaborations and two versions of the model, BS1 and BS2, were\nchosen. Both models provide a good overall description of the data for the c.m.\nenergies from the threshold up to 2.4 GeV. Predicted cross sections of the\nmodels at very small kaon angles being consistent with results of the\nSaclay-Lyon model indicate that the models could be also successful in\npredicting the hypernucleus production cross sections. Although kaon\nphotoproduction takes place in the third-resonance region with many resonant\nstates, the total number of included resonances, 15 and 16, is quite moderate\nand it is comparable with numbers of resonances in other models. The set of\nchosen nucleon resonances overlaps well with the set of the most probable\ncontributing states determined in the Bayesian analysis with the\nRegge-plus-resonance model. Particularly, we confirm that the missing\nresonances $P_{13}(1900)$ and $D_{13}(1875)$ do play important role in the\ndescription of data. However, the spin-1/2 state $P_{11}(1880)$ included in the\nBayesian analysis was replaced in our analysis with the near-mass spin-5/2\nstate $N^*(1860)$, recently considered by the Particle Data Group.\n", "  We discuss some of the claims that have been made regarding the statistics of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs). In an earlier paper \\citep{2015arXiv150505535C} we\nconjectured that flicker noise associated with FRB repetition could show up in\nnon-cataclysmic neutron star emission models, like supergiant pulses. We show\nhow the current limits of repetition would be significantly weakened if their\nrepeat rate really were non-Poissonian and had a pink or red spectrum.\nRepetition and its statistics have implications for observing strategy,\ngenerally favouring shallow wide-field surveys, since in the non-repeating\nscenario survey depth is unimportant. We also discuss the statistics of the\napparent latitudinal dependence of FRBs, and offer a simple method for\ncalculating the significance of this effect. We provide a generalized Bayesian\nframework for addressing this problem, which allows for direct model\ncomparison. It is shown how the evidence for a steep latitudinal gradient of\nthe FRB rate is less strong than initially suggested and simple explanations\nlike increased scattering and sky temperature in the plane are sufficient to\ndecrease the low-latitude burst rate, given current data. The reported dearth\nof bursts near the plane is further complicated if FRBs have non-Poissonian\nrepetition, since in that case the event rate inferred from observation depends\non observing strategy.\n", "  Context. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data are extremely\nsensitive to the phase stability of the VLBI array. This is especially\nimportant when we reach {\\mu}Jy r.m.s. sensitivities. Calibration using\nstandard phase referencing techniques is often used to improve the phase\nstability of VLBI data but the results are often not optimal. This is evident\nin blank fields that do not have in-beam calibrators. Aims. We present a\ncalibration algorithm termed Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC) which can be\nused after standard phase referencing on wide-field VLBI observations. This is\ntested on a 1.6 GHz wide-field VLBI data set of the Hubble Deep Field-North and\nthe Hubble Flanking Fields. Methods. MSSC uses multiple target sources detected\nin the field via standard phase referencing techniques and modifies the\nvisibili- ties so that each data set approximates to a point source. These are\ncombined to increase the signal to noise and permit self-calibration. In\nprinciple, this should allow residual phase changes caused by the troposphere\nand ionosphere to be corrected. By means of faceting, the technique can also be\nused for direction dependent calibration. Results. Phase corrections, derived\nusing MSSC, were applied to a wide-field VLBI data set of the HDF-N comprising\nof 699 phase centres. MSSC was found to perform considerably better than\nstandard phase referencing and single source self-calibration. All detected\nsources exhibited dramatic improvements in dynamic range. Using MSSC, one\nsource reached the detection threshold taking the total detected sources to\ntwenty. 60% of these sources can now be imaged with uniform weighting compared\nto just 45% with standard phase referencing. The Parseltongue code which\nimplements MSSC has been released and made publicly available to the\nastronomical community (https://github.com/jradcliffe5/multi_self_cal).\n", "  Energy dependent phase lags reveal crucial information about the causal\nrelation between various spectral components and about the nature of the\naccretion geometry around the compact objects. The time-lag and the fractional\nroot mean square (rms) spectra of GRS 1915+105 in its heartbeat oscillation\nclass/$\\rho$ state show peculiar behaviour at the fundamental and harmonic\nfrequencies where the lags at the fundamental show a turn around at $\\sim$ 10\nkeV while the lags at the harmonic do not show any turn around at least till\n$\\sim$ 20 keV. The magnitude of lags are of the order of few seconds and hence\ncannot be attributed to the light travel time effects or Comptonization delays.\nThe continuum X-ray spectra can roughly be described by a disk blackbody and a\nhard X-ray power-law component and from phase resolved spectroscopy it has been\nshown that the inner disk radius varies during the oscillation. Here, we\npropose that there is a delayed response of the inner disk radius (DROID) to\nthe accretion rate such that $r_{in}(t)\\propto \\dot{m}^\\beta (t-\\tau_d)$. The\nfluctuating accretion rate drives the oscillations of the inner radius after a\ntime delay $\\tau_d$ while the power-law component responds immediately. We show\nthat in such a scenario a pure sinusoidal oscillation of the accretion rate can\nexplain not only the shape and magnitude of energy dependent rms and time-lag\nspectra at the fundamental but also the next harmonic with just four free\nparameters.\n", "  We investigate the spin injection and the spin transport in paramagnetic\ninsulators described by simple Heisenberg interactions using auxiliary particle\nmethods. Some of these methods allow access to both paramagnetic states above\nmagnetic transition temperatures and magnetic states at low temperatures. It is\npredicted that the spin injection at an interface with a normal metal is rather\ninsensitive to temperatures above the magnetic transition temperature. On the\nother hand below the transition temperature, it decreases monotonically and\ndisappears at zero temperature. We also analyze the bulk spin conductance. It\nis shown that the conductance becomes zero at zero temperature as predicted by\nlinear spin wave theory but increases with temperature and is maximized around\nthe magnetic transition temperature. These findings suggest that the compromise\nbetween the two effects determines the optimal temperature for spintronics\napplications utilizing magnetic insulators.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to provide new insights on the origin of the\nobservable flux of gamma rays from HESS J1809-193 using new high-quality\nobservations in the radio domain. We used the Expanded Very Large Array (now\nknown as the Karl G. Jansky Very large Array, JVLA) to produce a deep\nfull-synthesis imaging at 1.4 GHz of the vicinity of PSR J1809-1917. These data\nwere used in conjunction with 12CO observations from the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope in the transition line J=3-2 and atomic hydrogen data from the\nSouthern Galactic Plane Survey to investigate the properties of the\ninterstellar medium in the direction of the source HESS J1809-193. The new\nradio continuum image, obtained with a synthesized beam of 8\"x4\" and a\nsensitivity of 0.17 mJy/beam, reveals with unprecedented detail all the\nintensity structures in the field. No radio counterpart to the observed X-ray\nemission supposed to be a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1809-1917 is seen\nin the new JVLA image. We discovered a system of molecular clouds on the edge\nof the supernova remnant (SNR) G11.0-0.0 shock front, which is positionally\ncoincident with the brightest part of the TeV source HESS J1809-193. We\ndetermine, on the basis of kinematic and morphological evidences, a physical\nlink of the SNR with the clouds for which we estimated a total (molecular plus\natomic) mass of ~3 x10^3 Mo and a total proton density in the range 2-3 x 10^3\ncm-3. We propose as the most likely origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray\nradiation from HESS J1809-193 a hadronic mechanism through collisions of ions\naccelerated at the SNR G11.0-0.0 shock with the molecular matter in the\nvicinity of the remnant.\n", "  We want to determine the lithium abundances of solar twin stars as a function\nof stellar age to provide constraints for stellar evolutions models and to\ninvestigate whether there is a connection between low Li abundance and the\noccurrence of planets. For a sample of 21 solar twins observed with the HARPS\nspectrograph at high spectral resolution (R~115.000) and very high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (600 < S/N < 2400), precise lithium abundances were\nobtained by spectral synthesis of the LiI 6707.8 A line and compared to stellar\nages, masses, and metallicities determined from a spectroscopic analysis of the\nsame set of HARPS spectra. We show that for the large majority of the solar\ntwins there is a strong correlation between lithium abundance and stellar age.\nAs the age increases from 1 to 9 Gyr, the Li abundance decreases by a factor of\n~ 50. The relation agrees fairly well with predictions from non-standard\nstellar evolution models of Li destruction at the bottom of the upper\nconvection zone. Two stars deviate from the relation by having Li abundances\nenhanced by a factor of ~ 10, which may be due to planet engulfment. On the\nother hand, we find no indication of a link between planet hosting stars and\nenhanced lithium depletion.\n", "  We analyzed a 115 ks XMM-Newton observation and the stacking of 8 days of\nINTEGRAL observations, taken during the raise of the 2015 outburst of the\naccreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. The source showed numerous\ntype-I burst episodes during the XMM-Newton observation, and for this reason we\nstudied separately the persistent and burst epochs. We described the persistent\nemission with a combination of two soft thermal components, a cold thermal\nComptonization component (~2 keV) and an additional hard X-ray emission\ndescribed by a power-law (photon index ~2.3). The continuum components can be\nassociated with an accretion disc, the neutron star (NS) surface and a thermal\nComptonization emission coming out of an optically thick plasma region, while\nthe origin of the high energy tail is still under debate. In addition, a number\nof broad (~0.1-0.4 keV) emission features likely associated to reflection\nprocesses have been observed in the XMM-Newton data. The estimated 1.0-50 keV\nunabsorbed luminosity of the source is ~5x10^37 erg/s, about 25% of the\nEddington limit assuming a 1.4 solar mass NS. We suggest that the spectral\nproperties of SAX J1748.9-2021 are consistent with a soft state, differently\nfrom many other accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars which are usually found in\nthe hard state. Moreover, none of the observed type-I burst reached the\nEddington luminosity. Assuming that the burst ignition and emission are\nproduced above the whole NS surface, we estimate a neutron star radius of ~7-8\nkm, consistent with previous results.\n", "  So far we have not been able to establish that, as theoretically expected,\nneutrinos are their own anti-particles. Here we propose a dynamical way to\naccount for the Dirac nature of neutrinos and the smallness of their mass in\nterms of a new variant of the seesaw paradigm in which the energy scale of\nneutrino mass generation could be accessible to the current LHC experiments.\n", "  We investigate the gas mass distribution in the high redshift cluster MS\n1054-0321 using Chandra X-ray and OCRA SZ effect data. We use a superposition\nof offset $\\beta$-type models to describe the composite structure of MS\n1054-0321. We find gas mass fractions $f_{gas}^\\rm{X\\mbox{-}ray} =\n0.087_{-0.001}^{+0.005}$ and $f_{gas}^\\rm{SZ} = 0.094_{-0.001}^{+0.003}$ for\nthe (main) eastern component of MS 1054-0321 using X-ray or SZ data, but\n$f_{gas}^\\rm{X\\mbox{-}ray} = 0.030 _{-0.014}^{+0.010}$ for the western\ncomponent. The gas mass fraction for the eastern component is in agreement with\nsome results reported in the literature, but inconsistent with the cosmic\nbaryon fraction. The low gas mass fraction for the western component is likely\nto be a consequence of gas stripping during the ongoing merger. The gas mass\nfraction of the integrated system is $0.060_{-0.009}^{+0.004}$: we suggest that\nthe missing baryons from the western component are present as hot diffuse gas\nwhich is poorly represented in existing X-ray images. The missing gas could\nappear in sensitive SZ maps.\n", "  An extended XMM-Newton observation of the luminous narrow line Seyfert galaxy\nPG 1211+143 in 2014 has revealed a more complex highly ionized, high velocity\noutflow. The detection of previously unresolved spectral structure in Fe K\nabsorption finds a second outflow velocity component of the highly ionized\nwind, with an outflow velocity of v~0.066+/-0.003c, in addition to a still\nhigher velocity outflow of v~0.129+/-0.002c consistent with that first seen in\n2001. We note that chaotic accretion, consisting of many prograde and\nretrograde events, offers an intriguing explanation of the dual velocity wind.\nIn that context the persisting outflow velocities could relate to physically\ndistinct orientations of the inner accretion flow, with prograde accretion\nyielding a higher launch velocity than retrograde accretion in a ratio close to\nthat observed.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Chaplygin gas Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz quantum\ncosmology. Using Schutz formalism and Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition, we\nobtain the corresponding Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We obtain\nexact classical and quantum mechanical solutions and construct wave packets to\nstudy the time evolution of the expectation value of the scale factor for two\ncases. We show that unlike classical solutions and upon choosing appropriate\ninitial conditions, the expectation value of the scale factor never tends to\nthe singular point which exhibits the singularity-free behavior of the\nsolutions in the quantum domain.\n", "  Significant reservoirs of cool gas are observed in the circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) surrounding galaxies. The CGM is also found to contain substantial\namounts of metals and dust, which require some transport mechanism. We consider\nAGN (active galactic nucleus) feedback-driven outflows based on radiation\npressure on dust. Dusty gas is ejected when the central luminosity exceeds the\neffective Eddington luminosity for dust. We obtain that a higher dust-to-gas\nratio leads to a lower critical luminosity, implying that the more dusty gas is\nmore easily expelled. Dusty outflows can reach large radii with a range of\nvelocities (depending on the outflowing shell configuration and the ambient\ndensity distribution) and may account for the observed CGM gas. In our picture,\ndust is required in order to drive AGN feedback, and the preferential expulsion\nof dusty gas in the outflows may naturally explain the presence of dust in the\nCGM. On the other hand, the most powerful AGN outflow events can potentially\ndrive gas out of the local galaxy group. We further discuss the effects of\nradiation pressure of the central AGN on satellite galaxies. AGN radiative\nfeedback may therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of the whole\nsurrounding environment.\n", "  This paper is a sequel to the extensive study of warm absorber (WA) in X-rays\ncarried out using high resolution grating spectral data from XMM-Newton\nsatellite (WAX-I). Here we discuss the global dynamical properties as well as\nthe energetics of the WA components detected in the WAX sample. The slope of WA\ndensity profile ($n\\propto r^{-\\alpha}$) estimated from the linear regression\nslope of ionization parameter $\\xi$ and column density $N_H$ in the WAX sample\nis $\\alpha=1.236\\pm 0.034$. We find that the WA clouds possibly originate as a\nresult of photo-ionised evaporation from the inner edge of the torus (torus\nwind). They can also originate in the cooling front of the shock generated by\nfaster accretion disk outflows, the ultra-fast outflows (UFO), impinging onto\nthe interstellar medium or the torus. The acceleration mechanism for the WA is\ncomplex and neither radiatively driven wind nor MHD driven wind scenario alone\ncan describe the outflow acceleration. However, we find that radiative forces\nplay a significant role in accelerating the WA through the soft X-ray\nabsorption lines, and also with dust opacity. Given the large uncertainties in\nthe distance and volume filling factor estimates of the WA, we conclude that\nthe kinetic luminosity $\\dot{E}_k$ of WA may sometimes be large enough to yield\nsignificant feedback to the host galaxy. We find that the lowest ionisation\nstates carry the maximum mass outflow, and the sources with higher Fe M UTA\nabsorption ($15-17\\rm \\AA$) have more mass outflow rates.\n", "  Extended dark matter (DM) substructures may play the role of microlenses in\nthe Milky Way and in extragalactic gravitational lens systems (GLSs). We\ncompare microlensing effects caused by point masses (Schwarzschild lenses) and\nextended clumps of matter using a simple model for the lens mapping. A\nsuperposition of the point mass and the extended clump is also considered. For\nspecial choices of the parameters, this model may represent a cusped clump of\ncold DM, a cored clump of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) or an ultra\ncompact minihalo of DM surrounding a massive point-like object. We built the\nresulting micro-amplification curves for various parameters of one clump moving\nwith respect to the source in order to estimate differences between the light\ncurves caused by clumps and by point lenses. The results show that it may be\ndifficult to distinguish between these models. However, some region of the\nclump parameters can be restricted by considering the high amplification events\nat the present level of photometric accuracy. Then we estimate the statistical\nproperties of the amplification curves in extragalactic GLSs. For this purpose,\nan ensemble of amplification curves is generated yielding the autocorrelation\nfunctions (ACFs) of the curves for different choices of the system parameters.\nWe find that there can be a significant difference between these ACFs if the\nclump size is comparable with typical Einstein radii; as a rule, the\ncontribution of clumps makes the ACFs less steep.\n", "  We study the functioning of a three-level thermal machine when acting on a\nmany-qubit system, the entire system being placed in an electromagnetic field\nin a stationary out-of-thermal-equilibrium configuration. This realistic setup\nstands in between the two so-far explored cases of single-qubit and macroscopic\nobject targets, providing information on the scaling with system size of purely\nquantum properties in thermodynamic contexts. We show that, thanks to the\npresence of robust correlations among the qubits induced by the field,\nthermodynamic tasks can be delivered by the machine both locally to each qubit\nand collectively to the many-qubit system: this allows a task to be delivered\nalso on systems much bigger than the machine size.\n", "  Triggering mechanisms of solar eruptions have long been a challenge. A few\nprevious case studies have indicated that preceding gentle filament merging via\nmagnetic reconnection may launch following intense eruption, according with the\ntether-cutting (TC) model. However, detailed process of TC reconnection between\nfilaments has not been exhibited yet. In this work, we report the high\nresolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS)\nof TC reconnection between two sheared filaments in NOAA active region 12146.\nThe TC reconnection commenced since 15:35 UT on 2014 August 29 and triggered an\neruptive GOES C4.3-class flare 8 minutes later. An associated coronal mass\nejection appeared in the field of view of SOHO/LASCO C2 about 40 minutes later.\nThanks to the high spatial resolution of IRIS data, bright plasma outflows\ngenerated by the TC reconnection are clearly observed, which moved along the\nsubarcsecond fine-scale flux tube structures in the erupting filament. Based on\nthe imaging and spectral observations, the mean plane-of-sky and line-of-sight\nvelocities of the TC reconnection outflows are separately measured to be 79 and\n86 km/s, which derives an average real speed of 120 km/s. In addition, it is\nfound that spectral features, such as peak intensities, Doppler shifts, and\nline widths in the TC reconnection region evidently enhanced compared with\nthose in the nearby region just before the flare.\n", "  We present near infrared imaging and integral field spectroscopy of the\ncentre of the dusty luminous infrared galaxy merger MCG+08-11-002, taken using\nthe Near InfraRed Camera 2 (NIRC2) and the OH-Suppressing InfraRed Imaging\nSpectrograph (OSIRIS) on Keck II. We achieve a spatial resolution of ~25 pc in\nthe K band, allowing us to resolve 41 star clusters in the NIRC2 images. We\ncalculate the ages of 22/25 star clusters within the OSIRIS field using the\nequivalent widths of the CO 2.3$\\mu$m absorption feature and the Br$\\gamma$\nnebular emission line. The star cluster age distribution has a clear peak at\nages < 20 Myr, indicative of current starburst activity associated with the\nfinal coalescence of the progenitor galaxies. There is a possible second peak\nat ~65 Myr which may be a product of the previous close passage of the galaxy\nnuclei. We fit single and double starburst models to the star cluster age\ndistribution and use Monte Carlo sampling combined with two-sided K-S tests to\ncalculate the probability that the observed data are drawn from each of the\nbest fit distributions. There is a >90 per cent chance that the data are drawn\nfrom either a single or double starburst star formation history, but stochastic\nsampling prevents us from distinguishing between the two scenarios. Our\nanalysis of MCG+08-11-002 indicates that star cluster age distributions provide\nvaluable insights into the timelines of galaxy interactions and may therefore\nplay an important role in the future development of precise merger stage\nclassification systems.\n", "  Small angle scattering by dust grains causes a significant contribution to\nthe total interstellar extinction for any X-ray instrument with sub-arcminute\nresolution (Chandra, Swift, XMM-Newton). However, the dust scattering component\nis not included in the current absorption models: phabs, tbabs, and tbnew. We\nsimulate a large number of Chandra spectra to explore the bias in the spectral\nfit and NH measurements obtained without including extinction from dust\nscattering. We find that without incorporating dust scattering, the measured NH\nwill be too large by a baseline level of 25%. This effect is modulated by the\nimaging resolution of the telescope, because some amount of unresolved\nscattered light will be captured within the aperture used to extract point\nsource information. In high resolution spectroscopy, dust scattering\nsignificantly enhances the total extinction optical depth and the shape of the\nphotoelectric absorption edges. We focus in particular on the Fe-L edge at 0.7\nkeV, showing that the total extinction template fits well to the high\nresolution spectrum of three X-ray binaries from the Chandra archive: GX 9+9,\nXTE J1817-330, and Cyg X-1. In cases where dust is intrinsic to the source, a\ncovering factor based on the angular extent of the dusty material must be\napplied to the extinction curve, regardless of angular imaging resolution. This\napproach will be particularly relevant for dust in quasar absorption line\nsystems and might constrain clump sizes in active galactic nuclei.\n", "  Gaia, the European Space Agency spacecraft successfully launched on 19\nDecember 2013, entered into nominal science operations on 18 July 2014 after a\nfew months of commissioning, and has been scanning the sky to a faint limit of\nG = 20.7 mag since then. Gaia is expected to observe more than a hundred\nthousand RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic halo and bulge (most of which will be\nnew discoveries), and to provide parallax measurements with about 10 {\\mu}as\nuncertainty for those brighter than <V>$\\sim$ 12-13 mag. Status and activities\nof the spacecraft since launch are briefly reviewed with emphasis on\npreliminary results obtained for RR Lyrae stars observed in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud during the first 28 days of science operations spent in\nEcliptic Pole scanning mode and in light of the first Gaia data release which\nis scheduled for summer 2016.\n", "  MnTiO3 has been studied for many decades, but it was only in the last few\nyears that its strong magnetoelectric behavior had been observed. Here, we use\nneutron scattering on two separately grown single crystals and two powder\nsamples to show the presence of a supercell that breaks R-3 symmetry. We also\npresent the temperature and field dependence of the dielectric constant and\npyroelectric current, and show evidence of non-zero off-diagonal\nmagnetoelectric tensor elements (forbidden by R-3 symmetry) followed by a\npolarization flop accompanying the spin flop transition at {\\mu}0HSF = 6.5 T.\nM\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy on MnTiO3 gently doped with 57Fe was used to help shed\nlight on the impact of the supercell on the observed behavior. Although the\nfull supercell structure could not be solved at this time due to a lack of\nvisible reflections, the full-scope of the results presented here suggest that\nthe role of local spin-lattice coupling in the magnetoelectric properties of\nMnTiO3 is likely more important than previously thought.\n", "  Observational advancements are leading to increasingly precise measurements\nof super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used in internal\nstructure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now\ncritically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the\npredicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice\njustified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is\nsmall. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be\nsignificant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal\neffects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of\nmasses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We\ndeveloped temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich\nsuper-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation\nof state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their\nradii. For example, for super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius\nincreases by up to 0.5$\\,$R$_\\oplus$ when the surface temperature is increased\nfrom 300 to 1000$\\,$K, assuming a surface pressure of 100$\\,$bar and an\nadiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger\nat lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing\nthe water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are\ncomparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be\nbetter than 0.1$\\,$R$_\\oplus$. It is therefore important to ensure that the\nthermal behaviour of water is taken into account when interpreting super-Earth\nradii using internal structure models.\n", "  Various unification schemes interpret the complex phenomenology of quasars\nand luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) in terms of a simple picture\ninvolving a central black hole, an accretion disc and an associated outflow.\nHere, we continue our tests of this paradigm by comparing quasar spectra to\nsynthetic spectra of biconical disc wind models, produced with our\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. Previously, we have shown\nthat we could produce synthetic spectra resembling those of observed broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasars, but only if the X-ray luminosity was limited to\n$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Here, we introduce a simple treatment of clumping, and\nfind that a filling factor of $\\sim0.01$ moderates the ionization state\nsufficiently for BAL features to form in the rest-frame UV at more realistic\nX-ray luminosities. Our fiducial model shows good agreement with AGN X-ray\nproperties and the wind produces strong line emission in, e.g., Ly \\alpha\\ and\nCIV 1550\\AA\\ at low inclinations. At high inclinations, the spectra possess\nprominent LoBAL features. Despite these successes, we cannot reproduce all\nemission lines seen in quasar spectra with the correct equivalent-width ratios,\nand we find an angular dependence of emission-line equivalent width despite the\nsimilarities in the observed emission line properties of BAL and non-BAL\nquasars. Overall, our work suggests that biconical winds can reproduce much of\nthe qualitative behaviour expected from a unified model, but we cannot yet\nprovide quantitative matches with quasar properties at all viewing angles.\nWhether disc winds can successfully unify quasars is therefore still an open\nquestion.\n", "  The level-resolved radiative recombination (RR) rate coefficients for H-like\nto Na-like ions from H (Z = 1) up to and including Zn (Z = 30) are studied\nhere. For H-like ions, the quantum-mechanical exact photoionization cross\nsections for nonrelativistic hydrogenic systems are used to calculate the RR\nrate coefficients under the principle of detailed balance, while for He-like to\nNa-like ions, the archival data on ADAS are adopted. Parameterizations are made\nfor the direct capture rates in a wide temperature range. The fitting\naccuracies are better than 5% for about 99% of the 30, 000 levels considered\nhere. The 1% exceptions include levels from low- charged many-electron ions,\nand/or high-shell (n>=4) levels are less important in terms of interpreting\nX-ray emitting astrophysical plasmas. The RR data will be incorporated into the\nhigh-resolution spectral analysis package SPEX.\n", "  We present three dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of a\nprecessing jet interacting with the intracluster medium and compare the\nsimulated jet structure with the observed structure of the Hydra A northern\njet. For the simulations, we use jet parameters obtained in the parameter space\nstudy of the first paper in this series and probe different values for the\nprecession period and precession angle. We find that for a precession period P\n= 1 Myr and a precession angle = 20 degree the model reproduces i) the\ncurvature of the jet, ii) the correct number of bright knots within 20 kpc at\napproximately correct locations, and iii) the turbulent transition of the jet\nto a plume. The Mach number of the advancing bow shock = 1.85 is indicative of\ngentle cluster atmosphere heating during the early stages of the AGN's\nactivity.\n", "  We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between\na 10 Jupiter mass planet and a red or asymptotic giant branch stars, both with\na zero-age main sequence mass of 3.5 $M_\\odot$. Dynamic in-spiral timescales\nare of the order of few years and a few decades for the red and asymptotic\ngiant branch stars, respectively. The planets will eventually be destroyed at a\nseparation from the core of the giants smaller than the resolution of our\nsimulations, either through evaporation or tidal disruption. As the planets\nin-spiral, the giant stars' envelopes are somewhat puffed up. Based on\nrelatively long timescales and even considering the fact that further in-spiral\nshould take place before the planets are destroyed, we predict that the merger\nwould be difficult to observe, with only a relatively small, slow brightening.\nVery little mass is unbound in the process. These conclusions may change if the\nplanet's orbit enhances the star's main pulsation modes. Based on the angular\nmomentum transfer, we also suspect that this star-planet interaction may be\nunable to lead to large scale outflows via the rotation-mediated dynamo effect\nof Nordhaus and Blackman. Detectable pollution from the destroyed planets would\nonly result for the lightest, lowest metallicity stars. We furthermore find\nthat in both simulations the planets move through the outer stellar envelopes\nat Mach-3 to Mach-5, reaching Mach-1 towards the end of the simulations. The\ngravitational drag force decreases and the in-spiral slows down at the sonic\ntransition, as predicted analytically.\n", "  In the evolution of late universe, the main source of matter are Dark energy\nand Dark matter. They are indirectly detected only through their gravitational\nmanifestations. So the possibility of interaction with each other without\nviolating observational restrictions is not ruled out. With this motivation, we\ninvestigate the dynamics of DGP braneworld where source of dark energy is a\nscalar field and it interacts with matter source. Since observation favours\nphantom case more, we have also studied the dynamics of interacting phantom\nscalar field. In non interacting DGP braneworld there are no late time\naccelerated scaling attractors and hence cannot alleviate Coincidence problem.\nIn this paper, we shall show that it is possible to get late time accelerated\nscaling solutions. The phase space is studied by taking two categories of\npotentials (Exponential and Non exponential functions). The stability of\ncritical points are examined by taking two specific interactions. The first\ninteraction gives late time accelerated scaling solution for phantom field only\nunder exponential potential, while for second interaction we do not get any\nscaling solution. Furthermore, we have shown that this scaling solution is also\nclassically stable.\n", "  In this Letter we demonstrate that the two claims of $z\\simeq 0.03$ OVII\nK$\\alpha$ absorption lines from Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) along the\nlines of sight to the blazars H~2356-309 (Buote et al., 2009; Fang et al.,\n2010) and Mkn~501 (Ren, Fang \\& Buote, 2014) are likely misidentifications of\nthe $z=0$ OII K$\\beta$ line produced by a diffuse Low-Ionization Metal Medium\nin the Galaxy's Interstellar and Circum-Galactic mediums. We perform detailed\nmodeling of all the available high signal-to-noise Chandra LETG and XMM-Newton\nRGS spectra of H 2356-309 and Mkn 501 and demonstrate that the $z\\simeq 0.03$\nWHIM absorption along these two sightlines is statistically not required. Our\nresults, however, do not rule out a small contribution from the $z\\simeq 0.03$\nOVII K$\\alpha$ absorber along the line of sight to H~2356-309. In our model the\ntemperature of the putative $z = 0.031$ WHIM filament is T$= 3\\times 10^5$ K\nand the OVII column density is N$_{OV II} \\le 4\\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$,\ntwenty times smaller than the OVII column density previously reported, and now\nmore consistent with the expectations from cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations.\n", "  Two energetic millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within globular clusters (GC),\nJ1823-3021A in NGC 6624 and PSR B1821-24 in M28, have been recently discovered\nto emit pulsed GeV gamma-rays. These MSPs are expected to eject energetic\nleptons. Therefore, GCs have been proposed to produce GeV-TeV gamma-rays as a\nresult of the comptonization process of the background radiation within a GC.\nWe develop this general scenario by taking into account not only the diffusion\nprocess of leptons within a GC but also their advection with the wind from the\nGC. Moreover, we consider distribution of MSP within a GC and the effects\nrelated to the non-central location of the dominating, energetic MSP. Such more\ncomplete scenario is considered for the modelling of the GeV-TeV gamma-ray\nemission from the core collapsed GC M15 and also for GCs which contain recently\ndiscovered energetic MSPs within NGC 6624 and M28. The confrontation of the\nmodelling of the gamma-ray emission with the observations with the present\nCherenkov telescopes and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) allows to\nconstrain more reliably the efficiency of lepton production within the inner\nmagnetosphere of the MSPs and re-accelerated in their vicinity. We discuss the\nexpected limits on this parameter in the context of expectations from the\npulsar models. we conclude that deep observations of GCs, even with the present\nsensitivity of Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS), should start to\nconstrain the models for the acceleration and radiation processes of leptons\nwithin the inner pulsar magnetosphere and its surrounding.\n", "  The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of\n(astro-)physical investigations. In particular arrays of pulsars with\nrotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect\ncorrelated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such\n\"Pulsar Timing Arrays\" (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past\ndecades and collectively form the \"International\" PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we\ndescribe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs,\ni.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the\napproach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for\nfuture PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as\nunderestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have\noften been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and\ninhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that\ncomplicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing\nefforts. The first IPTA data release presented here (and available online) is\nused to demonstrate the IPTA's potential of improving upon gravitational-wave\nlimits placed by individual PTAs by a factor of ~2 and provides a 2-sigma limit\non the dimensionless amplitude of a stochastic GWB of 1.7x10^{-15} at a\nfrequency of 1 yr^{-1}. This is 1.7 times less constraining than the limit\nplaced by (Shannon et al. 2015), due mostly to the more recent, high-quality\ndata they used.\n", "  In this paper we present new AAOmega spectroscopy of 254 galaxies within a\n30' radius around Abell 3888. We combine these data with the existing redshifts\nmeasured in a one degree radius around the cluster and performed a substructure\nanalysis. We confirm 71 member galaxies within the core of A3888 and determine\na new average redshift and velocity dispersion for the cluster of 0.1535 +\\-\n0.0009 and 1181 +\\- 197 km/s, respectively. The cluster is elongated along an\nEast-West axis and we find the core is bimodal along this axis with two\nsub-groups of 26 and 41 members detected. Our results suggest that A3888 is a\nmerging system putting to rest the previous conjecture about the morphological\nstatus of the cluster derived from X-ray observations. In addition to the\nresults on A3888 we also present six newly detected galaxy over-densities in\nthe field, three of which we classify as new galaxy clusters.\n", "  On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a\ntransient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency\nfrom 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of $1.0 \\times\n10^{-21}$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the\ninspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting\nsingle black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1\nevent per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1\n{\\sigma}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc\ncorresponding to a redshift $z = 0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$. In the source frame,\nthe initial black hole masses are $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}\nM_\\odot$, and the final black hole mass is $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\\odot$, with\n$3.0^{+0.5}_{-0.5} M_\\odot c^2$ radiated in gravitational waves. All\nuncertainties define 90% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the\nexistence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct\ndetection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black\nhole merger.\n", "  Near field cosmology is practiced by studying the Local Group (LG) and its\nneighbourhood. The present paper describes a framework for simulating the near\nfield on the computer. Assuming the LCDM model as a prior and applying the\nBayesian tools of the Wiener filter (WF) and constrained realizations of\nGaussian fields to the Cosmicflows-2 (CF2) survey of peculiar velocities,\nconstrained simulations of our cosmic environment are performed. The aim of\nthese simulations is to reproduce the LG and its local environment. Our main\nresult is that the LG is likely a robust outcome of the LCDM scenario when\nsubjected to the constraint derived from CF2 data, emerging in an environment\nakin to the observed one. Three levels of criteria are used to define the\nsimulated LGs. At the base level, pairs of halos must obey specific isolation,\nmass and separation criteria. At the second level the orbital angular momentum\nand energy are constrained and on the third one the phase of the orbit is\nconstrained. Out of the 300 constrained simulations 146 LGs obey the first set\nof criteria, 51 the second and 6 the third. The robustness of our LG factory\nenables the construction of a large ensemble of simulated LGs. Suitable\ncandidates for high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the LG can be\ndrawn from this ensemble, which can be used to perform comprehensive studies of\nthe formation of the LG\n", "  In ghost imaging with narrow-band signal in thermal light background, signal\narm filters bring higher value and upper limit of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nand faster speed to reach that limit. The narrower bandwidth, the better.\n", "  Evaluation of nuclear data for production routes of $^{110m}$In is in\nprogress in the frame of an IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP). New\nexperimental cross section data for the indirect $^{nat}$In(p,x)$^{110}$Sn\n$\\longrightarrow$ $^{110m}$In and for the direct\n$^{107}$Ag($\\alpha$,n)$^{110m}$In and $^{109}$Ag($^{3}$He,2n)$^{110m}$In\nproduction routes and for the satellite impurity reactions\n$^{107}$Ag($\\alpha$,xn)$^{110g,109}$In and\n$^{109}$Ag($^{3}$He,xn)$^{110g,111,109}$In have been measured by using the\nactivation method, stacked foil irradiation technique and gamma-ray\nspectrometry. Additional data are reported for production of the $^{111}$In\ndiagnostic gamma-emitter via the $^{109}$Ag($\\alpha$,2n)$^{111}$In reaction.\nThe earlier experimental data were critically reviewed in order to prepare\nrecommended data and optimal production parameters for the different routes.\n", "  We present an analysis of the 2013 Suzaku campaign on the nearby luminous\nquasar PDS 456, covering a total duration of ~1 Ms and a net exposure of 455\nks. During these observations, the X-ray flux was suppressed by a factor of >10\nin the soft X-ray band when compared to other epochs. We investigated the\nbroadband continuum by constructing a spectral energy distribution, making use\nof the optical/UV photometry and hard X-ray spectra from the later\nXMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign in 2014. The high energy part of this low flux state\ncannot be accounted for by self-consistent accretion disc and corona models\nwithout attenuation by absorbing gas, which partially covers a substantial\nfraction of the line of sight towards the X-ray source. Two absorption layers\nare required, of column density $\\log (N_{\\rm{H,low}}/{\\rm\ncm^{-2}})=22.3\\pm0.1$ and $\\log (N_{\\rm{H,high}}/{\\rm cm^{-2}})=23.2\\pm0.1$,\nwith average covering factors of ~80% (with typical 5% variations) and 60%\n($\\pm$10-15%), respectively. In these observations PDS 456 displays significant\nshort term X-ray spectral variability, on timescales of ~100 ks, which can be\naccounted for by variable covering of the absorbing gas. The partial covering\nabsorber prefers an outflow velocity of $v_{\\rm pc} = 0.25^{+0.01}_{-0.05}c$ at\nthe >99.9% confidence level over the case where $v_{\\rm pc}=0$. This is\nconsistent with the velocity of the highly ionised outflow responsible for the\nblueshifted iron K absorption profile. We therefore suggest that the partial\ncovering clouds could be the denser, or clumpy part of an inhomogeneous\naccretion disc wind. Finally we estimate the size-scale of the X-ray source\nfrom its variability. The radial extent of the X-ray emitter is found to be of\nthe order ~15-20 $R_{\\rm g}$, although the hard X-ray (>2 keV) emission may\noriginate from a more compact or patchy corona of hot electrons, which is ~6-8\n$R_{\\rm g}$ in size.\n", "  We present 1D cosmic ray transport models, numerically solving equations of\npure advection and diffusion for the electrons and calculating synchrotron\nemission spectra. We find that for exponential halo magnetic field\ndistributions advection leads to approximately exponential radio continuum\nintensity profiles, whereas diffusion leads to profiles that can be better\napproximated by a Gaussian function. Accordingly, the vertical radio spectral\nprofiles for advection are approximately linear, whereas for diffusion they are\nof `parabolic' shape. We compare our models with deep ATCA observations of two\nedge-on galaxies, NGC 7090 and 7462, at $\\lambda\\lambda$ 22 and 6 cm. Our\nresult is that the cosmic ray transport in NGC 7090 is advection dominated with\n$V=150^{+80}_{-30}~\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$, and that the one in NGC 7462 is diffusion\ndominated with $D=3.0\\pm 1.0 \\times 10^{28}E_{\\rm GeV}^{0.5}~\\rm cm^2\\,s^{-1}$.\nNGC 7090 has both a thin and thick radio disc with respective magnetic field\nscale heights of $h_{\\rm B1}=0.8\\pm 0.1$ kpc and $h_{\\rm B2}=4.7\\pm 1.0$ kpc.\nNGC 7462 has only a thick radio disc with $h_{\\rm B2}=3.8\\pm 1.0$ kpc. In both\ngalaxies, the magnetic field scale heights are significantly smaller than what\nestimates from energy equipartition would suggest. A non-negligible fraction of\ncosmic ray electrons can escape from NGC 7090, so that this galaxy is not an\nelectron calorimeter.\n", "  The variational Monte Carlo method is applied to investigate the ground state\nenergy of the lithium atom and its ions up to Z=10 in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field regime with {\\gamma}=0 ~ 100 a.u. Our calculations are\nbased on using three forms of compact and accurate trial wave functions, which\nwere put forward in calculating energies in the absence of magnetic field. The\nobtained results are in good agreement with the most recent accurate values and\nalso with the exact values.\n", "  We present our optical photometric observations of three TeV blazars, PKS\n1510-089, PG 1553+113 and Mrk 501 taken using two telescopes in India, one in\nBulgaria, one in Greece and one in Serbia during 2012 - 2014. These\nobservations covered a total of 95 nights with a total of 202 B filter frames,\n247 images in V band, 817 in R band while 229 images were taken in the I\nfilter. This work is focused on multi-band flux and colour variability studies\nof these blazars on diverse timescales which are useful in understanding the\nemission mechanisms. We studied the variability characteristics of above three\nblazars and found all to be active over our entire observational campaigns. We\nalso searched for any correlation between the brightness of the sources and\ntheir colour indices. During the times of variability, no significant evidence\nfor the sources to display spectral changes correlated with magnitude was found\non timescales of a few months. We briefly discuss the possible physical\nmechanisms most likely responsible for the observed flux variability.\n", "  We consider a fast magnetosonic multifluid shock as a representation of the\nsolar-wind termination shock. We assume the action of the transition happens in\na three-step process: In the first step, the upstream supersonic solar-wind\nplasma is subject to a strong electric field that flashes up on a small\ndistance scale $\\Delta z\\simeq U_1/ \\Omega _{\\mathrm e}$ (first part of the\ntransition layer), where $\\Omega_{\\mathrm e}$ is the electron gyro-frequency\nand $U_1$ is the upstream speed. This electric field both decelerates the\nsupersonic ion flow and accelerates the electrons up to high velocities. In\nthis part of the transition region, the electric forces connected with the\ndeceleration of the ion flow strongly dominate over the Lorentz forces. We,\ntherefore, call this part the demagnetization region. In the second phase,\nLorentz forces due to convected magnetic fields compete with the electric\nfield, and the highly anisotropic and energetic electron distribution function\nis converted into a shell distribution with energetic shell electrons storing\nabout 3/4 of the upstream ion kinetic energy. In the third phase, the plasma\nparticles thermalize due to the relaxation of free energy by plasma\ninstabilities. The first part of the transition region opens up a new\nthermodynamic degree of freedom never before taken into account for the\nelectrons, since the electrons are usually considered to be enslaved to follow\nthe behavior of the protons in all velocity moments like density, bulk\nvelocity, and temperature. We show that electrons may be the downstream plasma\nfluid that dominates the downstream plasma pressure.\n", "  Ceres is the largest and most massive body in the asteroid main belt.\nObservational data from the Dawn spacecraft reveal the presence of at least two\nimpact craters about 280~km in diameter on the Ceres surface, that could have\nexpelled a significant number of fragments. Yet, standard techniques for\nidentifying dynamical asteroid families have not detected any Ceres family. In\nthis work, we argue that linear secular resonances with Ceres deplete the\npopulation of objects near Ceres. Also, because of the high escape velocity\nfrom Ceres, family members are expected to be very dispersed, with a\nconsiderable fraction of km-sized fragments that should be able to reach the\npristine region of the main belt, the area between the 5J:-2A and 7J:-3A\nmean-motion resonances, where the observed number of asteroids is low. Rather\nthan looking for possible Ceres family members near Ceres, here we propose to\nsearch in the pristine region. We identified 156 asteroids whose taxonomy,\ncolors, albedo could be compatible with being fragments from Ceres. Remarkably,\nmost of these objects have inclinations near that of Ceres itself.\n", "  The Galactic transient V1309 Sco was the result of a merger in a low-mass\nstar system, while V838 Mon was thought to be a similar merger event from a\nmore massive B-type progenitor. In this paper we study an optical/IR transient\ndiscovered in the nearby galaxy NGC4490, which appeared similar to these merger\nevents (unobscured progenitor, irregular multi-peaked light curve, increasingly\nred color, similar optical spectrum, IR excess at late times), but which had a\nhigher peak luminosity and longer duration in outburst. NGC4490-OT has less in\ncommon with the class of SN~2008S-like transients. A progenitor detected in\npre-eruption HST images, combined with upper limits in the IR, requires a\nluminous and blue progenitor that has faded in late-time HST images. The same\nsource was detected by Spitzer and ground-based data as a luminous IR\ntransient, indicating a transition to a self-obscured state qualitatively\nsimilar to the evolution seen in other stellar mergers and in LBVs. The\npost-outburst dust-obscured source is too luminous and too warm at late times\nto be explained with an IR echo, suggesting that the object survived the event.\nThe luminosity of the enshrouded IR source is similar to that of the\nprogenitor. Compared to proposed merger events, the more massive progenitor of\nNGC4490-OT seems to extend a correlation between stellar mass and peak\nluminosity, and may suggest that both of these correlate with duration. We show\nthat spectra of NGC4490-OT and V838 Mon also resemble light-echo spectra of eta\nCar, prompting us to speculate that eta Car may be an extreme extension of this\nphenomenon.\n", "  By considering the quantum-mechanically minimum allowable energy interval, we\nexactly count number of states (NOS) and introduce discrete density of states\n(DOS) concept for a particle in a box for various dimensions. Expressions for\nbounded and unbounded continua are analytically recovered from discrete ones.\nEven though substantial fluctuations prevail in discrete DOS, they're almost\ncompletely flatten out after summation or integration operation. It's seen that\nrelative errors of analytical expressions of bounded/unbounded continua rapidly\ndecrease for high NOS values (weak confinement or high energy conditions),\nwhile the proposed analytical expressions based on Weyl's conjecture always\npreserve their lower error characteristic.\n", "  The stability of a trailing witness bunch, accelerated by a plasma wake\naccelerator (PWA) in a blow-out regime, is discussed. The instability growth\nrate as well as the energy spread, required for BNS damping, are obtained. A\nrelationship between the PWA power efficiency and the BNS energy spread is\nderived.\n", "  We developed a survey to probe student understanding of quantum mechanics\nconcepts at the beginning of graduate instruction. The survey was administered\nto 202 graduate students in physics enrolled in first-year quantum mechanics\ncourses from seven different universities at the beginning of the first\nsemester. We also conducted one-on-one interviews with fifteen graduate\nstudents or advanced undergraduate students who had just finished a course in\nwhich all the content on the survey was covered. We find that students share\nuniversal difficulties about fundamental quantum mechanics concepts. The\ndifficulties are often due to over-generalization of concepts learned in one\ncontext to other contexts where they are not directly applicable and difficulty\nin making sense of the abstract quantitative formalism of quantum mechanics.\nInstructional strategies that focus on improving student understanding of these\nconcepts should take into account these difficulties. The results from this\nstudy can sensitize instructors of first-year graduate quantum physics to the\nconceptual difficulties students are likely to face.\n", "  We classify the different phases by the \"pole-zero mechanism\" for a\nholographic fermionic system which contains a dipole coupling with strength $p$\non a Q-lattice background. A complete phase structure in $p$ space can be\ndepicted in terms of Fermi liquid, non-Fermi liquid, Mott phase and pseudo-gap\nphase. In particular, we find that in general the region of the pseudo-gap\nphase in $p$ space is suppressed when the Q-lattice background is dual to a\ndeep insulating phase, while for an anisotropic background, we have an\nanisotropic region for the pseudo-gap phase in $p$ space as well. In addition,\nwe find that the duality between zeros and poles always exists regardless of\nwhether or not the model is isotropic.\n", "  The delayed choice experiments of the type introduced by Wheeler and extended\nby Englert, Scully, S\\\"ussmann and Walther [ESSW], and others, have formed a\nrich area for investigating the puzzling behaviour of particles undergoing\nquantum interference. The surprise provided by the original delayed choice\nexperiment, led Wheeler to the conclusion that \"no phenomenon is a phenomenon\nuntil it is an observed phenomenon\", a radical explanation which implied that\n\"the past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present\". However\nBohm, Dewdney and Hiley have shown that the Bohm interpretation gives a\nstraightforward account of the behaviour of the particle without resorting to\nsuch a radical explanation. The subsequent modifications of this experiment led\nboth Aharonov and Vaidman and [ESSW] to conclude that the resulting Bohm-type\ntrajectories in these new situations produce unacceptable properties. For\nexample, if a cavity is placed in one arm of the interferometer, it will be\nexcited by a particle travelling down the {\\em other} arm. In other words it is\nthe particle that does {\\em not} go through the cavity that gives up its\nenergy! If this analysis is correct, this behaviour would be truly bizarre and\ncould only be explained by an extreme non-local transfer of energy that is even\nstronger than that required in an EPR-type processes. In this paper we show\nthat this conclusion is not correct and that if the Bohm interpretation is used\ncorrectly, it gives a {\\em local} explanation, which actually corresponds\nexactly to the standard quantum mechanics explanation offered by Englert,\nScully, S\\\"ussmann and Walther [ESSW].\n", "  Beta decay and electron capture on isotopes of chromium are advocated to play\na key role in the stellar evolution process. In this paper we endeavor to study\ncharge-changing transitions for 24 isotopes of chromium ($^{42-65}$Cr). These\ninclude neutron-rich and neutron-deficient isotopes of chromium. Three\ndifferent models from the QRPA genre, namely the pn-QRPA, the Pyatov method\n(PM) and the Schematic model (SM), were selected to calculate and study the\nGamow-Teller (GT) transitions in chromium isotopes. The SM was employed\nseparately in the particle-particle ($pp$) and $pp$ + particle-hole ($ph$)\nchannels. To study the effect of deformation, the SM was first used assuming\nthe nuclei to be spherical and later to be deformed. The PM was used both in\n$pp$ and $pp$ + $ph$ channels but only for the case of spherical nuclei. The\npn-QRPA calculation was done by considering both $pp$ and $ph$ forces and\ntaking deformation of nucleus into consideration. A recent study proved this\nversion of pn-QRPA to be the best for calculation of GT strength distributions\namongst the QRPA models. The pn-QRPA model calculated GT distributions had\nlow-lying centroids and small widths as compared to other QRPA models. Our\ncalculation results were also compared with other theoretical models and\nmeasurements wherever available. Our results are in decent agreement with\nprevious measurements and shell model calculations.\n", "  Lacunarity is a measure often used to quantify the lack of translational\ninvariance present in fractals and multifractal systems. The generalised\ndimensions, specially the first three, are also often used to describe various\naspects of mass distribution in such systems. In this work we establish that\nthe graph (\\textit{lacunarity curve}) depicting the variation of lacunarity\nwith scaling size, is non-linear in multifractal systems. We propose a\ngeneralised relation between the Euclidean dimension, the Correlation Dimension\nand the lacunarity of a system that lacks translational invariance, through the\nslope of the lacunarity curve. Starting from the basic definitions of these\nmeasures and using statistical mechanics, we track the standard algorithms- the\nbox counting algorithm for the determination of the generalised dimensions, and\nthe gliding box algorithm for lacunarity, to establish this relation. We go on\nto validate the relation on six systems, three of which are deterministically\ndetermined, while three others are real. Our examples span 2- and 3-\ndimensional systems, and euclidean, monofractal and multifractal geometries. We\nfirst determine the lacunarity of these systems using the gliding box\nalgorithm. In each of the six cases studied, the euclidean dimension, the\ncorrelation dimension in case of multifractals, and the lacunarity of the\nsystem, together, yield a value of the slope $S$ of the lacunarity curve at any\nlength scale. The predicted $S$ value matches the slope as determined from the\nactual plot of the lacunarity curves at the corresponding length scales. This\nestablishes that the relation holds for systems of any geometry or dimension.\n", "  We provide comments on the article by Shannon et al. (Sep 2015) entitled\n\"Gravitational waves from binary supermassive black holes missing in pulsar\nobservations\". The purpose of this letter is to address several misconceptions\nof the public and other scientists regarding the conclusions of that work.\n", "  The in-plane electrical resistivity, rho, and thermal conductivity, kappa, of\nthe heavy-fermion superconductor CeIrIn5 were measured down to 40mK in magnetic\nfields up to 11 T applied along the c axis. For all fields above Hc2=4T of\nfilamentary superconductivity, we find that the ratio of heat and charge\nconductivities in the T to 0 limit obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law,\nkappa/T=L0/rho, where L0 = 2.45*10^-8 WOhmK^-2 is the Sommerfeld value of the\nLorenz number. The temperature-dependent parts of both the electrical and\nthermal resistivity,w = T/L0 kappa, follow the functional dependence expected\nfor the Fermi liquid theory of metals with rho - rho_0 = AT^2, w - w_0 = BT^2,\nwith rho0 = w0 and B ~ 2A. The coefficient B does not show a significant field\ndependence even upon approaching Hc2 = 0.4 T of the bulk superconducting state.\nThe weak response to the magnetic field is in stark contrast with the behavior\nfound in the closely related CeCoIn5, in which the field-tuned quantum critical\npoint coincides with Hc2. The value of the electron-electron mass enhancement,\nas judged by the A and B coefficients, is about one order of magnitude reduced\nin CeIrIn5 as compared to CeCoIn5 (in spite of the fact that the zero field\ngamma_0 in CeIrIn5 is twice as large as gamma_0 in CeCoIn5), which suggests\nthat the material is significantly farther away from the magnetic quantum\ncritical point at bulk Hc2 and at all of the studied fields. A suppressed\nKadowaki-Woods ratio in CeIrIn5 compared to CeCoIn5 suggests a notably more\nlocalized nature of f electrons in the compound.\n", "  Negative superhumps are believed to arise in cataclysmic variable systems\nwhen the accretion disk is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. Slow\nretrograde precession of the line-of-nodes results in a signal---the negative\nsuperhump---with a period slightly less than the orbital period. Previous\nstudies have shown that tilted disks exhibit negative superhumps, but a\nconsensus on how a disk initially tilts has not been reached. Analytical work\nby Lai suggests that a magnetic field on the primary can lead to a tilt\ninstability in a disk when the dipole moment is offset in angle from the spin\naxis of the primary and when the primary's spin axis is, itself, not aligned\nwith the angular momentum axis of the binary orbit. However, Lai did not apply\nhis work to the formation of negative superhumps. In this paper, we add Lai's\nmodel to an existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Using this code, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of negative superhumps in the \"light curve\" for a\nrange of magnetic dipole moments. We show that the period deficits calculated\nfrom these negative superhumps match those in simulations using manually tilted\ndisks. When positive superhumps appear ($q \\lesssim 0.33$), we show that the\nperiod excesses calculated from these signals are also consistent with previous\nresults. Using examples, we show that the disks are tilted, though the tilt\nvaries periodically, and that they precess in the retrograde direction. The\nmagnetic fields found to lead to the emergence of negative superhumps lie in\nthe kilogauss regime.\n", "  The effect of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolytic medium in the\nElectrical Double Layer (EDL) in Nanochannel is an important factor that\nrequires a correction, before the application of the model in various chemical\nand biomedical examinations. However very few efforts are put forth to\naccommodate this into the mathematics of the EDL Models developed hitherto,\neven though it was realized by a host of authors for the past half a century or\neven more. Most of the Nanoc hannel made lab-on-chips in a rectangular cross\nsection require suitable impregnation of this. The effect of the EDL in a\nnanochannel isimportant in various chemical and biomedical examinations. Most\nof the nanochannelmadelab on chips in a rectangular cross section. The EDL\ninsuch a nanochannel is governed by two dimensional Gouy Chapman (GC)equation.\n", "  A variety of quantum gravity models (including spin foams) can be described\nusing a path integral formulation. A path integral has a well-known statistical\nmechanical interpretation in connection with a canonical ensemble. In this\nsense, a path integral describes the thermodynamic equilibrium of a local\nsystem in a thermal bath. This interpretation is in contrast to solutions of\nEinstein's Equations which depart from local thermodynamical equilibrium (one\nexample is shown explicitly). For this reason, we examine an extension of the\npath integral model to a (locally) non-equilibrium description. As a\nnon-equilibrium description, we propose to use a global microcanonical ensemble\nwith constraints. The constraints reduce the set of admissible microscopic\nstates to be consistent with the macroscopic geometry. We also analyse the\nrelation between the microcanonical description and a statistical approach not\nbased on dynamical assumptions which has been proposed recently. This analysis\nis of interest for the test of consistency of the non-equilibrium description\nwith general relativity and quantum field theory.\n", "  The location of zeros of the basic double sum over the square lattice is\nstudied. This sum can be represented in terms of the product of the Riemann\nzeta function and the Dirichlet beta function, so that the assertion that all\nits non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line is a particular case of the\nGeneralised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). It is shown that a new necessary and\nsufficient condition for this special case of the GRH to hold is that a\nparticular set of equimodular and equiargument contours of a ratio of MacDonald\nfunction double sums intersect only on the critical line. It is further shown\nthat these contours could only intersect off the critical line on the boundary\nof discrete regions of the complex plane called \"inner islands\". Numerical\ninvestigations are described related to this geometrical condition, and it is\nshown that for the first ten thousand zeros of both the zeta function and the\nbeta function over 70\\% of zeros lie outside the inner islands, and thus would\nbe guaranteed to lie on the critical line by the arguments presented here. A\nnew sufficient condition for the Riemann Hypothesis to hold is also presented.\n", "  All Lorentz invariant solutions of vacuum Einstein's equations are found. It\nis proved that these solutions describe space-times of constant curvature.\n", "  The Fredholm integral equations of the first kind are a classical example of\nill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. If the integral operator is\nself-adjoint and admits a set of eigenfunctions, then a formal solution can be\nwritten in terms of eigenfunction expansions. One of the possible methods of\nregularization consists in truncating this formal expansion after restricting\nthe class of admissible solutions through a-priori global bounds. In this paper\nwe reconsider various possible methods of truncation from the viewpoint of the\n$\\varepsilon$-coverings of compact sets.\n", "  Variability of active galactic nuclei is not well understood. One possible\nexplanation is existence of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBH) in their\ncentres. It is expected that major mergers are common in the Universe. It is\nexpected that each supermassive black hole of every galaxy eventually finish as\na SMBBH system in the core of newly formed galaxy. Here we model the emission\nline profiles of active galactic nuclei (AGN) assuming that the flux and\nemission line shapes variation are induced by supermassive binary black hole\nsystems (SMBBH). We assume that accreting gas inside of circumbinary (CB) disk\nis photo ionized by mini accretion disk emission around each SMBBH. We\ncalculate variations of emission line flux, shifts and shapes for different\nparameters of SMBBH orbits. We consider cases with different masses and\ninclinations for circular orbits and measure the effect to the shape of\nemission line profiles and flux variability.\n", "  One finding of cognitive research is that people do not automatically acquire\nusable knowledge by spending lots of time on task. Because students' knowledge\nhierarchy is more fragmented, \"knowledge chunks\" are smaller than those of\nexperts. The limited capacity of short term memory makes the cognitive load\nhigh during problem solving tasks, leaving few cognitive resources available\nfor metacognition. The abstract nature of the laws of physics and the chain of\nreasoning required to draw meaningful inferences makes these issues critical.\nIn order to help students, it is crucial to consider the difficulty of a\nproblem from the perspective of students. We are developing and evaluating\ninteractive problem-solving tutorials to help students in the introductory\nphysics courses learn effective problem-solving strategies while solidifying\nphysics concepts. The self-paced tutorials can provide guidance and support for\na variety of problem solving techniques, and opportunity for knowledge and\nskill acquisition.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamics of an $n$-dimensional\nLindblad control system can be separated into its inter- and intra-orbit\ndynamics when there is fast controllability. This can be viewed as a control\nsystem on the simplex of density operator spectra, where the flag representing\nthe eigenspaces is viewed as a control variable. The local controllability\nproperties of this control system can be analyzed when the control-set of flags\nis limited to a finite subset. In particular, there is a natural finite subset\nof $n!$ flags that are effective for low-purity orbits.\n", "  In this paper we study the constraints imposed by conformal invariance on\nextended objects a.k.a defects in a conformal field theory. We identify a\nparticularly nice class of defects that is closed under conformal\ntransformations. Correlation function of the defect with a bulk local operator\nis fixed by conformal invariance up to an overall constant. This gives rise to\nthe notion of defect expansion, where the defect itself is expanded in terms of\nlocal operators. This expansion generalizes the idea of the boundary state. We\nwill show how one can fix the correlation function of two defects from the\nknowledge of the defect expansion. The defect correlator admits a number of\nconformal cross-ratios depending on their dimensionality. We find the\ndifferential equation obeyed by the conformal block and solve them in certain\nspecial cases.\n", "  The phase diagrams of the spin-$3/2$ Blume-Capel model with competing short\nand long-range interactions were studied through the free energy density\nobtained by analytical methods. The competition emerges when positive\nshort-range interactions of strength $K$ arranged in a linear chain tend to\nestablish an anti-parallel spin order, whereas negative long-range interactions\n$-J$ tend to align them in parallel. Thus, no ferromagnetic order exists for\n$K/J > 0.25$. So, the phase-diagrams were scanned by varying the values of $K$\nin this interval. As in other similar study done for the spin-1 case, the\nsecond-order frontier separating the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases\nis transformed gradually into a first-order line, when $K/J$ is greater than a\ncertain critical value. Accordingly, there is a subinterval of $K$, for which\ntwo tricritical points appear restricting the length of the second-order\nfrontier. Nevertheless, for greater values of $K/J$, the\nferromagnetic-paramagnetic frontier becomes wholly of first order. Also, the\ntipical coexistence line, which divides two different ferromagnetic phases of\nmagnetization $m=3/2$ and $m=1/2$, becomes more complex by giving rise to\nanother line of coexistence with a reentrant behavior that encloses a third\nordered phase. In this case, the competition is such that there is a region in\nthe phase diagram, where for each spin $i$ with $S_{i}=3/2$ ($S_{i}=-3/2$),\nthere is another one spin $j$ with $S_{j}=-1/2$ ($S_{j}=1/2$), so the absolute\nvalue of the magnetization per spin is one.\n", "  Acceleration is a fundamental concept in physics which is taught in mechanics\nat all levels. Here, we discuss some challenges in teaching this concept\neffectively when the path along which the object is moving has a curvature and\ncentripetal acceleration is present. We discuss examples illustrating that both\nphysics teachers and students have difficulty with this concept. We conclude\nwith instructional strategies that may help students with this challenging\nconcept.\n", "  I propose a new axionic solution to the strong CP problem which involves a\nhypothetical vector-like quark(s) in a high-colour representation of the\nconventional QCD. There are two distinct scenarios. If the current mass of the\nexotic quark is zero, the strong CP phase can be trivially rotated away. The\nhigh-colour quark is `hidden' in various bounds states, the lightest being the\ncomposite axion field, with properties similar to the standard invisible axion.\nIf the high-colour quark acquire a non-zero current mass due to the spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking, the composite axion can be heavy, while the strong CP\nphase is still cancelling out in the vacuum. The phenomenology and cosmological\nimplications of the heavy composite axion differs drastically from the standard\ninvisible axion.\n", "  The Stern-Gerlach experiment has played a central role in the discovery of\nspin angular momentum. It can also play a pivotal role in teaching the\nformalism of quantum mechanics using a concrete example involving a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Using this context, students can learn about\nhow to prepare a specific quantum state starting from an arbitrary state,\nissues related to the time evolution of the wave function, and quantum\nmeasurement. It can also be exploited to teach students about the distinction\nbetween the physical space where one performs the experiment and the Hilbert\nspace where the state of the system lies and how the information about the\nstate of the system in the Hilbert space can be exploited to interpret the\npossible outcomes of the experiment in the physical space. Students can learn\nthe advantages of choosing an appropriate basis to make suitable predictions\nabout the outcomes of experiments with different arrangements of Stern-Gerlach\ndevices. This experiment can also help students understand that an ensemble of\nidentically prepared systems, e.g., one in a linear superposition of two\nstationary states, is not the same as a mixture, e.g., in which half of the\nsystems are in one stationary state and the other half are in the other\nstationary state. Here, we discuss investigation of students' difficulties\nabout the Stern-Gerlach experiment by giving written tests and interviewing\nadvanced undergraduate and graduate students in quantum mechanics courses. We\nalso discuss preliminary data from two quantum mechanics courses that suggest\nthat a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) related to the\nStern-Gerlach experiment is helpful in improving students' understanding of\nthese concepts.\n", "  We discuss the development and evaluation of five research-based tutorials on\nCoulomb's law, superposition, symmetry and Gauss's Law to help students in the\ncalculus-based introductory physics courses learn these concepts. We discuss\nthe performance of students on the pre-/post-tests given before and after the\ntutorials in three calculus-based introductory physics courses. We also discuss\nthe performance of students who used the tutorials and those who did not use it\non a multiple-choice test which employs concepts covered in the tutorials.\n", "  The Stern Gerlach experiment has played a central role in the discovery of\nspin angular momentum and it has also played a pivotal role in elucidating\nfoundational issues in quantum mechanics.

The mechanical models consists of two coupled pendula\nboth oscillating on a moving board attached to a spring. The final result\nperforms a selection among the peculiar parameters of the physical process\n(lenghts, ratio of masses, friction and damping coefficients, stiffness of the\nspring) which provide a tendency to synchronization.\n", "  Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions play an important and consequential role in\nmany astrophysical phenomena. These include, but are not limited to, electron\nand positron capture rates which determine the fate of massive stars and play\nan intricate role in the dynamics of core collapse. These $GT_{\\pm}$\ntransitions rates are the significant inputs in the description of supernova\nexplosions. $GT_{\\pm}$ strength function values are sensitive to the $^{56}Ni$\ncore excitation in the middle \\textit{pf}-shell region and to the size of the\nmodel space as well. We used the pn-QRPA theory for extracting the GT strength\nfor ground and excited states of $^{56}Ni$. We then used these GT strength\ndistributions to calculate the electron \\textit{and} positron capture rates\nwhich show differences with the earlier calculations. One curious finding of\nthis paper is our enhanced electron capture rates on $^{56}Ni$ at presupernova\ntemperatures. These differences need to be taken into account for the modeling\nof the early stages of Type II supernova evolution.\n", "  Identifying the relevant physics principles is a central component of problem\nsolving. A major goal of most introductory physics courses is to help students\ndiscern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics\nprinciples so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem\nto solve another problem which involves the same principle. We conducted an\ninvestigation in which 251 calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics\nstudents were asked explicitly in the recitation quiz to learn from a solved\nproblem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but\nthe same underlying physics principles. We find that many students were able to\ndiscern the deep similarities between the problems. When the solved problem was\nprovided, students were likely to invoke the correct principles; however, more\nscaffolding is needed to help students apply these principles correctly.\n", "  In a companion paper, we discuss students' ability to take advantage of what\nthey learn from a solved problem and transfer their learning to solve a quiz\nproblem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics\nprinciples. Here, we discuss students' ability to perform analogical reasoning\nbetween another pair of problems. Both the problems can be solved using the\nsame physics principles. However, the solved problem provided was a two- step\nproblem (which can be solved by decomposing it into two sub-problems) while the\nquiz problem was a three-step problem. We find that it is challenging for\nstudents to extend what they learned from a two-step problem to solve a\nthree-step problem.\n", "  Prior research suggests that many students believe that the magnitude of the\nstatic frictional force is always equal to its maximum value. Here, we examine\nintroductory students' ability to learn from analogical reasoning (with\ndifferent scaffolding supports provided) between two problems that are similar\nin terms of the physics principle involved but one problem involves static\nfriction, which often triggers the misleading notion. To help students process\nthrough the analogy deeply and contemplate whether the static frictional force\nwas at its maximum value, students in different recitation classrooms received\ndifferent scaffolding support. We discuss students' performance in different\ngroups.\n", "  Individual interviews are often considered to be the gold standard for\nresearchers to understand how people think about phenomena. However, conducting\nand analyzing interviews is very time consuming. This paper presents the Group\nAdministered Interactive Questionnaire (GAIQ) as an alternative to individual\ninterviews and discusses the pros and cons of each data collection method. Use\nof GAIQ will be discussed in the context of a study that seeks to understand\nteaching assistants' reasons for the design of problem solutions for\nintroductory physics.\n", "  In order to study graduate teaching assistants (TAs) beliefs and values about\nthe design of instructor problem solutions, twenty-four TAs were provided with\ndifferent solutions and asked to discuss their preferences for prominent\nsolution features. TAs preferences for solution features were examined in light\nof the modeling of expert-like problem solving process as recommended in the\nliterature. Results suggest that while many of the features TAs valued align\nwith expert-like problem solving approaches, they noticed primarily \"surface\nfeatures\" of solutions. Moreover, self-reported preferences did not match well\nwith the solutions TAs wrote on their own.\n", "  We report the dependence of magnetic properties on the crystalline disorder\nin Li$_{2}$RuO$_3$ with Ru honeycomb lattice. This oxide exhibits\nunconventional Ru-dimer transition below $T_\\text{d} \\sim$ 540 K. We\ndemonstrate that the cell parameters, related to the coherence of the dimer\nformation, are strongly dependent on the synthesis procedure. We show that the\nmagnetic behavior at the dimer transition is closely related to the lattice\nparameters. In particular, we revealed that samples with well-ordered dimers\nexhibit a first-order magnetic transition with the onset exceeding 550~K,\nhigher than that reported previously. We discuss possible dimer configurations\nleading to this magneto-lattice coupling.\n", "  Some of the natural variability in climate is understood to come from changes\nin the Sun. A key route whereby the Sun may influence surface climate is\ninitiated in the tropical stratosphere by the absorption of solar ultraviolet\n(UV) radiation by ozone, leading to a modification of the temperature and wind\nstructures and consequently to the surface through changes in wave propagation\nand circulation. While changes in total, spectrally-integrated, solar\nirradiance lead to small variations in global mean surface temperature, the\n`top-down' UV effect preferentially influences on regional scales at\nmid-to-high latitudes with, in particular, a solar signal noted in the North\nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO). The amplitude of the UV variability is fundamental\nin determining the magnitude of the climate response but understanding of the\nUV variations has been challenged recently by measurements from the SOlar\nRadiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite, which show UV solar cycle\nchanges up to 10 times larger than previously thought. Indeed, climate models\nusing these larger UV variations show a much greater response, similar to NAO\nobservations. Here we present estimates of the ozone solar cycle response using\na chemistry-climate model (CCM) in which the effects of transport are\nconstrained by observations. Thus the photolytic response to different spectral\nsolar irradiance (SSI) datasets can be isolated. Comparison of the results with\nthe solar signal in ozone extracted from observational datasets yields\nsignificantly discriminable responses. According to our evaluation the SORCE UV\ndataset is not consistent with the observed ozone response whereas the smaller\nvariations suggested by earlier satellite datasets, and by UV data from\nempirical solar models, are in closer agreement with the measured stratospheric\nvariations. Determining the most appropriate SSI variability to apply in\nmodels...\n", "  The method of microcontact spectroscopy in the superconducting state was used\nto investigate weak nonlinearities of the current-voltage characteristics of\npoint contacts made of $N{{b}_{3}}Sn$ single crystals. The nature of the\nspectrum of the electron-phonon interaction was found to vary considerably from\ncontact to contact, indicating considerable deviations of the composition of\nthe surface of $N{{b}_{3}}Sn$ from stoichiometry. A correlation was established\nbetween the nature of the spectrum and the magnitude of the gap singularities\nof the current-voltage characteristics. In the case of \"dirty\" high-resistance\ncontacts with strong gap singularities the microcontact spectra were reasonably\nreproducible, which made it possible to relate them sufficiently closely to the\nmicrocontact function of the electron-phonon interaction in the bulk material.\nIt was found that microcontact spectroscopy of this interaction was possible in\nthe superconducting state not only in dirty $S-c-S$ contacts, but also in dirty\n$S-c-N$ contacts.\n", "  We report the first observation of protons in the near (100--200 km from\nsurface) and deeper (near anti-subsolar point) lunar plasma wake when the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind velocity ($v_{sw}$) are\nparallel (aligned flow, angle between IMF and ($v_{sw} \\le 10^\\circ$). More\nthan 98% of the observations during aligned flow condition showed the presence\nof protons in the wake. These observations are obtained by the SWIM sensor of\nthe SARA experiment on Chandrayaan-1. The observation cannot be explained by\nthe conventional fluid models for aligned flow. Back-tracing of the observed\nprotons suggests that their source is the solar wind. The larger gyro-radii of\nthe wake protons compared to that of solar wind suggest that they were part of\nthe tail of the solar wind velocity distribution function. Such protons could\nenter the wake due to their large gyro-radii even when the flow is aligned to\nIMF. However, the wake boundary electric field may also play a role in the\nentry of the protons in to the wake.\n", "  The luminosity distance in the standard cosmology as given by $\\Lambda$CDM\nand consequently the distance modulus for supernovae can be defined by the\nPad\\'e approximant. A comparison with a known analytical solution shows that\nthe Pad\\'e approximant for the luminosity distance has an error of $4\\%$ at\nredshift $= 10$. A similar procedure for the Taylor expansion of the luminosity\ndistance gives an error of $4\\%$ at redshift $=0.7 $; this means that for the\nluminosity distance, the Pad\\'e approximation is superior to the Taylor series.\nThe availability of an analytical expression for the distance modulus allows\napplying the Levenberg--Marquardt method to derive the fundamental parameters\nfrom the available compilations for supernovae. A new luminosity function for\ngalaxies derived from the truncated gamma probability density function models\nthe observed luminosity function for galaxies when the observed range in\nabsolute magnitude is modeled by the Pad\\'e approximant. A comparison of\n$\\Lambda$CDM with other cosmologies is done adopting a statistical point of\nview.\n", "  The IOP model is a quantum mechanical system of a large-$N$ matrix oscillator\nand a fundamental oscillator, coupled through a quartic interaction. It was\nintroduced previously as a toy model of the gauge dual of an AdS black hole,\nand captures a key property that at infinite $N$ the two-point function decays\nto zero on long time scales. Motivated by recent work on quantum chaos, we sum\nall planar Feynman diagrams contributing to the four-point function. We find\nthat the IOP model does not satisfy the more refined criteria of exponential\ngrowth of the out-of-time-order four-point function.\n", "  Learning physics requires understanding the applicability of fundamental\nprinciples in a variety of contexts that share deep features. One way to help\nstudents learn physics is via analogical reasoning. Students can be taught to\nmake an analogy between situations that are more familiar or easier to\nunderstand and another situation where the same physics principle is involved\nbut that is more difficult to handle. Here, we examine introductory physics\nstudents' ability to use analogies in solving problems involving Newton's\nsecond law. Students enrolled in an algebra-based introductory physics course\nwere given a solved problem involving tension in a rope and were then asked to\nsolve another problem for which the physics is very similar but involved a\nfrictional force. They were asked to point out the similarities between the two\nproblems and then use the analogy to solve the friction problem.\n", "  Due to the high absorption of solar wind plasma on the lunar dayside, a large\nscale wake structure is formed downstream of the Moon. However, recent in-situ\nobservations have revealed the presence of protons in the near-lunar wake (100\nkm to 200 km from the surface). The solar wind, either directly or after\ninteraction with the lunar surface (including magnetic anomalies), is the\nsource of these protons in the near-wake region. Using the entire data from the\nSWIM sensor of the SARA experiment onboard Chandrayaan-1, we analysed the\nvelocity distribution of the protons observed in the near-lunar wake. The\naverage velocity distribution functions, computed in the solar wind rest frame,\nwere further separated based on the angle between the upstream solar wind\nvelocity and the IMF. Several proton populations were identified from the\nvelocity distribution and their possible entry mechanism were inferred based on\nthe characteristics of the velocity distribution. These entry mechanisms\ninclude (i) diffusion of solar wind protons into the wake along IMF, (ii) the\nsolar wind protons with finite gyro-radii that are aided by the wake boundary\nelectric field, (iii) solar wind protons with gyro-radii larger than lunar\nradii from the tail of the solar wind velocity distribution, and (iv)\nscattering of solar wind protons from the dayside lunar surface or from\nmagnetic anomalies. In order to gain more insight into the entry mechanisms\nassociated with different populations, backtracing is carried out for each of\nthese populations. For most of the populations, the source of the protons\nobtained from backtracing is found to be in agreement with that inferred from\nthe velocity distribution. There are few populations that could not be\nexplained by the known mechanisms and remain unknown.\n", "  Accurate theoretical results for interdigitated array of electrodes (IDAE) in\nsemi-infinite cells can be found in the literature. However, these results are\nnot always applicable when using finite cells. In this study, theoretical\nexpressions for IDAE in a finite geometry cell are presented. At known current\ndensity, transient and steady state concentration profiles were obtained as\nwell as the response time to a current step. Concerning the diffusion limited\ncurrent, a lower bound was derived from the concentration profile and an upper\nbound was obtained from the limiting current of the semi-infinite case. The\nlower bound, which is valid when Kirchhoff's current law applies to the unit\ncell, can be useful to ensure a minimum current level during the design of the\nelectrochemical cell. Finally, a criterion was developed defining when the\nbehaviors of finite and semi-infinite cells are comparable. This allows to\nobtain higher current levels in finite cells, approaching that of the\nsemi-infinite case. Examples with simulations were performed in order to\nillustrate and validate the theoretical results.\n", "  We propose a scheme of the exact fast-forwarding of standard quantum dynamics\nfor a charged particle. The present idea allows the acceleration of both the\namplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fast-forward time range\nand is distinct from that of Masuda-Nakamura (e.g., Proc. R. Soc. A {\\bf 466},\n1135 (2010)) which enabled acceleration of only the amplitude of the wave\nfunction on the way. We shall apply the proposed method to the quantum\ntunneling phenomena and obtain the electro-magnetic field to ensure the rapid\npenetration of wave functions through a tunneling barrier. Typical examples\ndescribed here are: 1) an exponential wave packet passing through the\ndelta-function barrier; 2) the opened Moshinsky shutter with a delta-function\nbarrier just behind the shutter. We elucidate the tunneling current in the\nvicinity of the barrier and find the remarkable enhancement of the tunneling\nrate (: tunneling power) due to the fast-forwarding. In the case of a very high\nbarrier, in particular, we present the asymptotic analysis and exhibit a\nsuitable driving force to recover a recognizable tunneling current. The\nanalysis is also carried out on the exact acceleration of macroscopic quantum\ntunneling with use of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation which accommodates a\ntunneling barrier.\n", "  I believe that most teachers develop a belief in a set of pedagogical\npractices. As we teach, we try different ways to teach topics and then judge\nhow successful the methods were. After several years, we have a compilation of\ntechniques in our teaching toolbox. New teachers are at a disadvantage because\nthey have fewer prior experiences to draw upon. Luckily, there is a group of\nphysicists and physics educators who are researching how students learn\nphysics, and have been able to show evidence of effective education practices\nin physics. They field of study is called PER: Physics Education Research. I\nasked Chandralekha Singh, one of the leaders in PER, to summarize some of the\nmost relevant PER findings and her response follows.\n", "  To initiate tumbling of an E. coli, one of the helical flagella reverses its\nsense of rotation. It then transforms from its normal form first to the\ntransient semicoiled state and subsequently to the curly-I state. The dynamics\nof polymorphism is effectively modeled by describing flagellar elasticity\nthrough an extended Kirchhoff free energy. However, the complete landscape of\nthe free energy remains undetermined because the ground state energies of the\npolymorphic forms are not known. We investigate how variations in these ground\nstate energies affect the dynamics of a reversely rotated flagellum of a\nswimming bacterium. We find that the flagellum exhibits a number of distinct\ndynamical states and comprehensively summarize them in a state diagram. As a\nresult, we conclude that tuning the landscape of the extended Kirchhoff free\nenergy alone cannot generate the intermediate full-length semicoiled state.\nHowever, our model suggests an ad hoc method to realize the sequence of\npolymorphic states as observed for a real bacterium. Since the elastic\nproperties of bacterial flagella are similar, our findings can easily be\nextended to other peritrichous bacteria.\n", "  We discuss the dense molecular gas in central regions of nearby Seyfert\ngalaxies, and report new arcsec resolution observations of HCN(1-0) and\nHCO$^+$(1-0) for 3 objects. In NGC 3079 the lines show complex profiles as a\nresult of self-absorption and saturated continuum absorption. H$^{13}$CN\nreveals the continuum absorption profile, with a peak close to the galaxy's\nsystemic velocity that traces disk rotation, and a second feature with a blue\nwing extending to $-350$km s$^{-1}$ that most likely traces a nuclear outflow.\nThe morphological and spectral properties of the emission lines allow us to\nconstrain the dense gas dynamics. We combine our kinematic analysis for these 3\nobjects, as well as another with archival data, with a previous comparable\nanalysis of 4 other objects, to create a sample of 8 Seyferts. In 7 of these,\nthe emission line kinematics imply thick disk structures on radial scales of\n$\\sim$100pc, suggesting such structures are a common occurrence. We find a\nrelation between the circumnuclear LHCN and Mdyn that can be explained by a gas\nfraction of 10% and a conversion factor {\\alpha}HCN $\\sim$ 10 between gas mass\nand HCN luminosity. Finally, adopting a different perspective to probe the\nphysical properties of the gas around AGN, we report on an analysis of\nmolecular line ratios which indicates that the clouds in this region are not\nself-gravitating.\n", "  Social networks have well documented effects at the individual and aggregate\nlevel. Consequently it is often useful to understand how an attempt to\ninfluence a network will change its structure and consequently achieve other\ngoals. We develop a framework for network modification that allows for\narbitrary objective functions, types of modification (e.g. edge weight\naddition, edge weight removal, node removal, and covariate value change), and\nrecovery mechanisms (i.e. how a network responds to interventions). The\nframework outlined in this paper helps both to situate the existing work on\nnetwork interventions but also opens up many new possibilities for intervening\nin networks. In particular use two case studies to highlight the potential\nimpact of empirically calibrating the objective function and network recovery\nmechanisms as well as showing how interventions beyond node removal can be\noptimised. First, we simulate an optimal removal of nodes from the Noordin\nterrorist network in order to reduce the expected number of attacks (based on\nempirically predicting the terrorist collaboration network from multiple types\nof network ties). Second, we simulate optimally strengthening ties within\nentrepreneurial ecosystems in six developing countries. In both cases we\nestimate ERGM models to simulate how a network will endogenously evolve after\nintervention.\n", "  We consider the response of a multicomponent body to $n$ fields, such as\nelectric fields, magnetic fields, temperature gradients, concentration\ngradients, etc., where each component, which is possibly anisotropic, may cross\ncouple the various fields with different fluxes, such as electrical currents,\nelectrical displacement currents, magnetic induction fields, energy fluxes,\nparticle fluxes, etc. We obtain the form of the perturbation expansions of the\nfields and response tensor in powers of matrices which measure the difference\nbetween each component tensor and a homogeneous reference tensor ${\\bf L}_0$.\nFor the case of a statistically homogeneous or periodic composite the expansion\ncoefficients can be expressed in terms of positive semidefinite normalization\nmatrices alternating with positive semidefinite weight matrices, which at each\ngiven level sum to the identity matrix. In an appropriate basis the projection\noperators onto the relevant subspaces can be expressed in block tridiagonal\nform, where the blocks are functions of these weight and normalization\nmatrices. This leads to continued fraction expansions for the effective tensor,\nand by truncating the continued fraction at successive levels one obtains a\nnested sequence of bounds on the effective tensor incorporating successively\nmore weight and normalization matrices. The weight matrices and normalization\nmatrices can be calculated from the series expansions of the fields which solve\nthe conductivity problem alone, without any couplings to other fields, and then\nthey can be used to obtain the solution for the fields and effective tensor in\ncoupled field problems in composites.\n", "  In recent years, nanostructuring of dielectric and semiconducting crystals\nhas enhanced controllability of their thermal conductivity. To carry out\ncomputational material search for nanostructured materials with desirable\nthermal conductivity, a key property is the thermal conductivity spectrum of\nthe original single crystal, which determines the appropriate length scale of\nnanostructures and mutual adaptability of different kinds of nanostructures.\nAlthough the first-principles phonon transport calculations have become\naccessible, the anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations are still heavy to\nscan many materials. To this end, we have developed an empirical model that\ndescribes the thermal conductivity spectrum in terms only of harmonic phonon\nproperties and bulk thermal conductivity. The model was tested for several\ncrystals with different structures and thermal conductivities, and was\nconfirmed to reproduce the overall profiles of thermal conductivity spectra and\ntheir anharmonic calculations.\n", "  We investigate student understanding of energy and momentum concepts at the\nlevel of introductory physics by designing and administering a 25-item multiple\nchoice test and conducting individual interviews. We find that most students\nhave difficulty in qualitatively interpreting basic principles related to\nenergy and momentum and in applying them in physical situations.\n", "  Investigations related to expertise in problem solving and ability to\ntransfer learning from one context to another are important for developing\nstrategies to help students perform more expert-like tasks. Here we analyze\nwritten responses to a pair of non-intuitive isomorphic problems given to\nintroductory physics students and discussions with a subset of students about\nthem. Students were asked to explain their reasoning for their written\nresponses. We call the paired problems isomorphic because they require the same\nphysics principle to solve them. However, the initial conditions are different\nand the frictional force is responsible for increasing the linear speed of an\nobject in one of the problems while it is responsible for decreasing the linear\nspeed in the other problem. We categorize student responses and evaluate\nstudent performance within the context of their evolving expertise. We compare\nand contrast the patterns of student categorization for the two isomorphic\nproblems. We discuss why certain incorrect responses were better than others\nand shed light on the evolution of students' expertise. We compare the\nperformance of students who worked on both isomorphic problems with those who\nworked only on one of the problems to understand whether students recognized\ntheir underlying similarity and whether isomorphic pairs gave students\nadditional insight in solving each problem.\n", "  We propose a new mathematical framework for the evolution and propagation of\nopinions, called Fuzzy Opinion Network, which is the connection of a number of\nGaussian Nodes, possibly through some weighted average, time-delay or logic\noperators, where a Gaussian Node is a Gaussian fuzzy set with the center and\nthe standard deviation being the node inputs and the fuzzy set itself being the\nnode output. In this framework an opinion is modeled as a Gaussian fuzzy set\nwith the center representing the opinion itself and the standard deviation\ncharacterizing the uncertainty about the opinion. We study the basic\nconnections of Fuzzy Opinion Networks, including basic center, basic standard\ndeviation (sdv), basic center-sdv, chain-in-center and chain-in-sdv\nconnections, and we analyze a number of dynamic connections to show how\nopinions and their uncertainties propagate and evolve across different network\nstructures and scenarios. We explain what insights we might gain from these\nmathematical results about the formation and evolution of human opinions.\n", "  The specific mechanisms which leads to the formation of fractal\nnanostructures by pulsed laser deposition remain elusive despite intense\nresearch efforts, motivated mainly by the technological interest in obtaining\ntailored nanostructures with simple and scalable production methods. Here we\nfocus on fractal nanostructures of titanium dioxide, $TiO_2$, a strategic\nmaterial for many applications, obtained by femtosecond laser ablation at\nambient conditions. We model the fractal formation through extensive Monte\nCarlo simulations based on a set of minimal assumptions: irreversible sticking\nand size independent diffusion. Our model is able to reproduce the fractal\ndimensions and the area distributions of the nanostructures obtained in the\nexperiments for different densities of the ablated material. The comparison of\ntheory and experiment show that such fractal aggregates are formed after\nlanding of the ablated material on the substrate surface by a diffusive\nmechanism. Finally we discuss the role of the thermal conductivity of the\nsubstrate and the laser fluence on the properties of the fractal\nnanostructures. Our results represent an advancement towards controlling the\nproduction of fractal nanostructures by pulsed laser deposition.\n", "  We study the intervalley scattering in defected graphene by low-temperature\ntransport measurements. The scattering rate is strongly suppressed when defects\nare charged. This finding highlights \"screening\" of the short-range part of a\npotential by the long-range part. Experiments on calcium-adsorbed graphene\nconfirm the role of a long-range Coulomb potential. This effect is applicable\nto other multivalley systems, provided that the charge state of a defect can be\nelectrically tuned. Our result provides a means to electrically control valley\nrelaxation and has important implications in valley dynamics in valleytronic\nmaterials.\n", "  A novel method based on Fast Neutron Resonance Transmission Radiography is\nproposed for non-destructive, quantitative determination of the weight\npercentages of oil and water in cores taken from subterranean or underwater\ngeological formations. The ability of the method to distinguish water from oil\nstems from the unambiguously-specific energy dependence of the neutron\ncross-sections for the principal elemental constituents. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and initial results of experimental investigations indicate that\nthe technique may provide a rapid, accurate and non-destructive method for\nquantitative evaluation of core fluids in thick intact cores, including those\nof tight shales for which the use of conventional core analytical approaches\nappears to be questionable.\n", "  In a comprehensive study, we investigate the electronic scattering effects in\nEuFe$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ by using Fourier-transform infrared\nspectroscopy. In spite of the fact that Eu$^{2+}$ local moments order around\n$T_\\text{Eu} \\approx 20$\\,K, the overall optical response is strikingly similar\nto the one of the well-known Ba-122 pnictides. The main difference lies within\nthe suppression of the lower spin-density-wave gap feature. By analysing our\nspectra with a multi-component model, we find that the high-energy feature\naround 0.7\\,eV -- often associated with Hund's rule coupling -- is highly\nsensitive to the spin-density-wave ordering, this further confirms its direct\nrelationship to the dynamics of itinerant carriers. The same model is also used\nto investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetically detwinned\nEuFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ in the antiferromagnetically ordered state, yielding a\nhigher Drude weight and lower scattering rate along the crystallographic\n$a$-axis. Finally, we analyse the development of the room temperature spectra\nwith isovalent phosphor substitution and highlight changes in the scattering\nrate of hole-like carriers induced by a Lifshitz transition.\n", "  An inverse Doppler shift occurs in a photonic crystal (PC) bounded by a\nmoving wall. The interpretation of this result has stirred some controversy. In\nthis paper, we address the problem using a diagrammatic approach. This visual\nrepresentation provides immediate insight into the phenomenon, and is a\npowerful tool for the design of time-varying PCs.\n", "  We account for the late time acceleration of the Universe by extending the\nQCD color to a $SU(3)$ invisible sector (IQCD). If the Invisible Chiral\nsymmetry is broken in the early universe, a condensate of dark pions (dpions)\nand dark gluons (dgluons) forms. The condensate naturally forms due to strong\ndynamics similar to the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio mechanism. As the Universe evolves\nfrom early times to present times the interaction energy between the dgluon and\ndpion condensate dominates with a negative pressure equation of state and\ncauses late time acceleration. We conclude with a stability analysis of the\ncoupled perturbations of the dark pions and dark gluons.\n", "  State-of-the-art relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock\ncalculations have been performed to evaluate the electronic field and mass\nisotope shift factors of the Cu~I resonance line at $\\lambda = 324.8$~nm. A\nlinear correlation between the mass factors and the transition energy is found\nfor elaborate correlation models, allowing extrapolation to the observed\nfrequency limit. The relativistic corrections to the recoil operator reduces\nthe transition mass factor by 5~\\%.\n", "  We provide some thoughts on the black hole information loss paradox,\nhighlighting some important aspects of the problem that need to be addressed in\norder to resolve the paradox.\n", "  Reflection, refraction, and absorption of light by material media are, in\ngeneral, accompanied by a transfer of optical energy and momentum to the media.\nConsequently, the eigen-modes of mechanical vibration (phonons) created in the\nprocess must distribute the acquired energy and momentum throughout the\nmaterial medium. However, unlike photons, phonons do not carry momentum. What\nhappens to the material medium in its interactions with light, therefore,\nrequires careful consideration if the conservation laws are to be upheld. The\npresent paper addresses some of the mechanisms by which the electromagnetic\nmomentum of light is carried away by mechanical vibrations.\n", "  Optical fibres have transformed the way people interact with the world and\nnow permeate many areas of science. Optical fibres are traditionally thought of\nas insensitive to magnetic fields, however many application areas from mining\nto biomedicine would benefit from fibre-based remote magnetometry devices. In\nthis work, we realise such a device by embedding nanoscale magnetic sensors\ninto tellurite glass fibres. Remote magnetometry is performed on magnetically\nactive defect centres in nanodiamonds embedded into the glass matrix. Standard\noptical magnetometry techniques are applied to initialize and detect local\nmagnetic field changes with a measured sensitivity of 26 micron Tesla/square\nroot(Hz). Our approach utilizes straight-forward optical excitation, simple\nfocusing elements, and low power components. We demonstrate remote magnetometry\nby direct reporting of the magnetic ground states of nitrogen-vacancy defect\ncentres in the optical fibres. In addition, we present and describe\ntheoretically an all-optical technique that is ideally suited to remote\nfibre-based sensing. The implications of our results broaden the applications\nof optical fibres, which now have the potential to underpin a new generation of\nmedical magneto-endoscopes and remote mining sensors.\n", "  aF2 (Barium Fluoride) detector array is designed for the measurement of\n(n,{\\gamma}) cross section precisely at CSNS-WNS (white neutron source at China\nSpallation Neutron Source). It is a 4{\\pi}solid angle-shaped detector array\nconsisting of 92 BaF2 crystal elements. To discriminate signals from BaF2\ndetector, pulse shape discrimination methodology is used, which is supported by\nwaveform digitization technique. There are total 92 channels for digitizing.\nThe precision and synchronization of clock distribution restricts the\nperformance of waveform digitizing. In this paper, the clock prototype for BaF2\nreadout electronics at CSNS-WNS is introduced. It is based on PXIe platform and\nhas a twin-stage tree topology. In the first stage, clock is distributed from\nthe tree root to each PXIe crate synchronously through coaxial cable over long\ndistance, while in the second stage, clock is further distributed to each\nelectronic module through PXIe dedicated differential star bus. With the help\nof this topology, each tree node can fan out up to 20 clocks with 3U size. Test\nresult shows the clock jitter is less than 20ps, which can meet the requirement\nof BaF2 readout electronics. Besides, this clock system has advantages of high\ndensity, simplicity, scalability and cost saving, which makes it can be used in\nother applications of clock distributing preciously.\n", "  We analyze the problem solving strategies of physics professors in a case\nwhere their physical intuition fails. A non-intuitive introductory-level\nproblem was identified and posed to twenty physics professors. The problem\nplaced the professors in a situation often encountered by students, and their\nresponse highlights the importance of intuition and experience in problem\nsolving. While professors had difficulty in solving the problem under the time\nconstraint, they initially employed a systematic approach, e.g., visualizing\nthe problem, considering various conservation laws, and examining limiting\ncases. After finding that familiar techniques were not fruitful, they made\nincorrect predictions based on one of two equally important factors. By\ncontrast, other more familiar problems that require the consideration of two\nimportant principles (e.g., conservation of both energy and momentum for a\nballistic pendulum) are quickly solved by the same professors. The responses of\nstudents who were given the same problem reflected no overarching strategies or\nsystematic approaches, and a much wider variety of incorrect responses were\ngiven. This investigation highlights the importance of teaching effective\nproblem solving heuristics, and suggests that instructors assess the difficulty\nof a problem from the perspective of beginning students.\n", "  Following the spirit of the equivalence principle, we take a step further to\nrecognize the free fall of the observer as a method to eliminate causes that\nwould lead the perceived vacuum to change its original state. Thus, it is\nexpected that the vacuum should be in a rigid Minkowski state or be uniformly\nexpanding. By carefully investigating the impact on measurement caused by the\nexpansion, we clarify the exact meaning of the uniformly expanding vacuum and\nfind that this proposal may be able to explain the current observations of an\naccelerating universe.\n", "  Sutherland and Melville (2015a) investigated the relative contributions to\nthe total dissipation rate in the ocean surface wave boundary layer of\ndifferent breaking wave scales, from large-scale whitecaps to micro-breakers.\nBased on their measurements of geometric/kinematic properties of breaking waves\nfor a wide range of wave ages, they inferred the dissipation rates from\nbreaking as a function of scale. These results were compared with their\ncomplementary measurements of the total dissipation rate in the underlying wave\nboundary layer. They reported that the total depth-integrated dissipation rate\nin the water column agreed well with dissipation rate from breaking waves for\nyoung to very old wind seas. They also reported high observed levels of\ndissipation rate very near the sea surface. They concluded that this showed a\nlarge fraction of the total dissipation rate was due to non-air entraining\nmicro-breakers and very small whitecaps. Because of its fundamental importance,\nboth physically and for accurate air-sea interaction modeling, we assess the\nvalidity of these conclusions. Our analysis of their data shows that the\nmicrobreakers and small whitecaps do not make a significant contribution to the\ntotal turbulent dissipation rate in the wave boundary layer.\n", "  The Standard Model's accidental and anomaly-free currents: $B-L$,\n$L_e-L_\\mu$, $L_e-L_\\tau$, and $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$, could be indicative of a hidden\ngauge structure beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, neutrino masses can be\ngenerated by a dimension-5 operator that generically breaks all of these\nsymmetries. It is therefore important to investigate the compatibility of a\ngauged $U'(1)$ and neutrino phenomenology. We consider gauging each of the\nsymmetries above with a minimal extended matter content. This includes the\n$Z'$, an order parameter to break the $U'(1)$, and three right-handed\nneutrinos. We find all but $B-L$ require additional matter content to explain\nthe measured neutrino oscillation parameters. We also discuss the compatibility\nof the measured neutrino textures with a non-thermal dark matter production\nmechanism involving the decay of the $Z'$. Finally, we present a parametric\nrelation that implies that a sterile neutrino dark matter candidate should not\nbe expected to contribute to neutrino masses beyond ten parts per million.\n", "  A survey was developed to probe student understanding of quantum mechanics at\nthe beginning of graduate instruction. The survey was administered to 202\nphysics graduate students enrolled in first-year quantum mechanics courses from\nseven universities at the beginning of the first semester. We also conducted\none-on-one interviews with fifteen graduate or advanced undergraduate students\nwho had just completed a course in which all the content on the survey was\ncovered. Although students from some universities performed better on average\nthan others, we found that students share universal difficulties understanding\nthe concepts of quantum mechanics. The difficulties were often due to\nover-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to other contexts where\nthey are not directly applicable. Difficulties in distinguishing between\nclosely related concepts and making sense of the formalism of quantum mechanics\nwere common. The results of this study can sensitize instructors of first-year\ngraduate quantum physics to some of the difficulties students are likely to\nface.\n", "  Quantum information science and technology is a rapidly growing\ninterdisciplinary field drawing researchers from science and engineering\nfields. Traditional instruction in quantum mechanics is insufficient to prepare\nstudents for research in quantum computing because there is a lack of emphasis\nin the current curriculum on quantum formalism and dynamics. We are\ninvestigating the difficulties students have with quantum mechanics and are\ndeveloping and evaluating quantum interactive learning tutorials (QuILTs) to\nreduce the difficulties. Our investigation includes interviews with individual\nstudents and the development and administration of free-response and\nmultiple-choice tests. We discuss the implications of our research and\ndevelopment project on helping students learn quantum mechanics relevant for\nquantum computing.\n", "  Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is developed for modelling of melting\nand solidification. Enthalpy method is used to solve heat conduction equations\nwhich involved moving interface between phases. At first, we study the melting\nof floating ice in the water for two-dimensional system. The ice objects are\nassumed as solid particles floating in fluid particles. The fluid and solid\nmotion are governed by Navier-Stokes equation and basic rigid dynamics\nequation, respectively. We also propose a strategy to separate solid particles\ndue to melting and solidification. Numerical results are obtained and plotted\nfor several initial conditions.\n", "  A detailed review of the literature for the last 5-10 years on epitaxial\ngrowth of graphene is presented. Both experimental and theoretical aspects\nrelated to growth on transition metals and on silicon carbide are thoroughly\nreviewed. Thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of growth on all these materials,\nwhere possible, are discussed. To make this text useful for a wider audience, a\nrange of important experimental techniques that have been used over the last\ndecade to grow (e.g. CVD, TPG and segregation) and characterize (STM, LEEM,\netc.) graphene are reviewed, and a critical survey of the most important\ntheoretical techniques is given. Finally, we critically discuss various\nunsolved problems related to growth and its mechanism which we believe require\nproper attention in future research.\n", "  Circumstellar discs are thought to be self-gravitating at very early times.\nIf the disc is relatively cool, extended and accreting sufficiently rapidly, it\ncan fragment into bound objects of order a few Jupiter masses and upwards.\nGiven that the fragment's initial angular momentum is non-zero, and it will\ncontinue to accrete angular momentum from the surrounding circumstellar disc,\nwe should expect that the fragment will also possess a relatively massive disc\nat early times. Therefore, we can ask: is disc fragmentation a hierarchical\nprocess? Or, can a disc fragment go on to produce its own self-gravitating\ncircumfragmentary disc that produces daughter fragments?\n  We investigate this using a set of nested 1D self-gravitating disc models. We\ncalculate the radial structure of a marginally stable, self-gravitating\ncircumstellar disc, and compute its propensity to fragmentation. We use this\ndata to construct the local fragment properties at this radius. For each\ncircumstellar disc model that results in fragmentation, we then compute a\nmarginally stable self-gravitating circumfragmentary disc model.\n  In general, the circumfragmentary discs are geometrically thick and truncated\ninside the Hill radius, and are hence stable against daughter fragmentation.\nThe typical steady-state accretion rate is between 0.1 and 10 percent of the\nlocal circumstellar disc accretion rate. The lifetime of the circumfragmentary\ndiscs' self-gravitating phase is somewhat less than 0.1 Myr, quite comparable\nwith that of the circumstellar disc. We should therefore expect that disc\nfragments will not produce satellites via gravitational instability, but\nequally the self-gravitating phase of circumfragmentary discs is likely to\naffect the properties of satellites subsequently formed via core accretion.\n", "  Zonal jets are striking and beautiful examples of the propensity for\ngeophysical turbulent flows to spontaneously self-organize into robust, large\nscale coherent structures. There exist many dynamical mechanisms for the\nformation of zonal jets: statistical theories (kinetic approaches, second order\nor larger oder closures), deterministic approaches (modulational instability,\n$\\beta$-plumes, radiating instability, zonostrophic turbulence, and so on). A\nstriking remark is that all these different dynamical approaches, each of them\npossibly relevant in some specific regimes, lead to the same kind of final jet\nstructures. Is it then possible to have a more general explanation of why all\nthese different dynamical regimes, from fully turbulent flows to gentle\nquasilinear regime, consistently lead to the same jet attractors ? Equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics provides an answer to this general question. Here we we\npresent the salient features of this theory and review applications of this\napproach to the description of zonal jets. We show that equilibrium states on a\nbeta plane or a sphere are usually zonal or quasi-zonal, and that increasing\nthe energy leads to bifurcations breaking the zonal symmetry.\n", "  Two-dimensional turbulence in a rectangular domain self-organises into\nlarge-scale unidirectional jets. While several results are present to\ncharacterize the mean jets velocity profile, much less is known about the\nfluctuations. We study jets dynamics in the stochastically forced\ntwo-dimensional Euler equations. In the limit where the average jets velocity\nprofile evolves slowly with respect to turbulent fluctuations, we employ a\nmulti-scale (kinetic theory) approach, which relates jet dynamics to the\nstatistics of Reynolds stresses. We study analytically the Gaussian\nfluctuations of Reynolds stresses and predict the spatial structure of the jets\nvelocity covariance. Our results agree qualitatively well with direct numerical\nsimulations, clearly showing that the jets velocity profile are enhanced away\nfrom the stationary points of the average velocity profile. A numerical test of\nour predictions at quantitative level seems out of reach at the present day.\n", "  We present a comparative study of CO and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\n(PAH) emission toward a region including the massive star-forming regions of\nNGC 6334 and NGC 6357. We use the NANTEN $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1--0) data and the\n$AKARI$ 9 $\\mu$m All-Sky diffuse map in order to evaluate the calibration\naccuracy of the $AKARI$ data. We confirm that the overall CO distribution shows\na good spatial correspondence with the PAH emission, and their intensities\nexhibit a good power-law correlation with a spatial resolution down to 4$'$\nover the region of 10$^\\circ$$\\times$10$^\\circ$. We also reveal poorer\ncorrelation for small scale structures between the two quantities toward NGC\n6357, due to strong UV radiation from local sources. Larger scatter in the\ncorrelation toward NGC 6357 indicates higher ionization degree and/or PAH\nexcitation than that of NGC 6334.\n", "  Non-congruent gas-liquid phase transition (NCPT) have been studied in\nmodified Coulomb model of a binary ionic mixture C(+6) + O(+8) on a\n\\textit{uniformly compressible} ideal electronic background /BIM($\\sim$)/. The\nfeatures of NCPT in improved version of the BIM($\\sim$) model for the same\nmixture on background of \\textit{non-ideal} electronic Fermi-gas and comparison\nit with the previous calculations are the subject of present study. Analytical\nfits for Coulomb corrections to EoS of electronic and ionic subsystems were\nused in present calculations within the Gibbs--Guggenheim conditions of\nnon-congruent phase equilibrium.Parameters of critical point-line (CPL) were\ncalculated on the entire range of proportions of mixed ions $0<X<1$. Strong\n\"distillation\" effect was found for NCPT in present BIM($\\sim$) model. Just\nsimilar distillation was obtained in variant of NCPT in dense nuslear matter.\nThe absence of azeotropic compositions was revealed in studied variants of\nBIM($\\sim$) in contrast to explicit existence of azeotropic compositions for\nthe NCPT in chemically reacting plasmas and in astrophysical applications.\n", "  We report specific heat measurements on a high quality single crystal of the\nheavy-fermion compound CePt$_2$In$_7$ in magnetic fields up to 27 T. The\nzero-field specific heat data above the N\\'{e}el temperature, $T_N$, suggest a\nmoderately enhanced value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma =\n180 \\; \\rm{mJ/K^2mol}$. For $T<T_N$, the data at zero applied magnetic field\nare consistent with the existence of an anisotropic spin-density wave opening a\ngap on almost entire Fermi surface, suggesting extreme two-dimensional\nelectronic and magnetic structures for CePt$_2$In$_7$. $T_N$ is monotonically\nsuppressed by magnetic field applied along the $c$-axis. When field is applied\nparallel to the $a$-axis, $T_N$ first increases at low field up to about 10 T\nand then decreases monotonically at higher field. Magnetic phase diagram based\non specific heat measurements suggests that a field-induced quantum critical\npoint is likely to occur slightly below 60 T for both principal orientations of\nthe magnetic field.\n", "  The surface science of iron oxides is comprehensively reviewed. For the full\nabstract please see pdf.\n", "  A stochastic model is proposed for the acceleration of non-relativistic\nparticles yielding to energy spectra with a shape of a Weibull\\textquoteright s\nfunction. Such particle distribution is found as the stationary solution of a\ndiffusion-loss equation in the framework of a second order Fermi\\textquoteright\ns mechanism producing anomalous diffusion for particle velocity. The present\nmodel is supported by in situ observations of energetic particle enhancements\nat interplanetary shocks, as here illustrated by means of an event seen by\nSTEREO B instruments in the heliosphere. Results indicate that the second order\nFermi\\textquoteright s mechanism provides a viable explanation for the\nacceleration of energetic particles at collisioness shock waves.\n", "  We study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) per particle of an open (parti-\ncles can enter and leave the system) and dissipative (far from thermodynamical\nequilibrium) steady state system of two qubits in a noise which is decoherence.\nWe show the behavior of QFI per particle of the system due to changes of re-\nset and decoherence parameters r and {\\gamma} respectively. The parameter r is\nthe strength of the reset mechanism, {\\gamma} is the strength of decoherence\nand in our case it is dephasing channel. The parameters {\\gamma} and r are real\nnumbers. We observe that the reset parameter must be bigger than decoherence\nparameter. We have found that by choosing coupling parameter g as 5{\\gamma} the\nQFI per particle is 1.00226 which is greater than shot noise limit at {\\gamma}\n= 0.5 and r = 14 . Also the concurrence and negativity of the such state have\nbeen calculated and they are found as 0.0992486 and 0.0496243 respectively. We\nhave shown that when the concurrence and negativity of some specific states\ndifferent than zero, which means the state is entangled, the QFI of the system\nis greater than 1. The QFI per particle, concurrence and negativity shows that\nthe chosen case is weakly entangled. We discovered that the optimal direction\ndepends on the parameters r and {\\gamma} and a change in the direction effects\nthe behavior of the QFI of the system.\n", "  Reversible resistive switching between high-resistance and low-resistance\nstates in metal-oxide-metal heterostructures makes them very interesting for\napplications in random access memories. While recent experimental work has\nshown that inserting a metallic \"oxygen scavenger layer\" between the positive\nelectrode and oxide improves device performance, the fundamental understanding\nof how the scavenger layer modifies heterostructure properties is lacking. We\nuse density functional theory to calculate thermodynamic properties and\nconductance of TiN/HfO$_2$/TiN heterostructures with and without Ta scavenger\nlayer. First, we show that Ta insertion lowers the formation energy of\nlow-resistance states. Second, while the Ta scavenger layer reduces the\nSchottky barrier height in the high-resistance state by modifying the interface\ncharge at the oxide-electrode interface, the heterostructure maintains a high\nresistance ratio between high- and low-resistance states. Finally, we show that\nthe low-bias conductance of device on-states becomes much less sensitive to the\nspatial distribution of oxygen removed from the HfO$_2$ in the presence of the\nTa layer. By providing fundamental understanding of the observed improvements\nwith scavenger layers, we open a path to engineer interfaces with oxygen\nscavenger layers to control and enhance device performance. In turn, this may\nenable the realization of a non-volatile low-power memory technology with\nconcomitant reduction in energy consumption by consumer electronics and\nsignificant benefits to society.\n", "  Cosmic ray primary particles initiate extended air showers (EAS) in the\natmosphere. The directions of these cosmic rays approximate a homogeneous\nisotropic distribution. The HiSPARC experiment, consisting of a growing number\nof measurement stations scattered over the Netherlands, Denmark and the United\nKingdom, detects EAS particles using scintillators. These detections facilitate\nreconstructions of the direction of cosmic ray primaries.\n  The acceptance of the HiSPARC experiment, limited due to the generating\nmechanism of EASs in the atmosphere and the location of the measurement\nstations, has been analysed.\n", "  We have successfully applied the resistance grid technique to measure the\ndisintegration speed in special type of glass objects, widely known as Prince\nRupert's drops. We use a digital oscilloscope and a simple electrical circuit,\nglued to the surface of the drops, to detect the voltage changes, corresponding\nto the breaks in the specific parts of the drops. The results obtained using\nthis method are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with theoretical\npredictions and previously published data. Moreover, the proposed experimental\nsetup doesn't include any expensive equipment (such as a high-speed camera) and\ncan therefore be widely used in high schools and universities.\n", "  The efficiency of using intensity modulated light for estimation of\nscattering properties of a turbid medium and for ballistic photon\ndiscrimination is theoretically quantified in this article. Using the diffusion\nmodel for modulated photon transport and considering a noisy quadrature\ndemodulation scheme, the minimum-variance bounds on estimation of parameters of\ninterest are analytically derived and analyzed. The existence of a\nvariance-minimizing optimal modulation frequency is shown and its evolution\nwith the properties of the intervening medium is derived and studied.\nFurthermore, a metric is defined to quantify the efficiency of ballistic photon\nfiltering which may be sought when imaging through turbid media. The analytical\nderivation of this metric shows that the minimum modulation frequency required\nto attain significant ballistic discrimination depends only on the reduced\nscattering coefficient of the medium in a linear fashion for a highly\nscattering medium.\n", "  A large number of new \"black widow\" and \"redback\" energetic millisecond\npulsars with irradiated stellar companions have been discovered through radio\nand optical searches of unidentified \\textit{Fermi} sources. Synchrotron\nemission, from particles accelerated up to several TeV in the intrabinary\nshock, exhibits modulation at the binary orbital period. Our simulated\ndouble-peaked X-ray light curves modulated at the orbital period, produced by\nrelativistic Doppler-boosting along the intrabinary shock, are found to\nqualitatively match those observed in many sources. In this model, redbacks and\ntransitional pulsar systems where the double-peaked X-ray light curve is\nobserved at inferior conjunction have intrinsically different shock geometry\nthan other millisecond pulsar binaries where the light curve is centered at\nsuperior conjunction. We discuss, and advocate, how current and future optical\nobservations may aid in constraining the emission geometry, intrabinary shock\nand the unknown physics of pulsar winds.\n", "  We discuss the role that intuitive theories of physics play in the\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. We compare and contrast na\\\"ive physics\nwith quantum mechanics and argue that quantum mechanics is not just hard to\nunderstand but that it is difficult to believe, often appearing magical in\nnature. Quantum mechanics is often discussed in the context of \"quantum\nweirdness\" and quantum entanglement is known as \"spooky action at a distance.\"\nThis spookiness is more than just because quantum mechanics doesn't match\neveryday experience; it ruffles the feathers of our na\\\"ive physics cognitive\nmodule. In Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, we\npreserve a form of deterministic thinking that can alleviate some of the\nperceived weirdness inherent in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, at\nthe cost of having the universe split into parallel worlds at every quantum\nmeasurement. By examining the role cognitive modules play in interpreting\nquantum mechanics, we conclude that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum\nmechanics involves a cognitive bias not seen in the Copenhagen interpretation.\n", "  We report on spatial measurements of the superconducting proximity effect in\nepitaxial graphene induced by a graphene-superconductor interface.\nSuperconducting aluminum films were grown on epitaxial multilayer graphene on\nSiC. The aluminum films were discontinuous with networks of trenches in the\nfilm morphology reaching down to exposed graphene terraces. Scanning tunneling\nspectra measured on the graphene terraces show a clear decay of the\nsuperconducting energy gap with increasing separation from the\ngraphene-aluminum edges. The spectra were well described by\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The decay length for the\nsuperconducting energy gap in graphene was determined to be greater than 400\nnm. Deviations in the exponentially decaying energy gap were also observed on a\nmuch smaller length scale of tens of nanometers.\n", "  We apply a regularized Rudin-Osher-Fatemi total variation (TV) method to\ndenoise the transient gravitational wave signal GW150914. We have previously\napplied TV techniques to denoise numerically generated grav- itational waves\nembedded in additive Gaussian noise, obtaining satisfactory results\nirrespective of the signal morphology or astrophysical origin. We find that the\nnon-Gaussian, non-stationary noise from the gravitational wave event GW150914\ncan also be successfully removed with TV-denoising methods. The quality of the\nde- noised waveform is comparable to that obtained with the Bayesian approach\nused in the discovery paper [1]. TV-denoising techniques may thus offer an\nadditional viable approach for waveform reconstruction.\n", "  We show how the magnetization of nano-objects can be efficiently regulated.\nSeveral types of nanosystems are considered: magnetics nanomolecules, magnetic\nnanoclusters, polarized nanomolecules, and magnetic graphene. These\nnano-objects and the structures composed of them enjoy many common properties,\nwith the main difference being in the type of particle interactions. The\npossibility of governing spin dynamics is important for spintronics.\n", "  The revolution and Civil War in Syria has led to substantial death and\nsuffering, a massive refugee crisis, and growth of ISIS extremism and its\nterror attacks globally. Conflict between disparate groups is ongoing. Complex\nethnic geography is a central reason for the large number of different groups\nin conflict as this geography leads to local allegiances that do not aggregate\nat the national scale. We have previously demonstrated that, where ethnic\ngroups exist in geographic patches of 20-60 km in diameter, there is a high\nprobability of conflict. We have also shown that establishing local autonomy\nthrough subnational boundaries (as is found in Switzerland) is a means of\nalleviating conflict. Our analysis suggests that providing some level of local\nautonomy to the ethnic groups would reduce the impetus for local conflict and\ncould serve as a basis for peace and stability. Here we propose that\ninterventions should be pursued to stop specific individual local conflicts,\ncreating safe zones, that can be expanded gradually and serve as examples for\nachieving a comprehensive solution for safety, peace and stable local\ngovernance in Syria.\n", "  Almost 100 years ago Sir Arthur Eddington noted that the interiors of stars\nwere inaccessible to observations. The advent of helio- and asteroseismology\nhas completely changed this assessment. Helioseismology has provided very\ndetailed information about the interior structure and dynamics of the Sun,\nhighlighting remaining issues in our understanding of the solar interior. In\nthe last decade extensive observations of stellar oscillations, in particular\nfrom space photometry, have provided very detailed information about the global\nand internal properties of stars. Here I provide an overview of these\ndevelopments, including the remarkable insight that has been obtained on the\nproperties of evolved stars.\n", "  We study the convergence towards the equilibrium for a dissipative and\nstochastic time-dependent oval billiard. The dynamics of the system is\ndescribed by using a generic four dimensional nonlinear map for the variables:\nthe angular position of the particle, the angle formed by the trajectory of the\narticle with the tangent line at the position of the collision, the absolute\nvelocity of the particle, and the instant of the hit with the boundary. The\ndynamics of the stationary state as well as the dynamical evolution towards the\nequilibrium is made by using an ensemble of non interacting particles. Finally,\nwe make a connection with the thermodynamic by using the energy equipartition\ntheorem.\n", "  Solvable supersymmetric algebraic model for descriptions of the spherical to\ngama unstable shape- phase transition in even and odd mass nuclei is proposed.\nThis model is based on dual algebraic structure and Richardson - Gaudin method,\nwhere the duality relations between the unitary and quasispin algebraic\nstructures for the boson and fermion systems are extended to mixed boson-\nfermion system. The structure of two type of nuclear supersymmetry schemes,\nbased on the U(6/2) and U(6/4) supergroups, is discussed. We investigate the\nchange in level structure induced by the phase transition by doing a quantal\nanalysis. By using the generalized quasispin algebra, it is shown that the\nnuclear supersymmetry concept can be also used for transitional regions in\naddition to dynamical symmetry limits. Experimental evidence for the U(5)-O(6)\ntransition in Ru-Rh and Zn- Cu supermultiplets is presented. The low-states\nenergy spectra and B(E2)values for these nuclei have been calculated and\ncompared with the experimental data.\n", "  One of the pivotal questions in the dynamics of the oceans is related to the\ncascade of mechanical energy in the abyss and its contribution to mixing. Here,\nwe propose internal wave attractors in the large amplitude regime as a unique\nself-consistent experimental and numerical setup that models a cascade of\ntriadic interactions transferring energy from large-scale monochro-matic input\nto multi-scale internal wave motion. We also provide signatures of a discrete\nwave turbulence framework for internal waves. Finally, we show how beyond this\nregime, we have a clear transition to a regime of small-scale high-vorticity\nevents which induce mixing. Introduction.\n", "  We review a number of ideas put forward in favour of the use of a polarised\ntarget along with the proposed idea of a fixed-target experiment using the LHC\nbeams -- AFTER@LHC. A number of recent studies have shown that single\ntransverse-spin asymmetries (STSAs) are large enough to be precisely measured\nin the region accessible with AFTER@LHC, in particular as regards the Drell-Yan\nprocess as well as single-pion, isolated-photon and jet production. AFTER@LHC\nwith a polarised target would also be the ideal experimental set-up to measure\nthe gluon Sivers effect via a number of original quarkonium STSA studies. We\ndiscuss first figures-of-merit based on simulations for AFTER@LHC with a\npolarised target.\n", "  The surface gravity on Mars is smaller than the surface gravity on Earth,\nresulting in longer falling times. This effect can be simulated on Earth by\ntaking advantage of air resistance and buoyancy, which cause low density\nobjects to fall slowly enough to approximate objects falling on the surface of\nMars. We describe a computer simulation based on an experiment that\napproximates Martian gravity, and verify our numerical results by performing\nthe experiment.\n", "  This is a translation of a classic paper in German showing that the apparent\npower in an AC arc is larger than the active power although no phase shift\nexists between the voltage and the current, indicating that the reactive power\nvanishes. The phenomenon studied in this paper gave rise to a variety of\nmutually conflicting \"power triangle\" models relating the active, reactive, and\napparent powers P, Q, and S whose merits are still under debate today.\n", "  In a recent article Hensen et al. [Nature 526, 682 (2015)] report on a\nsophisticated Bell experiment, simultaneously closing, for the first time,\nloopholes for local hidden-variable theories (HVTs). The authors claim that\n'local realism' has been refuted, under certain natural assumptions. The aim of\nthe present Comment is twofold. First, it is urged that the class of local HVTs\nthat is eliminated by the reported experiment should be specified in greater\ndetail than is done by the authors. Second, it is argued that the class of\nlocal HVTs that still survives is wide and natural. For instance, hidden\nvariables describing a 'background' field can exploit the freedom-of-choice\nloophole, which cannot be closed for this type of hidden variables. The\ndynamics of such background-based theories can be illustrated by existing\nsystems, e.g. from fluid mechanics.\n", "  A model for the universe with tachyonic and fermionic fields interacting\nthrough a Yukawa-type potential is investigated. It is shown that the tachyonic\nfield answers for the initial accelerated regime and for the subsequent\ndecelerated regime so that it behaves as an inflaton at early times and as a\nmatter field at intermediate times, while the fermionic field has the role of a\ndark energy constituent, since it leads to an accelerated regime at later\ntimes. The interaction between the fields via a Yukawa-type potential controls\nthe duration of the decelerated era, since a stronger coupling makes a shorter\ndecelerated period.\n", "  We study dynamics of a superconducting condensate in the presence of a domain\nwall defect in the order parameter. We find that broken translation and\nreflection symmetries result in new collective excitations, bound to the domain\nwall region. Two additional amplitude/Higgs modes lie below the bulk\npairbreaking edge $2\\Delta$; one of them is a Goldstone mode with vanishing\nexcitation energy. Spectrum of bound collective modes is related to the\ntopological structure and stability of the domain wall. The `unbound' bulk\ncollective modes and transverse gauge field mostly propagate across the domain\nwall, but the longitudinal component of the gauge field is completely\nreflected. Softening of the amplitude mode suggests reduced damping and\npossible route to its detection in geometrically confined superfluids or in\nsuperconductor-ferromagnetic heterostructures.\n", "  We describe the development and implementation of research-based learning\ntools such as the Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILTs) and peer\ninstruction tools to reduce students' common difficulties with issues related\nto measurement in quantum mechanics. A preliminary evaluation shows that these\nlearning tools are effective in improving students' understanding of concepts\nrelated to quantum measurement.\n", "  A recent conceptual model of tumor-driven angiogenesis including branching,\nelongation, and anastomosis of blood vessels captures some of the intrinsic\nmultiscale structures of this complex system, yet allowing to extract a\ndeterministic integro-partial differential description of the vessel tip\ndensity [Phys. Rev. E 90, 062716 (2014)]. Here we solve the stochastic model,\nshow that ensemble averages over many realizations correspond to the\ndeterministic equations, and fit the anastomosis rate coefficient so that the\ntotal number of vessel tips evolves similarly in the deterministic and ensemble\naveraged stochastic descriptions.\n", "  Studies of scientists building models show that the development of scientific\nmodels involves a great deal of subjectivity. However, science as experienced\nin school settings typically emphasizes an overly objective and rationalistic\nview. In this paper, we argue for focusing on the development of disciplined\ninterpretation as an epistemic and representational practice that progressively\ndeepens students' computational modeling in science by valuing, rather than\ndeemphasizing, the subjective nature of the experience of modeling. We report\nresults from a study in which fourth grade children engaged in computational\nmodeling throughout the academic year. We present three salient themes that\ncharacterize the development of students' disciplined interpretations in terms\nof their development of computational modeling as a way of seeing and doing\nscience.\n", "  We consider a coupled system of Navier Stokes, Maxwell Stefan and Poisson\nBoltzmann equations by incorporating the variation of dielectric constant,\nwhich governs the electro osmotic flow in nano channel, describing the\nevolution of the velocity, concentration and potential fields of dissolved\nconstituents in an aqueous electrolyte solution. We apply the finite difference\ntechnique to solve one and two dimensional systems of these equations. The\nsolutions give an extremely accurate prediction of the dielectric constant for\na variety of salts and a wide range of concentrations.\n", "  A scanning white light interferometer is developed to measure the distributed\npolarization coupling (DPC) in high birefringence polarization maintaining\nfibers (PMFs). Traditionally, this technique requests only one polarization\nmode to be excited or both polarization modes to be excited with equal\nintensity in the PMF. Thus, an accurate alignment of the polarization direction\nwith the principal axis in PMF is strictly required, which is not facilely\nrealized in practical measurement. This paper develops a method to measure the\nspatial distribution of polarization mode coupling with random modes excited\nusing a white light Michelson interferometer. The influence of incident\npolarization extinction ratio (PER) on polarization coupling detection is\nevaluated theoretically and experimentally. It is also analyzed and validated\nin corresponding measurement that the sensitivity of the polarization coupling\ndetection system can be improved more than 100 times with the rotation of the\nanalyzer.\n", "  An electronic speckle shearing phase-shifting pattern interferometer (ESSPPI)\nbased on Michelson interferometer was based in this paper. A rotatable mirror\ndriven by a step motor in one of its reflective arm is used to generate an\nadjustable shearing and the mirror driven by piezoelectric transducer (PZT) in\nthe other reflective arm was used to realize phaseshifting. In the experiments,\nthe deformation of an aluminum plate with the same extern-force on different\npositions and different forces on the same position is measured. Meanwhile, the\nphase distribution and phase-unwrap image of the aluminum plate with the\nextern-force on its center position is obtained by the four-step phase-shifting\nmethod.\n", "  We provide a rigorous derivation of an asymptotic formula for perturbations\nin the resonance values caused by the presence of finite number of anisotropic\nimperfections of small shapes with constitutive parameters different from the\nbackground conductivity. The asymptotic expansion is carried out with respect\nto the size of the imperfections. The main feature of the method is to yield a\nrobust procedure making it possible to recover information about the location,\nshape, and material properties of the anisotropic imperfections.\n", "  In the present paper, the initial theoretical results on wave-like aquatic\npropulsion of marine craft by propagating flexural waves are reported. Recent\nexperimental investigations of small model boats propelled by propagating\nflexural waves carried out by the present author and his co-workers\ndemonstrated viability of this type of propulsion as an alternative to a\nwell-known screw propeller. In the attempts of theoretical explanation of the\nobtained experimental results using the theory of Lighthill for fish\nlocomotion, it was found that this theory predicts zero thrust for such model\nboats, which is in contradiction with the results of the experiments. One\nshould note in this connection that the theory developed by Lighthill assumes\nthat the amplitudes of propulsive waves created by fish body motion grow from\nzero on the front (at fish heads) to their maximum values at the tails. This is\nconsistent with fish body motion in nature, but is not compatible with the\nbehaviour of localised flexural waves used for propulsion in the experimental\nmodel vessels. To overcome the problem of predicting zero thrust for the above\nvessels, it is suggested in the present work that nonlinear distortion of\nlocalised flexural waves may be responsible for generation of thrust. This\nhypothesis is explored in the present work by adding nonlinear harmonics of\npropulsive flexural waves to the formula derived by Lighthill for generated\nthrust. For simplicity, only the lowest (third) harmonic growing linearly with\nthe distance of propagation was used. The resulting formula for the averaged\nthrust shows that, due to the effect of the third harmonic, the thrust is no\nlonger zero, thereby demonstrating that nonlinear distortion of the propulsive\nflexural waves may be paramount for the existence of wave-like aquatic\npropulsion of small marine craft using freely propagating flexural waves.\n", "  The charmless $B_{c}$ $\\to$ $PP$, $PV$~(where $P$ and $V$ denote the light\npseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively) decays can occur only via the\nweak annihilation diagrams within the Standard Model and provide, therefore, an\nideal place to probe the strength of annihilation contribution in hadronic\n$B_{u,d,s}$ decays. In this paper, we study these kinds of decays in the\nframework of QCD factorization, by adopting two different schemes: scheme I is\nsimilar to the method usually adopted in the QCD factorization approach, while\nscheme II is based on the infrared behavior of gluon propagator and running\ncoupling. For comparison, in our calculation, we adopt three kinds of wave\nfunctions for $B_{c}$ meson. It is found that: (a) The predicted branching\nratios in scheme I are, however, quite small and are almost impossible to be\nmeasured at the LHCb experiment. (b) In scheme II, by assigning a dynamical\ngluon mass to the gluon propagator, we can avoid enhancements of the\ncontribution from soft endpoint region. The strength of annihilation\ncontributions predicted in scheme II is enhanced compared to that obtained in\nscheme I. However, the predicted branching ratios are still smaller than the\ncorresponding ones obtained in the perturbative QCD approach. The large\ndiscrepancies among these theoretical predictions indicate that more detailed\nstudies of these decays are urgently needed and will be tested by the future\nmeasurements performed at the LHCb experiment.\n", "  Kelvin's relations may be considered as cornerstones in the theory of\nthermoelectricity. Indeed, they gather together the three thermoelectric\neffects, associated respectively with Seebeck, Peltier and Thomson, to get a\nunique and consistent description of thermoelectric phenomena. However, their\nphysical status in literature are quite different. On the one hand, the second\nKelvin's relation is associated with the microscopic reversibility, considered\nas a fundamental thermodynamical property. On the other hand, the first\nKelvin's relation is traditionally introduced only as a convenient mathematical\nrelation between Seebeck and Thomson coefficients. In the present article, we\nstress that, contrary to common believes, this relation may demonstrates deeper\ninsights than a bold mathematical expression between thermoelectric\ncoefficients. It actually reflects the coexistence of two different mechanisms\ntaking place inside thermoelectric systems: Energy conversion and\nreorganization of heat flow when Seebeck coefficient varies.\n", "  We consider the continuity property in Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\\R^m)$ of wave\noperators $W_\\pm$ of scattering theory for Schr\\\"odinger operator $H=-\\lap + V$\non $\\R^m$, $|V(x)|\\leq C\\ax^{-\\delta}$ for some $\\delta>2$ when $H$ is of\nexceptional type, i.e. $\\Ng=\\{u \\in \\ax^{-s} L^2(\\R^m) \\colon (1+\n(-\\lap)^{-1}V)u=0 \\}\\not=\\{0\\}$ for some $1/2<s<\\delta-1/2$. It has recently\nbeen proved by Goldberg and Green for $m\\geq 5$ that $W_\\pm$ are bounded in\n$L^p(\\R^m)$ for $1\\leq p<m/2$, the same holds for $1\\leq p<m$ if all $\\f\\in\n\\Ng$ satisfy $\\int_{\\R^m} V\\f dx=0$ and, for $1\\leq p<\\infty$ if in addition\n$\\int_{\\R^m} x_i V\\f dx=0$, $i=1, \\dots, m$. We make the results for $p>m/2$\nmore precise and prove in particular that these conditions are also necessary\nfor the stated properties of $W_\\pm$. We also prove that, for $m=3$, $W_\\pm$\nare bounded in $L^p(\\R^3)$ for $1<p<3$ and that the same holds for $1<p<\\infty$\nif and only if all $\\f\\in \\Ng$ satisfy $\\int_{\\R^3}V\\f dx=0$ and $\\int_{\\R^3}\nx_i V\\f dx=0$, $i=1, 2, 3$, simultaneously.\n", "  Levy-Perdew-Sahni (LPS) provided a proof of the connection between the\ndensity and ionization potential of a many-electron system using the equation\nfor the density directly. This equation employs an effective potential which is\nderived by LPS from the many-electron wavefunction of the system. In this\npaper, we calculate this potential explicitly by employing an accurate\nwavefunction for two-electron systems. With this wavefunction connection the\nLPS equation is then solved self- consistently employing this potential and\nshown to lead to accurate densities and chemical potentials for these systems.\n", "  Blood exhibits a heterogeneous nature of hematocrit, velocity, and effective\nviscosity in microcapillaries. Microvascular bifurcations have a significant\ninfluence on the distribution of the blood cells and blood flow behavior. This\npaper presents a simulation study performed on the two-dimensionalmotions and\ndeformation of multiple red blood cells in microvessels with diverging and\nconverging bifurcations. Fluid dynamics and membrane mechanics were\nincorporated. Effects of cell shape, hematocrit, and deformability of the cell\nmembrane on rheological behavior of the red blood cells and the hemodynamics\nhave been investigated. It was shown that the blood entering the daughter\nbranch with a higher flow rate tended to receive disproportionally more cells.\nThe results also demonstrate that red blood cells in microvessels experienced\nlateral migration in the parent channel and blunted velocity profiles in both\nstraight section and daughter branches, and this effect was influenced by the\nshape and the initial position of the cells, the hematocrit, and the membrane\ndeformability. In addition, a cell free region around the tip of the confluence\nwas observed. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with existing\nexperimental findings. This study may provide fundamental knowledge for a\nbetter understanding of hemodynamic behavior of micro-scale blood flow.\n", "  Velazquez and Curilef have proposed a methodology to extend Monte Carlo\nalgorithms that are based on canonical ensemble. According to our previous\nstudy, their proposal allows us to overcome slow sampling problems in systems\nthat undergo any type of temperature-driven phase transition. After a\ncomprehensive review about ideas and connections of this framework, we discuss\nthe application a re-weighting technique to improve the accuracy of\nmicrocanonical calculations, specifically, the well-known multi-histograms\nmethod of Ferrenberg and Swendsen. As example of application, we reconsider the\nstudy of four-state Potts model on the square lattice $L\\times L$ with periodic\nboundary conditions. This analysis allows us to detect the existence of a very\nsmall latent heat per site $q_{L}$ during the occurrence of temperature-driven\nphase transition of this model, whose size dependence seems to follow a\npower-law $q_{L}(L)\\propto(1/L)^{z}$ with exponent $z\\simeq0$.$26\\pm0$.$02$. It\nis discussed the compatibility of these results with the continuous character\nof temperature-driven phase transition when $L\\rightarrow+\\infty$.\n", "  Integrated optics has brought unprecedented levels of stability and\nperformance to quantum photonic circuits. However, integrated devices are not\nmerely micron-scale equivalents of their bulk-optics counterparts. By\nexploiting the inherently dispersive characteristics of the integrated setting,\nsuch devices can play a remarkably more versatile role in quantum circuit\narchitectures. We show this by examining the implications of linear dispersion\nin an ordinary directional coupler. Dispersion unlocks several novel\ncapabilities for this device, including in-situ control over photon spectral\nand polarization entanglement, tunable photon time-ordering, and\nentanglement-sensitive two-photon coincidence generation. Also revealed is an\nability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while tuning the\ninterference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk-optics. The outcome of\nthis work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that\nbenefit from the advantages of integration. It also paves the way for\nre-evaluating the possibilities offered by dispersion in other on-chip devices.\n", "  Nano-scale confinement of polymer in cone-shaped geometries occurs in many\nexperimental situations. A flexible polymer confined in a cone-shaped\nnano-channel is studied theoretically and using molecular dynamics simulations.\nDistribution of the monomers inside the channel, configuration of the confined\npolymer, entropic force acting on the polymer, and their dependence on the\nchannel and the polymer parameters are investigated. The theory and the\nsimulation results are in very good agreement. The entropic force on the\npolymer that results from the asymmetric shape of the channel is measured in\nthe simulations and its magnitude is found to be significant relative to\nthermal energy. The obtained dependence of the force on the channel parameters\nmay be useful in the design of cone-shaped nano-channels.\n", "  Ideas and results of the generalized wave operator theory for dynamical and\nstationary cases are developed further and exact expressions for generalized\nscattering operators are obtained for wide classes of differential equations.\nNew results on the structure of the generalized scattering operators are\nderived. Interesting interrelations between dynamical and stationary cases are\nfound for radial Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac equations, and for Dirac-type\nequations as well. For some important examples we explain why the well-known\ndivergences in the higher order approximations of the scattering matrices do\nnot appear in the \"generalized wave operator\" approach.\n", "  Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA) are a range of widely used\nanalytical methods whose implementation requires to build antibodies (IgG) thin\nfilms onto surfaces predominantly made of polystyrene. The high hydrophobicity\nof polystyrene ensures a spontaneous and strong adhesion of proteins allowing\nto easily build IgG monolayers. Since the ELISA improvements definitely lie in\nthe comprehension of physico-chemical mechanisms on which IgG immobilization on\nhydrophobic surfaces are relied, this work develops a theorization essay\n(thermodynamics of the so-called hydrophobic effect and of thin films building)\nemphasized by numerical modelling (random sequential additions model, i.e. RSA)\nand experimental estimations by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ELISA.\nKeeping in mind the hydrophobic effect, thermodynamics (of irreversible\nprocesses) allows to explain why IgG adhesion on polystyrene occurs whereas\nnumerical modelling approaches show a way of surface saturation leading to\npromote IgG orientations expected for ELISA. Finally, an improvement of RSA in\na RSA+R model taking into account orientational and/or structural changes\nthroughout relaxation phenomena shows an obvious relationship between\ndeposition conditions and obtained monolayer structure. Such theoretical\nresults seem to be strongly correlated with experimental facts, i.e. AFM and\nELISA.\n", "  Some very large (>0.1 um) presolar grains are sampled in meteorites. We\nreconsider the lifetime of very large grains (VLGs) in the interstellar medium\nfocusing on interstellar shattering caused by turbulence-induced large velocity\ndispersions. This path has never been noted as a dominant mechanism of\ndestruction. We show that, if interstellar shattering is the main mechanism of\ndestruction of VLGs, their lifetime is estimated to be $\\gtrsim 10^8$ yr; in\nparticular, very large SiC grains can survive cosmic-ray exposure time.\nHowever, most presolar SiC grains show residence times significantly shorter\nthan 1 Gyr, which may indicate that there is a more efficient mechanism than\nshattering in destroying VLGs, or that VLGs have larger velocity dispersions\nthan 10 km s$^{-1}$. We also argue that the enhanced lifetime of SiC relative\nto graphite can be the reason why we find SiC among $\\mu$m-sized presolar\ngrains, while the abundance of SiC in the normal interstellar grains is much\nlower than graphite.\n", "  Measurements of fusion cross-sections of 7Li and 12C with 198Pt at deep\nsub-barrier energies are reported to unravel the role of the entrance channel\nin the occurrence of fusion hindrance. The onset of fusion hindrance has been\nclearly observed in 12C + 198Pt system but not in 7Li + 198Pt system, within\nthe measured energy range. Emergence of the hindrance, moving from lighter\n(6,7Li) to heavier (12C,16O) projectiles is explained employing a model that\nconsiders a gradual transition from a sudden to adiabatic regime at low\nenergies. The model calculation reveals a weak effect of the damping of\ncoupling to collective motion for the present systems as compared to that\nobtained for systems with heavier projectiles.\n", "  We compute the most general superconformal blocks for scalar operators in\n$4\\mathcal{D}$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. Specifically we\nemploy the supershadow formalism to study the four-point correlator\n$\\langle\\Phi_1 \\Phi_2 \\Phi_3 \\Phi_4\\rangle$, in which the four scalars $\\Phi_i$\nhave arbitrary scaling dimensions and R-charges with the only constraint from\nR-symmetry invariance of the four-point function. The exchanged operators can\nhave arbitrary R-charges. Our results extend previous studies on $4\\mathcal{D}$\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconmformal blocks to the most general case, which are the\nessential ingredient for superconformal bootstrap, especially for bootstrapping\nmixed correlators of scalars with independent scaling dimensions and R-charges.\n", "  Investigations of cross-sections of deuteron induced nuclear reactions on\ngold were extended up to 50 MeV by using the standard stacked foil irradiation\ntechnique and high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. New cross-sections are\nreported for the $^{197}$Au(d,xn)$^{197m,197g,195m,195g,193m,193g}$Hg and\n$^{197}$Au(d,x)$^{198m,198g,196m,196g,195,194}$Au nuclear reactions. The\napplication for production of the medically relevant isotopes $^{198}$Au and\n$^{195m,195g,197m,197g}$Hg is discussed, including the comparison with other\ncharged particle induced production routes. The possible use of the\n$^{197}$Au(d,x)$^{197m,197g,195m,193m}$Hg and $^{196m,196g}$Au reactions for\nmonitoring deuteron beam parameters is also investigated.\n", "  We refine and analytically prove an old proposition due to Calabi and Markus\non the shape of timelike geodesics of anti--de Sitter space in the ambient flat\nspace. We prove that each timelike geodesic forms in the ambient space a circle\nof the radius determined by $\\Lambda$, lying on a Euclidean two--plane. Then we\noutline an alternative proof for $AdS_4$. We also make a comment on the shape\nof timelike geodesics in de Sitter space.\n", "  Much efforts are devoted to material structuring in a quest to enhance the\nphotovoltaic effect. We show that structuring light in a way it transfers\norbital angular momentum to semiconductor-based rings results in a steady\ncharge accumulation at the outer boundaries that be utilized for the generation\nof an open circuit voltage or a photogalvanic (bulk photovoltaic) type current.\nThis effect which stems both from structuring light and matter (confinement\npotentials), can be magnified even at fixed moderate intensities, by increasing\nthe orbital angular momentum of light which strengthens the effective\ncentrifugal potential that repels the charge outwards. Based on a full\nnumerical time propagation of the carriers wave functions in the presence of\nlight pulses we demonstrate how the charge buildup leads to a useable voltage\nor directed photocurrent whose amplitudes and directions are controllable by\nthe light pulse parameters.\n", "  Bento \\textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. E 91, 022105 (2015)] recently stated that\nthe Tsallis entropy violates the third law of thermodynamics for $0 < q <1$ in\nthe sub-additive regime. We first show that the division between the regimes $q\n< 1$ and $q > 1$ is already inherent in the fundamental incomplete structure of\nthe deformed logarithms and exponentials underlying the Tsallis entropy. Then,\nwe provide the complete deformed functions and show that the Tsallis entropy\nconforms to the third law of thermodynamics for both super-additive $q < 1$ and\nsub-additive $q > 1$ regimes. Finally, we remark that the Tsallis entropy does\nnot require the use of escort-averaging scheme once it is expressed in terms of\nthe complete deformed functions.\n", "  In this paper, we defined a new multi-component BKP hierarchy which takes\nvalues in a commutative subalgebra of $gl(N,\\mathbb C)$. After this, we give\nthe gauge transformation of this commutative multi-component BKP (CMBKP)\nhierarchy. Meanwhile we construct a new constrained CMBKP hierarchy which\ncontains some new integrable systems including coupled KdV equations under a\ncertain reduction. After this, the quantum torus symmetry and quantum torus\nconstraint on the tau function of the commutative multi-component BKP hierarchy\nwill be constructed.\n", "  Despite the impressive amount of literature on the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, the relevance of symmetry in interpretation is not properly\nacknowledged. In fact, although it is usually said that quantum mechanics is\ninvariant under the Galilean group, the invariance is usually not discussed in\nthe case of the interpretation of the theory. This situation is particularly\npressing for realist positions, which want to know how reality would be if\nquantum mechanics were true. From a realist perspective, it seems reasonable to\nrequire that an interpretation of quantum mechanics, to be admissible,\npreserves the same symmetries of the theory. In this paper we will take a\nrealist standpoint in order to study what physical constraints the Galilean\ngroup imposes on interpretation, and we will extrapolate the conclusions drawn\nfor quantum mechanics to the case of quantum field theory.\n", "  Colloids and proteins alike can bind to lipid bilayers and move laterally in\nthese two-dimensional fluids. Inspired by proteins that generate membrane\ncurvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate to high\ncurvature sites, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid\nbilayers, also sense and respond to membrane geometry? We report the curvature\nmigration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles\nelongated to present well defined curvature fields. However, unlike proteins,\nwhich migrate to minimize membrane bending energy, colloids migrate by an\nentirely different mechanism. By determining the energy dissipated along a\ntrajectory, the energy field mediating these interactions is inferred to be\nlinear in the local deviatoric curvature, as reported previously for colloids\ntrapped at curved interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system,\nhowever, the energy gradients are far larger, so particles move\ndeterministically, whereas the colloids on vesicles move with significant\nfluctuations in regions of weak curvature gradient. By addressing the role of\nBrownian motion, we show that the observed curvature migration of colloids on\nbilayers is indeed a case of curvature capillary migration, with membrane\ntension playing the role of interfacial tension. Furthermore, since this motion\nis mediated by membrane tension and shape, it can be modulated, or even turned\n\"on\" and \"off\", by simply varying these parameters. While particle-particle\ninteractions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, we\nreport here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct\nthe migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers.\n", "  Two tetrad spaces reproducing spherically symmetric spacetime are applied to\nthe equations of motion of higher-order torsion theories. Assuming the\nexistence of conformal Killing vector, two isotropic solutions are derived. We\nshow that the first solution is not stable while the second one confirms a\nstable behavior. We also discuss the construction of the stellar model and show\nthat one of our solution capable of such construction while the other cannot.\nFinally, we discuss the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and show that\none of our models has a tendency to equilibrium.\n", "  This note provides a large deviations principle for a class of biorthogonal\nensembles. We extend the results of Eichelsbacher, Sommerauer and Stotlz to\nmore general type of interactions. Our result covers the case of the singular\nvalues of lower triangular random matrices with independent entries introduced\nby Cheliotis. In particular, we obtain as a consequence a variational\nformulation for the Dykema-Haagerup as it is the limit law for the singular\nvalues of lower triangular matrices with i.i.d. complex Gaussian entries.\n", "  We study the low angular momentum accretion of matter onto Schwarzschild or\nKerr black hole using fully relativistic numerical simulations. Our aim is to\ninclude the rotation of both the gas and the black hole and the presence of the\nmagnetic field into the picture. We compare resulting structure of transonic\nflow with results of 1D pseudo-Newtonian semi-analytical computations of\nnon-magnetized flow.\n", "  We begin by emphasizing that we are dealing with standard Einstein or\nEinstein-Maxwell theory - absolutely no new physics has been inserted. The\nfresh item is that the well-known asymptotically flat solutions of the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory are transformed to a new coordinate system with\nsurprising and (seemingly) inexplicable results. We begin with the standard\ndescription of (Null) Asymptotically Flat Space-Times described in conventional\nBondi-coordinates. After transforming the variables (mainly the asymptotic Weyl\ntensor components) to a very special set of NU (Newman-Unti) coordinates, we\nfind a series of relations totally mimicking standard Newtonian classical\nmechanics and Maxwell theory. The surprising and troubling aspect of these\nrelations is that the associated motion and radiation does not take place in\nphysical space-time. Instead these relations takes place in an unusual\ninherited complex four-dimensional manifold referred to as H-Space that has no\nimmediate relationship with space-time. In fact these relations appear in two\nsuch spaces, H-Space and its dual space H. 1\n", "  Anti-self-dual (ASD) solutions to the Yang-Mills equation (or instantons)\nover an anti-self-dual four manifold, which are invariant under an appropriate\naction of a three dimensional Lie group, give rise, via twistor construction,\nto isomonodromic deformations of connections on C P 1 having four simple\nsingularities. As is well known this kind of deformations is governed by the\nsixth Painlev\\'e equation P vi ({\\alpha}, \\b{eta}, {\\gamma}, {\\delta}) . We\nwork out the particular case of the SU 2 -action on S 4 , obtained from the\nirreducible representation on R 5 . In particular, we express the pa- rameters\n({\\alpha}, \\b{eta}, {\\gamma}, {\\delta}) in terms of the instanton number. The\npresent paper contains the proof of the result anounced in [16].\n", "  We report on the influence of the quantum well thickness on the effective\nband gap and conversion efficiency of In0.12Ga0.88N/GaN multiple quantum well\nsolar cells. The band-to-band transition can be redshifted from 395 to 474 nm\nby increasing the well thickness from 1.3 to 5.4 nm, as demonstrated by\ncathodoluminescence measurements. However, the redshift of the absorption edge\nis much less pronounced in absorption: in thicker wells, transitions to higher\nenergy levels dominate. Besides, partial strain relaxation in thicker wells\nleads to the formation of defects, hence degrading the overall solar cell\nperformance.\n", "  We analyze the tidal forces produced in the spacetime of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack holes. We point out that the radial component of the tidal force changes\nsign just outside the event horizon if the charge-to-mass ratio is close to $1$\nunlike in Schwarzschild spacetime of uncharged black holes, and that the\nangular component changes sign between the outer and inner horizons. We solve\nthe geodesic deviation equations for radially falling bodies towards the\ncharged black hole. We find, for example, that the radial component of the\ngeodesic deviation vector starts decreasing inside the event horizon unlike in\nthe Schwarzschild case.\n", "  We present a microscopic derivation of the 3-dimensional relativistic\nVlasov-Maxwell system as a combined mean field and point-particle limit of an\n$N$-particle system of rigid charges with $N$-dependent radius. The\napproximation holds for typical initial particle configurations, implying in\nparticular propagation of chaos for the respective dynamics.\n", "  Helping students learn to think like a physicist is an important goal of many\nintroductory physics courses. One characteristic distinguishing more\nexperienced physicists from novice students is that they make better use of\nproblem solving as a learning opportunity. Experts were found to spend more\ntime than novices in monitoring their work, reflecting upon their possibly\ndeficient approach to solving a problem, reconsidering their choices as\nnecessary, and extending and refining their knowledge structure. Moreover,\nresearch on worked-out examples suggests that better performing students are\nthose who self-explain, that is, elaborate to themselves what they are learning\nfrom those examples, generate inferences, acknowledge mismatches between their\nown approach and that of the example, and attempt to resolve conflicts\n(self-repair). Indeed, physics instructors often express concern that many\nstudents do not make an effort to learn from their mistakes after the graded\nproblems are returned to them. Here, we discuss an investigation focusing on\nhow well introductory physics students self-diagnose their mistakes in their\nquiz solutions and its effect on subsequent problem solving in different\ninterventions.\n", "  I created the Petersen diagram relative to all the Double Mode High Amplitude\n{\\delta} Scuti stars listed in the AAVSO's International Variable Star Index up\nto date December 29, 2015. For the first time I noticed that the ratio between\nthe two periods P1/P0 seems in evident linear relation with the duration of the\nperiod P0, a finding never explicitly described in literature regarding this\ntopic.\n", "  We consider time fractional stochastic heat type equation\n$$\\partial^\\beta_tu_t(x)=-\\nu(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}\nu_t(x)+I^{1-\\beta}_t[\\sigma(u)\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)]$$ in $(d+1)$\ndimensions, where $\\nu>0$, $\\beta\\in (0,1)$, $\\alpha\\in (0,2]$,\n$d<\\min\\{2,\\beta^{-1}\\}\\a$, $\\partial^\\beta_t$ is the Caputo fractional\nderivative, $-(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an isotropic stable\nprocess, $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)$ is space-time white noise, and $\\sigma:\\R\n\\to\\RR{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous. Mijena and Nane proved in\n\\cite{JebesaAndNane1} that : (i) absolute moments of the solutions of this\nequation grows exponentially; and (ii) the distances to the origin of the\nfarthest high peaks of those moments grow exactly linearly with time.

The structured matrix is obtained as the\nlifting of the multi-shot data. The smooth phase-modulations between shots\nmanifest as null-space vectors of this matrix, which implies that the\nstructured matrix is low-rank. The missing entries of the structured matrix are\nfilled in using a nuclear-norm minimization algorithm subject to the\ndata-consistency. The formulation enables the natural introduction of\nsmoothness regularization, thus enabling implicit motion-compensated recovery\nof fully-sampled as well as under-sampled MS-DW data.\n  Results: Our experiments on in-vivo data show effective removal of the\nghosting artifacts arising from intershot motion in MS-DW data using the\nproposed method. The performance is comparable and better in certain cases than\nconventional phase-based methods.\n  Conclusion: The proposed method can achieve effective unaliasing of\nfully/under-sampled MS-DW images without using explicit phase estimates.\n", "  We study temporal networks of characters in literature focusing on \"Alice's\nAdventures in Wonderland\" (1865) by Lewis Carroll and the anonymous \"La Chanson\nde Roland\" (around 1100). The former, one of the most influential pieces of\nnonsense literature ever written, describes the adventures of Alice in a\nfantasy world with logic plays interspersed along the narrative. The latter, a\nsong of heroic deeds, depicts the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 A.D. during\nCharlemagne's campaign on the Iberian Peninsula. We apply methods recently\ndeveloped by Taylor and coworkers \\cite{Taylor+2015} to find time-averaged\neigenvector centralities, Freeman indices and vitalities of characters. We show\nthat temporal networks are more appropriate than static ones for studying\nstories, as they capture features that the time-independent approaches fail to\nyield.\n", "  This paper presents a \"historical\" formalism for dynamical systems, in its\nHamiltonian version (Lagrangian version was presented in a previous paper). It\nis universal, in the sense that it applies equally well to time dynamics and to\nfield theories on space-time. It is based on the notion of (Hamiltonian)\nhistories, which are sections of the (extended) phase space bundle. It is\ndeveloped in the space of sections, in contradistinction with the usual\nformalism which works in the bundle manifold. In field theories, the formalism\nremains covariant and does not require a spitting of space-time. It considers\nspace-time exactly in the same manner than time in usual dynamics, both being\nparticular cases of the evolution domain. It applies without modification when\nthe histories (the fields) are forms rather than scalar functions, like in\nelectromagnetism or in tetrad general relativity. We develop a differential\ncalculus in the infinite dimensional space of histories. It admits a\n(generalized) symplectic form which does not break the covariance. We develop a\ncovariant symplectic formalism, with generalizations of usual notions like\ncurrent conservation, Hamiltonian vector-fields, evolution vector-field,\nbrackets, ... The usual multisymplectic approach derives form it, as well as\nthe symplectic form introduced by Crnkovic and Witten in the space of\nsolutions.\n", "  We combine elements of the 1998 quantum computing proposals by Privman,\nVagner and Kventsel, and by Kane, with the new idea of nuclear-spin qubit\ninteractions mediated indirectly via the bound outer electrons of impurity\natoms whose nuclear spins 1/2 are the qubits. These electrons, in turn,\ninteract via the two-dimensional electron gas in the quantum Hall effect\nregime. The resulting quantum computing scheme retains all the gate-control and\nmeasurement aspects of the proposal by Kane, but allows qubit spacing at\ndistances of order 100 nm, attainable with the present-day\nsemiconductor-heterostructure device technologies.\n", "  Mutually unbiased bases have been extensively studied in the literature and\nare simple and effective in quantum key distribution protocols, but they are\nnot optimal. Here equiangular spherical codes are introduced as a more\nefficient and robust resource for key distribution. Such codes are sets of\nstates that are as evenly spaced throughout the vector space as possible. In\nthe case the two parties use qubits and face the intercept/resend eavesdropping\nstrategy, they can make use of three equally-spaced states, called a\n\\emph{trine}, to outperform the original four-state BB84 protocol in both speed\nand reliability. This points toward the optimality of spherical codes in\narbitrary dimensions.\n", "  We have found that, in the intensity-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model, a field\ninitially prepared in a statistical mixture of two coherent states, $|\\alpha>$\nand $|-\\alpha>$, evolves toward a pure state.
