system.\nCombining a knowledge of particle quasi-momenta to exponential precision in the\nsystem size with determinant representations of matrix elements of local\noperators coming from the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, we obtain rather general\nanalytical results for the zero-temperature dynamical correlation functions of\nthe density and field operators. Our results thus provide quantitative\npredictions for possible future experiments in atomic gases or optical\nwaveguides.\n", "  In the framework of four-band model of superconductivity in iron arsenides\nproposed by Barzykin and Gor'kov we analyze the gap ratios on hole - like and\nelectron - like Fermi - surface cylinders. It is shown that experimentally\nobserved (ARPES) gap ratios can be obtained only within rather strict limits on\nthe values of pairing coupling constants. The difference of T_c values in 1111\nand 122 systems is reasonably explained by the relative values of partial\ndensities of states. The multiple bands electronic structure of these systems\nleads to a significant enhancement of effective pairing coupling constant\ndetermining T_c, so that high enough T_c values can be achieved even for the\ncase of rather small intraband and interband pairing interactions.\n", "  In this work we present the results of theoretical analysis of magnetic\nquantum oscillations of the velocity and attenuation of high frequency\nultrasound waves traveling in quasi-two-dimensional conductors. We chose a\ngeometry where the wave vector of the longitudinal sound wave and the external\nmagnetic field are directed along the axis of symmetry of the Fermi surface.\nAssuming a moderately weak Fermi surface corrugation we showed that the\noscillating correction to the sound velocity may include a special term besides\nan ordinary contribution originating from quantum oscillations of the charge\ncarriers density of states at the Fermi surface. This additional term is\ngenerated by a \"phase stability\" resonance occurring when the charge carriers\nvelocity in the direction of the wave propagation equals the sound velocity.\nThe two oscillating contributions to the sound velocity are shown to differ in\nphase and shape, and they may have the same order of magnitude. The appearance\nof the extra term may bring significant changes in magnetic quantum\noscillations of the velocity of sound in Q2D conductors, especially at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  Departing from the assumption that pairing is induced by an retarded external\n'bosonic glue', we reformulate the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of\nsuperconductivity as a scaling theory. Conventional superconductors correspond\nwith the asymptotically free case but the theory can be effortlessly\ngeneralized to handle quantum critical metals. We find that superconducting\nTc's are strongly enhanced in the latter when retardation is strong while the\ncoupling is weak. It appears that this simple scaling theory does account quite\nwell for superconducting properties near quantum critical points.\n", "  An investigation of the P/T phase diagram of the quarter-filled organic\nconductors, [EDT-TTF-CONMe2]2X, is reported on the basis of transport and NMR\nstudies of two members, X=AsF6 and Br of the family. The strongly insulating\ncharacter of these materials in the low pressure regime has been attributed to\na remarkably stable charge ordered state confirmed by 13C NMR and the only\nexistence of 1/4 Umklapp e-e scattering favoring a charge ordering instead of\nthe 1D Mott localization seen in (TM)2X which are quarter-filled compounds with\ndimerization. A non magnetic insulating phase instead of the spin density wave\nstate is stabilized in the deconfined regime of the phase diagram. This\nsequence of phases observed under pressure may be considered as a generic\nbehavior for 1/4-filled conductors with correlations.\n", "  The generalised eigenvalues for a pair of $N\\times N$ matrices $(X_1,X_2)$\nare defined as the solutions of the equation $\\det (X_1-\\lambda X_2)=0$, or\nequivalently, for $X_2$ invertible, as the eigenvalues of $X_2^{-1}X_1$. We\nconsider Gaussian real matrices $X_1,X_2$, for which the generalised\neigenvalues have the rotational invariance of the half-sphere, or after a\nfractional linear transformation, the rotational invariance of the unit disk.\nIn these latter variables we calculate the joint eigenvalue probability density\nfunction, the probability $p_{N,k}$ of finding $k$ real eigenvalues, the\ndensities of real and complex eigenvalues (the latter being related to an\naverage over characteristic polynomials), and give an explicit Pfaffian formula\nfor the higher correlation functions $\\rho_{(k_1,k_2)}$. A limit theorem for\n$p_{N,k}$ is proved, and the scaled form of $\\rho_{(k_1,k_2)}$ is shown to be\nidentical to the analogous limit for the correlations of the eigenvalues of\nreal Gaussian matrices. We show that these correlations satisfy sum rules\ncharacteristic of the underlying two-component Coulomb gas.\n", "  The Hubbard-I approximation is generalized to allow for direct evaluation of\nthe equal-time anomalous two-electron propagator for Hubbard model on\ntwo-dimensional square lattice. This propagator is compared against the quantum\nMonte Carlo data obtained by Aimi and Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\\bf 76},\n113708 (2007)] in the limit of strong electron-electron interaction. The\nHubbard-I predictions are in a good qualitative agreement with the Monte Carlo\nresults. In particular, $d$-wave correlations decay as $c r^{-3}$ (\"free\nelectron\" behaviour), if separation $r$ exceeds 2-3 lattice constants. However,\nthe Hubbard-I approximation underestimates coefficient $c$ by a factor of about\nthree. We conclude that the Hubbard-I approximation, despite its simplicity and\nartefacts, captures the qualitative behaviour of the two-particle propagator\nfor the Hubbard model, at least for moderate values of $r$.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic dipole coupling between a metallic surface and an\natom in a thermal state, ground state and excited hyperine state. This\ninteraction results in a repulsive correction and - unlike the electrical\ndipole contribution - depends sensitively on the Ohmic dissipation in the\nmaterial.\n", "  Voronoi cells of a discrete set in Euclidean space are known as generalized\npolyhedra. We identify polyhedral cells of a discrete set through a direction\ncone. For an arbitrary set we distinguish polyhedral from non-polyhedral cells\nusing inversion at a sphere and a theorem of semi-infinite linear programming.\n", "  We define an information topology (I-topology) and a reverse information\ntopology (rI-topology) on the state space of a C*-subalgebra of Mat(n,C). These\ntopologies arise from sequential convergence with respect to the relative\nentropy. We prove that open disks, with respect to the relative entropy, define\na base for them, while Csiszar has shown in 1967 that the analogue is wrong for\nprobability measures on a countably infinite set. The I-topology is finer than\nthe norm topology, it disconnects the convex state space into its faces. The\nrI-topology is intermediate between these topologies. We complete two\nfundamental theorems of information geometry to the full state space, by taking\nthe closure in the rI-topology. The norm topology is too coarse for this aim\nonly for a non-commutative algebra, so its discrepancy to the rI-topology\nbelongs to the quantum domain. We apply our results to the maximization of the\nvon Neumann entropy under linear constraints and to the maximization of quantum\ncorrelations.\n", "  We study a curve of Gibbsian families of complex 3x3-matrices and point out\nnew features, absent in commutative finite-dimensional algebras: a\ndiscontinuous maximum-entropy inference, a discontinuous entropy distance and\nnon-exposed faces of the mean value set. We analyze these problems from various\naspects including convex geometry, topology and information geometry. This\nresearch is motivated by a theory of info-max principles, where we contribute\nby computing first order optimality conditions of the entropy distance.\n", "  C. Voisin and C. Borcea have constructed mirror pairs of families of\nCalabi-Yau threefolds by taking the quotient of the product of an elliptic\ncurve with a K3 surface endowed with a non-symplectic involution. In this\npaper, we generalize the construction of Borcea and Voisin to any prime order\nand build three and four dimensional Calabi-Yau orbifolds. We classify the\ntopological types that are obtained and show that, in dimension 4, orbifolds\nbuilt with an involution admit a crepant resolution and come in topological\nmirror pairs. We show that for odd primes, there are generically no minimal\nresolutions and the mirror pairing is lost.\n", "  We study positive maps of B(K) into B(H) for finite-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces K and H. Our main emphasis is on how Choi matrices and estimates of\ntheir norms with respect to mapping cones reflect various properties of the\nmaps. Special attention will be given to entanglement properties and k-positive\nmaps, in particular tensor products of 2-positive maps. The latter problem is\ndirectly related to the question of n-copy distillability of quantum states,\nfor which we obtain a partial result.\n", "  Convex support, the mean values of a set of random variables, is central in\ninformation theory and statistics. Equally central in quantum information\ntheory are mean values of a set of observables in a finite-dimensional\nC*-algebra A, which we call (quantum) convex support. The convex support can be\nviewed as a projection of the state space of A and it is a projection of a\nspectrahedron.\n  Spectrahedra are increasingly investigated at least since the 1990's boom in\nsemidefinite programming. We recall the geometry of the positive semi-definite\ncone and of the state space. We write a convex duality for general self-dual\nconvex cones. This restricts to projections of state spaces and connects them\nto results on spectrahedra.\n  Really new in this article is an analysis of the face lattice of convex\nsupport by mapping this lattice to a lattice of orthogonal projections, using\nnatural isomorphisms. The result encodes the face lattice of the convex support\ninto a set of projections in A and enables the integration of convex geometry\nwith matrix calculus or algebraic techniques.\n", "  We discuss the subject of Unextendible Product Bases with the orthogonality\ncondition dropped and we prove that the lowest rank non-separable\npositive-partial-transpose states, i.e. states of rank 4 in 3 x 3 systems are\nalways locally equivalent to a projection onto the orthogonal complement of a\nlinear subspace spanned by an orthogonal Unextendible Product Basis. The\nproduct vectors in the kernels of the states belong to a non-zero measure\nsubset of all general Unextendible Product Bases, nevertheless they can always\nbe locally transformed to the orthogonal form. This fully confirms the\nsurprising numerical results recently reported by Leinaas et al. Parts of the\npaper rely heavily on the use of Bezout's Theorem from algebraic geometry.\n", "  The set of quantum states consists of density matrices of order $N$, which\nare hermitian, positive and normalized by the trace condition. We analyze the\nstructure of this set in the framework of the Euclidean geometry naturally\narising in the space of hermitian matrices. For N=2 this set is the Bloch ball,\nembedded in $\\mathbb R^3$. For $N \\geq 3$ this set of dimensionality $N^2-1$\nhas a much richer structure. We study its properties and at first advocate an\napophatic approach, which concentrates on characteristics not possessed by this\nset. We also apply more constructive techniques and analyze two dimensional\ncross-sections and projections of the set of quantum states. They are dual to\neach other. At the end we make some remarks on certain dimension dependent\nproperties.\n", "  We study the inverse problem of inferring the state of a finite-level quantum\nsystem from expected values of a fixed set of observables, by maximizing a\ncontinuous ranking function. We have proved earlier that the maximum-entropy\ninference can be a discontinuous map from the convex set of expected values to\nthe convex set of states because the image contains states of reduced support,\nwhile this map restricts to a smooth parametrization of a Gibbsian family of\nfully supported states. Here we prove for arbitrary ranking functions that the\ninference is continuous up to boundary points. This follows from a continuity\ncondition in terms of the openness of the restricted linear map from states to\ntheir expected values. The openness condition shows also that ranking functions\nwith a discontinuous inference are typical. Moreover it shows that the\ninference is continuous in the restriction to any polytope which implies that a\ndiscontinuity belongs to the quantum domain of non-commutative observables and\nthat a geodesic closure of a Gibbsian family equals the set of maximum-entropy\nstates. We discuss eight descriptions of the set of maximum-entropy states with\nproofs of accuracy and an analysis of deviations.\n", "  Popular music is a key cultural expression that has captured listeners'\nattention for ages. Many of the structural regularities underlying musical\ndiscourse are yet to be discovered and, accordingly, their historical evolution\nremains formally unknown. Here we unveil a number of patterns and metrics\ncharacterizing the generic usage of primary musical facets such as pitch,\ntimbre, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these\npatterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than\nfifty years, thus pointing towards a great degree of conventionalism.\nNonetheless, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of\npitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette, and the growing\nloudness levels. This suggests that our perception of the new would be rooted\non these changing characteristics. Hence, an old tune could perfectly sound\nnovel and fashionable, provided that it consisted of common harmonic\nprogressions, changed the instrumentation, and increased the average loudness.\n", "  We develop in this paper the principles of an associative algebraic approach\nto bulk logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs). We concentrate on the\nclosed $gl(1|1)$ spin-chain and its continuum limit - the $c=-2$ symplectic\nfermions theory - and rely on two technical companion papers, \"Continuum limit\nand symmetries of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain\" [Nucl. Phys. B 871 (2013)\n245-288] and \"Bimodule structure in the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain\" [Nucl.\nPhys. B 871 (2013) 289-329]. Our main result is that the algebra of local\nHamiltonians, the Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra JTL_N, goes over in the\ncontinuum limit to a bigger algebra than the product of the left and right\nVirasoro algebras. This algebra, S - which we call interchiral, mixes the left\nand right moving sectors, and is generated, in the symplectic fermions case, by\nthe additional field $S(z,\\bar{z})=S_{ab}\\psi^a(z)\\bar{\\psi}^b(\\bar{z})$, with\na symmetric form $S_{ab}$ and conformal weights (1,1). We discuss in details\nhow the Hilbert space of the LCFT decomposes onto representations of this\nalgebra, and how this decomposition is related with properties of the finite\nspin-chain. We show that there is a complete correspondence between algebraic\nproperties of finite periodic spin chains and the continuum limit. An important\ntechnical aspect of our analysis involves the fundamental new observation that\nthe action of JTL_N in the $gl(1|1)$ spin chain is in fact isomorphic to an\nenveloping algebra of a certain Lie algebra, itself a non semi-simple version\nof $sp(N-2)$. The semi-simple part of JTL_N is represented by $Usp(N-2)$,\nproviding a beautiful example of a classical Howe duality, for which we have a\nnon semi-simple version in the full JTL image represented in the spin-chain. On\nthe continuum side, simple modules over the interchiral algebra S are\nidentified with \"fundamental\" representations of $sp(\\infty)$.\n", "  The Hubbard model is a simplified description for the evolution of\ninteracting spin-1/2 fermions on a d-dimensional lattice. In a kinetic scaling\nlimit, the Hubbard model can be associated with a matrix-valued Boltzmann\nequation, the Hubbard-Boltzmann equation. Its collision operator is a sum of\ntwo qualitatively different terms: The first term is similar to the collision\noperator of the fermionic Boltzmann-Nordheim equation. The second term leads to\na momentum-dependent rotation of the spin basis. The rotation is determined by\na principal value integral which depends quadratically on the state of the\nsystem and might become singular for non-smooth states. In this paper, we prove\nthat the spatially homogeneous equation nevertheless has global solutions in\nL^\\infty(T^d,C^{2x2}) for any initial data W_0 which satisfies the \"Fermi\nconstraint\" in the sense that 0 <= W_0 <= 1 almost everywhere. We also prove\nthat there is a unique \"physical\" solution for which the Fermi constraint holds\nat all times. For the proof, we need to make a number of assumptions about the\nlattice dispersion relation which, however, are satisfied by the nearest\nneighbor Hubbard model, provided that d >= 3. These assumptions suffice to\nguarantee that, although possibly singular, the local rotation term is\ngenerated by a function in L^2(T^d,C^{2x2}).\n", "  The present paper examines the active control of parametric resonance in\nmodified Rayleigh-Duffing oscillator. We used the method of averaging to obtain\nsteady-state solutions. We have found the critical value of the parametrical\namplitude which indicates the boundary layer where the control is efficient in\nreducing the amplitude vibration. We have also found the effects of excitation\nparameters and time-delay on dynamical of this system with the principal\nparametric resonance. We have obtained for this oscillator the Hopf bifurcation\nand saddle-node bifurcation for certains values of parametric parameters and\ntime-delay. We have studied the influence of parameter $k_2$ which is one of\nthe parameters which modify the ordinary Rayleigh-Duffing oscillator. We have\ndiscussed the appropriate choice of the time-delay and control gain. We finally\nstudied the stability of fixed point and it is found that the appropriate\nchoice of the time-delay can broaden the stable region of the non-trivial\nsteady-state solutions which will enhance the control efficiency. Numerical\nsimulations are performed in order to confirm analytical results.\n", "  In this paper, we studied Rayleigh autonomous oscillator by searching its\nlimit cycle and by studying the stability of the cycle. Through this study, we\nstudied the fixed points of the equation of Rayleigh oscillator and we realized\nthat in reality this oscillator has only one fixed point. What appears new\naccording to our point of view is that we found the cycle limit of the\noscillator using a form of Poincar\\'e-Bendixson theorem. Then, we studied the\nstability of this limit cycle by the method of multiple scales. Finally, the\nmost important is that in this paper we have shown analytically and confirmed\nby numerical simulation using Mathematica that the Rayleigh oscillator exhibits\na bifurcation of PAH\n", "  There is now strong theoretical evidence that a wide range of frustrated\nmagnets should support quantum spin-nematic order in applied magnetic field.\nNonetheless, the fact that spin-nematic order does not break time-reversal\nsymmetry makes it very difficult to detect in experiment. In this article, we\ncontinue the theme begun in [Phys. Rev. B 88, 184430 (2013)], of exploring how\nspin-nematic order reveals itself in the spectrum of spin excitations. Building\non an earlier analysis of inelastic neutron scattering [Phys. Rev. B 91, 174402\n(2015)], we show how the NMR 1/T_1 relaxation rate could be used to identify a\nspin-nematic state. We emphasise the characteristic, universal features of\n1/T_1, using a symmetry-based description of the spin-nematic order parameter\nand its fluctuations.Turning to the specific case of spin-1/2 frustrated\nferromagnets, we show that the signal from competing spin-wave excitations can\nbe suppressed through a judicious choice of nuclear site and field direction.\nAs a worked example, we show how P NMR in the square-lattice frustrated\nferromagnet BaCdVO(PO_4)_2 is sensitive to spin-nematic order.\n", "  Community detection can be considered as a variant of cluster analysis\napplied to complex networks. For this reason, all existing studies have been\nusing tools derived from this field when evaluating community detection\nalgorithms. However, those are not completely relevant in the context of\nnetwork analysis, because they ignore an essential part of the available\ninformation: the network structure. Therefore, they can lead to incorrect\ninterpretations. In this article, we review these measures, and illustrate this\nlimitation. We propose a modification to solve this problem, and apply it to\nthe three most widespread measures: purity, Rand index and normalized mutual\ninformation (NMI). We then perform an experimental evaluation on artificially\ngenerated networks with realistic community structure. We assess the relevance\nof the modified measures by comparison with their traditional counterparts, and\nalso relatively to the topological properties of the community structures. On\nthese data, the modified NMI turns out to provide the most relevant results.\n", "  The currently preferred models of the universe undergo accelerated expansion\ninduced by dark energy. One model for dark energy is a positive cosmological\nconstant. It is consequently of interest to study Einstein's equations with a\npositive cosmological constant coupled to matter satisfying the ordinary energy\nconditions; the dominant energy condition etc. Due to the difficulty of\nanalysing the behaviour of solutions to Einstein's equations in general, it is\ncommon to either study situations with symmetry, or to prove stability results.\nIn the present paper, we do both. In fact, we analyse, in detail, the future\nasymptotic behaviour of T^3-Gowdy symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov\nequations with a positive cosmological constant. In particular, we prove the\ncosmic no-hair conjecture in this setting. However, we also prove that the\nsolutions are future stable (in the class of all solutions). Some of the\nresults hold in a more general setting. In fact, we obtain conclusions\nconcerning the causal structure of T^2-symmetric solutions, assuming only the\npresence of a positive cosmological constant, matter satisfying various energy\nconditions and future global existence. Adding the assumption of T^3-Gowdy\nsymmetry to this list of requirements, we obtain C^0-estimates for all but one\nof the metric components. There is consequently reason to expect that many of\nthe results presented in this paper can be generalised to other types of\nmatter.\n", "  We revisit the maximum-entropy inference of the state of a finite-level\nquantum system under linear constraints. The constraints are specified by the\nexpected values of a set of fixed observables. We point out the existence of\ndiscontinuities in this inference method. This is a pure quantum phenomenon\nsince the maximum-entropy inference is continuous for mutually commuting\nobservables. The question arises why some sets of observables are distinguished\nby a discontinuity in an inference method which is still discussed as a\nuniversal inference method. In this paper we make an example of a discontinuity\nand we explain a characterization of the discontinuities in terms of the\nopenness of the (restricted) linear map that assigns expected values to states.\n", "  This paper considers effect of nonlinear dissipation on the basin boundaries\nof a driven two-well Modified Rayleigh-Duffing Oscillator where pure and unpure\nquadratic and cubic nonlinearities are considered. By analyzing the potential,\nan analytic expression is found for the homoclinic orbit. The Melnikov\ncriterion is used to examine a global homoclinic bifurcation and transition to\nchaos in the case of our oscillator. It is found the effects of unpure\nquadratic parameter and amplitude of parametric excitation on the critical\nMelnikov amplitude $\\mu_{cr}$. Finally, we examine carefully the phase space of\ninitial conditions in order to analyze the effect of the nonlinear damping, and\nparticular how the basin boundaries become fractalized.\n", "  We predict that a low-permittivity oblate body (disk-shaped object) above a\nthin metal substrate (plate with a hole) immersed in a fluidof intermediate\npermittivity will experience a meta-stable equilibrium (restoring force) near\nthe center of the hole. Stability is the result of a geometry-induced\ntransition in the sign of the force, from repulsive to attractive, that occurs\nas the disk approaches the hole---in planar or nearly-planar geometries, the\nsame material combination yields a repulsive force at all separations in\naccordance with the Dzyaloshinskii--Lifshitz--Pitaevskii condition of\nfluid-induced repulsion between planar bodies. We explore the stability of the\nsystem with respect to rotations and lateral translations of the disks, and\ndemonstrate interesting transitions (bifurcations) in the rotational stability\nof the disks as a function of their size. Finally, we consider the reciprocal\nsituation in which the disk--plate materials are interchanged, and find that in\nthis case the system also exhibits meta-stability. The forces in the system are\nsufficiently large to be observed in experiments and should enable measurements\nbased on the diffusion dynamics of the suspended bodies.\n", "  Based on classical statistical thermodynamics, we develop a theoretical\napproach that provides new insight into how macroscopic and microscopic\nphysical properties are bridged via crystal lattice for condensed mat- ters. We\nfind that in order to determine macroscopic physical properties and their\ntemperature dependence in equilibrium disordered state, information about a few\nspecially selected microscopic states, established from geometrical\ncharacteristics of the crystal lattice, is sufficient. These special states are\nfound to be independent of constitument elements as well as of temperature,\nwhich is in contrast to the standard conception in statistical thermodyanamics\nwhere a set of microscopic states mainly contributing to determining\nmacroscopic physical properties depend on temperature and constituent elements.\nValidity and applicability of the theoretical ap- proach is confirmed through\nprediction of macroscopic physical properties in practical alloys, compared\nwith prediction by full thermodynamic simulation. The present findings provide\nefficient and systematic prediction of macroscopic physical properties for\nequilibrium disordered states based on those for special microscopic states\nwithout any information of interactions for given system.\n", "  In the paper energy dependence of femtoscopy characteristics of pion emission\nregion at freeze-out is investigated for collisions of various ions and for all\nexperimentally available energies. For the first time the normalized values of\nradii and volume of source are used for energy dependence. This approach allows\nus to expand the set of interaction types, in particular, on non-symmetrical\nnucleus-nucleus collisions which can be studied in the framework of common\napproach. There are no the sharp changing of femtoscopic parameter values, in\nparticular, $R_{o}/R_{s}$ with increasing of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ which were\npredicted by some phenomenological models as signature of first order phase\ntransition in strongly interacting matter. The generalized parameterization for\nfemtoscopic correlation function is suggested.\n", "  The problem on mapping between two Lagrangian descriptions (using a commuting\n$c$-number spinor $\\psi_{\\alpha}$ or anticommuting pseudovector $\\xi_{\\mu}$ and\npseudoscalar $\\xi_5$ variables) of the spin degrees of freedom of a color\nspinning massive particle interacting with background non-Abelian gauge field,\nis considered. A general analysis of the mapping between a pair of {\\it\nMajorana} spinors $(\\psi_{\\alpha},\\theta_{\\alpha})$ ($\\theta_{\\alpha}$ is some\nauxiliary anticommuting spinor) and a real anticommuting tensor aggregate\n$(S,V_{\\mu},\\!\\,^{\\ast}T_{\\mu \\nu},A_{\\mu},P)$, is presented. A complete system\nof bilinear relations between the tensor quantities, is obtained. The analysis\nwe have given is used for the above problem of the equivalence of two different\nways of describing the spin degrees of freedom of the relativistic particle.\nThe mapping of the kinetic term $(i\\hbar/2)(\\bar{\\theta}\\theta)\n(\\dot{\\bar{\\psi}}\\psi-\\bar{\\psi}\\dot{\\psi})$, the term\n$(1/e)(\\bar{\\theta}\\theta)\\dot{x}_{\\mu}(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\psi)$ that\nprovides a couple of the spinning variable $\\psi$ and the particle velocity\n$\\dot{x}_{\\mu}$, and the interaction term\n$\\hbar(\\bar{\\theta}\\theta)Q^{a}F_{\\mu\\nu}^a (\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}\\psi)$\nwith an external non-Abelian gauge field, are considered in detail. In the\nformer case a corresponding system of bilinear identities including both the\ntensor variables and their derivatives\n$(\\dot{S},\\dot{V}_{\\mu},\\!\\,^{\\ast}\\dot{T}_{\\mu\\nu},\\dot{A}_{\\mu}, \\dot{P})$,\nis defined. A detailed analysis of the local bosonic symmetry of the Lagrangian\nwith the commuting spinor $\\psi_{\\alpha}$, is carried out. A connection of this\nsymmetry with the local SUSY transformation of the Lagrangian containing\nanticommuting pseudovector and pseudoscalar variables, is considered.\n", "  We deduce the canonical brackets for a two (1 + 1)-dimensional (2D) free\nAbelian 1-form gauge theory by exploiting the beauty and strength of the\ncontinuous symmetries of a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) invariant\nLagrangian density that respects, in totality, six continuous symmetries. These\nsymmetries entail upon this model to become a field theoretic example of Hodge\ntheory. Taken together, these symmetries enforce the existence of exactly the\nsame canonical brackets amongst the creation and annihilation operators that\nare found to exist within the standard canonical quantization scheme. These\ncreation and annihilation operators appear in the normal mode expansion of the\nbasic fields of this theory. In other words, we provide an alternative to the\ncanonical method of quantization for our present model of Hodge theory where\nthe continuous internal symmetries play a decisive role. We conjecture that our\nmethod of quantization is valid for a class of field theories that are\ntractable physical examples for the Hodge theory. This statement is true in any\narbitrary dimension of spacetime.\n", "  The present work deals with irreversible Universal thermodynamics. The\nhomogenous and isotropic flat model of the universe is chosen as open\nthermodynamical system and non-equilibrium thermodynamics comes into picture\ndue to the mechanism of particle creation. For simplicity, entropy flow is\nconsidered only due to heat conduction. Further, due to Maxwell-Cattaneo\nmodified Fourier law for non-equilibrium phenomenon, the temperature satisfies\ndamped wave equation instead of heat conduction equation. Validity of\ngeneralized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) has been investigated for\nUniverse bounded by apparent or event horizon with cosmic substrutum as perfect\nfluid with constant or variable equation of state or interacting dark species.\nFinally, we have used three Planck data sets to constrain the thermal\nconductivity \\lambda and the coupling parameter b^2. These constraints must be\nsatisfied in order for GSLT to hold for Universe bounded by apparent or event\nhorizons.\n", "  The construction of a well tuned probability distributions is illustrated in\nsynthetic way, these probability distributions produce faithful realizations of\nthe impact point distributions for particles in silicon strip detector. Their\nuse for track fitting shows a drastic improvements of a factor two, for the low\nnoise case, and a factor three, for the high noise case, respect to the\nstandard approach. The tracks are well reconstructed even in presence of hits\nwith large errors, with a surprising effect of hit discarding. The applications\nillustrated are simulations of the PAMELA tracker, but other type of trackers\ncan be handled similarly. The probability distributions are calculated for the\ncenter of gravity algorithms, and they are very different from gaussian\nprobabilities. These differences are crucial to accurately reconstruct tracks\nwith high error hits and to produce the effective discarding of the too noisy\nhits (outliers). The similarity of our distributions with the Cauchy\ndistribution forced us to abandon the standard deviation for our comparisons\nand instead use the full width at half maximum. A set of mathematical\napproaches must be developed for these applications, some of them are standard\nin wide sense, even if very complex. One is essential and, in its absence, all\nthe others are useless. Therefore, in this paper, we report the details of this\ncritical approach. It extracts physical properties of the detectors, and allows\nthe insertion of the functional dependence from the impact point in the\nprobability distributions. Other papers will be dedicated to the remaining\nparts.\n", "  The renormalization group method is one of the singular perturbation methods\nused in the research of the asymptotic behavior of solution of ordinary\ndifferential equations. In this paper, the equation of VAN der Pol generalized\noscillator that models many physical phenomena is considered. A brief review of\nthe technique is done and is applied to the generalized VAN der Pol oscillator\nto highlight its asymptotic solution.\n", "  We propose a new method to scan the data and then to infer the boundaries of\nthe interplanetary coronal mass ejections, especially the interplanetary events\nobserved by \\emph{Ulysses}.\n  The local minima of the temperatures ratio measured by the spacecraft are\nused to scan and compute the potential boundaries of the interplanetary events.\n  The low plasma beta values are then invoked to detect at least four\nboundaries, two for the beginning and two for the end of an interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejection (ICME). Intermediate boundaries can be identified, as\nindicated by other plasma and magnetic field signatures, and these ones mark\nsubstructures of a complex event.\n  Using the algorithm described in this article, we have compiled a list of the\nICME events registered by \\emph{Ulysses} spacecraft during 2000-2002, with\ntheir boundaries.\n  After a statistical analysis, four relationships of the plasma beta with the\nspeed are then inferred for the computed ICMEs, for each of the four detected\nboundaries in our compiled list.\n  In order to exemplify the method we analyse in detail four events.\n  This method provides premises for an alternative way of semi-automatic\ndetection of the interplanetary events' boundaries observed by \\emph{Ulysses}\nspacecraft.\n  We introduce here also a method for visualisation of the magnetic field\ncomponents that allows detection of plasma insulations and boundaries detection\nfor other satellites too.\n", "  We propose a scheme for generating atomic NOON states via adiabatic passage.\nIn the scheme, a double $\\Lambda$-type three-level atom is trapped in a bimodal\ncavity and two sets of $\\Lambda$-type three-level atoms are translated into and\noutside of two single mode cavities respectively. The three cavities connected\nby optical fibres are always in vacuum states. After a series of operations and\nsuitable interaction time, we can obtain arbitrary large-$n$ NOON states of two\nsets of $\\Lambda$-type three-level atoms in distant cavities by performing a\nsingle projective measurement on the double $\\Lambda$-type three-level atom.\nDue to adiabatic elimination of atomic excited states and the application of\nadiabatic passage, our scheme is robust against the spontaneous emissions of\natoms, the decays of fibres and cavities photon leakage. So the scheme has a\nhigh fidelity and feasibility under the current available techniques.\n", "  Context. Recent findings of line emission at 3.5 keV in both individual and\nstacked X-ray spectra of galaxy clusters have been speculated to have dark\nmatter origin. Aims. If the origin is indeed dark matter, the emission line is\nexpected to be detectable from the Milky Way dark matter halo. Methods. We\nperform a line search in public Chandra X-ray observations of the region near\nSgr A*. We derive upper limits on the line emission flux for the 2.0-9.0 keV\nenergy interval and discuss their potential physical interpretations including\nvarious scenarios of decaying and annihilating dark matter. Results. While find\nno clear evidence for its presence, the upper flux limits are not inconsistent\nwith the recent detections for conservative mass profiles of the Milky Way.\nConclusions. The results depends mildly on the spectral modelling and strongly\non the choice of dark matter profile.\n", "  We study many-party correlations quantified in terms of the Umegaki relative\nentropy (divergence) from a Gibbs family known as a hierarchical model. We\nderive these quantities from the maximum-entropy principle which was used\nearlier to define the closely related irreducible correlation. We point out\ndifferences between quantum states and probability vectors which exist in\nhierarchical models, in the divergence from a hierarchical model and in local\nmaximizers of this divergence. The differences are, respectively, missing\nfactorization, discontinuity and reduction of uncertainty. We discuss global\nmaximizers of the mutual information of separable qubit states.\n", "  Q-balls are non-topological solitonic solutions to a wide class of field\ntheories that possess global symmetries. Here we show that in these same\ntheories there also exists a tower of novel composite Q-ball solutions where,\nwithin one composite Q-ball, positive and negative charges co-exist and swap at\na frequency lower than the natural frequency of an individual Q-ball. These\ncharge-swapping Q-balls are constructed by assembling Q-balls and anti-Q-balls\ntightly such that their nonlinear cores overlap. We explain why charge-swapping\nQ-balls can form and why they swap charges.\n", "  We study s-wave superconductivity in the attractive Hubbard model in an\napplied magnetic field and assume the extreme Pauli limit where the orbital\ncritical field is much greater than the Zeeman critical field. We work at a\ncoupling corresponding roughly to the peak $T_c$ in the BCS to BEC crossover\nwindow and retain the crucial amplitude and phase fluctuations. At low field,\nas expected, the superconductor undergoes a second order thermal transition to\nthe normal state, and is only weakly magnetized near $T_c$. At intermediate\nfields the thermal transition is still second order, but the magnetization is\nsignificantly larger, characteristic of a `breached pair' state. At strong\nfield, the thermal transition is first order and our Monte Carlo reveals the\npresence of a metastable Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. At even\nhigher fields we observe the true FFLO ground state. We present the full\n`field-temperature' phase diagram of this strong coupling problem, revealing\n$T_c$ scales an order of magnitude below the mean field estimate, compute the\nsuperconducting and magnetic order parameters, and map out the directly\nmeasurable magnetic structure factor. We compare these trends to results on the\nPauli limited heavy fermion CeCoIn$_5$, and the cold atomic Fermi gas at\nunitarity. This paper focuses primarily on the homogeneous superconducting\nstate, another deals with thermal effects in the FFLO regime.\n", "  Based on a local mean-field theory approach at Anderson localization, we find\na distribution function of critical temperature from that of disorder. An\nessential point of this local mean-field theory approach is that the\ninformation of the wave-function multifractality is introduced. The\ndistribution function of the Kondo temperature ($T_{K}$) shows a power-law tail\nin the limit of $T_{K} \\rightarrow 0$ regardless of the Kondo coupling\nconstant. We also find that the distribution function of the ferromagnetic\ntransition temperature ($T_{c}$) gives a power-law behavior in the limit of\n$T_{c} \\rightarrow 0$ when an interaction parameter for ferromagnetic\ninstability lies below a critical value. However, the $T_{c}$ distribution\nfunction stops the power-law increasing behavior in the $T_{c} \\rightarrow 0$\nlimit and vanishes beyond the critical interaction parameter inside the\nferromagnetic phase. These results imply that the typical Kondo temperature\ngiven by a geometric average always vanishes due to finite density of the\ndistribution function in the $T_{K} \\rightarrow 0$ limit while the typical\nferromagnetic transition temperature shows a phase transition at the critical\ninteraction parameter. We propose that the typical transition temperature\nserves a criterion for quantum Griffiths phenomena vs. smeared transitions:\nQuantum Griffiths phenomena occur above the typical value of the critical\ntemperature while smeared phase transitions result at low temperatures below\nthe typical transition temperature. We speculate that the ferromagnetic\ntransition at Anderson localization shows the evolution from quantum Griffiths\nphenomena to smeared transitions around the critical interaction parameter at\nlow temperatures.\n", "  We give an explicit relation, up to second-order terms, between scalar-field\nfluctuations defined on spatially-flat slices and the curvature perturbation on\nuniform-density slices. This expression is a necessary ingredient for\ncalculating observable quantities at second-order and beyond in multiple-field\ninflation. We show that traditional cosmological perturbation theory and the\n`separate universe' approach yield equivalent expressions for superhorizon\nwavenumbers, and in particular that all nonlocal terms can be eliminated from\nthe perturbation-theory expressions.\n", "  The asymptotic safety conjecture is examined for quantum gravity in four\ndimensions. Using the renormalisation group, we find evidence for an\ninteracting UV fixed point for polynomial actions up to the 34th power in the\nRicci scalar. The extrapolation to infinite polynomial order is given, and the\nself-consistency of the fixed point is established using a bootstrap test. All\ndetails of our analysis are provided. We also clarify further aspects such as\nstability, convergence, the role of boundary conditions, and a partial\ndegeneracy of eigenvalues. Within this setting we find strong support for the\nconjecture.\n", "  We discuss methods to analyze a quantum Gibbs family in the ultra-cold regime\nwhere the norm closure of the Gibbs family fails due to discontinuities of the\nmaximum-entropy inference. The current discussion of maximum-entropy inference\nand irreducible correlation in the area of quantum phase transitions is a major\nmotivation for this research. We extend a representation of the irreducible\ncorrelation from finite temperatures to absolute zero.\n", "  In the present work we discuss a third alternative to explain the latest\nobservational data concerning the accelerating Universe and its different\nstages. The particle creation mechanism in the framework of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics is considered as a basic cosmic mechanism acting on the flat FRW\ngeometry. By assuming that the gravitationally induced particle production\noccurs under \"adiabatic\" conditions, the deceleration parameter is expressed in\nterms of the particle creation rate which is chosen as a truncated power series\nof the Hubble parameter. The model shows the evolution of the Universe starting\nfrom inflation to the present late time acceleration and it also predicts\nfuture decelerating stage.\n", "  We present results for several light hadronic quantities ($f_\\pi$, $f_K$,\n$B_K$, $m_{ud}$, $m_s$, $t_0^{1/2}$, $w_0$) obtained from simulations of 2+1\nflavor domain wall lattice QCD with large physical volumes and nearly-physical\npion masses at two lattice spacings. We perform a short, O(3)%, extrapolation\nin pion mass to the physical values by combining our new data in a simultaneous\nchiral/continuum `global fit' with a number of other ensembles with heavier\npion masses. We use the physical values of $m_\\pi$, $m_K$ and $m_\\Omega$ to\ndetermine the two quark masses and the scale - all other quantities are outputs\nfrom our simulations. We obtain results with sub-percent statistical errors and\nnegligible chiral and finite-volume systematics for these light hadronic\nquantities, including: $f_\\pi$ = 130.2(9) MeV; $f_K$ = 155.5(8) MeV; the\naverage up/down quark mass and strange quark mass in the $\\bar {\\rm MS}$ scheme\nat 3 GeV, 2.997(49) and 81.64(1.17) MeV respectively; and the neutral kaon\nmixing parameter, $B_K$, in the RGI scheme, 0.750(15) and the $\\bar{\\rm MS}$\nscheme at 3 GeV, 0.530(11).\n", "  We investigate the dispersion relations of strained as well as complex Lieb\nlattices systematically based on the tight-binding method when the\nnearest-neighbor approximation is adopted. We find that edge states will no\nappear for strained Lieb lattices and $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry Lieb lattice\ncannot be obtained.\n", "  In this paper, we present the time evolution of a rotationally axisymmetric\ngas ring around a non rotating black hole using two dimensional grid-based\nhydrodynamic simulation. We show the way in which angular momentum transport is\nincluded in simulations of non-self-gravitating accretion of matter towards a\nblack hole. We use the Shakura-Sunyaev {\\alpha} viscosity prescription to\nestimate the turbulent viscosity for all major viscous stress tensors. We\ninvestigate how a gas ring which is initially assumed to rotate with Keplerian\nangular velocity is accreted on to a black hole and hence forms accretion disc\nin the presence of turbulent viscosity. We show that the centrifugal pressure\nsupported sub-Keplerian flow with shocks forms when the ring starts to disperse\nwith inclusion of relatively small amount of viscosity. But, if the viscosity\nis above the critical value, the shock disappears altogether and the whole disc\nbecomes Kepleiran which is subsonic everywhere except in a region close to the\nhorizon, where it supersonically enters to the black hole. We discovered a\nmultiple valued Mach number solution and the corresponding density\ndistributions that connects matter (a) from the initial Keplerian gas ring to a\nsub-Keplerian disc with shocks in presence of small amount of viscosity and (b)\nfrom the sub-Keplerian flow to a Keplerian disc in presence of huge amount of\nviscosity. We calculate the temporal variations of the magnitude of various\ntime scales which ensure us about the stability of the flow.\n", "  We present a study of the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable regime of accretion onto\nrotating magnetized stars in a set of high grid resolution three-dimensional\n(3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations performed in low-viscosity discs. We\nfind that the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes is determined\nalmost entirely by the fastness parameter omega_s=Omega_star/Omega_K(r_m),\nwhere Omega_star is the angular velocity of the star and Omega_K(r_m) is the\nangular velocity of the Keplerian disc at the disc-magnetosphere boundary\nr=r_m. We found that accretion is unstable if omega_s < 0.6. Accretion through\ninstabilities is present in stars with different magnetospheric sizes. However,\nonly in stars with relatively small magnetospheres, r_m/R_star < 7, do the\nunstable tongues produce chaotic hot spots on the stellar surface and irregular\nlight-curves. At even smaller values of the fastness parameter, omega_s < 0.45,\nmultiple irregular tongues merge, forming one or two ordered unstable tongues\nthat rotate with the angular frequency of the inner disc. This transition\noccurs in stars with even smaller magnetospheres, r_m/R_star < 4.2. Most of our\nsimulations were performed at a small tilt of the dipole magnetosphere, Theta=5\ndegrees, and a small viscosity parameter alpha=0.02. Test simulations at higher\nalpha values show that many more cases become unstable, and the light-curves\nbecome even more irregular. Test simulations at larger tilts of the dipole\nTheta show that instability is present, however, accretion in two funnel\nstreams dominates if Theta > 15 degrees. The results of these simulations can\nbe applied to accreting magnetized stars with relatively small magnetospheres:\nClassical T Tauri stars, accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, and cataclysmics\nvariables.\n", "  In this work we construct an effective four-dimensional model by\ncompactifying a ten-dimensional theory of gravity coupled with a real scalar\ndilaton field on a time-dependent torus. This approach is applied to\nanisotropic cosmological Bianchi type I model for which we study the classical\ncoupling of the anisotropic scale factors with the two real scalar moduli\nproduced by the compactification process. Under this approach, we present an\nisotropization mechanism for the Bianchi I cosmological model through the\nanalysis of the ratio between the anisotropic parameters and the volume of the\nUniverse which in general keeps constant or runs into zero for late times. We\nalso find that the presence of extra dimensions in this model can accelerate\nthe isotropization process depending on the momenta moduli values. Finally, we\npresent some solutions to the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation in\nthe context of Standard Quantum Cosmology.\n", "  In this chapter we review the use of spins in optically-active InAs quantum\ndots as the key physical building block for constructing a quantum repeater,\nwith a particular focus on recent results demonstrating entanglement between a\nquantum memory (electron spin qubit) and a flying qubit (polarization- or\nfrequency-encoded photonic qubit). This is a first step towards demonstrating\nentanglement between distant quantum memories (realized with quantum dots),\nwhich in turn is a milestone in the roadmap for building a functional quantum\nrepeater. We also place this experimental work in context by providing an\noverview of quantum repeaters, their potential uses, and the challenges in\nimplementing them.\n", "  Online social media have greatly affected the way in which we communicate\nwith each other. However, little is known about what are the fundamental\nmechanisms driving dynamical information flow in online social systems. Here,\nwe introduce a generative model for online sharing behavior that is\nanalytically tractable and which can reproduce several characteristics of\nempirical micro-blogging data on hashtag usage, such as (time-dependent)\nheavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. The presented framework\nconstitutes a null model for social spreading phenomena which, in contrast to\npurely empirical studies or simulation-based models, clearly distinguishes the\nroles of two distinct factors affecting meme popularity: the memory time of\nusers and the connectivity structure of the social network.\n", "  We study the continuity of an abstract generalization of the maximum-entropy\ninference - a maximizer. It is defined as a right-inverse of a linear map\nrestricted to a convex body which uniquely maximizes on each fiber of the\nlinear map a continuous function on the convex body. Using convex geometry we\nprove, amongst others, the existence of discontinuities of the maximizer at\nlimits of extremal points not being extremal points themselves and apply the\nresult to quantum correlations. Further, we use numerical range methods in the\ncase of quantum inference which refers to two observables. One result is a\ncomplete characterization of points of discontinuity for $3\\times 3$ matrices.\n", "  We study the stability of two-dimensional inviscid flows in an annulus\nbetween two porous cylinders with respect to three-dimensional perturbations.\nThe basic flow is irrotational, and both radial and azimuthal components of the\nvelocity are non-zero. The direction of the radial flow can be from the inner\ncylinder to the outer one (the diverging flow) or from the outer cylinder to\nthe inner one (the converging flow). It had been shown earlier in Ref.\n\\cite{IM2013a} that, independent of the direction of the radial flow, the basic\nflow can be unstable to small two-dimensional perturbations. In the present\npaper, we prove first that purely radial flow is stable and that flows with\nboth radial and azimuthal components are always stable to axisymmetric\nperturbations. Then we show that both the diverging and converging flows are\nunstable with respect to non-axisymmetric three-dimensional perturbations\nprovided that the ratio of the azimuthal component of the velocity to the\nradial one is sufficiently large. Neutral curves in the space of parameters of\nthe problem are computed and it is demonstrated that for any ratio of the radii\nof the cylinders, the most unstable modes (corresponding to the smallest ratio\nof the azimuthal velocity to the radial one) are the two-dimensional ones. We\nalso consider the corresponding viscous stability problem and construct an\nasymptotic expansion of its solutions for large radial Reynolds numbers. We\ncompute the first-order viscous correction to inviscid eigenvalues and show\nthat the asymptotic results give a good approximation to the viscous\neigenvalues even for moderate values of radial Reynolds number, which indicates\nthat the instability may be observed in real flows.\n", "  We study the continuity of the maximum-entropy inference map for two\nobservables in finite dimensions. We prove that the continuity is equivalent to\nthe strong continuity of the set-valued inverse numerical range map. This gives\na continuity condition in terms of analytic eigenvalue functions which implies\nthat discontinuities are very rare. It shows also that the continuity of the\nMaxEnt inference method is independent of the prior state.\n", "  The paper deals with universal thermodynamics for FRW model of the universe\nbounded by apparent (or event) horizon. Assuming Hawking temperature on the\nhorizon, the unified first law is examined on the horizon for different gravity\ntheories. The results show that equilibrium configuration is preserved with a\nmodification to Bekenstein entropy on the horizon.\n", "  We study Fabry-Perot interference in hybrid devices, each consisting of a\nmesoscopic superconducting disk deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator. Such structures are hypothesized to contain protected\nzero modes known as Majorana fermions bound to vortices. The interference\nmanifests as periodic conductance oscillations of magnitude $\\sim 0.1$ $e^2/h$.\nThese oscillations show no strong dependence on bulk carrier density or sample\nthickness, suggesting that they result from phase coherent transport in surface\nstates. However, the Fabry-Perot interference can be tuned by both top and back\ngates, implying strong electrostatic coupling between the top and bottom\nsurfaces of topological insulator.\n", "  A study of Universal thermodynamics is done in the frame work of RSII brane\nmodel and DGP brane scenario. The Universe is chosen as FRW model bounded by\napparent or event horizon. Assuming extended Hawking temperature on the\nhorizon, the unified first law is examined for perfect fluid (with constant\nequation of state) and modified Chaplygin gas model. As a result there is a\nmodification of Bekenstein entropy on the horizons. Further the validity of the\ngeneralized second law of thermodynamics and thermodynamical equilibrium are\nalso investigated.\n", "  Nonperturbative exact solutions are allowed for quantum integrable models in\none space-dimension. Going beyond this class we propose an alternative Lax\nmatrix approach, exploiting the hidden multi-time concept in integrable systems\nand construct a novel quantum nonlinear Schroedinger model in quasi-two\ndimensions. An intriguing field commutator is discovered, confirming the\nintegrability of the model and yielding its exact Bethe ansatz solution with\nrich scattering and bound-state properties. The universality of the scheme is\nexpected to cover diverse models, opening up a new direction in the field.\n", "  Starting from the earlier notions of stationary action principles, we show\nhow Julian Schwinger's Quantum Action Principle descended from Dirac's\nformulation, which independently led Feynman to his path-integral formulation\nof quantum mechanics. The connection between the two is brought out, and\napplications are discussed. The Keldysh-Schwinger time-cycle method of\nextracting matrix elements in nonequilibrium situations is described. The\nvariational formulation of quantum field theory and the development of source\ntheory constitute the latter part of this work. In this document, derived from\nSchwinger's lectures over four decades, the continuity of concepts, such as\nthat of Green's functions, becomes apparent.\n", "  Networks of biofilaments are essential for the formation of cellular\nstructures that support various biological functions. For the most part,\nprevious studies have investigated the collective dynamics of rod-like\nbiofilaments; however, the shapes of the actual subcellular components are\noften more elaborate. In this study, we considered an active object composed of\ntwo active filaments, which represents the progression from rod-like\nbiofilaments to complex-shaped biofilaments. Specifically, we numerically\nassessed the collective behaviors of these active objects in two dimensions and\nobserved several types of dynamics depending on the density and the angle of\nthe two filaments as shape parameters of the object. Among the observed\ncollective dynamics, a moving density band that we named a `moving smectic' is\nintroduced here for the first time. By analyzing the trajectories of individual\nobjects and the interactions among them, this study demonstrated how\ninteractions among active biofilaments with complex shapes could produce\ncollective dynamics in a non-trivial manner.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the relationship between twisted and untwisted\ncharacter varieties via a specific instance of the Cohomological Hall algebra\nfor moduli of objects in 3-Calabi-Yau categories introduced by Kontsevich and\nSoibelman. In terms of Donaldson--Thomas theory, this relationship is\ncompletely understood via the calculations of Hausel and Villegas of the E\npolynomials of twisted character varieties and untwisted character stacks. We\npresent a conjectural lift of this relationship to the cohomological Hall\nalgebra setting.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a quasistatic dynamical system, which generalizes\nthat of an ordinary dynamical system. Quasistatic dynamical systems are\ninspired by the namesake processes in thermodynamics, which are idealized\nprocesses where the observed system transforms (infinitesimally) slowly due to\nexternal influence, tracing out a continuous path of thermodynamic equilibria\nover an (infinitely) long time span. Time-evolution of states under a\nquasistatic dynamical system is entirely deterministic, but choosing the\ninitial state randomly renders the process a stochastic one. In the\nprototypical setting where the time-evolution is specified by strongly chaotic\nmaps on the circle, we obtain a description of the statistical behaviour as a\nstochastic diffusion process, under surprisingly mild conditions on the initial\ndistribution, by solving a well-posed martingale problem. We also consider\nvarious admissible ways of centering the process, with the curious conclusion\nthat the \"obvious\" centering suggested by the initial distribution sometimes\nfails to yield the expected diffusion.\n", "  We consider a universe filled by a modified generalized Chaplygin gas\ntogether with a pressureless dark matter component. We get a thermodynamical\ninterpretation for the modified generalized Chaplygin gas confined to the\napparent horizon of FRW universe, whiles dark sectors do not interact with each\nother. Thereinafter, by taking into account a mutual interaction between the\ndark sectors of the cosmos, we find a thermodynamical interpretation for\ninteracting modified generalized Chaplygin gas. Additionally, probable relation\nbetween the thermal fluctuations of the system and the assumed mutual\ninteraction is investigated. Finally, we show that if one wants to solve the\ncoincidence problem by using this mutual interaction, then the coupling\nconstants of the interaction will be constrained. The corresponding constraint\nis also addressed. Moreover, the thermodynamic interpretation of using either a\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas or a Chaplygin gas to describe dark energy is also\naddressed throughout the paper.\n", "  Objectives: We develop a framework for the analysis of synergy and redundancy\nin the pattern of information flow between subsystems of a complex network.\nMethods: The presence of redundancy and/or synergy in multivariate time series\ndata renders difficult to estimate the neat flow of information from each\ndriver variable to a given target. We show that adopting an unnormalized\ndefinition of Granger causality one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of\nvariables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a\ngiven target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables.\nConsequently we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two\nindependent sources additively influence the future state of the system,\ndifferently from previous definitions of synergy. Results: We report the\napplication of the proposed approach to resting state fMRI data from the Human\nConnectome Project, showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to\nspace contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, whilst synergy occurs mainly\nbetween non-homologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres. Conclusions:\nRedundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic\npatterns, revealed by the proposed approach. Significance: The pairwise synergy\nindex, here introduced, maps the informational character of the system at hand\ninto a weighted complex network: the same approach can be applied to other\ncomplex systems whose normal state corresponds to a balance between redundant\nand synergetic circuits.\n", "  We take advantage of the wealth of rotation measures data contained in the\nNRAO VLA Sky Survey catalogue to derive new, statistically robust, upper limits\non the strength of extragalactic magnetic fields. We simulate the extragalactic\nmagnetic field contribution to the rotation measures for a given field strength\nand correlation length, by assuming that the electron density follows the\ndistribution of Lyman-$\\alpha$ clouds. Based on the observation that rotation\nmeasures from distant radio sources do not exhibit any trend with redshift,\nwhile the extragalactic contribution instead grows with distance, we constrain\nfields with Jeans' length coherence length to be below 1.7~nG at the $2\\sigma$\nlevel, and fields coherent across the entire observable Universe below 0.65~nG.\nThese limits do not depend on the particular origin of these cosmological\nfields.\n", "  We develop an approach describing nonlinear-optical processes in the\nstrong-field domain characterized by the nonperturbative field-with-matter\ninteraction. The polarization of an isolated atom in the external field\ncalculated via the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation agrees with our analytical findings. For the practically important\ncase of one strong laser field and several weaker fields we derive and\nanalytically solve propagation equations describing high-order (HO)\nwave-mixing, HO parametric amplification and HO stimulated scattering. These\nprocesses provide a way of efficient coherent XUV generation. Some properties\nof HO processes are new in nonlinear optics: essentially complex values of the\ncoefficients in the propagation equations, the super-exponential (hyperbolic)\ngrowing solutions, etc. Finally, we suggest conditions for the practical\nrealization of these processes and discuss published numerical and experimental\nresults where such processes could have been observed.\n", "  Black holes in X-ray binaries are often assumed to be rotating perpendicular\nto the plane of the accretion disk and parallel to the orbital plane of the\nbinary. While the Bardeen-Petterson effect forces the inner part of the\naccretion disk to be aligned with the equatorial plane of a spinning black\nhole, the disk may be warped such that the inclination angle of the outer part\nis different from that of the inner part. In this paper, we identify a possible\nobservational signature of a warped accretion disk in the spectrum of the\npolarization degree of the continuum. Such a signature would provide direct\nevidence for the presence of a warped disk and, potentially, even a measure of\nthe warp radius, which, in turn, could be used to infer the viscosity parameter\nof the disk.\n", "  The degradation of signal in silicon sensors is studied under conditions\nexpected at the CERN High-Luminosity LHC. 200 $\\mu$m thick n-type silicon\nsensors are irradiated with protons of different energies to fluences of up to\n$3 \\cdot 10^{15}$ neq/cm$^2$. Pulsed red laser light with a wavelength of 672\nnm is used to generate electron-hole pairs in the sensors. The induced signals\nare used to determine the charge collection efficiencies separately for\nelectrons and holes drifting through the sensor. The effective trapping rates\nare extracted by comparing the results to simulation. The electric field is\nsimulated using Synopsys device simulation assuming two effective defects. The\ngeneration and drift of charge carriers are simulated in an independent\nsimulation based on PixelAV. The effective trapping rates are determined from\nthe measured charge collection efficiencies and the simulated and measured\ntime-resolved current pulses are compared. The effective trapping rates\ndetermined for both electrons and holes are about 50% smaller than those\nobtained using standard extrapolations of studies at low fluences and suggests\nan improved tracker performance over initial expectations.\n", "  We present methods which allow orders of magnitude increase in the number of\nmodes in linear optics experiments by moving from spatial encoding to temporal\nencoding and using dispersion. This enables significant practical advantages\nfor linear quantum optics and Boson Sampling experiments. Passing consecutively\nheralded photons through time-independent dispersion and measuring the output\ntime of the photons is equivalent to a Boson Sampling experiment for which no\nefficient classical algorithm is reported, to our knowledge. With\ntime-dependent dispersion, it is possible to implement arbitrary\nsingle-particle unitaries. Given the relatively simple requirements of these\nschemes, they provide a path to realizing much larger linear quantum optics\nexperiments including post-classical Boson Sampling machines.\n", "  A single cavity photon mode is expected to modify the Coulomb interaction of\nan electron system in the cavity. Here we investigate this phenomena in a\nparallel double quantum dot system. We explore properties of the closed system\nand the system after it has been opened up for electron transport. We show how\nresults for both cases support the idea that the effective electron-electron\ninteraction becomes more repulsive in the presence of a cavity photon field.\nThis can be understood in terms of the cavity photons dressing the polarization\nterms in the effective mutual electron interaction leading to nontrivial\ndelocalization or polarization of the charge in the double parallel dot\npotential. In addition, we find that the effective repulsion of the electrons\ncan be reduced by quadrupolar collective oscillations excited by an external\nclassical dipole electric field.\n", "  We propose to realize an exotic Haldane superfluid (HSF) phase in an extended\nBose-Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder (i.e., a two-species mixture of\ninteracting bosons). The proposal is confirmed by means of large-scale quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations, with a significant part of the ground-state phase\ndiagram being revealed. Most remarkably, the newly discovered HSF phase\nfeatures both superfluidity and the non-local topological Haldane order. The\neffects induced by varying the number of legs are furthermore explored. Our\nresults shed light on how topological superfluid emerges in bosonic systems.\n", "  We demonstrate an area law bound on the ground state entanglement entropy of\na wide class of gapless quantum states of matter using a strategy called local\nentanglement thermodynamics. The bound depends only on thermodynamic data,\nactually a single exponent, the hyper-scaling violation exponent $\\theta$. All\nsystems in $d$ spatial dimensions obeying our scaling assumptions and with\n$\\theta < d-1$ obey the area law, while systems with $\\theta = d-1$ can violate\nthe area law at most logarithmically. We also discuss the case of\nfrustration-free Hamiltonians and show that to violate the area law more than\nlogarithmically these systems must have an unusually large number of low energy\nstates. Finally, we make contact with the recently proposed $s$-source\nframework and argue that $\\theta$ and $s$ are related by $s=2^\\theta$.\n", "  We investigate the interactions between two identical magnetic impurities\nsubstituted into a graphene superlattice. Using a first-principles approach, we\ncalculate the electronic and magnetic properties for transition-metal\nsubstituted graphene systems with varying spatial separation. These\ncalculations are compared for three different magnetic impurities, manganese,\nchromium, and vanadium. We determine the electronic band structure, density of\nstates, and Millikan populations (magnetic moment) for each atom, as well as\ncalculate the exchange parameter between the two magnetic atoms as a function\nof spatial separation. We find that the presence of magnetic impurities\nestablishes a distinct magnetic moment in the graphene lattice, where the\ninteractions are highly dependent on the spatial and magnetic characteristic\nbetween the magnetic atoms and the carbon atoms, which leads to either\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, through an analysis\nof the calculated exchange energies and partial density of states, it is\ndetermined that interactions between the magnetic atoms can be classified as an\nRKKY interaction.\n", "  We simulate the optical and electrical responses in gallium-doped graphene.\nUsing density functional theory with a local density approximation, we\nsimlutate the electronic band structure and show the effects of impurity doping\n(0-3.91\\%) in graphene on the electron density, refractive index, optical\nconductivity, and extinction coefficient for each doping percentages. Here,\ngallium atoms are placed randomly (using a 5-point average) throughout a\n128-atom sheet of graphene. These calculations demonstrate the effects of hole\ndoping due to direct atomic substitution, where it is found that a disruption\nin the electronic structure and electron density for small doping levels is due\nto impurity scattering of the electrons. However, the system continues to\nproduce metallic or semi-metallic behavior with increasing doping levels. These\ncalculations are compared to a purely theoretical 100\\% Ga sheet for comparison\nof conductivity. Furthermore, we examine the change in the electronic band\nstructure, where the introduction of gallium electronic bands produces a shift\nin the electron bands and dissolves the characteristic Dirac cone within\ngraphene, which leads to better electron mobility.\n", "  We report on the generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs from a\nsemiconductor quantum dot via pulsed resonant biexciton generation. Based on\ntheoretical modeling we optimized the duration of the excitation pulse to\nminimize the laser-induced dephasing and increase the biexciton-to-background\nsingle exciton occupation probability. This results in a high degree of\nentanglement with a concurrence of up to 0.78(6) and a 0.88(3) overlap with a\nmaximally entangled state. Theoretical simulations also indicate a power\ndependent nature of the dephasing during the laser excitation that limits the\ncoherence of the excitation process.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement patterns of photon-added and -subtracted\nfour-mode squeezed vacuum states. Entanglements in different scenarios are\nanalyzed by varying the number of photons added or subtracted in certain modes,\nwhich are referred to as the \"player\" modes, the others being \"spectators.\" We\nfind that the photon-subtracted state can give us higher entanglement than the\nphoton-added state which is in contrast of the two-mode situation. We also\nstudy the logarithmic negativity of the two-mode reduced density matrix\nobtained from the four-mode state which again shows that the state after photon\nsubtraction can possess higher entanglement than that of the photon-added\nstate, and we then compare it to that of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state.\nMoreover, we examine the non-Gaussianity of the photon-added and -subtracted\nstates to find that the rich features provided by entanglement cannot be\ncaptured by the measure of non-classicality.\n", "  We introduce a deterministic chaotic system---the Szilard Map---that\nencapsulates the measurement, control, and erasure protocol by which Maxwellian\nDemons extract work from a heat reservoir. Implementing the Demon's control\nfunction in a dynamical embodiment, our construction symmetrizes Demon and\nthermodynamic system, allowing one to explore their functionality and recover\nthe fundamental trade-off between the thermodynamic costs of dissipation due to\nmeasurement and due to erasure. The map's degree of chaos---captured by the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy---is the rate of energy extraction from the heat bath.\nMoreover, an engine's statistical complexity quantifies the minimum necessary\nsystem memory for it to function. In this way, dynamical instability in the\ncontrol protocol plays an essential and constructive role in intelligent\nthermodynamic systems.\n", "  We propose a novel method to probe primordial gravitational waves by means of\nprimordial black holes (PBHs). When the amplitude of primordial tensor\nperturbations on comoving scales much smaller than those relevant to Cosmic\nMicrowave Background is very large, it induces scalar perturbations due to\nsecond-order effects substantially. If the amplitude of resultant scalar\nperturbations becomes too large, then PBHs are overproduced to a level that is\ninconsistent with a variety of existing observations constraining their\nabundance. This leads to upper bounds on the amplitude of initial tensor\nperturbations on super-horizon scales. These upper bounds from PBHs are\ncompared with other existing bounds.\n", "  Both topological crystalline insulators surfaces and graphene host\nmulti-valley massless Dirac fermions which are not pinned to a high-symmetry\npoint of the Brillouin zone. Strain couples to the low-energy electrons as a\ntime-reversal invariant gauge field, leading to the formation of pseudo-Landau\nlevels (PLL). Here we study periodic pseudo-magnetic fields originating from\nstrain superlattices. We study the low-energy Dirac PLL spectrum induced by the\nstrain superlattice and analyze the effect of various polarized states. Through\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations we establish that, due to the strain\nsuperlattice and PLL electronic structure, a valley-ordered state spontaneously\nbreaking time-reversal and realizing a quantum Hall phase is favored, while\nothers are suppressed.\n", "  Strong electron correlations in rare earth hexaborides can give rise to a\nvariety of interesting phenomena like ferromagnetism, Kondo hybridization,\nmixed valence, superconductivity and possibly topological characteristics. The\ntheoretical prediction of topological properties in SmB$_{6}$ and YbB$_{6}$,\nhas rekindled the scientific interest in the rare earth hexaborides, and\nhigh-resolution ARPES has been playing a major role in the debate. The\nelectronic band structure of the hexaborides contains the key to understand the\norigin of the different phenomena observed, and much can be learned by\ncomparing the experimental data from different rare earth hexaborides. We have\nperformed high-resolution ARPES on the (001) surfaces of YbB$_{6}$, CeB$_{6}$\nand SmB$_{6}$. On the most basic level, the data show that the differences in\nthe valence of the rare earth element are reflected in the experimental\nelectronic band structure primarily as a rigid shift of the energy position of\nthe metal 5$\\textit{d}$ states with respect to the Fermi level. Although the\noverall shape of the $\\textit{d}$-derived Fermi surface contours remains the\nsame, we report differences in the dimensionality of these states between the\ncompounds studied. Moreover, the spectroscopic fingerprint of the 4$\\textit{f}$\nstates also reveals considerable differences that are related to their\ncoherence and the strength of the $\\textit{d}$-$\\textit{f}$ hybridization. For\nthe SmB$_6$ case, we use ARPES in combination with STM imaging and electron\ndiffraction to reveal time dependent changes in the structural symmetry of the\nhighly debated SmB$_{6}$(001) surface. All in all, our study highlights the\nsuitability of electron spectroscopies like high-resolution ARPES to provide\nlinks between electronic structure and function in complex and correlated\nmaterials such as the rare earth hexaborides.\n", "  Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are topological quantum states wherein the electronic\nbands linearly disperse around pairs of nodes, the Weyl points, of fixed (left\nor right) chirality. The recent discovery of WSM materials triggered an\nexperimental search for the exotic quantum phenomenon known as the chiral\nanomaly. Via the chiral anomaly nonorthogonal electric and magnetic fields\ninduce a chiral density imbalance that results in an unconventional negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance, the chiral magnetic effect. Recent theoretical\nwork suggests that this effect does not require well-defined Weyl nodes.\nExperimentally however, it remains an open question to what extent it survives\nwhen chirality is not well-defined, for example when the Fermi energy is far\naway from the Weyl points. Here, we establish the detailed Fermi surface\ntopology of the recently identified WSM TaP via a combination of angle-resolved\nquantum oscillation spectra and band structure calculations. The Fermi surface\nforms spin-polarized banana-shaped electron and hole pockets attached to pairs\nof Weyl points. Although the chiral anomaly is therefore ill-defined, we\nobserve a large negative magnetoresistance (NMR) appearing for collinear\nmagnetic and electric fields as observed in other WSMs. In addition, we show\nexperimental signatures indicating that such longitudinal magnetoresistance\nmeasurements can be affected by an inhomogeneous current distribution inside\nthe sample in a magnetic field. Our results provide a clear framework how to\ndetect the chiral magnetic effect.\n", "  An indentation testing method, which utilizes lateral contact of a long\ncylindrical indenter, is developed for a thin transversely isotropic\nincompressible elastic film deposited onto a smooth rigid substrate. It is\nassumed that the material symmetry plane is orthogonal to the substrate\nsurface, and the film thickness is small compared to the cylinder indenter\nlength. The presented testing methodology is based on a least squares best fit\nof the first-order asymptotic model to the depth-sensing indentation data for\nrecovering three independent elastic moduli which characterize an\nincompressible transversely isotropic material. The case of a weakly\ncompressible material, which is important for biological tissues, is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Veneziano ghost field has been proposed as an alternative source of dark\nenergy whose energy density is consistent with the cosmological observations.\nIn this model, the energy density of QCD ghost field is expressed in terms of\nQCD degrees of freedom at zero temperature. We extend this model to finite\ntemperature to search the model predictions from late time to early universe.\nWe depict the variations of QCD parameters entering the calculations, dark\nenergy density, equation of state, Hubble and deceleration parameters on\ntemperature from zero to a critical temperature. We compare our results with\nthe observations and theoretical predictions existing at different eras. It is\nfound that this model safely defines the universe from quark condensation up to\nnow and its predictions are not in tension with those of the standard\ncosmology. The EoS parameter of dark energy is dynamical and evolves from\n$-1/3$ in the presence of radiation to $-1$ at late time. The finite\ntemperature ghost dark energy predictions on the Hubble parameter well fit to\nthose of $\\Lambda$CDM and observations at late time.\n", "  The image information acquisition ability of a conventional camera is usually\nmuch lower than the Shannon Limit since it does not make use of the correlation\nbetween pixels of image data. Applying a random phase modulator to code the\nspectral images and combining with compressive sensing (CS) theory, a spectral\ncamera based on true thermal light ghost imaging via sparsity constraints (GISC\nspectral camera) is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. GISC spectral\ncamera can acquire the information at a rate significantly below the Nyquist\nrate, and the resolution of the cells in the three-dimensional (3D) spectral\nimages data-cube can be achieved with a two-dimensional (2D) detector in a\nsingle exposure. For the first time, GISC spectral camera opens the way of\napproaching the Shannon Limit determined by Information Theory in optical\nimaging instruments.\n", "  A promising approach to solving hard binary optimisation problems is quantum\nadiabatic annealing (QA) in a transverse magnetic field. An instantaneous\nground state --- initially a symmetric superposition of all possible\nassignments of $N$ qubits --- is closely tracked as it becomes more and more\nlocalised near the global minimum of the classical energy. Regions where the\nenergy gap to excited states is small (e.g. at the phase transition) are the\nalgorithm's bottlenecks. Here I show how for large problems the complexity\nbecomes dominated by $O(\\log N)$ bottlenecks inside the spin glass phase, where\nthe gap scales as a stretched exponential. For smaller $N$, only the gap at the\ncritical point is relevant, where it scales polynomially, as long as the phase\ntransition is second order. This phenomenon is demonstrated rigorously for the\ntwo-pattern Gaussian Hopfield Model. Qualitative comparison with the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick Model leads to similar conclusions.\n", "  We study periodically driven bosonic scalar field theories in the infinite N\nlimit. It is well-known that the free theory can undergo parametric resonance\nunder monochromatic modulation of the mass term and thereby absorb energy\nindefinitely. Interactions in the infinite N limit terminate this increase for\nany choice of the UV cutoff and driving frequency. The steady state has\nnon-trivial correlations and is synchronized with the drive. The O(N) model at\ninfinite N provides the first example of a clean interacting quantum system\nthat does not heat to infinite temperature at any drive frequency.\n", "  We describe an apparatus designed to trap and cool a Yb and Cs mixture. The\napparatus consists of a dual species effusive oven source, dual species Zeeman\nslower, magneto-optical traps in a single ultra-high vacuum science chamber,\nand the associated laser systems. The dual species Zeeman slower is used to\nload sequentially the two species into their respective traps. Its design is\nflexible and may be adapted for other experiments with different mixtures of\natomic species. The apparatus provides excellent optical access and can apply\nlarge magnetic bias fields to the trapped atoms. The apparatus regularly\nproduces 10${}^{8}$ Cs atoms at 13.3 $\\mu$K in an optical molasses, and\n10${}^{9}$ Yb atoms cooled to 22 $\\mu$K in a narrowband magneto-optical trap.\n", "  We experimentally study effect of single circular hole on the critical\ncurrent $I_c$ of narrow superconducting strip with width $W$ much smaller than\nPearl penetration depth $\\Lambda$. We found nonmonotonous dependence of $I_c$\non the location of a hole across the strip and a weak dependence of $I_c$ on\nradius of hole has been found in case of hole with $\\xi \\ll R \\ll W$ ($\\xi$ is\na superconducting coherence length) which is placed in the center of strip. The\nobserved effects are caused by competition of two mechanisms of destruction of\nsuperconductivity - the entrance of vortex via edge of the strip and the\nnucleation of the vortex-antivortex pair near the hole. The mechanisms are\nclearly distinguishable by difference in dependence of $I_c$ on weak magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The dynamics of quantum expectation values is considered in a geometric\nsetting. First, expectation values of the canonical operators are shown to be\nequivariant momentum maps for the action of the Heisenberg group on quantum\nstates. Then, the Hamiltonian structure of Ehrenfest's theorem is shown to be\nLie-Poisson for a semidirect-product Lie group, named the `Ehrenfest group'.\nThe underlying Poisson structure produces classical and quantum mechanics as\nspecial limit cases. In addition, quantum dynamics is expressed in the frame of\nthe expectation values, in which the latter undergo canonical Hamiltonian\nmotion. In the case of Gaussian states, expectation values dynamics couples to\nsecond-order moments, which also enjoy a momentum map structure. Eventually,\nGaussian states are shown to possess a Lie-Poisson structure associated to\nanother semidirect-product group, which is called the Jacobi group. This\nstructure produces the energy-conserving variant of a class of Gaussian moment\nmodels previously appeared in the chemical physics literature.\n", "  In the restricted four-body problem consisting of the Earth, the Moon and the\nSun as the primaries and a spacecraft as the planetoid, we take into account\nthe solar perturbation in the description of the motion of a spacecraft in the\nvicinity of the stable Earth-Moon libration points L4 and L5 both in the\nclassical regime and in the context of effective field theories of gravity. We\nthen evaluate the location of all Lagrangian points in the Earth-Moon system\nwithin the framework of general relativity. For the points L4 and L5, the\ncorrections of coordinates are of order a few millimeters. After that, we set\nup a scheme where the theory which is quantum corrected has as its classical\ncounterpart the Einstein theory, instead of the Newtonian one. By virtue of the\neffective-gravity correction to the longdistance form of the potential among\ntwo point masses, all terms involving the ratio between the gravitational\nradius of the primary and its separation from the planetoid get modified.\nWithin this framework, for the Lagrangian points of stable equilibrium, we find\nquantum corrections of order two millimeters, whereas for Lagrangian points of\nunstable equilibrium we find quantum corrections below a millimeter. Finally,\ngeneral relativity corrections to Newtonian position of collinear Lagrangian\npoints turn out to be below the millimiter, whereas on stable equilibrium\npoints they are of order of a few millimiters.\n", "  We introduce a strategy to study the parameter space of the general,\nCP-conserving, two-Higgs-doublet Model (2HDM) with a softly broken Z_2-symmetry\nby means of a new \"hybrid\" basis. In this basis the input parameters are the\nmeasured values of the mass of the observed Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs\nboson and its coupling strength to vector boson pairs, the mass of the second\nCP-even Higgs boson, the ratio of neutral Higgs vacuum expectation values, and\nthree additional dimensionless parameters. Using the hybrid basis, we present\nnumerical scans of the 2HDM parameter space where we survey available parameter\nregions and analyze model constraints. From these results, we define a number\nof benchmark scenarios that capture different aspects of non-standard Higgs\nphenomenology that are of interest for future LHC Higgs searches.\n", "  Machine-designed control of complex devices or experiments can discover\nstrategies superior to those developed via simplified models. We describe an\nonline optimization algorithm based on Gaussian processes and apply it to\noptimization of the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). BEC is\ntypically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is approximately\noptimal for s-wave, ergodic dynamics with two-body interactions and no other\nloss rates, but likely sub-optimal for many real experiments. Machine learning\nusing a Gaussian process, in contrast, develops a statistical model of the\nrelationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC\nproduced. This is an online process, and an active one, as the Gaussian process\nmodel updates on the basis of each subsequent experiment and proposes a new set\nof parameters as a result. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine\nlearner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times\nfewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique.\nFurthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine\nwhich parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant,\nproviding insight into the optimization process.\n", "  Doubly ionized silicon (SiIII) is a powerful tracer of diffuse ionized gas\ninside and outside of galaxies. It can be observed in the local Universe in\nultraviolet (UV) absorption against bright extragalactic background sources. We\nhere present an extensive study of intervening SiIII-selected absorbers and\ntheir relation to the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at low redshift\n(z<=0.1), based on the analysis of UV absorption spectra along 303\nextragalactic lines of sight obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph\n(COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Along a total redshift path of\nDz=24 we identify 69 intervening SiIII systems that all show associated\nabsorption from other low and high ions. We derive a bias-corrected number\ndensity of dN/dz(SiIII)=2.5 for absorbers with column densities log\nN(SiIII)>12.2. We develop a geometrical model for the absorption-cross section\nof the CGM around the local galaxy population and find excellent agreement\nbetween the model predictions and the observations. We further compare\nredshifts and positions of the absorbers with that of ~64,000 galaxies using\narchival galaxy-survey data. For the majority of the absorbers we identify\npossible host galaxies within 300 km/s of the absorbers and derive impact\nparameters rho<200 kpc, demonstrating that the spatial distributions of SiIII\nabsorbers and galaxies are highly correlated. Our study indicates that the\nmajority of SiIII-selected absorbers in our sample trace the CGM of nearby\ngalaxies within their virial radii at a typical covering fraction of ~70 per\ncent. From a detailed ionization model we estimate that diffuse gas in the CGM\naround galaxies, as traced by SiIII, contains substantially more baryonic mass\nthan their neutral interstellar medium.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal is a novel state of quantum matter,\ncharacterized by the gapless bulk four-fold degeneracy near Fermi energy. Soon\nafter its discovery, the classification of stable 3D Dirac semimetals with\ninversion and rotational symmetry have been studied. However, only ten out of\nthirty-two point groups have both inversion and rotational symmetry, and we\nneed a more complete classification of stable 3D Dirac semimetals. Here we\nclassify stable 3D Dirac semimetals with reflection symmetry and rotational\nsymmetry in the presence of time reversal symmetry, which belong to seventeen\ndifferent point groups. These systems include the systems preserving inversion\nsymmetry except $\\mathrm{C_{3i}}$. They have two classes of reflection\nsymmetry, with the mirror plane parallel to rotation axis and the mirror plane\nperpendicular to rotation axis. In both cases two types of Dirac semimetals are\ndetermined by four different reflection symmetries. The first type of Dirac\nsemimetals will appear through accidental band crossing (ABC). The second type\nof Dirac semimetals have a Dirac point at a time reversal invariant momentum\n(TBC). We show that in both mirror parallel and perpendicular cases, $C_{2,3}$\nsymmetry can only protect stable Dirac points via TBC, while $C_{4,6}$ symmetry\ncan have stable Dirac points as ABC or TBC. We further discuss that Weyl line\nnodes and Dirac semimetal can exist in Brillouin zone at the same time using\n$\\mathrm{C_{4v}}$ symmetry as an example. Finally we classify Dirac line nodes\nand Weyl line nodes to show in which types of mirror plane they can exist.\n", "  In the present work, flat FRW model of the universe is considered to be an\nisolated open thermodynamical system where non-equilibrium prescription has\nbeen studied using the mechanism of particle creation. In the perspective of\nrecent observational evidences, the matter distribution in the universe is\nassumed to be dominated by dark matter and dark energy. The dark matter is\nchosen as dust while for dark energy, the following choices are considered: (i)\nPerfect fluid with constant equation of state and (ii) Holographic dark energy.\nIn both the cases, the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics\n(GSLT) which states that the total entropy of the fluid as well as that of the\nhorizon should not decrease with the evolution of the universe, has been\nexamined graphically for universe bounded by the event horizon. It is found\nthat GSLT holds in both the cases with some restrictions on the interacting\ncoupling parameter.\n", "  We use 350 mu angular diameter estimates from Planck to test the idea that\nsome galaxies contain exceptionally cold (10-13 K) dust, since colder dust\nimplies a lower surface brightness radiation field illuminating the dust, and\nhence a greater physical extent for a given luminosity. The galaxies identified\nfrom their spectral energy distributions as containing cold dust do indeed show\nthe expected larger 350 mu diameters. For a few cold dust galaxies where\nHerschel data are available we are able to use submillimetre maps or surface\nbrightness profiles to locate the cold dust, which as expected generally lies\noutside the optical galaxy.\n", "  We consider the conformal blocks in the theories with extended conformal\nW-symmetry for the integer Virasoro central charges. We show that these blocks\nfor the generalized twist fields on sphere can be computed exactly in terms of\nthe free field theory on the covering Riemann surface, even for a non-abelian\nmonodromy group. The generalized twist fields are identified with particular\nprimary fields of the W-algebra, and we propose a straightforward way to\ncompute their W-charges. We demonstrate how these exact conformal blocks can be\neffectively computed using the technique arisen from the gauge theory/CFT\ncorrespondence. We discuss also their direct relation with the isomonodromic\ntau-function for the quasipermutation monodromy data, which can be an\nencouraging step on the way of definition of generic conformal blocks for\nW-algebra using the isomonodromy/CFT correspondence.\n", "  For more than 35 years theorists have studied quantum or Casimir friction,\nwhich occurs when two smooth bodies move transversely to each other,\nexperiencing a frictional dissipative force due to quantum electromagnetic\nfluctuations, which break time-reversal symmetry. These forces are typically\nvery small, unless the bodies are nearly touching, and consequently such\neffects have never been observed, although lateral Casimir forces have been\nseen for corrugated surfaces. Partly because of the lack of contact with\nphenomena, theoretical predictions for the frictional force between parallel\nplates, or between a polarizable atom and a metallic plate, have varied widely.\nHere we review the history of these calculations, show that theoretical\nconsensus is emerging, and offer some hope that it might be possible to\nexperimentally confirm this phenomenon of dissipative quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  We present an approach based on a dimer expansion which describes low-energy\nsinglet excitations (singlons) in spin-$\\frac12$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on\nsimple square lattice. An operator (\"effective Hamiltonian\") is constructed\nwhose eigenvalues give the singlon spectrum. The \"effective Hamiltonian\" looks\nlike a Hamiltonian of a spin-$\\frac12$ magnet in strong external magnetic field\nand it has a gapped spectrum. It is found that singlet states lie above triplet\nones (magnons) in the whole Brillouin zone except in the vicinity of the point\n$(\\pi,0)$, where their energies are slightly smaller. Based on this finding, we\nsuggest that a magnon decay is possible near $(\\pi,0)$ into another magnon and\na singlon which may contribute to the dip of the magnon spectrum near $(\\pi,0)$\nand reduce the magnon lifetime. It is pointed out that the singlon-magnon\ncontinuum may contribute to the continuum of excitations observed recently near\n$(\\pi,0)$.\n", "  We study the effect of higher-derivative terms on holographic Schwinger\neffect by introducing the Gauss-Bonnet term in the gravity sector. Anti-de\nSitter (AdS) soliton background is considered which is dual to confining phase\nof the boundary field theory. By calculating the potential between the produced\npair, we find that larger Gauss-Bonnet factor $\\lambda$ makes the pair lighter.\nWe apply numerical method to calculate the production rate for various cases.\nThe results show that the Gauss-Bonnet term enhances the production rate. The\ncritical behaviors near the two critical values of the electric field are also\ninvestigated, and it is found that the two critical indexes are not affected by\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term and thus suggests a possible universality.\n", "  When scale symmetry is implemented into hidden local symmetry in low-energy\nstrong interactions to arrive at a scale-invariant hidden local symmetric (HLS)\ntheory, the scalar $f_0(500)$ may be interpreted as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\n(pNG) boson, i.e., dilaton, of spontaneously broken scale invariance, joining\nthe pseudo-scalar pNG bosons $\\pi$ and the matter fields $V=(\\rho,\\omega)$ as\nrelevant degrees of freedom. Implementing the skyrmion-half-skyrmion transition\npredicted at large $N_c$ in QCD at a density roughly twice the nuclear matter\ndensity found in the crystal simulation of dense skyrmion matter, we determine\nthe intrinsically density-dependent (IDD) \"bare parameters\" of the\nscale-invariant HLS Lagrangian matched to QCD at a matching scale $\\Lambda_M$.\nThe resulting effective Lagrangian, with the parameters scaling with the\ndensity of the system, is applied to nuclear matter and dense baryonic matter\nrelevant to massive compact stars by means of the double-decimation\nrenormalization-group $V_{lowk}$ formalism. We satisfactorily post-dict the\nproperties of normal nuclear matter and more significantly {\\it predict} the\nEoS of dense compact-star matter that quantitatively accounts for the presently\navailable data coming from both the terrestrial and space laboratories. We\ninterpret the resulting structure of compact-star matter as revealing how the\ncombination of hidden-scale symmetry and hidden local symmetry manifests itself\nin compressed baryonic matter.\n", "  Processes involving narrow jets receive perturbative corrections enhanced by\nlogarithms of the jet opening angle and the ratio of the energies inside and\noutside the jets. Analyzing cone-jet processes in effective field theory, we\nfind that in addition to soft and collinear fields their description requires\ndegrees of freedom which are simultaneously soft and collinear to the jets.\nThese collinear-soft particles can resolve individual collinear partons,\nleading to a complicated multi-Wilson-line structure of the associated\noperators at higher orders. Our effective field theory provides, for the first\ntime, a factorization formula for a cone-jet process, which fully separates the\nphysics at different energy scales. Its renormalization-group equations control\nall logarithmically enhanced higher-order terms, in particular also the\nnon-global logarithms.\n", "  We develop an approach for performing scaling analysis of $N$-step Random\nWalks (RWs). The mean square end-to-end distance,\n$\\langle\\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\\rangle$, is written in terms of inner persistence\nlengths (IPLs), which we define by the ensemble averages of dot products\nbetween the walker's position and displacement vectors, at the $j$-th step. For\nRW models statistically invariant under orthogonal transformations, we\nanalytically introduce a relation between $\\langle\\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\\rangle$ and\nthe persistence length, $\\lambda_{N}$, which is defined as the mean end-to-end\nvector projection in the first step direction. For Self-Avoiding Walks (SAWs)\non 2D and 3D lattices we introduce a series expansion for $\\lambda_{N}$, and by\nMonte Carlo simulations we find that $\\lambda_{\\infty}$ is equal to a constant;\nthe scaling corrections for $\\lambda_{N}$ can be second and higher order\ncorrections to scaling for $\\langle\\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\\rangle$. Building SAWs with\ntypically one hundred steps, we estimate the exponents $\\nu_{0}$ and\n$\\Delta_{1}$ from the IPL behavior as function of $j$. The obtained results are\nin excellent agreement with those in the literature. This shows that only an\nensemble of paths with the same length is sufficient for determining the\nscaling behavior of $\\langle\\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\\rangle$, being that the whole\ninformation needed is contained in the inner part of the paths.\n", "  We construct effective Lagrangians, and corresponding counting schemes, valid\nto describe the dynamics of the lowest lying large N stable massive composite\nstate emerging in strongly coupled theories. The large N counting rules can now\nbe employed when computing quantum corrections via an effective Lagrangian\ndescription. The framework allows for systematic investigations of composite\ndynamics of non-Goldstone nature. Relevant examples are the lightest glueball\nstates emerging in any Yang-Mills theory. We further apply the effective\napproach and associated counting scheme to composite models at the electroweak\nscale. To illustrate the formalism we consider the possibility that the Higgs\nemerges as: the lightest glueball of a new composite theory; the large N scalar\nmeson in models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking; the large N\npseudodilaton useful also for models of near-conformal dynamics. For each of\nthese realisations we determine the leading N corrections to the electroweak\nprecision parameters. The results nicely elucidate the underlying large N\ndynamics and can be used to confront first principle lattice results featuring\ncomposite scalars with a systematic effective approach.\n", "  The first search for supersymmetry in the vector-boson fusion topology is\npresented. The search targets final states with at least two leptons, large\nmissing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large separation in rapidity.\nThe data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse\nfemtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV collected with the\nCMS detector at the CERN LHC. The observed dijet invariant mass spectrum is\nfound to be consistent with the expected standard model prediction. Upper\nlimits are set on the cross sections for chargino and neutralino production\nwith two associated jets, assuming the supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton\nto be the lightest slepton and the lightest slepton to be lighter than the\ncharginos. For a so-called compressed-mass-spectrum scenario in which the mass\ndifference between the lightest supersymmetric particle and the next lightest,\nmass-degenerate, gaugino particles is 50 GeV, a mass lower limit of 170 GeV is\nset for these latter two particles.\n", "  Standard quantum state reconstruction techniques indicate that a detection\nefficiency of $0.5$ is an absolute threshold below which quantum interferences\ncannot be measured. However, alternative statistical techniques suggest that\nthis threshold can be overcome at the price of increasing the statistics used\nfor the reconstruction. In the following we present numerical experiments\nproving that quantum interferences can be measured even with a detection\nefficiency smaller than $0.5$. At the same time we provide a guideline for\nhandling the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states based on homodyne\ndata collected by low efficiency detectors.\n", "  We introduce a new method for stacking voids and deriving their profile that\ngreatly increases the potential of voids as a tool for precision cosmology.\nGiven that voids are highly non-spherical and have most of their mass at their\nedge, voids are better described relative to their boundary rather than\nrelative to their centre, as in the conventional spherical stacking approach.\nThe boundary profile is obtained by computing the distance of each volume\nelement from the void boundary. Voids can then be stacked and their profiles\ncomputed as a function of this boundary distance. This approach enhances the\nweak lensing signal of voids, both shear and convergence, by a factor of two\nwhen compared to the spherical stacking method. It also results in steeper void\ndensity profiles that are characterised by a very slow rise inside the void and\na pronounced density ridge at the void boundary. The resulting boundary density\nprofile is self-similar when rescaled by the thickness of the density ridge,\nimplying that the average rescaled profile is independent of void size. The\nboundary velocity profile is characterized by outflows in the inner regions\nwhose amplitude scales with void size, and by a strong inflow into the\nfilaments and walls delimiting the void. This new picture enables a\nstraightforward discrimination between collapsing and expanding voids both for\nindividual objects as well as for stacked samples.\n", "  The Onsager rule determines the frequencies of quantum oscillations in\nmagnetic fields. We show that this rule remains intact to an excellent\napproximation in the mixed-vortex state of the underdoped cuprates even though\nthe Landau level index $n$ may be fairly low, $n\\sim 10$. The models we\nconsider are fairly general, consisting of a variety of density wave states\ncombined with $d$-wave superconductivity within a mean field theory. Vortices\nare introduced as quenched disorder and averaged over many realizations, which\ncan be considered as snapshots of a vortex liquid state. We also show that the\noscillations ride on top of a field independent density of states, $\\rho(B)$,\nfor higher fields. This feature appears to be consistent with recent specific\nheat measurements [C. Marcenat, et al. Nature Comm. {\\bf 6}, 7927 (2015)]. At\nlower fields we model the system as an ordered vortex lattice, and show that\nits density of states follows a dependence $\\rho(B)\\propto \\sqrt{B}$ in\nagreement with the semiclassical results [G. E. Volovik, JETP Lett. {\\bf 58},\n469 (1993)].\n", "  Target space duality is one of the most profound properties of string theory.\nHowever it customarily requires that the background fields satisfy certain\ninvariance conditions in order to perform it consistently; for instance the\nvector fields along the directions that T-duality is performed have to generate\nisometries. In the present paper we examine in detail the possibility to\nperform T-duality along non-isometric directions. In particular, based on a\nrecent work of Kotov and Strobl, we study gauged 2D sigma models where gauge\ninvariance for an extended set of gauge transformations imposes weaker\nconstraints than in the standard case, notably the corresponding vector fields\nare not Killing. This formulation enables us to follow a procedure analogous to\nthe derivation of the Buscher rules and obtain two dual models, by integrating\nout once the Lagrange multipliers and once the gauge fields. We show that this\nconstruction indeed works in non-trivial cases by examining an explicit class\nof examples based on step 2 nilmanifolds.\n", "  The current status of Mach's principle is discussed within the context of\ngeneral relativity. The inertial properties of a particle are determined by its\nmass and spin, since these characterize the irreducible unitary representations\nof the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. The origin of the inertia of mass and\nintrinsic spin are discussed and the inertia of intrinsic spin is studied via\nthe coupling of intrinsic spin with rotation. The implications of spin-rotation\ncoupling and the possibility of history dependence and nonlocality in\nrelativistic physics are briefly mentioned.\n", "  We introduce a new optical tool - a \"two-dimensional optical centrifuge\",\ncapable of aligning molecules in extreme rotational states. Unlike the\nconventional centrifuge, which confines the molecules in the plane of their\nrotation, its two-dimensional version aligns the molecules along a well-defined\naxis, similarly to the effect of a single linearly polarized laser pulse, but\nat a much higher level of rotational excitation. The increased robustness of\nultra-high rotational states with respect to collisions results in a longer\nlife time of the created alignment in dense media, offering new possibilities\nfor studying and utilizing aligned molecular ensembles under ambient\nconditions.\n", "  There are contextual sets of multiple qubits whose commutation is\nparametrized thanks to the coset geometry $\\mathcal{G}$ of a subgroup $H$ of\nthe two-generator free group $G=\\left\\langle x,y\\right\\rangle$. One defines\ngeometric contextuality from the discrepancy between the commutativity of\ncosets on $\\mathcal{G}$ and that of quantum observables.It is shown in this\npaper that Kleinian subgroups $K=\\left\\langle f,g\\right\\rangle$ that are\nnon-compact, arithmetic, and generated by two elliptic isometries $f$ and $g$\n(the Martin-Maclachlan classification), are appropriate contextuality filters.\nStandard contextual geometries such as some thin generalized polygons (starting\nwith Mermin's $3 \\times 3$ grid) belong to this frame. The Bianchi groups\n$PSL(2,O\\_d)$, $d \\in \\{1,3\\}$ defined over the imaginary quadratic field\n$O\\_d=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$ play a special role.\n", "  We show how thermodynamic properties of molecular models can be computed over\na large, multidimensional parameter space by combining multistate reweighting\nanalysis with a linear basis function approach. This approach reduces the\ncomputational cost to estimate thermodynamic properties from molecular\nsimulations for over 130,000 tested parameter combinations from over a thousand\nCPU years to tens of CPU days. This speed increase is achieved primarily by\ncomputing the potential energy as a linear combination of basis functions,\ncomputed from either modified simulation code or as the difference of energy\nbetween two reference states, which can be done without any simulation code\nmodification. The thermodynamic properties are then estimated with the\nMultistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a function of multiple model\nparameters without the need to define a priori how the states are connected by\na pathway. Instead, we adaptively sample a set of points in parameter space to\ncreate mutual configuration space overlap. The existence of regions of poor\nconfiguration space overlap are detected by analyzing the eigenvalues of the\nsampled states' overlap matrix. The configuration space overlap to sampled\nstates is monitored alongside the mean and maximum uncertainty to determine\nconvergence, as neither the uncertainty or the configuration space overlap\nalone is a sufficient metric of convergence.\n  This adaptive sampling scheme is demonstrated by estimating with high\nprecision the solvation free energies of charged particles of Lennard-Jones\nplus Coulomb functional form. We also compute entropy, enthalpy, and radial\ndistribution functions of unsampled parameter combinations using only the data\nfrom these sampled states and use the free energies estimates to examine the\ndeviation of simulations from the Born approximation to the solvation free\nenergy.\n", "  Bubble-driven inertial pumps are a novel method of moving liquids through\nmicrochannels. We combine high-speed imaging, computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) simulations and an effective one-dimensional model to study the\nfundamentals of inertial pumping. For the first time, single-pulse transient\nflow through U-shaped microchannels is imaged over the entire pump cycle with\n4-microsecond temporal resolution. Observations confirm the fundamental N-shape\nflow profile predicted earlier by theory and simulations. Experimental flow\nrates are used to calibrate the CFD and one-dimensional models to extract an\neffective bubble strength. Then the frequency dependence of inertial pumping is\nstudied both experimentally and numerically. The pump efficiency is found to\ngradually decrease once the successive pulses start to overlap in time.\n", "  We study the effects of quasiparticle interactions in a quasi-two dimensional\n(quasi-2D), zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar atoms, which\ncan exhibit a roton-maxon feature in its quasiparticle spectrum. Our focus is\nthe Beliaev damping process, in which a quasiparticle collides with the\ncondensate and resonantly decays into a pair of quasiparticles. Remarkably, the\nrate for this process exhibits a highly non-trivial dependence on the\nquasiparticle momentum and the dipolar interaction strength. For weak\ninteractions, the low energy phonons experience no damping, and the higher\nenergy quasiparticles undergo anomalously weak damping. In contrast, the\nBeliaev damping rates become anomalously large for stronger dipolar\ninteractions, as rotons become energetically accessible as final states.\nFurther, we find a qualitative anisotropy in the damping rates when the dipoles\nare tilted off the axis of symmetry. Our study reveals the unconventional\nnature of Beliaev damping in dipolar condensates, and has important\nimplications for ongoing studies of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics in\nthese systems.\n", "  This article is a detailed version of our short letter `On equilibrium\npartition function for non-relativistic fluid' [arXiv:1505.05677] extended to\ninclude an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry. We construct a relativistic system, which\nwe call null fluid and show that it is in one-to-one correspondence with a\nGalilean fluid living in one lower dimension. The correspondence is based on\nlight cone reduction, which is known to reduce the Poincare symmetry of a\ntheory to Galilean in one lower dimension. We show that the proposed null fluid\nand the corresponding Galilean fluid have exactly same symmetries,\nthermodynamics, constitutive relations, and equilibrium partition to all orders\nin derivative expansion. We also devise a mechanism to introduce $U(1)$ anomaly\nin even dimensional Galilean theories using light cone reduction, and study its\neffect on the constitutive relations of a Galilean Fluid.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) under\ntoroidal compactification and RG flows, finding evidence that WGC bounds for\nsingle photons become weaker in the infrared. By contrast, we find that a\nphoton satisfying the WGC will not necessarily satisfy it after toroidal\ncompactification when black holes charged under the Kaluza-Klein photons are\nconsidered. Doing so either requires an infinite number of states of different\ncharges to satisfy the WGC in the original theory or a restriction on allowed\ncompactification radii. These subtleties suggest that if the Weak Gravity\nConjecture is true, we must seek a stronger form of the conjecture that is\nrobust under compactification. We propose a \"Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture\"\nthat meets this requirement: a superextremal particle should exist for every\ncharge in the charge lattice. The perturbative heterotic string satisfies this\nconjecture. We also use compactification to explore the extent to which the WGC\napplies to axions. We argue that gravitational instanton solutions in theories\nof axions coupled to dilaton-like fields are analogous to extremal black holes,\nmotivating a WGC for axions. This is further supported by a match between the\ninstanton action and that of wrapped black branes in a higher-dimensional UV\ncompletion.\n", "  A transient and high sensitivity sensor based on high-Q microcavity is\nproposed and studied theoretically. There are two ways to realize the transient\nsensor: monitor the spectrum by fast scanning of probe laser frequency or\nmonitor the transmitted light with fixed laser frequency. For both methods, the\nnon-equilibrium response not only tells the ultrafast environment variance, but\nalso enable higher sensitivity. As examples of application, the transient\nsensor for nanoparticles adhering and passing by the microcavity is studied.\nIt's demonstrated that the transient sensor can sense coupling region, external\nlinear variation together with the speed and the size of a nanoparticle. We\nbelieve that our researches will open a door to the fast dynamic sensing by\nmicrocavity.\n", "  The emergence of complex macroscopic phenomena from a small set of parameters\nand microscopic concepts demonstrates the power and beauty of physical\ntheories. A theory which relates the wealth of data and peculiarities found in\nnuclei to the small number of parameters and symmetries of quantum\nchromodynamics is by that standard of exceptional beauty.\n  Decade-long research on computational physics and on effective field theories\nfacilitate the assessment of the presumption that quark masses and strong and\nelectromagnetic coupling constants suffice to parameterize the nuclear chart.\nBy presenting the current status of that enterprise, this article touches the\nmethodology of predicting nuclei by simulating the constituting quarks and\ngluons and the development of effective field theories as appropriate\nrepresentations of the fundamental theory.\n  While the nuclear spectra and electromagnetic responses analyzed\ncomputationally so far with lattice QCD are in close resemblance to those which\nintrigued experimentalists a century ago, they also test the theoretical\nunderstanding which was unavailable to guide the nuclear pioneers but developed\nsince then. This understanding is shown to be deficient in terms of\ncorrelations amongst nuclear observables and their sensitivity to fundamental\nparameters. By reviewing the transition from one effective field theory to\nanother, from QCD to pionful chiral theories to pionless and eventually to\ncluster theories, we identify some of those deficiencies and conceptual\nproblems awaiting a solution before QCD can be identified as the high-energy\ntheory from which the nuclear landscape emerges.\n", "  In several two-dimensional films that exhibit a magnetic field-tuned\nsuperconductor to insulator transition (SIT), stable metallic phases have been\nobserved. Building on the `dirty boson' description of the SIT, we suggest that\nthe metallic region is analogous to the composite Fermi liquid observed about\nhalf-filled Landau levels of the two-dimensional electron gas. The composite\nfermions here are mobile vortices attached to one flux quantum of an emergent\ngauge field. The composite vortex liquid is a 2D non-Fermi liquid metal, which\nwe argue is stable to weak quenched disorder. We describe several experimental\nconsequences of the emergent composite vortex liquid.\n", "  We study in detail the relationship between strong subadditivity for a\nboundary field theory and energy conditions for its bulk dual in 2+1\ndimensions. We provide a discussion of known facts and new results organized\nfrom the simplest case of a static system with collinear intervals to a time\ndependent one in a generic configuration, with particular focus on the\nholographic geometric description.\n", "  The use of optical clocks/oscillators in future ultra-precise navigation,\ngravitational sensing, coherent arrays, and relativity experiments will require\ntime comparison and synchronization over terrestrial or satellite free-space\nlinks. Here we demonstrate full unambiguous synchronization of two optical\ntimescales across a free-space link. The time deviation between synchronized\ntimescales is below 1 fs over durations from 0.1 s to 6500 s, despite\natmospheric turbulence and kilometer-scale path length variations. Over several\ndays, the time wander is 40 fs peak-to-peak. Our approach relies on the two-way\nreciprocity of a single-spatial-mode optical link, valid to below 225\nattoseconds across a turbulent 4-km path. This femtosecond level of\ntime-frequency transfer should enable optical networks using state-of-the-art\noptical clocks/oscillators.\n", "  Descriptions of heavy-ion collisions at Fermi energies require to take into\naccount in-medium dissipation and phase-space fluctuations. The interplay of\nthese correlations with the one-body collective behaviour determines the\nproperties (kinematics and fragment production) and the variety of mechanisms\n(from fusion to neck formation and multifragmentation) of the exit channel.\nStarting from fundamental concepts tested on nuclear matter, we build up a\nmicroscopic description which addresses finite systems and applies to\nexperimental observables.\n", "  We present a model for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast$ helicity amplitudes,\nwhere $N$ is the nucleon and $N^\\ast$ is a negative parity nucleon excitation,\nmember of the $SU(6)$-multiplet $[70,1^-]$. The model combines the results from\nthe single quark transition model for the helicity amplitudes with the results\nof the covariant spectator quark model for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast(1535)$\nand $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast(1520)$ transitions. With the knowledge of the\namplitudes $A_{1/2}$ and $A_{3/2}$ for those transitions we calculate three\nindependent coefficients defined by the single quark transition model and make\npredictions for the helicity amplitudes associated with the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to\nN^\\ast(1650)$, $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast(1700)$, $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to\n\\Delta(1620)$, and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1700)$ transitions. In order to\nfacilitate the comparison with future experimental data at high $Q^2$, we\nprovide also simple parametrizations for the amplitudes, compatible with the\nexpected falloff at high $Q^2$.\n", "  A new method to generate and control the amplitude and phase distributions of\na optical vortex beam is proposed. By introducing a holographic grating on top\nof the dielectric waveguide, the free space vortex beam and the in-plane\nguiding wave can be converted to each other. This microscale holographic\ngrating is very robust against the variation of geometry parameters. The\ndesigned vortex beam generator can produce the target beam with a fidelity up\nto 0.93, and the working bandwidth is about 175 nm with the fidelity larger\nthan 0.80. In addition, a multiple generator composed of two holographic\ngratings on two parallel waveguides are studied, which can perform an effective\nand flexible modulation on the vortex beam by controlling the phase of the\ninput light. Our work opens a new avenue towards the integrated OAM devices\nwith multiple degrees of optical freedom, which can be used for optical\ntweezers, micronano imaging, information processing, and so on.\n", "  Topological phases with insulating bulk and gapless surface or edge modes\nhave attracted much attention because of their fundamental physics implications\nand potential applications in dissipationless electronics and spintronics. In\nthis review, we mainly focus on the recent progress in the engineering of\ntopologically nontrivial phases (such as $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators,\nquantum anomalous Hall effects, quantum valley Hall effects \\textit{etc.}) in\ntwo-dimensional material systems, including quantum wells, atomic crystal\nlayers of elements from group III to group VII, and the transition metal\ncompounds.\n", "  In the domain of Nuclear reactions at intermediate energies, the QCD coupling\nconstant $\\alpha_s$ is large enough ($\\sim$ 0.3 - 0.5) to render the\nperturbative calculational techniques inapplicable. In this regime the quarks\nare confined into colorless hadrons and it is expected that effective field\ntheories of hadron interactions via exchange of hadrons, provide useful tools\nto describe such reactions. In this contribution we discuss applications of one\nsuch theory, the effective Lagrangian model, in describing the hadronic\nreactions at intermediate energies whose measurements are the focus of a vast\ninternational experimental program.\n", "  The two-dimensional electron gas at the crystalline LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$\n(c-LAO/STO) interface has sparked large interest due to its exotic properties\nincluding an intriguing gate-tunable superconducting phase. While there is\ngrowing evidence of pronounced spatial inhomogeneity in the conductivity at\nSTO-based interfaces, the consequences for superconductivity remain largely\nunknown. We study interfaces based on amorphous LAO top layers grown at room\ntemperature (a-LAO/STO) and demonstrate a superconducting phase similar to\nc-LAO/STO, however, with a gate-tunable critical temperature of $460 \\,\n\\mathrm{mK}$, higher than any previously reported values for c-LAO/STO. The\ndependence of the superconducting critical current on temperature, magnetic\nfield and backgate-controlled doping is found to be consistently described by a\nmodel of a random array of Josephson-coupled superconducting domains.\n", "  Imperfections in experimental measurement schemes can lead to falsely\nidentifying, or over estimating, entanglement in a quantum system. A recent\nsolution to this is to define schemes that are robust to measurement\nimperfections - measurement device independent entanglement witness (MDI-EW).\nHere we introduce a novel approach for MDI-EW, which significantly reduces the\nexperimental complexity and is applicable to a wide range of physical systems.\nThe scheme requires no prior description of the state, is detection loop-hole\nfree, robust to classical communication, and works for all entangled qubit\nstates. We focus on photonic entanglement, experimentally generating and\ntesting bipartite Werner states, varying the entanglement from the maximally\nentangled Bell state, past the bound for nonlocal states and down to the\nseparable bound of 1/3. We witness entanglement down to an entangled state\nfraction close to 0.4. These results could be of particular interest for device\nindependent quantum random number generation.\n", "  The two component Monte-Carlo Glauber model predicts a knee-like structure in\nthe centrality dependence of elliptic flow $v_2$ in Uranium+Uranium collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV. It also produces a strong anti-correlation between\n$v_2$ and $dN_{ch}/dy$ in the case of top ZDC events. However, none of these\nfeatures have been observed in data. We address these discrepancies by\nincluding the effect of nucleon shadowing to the two component Monte-Carlo\nGlauber model. Apart from addressing successfully the above issues, we find\nthat the nucleon shadow suppresses the event by event fluctuation of various\nquantities, e.g. $\\varepsilon_2$ which is in accordance with expectation from\nthe dynamical models of initial condition based on gluon saturation physics.\n", "  The duality between color and kinematics enables the construction of\nmultiloop gravity integrands directly from corresponding gauge-theory\nintegrands. This has led to new nontrivial insights into the structure of\ngravity theories, including the discovery of enhanced ultraviolet\ncancellations. To continue to gain deeper understandings and probe these new\nproperties, it is crucial to further improve techniques for constructing\nmultiloop gravity integrands. In this paper, we show by example how one can\nalleviate difficulties encountered at the multiloop level by relaxing the\ncolor-kinematics duality conditions to hold manifestly only on unitarity cuts\ninstead of globally on loop integrands. As an example, we use a minimal ansatz\nto construct an integrand for the two-loop four-point nonsupersymmetric pure\nYang-Mills amplitude in $D$ dimensions that is compatible with these relaxed\ncolor-kinematics duality constraints. We then immediately obtain a\ncorresponding gravity integrand through the double-copy procedure. Comments on\nultraviolet divergences are also included.\n", "  We investigate through non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations the\nstructure and flow of fluids in functionalized nanopores. The nanopores are\nmodeled as cylindrical structures with solvophilic and solvophobic sites. Two\nfluids are modeled. The first is a standard Lennard Jones fluid. The second one\nis modeled with a isotropic two-length scale potential, which exhibits in bulk\nwater-like anomalies. Our results indicates distinct dependence of the overall\nmass flux for each species of fluid with the number of solvophilic sites for\ndifferent nanotubes radii. Also, the density and fluid structure are dependent\nfrom the nanotube radius and the solvophilic properties of the nanotube. This\nindicates that the presence of a second length scale in the fluid-fluid\ninteraction will lead to distinct behavior. Also, our results shows that\nchemically functionalized nanotubes with different radius will have distinct\nnano-fluidic features. Our results are explained in the basis of the\ncharacteristic scale fluid properties and the effects of nanoconfinement.\n", "  We study three-body recombination of Ba$^+$ + Rb + Rb in the mK regime where\na single $^{138}$Ba$^{+}$ ion in a Paul trap is immersed into a cloud of\nultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms. We measure the energy dependence of the three-body\nrate coefficient $k_3$ and compare the results to the theoretical prediction,\n$k_3 \\propto E_{\\textrm{col}}^{-3/4}$ where $E_{\\textrm{col}}$ is the collision\nenergy. We find agreement if we assume that the non-thermal ion energy\ndistribution is determined by at least two different micro-motion induced\nenergy scales. Furthermore, using classical trajectory calculations we predict\nhow the median binding energy of the formed molecules scales with the collision\nenergy. Our studies give new insights into the kinetics of an ion immersed into\nan ultracold atom cloud and yield important prospects for atom-ion experiments\ntargeting the s-wave regime.\n", "  The structural, electronic and optical properties of nearly ferromagnetic\ncompound HfZn2 have been studied using ab-initio technique. We have carried out\nthe plane-wave pseudopotential approach within the framework of the\nfirst-principles density functional theory (DFT) implemented within the CASTEP\ncode. The calculated structural parameters show a good agreement with the\nexperimental results. In our work we have used GGA-PBE to calculate the\nelectronic properties and it is found that the results exhibit similar band\nstructure qualitatively with the results calculated using LDA. The electronic\nband structure reveals metallic conductivity and the major contribution comes\nfrom Hf-5d states. Our results for structural and electronic properties are\ncompared with the experimental and other theoretical results wherever these are\navailable.\n", "  Doubly-excited Rydberg states of helium (He) nanodroplets have been studied\nusing synchrotron radiation. We observed Fano resonances related to the atomic\nN = 2,0 series as a function of droplet size. Although similar qualitatively to\ntheir atomic counterparts, the resonance lines are broader and exhibit a shift\nin energy which increases for the higher excited states. Furthermore,\nadditional resonances are observed which are not seen in atomic systems. We\ndiscuss these features in terms of delocalized atomic states perturbed by the\nsurrounding He atoms and compare to singly excited droplets.\n", "  We use dynamic coherent backscattering to study one of the Anderson mobility\ngaps in the vibrational spectrum of strongly disordered three-dimensional\nmesoglasses. Comparison of experimental results with the self-consistent theory\nof localization allows us to estimate the localization (correlation) length as\na function of frequency in a wide spectral range covering bands of diffuse\ntransport and a mobility gap delimited by two mobility edges. The results are\ncorroborated by transmission measurements on one of our samples.\n", "  Contact-based vibrations play a critical role in the dynamics of granular\nmaterials. Significant insights into vibrational granular dynamics have been\nobtained with reduced-dimensional systems containing macroscale particles. We\nstudy contact-based vibrations of a two-dimensional monolayer of micron-sized\nspheres on a solid substrate. Measurements of the resonant attenuation of\nlaser-generated surface acoustic waves reveal three collective vibrational\nmodes involving both displacements and rotations of the microspheres. To\nidentify the modes, we tune the interparticle stiffness, which shifts the\nfrequency of the horizontal-rotational resonances while leaving the vertical\nresonance unaffected. From the measured contact resonance frequencies we\ndetermine both particle-substrate and interparticle contact stiffnesses and\nfind that the former is an order of magnitude larger than the latter. This\nstudy paves the way for investigating complex contact-based dynamics of\nmicrogranular media, demonstrates a novel acoustic metamaterial, and yields a\nnew approach to studying micro- to nanoscale contact mechanics in multiparticle\nnetworks.\n", "  We study the hydrodynamic response to jet quenching in expanding quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP) and its signal in the resulting particle distribution. The ideal\nhydrodynamic simulations of the $\\gamma$-jet events in heavy-ion collisions are\nperformed in a full (3 + 1)-dimensional setup. The jet-induced Mach cone and\nthe radial expansion of the background mutually push and distort each other. As\na result, the particle emission is suppressed in the direction in which the\nradial flow is pushed back by the Mach cone when the jet path is an off-central\none. This is the direct signal of hydrodynamic response to the jetand,\nmoreover, includes information about the jet path in the expanding QGP fluid.\n", "  We present a framework for describing the evolution of stochastic observables\nhaving a non-stationary distribution of values. The framework is applied to\nempirical volume-prices from assets traded at the New York stock exchange.\nUsing Kullback-Leibler divergence we evaluate the best model out from four\nbiparametric models standardly used in the context of financial data analysis.\nIn our present data sets we conclude that the inverse $\\Gamma$-distribution is\na good model, particularly for the distribution tail of the largest\nvolume-price fluctuations. Extracting the time-series of the corresponding\nparameter values we show that they evolve in time as stochastic variables\nthemselves. For the particular case of the parameter controlling the\nvolume-price distribution tail we are able to extract an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nequation which describes the fluctuations of the largest volume-prices observed\nin the data. Finally, we discuss how to bridge from the stochastic evolution of\nthe distribution parameters to the stochastic evolution of the (non-stationary)\nobservable and put our conclusions into perspective for other applications in\ngeophysics and biology.\n", "  $J/\\psi$ suppression with rapidity is studied with both (3+1) dimensional\ntransport equation and hydrodynamics in details at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV\nPb+Pb collisions. In central rapidity region of the hot medium, $J/\\psi$\nnuclear modification factor shows weak rapidity dependence due to the boost\ninvariance of the medium. But in forward rapidity region for entire transverse\nmomentum bin, $J/\\psi$ regeneration is strongly suppressed due to the\ndecreasing charm pair cross section. This makes $J/\\psi$ $R_{AA}(y)$ decrease\nwith rapidity. The ratio $r_{AA}$ of mean transverse momentum square in AA\ncollisions to that in pp collisions increases strongly in forward rapidity\nregion and is more sensitive to the $J/\\psi$ production mechanisms.\n", "  We explore various aspects of the self-dual Pleba\\'nski-Demia\\'nski family in\nthe Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell-$\\Lambda$ system. The Killing-Yano tensor which\nwas recently found by Yasui and one of the present authors allows us to prove\nthat the self-dual Pleba\\'nski-Demia\\'nski metric can be brought into the\nself-dual Carter metric by an orientation-reversing coordinate transformation.\nWe show that the self-dual Pleba\\'nski-Demia\\'nski solution admits two\nindependent Killing spinors in the framework of $N=2$ minimal gauged\nsupergravity, whereas the non-self-dual solution admits only a single Killing\nspinor. This can be demonstrated by casting the self-dual\nPleba\\'nski-Demia\\'nski metric into two distinct Przanowski-Tod forms. As a\nby-product, a new example of the three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl space is\npresented. We also prove that the self-dual Pleba\\'nski-Demia\\'nski metric\nfalls into two different Calderbank-Pedersen families, which are determined by\na single function subjected to a linear equation on the two dimensional\nhyperbolic space. Furthermore, we consider the hyper-K\\\"ahler case for which\nthe metric falls into the Gibbons-Hawking class. We find that the condition for\nthe nonexistence of Dirac-Misner string enforces the solution with a\nnonvanishing acceleration parameter to the Eguchi-Hanson space.\n", "  The recent study of $^{77}$Se nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in a\n$\\beta$-FeSe single crystal proposed that ferro-orbital order breaks the\n$90^\\circ$ $C_4$ rotational symmetry, driving nematic ordering. Here, we report\nan NMR study of the impact of small strains generated by gluing on nematic\nstate and spin fluctuations. We observe that the local strains strongly affect\nthe nematic transition, considerably enhancing its onset temperature. On the\ncontrary, no effect on low-energy spin fluctuations was found. Furthermore we\ninvestigate the interplay of the nematic phase and superconductivity. Our study\ndemonstrates that the twinned nematic domains respond unequivalently to\nsuperconductivity, evidencing the twofold $C_2$ symmetry of superconductivity\nin this material. The obtained results are well understood in terms of the\nproposed ferro-orbital order.\n", "  With the elements of the Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR)\nnoncommutative formalism, we have constructed the standard electroweak model.\nTo accomplish this task we have begun with the WM-product basis group of\nsymmetry. We have introduced the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the\nhypercharge in DFR framework. The electroweak symmetry breaking was analyzed\nand the masses of the new bosons were computed.\n", "  We consider recurrence to the initial state after repeated actions of a\nquantum channel. After each iteration a projective measurement is applied to\ncheck recurrence. The corresponding return time is known to be an integer for\nthe special case of unital channels, including unitary channels. We prove that\nfor a more general class of quantum channels the expected return time can be\ngiven as the inverse of the weight of the initial state in the steady state.\nThis statement is a generalization of the Kac lemma for classical Markov\nchains.\n", "  The transport properties of disordered systems are known to depend critically\non dimensionality. We study the diffusion coefficient of a quantum particle\nconfined to a lattice on the surface of a tube, where it scales between the 1D\nand 2D limits. It is found that the scaling relation is universal and\nindependent of the disorder and noise parameters, and the essential order\nparameter is the ratio between the localization length in 2D and the\ncircumference of the tube. Phenomenological and quantitative expressions for\ntransport properties as functions of disorder and noise are obtained and\napplied to real systems: In the natural chlorosomes found in light-harvesting\nbacteria the exciton transfer dynamics is predicted to be in the 2D limit,\nwhereas a family of synthetic molecular aggregates is found to be in the\nhomogeneous limit and is independent of dimensionality.\n", "  The anyonic excitations of a spin-liquid can feature fractional quantum\nnumbers under space-group symmetries. Detecting these fractional quantum\nnumbers, which are analogs of the fractional charge of Laughlin quasiparticles,\nmay prove easier than the direct observation of anyonic braiding and\nstatistics. Motivated by the recent numerical discovery of spin-liquid phases\nin the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we theoretically predict the pattern\nof space group symmetry fractionalization in the kagome lattice chiral spin\nliquid. We provide a method to detect these fractional quantum numbers in\nfinite-size numerics which is simple to implement in DMRG. Applying these\ndevelopments to the chiral spin liquid phase of a kagome Heisenberg model, we\nfind perfect agreement between our theoretical prediction and numerical\nobservations.\n", "  We consider Grand Unified Theories in which the hierarchy between the\nunification and the Fermi scale emerges radiatively. Within the Pati-Salam\nframework, we show that it is possible to construct a viable model where the\nHiggs is an elementary pseudo-Goldstone boson, and the correct hierarchy is\ngenerated.\n", "  General cylindrical waves are the simplest axisymmetrical gravitational waves\nthat contain both $+$ and $\\times$ modes of polarization. In this paper, we\nhave studied the evolution of general cylindrical gravitational waves in the\nrealm of the characteristic scheme with a numerical code based on the\nGalerkin-Collocation method. The investigation consists of the numerical\nrealization of concepts such as Bondi mass and the news functions adapted to\ncylindrical symmetry. The Bondi mass decays due to the presence of the news\nfunctions associated with both polarization modes. We have interpreted that\neach polarization mode as channels from which mass is extracted. Under this\nperspective, we have presented the enhancement effect of the polarization mode\n$+$ due to the nonlinear interaction with the mode $\\times$. After discussing\nthe role of matter in cylindrical symmetry, we have extended the numerical code\nto include electromagnetic fields.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of successful magnetogenesis during inflation by\nemploying the one-loop effective action of massless QED. The action is strictly\nnon-local and results from the long distance fluctuations of massless charged\nparticles present at the inflationary scale. Most importantly, it encodes the\nconformal anomaly of QED which is crucial to avoid the vacuum preservation in\nclassical electromagnetism. In particular, we find a blue spectrum for the\nmagnetic field with spectral index $n_B \\simeq 2 - \\alpha_{\\text{e}}$ where\n$\\alpha_{\\text{e}}$ depends on both the number of e-folds during inflation as\nwell as the coefficient of the one-loop beta function. In particular, the sign\nof the beta function has important bearing on the final result. A low reheating\ntemperature is required for the present day magnetic field to be consistent\nwith the lower bound inferred on the field in the intergalactic medium.\n", "  We analytically evaluate the expectation value of a baryonic Wilson loop in a\nholographic model of an SU(3) pure gauge theory. We then discuss three aspects\nof a static three-quark potential: an aspect of universality which concerns\nproperties independent of a geometric configuration of quarks; a heavy diquark\nstructure; and a relation between the three and two-quark potentials.\n", "  We emphasize that scattering amplitudes of a wide class of models to any\norder in the coupling are constructible by on-shell tree subamplitudes. This\nfollows from the Feynman-tree theorem combined with BCFW on-shell recursion\nrelations. In contrast to the usual Feynman diagrams, no virtual particles\nappear.\n", "  This paper addresses a long standing problem, the counting of the microstates\nof supersymmetric asymptotically AdS black holes in terms of a holographically\ndual field theory. We focus on a class of asymptotically AdS$_4$ static black\nholes preserving two real supercharges which are dual to a topologically\ntwisted deformation of the ABJM theory. We evaluate in the large $N$ limit the\ntopologically twisted index of the ABJM theory and we show that it correctly\nreproduces the entropy of the AdS$_4$ black holes. An extremization of the\nindex with respect to a set of chemical potentials is required. We interpret it\nas the selection of the exact R-symmetry of the superconformal quantum\nmechanics describing the horizon of the black hole.\n", "  We study the Inert Higgs Doublet Model and its inert scalar Higgs $H$ as the\nonly source for dark matter. It is found that three mass regions of the inert\nscalar Higgs can give the correct dark matter relic density. The low mass\nregion (between 3 and 50 GeV) is ruled out. New direct dark matter detection\nexperiments will probe the intermediate (between 60 and 100 GeV) and high\n(heavier than 550 GeV) mass regions. Collider experiments are advised to search\nfor $D^\\pm \\to HW^\\pm$ decay in the two jets plus missing energy channel.\n", "  In this work, we present limits on natural supersymmetry scenarios based on\nsearches in data taken during run 1 of the LHC. We consider a set of 22000\nmodel points in a six dimensional parameter space. These scenarios are minimal\nin the sense of only keeping those superparticles relatively light that are\nrequired to cancel the leading quadratically divergent quantum corrections\n(from the top and QCD sector) to the Higgs mass in the Standard Model. The\nresulting mass spectra feature higgsinos as the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, as well as relatively light third generation $SU(2)$ doublet squarks\nand $SU(2)$ singlet stops and gluinos while assuming a Standard Model like\nHiggs boson. All remaining supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons are\nassumed to be decoupled. We check each parameter set against a large number of\nLHC searches as implemented in the public code {\\tt CheckMATE}. These searches\nshow a considerable degree of complementarity, i.e. in general many searches\nhave to be considered in order to check whether a given scenario is allowed. We\ndelineate allowed and excluded regions in parameter space. For example, we find\nthat all scenarios where either $m_{\\tilde t_1} < 230$ GeV or $m_{\\tilde g} <\n440$ GeV are clearly excluded, while all model points where $m_{\\tilde t_1} >\n660$ GeV and $m_{\\tilde g} > 1180$ GeV remain allowed.\n", "  Various Fe-vacancy orders have been reported in tetragonal Fe1-xSe single\ncrystals and nanowires/nanosheets, which are similar to those found in alkali\nmetal intercalated A1-xFe2-ySe2 superconductors. Here we report the in-situ\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Fe-vacancy disordered and\nordered phases in FeSe multi-layer thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy.\nLow temperature annealed FeSe films are identified to be Fe-vacancy disordered\nphase and electron doped. Further long-time low temperature anneal can change\nthe Fe-vacancy disordered phase to ordered phase, which is found to be\nsemiconductor/insulator with (root 5) x (root 5) superstructure and can be\nreversely changed to disordered phase with high temperature anneal. Our results\nreveal that the disorder-order transition in FeSe thin films can be simply\ntuned by vacuum anneal and the (root 5) x (root 5) Fe-vacancy ordered phase is\nmore likely the parent phase of FeSe.\n", "  Electronic states with non-trivial topology host a number of novel phenomena\nwith potential for revolutionizing information technology. The quantum\nanomalous Hall effect provides spin-polarized dissipation-free transport of\nelectrons, while the quantum spin Hall effect in combination with\nsuperconductivity has been proposed as the basis for realizing decoherence-free\nquantum computing. We introduce a new strategy for realizing these effects,\nnamely by hole and electron doping kagome lattice Mott insulators through, for\ninstance, chemical substitution. As an example, we apply this new approach to\nthe natural mineral herbertsmithite. We prove the feasibility of the proposed\nmodifications by performing ab-initio density functional theory calculations\nand demonstrate the occurrence of the predicted effects using realistic models.\nOur results herald a new family of quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall\ninsulators at affordable energy/temperature scales based on kagome lattices of\ntransition metal ions.\n", "  We detail the construction of a weak Poisson bracket over a submanifold of a\nsmooth manifold M with respect to a local foliation of this submanifold. Such a\nbracket satisfies a weak type Jacobi identity but may be viewed as a usual\nPoisson bracket on the space of leaves of the foliation. We then lift this weak\nPoisson bracket to a weak odd Poisson bracket on the odd tangent bundle,\ninterpreted as a weak Koszul bracket on differential forms on M. This lift is\nachieved by encoding the weak Poisson structure into a homotopy Poisson\nstructure on an extended manifold, and lifting the Hamiltonian function that\ngenerates this structure. Such a construction has direct physical\ninterpretation. For a generic gauge system, the submanifold may be viewed as a\nstationary surface or a constraint surface, with the foliation given by the\nfoliation of the gauge orbits. Through this interpretation, the lift of the\nweak Poisson structure is simply a lift of the action generating the\ncorresponding BRST operator of the system.\n", "  Recently it was argued that the conformal coupling of the chameleon to matter\nfields created an issue for early universe cosmology. As standard model degrees\nof freedom become non-relativistic in the early universe the chameleon is\nattracted towards a \"surfing\" solution, so that it arrives at the potential\nminimum with too large a velocity. This leads to rapid variations in the\nchameleon's mass and excitation of high energy modes, casting doubts on the\nclassical treatment at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Here we present the DBI\nchameleon, a consistent high energy modification of the chameleon theory that\ndynamically renders it weakly coupled to matter during the early universe\nthereby eliminating the adverse effects of the `kicks'. This is done without\nany fine tuning of the coupling between the chameleon and matter fields and\nretains its screening ability in the solar system. We demonstrate this\nexplicitly with a combination of analytic and numerical results.\n", "  The infall of cold dark matter onto a galaxy produces cold collisionless\nflows and caustics in its halo. If a signal is found in the cavity detector of\ndark matter axions, the flows will be readily apparent as peaks in the energy\nspectrum of photons from axion conversion, allowing the densities, velocity\nvectors and velocity dispersions of the flows to be determined. We discuss the\nevolution of velocity dispersion along cold collisionless flows in one and two\ndimensions. A technique is presented for obtaining the leading behaviour of the\nvelocity dispersion near caustics. The results are used to derive an upper\nlimit on the energy dispersion of the Big Flow from the sharpness of its nearby\ncaustic, and a prediction for the dispersions in its velocity components.\n", "  Experimental results of the rapidity distributions of negatively charged\npions produced in proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and beryllium-beryllium (Be-Be)\ncollisions at different beam momentums, measured by the NA61/SHINE\nCollaboration at the super proton synchrotron (SPS), are described by a revised\n(three-source) Landau hydrodynamic model. The squared speed-of-sound parameter\n$c^2_s$ is then extracted from the width of rapidity distribution. There is a\nlocal minimum (knee point) which indicates a softest point in the equation of\nstate (EoS) appearing at about 40$A$ GeV/$c$ (or 8.8 GeV) in $c^2_s$ excitation\nfunction [the dependence of $c^2_s$ on incident beam momentum (or\ncenter-of-mass energy)]. This knee point should be related to the searching for\nthe onset of quark deconfinement and the critical point of quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) phase transition.\n", "  The elemental two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, silicene,\ngermanene, and black phosphorus have attracted considerable attention due to\ntheir fascinating physical properties. Structurally they possess the honeycomb\nor distorted honeycomb lattices, which are composed of six-atom rings. Here we\nfind a new structure of 2D allotropes of group V elements composed of\neight-atom rings, which we name as the octagonal tiling (OT) structure.\nFirst-principles calculations indicate that these allotropes are dynamically\nstable and are also thermally stable at temperatures up to 600 K. These\nallotropes are semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 eV, thus\nthey are potentially useful in near- and mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.\nOT-Bi is also a 2D topological insulator (TI) with a band gap of 0.33 eV, which\nis the largest among the reported elemental 2D TIs, and this gap can be\nincreased further by applying compressive strains.\n", "  We investigate the significance of nonisochronicity parameter in a network of\nnonlocally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators with symmetry breaking form. We\nobserve that the presence of nonisochronicity parameter leads to structural\nchanges in the chimera death region while varying the strength of the\ninteraction. This gives rise to the existence of different types of chimera\ndeath states such as multi-chimera death state, type-I periodic chimera death\n(PCD) state and, type-II periodic chimera death (PCD) state. We also find that\nthe number of periodic domains in both the types of PCD states exponentially\ndecreases with an increase of coupling range and obeys a power law under\nnonlocal coupling. Additionally, we also analyze the structural changes of\nchimera death states by reducing the system of dynamical equations to a phase\nmodel through the phase approximation. We also briefly study the role of\nnonisochronicity parameter on chimera states, where the existence of\nmulti-chimera state with respect to the coupling range is pointed out.\nMoreover, we also analyze the robustness of the chimera death state to\nperturbations in the natural frequencies of the oscillators.\n", "  In the physics of solar flares, it is crucial to diagnose the physical\nconditions near the flare energy-release sites. However, so far it is unclear\nhow do diagnose these physical conditions. Solar microwave type III burst is\nbelieved to be a sensitive signature of the primary energy release and electron\naccelerations in solar flares. This work takes into account the effect of\nmagnetic field on the plasma density and developed s set of formulas which can\nbe used to estimate the plasma density, temperature, magnetic field near the\nmagnetic reconnection site and particle acceleration region, and the velocity\nand energy of electron beams. We applied these formulas to three groups of\nmicrowave type III pairs in a X-class flare, and obtained some reasonable and\ninteresting results. This method can be applied to other microwave type III\nbursts to diagnose the physical conditions of source regions, and provide some\nbasic information to understand the intrinsic nature and fundamental processes\noccurring near the flare energy-release sites.\n", "  Phase I of hydrogen has several peculiarities. Despite having a close-packed\ncrystal structure, it is less dense than either the low temperature Phase II or\nthe liquid phase. At high pressure, it transforms into either phase III or IV,\ndepending on the temperature. Moreover, spectroscopy suggests that the quantum\nrotor behaviour disappears with pressurisation, without any apparent phase\ntransition. Here we present a simple thermodynamic model for this behaviour\nbased on packing atoms and molecules and discuss the thermodynamics of the\nphase boundaries. We also report first principles molecular dynamics\ncalculations for a more detailed look at the same phase transitions.\n", "  By applying the unified first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon\nof FRW universe, we get the entropy relation for the apparent horizon in\nquasi-topological gravity theory. Throughout the paper, the results of\nconsidering the Hayward-Kodama and Cai-Kim temperatures are also addressed. Our\nstudy shows that whenever, there is no energy exchange between the various\nparts of cosmos, we can get an expression for the apparent horizon entropy in\nquasi-topological gravity, which is in agreement with other attempts followed\ndifferent approaches. The effects of a mutual interaction between the various\nparts of cosmos on the apparent horizon entropy as well as the validity of\nsecond law of thermodynamics in quasi-topological gravity are also perused.\n", "  We demonstrate coupling of light resonant to transition between two excited\nstates of rubidium and long-lived ground-state atomic coherence. In our\nproof-of-principle experiment a non-linear process of four-wave mixing is used\nto achieve light emission proportional to independently prepared ground-state\natomic coherence. Strong correlations between stimulated Raman scattering light\nheralding generation of ground-state coherence and the four-wave mixing signal\nare measured and shown to survive the storage period, which is promising in\nterms of quantum memory applications. The process is characterized as a\nfunction of laser detunings.\n", "  Context. Chamaeleon II molecular cloud is an active star forming region that\noffers an excellent opportunity for studying the formation of brown dwarfs in\nthe southern hemisphere. Aims. Our aims are to identify a population of pre-\nand proto- brown dwarfs (5 sigma mass limit threshold of ~0.015 Msun) and\nprovide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. Methods.\nWe performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the LABOCA\nbolometer at the APEX telescope towards an active star forming region in\nChamaeleon II. The data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelength\ncatalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the nature\nof the LABOCA detections. Results. We detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, and\neleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. The most intense objects\nin the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the well\nknown young stellar objects DK Cha and IRAS 12500-7658. We identify a possible\nproto-brown dwarf candidate (ChaII-APEX-L) with IRAC emission at 3.6 and 4.5\nmicrons. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that most of the spatially\nresolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in the\nsub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 Msun and 0.066 Msun) could be\npre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than\n220 AU to 907 AU (1.2\" to 5\" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses. ALMA\nobservations will be the key to reveal the energetic state of these pre-brown\ndwarfs candidates.\n", "  Both WMAP and Planck data show a significant odd-multipole preference in the\nlarge scales of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies.\nIf this pattern originates from cosmological effects, then it can be considered\na crucial clue for a violation in the cosmological principle. By defining\nvarious direction dependent statistics in the full-sky Planck 2015 maps (see,\nfor instance, Naselsky et al. (2012); W. Zhao (2014)), we found that the CMB\nparity asymmetry has a preferred direction, which is independent of the choices\nof the statistics. In particular, this preferred axis is strongly aligned with\nthose in the CMB quadrupole and octopole, as well as that in the CMB kinematic\ndipole, which hints to their non-cosmological origin. In realistic\nobservations, the foreground residuals are inevitable, and should be properly\nmasked out in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the results. In this\npaper, we extend our previous analyses to the masked Planck 2015 data. By\ndefining a similar direction dependent statistic in the masked map, we find a\npreferred direction of the CMB parity asymmetry, in which the axis also\ncoincides with that found in the full-sky analysis. Therefore, our conclusions\non the CMB parity violation and its directional properties are confirmed.\n", "  We study individual-based dynamics in finite populations, subject to randomly\nswitching environmental conditions. These are inspired by models in which genes\ntransition between on and off states, regulating underlying protein dynamics.\nSimilarly switches between environmental states are relevant in bacterial\npopulations and in models of epidemic spread. Existing piecewise-deterministic\nMarkov process (PDMP) approaches focus on the deterministic limit of the\npopulation dynamics while retaining the randomness of the switching. Here we go\nbeyond this approximation and explicitly include effects of intrinsic\nstochasticity at the level of the linear-noise approximation. Specifically we\nderive the stationary distributions of a number of model systems, in good\nagreement with simulations. This improves existing approaches which are limited\nto the regimes of fast and slow switching.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum of the\nparadigmatic Bose-Hubbard model, describing strongly correlated bosons on a\nlattice. The use of a controlled approximation - the slave-boson approach -\nallows us to study entanglement in all regimes of the model (and, most\nimportantly, across its superfluid/Mott-insulator transition) at a minimal\ncost. We find that the area-law scaling of entanglement -- verified in all the\nphases -- exhibits a sharp singularity at the transition. The singularity is\ngreatly enhanced when the transition is crossed at fixed, integer filling, due\nto a richer entanglement spectrum containing an additional gapless mode, which\ndescends from the amplitude (Higgs) mode of the global excitation spectrum --\nwhile this mode remains gapped at the generic (commensurate-incommensurate)\ntransition with variable filling. Hence the entanglement properties contain a\nunique signature of the two different forms of bosonic criticality exhibited by\nthe Bose-Hubbard model.\n", "  In string theory, higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields appear as massless\nexcitations of closed strings. Till date there is no experimental support in\nfavour of their existence. In a stringy framework, starting from a warped\nthroat-like Klebanov-Strassler geometry, we show that all the massless higher\nrank antisymmetric tensor fields are heavily suppressed due to the background\nfluxes leading to their invisibility in our Universe.\n", "  We study theoretically how multiple scattering of light in a disordered\nmedium can spontaneously generate quantum correlations. In particular we focus\non the case where the input state is Gaussian and characterize the correlations\nbetween two arbitrary output modes. As there is not a single all-inclusive\nmeasure of correlation, we characterise the output correlations with three\nmeasures: intensity fluctuations, entanglement, and quantum discord. We found\nthat, while a single mode coherent state input can not produce quantum\ncorrelations, any other Gaussian input will produce them in one form or\nanother. This includes input states that are usually regarded as more classical\nthan coherent ones, such as thermal states, which will produce a non zero\nquantum discord.\n", "  We study the bosonic structure of $F$-term Nambu-Goto cosmic strings forming\nin a realistic SO(10) implementation, assuming standard hybrid inflation. We\ndescribe the supersymmetric grand unified theory, and its spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking scheme in parallel with the inflationary process. We also write the\nexplicit tensor formulation of its scalar sector, focusing on the\nsub-representations singlet under the standard model, which is sufficient to\ndescribe the string structure. We then introduce an ansatz for abelian cosmic\nstrings, discussing in details the hypothesis, and write down the field\nequations and boundary conditions. Finally, after doing a perturbative study of\nthe model, we present and discuss the results obtained with numerical solutions\nof the string structure.\n", "  We study the emergence of charge ordered phases within a pi-loop current\n(piLC) model for the pseudogap based on a three-band model for underdoped\ncuprate superconductors. Loop currents and charge ordering are driven by\ndistinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents\nresult from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,\nwhile charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.\nWe find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to\npreviously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at\nhole dopings p below the van Hove filling. Subsequent charge ordering\ntendencies in the piLC phase reveal that diagonal d-charge density waves (dCDW)\nare suppressed by the loop currents while axial order competes more weakly. In\nsome cases we find a wide temperature range below the loop-current transition,\nover which the susceptibility towards an axial dCDW is large. In these cases,\nshort-range axial charge order may be induced by doping-related disorder. A\nunique feature of the coexisting dCDW and piLC phases is the emergence of an\nincommensurate modulation of the loop currents. If the dCDW is biaxial\n(checkerboard) then the resulting incommensurate current pattern breaks all\nmirror and time-reversal symmetries, thereby allowing for a polar Kerr effect.\n", "  This paper shares my journey (tools used, design principles derived and\nmodeling pedagogy implemented) when creating electronic books-chapters (epub3\nformat) for computers and tablets using Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations, (old\nname EJS, new EjsS) Modeling Tool. The theory underpinning this work grounded\non learning by doing through dynamic and interactive simulation-models that can\nbe more easily made sense of instead of the static nature of printed materials.\nI started combining related computer models with supporting texts and\nillustrations into a coherent chapter, a logical next step towards tighter\nsupport for teachers and students ,developing prototypes electronic chapters on\nthe topics of Simple Harmonic Motion and Gravity customized for the\nSingapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-level).\nI aim to inspire more educators to create interactive and open educational\nresources for the benefit of all.

The quasimonochromatic $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ beam,\nproduced with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV at J-PARC, is observed at the far\ndetector Super-Kamiokande, 295 km away, where the $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ survival\nprobability is expected to be minimal. Using a dataset corresponding to $4.01\n\\times 10^{20}$ protons on target, $34$ fully contained $\\mu$-like events were\nobserved. The best-fit oscillation parameters are $\\sin^2 (\\bar{\\theta}_{23}) =\n0.45$ and $|\\Delta\\bar{m}^2_{32}| = 2.51 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ with 68%\nconfidence intervals of 0.38 - 0.64 and 2.26 - 2.80 $\\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$\nrespectively. These results are in agreement with existing antineutrino\nparameter measurements and also with the $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance parameters\nmeasured by T2K.\n", "  The accuracy at which total energies of open-shell atoms and organic radicals\nmay be calculated is assessed for selected coupled cluster perturbative triples\nexpansions, all of which augment the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)\nenergy by a non-iterative correction for the effect of triple excitations.\nNamely, the second- through sixth-order models of the recently proposed\nCCSD(T-n) triples series [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)] are compared to\nthe acclaimed CCSD(T) model for both unrestricted as well as restricted\nopen-shell Hartree-Fock (UHF/ROHF) reference determinants. By comparing UHF-\nand ROHF-based statistical results for a test set of 18 modest-sized open-shell\nspecies with comparable RHF-based results, no behavioral differences are\nobserved for the higher-order models of the CCSD(T-n) series in their\ncorrelated descriptions of closed- and open-shell species. In particular, we\nfind that the convergence rate throughout the series towards the coupled\ncluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) solution is identical for the two\ncases. For the CCSD(T) model, on the other hand, not only its numerical\nconsistency, but also its established, yet fortuitous cancellation of errors\nbreaks down in the transition from closed- to open-shell systems. The\nhigher-order CCSD(T-n) models (orders n>3) thus offer a consistent and\nsignificant improvement in accuracy relative to CCSDT over the CCSD(T) model,\nequally for RHF, UHF, and ROHF reference determinants, albeit at an increased\ncomputational cost.\n", "  We study rare four-body decays of the Z-boson involving at least one neutrino\nand one charged lepton. Large destructive interferences make these decays very\nsensitive to the Z couplings to neutrinos. As the identified charged leptons\ncan determine the neutrino flavors, these decays probe the universality of the\nZ couplings to neutrinos. The rare four-body processes could be accurately\nmeasured at future lepton colliders, leading to percent level precision.\n", "  We report on Fourier spectroscopy experiments performed with near-surface\nnitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond chip. By detecting the free precession of\nnuclear spins rather than applying a multipulse quantum sensing protocol, we\nare able to unambiguously identify the NMR species devoid of harmonics. We\nfurther show that by engineering different Hamiltonians during free precession,\nthe hyperfine coupling parameters as well as the nuclear Larmor frequency can\nbe selectively measured with high precision (here 5 digits). The protocols can\nbe combined to demonstrate two-dimensional Fourier spectroscopy. The technique\nwill be useful for mapping nuclear coordinates in molecules en route to imaging\ntheir atomic structure.\n", "  We present constraints on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP)-nucleus\nscattering from the 2013 data of the Large Underground Xenon dark matter\nexperiment, including $1.4\\times10^{4}\\;\\mathrm{kg\\; day}$ of search exposure.\nThis new analysis incorporates several advances: single-photon calibration at\nthe scintillation wavelength, improved event-reconstruction algorithms, a\nrevised background model including events originating on the detector walls in\nan enlarged fiducial volume, and new calibrations from decays of an injected\ntritium $\\beta$ source and from kinematically constrained nuclear recoils down\nto 1.1 keV. Sensitivity, especially to low-mass WIMPs, is enhanced compared to\nour previous results which modeled the signal only above a 3 keV minimum\nenergy. Under standard dark matter halo assumptions and in the mass range above\n4 $\\mathrm{GeV}\\,c^{-2}$, these new results give the most stringent direct\nlimits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section. The 90% C.L. upper\nlimit has a minimum of 0.6 zb at 33 $\\mathrm{GeV}\\,c^{-2}$ WIMP mass.\n", "  We reconsider the mean-field Potts model with $q$ interacting and $r$\nnon-interacting (invisible) states. The model was recently introduced to\nexplain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental\nobservations of phase transitions in some systems where the $Z_q$-symmetry is\nspontaneously broken. We analyse the marginal dimensions of the model, i.e.,\nthe value of $r$ at which the order of the phase transition changes. In the\n$q=2$ case, we determine that value to be $r_c = 3.65(5)$; there is a\nsecond-order phase transition there when $r<r_c$ and a first-order one at\n$r>r_c$. We also analyse the region $1 \\leq q<2$ and show that the change from\nsecond to first order there is manifest through a new mechanism involving\n{\\emph{two}} marginal values of $r$. The $q=1$ limit gives bond percolation and\nsome intermediary values also have known physical realisations. Above the lower\nvalue $r_{c1}$, the order parameters exhibit discontinuities at temperature\n$\\tilde{t}$ below a critical value $t_c$. But, provided $r>r_{c1}$ is small\nenough, this discontinuity does not appear at the phase transition, which is\ncontinuous and takes place at $t_c$. The larger value $r_{c2}$ marks the point\nat which the phase transition at $t_c$ changes from second to first order.\nThus, for $r_{c1}< r < r_{c2}$, the transition at $t_c$ remains second order\nwhile the order parameter has a discontinuity at $\\tilde{t}$. As $r$ increases\nfurther, $\\tilde{t}$ increases, bringing the discontinuity closer to $t_c$.\nFinally, when $r$ exceeds $r_{c2}$ $\\tilde{t}$ coincides with $t_c$ and the\nphase transition becomes first order. This new mechanism indicates how the\ndiscontinuity characteristic of first order phase transitions emerges.\n", "  This article is devoted to finding classical point-particle equivalents for\nthe fermion sector of the nonminimal Standard-Model Extension (SME). For a\nseries of nonminimal operators, such Lagrangians are derived at first order in\nLorentz violation using the algebraic concept of Gr\\\"obner bases. Subsequently,\nthe Lagrangians serve as a basis for reanalyzing the results of certain\nkinematic tests of Special Relativity that were carried out in the last\ncentury. Thereby, a number of new constraints on coefficients of the nonminimal\nSME is obtained. In the last part of the paper we point out connections to\nFinsler geometry.\n", "  The integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) is usually modeled using\nGalilean-invariant or rotationally-invariant Landau levels. However, these are\nnot generic symmetries of electrons moving in a crystalline background, even in\nthe low-density continuum limit. We present a treatment of the IQHE which\nabandons the Galilean dispersion relation while keeping inversion symmetry. We\ndefine an emergent metric $g^n_{ab}$ for each Landau level with a reformulation\nof the Hall viscosity. The metric is then used to define a guiding-center\ncoherent state and the wavefunctions are holomorphic functions of $z^*$ times a\nGaussian. By numerically studying cases with quartic dispersion, we show that\nthe number of the zeroes of the wavefunction encircled by the semiclassical\norbit, denoted by $n$, defines a \"topological spin\" $s_n$ by\n$s_n=n+\\frac{1}{2}$, with its original definition as an \"intrinsic angular\nmomentum\" no longer valid without rotational symmetry. At the end of the paper\nwe show our results for the density and current responses which differentiate\nbetween diagonal and Landau-level-mixing terms. In conclusion, this treatment\nextracts topological information without resort to Galilean or rotational\nsymmetry, and also reveals more generic geometric structures.\n", "  Recently it was discovered that the ground state orbital angular momentum in\ntwo-dimensional chiral superfluids with pairing symmetry $(p_x+ip_y)^\\nu$\ndepends on the winding number $\\nu$ in a striking manner. The ground state\nvalue for the $\\nu=1$ case is $L_z=\\hbar N/2$ as expected by counting the\nCooper pairs, while a dramatic cancellation takes place for $\\nu>1$. The origin\nof the cancellation is associated with the topological edge states that appear\nin a finite geometry and give rise to a spectral asymmetry. Here we study the\nreduction of orbital angular momentum for different potential profiles and\npairing strengths, showing that the result $L_z=\\hbar N/2$ is robust for\n$\\nu=1$ under all studied circumstances. We study how angular momentum depends\non the gap size $\\Delta/E_F$ and obtain the result $L_z=\\frac{\\hbar\\nu}{2}\nN(1-\\frac{\\mu}{E_F})$ for $\\nu=2,3$. Thus, the gap-dependence of $L_z$ for\n$\\nu<4$ enters at most through the chemical potential while $\\nu\\geq4$ is\nqualitatively different. In addition, we generalize the spectral asymmetry\narguments to \\emph{total} angular momentum in the ground state of triplet\nsuperfluids where due to a spin-orbit coupling $L_z$ is not a good quantum\nnumber. We find that the ground state total angular momentum also behaves very\ndifferently depending on total angular momentum of the Cooper pairs.\n", "  In the limit of large quantum excitations, the classical and quantum\nprobability distributions for a Schr\\\"odinger equation can be compared by using\nthe corresponding WKBJ solutions whose rapid oscillations are averaged. This\nresult is extended for one-dimensional Hamiltonians with a non-usual kinetic\npart. The validity of the approach is tested with a Hamiltonian containing a\nrelativistic kinetic energy operator.\n", "  Teleportation protocol is conventionally treated as a method for quantum\nstate transfer between two spatially separated physical carriers. Recent\nexperimental progress in manipulation with high-dimensional quantum systems\nopens a new framework for implementation of teleportation protocols. We show\nthat the one-qubit teleportation can be considered as a state transfer between\nsubspaces of the whole Hilbert space of an indivisible eight-dimensional\nsystem. We explicitly show all corresponding operations and discuss an\nalternative way of implementation of similar tasks.\n", "  We study a quantum fermion field inside a cylinder in Minkowski space-time.\nOn the surface of the cylinder, the fermion field satisfies either spectral or\nMIT bag boundary conditions. We define rigidly-rotating quantum states in both\ncases, assuming that the radius of the cylinder is sufficiently small that the\nspeed-of-light surface is excluded from the space-time. With this assumption,\nwe calculate rigidly-rotating thermal expectation values of the fermion\ncondensate, neutrino charge current and stress-energy tensor relative to the\nbounded vacuum state. These rigidly-rotating thermal expectation values are\nfinite everywhere inside and on the surface of the cylinder and their detailed\nproperties depend on the choice of boundary conditions. We also compute the\nCasimir divergence of the expectation values of these quantities in the bounded\nvacuum state relative to the unbounded Minkowski vacuum. We find that the rate\nof divergence of the Casimir expectation values depends on the conditions\nimposed on the boundary.\n", "  The XMM-LSS, XMM-COSMOS, and XMM-CDFS surveys are complementary in terms of\nsky coverage and depth. Together, they form a clean sample with the least\npossible variance in instrument effective areas and PSF. Therefore this is one\nof the best samples available to determine the 2-10 keV luminosity function of\nAGN and its evolution. The samples and the relevant corrections for\nincompleteness are described. A total of 2887 AGN is used to build the LF in\nthe luminosity interval 10^42-10^46 erg/s, and in the redshift interval\n0.001-4. A new method to correct for absorption by considering the probability\ndistribution for the column density conditioned on the hardness ratio is\npresented. The binned luminosity function and its evolution is determined with\na variant of the Page-Carrera method, improved to include corrections for\nabsorption and to account for the full probability distribution of photometric\nredshifts. Parametric models, namely a double power-law with LADE or LDDE\nevolution, are explored using Bayesian inference. We introduce the\nWatanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) to compare the models and estimate\ntheir predictive power. Our data are best described by the LADE model, as\nhinted by the WAIC indicator. We also explore the 15-parameter extended LDDE\nmodel recently proposed by Ueda et al., and find that this extension is not\nsupported by our data. The strength of our method is that it provides:\nun-absorbed non-parametric estimates; credible intervals for luminosity\nfunction parameters; model choice according to which one has more predictive\npower for future data.\n", "  We investigate the f(R) theory of gravity with broken diffeomorphism due to\nthe change of the coefficient in front of the total divergence term in the\n(3+1)-decomposition of the scalar curvature. We perform the canonical analysis\nof this theory and show that its consistent, i.e. with no unphysical degrees of\nfreedom, form is equivalent to the low-energy limit of the non-projectable f(R)\nHorava-Lifshitz theory of gravity. We also analyze its cosmological solutions\nand show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained also in the case of this\nbroken symmetry. The consequences of the proposed theory on the asymptotic\nsolutions of a few specific models in the cosmological context are also\npresented.\n", "  Few-body systems, such as cold atoms and halo nuclei, share universal\nfeatures at low energies, which are insensitive to the underlying\ninter-particle interactions at short ranges. These low-energy properties can be\ninvestigated in the framework of effective field theory with two-body and\nthree-body contact interactions. I review the effective-field-theory studies of\nuniversal physics in three-body systems, focusing on the application in cold\natoms and halo nuclei.\n", "  Progress in describing thermodynamic phase transitions in quantum systems is\nobtained by noticing that the Gibbs operator $e^{-\\beta H}$ for a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) lattice system with a Hamiltonian $H$ can be represented\nby a three-dimensional tensor network, the third dimension being the imaginary\ntime (inverse temperature) $\\beta$. Coarse-graining the network along $\\beta$\nresults in a 2D projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) with a finite bond\ndimension $D$. The coarse-graining is performed by a tree tensor network of\nisometries. The isometries are optimized variationally --- taking into account\nfull tensor environment --- to maximize the accuracy of the PEPO. The algorithm\nis applied to the isotropic quantum compass model on an infinite square lattice\nnear a symmetry-breaking phase transition at finite temperature. From the\nlinear susceptibility in the symmetric phase and the order parameter in the\nsymmetry-broken phase the critical temperature is estimated at ${\\cal\nT}_c=0.0606(4)J$, where $J$ is the isotropic coupling constant between $S=1/2$\npseudospins.\n", "  We developed a novel approach based on a generalization of factorization and\nnuclear spectral functions, allowing for a consistent treatment of the\namplitudes involving one- and two-nucleon currents, whose contribution to the\nnuclear electromagnetic response in the transverse channel is known to be\nsignificant. We report the results of calculations of the inclusive\nelectron-carbon cross section, showing that the inclusion of processes\ninvolving two-nucleon currents appreciably improves the agreement between\ntheory and data in the dip region, between the quasi elastic and\n$\\Delta$-production peaks. The implications for the analysis of\nneutrino-nucleus cross sections are discussed.\n", "  The problem of obtaining canonical Hamiltonian structures from the equations\nof motion, without any knowledge of the action, is studied in the context of\nthe spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models. Modifications to\nRaychaudhuri equation are implemented independently as quadratic and cubic\nterms of energy density without introducing additional degrees of freedom.\nDepending on their sign, modifications make gravity repulsive above a curvature\nscale for matter satisfying strong energy condition, or more attractive than in\nthe classical theory. Canonical structure of the modified theories is\ndetermined demanding that the total Hamiltonian be a linear combination of\ngravity and matter Hamiltonians. In the quadratic repulsive case, the modified\ncanonical phase space of gravity is a polymerized phase space with canonical\nmomentum as inverse trigonometric function of Hubble rate; the canonical\nHamiltonian can be identified with the effective Hamiltonian in loop quantum\ncosmology. The repulsive cubic modification results in a `generalized\npolymerized' canonical phase space. Both of the repulsive modifications are\nfound to yield singularity avoidance. In contrast, the quadratic and cubic\nattractive modifications result in a canonical phase space in which canonical\nmomentum is non-trigonometric and singularities persist. Our results hint on\nconnections between repulsive/attractive nature of modifications to gravity\narising from gravitational sector and polymerized/non-polymerized gravitational\nphase space.\n", "  Using the Double Chooz detector, designed to measure the neutrino mixing\nangle $\\theta_{13}$, the products of $\\mu^-$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{13}$C,\n$^{14}$N and $^{16}$O have been measured. Over a period of 489.5 days,\n$2.3\\times10^6$ stopping cosmic $\\mu^-$ have been collected, of which\n$1.8\\times10^5$ captured on carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen nuclei in the inner\ndetector scintillator or acrylic vessels. The resulting isotopes were tagged\nusing prompt neutron emission (when applicable), the subsequent beta decays,\nand, in some cases, $\\beta$-delayed neutrons. The most precise measurement of\nthe rate of $^{12}\\mathrm C(\\mu^-,\\nu)^{12}\\mathrm B$ to date is reported:\n$6.57^{+0.11}_{-0.21}\\times10^{3}\\,\\mathrm s^{-1}$, or\n$(17.35^{+0.35}_{-0.59})\\%$ of nuclear captures. By tagging excited states\nemitting gammas, the ground state transition rate to $^{12}$B has been\ndetermined to be $5.68^{+0.14}_{-0.23}\\times10^3\\,\\mathrm s^{-1}$. The\nheretofore unobserved reactions $^{12}\\mathrm\nC(\\mu^-,\\nu\\alpha)^{8}\\mathrm{Li}$, $^{13}\\mathrm C(\\mu^-,\\nu\\mathrm\nn\\alpha)^{8}\\mathrm{Li}$, and $^{13}\\mathrm C(\\mu^-,\\nu\\mathrm n)^{12}\\mathrm\nB$ are measured. Further, a population of $\\beta$n decays following stopping\nmuons is identified with $5.5\\sigma$ significance. Statistics limit our ability\nto identify these decays definitively. Assuming negligible production of\n$^{8}$He, the reaction $^{13}\\mathrm C(\\mu^-,\\nu\\alpha)^{9}\\mathrm{Li}$ is\nfound to be present at the $2.7\\sigma$ level. Limits are set on a variety of\nother processes.\n", "  Recent results from the experimental collaborations at LHC give hints of a\nresonance in the diphoton channel at an invariant mass of 750 GeV. We show that\nsuch a scalar resonance would be possible in an $U(1)$ extension of the SM\nwhere the extended symmetry is hidden and yet to be discovered. We explore the\npossibilities of accommodating this excess by introducing a minimal extension\nto the matter content and highlight the parameter space that can accommodate\nthe observed diphoton resonance in the model. The model also predicts new\ninteresting signals that may be observed at the current LHC run.\n", "  We analyze the entropy production and the maximal extractable work from a\nsqueezed thermal reservoir. The nonequilibrium quantum nature of the reservoir\ninduces an entropy transfer with a coherent contribution while modifying its\nthermal part, allowing work extraction from a single reservoir, as well as\ngreat improvements in power and efficiency for quantum heat engines.\nIntroducing a modified quantum Otto cycle, our approach fully characterizes\noperational regimes forbidden in the standard case, such as refrigeration and\nwork extraction at the same time, accompanied by efficiencies equal to unity.\n", "  We use the soft-collinear bootstrap to construct the 8-loop integrand for the\n4-point amplitude and 4-stress-tensor correlation function in planar maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Both have a unique representation in terms of\nplanar, conformal integrands grouped according to a hidden symmetry discovered\nfor correlation functions. The answer we find exposes a fundamental tension\nbetween manifest locality and planarity with manifest conformality not seen at\nlower loops. For the first time, the integrand must include terms that are\nfinite even on-shell and terms that are divergent even off-shell (so-called\n`pseudoconformal' integrals). We describe these novelties and their\nconsequences in this letter, and we make the full correlator and amplitude\navailable as part of this work's submission files to the arXiv.\n", "  It is well known that in a quantum phase transition (QPT), entanglement\nremains short ranged [Osterloh et al., Nature 416 608-610 (2005)]. We ask if\nthere is a quantum property entailing the whole system which diverges near this\npoint. Using the recently proposed measures of quantum macroscopisity, we show\nthat near a quantum critical point, it is the effective size of macroscopic\nsuperposition between the two symmetry breaking states which grows to the scale\nof system size and its derivative with respect to the coupling shows both\nsingular behavior and scaling properties.\n", "  We study a Brownian particle diffusing under a time-modulated stochastic\nresetting mechanism to a fixed position. The rate of resetting r(t) is a\nfunction of the time t since the last reset event. We derive a sufficient\ncondition on r(t) for a steady-state probability distribution of the position\nof the particle to exist. We derive the form of the steady-state distributions\nunder some particular choices of r(t) and also consider the late time\nrelaxation behavior of the probability distribution. Finally we consider first\npassage time properties for the Brownian particle to reach the origin and\nderive a formula for the mean first passage time. We study optimal properties\nof the mean first passage time and show that a threshold function is at least\nlocally optimal for the problem of minimizing the mean first passage time.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional (1D,\n2D) Gaussian beams in the fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation (FSE) without a\npotential, analytically and numerically. Without chirp, a 1D Gaussian beam\nsplits into two nondiffracting Gaussian beams during propagation, while a 2D\nGaussian beam undergoes conical diffraction. When a Gaussian beam carries\nlinear chirp, the 1D beam deflects along the trajectories $z=\\pm2(x-x_0)$,\nwhich are independent of the chirp. In the case of 2D Gaussian beam, the\npropagation is also deflected, but the trajectories align along the diffraction\ncone $z=2\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and the direction is determined by the chirp. Both 1D\nand 2D Gaussian beams are diffractionless and display uniform propagation. The\nnondiffracting property discovered in this model applies to other beams as\nwell. Based on the nondiffracting and splitting properties, we introduce the\nTalbot effect of diffractionless beams in FSE.\n", "  We theoretically study spin and charge transport induced by a twisted light\nbeam irradiated on a disordered surface of a doped three dimensional\ntopological insulator (TI). We find that various types of spin vortices are\nimprinted on the surface of the TI depending on the spin and orbital angular\nmomentum of the incident light. The key mechanism for the appearance of the\nunconventional spin structure is the spin-momentum locking in the surface state\nof the TI. Besides, the diffusive transport of electrons under an inhomogeneous\nelectric field causes a gradient of the charge density, which then induces\nnonlocal charge current and spin density as well as the spin current. We\ndiscuss the relation between these quantities within the linear response to the\napplied electric field using the Keldysh-Green's function method.\n", "  We derive a bulk-boundary correspondence for three-dimensional (3D)\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with unitary symmetries. The\ncorrespondence consists of three equations that relate bulk properties of these\nphases to properties of their gapped, symmetry-preserving surfaces. Both the\nbulk and surface data appearing in our correspondence are defined via a\nprocedure in which we gauge the symmetries of the system of interest and then\nstudy the braiding statistics of excitations of the resulting gauge theory. The\nbulk data is defined in terms of the statistics of bulk excitations, while the\nsurface data is defined in terms of the statistics of surface excitations. An\nappealing property of this data is that it is plausibly complete in the sense\nthat the bulk data uniquely distinguishes each 3D SPT phase, while the surface\ndata uniquely distinguishes each gapped, symmetric surface. Our correspondence\napplies to any 3D bosonic SPT phase with finite Abelian unitary symmetry group.\nIt applies to any surface that (1) supports only Abelian anyons and (2) has the\nproperty that the anyons are not permuted by the symmetries.\n", "  Perfectly conducting boundaries, and their Dirichlet counterparts for quantum\nscalar fields, predict nonintegrable energy densities. A more realistic model\nwith a finite ultraviolet cutoff yields two inconsistent values for the force\non a curved or edged boundary (the \"pressure anomaly\"). A still more realistic,\nbut still easily calculable, model replaces the hard wall by a power-law\npotential; because it involves no a posteriori modification of the formulas\ncalculated from the theory, this model should be anomaly-free. Here we first\nset up the formalism and notation for the quantization of a scalar field in the\nbackground of a planar soft wall, and we approximate the reduced Green function\nin perturbative and WKB limits (the latter being appropriate when either the\nmode frequency or the depth into the wall is sufficiently large). Then we\ndisplay numerical calculations of energy density and pressure for the region\noutside the wall, which show that the pressure anomaly does not occur there.\nCalculations inside the wall are postponed to later papers, which must tackle\nregularization and renormalization of divergences induced by the potential in\nthe bulk region.\n", "  We perform a phase space analysis of a generalized modified gravity theory\nwith nonminimally coupling between geometry and matter. We apply the dynamical\nsystem approach to this generalized model and find that in the cosmological\ncontext, different choices of Lagrangian density will apparently result in\ndifferent phases of the Universe. By carefully choosing the variables, we prove\nthat there is an attractor solution to describe the late time accelerating\nuniverse when the modified gravity is chosen in a simple power-law form of the\ncurvature scalar. We further examine the temperature evolution based on the\nthermodynamic understanding of the model. Confronting the model with supernova\ntype Ia data sets, we find that the nonminimally coupled theory of gravity is a\nviable model to describe the late time Universe acceleration.\n", "  We study the $\\Lambda_{b}\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{0}\\Lambda$ reaction\nconsidering both the $K^{0}\\Lambda$ interaction with its coupled channels and\nthe $J/\\psi\\Lambda$ interaction. The latter is described by taking into account\nthe fact that there are predictions for a hidden-charm state with strangeness\nthat couples to $J/\\psi\\Lambda$. By using the coupling of the resonance to\n$J/\\psi\\Lambda$ from these predictions we show that a neat peak can be observed\nin the $J/\\psi\\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution, rather stable under changes\nof unknown magnitudes. In some cases, one finds a dip structure associated to\nthat state, but a signal of the state shows up in the $J/\\psi$ spectrum.\n", "  We theoretically predict a generation of a current in Weyl semimetals by\napplying circularly polarized light. The electric field of the light can drive\nan effective magnetic field of order of ten Tesla. For lower frequency light, a\nnon-equilibrium spin distribution is formed near the Fermi surface. Due to the\nspin-momentum locking, a giant electric current proportional to the effective\nmagnetic field is induced. On the other hand, higher frequency light realizes a\nquasi-static Floquet state with no induced electric current. We discuss\nrelevant materials and estimate order of magnitude of the induced current.\n", "  Rugged (or, rough) energy landscape (REL) with spatially distributed maxima\nand minima are often employed in applications of physics, chemistry and biology\n(enzyme kinetics, protein folding, diffusion in disordered solids, transport in\norganic semiconductors, relaxation in random spin systems, in supercooled\nliquids and glasses). Sometimes the system needs to be modeled as a random\nwalker in high dimensions (like in protein folding/unfolding) where dimensions\ncould be the distances between different amino acid residues (as in unfolding\nof HP-36). Nevertheless, most of the theoretical studies of these phenomena\nstill employ a one dimensional description. This is despite the prediction that\nin a rough (or, rugged) energy landscape (REL), diffusion in one dimension (1d)\nis predicted to be pathologically different from any higher dimension with the\nincreased chance of encountering broken ergodicity (Stein and Newman, 2012). We\nexplore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an\neffective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them\nwith the available computer simulation results. We find that at intermediate\nlevel of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion\nis well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on\ndimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (~5-10) in going from\n1d to 2d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2d to 3d and\n3d to 4d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10-20% only. When\nruggedness is given by random traps with an exponential distribution of barrier\nheights, the mean square displacement is sub-diffusive (a well-known result),\nbut the growth of MSD is described by different exponents in one and higher\ndimensions. The exponent of growth is larger in higher dimensions than in 1d.\n", "  We construct two-dimensional non-Abelian topologically ordered states by\nstrongly coupling arrays of one-dimensional quantum wires via interactions. In\nour scheme, all charge degrees of freedom are gapped, so the construction can\nuse either quantum wires or quantum spin chains as building blocks, with the\nsame end result. The construction gaps the degrees of freedom in the bulk,\nwhile leaving decoupled states at the edges that are described by conformal\nfield theories (CFT) in $(1+1)$-dimensional space and time. We consider both\nthe cases where time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is present or absent. When TRS is\nabsent, the edge states are chiral and stable. We prescribe, in particular, how\nto arrive at all the edge states described by the unitary CFT minimal models\nwith central charges $c<1$. These non-Abelian spin liquid states have vanishing\nquantum Hall conductivities, but non-zero thermal ones. When TRS is present, we\ndescribe scenarios where the bulk state can be a non-Abelian, non-chiral, and\ngapped quantum spin liquid, or a gapless one. In the former case, we find that\nthe edge states are also gapped. The paper provides a brief review of\nnon-Abelian bosonization and affine current algebras, with the purpose of being\nself-contained. To illustrate the methods in a warm-up exercise, we recover the\nten-fold way classification of two-dimensional non-interacting topological\ninsulators using the Majorana representation that naturally arises within\nnon-Abelian bosonization. Within this scheme, the classification reduces to\ncounting the number of null singular values of a mass matrix, with gapless edge\nmodes present when left and right null eigenvectors exist.\n", "  According to the braneworld idea, ordinary matter is confined on a\n3-dimensional space (brane) that is embedded in a higher-dimensional space-time\nwhere gravity propagates. In this work, after reviewing the limits coming from\ngeneral relativity, finiteness of pressure and causality on the brane, we\nderive observational constraints on the braneworld parameters from the\nexistence of stable compact stars. The analysis is carried out by solving\nnumerically the brane-modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, using\ndifferent representative equations of state to describe matter in the star\ninterior. The cases of normal dense matter, pure quark matter and hybrid matter\nare considered.\n", "  We show that a slowly decaying current pulse can lead to nearly deterministic\nprecessional switching in the presence of noise. We consider a biaxial\nmacrospin, with an easy axis in the plane and a hard axis out-of-the plane,\ntypical of thin film nanomagnets patterned into asymmetric shapes. Out-of-plane\nprecessional magnetization orbits are excited with a current pulse with a\ncomponent of spin polarization normal to the film plane. By numerically\nintegrating the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation we show\nthat thermal noise leads to strong dephasing of the magnetization orbits.\nHowever, an adiabatically decreasing pulse amplitude overwhelmingly leads to\nmagnetization reversal, with a final state that {\\em only} depends on the pulse\npolarity, not on the pulse amplitude. We develop an analytic model to explain\nthis phenomena and to determine the pulse decay time necessary for adiabatic\nmagnetization relaxation and thus precessional magnetization switching.\n", "  We raise the analytical knowledge of the eccentricity-expansion of the\nDetweiler-Barack-Sago redshift invariant in a Schwarzschild spacetime up to the\n9.5th post-Newtonian order (included) for the $e^2$ and $e^4$ contributions,\nand up to the 4th post-Newtonian order for the higher eccentricity\ncontributions through $e^{20}$. We convert this information into an analytical\nknowledge of the effective-one-body radial potentials $\\bar d(u)$, $\\rho(u)$\nand $q(u)$ through the 9.5th post-Newtonian order. We find that our analytical\nresults are compatible with current corresponding numerical self-force data.\n", "  The only relativistic reflection model that implements a parameter relating\nthe intensity incident on an accretion disk to the observed intensity is\nrelxill. The parameter used in earlier versions of this model, referred to as\nthe reflection strength, is unsatisfactory, and it has been superseded by a\nparameter that provides insight into the accretion geometry, namely the\nreflection fraction. The reflection fraction is defined as the ratio of the\ncoronal intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches\nthe observer. The relxill model combines a general relativistic ray-tracing\ncode and a photoionization code to compute the component of radiation reflected\nfrom an accretion that is illuminated by an internal source. The reflection\nfraction is a particularly important parameter for relativistic models with\nwell-defined geometry, such as the lamppost model, which is a focus of this\npaper. Relativistic spectra are compared for three inclinations and for four\nvalues of the key parameter of the lamppost model, namely the height above the\nblack hole of the illuminating, on-axis point source. In all cases, the\nstrongest reflection is produced for low source heights and high spin. A\nlow-spin black hole is shown to be incapable of producing enhanced relativistic\nreflection. Results for the relxill model are compared to those obtained with\nother models and a Monte Carlo simulation. Fitting data using the relxill model\nand the recently implemented parameter the reflection fraction, one can\nconstrain the geometry of a system, under the assumption of a lamppost-like\naccretion geometry. The reflection fraction is independent of such system\nparameters as inclination and black hole spin. The reflection fraction\nparameter was implemented with the name refl_frac in all flavors of the relxill\nmodel, and the nonrelativistic reflection model xillver, in v0.4a (18 January\n2016).\n", "  Turbulence in the weakly collisional intracluster medium of galaxies (ICM) is\nable to generate strong thermal velocity anisotropies in the ions (with respect\nto the local magnetic field direction), if the magnetic moment of the particles\nis conserved in the absence of Coulomb collisions. In this scenario, the\nanisotropic pressure magnetohydrodynamic (AMHD) turbulence shows a very\ndifferent statistical behaviour from the standard MHD one and is unable to\namplify seed magnetic fields, in disagreement with previous cosmological MHD\nsimulations which are successful to explain the observed magnetic fields in the\nICM. On the other hand, temperature anisotropies can also drive plasma\ninstabilities which can relax the anisotropy. This work aims to compare the\nrelaxation rate with the growth rate of the anisotropies driven by the\nturbulence. We employ quasilinear theory to estimate the ions scattering rate\ndue to the parallel firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron instabilities, for a\nset of plasma parameters resulting from AMHD simulations of the turbulent ICM.\nWe show that the ICM turbulence can sustain only anisotropy levels very close\nto the instabilities thresholds. We argue that the AMHD model which bounds the\nanisotropies at the marginal stability levels can describe the Alfvenic\nturbulence cascade in the ICM.\n", "  With x-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry we\nstudied how the magnetic proximity effect at the interface between the cuprate\nhigh-$T_C$ superconductor $\\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_7}$ (YBCO) and the ferromagnet\n$\\mathrm{La_{2/3}Ca_{1/3}MnO_3}$ (LCMO) is related to the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of the LCMO layers. In particular, we explored how the\nmagnitude of the ferromagnetic Cu moment on the YBCO side depends on the\nstrength of the antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange coupling with the Mn moment on\nthe LCMO side. We found that the Cu moment remains sizeable if the AF coupling\nwith the Mn moments is strongly reduced or even entirely suppressed. The\nferromagnetic order of the Cu moments thus seems to be intrinsic to the\ninterfacial CuO$_2$ planes and related to a weakly ferromagnetic intra-planar\nexchange interaction. The latter is discussed in terms of the partial\noccupation of the Cu $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, which occurs in the context of\nthe so-called orbital reconstruction of the interfacial Cu ions.\n", "  When sessile droplets are excited by ultrasonic traveling surface acoustic\nwaves (SAWs), they undergo complex dynamics with both oscillations and\ntranslational motion. While the nature of the Rayleigh-Lamb quadrupolar drop\noscillations has been identified, their origin and their influence on the drop\nmobility remains unexplained. Indeed the physics behind this peculiar dynamics\nis complex with nonlinearities involved both at the excitation level (acoustic\nstreaming and radiation pressure) and in the droplet response (nonlinear\noscillations and contact line dynamics). In this paper, we investigate the\ndynamics of sessile and pendant drops excited by SAWs. For pendant drops,\nso-far unreported dynamics are observed close to the drop detachment threshold\nwith the suppression of the translational motion. Away from this threshold, the\ncomparison between pendant and sessile drop dynamics allows us to identify the\nrole played by gravity or more generally by an initial or dynamically induced\nstretching of the drop. In turn, we elucidate the origin of the resonance\nfrequency shift, as well as the origin of the strong correlation between\noscillatory and translational motion. We show that for sessile drops, the\nvelocity is mainly determined by the amplitude of oscillation and that the\nsaturation observed is due to the nonlinear dependence of the drop response\nfrequency on the dynamically induced stretching.\n", "  We address characterization of many-body superradiant systems and establish a\nfundamental connection between quantum criticality and the possibility of\nlocally estimating the coupling constant, i.e extracting its value by probing\nonly a portion of the whole system. In particular, we consider Dicke-like\nsuperradiant systems made of an ensmble of two-level atoms interacting with a\nsingle-mode radiation field at zero effective temperature, and address\nestimation of the coupling by measurements performed only on radiation. At\nfirst, we obtain analytically the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and show\nthat optimal estimation of the coupling may be achieved by tuning the frequency\nof the radiation field to drive the system towards criticality. The scaling\nbehavior of the QFI at the critical point is obtained explicitly upon\nexploiting the symplectic formalism for Gaussian states. We then analyze the\nperformances of feasible detection schemes performed only on the radiation\nsubsystem, namely homodyne detection and photon counting, and show that the\ncorresponding Fisher Informations (FIs) approach the global QFI in the critical\nregion. We thus conclude that criticality is a twofold resource. On the one\nhand, global QFI diverges at the critical point, i.e. the coupling may be\nestimated with the arbitrary precision. On the other hand, the FIs of feasible\nlocal measurements, (which are generally smaller than the QFI out of the\ncritical region), show the same scaling of the global QFI, i.e. optimal\nestimation of coupling may be achieved by locally probing the system, despite\nits strongly interacting nature.\n", "  The Caldeira-Leggett (CL) model, which describes a system bi-linearly coupled\nto a harmonic bath, has enjoyed popularity in condensed phase spectroscopy\nowing to its utmost simplicity. However, the applicability of the model to\ncases with anharmonic system potentials, as it is required for the description\nof realistic systems in solution, is questionable due to the presence of the\ninvertibility problem [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., \\textbf{6}, 2722 (2015)] unless\nthe system itself resembles the CL model form. This might well be the case at\nsurfaces or in the solid regime, which we here confirm for a particular example\nof an iodine molecule in the atomic argon environment under high pressure. For\nthis purpose we extend the recently proposed Fourier method for parameterizing\nlinear generalized Langevin dynamics[J. Chem. Phys., \\textbf{142}, 244110\n(2015)] to the non-linear case based on the CL model and perform an extensive\nerror analysis. In order to judge on the applicability of this model in\nadvance, we give handy empirical criteria and discuss the effect of the\npotential renormalization term. The obtained results provide evidence that the\nCL model can be used for describing a potentially broad class of systems.\n", "  We explore the possibility of computing fermionic correlators on the lattice\nby combining a domain decomposition with a multi-level integration scheme. The\nquark propagator is expanded in series of terms with a well defined\nhierarchical structure. The higher the order of a term, the (exponentially)\nsmaller its magnitude, the less local is its dependence on the gauge field.\nOnce inserted in a Wick contraction, the gauge-field dependence of the terms in\nthe resulting series can be factorized so that it is suitable for multi-level\nMonte Carlo integration. We test the strategy in quenched QCD by computing the\ndisconnected correlator of two flavor-diagonal pseudoscalar densities, and a\nnucleon two-point function. In either cases we observe a significant\nexponential increase of the signal-to-noise ratio.\n", "  We study the nucleation of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) phase in a hadron gas\nat low temperatures and high baryon densities. This kind of process will\npresumably happen very often in nuclear collisions at FAIR and NICA. When the\nappropriate energy densities (or baryon densities) and temperatures are reached\nthe conversion of one phase into another is not instantaneous. It is a complex\nprocess, which involves the nucleation of bubbles of the new phase. One\nimportant element of this transition process is the rate of growth of a QGP\nbubble. In order to estimate it we solve the Relativistic Rayleigh$-$Plesset\nequation which governs the dynamics of a relativistic spherical bubble in a\nstrongly interacting medium. The baryon rich hadron gas is represented by the\nnonlinear Walecka model and the QGP is described by the MIT bag model and also\nby a mean field model of QCD.\n", "  Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we analyze the temperature\ndependence of the spectral function of a magnetic impurity described by the\nsingle-impurity Anderson model coupled to superconducting contacts. With\nincreasing temperature the spectral weight is gradually transferred from the\n$\\delta$-peak (Shiba/Yu-Shiba-Rusinov/Andreev bound state) to the continuous\nsub-gap background, but both spectral features coexist at any finite\ntemperature, i.e., the $\\delta$-peak itself persists to temperatures of order\n$\\Delta$. The continuous background is due to inelastic exchange scattering of\nBogoliubov quasiparticles off the impurity and it is thermally activated since\nit requires a finite thermal population of quasiparticles above the gap. In the\nsinglet regime for strong hybridization (charge-fluctuation regime) we detect\nthe presence of an additional sub-gap structure just below the gap edges with\nthermally activated behavior, but with an activation energy equal to the Shiba\nstate excitation energy. These peaks can be tentatively interpreted as Shiba\nbound states arising from the scattering of quasiparticles off the thermally\nexcited sub-gap doublet Shiba states, i.e., as high-order Shiba states.\n", "  We review the effective field theory (EFT) approach to gravitational\ndynamics. We focus on extended objects in long-wavelength backgrounds and\ngravitational wave emission from spinning binary systems. We conclude with an\nintroduction to EFT methods for the study of cosmological large scale\nstructures.\n", "  Recently, it was argued (Eur. Phys. J. C {\\bf73}, 2487 (2013)) that the total\nentropy of a gravitational system should be related to the volume of system\ninstead of the system surface. Here, we show that this new proposal cannot\nsatisfy the unified first law of thermodynamics and the Friedmans equation\nsimultaneously, unless the effects of dark energy candidate on the horizon\nentropy are considered. In fact, our study shows that some types of dark energy\ncandidate may admit this proposal. Some general properties of required dark\nenergy are also addressed. Moreover, our investigation shows that this new\nproposal for entropy, while combined with the second law of thermodynamics (as\nthe backbone of Verlinde's proposal), helps us in providing a thermodynamic\ninterpretation for the difference between the surface and bulk degrees of\nfreedom which, according to Padmanabhan's proposal, leads to the emergence of\nspacetime and thus the universe expansion. In fact, our investigation shows\nthat the entropy changes of system may be equal to the difference between the\nsurface and bulk degrees of freedom falling from surface into the system\nvolume. Briefly, our results signal us that this new proposal for entropy may\nbe in agreement with the thermodynamics laws, the Friedmann equation,\nPadmanabhan's holographic proposal for the emergence of spacetime and therefore\nthe universe expansion. In fact, this new definition of entropy may be used to\nmake a bridge between Verlinde's and Padmanabhan's proposals.\n", "  We study extreme value statistics (EVS) for spatially extended models\nexhibiting mixed order phase transitions (MOT). These are phase transitions\nwhich exhibit features common to both first order (discontinuity of the order\nparameter) and second order (diverging correlation length) transitions. We\nconsider here the truncated inverse distance squared Ising (TIDSI) model which\nis a prototypical model exhibiting MOT, and study analytically the extreme\nvalue statistics of the domain lengths. The lengths of the domains are\nidentically distributed random variables except for the global constraint that\ntheir sum equals the total system size $L$. In addition, the number of such\ndomains is also a fluctuating variable, and not fixed. In the paramagnetic\nphase, we show that the distribution of the largest domain length $l_{\\max}$\nconverges, in the large $L$ limit, to a Gumbel distribution. However, at the\ncritical point (for a certain range of parameters) and in the ferromagnetic\nphase, we show that the fluctuations of $l_{\\max}$ are governed by novel\ndistributions which we compute exactly. Our main analytical results are\nverified by numerical simulations.\n", "  We analyze the possible interaction-induced superconducting instabilities in\nnoncentrosymmetric systems based on symmetries of the normal state. It is\nproven that pure electron-phonon coupling will always lead to a fully gapped\nsuperconductor that does not break time-reversal symmetry and is topologically\ntrivial. We show that topologically nontrivial behavior can be induced by\nmagnetic doping without gapping out the resulting Kramers pair of Majorana edge\nmodes. In case of superconductivity arising from the particle-hole fluctuations\nassociated with a competing instability, the properties of the condensate\ncrucially depend on the time-reversal behavior of the order parameter of the\ncompeting instability. When the order parameter preserves time-reversal\nsymmetry, we obtain exactly the same properties as in case of phonons. If it is\nodd under time-reversal, the Cooper channel of the interaction will be fully\nrepulsive leading to sign changes of the gap and making spontaneous\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking possible. To discuss topological properties, we\nfocus on fully gapped time-reversal symmetric superconductors and derive\nconstraints on possible pairing states that yield necessary conditions for the\nemergence of topologically nontrivial superconductivity. These conditions might\nserve as a tool in the search for topological superconductors. We also discuss\nimplications for oxides heterostructures and single-layer FeSe.\n", "  Several recent cosmological analyses have found tension between constraints\nderived from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) data\nand those derived from other data sets, such as the Planck cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) temperature anisotropies. Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al. (2013). We analyze three magnitude-limited galaxy samples, finding\n2-4sigma evidence for m<1 using the deepest sample (i<24), while the others are\nconsistent with m=1 (no bias). This matches the expectation that the shapes of\nfaint galaxies are the most prone to measurement biases. Our results for m are\nessentially independent of the assumed cosmology, and only weakly sensitive to\nassumptions about the galaxy bias. We consider three galaxy bias models,\nfinding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than\nunity. A value of m~0.9 would suffice to reconcile the amplitude of density\nfluctuations inferred from the CFHTLenS shear two-point statistics with that\ninferred from Planck CMB temperature data. This scenario is consistent with our\nresults.\n", "  Limit-periodic structures are well ordered but nonperiodic, and hence have\nnontrivial vibrational modes. We study a ball and spring model with a\nlimit-periodic pattern of spring stiffnesses and identify a set of extended\nmodes with arbitrarily low participation ratios, a situation that appears to be\nunique to limit-periodic systems. The balls that oscillate with large amplitude\nin these modes live on periodic nets with arbitrarily large lattice constants.\nBy studying periodic approximants to the limit-periodic structure, we present\nnumerical evidence for the existence of such modes, and we give a heuristic\nexplanation of their structure.\n", "  We observed three $\\gamma$-ray bursts related to thunderclouds in winter\nusing the prototype of anti-neutrino detector PANDA made of 360-kg plastic\nscintillator deployed at Ohi Power Station at the coastal area of the Japan\nSea. The maximum rate of the events which deposited the energy higher than\n$3\\,$MeV was $(5.5 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^2 {\\rm /s}$.\n  Monte Carlo simulation showed that electrons with approximately monochromatic\nenergy falling downwards from altitudes of order $100\\,$m roughly produced the\nobserved total energy spectra of the bursts. It is supposed that secondary\ncosmic-ray electrons, which act as seed, were accelerated in electric field of\nthunderclouds and multiplied by relativistic runaway electron avalanche. We\nactually found that the $\\gamma$-rays of the bursts entered into the detector\nfrom the direction close to the zenith. The direction stayed constant during\nthe burst within the detector resolution.\n  In addition, taking advantage of the delayed coincidence detection of the\ndetector, we found neutron events in one of the bursts at the maximum rate of\n$\\sim 14\\pm5\\,{\\rm /s}$.\n", "  We extend our assessment of the potential of perturbative coupled cluster\n(CC) expansions for a test set of open-shell atoms and organic radicals to the\ndescription of quadruple excitations. Namely, the second- through sixth-order\nmodels of the recently proposed CCSDT(Q-n) quadruples series [J. Chem. Phys.\n140, 064108 (2014)] are compared to the prominent CCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q)\nmodels. From a comparison of the models in terms of their recovery of total CC\nsingles, doubles, triples, and quadruples (CCSDTQ) energies, we find that the\nperformance of the CCSDT(Q-n) models is independent of the reference used\n(unrestricted or restricted (open-shell) Hartree-Fock), in contrast to the\nCCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q) models, for which the accuracy is strongly\ndependent on the spin of the molecular ground state. By further comparing the\nability of the models to recover relative CCSDTQ atomization energies, the\ndiscrepancy between them is found to be even more pronounced, stressing how a\nbalanced description of both closed- and open-shell species - as found in the\nCCSDT(Q-n) models - is indeed of paramount importance if any perturbative CC\nmodel is to be of chemical relevance for high-accuracy applications. In\nparticular, the third-order CCSDT(Q-3) model is found to offer an encouraging\nalternative to the existing choices of quadruples models used in modern\ncomputational thermochemistry, since the model is still only of moderate cost,\nalbeit markedly more costly than, e.g., the CCSDT(Q) and lambda-CCSDT(Q)\nmodels.\n", "  We estimate the partial widths for the radiative and pionic transitions from\nthe $D_{s1}(2460)$ to the $D_{s0}(2317)$ in a molecule scenario, in which the\n$D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s0}^\\ast(2317)$ are considered as hadronic molecule\nstates of $DK$ and $D^\\ast K$, respectively. The partial widths for the\n$D_{s1}(2460) \\to D_{s0}^\\ast(2317) \\pi^0$ and $D_{s1}(2460) \\to\nD_{s0}^\\ast(2317) \\gamma$ are evaluated to be about $0.19 \\sim 0.22$ keV and\n$3.0 \\sim 3.1$ keV, respectively. In addition, the ratio of the $D_{s1}(2460)\n\\to D_{s0}(2317) \\gamma$ and $D_{s1}(2460) \\to D_{s}^\\ast \\pi^0$ is estimated\nto be about $(6.6\\sim 10.6) \\times 10^{-2}$, which is safely under the measured\nupper limit.\n", "  We report large magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures in\nsingle-crystalline nonmagnetic compounds TaAs$_2$ and NbAs$_2$. Both compounds\nexhibit parabolic-field-dependent MR larger than $5\\times10^3$ in a magnetic\nfield of 9 Tesla at 2 K. The MR starts to deviate from parabolic dependence\nabove 10 T and intends to be saturated in 45 T for TaAs$_2$ at 4.2 K. The Hall\nresistance measurements and band structural calculations reveal their\ncompensated semimetal characteristics. The large MR at low temperatures is\nascribed to a resonance effect of the balanced electrons and holes with large\nmobilities. We also discuss the relation of the MR and samples' quality for\nTaAs$_2$ and other semimetals. We found that the magnitudes of MR are strongly\ndependent on the samples' quality for different compounds.\n", "  Quantum metamaterials generalize the concept of metamaterials (artificial\noptical media) to the case when their optical properties are determined by the\ninterplay of quantum effects in the constituent 'artificial atoms' with the\nelectromagnetic field modes in the system. The theoretical investigation of\nthese structures demonstrated that a number of new effects (such as quantum\nbirefringence, strongly nonclassical states of light, etc) are to be expected,\nprompting the efforts on their fabrication and experimental investigation. Here\nwe provide a summary of the principal features of quantum metamaterials and\nreview the current state of research in this quickly developing field, which\nbridges quantum optics, quantum condensed matter theory and quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  This paper presents a master stability function (MSF) approach for analyzing\nthe stability of amplitude death (AD) in networks of delay-coupled oscillators.\nUnlike the familiar MSFs for instantaneously coupled networks, which typically\nhave a single input encoding for the effects of the eigenvalues of the network\nLaplacian matrix, for delay-coupled networks we show that such MSFs generally\nrequire two additional inputs: the time delay and the coupling strength. To\nutilize the MSF for predicting the stability of AD of arbitrary networks for a\nchosen nonlinear system (node dynamics) and coupling function, we introduce the\nconcept of master stability islands (MSIs), which are two-dimensional stability\nislands of the delay-coupling space together with a third dimension\n(\"altitude\") encoding for eigenvalues that result in stable AD. We compute the\nMSFs and show the corresponding MSIs for several common chaotic systems\nincluding the Rossler, the Lorenz, and Chen's system, and found that it is\ngenerally possible to achieve AD and that a nonzero time delay is necessary for\nthe stabilization of the AD states.\n", "  Governing equations for evolution of concentration and temperature in\nthree-component systems were derived in the framework of classical irreversible\nthermodynamics using Onsager variational principle and were presented for\nsolvent/solvent/polymer and solvent/polymer/polymer systems. The derivation was\ndeveloped from the Gibbs equation of equilibrium thermodynamics using the local\nequilibrium hypothesis, Onsager reciprocal relations and Prigogine theorem for\nsystems in mechanical equilibrium. It was shown that the details of mass and\nheat diffusion phenomena in a ternary system are completely expressed by a 3x3\nmatrix whose entries are mass diffusion coefficients (4 entries), thermal\ndiffusion coefficients (2 entries) and three entries that describe the\nevolution of heat in the system. The entries of the diffusion matrix are\nrelated to the elements of Onsager matrix that are bounded by some constraints\nto satisfy the positive definiteness of entropy production in the system. All\nthe elements of diffusion matrix were expressed in terms of derivatives of\nexchange chemical potentials of the components with respect to concentration\nand temperature. The spinodal curves of ternary polymer solutions were derived\nfrom the governing equations and their correctness was checked by the Hessian\nof free energy density. Moreover, it was proved that setting cross-diffusion\ncoefficients to zero results in a contradiction, and, the governing equations\nwithout cross-diffusion coefficients do not express the actual phase behavior\nof the system.\n", "  Circumstellar asymmetries such as central warps have recently been shown to\ncast shadows on outer disks. We investigate the hydrodynamical consequences of\nsuch variable illumination on the outer regions of a transition disk, and the\ndevelopment of spiral arms. Using 2D simulations, we follow the evolution of a\ngaseous disk passively heated by the central star, under the periodic forcing\nof shadows with an opening angle of $\\sim$28$^\\circ$. With a lower pressure\nunder the shadows, each crossing results in a variable azimuthal acceleration,\nwhich in time develops into spiral density waves. Their pitch angles evolve\nfrom $\\Pi \\sim 15^\\circ-22^\\circ$ at the onset, to $\\sim$11$^\\circ$-14$^\\circ$,\nover $\\sim$65~AU to 150~AU. Self-gravity enhances the density contrast of the\nspiral waves, as also reported previously for spirals launched by planets. Our\ncontrol simulations with unshadowed irradiation do not develop structures,\nexcept for a different form of spiral waves seen at later times only in the\ngravitationally unstable control case. Scattered light predictions in the\n$H$-band show that such illumination spirals should be observable. We suggest\nthat spiral arms in the case-study transition disk HD~142527 could be explained\nas a result of shadowing from the tilted inner disk.\n", "  Quantum entanglement effects between the electronic spin and charge degrees\nof freedom are examined in an organic molecular solid, termed a dimer-Mott\ninsulating system, in which molecular dimers are arranged in a crystal as\nfundamental units. A low energy effective model includes an antisymmetric\nexchange interaction, as one of the dominant magnetic interactions. This\ninteraction favors a 90 degree spin configuration, and competes with the\nHeisenberg-type exchange interaction. Stabilities of the magnetic ordered\nphases are examined by using the spin-wave theory, as well as the\nSchwinger-boson theory. It is found that the spin-charge interaction promotes\nan instability of the long-range magnetic ordered state around a parameter\nregion where two spin-spiral phases are merged. Implication for the quantum\nspin liquid state observed in $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the temperature-dependent electronic B1g Raman response of a\nslightly under-doped single crystal HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\\delta}$ with a\nsuperconducting critical temperature Tc=122 K. Our main finding is that the\nsuperconducting pair-breaking peak is associated with a dip on its\nhigher-energy side, disappearing together at Tc. This result hints at an\nunconventional pairing mechanism, whereas spectral weight lost in the dip is\ntransferred to the pair-breaking peak at lower energies. This conclusion is\nsupported by cellular dynamical mean-field theory on the Hubbard model, which\nis able to reproduce all the main features of the B1g Raman response and\nexplain the peak-dip behavior in terms of a nontrivial relationship between the\nsuperconducting and the pseudo gaps.\n", "  For a massive vector field with derivative self-interactions, the breaking of\nthe gauge invariance allows the propagation of a longitudinal mode in addition\nto the two transverse modes. We consider generalized Proca theories with\nsecond-order equations of motion in a curved space-time and study how the\nlongitudinal scalar mode of the vector field gravitates on a spherically\nsymmetric background. We show explicitly that cubic-order self-interactions\nlead to the suppression of the longitudinal mode through the Vainshtein\nmechanism. Provided that the dimensionless coupling of the interaction is not\nnegligible, this screening mechanism is sufficiently efficient to give rise to\ntiny corrections to gravitational potentials consistent with solar-system tests\nof gravity. We also study the quartic interactions with the presence of\nnon-minimal derivative coupling with the Ricci scalar and find the existence of\nsolutions where the longitudinal mode completely vanishes. Finally, we discuss\nthe case in which the effect of the quartic interactions dominates over the\ncubic one and show that local gravity constraints can be satisfied under a mild\nbound on the parameters of the theory.\n", "  Motivated by a desire to understand quantum fluctuation energy densities and\nstress within a spatially varying dielectric medium, we examine the vacuum\nexpectation value for the stress tensor of a scalar field with arbitrary\nconformal parameter, in the background of a given potential that depends on\nonly one spatial coordinate. We regulate the expressions by incorporating a\ntemporal-spatial cutoff in the (imaginary) time and transverse-spatial\ndirections. The divergences are captured by the zeroth- and second-order WKB\napproximations. Then the stress tensor is \"renormalized\" by omitting the terms\nthat depend on the cutoff. The ambiguities that inevitably arise in this\nprocedure are both duly noted and restricted by imposing certain physical\nconditions; one result is that the renormalized stress tensor exhibits the\nexpected trace anomaly. The renormalized stress tensor exhibits no pressure\nanomaly, in that the principle of virtual work is satisfied for motions in a\ntransverse direction. We then consider a potential that defines a wall, a\none-dimensional potential that vanishes for $z<0$ and rises like $z^\\alpha$,\n$\\alpha>0$, for $z>0$. The full finite stress tensor is computed numerically\nfor the two cases where explicit solutions to the differential equation are\navailable, $\\alpha=1$ and 2. The energy density exhibits an inverse linear\ndivergence as the boundary is approached from the inside for a linear\npotential, and a logarithmic divergence for a quadratic potential. Finally, the\ninteraction between two such walls is computed, and it is shown that the\nattractive Casimir pressure between the two walls also satisfies the principle\nof virtual work (i.e., the pressure equals the negative derivative of the\nenergy with respect to the distance between the walls).\n", "  Core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are important sources of interstellar dust,\npotentially capable of producing one solar mass of dust in their explosively\nexpelled ejecta. However, unlike other dust sources, the dust has to survive\nthe passage of the reverse shock, generated by the interaction of the supernova\nblast wave with its surrounding medium. Knowledge of the net amount of dust\nproduced by CCSNe is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of dust\nin the local and high-redshift universe. Our aim is to identify the dust\ndestruction mechanisms in the ejecta, and derive the net amount of dust that\nsurvives the passage of the reverse shock. We use analytical models for the\nevolution of a supernova blast wave and of the reverse shock, with special\napplication to the clumpy ejecta of the remnant of Cassiopeia A. We assume that\nthe dust resides in cool oxygen-rich clumps that are uniformly distributed\nwithin the remnant and surrounded by a hot X-ray emitting plasma, and that the\ndust consists of silicates (MgSiO3) and amorphous carbon grains. The passage of\nthe reverse shock through the clumps gives rise to a relative gas-grain motion\nand also destroys the clumps. Inside the ejecta clouds, dust is processed via\nkinetic sputtering, which is terminated either when the grains escape the\nclumps, or when the clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock. In either case,\ngrain destruction proceeds thereafter by thermal sputtering in the hot ambient\ngas. We find that 11.8% and 15.9% of, respectively, the silicate and carbon\ndust survives the passage of the reverse shock by the time the shock has\nreached the center of the remnant. These fractions depend on the morphology of\nthe ejecta and the medium into which the remnant is expanding, as well as the\ncomposition and size distribution of the grains that formed in the ejecta.\nResults will therefore differ for different types of supernovae.\n", "  Recent studies have found higher galaxy metallicities in richer environments.\nIt is not yet clear, however, whether metallicity-environment dependencies are\nmerely an indirect consequence of environmentally dependent formation\nhistories, or of environment related processes directly affecting metallicity.\nHere, we present a first detailed study of metallicity-environment correlations\nin a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, in particular the Illustris\nsimulation. Illustris galaxies display similar relations to those observed.\nUtilizing our knowledge of simulated formation histories, and leveraging the\nlarge simulation volume, we construct galaxy samples of satellites and centrals\nthat are matched in formation histories. This allows us to find that ~1/3 of\nthe metallicity-environment correlation is due to different formation histories\nin different environments. This is a combined effect of satellites (in\nparticular, in denser environments) having on average lower z=0 star formation\nrates (SFRs), and of their older stellar ages, even at a given z=0 SFR. Most of\nthe difference, ~2/3, however, is caused by the higher concentration of\nstar-forming disks of satellite galaxies, as this biases their SFR-weighted\nmetallicities toward their inner, more metal-rich parts. With a newly defined\nquantity, the 'radially averaged' metallicity, which captures the metallicity\nprofile but is independent of the SFR profile, the metallicities of satellites\nand centrals become environmentally independent once they are matched in\nformation history. We find that circumgalactic metallicity (defined as rapidly\ninflowing gas around the virial radius), while sensitive to environment, has no\nmeasurable effect on the metallicity of the star-forming gas inside the\ngalaxies.\n", "  A ferromagnetic needle is predicted to precess about the magnetic field axis\nat a Larmor frequency $\\Omega$ under conditions where its intrinsic spin\ndominates over its rotational angular momentum, $N\\hbar \\gg I\\Omega$ ($I$ is\nthe moment of inertia of the needle about the precession axis and $N$ is the\nnumber of polarized spins in the needle). In this regime the needle behaves as\na gyroscope with spin $N\\hbar$ maintained along the easy axis of the needle by\nthe crystalline and shape anisotropy. A precessing ferromagnetic needle is a\ncorrelated system of $N$ spins which can be used to measure magnetic fields for\nlong times. In principle, by taking advantage of rapid averaging of quantum\nuncertainty, the sensitivity of a precessing needle magnetometer can far\nsurpass that of magnetometers based on spin precession of atoms in the gas\nphase. Under conditions where noise from coupling to the environment is\nsubdominant, the scaling with measurement time $t$ of the quantum- and\ndetection-limited magnetometric sensitivity is $t^{-3/2}$. The phenomenon of\nferromagnetic needle precession may be of particular interest for precision\nmeasurements testing fundamental physics.\n", "  Active motions of a biological membrane can be induced by non-thermal\nfluctuations that occur in the outer environment of the membrane. We discuss\nthe dynamics of a membrane interacting hydrodynamically with an active wall\nthat exerts random velocities on the ambient fluid. Solving the hydrodynamic\nequations of a bound membrane, we first derive a dynamic equation for the\nmembrane fluctuation amplitude in the presence of different types of walls.\nMembrane two-point correlation functions are calculated for three different\ncases; (i) a static wall, (ii) an active wall, and (iii) an active wall with an\nintrinsic time scale. We focus on the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a\ntagged membrane describing the Brownian motion of a membrane segment. For the\nstatic wall case, there are two asymptotic regimes of MSD ($\\sim t^{2/3}$ and\n$\\sim t^{1/3}$) when the hydrodynamic decay rate changes monotonically. In the\ncase of an active wall, the MSD grows linearly in time ($\\sim t$) in the early\nstage, which is unusual for a membrane segment. This linear-growth region of\nthe MSD is further extended when the active wall has a finite intrinsic time\nscale.\n", "  Inspiraling compact binaries with non-negligible orbital eccentricities are\nplausible gravitational wave (GW) sources for the upcoming network of GW\nobservatories. In this paper, we present two prescriptions to compute\npost-Newtonian (PN) accurate inspiral templates for such binaries. First, we\nadapt and extend the post-circular scheme of Yunes {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. D\n80, 084001 (2009)] to obtain a Fourier-domain inspiral approximant that\nincorporates the effects of PN-accurate orbital eccentricity evolution. This\nresults in a fully analytic frequency-domain inspiral waveform with Newtonian\namplitude and 2PN order Fourier phase while incorporating eccentricity effects\nup to sixth order at each PN order. The importance of incorporating\neccentricity evolution contributions to the Fourier phase in a PN consistent\nmanner is also demonstrated. Second, we present an accurate and efficient\nprescription to incorporate orbital eccentricity into the quasi-circular\ntime-domain {\\texttt{TaylorT4}} approximant at 2PN order. New features include\nthe use of rational functions in orbital eccentricity to implement the 1.5PN\norder tail contributions to the far-zone fluxes. This leads to closed form\nPN-accurate differential equations for evolving eccentric orbits and the\nresulting time-domain approximant is accurate and efficient to handle initial\norbital eccentricities $\\leq 0.9$. Preliminary GW data analysis implications\nare probed using match estimates.\n", "  The influence of pressure on the structural and elastic properties of ScM (M\n= Rh, Cu, Ag, Hg) compounds has been performed by using ab initio approach\npseudopotential plane- wave method based on the density functional theory\nwithin the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The optical properties\nhave been investigated under zero pressure. It is found that the optimized\nlattice parameters for all metals are in good agreement with the experimental\ndata and other available theoretical values.\n", "  The excess of events in the diphoton final state near 750 GeV observed by\nATLAS and CMS can be explained within the NMSSM near the R-symmetry limit. Both\nscalars beyond the Standard Model Higgs boson have masses near 750 GeV, mix\nstrongly, and share sizeable production cross sections in association with\nb-quarks as well as branching fractions into a pair of very light\npseudoscalars. Pseudoscalars with a mass of ~ 210 MeV decay into collimated\ndiphotons, whereas pseudoscalars with a mass of ~ 500-550 MeV can decay either\ninto collimated diphotons or into three pi^0 resulting in collimated photon\njets. Various such scenarios are discussed; the dominant constraints on the\nlatter scenario originate from bounds on radiative Upsilon decays, but they\nallow for a signal cross section up to 6.7 fb times the acceptance for\ncollimated multiphotons to pass as a single photon.\n", "  Realistic nuclear potentials, derived within chiral perturbation theory, are\na major breakthrough in modern nuclear structure theory, since they provide a\ndirect link between nuclear physics and its underlying theory, namely the QCD.\nAs a matter of fact, chiral potentials are tailored on the low-energy regime of\nnuclear structure physics, and chiral perturbation theory provides on the same\nfooting two-nucleon forces as well as many-body ones. This feature fits well\nwith modern advances in ab-initio methods and realistic shell-model. Here, we\nwill review recent nuclear structure calculations, based on realistic chiral\npotentials, for both finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter.\n", "  We present the first experimental constraints on the spin-dependent\nWIMP-nucleon elastic cross sections from LUX data acquired in 2013. LUX is a\ndual-phase xenon time projection chamber operating at the Sanford Underground\nResearch Facility (Lead, South Dakota), which is designed to observe the recoil\nsignature of galactic WIMPs scattering from xenon nuclei. A profile likelihood\nratio analysis of $1.4~\\times~10^{4}~\\text{kg}\\cdot~\\text{days}$ of fiducial\nexposure allows 90% CL upper limits to be set on the WIMP-neutron (WIMP-proton)\ncross section of $\\sigma_n~=~9.4~\\times~10^{-41}~\\text{cm}^2$\n($\\sigma_p~=~2.9~\\times~10^{-39}~\\text{cm}^2$) at 33 GeV/c$^2$. The\nspin-dependent WIMP-neutron limit is the most sensitive constraint to date.\n", "  In this paper we show how to redress a shortcoming of the path integral\nscheme for fermionic superfluids and superconductors. This approach is built\naround a simultaneous calculation of electrodynamics and thermodynamics. An\nimportant sum rule, the compressibility sum rule, fails to be satisfied in the\nusual calculation of the electromagnetic and thermodynamic response at the\nGaussian fluctuation level. Here we present a path integral scheme to address\nthis inconsistency. Specifically, at the leading order we argue that the\nsuperconducting gap should be calculated using a different saddle point\ncondition modified by the presence of an external vector potential. This leads\nto the well known gauge-invariant BCS electrodynamic response and is associated\nwith the usual (mean field) expression for thermodynamics. In this way the\ncompressibility sum rule is satisfied at the BCS level. Moreover, this scheme\ncan be readily extended to address arbitrary higher order fluctuation theories.\nAt any level this approach will lead to a gauge invariant and compressibility\nsum rule consistent treatment of electrodynamics and thermodynamics.\n", "  The scattering of polarized light incident from one dielectric medium on its\ntwo-dimensional randomly rough interface with a second dielectric medium is\nstudied. A reduced Rayleigh equation for the scattering amplitudes is derived\nfor the case where p- or s-polarized light is incident on this interface, with\nno assumptions being made regarding the dielectric functions of the media.\nRigorous, purely numerical, nonperturbative solutions of this equation are\nobtained. They are used to calculate the reflectivity and reflectance of the\ninterface, the mean differential reflection coefficient, and the full angular\ndistribution of the intensity of the scattered light. These results are\nobtained for both the case where the medium of incidence is the optically less\ndense medium, and in the case where it is the optically more dense medium.\nOptical analogues of the Yoneda peaks observed in the scattering of x-rays from\nmetal surfaces are present in the results obtained in the latter case. Brewster\nscattering angles for diffuse scattering are investigated, reminiscent of the\nBrewster angle for flat-interface reflection, but strongly dependent on the\nangle of incidence. When the contribution from the transmitted field is added\nto that from the scattered field it is found that the results of these\ncalculations satisfy unitarity with an error smaller than $10^{-4}$.\n", "  The assembly of curved protein rods on fluid membranes is studied using\nimplicit-solvent meshless membrane simulations. As the rod curvature increases,\nthe rods on a membrane tube assemble along the azimuthal direction first and\nsubsequently along the longitudinal direction. Here, we show that both\ntransition curvatures decrease with increasing rod stiffness. For comparison,\ncurvature-inducing isotropic inclusions are also simulated. When the isotropic\ninclusions have the same bending rigidity as the other membrane regions, the\ninclusions are uniformly distributed on the membrane tubes and vesicles even\nfor large spontaneous curvature of the inclusions. However, the isotropic\ninclusions with much larger bending rigidity induce shape deformation and are\nconcentrated on the region of a preferred curvature. For high rod density, high\nrod stiffness, and/or low line tension of the membrane edge, the rod assembly\ninduces vesicle rupture, resulting in the formation of a high-genus vesicle. A\ngradual change in the curvature suppresses this rupture. Hence, large stress,\ncompared to the edge tension, induced by the rod assembly is the key factor\ndetermining rupture. For rod curvature with the opposite sign to the vesicle\ncurvature, membrane rupture induces inversion of the membrane, leading to\ndivision into multiple vesicles as well as formation of a high-genus vesicle.\n", "  Observations of local galaxies harbouring supermassive black holes (BHs) of\nanomalously high mass, M_BH, relative to their stellar mass, M_star, appear to\nbe at odds with simple models of the co-evolution between galaxies and their\ncentral BHs. We study the origin of such outliers in a Lambda cold dark matter\ncontext using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. We find 15\n'M_BH(M_star)-outlier' galaxies, defined as having M_BH more than 1.5 dex above\nthe median M_BH(M_star) relation in the simulation, M_{BH,med}. All\nM_BH(M_star)-outliers are satellite galaxies, typically with M_star ~ 10^10\nM_sun and M_BH ~ 10^8 M_sun. They have all become outliers due to a combination\nof tidal stripping of their outer stellar component acting over several Gyr and\nearly formation times leading to rapid BH growth at high redshift, with the\nformer mechanism being most important for 67 per cent of these outliers. The\nsame mechanisms also cause the M_BH(M_star)-outlier satellites to be amongst\nthe most compact galaxies in the simulation, making them ideal candidates for\nultracompact dwarf galaxy progenitors. The 10 most extreme central galaxies\nfound at z=0 (with log_{10}(M_BH/M_{BH,med}) in [1.2, 1.5]) grow rapidly in\nM_BH to lie well above the present-day M_BH-M_star relation at early times (z >\n2), and either continue to evolve parallel to the z=0 relation or remain\nunchanged until the present day, making them 'relics' of the high-redshift\nuniverse. This high-z formation mechanism may help to explain the origin of\nobserved M_BH(M_star)-outliers with extended dark matter haloes and undisturbed\nmorphologies.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the thermodynamics of black $p$-branes (BB) in\nthe context of Gravity's Rainbow. We investigate this using rainbow functions\nthat have been motivated from loop quantum gravity and $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nnoncommutative spacetime. Then for the sake of comparison, we examine a couple\nof other rainbow functions that have also appeared in the literature. We show\nthat, for consistency, Gravity's Rainbow imposes a constraint on the minimum\nmass of the BB, a constraint that we interpret here as implying the existence\nof a black $p$-brane remnant. This interpretation is supported by the\ncomputation of the black $p$-brane's heat capacity that shows that the latter\nvanishes when the Schwarzschild radius takes on a value that is bigger than its\nextremal limit. We found that the same conclusion is reached for the third\nversion of rainbow functions treated here but not with the second one for which\nonly standard black $p$-brane thermodynamics is recovered.\n", "  We present the first calculation of coupled-channel meson-meson scattering in\nthe isospin $=1$, $G$-parity negative sector, with channels $\\pi \\eta$,\n$K\\overline{K}$ and $\\pi \\eta'$, in a first-principles approach to QCD. From\nthe discrete spectrum of eigenstates in three volumes extracted from lattice\nQCD correlation functions we determine the energy dependence of the $S$-matrix,\nand find that the $S$-wave features a prominent cusp-like structure in $\\pi\n\\eta \\to \\pi \\eta$ close to $K\\overline{K}$ threshold coupled with a rapid turn\non of amplitudes leading to the $K\\overline{K}$ final-state. This behavior is\ntraced to an $a_0(980)$-like resonance, strongly coupled to both $\\pi \\eta$ and\n$K\\overline{K}$, which is identified with a pole in the complex energy plane,\nappearing on only a single unphysical Riemann sheet. Consideration of $D$-wave\nscattering suggests a narrow tensor resonance at higher energy.\n", "  We discuss the implications of a PIXIE-like experiment, which would measure\n$\\mu$-type spectral distortions of the CMB at a level of\n$\\sigma_{\\mu}=(1/n)\\times 10^{-8}$, with $n\\geq1$ representing an improved\nsensitivity (e.g. $n=10$ corresponds to PRISM). Using Planck data and\nconsidering the six-parameter $\\Lambda$CDM model, we compute the posterior for\n$\\mu_8\\equiv\\mu\\times 10^{8}$ and find $\\mu_8=1.57^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$\n($68\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$). This becomes $\\mu_{8} = 1.28^{+0.30}_{-0.52}$\n($68\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$) when the running $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}$ of the spectral\nindex is included. We point out that a sensitivity of about $3\\times$ PIXIE\nimplies a guaranteed discovery: $\\mu$-distortion is detected or\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}\\geq 0$ is excluded (both at $95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$ or higher).\nThis threshold sensitivity sets a clear benchmark for CMB spectrometry. For a\ncombined analysis of PIXIE and current Planck data, we discuss the improvement\non measurements of the tilt $n_\\mathrm{s}$ and the running $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}$\nand the dependence on the choice of the pivot. A fiducial running of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}=-0.01$ (close to the Planck best-fit) leads to a detection\nof negative running at $2\\sigma$ for $5\\times$ PIXIE. A fiducial running of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}=-0.02$, still compatible with Planck, requires $3\\times$\nPIXIE to rule out $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s} = 0$ (at $95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$). We propose\na convenient and compact visualization of the improving constraints on the\ntilt, running and tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  We outline a photometric method for detecting the presence of a\nnon-transiting short-period giant planet in a planetary system harboring one or\nmore longer period transiting planets. Within a prospective system of the type\nthat we consider, a hot Jupiter on an interior orbit inclined to the\nline-of-sight signals its presence through approximately sinusoidal full-phase\nphotometric variations in the stellar light curve, correlated with\nastrometrically induced transit timing variations for exterior transiting\nplanets. Systems containing a hot Jupiter along with a low-mass outer planet or\nplanets on inclined orbits are a predicted hallmark of in situ accretion for\nhot Jupiters, and their presence can thus be used to test planetary formation\ntheories. We outline the prospects for detecting non-transiting hot Jupiters\nusing photometric data from typical \\textit{Kepler} objects of interest (KOIs).\nAs a demonstration of the technique, we perform a brief assessment of\n\\textit{Kepler} candidates and identify a potential non-transiting hot Jupiter\nin the KOI-1822 system. Candidate non-transiting hot Jupiters can be readily\nconfirmed with a small number of Doppler velocity observations, even for stars\nwith $V\\gtrsim14$.\n", "  We calculate the elastic form factors and the Generalized Parton\nDistributions (GPDs) for four low-lying bound states of a demonstration\nfermion-antifermion system, strong coupling positronium ($e \\bar{e}$), using\nBasis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ). Using this approach, we also calculate\nthe impact-parameter dependent GPDs $q(x, {\\vec b_\\perp})$ to visualize the\nfermion density in the transverse plane (${\\vec b_\\perp}$). We compare selected\nresults with corresponding quantities in the non-relativistic limit to reveal\nrelativistic effects. Our results establish the foundation within BLFQ for\ninvestigating the form factors and the GPDs for hadronic systems.\n", "  High redshift star-forming galaxies are discovered routinely through a flux\nexcess in narrowband filters (NB) caused by an emission line. In most cases,\nthe width of such filters is broad compared to typical line widths, and the\nthroughput of the filters varies substantially within the bandpass. This leads\nto substantial uncertainties in redshifts and fluxes that are derived from the\nobservations with one specific NB. In this work we demonstrate that the\nuncertainty in measured line parameters can be sharply reduced by using\nrepeated observations of the same target field with filters that have slightly\ndifferent transmittance curves. Such data are routinely collected with some\nlarge field imaging cameras that use multiple detectors and a separate filter\nfor each of the detectors. An example is the NB118 data from ESO's VISTA\nInfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM). We carefully developed and characterized this method\nto determine more accurate redshift and line flux estimates from the ratio of\napparent fluxes measured from observations in different narrowband filters and\nseveral matching broadband filters. Then, we tested the obtainable quality of\nparameter estimation both on simulated and actual observations for the example\nof Ha in the VIRCAM NB118 filters combined with broadband data in Y, J, H. We\nfind that by using this method, the errors in the measured lines fluxes can be\nreduced up to almost an order of magnitude and that an accuracy in wavelength\nof better than 1nm can be achieved with the ~13nm wide NB118 filters.\n", "  The Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula for $n$-gluon scattering is known to give\nthe same amplitude as the one obtained from Feynman diagrams, though the former\ncontains neither vertices nor propagators explicitly. The equivalence was shown\nby indirect means, not by a direct evaluation of the $(n\\! - \\!3)$-dimensional\nintegral in the CHY formula. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how such a\ndirect evaluation can be carried out. There are two basic difficulties in the\ncalculation: how to handle the large number of terms in the reduced Pfaffian,\nand how to carry out the integrations in the presence of a $\\sigma$-dependence\nmuch more complicated than the Parke-Taylor form found in a CHY double-color\nscalar amplitude. We have solved both of these problems, and have formulated a\nmethod that can be applied to any $n$. Many examples are provided to illustrate\nthese calculations.\n", "  We report a field-temperature phase diagram and an entropy map for the heavy\nfermion compound CeAuSb$_2$. CeAuSb$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically below\n$T_N=6.6$~K, and has two metamagnetic transitions, at 2.8 and 5.6~T. The\nlocations of the critical endpoints of the metamagnetic transitions, which may\nplay a strong role in the putative quantum criticality of CeAuSb$_2$ and\nrelated compounds, are identified. The entropy map reveals an apparent entropy\nbalance with Fermi liquid behavior, implying that above the N\\'{e}el transition\nthe Ce moments are incorporated into the Fermi liquid. High-field data showing\nthat the magnetic behavior is remarkably anisotropic are also reported.\n", "  We study quantum point contacts in two-dimensional topological insulators by\nmeans of quantum transport simulations for InAs/GaSb heterostructures and\nHgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. In InAs/GaSb, the density of edge states shows an\noscillatory decay as a function of the distance to the edge. This is in\ncontrast to the behavior of the edge states in HgTe quantum wells, which decay\ninto the bulk in a simple exponential manner. The difference between the two\nmaterials is brought about by spatial separation of electrons and holes in\nInAs/GaSb, which affects the magnitudes of the parameters describing the\nparticle-hole asymmetry and the strength of intersubband coupling within the\nBernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that the character of the wave function\ndecay impacts directly the dependence of the point contact conductance on the\nconstriction width and the Fermi energy, which can be verified experimentally\nand serve to determine accurately the values of relevant parameters. In the\ncase of InAs/GaSb heterostructures the conductance magnitude oscillates as a\nfunction of the constriction width following the oscillations of the edge state\npenetration, whereas in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells a single switching from\ntransmitting to reflecting contact is predicted.\n", "  We present an explicit solution of carrier and field distributions in abrupt\nPN junctions under equilibrium. An accurate logarithmic numerical method is\nimplemented and results are compared to the analytical solutions. Analysis of\nresults shows reasonable agreement with numerical solution as well as the\ndepletion layer approximation. We discuss extensions to the asymmetric\njunctions. Approximate relations for differential capacitance and I-V\ncharacteristics are also found under non-zero external bias.\n", "  Recent investigations have revealed that ion transport from aqueous\nelectrolytes to ion-selective surfaces is subject to electroconvective\ninstability that stems from coupling of hydrodynamics with electrostatic\nforces. Electroconvection is shown to enhance ion mixing and the net rate of\ntransport. However, systems subject to electroconvection inherently involve\nfluid density variation set by salinity gradient in the bulk fluid. In this\nstudy we thoroughly examine the interplay of gravitational convection and\nchaotic electroconvection. Our results reveal that buoyant forces can\nsignificantly influence the transport rates, otherwise set by\nelectroconvection, when the Rayleigh number $Ra$ of the system exceeds a value\n$Ra \\sim 1000$. We show that buoyancy forces can significantly alter the flow\npatterns in these systems. When the buoyancy acts in the stabilizing direction,\nit limits the extent of penetration of electroconvection, but without\neliminating it. When the buoyancy destabilizes the flow, it alters the\nelectroconvective patterns by introducing upward and downward fingers of\nrespectively light and heavy fluid.\n", "  The detailed temperature dependence of the infrared-active mode in\nFe$_{1.03}$Te ($T_N\\simeq 68$ K) and Fe$_{1.13}$Te ($T_N\\simeq 56$ K) has been\nexamined, and the position, width, strength, and asymmetry parameter determined\nusing an asymmetric Fano profile superimposed on an electronic background. In\nboth materials the frequency of the mode increases as the temperature is\nreduced; however, there is also a slight asymmetry in the line shape,\nindicating that the mode is coupled to either spin or charge excitations. Below\n$T_N$ there is an anomalous decrease in frequency and the mode shows little\ntemperature dependence, at the same time becoming more symmetric, suggesting a\nreduction in spin- or electron-phonon coupling. The frequency of the\ninfrared-active mode and the magnitude of the shift below $T_N$ are predicted\nreasonably well by first-principles calculations; however, the predicted\nsplitting of the mode is not observed. In superconducting\nFeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ ($T_c\\simeq 14$ K) the infrared-active $E_u$ mode\ndisplays asymmetric line shape at all temperatures, which is most pronounced\nbetween 100 - 200 K, indicating the presence of either spin- or electron-phonon\ncoupling, which may be a necessary prerequisite for superconductivity in this\nclass of materials.\n", "  Two-reservoir thermochemical engines are established in by using\nnear-independent particles (including Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and\nBose-Einstein particles) as the working substance. Particle and heat fluxes can\nbe formed based on the temperature and chemical potential gradients between two\ndifferent reservoirs. A rectangular-type energy filter with width $\\Gamma$ is\nintroduced for each engine to weaken the coupling between the particle and heat\nfluxes. The efficiency at maximum power of each particle system decreases\nmonotonously from an upper bound $\\eta^+$ to a lower bound $\\eta^-$ when\n$\\Gamma$ increases from 0 to $\\infty$. It is found that the $\\eta^+$ values for\nall three systems are bounded by $\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}}/2 \\leq \\eta^+ \\leq\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}}/(2-\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}})$ due to strong coupling, where\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the Carnot efficiency. For the Bose-Einstein system, it\nis found that the upper bound is approximated by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency:\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{CA}}=1-\\sqrt{1-\\eta _{\\mathrm{C}}}$. When\n$\\Gamma\\rightarrow\\infty$, the intrinsic maximum powers are proportional to the\nsquare of the temperature difference of two reservoirs for all three systems,\nand the corresponding lower bounds of efficiency at maximum power can be\nsimplified in the same form of\n$\\eta^{-}=\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}}/[1+a_0(2-\\eta_{\\mathrm{C}})]$.\n", "  Measurement in quantum mechanics is generally described as an irreversible\nprocess that perturbs the wavefunction describing a quantum system. In this\nwork we establish a formal connection between the measurement description\nwithin the Copenhagen interpretation (i.e., through the collapse of the\nwavefunction) compared versus a picture in which the system and the measurement\napparatus are considered as a whole. We first consider a projective\nmeasurement. In this limiting case, the natural requirements of consistency and\nequivalence between the two pictures lead to the rigorous definition of\nconsistent measuring apparatus: the orthonormal wavefunctions from the Schmidt\ndecomposition of the system plus apparatus must have non-overlapping supports.\nThis result arises from the comparison of the two pictures (otherwise hidden),\nand while it seems to be an obvious conclusion in the limit of projective\nmeasurements, it has some nontrivial implications as one extends its validity\nto the domain of weak measurements. In this respect, we argue on the existence\nof two alternative approaches to mathematically constructing a weak measurement\nprotocol. While the two approaches are equivalent from the system's\nperspective, they do strongly differ from the apparatus point of view, and\nhence can be only distinguished one from each other in the picture where system\nand apparatus are considered as a whole. We show that only one of the two\nmathematical formulations of the weak measurement fulfills the consistent\napparatus condition, while the combination of the two gives rise to a\ngeneralized weak measurements framework.\n", "  Dynamics of atomic and molecular bright solitons in a hybrid atom-molecular\nBEC (Bose Einstein Condensate) system of 85Rb coupled through Magnetic Feshbach\nResonance (MFR) has been investigated. By solving the time independent\natom-molecular coupled equations, the initial atomic and molecular\nwavefunctions were obtained and the dynamics of the initial atomic and\nmolecular waves in a spherical one-dimensional trap were studied by solving the\ntime-dependent atom-molecular coupled equations. During evolution two types of\ninduced or stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules were switched on. These\ntwo types of stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules to the two-atom\ncontinuum and to the bound level of the lowest hyperfinee state of the molecule\nwere induced by laser or Radio Frequency fields. Hence the strength of these\ntwo induced decays can be controlled by varying the laser or RF field\nparameters e.g. intensity, detuning etc. It is found that depending on the\nrelative strength of these two types of stimulated or induced decays initial\natomic and molecular waves assume solitonic nature as bright solitons during\nevolution and the stability of these solitonic waves can be achieved by\ncontrolling the relative strength of induced decays in two different channels.\nIt is shown that these two induced decays lead to the formation of stable\natomic and molecular solitons by suppressing the initial oscillations and\ninstability in the atom-molecular coupled system of 85Rb atoms.\n", "  We have investigated the exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide\nmono-layers using time-resolved photoluminescence experiments performed with\noptimized time-resolution. For MoSe2 monolayers, we measure\n$\\tau_{rad}=1.8\\pm0.2$ ps that we interpret as the intrinsic radiative\nrecombination time. Similar values are found for WSe2 mono-layers. Our detailed\nanalysis suggests the following scenario: at low temperature (T $\\leq$ 50 K),\nthe exciton oscillator strength is so large that the entire light can be\nemitted before the time required for the establishment of a thermalized exciton\ndistribution. For higher lattice temperatures, the photoluminescence dynamics\nis characterized by two regimes with very different characteristic times. First\nthe PL intensity drops drastically with a decay time in the range of the\npicosecond driven by the escape of excitons from the radiative window due to\nexciton- phonon interactions. Following this first non-thermal regime, a\nthermalized exciton population is established gradually yielding longer\nphotoluminescence decay times in the nanosecond range. Both the exciton\neffective radiative recombination and non-radiative recombination channels\nincluding exciton-exciton annihilation control the latter. Finally the\ntemperature dependence of the measured exciton and trion dynamics indicates\nthat the two populations are not in thermodynamical equilibrium.\n", "  X-rays/EUV radiation emitted from wind-embedded shocks in hot, massive stars\ncan affect the ionization balance in their outer atmospheres, and can be the\nmechanism responsible for the production of highly ionized species. To allow\nfor these processes in the context of spectral analysis, we have implemented\nsuch emission into our unified, NLTE model atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code\nFASTWIND.\n  The shock structure and corresponding emission is calculated as a function of\nuser-supplied parameters. We account for a temperature and density\nstratification inside the post-shock cooling zones, calculated for radiative\nand adiabatic cooling in the inner and outer wind, respectively. The\nhigh-energy absorption of the cool wind is considered by adding important\nK-shell opacities, and corresponding Auger ionization rates have been included\ninto the NLTE network.\n  We tested and verified our implementation carefully against corresponding\nresults from various alternative model atmosphere codes, and studied the\neffects from shock emission for important ions from He, C, N, O, Si, and P.\nSurprisingly, dielectronic recombination turned out to play an essential role\nfor the ionization balance of OIV/OV around Teff = 45,000 K. Finally, we\ninvestigated the behavior of the mass absorption coefficient, kappa_nu(r),\nimportant in the context of X-ray line formation in massive star winds.\n  In almost all considered cases, direct ionization is of major influence, and\nAuger ionization significantly affects only NVI and OVI. The approximation of a\nradially constant kappa_nu is justified for r > 1.2 Rstar and lambda < 18 A,\nand also for many models at longer wavelengths. To estimate the actual value of\nthis quantity, however, the HeII opacities need to be calculated from detailed\nNLTE modeling, at least for wavelengths longer than 18 to 20 A, and information\non the individual CNO abundances has to be present.\n", "  An approach to QCD vacuum as a medium describable in terms of statistical\nensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon fields\nis briefly reviewed. These fields play the role of the confining medium for\ncolor charged fields as well as underline the mechanism of realization of\nchiral $SU_{\\rm L}(N_f)\\times SU_{\\rm R}(N_f)$ and $U_A(1)$ symmetries.\nHadronization formalism based on this ensemble leads to manifestly defined\nquantum effective meson action. Strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions\nof mesons are represented in the action in terms of nonlocal $n$-point\ninteraction vertices given by the quark-gluon loops averaged over the\nbackground ensemble. New systematic results for the mass spectrum and decay\nconstants of radially excited light, heavy-light mesons and heavy quarkonia are\npresented. Interrelation between the present approach, models based on ideas of\nsoft wall AdS/QCD, light front holographic QCD, and the picture of harmonic\nconfinement is outlined.\n", "  I show how elliptic genera for various Calabi-Yau threefolds may be\nunderstood from supergravity localization using the quantization of the phase\nspace of certain multi-center configurations. I present a simple procedure that\nallows for the enumeration of all multi-center configurations contributing to\nthe polar sector of the elliptic genera\\textemdash explicitly verifying this in\nthe cases of the quintic in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, the sextic in\n$\\mathbb{WP}_{(2,1,1,1,1)}$, the octic in $\\mathbb{WP}_{(4,1,1,1,1)}$ and the\ndectic in $\\mathbb{WP}_{(5,2,1,1,1)}$. With an input of the corresponding\n`single-center' indices (Donaldson-Thomas invariants), the polar terms have\nbeen known to determine the elliptic genera completely. I argue that this\nmulti-center approach to the low-lying spectrum of the elliptic genera is a\nstepping stone towards an understanding of the exact microscopic states that\ncontribute to supersymmetric single center black hole entropy in\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity.\n", "  We study the problem of estimating the Schwarzschild radius of a massive body\nusing Gaussian quantum probe states. Previous calculations assumed that the\nprobe state remained pure after propagating a large distance. In a realistic\nscenario, there would be inevitable losses. Here we introduce a practical\napproach to calculate the Quantum Fisher Informations (QFIs) for a quantum\nprobe that has passed through a lossy channel. Whilst for many situations loss\nmeans coherent states are optimal, we identify certain situations for which\nsqueezed states have an advantage. We also study the effect of the frequency\nprofile of the wavepacket propagating from Alice to Bob. There exists an\noptimal operating point for a chosen mode profile. In particular, employing a\nsmooth rectangular frequency profile significantly improves the error bound on\nthe Schwarzschild radius compared to a Gaussian frequency profile.\n", "  This paper presents measurements of $W^\\pm Z$ production in $pp$ collisions\nat a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The gauge bosons are reconstructed using\ntheir leptonic decay modes into electrons and muons. The data were collected in\n2012 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. The measured inclusive cross section\nin the detector fiducial region is $\\sigma_{W^\\pm Z \\rightarrow \\ell^{'} \\nu\\\n\\ell \\ell} = 35.1 \\pm$ 0.9 (stat.) $\\pm 0.8$ (sys.) $\\pm 0.8$ (lumi.) fb, for\none leptonic decay channel. In comparison, the next-to-leading-order Standard\nModel expectation is 30.0 $\\pm$ 2.1 fb. Cross sections for $W^+Z$ and $W^-Z$\nproduction and their ratio are presented as well as differential cross sections\nfor several kinematic observables. Limits on anomalous triple gauge boson\ncouplings are derived from the transverse mass spectrum of the $W^\\pm Z$\nsystem. From the analysis of events with a $W$ and a $Z$ boson associated with\ntwo or more forward jets an upper limit at 95% confidence level on the $W^\\pm\nZ$ scattering cross section of 0.63 fb, for each leptonic decay channel, is\nestablished, while the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading order is\n0.13 fb. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings are also extracted.\n", "  We discuss the efficiency of a heat engine operating in a nonequilibrium\nsteady state maintained by two heat reservoirs. Within the general framework of\nlinear irreversible thermodynamics we derive a universal upper bound on the\nefficiency of the engine operating at arbitrary fixed power. Furthermore, we\nshow that a slight decrease of the power below its maximal value can lead to a\nsignificant gain in efficiency. The presented analysis yields the exact\nexpression for this gain and the corresponding upper bound.\n", "  We derive supersymmetry/supergravity models with constrained orthogonal\nnilpotent superfields from the linear models in the formal limit where the\nmasses of the sgoldstino, inflatino and sinflaton tend to infinity. The case\nwhere the sinflaton mass remains finite leads to a model with a `relaxed'\nconstraint, where the sinflaton remains an independent field. Our procedure is\nequivalent to a requirement that some of the components of the curvature of the\nmoduli space tend to infinity.\n", "  The phase field crystal (PFC) approach extends the notion of phase field\nmodels by describing the topology of the microscopic structure of a crystalline\nmaterial. One of the consequences is that local variation of the interatomic\ndistance creates an elastic excitation. The dynamics of these excitations poses\na challenge: pure diffusive dynamics cannot describe relaxation of elastic\nstresses that happen through phonon emission. To this end, several different\nmodels with fast dynamics have been proposed. In this article we use the\namplitude expansion of the PFC model to compare the recently proposed\nhydrodynamic PFC amplitude model with two simpler models with fast dynamics. We\ncompare these different models analytically and numerically. The results\nsuggest that in order to have proper relaxation of elastic excitations, the\nfull hydrodynamical description of the PFC amplitudes is required.\n", "  Self-accelerating backgrounds in massive gravity provide an arena to explore\nthe Cauchy problem for derivatively coupled fields that obey complex\nconstraints which reduce the phase space degrees of freedom. We present here an\nalgorithm based on the Kronecker form of a matrix pencil that finds all hidden\nconstraints, for example those associated with derivatives of the equations of\nmotion, and characteristic curves for any 1+1 dimensional system of linear\npartial differential equations. With the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli decomposition of\nmetric perturbations into angular momentum and parity states, this technique\napplies to fully 3+1 dimensional perturbations of massive gravity around any\nisotropic self-accelerating background. Five spin modes of the massive graviton\npropagate once the constraints are imposed: two spin-2 modes with luminal\ncharacteristics present in the massless theory as well as two spin-1 modes and\none spin-0 mode. Although the new modes all possess the same - typically\nspacelike - characteristic curves, the spin-1 modes are parabolic while the\nspin-0 modes are hyperbolic. The joint system, which remains coupled by\nnon-derivative terms, cannot be solved as a simple Cauchy problem from a single\nnon-characteristic surface. We also illustrate the generality of the algorithm\nwith other cases where derivative constraints reduce the number of propagating\ndegrees of freedom or order of the equations.\n", "  Spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb materials have gained substantial interest due\nto their exotic magnetism and possible application in quantum computing.\nHowever, in all current materials out-of-plane interactions are interfering\nwith the in-plane order, hence a true 2D magnetic honeycomb system is still of\ndemand. Here, we report the exfoliation of the magnetic semiconductor\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ into the first halide monolayers and the magnetic\ncharacterization of the spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb arrangement of\nturbostratically stacked RuCl$_3$ monolayers. The exfoliation is based on a\nreductive lithiation/hydration approach, which gives rise to a loss of\ncooperative magnetism due to the disruption of the spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ state by\nelectron injection into the layers. After an oxidative treatment, cooperative\nmagnetism similar to the bulk is restored. The oxidized pellets of restacked\nsingle layers feature a magnetic transition at T$_N$ = 7 K in the in-plane\ndirection, while the magnetic properties in the out-of-plane direction vastly\ndiffer from bulk $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The macroscopic pellets of RuCl$_3$\ntherefore behave like a stack of monolayers without any symmetry relation in\nthe stacking direction. The deliberate introduction of turbostratic disorder to\nmanipulate the spin structure of RuCl$_3$ is of interest for research in\nfrustrated magnetism and complex magnetic order as predicted by the\nKitaev-Heisenberg model.\n", "  Violations of CPT invariance can induce neutrino-to-antineutrino transitions.\nWe study this effect for solar neutrinos and use the upper bound on the solar\nneutrino-to-antineutrino transition probability from the KamLAND experiment to\nconstrain CPT-symmetry-violating coefficients of the general Standard-Model\nExtension. The long propagation distance from the Sun to the Earth allows us to\nimprove existing limits by factors ranging from about a thousand to $10^{11}$.\n", "  While our current cosmological model places galaxy clusters at the nodes of a\nfilament network (the cosmic web), we still struggle to detect these filaments\nat high redshifts. We perform a weak lensing study for a sample of 16 massive,\nmedium-high redshift (0.4<z<0.9) galaxy clusters from the DAFT/FADA survey,\nthat are imaged in at least three optical bands with Subaru/Suprime-Cam or\nCFHT/MegaCam. We estimate the cluster masses using an NFW fit to the shear\nprofile measured in a KSB-like method, adding our contribution to the\ncalibration of the observable-mass relation required for cluster abundance\ncosmological studies. We compute convergence maps and select structures within,\nsecuring their detection with noise re-sampling techniques. Taking advantage of\nthe large field of view of our data, we study cluster environment, adding\ninformation from galaxy density maps at the cluster redshift and from X-ray\nimages when available. We find that clusters show a large variety of weak\nlensing maps at large scales and that they may all be embedded in filamentary\nstructures at megaparsec scale. We classify them in three categories according\nto the smoothness of their weak lensing contours and to the amount of\nsubstructures: relaxed (~7%), past mergers (~21.5%), recent or present mergers\n(~71.5%). The fraction of clusters undergoing merging events observationally\nsupports the hierarchical scenario of cluster growth, and implies that massive\nclusters are strongly evolving at the studied redshifts. Finally, we report the\ndetection of unusually elongated structures in CLJ0152, MACSJ0454, MACSJ0717,\nA851, BMW1226, MACSJ1621, and MS1621.\n", "  The star HR 8799 hosts one of the largest known debris discs and at least\nfour giant planets. Previous observations have found evidence for a warm belt\nwithin the orbits of the planets, a cold planetesimal belt beyond their orbits\nand a halo of small grains. With the infrared data, it is hard to distinguish\nthe planetesimal belt emission from that of the grains in the halo. With this\nin mind, the system has been observed with ALMA in band 6 (1.34 mm) using a\ncompact array format. These observations allow the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal belt to be resolved for the first time. A radial distribution of\ndust grains is fitted to the data using an MCMC method. The disc is best fit by\na broad ring between $145^{+12}_{-12}$ AU and $429^{+37}_{-32}$ AU at an\ninclination of $40^{+5}_{-6}${\\deg} and a position angle of\n$51^{+8}_{-8}${\\deg}. A disc edge at ~145 AU is too far out to be explained\nsimply by interactions with planet b, requiring either a more complicated\ndynamical history or an extra planet beyond the orbit of planet b.\n", "  Even though it has been known for decades that the magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy is linked to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the mechanism how it\narises for specific systems is still subject of debate. We focused on finding\nmarkers of SOC in the density of states (DOS) and on employing them for\nunderstanding the source of magnetocrystalline anisotropy for the case of\nadatoms and monolayers. Fully relativistic ab-initio KKR-Green function\ncalculations were performed for Fe, Co, and Ni adatoms and monolayers on\nAu(111) to investigate changes in the orbital-resolved DOS due to a rotation of\nmagnetization. In this way one can see that a significant contribution to the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy for adatoms comes from pushing of the SOC-split\nstates above or below the Fermi level. As a result of this, the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy energy crucially depends on the position of the\nenergy bands of the adatom with respect to the Fermi level of the substrate.\nThis view is supported by model crystal field Hamiltonian calculations.\n", "  We examine the distribution of the [O/Fe] abundance ratio in stars across the\nGalactic disk using H-band spectra from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution\nExperiment (APOGEE). We minimize systematic errors by considering groups of\nstars with similar atmospheric parameters. The APOGEE measurements in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 12 reveal that the square root of the\nstar-to-star cosmic variance in the oxygen-to-iron ratio at a given metallicity\nis about 0.03-0.04 dex in both the thin and thick disk. This is about twice as\nhigh as the spread found for solar twins in the immediate solar neighborhood\nand the difference is probably associated to the wider range of galactocentric\ndistances spanned by APOGEE stars. We quantify the uncertainties by examining\nthe spread among stars with the same parameters in clusters; these errors are a\nfunction of effective temperature and metallicity, ranging between 0.005 dex at\n4000 K and solar metallicity, to about 0.03 dex at 4500 K and [Fe/H]= -0.6. We\nargue that measuring the spread in [O/Fe] and other abundance ratios provides\nstrong constraints for models of Galactic chemical evolution.\n", "  We observed high S/N, high velocity resolution NH$_3$(1,1) and (2,2) emission\non an extended map in TMC-1, a filamentary cloud in a nearby quiescent star\nforming area. By fitting multiple hyperfine-split line profiles to the\nNH$_3$(1,1) spectra we derived the velocity distribution of the line components\nand calculated gas parameters on several positions. Herschel SPIRE continuum\nobservations were reduced and used to calculate the physical parameters of the\nPlanck Galactic Cold Clumps in the region. The Herschel-based column density\nmap of TMC-1 shows a main ridge with two local maxima and a separated peak to\nthe south-west. H$_2$-column densities and dust temperatures are in the range\nof 0.5-3.3 $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 10.5-12 K, respectively.\nNH$_3$-column densities are 2.8-14.2 $\\times$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and and\nH$_2$-volume densities are 0.4-2.8 $\\times$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. Kinetic\ntemperatures are typically very low with a minimum of 9 K, and a maximum of\n13.7 K was found at the Class I protostar IRAS 04381+2540. The kinetic\ntemperatures vary similarly as the dust temperatures in spite of the fact that\ndensities are lower than the critical density for coupling between the gas and\ndust phase. The k-means clustering method separated four sub-filaments in TMC-1\nin the position-velocity-column density parameter space. They have masses of\n32.5, 19.6, 28.9 and 45.9 M$_{\\odot}$, low turbulent velocity dispersion\n(0.13-0.2 kms$^{-1}$) and they are close to gravitational equilibrium. We label\nthem TMC-1F1 through F4. TMC-1F1, TMC-1F2 and TMC-1F4 are very elongated, dense\nand cold. TMC-1F3 is a little less elongated and somewhat warmer, probably\nheated by IRAS 04381+2540 that is embedded in it. TMC-1F3 is $\\approx$ 0.1 pc\nbehind TMC1-F1. Because of its structure, TMC-1 is a good target to test\nfilament evolution scenarios.\n", "  Two scenarios for cluster production have since long been discussed in the\nliterature: i) direct emission of the clusters from a (grand canonical) thermal\nsource or ii) subsequent formation of the clusters by coalescence of single\nnucleons. While both approaches have been successfully applied in the past it\nhas not yet been clarified which of the two mechanisms dominates the cluster\nproduction. We propose to use recently developed event-by-event techniques to\nstudy particle multiplicity fluctuations on nuclear clusters and employ this\nanalysis to the deuteron number fluctuations to disentangle the two production\nmechanisms. We argue that for a grand canonical cluster formation, the cluster\nfluctuations will follow Poisson distribution, while for the coalescence\nscenario, the fluctuations will strongly deviate from the Poisson expectation.\nWe estimate the effect to be 10% for the variance and up to a factor of 5 for\nthe kurtosis of the deuteron number multiplicity distribution. Our prediction\ncan be tested in the beam energy scan program at RHIC as well as experiments at\nthe FAIR and NICA facilities.\n", "  When impacted by a rigid object, a thin elastic membrane with negligible\nbending rigidity floating on a liquid pool deforms. Two axisymmetric waves\nradiating from the impact point propagate. In the first place, a longitudinal\nwave front -- associated with in-plane deformation of the membrane and\ntraveling at constant speed -- separates an outward stress free domain with a\nstretched but flat domain. Then, in the stretched domain a dispersive\ntransverse wave travels at a wave speed that depends on the local stretching\nrate. We study the dynamics of this fluid-body system and we show that the wave\ndynamics is similar to the capillary waves that propagate at a liquid-gas\ninterface but with a surface tension coefficient that depends on impact speed.\nWe emphasize the role of the stretching in the membrane in the wave dynamics\nbut also in the development of a buckling instability that give rise to radial\nwrinkles.\n", "  We study the $I$-$V$ characteristics of S$_{\\text{T}}$/n/N contacts, where\nS$_{\\text{T}}$ is a BCS superconductor S with a built-in exchange field $h$, n\nrepresents a normal metal wire, and N---a normal metal reservoir. The\nsuperconductor S$_{\\text{T}}$ is separated from the n-wire by a spin filter\nwhich allows the passage of electrons with a certain spin direction so that\nonly fully polarized triplet Cooper pairs penetrate into the n-wire. We show\nthat both the subgap conductance $\\sigma_{\\text{sg}}$ and the excess current\n$I_{\\text{exc}}$, which occur in conventional S/n/N contacts due to Andreev\nreflection (AR), exist also in the considered system. In our case, they are\ncaused by unconventional AR that is not accompanied by spin flip. The excess\ncurrent $I_{\\text{exc}}$ exists only if $h$ exceeds a certain magnitude\n$h_{\\text{c}}$. At ${h < h_{\\text{c}}}$ the excess current is converted into a\ndeficit current $I_\\text{{def}}$. The dependencies of the differential\nconductance and the current $I_{\\text{exc}}$ are presented as a function of\nvoltage and $h$.\n", "  We propose a new interpretation of the neutral and charged X, Z exotic hadron\nresonances. Hybridized-tetraquarks are neither purely compact tetraquark states\nnor bound or loosely bound molecules. The latter would require a negative or\nzero binding energy whose counterpart in h-tetraquarks is a positive quantity.\nThe formation mechanism of this new class of hadrons is inspired by that of\nFeshbach metastable states in atomic physics. The recent claim of an exotic\nresonance in the Bs pi+- channel by the D0 collaboration and the negative\nresult presented subsequently by the LHCb collaboration are understood in this\nscheme, together with a considerable portion of available data on X, Z\nparticles. Considerations on a state with the same quantum numbers as the\nX(5568) are also made.\n", "  We consider a Hamiltonian formulation of the (2n+1)-order generalization of\nthe Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator with distinct frequencies of oscillation. This\nsystem is invariant under time translations. However, the corresponding Noether\nintegral of motion is unbounded from below and can be presented as a direct sum\nof 2n one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with an alternating sign. If this\nintegral of motion plays a role of a Hamiltonian, a quantum theory of the\nPais-Uhlenbeck oscillator faces a ghost problem. We construct an alternative\ncanonical formulation for the system under study to avoid this nasty feature.\n", "  We investigate the fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation with a periodic\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potential. In the inverse space, the problem transfers\ninto a first-order nonlocal frequency-delay partial differential equation. We\nshow that at a critical point, the band structure becomes linear and symmetric\nin the one-dimensional case, which results in a nondiffracting propagation and\nconical diffraction of input beams. If only one channel in the periodic\npotential is excited, adjacent channels become uniformly excited along the\npropagation direction, which can be used to generate laser beams of high power\nand narrow width. In the two-dimensional case, there appears conical\ndiffraction that depends on the competition between the fractional Laplacian\noperator and the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potential. This investigation may\nfind applications in novel on-chip optical devices.\n", "  In this paper, we present an electrode geometry for the manipulation of\nultracold rovibrational ground state NaK molecules. The electrode system allows\nto induce a dipole moment in trapped diatomic NaK molecules with a magnitude up\nto $68 \\%$ of their internal dipole moment along any direction in a given\ntwo-dimensional plane. The strength, the sign and the direction of the induced\ndipole moment is therefore fully tunable. Furthermore, the possibility to\ncreate strong electric field gradients provides the opportunity to address\nmolecules in single layers of an optical lattice. The maximal relative\nvariation of the electric field over the trapping volume is below $10^{-6}$. At\nthe desired electric field value of 10 kV/cm this corresponds to a deviation of\n0.01 V/cm. The electrode structure is made of transparent indium tin oxide and\ncombines large optical access for sophisticated optical dipole traps and\noptical lattice configurations with the possibility to create versatile\nelectric field configurations.\n", "  We discuss the possibility that production of final states with bottomonium\nand light mesons at the peak $\\Upsilon(6S)$ in the $e^+e^-$ annihilation at\napproximately 11.00 GeV is in fact due to a triangular singularity at the\nthreshold of the heavy meson pair production $B_1(5721) \\bar B + c.c.$ through\nthe process $e^+e^- \\to B_1(5721) \\bar B \\to Z_b(10610) \\, \\pi$. The presence\nof the hidden-bottom resonance $Z_b(10610)$ then explains the observed enhanced\nproduction of the final channels with both ortho- and para- bottomonium states,\n$\\Upsilon(nS) \\pi \\pi$ and $h_b(kP) \\pi \\pi$. The discussed mechanism also\npredicts a distinct pattern for production of hidden-bottom states at the\n$\\Upsilon(6S)$ energy that can be tested by experiment.\n", "  We introduce a distinct method to perform spatially-resolved spectral\nanalysis of astronomical sources with highly structured X-ray emission. The\nmethod measures the surface brightness of neighbouring pixels to adaptively\nsize and shape each region, thus the spectra from the bright and faint\nfilamentary structures evident in the broadband images can be extracted. As a\ntest case, we present the spectral analysis of the complete X-ray emitting\nplasma in the supernova remnant Puppis A observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra.\nGiven the angular size of Puppis A, many pointings with different observational\nconfigurations have to be combined, presenting a challenge to any method of\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy. From the fit of a plane-parallel shocked\nplasma model we find that temperature, absorption column, ionization time\nscale, emission measure and elemental abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S and Fe,\nare smoothly distributed in the remnant. Some regions with overabundances of\nO-Ne-Mg, previously characterized as ejecta material, were automatically\nselected by our method, proving the excellent response of the technique. This\nmethod is an advantageous tool for the exploitation of archival X-ray data.\n", "  Transmission spectroscopy can be used to constrain the properties of\nexoplanetary atmospheres. During a transit, the light blocked from the\natmosphere of the planet leaves an imprint in the light coming from the star.\nThis has been shown for many exoplanets with different techniques, with both\nphotometry and spectroscopy. We aim at testing chromatic line-profile\ntomography as a new tool to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres. The signal\nimprinted on the cross-correlation function (CCF) by a planet transiting its\nstar is dependent on the planet-to-star radius ratio. We want to verify if the\nprecision reachable on the CCF obtained from a subset of the spectral orders of\nthe HARPS spectrograph is enough to discriminate the radius of a planet at\ndifferent wavelengths. Methods. We analyze HARPS archival data of three\ntransits of HD 189733b. We divide the HARPS spectral range in 7 broadbands,\ncalculating for each band the ratio between the area of the out-of-transit CCF\nand the area of the signal imprinted by the planet on it during the full part\nof the transit. We take into account the effect of the limb darkening using the\ntheoretical coefficients of a linear law. Averaging the results of three\ndifferent transits allows us to obtain a good quality broadband transmission\nspectrum of HD 189733b, with a precision greater than that of the chromatic RM\neffect. Results. We proved chromatic line-profile tomography to be an\ninteresting way to reveal broadband transmission spectra of exoplanets: our\nanalysis of the atmosphere of HD 189733b is in agreement with other ground- and\nspace-based observations. The independent analysis of different transits puts\nin evidence the probability that stellar activity plays a role in the extracted\ntransmission spectrum. Care has thus to be taken when claiming for Rayleigh\nscattering in the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting active stars using only one\ntransit.\n", "  For steady-state and some other types of mechanical waves of an arbitrary\nform, intensity and nature, propagating in a free uniform waveguide, we present\nthe following. Relations for the axial momentum as it directly follows from the\nconservation laws. The mass associated with the wave. The connection between\nthe wave energy and momentum. The structure of a binary wave which possesses a\nself-equilibrated momentum, in particular, a transverse-longitudinal wave\nformed upon excitation of flexural waves. Conditions under which longitudinal\nsinusoidal waves can carry momentum and the physical meaning of the so-called\n\"wave momentum\".\n", "  Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we\nhave studied the mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties of Heusler\nalloys, namely, Ni$_{2}BC$ and Co$_{2}BC$ ($B$ = Sc, Ti, V, Cr and Mn as well\nas Y, Zr, Nb, Mo and Tc; $C$ = Ga and Sn). On the basis of electronic structure\n(density of states) and mechanical properties (tetragonal shear constant), as\nwell as magnetic interactions (Heisenberg exchange coupling parameters), we\nprobe the properties of these materials in detail. We calculate the formation\nenergy of these alloys in the (face-centered) cubic austenite structure to\nprobe the stability of all these materials. From the energetic point of view,\nwe have studied the possibility of the electronically stable alloys having a\ntetragonal phase lower in energy compared to the respective cubic phase. A\nlarge number of the magnetic alloys is found to have the cubic phase as their\nground state. On the other hand, for another class of alloys, the tetragonal\nphase has been found to have lower energy compared to the cubic phase. Further,\nwe find that the values of tetragonal shear constant show a consistent trend :\na high positive value for materials not prone to tetragonal transition and low\nor negative for others. In the literature, materials, which have been seen to\nundergo the martensite transition, are found to be metallic in nature. We probe\nhere if there is any Heusler alloy which has a tendency to undergo a tetragonal\ntransition and at the same time possesses a high spin polarization at the Fermi\nlevel. From our study, it is found that out of the four materials, which\nexhibit a martensite phase as their ground state, three of these, namely,\nNi$_{2}$MnGa, Ni$_{2}$MoGa and Co$_{2}$NbSn have a metallic nature; on the\ncontrary, Co$_{2}$MoGa exhibits a high spin polarization.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the Flambaum-Ginges radiative potential method\nwhich enables the accurate inclusion of quantum electrodynamics (QED) radiative\ncorrections in a simple manner in atoms, ions, and molecules over the range\n10<=Z<=120, where Z is the nuclear charge. Calculations are performed for\nbinding energy shifts to the lowest valence s, p, and d waves over the series\nof alkali atoms Na to E119. The high accuracy of the radiative potential method\nis demonstrated by comparison with rigorous QED calculations in frozen atomic\npotentials, with deviations on the level of 1%. The many-body effects of core\nrelaxation and second- and higher-order perturbation theory on the interaction\nof the valence electron with the core are calculated. The inclusion of\nmany-body effects tends to increase the size of the shifts, with the\nenhancement particularly significant for d waves; for K to E119, the\nself-energy shifts for d waves are only an order of magnitude smaller than the\ns-wave shifts. It is shown that account of many-body effects is essential for\nan accurate description of the Lamb shift.\n", "  We investigated regular black holes with fuzzy sources in three and four\ndimensions. The density distributions of such fuzzy sources are inspired by\nnoncommutative geometry and given by Gaussian or generalized Gaussian\nfunctions. We utilized mass functions to give a physical interpretation of the\nhorizon formation condition for the black holes. In particular, we investigated\nthree-dimensional BTZ-like black holes and four-dimensional Schwarzschild-like\nblack holes in detail, and found that the number of horizons is related to the\nspacetime dimensions, and the existence of a void in the vicinity of the center\nof the spacetime is significant, rather than noncommutativity. As an\napplication, we considered a three-dimensional black hole with the fuzzy disc\nwhich is a disc-shaped region known in the context of noncommutative geometry\nas a source. We also analyzed a four-dimensional black hole with a source whose\ndensity distribution is an extension of the fuzzy disc, and investigated the\nhorizon formation condition for it.\n", "  The diffusion of macromolecules in cells and in complex fluids is often found\nto deviate from simple Fickian diffusion. One explanation offered for this\nbehavior is that molecular crowding renders diffusion anomalous, where the\nmean-squared displacement of the particles scales as $\\langle r^2 \\rangle\n\\propto t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha < 1$. Unfortunately, methods such as\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) or fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP) probe diffusion only over a narrow range of lengthscales\nand cannot directly test the dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD)\non time. Here we show that variable-lengthscale FCS (VLS-FCS), where the volume\nof observation is varied over several orders of magnitude, combined with a\nnumerical inversion procedure of the correlation data, allows retrieving the\nMSD for up to five decades in time, bridging the gap between diffusion\nexperiments performed at different lengthscales. In addition, we show that\nVLS-FCS provides a way to assess whether the propagator associated with the\ndiffusion is Gaussian or non-Gaussian. We used VLS-FCS to investigate two\nsystems where anomalous diffusion had been previously reported. In the case of\ndense cross-linked agarose gels, the measured MSD confirmed that the diffusion\nof small beads was anomalous at short lengthscales, with a cross-over to simple\ndiffusion around $\\approx 1~\\mu$m, consistent with a caged diffusion process.\nOn the other hand, for solutions crowded with marginally entangled dextran\nmolecules, we uncovered an apparent discrepancy between the MSD, found to be\nlinear, and the propagators at short lengthscales, found to be non-Gaussian.\nThese contradicting features call to mind the \"anomalous, yet Brownian\"\ndiffusion observed in several biological systems, and the recently proposed\n\"diffusing diffusivity\" model.\n", "  Deviations of the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the\nstandard model, known as \"anomalies\", are obviously highly significant and\ndeserve to be pursued more aggressively in order to discover the physical\nphenomena underlying them. Through intensive investigation we have discovered\nthat there are equally surprising features in the digits of the number $\\pi$,\nand moreover there is a remarkable correspondence between each type of\npeculiarity in the digits of $\\pi$ and the anomalies in the CMB. Putting aside\nthe unreasonable possibility that these are just the sort of flukes that appear\nwhen one looks hard enough, the only conceivable conclusion is that, however\nthe CMB anomalies were created, a similar process imprinted patterns in the\ndigits of $\\pi$.\n", "  We study the X-ray absorption of a complete sample of 99 bright Swift\ngamma-ray bursts. Over the last few years, a strong correlation between the\nintrinsic X-ray absorbing column density (N_H(z)) and the redshift was found.\nThis absorption excess in high-z GRBs is now thought to be due to the\noverlooked contribution of the absorption along the intergalactic medium, by\nmeans of both intervening objects and the diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium\nalong the line of sight. In this work we neglect the absorption along the IGM,\nbecause our purpose is to study the eventual effect of a radical change in the\nGalactic absorption model on the N_H(z) distribution. Therefore, we derive the\nintrinsic absorbing column densities using two different Galactic absorption\nmodels, the Leiden Argentine Bonn HI survey and the more recent model including\nmolecular hydrogen. We find that, if on the one hand the new Galactic model\nconsiderably affects the single column density values, on the other hand there\nis no drastic change in the distribution as a whole. It becomes clear that the\ncontribution of Galactic column densities alone, no matter how improved, is not\nsufficient to change the observed general trend and it has to be considered as\na second-order correction. The cosmological increase of N_H(z) as a function of\nredshift persists and, in order to explain the observed distribution, it is\nnecessary to include the contribution of both the diffuse intergalactic medium\nand the intervening systems along the line of sight of the GRBs.\n", "  Context. Remote sensing of weak and small-scale solar magnetic fields is of\nutmost relevance for a number of important open questions in solar physics.\nThis requires the acquisition of spectropolarimetric data with high spatial\nresolution (0.1 arcsec) and low noise (1e-3 to 1e-5 of the continuum\nintensity). The main limitations to obtain these measurements from the ground,\nare the degradation of the image resolution produced by atmospheric seeing and\nthe seeing-induced crosstalk (SIC). Aims. We introduce the prototype of the\nFast Solar Polarimeter (FSP), a new ground-based, high-cadence polarimeter that\ntackles the above-mentioned limitations by producing data that are optimally\nsuited for the application of post-facto image restoration, and by operating at\na modulation frequency of 100 Hz to reduce SIC. Results. The pnCCD camera\nreaches 400 fps while keeping a high duty cycle (98.6 %) and very low noise\n(4.94 erms). The modulator is optimized to have high (> 80%) total polarimetric\nefficiency in the visible spectral range. This allows FSP to acquire 100\nphoton-noise-limited, full-Stokes measurements per second. We found that the\nseeing induced signals present in narrow-band, non-modulated, quiet-sun\nmeasurements are (a) lower than the noise (7e-5) after integrating 7.66 min,\n(b) lower than the noise (2.3e-4) after integrating 1.16 min and (c) slightly\nabove the noise (4e-3) after restoring case (b) by means of a multi-object\nmulti-frame blind deconvolution. In addition, we demonstrate that by using only\nnarrow-band images (with low SNR of 13.9) of an active region, we can obtain\none complete set of high-quality restored measurements about every 2 s.\n", "  We study the spectral functions, the poles and their trajectories for\nincreasing $N_{c}$ of the vector kaon state $K^{\\ast}(892),$ characterized by\n$I(J^{P})=\\frac{1}{2}(1^{-})$, and of the scalar kaons $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$ and\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430),$ characterized by $I(J^{P})=\\frac{1}{2}(0^{+})$. To this\nend, we use relativistic QFT's Lagrangians with both derivative and\nnon-derivative terms. In the vector kaonic sector the spectral function is well\napproximated by a Breit-Wigner function: there is one single peak and,\ncorrespondingly, a single pole in the complex plane. On the contrary, in the\nscalar sector, although the Lagrangian contains only one scalar kaonic field,\nwe find two poles, one corresponding to a standard quark-antiquark\n,,seed\\textquotedblright\\ state $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430),$ and one to a\n\\textquotedblleft companion\\textquotedblright\\ dynamically generate pole\n$K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$. The latter does not correspond to any peak in the scalar\nkaonic spectral function, but only to an enhancement in the low-energy regime.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the MSSM extended with one vector-like lepton\ndoublets $L$-$\\overline{L}$ and one right-handed neutrino $N$. The neutral\nvecotor-like sneutrino can be a candidate of dark matter. In order to avoid the\ninteraction with the necleons by exchanging a $Z$-boson, the mass splitting\nbetween the real part and the imaginary part of the sneutrino field is needed.\nCompared with the MSSM sneutrino dark matter, the mass splitting between the\nvector-like sneutrino field can be more naturally acquired without large\nA-terms and constraints on the neutralino masses. We have also calculated the\nrelic density and the elastic scattering cross sections with the neucleons in\nthe cases that the dark matter particles coannihilate with or without the MSSM\nslepton doublets. The elastic scattering cross sections with the neucleons are\nwell below the LUX bounds. In the case that the dark matter coannihilate with\nall the MSSM slepton doublets, the mass of the dark matter can be as light as\n370 GeV.\n", "  PG1247+267 is one of the most luminous known quasars at $z\\sim2$ and is a\nstrongly super-Eddington accreting SMBH candidate. We obtained NuSTAR data of\nthis intriguing source in December 2014 with the aim of studying its\nhigh-energy emission, leveraging the broad band covered by the new NuSTAR and\nthe archival XMM-Newton data. Several measurements are in agreement with the\nsuper-Eddington scenario for PG1247+267: the soft power law\n($\\Gamma=2.3\\pm0.1$); the weak ionized Fe emission line and a hint of the\npresence of outflowing ionized gas surrounding the SMBH. The presence of an\nextreme reflection component is instead at odds with the high accretion rate\nproposed for this quasar. This can be explained with three different scenarios;\nall of them are in good agreement with the existing data, but imply very\ndifferent conclusions: i) a variable primary power law observed in a low state,\nsuperimposed on a reflection component echoing a past, higher flux state; ii) a\npower law continuum obscured by an ionized, Compton thick, partial covering\nabsorber; and iii) a relativistic disk reflector in a lamp-post geometry, with\nlow coronal height and high BH spin. The first model is able to explain the\nhigh reflection component in terms of variability. The second does not require\nany reflection to reproduce the hard emission, while a rather low high-energy\ncutoff of $\\sim100$ keV is detected for the first time in such a high redshift\nsource. The third model require a face-on geometry, which may affect the SMBH\nmass and Eddington ratio measurements. Deeper X-ray broad-band data are\nrequired in order to distinguish between these possibilities.\n", "  Context: The LIGO consortium announced the first direct detection of\ngravitation wave event GW150914 from two merging black holes; however the\nnature of the black holes are still not clear.\n  Aims: We study whether electromagnetic radiation can be detected from merging\nstellar mass black binaries like GW150914.\n  Methods: We briefly investigate the possible growth and merging processes of\nthe two stellar mass black holes in the merging event of GW150914 detected by\naLIGO, as clocked by a distant external observer.\n  Our main results are: (1) The description of the black hole growth using\nstationary metric of a pre-existing black hole predicts strong electromagnetic\nradiation from merging black holes, which is inconsistent with GW150914; (2)\nOnly gravitational wave radiation can be produced in the coalescence of two\nblack holes such as that in the GW150914 event, if the black hole growth is\ndescribed using time-dependent metric considering the influence of the\nin-falling matter onto a pre-existing black hole, as clocked by a distant\nexternal observer.\n  Conclusions: Future high sensitivity detections of gravitational waves from\nmerging black holes might be used to probe matter distribution and space-time\ngeometry in the vicinity of the horizon. Perhaps the GW150914-like events can\nbe identified with traditional astronomy observations only if the black holes\nare embedded in extremely dense medium before their final merge, when very\nstrong electromagnetic radiation is produced and can escape from the system.\n", "  Precious metal alloys enables new possibilities to tailor materials for\nspecific optical functions. Here we present a systematic study of the effects\nof a nanoscale alloying on the permittivity of Au-Ag-Cu metals at 38 different\natomic mixing ratios. The permittivity was measured and analyzed numerically by\napplying the Drude model. X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the face centered\ncubic lattice of the alloys. Both, optical spectra and XRD results point\ntowards an equivalent composition-dependent electron scattering behavior.\nCorrelation between the fundamental structural parameters of alloys and the\nresulting optical properties is elucidated. Plasmonic properties of the\nAu-Ag-Cu alloy nanoparticles were investigated by numerical simulations.\nGuidelines for designing plasmonic response of nano- structures and their\npatterns are presented from the material science perspective.\n", "  We investigate the modeling capabilities of sets of coupled classical\nharmonic oscillators (CHO) in the form of a modeling game. The application of\nsimple but restrictive rules of the game lead to conditions for an isomorphism\nbetween Lie-algebras and real Clifford algebras. We show that the correlations\nbetween two coupled classical oscillators find their natural description in the\nDirac algebra and allow to model aspects of special relativity, inertial\nmotion, electromagnetism and quantum phenomena including spin in one go. The\nalgebraic properties of Hamiltonian motion of low-dimensional systems can\ngenerally be related to certain types of interactions and hence to the\ndimensionality of emergent space-times. We describe the intrinsic connection\nbetween phase space volumes of a 2-dimensional oscillator and the Dirac\nalgebra. In this version of a phase space interpretation of quantum mechanics\nthe (components of the) spinor wave-function in momentum space are abstract\ncanonical coordinates, and the integrals over the squared wave function\nrepresents second moments in phase space. The wave function in ordinary\nspace-time can be obtained via Fourier transformation. Within this modeling\ngame, 3+1-dimensional space-time is interpreted as a structural property of\nelectromagnetic interaction. A generalization selects a series of Clifford\nalgebras of specific dimensions with similar properties, specifically also 10-\nand 26-dimensional real Clifford algebras.\n", "  Experiments are conducted in a two-dimensional mono-layer vibrofluidized bed\nof glass beads, with a goal to understand the transition scenario and the\nunderlying microstructure and dynamics in different patterned-states. At small\nshaking accelerations ($\\Gamma=A\\omega^2/g <1$), the particles remain attached\nwith the base of the vibrating container -- this is known as the solid bed\n(SB). With increasing $\\Gamma$ (at large enough shaking amplitude $A/d$) and/or\nwith increasing $A/d$ (at large enough $\\Gamma$), the sequence of\ntransitions/bifurcations unfolds as follows: SB to BB (\"bouncing bed\") to LS\n(\"Leidenfrost state\") to \"2-roll Convection\" to \"1-roll Convection\" and finally\nto a gas-like state. For a given length of the container, the coarsening of\nmultiple convection rolls leading to the genesis of a \"single-roll\" structure\n(dubbed the {\\it multi-roll transition}), and its subsequent transition to a\ngranular-gas are two novel findings of this work. We show that the critical\nshaking intensity ($\\Gamma_{BB}^{LS}$) for \"$BB\\to LS$\"-transition has a\npower-law dependence on the particle loading ($F=h_0/d$, where $h_0$ is the\nnumber of particle layers at rest and $d$ is the particle diameter) and the\nshaking amplitude ($A/d$). The characteristics of $BB$ and $LS$ states are\nstudied by calculating (i) the coarse-grained density and temperature profiles\nand (ii) the pair correlation function. It is shown that while the contact\nnetwork of particles in the BB represents a hexagonal-packed structure, the\ncontact network within the LS resembles a liquid-like state. An unsteadiness of\nthe LS has been uncovered wherein the interface (between the floating-cluster\nand the dilute gas underneath) and the top of the bed are found to oscillate\nsinusoidally, with its oscillation frequency closely matching with the\nfrequency of external shaking.\n", "  Computations of the breakup of a liquid bridge are used to establish the\nlimits of applicability of similarity solutions derived for different breakup\nregimes. These regimes are based on particular viscous-inertial balances, that\nis different limits of the Ohnesorge number $Oh$. To accurately establish the\ntransitions between regimes, the minimum bridge radius is resolved through four\norders of magnitude using a purpose-built multiscale finite element method.\nThis allows us to construct a quantitative phase diagram for the breakup\nphenomenon which includes the appearance of a recently discovered low-$Oh$\nviscous regime. The method used to quantify the accuracy of the similarity\nsolutions allows us to identify a number of previously unobserved features of\nthe breakup, most notably an oscillatory convergence towards the\nviscous-inertial similarity solution. Finally, we discuss how the new findings\nopen up a number of challenges for both theoretical and experimental analysis.\n", "  We explore the possibility that a single relativistic shock, where the gas\ndynamics is coupled with radiation, can fit the light curves of long GRBs. For\nthis we numerically solve the one dimensional relativistic radiation\nhydrodynamics equations with a single initial shock. We calculate light curves\ndue to the evolution of this shock in terms of the velocity of the shock, the\nopacity of the gas, mass density and density of radiated energy. We explore how\nthe variation of each of these parameters provides different features in the\nlight curves. As examples we include the fitting of two long GRBs.\n", "  We want to understand what drives magnetospheric dissipation in the\nequatorial current sheet. Numerical simulations have limitations and, unless we\nhave a clear a priori understanding of the physical processes involved, their\nresults can be misleading. We argue that the canonical pulsar magnetosphere is\nstrongly dissipative and that a large fraction (up to 30-40% in an aligned\nrotator) of the spindown luminosity is redirected towards the equator where it\nis dissipated into particle acceleration and emission of radiation. We show\nthat this is due to the failure of the equatorial electric current to cross the\nY-point at the tip of the corotating zone.\n", "  We consider the free boundary problem for the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum\ninterface in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In the plasma\nregion, the flow is governed by the usual compressible MHD equations, while in\nthe vacuum region we consider the Maxwell system for the electric and the\nmagnetic fields. At the free interface, driven by the plasma velocity, the\ntotal pressure is continuous and the magnetic field on both sides is tangent to\nthe boundary.\n  We study the linear stability of rectilinear plasma-vacuum interfaces by\ncomputing the Kreiss-Lopatinskii determinant of an associated linearized\nboundary value problem. Apart from possible resonances, we obtain that the\npiecewise constant plasma-vacuum interfaces are always weakly linearly stable,\nindependently of the size of tangential velocity, magnetic and electric fields\non both sides of the characteristic discontinuity.\n  We also prove that solutions to the linearized problem obey an energy\nestimate with a loss of regularity with respect to the source terms, both in\nthe interior domain and on the boundary, due to the failure of the uniform\nKreiss-Lopatinskii condition, as the Kreiss-Lopatinskii determinant associated\nwith this linearized boundary value problem has roots on the boundary of the\nfrequency space. In the proof of the a priori estimates, a crucial part is\nplayed by the construction of symmetrizers for a reduced differential system,\nwhich has poles at which the Kreiss-Lopatinskii condition may fail\nsimultaneously.\n", "  Brillouin microscopy has recently emerged as powerful technique to\ncharacterize the mechanical properties of biological tissue, cell and\nbiomaterials. However, the potential of Brillouin microscopy is currently\nlimited to transparent samples, because Brillouin spectrometers do not have\nsufficient spectral extinction to reject the predominant non-Brillouin\nscattered light of turbid media. To overcome this issue, we developed a\nspectrometer composed of a two VIPA stages and a multi-pass Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer. The Fabry-Perot etalon acts as an ultra-narrow band-pass filter\nfor Brillouin light with high spectral extinction and low loss. We report\nbackground-free Brillouin spectra from Intralipid solutions and up to 100\nmicrons deep within chicken muscle tissue.\n", "  Upon combining Northrop's picture of charged particle motion with modern\nliquid crystal theories, this paper provides a new description of guiding\ncenter dynamics (to lowest order). This new perspective is based on a rotation\ngauge field (gyrogauge) that encodes rotations around the magnetic field. In\nliquid crystal theory, an analogue rotation field is used to encode the\nrotational state of rod-like molecules. Instead of resorting to sophisticated\ntools (e.g. Hamiltonian perturbation theory and Lie series expansions) that\nstill remain essential in higher-order gyrokinetics, the present approach\ncombines the WKB method with a simple kinematical ansatz, which is then\nreplaced into the charged particle Lagrangian. The latter is eventually\naveraged over the gyrophase to produce Littlejohn's guiding-center equations. A\ncrucial role is played by the vector potential for the gyrogauge field. A\nsimilar vector potential is related to liquid crystal defects and is known as\n`wryness tensor' in Eringen's micropolar theory.\n", "  To get insight into the mechanism of emergence of unconventional quantum\ncriticality observed in quasicrystal Yb$_{15}$Al$_{34}$Au$_{51}$, the\napproximant crystal Yb$_{14}$Al$_{35}$Au$_{51}$ is analyzed theoretically. By\nconstructing a minimal model for the approximant crystal, the heavy\nquasiparticle band is shown to emerge near the Fermi level because of strong\ncorrelation of 4f electrons at Yb. We find that charge-transfer mode between 4f\nelectron at Yb on the 3rd shell and 3p electron at Al on the 4th shell in\nTsai-type cluster is considerably enhanced with almost flat momentum\ndependence. The mode-coupling theory shows that magnetic as well as valence\nsusceptibility exhibits $\\chi\\sim T^{-0.5}$ for zero-field limit and is\nexpressed as a single scaling function of the ratio of temperature to magnetic\nfield $T/B$ over four decades even in the approximant crystal when some\ncondition is satisfied by varying parameters, e.g., by applying pressure. The\nkey origin is clarified to be due to the strong locality of the critical\nYb-valence fluctuation and small Brillouin zone reflecting the large unit cell,\ngiving rise to the extremely-small characteristic energy scale. This also gives\na natural explanation for the quantum criticality in the quasicrystal\ncorresponding to the infinite limit of the unit-cell size.\n", "  The foundation of modern cosmology relies on the so-called cosmological\nprinciple which states an homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter in\nthe universe on large scales. However, recent observations, such as the\ntemperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the\nmotion of galaxies in the universe, the polarization of quasars and the\nacceleration of the cosmic expansion, indicate preferred directions in the sky.\nIf these directions have a cosmological origin, the cosmological principle\nwould be violated, and modern cosmology should be reconsidered. In this paper,\nby considering the preferred axis in the CMB parity violation, we find that it\ncoincides with the preferred axes in CMB quadrupole and CMB octopole, and they\nall align with the direction of the CMB kinematic dipole. In addition, the\npreferred directions in the velocity flows, quasar alignment, anisotropy of the\ncosmic acceleration, the handedness of spiral galaxies, and the angular\ndistribution of the fine-structure constant are also claimed to be aligned with\nthe CMB kinematic dipole. Since CMB dipole was confirmed to be caused by the\nmotion of our local group of galaxies relative to the reference frame of the\nCMB, the coincidence of all these preferred directions hints that these\nanomalies have a common origin, which is not cosmological or due to a\ngravitational effect. The systematical or contaminative errors in observation\nor in data analysis, which can be directly related to the motion of our local\ngroup of galaxies, can play an important role in explaining the anomalies.\n", "  Selectively heating a microscopic colloidal particle embedded in a soft\nelastic matrix is a situation of high practical relevance. For instance, during\nhyperthermic cancer treatment, cell tissue surrounding heated magnetic\ncolloidal particles is destroyed. Experiments on soft elastic polymeric\nmatrices suggest a very long-ranged, non-decaying radial component of the\nthermophoretically induced displacement fields around the microscopic heat\ncenters. We theoretically confirm this conjecture using a macroscopic\nhydrodynamic two-fluid description. Both, thermophoretic and elastic effects\nare included in this theory. Indeed, we find that the elasticity of the\nenvironment can cause the experimentally observed large-scale radial\ndisplacements in the embedding matrix. Additional experiments confirm the\ncentral role of elasticity. Finally, a linearly decaying radial component of\nthe displacement field in the experiments is attributed to the finite size of\nthe experimental sample. Similar results are obtained from our theoretical\nanalysis under modified boundary conditions.\n", "  In this manuscript, we have identified the dynamical instability constraints\nof a self-gravitating cylindrical object within the framework of $f(R,T)$\ntheory of gravity. We have explored the modified field equations and\ncorresponding dynamical equations for the systematic constructions of our\nanalysis. We have imposed the linear perturbations on metric and material\nvariables with some known static profile up to first order in the perturbation\nparameter. The role of expansion scalar is also examined in this scenario. The\ninstability regimes have been discussed in the background of Newtonian and\npost-Newtonian limits. We found that the dark source terms due to the influence\nof modification in the gravity model is responsible for the instability of the\nsystem.\n", "  We propose an efficientmethod to construct shortcuts to adiabaticity through\ndesigning a substitute Hamiltonian to try to avoid the defect in which the\nspeed-up protocol' Hamiltonian may involve terms which are difficult to realize\nin practice. We show that as long as the counterdiabatic coupling terms-even\nonly some of them-have been nullified by the additional Hamiltonian, the\ncorresponding shortcuts to the adiabatic process could be constructed and the\nadiabatic process would be sped up. As an application example, we apply this\nmethod to the popular Landau-Zener model for the realization of fast population\ninversion. The results show that in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems,\nwe can design different additional Hamiltonians to replace the traditional\ncounterdiabatic driving Hamiltonian to speed up the process. This method\nprovides many choices for designing additional terms of the Hamiltonian such\nthat one can choose a realizable model in practice.\n", "  The most common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that players should\nadopt a strategy that warrants the highest payoff. However, recent studies\nindicate that the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced if an\nappropriate fraction of the population chooses the most common rather than the\nmost profitable strategy within the interaction range. Such conformity might be\ndue to herding instincts or crowd behavior in humans and social animals. In a\nheterogeneous population where individuals differ in their degree, collective\ninfluence, or other traits, an unanswered question remains who should conform.\nSelecting conformists randomly is the simplest choice, but it is neither a\nrealistic nor the optimal one. We show that, regardless of the source of\nheterogeneity and game parametrization, socially the most favorable outcomes\nemerge if the masses conform. On the other hand, forcing leaders to conform\nsignificantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and\ncoordination, leading to evolutionary outcomes that are worse still than if\nconformists were chosen randomly. We conclude that leaders must be able to\ncreate a following for network reciprocity to be optimally augmented by\nconformity. In the opposite case, when leaders are castrated and made to\nfollow, the failure of coordination impairs the evolution of cooperation.\n", "  The maximum frequency of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with\ntraditional pulsar timing methods is set by the Nyquist frequency\n($f_{\\rm{Ny}}$) of the observation. Beyond this frequency, GWs leave no\ntemporal-correlated signals; instead, they appear as white noise in the timing\nresiduals. The variance of the GW-induced white noise is a function of the\nposition of the pulsars relative to the GW source. By observing this unique\nfunctional form in the timing data, we propose that we can detect GWs of\nfrequency $>$ $f_{\\rm{Ny}}$ (super-Nyquist frequency GWs; SNFGWs). We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method with simulated timing data.\nUsing a selected dataset from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data release 1 and\nthe North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves publicly\navailable datasets, we try to detect the signals from single SNFGW sources. The\nresult is consistent with no GW detection with 65.5\\% probability. An all-sky\nmap of the sensitivity of the selected pulsar timing array to single SNFGW\nsources is generated, and the position of the GW source where the selected\npulsar timing array is most sensitive to is $\\lambda_{\\rm{s}}=-0.82$,\n$\\beta_{\\rm{s}}=-1.03$ (rad); the corresponding minimum GW strain is\n$h=6.31\\times10^{-11}$ at $f=1\\times10^{-5}$ Hz.\n", "  Recently, the nodal domain counts of planar, integrable billiards with\nDirichlet boundary conditions were shown to satisfy certain difference\nequations in [Ann. Phys. 351, 1-12 (2014)]. The exact solutions of these\nequations give the number of domains explicitly. For complete generality, we\ndemonstrate this novel formulation for three additional separable systems and\nthus extend the statement to all integrable billiards.\n", "  We investigate here the lithium content of young low-mass stars in the\n5~Myr-old star forming region NGC~2264 and its relationship with rotation. We\ncombine lithium equivalent width measurements, EW(Li), from the Gaia-ESO Survey\nwith the determination of rotational periods from the CSI~2264 survey. We\nconsider only bona fide non accreting cluster members in order to minimize\nuncertainties on EW(Li). We report the existence of a relationship between\nlithium content and rotation in NGC~2264 at an age of 5~Myr. The Li-rotation\nconnection is seen over a restricted temperature range, Teff=3800--4400K, where\nfast rotators are Li-rich compared to slow ones. This correlation is similar\nto, albeit of lower amplitude than, the Li-rotation connection previously\nreported for K dwarfs in the 125 Myr-old Pleiades cluster. We investigate\nwhether the non-standard pre-main sequence models developed so far to explain\nthe Pleiades results, which are based on episodic accretion, pre-main sequence\ncore-envelope decoupling, and/or radius inflation due to enhanced magnetic\nactivity, can account for an early development of the Li-rotation connection.\nWhile radius inflation appears to be the most promising possibility, each of\nthese models has issues. We therefore also discuss external causes that might\noperate during the first few Myr of pre-main sequence evolution, such as planet\nengulfment and/or steady disk accretion, as possible candidates for the common\norigin for Li-excess and fast rotation in young low-mass pre-main sequence\nstars. The emergence of a connection between lithium content and rotation rate\nat such an early age as 5~Myr suggests a complex link between accretion\nprocesses, early angular momentum evolution, and possibly planet formation,\nwhich likely impacts early stellar evolution and still is to be fully\ndeciphered.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the hot gas in four fossil galaxy systems\ndetected at high significance in the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) survey.\nXMM-Newton observations reveal overall temperatures of kT ~ 5-6 keV and yield\nhydrostatic masses M500,HE > 3.5 x 10e14 Msun, confirming their nature as bona\nfide massive clusters. We measure the thermodynamic properties of the hot gas\nin X-rays (out to beyond R500 in three cases) and derive their individual\npressure profiles out to R ~ 2.5 R500 with the SZ data. We combine the X-ray\nand SZ data to measure hydrostatic mass profiles and to examine the hot gas\ncontent and its radial distribution. The average Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\nconcentration parameter, c500 = 3.2 +/- 0.4, is the same as that of relaxed\n`normal' clusters. The gas mass fraction profiles exhibit striking variation in\nthe inner regions, but converge to approximately the cosmic baryon fraction\n(corrected for depletion) at R500. Beyond R500 the gas mass fraction profiles\nagain diverge, which we interpret as being due to a difference in gas clumping\nand/or a breakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium in the external regions. Overall\nour observations point to considerable radial variation in the hot gas content\nand in the gas clumping and/or hydrostatic equilibrium properties in these\nfossil clusters, at odds with the interpretation of their being old, evolved\nand undisturbed. At least some fossil objects appear to be dynamically young.\n", "  We argue that a black hole can be viewed as a gravitational optical element\nthat images its interior onto the horizon. Being diffraction limited the \"Airy\nhyper-ball\" that forms as a result of interference of gravitational waves, does\nnot allow for infinite resolution. Thereby, effectively censoring the geodetic\nsingularity. The mechanism proposed must imply intrinsic angular momentum as in\nthe Kerr black hole solution. However, assuming that a static black hole\ndevelops from an initial Kerr solution the destroyed hyperball is delegated to\nthe horizon by the principle of increasing entropy. This lost information about\nthe system resolution is now packed on the horizon, which in effect provides\nthe censorship. Should the mechanism be applicable to the early universe, we\nsuggest that the low variance circles seen in the CMB sky are traces of such an\ninterference pattern.\n", "  We apply the Riccati-Pad\\'{e} method and the Rayleigh-Ritz method with\ncomplex rotation to the study of the resonances of a one-dimensional well with\ntwo barriers. The model exhibits two different kinds of resonances and we\ncalculate them by means of both approaches. While the Rayleigh-Ritz method\nreveals each set at a particular interval of rotation angles the Riccati\nPad\\'{e} method yields both of them as roots of the same Hankel determinants.\n", "  We provide estimates of the wave energy reaching the solar chromosphere and\ncorona in a network-like magnetic field topology, including a coronal null\npoint. The waves are excited by an instantaneous strong subphotospheric source\nand propagate through the subphotosphere, photosphere, chromosphere, transition\nregion, and corona with the plasma beta and other atmospheric parameters\nvarying by several orders of magnitude. We compare two regimes of the wave\npropagation: a linear and nonlinear regime. While the amount of energy reaching\nthe corona is similar in both regimes, this energy is transmitted at different\nfrequencies. In both cases the dominant periods of waves at each height\nstrongly depend on the local magnetic field topology, but this distribution is\nonly in accordance with observations in the nonlinear case.\n", "  Plasma processes are an innovative approach for the decomposition of CO2 in O\nradicals and CO as a valuable carbon source. In this experimental work, a\ntubular dielectric barrier discharge operating at atmospheric pressure has been\nused to split CO2 and study its conversion considering the influence of\nfrequency and power, as well as the influence of various electrical regimes\n(AC, AC pulsed regimes). The CO2 conversion has been measured by mass\nspectrometry and gas chromatography while gas and walls temperatures have been\ndetermined and correlated to evaluate their influence of the CO2 splitting.\n", "  Microplasma arrays operating in helium in a DC regime have been produced in\nsilicon microre-actors. Cathode boundary layer (CBL) type microdevices were\nelaborated using clean room facilities and semiconductor processing techniques.\nIgnition of the micro-discharge arrays having either 50 or 100 m diameter\ncavities was studied. Two different structures (isotropically etched or\nanisotropically etched cavity) and various conditions (the two different\nvoltage polarities, pressures etc.) were investigated. 100 microdis-charges of\n50 m diameter could be ignited in parallel at 1000 torr. At high current, some\nparasitic and transient sparks appeared at the edge of the sample. When the\npolarization was reversed (cathode side corresponding the opened electrode),\nmore current was needed to light all the microdischarges. A thermally affected\nzone around the hole on the anode side was obtained after operation.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyze the effect of thermal fluctuations on the\nthermodynamics of a charged dilatonic black Saturn. These thermal fluctuations\nwill correct the thermodynamics of the charged dilatonic black Saturn. We will\nanalyze the corrections to the thermodynamics of this system by first relating\nthe fluctuations in the entropy to the fluctuations in the energy. Then, we\nwill use the relation between entropy and a conformal field theory to analyze\nthe fluctuations in the entropy. We will demonstrate that similar physical\nresults are obtained from both these approaches. We will also study the effect\nof thermal fluctuations on the phase transition in this charged dilatonic black\nSaturn.\n", "  As the constituents of a flock are polar, one expects a fore-aft asymmetry in\ntheir interactions. We show here that the resulting antisymmetric part of the\n\"exchange coupling\" between a bird and its neighbours, if large enough,\ndestabilizes the flock through spontaneous turning of the birds. The same\nasymmetry also yields a natural mechanism for a difference between the speed of\nadvection of information along the flock and the speed of the flock itself. We\nshow that the absence of detailed balance, and not merely the breaking of\nGalilean invariance, is responsible for this difference. We delineate the\nconditions on parameters and wavenumber for the existence of the turning\ninstability. Lastly we present an alternative perspective based on\nflow-alignment effects in an active liquid crystal with turning inertia in\ncontact with a momentum sink.\n", "  We determine the surface reconstruction of SrTiO3 used to achieve\nsuperconducting FeSe films in experiments, which is different from the 1x1 TiO2\nterminated SrTiO3 assumed by most previous theoretical studies. In particular,\nwe identify the existence of a double TiO2 layer at the SrTiO3-FeSe interface\nthat plays two important roles. First, it facilitates the epitaxial growth of\nFeSe. Second, ab initio calculations reveal a strong tendency for electrons to\ntransfer from an oxygen deficient SrTiO3 surface to FeSe when the double TiO2\nlayer is present. As a better electron donor than previously proposed\ninterfacial structures, the double layer helps to remove the hole pocket in the\nFeSe at the {\\Gamma} point of the Brillouin zone and leads to a band structure\ncharacteristic of superconducting samples. The characterization of the\ninterface structure presented here is a key step towards the resolution of many\nopen questions about this novel superconductor.\n", "  Responding to calls from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for new\nproposals to measure the gravitational constant $G$, we offer an interesting\nexperiment in deep space employing the classic gravity train mechanism. Our\nsetup requires three bodies: a larger layered solid sphere with a cylindrical\nhole through its center, a much smaller retroreflector which will undergo\nharmonic motion within the hole and a host spacecraft with laser ranging\ncapabilities to measure round trip light-times to the retroreflector but\nultimately separated a significant distance away from the sphere-retroreflector\napparatus. Measurements of the period of oscillation of the retroreflector in\nterms of host spacecraft clock time using existing technology could give\ndeterminations of $G$ nearly three orders of magnitude more accurate than\ncurrent measurements here on Earth. However, significant engineering advances\nin the release mechanism of the apparatus from the host spacecraft will likely\nbe necessary. Issues with regard to the stability of the system are briefly\naddressed.\n", "  We present the magnetic phase diagram of TbMn1-xFexO3 substitutional solid\nsolution in the whole concentration range 0 <= x <= 1 as determined from\nmagnetization and specific heat measurements. We have found that the dominant\nmagnetic ion in the concentration range 0 <= x < 0.3 is manganese, while iron\nions do not create independent magnetic structure, but strongly affect magnetic\nproperties of the parent compound by reducing transition to magnetically\nordered state and transition into a cycloidal phase. The magnetism in the\nconcentration range 0.3 < x <= 1 is driven by the Fe sublattice. The manganese\nions again do not order in long range magnetic ordered state, but stabilize\nfour different magnetic structures of Fe sublattice above 2 K. The magnetic\nordering of Tb sublattice was observed only on parent compounds TbMnO3 and\nTbFeO3 and for doping level below 0.1, or over 0.9.\n", "  We have analyzed the frequency and properties of the nuclear activity in a\nsample of galaxies with circumnuclear rings and spirals (CNRs). This sample was\ncompared with a control sample of galaxies with very similar global properties\nbut without circumnuclear rings. We discuss the relevance of the results in\nregard to the AGN feeding processes and present the following results: (i)\nbright companion galaxies seem not to be important for the appearance of CNRs,\nwhich appear to be more related to intrinsic properties of the host galaxies or\nto minor merger processes; (ii) the proportion of strong bars in galaxies with\nan AGN and a CNR is somewhat higher than the expected ratio of strongly barred\nAGN galaxies from the results of Ho and co-workers; (iii) the incidence of\nSeyfert activity coeval with CNRs is clearly larger than the rate expected from\nthe morphological distribution of the host galaxies; (iv) the rate of Sy 2 to\nSy 1 type galaxies with CNRs is about three times larger than the expected\nratio for galaxies without CNRs and is opposite to that predicted by the\ngeometric paradigm of the classical unified model for AGNs, although it does\nsupport the hy-pothesis that Sy 2 activity is linked to circumnuclear star\nformation. The possible selection effects of the sample are discussed, and we\nconclude that the detected trends are strong enough to justify high quality\nobservations of as large as possible sets of galaxies with circumnuclear rings\nand their matched control samples.\n", "  We present a general method of solving the Cauchy problem for a linear\nparabolic partial differential equation of evolution type with variable\ncoefficients and demonstrate it on the equation with derivatives of orders two,\none and zero. The method is based on the Chernoff approximation procedure\napplied to a specially constructed shift operator. It is proven that\napproximations converge uniformly to the exact solution.\n", "  We report the discovery of an optical Einstein Ring in the Sculptor\nconstellation, IAC J010127-334319, in the vicinity of the Sculptor Dwarf\nSpheroidal Galaxy. It is an almost complete ring ($\\sim 300^{\\circ}$) with a\ndiameter of $\\sim 4.5\\, {\\rm arcsec}$. The discovery was made serendipitously\nfrom inspecting Dark Energy Camera (DECam) archive imaging data. Confirmation\nof the object nature has been obtained by deriving spectroscopic redshifts for\nboth components, lens and source, from observations at the $10.4$ m Gran\nTelescopio CANARIAS (GTC) with the spectrograph OSIRIS. The lens, a massive\nearly-type galaxy, has a redshift of ${\\rm z}=0.581$ while the source is a\nstarburst galaxy with redshift of ${\\rm z}=1.165$. The total enclosed mass that\nproduces the lensing effect has been estimated to be ${\\rm M_{tot}=(1.86 \\pm\n0.23) \\,\\cdot 10^{12}\\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}}$.\n", "  In this work, we test consistency relations between a kinematic probe, the\nobservational Hubble data, and a dynamical probe, the growth rates for cosmic\nlarge scale structure, which should hold if general relativity is the correct\ntheory of gravity on cosmological scales. Moreover, we summarize the\ndevelopment history of parametrization in testings and make an improvement of\nit. Taking advantage of the Hubble parameter given from both parametric and\nnon-parametric methods, we propose three equations and test two of them\nperformed by means of two-dimensional parameterizations, including one using\ntrigonometric functions we propose. As a result, it is found that the\nconsistency relations satisfies well at $1\\sigma$ CL and trigonometric\nfunctions turn out to be efficient tools in parameterizations. Furthermore, in\norder to confirm the validity of our test, we introduce a model of modified\ngravity, DGP model and compare the testing results in the cases of\n$\\Lambda$CDM, \"DGP in GR\" and DGP model with mock data. It can be seen that it\nis the establishing of consistency relations which dominates the results of the\ntesting. Overall, the present observational Hubble data and growth rate data\nfavor convincingly that the general relativity is the correct theory of gravity\non cosmological scales.\n", "  Transient and recurrent solar activity drive geomagnetic disturbances; these\nare quantified (amongst others) by DST, AE indices time-series. Transient\ndisturbances are related to the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs)\nwhile recurrent disturbances are related to corotating interaction regions\n(CIR). We study the relationship of the geomagnetic disturbances to the solar\nwind drivers within solar Cycle 23 where the drivers are represented by ICMEs\nand CIRs occurrence rate and compared to the DST and AE as follows: terms with\ncommon periodicity in both the geomagnetic disturbances and the solar drivers\nare, firstly, detected using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, common\npower and phase coherence of these periodic terms are calculated from the\ncross-wavelet spectra (XWT) and waveletcoherence (WTC) respectively. In\ntime-scales of about 27 days our results indicate an anti-correlation of the\neffects of ICMEs and CIRs on the geomagnetic disturbances. The former modulates\nthe DST and AE time series during the cycle maximum the latter during periods\nof reduced solar activity. The phase relationship of these modulation is highly\nnon-linear. Only the annual frequency component of the ICMEs is phase-locked\nwith DST and AE. In time-scales of about 1.3-1.7 years the CIR seem to be the\ndominant driver for both geomagnetic indices throughout the whole solar cycle\n23.\n", "  We show how to apply the BCFW recursion relation to Feynman loop integrals\nwith the help of the Feynman-tree theorem. We deconstruct in this way all\nFeynman diagrams in terms of on-shell subamplitudes. Every cut originating from\nthe Feynman-tree theorem corresponds to an integration over the phase space of\nan unobserved particle pair. We argue that we can calculate scattering\namplitudes alternatively by the construction of on-shell and gauge-invariant\nsubamplitudes.\n", "  The steady, supersonic outflow from the Sun we call the solar wind was first\nposited in the 1950s and initial theories rightly linked the acceleration of\nthe wind to the existence of the million-degree solar corona. Still today, the\nwind acceleration mechanisms and the coronal heating processes remain unsolved\nchallenges in solar physics. In this work, I seek to answer a portion of the\nmystery by focusing on a particular acceleration process: Alfven waves launched\nby the motion of magnetic field footpoints in the photosphere. The entire\ncorona is threaded with magnetic loops and flux tubes that open up into the\nheliosphere. I have sought a better understanding of the role these magnetic\nfields play in determining solar wind properties in open flux tubes. After an\nintroduction of relevant material, I discuss my parameter study of magnetic\nfield profiles and the statistical understanding we can draw from the resulting\nsteady-state wind. In the chapter following, I describe how I extended this\nwork to consider time dependence in the turbulent heating by Alfven waves in\nthree dimensional simulations. The bursty nature of this heating led to a\nnatural next step that expands my work to include not only the theoretical, but\nalso a project to analyze observations of small network jets in the\nchromosphere and transition region, and the underlying photospheric magnetic\nfield that forms thresholds in jet production. In summary, this work takes a\nbroad look at the extent to which Alfven-wave-driven turbulent heating can\nexplain measured solar wind properties and other observed phenomena.\n", "  In this article, we define a doubling procedure for the bialgebra of\nspecified Feynman graphs introduced in a previous paper \\cite {DMB}. This is\nthe vector space generated by the pairs $(\\bar \\Gamma, \\bar \\gamma)$ where\n$\\bar \\Gamma$ is a locally $1PI$ specified graph of a perturbation theory $\\Cal\nT$ with $\\bar \\gamma \\subset \\bar \\Gamma$ locally $1PI$ and where $\\bar \\Gamma\n/ \\bar \\gamma $ is a specified graph of $\\Cal T$. We also define a convolution\nproduct on the characters of this new bialgebra with values in an endomorphism\nalgebra, equipped with a commutative product compatible with the composition.\nWe then express in this framework the renormalization as formulated by A.\nSmirnov \\cite [\\S 8.5, 8.6] {Sm}, adapting the approach of A. Connes and D.\nKreimer for two renormalization schemes: the minimal renormalization scheme and\nthe Taylor expansion scheme. Finally, we determine the finite parts of Feynman\nintegrals using the BPHZ algorithm after dimensional regularization procedure,\nby following the approach by P. Etingof \\cite{PE} (see also \\cite{RM}).\n", "  We consider the effects of shot noise and particle energy spread on\nstatistical properties of Cherenkov and quasi-Cherenkov superradiance emitted\nby a relativistic electron beam. In the absence of energy spread, we have found\nthe root-mean-square deviations of both peak radiated power and instability\ngrowth time as a function of the number of particles. It is shown that energy\nspread can lead to a sharp drop in the radiated power of Cherenkov and\nquasi-Cherenkov superradiance at high currents.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic structure of the pion in terms of the quantum\ncromodynamic~(QCD) model on the Breit-frame. We calculated the observables,\nsuch as the electromagnetic form factor. The priori to have a calculation\ncovariant need to get the valence term of the eletromagnetic form factor. We\nuse the usual formalism in quantum field theory (QFT) and light-front quantum\nfield theory (LFQFT) in order to test the properties of form factor in\nnonperturbative QCD. In this particular case, the form factor can be obtained\nusing the pion Light-Front (LF) wave function including self-energy from\nLattice-QCD. Specifically, these calculations was performed in LF formalism. We\nconsider a quark-antiquark vertex model having a quark self-energy. Also we can\nuse other models to compare the pion electromagnetic form factor with different\nwave function and to observe the degree of agreement between them.\n", "  One of the most fascinating challenges in the context of parton density\nfunction (PDF) is the determination of the best combined PDF uncertainty from\nindividual PDF sets. Since 2014 multiple methodologies have been developed to\nachieve this goal. In this proceedings we first summarize the strategy adopted\nby the PDF4LHC15 recommendation and then, we discuss about a new approach to\nMonte Carlo PDF compression based on clustering through machine learning\nalgorithms.\n", "  We report $^{133}$Cs NMR and $^{75}$As Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR)\nmeasurements on the normal metallic state above $T_c$ of a\nquasi-one-dimensional superconductor Cs$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ ($T_c < 1.6$~K). From\nthe $^{133}$Cs NMR Knight shift $^{133}K$ measured at the Cs1 site, we show\nthat the uniform spin susceptibility $\\chi_{spin}$ increases from 295~K to\n$\\sim$ 60~K, followed by a mild suppression; $\\chi_{spin}$ then levels off\nbelow $\\sim$10~K. In contrast, a vanishingly small magnitude of $^{133}K$\nindicates that Cs2 sites contribute very little to electrical conduction and\nthe exchange interactions between 3d electrons at Cr sites. Low frequency Cr\nspin dynamics, reflected on $^{75}$As $1/T_1T$ (the nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate $1/T_1$ divided by temperature $T$), shows an analogous trend\nas $\\chi_{spin}$. Comparison with the results of $1/T_1T$ near $T_c$ with\nRb$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ ($T_c=6.1$~K) and Rb$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ ($T_c=4.8$~K)\nestablishes a systematic trend that substitution of K$^{+}$ ions with larger\nalkali ions progressively suppresses Cr spin fluctuations together with $T_c$.\n", "  The number of baryons in the observable universe is of the order of\n$10^{80}$, as is the number of electrons. The number of photons is about nine\norders of magnitude greater, $10^{89}$, as is the estimated number of\nneutrinos. However, the number of gravitons could be more than twenty orders of\nmagnitude larger yet, of the order of $10^{113} r$, where $r$ is the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio for quantum fluctuations produced by inflation, which\ncould be as high as $0.1$.\n", "  We calculate and discuss the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D\nBose gas caused by a gap $\\Delta$ in the energy of the particles constituting\nthe gas that without the gap behaves like an ideal Bose gas. Explicit formulae\nwith arbitrary $\\Delta$ values are discussed for: the critical temperature\nwhich increases as the gap grows; the condensate fraction; the internal energy;\nand the constant-volume specific heat found to possess a jump-discontinuity for\nany $\\Delta$ different from zero. Three dimensional infinite ideal Bose gas\nresults are recovered when we the energy gap goes to zero.\n", "  We discuss the generic phenomenology of quantum gravity and, in particular,\nargue that the observable effects of quantum gravity, associated with new,\nextended, non-local, non-particle-like quanta, and accompanied by a dynamical\nenergy-momentum space, are not necessarily Planckian and that they could be\nobserved at much lower and experimentally accessible energy scales.\n", "  ATLAST is a particular realization of LUVOIR, the Large Ultraviolet Optical\nInfrared telescope, a ~10 m diameter space telescope being defined for\nconsideration in the 2020 Decadal Review of astronomy and astrophysics.\nATLAST/LUVOIR is generally thought of as an ambient temperature (~300 K)\nsystem, and little consideration has been given to using it at infrared\nwavelengths longward of ~2 {\\mu}m. We assess the scientific and technical\nbenefits of operating such a telescope further into the infrared, with\nparticular emphasis on the study of exoplanets, which is a major science theme\nfor ATLAST/LUVOIR. For the study of exoplanet atmospheres, the capability to\nwork at least out to 5.0 {\\mu}m is highly desirable. Such an extension of the\nlong wavelength limit of ATLAST would greatly increase its capabilities for\nstudies of exoplanet atmospheres and provide powerful capabilities for the\nstudy of a wide range of astrophysical questions. We present a concept for a\nfiber-fed grating spectrometer which would enable R = 200 spectroscopy on\nATLAST with minimal impact on the other focal planet instruments. We conclude\nthat it is technically feasible and highly desirable scientifically to extend\nthe wavelength range of ATLAST to at least 5 {\\mu}m.\n", "  The quantum entanglement measure is determined, for the first time, for a\ncollection of spin-1/2 arranged in a infinite chain with finite temperature and\napplied to a single-crystal \\beta-\\mathrm{T_eVO_4}. The physical quantity\nproposed here to measure the entanglement is the distance between states by\nadopting the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We relate the distance between states with\nthe magnetic susceptibility. The decoherence temperature, above which the\nentanglement is suppressed, is determined for a system. A correlation among\ntheir decoherence temperatures and their respective exchange coupling constants\nis established, moreover, it is conjectured that the exchange coupling protects\nthe system from decoherence as temperature increases.\n", "  This is a \"perspective\" inspired by the forthcoming article, \"What makes the\n$T_c$ of monolayer FeSe on SrTiO so high: a sign-problem free quantum Monte\nCarlo study,\" by Z-X. Li, F. Wang, H. Yao, and D-H. Lee, arXiv:1512.06179.\n", "  The aim of this note is to derive the mixed-phase version of the moist-air\nentropy potential temperature $\\theta_s$ derived in Marquet (2011).\n  This mixed-phase version is suitable to describe parcels where liquid water\nand ice are allowed to coexist, with possible under- or super-saturations, with\npossible supercooled water and with possible different temperatures for dry air\nand water vapour, on the one hand, condensed water and ice, on the other hand.\n  The impact of this new mixed-phase version for $\\theta_s$ are evaluated by\nusing high latitudes, SHEBA/FIRE-ACE vertical profiles depicted in Figure 7 of\nMorisson et al. (2011).\n", "  The first-principle study on double perovskite compound Ba$_2$PrVO$_6$ has\nbeen presented in this paper. By analysing band structures and integrated\ndensity of states, it is found that Ba$_2$PrVO$_6$ is ferromagnetic metallic\nwithin LSDA and compensated half metallic whithin LSDA+U. According to the\ntotal and partial density of states, the anti-ferromagnetism of Ba$_2$PrVO$_6$\nis originated from the spin down state Pr$^{4+}$ ($4f_{-2}$) and the spin up\nhybridized state between the partially filled $t_{2g}$ state of V and the\npartially filled triple-degeneration state $4f_{-1}$, $4f_{+1}$, $4f_{+3}$ of\nPr. We have investigated the magnetic evaluation of Ba$_2$PrVO$_6$ through\nfixed spin moment calculations, and the results indicate that the compensated\nhalf-metallic state is the ground state. The thermodynamic properties of\nBa$_2$PrVO$_6$ are also studied by employing the quasi-harmonic Debye model.\n", "  This work is a continuation of the analysis first presented in Cheung & Zaki\n(2014). In that study, the combination matrix was introduced as a means to\ntractably handle the nonlinear terms in the spectral domain. In this work, a\ndifferent approach is discussed. Rather than analyze solutions to the energy\nequation, we examine the forced Navier-Stokes equations in spectral space and\ndetermine if direct solutions to the momentum equations can be found. This is\ndone by using the combination matrix to rewrite the Navier-Stokes as a system\nof intersecting quadratic polynomials. Intrepreted geometrically, any solution\nto the Navier-Stokes can be represented as a the intersection of a multiple\nconic sections.\n", "  We report a new form of compensating accelerating beam generated by amplitude\nmodulation of the symmetric Airy beam (SAB) caustics with an exponential\napodization mask. Our numerical study manifests that the compensating beam is\nwith one main-lobe beam structure and can maintain the mean-intensity invariant\nboth in the free space and loss media. Specially, the beam inherits the\nbeamlets structure from the SAB and owns a novel damped oscillating propagation\nproperty. We also conduct a comparative study of its propagation property with\nthat of the Airy beam theoretically. And by altering the signs of 2D masks, the\nmain lobe of the compensating beam can be modulated to orientate in four\ndifferent quadrants flexibly. The proposed compensating accelerating beam is\nanticipated to get special applications in particle manipulation or plasmas\nregions.\n", "  We study several quantities associated to the Green's function of a multiply\nconnected domain in the complex plane. Among them are some intrinsic properties\nsuch as geodesics, curvature, and $L^2$-cohomology of the capacity metric and\ncritical points of the Green's function. The principal idea used is an affine\nscaling of the domain that furnishes quantitative boundary behaviour of the\nGreen's function and related objects.\n", "  The efficiency of GaAs nanowire solar cells can be significantly improved\nwithout any new processing steps or material requirements. We report coupled\noptoelectronic simulations of a GaAs nanowire (NW) solar cell with vertical\np-i-n junction and high band gap AlInP passivating shell. Our\nfrequency-dependent model facilitates calculation of quantum efficiency for the\nfirst time in NW solar cells. For passivated NWs, we find that short-wavelength\nphotons can be most effectively harnessed by using a thin emitter while\nlong-wavelength photons are best utilized by extending the intrinsic region to\nthe nanowire/substrate interface, and using the substrate as a base. These two\neasily implemented changes, coupled with the increase of NW height to 3.5 um\nwith realistic surface recombination in the presence of a passivation shell,\nresult in a NW solar cell with greater than 19% efficiency.\n", "  At National Institute of Metrological Research (INRIM), a selectable-value\nTransportable High dcVoltage Standard (THVS) operating in the range from 10 V\nto 100 V in steps of 10 V, was developed. This Standard was built to cover the\nlack of high level dc Voltage Standards at voltages higher than 10 V to employ\nas laboratory (local) or travelling Standards for Inter-Laboratory Comparisons\n(ILCs). A ground-mobile electronic technique was used to enhance the accuracy\nof the THVS at the higher values. The THVS shows better noise, better\nshort-mid-term stability than top level dc Voltage and multifunction\ncalibrators (MFCs) and better suitability and insensibility to be transported\nthan these instruments. The project is extensible to 1000 V.\n", "  Usually HBT effect can be interpreted by classical (intensity fluctuation\ncorrelation) and quantum (interference of two-photon probability amplitudes)\ntheories properly at the same time. In this manuscript, we report a\ndeliberately designed experiment in which two chaotic light beams has the same\nintensity fluctuation but mutual-orthogonal polarizations to each other so\nthere will be no interference of two-photon probability amplitudes. Classical\nand quantum theory give different predictions on if there should be HBT (photon\nbunching) effect or not in the experiment. The experiment results are used to\ntest the two different predictions. At the end, both the temporal and spatial\nHBT effects are observed.\n", "  We present a neat example of a meson--baryon system where the vicinity of two\ndifferent thresholds enhances the binding of a hadronic resonance, a\npentaquark. As a consequence the pattern of states may change when moving among\ndifferent flavor sectors, what poses a warning on naive extrapolations to heavy\nflavor sectors based on systematic expansions. For this purpose we\nsimultaneously analyze the $N\\bar D$ and $NB$ two-hadron systems looking for\npossible bound states or resonances. When a resonance is controlled by a\ncoupled-channel effect, going to a different flavor sector may enhance or\ndiminish the binding. This effect may, for example, generate significant\ndifferences between the charmonium and bottomonium spectra above open-flavor\nthresholds or pentaquark states in the open-charm and open-bottom sectors.\n", "  We consider non-smooth functions of (truncated) Wiener--Hopf type operators\non the Hilbert space $L^2(\\mathbb R^d)$. Our main results are uniform estimates\nfor trace norms ($d\\ge 1$) and quasiclassical asymptotic formulas for traces of\nthe resulting operators ($d=1$). Here, we follow Harold Widom's seminal ideas,\nwho proved such formulas for smooth functions decades ago. The extension to\nnon-smooth functions and the uniformity of the estimates in various (physical)\nparameters rest on recent advances by one of the authors (AVS). We use our\nresults to obtain the large-scale behaviour of the local entropy and the\nspatially bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) of thermal equilibrium states of\nnon-interacting fermions in position space $\\mathbb R^d$ ($d\\ge 1$) at positive\ntemperature, $T>0$. In particular, our definition of the thermal EE leads to\nestimates that are simultaneously sharp for small $T$ and large scaling\nparameter $\\alpha>0$ provided that the product $T\\alpha$ remains bounded from\nbelow. Here $\\alpha$ is the reciprocal quasiclassical parameter. For $d=1$ we\nobtain for the thermal EE an asymptotic formula which is consistent with the\nlarge-scale behaviour of the ground-state EE (at $T=0$), previously established\nby the authors for $d\\ge 1$.\n", "  The NASA Kepler spacecraft data revealed a large number of multimode\nnonradially pulsating gamma Dor and delta Sct variable star candidates. The\nhigh precision long time-series photometry makes it possible to study amplitude\nvariations of the frequencies. We summarize recent literature on amplitude and\nfrequency variations in pulsating variables. We are searching for amplitude\nvariability in several dozen faint gamma Doradus or delta Scuti variable-star\ncandidates observed as part of the Kepler Guest Observer program. We apply\nseveral methods, including a Matlab-script wavelet analysis developed by J.\nJackiewicz, and the wavelet technique of the VSTAR software\n(http://www.aavso.org/vstar-overview). Here we show results for two stars, KIC\n2167444 and KIC 2301163. We discuss the magnitude and timescale of the\namplitude variations, and the presence or absence of correlations between\namplitude variations for different frequencies of a given star. Amplitude\nvariations may be detectable using Kepler data even for stars with Kepler\nmagnitude >14 with low-amplitude frequencies (around 100 ppm) using only one or\na few quarters of long-cadence data. We discuss proposed causes of amplitude\nspectrum variability that will require further investigation.\n", "  Positive definiteness of a Hamiltonian expanded about an equilibrium point\nprovides only a necessary condition for stability, a criterion known as\nDirichlet's theorem. The reason that this criterion is not necessary for\nstability is because of the possible existence of negative energy modes, which\nare linearly stable modes of oscillation that have negative energy. When such\nmodes are present, the Hamiltonian is, in general, indefinite. Although such\nsystems with negative energy modes are linearly stable (spectral stable), they\nare unstable to infinitesimal perturbations under the nonlinear dynamics. In\nthe present work we study this kind of nonlinear instability with the simplest\nnontrivial four dimensional area-preserving map, which has a cubic degree of\nfreedom, that was designed to mimic the behavior of a Hamiltonian system with\none positive and one negative energy mode, and a quadratic degree of freedom,\nthat allows eventual escapes in phase space, usually called as Arnold\ndiffusion.\n", "  Dirac semimetal is a class of semi-metallic phase protected by certain types\nof crystalline symmetries, and its low-energy effective Hamiltonian is\ndescribed by Dirac equations in three dimensions (3D). Despite of various\ntheoretical studies, theories that describe the topological nature of Dirac\nsemimetals have not been well established. In this work, we define a\ntopological invariant for 3D Dirac semimetals by establishing a mapping between\na 3D Dirac semimetal and a topological crystalline insulator in four dimension\n(4D). We demonstrate this scheme by constructing a tight-binding model for 4D\ntopological crystalline insulators that are protected by rotational symmetry. A\nnew type of topological invariant, \"rotational Chern number\", is shown to\ncharacterize the topology of this system. As a consequence of the rotational\nChern number, gapless Dirac points are found on the 3D surface of this 4D\nsystem. For a slab with two surfaces, we find that the corresponding low-energy\neffective theory of two surface states can be directly mapped to that of a 3D\nDirac semimetal, suggesting that topological nature of 3D Dirac semimetals can\nbe characterized by rotational Chern number which is defined in 4D. Our scheme\nprovides a new systematic approach to extract topological nature for\ntopological semimetal phases.\n", "  Los Alamos National Laboratory has calculated a new generation of radiative\nopacities (OPLIB data using the ATOMIC code) for elements with atomic number\nZ=1-30 with improved physics input, updated atomic data, and finer temperature\ngrid to replace the Los Alamos LEDCOP opacities released in the year 2000. We\ncalculate the evolution of standard solar models including these new opacities,\nand compare with models evolved using the Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory OPAL (Iglesias and Rogers 1996) opacities. We use the solar\nabundance mixture of Asplund et al. (2009). The new Los Alamos ATOMIC opacities\nhave steeper opacity derivatives than those of OPAL for temperatures and\ndensities of the solar interior radiative zone. We compare the calculated\nnonadiabatic solar oscillation frequencies and solar interior sound speed to\nobserved frequencies and helioseismic inferences. The calculated sound-speed\nprofiles are similar for models evolved using either the updated Iben evolution\ncode (see \\cite{Guzik2010}), or the MESA evolution code (Paxton et al., 2015).\nThe LANL ATOMIC opacities partially mitigate the \"solar abundance problem\".\n", "  A heavy quark placed in the medium modifies its specific heat. Using a\nrenormalization group argument we show a low energy theorem in terms of the\ndefect in the trace of the energy-momentum tensor which allows the unambiguous\ndetermination of the corresponding entropy shift after imposing the third\nprinciple of thermodynamics for degenerate states. We show how recent lattice\nQCD data can be understood in the confined phase in terms of a single-heavy\nhadronic spectrum and above the phase transition through power corrections\nwhich are analyzed by means of a dimension 2 gluon condensate of the\ndimensionally reduced theory.\n", "  We present multidimensional modeling of convection and oscillations in\nmain-sequence stars somewhat more massive than the Sun, using three separate\napproaches: 1) Using the 3-D planar StellarBox radiation hydrodynamics code to\nmodel the envelope convection zone and part of the radiative zone. Our goals\nare to examine the interaction of stellar pulsations with turbulent convection\nin the envelope, excitation of acoustic modes, and the role of convective\novershooting; 2) Applying the spherical 3-D MHD ASH (Anelastic Spherical\nHarmonics) code to simulate the core convection and radiative zone. Our goal is\nto determine whether core convection can excite low-frequency gravity modes,\nand thereby explain the presence of low frequencies for some hybrid gamma\nDoradus/delta Scuti variables for which the envelope convection zone is too\nshallow for the convective blocking mechanism to drive gravity modes; 3)\nApplying the ROTORC 2-D stellar evolution and dynamics code to calculate\nevolution with a variety of initial rotation rates and extents of core\nconvective overshooting. The nonradial adiabatic pulsation frequencies of these\nnonspherical models are calculated using the 2-D pulsation code NRO. We present\nnew insights into pulsations for stars of one to two solar masses gained by\nmultidimensional modeling.\n", "  Threshold-linear networks consist of simple units interacting in the presence\nof a threshold nonlinearity. Competitive threshold-linear networks have long\nbeen known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles\ninto one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions\nthat guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded\nactivity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of\ncompetitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph.\nBy exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are\ncapable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics,\nincluding limit cycles, quasiperiodic attractors, and chaos. In particular,\nseveral types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our\nmathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic\npatterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest\nthat threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the\nrelationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.\n", "  The non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory of\nirreversible processes in liquids is extended to describe the positional and\norientational thermal fluctuations of the instantaneous local concentration\nprofile $n(\\mathbf{r},\\Omega,t)$ of a suddenly-quenched colloidal liquid of\nparticles interacting through non spherically-symmetric pairwise interactions,\nwhose mean value $\\overline{n}(\\mathbf{r},\\Omega,t)$ is constrained to remain\nuniform and isotropic, $\\overline{n}(\\mathbf{r},\\Omega,t)=\\overline{n}(t)$.\nSuch self-consistent theory is cast in terms of the time-evolution equation of\nthe covariance $\\sigma(t)=\\overline{\\delta n_{lm}(\\mathbf{k};t) \\delta\nn^{\\dagger}_{lm}(\\mathbf{k};t)}$ of the fluctuations $\\delta\nn_{lm}(\\mathbf{k};t)=n_{lm}(\\mathbf{k};t) -\\overline{n_{lm}}(\\mathbf{k};t)$ of\nthe spherical harmonics projections $n_{lm}(\\mathbf{k};t)$ of the Fourier\ntransform of $n(\\mathbf{r},\\Omega,t)$. The resulting theory describes the\nnon-equilibrium evolution after a sudden temperature quench of both, the static\nstructure factor projections $S_{lm}(k,t)$ and the two-time correlation\nfunction $F_{lm}(k,\\tau;t)\\equiv\\overline{\\delta n_{lm}(\\mathbf{k},t)\\delta\nn_{lm}(\\mathbf{k},t+\\tau)}$, where $\\tau$ is the correlation \\emph{delay} time\nand $t$ is the \\emph{evolution} or \\emph{waiting} time after the quench. As a\nconcrete and illustrative application we use the resulting self-consistent\nequations to describe the irreversible processes of equilibration or aging of\nthe orientational degrees of freedom of a system of strongly interacting\nclassical dipoles with quenched positional disorder.\n", "  Modification of surface and volume of sapphire is shown to affect reflected\nand transmitted light at THz spectral range. Structural modifications were made\nusing ultra-short 230 fs laser pulses at 1030 nm and 257.5 nm wavelengths\nforming surface ripples of ~250 nm and 60 nm period, respectively. Softening of\nthe transverse optical phonon TO1 mode due to disorder was the most pronounced\nin reflection from laser ablated surface. It is shown that sub-surface periodic\npatterns of laser damage sites have also modified reflection spectrum due to\ncoupling of THz radiation with phonons. Application potential of laser\nstructuring and disordering for phononic engineering is discussed.\n", "  We use first-principles density functional theory to study the generalized\nstacking fault energy surfaces for pyramidal-I and pyramidal-II slip systems in\nMg. We demonstrate that the additional relaxation of atomic motions normal to\nthe slip direction allows for the appropriate local minimum in the generalized\nstacking fault energy (GSFE) curve to be found. The fault energy calculations\nsuggest that formation of pyramidal-I dislocations would be slightly more\nenergetically favorable than that for pyramidal-II dislocations. The calculated\npyramidal-II GSFE curves also indicate that the full pyramidal II dislocations\nwould dissociate into the Stohr and Poirier (SP) configuration, consisting of\ntwo $\\frac{1}{2}\\langle c+a \\rangle$ partials, $\\frac{1}{6}[11{\\bar2}3] +\n\\frac{1}{6}[11{\\bar2}3]$ , but the pyramidal-I GSFE curves, while also\npossessing a local minimum, would not dissociate into the same SP\nconfiguration. We report observation of these partials here emanating from a\n$\\{10{\\bar1}2 \\}$ twin boundary. Using MD simulations with MEAM potential for\nMg, we find that the full pyramidal-II $\\langle c+a \\rangle $ dislocation\nsplits into two equal value partials $\\frac{1}{6}[11{\\bar2}3] +\n\\frac{1}{6}[11{\\bar2}3]$ separated by ~22.6 $\\AA$. We reveal that the full\npyramidal-I $\\langle c+a \\rangle$ dislocation dissociates also into two equal\nvalue partials but onto alternating $(30{\\bar3}4)$ and $(30{\\bar3}2)$ planes\nwith $\\frac{1}{6} [20{\\bar2}3]$ and $\\frac{1}{6} [02{\\bar2}3]$ Burgers vectors\nseparated by a 30.4 $\\AA$ wide stacking fault. When a stress is applied, edge\nand mixed dislocations of the extended pyramidal-II dislocation can move on\ntheir glide plane; however, pyramidal-I dislocations of similar character\ncannot.\n", "  By employing a series of massively parallel ab-initio simulations, we study\nhow optical forces act on biological matter subject to morphological disease.\nAs a representative case study, we here consider the case of Plasmodium\nFalciparum on red blood cells (RBC) illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave.\nRealistic parameters for the geometry and the refractive index are then taken\nfrom published experiments. In our theoretical campaign, we study the\ndependence of the optical force on the disease stage for different incident\nwavelengths. We show that optical forces change significantly with the disease,\nwith amplitude variation in the hundreds of pN range. Our results open up new\navenues for the design of new optical systems for the treatment of human\ndisease.\n", "  Brute-force simulations for dynamics on very large networks are quite\nexpensive. While phenomenological treatments may capture some macroscopic\nproperties, they often ignore important microscopic details. Fortunately, one\nmay be only interested in the property of local part and not in the whole\nnetwork. Here, we propose a hybrid multiscale coarse-grained(HMCG) method which\ncombines a fine Monte Carlo(MC) simulation on the part of nodes of interest\nwith a more coarse Langevin dynamics on the rest part. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of our method by analyzing the equilibrium Ising model and the\nnonequilibrium susceptible-infected-susceptible model. It is found that HMCG\nnot only works very well in reproducing the phase transitions and critical\nphenomena of the microscopic models, but also accelerates the evaluation of\ndynamics with significant computational savings compared to microscopic MC\nsimulations directly for the whole networks. The proposed method is general and\ncan be applied to a wide variety of networked systems just adopting appropriate\nmicroscopic simulation methods and coarse graining approaches.\n", "  It is well known that, from the Newtonian point of view, the Lagrangian point\n$L_4$ in the circular restricted three body is stable if $\\mu<\n\\frac{1}{18}(9-\\sqrt{19})\\approx 0.03852$. In this paper we will provide a\nformula that allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the matrix that determines\nthe stability of the equilibrium points of a family of ordinary differential\nequations. As an application we will show that, under the relativistic\nframework, the Lagrangian point $L_4$ is also stable for the Sun-Earth system.\nSimilar arguments show the stability for $L_4$ not only for the Sun-Earth\nsystem but for systems coming from a range of values for $\\mu$ similar to those\nin the Newtonian restricted three body problem.\n", "  We investigate an angular dependence of the photoemission time delay in\nhelium as measured by the RABBITT (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating By\nInterference of Two-photon Transitions) technique. The measured time delay $\n\\tau_a=\\tau_W+\\tau_{cc} $ contains two distinct components: the Wigner time\ndelay $\\tau_W$ and the continuum-continuum CC) correction $\\tau_{cc}$. In the\ncase of helium with only one $1s\\to Ep$ photoemission channel, the Wigner time\ndelay $\\tau_W$ does not depend on the photoelectron detection angle relative to\nthe polarization vector. However, the CC correction $\\tau_{cc}$ shows a\nnoticeable angular dependence. We illustrate these findings by performing two\nsets of calculations. In the first set, we solve the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the helium atom ionized by an attosecond pulse train\nand probed by an IR pulse. In the second approach, we employ the lowest order\nperturbation theory which describes absorption of the XUV and IR photons. Both\ncalculations produce close results in a fair agreement with experiment.\n", "  The propagation of magnons in temperature gradients is investigated within\nthe framework of an atomistic spin model with the stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation as underlying equation of motion. We analyze\nthe magnon accumulation, the magnon temperature profile as well as the\npropagation length of the excited magnons. The frequency distribution of the\ngenerated magnons is investigated in order to derive an expression for the\ninfluence of the anisotropy and the damping parameter on the magnon propagation\nlength. For soft ferromagnetic insulators with low damping a propagation length\nin the range of some $\\mu$m can be expected for exchange driven magnons.\n", "  This document presents the latest results for a 3+1 sterile neutrino search\nusing the $10.56 \\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target data set taken from 2005 -\n2012. By searching for oscillations driven by a large mass splitting, MINOS is\nsensitive to the existence of sterile neutrinos through any energy dependent\ndeviations using a charged current sample, as well as looking at any relative\ndeficit between neutral current events between the far and near detectors. This\ndocument will discuss the novel analysis that enabled a search for sterile\nneutrinos setting a limit in the previously unexplored regions in the parameter\nspace $\\{\\Delta m^{2}_{41}, \\sin^2\\theta_{24}\\}$. The results presented can be\ncompared to the parameter space suggested by LSND and MiniBooNE and complements\nother previous experimental searches for sterile neutrinos in the electron\nneutrino appearance channel.\n", "  The main aim of the present paper is to prove the existence of a phase\ntransition in quantum Markov chain (QMC) scheme for the Ising type models on a\nCayley tree. Note that this kind of models do not have one-dimensional\nanalogous, i.e. the considered model persists only on trees. In this paper, we\nprovide a more general construction of forward QMC. In that construction, a QMC\nis defined as a weak limit of finite volume states with boundary conditions,\ni.e. QMC depends on the boundary conditions. Our main result states the\nexistence of a phase transition for the Ising model with competing interactions\non a Cayley tree of order two. By the phase transition we mean the existence of\ntwo distinct QMC which are not quasi-equivalent and their supports do not\noverlap. We also study some algebraic property of the disordered phase of the\nmodel, which is a new phenomena even in a classical setting.\n", "  In this paper we derive generalized forms of the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation\nfrom a Boussinesq-type equation using a two-parameter asymptotic expansion\nbased on two small parameters characterizing nonlinear and dispersive effects\nand strictly following the arguments in the asymptotic derivation of the\nclassical CH equation. The resulting equations generalize the CH equation in\ntwo different ways. The first generalization replaces the quadratic\nnonlinearity of the CH equation with a general power-type nonlinearity while\nthe second one replaces the dispersive terms of the CH equation with\nfractional-type dispersive terms. In the absence of both higher-order\nnonlinearities and fractional-type dispersive effects, the generalized\nequations derived reduce to the classical CH equation that describes\nunidirectional propagation of shallow water waves. The generalized equations\nobtained are compared to similar equations available in the literature, and\nthis leads to the observation that the present equations have not appeared in\nthe literature.\n", "  We prove a sharp remainder term for H\\\"older's inequality for traces as a\nconsequence of the uniform convexity properties of the Schatten trace norms. We\nthen show how this implies a novel family of Pinsker type bounds for the\nquantum Renyi entropy. Finally, we show how the sharp form of the usual quantum\nPinsker inequality for relative entropy may be obtained as a fairly direct\nconsequence of uniform convexity.\n", "  We present the first quantum key distribution (QKD) experiment over multicore\nfiber. With space division multiplexing, we demonstrate that weak QKD signals\ncan coexist with classical data signals launched at full power in a 53 km\n7-core fiber, while showing negligible degradation in performance. Based on a\ncharacterization of intercore crosstalk, we perform additional simulations\nhighlighting that classical data bandwidths beyond 1Tb/s can be supported with\nhigh speed QKD on the same fiber.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a relaxation filtering closure approach to\naccount for subgrid scale effects in explicitly filtered large eddy simulations\nusing the concept of anisotropic diffusion. We utilize the Perona-Malik\ndiffusion model and demonstrate its shock capturing ability and spectral\nperformance for solving the Burgers turbulence problem, which is a simplified\nprototype for more realistic turbulent flows showing the same quadratic\nnonlinearity. Our numerical assessments present the behavior of various\ndiffusivity functions in conjunction with a detailed sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to the free modeling parameters. In comparison to direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) and under-resolved DNS results, we find that the proposed\nclosure model is efficient in the prevention of energy accumulation at grid\ncut-off and is also adept at preventing any possible spurious numerical\noscillations due to shock formation under the optimal parameter choices. In\ncontrast to other relaxation filtering approaches, it is also shown that a\nlarger inertial range can be obtained by the proposed anisotropic diffusion\nmodel using a compact stencil scheme in an efficient way.\n", "  The complexity of human behaviour can lead to very unpredictable patterns in\nsocial activity and structure. Here we demonstrate the instability of a\ncommunity network controlled by majority ruling, where an element adopts the\nmost popular opinion of their peers. We modelled a community as a square\nlattice, and performed sequential time step numerical calculations upon each\ncell in parallel. Depending on the initial ratio of two opinions, the community\ncan segregate either into separate gangs and cliques, or get dominated by a\nsingle opinion. We also note that gangs are separated by neutral or confused\ngroups of individuals, buffering the transition. The behaviors shown by this\nmodel can be comfortably applied to many other real life situations, such as\nneural or ecological networks. The results of this paper have been preliminary\npublished in the Ref. [34].\n", "  A common approach to evaluate entropy in quantum systems is to solve a\nmaster-Bloch equation to determine density matrix and substitute it in entropy\ndefinition. However, this method has been recently understood to lack many\nenergy correlators. The new correlators make entropy evaluation to be different\nfrom the substitution method described above. The reason for such complexity\nlies in the nonlinearity of entropy. In this paper we present a pedagogical\napproach to evaluate the new correlators and explain their contribution in the\nanalysis. We show that the inherent nonlinearity in entropy makes the second\nlaw of thermodynamics to carry new terms associated to the new correlators. Our\nresults show important new remarks on quantum black holes. Our formalism\nreveals that the notion of degeneracy of states at the event horizon makes an\nindispensable deviation from black hole entropy in the leading order.\n", "  Nucleation and growth of solids from solutions impacts many natural processes\nand are fundamental to applications in materials engineering and medicine. For\na crystalline solid, the nucleus is a nanoscale cluster of ordered atoms, which\nforms through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. These mechanisms\nhave important consequences on the morphology and nucleation rates of the\nresultant crystals but it is unclear whether a nucleus forms spontaneously from\nsolution in a single step or through multiple steps. Using in-situ electron\nmicroscopy, we observe and quantify how gold and silver nanocrystals nucleate\nfrom a supersaturated aqueous gold and silver solution in three distinct steps:\n(I) spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases, (II)\nnucleation of amorphous gold nanoclusters within the gold-rich liquid phase,\nfollowed by (III) crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab-initio\ncalculations on gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated\nwith strong gold-gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold\ncomplexes. The understanding of intermediate steps in nuclei formation has\nimportant implications for the formation and growth of both crystalline and\namorphous materials.\n", "  Logic-qubit entanglement has attracted much attention in both quantum\ncommunication and quantum computation. Here, we present an efficient protocol\nto distill the logic-qubit entanglement with the help of cross-Kerr\nnonlinearity. This protocol not only can purify the logic bit-flip error and\nlogic phase-flip error, but also can correct the physical bit-flip error\ncompletely. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition\ndetectors. Our distillation protocol for logic-qubit entanglement may be useful\nfor the practical applications in quantum information, especially in\nlong-distance quantum communication.\n", "  A new empirical, analytical model of cold plasma (< 10 keV) in the Jovian\ninner magnetosphere is constructed. Plasmas in this energy range impact surface\ncharging. A new feature of this model is predicting each plasma parameter for a\nspecified probability (percentile). The new model was produced as follows. We\nstart from a reference model for each plasma parameter, which was scaled to fit\nthe data of Galileo plasma spectrometer. The scaled model was then represented\nas a function of radial distance, magnetic local time, and magnetic latitude,\npresumably describing the mean states. Then, the deviation of the observed\nvalues from the model were attribute to the variability in the environment,\nwhich was accounted for by the percentile at a given location.The input\nparameters for this model are the spacecraft position and the percentile. The\nmodel is inteded to be used for the JUICE mission analysis.\n", "  This Report summarizes the proceedings of the 2015 Les Houches workshop on\nPhysics at TeV Colliders. Session 1 dealt with (I) new developments relevant\nfor high precision Standard Model calculations, (II) the new PDF4LHC parton\ndistributions, (III) issues in the theoretical description of the production of\nStandard Model Higgs bosons and how to relate experimental measurements, (IV) a\nhost of phenomenological studies essential for comparing LHC data from Run I\nwith theoretical predictions and projections for future measurements in Run II,\nand (V) new developments in Monte Carlo event generators.\n", "  The dynamics of a Brownian particle in a constant magnetic field and\ntime-dependent electric field is studied in the limit of white noise, using a\nLangevin approach for the classical problem and the path-integral\nFeynman-Vernon and Caldeira-Leggett framework for the quantum problem. We study\nthe time evolution in configuration space of the probability distribution of an\ninitial pure state represented by an asymmetrical Gaussian wave function and\nshow that it can be described as the superposition of (a) the classical motion\nof the center of mass, (b) a rotation around the mean position, and (c) a\nspreading processes along the principal axes.\n", "  The threshold model has been widely adopted as a classic model for studying\ncontagion processes on social networks. We consider asymmetric individual\ninteractions in social networks and introduce a persuasion mechanism into the\nthreshold model. Specifically, we study a combination of adoption and\npersuasion in cascading processes on complex networks. It is found that with\nthe introduction of the persuasion mechanism, the system may become more\nvulnerable to global cascades, and the effects of persuasion tend to be more\nsignificant in heterogeneous networks than those in homogeneous networks: a\ncomparison between heterogeneous and homogeneous networks shows that under weak\npersuasion, heterogeneous networks tend to be more robust against random shocks\nthan homogeneous networks; whereas under strong persuasion, homogeneous\nnetworks are more stable. Finally, we study the effects of adoption and\npersuasion threshold heterogeneity on systemic stability. Though both\nheterogeneities give rise to global cascades, the adoption heterogeneity has an\noverwhelmingly stronger impact than the persuasion heterogeneity when the\nnetwork connectivity is sufficiently dense.\n", "  Microwave cavities have been widely used to investigate the behavior of\nclosed few-level systems. Here, we show that they also represent a powerful\nprobe for the dynamics of charge transfer between a discrete electronic level\nand fermionic continua. We have combined experiment and theory for a carbon\nnanotube quantum dot coupled to normal metal and superconducting contacts. In\nequilibrium conditions, where our device behaves as an effective quantum\ndot-normal metal junction, we approach a universal photon dissipation regime\ngoverned by a quantum charge relaxation effect. We observe how photon\ndissipation is modified when the dot admittance turns from capacitive to\ninductive. When the fermionic reservoirs are voltage biased, the dot can even\ncause photon emission due to inelastic tunneling to/from a\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer peak in the density of states of the superconducting\ncontact. We can model these numerous effects quantitatively in terms of the\ncharge susceptibility of the quantum dot circuit. This validates an approach\nthat could be used to study a wide class of mesoscopic QED devices.\n", "  We propose a pattern recognition method that identifies the common tangent\nlines of a set of ellipses. The detection of the tangent lines is attained by\napplying the Legendre transform on a given set of ellipses. As context, we\nconsider a hypothetical detector made out of layers of chambers, each of which\nreturns an ellipse as an output signal. The common tangent of these ellipses\nrepresents the trajectory of a charged particle crossing the detector. The\nproposed method is evaluated using ellipses constructed from Monte Carlo\ngenerated tracks.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes have been famous since their discovery twenty years ago for\ntheir remarkable physical properties, from strength a hundred times higher than\nsteel, to electrical current capacity a 1,000 times higher than copper. But so\nfar they have only been produced at most up to centimeter lengths.\n  Here are presented some proposals to combine the nanotubes in such a way to\nget arbitrarily long lengths while maintaining their extraordinary physical\nproperties.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems always play a negative role in wave manipulations due\nto inherent non-conservation of energy as well as loss of information.\nRecently, however, there has been a paradigm shift on utilizing non-Hermitian\nsystems to implement varied miraculous wave controlling. For example,\nparity-time symmetric media with well-designed loss and gain are presented to\ncreate a nontrivial effect of unidirectional diffraction, which is observed\nnear the exceptional points (EPs) in the non-Hermitian systems. Here, we report\nthe design and realization of non-Hermitian acoustic metamaterial (NHAM) and\nshow that by judiciously tailoring the inherent loss, the phase and amplitude\nof reflection can possibly be tuned in a decoupled manner. Such decoupled\ntuning of phase and amplitude is closely related to the EPs. As a demonstration\nof functionality, we experimentally generate a high-quality acoustic hologram\nvia NHAM. Our work may open a new degree of freedom for realizing the complete\ncontrol of sound.\n", "  We consider a system of two cubic-quintic non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equations\nin two dimensions, coupled by repulsive cubic terms. We analyse situations in\nwhich a probe lump of one of the modes is surrounded by a fluid of the other\none and analyse their interaction. We find a realization of D'Alembert's\nparadox for small velocities and non-trivial drag forces for larger ones. We\npresent numerical analysis including the search of static and traveling\nform-preserving solutions along with simulations of the dynamical evolution in\nsome representative examples.\n", "  In recent years researchers have gravitated to social media platforms,\nespecially Twitter, as fertile ground for empirical analysis of social\nphenomena. Social media provides researchers access to trace data of\ninteractions and discourse that once went unrecorded in the offline world.\nResearchers have sought to use these data to explain social phenomena both\nparticular to social media and applicable to the broader social world. This\npaper offers a minireview of Twitter-based research on political crowd\nbehavior. This literature offers insight into particular social phenomena on\nTwitter, but often fails to use standardized methods that permit interpretation\nbeyond individual studies. Moreover, the literature fails to ground\nmethodologies and results in social or political theory, divorcing empirical\nresearch from the theory needed to interpret it. Rather, papers focus primarily\non methodological innovations for social media analyses, but these too often\nfail to sufficiently demonstrate the validity of such methodologies. This\nminireview considers a small number of selected papers; we analyze their (often\nlack of) theoretical approaches, review their methodological innovations, and\noffer suggestions as to the relevance of their results for political scientists\nand sociologists.\n", "  The introduction of magnetism in SnTe-class topological crystalline\ninsulators is a challenging subject with great importance in the quantum device\napplications. Based on the first-principles calculations, we have studied the\ndefect energetics and magnetic properties of 3d transition-metal (TM)-doped\nSnTe. We find that the doped TM atoms prefer to stay in the neutral states and\nhave comparatively high formation energies, suggesting that the uniform TM\ndoping in SnTe with a higher concentration will be difficult unless clustering.\nIn the dilute doping regime, all the magnetic TM atoms are in the high-spin\nstates, indicating that the spin splitting energy of 3d TM is stronger than the\ncrystal splitting energy of the SnTe ligand. Importantly, Mn-doped SnTe has\nrelatively low defect formation energy, largest local magnetic moment, and no\ndefect levels in the bulk gap, suggesting that Mn is a promising magnetic\ndopant to realize the magnetic order for the theoretically-proposed\nlarge-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in SnTe.\n", "  The resources needed to conventionally characterize a quantum system are\noverwhelmingly large for high- dimensional systems. This obstacle may be\novercome by abandoning traditional cornerstones of quantum measurement, such as\ngeneral quantum states, strong projective measurement, and assumption-free\ncharacterization. Following this reasoning, we demonstrate an efficient\ntechnique for characterizing high-dimensional, spatial entanglement with one\nset of measurements. We recover sharp distributions with local, random\nfiltering of the same ensemble in momentum followed by position---something the\nuncertainty principle forbids for projective measurements. Exploiting the\nexpectation that entangled signals are highly correlated, we use fewer than\n5,000 measurements to characterize a 65, 536-dimensional state. Finally, we use\nentropic inequalities to witness entanglement without a density matrix. Our\nmethod represents the sea change unfolding in quantum measurement where methods\ninfluenced by the information theory and signal-processing communities replace\nunscalable, brute-force techniques---a progression previously followed by\nclassical sensing.\n", "  Hexagonally aligned, free-standing silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays serve as\nphotonic resonators which, as compared to a silicon (Si) thin film, do not only\nabsorb more visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light, but also show an\ninherent photonic light concentration that enhances their performance as solar\nabsorbers. Using numerical simulations we show, how light concentration is\ninduced by high optical cross sections of the individual SiNWs but cannot be\noptimized independently of the SiNW array absorption. While an ideal spatial\ndensity exists, for which the SiNW array absorption for VIS and NIR wavelengths\nreaches a maximum, the spatial correlation of SiNWs in an array suppresses the\nformation of optical Mie modes responsible for light concentration. We show\nthat different from SiNWs with straight sidewalls, arrays of inverted silicon\nnanocones (SiNCs) permit to avoid the mode suppression. In fact they give rise\nto an altered set of photonic modes which is induced by the spatial correlation\nof SiNCs in the array, and therefore show a higher degree of freedom to\nindependently optimize light absorption and light concentration. Apart from\nexplaining the good light absorbing and concentrating properties of SiNC\narrays, the work justifies a revaluation of SiNW arrays as optical absorbers.\n", "  The thermal conductivity of polycrystalline bulk PZT\n(lead-zirconate-titanate) has been investigated according to electrical\nboundary conditions and poling. The thermal conductivity of poled PZT was\nmeasured in the poling direction for open circuit and short circuit conditions.\nThe short circuit thermal conductivity had the largest thermal conductivity.\nThe relationship between these two thermal properties, the electrothermal\ncoupling factor $k_{33}^{\\kappa}$, was found to be similar to the\nelectromechanical coupling factor $k_{33}$ relating elastic compliance under\nshort circuit and open circuit conditions. The thermal conductivity of the\nunpoled sample was found to have the lowest thermal conductivity. The\nsignificance of the thermal conductivity with regards to phonon mode scattering\nand elastic compliance was discussed.\n", "  We report the superconductivity at Tc ~ 0.049 K in Laves phase HfZn2. Based\non the first principles method we have studied the details structural and\nelectronic properties of HfZn2 according to which there are 4.67 states eV-1\nfu-1 at Fermi level. Using this value we calculate the specific heat\ncoefficient {\\gamma} theoretically as 10.97 mJ/ K2 mol and then systematically\ncalculate the electron-phonon coupling constant {\\lambda} as 0.45. Finally\napplying these values in McMillan formula we get the superconducting critical\ntemperature of HfZn2 as approximately 0.049 K.\n", "  Collisionless shocks vary drastically from terrestrial to astrophysical\nregimes resulting in radically different characteristics. This poses two\ncomplexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on\nphysical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating\nobservations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span\nacross different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since\nthe majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova\nremnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by\nmeans of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow\nshock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft. We find\nthat Saturn's bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and\nastrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the\nupstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we determined the {\\theta}Bn of\neach crossing to show that Saturn's (dayside) bow shock is predominantly\nquasi-perpendicular by virtue of the Parker spiral at 10 AU. Our results\nsuggest a strong dependence on MA in controlling the onset of physical\nmechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly non-time stationarity and\nvariability. We anticipate our comprehensive assessment will yield deeper\ninsight into high MA collisionless shocks and provide a broader scope for\nunderstanding the structures and mechanisms of collisionless shocks.\n", "  The present status of neutrino cross section physics is reviewed focusing on\nthe recent theoretical developments in quasielastic scattering, multi-nucleon\ncontributions to the inclusive scattering and pion production on nucleons and\nnuclei. A good understanding of these processes is crucial to meet the\nprecision needs of neutrino oscillation experiments. Some of the challenges\nthat arise in the consistent description of MiniBooNE and MINERvA recent data\nare discussed.\n", "  QUBIC is a ground-based experiment, currently under construction, that uses\nthe novel bolometric interferometry technology. It is dedicated to measure the\nprimordial B-modes of CMB. As a bolometric interferometer, QUBIC has high\nsensitivity and good systematics control. Dust contamination is controlled by\noperating with two bands -- 150 and 220 GHz. There are two possible sites for\nQUBIC: either Concordia station in Antarctic or in the Argentinian Puna desert.\nIt is planned to see the first light in 2018-2019.\n", "  Air transport systems are highly dynamic at temporal scales from minutes to\nyears. This dynamic behavior not only characterizes the evolution of the system\nbut also affect the system's functioning. Understanding the evolutionary\nmechanisms is thus fundamental in order to better design optimal air transport\nnetworks that benefits companies, passengers and the environment. In this\nreview, we briefly present and discuss the state-of-art on time-evolving air\ntransport networks. We distinguish the structural analysis of sequences of\nnetwork snapshots, ideal for long-term network evolution (e.g. annual\nevolution), and temporal paths, preferred for short-term dynamics (e.g. hourly\nevolution). We emphasize that most previous research focused on the first\nmodeling approach (i.e. long-term) whereas only a few studies look at\nhigh-resolution temporal paths. We conclude the review highlighting that much\nresearch remains to be done, both to apply already available methods and to\ndevelop new measures for temporal paths on air transport networks. In\nparticular, we identify that the study of delays, network resilience and\noptimization of resources (aircraft and crew) are critical topics that can\nbenefit of temporal network analysis.\n", "  Very small synthetic motors that make use of chemical reactions to propel\nthemselves in solution hold promise for new applications in the development of\nnew materials, science and medicine. The prospect of such potential\napplications, along with the fact that systems with many motors or active\nelements display interesting cooperative phenomena of fundamental interest, has\nmade the study of synthetic motors an active research area. Janus motors,\ncomprising catalytic and noncatalytic hemispheres, figure prominently in\nexperimental and theoretical studies of these systems. While continuum models\nof Janus particle systems are often used to describe motor dynamics,\nmicroscopic models that are able to account for intermolecular interactions,\nmany-body concentration gradients, fluid flows and thermal fluctuations provide\na way to explore the dynamical behavior of these complex out-of-equilibrium\nsystems that does not rely on approximations that are often made in continuum\ntheories. The analysis of microscopic models from first principles provides a\nfoundation from which the range of validity and limitations of approximate\ntheories of the dynamics may be assessed. In this paper, a microscopic model\nfor the diffusiophoretic propulsion of Janus motors, where motor interactions\nwith the environment occur only through hard collisions, is constructed,\nanalyzed and compared to theoretical predictions. Microscopic simulations of\nboth single-motor and many-motor systems are carried out to illustrate the\nresults.\n", "  We present a microcavity structure with a shifted photonic stop-band to\nenable efficient non-resonant injection of a polariton condensate with\nspectrally broad femtosecond pulses. The concept is demonstrated theoretically\nand confirmed experimentally for a planar GaAs/AlGaAs multilayer\nheterostructure pumped with ultrashort near-infrared pulses while\nphotoluminescence is collected to monitor the optically injected polariton\ndensity. As the excitation wavelength is scanned, a regime of polariton\ncondensation can be reached in our structure at a consistently lower fluence\nthreshold than in a state-of-the-art conventional microcavity. Our microcavity\ndesign improves the polariton injection efficiency by a factor of 4, as\ncompared to a conventional microcavity design, when broad excitation pulses are\ncentered at a wavelength of 740 nm. Most remarkably, this improvement factor\nreaches 270 when the excitation wavelength is centered at 750 nm.\n", "  Charged excitations of the oligoacene family of molecules, relevant for\nastrophysics and technological applications, are widely studied and therefore\nprovide an excellent system for benchmarking theoretical methods. In this work,\nwe evaluate the performance of many-body perturbation theory within the GW\napproximation relative to new high-quality CCSD(T) reference data for charged\nexcitations of the acenes. We compare GW calculations with a number of hybrid\ndensity functional theory starting points and with eigenvalue self-consistency.\nSpecial focus is given to elucidating the trend of GW-predicted excitations\nwith molecule length increasing from benzene to hexacene. We find that GW\ncalculations with starting points based on an optimally tuned range-separated\nhybrid (OTRSH) density functional and eigenvalue self-consistency can yield\nquantitative ionization potentials for the acenes. However, for larger acenes,\nthe predicted electron affinities can deviate considerably from reference\nvalues. Our work paves the way for predictive and cost-effective GW\ncalculations of charged excitations of molecules and identifies certain\nlimitations of current GW methods used in practice for larger molecules.\n", "  The design and scale of a future mission to directly image and characterize\npotentially Earth-like planets will be impacted, to some degree, by the\nexpected yield of such planets. Recent efforts to increase the estimated\nyields, by creating observation plans optimized for the detection and\ncharacterization of Earth-twins, have focused solely on coronagraphic\ninstruments; starshade-based missions could benefit from a similar analysis.\nHere we explore how to prioritize observations for a starshade given the\nlimiting resources of both fuel and time, present analytic expressions to\nestimate fuel use, and provide efficient numerical techniques for maximizing\nthe yield of starshades. We implemented these techniques to create an\napproximate design reference mission code for starshades and used this code to\ninvestigate how exoEarth candidate yield responds to changes in mission,\ninstrument, and astrophysical parameters for missions with a single starshade.\nWe find that a starshade mission operates most efficiently somewhere between\nthe fuel- and exposure-time limited regimes, and as a result, is less sensitive\nto photometric noise sources as well as parameters controlling the photon\ncollection rate in comparison to a coronagraph. We produced optimistic yield\ncurves for starshades, assuming our optimized observation plans are schedulable\nand future starshades are not thrust-limited. Given these yield curves,\ndetecting and characterizing several dozen exoEarth candidates requires either\nmultiple starshades or an eta_Earth > ~0.3.\n", "  Once a star leaves the main sequence and becomes a red giant, its Habitable\nZone (HZ) moves outward, promoting detectable habitable conditions at larger\norbital distances. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective climate and\nstellar evolutionary models to calculate post-MS HZ distances for a grid of\nstars from 3,700K to 10,000K (~M1 to A5 stellar types) for different stellar\nmetallicities. The post-MS HZ limits are comparable to the distances of known\ndirectly imaged planets. We model the stellar as well as planetary atmospheric\nmass loss during the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nphases for super-Moons to super-Earths. A planet can stay between 200 million\nyears up to 9 Gyr in the post-MS HZ for our hottest and coldest grid stars,\nrespectively, assuming solar metallicity. These numbers increase for increased\nstellar metallicity. Total atmospheric erosion only occurs for planets in\nclose-in orbits. The post-MS HZ orbital distances are within detection\ncapabilities of direct imaging techniques.\n", "  Strong interaction of a system of quantum emitters (e.g., two-level atoms)\nwith electromagnetic field induces specific correlations in the system\naccompanied by a drastic insrease of emitted radiation (superradiation or\nsuperfluorescence). Despite the fact that since its prediction this phenomenon\nwas subject to a vigorous experimental and theoretical research, there remain\nopen question, in particular, concerning the possibility of a first order phase\ntransition to the superradiant state from the vacuum state. In systems of\nnatural and charge-based artificial atome this transition is prohibited by\n\"no-go\" theorems. Here we demonstrate numerically a similar transition in a\none-dimensional quantum metamaterial - a chain of artificial atoms (qubits)\nstrongly interacting with classical electromagnetic fields in a transmission\nline. The system switches from vacuum state with zero classical electromagnetic\nfields and all qubits being in the ground state to the quasi-superradiant (QS)\nphase with one or several magnetic solitons and finite average occupation of\nqubit excited states along the transmission line. A quantum metamaterial in the\nQS phase circumvents the \"no-go\" restrictions by considerably decreasing its\ntotal energy relative to the vacuum state by exciting nonlinear electromagnetic\nsolitons with many nonlinearly coupled electromagnetic modes in the presence of\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  Condensation of bosons causes spectacular phenomena such as superfluidity or\nsuperconductivity. Understanding the nature of the condensed particles is\ncrucial for active control of such quantum phases. Fascinating possibilities\nemerge from condensates of light-matter coupled excitations, such as exciton\npolaritons, photons hybridized with hydrogen-like bound electron-hole pairs. So\nfar, only the photon component has been resolved, while even the mere existence\nof excitons in the condensed regime has been challenged. Here we trace the\nmatter component of polariton condensates by monitoring intra-excitonic\nterahertz transitions. We study how a reservoir of optically dark excitons\nforms and feeds the degenerate state. Unlike atomic gases, the atom-like\ntransition in excitons is dramatically renormalized upon macroscopic ground\nstate population. Our results establish fundamental differences between\npolariton condensation and photon lasing and open possibilities for coherent\ncontrol of condensates.\n", "  Big data applications, such as medical imaging and genetics, typically\ngenerate datasets that consist of few observations n on many more variables p,\na scenario that we denote as p>>n. Traditional data processing methods are\noften insufficient for extracting information out of big data. This calls for\nthe development of new algorithms that can deal with the size, complexity, and\nthe special structure of such datasets. In this paper, we consider the problem\nof classifying p>>n data and propose a classification method based on linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA). Traditional LDA depends on the covariance estimate\nof the data, but when p>>n the sample covariance estimate is singular. The\nproposed method estimates the covariance by using a sparse version of noisy\nprincipal component analysis (nPCA). The use of sparsity in this setting aims\nat automatically selecting variables that are relevant for classification. In\nexperiments, the new method is compared to state-of-the art methods for big\ndata problems using both simulated datasets and imaging genetics datasets.\n", "  The viscosity of Graphene nano-sheet suspensions (GNS)and its behavior with\ntemperature and concentration have been experimentally determined. A physical\nmechanism for the enhanced viscosity over the base fluids has been proposed for\nthe poly-dispersed GNSs. Experimental data reveals that enhancement of\nviscosity for GNSs lie in between that of Carbon Nanotube Suspensions (CNTSs)\nand nano Alumina suspensions (nAS) , indicating the hybrid mechanism of\npercolation (like CNTs) and Brownian motion assisted sheet dynamics (like\nAlumina particles). Sheet dynamics and percolation, along with a proposed\npercolation Network Dynamicity Factor; have been used to determine a\ndimensionally consistent analytical model to accurately determine and explain\nthe viscosity of poly-dispersed GNSs. It has been hypothesized that the dynamic\nsheets behave qualitatively analogous to gas molecules. The model also provides\ninsight into the mechanisms of viscous behavior of different dilute\nnanoparticle suspensions. The model has been found to be in agreement with the\nGNS experimental data, and even for CNT and nano Alumina suspensions.\n", "  Notch stress intensity factors and stress intensity factors are obtained\nanalytically for isotoxal star-shaped polygonal voids and rigid inclusions (and\nalso for the corresponding limit cases of star-shaped cracks and stiffeners),\nwhen loaded through remote inhomogeneous (self-equilibrated, polynomial)\nantiplane shear stress in an infinite linear elastic matrix. Usually these\nsolutions show stress singularities at the inclusion corners. It is shown that\nan infinite set of geometries and loading conditions exist for which not only\nthe singularity is absent, but the stress vanishes ('annihilates') at the\ncorners. Thus the material, which even without the inclusion corners would have\na finite stress, remains unstressed at these points in spite of the applied\nremote load. Moreover, similar conditions are determined in which a star-shaped\ncrack or stiffener leaves the ambient stress completely unperturbed, thus\nreaching a condition of 'quasi-static invisibility'. Stress annihilation and\ninvisibility define optimal loading modes for the overall strength of a\ncomposite and are useful for designing ultra-resistant materials.\n", "  We formulate a theory based on the time-dependent Ginzburg Landau (TDGL)\ntheory and Newtonian vortex dynamics to study the transverse acousto-electric\nresponse of a type-II superconductor with Abrikosov vortex lattice. When\nexposed to a transverse acoustic wave, Cooper pairs emerge from the the moving\natomic lattice and moving electrons. As in the Tolman-Stewart effect in a\nnormal metal, an electromagnetic field is radiated from the superconductor. We\nadapt the equilibrium-based TDGL theory to this non-equilibrium system by using\na floating condensation kernel. Due to the interaction between normal and\nsuperconducting components, the radiated electric field as a function of\nmagnetic field attains a maximum value occurring below the upper critical\nmagnetic field. This local increase in electric field has weak temperature\ndependence and is suppressed by the presence of impurities in the\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Let $\\G$ be a locally compact group satisfying some technical requirements\nand $\\wG$ its unitary dual. Using the theory of twisted crossed product\n$C^*$-algebras, we develop a twisted global quantization for symbols defined on\n$\\G\\times\\wG$ and taking operator values. The emphasis is on the\nrepresentation-theoretic aspect. For nilpotent Lie groups, the connection is\nmade with a scalar quantization of the cotangent bundle $T^*(\\G)$ and with a\nQuantum Mechanical theory of observables in the presence of variable magnetic\nfields.\n", "  These notions in the title are of fundamental importance in any branch of\nphysics. However, there have been great difficulties in finding physically\nacceptable definitions of them in general relativity since Einstein's time. I\nshall explain these difficulties and progresses that have been made. In\nparticular, I shall introduce new definitions of center of mass and angular\nmomentum at both the quasi-local and total levels, which are derived from first\nprinciples in general relativity and by the method of geometric analysis. With\nthese new definitions, the classical formula p=mv is shown to be consistent\nwith Einstein's field equation for the first time. This paper is based on joint\nwork [14][15] with Po-Ning Chen and Shing-Tung Yau.\n", "  We propose a fault-tolerant implementation of the quantum Householder\nreflection, which is a key operation in various quantum algorithms,\nquantum-state engineering, generation of arbitrary unitaries, and entanglement\ncharacterization. We construct this operation using the modular approach of\ncomposite pulses and a relation between the Householder reflection and the\nquantum phase gate. The proposed implementation is highly insensitive to\nvariations in the experimental parameters, which makes it suitable for\nhigh-fidelity quantum information processing.\n", "  Many types of stars have strong magnetic fields that can dynamically\ninfluence the flow of circumstellar matter. In stars with accretion disks, the\nstellar magnetic field can truncate the inner disk and determine the paths that\nmatter can take to flow onto the star. These paths are different in stars with\ndifferent magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the\nmagnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the\npropeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.\nOutflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating\nstars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,\nstrongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or\npropagation of stellar wind outflows. Winds from low-mass, solar-type stars may\nbe either thermally or magnetically driven, while winds from massive, luminous\nO and B type stars are radiatively driven. In all of these cases, the magnetic\nfield influences matter flow from the stars and determines many observational\nproperties. In this chapter we review recent studies of accretion, outflows,\nand winds of magnetized stars with a focus on three main topics: (1) accretion\nonto magnetized stars; (2) outflows from the disk-magnetosphere boundary; and\n(3) winds from isolated massive magnetized stars. We show results obtained from\nglobal magnetohydrodynamic simulations and, in a number of cases compare global\nsimulations with observations.\n", "  We use radiation hydrodynamics with direct particle integration to explore\nthe feasibility of chondrule formation in planetary embryo bow shocks. The\ncalculations presented here are used to explore the consequences of a Mars-size\nplanetary embryo traveling on a moderately excited orbit through the dusty,\nearly environment of the solar system. The embryo's eccentric orbit produces a\nrange of supersonic relative velocities between the embryo and the circularly\norbiting gas and dust, prompting the formation of bow shocks. Temporary\natmospheres around these embryos, which can be created via volatile outgassing\nand gas capture from the surrounding nebula, can non-trivially affect thermal\nprofiles of solids entering the shock. We explore the thermal environment of\nsolids that traverse the bow shock at different impact radii, the effects that\nplanetoid atmospheres have on shock morphologies, and the stripping efficiency\nof planetoidal atmospheres in the presence of high relative winds. Simulations\nare run using adiabatic and radiative conditions, with multiple treatments for\nthe local opacities. Shock speeds of 5, 6, and 7 km/s are explored. We find\nthat a high-mass atmosphere and inefficient radiative conditions can produce\npeak temperatures and cooling rates that are consistent with the constraints\nset by chondrule furnace studies. For most conditions, the derived cooling\nrates are potentially too high to be consistent with chondrule formation.\n", "  We utilize group-theoretical methods to develop a matrix representation of\ndifferential operators that act on tensors of any rank. In particular, we\nconcentrate on the matrix formulation of the curl operator. A self-adjoint\nmatrix of the curl operator is constructed and its action is extended to a\ncomplex plane. This scheme allows us to obtain properties, similar to those of\nthe traditional curl operator.\n", "  The Laguerre functions constitute one of the fundamental basis sets for\ncalculations in atomic and molecular electron-structure theory, with\napplications in hadronic and nuclear theory as well. While similar in form to\nthe Coulomb bound-state eigenfunctions (from the Schroedinger eigenproblem) or\nthe Coulomb-Sturmian functions (from a related Sturm-Liouville problem), the\nLaguerre functions, unlike these former functions, constitute a complete,\ndiscrete, orthonormal set for square-integrable functions in three dimensions.\nWe construct the SU(1,1)xSO(3) dynamical algebra for the Laguerre functions and\napply the ideas of factorization (or supersymmetric quantum mechanics) to\nderive shift operators for these functions. We use the resulting algebraic\nframework to derive analytic expressions for matrix elements of several basic\nradial operators (involving powers of the radial coordinate and radial\nderivative) in the Laguerre function basis. We illustrate how matrix elements\nfor more general spherical tensor operators in three dimensional space, such as\nthe gradient, may then be constructed from these radial matrix elements.\n", "  Super-antiwettability is an extreme situation of wetting where liquids stay\nat the tops of rough surfaces, in the so-called Cassie state1. Owing to the\ndramatic reduction of solid/liquid contact, it has many applications, such as\nantifouling2,3, droplet manipulation4,5, and self-cleaning6-9. However,\nsuper-antiwettability is often destroyed by impalement transitions caused by\nenvironmental disturbances10-16 while inverse transitions without energy input\nhave never been observed12,17-21. Here we show through controlled experiments\nthat there is a \"monostable\" region in the phase space of the receding contact\nangle and roughness parameters where transitions between (impaled) Wenzel and\nCassie states can be reversible. We describe the transition mechanism and\nestablish a simple criterion that predicts the experimentally observed\nWenzel-to-Cassie transitions for different liquids placed on\nmicropost-patterned substrates. These results can guide for designing and\nengineering robust super-antiwetting surfaces.\n", "  We consider quantum search on graphs. Recently, it has been shown that the\ngraph properties like connectivity, global symmetry, or regularity cannot serve\nas a reliable criteria that must be satisfied by a graph to allow a successful\nquantum search. It is an open question whether it is possible to find such a\ncriteria. We solve this question by giving an affirmative answer.\n", "  We report the dispersion coefficients for the interacting inert gas atoms\nwith the alkali ions, alkaline earth ions and alkali atoms with their singly\ncharged ions. We use our relativistic coupled-cluster method to determine\ndynamic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the alkali atoms and singly\nionized alkaline earth atoms, whereas a relativistic random phase approximation\napproach has been adopted to evaluate these quantities for the closed-shell\nconfigured inert gas atoms and the singly and doubly ionized alkali and\nalkaline earth atoms, respectively. Accuracies of these results are adjudged\nfrom the comparison of their static polarizability values with their respective\nexperimental results. These polarizabilities are further compared with the\nother theoretical results. Reason for the improvement in the accuracies of our\nestimated dispersion coefficients than the data listed in [At. Data and Nucl.\nData Tables 101, 58 (2015)] are discussed. Results for some of the atom-ion\ninteracting systems were not available earlier, these results and the other\nreported improved results will be very useful for the comprehensive\nunderstanding of the collisional physics involving these atom-atom and atom-ion\ninteractions in the cold atom and atom-ion hybrid trapping experiments at the\nlow-temperature regime.\n", "  A brief summary of the recent next-to-leading order QCD calculation for e+ ve\nmu- v_mu bb~ j at the LHC is given. Our computation includes all non-resonant\ncontributions, off-shell effects and interferences for top-quarks and W gauge\nbosons. Some results for integrated and differential cross sections are shown\nfor the LHC Run1 energy of 8 TeV. A significant reduction of the scale\ndependence is observed, which indicates that the perturbative expansion is well\nunder control. The results are obtained in the framework of the HELAC-NLO\nsystem.\n", "  The results of magnetic investigations on a new series of compounds,\nMn2R3Sb3O14, containing 2-dimensional Kagome lattice of R ions and belonging to\npyrochlore series, are presented. Crystallographic features of light R members\n(R= La, Pr and Nd) of this family, as established in the recent literature,\nhave been reported to be novel in many respects, in particular, the rhomohedral\nnature of the structure which is rare among pyrochlores. It was also reported\nthat, as the R becomes heavier, beyond R= Sm, the fraction of well-known cubic\npyrochlore phase tends to gradually dominate. Here, we report that we are able\nto form the Gd member in the rhombohedral form without noticeable admixture\nfrom the cubic phase. With respect to magnetic behavior, our magnetization\nmeasurements on the La member reveal that Mn exists in divalent state without\nany evidence for long range magnetic ordering down to 2 K (that is, suppressed\nmagnetism), which is not so common for Mn based oxides, though\nantiferromagnerism below 2 K is not ruled out. Nd and Gd members, are however,\nfound to show distinct features above 2 K in magnetic susceptibility and\nheat-capacity, attributable to long-range magnetic ordering from respective\nrare-earth sublattice. The experimental results with respect to magnetism are\nfound to be consistent with the results from ab initio band structure\ncalculations performed for the La case. The calculations imply that electron\ncorrelation is important to describe insulating behavior.\n", "  We solve the inverse spectral problem for rotationally symmetric manifolds,\nwhich include the class of surfaces of revolution, by giving an analytic\nisomorphism from the space of spectral data onto the space of functions\ndescribing the radius of rotation. An analogue of the Minkowski problem is also\nsolved.\n", "  In this work we study the effect of the nuclear tensor force on properties\nrelated with deformation. We focus on isotopes in the Mg, Si, S, Ar, Sr and Zr\nchains within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory using the D1ST2a Gogny\ninteraction. Contributions to the tensor energy in terms of saturated and\nunsaturated subshells are analyzed. Like-particle and proton-neutron parts of\nthe tensor term are independently examinated. We found that the tensor term may\nconsiderably modify the potential energy landscapes and change the ground state\nshape. We analyze too how the pairing characteristics of the ground state\nchange when the tensor force is included.\n", "  The assembly of complex structures is driven by an interplay between several\nintermolecular interactions, from strong covalent bonds to weaker dispersion\nforces. Surface-based self-assembly is particularly amenable to modeling and\nmeasuring these interactions in well-defined systems. This study focuses on\n2-butanol, the simplest aliphatic chiral alcohol. 2-butanol shows interesting\nproperties as a chiral modifier of surface chemistry, however, its mode of\naction is not fully understood. In order to probe its surface properties we\nemployed high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT simulations. We\nfound a surprisingly rich degree of enantiospecific adsorption, association,\nchiral cluster growth and ultimately long range, highly ordered chiral\ntemplating. Firstly, the chiral molecules acquire a second chiral center when\nadsorbed to the surface via dative bonding of one of the oxygen atom lone\npairs. This interaction is controlled via the molecule's intrinsic chiral\ncenter leading to monomers of like chirality, at both chiral centers, adsorbed\non the surface. The monomers then associate into tetramers via a cyclical\nnetwork of hydrogen bonds with an opposite chirality at the oxygen atom. The\nevolution of these square units is surprising given that the underlying surface\nhas a hexagonal symmetry. Our DFT calculations reveal that the tetramers are\nable to associate with each other by weaker van der Waals interactions and\ntessellate in an extended square network. Our data reveals that the chirality\nof a simple alcohol can be transferred to its surface binding geometry, drive\nthe directionality of hydrogen bonds and ultimately extended structure.\nFurthermore, this study provides the first microscopic insight into the surface\nproperties of this important chiral modifier and provides a well-defined system\nfor studying the network's enantioselective interaction with other molecules.\n", "  The so called Telelateral Conformal Gravity (TCG) is a first order gauge\ntheory describing inertia as internal, scale invariant geometry. The Conformal\nAffine Theory (CAT) unifies other interactions into TCG in a minimalistic\nscheme via an exact holographic gauge-gravity duality. In the three parts of\nthis Letter, the currently topical bimetric gravity models are obtained as\nnon-inertial gauges in the CAT, the geometrisation of electromagnetism by\nHermann Weyl is brought to a completion, and it is sketched how the rest of the\nStandard Model could result from the assumption of a light cone, respectively.\nThe radically intuitive CAT suggests the possibility of further transgressive\nunification of sciences.\n", "  The detection of neutrinoless double-beta decay will establish the Majorana\nnature of neutrinos. In addition, if the nuclear matrix elements of this\nprocess are reliably known, the experimental lifetime will provide precious\ninformation about the absolute neutrino masses and hierarchy. I review the\nstatus of nuclear structure calculations for neutrinoless double-beta decay\nmatrix elements, and discuss some key issues to be addressed in order to meet\nthe demand for accurate nuclear matrix elements.\n", "  We show nanoscopic transmission microscopy, using a deterministic single\nparticle source and compare the resulting images in terms of signal-to-noise\nratio, with those of conventional Poissonian sources. Our source is realized by\ndeterministic extraction of laser-cooled calcium ions from a Paul trap. Gating\nby the extraction event allows for the suppression of detector dark counts by\nsix orders of magnitude. Using the Bayes experimental design method, the\ndeterministic characteristics of this source are harnessed to maximize\ninformation gain, when imaging structures with a parametrizable transmission\nfunction. We demonstrate such optimized imaging by determining parameter values\nof one and two dimensional transmissive structures.\n", "  Quasi-phase-matching (QPM) has enriched the capacity of parametric\ndown-conversion (PDC) in generating biphotons for many fundamental tests and\nadvanced applications. However, it is not clear how the nonidealities and\nrandomness in the QPM grating of a parametric down-converter may affect the\nquantum properties of the biphotons. This paper intends to provide insights\ninto the interplay between PDC and nonideal or random QPM structures. Using a\nperiodically poled nonlinear crystal with short periodicity, we conduct\nexperimental and theoretical studies of PDC subject to nonideal duty cycle and\nrandom errors in domain lengths. We report the observation of biphotons\nemerging through noncritical birefringent-phase-matching, which is impossible\nto occur in PDC with an ideal QPM grating, and a biphoton spectrum determined\nby the details of nonidealities and randomness. We also observed QPM biphotons\nwith a diminished strength. These features are both confirmed by our theory.\nOur work provides new perspectives for biphoton engineering with QPM.\n", "  Mixing of atoms at the interface was studied for Mn/Fe magnetic\nhetero-epitaxial layers on Cu(001) by scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy. The formation of a surface alloy was observed when the\nMn layer was thinner than 3 atomic layers. From the fourth layer, Fe\nsegregation is suppressed, and a pure Mn surface appears. Accordingly,\nspectroscopic measurements revealed the electronic difference between the\nsurface alloy and Mn layers. The surface electronic structure of the fourth Mn\nlayer is slightly different from that of the fifth layers, which is attributed\nto the hybridization of the fourth layer with the underneath Fe-Mn alloy.\n", "  CVSO 30 is a unique young low-mass system, because, for the first time, a\nclose-in transiting and a wide directly imaged planet candidates are found\naround a common host star. The inner companion, CVSO 30 b, is the first\npossible young transiting planet orbiting a previously known weak-lined T-Tauri\nstar. With five telescopes of the 'Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative' (YETI)\nlocated in Asia, Europe and South America we monitored CVSO 30 over three years\nin a total of 144 nights and detected 33 fading events. In two more seasons we\ncarried out follow-up observations with three telescopes. We can confirm that\nthere is a change in the shape of the fading event between different\nobservations and that the fading event even disappears and reappears. A total\nof 38 fading event light curves were simultaneously modelled. We derived the\nplanetary, stellar, and geometrical properties of the system and found them\nslightly smaller but in agreement with the values from the discovery paper. The\nperiod of the fading event was found to be 1.36 s shorter and 100 times more\nprecise than the previous published value. If CVSO 30 b would be a giant planet\non a precessing orbit, which we cannot confirm, yet, the precession period may\nbe shorter than previously thought. But if confirmed as a planet it would be\nthe youngest transiting planet ever detected and will provide important\nconstraints on planet formation and migration time-scales.\n", "  Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of thin a-Si:H layers on\ntransferred large area graphene is investigated. Radio frequency (RF, 13.56\nMHz) and very high frequency (VHF, 140 MHz) plasma processes are compared. Both\nmethods provide conformal coating of graphene with Si layers as thin as 20 nm\nwithout any additional seed layer. The RF plasma process results in\namorphization of the graphene layer. In contrast, the VHF process keeps the\nhigh crystalline quality of the graphene layer almost intact. Correlation\nanalysis of Raman 2D and G band positions indicates that Si deposition induces\nreduction of the initial doping in graphene and an increase of compressive\nstrain. Upon rapid thermal annealing the amorphous Si layer undergoes\ndehydrogenation and transformation into a polycrystalline film whereby a high\ncrystalline quality of graphene is preserved.\n", "  Layered molybdenum dichalchogenides are semiconductors whose gap is\ncontrolled by delicate interlayer interactions. The gap tends to drop together\nwith the interlayer distance, suggesting collapse and metallization under\npressure. We predict, based on first principles calculations, that layered\nsemiconductors 2H$_c$-MoSe$_2$ and 2H$_c$-MoTe$_2$ should undergo metallization\nat pressures between 28 and 40 GPa (MoSe$_2$) and 13 and 19 GPa (MoTe$_2$).\nUnlike MoS$_2$ where a 2H$_c$ $\\to$ 2H$_a$ layer sliding transition is known to\ntake place, these two materials appear to preserve the original 2H$_c$ layered\nstructure at least up to 100 GPa and to increasingly resist lubric layer\nsliding under pressure. Similar to metallized MoS$_2$ they are predicted to\nexhibit a low density of states at the Fermi level, and presumably very modest\nsuperconducting temperatures if any. We also study the $\\beta$-MoTe$_2$\nstructure, metastable with a higher enthalpy than 2H$_c$-MoTe$_2$. Despite its\nready semimetallic and (weakly) superconducting character already at zero\npressure, metallicity is not expected to increase dramatically with pressure.\n", "  In this paper, we study an inverse scattering problem at fixed energy on\nthree-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic St{\\\"a}ckel manifolds having the\ntopology of toric cylinders and satisfying the Robertson condition. On these\nmanifolds the Helmholtz equation can be separated into a system of a radial ODE\nand two angular ODEs. We can thus decompose the full scattering operator onto\ngeneralized harmonics and the resulting partial scattering matrices consist in\na countable set of $2 \\times 2$ matrices whose coefficients are the so-called\ntransmission and reflection coefficients. It is shown that the reflection\ncoefficients are nothing but generalized Weyl-Titchmarsh functions associated\nwith the radial ODE. Using a novel multivariable version of the Complex Angular\nMomentum method, we show that the knowledge of the scattering operator at a\nfixed non-zero energy is enough to determine uniquely the metric of the\nthree-dimensional St{\\\"a}ckel manifold up to natural obstructions.\n", "  Applying an expansion in spherical harmonics, turns the black hole with its\nmicrostates into something about as transparent as the hydrogen atom was in the\nearly days of quantum mechanics. It enables us to present a concise description\nof the evolution laws of these microstates, linking them to perturbative\nquantum field theory, in the background of the Schwarzschild metric. Three\npieces of insight are obtained: One, we learn how the gravitational back\nreaction, whose dominant component can be calculated exactly, turns particles\nentering the hole, into particles leaving it, by exchanging the momentum- and\nposition operators; two, we find out how this effect removes firewalls, both on\nthe future and the past event horizon, and three, we discover that the presence\nof region II in the Penrose diagram forces a topological twist in the\nbackground metric, culminating in antipodal identification. Although a cut-off\nis required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice,\nthe effect of such a cut-off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion is\napplied. This expansion then reveals exactly how antipodal identification\nrestores unitarity - for each partial wave separately. We expect that these\nideas will provide new insights in some highly non-trivial topological\nspace-time features at the Planck scale.\n", "  Recently there is strong experimental and theoretical interest in studying\nthe self-assembly and the phase behavior of patchy and of Janus particles,\nwhich form colloidal suspensions. Although in this quest a variety of effective\ninteractions have been proposed and used in order to achieve directed assembly,\nthe critical Casimir effect stands out as being particularly suitable in this\nrespect because it provides both attractive and repulsive interactions as well\nas the potential of a sensitive temperature control of their strength.\nSpecifically, we have calculated the critical Casimir force between a single\nJanus particle and a laterally homogeneous substrate as well as a substrate\nwith a chemical step. We have used the Derjaguin approximation and compared it\nwith results from full mean field theory. A modification of the Derjaguin\napproximation turns out to be generally reliable. Based on this approach we\nhave derived the effective force and the effective potential between two Janus\ncylinders as well as between two Janus spheres.\n", "  Extensive efforts have been devoted to the study of spin-orbit torque in\nferromagnetic metal/heavy metal bilayers and exploitation of it for\nmagnetization switching using an in-plane current. As the spin-orbit torque is\ninversely proportional to the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer, sizable\neffect has only been realized in bilayers with an ultrathin ferromagnetic\nlayer. Here we demonstrate that, by stacking ultrathin Pt and FeMn alternately,\nboth ferromagnetic properties and current induced spin-orbit torque can be\nachieved in FeMn/Pt multilayers without any constraint on its total thickness.\nThe critical behavior of these multilayers follows closely three-dimensional\nHeisenberg model with a finite Curie temperature distribution. The spin torque\neffective field is about 4 times larger than that of NiFe/Pt bilayer with a\nsame equivalent NiFe thickness. The self-current generated spin torque is able\nto switch the magnetization reversibly without the need for an external field\nor a thick heavy metal layer. The removal of both thickness constraint and\nnecessity of using an adjacent heavy metal layer opens new possibilities for\nexploiting spin-orbit torque for practical applications.\n", "  Guanxi, roughly translated as \"social connection\", is a term commonly used in\nthe Chinese language. In this research, we employed a linguistic approach to\nexplore popular discourses on Guanxi. Although sharing the same Confucian\nroots, Chinese communities inside and outside Mainland China have undergone\ndifferent historical trajectories. Hence, we took a comparative approach to\nexamine guanxi in Mainland China and in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (TW-HK-M).\nComparing guanxi discourses in two Chinese societies aims at revealing the\ndivergence of guanxi culture. The data for this research were collected on\nTwitter over a three-week period by searching tweets containing guanxi written\nin Simplified Chinese characters and in Traditional Chinese characters. After\nbuilding, visualising, and conducting community detection on both semantic\nnetworks, two guanxi discourses were then compared in terms of their major\nconcept sub-communities. This research aims at addressing two questions: Has\nthe meaning of guanxi transformed in contemporary Chinese societies? And how do\ndifferent socio-economic configurations affect the practice of guanxi? Results\nsuggest that guanxi in interpersonal relationships has adapted to a new family\nstructure in both Chinese societies. In addition, the practice of guanxi in\nbusiness varies in Mainland China and in TW-HK-M. Furthermore, an extended\ndomain was identified where guanxi is used in a macro-level discussion of state\nrelations. Network representations of the guanxi discourses enabled reification\nof the concept and shed lights on the understanding of social connections and\nsocial orders in contemporary China.\n", "  High-dimensional entanglement with spatial modes of light promises increased\nsecurity and information capacity over quantum channels. Unfortunately,\nentanglement decays due to perturbations, corrupting quantum links which cannot\nbe repaired without a tomography of the channel. Paradoxically, the channel\ntomography itself is not possible without a working link. Here we overcome this\nproblem with a robust approach to characterising quantum channels by means of\nclassical light. Using free-space communication in a turbulent atmosphere as an\nexample, we show that the state evolution of classically entangled degrees of\nfreedom is equivalent to that of quantum entangled pho- tons, thus providing\nnew physical insights into the notion of classical entanglement. The analysis\nof quantum channels by means of classical light in real time unravels\nstochastic dynamics in terms of pure state trajectories and thus enables\nprecise quantum error-correction in short and long haul optical communication,\nin both free-space and fibre.\n", "  The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is an effective hadronic model based\non the linear realization of chiral symmetry $SU(N_f)_L \\times SU(N_f)_R$, with\n(pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons as degrees of freedom. In this paper,\nwe study the low-energy limit of the eLSM for $N_f=2$ flavors by integrating\nout all fields except for the pions, the (pseudo-)Nambu--Goldstone bosons of\nchiral symmetry breaking. We only keep terms entering at tree level and up to\nfourth order in powers of derivatives of the pion fields. Up to this order,\nthere are four low-energy coupling constants in the resulting low-energy\neffective action. We show that the latter is formally identical to Chiral\nPerturbation Theory (ChPT), after choosing a representative for the coset space\ngenerated by chiral symmetry breaking and expanding up to fourth order in\npowers of derivatives of the pion fields. Two of the low-energy coupling\nconstants of the eLSM are uniquely determined by a fit to hadron masses and\ndecay widths. We find that their tree-level values are in reasonable agreement\nwith the corresponding low-energy coupling constants of ChPT. The other two\nlow-energy coupling constants are functions of parameters that can in principle\nbe determined by $\\pi\\pi$ scattering, which has not yet been studied within the\neLSM. Therefore, we use the respective values from ChPT to make a prediction\nfor the values of these parameters in the eLSM Lagrangian.\n", "  An optical teardown, or reverse engineering, of an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite\nelectrophoretic display was performed by Optical Coherence Tomography at 1060\nnm. The display incorporates an optical diffuser, lightguide and scattering\nlayers for white light illumination, capacitive touch sensing, and an\nelectrophoretic display. All these layers can be imaged by OCT as well as the\nthin film transistor array on the back side for driving the pixels. Phase\nsensitive OCT is used to measure motion of the pigment particles as the display\nchanges between black and white.\n", "  In steels and single-crystal superalloys the control of the formation of\ntopologically close-packed (TCP) phases is critical for the performance of the\nmaterial. The structural stability of TCP phases in multi-component\ntransition-metal alloys may be rationalised in terms of the average\nvalence-electron count $\\bar{N}$ and the composition-dependent relative\nvolume-difference $\\overline{\\Delta V/V}$. We elucidate the interplay of these\nfactors by comparing density-functional theory calculations to an empirical\nstructure map based on experimental data. In particular, we calculate the heat\nof formation for the TCP phases A15, C14, C15, C36, $\\chi$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$\nfor all possible binary occupations of the Wyckoff positions. We discuss the\nisovalent systems V/Nb-Ta to highlight the role of atomic-size difference and\nobserve the expected stabilisation of C14/C15/C36/$\\mu$ by $\\overline{\\Delta\nV/V}$ at $\\Delta N=0$ in V-Ta. In the systems V/Nb-Re, we focus on the\nwell-known trend of A15$- \\sigma - \\chi$ stability with increasing $\\bar{N}$\nand show that the influence of $\\overline{\\Delta V/V}$ is too weak to stabilise\nC14/C15/C36/$\\mu$ in Nb-Re. As an example for a significant influence of both\n$\\bar{N}$ and $\\overline{\\Delta V/V}$, we also consider the systems Cr/Mo-Co.\nHere the sequence A15$- \\sigma - \\chi$ is observed in both systems but in Mo-Co\nthe large size-mismatch stabilises C14/C15/C36/$\\mu$. We also include V/Nb-Co\nthat cover the entire valence range of TCP stability and also show the\nstabilisation of C14/C15/C36/$\\mu$. Moreover, the combination of a large volume\ndifference with a large mismatch in valence-electron count reduces the\nstability of the A15/$\\sigma$/$\\chi$ phases in Nb-Co as compared to V-Co. By\ncomparison to non-magnetic calculations we also find that magnetism is of minor\nimportance for the structural stability of TCP phases in Cr/Mo-Co and in\nV/Nb-Co.\n", "  The hypothesis of dark matter interacting with the standard model uniquely\nvia the Higgs portal is severely challenged by experiments. However, if dark\nmatter is a fermion, the Higgs-portal interaction implies the presence of\nmediators, which can change the phenomenology significantly. This article\ndiscusses the impact of weakly-interacting mediators on the dark-matter relic\nabundance, direct detection, and collider searches. At the LHC, a typical\nsignature of Higgs-portal fermion dark matter features soft leptons and missing\nenergy, similarly to gaugino production in models with supersymmetry. We\nsuggest to re-interpret existing gaugino searches in the context of\nHiggs-portal models and to extend future searches to the broader class of dark\nsectors with weakly-interacting fermions.\n", "  Using the relativistic Eikonal approximation, we study the one and two photon\nexchange amplitudes in elastic electron-nucleon scattering for the case of\ntransversely polarized nucleons with unpolarized electrons beam. In our\napproach, we utilize the convolution theory of Fourier transforms and the\ntransverse charge density in transverse momentum space to evaluate the one and\ntwo photon exchange Eikonal amplitudes. The results obtained for the $2\\gamma$\namplitude in impact parameter space are compared to the corresponding 4D case.\nWe show that while the one and two photon cross sections are azimuthally\nsymmetric, the interference term between them is azimuthally asymmetric, which\nis an indication of an azimuthal single spin asymmetry for proton and neutron\nwhich can be attributed to the fact that the nucleon charge density is\ntransversely (azimuthally) distorted in the transverse plane for transversely\npolarized nucleons. In addition, the calculations of the interference term for\nproton and neutron show agreement in sign and magnitude of the existence data\nand calculations for transverse target single spin asymmetry.\n", "  We report about direct measurements of heat capacity of Majorana\nquasiparticles in superfluid ${^3}$He-B which appear near the surface of the\nexperimental bolometer on the coherence length ${\\xi}$. Two bolometers with\ndifferent surface-to-volume ratios were used which allows us to have different\ncalibrated contributions from Majorana quasiparticles to the ${^3}$He heat\ncapacity. Estimations of possible impact of ${^3}$He layers adsorbed on the\nwalls of the bolometer have been done.\n", "  Excitation of magnetization dynamics by pure spin currents has been recently\nrecognized as an enabling mechanism for spintronics and magnonics, which allows\nimplementation of spin-torque devices based on low-damping insulating magnetic\nmaterials. Here we report the first spatially-resolved study of the dynamic\nmodes excited by pure spin current in nanometer-thick microscopic insulating\nYttrium Iron Garnet disks. We show that these modes exhibit nonlinear\nself-broadening preventing the formation of the self-localized magnetic bullet,\nwhich plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the single-mode\nmagnetization oscillations in all-metallic systems. This peculiarity associated\nwith the efficient nonlinear mode coupling in low-damping materials can be\namong the main factors governing the interaction of pure spin currents with the\ndynamic magnetization in high-quality magnetic insulators.\n", "  This project is aimed at designing the fast forward projection algorithm and\nalso the backprojection algorithm for cone beam CT imaging systems with\ncircular X-ray source trajectory. The principle of the designs is based on\nutilizing the potential computational efficiency which the Fourier Slice\nTheorem and the Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) will bring forth. In\nthis Masters report, the detailed design of the NUFFT based forward projector\nincluding a novel 3D (derivative of) Radon space resampling method will be\ngiven. Meanwhile the complexity of the NUFFT based forward projector is\nanalysed and compared with the non-Fourier based CT projector, and the\nadvantage of the NUFFT based forward projection in terms of the computational\nefficiency is demonstrated in this report. Base on the design of the forward\nalgorithm, the NUFFT based 3D direct reconstruction algorithm will be derived.\nThe experiments will be taken to test the performance of the forward algorithm\nand the backprojection algorithm to show the practicability and accuracy of\nthese designs by comparing them jointly with the well-acknowledged cone beam CT\noperators: the CT linear interpolation forward projector and the FDK algorithm.\nThis Master report will demonstrate a novel and efficient way of implementing\nthe cone beam CT operator, a detailed summary of the project, and the future\nresearch prospects of the NUFFT based cone beam CT algorithms.\n", "  A new approach to double-sub equation method is introduced to construct novel\nsolutions for the nonlinear partial differential equations. It is applied to\nthe Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and yields new complexiton solutions of\nboth the KdV and coupled KdV equations. The graphs of the solutions are also\nillustrated.\n", "  Recent measurements at the LHC of the p-p total cross section have reduced\nthe uncertainty in simulations of cosmic ray air showers. In particular of the\ndepth of shower maximum, called $X_{max}$. However, uncertainties of other\nimportant parameters, in particular the multiplicity and elasticity of high\nenergy interactions, have not improved, and there is a remaining uncertainty\ndue to the total cross section. Uncertainties due to extrapolations from\naccelerator data, at a maximum energy of $\\sim$ one TeV in the p-p center of\nmass, to 250 TeV ($3\\times10^{19}$ eV in a cosmic ray proton's lab frame)\nintroduce significant uncertainties in predictions of $<X_{max}>$. In this\npaper we estimate a lower limit on these uncertainties. The result is that the\nuncertainty in $<X_{max}>$ is larger than the difference among the modern\nmodels being used in the field. At the full energy of the LHC, which is\nequivalent to $\\sim 1\\times10^{17}$ eV in the cosmic ray lab frame, the\nextrapolation is not as extreme, and the uncertainty is approximately equal to\nthe difference among the models.\n", "  The problem of consistency of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has\ndemanded considerable attention in the past few years due to the ever\nincreasing number of applications of the method in many areas of science and\nengineering. A loss of consistency leads to an inevitable loss of approximation\naccuracy. In this paper, we revisit the issue of SPH kernel and particle\nconsistency and demonstrate that SPH has a limiting second-order convergence\nrate. Numerical experiments with suitably chosen test functions validate this\nconclusion. In particular, we find that when using the root mean square error\nas a model evaluation statistics, well-known corrective SPH schemes, which were\nthought to converge to second, or even higher order, are actually first-order\naccurate, or at best close to second order. We also find that observing the\njoint limit when $N\\to\\infty$, $h\\to 0$, and $n\\to\\infty$, as was recently\nproposed by Zhu et al., where $N$ is the total number of particles, $h$ is the\nsmoothing length, and $n$ is the number of neighbor particles, standard SPH\nrestores full $C^{0}$ particle consistency for both the estimates of the\nfunction and its derivatives and becomes insensitive to particle disorder.\n", "  In our paper we derived the classical motion equation of electromagnetic\nfield in space with Higgs field and by means of it discussed the distributions\nof charge and current formed when the static electrical and magnetic fields are\ninteracting with the spherically symmetrical Higgs field, and predicted the\nelectrical polarizability of electron.\n", "  It is well known that the difference between the chemical potentials of\nleft-handed and right-handed particles in a parity violating (chiral) plasma\ncan lead to an instability. We show that the chiral instability may drive\nturbulent transport. Further we estimate the anomalous viscosity of chiral\nplasma arising from the enhanced collisionality due to turbulence.\n", "  We prove that critical percolation on any quasi-transitive graph of\nexponential volume growth does not have a unique infinite cluster. This allows\nus to deduce from earlier results that critical percolation on any graph in\nthis class does not have any infinite clusters. The result is new when the\ngraph in question is either amenable or nonunimodular.\n", "  We have studied laser pulse channeling in underdense plasma by means of\nanalytical theory and 3D PIC simulations. The most significant result of this\npaper is the demonstration of the single fully evacuated stationary channel\nsolution can be reached an asymptotic state in PIC simulations. In the lower\ndensity and for a laser power above channeling power, we were able to reproduce\nin PIC simulations the analytical curve. We showed that single channels are\nstable structures against symmetric perturbations. We also studied the\nformation of the ring structure in theory and simulations. An evacuated ring\nenclosed by an electron filament was observed in our 3D simulations. However\nthey always coexist with the main laser mode. The threshold power for ring\nstructure formation is found. Our studies on stability of the rings against\nasymmetric perturbations show that ring structure is not stable against\nazimuthal perturbations. The growth rate of the instability is shorter for\nhigher densities and it is therefore more effective at higher densities.\n", "  We compute the exact 4-spinon contribution to the zero-temperature dynamical\nstructure factor of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg isotropic antiferromagnet in zero\nmagnetic field, directly in the thermodynamic limit. We make use of the\nexpressions for matrix elements of local spin operators obtained by Jimbo and\nMiwa using the quantum affine symmetry of the model, and of their adaptation to\nthe isotropic case by Abada, Bougourzi and Si-Lakhal (correcting some overall\nfactors). The 4-spinon contribution to the first frequency moment sum rule at\nfixed momentum is calculated. This shows, as expected, that most of the\nremaining correlation weight above the known 2-spinon part is carried by\n4-spinon states. Our results therefore provide an extremely accurate\ndescription of the exact structure factor.\n", "  TSIL is a library of utilities for the numerical calculation of dimensionally\nregularized two-loop self-energy integrals. A convenient basis for these\nfunctions is given by the integrals obtained at the end of O.V. Tarasov's\nrecurrence relation algorithm. The program computes the values of all of these\nbasis functions, for arbitrary input masses and external momentum. When\nanalytical expressions in terms of polylogarithms are available, they are used.\nOtherwise, the evaluation proceeds by a Runge-Kutta integration of the coupled\nfirst-order differential equations for the basis integrals, using the external\nmomentum invariant as the independent variable. The starting point of the\nintegration is provided by known analytic expressions at (or near) zero\nexternal momentum. The code is written in C, and may be linked from C, C++, or\nFortran. A Fortran interface is provided. We describe the structure and usage\nof the program, and provide a simple example application. We also compute two\nnew cases analytically, and compare all of our notations and conventions for\nthe two-loop self-energy integrals to those used by several other groups.\n", "  The generation of arbitrary single-mode quantum states from the vacuum by\nalternate coherent displacement and photon adding as well as the measurement of\nthe overlap of a signal with an arbitrarily chosen quantum state are studied.\nWith regard to implementations, the transformation of the quantum state of a\ntraveling optical field at an array of beam splitters is considered, using\nconditional measurement. Allowing for arbitrary quantum states of both the\ninput reference modes and the output reference modes on which the measurements\nare performed, the setup is described within the concept of two-port\nnon-unitary transformation, and the overall non-unitary transformation operator\nis derived. It is shown to be a product of operators, where each operator is\nassigned to one of the beam splitters and can be expressed in terms of an\ns-ordered operator product, with s being determined by the beam splitter\ntransmittance or reflectance. As an example we discuss the generation of and\noverlap measurement with Schroedinger-cat-like states.\n"]}
