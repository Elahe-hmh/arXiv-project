The model in this paper\nassumes that there is no prior entanglement shared among any of the parties,\nbut that classical communication is free. The task is to perfectly transfer an\nunknown quantum state from a source subsystem to a target subsystem, where both\nsource and target are formed by ordered sets of some of the nodes. It is proved\nthat a lower bound of the rate at which this quantum communication task is\npossible is given by the classical min-cut max-flow theorem of network coding,\nwhere the capacities in question are the quantum capacities of the edges of the\nnetwork.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of efficiently transmitting quantum states\nthrough a network. It has been known for some time that without additional\nassumptions it is impossible to achieve this task perfectly in general --\nindeed, it is impossible even for the simple butterfly network. As additional\nresource we allow free classical communication between any pair of network\nnodes. It is shown that perfect quantum network coding is achievable in this\nmodel whenever classical network coding is possible over the same network when\nreplacing all quantum capacities by classical capacities. More precisely, it is\nproved that perfect quantum network coding using free classical communication\nis possible over a network with $k$ source-target pairs if there exists a\nclassical linear (or even vector linear) coding scheme over a finite ring. Our\nproof is constructive in that we give explicit quantum coding operations for\neach network node. This paper also gives an upper bound on the number of\nclassical communication required in terms of $k$, the maximal fan-in of any\nnetwork node, and the size of the network.\n", "  The k-pair problem in network coding theory asks to send k messages\nsimultaneously between k source-target pairs over a directed acyclic graph. In\na previous paper [ICALP 2009, Part I, pages 622--633] the present authors\nshowed that if a classical k-pair problem is solvable by means of a linear\ncoding scheme, then the quantum k-pair problem over the same graph is also\nsolvable, provided that classical communication can be sent for free between\nany pair of nodes of the graph. Here we address the main case that remained\nopen in our previous work, namely whether nonlinear classical network coding\nschemes can also give rise to quantum network coding schemes. This question is\nmotivated by the fact that there are networks for which there are no linear\nsolutions to the k-pair problem, whereas nonlinear solutions exist. In the\npresent paper we overcome the limitation to linear protocols and describe a new\ncommunication protocol for perfect quantum network coding that improves over\nthe previous one as follows: (i) the new protocol does not put any condition on\nthe underlying classical coding scheme, that is, it can simulate nonlinear\ncommunication protocols as well, and (ii) the amount of classical communication\nsent in the protocol is significantly reduced.\n", "  Filtration combustion is described by Laplacian growth without surface\ntension. These equations have elegant analytical solutions that replace the\ncomplex integro-differential motion equations by simple differential equations\nof pole motion in a complex plane. The main problem with such a solution is the\nexistence of finite time singularities. To prevent such singularities, nonzero\nsurface tension is usually used.However, nonzero surface tension does not exist\nin filtration combustion, and this destroys the analytical solutions. However,\na more elegant approach exists for solving the problem. First, we can introduce\na small amount of pole noise to the system. Second, for regularisation of the\nproblem, we throw out all new poles that can produce a finite time singularity.\nIt can be strictly proved that the asymptotic solution for such a system is a\nsingle finger. Moreover, the qualitative consideration demonstrates that a\nfinger with 1/2 of the channel width is statistically stable. Therefore, all\nproperties of such a solution are exactly the same as those of the solution\nwith nonzero surface tension under numerical noise. The solution of the ST\nproblem without surface tension is similar to the solution for the equation of\ncellular flames in the case of the combustion of gas mixtures.\n", "  We give an explicit groupoid presentation of certain stacks of vector bundles\non formal neighborhoods of rational curves inside algebraic surfaces. The\npresentation involves a M\\\"obius type action of an automorphism group on a\nspace of extensions.\n", "  The dipole force components in nano-sized metal hydrides are quantitatively\ndetermined with curvature and x-ray diffraction measurements. Ab-initio density\nfunctional theory is used to calculate the dipole components and the symmetry\nof the strain field. The hydrogen occupancy in a 100 nm thick V film is shown\nto be tetrahedral with a slight asymmetry at low concentration and a transition\nto octahedral occupancy is shown to take place at around 0.07 [H/V] at 360 K.\nWhen the thickness of the V layer is reduced to 3 nm and biaxially strained, in\na Fe_0.5V_0.5/V superlattice, the hydrogen unequivocally occupies octahedral\nz-like sites, even at and below concentrations of 0.02 [H/V].\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a single, overdamped colloidal particle, which\nis driven by a constant force through a one-dimensional periodic potential. We\nfocus on systems with large barrier heights where the lowest-order cumulants of\nthe density field, that is, average position and the mean-squared displacement,\nshow nontrivial (non-diffusive) short-time behavior characterized by the\nappearance of plateaus. We demonstrate that this \"cage-like\" dynamics can be\nwell described by a discretized master equation model involving two states\n(related to two positions) within each potential valley. Non-trivial\npredictions of our approach include analytic expressions for the plateau\nheights and an estimate of the \"de-caging time\" obtained from the study of\ndeviations from Gaussian behaviour. The simplicity of our approach means that\nit offers a minimal model to describe the short-time behavior of systems with\nhindered dynamics.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new pulsar PSR J1839+15, having a period of 549\nms and a DM of 68 pc-cm^-3. We also present its timing solution and report the\nintermittent behaviour of its radio emission.\n", "  We identify a condition on spacelike 2-surfaces in a spacetime that is\nrelevant to understanding the concept of mass in general relativity. We prove a\nformula for the variation of the spacetime Hawking mass under a uniformly area\nexpanding flow and show that it is nonnegative for these so-called \"time flat\nsurfaces.\" Such flows generalize inverse mean curvature flow, which was used by\nHuisken and Ilmanen to prove the Riemannian Penrose inequality for one black\nhole. A flow of time flat surfaces may have connections to the problem in\ngeneral relativity of bounding the mass of a spacetime from below by the\nquasi-local mass of a spacelike 2-surface contained therein.\n", "  We analyze the ground motion time histories due to the local seismicity near\nthe Itoiz reservoir to estimate the near-source, surface 3D\ndisplacement-gradients and dynamic deformations. The seismic data were obtained\nby a semi-permanent broadband and accelerometric network located on surface and\nat underground sites. The dynamic deformation field was calculated by two\ndifferent methodologies. First, by the Seismo-Geodetic method using the data\nfrom a three-station micro-array located close to the dam; second, by\nSingle-Station estimates of the displacement gradients. The dynamic\ndeformations obtained from both methods were compared and analyzed in the\ncontext of the local free-field effects. The shallow 1D velocity structure was\nestimated from the seismic data by modeling the body wave travel times. Time\nhistories obtained from both methods results quite similar in the time-window\nof body-wave arrivals. The strain misfits between methods vary from 1.4% to\n35.0% and rotational misfits vary from 2.5% to 36.0%. Amplitudes of\ndisplacement gradients vary in the range of 10-8 to 10-7 strains. From these\nresults, a new scaling analysis by numerical modeling is proposed in order to\nestimate the peak dynamic deformations for different magnitudes, up to the\nexpected maximum MW in the region (M5.5). Peak dynamic deformations due to\nlocal MW5.5 earthquakes would reach amplitudes of 10-5 strain and 10-3 radians\nat the Itoiz dam. The Single-Station method shows to be an adequate option for\nthe analysis of local seismicity, where few three-component stations are\navailable. The results obtained here could help to extend the applicability of\nthese methodologies to other sites of engineering interest.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the polarized muon decay at rest (PMDaR) admitting\nthe non-standard V+A interaction in addition to the standard V-A interaction.\nWe show that the angle-energy distribution of Dirac muon neutrinos is sensitive\nto the interference terms between the standard V-A coupling of left-chirality\nmuon neutrino and exotic V+A coupling of right-chirality one, which are\nproportional to the transverse components of muon neutrino spin polarization.\nThe interferences do not vanish in a massless limit and include the relative\nphases to test the CP violation (CPV). It allows to calculate a neutrino flux\nfor an assumed configuration of detector in the case of SM prediction, and the\nupper limits on the neutrino flux for the left-right muon neutrino mixture. We\nalso demonstrate that the effects of neutrino mass and mixing are tiny\ncorrections and can be omitted. The most important conclusion is that even in\nthe massless limit, there are physical effects connected with the mixture of\nleft- and right-handed helicity components in a spin 1/2 quantum state, when\nexotic interaction V+A is admitted contrary to the electron observables, where\nall the possible interferences vanish.\n", "  Growing economic inequalities are observed in several countries throughout\nthe world. Following Pareto, the power-law structure of these inequalities has\nbeen the subject of much theoretical and empirical work. But their\nnonequilibrium dynamics, e.g. after a policy change, remains incompletely\nunderstood. Here we introduce a thermodynamical theory of inequalities based on\nthe analogy between economic stratification and statistical entropy. Within\nthis framework we identify the combination of upward mobility with\nprecariousness as a fundamental driver of inequality. We formalize this\nstatement by a \"second-law\" inequality displaying upward mobility and\nprecariousness as thermodynamic conjugate variables. We estimate the time scale\nfor the \"relaxation\" of the wealth distribution after a sudden change of the\nafter-tax return on capital. Our method can be generalized to gain insight into\nthe dynamics of inequalities in any Markovian model of socioeconomic\ninteractions.\n", "  The CHY formula which describes an $n$-point tree level scattering amplitude\nfor scalars, gluons or gravitons in arbitrary dimension [22], is used to prove\nthe sub-sub-leading soft- graviton theorem recently proposed by Cachazo and\nStrominger [13].\n", "  A new method for searching for Dark Matter axions is proposed. It is shown\nthat a two-contact SQUID can detect oscillating magnetic perturbations induced\nby the axions in a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field. A resonant signal is a\nsteplike response in the SQUID current-voltage characteristic at a voltage\ncorresponding to the axion mass with a height depending on the axion energy\ndensity near the Earth. The proposed experimental technique appears to be\nsensitive to the axions with masses $m_a\\lesssim 10^{-4}$ eV, which is\nwell-motivated by current researches both in cosmology and in particle physics.\n", "  The goal of this article is to derive the reciprocity theorem, mutual energy\ntheorem from Poynting theorem instead of from Maxwell equation. The Poynting\ntheorem is generalized to the modified Poynting theorem. In the modified\nPoynting theorem the electromagnetic field is superimposition of different\nelectromagnetic fields including the retarded potential and advanced potential,\ntime-offset field. The media epsilon (permittivity) and mu (permeability) can\nalso be different in the different fields. The concept of mutual energy is\nintroduced which is the difference between the total energy and self-energy.\nMixed mutual energy theorem is derived. We derive the mutual energy from\nFourier domain. We obtain the time-reversed mutual energy theorem and the\nmutual energy theorem. Then we derive the mutual energy theorem in time-domain.\nThe instantaneous modified mutual energy theorem is derived. Applying\ntime-offset transform and time integral to the instantaneous modified mutual\nenergy theorem, the time-correlation modified mutual energy theorem is\nobtained. Assume there are two electromagnetic fields one is retarded potential\nand one is advanced potential, the convolution reciprocity theorem can be\nderived. Corresponding to the modified time-correlation mutual energy theorem\nand the time-convolution reciprocity theorem in Fourier domain, there is the\nmodified mutual energy theorem and the Lorentz reciprocity theorem. Hence all\nmutual energy theorem and the reciprocity theorems are put in one frame of the\nconcept of the mutual energy. 3 new Complementary theorems are derived. The\ninner product is introduced for two different electromagnetic fields in both\ntime domain and Fourier domain for the application of the wave expansion.\n", "  We show that a class of exactly solvable quantum Ising models, including the\ntransverse-field Ising model and anisotropic XY model, can be characterized as\nthe loops in a two-dimensional auxiliary space. The transverse-field Ising\nmodel corresponds to a circle and the XY model corresponds to an ellipse, while\nother models yield cardioid, limacon, hypocycloid, and Lissajous curves etc. It\nis shown that the variation of the ground state energy density, which is a\nfunction of the loop, experiences a nonanalytical point when the winding number\nof the corresponding loop changes. The winding number can serve as a\ntopological quantum number of the quantum phases in the extended quantum Ising\nmodel, which sheds some light upon the relation between quantum phase\ntransition and the geometrical order parameter characterizing the phase\ndiagram.\n", "  We propose a geometric perspective to describe the motion of self-propelled\nparticles moving at constant speed in d dimensions. We exploit the fact that\nthe vector that conveys the direction of motion of the particle performs a\nrandom walk on a $(d-1)$-dimensional manifold. We show that the particle\nperforms isotropic diffusion in d-dimensions if the manifold corresponds to a\nhypersphere. In contrast, we find that the self-propelled particle exhibits\nanisotropic diffusion if this manifold corresponds to a deformed hypersphere\n(e.g. an ellipsoid). This simple approach provides an unified framework to deal\nwith isotropic as well as anisotropic diffusion of particles moving at constant\nspeed in any dimension.\n", "  We introduce a versatile class of prototype dynamical systems for the study\nof complex bifurcation cascades of limit cycles, including bifurcations\nbreaking spontaneously a symmetry of the system, period doubling bifurcations\nand transitions to chaos induced by sequences of limit cycle bifurcations. The\nprototype system consist of a $2d$-dimensional dynamical system with friction\nforces $f(V(\\mathbf{x}))$ functionally dependent exclusively on the mechanical\npotential $V(\\mathbf{x})$, which is typically characterized, here, by a finite\nnumber of local minima. We present examples for $d=1,2$ and simple polynomial\nfriction forces $f(V)$, where the zeros of $f(V)$ regulate the relative\nimportance of energy uptake and dissipation respectively, serving as\nbifurcation parameters. Starting from simple Hopf- and homoclinic bifurcations,\ncomplex sequences of limit cycle bifurcation are observed when energy uptake\ngains progressively in importance.\n", "  Coherent control over photoelectron wavepackets, via the use of\npolarization-shaped laser pulses, can be understood as a time and\npolarization-multiplexed process. In this work, we investigate this\nmultiplexing via computation of the observable photoelectron angular\ninterferograms resulting from multi-photon atomic ionization with\npolarization-shaped laser pulses. We consider the polarization sensitivity of\nboth the instantaneous and cumulative continuum wavefunction; the nature of the\ncoherent control over the resultant photoelectron interferogram is thus\nexplored in detail. Based on this understanding, the use of coherent control\nwith polarization-shaped pulses as a methodology for a highly multiplexed\ncoherent quantum metrology is also investigated, and defined in terms of the\ninformation content of the observable.\n", "  We report the measurement of the triplet s-partial-wave scattering length $a$\nof two bosonic isotopes of the highly magnetic element, dysprosium:\n$a=122(10)a_0$ for $^{162}$Dy and $a=92(8)a_0$ for $^{164}$Dy, where $a_0$ is\nthe Bohr radius. The scattering lengths are determined by the cross-dimensional\nrelaxation of ultracold gases of these Dy isotopes at temperatures above\nquantum degeneracy. In this temperature regime, the measured rethermalization\ndynamics can be compared to simulations of the Boltzmann equation using a\ndirect-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method employing the anisotropic\ndifferential scattering cross section of dipolar particles.\n", "  We put forward an experimentally feasible scheme for heralded entanglement\ngeneration between two distant macroscopic mechanical resonators. The protocol\nexploits a hybrid quantum device, a qubit interacting with a mechanical\nresonator as well as a cavity mode, for each party. The cavity modes interfere\non a beam-splitter followed by suitable heralding detections which post-select\na hybrid entangled state with success probability 1/2. Subsequently, by local\nmeasurements on the qubits a mechanical entangled coherent state can be\nachieved. The mechanical entanglement can be further verified via monitoring\nthe entanglement of the qubit pair. The setup is envisioned as a test bench for\nsensing gravitational effects on the quantum dynamics of gravitationally\ncoupled massive objects. As a concrete example, we illustrate the\nimplementation of our protocol using the current circuit QED architectures.\n", "  Motivated by the ongoing debate about nanophotonic control of Foerster\nresonance energy transfer (FRET), notably by the local density of optical\nstates (LDOS), we study an analytic model system wherein a pair of ideal dipole\nemitters - donor and acceptor - exhibit energy transfer in the vicinity of an\nideal mirror. The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the\nFRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the\nGreen function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS\nintegrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the\ndonor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then,\nthe broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates. We discuss\npractical consequences including quantum information processing.\n", "  We compute the one-instanton effective action of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory\nwith gauge group Sp(2N). The result can be written in a very compact and\nmanifestly supersymmetric form involving an integral over the superspace of an\nirrational function of the N=4 on-shell superfields. In the Coulomb branch, the\ninstanton corrects both the MHV and next-to-next-MHV higher derivative terms\nD^4F^{2n+2} and F^{2n+4}. We confirm at the non-perturbative level the\nnon-renormalization theorems for MHV F^{2n+2} terms that are expected to\nreceive perturbative corrections only at n-loops. We compute also the one and\ntwo-loop corrections to the D^4F^4 term and show that its completion under\nSL(2,Z) duality is consistent with the one-instanton results of U(2) gauge\ngroup.\n", "  We construct models of dark matter with suppressed spin-independent\nscattering cross section utilizing the existing simplified model framework.\nEven simple combinations of simplified models can exhibit interference effects\nthat cause the tree level contribution to the scattering cross section to\nvanish, thus demonstrating that direct detection limits on simplified models\nare not robust when embedded in a more complicated and realistic framework. In\ngeneral for fermionic WIMP masses >10 GeV direct detection limits on the\nspin-independent scattering cross section are much stronger than those coming\nfrom the LHC. However these model combinations, which we call less-simplified\nmodels, represent situations where LHC searches become more competitive than\ndirect detection experiments even for moderate dark matter mass. We show that a\ncomplementary use of several searches at the LHC can strongly constrain the\ndirect detection blind spots by setting limits on the coupling constants and\nmediators' mass. We derive the strongest limits for combinations of vector +\nscalar, vector + \"squark\", and \"squark\" + scalar mediator, and present the\ncorresponding projections for the LHC 14 TeV for a number of searches:\nmono-jet, jets + missing energy, and searches for heavy vector resonances.\n", "  In arXiv:1508.01343 [hep-th], one of the authors proposed that in AdS/CFT the\ngravity dual of the boundary $c$-theorem is the second law of thermodynamics\nsatisfied by causal horizons in AdS and this was verified for Einstein gravity\nin the bulk. In this paper we verify this for higher derivative theories. We\npick up theories for which an entropy expression satisfying the second law\nexists and show that the entropy density evaluated on the causal horizon in a\nRG flow geometry is a holographic c-function. We also prove that given a theory\nof gravity described by a local covariant action in the bulk a sufficient\ncondition to ensure holographic c-theorem is that the second law of causal\nhorizon thermodynamics be satisfied by the theory. This allows us to explicitly\nconstruct holographic c-function in a theory where there is curvature coupling\nbetween gravity and matter and standard null energy condition cannot be defined\nalthough second law is known to hold. Based on the duality between c-theorem\nand the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics proposed in\narXiv:1508.01343 [hep-th] and the supporting calculations of this paper we\nconjecture that every Unitary higher derivative theory of gravity in AdS\nsatisfies the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics. If this is not true\nthen c-theorem will be violated in a unitary Lorentz invariant field theory.\n", "  In this paper, we show how a presence of the exotic scalar, tensor weak\ninteractions in addition to the standard vector-axial (V-A) one may help to\ndistinguish the Dirac from Majorana neutrinos in the elastic scattering of\n(anti)neutrino beam off the unpolarized electrons in the limit of vanishing\n(anti)neutrino mass. We assume that the incoming (anti)neutrino beam comes from\nthe polarized muon decay at rest and is the left-right chiral mixture with\nassigned direction of the transversal spin polarization with respect to the\nproduction plane. We display that the azimuthal asymmetry in the angular\ndistribution of recoil electrons is generated by the interference terms between\nthe standard and exotic couplings, which are proportional to the transversal\n(anti)neutrino spin polarization and independent of the neutrino mass. This\nasymmetry for the Majorana neutrinos is distinct from the one for the Dirac\nneutrinos through the absence of interference between the standard and tensor\ncouplings. Additionally, the interference term between the standard and scalar\ncoupling of the only left chiral neutrinos, absent in the Dirac case, appears.\nWe also indicate the possibility of utilizing the azimuthal asymmetry\nmeasurements to search for the new CP-violating phases. Our analysis is\nmodel-independent and consistent with the current upper limits on the\nnon-standard couplings.\n", "  We derive the category-theoretic backbone of quantum theory from a process\nontology. More specifically, we treat quantum theory as a theory of systems,\nprocesses and their interactions.\n  In this first part of a three-part overview, we first present a general\ntheory of diagrams, and in particular, of string diagrams. We discuss why\ndiagrams are a very natural starting point for developing scientific theories.\nThen we define process theories, and define a very general notion of quantum\ntype. We show how our process ontology enables us to assert causality, that is,\ncompatibility of quantum theory and relativity theory, and we prove the\nno-signalling theorem.\n  Other notable contributions include new, elegant derivations of the\nno-broadcasting theorem, unitarity of evolution, and Stinespring dilation, all\nfor any 'quantum' type in a general class of process theories.\n", "  The accurate absolute surface energies of (0001)/(000-1) surfaces of wurtzite\nstructures are crucial in determining the thin film growth mode of important\nenergy materials. However, the surface energies still remain to be solved due\nto the intrinsic difficulty of calculating dangling bond energy of\nasymmetrically bonded surface atoms. In this study, we used a pseudo-hydrogen\npassivation method to estimate the dangling bond energy and calculate the polar\nsurfaces of ZnO and GaN. The calculations were based on the pseudo chemical\npotentials obtained from a set of tetrahedral clusters or simple\npseudo-molecules, using density functional theory approaches. And the surface\nenergies of (0001)/(000-1) surfaces of wurtzite ZnO and GaN we obtained showed\nrelatively high self-consistencies. A wedge structure calculation with a new\nbottom surface passivation scheme of group I and group VII elements was also\nproposed and performed to show converged absolute surface energy of wurtzite\nZnO polar surfaces, and the result were also compared with the above method.\nThese calculations and comparisons may provide important insights to crystal\ngrowths of the above materials, thereby leading to significant performance\nenhancements of semiconductor devices.\n", "  By employing the Pekeris approximation, the D-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is solved for the nuclear deformed Woods-Saxon potential plus double\nring-shaped potential within the framework of the Asymptotic Iteration Method\n(AIM). The energy eingenvalues are given in a closed form and the corresponding\nnormalized eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions.\nOur general results reproduce many predictions obtained in the literature,\nusing the Nikiforov-Uvarov method (NU) and the Improved Quantization Rule\napproach, particulary those derived by considering Woods-Saxon potential\nwithout deformation and/or without ring shape interaction.\n", "  This paper provides a systematic yet accessible presentation of the\nContextuality-by-Default theory. The consideration is confined to finite\nsystems of categorical random variables, which allows us to focus on the basics\nof the theory without using full-scale measure-theoretic language.\nContextuality-by-Default is a theory of random variables identified by their\ncontents and their contexts, so that two variables have a joint distribution if\nand only if they share a context. Intuitively, the content of a random variable\nis the entity the random variable measures or responds to, while the context is\nformed by the conditions under which these measurements or responses are\nobtained. A system of random variables consists of stochastically unrelated\n\"bunches,\" each of which is a set of jointly distributed random variables\nsharing a context. The variables that have the same content in different\ncontexts form \"connections\" between the bunches. A probabilistic coupling of\nthis system is a set of random variables obtained by imposing a joint\ndistribution on the stochastically unrelated bunches. A system is considered\nnoncontextual or contextual according to whether it can or cannot be coupled so\nthat the joint distributions imposed on its connections possess a certain\nproperty (in the present version of the theory, \"maximality\"). We present a\ncriterion of contextuality for a special class of systems of random variables,\ncalled cyclic systems. We also introduce a general measure of contextuality\nthat makes use of (quasi-)couplings whose distributions may involve negative\nnumbers or numbers greater than 1 in place of probabilities.\n", "  In this work, an effective fermion model with particular higher order\ninteractions given by: $I_{II} = \\sum_n^N g_{2^n} (\\bar{\\psi}_a \\psi_a)^{2^n}$,\nfor finite $N$, is investigated by means of the auxiliary field method by\ntaking into account 2$n$-particle states as proposed in Ref. [1]. The bosonized\nmodel was found to exhibit an approximate symmetry when expanded for weak field\nfluctuations around the mean field solutions. In the present work, the role of\nthe mean field solutions for the corresponding auxiliary fields is\ninvestigated. With the integration of fermions, the resulting determinant is\nexpanded in a polynomial boson model in the weak field approximation and the\napproximate symmetry found for this series does not appear if the boson mean\nfields are set to zero.\n", "  The diffusion properties of self-propelled particles which move at constant\nspeed and, in addition, reverse their direction of motion repeatedly are\ninvestigated. The internal dynamics of particles triggering these reversal\nprocesses is modeled by a stochastic clock. The velocity correlation function\nas well as the mean squared displacement is investigated and, furthermore, a\ngeneral expression for the diffusion coefficient for self-propelled particles\nwith directional reversal is derived. Our analysis reveals the existence of an\noptimal, finite rotational noise amplitude which maximizes the diffusion\ncoefficient. We comment on the relevance of these results with regard to\nmicrobiological systems and suggest further experiments in this context.\n", "  Time-periodic CFD simulations are widely used to investigate turbomachinery\ncomponents. The triple-plane pressure mode matching method (TPP) developed by\nOvenden and Rienstra extracts the acoustic part in such simulations. Experience\nshows that this method is subject to significant errors when the amplitude of\npseudo-sound is high compared to sound. Pseudo-sound are unsteady pressure\nfluctuations with a convective character. The presented extension to the TPP\nimproves the splitting between acoustics and the rest of the unsteady flow\nfield. The method is simple: i) the acoustic eigenmodes are analytically\ndetermined for a uniform mean flow as in the original TPP; ii) the suggested\nmodel for convective pressure perturbations uses the convective wavenumber as\naxial wavenumber and the same orthogonal radial shape functions as for the\nacoustic modes. The reliability is demonstrated on the simulation data of a\nlow-pressure fan. As acoustic and convective perturbations are separated, the\naccuracy of the results increases close to sources, allowing a reduction of the\ncomputational costs by shortening the simulation domain. The extended method is\nas robust as the original one--giving the same results for the acoustic modes\nin absence of convective perturbations.\n", "  Strain engineering allows the physical properties of materials and devices to\nbe widely tailored, as paradigmatically demonstrated by strained transistors\nand semiconductor lasers employed in consumer electronics. For this reason, its\npotential impact on our society has been compared to that of chemical alloying.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the last years on strained\nnanomaterials, strain fields (which are of tensorial nature, with six\nindependent components) are still mostly used in a \"scalar\" and/or static\nfashion. Here we present a new class of strain actuators which allow the three\ncomponents of the in-plane stress tensor in a nanomembrane to be independently\nand reversibly controlled. The actuators are based on monolithic piezoelectric\nsubstrates, which are micro-machined via femtosecond-laser processing. Their\nfunctionality is demonstrated by \"programming\" arbitrary stress states in a\nsemiconductor layer, whose light emission is used as a local and sensitive\nstrain gauge. The results shown in this work open a new route to investigate\nand make use of strain effects in materials and devices.\n", "  Nowadays, several models of unidimensional fluid jets exploit discrete\nelement methods. In some cases, as for models aiming at describing the\nelectrospinning nanofabrication process of polymer fibers, discrete element\nmethods suffer a non constant resolution of the jet representation. We develop\na dynamic mesh-refinement method for the numerical study of the\nelectro-hydrodynamic behavior of charged jets using discrete element methods.\nTo this purpose, we import ideas and techniques from the string method\noriginally developed in the framework of free-energy landscape simulations. The\nmesh-refined discrete element method is demonstrated for the case of\nelectrospinning applications.\n", "  The GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab ran with its first commissioning beam\nin late 2014 and the spring of 2015. Data were collected on both plastic and\nliquid hydrogen targets, and much of the detector has been commissioned. All of\nthe detector systems are now performing at or near design specifications and\nevents are being fully reconstructed, including exclusive production of\n$\\pi^{0}$, $\\eta$ and $\\omega$ mesons. Linearly-polarized photons were\nsuccessfully produced through coherent bremsstrahlung and polarization transfer\nto the $\\rho$ has been observed.\n", "  The relativity of cosmic time is developed within the framework of\nCosmological Relativity in five dimensions of space, time and velocity. A\ngeneral linearized metric element is defined to have the form $ds^2 = (1+\\phi)\nc^2 dt^2 - dr^2 + (1+\\psi) \\tau^2 dv^2$, where the coordinates are time $t$,\nradial distance $r=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ for spatials $x$, $y$ and $z$, and\nvelocity $v$, with $c$ the speed of light in vacuum and $\\tau$ the\nHubble-Carmeli time constant. The metric is accurate to first order in $t/\\tau$\nand $v/c$. The fields $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are general functions of the\ncoordinates. By showing that $\\phi = \\psi$, a metric of the form $ds^2 = c^2\ndt^2 - dr^2 + \\tau^2 dv^2$ is obtained from the general metric, implying that\nthe universe is flat. For cosmological redshift $z$, the luminosity distance\nrelation $D_L (z,t) = r (1 + z) / \\sqrt{1 - t^2 / \\tau^2}$ is used to fit\ncombined distance moduli from Type Ia Supernovae up to $z < 1.5$ and Gamma-Ray\nBursts up to $z < 7$, from which a value of $\\Omega_M = 0.800 \\pm 0.080$ is\nobtained for the matter density parameter at the present epoch. Assuming a\nbaryon density of $\\Omega_B = 0.038 \\pm 0.004$, a rest mass energy of $( 9.79\n\\pm 0.47 ) \\, {\\rm GeV}$ is predicted for the anti-baryonic $\\bar{Y}$ and the\n$\\Phi^{*}$ particles which decay from a hypothetical $\\bar{X}_1$ particle. The\ncosmic aging function $g_1(z,t)= ( 1 + z) ( 1 - t^2 / \\tau^2 )$ makes good fits\nto light curve data from two reports of Type 1a supernovae and in fitting to\nsimulated quasar like light curve power spectra separated by redshift\n$\\Delta{z} \\approx 1$. We determine the multipole of the first acoustic peak of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropy to be $l \\approx 224 \\pm\n5$ and a sound horizon of $\\theta_{sh0} \\approx (0.805 \\pm 0.020 ) {}^{\\circ}$\non today's sky.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a domain wall under the influence of applied\nmagnetic fields in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic nanowire, governed by the\nLandau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation. Existence of travelling-wave solutions\nclose to two known static solutions is proven using\nimplicit-function-theorem-type arguments.\n", "  In this paper, I demonstrate that the constraint functions are propagated by\na first order symmetric (or symmetrizable) hyperbolic system whose\ncharacteristic cone is the light cone. This result follows from the\ntwice-contracted Bianchi identities. Analyticity is not required.\n", "  Frequency generators are widely used in electronics. Here, we report the\ndesign and experimental realization of a memristive frequency generator\nemploying a unique combination of only digital logic gates, a single-supply\nvoltage and a realistic threshold-type memristive device. In our circuit, the\noscillator frequency and duty cycle are defined by the switching\ncharacteristics of the memristive device and external resistors. We demonstrate\nthe circuit operation both experimentally, using a memristor emulator, and\ntheoretically, using a model memristive device with threshold. Importantly,\nnanoscale realizations of memristive devices offer small-size alternatives to\nconventional quartz-based oscillators. In addition, the suggested approach can\nbe used for mimicking some cyclic (Sisyphus) processes in nature, such as\n\"dripping ants\" or drops from leaky faucets.\n", "  We analyze full-orbit phase curve observations of the transiting hot Jupiters\nWASP-19b and HAT-P-7b at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m obtained using the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. For WASP-19b, we measure secondary eclipse depths of $0.485\\%\\pm\n0.024\\%$ and $0.584\\%\\pm 0.029\\%$ at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m, which are consistent\nwith a single blackbody with effective temperature $2372 \\pm 60$ K. The\nmeasured 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m secondary eclipse depths for HAT-P-7b are\n$0.156\\%\\pm 0.009\\%$ and $0.190\\%\\pm 0.006\\%$, which are well-described by a\nsingle blackbody with effective temperature $2667\\pm 57$ K. Comparing the phase\ncurves to the predictions of one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmospheric\nmodels, we find that WASP-19b's dayside emission is consistent with a model\natmosphere with no dayside thermal inversion and moderately efficient day-night\ncirculation. We also detect an eastward-shifted hotspot, suggesting the\npresence of a superrotating equatorial jet. In contrast, HAT-P-7b's dayside\nemission suggests a dayside thermal inversion and relatively inefficient\nday-night circulation; no hotspot shift is detected. For both planets, these\nsame models do not agree with the measured nightside emission. The\ndiscrepancies in the model-data comparisons for WASP-19b might be explained by\nhigh-altitude silicate clouds on the nightside and/or high atmospheric\nmetallicity, while the very low 3.6 $\\mu$m nightside planetary brightness for\nHAT-P-7b may be indicative of an enhanced global C/O ratio. We compute Bond\nalbedos of 0 ($<0.08$ at $1\\sigma$) and $0.38\\pm 0.06$ for WASP-19b and\nHAT-P-7b, respectively. In the context of other planets with thermal phase\ncurve measurements, we show that WASP-19b and HAT-P-7b fit the general trend of\ndecreasing day-night heat recirculation with increasing irradiation.\n", "  Basing on a self-consistent method, we predict theoretically that there\noccurs not only a normal (quasi) fermion mode, but also a collective fermion\nmode, plasmino, in a warm 2D massless Dirac system, especially in a warm\nintrinsic graphene system. Results of Landau damping show that both fermion and\nplasmino are well defined modes. We find that there are sharp differences\nbetween the discussed system and the QCD/QED system. Firstly, the thermal mass\nis proportional to $\\alpha_g^{3/4}T$ but not $\\alpha_g T$. Secondly, at\n$0<q<q_c$, the fermion channel and plasmino channel are nearly degenerate and\nfurthermore, the energy difference between fermion and plasmino becomes more\nand more larger with increasing $q$ at the region $q>q_c$. Thirdly, the fermion\nbehaves as a \"relativity particles\" with none zero mass and the plasmino\nexhibits an anormal dispersion at moderate momentum.\n", "  We present a molecular modeling study analyzing nanometer-scale strain\nvariations in graphene as a function of externally applied tensile strain. We\nconsider two different mechanisms that could underlie nanometer-scale strain\nvariations: static perturbations from lattice imperfections of an underlying\nsubstrate and thermal fluctuations. For both cases we observe a decrease in the\nout-of-plane atomic displacements with increasing strain, which is accompanied\nby an increase in the in-plane displacements. Reflecting the non-linear elastic\nproperties of graphene, both trends together yield a non-monotonic variation of\nthe total displacements with increasing tensile strain. This variation allows\nto test the role of nanometer-scale strain variations in limiting the carrier\nmobility of high-quality graphene samples.\n", "  The solution space of genome-scale models of cellular metabolism provides a\nmap between physically viable flux configurations and cellular metabolic\nphenotypes described, at the most basic level, by the corresponding growth\nrates. By sampling the solution space of E. coli's metabolic network, we show\nthat empirical growth rate distributions recently obtained in experiments at\nsingle-cell resolution can be explained in terms of a trade-off between the\nhigher fitness of fast-growing phenotypes and the higher entropy of\nslow-growing ones. Based on this, we propose a minimal model for the evolution\nof a large bacterial population that captures this trade-off. The scaling\nrelationships observed in experiments encode, in such frameworks, for the same\ndistance from the maximum achievable growth rate, the same degree of growth\nrate maximization, and/or the same rate of phenotypic change. Being grounded on\ngenome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, these results allow for\nmultiple implications and extensions in spite of the underlying conceptual\nsimplicity.\n", "  A frame work has been presented for theoretical interpretation of various\nmodified gravitational models which is based on the group theoretical approach\nand unitary irreducible representations (UIR's) of de Sitter (dS) group. In\norder to illustrate the application of the proposed method, a model of modified\ngravity has been investigated. The background field method has been utilized\nand the linearized modified gravitational field equation has been obtained in\nthe 4-dimensional dS space-time as the background. The field equation has been\nwritten as the eigne-value equation of the Casimir operators of dS space using\nthe flat 5-dimensional ambient space notations. The Minkowskian correspondence\nof the theory has been obtained by taking the zero curvature limit. It has been\nshown that under some simple conditions, the linearized modified field equation\ntransforms according to two of the UIR's of dS group labeled by $\\Pi^\\pm_{2,1}$\nand $\\Pi^\\pm_{2,2}$ in the discrete series. It means that the proposed modified\ngravitational theory can be a suitable one to describe the quantum\ngravitational effects in its linear approximation on dS space. The field\nequation has been solved and the solution has been written as the\nmultiplication of a symmetric rank-2 polarization tensor and a massless scalar\nfield using the ambient space notations. Also the two-point function has been\ncalculated in the ambient space formalism. It is dS invariant and free of any\ntheoretical problem.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the possibility of probing a class of neutrino\nmass models at the LHC proton-proton collisions with 8 and 14 TeV energies. The\nexistence of lepton flavor violating interactions for a singlet charged scalar,\n$S^{\\pm}$, that couples to the leptons could induce many processes such as\n$pp\\rightarrow\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\pm}\\ell_{\\beta}^{\\mp}+\\slashed E $. Using the\nprocesses with $\\ell_{\\alpha}\\ell_{\\beta}=ee,e\\mu,\\mu\\mu$, we found that an\ninclusive cut on the $M_{T2}$ event variable is vital in our analysis and leads\nto an effective suppression of the large Standard Model background. Our results\nshow possible detectability of the charged scalars effect, especially at the\n$\\sqrt{s}= 14~\\text{TeV}$.\n", "  A flavor SU(2) effective model for pions and quarks is derived by considering\npolarization effects departing from the usual quark-quark effective interaction\ninduced by dressed gluon exchange, i.e. a global color model for QCD. For that,\nthe quark field is decomposed into a component that yields light mesons and the\nquark-antiquark condensate, being integrated out by means of the auxiliary\nfield method, and another component which yields constituent quarks, which is\nbasically a background quark field. Within a longwavelength and weak quark\nfield expansion (or large quark effective mass expansion) of a quark\ndeterminant, the leading terms are found up to the second order in a zero order\nderivative expansion, by neglecting vector mesons that are considerably heavier\nthan the pion. Pions are considered in the structureless limit and, besides the\nchiral invariant terms that reproduce previously derived expressions, symmetry\nbreaking terms are also presented. The leading chiral quark-quark effective\ncouplings are also found corresponding to a NJL and a vector-NJL couplings. All\nthe resulting effective coupling constants and parameters are expressed in\nterms of the current and constituent quark masses and of the coupling $g$.\n", "  We study a quantum quench in a one-dimensional spinless fermion model\n(equivalent to the XXZ spin chain), where a magnetic flux is suddenly switched\noff. This quench is equivalent to imposing a pulse of electric field and\ntherefore generates an initial particle current. This current is not a\nconserved quantity in presence of a lattice and interactions and we investigate\nnumerically its time-evolution after the quench, using the infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation method. For repulsive interactions or large\ninitial flux, we find oscillations that are governed by excitations deep inside\nthe Fermi sea. At long times we observe that the current remains non-vanishing\nin the gapless cases, whereas it decays to zero in the gapped cases. Although\nthe linear response theory (valid for a weak flux) predicts the same long-time\nlimit of the current for repulsive and attractive interactions (relation with\nthe zero-temperature Drude weight), larger nonlinearities are observed in the\ncase of repulsive interactions compared with that of the attractive case.\n", "  Quasilinear theory is often utilized to approximate the dynamics of fluids\nexhibiting significant interactions between mean flows and eddies. In this\npaper we present a generalization of quasilinear theory to include dynamic mode\ninteractions on the large scales. This generalized quasilinear (GQL)\napproximation is achieved by separating the state variables into large and\nsmall zonal scales via a spectral filter rather than by a decomposition into a\nformal mean and fluctuations. Nonlinear interactions involving only small zonal\nscales are then removed. The approximation is conservative and allows for\nscattering of energy between small-scale modes via the large scale (through\nnon-local spectral interactions). We evaluate GQL for the paradigmatic problems\nof the driving of large-scale jets on a spherical surface and on the beta-plane\nand show that it is accurate even for a small number of large-scale modes. As\nthis approximation is formally linear in the small zonal scales it allows for\nthe closure of the system and can be utilized in direct statistical simulation\nschemes that have proved an attractive alternative to direct numerical\nsimulation for many geophysical and astrophysical problems.\n", "  The production of K$^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ and $\\phi$(1020) mesons has been\nmeasured in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. K$^{*0}$\nand $\\phi$ are reconstructed via their decay into charged hadrons with the\nALICE detector in the rapidity range $-0.5 < y <0$. The transverse momentum\nspectra, measured as a function of the multiplicity, have p$_{\\mathrm{T}}$\nrange from 0 to 15 GeV/$c$ for K$^{*0}$ and from 0.3 to 21 GeV/$c$ for $\\phi$.\nIntegrated yields, mean transverse momenta and particle ratios are reported and\ncompared with results in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. In Pb-Pb and p-Pb\ncollisions, K$^{*0}$ and $\\phi$ probe the hadronic phase of the system and\ncontribute to the study of particle formation mechanisms by comparison with\nother identified hadrons. For this purpose, the mean transverse momenta and the\ndifferential proton-to-$\\phi$ ratio are discussed as a function of the\nmultiplicity of the event. The short-lived K$^{*0}$ is measured to investigate\nre-scattering effects, believed to be related to the size of the system and to\nthe lifetime of the hadronic phase.\n", "  We present a Bayesian approach to particle identification (PID) within the\nALICE experiment. The aim is to more effectively combine the particle\nidentification capabilities of its various detectors. After a brief explanation\nof the adopted methodology and formalism, the performance of the Bayesian PID\napproach for charged pions, kaons and protons in the central barrel of ALICE is\nstudied. PID is performed via measurements of specific energy loss\n($\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}x$) and time-of-flight. PID efficiencies and\nmisidentification probabilities are extracted and compared with Monte Carlo\nsimulations using high-purity samples of identified particles in the decay\nchannels ${\\rm K}^0_S \\rightarrow \\pi^-\\pi^+$, $\\phi \\rightarrow {\\rm K}^-{\\rm\nK}^+$, and $\\Lambda \\rightarrow {\\rm p}\\pi^-$ in p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. In order to thoroughly assess the validity of the\nBayesian approach, this methodology was used to obtain corrected $p_{\\rm T}$\nspectra of pions, kaons, protons, and D$^0$ mesons in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. In all cases, the results using Bayesian PID were found to be\nconsistent with previous measurements performed by ALICE using a standard PID\napproach. For the measurement of D$^0 \\rightarrow {\\rm K}^-\\pi^+$, it was found\nthat a Bayesian PID approach gave a higher signal-to-background ratio and a\nsimilar or larger statistical significance when compared with standard PID\nselections, despite a reduced identification efficiency. Finally, we present an\nexploratory study of the measurement of $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}\\rightarrow {\\rm p}\n{\\rm K}^-\\pi^+$ in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, using the Bayesian\napproach for the identification of its decay products.\n", "  We compute the self-energy for the half-filled Hubbard model on a square\nlattice using lattice quantum Monte Carlo simulations and the dynamical vertex\napproximation. The self-energy is strongly momentum dependent, but it can be\nparametrized via the non-interacting energy-momentum dispersion\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$, except for pseudogap features right at the Fermi\nedge. That is, it can be written as $\\Sigma(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}},\\omega)$,\nwith two energy-like parameters ($\\varepsilon$, $\\omega$) instead of three\n($k_x$, $k_y$ and $\\omega$). The self-energy has two rather broad and weakly\ndispersing high energy features and a sharp $\\omega= \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$\nfeature at high temperatures, which turns to $\\omega=\n-\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ at low temperatures. Altogether this yields a Z- and\nreversed-Z-like structure, respectively, for the imaginary part of\n$\\Sigma(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}},\\omega)$. We attribute the change of the low\nenergy structure to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.\n", "  We numerically investigate the growth of the entanglement entropy S_{ent}(t)\nin time t---after a global quench from a product state---in quantum chains with\nvarious kinds of disorder. The main focus is, in particular, on fermionic\nchains with bond disorder. In the noninteracting case at criticality we\nnumerically test recent predictions by the real space renormalization group for\nthe entanglement growth in time, the maximal entanglement as a function of\nblock size, and the decay of a density wave order parameter. We show that\nmultiprecision calculations are required to reach the scaling regime and\nperform such calculations for specific cases. For interacting models with\nbinary bond disorder we present data based on infinite size density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations and exact diagonalizations. We obtain first\nnumerical evidence for a many-body localized phase in bond disordered systems\nwhere S_{ent}(t)~ln t$ seems to hold. Our results for bond disorder are\ncontrasted with the well studied case of potential disorder.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the spectral zeta function associated with a Laplace\noperator acting on scalar functions on an N-dimensional Euclidean space in the\npresence of a spherically symmetric background potential. The obtained analytic\ncontinuation of the spectral zeta function is then used to derive very simple\nresults for the functional determinant of the operator and the Casimir energy\nof the scalar field.\n", "  Spin echo is a fundamental tool for quantum registers and biomedical imaging.\nIt is believed that a strong magnetic field is needed for the spin echo to\nprovide long memory and high resolution since a degenerate spin cannot be\ncontrolled or addressed under a zero magnetic field. While a degenerate spin is\nnever subject to dynamic control, it is still subject to geometric control.\nHere we show the spin echo of a degenerate spin subsystem, which is\ngeometrically controlled via a mediating state split by the crystal field, in a\nnitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The demonstration reveals that the\ndegenerate spin is protected by inherent symmetry breaking called zero-field\nsplitting. The geometric spin echo under zero field provides an ideal way to\nmaintain the coherence without any dynamics, thus opening the way to\npseudo-static quantum random access memory and non-invasive biosensors.\n", "  The Laura++ software package is designed for performing fits of amplitude\nmodels to data from decays of spin-0 particles into final states containing\nthree spin-0 particles - so-called Dalitz-plot analysis. An overview of the\namplitude formalism and its software implementation is given as well as\nsummaries of recently added features and planned future developments.\n", "  A large panel of old and recently proposed exchange-correlation functionals\nbelonging to rungs 1 to 4 of Jacob's ladder of density functional theory are\ntested (with and without a dispersion correction term) for the calculation of\nthe lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy of solids. Particular\nattention will be paid to the functionals MGGA_MS2 [J. Sun et al., J. Chem.\nPhys. 138, 044113 (2013)], mBEEF [J. Wellendorff et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140,\n144107 (2014)], and SCAN [J. Sun et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)]\nthat are approximations of the meta-generalized gradient type and were\ndeveloped with the goal to be universally good. Another goal is also to\ndetermine for which semilocal functionals and groups of solids it is beneficial\n(or not necessary) to use the Hartree-Fock exchange or a dispersion correction\nterm.\n", "  In the quest to make metallic hydrogen at low temperatures a rich number of\nnew phases have been found and the highest pressure ones have somewhat flat\nphase lines, around room temperature. We have studied hydrogen to static\npressures of GPa in a diamond anvil cell and down to liquid helium\ntemperatures, using infrared spectroscopy. We report a new phase at a pressure\nof GPa and T=5 K. Although we observe strong darkening of the sample in the\nvisible, we have no evidence that this phase is metallic hydrogen.\n", "  The pre-inflationary evolution of the universe describes the beginning of the\nexpansion from a static initial state, such that the Hubble parameter is\ninitially zero, but increases to an asymptotic constant value, in which it\ncould achieve a de Sitter (inflationary) expansion. The expansion is driven by\na background phantom field. The back-reaction effects at this moment should\ndescribe vacuum geometrical excitations, which are studied with detail in this\nwork using Relativistic Quantum Geometry.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of interpreting the 125 GeV scalar boson and the\n750 GeV diphoton excess recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments as a\nHiggs-dominated and a radion-dominated states respectively in a stabilized\nbrane-world model. It is shown that in the simplest variant of the model, where\nonly the gravitational degrees of freedom propagate in the bulk, the production\ncross section of the radion-dominated state with mass 750 GeV turns out to be\ntoo small in the allowed region of the model parameter space for explaining the\nnature of the excess in this approach.\n", "  We consider necessary conditions for the one-body-reduced density matrix\n(1RDM) to correspond to a triplet wave-function of a two electron system. The\nconditions concern the occupation numbers and are different for the high spin\nprojections, $S_z=\\pm 1$, and the $S_z=0$ projection. Hence, they can be used\nto test if an approximate 1RDM functional yields the same energies for both\nprojections. We employ these conditions in reduced density matrix functional\ntheory calculations for the triplet excitations of two-electron systems. In\naddition, we propose that these conditions can be used in the calculation of\ntriplet states of systems with more than two electrons by restricting the\nactive space. We assess this procedure in calculations for a few atomic and\nmolecular systems. We show that the quality of the optimal 1RDMs improves by\napplying the conditions in all the cases we studied.\n", "  We study one-loop radiative neutrino mass models in which one of the\nbeyond-the-standard model fields is either a hypercharge-zero fermion quintet\n(minimal dark matter) or a hypercharge-zero scalar septet. By systematically\nclassifying all possible one-loop such models we identify various processes\nthat render the neutral component of these representations (dark matter)\ncosmologically unstable. Thus, our findings show that these scenarios are in\ngeneral not reconcilable with dark matter stability unless tiny couplings or\nadditional ad hoc symmetries are assumed, in contrast to minimal dark matter\nmodels where stability is entirely due to the standard model gauge symmetry.\nFor some variants based on higher-order loops we find that $\\alpha_2$ reaches a\nLandau pole at rather low scales, a couple orders of magnitude from the\ncharacteristic scale of the model itself. Thus, we argue that some of these\nvariations although consistent with dark matter stability and phenomenological\nconstraints are hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria.\n", "  The transport and shear under a Phillips-type spectrum are presented. A\ncombined profile for monochromatic swell and a Phillips-type wind sea spectrum\nwhich can be used to investigate the shear under crossing seas is then\npresented.\n", "  We investigate long range rapidity correlations of pairs of prompt photon and\njet in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework in proton-proton and\nproton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. We show that photon-jet\ncorrelations exhibit long-range azimuthal collimation at near-side for low\ntransverse momenta of the produced photon and jet in high-multiplicity events.\nThese ridge-like features are strikingly similar to the observed ridge effect\nfor di-hadron correlations at RHIC and the LHC. We show that correlations in\nthe relative rapidity and the relative azimuthal angle between pairs of prompt\nphoton and jet strongly depend on the gluon saturation dynamics at small-x\nkinematics and such measurements can help to understand the true origin of the\nobserved di-hadron ridge in p+A collisions, and address whether the ridge is a\nuniversal phenomenon for all two particle correlations at high energy and high\nmultiplicity events. We also investigate if there is a ridge-like structure for\nphoton-hadron pair correlations at RHIC and the LHC. We found that the\nhadronization of jet has non-trivial effects on the photon-jet correlations.\n", "  In this paper the detailed CCWZ procedure for introducing fermions on the\nworld sheet of a string propagating in flat space-time is presented. The theory\nof nonlinear realizations is used to derive the transformation as well as the\ninteractions of fermionic matter fields under arbitrary spinorial\nrepresentations of the unbroken subgroup. This demonstrates that even for\nnon-supersymmetric spinors, the interactions are still severely restricted by\nthe nonlinearly realized symmetry. We also explain how supersymmetric models\nprovide an example for this construction with Goldstinos as matter fields, and\nhow one can use the $\\kappa$-symmetry of the Green Schwarz action in\nparticular, to verify this nonlinear transformation for a specific matter field\nrepresentation. We finally restrict the target space dimension without\nreference to supersymmetry, but rather by imposing one-loop integrability on a\nfermionic string that nonlinearly realizes Poincare symmetry. This singles out\nthe critical dimension $D=10$ for heterotic, GS and RNS supersymmetric strings.\n", "  There is a wide class of models which give a dynamical description of the\norigin of flavour in terms of spontaneous symmetry breaking of an underlying\nsymmetry. Many of these models exhibit sum rules which relate on the one hand\nmixing angles and the Dirac CP phase with each other and/or on the other hand\nneutrino masses and Majorana phases with each other. We will briefly sketch how\nthis happens and discuss briefly the impact of renormalisation group\ncorrections to the mass sum rules.\n", "  We propose an all-fiber-generated dual-soliton pulses based scheme for the\nbackground-free detection of coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy under the\nspectral focusing mechanism. Due to the strong birefringence and high\nnonlinearity of a polarization-maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF), two\nredshifted soliton pulses can be simultaneously generated relying on high-order\ndispersion and nonlinear effects along two eigenpolarization axes in the\nanomalous dispersion regime, while allowing feasible tunability of the\nfrequency distance and temporal interval between them. This proposed scheme,\ntermed as DS-CARS, exploits a unique combination of slight frequency-shift and\nadvisable temporal walk-off of this two soliton pulses to achieve robust and\nefficient suppression of nonresonant background with compact all-fiber coherent\nexcitation source. Capability of the DS-CARS is experimentally demonstrated by\nthe background-free CARS spectroscopy and unambiguous CARS microscopy of\npolymer beads in the fingerprint region.\n", "  Analysis of time-domain profiles for gravitational perturbations shows that\nGauss-Bonnet black holes in a de Sitter world possess a new kind of dynamical\ninstability which does not take place for asymptotically flat\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes. The new instability is in the gravitational\nperturbations of the scalar type and is due to the nonvanishing cosmological\nconstant. Analysis of the quasinormal spectrum in the stability sector shows\nthat although the scalar type of gravitational perturbations alone does not\nobey Hod's conjectural bound, connecting the damping rate and the Hawking\ntemperature, the vector and tensor types (and thereby the gravitational\nspectrum as a whole) do obey it.\n", "  Certain superposition states of the 1-D infinite square well have transient\nzeros at locations other than the nodes of the eigenstates that comprise them.\nIt is shown that if an infinite potential barrier is suddenly raised at some or\nall of these zeros, the well can be split into multiple adjacent infinite\nsquare wells without affecting the wavefunction. This effects a change of the\nenergy eigenbasis of the state to a basis that does not commute with the\noriginal, and a subsequent measurement of the energy now reveals a completely\ndifferent spectrum, which we call the {interference energy spectrum} of the\nstate. This name is appropriate because the same splitting procedure applied at\nthe stationary nodes of any eigenstate does not change the measurable energy of\nthe state. Of particular interest, this procedure can result in measurable\nenergies that are greater than the energy of the highest mode in the original\nsuperposition, raising questions about the conservation of energy akin to those\nthat have been raised in the study of superoscillations. An analytic derivation\nis given for the interference spectrum of a given wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$ with\n$N$ known zeros located at points $s_i = (x_i, t_i)$. Numerical simulations\nwere used to verify that a barrier can be rapidly raised at a zero of the\nwavefunction without significantly affecting it. The interpretation of this\nresult with respect to the conservation of energy and the energy-time\nuncertainty relation is discussed, and the idea of alternate energy eigenbases\nis fleshed out. The question of whether or not a preferred discrete energy\nspectrum is an inherent feature of a particle's quantum state is examined.\n", "  Oscillation amplitudes are generally smaller within magnetically active\nregions like sunspots and plage, when compared to their surroundings. Such\nmagnetic features, when viewed in spatially-resolved powermaps, appear as\nregions of suppressed power due to reductions in the oscillation amplitudes.\nEmploying high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations from the Dunn\nSolar Telescope (DST) in New Mexico, we study the power suppression in a region\nof evolving magnetic fields adjacent to a pore. By utilising wavelet analysis,\nwe study for the first time, how the oscillatory properties in this region\nchange as the magnetic field evolves with time. Image sequences taken in the\nblue continuum, G-band, Ca~\\textsc{ii}~K and H$\\alpha$ filters were used in\nthis study. It is observed that the suppression found in the chromosphere\noccupies a relatively larger area confirming previous findings. Also, the\nsuppression is extended to structures directly connected to the magnetic region\nand is found to get enhanced as the magnetic field strength increased with\ntime. The dependence of the suppression on the magnetic field strength is\ngreater at longer periods and higher formation heights. Furthermore, the\ndominant periodicity in the chromosphere was found to be anti-correlated with\nincreases in the magnetic field strength.\n", "  We study short-range quantum spin systems with Gaussian disorder. We obtain\nquantum mechanical extensions of the Ghirlanda-Guerra identities. We discuss\nproperties of overlap spin operators with these identities.\n", "  We report on a microwave planar ring antenna specifically designed for\noptically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers\nin diamond. It has the resonance frequency at around 2.87 GHz with the\nbandwidth of 400 MHz, ensuring that ODMR can be observed under external\nmagnetic fields up to 100 G without the need of adjustment of the resonance\nfrequency. It is also spatially uniform within the 1-mm-diameter center hole,\nenabling the magnetic-field imaging in the wide spatial range. These features\nfacilitate the experiments on quantum sensing and imaging using NV centers at\nroom temperature.\n", "  In a supersymmetric extension of the standard model where baryon and lepton\nnumbers are local gauge symmetries(BLMSSM), we deduce the Feynman rules for\nneutrinos and new neutralinos. We briey introduce the mass matrices for the\nparticles and the related couplings in this work, which are very useful to\nresearch the neutrinos and new neutralinos.\n", "  Quasiharmonic lattice dynamics calculations are carried out on SiO2-TiO2\nglass mixtures (TiO2 less than or equal to 20 weight percent) showing that the\naddition of TiO2 systematically lowers the thermal expansion of high purity\nfused silica. Adding ten weight percent titania lowers the thermal expansion\ncoefficient by approximately 0.5 ppm/K in agreement with observations. The\ndriving force for lowering the thermal expansion coefficient in the model\nsystem is broken down into mode-by-mode contributions. The driving force is\ndistributed broadly across the frequency spectrum and is not localized into\nparticular frequency ranges that can be associated with the coordination\nstructure of Ti4+ in the simulated glass.\n", "  In this talk I summarize a novel framework that unifies the stunning success\nof MOND on galactic scales with the triumph of the $\\Lambda$CDM model on\ncosmological scales. This is achieved through the rich and well-studied physics\nof superfluidity. The dark matter and MOND components have a common origin,\nrepresenting different phases of a single underlying substance. In galaxies,\ndark matter thermalizes and condenses to form a superfluid phase. The\nsuperfluid phonons couple to baryonic matter particles and mediate a MOND-like\nforce. This framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher\ntemperature in clusters, and hence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal\nphase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a number of\nstriking observational signatures, which we briefly discuss. Remarkably the\ncritical temperature and equation of state of the dark matter superfluid are\nsimilar to those of known cold atom systems. Identifying a precise cold atom\nanalogue would give important insights on the microphysical interactions\nunderlying DM superfluidity. Tantalizingly, it might open the possibility of\nsimulating the properties and dynamics of galaxies in laboratory experiments.\n", "  I present the exact solution of a family of fragmented Bose-Hubbard models\nand represent the models as graphs in one-dimension, two-dimensions and\nthree-dimensions with the condensates in the vertices. The models are solved by\nthe algebraic Bethe ansatz method.\n", "  Performance of nuclear threat detection systems based on gamma-ray\nspectrometry often strongly depends on the ability to identify the part of\nmeasured signal that can be attributed to background radiation. We have\nsuccessfully applied a method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to\nobtain a compact null-space model of background spectra using PCA projection\nresiduals to derive a source detection score. We have shown the method's\nutility in a threat detection system using mobile spectrometers in urban scenes\n(Tandon et al 2012). While it is commonly assumed that measured photon counts\nfollow a Poisson process, standard PCA makes a Gaussian assumption about the\ndata distribution, which may be a poor approximation when photon counts are\nlow. This paper studies whether and in what conditions PCA with a Poisson-based\nloss function (Poisson PCA) can outperform standard Gaussian PCA in modeling\nbackground radiation to enable more sensitive and specific nuclear threat\ndetection.\n", "  The concept of C-symmetry originally appeared in PT-symmetric quantum\nmechanics is studied within the Krein spaces framework.\n", "  Turbulent flow across an in-line array of tube-banks with transverse and\nlongitudinal pitch PT /D = 2.67, and PL /D = 2.31, has been simulated\nsuccessfully by Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based on the dynamic Smagorinsky\nsubgrid scale model (SGS), in which a wall-layer model is used to reduce the\ncomputational cost. The flow structures across the tube-banks were examined\nthrough the normalized Q criterion. The surface pressure characteristics from\nthe middle cylinder within each column of cylinders are found to agree well\nwith the existing experimental data, as did also the values of drag and lift\ncoefficients. These results indicate that cylinders from the second column\nexperience the minimum drag force and maximum lift force fluctuation. Spectral\nanalyses were performed for velocity signals sampled behind each middle\ncylinder axis, which show that the dominant vortex shedding frequency does not\nvary across the tube-banks. On this basis, we also examined the shear layer\ninstability. Finally, we report auto-correlation functions for streamwise and\ncross velocity fluctuations as a function of the spanwise length.\n", "  The ridgetron is used to accelerate the intense beam for the electron\nirradiation. According to the electromagnetic field simulation, the extend\nelectrode should be cancelled to increase the shunt impedence. The method of\nparameter sweeping with constraint variables (PSCV) is used to scan the\nmechanical parameters of the cavity to optimize the shunt impedence. The\nthermal analysis also has been done for water cooling. The beam dynamic\nsimulation has been done at last.\n", "  We transform the way of finding entanglement criterion into two steps: to\nobtain necessary criterion of separability by maximizing an algebra function\nfor a set of characteristic variables of the witness operator and the given\nnumber of partitions, then to obtain the sufficient criterion by minimizing an\nalgebra function with respect to the characteristic variables for a given\nquantum state. Our method avoids the semi-definite program calculation in the\nwitness operator entanglement detection. The necessary and sufficient criterion\nof separability for the three qubit X shaped state is given to illustrate the\nprocedure of finding the criterion. We give the necessary and sufficient\ncriteria of the three partite and full separabilities for the four qubit noisy\nGHZ state and the four qubit noisy cluster state.\n", "  We present the multiply phased current carrying vortex solutions in the U(1)\ngauge theory coupled to an $(N+1)$-component SU(N+1) scalar multiplet in the\nBogomolny limit. Our vortex solutions correspond to the static vortex dressed\nwith traveling waves along the axis of symmetry. What is notable in our vortex\nsolutions is that the frequencies of traveling waves in each component of the\nscalar field can have different values. The energy of the static vortex is\nproportional to the topological charge of $CP^N$ model in the BPS limit, and\nthe multiple phase of the vortex supplies additional energy contribution which\nis proportional to the Noether charge associated to the remaining symmetry.\n", "  We propose a new type of non-uniform condensate state in the presence of\ntime-reversal symmetry. The underlying platform of this state is a corrugated\nhoneycomb lattice which exhibits an inhomogeneous pseudo magnetic field. Using\nthe self-consistent tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism, we show that\nan s-wave pairing of chiral carriers in the presence of an inhomogeneous pseudo\nmagnetic field results in a spatially modulated order parameter with the half\nwavelength of the corrugation. The manner of modulation depends on the\nfundamental directions of the honeycomb lattice, the zigzag and armchair\ndirections. The stability of this inhomogeneous superconductivity is also\nanalyzed and possible experimental realization is discussed.\n", "  We analyze the two-body charmed $B$ meson decays $B_{u,d,s} \\to D^{(*)}P(V)$\nin the factorization assisted topological amplitude approach, where $P(V)$\ndenoting a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson. Different from the conventional\ntopological diagram approach, flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking effects are\ntaken into account. Therefore only four universal nonperturbative parameters\nare introduced to describe the contribution from non-factorization diagrams for\nall the decay channels. The number of free parameters and the $\\chi^2$ per\ndegree of freedom are both significantly reduced comparing with the\nconventional topological diagram approach. With the 4 fitted parameters, we\npredict the branching fractions of 120 decay modes induced by both $b\\to c$ and\n$b\\to u$ transitions, which are well consistent with the measured data or to be\ntested on the future experiments. We also investigated the relative size of\ndifferent topological diagrams, isospin violation, flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry\nbreaking effects, compared with previous approaches.\n", "  Element synthesis which started with p-p chain has resulted in several\nspecific characteristics including lack of any stable isotope having atomic\nmasses 5 or 8. The carbon to oxygen ratio is fixed early by the chain of\ncoincidences. These, remarkably fine-tuned, conditions are responsible for our\nown existence and indeed the existence of any carbon based life in the\nUniverse. Chemical evolution of galaxies reflects in the changes of chemical\ncomposition of stars, interstellar gas and dust. The evolution of chemical\nelement abundances in a galaxy provides a clock for galactic aging. On the\nother hand, the living matter on the planet Earth needs only some elements for\nits existence. Compared with element requirements of living matter a hypothesis\nis put forward, by accepting the Anthropic Principle, which says: life as we\nknow, (H-C-N-O) based, relying on the number of bulk and trace elements\noriginated when two element abundance curves, living matter and galactic,\ncoincided. This coincidence occurring at particular redshift could indicates\nthe phase of the Universe when the life originated. It is proposed to look into\nredshift region z = 0.5 to 2.5 (approximately t = -5.2x10E9 to -11.3x10E9\nyears) where many galaxies have been observed and to use these data to study\nthe evolution of metallicity with respect to the other properties of galaxies\nin order to determine the time when universal element abundance curve coincided\nwith the element abundance curve of LUCA. The characteristic properties of the\nlatter have been transmitted by the genetic code while the universe element\nabundance curve changed as the galaxies aged.\n", "  The devil is in the detail: Periodic and aperiodic spin-state concentration\nwaves form during \"Devil's staircase\"-type spincrossover in a new bimetallic 2D\ncoordination polymer {Fe[(Hg(SCN)3)2](4,4'-bipy)2}n.The unprecedented\nbimetallic 2D coordination polymer {Fe[(Hg(SCN)3)2](4,4'-bipy)2}n exhibits a\nthermal high-spin (HS)$low-spin (LS) staircase-like conversion characterized by\na multi-step dependence of the HS molar fraction gHS. Between the fully HS\n(gHS=1) and LS (gHS=0) phases, two steps associated with different ordering\nappear in terms of spin-state concentration waves (SSCW). On the gHS=0.5 step,\na periodic SSCW forms with a HS-LS-HS-LS sequence. On the gHS=0.34 step, the 4D\nsuperspace crystallography structural refinement reveals an aperiodic SSCW,\nwith a HS-LS sequence incommensurate with the molecular lattice. The formation\nof these different long-range spatially ordered structures of LS and HS states\nduring the multi-step spin-crossover is discussed within the framework of\n\"Devil's staircase\"-type transitions. Spatially modulated phases are known in\nvarious types of materials but are uniquely related to molecular HS/LS\nbistability in this case.\n", "  In the HERAPDF2.0 PDF analysis it was noted that the fit $\\chi^2$ worsens\nsignificantly at low $Q^2$ for both NLO and NNLO fits. The turn over of the\nreduced cross section at low-$x$ and low $Q^2$ due to the contribution of the\nlongitudinal cross section $F_L$ is also not very well described. In this paper\nthe prediction for $F_L$ is highlighted and the corresponding extraction of\n$F_2$ from the data is further investigated, showing discrepancies with\ndescription of HERAPDF2.0 at low $x$ and $Q^2$. The effect of adding a simple\nhigher twist term of the form ~$F_L*A/Q^2$ to the description of $F_L$ is\ninvestigated. This results in a significantly better description of the reduced\ncross-sections, $F_2$ and $F_L$ at low $x$, $Q^2$ and a significantly lower\n$\\chi^2$ for the NNLO fit as compared to the NLO fit. This is not the case if\nthe higher twist term is added to $F_2$\n", "  The atmospheric activity of the Sun and Sun-like stars is analyzed involving\nobservations from HK-project at the Mount Wilson Observatory, the California\nand Carnegie Planet Search Program at the Keck and Lick Observatories and the\nMagellan Planet Search Program at the Las Campanas Observatory. We show that\nfor stars of F, G and K spectral classes, the cyclic activity, similar to the\n11-yr solar cycles, is different: it becomes more prominent in K-stars.\nComparative study of Sun-like stars with different levels of the chromospheric\nand coronal activity confirms that the Sun belongs to stars with the low level\nof the chromospheric activity and stands apart among these stars by the minimum\nlevel of its coronal radiation and the minimum level of its variations of the\nphotospheric flux.\n", "  In the paper, the authors elaborate some recently published research\nconcerning the originality of artworks in terms of self-organization in the\ncomplex systems physics. It has been demonstrated that the originality issue\nsuch conceived leads to the criterion of a substantial aesthetics whose\napplicability is not restricted to the fine arts domain only covering also\nphysics, biology, cosmology and other fields construed in the complex systems\nterms. Moreover, it is about a truth criterion related to the traditional\npersonality conception revealing the ontological context transcendent to the\ngnoseological dualism of subjective and objective reality that is\ncharacteristic of modern science and humanities. Thus, it is considered to be\nan aesthetical criterion substantiating art and science as well as the other\ndevelopments of the postmodern era. Its impact to psychology, education,\necology, culture and other humanities is briefly indicated.\n", "  Molecular dynamics calculations are carried out on pure, Al-substituted, and\nIn-substituted LLZO. The calculations show that the tendency of Al to occupy\nthe 24d sites in LLZO lithium ion conductors is hypothesized here to negatively\nimpact ionic conductivity. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of In-LLZO,\nin which the In resides at the 48g sites, is predicted to be an order of\nmagnitude higher than Al-LLZO. Consideration of the simple tetrahedral topology\nof the lithium ion conduction network suggests that the increased conductivity\narises because the 48g site sits at a bridge in the lithium ion conduction\nnetwork. An immobile ion residing in this location blocks fewer lithium\nconduction pathways than an ion, such as Al, that preferentially occupies the\n24d site located at a node within the network. In addition, the electronic\nstructure calculations presented here indicate no large difference in the\nstabilities of tetragonal and cubic phases for the aluminum-substituted and\nindium-substituted compounds. In both cases, the cubic phase is more stable\nthan the tetragonal phase. This indicates that it should be possible to make a\ncubic In-LLZO phase with significant conductivity enhancement over the cubic\nAl-LLZO phase.\n", "  This paper presents a model of coagulation in electrolyte solutions. In this\npaper, the coagulation process is modeled according to DLVO-theory, which is an\natomistic theory. On the other hand, we describe the dynamics in the\nelectrolyte solutions by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system, which is a continuum\nmodel. The contribution of this paper is to include the atomistic description\nof coagulation based on DLVO-theory in the continuum Poisson-Nernst-Planck\nsystem. Thereby, we involve information from different spatial scales. For this\nreason, the presented model accounts for the short-range interactions and the\nlong-range interactions, which drive the coagulation process. Furthermore,\nmany-body effects are naturally included as the resulting model is a continuum\nmodel.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to introduce Condensed-Matter-Laboratory (CML)\napplication for simulating solids and nanostructures and calculating different\nproperties of them by density functional theory and using Green's function\ntheory in tight-binding approximation to calculate phononic and spin dependent\nor independent electronic properties of different systems. Also, it can be used\nfor calculating thermodynamic properties of solids and nanostructures using\nstatistical mechanics. The CML is a cross-platform application with a graphical\nuser interface design that is user-friendly and easy to work with. This\napplication is written in c++ and fortran and has parallel processing ability.\nTo show flexibility of this application some reasons are presented.\n", "  This is the second part of a three-part overview, in which we derive the\ncategory-theoretic backbone of quantum theory from a process ontology, treating\nquantum theory as a theory of systems, processes and their interactions. In\nthis part we focus on classical-quantum interaction.\n  Classical and quantum systems are treated as distinct types, of which the\nrespective behavioural properties are specified in terms of processes and their\ncompositions. In particular, classicality is witnessed by 'spiders' which fuse\ntogether whenever they connect. We define mixedness and show that pure\nprocesses are extremal in the space of all processes, and we define\nentanglement and show that quantum theory indeed exhibits entanglement. We\ndiscuss the classification of tripartite qubit entanglement and show that both\nthe GHZ-state and the W-state come from spider-like families of processes,\nwhich differ only in how they behave when they are connected by two or more\nwires. We define measurements and provide fully-comprehensive descriptions of\nseveral quantum protocols involving classical data flow. Finally, we give a\nnotion of 'genuine quantumness', from which special processes called 'phase\nspiders' arise, and get a first glimpse of quantum non-locality.\n", "  Under investigation in this paper are the coupled complex short pulse\nequations, which describe the propagation of ultra-short optical pulses in\ncubic nonlinear media.Through the Hirota method, bright-dark one- and\ntwo-soliton solutions are obtained. Interactions between two bright or two dark\nsolitons are verified to be elastic through the asymptotic analysis. With\ndifferent parameter conditions of the vector bright-dark two solitons, the\noblique interactions, bound states of solitons and parallel solitons are\nanalyzed.\n", "  The maximum Lyapunov exponent (referred to the mean half-period of phase\nlibration) of the motion in the chaotic layer of a nonlinear resonance subject\nto symmetric periodic perturbation, in the limit of infinitely high frequency\nof the perturbation, has been numerically estimated by two independent methods.\nThe newly derived value of this constant is 0.80, with precision presumably\nbetter than 0.01.\n", "  This paper investigates the long-time behavior of double branching\nannihilating random walkers with nearest-neighbor dependent rates. The system\nconsists of even number of particles which can execute nearest-neighbor random\nwalk and they can as well give birth in a parity conserving manner to two other\nparticles with rates $1$ and $b$, respectively, until they meet. Upon meeting,\neach of the adjacent particles can branch with rate $p\\cdot b$ while it can\nannihilate, i.e. hop on, the other particle with rate $p$ for some $0< p\\leq\n1$. This process first appeared in the article by D. ben Avraham, F. Leyvraz\nand S. Redner (Propagation and extinction in branching annihilating random\nwalks, Phys. Rev. E 50(3), 1994) and can be considered as the extension of\nSudbury's model (The branching annihilating process: an interacting particle\nsystem, Ann. Probab., 18(2), 1990). We prove that in some region of the\nparameters $(p,b)$, the process survives with positive probability. Combining\nwith Sudbury's extinction result it shows a phase transition phenomenon for\nthis model. In some sense our result also shows the sharpness of the\nassumptions of the article by M. Bal\\'azs and A. L. Nagy (Dependent double\nbranching annihilating random walk, Electron. J. Probab., 20(84), 2015). We use\nsimilar arguments that was developed by M. Bramson and L. Gray in their article\ntitled \"The survival of branching annihilating random walk\" (Z. Wahrsch. Verw.\nGebiete, 68(4), 1985).\n", "  We present cross sections for diphoton production in (semi)exclusive $PbPb$\ncollisions, relevant for the LHC. The calculation is based on equivalent photon\napproximation in the impact parameter space. The cross sections for elementary\nelastic scattering $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ subprocess are calculated\nincluding two mechanisms: box diagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops and\na mechanism based on vector-meson dominance (VDM-Regge) model with virtual\nintermediate vector-like excitations of the photons. We get measureable cross\nsections in $PbPb$ collisions. We present many interesting differential\ndistributions which could be measured by the ALICE, CMS or ATLAS Collaborations\nat the LHC. We study whether a separation of box and VDM-Regge contributions is\npossible. We find that the cross section for elastic $\\gamma \\gamma$ scattering\ncould be measured in the heavy-ion collisions for subprocess energies smaller\nthan $W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx 15-20$~GeV.\n", "  The topological susceptibility is an important quantity in QCD, which can be\ncomputed using lattice methods. However, at a fine lattice spacing, or when\nusing high quality chirally symmetric quarks, algorithms which proceed in small\nupdate steps --- in particular the HMC algorithm --- tend to get stuck in a\nsingle topological sector. In such cases, the computation of the topological\nsusceptibility is not straightforward. Here, we explore two methods to extract\nthe topological susceptibility from lattice QCD simulations restricted to a\nsingle topological sector. The first method is based on the correlation\nfunction of the topological charge density, while the second method relies on\nmeasuring the topological charge within spacetime subvolumes. Numerical results\nfor two-flavor QCD obtained by using both methods are presented.\n", "  The ground-state properties of one-dimensional electron-spin-polarized\nhydrogen $^1$H, deuterium $^2$H, and tritium $^3$H are obtained by means of\nquantum Monte Carlo methods. The equations of state of the three isotopes are\ncalculated for a wide range of linear densities. The pair correlation function\nand the static structure factor are obtained and interpreted within the\nframework of the Luttinger liquid theory. We report the density dependence of\nthe Luttinger parameter and use it to identify different physical regimes:\nBogoliubov Bose gas, super-Tonks-Girardeau gas, and quasi-crystal regimes for\nbosons; repulsive, attractive Fermi gas, and quasi-crystal regimes for\nfermions. We find that the tritium isotope is the one with the richest\nbehaviour. Our results show unambiguously the relevant role of the isotope mass\nin the properties of this quantum system.\n", "  Understanding of the electrical contact properties of semiconductor nanowire\n(NW) field effect transistors (FETs) plays a crucial role in employing\nsemiconducting NWs as building blocks for future nanoelectronic devices and in\nthe study of fundamental physics problems. Here, we report on a study of the\ncontact properties of Ti/Au, a widely used contact metal combination, to\nindividual InSb NWs via both two-probe and four-probe transport measurements.\nWe show that a Schottky barrier of height $\\Phi_{\\rm{SB}}\\sim20\\ \\rm{meV}$ is\npresent at the metal-InSb NW interfaces and its effective height is gate\ntunable. The contact resistance ($R_{\\rm{c}}$) in the InSb NWFETs is also\nanalyzed by magnetotransport measurements at low temperatures. It is found that\n$R_{\\rm{c}}$ at on-state exhibits a pronounced magnetic field dependent\nfeature, namely it is increased strongly with increasing magnetic field after\nan onset field $B_{\\rm{c}}$. A qualitative picture that takes into account\nmagnetic depopulation of subbands in the NWs is provided to explain the\nobservation. Our results provide a solid experimental evidence for the presence\nof a Schottky barrier at Ti/Au-InSb NW interfaces and can be used as a basis\nfor design and fabrication of novel InSb NW based nanoelectronic devices and\nquantum devices.\n", "  Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most\nprevalent and dangerous pulmonary diseases in the world. It is forecasted that\nCOPD will be the third deadly disease in the future. Therefore, developing\nnon-invasive methods for diagnosis of the disease would be helpful for\nphysicians and patients.\n  Methods: Based on clinical investigations and spirometry tests, ten adult\npatients with COPD (6 male and 4 female) with mean age of 49.8 years were\nenrolled as the case group. In addition, ten age and sex-matched healthy,\nnon-COPD individuals (6 male and 4 female) with mean age of 45.4 years were\nrecruited as the controls. Lung CT-scan images of the subjects were processed\nand analyzed by a computer to find a relationship.\n  Findings: The elasticity of lung parenchyma variation was obtained with\ndigital image processing. The normalized average of this pattern was found to\nbe 21.6% in patients and 40.7% in controls. In addition, normalized mean value\nof Hounsfield unit variations in square 10 pixel * 10 pixel windows in the\nexpiratory images were calculated as a parameter of air-trapping in COPD.\nDifferences between the groups were shown by student t-test (P < 0.05).\n  Conclusion: This study showed that the variation of lung parenchyma\nelasticity and Hounsfield units are found by processing and analysis of the\nfull inspiration and expiration images. These factors can be used as criteria\nin diagnosis of COPD. Moreover, the severity of the disease can be presented by\nthe proposed method.\n  Keywords: Air-trapping, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Image\nprocessing and analysis, CT-scan lung images\n", "  In this paper an alternative approach to statistical mechanics based on the\nmaximum information entropy principle (MaxEnt) is examined, specifically its\nclose relation with the Gibbs method of ensembles. It is shown that the MaxEnt\nformalism is the logical extension of the Gibbs formalism of equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics that is entirely independent of the frequentist\ninterpretation of probabilities only as factual (i.e. experimentally\nverifiable) properties of the real world. Furthermore, we show that,\nconsistently with the law of large numbers, the relative frequencies of the\nensemble of systems prepared under identical conditions (i.e. identical\nconstraints) actually correspond to the MaxEnt probabilites in the limit of a\nlarge number of systems in the ensemble. This result implies that the\nprobabilities in statistical mechanics can be interpreted, independently of the\nfrequency interpretation, on the basis of the maximum information entropy\nprinciple.\n", "  We discuss a method of parameter reduction in complex models known as the\nManifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM). This approach, based on a\ngeometric interpretation of statistics, maps the model reduction problem to a\ngeometric approximation problem. It operates iteratively, removing one\nparameter at a time, by approximating a high-dimension, but thin manifold by\nits boundary. Although the method makes no explicit assumption about the\nfunctional form of the model, it does require that the model manifold exhibit a\nhierarchy of boundaries, i.e., faces, edges, corners, hyper-corners, etc. We\nempirically show that a variety of model classes have this curious feature,\nmaking them amenable to MBAM. These model classes include models composed of\nelementary functions (e.g., rational functions, exponentials, and partition\nfunctions), a variety of dynamical system (e.g., chemical and biochemical\nkinetics, Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems, and compartment models), network\nmodels (e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov chains, artificial neural networks, and\nMarkov random fields), log-linear probability distributions, and models with\nsymmetries. We discuss how MBAM recovers many common approximation methods for\neach model class and discuss potential pitfalls and limitations.\n", "  We analyse the $3+1$ D equilibrium chiral magnetic effect (CME). We apply\nderivative expansion to the Wigner transform of the two - point Green function.\nThis technique allows us to express the response of electric current to\nexternal electromagnetic field strength through the momentum space topological\ninvariant. We consider the wide class of the lattice regularizations of quantum\nfield theory (that includes, in particular, the regularization with Wilson\nfermions) and also certain lattice models of solid state physics (including\nthose of Dirac semimetals). It appears, that in these models the mentioned\ntopological invariant vanishes identically at nonzero chiral chemical\npotential. That means, that the bulk equilibrium CME is absent in those\nsystems.\n", "  We have calculated numerically electron exchange, correlation energies and\ndynamical polarization function for newly discovered silicene, germanene and\nblack phosphorus (BP), consisting of puckered layers of elemental phosphorus\natoms, broadening the range of two-dimensional (2D) materials at various\ntemperatures. As a matter of fact, monolayer BP, produced by mechanical and\nliquid exfoliation techniques, has been predicted to be an insulator with a\nlarge energy splitting 1.6 eV for the quasiparticle band structure. We compare\nthe dependence of these energies on the chemical potential, field-induced gap\nand the temperature and concluded that in many cases they behave qualitatively\nsimilarly, i.e., increasing with the doping, decreasing significantly at\nelevated temperatures, and displaying different dependence on the asymmetry gap\nat various temperatures. Furthermore, we used the dynamical polarizability to\ninvestigate the new \"split\" plasmon branches in the puckered lattices and\npredict a unique splitting, different from that in gapped graphene, for various\nenergy gaps. Our results are crucial for stimulating electronic, transport and\ncollective studies of these novel materials, as well as for enhancing\nsilicene-based fabrication and technologies for photovoltaics and transistor\ndevices.\n", "  Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC) based conduction has been identified for\nPCMO-based RRAM devices based on the observation that $I \\propto V^{\\alpha}$\nwhere $\\alpha \\approx 2$. A critical feature of the IV characteristics is a\nsharp rise in current ($\\alpha \\gg 2$) which has been widely attributed to\ntrap-filled limit (TFL) followed by an apparent trap-free SCLC conduction. In\nthis paper, we show by TCAD analysis that trap-filled limit (TFL) is\ninsufficient to explain the sharp current rise ($\\alpha \\gg 2$). As an\nalternative, we propose a shallow trap SCLC model with selfheating effect based\nthermal runaway to explain the sharp current rise followed by a series\nresistance dominated regime. Experimental results over a range of\n25{\\deg}C-125{\\deg}C demonstrate all 4 regimes (i) Ohmic ($\\alpha = 1$), (ii)\nshallow trap SCLC ($\\alpha \\approx 2$), (iii) current shoot up ($\\alpha \\gg 2$)\nand (iv) series resistance ($\\alpha = 1$). Further, TCAD simulations with\nthermal modeling are able to match the experimental IV characteristics in all\nthe regimes. Thus, a current conduction mechanism in PCMO-based RRAM supported\nby detailed TCAD model is presented. Such a model is essential for further\nquantitative understanding and design for PCMO-based RRAM.\n", "  The influence of atomic vacancy defects at different concentrations on\nelectronic properties of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ monolayers is studied by means of\nSlater-Koster tight-binding model with non-orthogonal $sp^3d^5$ orbitals and\nincluding the spin-orbit coupling. The presence of vacancy defects induces\nlocalized states in the bandgap of pristine MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$, which have\npotential to modify the electronic structure of the systems, depending on the\ntype and concentration of the defects. It is shown that although the\ncontribution of metal (Mo or W) $d$ orbitals is dominant in the formation of\nmidgap states, the sulphur $p$ and $d$ orbitals have also considerable\ncontribution in the localized states, when metal defects are introduced. Our\nresults suggest that Mo and W defects can turn the monolayers into p-type\nsemiconductors, while the sulphur defects make the system a n-type\nsemiconductor, in agreement with ab initio results and experimental\nobservations.\n", "  Conditions for the emergence of a statistical relationship between $T_r$, the\nchaotic transport (recurrence) time, and $T_L$, the local Lyapunov time (the\ninverse of the numerically measured largest Lyapunov characteristic exponent),\nare considered for the motion inside the chaotic layer around the separatrix of\na nonlinear resonance. When numerical values of the Lyapunov exponents are\nmeasured on a time interval not greater than $T_r$, the relationship is shown\nto resemble the quadratic one. This tentatively explains numerical results\npresented in the literature.\n", "  In this paper we describe a set of circuits that can measure the concurrence\nof a two qubit density matrix without requiring the deliberate addition of\nnoise. We then extend these methods to obtain a circuit to measure one type of\nthree qubit entanglement for pure states, namely the 3-tangle.\n"]}
