constant. The\ntwo types of effects could originate from a fluid of both spatially and\ntemporally varying Vacuum Energy if the vacuum has an uneven pressure caused by\na photon-like vector field (of perhaps an unstable massive boson). We propose a\nmost general Lagrangian with a {\\bf N}on-{\\bf u}niform Cosmological Constant\nfor this vacuum fluid (dubbed as a Nu-Lambda fluid), working within the\nframework of Einsteinian gravity. This theory includes a continuous spectrum of\nplausible dark energy theories and gravity theories, e.g., inflation,\nquintessence, k-essence, f(R), Generalized Einstein-Aether f(K), MOND, TeVeS,\nBSTV etc. theories. It also suggests new models such as a certain f(K+R) model,\nwhich suggests intriguing corrections to MOND depending of redshift and\ndensity. Some specific constructions of the Nu-Lambda fluid (e.g., Zhao's\nV-$\\Lambda$ model) closely resemble the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology on large scale,\nbut fit galaxy rotation curves as good as MOND. Perturbed Einstein Equations in\na simple $f(K_4)$ model are solvable and show effects of a DM coupled to DE.\nIncorporating the perturbation equations here into standard simulations for\ncosmological structure growth offers a chance to falsify examples of the\nNu-Lambda theories.\n", "  This work studies the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions in a\nscenario where it is only required that the query algorithm succeeds with a\nprobability strictly greater than 1/2. We show that, just as in the\ncommunication complexity model, the unbounded error quantum query complexity is\nexactly half of its classical counterpart for any (partial or total) Boolean\nfunction. Moreover, we show that the \"black-box\" approach to convert quantum\nquery algorithms into communication protocols by Buhrman-Cleve-Wigderson\n[STOC'98] is optimal even in the unbounded error setting.\n  We also study a setting related to the unbounded error model, called the\nweakly unbounded error setting, where the cost of a query algorithm is given by\nq+log(1/2(p-1/2)), where q is the number of queries made and p>1/2 is the\nsuccess probability of the algorithm. In contrast to the case of communication\ncomplexity, we show a tight Theta(log n) separation between quantum and\nclassical query complexity in the weakly unbounded error setting for a partial\nBoolean function. We also show the asymptotic equivalence between them for some\nwell-studied total Boolean functions.\n", "  In this work we review some of the theoretical efforts and experimental\nevidences related to Dark matter and Dark energy problems in the universe.\nThese dilemmas show us how incomplete our knowledge of gravity is, and how our\nconcepts about the universe must at least be revised. Mainly, on the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) fifth year, the data indicates that more than\n90% of the total energy density of the universe is dark. Here we discuss the\nimpact of these phenomena imprint on gravitational and quantum field theory's\nstandard history. Moreover, we point out some recent and upcoming projects on\nCosmology intended to shed light on these problems.\n", "  The high-peaked BL Lac object Pks2155-304 shows high variability at\nmultiwavelengths, i.e. from optical up to TeV energies. A giant flare of around\n1 hour at X-ray and TeV energies was observed in 2006. In this context, it is\nessential to understand the physical processes in terms of the primary spectrum\nand the radiation emitted, since high-energy emission can arise in both\nleptonic and hadronic processes. In this contribution, we investigate the\npossibility of neutrino production in photo-hadronic interactions. In\nparticular, we predict a direct correlation between optical and TeV energies at\nsufficiently high optical radiation fields. We show that in the blazar\nPks2155-304, the optical emission in the low-state is sufficient to lead to\nphoto-hadronic interactions and therefore to the production of high-energy\nphotons.\n", "  Blazars, radio-loud active galactic nuclei with the relativistic jet closely\naligned with the line of sight, dominate the extragalactic sky observed at\ngamma-ray energies, above 100 MeV. We discuss some of the emission properties\nof these sources, focusing in particular on the \"blazar sequence\" and the\ninterpretative models of the high-energy emission of BL Lac objects.\n", "  We construct new galaxy angular power spectra based on the extended, updated\nand final SDSS II Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) photometric redshift survey: MegaZ\nDR7. Encapsulating 7746 deg^{2} we utilise 723,556 photometrically determined\nLRGs between 0.45 < z < 0.65 in a 3.3 (Gpc h^{-1})^3 spherical harmonic\nanalysis of the galaxy distribution. By combining four photometric redshift\nbins we find preliminary parameter constraints of f_{b} = \\Omega_{b}/\\Omega_{m}\n= 0.173 +/- 0.046 and \\Omega_{m} = 0.260 +/- 0.035 assuming H_{0} = 75 km\ns^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, n_{s}=1 and \\Omega_{k} = 0. These limits are consistent with\nthe CMB and the previous data release (DR4). The C_{\\ell} are sensitive to\nredshift space distortions and therefore we also recast our constraints into a\nmeasurement of \\beta ~ \\Omega_{m}^{0.55}/b in different redshift shells. The\nrobustness of these power spectra with respect to a number of potential\nsystematics such as extinction, photometric redshift and ANNz training set\nextrapolation are examined. The latter includes a cosmological comparison of\navailable photometric redshift estimation codes where we find excellent\nagreement between template and empirical estimation methods. MegaZ DR7\nrepresents a methodological prototype to next generation surveys such as the\nDark Energy Survey (DES) and, furthermore, is a photometric precursor to the\nspectroscopic BOSS survey. Our galaxy catalogue and all power spectra data can\nbe found at http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~sat/MegaZ/MegaZDR7.tar.gz.\n", "  We analyze the quantum-mechanical behavior of a system described by a\none-dimensional asymmetric potential constituted by a step plus (i) a linear\nbarrier or (ii) an exponential barrier. We solve the energy eigenvalue equation\nby means of the integral representation method, classifying the independent\nsolutions as equivalence classes of homotopic paths in the complex plane.\n  We discuss the structure of the bound states as function of the height U_0 of\nthe step and we study the propagation of a sharp-peaked wave packet reflected\nby the barrier. For both the linear and the exponential barrier we provide an\nexplicit formula for the delay time \\tau(E) as a function of the peak energy E.\nWe display the resonant behavior of \\tau(E) at energies close to U_0. By\nanalyzing the asymptotic behavior for large energies of the eigenfunctions of\nthe continuous spectrum we also show that, as expected, \\tau(E) approaches the\nclassical value for E -> \\infty, thus diverging for the step-linear case and\nvanishing for the step-exponential one.\n", "  It is easy to check that both algebraic equation Det (hat p - m) =0 and Det\n(hat p + m) =0 for u- and v- 4-spinors have solutions with p_0= pm E_p = pm\nsqrt bf p^2 +m^2. The same is true for higher-spin equations. Meanwhile, every\nbook considers the equality p_0=E_p for both u- and v- spinors of the\n(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)) representation only, thus applying the\nDirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg procedure for elimination of the negative-energy\nsolutions. The recent Ziino works (and, independently, the articles of several\nothers) show that the Fock space can be doubled. We re-consider this\npossibility on the quantum field level for both s=1/2 and higher spin\nparticles.\n", "  This paper investigates the number of quantum queries made to solve the\nproblem of reconstructing an unknown string from its substrings in a certain\nquery model. More concretely, the goal of the problem is to identify an unknown\nstring $S$ by making queries of the following form: \"Is $s$ a substring of\n$S$?\", where $s$ is a query string over the given alphabet. The number of\nqueries required to identify the string $S$ is the query complexity of this\nproblem.\n  First we show a quantum algorithm that exactly identifies the string $S$ with\nat most $3/4N + o(N)$ queries, where $N$ is the length of $S$. This contrasts\nsharply with the classical query complexity $N$. Our algorithm uses Skiena and\nSundaram's classical algorithm and the Grover search as subroutines. To make\nthem effectively work, we develop another subroutine that finds a string\nappearing only once in $S$, which may have an independent interest. We also\nprove two lower bounds. The first one is a general lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\frac{N}{\\log^2{N}})$, which means we cannot achieve a query complexity\nof $O(N^{1-\\epsilon})$ for any constant $\\epsilon$. The other one claims that\nif we cannot use queries of length roughly between $\\log N$ and $3 \\log N$,\nthen we cannot achieve a query complexity of any sublinear function in $N$.\n", "  Surface anti-reflectance and passivation properties of the Al2O3 films\ndeposited on crystalline Si substrates by atomic layer deposition are\ninvestigated. Textured Si with 100 nm Al2O3 shows a very low average\nreflectance of ~2.8 %. Both p-type and n-type Si wafers are well passivated by\nAl2O3 films. The maximal minority carrier lifetimes are improved from ~10\n{\\mu}s before Al2O3 passivation to above 3 ms for both p-type and n-type Si\nafter Al2O3 passivation layer deposition and annealing at an appropriate\ntemperature. Our results indicate the dual functions of anti-reflectance and\nsurface passivation in c-Si solar cell applications.\n", "  The only prominent line of singly ionized helium in the visible spectral\nrange, helium-II 4686 A, is observed together with the helium-I 5015 A singlet\nand the helium-I 4471 A triplet line in solar prominences. The sodium emission,\nNaD2, is used as a tracer for helium-II emissions which are sufficiently bright\nto exceed the noise level near 10^-6 of the disk-center intensity. The so\nselected prominences are characterized by small non-thermal line broadening and\nalmost absent velocity shifts, yielding narrow line profiles without wiggles.\nThe reduced widths [Delta(lambda_D) / lambda] of helium-II 4686 A are 1.5 times\nbroader than those of helium-I 4471 A triplet and 1.65 times broader than those\nof helium-I 5015 A singlet. This indicates that the helium lines originate in a\nprominence--corona transition region with outwards increasing temperature.\n", "  This paper presents stronger methods of achieving perfect completeness in\nquantum interactive proofs. First, it is proved that any problem in QMA has a\ntwo-message quantum interactive proof system of perfect completeness with\nconstant soundness error, where the verifier has only to send a constant number\nof halves of EPR pairs. This in particular implies that the class QMA is\nnecessarily included by the class QIP_1(2) of problems having two-message\nquantum interactive proofs of perfect completeness, which gives the first\nnontrivial upper bound for QMA in terms of quantum interactive proofs. It is\nalso proved that any problem having an $m$-message quantum interactive proof\nsystem necessarily has an $(m+1)$-message quantum interactive proof system of\nperfect completeness. This improves the previous result due to Kitaev and\nWatrous, where the resulting system of perfect completeness requires $m+2$\nmessages if not using the parallelization result.\n", "  The uncertainty about a possible correlation between strength and inclination\nof the magnetic field and the continuum intensity of the sunspot penumbral\nfine-structure has been removed by a detailed analysis of a spatially very high\nresolved spectrum: the darker, lengthy penumbral lanes host a 10% stronger and\n>30 deg flatter magnetic field as compared to the bright penumbral locations.\nThis finding does not only result from the high spatial resolution but also\nfrom the choice of the Fe I 6842.7 line, which obtains its essential\ncontribution from those deep layers near the continuum intensity level where\nthe penumbral structure is seen. The almost perfect correlation establishes\nthat the penumbral structure is formed by two magnetic components mainly\ndiffering by their field inclination. The discrepancy with results from other\nZeeman lines, as e.g. Fe I 6302.5, indicates a different field structure above\nthe white light penumbral layers.\n", "  A vibronic-exciton model is applied to investigate the mechanism of\nenhancement of coherent oscillations due to mixing of electronic and nuclear\ndegrees of freedom recently proposed as the origin of the long-lived\noscillations in 2D spectra of the FMO complex [Christensson et al. J. Phys.\nChem. B 116 (2012) 7449]. We reduce the problem to a model BChl dimer to\nelucidate the role of resonance coupling, site energies, nuclear mode and\nenergy disorder in the enhancement of vibronic-exciton and ground-state\nvibrational coherences, and to identify regimes where this enhancement is\nsignificant. For a heterodimer representing the two coupled BChls 3 and 4 of\nthe FMO complex, the initial amplitude of the vibronic-exciton and vibrational\ncoherences are enhanced by up to 15 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the\nvibrational coherences in the isolated monomer. This maximum initial amplitude\nenhancement occurs when there is a resonance between the electronic energy gap\nand the frequency of the vibrational mode. The bandwidth of this enhancement is\nabout 100 cm-1 for both mechanisms. The excitonic mixing of electronic and\nvibrational DOF leads to additional dephasing relative to the vibrational\ncoherences. We evaluate the dephasing dynamics by solving the quantum master\nequation in Markovian approximation and observe a strong dependence of the\nlife-time enhancement on the mode frequency. Long-lived vibronic-exciton\ncoherences are found to be generated only when the frequency of the mode is in\nthe vicinity of the electronic resonance. Although the vibronic-exciton\ncoherences exhibit a larger initial amplitude compared to the ground-state\nvibrational coherences, we conclude that both type have a similar magnitude at\nlong time for the present model. The ability to distinguish between\nvibronic-exciton and ground-state vibrational coherences in the general case of\nmolecular aggregate is discussed.\n", "  The paper presents several quantum models constructed with the formalism of\nalgebraic geometry. The Universe is presented as a presheaf on the \"space of\nultimation\" (i.e. the branching future) with values in certain category which\nenhances the category opposite to C*-algebras. Given models show the\npossibility to derive ordinary space-times (of both Special and General\nRelativity) from ultrametric spaces.\n", "  Multinucleon transfer processes in heavy-ion reactions at energies slightly\nabove the Coulomb barrier are investigated in a fully microscopic framework of\nthe time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. Transfer probabilities are\ncalculated from the TDHF wave function after collision using the projection\noperator method which has recently been proposed by Simenel (C. Simenel, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 105, 192701 (2010)). We show results of the TDHF calculations for\ntransfer cross sections of the reactions of $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{124}$Sn at\n$E_{lab}=$ 170, 174 MeV, $^{40}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb at $E_{lab}=$ 235, 249 MeV, and\n$^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb at $E_{lab}=$ 328.4 MeV, for which measurements are\navailable. We find the transfer processes show different behaviors depending on\nthe $N/Z$ ratios of the projectile and the target, and the product of the\ncharge numbers, $Z_P Z_T$. When the projectile and the target have different\n$N/Z$ ratios, fast transfer processes of a few nucleons towards the charge\nequilibrium of the initial system occur in reactions at large impact\nparameters. As the impact parameter decreases, a neck formation is responsible\nfor the transfer. A number of nucleons are transferred by the neck breaking\nwhen two nuclei dissociate, leading to transfers of protons and neutrons in the\nsame direction. Comparing cross sections by theory and measurements, we find\nthe TDHF theory describes the transfer cross sections of a few nucleons\nreasonably. As the number of transferred nucleons increases, the agreement\nbecomes less accurate. The TDHF calculation overestimates transfer cross\nsections accompanying a large number of neutrons when more than one proton are\ntransferred. Comparing our results with those by other theories, we find the\nTDHF calculations give qualitatively similar results to those of direct\nreaction models such as GRAZING and Complex WKB.\n", "  We present a comprehensive set of spectral data from two quiescent solar\nprominences observed in parallel from space and ground: with the VTT,\nsimultaneous two-dimensional imaging of H-beta 4862 and Ca II 8542 yields a\nconstant ratio, indicating small spatial pressure variations over the\nprominences. With the Gregory, simultaneous spectra of Ca II 8542 and He I\n10830 were taken, their widths yielding 8000< T_kin< 9000 K and v_nth<8 km/s.\nThe intensity ratio of the helium triplet components gives an optical thickness\nof tau < 1.0 for the fainter and tau < 2.0 for the brighter prominence. The\ntau_0 values allow to deduce the source function for the central line\nintensities and thus the relative population of the helium 3S and 3P levels\nwith a mean excitation temperature T_ex = 3750 K.\n  With SUMER, we sequentially observed 6 spectral windows containing higher\nLyman lines, 'cool' emission lines from neutrals and singly charged atoms, as\nwell as 'hot' emission lines from ions like O IV, O V, N V, S V and S VI. The\nEUV lines show pronounced maxima in the main prominence body as well as\n'side-locations' where the 'hot' lines are enhanced with respect to the 'cool'\nlines. The line radiance of 'hot' lines blue-wards of the Lyman series limit\n(lambda<912 A) appear reduced in the main prominence body. This absorption is\nalso visible in TRACE images of Fe IX/X 171 as fine dark structure which covers\nonly parts of the main ('cool') prominence body.\n  The Lyman lines show a smooth decrease of line widths and radiance with\nincreasing upper level k = 5 through 19. For k= 5 through 8 the level\npopulation follows a Boltzmann distribution with T_ex >6 *10^4 K; higher levels\nk > 8 appear more and more overpopulated. The larger widths of the Lyman lines\nrequire high non-thermal broadening close to that of 'hot' EUV lines. In\ncontrast, the He II emission is more related to the 'cool' lines.\n", "  The efficient selection of high-redshift emission galaxies is important for\nfuture large galaxy redshift surveys for cosmology. Here we describe the target\nselection methods for the FastSound project, a redshift survey for H alpha\nemitting galaxies at z=1.2-1.5 using Subaru/FMOS to measure the linear growth\nrate f\\sigma 8 via Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) and constrain the theory of\ngravity. To select ~400 target galaxies in the 0.2 deg^2 FMOS field-of-view\nfrom photometric data of CFHTLS-Wide (u*g'r'i'z'), we test several different\nmethods based on color-color diagrams or photometric redshift estimates from\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We also test the improvement in\nselection efficiency that can be achieved by adding near-infrared data from the\nUKIDSS DXS (J). The success rates of H alpha detection with FMOS averaged over\ntwo observed fields using these methods are 11.3% (color-color, optical), 13.6%\n(color-color, optical+NIR), 17.3% (photo-z, optical), and 15.1% (photo-z,\noptical+NIR). Selection from photometric redshifts tends to give a better\nefficiency than color-based methods, although there is no significant\nimprovement by adding J band data within the statistical scatter. We also\ninvestigate the main limiting factors for the success rate, by using the sample\nof the HiZELS H alpha emitters that were selected by narrow-band imaging.\nAlthough the number density of total H alpha emitters having higher H alpha\nfluxes than the FMOS sensitivity is comparable with the FMOS fiber density, the\nlimited accuracy of photometric redshift and H alpha flux estimations have\ncomparable effects on the success rate of <~20% obtained from SED fitting.\n", "  The stability of superconducting films with respect to oscillatory precursor\nmodes for thermomag- netic avalanches is investigated theoretically. The\nresults for the onset threshold show that previous treatments of\nnon-oscillatory modes have predicted much higher thresholds. Thus, in film\nsupercon- ductors, oscillatory modes are far more likely to cause\nthermomagnetic breakdown. This explains the experimental fact that flux\navalanches in film superconductors can occur even at very small ramping rates\nof the applied magnetic field. Closed expressions for the threshold magnetic\nfield and temperature, as well oscillation frequency, are derived for different\nregimes of the oscillatory thermomagnetic instability.\n", "  Large sets of objects with spectroscopic redshift measurements will be needed\nfor imaging dark energy experiments to achieve their full potential, serving\ntwo goals:_training_, i.e., the use of objects with known redshift to develop\nand optimize photometric redshift algorithms; and_calibration_, i.e., the\ncharacterization of moments of redshift (or photo-z error) distributions.\nBetter training makes cosmological constraints from a given experiment\nstronger, while highly-accurate calibration is needed for photo-z systematics\nnot to dominate errors. In this white paper, we investigate the required scope\nof spectroscopic datasets which can serve both these purposes for ongoing and\nnext-generation dark energy experiments, as well as the time required to obtain\nsuch data with instruments available in the next decade. Large time allocations\non kilo-object spectrographs will be necessary, ideally augmented by infrared\nspectroscopy from space. Alternatively, precision calibrations could be\nobtained by measuring cross-correlation statistics using samples of bright\nobjects from a large baryon acoustic oscillation experiment such as DESI. We\nalso summarize the additional work on photometric redshift methods needed to\nprepare for ongoing and future dark energy experiments.\n", "  We develop a general framework to construct quantum algorithms that detect if\na $3$-uniform hypergraph given as input contains a sub-hypergraph isomorphic to\na prespecified constant-sized hypergraph. This framework is based on the\nconcept of nested quantum walks recently proposed by Jeffery, Kothari and\nMagniez [SODA'13], and extends the methodology designed by Lee, Magniez and\nSantha [SODA'13] for similar problems over graphs. As applications, we obtain a\nquantum algorithm for finding a $4$-clique in a $3$-uniform hypergraph on $n$\nvertices with query complexity $O(n^{1.883})$, and a quantum algorithm for\ndetermining if a ternary operator over a set of size $n$ is associative with\nquery complexity $O(n^{2.113})$.\n", "  Blazars represent the most abundant class of high-energy extragalactic\n$\\gamma$-ray sources. The subset of blazars known as BL Lac objects is on\naverage closer to Earth and characterized by harder spectra at high energy than\nthe whole sample. The fraction of BL Lacs that is too dim to be detected and\nresolved by current $\\gamma$-ray telescopes is therefore expected to contribute\nto the high-energy isotropic diffuse $\\gamma$-ray background (IGRB). The IGRB\nhas been recently measured over a wide energy range by the Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) on board the Gamma-ray Space Telescope ({\\it Fermi}). We present a new\nprediction of the diffuse $\\gamma$-ray flux due to the unresolved BL Lac blazar\npopulation. The model is built upon the spectral energy distribution and the\nluminosity function derived from the fraction of BL Lacs detected (and\nspectrally characterized) in the $\\gamma$-ray energy range. We focus our\nattention on the ${\\cal O}(100)$ GeV energy range, predicting the emission up\nto the TeV scale and taking into account the absorption on the extragalactic\nbackground light. In order to better shape the BL Lac spectral energy\ndistribution, we combine the {\\it Fermi}-LAT data with Imaging Atmospheric\nCerenkov Telescopes measurements of the most energetic sources. Our analysis is\ncarried on separately for low- and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on\none hand, and high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on the other one: we find in fact\nstatistically different features for the two. The diffuse emission from the sum\nof both BL Lac classes increases from about 10$\\%$ of the measured IGRB at 100\nMeV to $\\sim$100$\\%$ of the data level at 100 GeV. At energies greater than 100\nGeV, our predictions naturally explain the IGRB data, accommodating their\nsoftening with increasing energy. Uncertainties are estimated to be within of a\nfactor of two of the best-fit flux up to 500 GeV.\n", "  We investigated a suspended bilayer graphene where the bottom (top) layer is\ndoped by boron (nitrogen) substitutional atoms by using Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) calculations. We found that at high dopant concentration (one B-N\npair every 32 C atoms) the electronic structure of the bilayer does not depend\non the B-N distance but on the relative occupation of the bilayer graphene\nsub-lattices by B and N. We found that a large built in electric field is\nestablished between layers, giving rise to an energy gap. We further\ninvestigated the transport properties and found that intra-layer electron\ncurrent is weakly influenced by the presence of these dopants while the\ninter-layer current is significantly enhanced for biases allowing the energy\nalignment of N and B states. This effect leads to current rectification in\nasymmetric junctions.\n", "  We consider the interior transmission eigenvalue (ITE) problem, which arises\nwhen scattering by inhomogeneous media is studied. The ITE problem is not\nself-adjoint. We show that positive ITEs are observable together with plus or\nminus signs that are defined by the direction of motion of the corresponding\neigenvalues of the scattering matrix (when the latter approach {\\bf$z=1$)}. We\nobtain a Weyl type formula for the counting function of positive ITEs, which\nare taken together with ascribed signs.\n", "  We investigate interacting ghost dark energy models in higher dimensional\ncosmology. We attempt to model dark matter within a barotropic fluid with\n$P_{b}=\\omega(t)_{b}\\rho$. In this work we consider four different models based\non choosing equation of state parameter and interaction term. We confirm that\nour models agree with observational data.\n", "  We define quantum lens spaces as `direct sums of line bundles' and exhibit\nthem as `total spaces' of certain principal bundles over quantum projective\nspaces. For each of these quantum lens spaces we construct an analogue of the\nclassical Gysin sequence in K-theory. We use the sequence to compute the\nK-theory of the quantum lens spaces, in particular to give explicit geometric\nrepresentatives of their K-theory classes. These representatives are\ninterpreted as `line bundles' over quantum lens spaces and generically define\n`torsion classes'. We work out explicit examples of these classes.\n", "  Here, we provide an overview of theoretical approaches to semiflexible\npolymers and their networks. Such semiflexible polymers have large bending\nrigidities that can compete with the entropic tendency of a chain to crumple up\ninto a random coil. Many studies on semiflexible polymers and their assemblies\nhave been motivated by their importance in biology. Indeed, crosslinked\nnetworks of semiflexible polymers form a major structural component of tissue\nand living cells. Reconstituted networks of such biopolymers have emerged as a\nnew class of biological soft matter systems with remarkable material\nproperties, which have spurred many of the theoretical developments discussed\nhere. Starting from the mechanics and dynamics of individual semiflexible\npolymers, we review the physics of semiflexible bundles, entangled solutions\nand disordered cross-linked networks. Finally, we discuss recent developments\non marginally stable fibrous networks, which exhibit critical behavior similar\nto other marginal systems such as jammed soft matter.\n", "  It is a salient experimental fact that a large fraction of candidate spin\nliquid materials freeze as the temperature is lowered. The question naturally\narises whether such freezing is intrinsic to the spin liquid (\"disorder-free\nglassiness\") or extrinsic, in the sense that a topological phase simply\ncoexists with standard freezing of impurities. Here, we demonstrate a\nsurprising third alternative, namely that freezing and topological liquidity\nare inseparably linked. The topological phase reacts to the introduction of\ndisorder by generating degrees of freedom of a new type (along with\ninteractions between them), which in turn undergo a freezing transition while\nthe topological phase supporting them remains intact.\n", "  Precise fiber positioning is crucial to a wide field, multi-fiber\nspectroscopic survey like LAMOST. Nowadays, most position error measurements\nare based on CCD photographic and imaging processing techniques. Those methods\nonly work for measuring errors orthogonal to the telescope optical axis, while\nthere also lies errors parallel to the telescope optical axis, like defocusing,\nand error caused by the existing deviation angle between optical axes of a\nfiber and the telescope. Directly measuring two latter types of position errors\nis difficult for individual fiber, especially during observation. Possible\nsources of fiber position errors are discussed in brief for LAMOST. By\nconstructing a model of magnitude loss due to the fiber position error for a\npoint source, we propose an indirect method to calculate the total and\nsystematic position errors for each individual fiber from spectra data.\nRestrictions and applications of this method are also discussed.\n", "  Superhalo electrons appear to be continuously present in the interplanetary\nmedium, even at very quiet times, with a power-law spectrum at energies above\n$\\sim$2 keV. Here we numerically investigate the generation of superhalo\nelectrons by magnetic reconnection in the solar wind source region, using the\nMHD and test particle simulations for both single X-line reconnection and\nmultiple X-line reconnection. We find that the direct current electric field,\nproduced in the magnetic reconnection region, can accelerate electrons from an\ninitial thermal energy of T $\\sim10^5$ K up to hundreds of keV. After\nacceleration, some of the accelerated electrons, together with the nascent\nsolar wind flow driven by the reconnection, propagate upwards along the\nnewly-opened magnetic field lines into the interplanetary space, while the rest\nmove downwards into the lower atmosphere. Similar to the observed superhalo\nelectrons at 1 AU, the flux of the upward-traveling accelerated electrons\nversus energy displays a power-law distribution at $\\sim$ 2 $-$ 100 keV, $f(E)\n\\sim E^{-\\delta}$, with a $\\delta$ of $\\sim$ 1.5 $-$ 2.4. For single (multiple)\nX-line reconnection, the spectrum becomes harder (softer) as the anomalous\nresistivity parameter $\\alpha$ (uniform resistivity $\\eta$) increases. These\nmodeling results suggest that the acceleration in the solar wind source region\nmay contribute to superhalo electrons.\n", "  The wave-particle duality dates back to Einstein's explanation of the\nphotoelectric effect through quanta of light and de Broglie's hypothesis of\nmatter waves. Quantum mechanics uses an abstract description for the behavior\nof physical systems such as photons, electrons, or atoms. Whether quantum\npredictions for single systems in an interferometric experiment allow an\nintuitive understanding in terms of the particle or wave picture, depends on\nthe specific configuration which is being used. In principle, this leaves open\nthe possibility that quantum systems always either behave definitely as a\nparticle or definitely as a wave in every experimental run by a priori adapting\nto the specific experimental situation. This is precisely what is tried to be\nexcluded by delayed-choice experiments, in which the observer chooses to reveal\nthe particle or wave character -- or even a continuous transformation between\nthe two -- of a quantum system at a late stage of the experiment. We review the\nhistory of delayed-choice gedanken experiments, which can be traced back to the\nearly days of quantum mechanics. Then we discuss their experimental\nrealizations, in particular Wheeler's delayed choice in interferometric setups\nas well as delayed-choice quantum erasure and entanglement swapping. The latter\nis particularly interesting, because it elevates the wave-particle duality of a\nsingle quantum system to an entanglement-separability duality of multiple\nsystems.\n", "  We show that, for SU(2) generators of arbitrary dimension $D$, there exist\nidentities that express the completely symmetric product of $D$ matrices in\nterms of completely symmetric products of fewer number of matrices. We also\nindicate why such identities are important in characterizing electromagnetic\ninteractions of particles.\n", "  We propose an extension to classify jet modification in heavy-ion collisions\nby including the jet mass along with its energy. The mass of a jet, as measured\nby jet reconstruction algorithms, is constrained by the jet's virtuality, which\nin turn has a considerable effect on such observables as the fragmentation\nfunction and jet shape observables. The leading parton, propagating through a\ndense medium, experiences substantial virtuality (or mass) depletion along with\nenergy loss. Meaningful comparisons between surviving jets and jets produced in\n$p$-$p$ collisions require mass depletion to be taken into account. Using a\nvacuum event generator, we show the close relationship between the actual jet\nmass and that after applying a jet reconstruction algorithm. Using an in-medium\nevent generator, we demonstrate the clear difference between the mass of a\nsurviving parton exiting a dense medium and a parton with a similar energy\nformed in a hard scattering event. Effects of this difference on jet\nobservables are discussed.\n", "  Being able to image the human retina in high resolution opens a new era in\nmany important fields, such as pharmacological research for retinal diseases,\nresearches in human cognition, nervous system, metabolism and blood stream, to\nname a few. In this paper, we propose to share the knowledge acquired in the\nfields of optics and imaging in solar astrophysics in order to improve the\nretinal imaging at very high spatial resolution in the perspective to perform a\nmedical diagnosis. The main purpose would be to assist health care\npractitioners by enhancing retinal images and detect abnormal features. We\napply a nonlinear registration method using local correlation tracking to\nincrease the field of view and follow structure evolutions using correlation\ntechniques borrowed from solar astronomy technique expertise. Another purpose\nis to define the tracer of movements after analyzing local correlations to\nfollow the proper motions of an image from one moment to another, such as\nchanges in optical flows that would be of high interest in a medical diagnosis.\n", "  In classical systems, we reexamine how macroscopic structures in equilibrium\nstate connect with spatial con- straint on the systems: e.g., volume and\ndensity as the constraint for liquids in rigid box, and crystal lattice as the\nconstraint for crystalline solids. We reveal that in disordered states,\nequilibrium macroscopic structure, depend- ing on temperature and on multibody\ninteractions in the system, is characterized by a single special microscopic\nstructure independent of temperature and of interactions. The special\nmicroscopic structure depends only on the spatial constraint. We demonstrate\nthe present findings providing (i) significantly efficient and systematic\nprediction of macroscopic structures for possible combination of constituents\nin multicomponent systems, and (ii) unique and accurate determination of\nmultibody interactions in given system from measured macroscopic structure,\nwithout performing trial-and-error simulation.\n", "  The unique ability of a red blood cell to flow through extremely small\nmicrocapillaries depends on the viscoelastic properties of its membrane. Here,\nwe study in vitro the response time upon flow startup exhibited by red blood\ncells confined into microchannels. We show that the characteristic transient\ntime depends on the imposed flow strength, and that such a dependence gives\naccess to both the effective viscosity and the elastic modulus controlling the\ntemporal response of red cells. A simple theoretical analysis of our\nexperimental data, validated by numerical simulations, further allows us to\ncompute an estimate for the two-dimensional membrane viscosity of red blood\ncells, $\\eta_{mem}^{2D}\\sim 10^{-7}$ N$\\cdot$s$\\cdot$m$^{-1}$. By comparing our\nresults with those from previous studies, we discuss and clarify the origin of\nthe discrepancies found in the literature regarding the determination of\n$\\eta_{mem}^{2D}$, and reconcile seemingly conflicting conclusions from\nprevious works.\n", "  A self Morita equivalence over an algebra B, given by a B-bimodule E, is\nthought of as a line bundle over B. The corresponding Pimsner algebra O_E is\nthen the total space algebra of a noncommutative principal circle bundle over\nB. A natural Gysin-like sequence relates the KK-theories of O_E and of B.\nInteresting examples come from O_E a quantum lens space over B a quantum\nweighted projective line (with arbitrary weights). The KK-theory of these\nspaces is explicitly computed and natural generators are exhibited.\n", "  We engineer topological insulating phases in a fermion-fermion mixture on the\nhoneycomb lattice, without resorting to artificial gauge fields or spin-orbit\ncouplings and considering only local interactions. Essentially, upon\nintegrating out the fast component (characterized by a larger hopping\namplitude) in a finite region of dopings, we obtain an effective interaction\nbetween the slow fermions at half-filling, which acquires a Haldane mass with\nopposite parity in the two valleys of the Dirac cones, thus triggering a\nquantum anomalous Hall effect. We carefully analyze the competition between the\ninduced Semenoff-type mass (producing charge density wave orders in real space)\nversus the Haldane mass (quantum anomalous Hall phase), as a function of the\nchemical potential of the fast fermions. If the second species involves\nspin-1/2 particles, this interaction may induce a quantum spin Hall phase. Such\nfermion-fermion mixtures can be realized in optical lattices or in graphene\nheterostructures.\n", "  We study products of precursors of spatially local operators,\n$W_{x_{n}}(t_{n}) ... W_{x_1}(t_1)$, where $W_x(t) = e^{-iHt} W_x e^{iHt}$.\nUsing chaotic spin-chain numerics and gauge/gravity duality, we show that a\nsingle precursor fills a spatial region that grows linearly in $t$. In a\nlattice system, products of such operators can be represented using tensor\nnetworks. In gauge/gravity duality, they are related to Einstein-Rosen bridges\nsupported by localized shock waves. We find a geometrical correspondence\nbetween these two descriptions, generalizing earlier work in the spatially\nhomogeneous case.\n", "  Seven types of armchair graphyne nanoribbons are investigated with HSE06\nfunctional. The quantum confinements in the graphyne nanoribbons open or\nincrease the band gaps of the corresponding two-dimensional graphynes, which is\ncrucial to high on/off ratio in electronic device operation. The major carrier\nmobilities of the graphyne nanoribbons with high percentage of sp hybridized\ncarbon atoms are very large. The sparse linking pattern results in small number\nof frontier crystal orbitals and small deformation potential constants, which\nare responsible for the large carrier mobilities. Some graphyne nanoribbons\nhave band gaps larger than 0.4 eV. Meanwhile, they have both high hole and\nelectron mobilities. These benefit current complementary circuit with low power\ndissipation. Especially, the hole and electron mobilities of 14,14,18-graphyne\nnanoribbons are more than an order larger than those of the armchair graphene\nnanoribbons, indicating that they have potential applications in high speed\nelectronic devices.\n", "  Pulsar-like compact stars usually have strong magnetic fields, with the\nstrength from $\\sim 10^8$ to $\\sim 10^{12}$ Gauss on surface. How such strong\nmagnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,\nwhich is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,\ni.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the\nelectrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become\nferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the\nwhole star. We conclude that, for most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the\namount of net magnetic momentum, which is proportional to the amount of\nunbalanced spins $\\xi=(n_+-n_-)/n_e$ and depends on the number density of\nelectrons $n_e=n_++n_-$, could be significant with non-zero $\\xi$. The net\nmagnetic moments of electron system in solid quark-cluster stars could be large\nenough to induce the observed magnetic fields for pulsars with $B\\sim 10^{11}$\nto $\\sim 10^{13}$ Gauss.\n", "  We studied the trance distance, the Hellinger distance, and the Bures\ndistance geometric quantum discords (GQDs) for a two-spin Heisenberg {\\it XX}\nchain with the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction and the external magnetic\nfields. We found that considerable enhancement of the GQDs can be achieved by\nintroducing the DM interaction, and their maxima were obtained in the limiting\ncase $D\\rightarrow \\infty$. The external magnetic fields and the increase of\nthe temperature can also enhance the GQDs to some extent for certain special\ncases.\n", "  The El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) behavior can be effectively modeled\nas a response to a 2nd-order Mathieu/Hill differential equation with periodic\ncoefficients describing sloshing of a volume of water. The forcing of the\nequation derives from QBO, angular momentum changes synchronized with the\nChandler wobble, and solar insolation variations. One regime change was\nidentified in 1980.\n", "  In this work, following recent studies which show that it is possible to\nlocalize gravity as well as scalar and gauge vector fields in a tachyonic de\nSitter thick braneworld, we investigate the localization of fermion fields in\nthis model. In order to achieve this aim we consider the Yukawa interaction\nterm between the fermions and the tachyonic condensate scalar field\nMF(T)barPsiPsi in the action and analyze four different cases corresponding to\ndistinct tachyonic functions F(T(w)). The only condition that this function\nmust satisfy in order to yield 4D chiral fermions upon dimensional reduction is\nto be odd in the extra dimension w. These functions lead to a different\nstructure of the respective fermionic mass spectrum. In particular,\nlocalization of the massless left-chiral fermion zero mode is possible for\nthree of these cases. We further analyze the phenomenology of the Yukawa\ninteraction among fermion fields and gauge bosons localized on the brane and\nobtain the crucial and necessary information to compute the corrections to\nCoulomb's law coming from massive KK vector modes in the non-relativistic\nlimit. These corrections are exponentially suppressed due to the presence of\nthe mass gap in the mass spectrum of the bulk gauge vector field. From our\nresults we conclude that corrections to Coulomb's law in the thin brane limit\nhave the same form (up to a numerical factor) as far as the left-chiral\nmassless fermion field is localized on the brane. Finally we compute the\ncorrections to the Coulomb's law for a more general case, on a thick brane\nscenario, for which we can do estimates consistent with brane phenomenology,\ni.e. we found that the predicted corrections to the Coulomb law in our model,\nwhich are well bounded by the observed experimental photon mass, is far beyond\nits upper bound, positively testing the viability of our tachyonic braneworld.\n", "  Vibrational energies and wave functions of the triplet state of the H3+ ion\nhave been determined. In the calculations, the ground and first excited triplet\nelectronic states are included as well as the non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling\nbetween them. A diabatization procedure transforming the two adiabatic ab\ninitio potential energy surfaces of the triplet-H3+ state into a 2x2 matrix is\nemployed. The diabatization takes into account the non-Born-Oppenheimer\ncoupling and the effect of the geometrical phase due to the conical\nintersection between the two adiabatic potential surfaces. The results are\ncompared to the calculation involving only the lowest adiabatic potential\nenergy surface of the triplet-H3+ ion and neglecting the geometrical phase. The\nenergy difference between results with and without the non-adiabatic coupling\nand the geometrical phase is about a wave number for the lowest vibrational\nlevels.\n", "  In vertebrates, insufficient availability of calcium and phosphate ions in\nextracellular fluids leads to loss of bone density and neuronal\nhyper-excitability. To counteract this problem, calcium ions are present at\nhigh concentrations throughout body fluids -- at concentrations exceeding the\nsaturation point. This condition leads to the opposite situation where unwanted\nmineral sedimentation may occur. Remarkably, ectopic or out-of-place\nsedimentation into soft tissues is rare, in spite of the thermodynamic driving\nfactors. This fortunate fact is due to the presence of auto-regulatory proteins\nthat are found in abundance in bodily fluids. Yet, many important inflammatory\ndisorders such as atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis are associated with this\nundesired calcification. Hence, it is important to gain an understanding of the\nregulatory process and the conditions under which it can go awry. In this\nmanuscript, we adapt mean-field classical nucleation theory to the case of\nsurface-shielding in order to study the regulation of sedimentation of calcium\nphosphate salts in biological tissues through the mechanism of post-nuclear\nshielding of nascent mineral particles by binding proteins. We develop a\nmathematical description of this phenomenon using a countable system of\nhyperbolic partial differential equations. A critical concentration of\nregulatory protein is identified as a function of the physical parameters that\ndescribe the system.\n", "  We develop a theory of Lagrangian reduction on loop groups for completely\nintegrable systems after having exchanged the role of the space and time\nvariables in the multi-time interpretation of integrable hierarchies. We then\ninsert the Sobolev norm $H^1$ in the Lagrangian and derive a deformation of the\ncorresponding hierarchies. The integrability of the deformed equations is\naltered and a notion of weak integrability is introduced. We implement this\nscheme in the AKNS and SO(3) hierarchies and obtain known and new equations.\nAmong them we found two important equations, the Camassa-Holm equation, viewed\nas a deformation of the KdV equation, and a deformation of the NLS equation.\n", "  Increased adoption and deployment of phasor measurement units (PMU) has\nprovided valuable fine-grained data over the grid. Analysis over these data can\nprovide insight into the health of the grid, thereby improving control over\noperations. Realizing this data-driven control, however, requires validating,\nprocessing and storing massive amounts of PMU data. This paper describes a PMU\ndata management system that supports input from multiple PMU data streams,\nfeatures an event-detection algorithm, and provides an efficient method for\nretrieving archival data. The event-detection algorithm rapidly correlates\nmultiple PMU data streams, providing details on events occurring within the\npower system. The event-detection algorithm feeds into a visualization\ncomponent, allowing operators to recognize events as they occur. The indexing\nand data retrieval mechanism facilitates fast access to archived PMU data.\nUsing this method, we achieved over 30x speedup for queries with high\nselectivity. With the development of these two components, we have developed a\nsystem that allows efficient analysis of multiple time-aligned PMU data\nstreams.\n", "  Symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) is a key quantity to obtain quantum\nFisher information (QFI) and to construct the corresponding optimal\nmeasurements. Here we develop a method to calculate the SLD and QFI via\nanti-commutators. This method is originated from the Lyapunov representation\nand would be very useful for cases that the anti-commutators among the state\nand its partial derivative exhibits periodic properties. As an application, we\ndiscuss a class of states, whose squares linearly depend on the states\nthemselves, and give the corresponding analytical expressions of SLD and QFI. A\nnoisy scenario of this class of states is also considered and discussed.\nFinally, we readily apply the method to the block-diagonal states and the\nmulti-parameter estimation problems.\n", "  The equilibrium structures and electronic excitation spectra of the Ir(III)\nphotosensitizer Ir(ppy)$_2$(bpy)]$^+$ bound to medium-sized silver clusters\nAg$_n$ ($n=$19, 20) are investigated using time-dependent density functional\ntheory. The long-range corrected LC-BLYP approach is used with a\nsystem-specific range separation parameter. The weak physisorption of the\nhybrid complexes yield only small changes in the broadened absorption spectra\nof the hybrid system as compared with its constituents. However, the density of\nstates as well as the fine structure of the spectra is strongly modified upon\ncomplexation. It is shown that the standard range separation parameter (0.47\nbohr$^{-1}$) cannot predict these properties correctly and the optimized value\nof 0.16 bohr$^{-1}$ should be used instead.\n", "  We define the (total) center of mass for suitably asymptotically hyperbolic\ntime-slices of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in general relativity.\nWe do so in analogy to the picture that has been consolidated for the (total)\ncenter of mass of suitably asymptotically Euclidean time-slices of\nasymptotically Minkowskian spacetimes (isolated systems). In particular, we\nunite -- an altered version of -- the approach based on Hamiltonian charges\nwith an approach based on CMC-foliations near infinity. The newly defined\ncenter of mass transforms appropriately under changes of the asymptotic\ncoordinates and evolves in the direction of an appropriately defined linear\nmomentum under the Einstein evolution equations.\n", "  A simple, single-color method for permanent marking of the position of\nindividual self-assembled semiconductor Quantum Dots (QDs) at cryogenic\ntemperatures is reported. The method combines in situ photolithography with\nstandard micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. Its utility is proven by a\nsystematic magnetooptical study of a single CdTe/ZnTe QD containing a Mn2+ ion,\nwhere a magnetic field of up to 10 T in two orthogonal, Faraday and Voigt,\nconfigurations is applied to the same QD. The presented approach can be applied\nto a wide range of solid state nanoemitters.\n", "  Graphene hybrid planar structures consisting of two regions with different\nquantum Hall (QH) states exhibit unusual transport properties1-5, originating\nfrom chiral edge states equilibration at the interface of the two different\nregions6. Here we present a sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) study of a monolayer-bilayer graphene\nplanar junction in the QH regime. The atomically well-defined interface of such\na junction allows us to spatially resolve the interface electronic properties.\nAround the interface, we detect Landau quantization of massless Dirac fermions,\nas expected in graphene monolayer, below the charge neutrality point Nc of the\njunction, whereas unexpectedly, only Landau quantization of massive Dirac\nfermions, as expected in graphene bilayer, is observed above the Nc. The\nobserved unconventional interface Landau quantization arises from the fact that\nthe quantum conductance across the interface is solely determined by the\nminimum filling factors (number of edge modes) in the graphene monolayer and\nbilayer regions of the junction6,7.\n", "  We focus on solitary waves generated in arrays of lightly contacting\nspherical elastic granules by shock forces of steep rise and slow decay\ndurations, and establish a priori: (i) whether the peak value of the resulting\nsolitary wave would be greater, equal, or less than the peak value of the input\nshock force; (ii) the magnitude of the peak value of the solitary waves; (iii)\nthe magnitude of the linear momentum in each solitary wave; (iv) the magnitude\nof the linear momentum added to the remaining granules, if the first granule is\nejected; and (v) a quantitative estimate of the effect of the granules' radius,\ndensity and stiffness on force amplification/mitigation. We have supported the\nanalytical results by direct numerical simulations.\n", "  Networks of coupled degrade-and-fire (DF) oscillators are simple dynamical\nmodels of assemblies of interacting self-repressing genes. For mean-field\ninteractions, which most mathematical studies have assumed so far, every\ntrajectory must approach a periodic orbit. Moreover, asymptotic cluster\ndistributions can be computed explicitly in terms of coupling intensity, and a\nmassive collection of distributions collapses when this intensity passes a\nthreshold. Here, we show that most of these dynamical features persist for an\narbitrary coupling topology. In particular, we prove that, in any system of DF\noscillators for which in and out coupling weights balance, trajectories with\nreasonable firing sequences must be asymptotically periodic, and periodic\norbits are uniquely determined by their firing sequence. In addition to these\nstructural results, illustrative examples are presented, for which the dynamics\ncan be entirely described.\n", "  A key actor in the conventional theory of superconductivity is the induced\ninteraction between electrons mediated by the exchange of virtual collective\nfluctuations, originally phonons. Other collective modes that can play the same\nrole, especially spin-fluctuations, have been widely discussed in the context\nof high-temperature and heavy Fermion superconductors. The strength of such\ncollective fluctuations is measured by the associated susceptibility. Here we\nuse differential elastoresistance measurements on five optimally doped Fe-based\nsuperconductors to reveal that a diverging \\emph{nematic} susceptibility\nappears to be a generic feature in the optimal doping regime of these\nmaterials. The observation motivates consideration of the effects of nematic\nfluctuations on the superconducting pairing interaction in this family of\ncompounds, and possibly beyond.\n", "  Long term observations by Brook et al. reveal that the derivative of\nrotational frequency of PSR J0738-4042 changed abruptly in 2005. Originally,\nthe spin-down rate was relatively stable, with the rotational frequency\nderivative of $-1.14 \\times 10^{-14}~\\rm s^{-2}$. After September 2005, the\nderivative began to rise up. About 1000 days later, it arrived at another\nrelatively stable value of about $-0.98 \\times 10^{-14}~\\rm s^{-2}$, indicating\nthat the pulsar is spinning-down relatively slowly. To explain the observed\nspin-down rate change, we resort to an asteroid disrupted by PSR J0738-4042. In\nour model, the orbital angular momentum of the asteroid is assumed to be\nparallel to that of the rotating pulsar, so that the pronounced reduction in\nthe spin-down rate can be naturally explained as due to the transfer of the\nangular momentum from the disrupted material to the central pulsar. The derived\nmagnetospheric radius is about $4.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cm, which is smaller than\nthe tidal disruption radius ($4.9 \\times 10^{10}$ cm). Our model is\nself-consistent. It is shown that the variability of the spin-down rate of PSR\nJ0738-4042 can be quantitatively accounted for by the accretion from the\nasteroid disrupted by the central pulsar.\n", "  We present a systematic approach based on Bloch vector's treatment and the\nMagnus quantum electrodynamical formalism to study qubit manipulation by a\ntrain of pulses. These investigations include one of the basic processes\ninvolved in quantum computation. The concrete calculations are performed for\ntunneling quantum dynamics, multiple resonance and off-resonance excitations of\nqubit driven by Gaussian pulses. In this way, the populations of qubit states\ndue to multiple resonant interactions are investigated for various operational\nregimes including: single-pulse excitation, two-pulse excitation with phase\nshift between pulse envelopes being controlling parameter and for excitation\nwith sequential pulses. In the last case, we demonstrate the formation of\nquasienergetic states and quasienergies of qubit driven by train of identical\npulses. In this case the transition probability of qubit exhibits aperiodic\noscillations, but also becomes periodically regular for definite values of the\nquasienergy.\n", "  We study the properties of gas in and around 10^12 solar mass halos at z=2\nusing a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic 'zoom' simulations.\nWe quantify the thermal and dynamical structure of these gaseous reservoirs in\nterms of their mean radial distributions and angular variability along\ndifferent sightlines. With each halo simulated at three levels of increasing\nresolution, the highest reaching a baryon mass resolution of ~10,000 solar\nmasses, we study the interaction of filamentary inflow and the quasi-static hot\nhalo atmosphere. We highlight the discrepancy between the spatial resolution\navailable in the halo gas as opposed to within the galaxy itself, and find that\nstream morphologies become increasingly complex at higher resolution, with\nlarge coherent flows revealing density and temperature structure at\nprogressively smaller scales. Moreover, multiple gas components co-exist at the\nsame radius within the halo, making radially averaged analyses misleading. This\nis particularly true where the hot, quasi-static, high entropy halo atmosphere\ninteracts with cold, rapidly inflowing, low entropy accretion. We investigate\nthe process of gas virialization and identify different regimes for the heating\nof gas as it accretes from the intergalactic medium. Haloes at this mass have a\nwell-defined virial shock, associated with a sharp jump in temperature and\nentropy at ~1.25 r_vir. The presence, radius, and radial width of this boundary\nfeature, however, vary not only from halo to halo, but also as a function of\nangular direction, covering roughly ~85% of the 4pi sphere. Our findings are\nrelevant for the proper interpretation of observations pertaining to the\ncircumgalactic medium, including evidence for large amounts of cold gas\nsurrounding massive haloes at intermediate redshifts.\n", "  So far, Brillouin scattering and cavity optomechanics were mostly\ndisconnected branches of research -- although both deal with photon-phonon\ncoupling. This begs for the development of a broader theory that contains both\nfields. Here, we derive the dynamics of optomechanical cavities from that of\nBrillouin-active waveguides. This explicit transition elucidates the link\nbetween phenomena such as Brillouin amplification and electromagnetically\ninduced transparency. It proves that effects familiar from cavity optomechanics\nall have traveling-wave partners, but not vice versa. We reveal a close\nconnection between two parameters of central importance in these fields: the\nBrillouin gain coefficient and the zero-point optomechanical coupling rate.\nThis enables comparisons between systems as diverse as ultracold atom clouds,\nplasmonic Raman cavities and nanoscale silicon waveguides. In addition,\nback-of-the-envelope calculations show that unobserved effects, such as\nphoton-assisted amplification of traveling phonons, are now accessible in\nexisting systems. Finally, we formulate both circuit- and cavity-oriented\noptomechanics in terms of vacuum coupling rates, cooperativities and gain\ncoefficients, thus reflecting the similarities in the underlying physics.\n", "  In this paper, we consider quadratic Maxwell invariant as a correction to the\nMaxwell theory and study thermodynamic behavior of the black holes in Einstein\nand Gauss-Bonnet gravities. We consider cosmological constant as a\nthermodynamic pressure to extend phase space. Next, we obtain critical values\nin case of variation of nonlinearity and Gauss-Bonnet parameters. Although the\ngeneral thermodynamical behavior of the black hole solutions is the same as\nusual Van der Waals system, we show that in special case of the nonlinear\nelectromagnetic field, there will be a turning point for the phase diagrams and\nusual Van der Waals is not observed. This theory of nonlinear electromagnetic\nfield provides two critical horizon radii. We show that this unusual behavior\nof phase diagrams is due to existence of second critical horizon radius. It\nwill be pointed out that the power of the gravity and nonlinearity of the\nmatter field modify the critical values. We generalize the study by considering\nthe effects of dimensionality on critical values and make comparisons between\nour models with their special sub classes. In addition, we examine the\npossibility of the existence of the reentrant phase transitions through two\ndifferent methods.\n", "  Magnetars are surrounded by diffuse plasma in magnetic field strengths well\nabove the quantum electrodynamic critical value. We derive equations of\n\"quantum force-free electrodynamics\" for this plasma using effective field\ntheory arguments. We argue that quantum effects do not modify the large scale\nstructure of the magnetosphere, and in particular that the spin-down rate does\nnot deviate significantly from the classical result. We provide definite\nevolution equations that can be used to explore potentially important\nsmall-scale corrections, such as shock formation, which has been proposed as a\nmechanism for both burst and quiescent emission from magnetars.\n", "  In this paper we introduce Schwartz operators as a non-commutative analog of\nSchwartz functions and provide a detailed discussion of their properties. We\nequip them in particular with a number of different (but equivalent) families\nof seminorms which turns the space of Schwartz operators into a Frechet space.\nThe study of the topological dual leads to non-commutative tempered\ndistributions which are discussed in detail as well. We show in particular that\nthe latter can be identified with a certain class of quadratic forms, therefore\nmaking operations like products with bounded (and also some unbounded)\noperators and quantum harmonic analysis available to objects which are\notherwise too singular for being a Hilbert space operator. Finally we show how\nthe new methods can be applied by studying operator moment problems and\nconvergence properties of fluctuation operators.\n", "  We study the significance and characteristics of interfacial dynamical charge\ntransfer at metal-organic interfaces for the organic semiconductor model system\n1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) on Ag(111)\nquantitatively. We combine infrared absorption spectroscopy and\ndispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations to analyze dynamic\ndipole moments and electron-vibron coupling at the interface. We demonstrate\nthat interfacial dynamical charge transfer is the dominant cause of infrared\nactivity in these systems and that it correlates with results from partial\ncharge and density of states analysis. Nuclear motion generates an additional\ndynamic dipole moment but represents a minor effect except for modes with\nsignificant out-of-plane amplitudes.\n", "  We use the F-theory realization of 6D superconformal field theories (SCFTs)\nto study the corresponding spectrum of stringlike, i.e. surface defects. On the\ntensor branch, all of the stringlike excitations pick up a finite tension, and\nthere is a corresponding lattice of string charges, as well as a dual lattice\nof charges for the surface defects. The defect group is data intrinsic to the\nSCFT and measures the surface defect charges which are not screened by\ndynamical strings. When non-trivial, it indicates that the associated theory\nhas a partition vector rather than a partition function. We compute the defect\ngroup for all known 6D SCFTs, and find that it is just the abelianization of\nthe discrete subgroup of U(2) which appears in the classification of 6D SCFTs\nrealized in F-theory. We also explain how the defect group specifies defining\ndata in the compactification of a (1,0) SCFT.\n", "  We study the natural excitation of molecular systems, applicable to, for\nexample, photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, by natural incoherent\nlight. In contrast with the conventional classical models, we show that the\nlight need not have random character to properly represent the resultant linear\nexcitation. Rather, thermal excitation can be interpreted as a collection of\nindividual events resulting from the system's interaction with individual,\ndeterministic pulsed realizations that constitute the field. The derived\nexpressions for the individual field realizations and excitation events allow\nfor a wave function formalism, and therefore constitute a useful calculational\ntool to study dynamics following thermal-light excitation. Further, they\nprovide a route to the experimental determination of natural incoherent\nexcitation using pulsed laser techniques.\n", "  We argue that one has to distinguish between the Harari-Shupe model (HSM) and\nthe Harari-Shupe observation (HSO). The former - in which quarks and leptons\nare viewed as composite objects built from confined fermionic subparticles\n(`rishons') - is known to be beset with many difficulties. The latter may be\nroughly defined as this part of the HSM that really works. We recall that the\nphase-space Clifford-algebra approach leads to the HSO without any of the HSM\nproblems and discuss in some detail how this is achieved. The light which the\nphase-space-based view sheds on the HSO sets then a new direction along which\nthe connection between space and particle properties could be studied and\noffers a glimpse into weird physics that probably lurks much deeper than the\nfield-theoretical approach of the Standard Model.\n", "  Spectral retrieval has proven to be a powerful tool for constraining the\nphysical properties and atmospheric compositions of extrasolar planet\natmospheres from observed spectra, primarily for transiting objects but also\nfor directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs. Despite its strengths, this\napproach has been applied to only about a dozen targets. Determining the\nabundances of the main carbon and oxygen-bearing compounds in a planetary\natmosphere can lead to the C/O ratio of the object, which is crucial in\nunderstanding its formation and migration history. We present a retrieval\nanalysis on the published near-infrared spectrum of {\\kappa} And b, a directly\nimaged substellar companion to a young B9 star. We fit the emission spectrum\nmodel utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We estimate the abundance\nof water vapor, and its uncertainty, in the atmosphere of the object. In\naddition, we place an upper limit on the abundance of CH$_4$. We compare\nqualitatively our results to studies that have applied model retrieval on\nmultiband photometry and emission spectroscopy of hot Jupiters (extrasolar\ngiant planets with orbital periods of several days) and the directly imaged\ngiant planet HR 8799b.\n", "  We consider energy minimizing configurations of a nematic liquid crystal\naround a spherical colloid particle, in the context of the Landau-de Gennes\nmodel. The nematic is assumed to occupy the exterior of a ball of radius r_0,\nsatisfy homeotropic weak anchoring at the surface of the colloid, and approach\na uniform uniaxial state at infinity. We study the minimizers in two different\nlimiting regimes: for balls which are small compared to the characteristic\nlength scale r_0<<L, and for large balls, r_0>>L. The relationship between the\nradius and the anchoring strength W is also relevant. For small balls we obtain\na limiting quadrupolar configuration, with a \"Saturn ring\" defect for\nrelatively strong anchoring, corresponding to an exchange of eigenvalues of the\nQ-tensor. In the limit of very large balls we obtain an axisymmetric minimizer\nof the Oseen-Frank energy, and a dipole configuration with exactly one point\ndefect is obtained.\n", "  We investigate the resummation effects with a jet veto, for WZ and ZZ\nproductions at the LHC in soft-collinear effective theory. We present the\ninvariant mass distributions and the total cross section with different jet\nveto and jet radius for these process at Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Logarithmic\nlevel. Our results show that the jet-veto resummation can increase the jet-veto\ncross section and decrease the scale uncertainties, especially in the large\ncenter-of-mass energy. We find that for pt_veto>30 GeV and R=0.4, the\nresummation results can increase POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions by about 19% for WZ\nproduction and 18% for ZZ production, respectively. Our results agree with the\nCMS data for WZ productions within 2$\\sigma$ C.L. at 8 TeV, which can explain\nthe 2$\\sigma$ discrepancy between the CMS experimental results and theoretical\npredictions based on NLO calculation with parton showers.\n", "  We calculate the production of a massive vector boson by quantum fluctuations\nduring inflation. This gives a novel dark-matter production mechanism quite\ndistinct from misalignment or thermal production. While scalars and tensors are\ntypically produced with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum, surprisingly the\nvector is produced with a power spectrum peaked at intermediate wavelengths.\nThus dangerous, long-wavelength, isocurvature perturbations are suppressed.\nFurther, at long wavelengths the vector inherits the usual adiabatic, nearly\nscale-invariant perturbations of the inflaton, allowing it to be a good dark\nmatter candidate. The final abundance can be calculated precisely from the mass\nand the Hubble scale of inflation, H_I. Saturating the dark matter abundance we\nfind a prediction for the mass m = 10^-5 eV (10^14 GeV/H_I)^4. High-scale\ninflation, potentially observable in the CMB, motivates an exciting mass range\nfor recently proposed direct detection experiments for hidden photon dark\nmatter. Such experiments may be able to reconstruct the distinctive, peaked\npower spectrum, verifying that the dark matter was produced by quantum\nfluctuations during inflation and providing a direct measurement of the scale\nof inflation. Thus a detection would not only be the discovery of dark matter,\nit would also provide an unexpected probe of inflation itself.\n", "  Recently, for spinless non-relativistic particles, Norsen, Marian and Oriols\nshow that in the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation it is possible to replace the\nwave function in the configuration space by single-particle wave functions in\nphysical space. In this paper, we show that this replacment of the wave\nfunction in the configuration space by single-particle functions in the\n3D-space is also possible for particles with spin, in particular for the\nparticles of the EPR-B experiment, the Bohm version of the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment.\n", "  We study the effects of energy transport in the Sun by asymmetric dark matter\nwith momentum and velocity-dependent interactions, with an eye to solving the\ndecade-old Solar Abundance Problem. We study effective theories where the dark\nmatter-nucleon scattering cross-section goes as $v_{\\rm rel}^{2n}$ and $q^{2n}$\nwith $n = -1, 0, 1 $ or $2$, where $v_{\\rm rel}$ is the dark matter-nucleon\nrelative velocity and $q$ is the momentum exchanged in the collision. Such\ncross-sections can arise generically as leading terms from the most basic\nnonstandard DM-quark operators. We employ a high-precision solar simulation\ncode to study the impact on solar neutrino rates, the sound speed profile,\nconvective zone depth, surface helium abundance and small frequency\nseparations. We find that the majority of models that improve agreement with\nthe observed sound speed profile and depth of the convection zone also reduce\nneutrino fluxes beyond the level that can be reasonably accommodated by\nmeasurement and theory errors. However, a few specific points in parameter\nspace yield a significant overall improvement. A 3-5 GeV DM particle with\n$\\sigma_{SI} \\propto q^2$ is particularly appealing, yielding more than a\n$6\\sigma$ improvement with respect to standard solar models, while being\nallowed by direct detection and collider limits. We provide full analytical\ncapture expressions for $q$- and $v_{\\rm rel}$-dependent scattering, as well as\ncomplete likelihood tables for all models.\n", "  We present predictions for the clustering of galaxies selected by their\nemission at far infra-red (FIR) and sub-millimetre wavelengths. This includes\nthe first predictions for the effect of clustering biases induced by the coarse\nangular resolution of single-dish telescopes at these wavelengths. We combine a\nnew version of the GALFORM model of galaxy formation with a self-consistent\nmodel for calculating the absorption and re-emission of radiation by\ninterstellar dust. Model galaxies selected at $850$ $\\mu$m reside in dark\nmatter halos of mass $M_{\\rm halo}\\sim10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$,\nindependent of redshift (for $0.2\\lesssim z\\lesssim4$) or flux (for\n$0.25\\lesssim S_{850\\mu\\rm m}\\lesssim4$ mJy). At $z\\sim2.5$, the brightest\ngalaxies ($S_{850\\mu\\rm m}>4$ mJy) exhibit a correlation length of\n$r_{0}=5.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, consistent with observations. We show\nthat these galaxies have descendants with stellar masses $M_{\\star}\\sim10^{11}$\n$h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ occupying halos spanning a broad range in mass $M_{\\rm\nhalo}\\sim10^{12}-10^{14}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The FIR emissivity at shorter\nwavelengths ($250$, $350$ and $500$ $\\mu$m) is also dominated by galaxies in\nthe halo mass range $M_{\\rm halo}\\sim10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$,\nagain independent of redshift (for $0.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5$). We compare our\npredictions for the angular power spectrum of cosmic infra-red background\nanisotropies at these wavelengths with observations, finding agreement to\nwithin a factor of $\\sim2$ over all scales and wavelengths, an improvement over\nearlier versions of the model. Simulating images at $850$ $\\mu$m, we show that\nconfusion effects boost the measured angular correlation function on all scales\nby a factor of $\\sim4$. This has important consequences, potentially leading to\ninferred halo masses being overestimated by an order of magnitude.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of a few bosons in a double well potential is studied\nusing a Bose Hubbard model. We consider both signs for the on-site\ninterparticle interaction and also investigated the situations where they are\nlarge and small. Interesting distinctive features are noted for the tunneling\noscillations of these bosons corresponding to the above scenarios. Further, the\nsensitivity of the particle dynamics to the initial conditions has been\nstudied. It is found that corresponding to an odd number of particles, such as\nthree (or five), an initial condition of having unequal number of particles in\nthe wells has interesting consequences, which is most discernible when the\npopulation difference between the wells is unity.\n", "  Many quantum information tasks rely on entanglement, which is used as a\nresource, for example, to enable efficient and secure communication. Typically,\nnoise, accompanied by loss of entanglement, reduces the efficiency of quantum\nprotocols. We develop and demonstrate experimentally a superdense coding scheme\nwith noise, where the decrease of entanglement in Alice's encoding state does\nnot reduce the efficiency of the information transmission. Having almost fully\ndephased classical two-photon polarization state at the time of encoding with\nconcurrence $0.163\\pm0.007$, we reach values of mutual information close to\n$1.52\\pm 0.02$ ($1.89\\pm 0.05$) with 3-state (4-state) encoding. This high\nefficiency relies both on non-Markovian features, that Bob exploits just before\nhis Bell-state measurement, and on very high visibility ($99.6\\%\\pm0.1\\%$) of\nthe Hong-Ou-Mandel interference within the experimental set-up. Our\nproof-of-principle results with measurements on mutual information pave the way\nfor exploiting non-Markovianity to improve the efficiency and security of\nquantum information processing tasks.\n", "  In this paper we consider the Grioli-Koiter-Mindlin-Toupin linear isotropic\nindeterminate couple stress model. Our main aim is to show that, up to now, the\nboundary conditions have not been completely understood for this model. As it\nturns out, and to our own surprise, restricting the well known boundary\nconditions stemming from the strain gradient or second gradient models to the\nparticular case of the indeterminate couple stress model, does not always\nreduce to the Grioli-Koiter-Mindlin-Toupin set of accepted boundary conditions.\nWe present, therefore, a proof of the fact that when specific \"mixed\"\nkinematical and traction boundary conditions are assigned on the boundary, no\n\"a priori\" equivalence can be established between Mindlin's and our approach.\n", "  We introduce a complex pure connection action with constraints which is\ndiffeomorphism and gauge invariant. Taking as an internal group $SU(2)$, we\nobtain, from the equations of motion, anti-self-dual Einstein spaces together\nwith the zero torsion condition thanks to Bianchi identity. By applying the\nsame procedure, we take as internal symmetry the super group $OSp(1|2)$ and by\nmeans of the Bianchi identity and integrability conditions, the equations of\nmotion are those that come from anti-self-dual supergravity $N=1$ with\ncosmological constant sector.\n", "  We investigate the connection between the linear harmonic oscillator equation\nand some classes of second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations of\nLi\\'enard and generalized Li\\'enard type, which physically describe important\noscillator systems. By using a method inspired by quantum mechanics, and which\nconsist on the deformation of the phase space coordinates of the harmonic\noscillator, we generalize the equation of motion of the classical linear\nharmonic oscillator to several classes of strongly non-linear differential\nequations. The first integrals, and a number of exact solutions of the\ncorresponding equations are explicitly obtained. The devised method can be\nfurther generalized to derive explicit general solutions of nonlinear second\norder differential equations unrelated to the harmonic oscillator. Applications\nof the obtained results for the study of the travelling wave solutions of the\nreaction-convection-diffusion equations, and of the large amplitude free\nvibrations of a uniform cantilever beam are also presented.\n", "  In this work the Gardner problem of inferring interactions and fields for an\nIsing neural network from given patterns under a local stability hypothesis is\naddressed under a dual perspective. By means of duality arguments an integer\nlinear system is defined whose solution space is the dual of the Gardner space\nand whose solutions represent mutually unstable patterns. We propose and\ndiscuss Monte Carlo methods in order to find and remove unstable patterns and\nuniformly sample the space of interactions thereafter. We illustrate the\nproblem on a set of real data and perform ensemble calculation that shows how\nthe emergence of phase dominated by unstable patterns can be triggered in a\nnon-linear discontinuous way.\n", "  We present a new circuit for non-Boolean recognition of binary images.\nEmploying all-spin logic (ASL) devices, we design logic comparators and\nnon-Boolean decision blocks for compact and efficient computation. By\nmanipulation of fan-in number in different stages of the circuit, the structure\ncan be extended for larger training sets or larger images. Operating based on\nthe mainly similarity idea, the system is capable of constructing a mean image\nand compare it with a separate input image within a short decision time. Taking\nadvantage of the non-volatility of ASL devices, the proposed circuit is capable\nof hybrid memory/logic operation. Compared with existing CMOS pattern\nrecognition circuits, this work achieves a smaller footprint, lower power\nconsumption, faster decision time and a lower operational voltage. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first fully spin-based complete pattern\nrecognition circuit demonstrated using spintronic devices.\n", "  The \"exact\" or \"functional\" renormalization group equation describes the\nrenormalization group flow of the effective average action $\\Gamma_k$. The\nordinary effective action $\\Gamma_0$ can be obtained by integrating the flow\nequation from an ultraviolet scale $k=\\Lambda$ down to $k=0$. We give several\nexamples of such calculations at one-loop, both in renormalizable and in\neffective field theories. We use the results of Barvinsky, Vilkovisky and\nAvramidi on the non-local heat kernel coefficients to reproduce the four point\nscattering amplitude in the case of a real scalar field theory with quartic\npotential and in the case of the pion chiral lagrangian. In the case of gauge\ntheories, we reproduce the vacuum polarization of QED and of Yang-Mills theory.\nWe also compute the two point functions for scalars and gravitons in the\neffective field theory of scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity.\n", "  We study the effect of resonances near the threshold of low energy\n($\\varepsilon$) reactive scattering processes, and find an anomalous behavior\nof the $s$-wave cross sections. For reaction and inelastic processes, the cross\nsection exhibits the energy dependence $\\sigma\\sim\\varepsilon^{-3/2}$ instead\nof the standard Wigner's law threshold behavior $\\sigma\\sim\\varepsilon^{-1/2}$.\nWigner's law is still valid as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$, but in a narrow\nrange of energies. We illustrate these effects with two reactive systems, a\nlow-reactive system (H$_2$ + Cl) and a more reactive one (H$_2$ + F). We\nprovide analytical expressions, and explain this anomalous behavior using the\nproperties of the Jost functions. We also discuss the implication of the\nreaction rate coefficients behaving as $K\\sim 1/T$ at low temperatures, instead\nof the expected constant rate of the Wigner regime in ultracold physics and\nchemistry.\n", "  We report electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ measurements on a range of\ntwo-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) of varying linear extent. Intriguingly,\nat low temperatures ($T$) and low carrier density ($n_{\\mathrm{s}}$) we find\nthe behavior to be consistent with $\\sigma \\sim L^{\\alpha}$, where $L$ is the\nlength of the 2DEG along the direction of transport. Importantly, such\nscale-dependent behavior is precisely in accordance with the scaling hypothesis\nof localization~[Abrahams~\\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{42}, 673\n(1979)] which dictates that in systems where the electronic wave function $\\xi$\nis localized, $\\sigma$ is not a material-specific parameter, but depends on the\nsystem dimensions. From our data we are able to construct the\n\"$\\beta$-function\" $\\equiv (h/e^2) d \\ln \\sigma / d \\ln L$ and show this to be\nstrongly consistent with theoretically predicted limiting values. These results\nsuggest, remarkably, that the electrons in the studied 2DEGs preserve phase\ncoherence over lengths $\\sim~10~\\mu$m. This suggests the utility of the 2DEGs\nstudied towards applications in quantum information as well as towards\nfundamental investigations into many-body localized phases.\n", "  Contour integrals of rational functions over ${\\cal M}_{0,n}$, the moduli\nspace of $n$-punctured spheres, have recently appeared at the core of the\ntree-level S-matrix of massless particles in arbitrary dimensions. The contour\nis determined by the critical points of a certain Morse function on ${\\cal\nM}_{0,n}$. The integrand is a general rational function of the puncture\nlocations with poles of arbitrary order as two punctures coincide. In this note\nwe provide an algorithm for the analytic computation of any such integral. The\nalgorithm uses three ingredients: an operation we call general KLT, Petersen's\ntheorem applied to the existence of a 2-factor in any 4-regular graph and\nHamiltonian decompositions of certain 4-regular graphs. The procedure is\niterative and reduces the computation of a general integral to that of simple\nbuilding blocks. These are integrals which compute double-color-ordered partial\namplitudes in a bi-adjoint cubic scalar theory.\n", "  The low temperature unitary Bose gas is a fundamental paradigm in few-body\nand many-body physics, attracting wide theoretical and experimental interest.\nHere we first present a theoretical model that describes the dynamic\ncompetition between two-body evaporation and three-body re-combination in a\nharmonically trapped unitary atomic gas above the condensation temperature. We\nidentify a universal magic trap depth where, within some parameter range,\nevaporative cooling is balanced by recombination heating and the gas\ntemperature stays constant. Our model is developed for the usual\nthree-dimensional evaporation regime as well as the 2D evaporation case.\nExperiments performed with unitary 133 Cs and 7 Li atoms fully support our\npredictions and enable quantitative measurements of the 3-body recombination\nrate in the low temperature domain. In particular, we measure for the first\ntime the Efimov inelasticity parameter $\\eta$ * = 0.098(7) for the 47.8-G\nd-wave Feshbach resonance in 133 Cs. Combined 133 Cs and 7 Li experimental data\nallow investigations of loss dynamics over two orders of magnitude in\ntemperature and four orders of magnitude in three-body loss. We confirm the 1/T\n2 temperature universality law up to the constant $\\eta$ *.\n", "  The Sagdeev potential technique has been employed to study the dust ion\nacoustic solitary waves and double layers in an unmagnetized collisionless\ndusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains, adiabatic\nwarm ions, and isothermally distributed electrons and positrons. A\ncomputational scheme has been developed to draw the qualitatively different\ncompositional parameter spaces or solution spaces showing the nature of\nexistence of different solitary structures with respect to any parameter of the\npresent plasma system. The qualitatively distinct solution spaces give the\noverall scenario regarding the existence of different solitary structures. The\npresent system supports both positive and negative potential double layers. The\nnegative potential double layer always restricts the occurrence of negative\npotential solitary waves, i.e., any sequence of negative potential solitary\nwaves having monotonically increasing amplitude converges to a negative\npotential double layer. However, there exists a parameter regime for which the\npositive potential double layer is unable to restrict the occurrence of\npositive potential solitary waves. As a result, in this region of the parameter\nspace, there exist solitary waves after the formation of positive potential\ndouble layer, i.e., positive potential supersolitons have been observed. But\nthe amplitudes of these supersolitons are bounded. A general theory for the\nexistence of bounded supersolitons has been discussed analytically by imposing\nthe restrictions on the Mach number. For any small value of positron\nconcentration, there is no effect of very hot positrons on the dust ion\nacoustic solitary structures. The qualitatively different solution spaces are\ncapable of producing new results for the formation of solitary structures.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological dependence and the constraining power of\nlarge-scale galaxy correlations, including all redshift-distortions,\nwide-angle, lensing and gravitational potential effects on linear scales. We\nanalyze the cosmological information present in the lensing convergence and in\nthe gravitational potential terms describing the so-called \"relativistic\neffects,\" and we find that, while smaller than the information contained in\nintrinsic galaxy clustering, it is not negligible. We investigate how\nneglecting them does bias cosmological measurements performed by future\nspectroscopic and photometric large-scale surveys such as SKA and Euclid. We\nperform a Fisher analysis using the CLASS code, modified to include\nscale-dependent galaxy bias and redshift-dependent magnification and evolution\nbias. Our results show that neglecting relativistic terms introduces an error\nin the forecasted precision in measuring cosmological parameters of the order\nof a few tens of percent, in particular when measuring the matter content of\nthe Universe and primordial non-Gaussianity parameters. Therefore, we argue\nthat radial correlations and integrated relativistic terms need to be taken\ninto account when forecasting the constraining power of future large-scale\nnumber counts of galaxy surveys.\n", "  A locking-free rectangular Mindlin plate element with a new multi-resolution\nanalysis (MRA) is proposed and a new finite element method is hence presented.\nThe MRA framework is formulated out of a mutually nesting displacement subspace\nsequence whose basis functions are constructed of scaling and shifting on the\nelement domain of basic node shape function. The basic node shape function is\nconstructed by extending the node shape function of a traditional Mindlin plate\nelement to other three quadrants around the coordinate zero point. As a result,\na new rational MRA concept together with the resolution level (RL) is\nconstituted for the element. The traditional 4-node rectangular Mindlin plate\nelement and method is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the\nproposed element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element\nmodel is based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution\nis laid on the rigorous mathematical basis. The analysis clarity of a plate\nstructure is actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. Thus, the accuracy\nof a plate structural analysis is replaced by the clarity, the irrational MRA\nby the rational and the mesh model by the RL that is the discretized model by\nthe integrated.\n", "  We solve the long-standing problem of making n perfect clones from m copies\nof one of two known pure states with minimum failure probability in the general\ncase where the known states have arbitrary a priori probabilities. The solution\nemerges from a geometric formulation of the problem. This formulation also\nreveals a deeper connection between cloning and state discrimination. The\nconvergence of cloning to state discrimination as the number of clones goes to\ninfinity exhibits a phenomenon analogous to a second order symmetry breaking\nphase transition.\n", "  Coulomb drag is a transport phenomenon whereby long-range Coulomb interaction\nbetween charge carriers in two closely spaced but electrically isolated\nconductors induces a voltage (or, in a closed circuit, a current) in one of the\nconductors when an electrical current is passed through the other. The\nmagnitude of the effect depends on the exact nature of the charge carriers and\nmicroscopic, many-body structure of the electronic systems in the two\nconductors. Drag measurements have become part of the standard toolbox in\ncondensed matter physics that can be used to study fundamental properties of\ndiverse physical systems including semiconductor heterostructures, graphene,\nquantum wires, quantum dots, and optical cavities.\n", "  FRBs are puzzling, millisecond, energetic radio transients with no\ndiscernible source; observations show no counterparts in other frequency bands.\nThe birth of a quark star from a parent neutron star experiencing a quark nova\n- previously thought undetectable when born in isolation - provides a natural\nexplanation for the emission characteristics of FRBs. The generation of\nunstable r-process elements in the quark nova ejecta provides millisecond\nexponential injection of electrons into the surrounding strong magnetic field\nat the parent neutron star's light cylinder via $\\beta$-decay. This radio\nsynchrotron emission has a total duration of hundreds of milliseconds and\nmatches the observed spectrum while reducing the inferred dispersion measure by\napproximately 200 cm$^{-3}$ pc. The model allows indirect measurement of\nneutron star magnetic fields and periods in addition to providing astronomical\nmeasurements of $\\beta$-decay chains of unstable neutron rich nuclei. Using\nthis model, we can calculate expected FRB average energies ($\\sim$ 10$^{41}$\nergs), spectra shapes and provide a theoretical framework for determining\ndistances.\n", "  We consider the polarization of thermal emission in the near-field of various\nmaterials including dielectrics and metallic systems with resonant surface\nmodes. We find that at thermal equilibrium, the degree of polarization exhibits\nspatial oscillations with a period of approximately half the optical\nwavelength, independent of material composition. This result contrasts with\nthat of Setala, Kaivola and Friberg [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 123902 (2002)], who\nfind monotonic decay of the degree of polarization for systems in local thermal\nequilibrium.\n", "  While the stoichiometric intermetallic compound FeAl is found to be\nparamagnetic in experiment, standard band-theory approaches predict the\nmaterial to be ferromagnetic. We show that this discrepancy can be overcome by\na better treatment of electronic correlations with density functional plus\ndynamical mean field theory. Our results show no ferromagnetism down to 100 K\nand since the susceptibility is decreasing at the lowest temperatures studied\nwe also do not expect ferromagnetism at even lower temperatures. This behavior\nis found to originate from temporal quantum fluctuations that screen\nshort-lived local magnetic moments of 1.6 $\\mu_B$ on Fe.\n", "  Monopole operators play a central role in 3 dimensional supersymmetric\ndualities: a careful understanding of their spectrum is necessary to match\nchiral operators on either sides of a conjectured duality. In Chern-Simons\ntheories ($k\\neq0$), monopole operators acquire an electric charge, thus they\nneed to be \"dressed\" by chiral matter superfields to be made gauge-invariant.\nHere we present strong evidence that \"dressed\" monopoles appear in $SU(N)$\nchiral theories even for $k=0$ because of mixed CS terms generated along\ncertain Coulomb branch directions. Our analysis is based on the dimensional\nreduction of 4-dimensional dualities which, for the simplest s-confining case,\nallows us to easily identify the spectrum of the electric chiral operators.\n", "  Applying semi-classical Quantum Mechanics, the vacuum fluctuations within a\nstar are determined, assuming a constant mass density and applying a monopole\napproximation. It is found that the density for the vacuum fluctuations does\nnot only depend linearly on the mass density, as assumed in a former\npublication, where neutron stars up to 6 solar masses were obtained. This is\nused to propose a simple model on the dependence of the dark energy to the mass\ndensity, as a function of the radial distance r. It is shown that stars with up\nto 200 solar masses can, in principle, be obtained. Though, we use a simple\nmodel, it shows that in the presence of vacuum fluctuations stars with large\nmasses can be stabilized and probably stars up to any mass can exist, which\nusually are identified as black holes.\n", "  We use the polynomial formulation of the holomorphic anomaly equations\ngoverning perturbative topological string theory to derive the free energies in\na scaling limit to all orders in perturbation theory for any Calabi-Yau\nthreefold. The partition function in this limit satisfies an Airy differential\nequation in a rescaled topological string coupling. One of the two solutions of\nthis equation gives the perturbative expansion and the other solution provides\ngeometric hints of the non-perturbative structure of topological string theory.\nBoth solutions can be expanded naturally around strong coupling.\n", "  We present a model of (modified) gravity on spacetimes with fractal structure\nbased on packing of spheres, which are (Euclidean) variants of the Packed Swiss\nCheese Cosmology models. As the action functional for gravity we consider the\nspectral action of noncommutative geometry, and we compute its expansion on a\nspace obtained as an Apollonian packing of 3-dimensional spheres inside a\n4-dimensional ball. Using information from the zeta function of the Dirac\noperator of the spectral triple, we compute the leading terms in the asymptotic\nexpansion of the spectral action. They consist of a zeta regularization of a\ndivergent sum which involves the leading terms of the spectral actions of the\nindividual spheres in the packing. This accounts for the contribution of the\npoints 1 and 3 in the dimension spectrum (as in the case of a 3-sphere). There\nis an additional term coming from the residue at the additional point in the\nreal dimension spectrum that corresponds to the packing constant, as well as a\nseries of fluctuations coming from log-periodic oscillations, created by the\npoints of the dimension spectrum that are off the real line. These terms detect\nthe fractality of the residue set of the sphere packing. We show that the\npresence of fractality influences the shape of the slow-roll potential for\ninflation, obtained from the spectral action. We also discuss the effect of\ntruncating the fractal structure at a certain scale related to the energy scale\nin the spectral action.\n", "  I study finite-temperature $\\mathcal N=1$ super Yang-Mills for any gauge\ngroup $G=A_N, B_N, C_N, D_N, E_{6,7,8},F_4,G_2$, compactified from four\ndimensions on a torus, $\\mathbb R^2\\times S^1_L\\times S^1_{\\beta}$. I examine\nin particular the low temperature regime $L\\ll\\beta=1/T$, where $L$ is the\nlength of the spatial circle with periodic boundary conditions and with\nanti-periodic boundary conditions for the adjoint gauginos along the thermal\ncycle $S^1_{\\beta}$. For small such $L$ we are in a regime were semiclassical\ncalculations can be performed and a transition occurs at $T_c$ much smaller\nthan $1/NL$. The transition is mediated by the competition between\nnon-perturbative objects including 'exotic' topological molecules: neutral and\nmagnetic bions composed of BPS and KK monopole constituents, with $r=rank(G)$\ndifferent charges in the co-root lattice of the gauge group $G$, and the\nperturbative electrically charged W-bosons (along with their wino\nsuperpartners). I determine a duality to a double Coulomb gas of neutral and\nmagnetic bions of different charges of their constituent monopole-instantons,\nand W-bosons of both scalar and electric charges. Aharanov-Bohm interactions\nexist between magnetic bions and W-bosons, and scalar charges of W-bosons and\nneutral bions attract like charges, as opposed to the magnetic and electric\ncharges where like charges repel. It is hoped in the future that lattice\nstudies of this Coulomb gas can be done as in [1] for all gauge groups. It is\nhoped that a dual lattice 'affine' XY model with symmetry breaking\nperturbations can also be found in future studies of general gauge group as\ndone in [1] for $SU(2)$.\n", "  We carried out light curve solutions of ten detached eclipsing eccentric\nbinaries observed by Kepler. The formal errors of the derived parameters from\nthe light curve solutions are below 1%. Our results give indications that the\ncomponents of the eccentric binaries (especially those with mass ratios below\n0.5) do not follow precisely the empirical relations between the stellar\nparameters derived from the study of circular-orbit binaries. We found the\nfollowing peculiarities of the targets: (a) the components of KIC 9474969 have\nalmost the same temperatures while their radii and masses differ by a factor\naround 2.5; (b) KIC 6949550 reveals semi-regular light variations with an\namplitude of 0.004 and a period around 7 d which are modulated by long-term\nvariations; (c) KIC 6220470, KIC 11071207, and KIC 9474969 exhibit tidally\ninduced 'hump' around the periastron. These are the targets with the biggest\nrelative radii of our sample. We derived the dependence of the hump amplitude\non the relative stellar radii, eccentricity, and mass ratio of eccentric binary\nconsisting of MS stars.\n", "  In this paper, I show that if a spin network is cut by a surface separating\nspace-time into two regions, the sum of spins of edges crossing the surface\nmust be an integer. This gives a restriction on the area spectrum of such\nsurfaces, including black hole horizons, in loop quantum gravity.\n", "  The different contributions to the entropy change linked to the\naustenite-martensitic transition in a Ni-Mn-Sn metamagnetic shape memory alloy\nhave been determined by combining different experimental techniques. The\nvibrational contribution has been inferred from the vibrational density of\nstates of both the martensitic and austenite phases. This has been accomplished\nby combining time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements and ab-initio\ncalculations. Further, the electronic part of the entropy change has also been\ncalculated. Since the martensitic transformation takes place between two\nparamagnetic phases, the magnetic contribution can be neglected and the entropy\nchange can be reduced to the sum of two terms: vibrational and electronic. The\nobtained value of the vibrational contribution (-36 \\pm 5 J kg^(-1) K^(-1))\nnearly provides the total entropy change measured by calorimetry (-41 \\pm 3 J\nkg^(-1) K^(-1)), the difference being the electronic contribution within the\nexperimental error.\n", "  The distribution of local gravitational potentials generated by a complete\nvolume-limited sample of galaxy groups and clusters filling the Corona Borealis\nregion has been derived to search for new gravitational hints in the context of\nclus-tering analysis unrevealed by alternative methodologies. Mapping such a\ndistribution as a function of spatial positions, the deepest potential wells in\nthe sample trace unambiguously the locations of the densest galaxy cluster\nclumps providing the physical keys to bring out gravitational features\nconnected to the formation, composition and evolution of the major clustered\nstructures filling that region. As expected, the three deepest potential wells\nfound at Equatorial coordinates: (~ 230{\\deg}, ~ 28{\\deg}, z ~ 0.075), (~\n240{\\deg}, ~ 27{\\deg}, z ~ 0.09) and, (227{\\deg}, 5.8{\\deg}, z ~ 0.0788)\ncorrespond to massive superclusters of galaxy groups and clusters identified as\nthe Corona Borealis, A2142 and Virgo-Serpent, respectively. However, the\ndeepest isopotential contours around the Corona Borealis and A2142\nsuperclusters seem to suggest a gravitational feature similar to a giant\nbinary-like system connected by a filamentary structure. To a first\napproximation, it seems unlikely that this hypothesized system could be\ngravitationally bound.\n", "  We find new spontaneously generated fuzzy extra dimensions emerging from a\ncertain deformation of $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with cubic\nsoft supersymmetry breaking and mass deformation terms. First, we determine a\nparticular four dimensional fuzzy vacuum that may be expressed in terms of a\ndirect sum of product of two fuzzy spheres, and denote it in short as $S_F^{2\\,\nInt}\\times S_F^{2\\, Int}$. The direct sum structure of the vacuum is revealed\nby a suitable splitting of the scalar fields in the model in a manner that\ngeneralizes our approach in \\cite{Seckinson}. Fluctuations around this vacuum\nhave the structure of gauge fields over $S_F^{2\\, Int}\\times S_F^{2\\, Int}$,\nand this enables us to conjecture the spontaneous broken model as an effective\n$U(n)$ $(n < {\\cal N})$ gauge theory on the product manifold $M^4 \\times\nS_F^{2\\, Int} \\times S_F^{2\\, Int}$. We support this interpretation by\nexamining the $U(4)$ theory and determining all of the $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$\nequivariant fields in the model, characterizing its low energy degrees of\nfreedom. Monopole sectors with winding numbers $(\\pm\n1,0),\\,(0,\\pm1),\\,(\\pm1,\\pm 1)$ are accessed from $S_F^{2\\, Int}\\times S_F^{2\\,\nInt}$ after suitable projections and subsequently equivariant fields in these\nsectors are obtained. We indicate how Abelian Higgs type models with vortex\nsolutions emerge after dimensionally reducing over the fuzzy monopole sectors\nas well. A family of fuzzy vacua is determined by giving a systematic treatment\nfor the splitting of the scalar fields and it is made manifest that suitable\nprojections of these vacuum solutions yield all higher winding number fuzzy\nmonopole sectors. We observe that the vacuum configuration $S_F^{2\\, Int}\\times\nS_F^{2\\, Int}$ identifies with the bosonic part of the product of two fuzzy\nsuperspheres with $OSP(2,2)\\times OSP(2,2)$ supersymmetry and elaborate on this\nfeature.\n", "  Relativistic reflection models of the X-ray spectrum of the `complex' Narrow\nLine Seyfert 1 (NLS1) 1H 0707-495 require a high spin, moderate inclination,\nlow mass black hole. With these parameters fixed, the observed optical/UV\nemission directly determines the mass accretion rate through the outer disc and\nhence predicts the bolometric luminosity. This is $140-260~\\times$ the\nEddington limit. Such a disc should power a strong wind, and winds are\ngenerically expected to be clumpy. Changing inclination angle with respect to a\nclumpy wind structure gives a possible explanation for the otherwise puzzling\ndifference between `complex' NLS1 such as 1H 0707-495 and `simple' ones like PG\n1244+026. Lines of sight which intercept the wind show deep absorption features\nat iron from the hot phase of the wind, together with stochastic dips and\ncomplex absorption when the clumps occult the X-ray source (complex NLS1),\nwhereas both these features are absent for more face-on inclination (simple\nNLS1). This geometry is quite different to the clean view of a flat disc which\nis assumed for the spin measurements in relativistic reflection models, so it\nis possible that even 1H 0707-495 has low spin. If so, this re-opens the\nsimplest and hence very attractive possibility that high black hole spin is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition to trigger highly relativistic (bulk Lorentz\nfactor $\\sim 10-15$) jets.\n", "  The prompt emission of the long, smooth, and single-pulsed gamma-ray burst,\nGRB $\\textit{141028A}$, is analyzed under the guise of an external shock model.\nFirst, we fit the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum with a two-component photon model,\nnamely synchrotron+blackbody, and then fit the recovered evolution of the\nsynchrotron $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak to an analytic model derived considering the\nemission of a relativistic blast-wave expanding into an external medium. The\nprediction of the model for the $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak evolution matches well with\nthe observations. We observe the blast-wave transitioning into the deceleration\nphase. Further we assume the expansion of the blast-wave to be nearly\nadiabatic, motivated by the low magnetic field deduced from the observations.\nThis allows us to recover within an order of magnitude the flux density at the\n$\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak, which is remarkable considering the simplicity of the\nanalytic model. Across all wavelengths, synchrotron emission from a single\nforward shock provides a sufficient solution for the observations. Under this\nscenario we argue that the distinction between $\\textit{prompt}$ and $\\textit{\nafterglow}$ emission is superfluous as both early and late time emission\nemanate from the same source. While the external shock model is clearly not a\nuniversal solution, this analysis opens the possibility that at least some\nfraction of GRBs can be explained with an external shock origin of their prompt\nphase.\n", "  We consider the low-energy particle-particle scattering properties in a\nperiodic simple cubic crystal. In particular, we investigate the relation\nbetween the two-body scattering length and the energy shift experienced by the\nlowest-lying unbound state when this is placed in a periodic finite box. We\nintroduce a continuum model for s-wave contact interactions that respects the\nsymmetry of the Brillouin zone in its regularisation and renormalisation\nprocedures, and corresponds to the na{\\\"i}ve continuum limit of the Hubbard\nmodel. The energy shifts are found to be identical to those obtained in the\nusual spherically symmetric renormalisation scheme upon resolving an important\nsubtlety regarding the cutoff procedure. We then particularize to the Hubbard\nmodel, and find that for large finite lattices the results are identical to\nthose obtained in the continuum limit. The results reported here are valid in\nthe weak, intermediate and unitary limits, and can be used for the extraction\nof scattering information ,via exact diagonalisation or Monte Carlo methods, of\ntwo-body systems in realistic periodic lattices.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of future electron-positron colliders to UV\ncompletions of the fermionic Higgs portal operator $H^\\dagger H \\bar \\chi\n\\chi$. Measurements of precision electroweak $S$ and $T$ parameters and the\n$e^+e^- \\to Zh$ cross section at the CEPC, FCC-ee, and ILC are considered. The\nscalar completion of the fermionic Higgs portal is closely related to the\nscalar Higgs portal, and we summarize existing results. We devote the bulk of\nour analysis to a singlet-doublet fermion completion. Assuming the doublet is\nsufficiently heavy, we construct the effective field theory (EFT) at\ndimension-6 in order to compute contributions to the observables. We also\nprovide full one-loop results for $S$ and $T$ in the general mass parameter\nspace. In both completions, future precision measurements can probe the new\nstates at the (multi-)TeV scale, beyond the direct reach of the LHC.\n", "  Social media and social networking sites have become a global pinboard for\nexposition and discussion of news, topics, and ideas, where social media users\noften update their opinions about a particular topic by learning from the\nopinions shared by their friends. In this context, can we learn a data-driven\nmodel of opinion dynamics that is able to accurately forecast opinions from\nusers? In this paper, we introduce SLANT, a probabilistic modeling framework of\nopinion dynamics, which represents users opinions over time by means of marked\njump diffusion stochastic differential equations, and allows for efficient\nmodel simulation and parameter estimation from historical fine grained event\ndata. We then leverage our framework to derive a set of efficient predictive\nformulas for opinion forecasting and identify conditions under which opinions\nconverge to a steady state. Experiments on data gathered from Twitter show that\nour model provides a good fit to the data and our formulas achieve more\naccurate forecasting than alternatives.\n", "  We study the decay of \"false\" domain walls, which are metastable states of\nthe quantum theory where the true vacuum is trapped inside the wall, with the\nfalse vacuum outside. We consider a theory with two scalar fields, a shepherd\nfield and a field of sheep. The shepherd field serves to herd the solitons of\nthe sheep field so that they are nicely bunched together. However, quantum\ntunnelling of the shepherd field releases the sheep to spread out\nuncontrollably. We show how to calculate the tunnelling amplitude for such a\ndisintegration.\n", "  We consider the Einstein-Maxwell-fluid constraint equations, and make use of\nthe conformal method to construct and parametrize constant-mean-curvature\nhyperboloidal initial data sets that satisfy the shear-free condition. This\ncondition is known to be necessary in order that a spacetime development admit\na regular conformal boundary at future null infinity. We work with initial data\nsets in a variety of regularity classes, primarily considering those data sets\nwhose geometries are weakly asymptotically hyperbolic, as defined in\n[arXiv:1506.03399]. These metrics are $C^{1,1}$ conformally compact, but not\nnecessarily $C^2$ conformally compact. In order to ensure that the data sets we\nconstruct are indeed shear-free, we make use of the conformally covariant\ntraceless Hessian introduced in [arXiv:1506.03399]. We furthermore construct a\nclass of initial data sets with weakly asymptotically hyerbolic metrics that\nmay be only $C^{0,1}$ conformally compact; these data sets are insufficiently\nregular to make sense of the shear-free condition.\n", "  Description of a nuclear system in its ground state and at low excitations\nbased on the equation of state (EoS) around normal density is presented. In the\nexpansion of the EoS around the saturation point additional spin polarization\nterms are taken into account. These terms, together with the standard symmetry\nterm, are responsible for appearance of the $\\alpha$-like clusters in the\nground state configurations of the N=Z even-even nuclei. At the nuclear surface\nthese clusters can be identified as alpha particles. A correction for the\nsurface effects is introduced for atomic nuclei. Taking into account an\nadditional interaction between clusters the binding energies and sizes of the\nconsidered nuclei are very accurately described. The limits of the EoS\nparameters are established from the properties of the $\\alpha$, $^{3}$He and\n$t$ particles.\n", "  Two recent theoretical works studied the role of Kitaev interactions in the\nnewly observed incommensurate magnetic order in the hyper-honeycomb\n($\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$) and stripy-honeycomb ($\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$) iridates.\nEach of these works analyzed a different model ($JK\\Gamma$ versus coupled\nzigzag chain model) using a contrasting method (classical versus soft-spin\nanalysis). The lack of commonality between these works precludes meaningful\ncomparisons and a proper understanding of these unusual orderings. In this\nstudy, we complete the unfinished picture initiated by these two works by\nsolving both models with both approaches for both 3D honeycomb iridates.\nThrough comparisons between all combinations of models, techniques, and\nmaterials, we find that the bond-isotropic $JK\\Gamma$ model consistently\npredicts the experimental phase of $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ regardless of the\nmethod used, while the experimental phase of $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ can be\ngenerated by the soft-spin approach with eigenmode mixing irrespective of the\nmodel used. To gain further insights, we solve a 1D quantum spin-chain model\nrelated to both 3D models using the density matrix renormalization group method\nto form a benchmark. We discover that in the 1D model, incommensurate\ncorrelations in the classical and soft-spin analysis survive in the quantum\nlimit only in the presence of the symmetric-off-diagonal exchange $\\Gamma$\nfound in the $JK\\Gamma$ model. The relevance of these results to the real\nmaterials are also discussed.\n", "  Canonical models of single-field, slow-roll inflation do not lead to\nappreciable non-Gaussianity, unless derivative interactions of the inflaton\nbecome uncontrollably large. We propose a novel slow-roll scenario where scalar\nperturbations propagate at a subluminal speed, leading to sizeable equilateral\nnon-Gaussianity, $f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm NL}\\propto 1/c_s^4$, largely insensitive\nto the ultraviolet physics. The model is based on a low-energy effective theory\ncharacterized by weakly broken invariance under internal galileon\ntransformations, $\\phi\\to\\phi+b_\\mu x^\\mu$, which protects the properties of\nperturbations from large quantum corrections. This provides the unique\nalternative to models such as DBI inflation in generating strongly\nsubluminal/non-Gaussian scalar perturbations.\n", "  We calculate thermal corrections to R\\'{e}nyi entropies for free massless\nfermions on a sphere. More specifically, we take a free fermion on\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and calculate the leading thermal correction\nto the R\\'{e}nyi entropies for a cap like region with opening angle $2\\theta$.\nBy expanding the density matrix in a Boltzmann sum, the problem of finding the\nR\\'{e}nyi entropies can be mapped to the problem of calculating a two point\nfunction on an $n$ sheeted cover of the sphere. We follow previous work for\nconformal field theories to map the problem on the sphere to a conical region\nin Euclidean space. By using the method of images, we calculate the two point\nfunction and recover the R\\'{e}nyi entropies.\n", "  We propose a novel method for sorting events of multiparticle production\naccording to the azimuthal anisotropy of their momentum distribution. Although\nthe method is quite general, we advocate its use in analysis of\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions where large number of hadrons is\nproduced. The advantage of our method is that it can automatically sort out\nsamples of events with histograms that indicate similar distributions of\nhadrons. It takes into account the whole measured histograms with all orders of\nanisotropy instead of a specific observable (e.g. $v_2$, $v_3$, $q_2$). It can\nbe used for more exclusive experimental studies of flow anisotropies which are\nthen more easily compared to theoretical calculations. It may also be useful in\nthe construction of mixed-events background for correlation studies as it\nallows to select events with similar momentum distribution.\n", "  Real-world complex systems exhibit multiple levels of relationships. In many\ncases they require to be modeled as interconnected multilayer networks,\ncharacterizing interactions of several types simultaneously. It is of crucial\nimportance in many fields, from economics to biology and from urban planning to\nsocial sciences, to identify the most (or the less) influential nodes in a\nnetwork using centrality measures. However, defining the centrality of actors\nin interconnected complex networks is not trivial. In this paper, we rely on\nthe tensorial formalism recently proposed to characterize and investigate this\nkind of complex topologies, and extend two well known random walk centrality\nmeasures, the random walk betweenness and closeness centrality, to\ninterconnected multilayer networks. For each of the measures we provide\nanalytical expressions that completely agree with numerically results.\n", "  This thesis focuses on the two main applications where free-space optical\ncommunication (FSOC) can bring the most significant impact: interplanetary\ncommunications and quantum communications. Consequently, the dissertation is\nstructured in two sections. In the first one, a novel proposal is suggested\nregarding to using Cherenkov telescopes as ground-station receivers. A\nfeasibility study addresses the posibility of using the technology developed\nfor the gamma-ray telescopes that will make up the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA) in the implementation of a new kind of ground station. Among the main\nadvantages that these telescopes provide are the much larger apertures needed\nto overcome the power limitation that ground-based gamma-ray astronomy and\ndeep-space optical communication both have. Also, the large number of big\ntelescopes that will be built for CTA will make it possible to reduce unitary\ncosts by economy-scale production. The second section of the thesis is framed\nin the field of free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which has become a\nnew paradigm in the discipline of information security. This technique offers a\ntheoretically-secure way to communicate over an insecure channel since the\npresence of an eventual eavesdropper can be detected. The main challenge of\nFree-space QKD is the need to operate both under strong atmospheric turbulence\nand daylight background noise. To mitigate these effects, a trade-off is\nusually required when designing the receiver's optics, since a narrow\nfield-of-view improves background noise rejection, but increases\nturbulence-related losses and a wide field-of-view produces the opposite\neffect. A correction system for atmospheric turbulence is proposed to overcome\nboth limitations at the same time, and different strategies are analyzed and\nexperimented to carry out the implementation and integration within the QKD\nsystem.\n", "  Oscillatory double-diffusive convection (ODDC) (also known as semi-\nconvection) refers to a type of double diffusive instability that occurs in\nregions of planetary and stellar interiors which have a destabilizing thermal\nstratification and a stabilizing mean molecular weight stratification. In this\nseries of papers, we use an extensive suite of three-dimensional (3D) numerical\nsimulations to quantify the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC.\nRosenblum et al. (2011) first showed that ODDC can either spontaneously form\nlayers, which significantly enhance the transport of heat and chemical species\ncompared to mi- croscopic transport, or remain in a state dominated by large\nscale gravity waves, in which there is a more modest enhancement of the\nturbulent transport rates. Subsequent studies in this series have focused on\nidentifying under what condi- tions layers form (Mirouh et al. 2012), and\nquantifying transport through layered systems (Wood et al. 2013). Here we\nproceed to characterize transport through systems that are unstable to the ODDC\ninstability, but do not undergo spon- taneous layer formation. We measure the\nthermal and compositional fluxes in non-layered ODDC from both 2D and 3D\nnumerical simulations and show that 3D simulations are well approximated by\nsimilar simulations in a 2D domain. We find that the turbulent mixing rate in\nthis regime is weak and can, to a first level approximation, be neglected. We\nconclude by summarizing the findings of papers I through III into a single\nprescription for transport by ODDC.\n", "  Strong-field ionization (SFI) has been shown to prepare wave packets with\nfew-femtosecond periods. Here, we explore whether this technique can be\nextended to the attosecond time scale. We introduce an intuitive model for\npredicting the bandwidth of ionic states that can be coherently prepared by\nSFI. This bandwidth is given by the Fourier-transformed sub-cycle SFI rate and\ndecreases considerably with increasing central wavelength of the ionizing\npulse. Many-body calculations based on time-dependent configuration-interaction\nsingles (TDCIS) quantitatively support this result and reveal an additional\ndecrease of the bandwidth as a consequence of channel interactions and\nnon-adiabatic dynamics. Our results further predict that multi-cycle\nfemtosecond pulses can coherently prepare attosecond wave packets with higher\nselectivity and versatility compared to single-cycle pulses.\n", "  Atoms deeply trapped in magic wavelength optical lattices provide a Doppler-\nand collision-free dense ensemble of quantum emitters ideal for high precision\nspectroscopy. Thus, they are the basis of some of the best optical clock setups\nto date. However, despite their minute optical dipole moments the inherent long\nrange dipole-dipole interactions in such lattices generate line shifts,\ndephasing and modified decay. We show that in a perfectly filled lattice these\neffects are resonantly enhanced depending on lattice constant, lattice geometry\nand excitation scheme inducing clock shifts of many atomic linewidths and\nreducing measurement precision via superradiance. However, under optimal\nconditions collective effects can be exploited to yield zero effective shifts\nand prolong dipole lifetimes beyond the single atom decay. In particular we\nidentify 2D hexagonal or square lattices with lattice constants below the\noptical wavelength as most promising configurations for an accuracy and\nprecision well below the independent ensemble limit. This geometry should also\nbe an ideal basis for related applications such as superradiant lasers,\nprecision magnetometry or long lived quantum memories.\n", "  We show that boundary contributions of BCFW recursions can be interpreted as\nthe form factors of some composite operators which we call 'boundary\noperators'. The boundary operators can be extracted from the operator product\nexpansion of deformed fields. We also present an algorithm to compute the\nboundary operators using path integral.\n", "  PSR B0540-69 has braking index measurement in its persistent state: n=2.129\n\\pm 0.012. Recently, it is reported to have spin-down state changes: a suddenly\n36 % increase in the spin-down rate. Combining the persistent state braking\nindex measurement and different spin-down states, PSR B0540-69 is more powerful\nthan intermittent pulsars in constraining pulsar spin-down models. The pulsar\nwind model is applied to explain the variable timing behavior of PSR B0540-69.\nThe persistent state braking index of PSR B0540-69 is the combined effect of\nmagnetic dipole radiation and particle wind. The particle density reflects the\nmagnetospheric activity in real-time and may be responsible for the changing\nspin-down behavior. Corresponding to the 36 % increase in the spin-down rate of\nPSR B0540-69, the relative increase in the particle density is 88 % in the\nvacuum gap model. And the model calculated braking index in the new state is\nn=1.79. Future braking index observation of PSR B0540-69 in the new spin-down\nstate will be very powerful in distinguishing between different pulsar\nspin-down models and different particle acceleration models in the wind braking\nscenario. The variable timing behavior of PSR J1846-0258 is also understandable\nin the pulsar wind model.\n", "  We introduce a novel procedure for computing the (mu,T)-dependent pressure in\ncontinuum QCD; and therefrom obtain a complex phase diagram and predictions for\nthermal properties of the system, providing the in-medium behaviour of the\ntrace anomaly, speed of sound, latent heat and heat capacity.\n", "  A numerical method to calculate optical conductivity based on a pump-probe\nsetup is presented. Its validity and limits are tested and demonstrated via the\nconcrete numerical simulations on the half-filled one-dimensional extended\nHubbard model both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium. By employing either a\nstep- or a Gaussian-like probing vector potential, it is found that in\nnonequilibrium, the method in the narrow-probe-pulse limit can be identified\nwith variant types of linear response theory, which, in equilibrium, produce\nidentical results. The observation reveals the underlying probe-pulse\ndependence of the optical conductivity calculations in nonequilibrium, which\nmay have its applications in the theoretical analysis of ultrafast spectroscopy\nmeasurements.\n", "  New physics theories often depend on a large number of free parameters. The\nprecise values of those parameters in some cases drastically affect the\nresulting phenomenology of fundamental physics processes, while in others\nfinite variations can leave it basically invariant at the level of detail\nexperimentally accessible. When designing a strategy for the analysis of\nexperimental data in the search for a signal predicted by a new physics model,\nit appears advantageous to categorize the parameter space describing the model\naccording to the corresponding kinematical features of the final state. A\nmulti-dimensional test statistic can be used to gauge the degree of similarity\nin the kinematics of different models; a clustering algorithm using that metric\nmay then allow the division of the space into homogeneous regions, each of\nwhich can be successfully represented by a benchmark point. Searches targeting\nthose benchmark points are then guaranteed to be sensitive to a large area of\nthe parameter space. In this document we show a practical implementation of the\nabove strategy for the study of non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in\nthe context of extensions of the standard model with anomalous couplings of the\nHiggs bosons. A non-standard value of those couplings may significantly enhance\nthe Higgs pair production cross section, such that the process could be\ndetectable with the data that the Large Hadron Collider will collect in Run 2.\n", "  The dynamical evolution of the refractive index of the tensor modes of the\ngeometry produces a specific class of power spectra characterized by a blue\n(i.e. slightly increasing) slope which is directly determined by the\ncompetition of the slow-roll parameter and of the rate of variation of the\nrefractive index. Throughout the conventional stages of the inflationary and\npost-inflationary evolution, the microwave background anisotropies\nmeasurements, the pulsar timing limits and the big-bang nucleosythesis\nconstraints set stringent bounds on the refractive index and on its rate of\nvariation. Within the physically allowed region of the parameter space the\ncosmic background of relic gravitons leads to a potentially large signal for\nthe ground based detectors (in their advanced version) and for the proposed\nspace-borne interferometers. Conversely, the lack of direct detection of the\nsignal will set a qualitatively new bound on the dynamical variation of the\nrefractive index.\n", "  Conformal properties of the topological gravitational terms in $D=2$, $D=4$\nand $D=6$ are discussed. It is shown that in the last two cases the integrands\nof these terms, when being settled into the dimension $D-1$ and multiplied by a\nscalar, become conformal invariant. Furthermore we present a simple covariant\nderivation of the Paneitz operator in $D=4$ and formulate two general\nconjectures concerning the conformal properties of topological structures in\neven dimensions.\n", "  In a series of recent papers Kaloper and Padilla proposed a mechanism to\nsequester standard model vacuum contributions to the cosmological constant. We\nstudy the consequences of embedding their proposal into a fully local quantum\ntheory. In the original work, the bare cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and a\nscaling parameter $\\lambda$ are introduced as global fields. We find that in\nthe local case the resulting Lagrangian is that of a spontaneously broken\nconformal field theory where $\\lambda$ plays the role of the dilaton. A\nvanishing or a small cosmological constant is thus a consequence of the\nunderlying conformal field theory structure.\n", "  We examine whether charged particles injected by self-annihilating Dark\nMatter into regions undergoing Diffuse Shock Acceleration (DSA) can be\naccelerated to high energies. We consider three astrophysical sites where shock\nacceleration is supposed to occur, namely the Galactic Centre, galaxy clusters\nand Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). For the Milky Way, we find that the\nacceleration of cosmic rays injected by dark matter could lead to a bump in the\ncosmic ray spectrum provided that the product of the efficiency of the\nacceleration mechanism and the concentration of DM particles is high enough.\nAmong the various acceleration sources that we consider (namely supernova\nremnants (SNRs), Fermi bubbles and AGN jets), we find that the Fermi bubbles\nare a potentially more efficient accelerator than SNRs. However both could in\nprinciple accelerate electrons and protons injected by dark matter to very high\nenergies. At the extragalactic level, the acceleration of dark matter\nannihilation products could be responsible for enhanced radio emission from\ncolliding clusters and prediction of an increase of the anti-deuteron flux\ngenerated near AGNs.\n", "  We present weak lensing shear catalogues for 139 square degrees of data taken\nduring the Science Verification (SV) time for the new Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam) being used for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe our object\nselection, point spread function estimation and shear measurement procedures\nusing two independent shear pipelines, IM3SHAPE and NGMIX, which produce\ncatalogues of 2.12 million and 3.44 million galaxies respectively. We detail a\nset of null tests for the shear measurements and find that they pass the\nrequirements for systematic errors at the level necessary for weak lensing\nscience applications using the SV data. We also discuss some of the planned\nalgorithmic improvements that will be necessary to produce sufficiently\naccurate shear catalogues for the full 5-year DES, which is expected to cover\n5000 square degrees.\n", "  Intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers are investigated by molecular\ndynamics simulations in free-standing graphene. Discrete breathers are\ngenerated either through thermal quenching of the graphene lattice or by proper\ninitialization, with frequencies and lifetimes sensitively depending on the\ninteratomic potential describing the carbon-carbon interaction. In the most\nrealistic scenario, for which temperature-dependent molecular dynamics\nsimulations in three dimension using a graphene-specific interatomic potential\nare performed, the breather lifetimes increase to hundreds of picoseconds even\nat relatively high temperatures. These lifetimes are much higher than those\nanticipated from earlier calculations, and may enable direct breather\nobservation in Raman spectroscopy experiments.\n", "  We give an estimate of the quantum variance for $d$-regular graphs quantised\nwith boundary scattering matrices that prohibit back-scattering. For families\nof graphs that are expanders, with few short cycles, our estimate leads to\nquantum ergodicity for these families of graphs. Our proof is based on a\nuniform control of an associated random walk on the bonds of the graph. We show\nthat recent constructions of Ramanujan graphs, and asymptotically almost\nsurely, random $d$-regular graphs, satisfy the necessary conditions to conclude\nthat quantum ergodicity holds.\n", "  We introduce a model description of femtosecond laser induced desorption at\nsurfaces. The substrate part of the system is taken into account as a (possibly\nsemi-infinite) linear chain. Here, being especially interested in the early\nstages of dissociation, we consider a finite-size implementation of the model\n(i.e., a finite substrate), for which an exact numerical solution is possible.\nBy time-evolving the many-body wave function, and also using results from a\ntime-dependent density functional theory description for electron-nuclear\nsystems, we analyze the competition between several surface-response mechanisms\nand electronic correlations in the transient and longer time dynamics under the\ninfluence of dipole-coupled fields. Our model allows us to explore how coherent\nmultiple-pulse protocols can impact desorption in a variety of prototypical\nexperiments.\n", "  In Part I of this study, we analyzed the motion of inertial particles in\nisotropic turbulence in the absence of gravity using direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS). Here, in Part II, we introduce gravity and study its effect\nover a wide range of flow Reynolds numbers, Froude numbers, and particle Stokes\nnumbers. We see that gravity causes particles to sample the flow more uniformly\nand reduces the time particles can spend interacting with the underlying\nturbulence. We also find that gravity tends to increase inertial particle\naccelerations, and we introduce a model to explain that effect.\n  We then analyze the particle relative velocities and radial distribution\nfunctions (RDFs), which are generally seen to be independent of Reynolds number\nfor low and moderate Kolmogorov-scale Stokes numbers $St$. We see that gravity\ncauses particle relative velocities to decrease, and that the relative\nvelocities have higher scaling exponents with gravity. We observe that gravity\nhas a non-trivial effect on clustering, acting to decrease clustering at low\n$St$ and to increase clustering at high $St$. By considering the effect of\ngravity on the clustering mechanisms described in the theory of Zaichik &\nAlipchenkov (New J. Phys., 11:103018, 2009), we provide an explanation for this\nnon-trivial effect of gravity. We also show that when the effects of gravity\nare accounted for in the theory of Zaichik & Alipchenkov, the results compare\nfavorably with DNS. The relative velocities and RDFs exhibit considerable\nanisotropy at small separations, and this anisotropy is quantified using\nspherical harmonic functions. We use the relative velocities and the RDFs to\ncompute the particle collision kernels, and find that the collision kernel\nremains as it was for the case without gravity, namely nearly independent of\nReynolds number for low and moderate $St$.\n", "  In this study, we analyze the statistics of both individual inertial\nparticles and inertial particle pairs in direct numerical simulations of\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence in the absence of gravity. The effect of the\nTaylor microscale Reynolds number $R_\\lambda$ on the particle statistics is\nexamined over the largest range to date (from $R_\\lambda = 88-597$). We first\nexplore the effect of preferential sampling on the single-particle statistics,\nand use our understanding of preferential sampling to provide a physical\nexplanation for many of the trends in the particle velocity gradients, kinetic\nenergies, and accelerations at low $St$. As $St$ increases, inertial filtering\neffects become more important, causing the particle kinetic energies and\naccelerations to decrease.\n  We then consider particle-pair statistics, and focus our attention on the\nrelative velocities and radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the particles.\nThe relative velocity statistics indicate that preferential-sampling effects\nare important for $St \\lesssim 0.1$ and that path-history/non-local effects\nbecome increasingly important for $St \\gtrsim 0.2$. The lower-order relative\nvelocity statistics are only weakly sensitive to changes in Reynolds number at\nlow $St$. We find that the RDFs peak near $St$ of order unity, that they\nexhibit power-law scaling for low and intermediate $St$, and that they are\nlargely independent of Reynolds number for low and intermediate $St$. We also\nobserve that at large $St$, changes in the RDF are related to changes the\nscaling exponents of the relative velocity variances. The particle collision\nkernel is found to be largely insensitive to the flow Reynolds number,\nsuggesting that relatively low-Reynolds-number simulations may be able to\ncapture much of the relevant physics of droplet collisions and growth in the\nadiabatic cores of atmospheric clouds.\n", "  We study the dispersion mechanism of Lieb mode excitations of both single and\nmulti component ultra-cold atomic Bose gas, subject to a harmonic confinement\nthrough chirp management. It is shown that in some parameter domain, the\nhole-like excitations lead to the soliton's negative mass regime, arising due\nto the coupling between chirp momentum and Kohn mode. In low momenta region the\ntrap considerably affects the dispersion of the grey soliton, which opens a new\nwindow to observe Lieb-mode excitations. Further, we extend our analysis to\nbinary condensate, which yields usual shape compatible grey-bright soliton\npairs. The inter-species interaction induces a shift in the Lieb-mode\nexcitations, where the pair can form a bound state. We emphasize that the\npresent model provides an opportunity to study such excitations in the low\nmomenta regime, as well as the formation of bound state in binary condensate.\n", "  Electron cloud beam instabilities are an important consideration in virtually\nall high-energy particle accelerators and could pose a formidable challenge to\nforthcoming high-intensity accelerator upgrades. Dedicated tests have shown\nbeampipe coatings dramatically reduce the density of electron cloud in particle\naccelerators. In this work, we evaluate the performance of titanium nitride,\namorphous carbon, and diamond-like carbon as beampipe coatings for the\nmitigation of electron cloud in the Fermilab Main Injector. Altogether our\ntests represent 2700 ampere-hours of proton operation spanning five years.\nThree electron cloud detectors, retarding field analyzers, are installed in a\nstraight section and allow a direct comparison between the electron flux in the\ncoated and uncoated stainless steel beampipe. We characterize the electron flux\nas a function of intensity up to a maximum of 50 trillion protons per cycle.\nEach beampipe material conditions in response to electron bombardment from the\nelectron cloud and we track the changes in these materials as a function of\ntime and the number of absorbed electrons. Contamination from an unexpected\nvacuum leak revealed a potential vulnerability in the amorphous carbon beampipe\ncoating. We measure the energy spectrum of electrons incident on the stainless\nsteel, titanium nitride and amorphous carbon beampipes. We find the electron\ncloud signal is highly sensitive to stray magnetic fields and bunch-length over\nthe Main Injector ramp cycle. We conduct a complete survey of the stray\nmagnetic fields at the test station and compare the electron cloud signal to\nthat in a field-free region.\n", "  We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on the exterior of the toric anti\nde-Sitter Schwarzschild black hole with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary\nconditions at $\\mathcal{I}$. We define a non-degenerate energy for the equation\nwhich controls the renormalised $H^1$ norm of the field. We then establish both\ndecay and integrated decay of this energy through vector field methods. Finally\nwe demonstrate the necessity of `losing a derivative' in the integrated energy\nestimate through the construction of a Gaussian beam staying in the exterior of\nthe event horizon for arbitrary long co-ordinate time.\n", "  We first summarize the characterization of smooth spacelike spherically\nsymmetric constant mean curvature (SS-CMC) hypersurfaces in the Schwarzschild\nspacetime and Kruskal extension. Then use the characterization to prove special\nSS-CMC foliation property, and verify part of the conjecture by Malec and \\'{O}\nMurchadha in their 2003 paper.\n", "  Light can be transmitted through disordered media with high efficiency due to\nthe existence of open channels, but quantitative agreement with theory is\ndifficult to obtain because of the large number of channels to control. By\nmeasuring, by digital holography, the correlations of the transmitted field, we\nare able to determine the number of channels involved in transmission. With\nsample, the number of channels is divided by about 15 with respect to what is\nexpected without sample. This figure is in good agreement with the theoretical\nprediction.\n", "  Quantum repeaters - fundamental building blocks for long-distance quantum\ncommunication - are based on the interaction between photons and quantum\nmemories. The photons must fulfil stringent requirements on central frequency,\nspectral bandwidth and purity in order for this interaction to be efficient. We\npresent a design scheme for monolithically integrated resonant photon-pair\nsources based on parametric down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides, which\nfacilitate the generation of such photons. We investigate the impact of\ndifferent design parameters on the performance of our source. The generated\nphoton spectral bandwidths can be varied between several tens of MHz up to\naround $1\\,$GHz, facilitating an efficient coupling to different memories. The\ncentral frequency of the generated photons can be coarsely tuned by adjusting\nthe pump frequency, poling period and sample temperature and we identify\nstability requirements on the pump laser and sample temperature that can be\nreadily fulfilled with off-the-shelve components. We find that our source is\ncapable of generating high-purity photons over a wide range of photon\nbandwidths. Finally, the PDC emission can be frequency fine-tuned over several\nGHz by simultaneously adjusting the sample temperature and pump frequency. We\nconclude our study with demonstrating the adaptability of our source to\ndifferent quantum memories.\n", "  In this paper, using the same geometrical approach than for the (2R3x2R3)\nR30{\\deg} structure (H. Jamgotchian et al., 2015, Journal of Physics. Condensed\nMatter 27 395002), for the (R13xR13)R13.9{\\deg} type II structure, we propose\nan atomic model of the silicene layer based on a periodic relaxation of the\nstrain epitaxy. This relaxation creates periodic arrangements of perfect areas\nof (R13xR13)R13.9{\\deg} type II structure surrounded by defect areas. A\ndetailed analysis of the main published experimental results, obtained by\nScanning Tunneling Microscopy and by Low Energy Electron Diffraction, shows a\ngood agreement with the geometrical model.\n", "  We demonstrate that exceptional field theory is a truncation of the\nnon-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and its first\nfundamental as proposed in 2003. Evaluating the simple equations of the E11\napproach, and using the commutators of the E11 algebra, we find the equations\nof exceptional field theory after making a radical truncation. This procedure\ndoes not respect any of the higher level E11 symmetries and so these are lost.\nWe suggest that the need for the section condition in exceptional field theory\ncould be a consequence of the truncation.\n", "  We study s-wave superconductivity in the two dimensional attractive Hubbard\nmodel in an applied magnetic field, assume the extreme Pauli limit, and examine\nthe role of spatial fluctuations in the coupling regime corresponding to\nBCS-BEC crossover. We use a decomposition of the interaction in terms of an\nauxiliary pairing field, retain the static mode, and sample the pairing field\nvia Monte Carlo. The method requires iterative solution of the\nBogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equations for amplitude and phase fluctuating\nconfigurations of the pairing field. We establish the full thermal phase\ndiagram of this strong coupling problem, revealing $T_c$ scales an order of\nmagnitude below the mean field estimate, highlight the spontaneous\ninhomogeneity in the field induced magnetization, and discover a strong non\nmonotonicity in the temperature dependence of the low energy density of states.\nWe compare our results to the experimental phase diagram of the imbalanced\nFermi gas at unitarity. This paper focuses on the magnetized but homogeneous\n(breached pair) superconducting state, a companion paper deals with the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) regime.\n", "  The binding energy and the corresponding wave function of excitons in\nGaAs-based finite square quantum wells (QWs) are calculated by the direct\nnumerical solution of the three-dimensional Schroedinger equation. The precise\nresults for the lowest exciton state are obtained by the Hamiltonian\ndiscretization using the high-order finite-difference scheme. The microscopic\ncalculations are compared with the results obtained by the standard variational\napproach. The exciton binding energies found by two methods coincide within 0.1\nmeV for the wide range of QW widths. The radiative decay rate is calculated for\nQWs of various widths using the exciton wave functions obtained by direct and\nvariational methods. The radiative decay rates are confronted with the\nexperimental data measured for high-quality GaAs/AlGaAs and InGaAs/GaAs QW\nheterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The calculated and measured\nvalues are in good agreement, though slight differences with earlier\ncalculations of the radiative decay rate are observed.\n", "  In the frame of the Landau-Ginzburg formalism we propose a minimal\nphenomenological model for a morphological transformation in viral capsid\nshells. The transformation takes place during virus maturation process which\nrenders virus infectious. The theory is illustrated on the example of the HK97\nbacteriophage and viruses with similar morphological changes in the protective\nprotein shell. The transformation is shown to be a structural phase transition\ndriven by two order parameters. The first order parameter describes the\nisotropic expansion of the protein shell while the second one is responsible\nfor the shape symmetry breaking and the resulting shell faceting. The group\ntheory analysis and the resulting thermodynamic model make it possible to\nchoose the parameter which discriminates between the icosahedral shell faceting\noften observed in viral capsids and the dodecahedral one observed in viruses of\nthe Parvovirus family. Calculated phase diagram illustrates the discontinuous\ncharacter of the virus morphological transformation and shows two qualitatively\ndifferent paths of the transformation in a function of two main external\nthermodynamic parameters of the in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n", "  In quantum information theory, Fisher Information is a natural metric on the\nspace of perturbations to a density matrix, defined by calculating the relative\nentropy with the unperturbed state at quadratic order in perturbations. In\ngravitational physics, Canonical Energy defines a natural metric on the space\nof perturbations to spacetimes with a Killing horizon. In this paper, we show\nthat the Fisher information metric for perturbations to the vacuum density\nmatrix of a ball-shaped region B in a holographic CFT is dual to the canonical\nenergy metric for perturbations to a corresponding Rindler wedge R_B of\nAnti-de-Sitter space. Positivity of relative entropy at second order implies\nthat the Fisher information metric is positive definite. Thus, for physical\nperturbations to anti-de-Sitter spacetime, the canonical energy associated to\nany Rindler wedge must be positive. This second-order constraint on the metric\nextends the first order result from relative entropy positivity that physical\nperturbations must satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations.\n", "  The orbital magnetic moment of a finite piece of matter is expressed in terms\nof the one-body density matrix as a simple trace. We address a macroscopic\nsystem, insulating in the bulk, and we show that its orbital moment is the sum\nof a bulk term and a surface term, both extensive. The latter only occurs when\nthe transverse conductivity is nonzero and owes to conducting surface states.\nSimulations on a model Hamiltonian validate our theory.\n", "  It is shown how quantum fluctuations of the radiation during the contraction\nera of a CBE (Comes Back Empty) cyclic cosmology can provide density\nfluctuations which re-enter the horizon during the subsequent expansion era and\nat lowest order are scale invariant, in a Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles sense, as\nnecessary to be consistent with observations of large scale structure.\n", "  The observation of extensive fractional quantum Hall states in graphene\nbrings out the possibility of more accurate quantitative comparisons between\ntheory and experiment than previously possible, because of the negligibility of\nfinite width corrections. We obtain accurate phase diagram for differently\nspin-polarized fractional quantum Hall states, and also estimate the effect of\nLandau level mixing using the modified interaction pseudopotentials given in\nthe literature. We find that the observed phase diagram is in good quantitative\nagreement with theory that neglects Landau level mixing, but the agreement\nbecomes significantly worse when Landau level mixing is incorporated assuming\nthat the corrections to the energies are linear in the Landau level mixing\nparameter $\\lambda$. This implies that a first order perturbation theory in\n$\\lambda$ is inadequate for the current experimental systems, for which\n$\\lambda$ is typically on the order of or greater than one. We also test the\naccuracy of the composite-fermion theory and find that all lowest Landau level\nprojection methods used in the literature are very accurate for the states of\nthe form $n/(2n+1)$ but for the states at $n/(2n-1)$ the results are more\nsensitive to the projection method. An earlier prediction of an absence of spin\ntransitions for the $n/(4n+1)$ states is confirmed by more rigorous\ncalculations, and new predictions are made regarding spin physics for the\n$n/(4n-1)$ states.\n", "  The relational framework of canonical quantum gravity with non-ultralocal\nconstraints is explored. After demonstrating the absence of anomalies, a\nspatially discretized version of the relational framework is introduced. This\nallows the application of Lieb-Robinson bounds to on-shell monotonic gauge-flow\nwhen there is a continuous external \"time\" parameter. An explicit Lieb-Robinson\nbound is derived for the differential on-shell evolution of the operator norm\nof the commutator of discretized Dirac observables, demonstrating how a local\nlight cone-like causal structure emerges. Ultra-local constraints do not permit\nsuch a structure to arise via Lieb-Robinson bounds. Gauge and (3+1)-diff\ninvariance of the light-cone is discussed along with the issues of quantum\nfluctuations, the nature of the non-localities, the spatial continuum limit,\nand possible links to non-commutative geometry.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a new read-out technique for a superconducting\nqubit by dispersively coupling it to a Josephson parametric oscillator. We\nemploy a tunable quarter-wavelength superconducting resonator and modulate its\nresonant frequency at twice its value with an amplitude surpassing the\nthreshold for parametric instability. We map the qubit states onto two distinct\nstates of classical parametric oscillation: one oscillating state, with\n$185\\pm15$ photons in the resonator, and one with zero oscillation amplitude.\nThis high contrast obviates a following quantum-limited amplifier. We\ndemonstrate proof-of-principle, single-shot readout performance, and present an\nerror budget indicating that this method can surpass the fidelity threshold\nrequired for quantum computing.\n", "  We study the electronic structure and correlations of vitamin B12\n(cyanocobalamine) by using the framework of the multi-orbital single-impurity\nHaldane-Anderson model of a transition-metal impurity in a semiconductor host.\nThe parameters of the effective Haldane-Anderson model are obtained within the\nHartree-Fock (HF) approximation. The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique is\nthen used to calculate the one-electron and magnetic correlation functions of\nthis effective model. We observe that new states form inside the semiconductor\ngap found by HF due to the intra-orbital Coulomb interaction at the impurity 3d\norbitals. In particular, the lowest unoccupied states correspond to an impurity\nbound state, which consists of states from mainly the CN axial ligand and the\ncorring ring as well as the Co e_g-like orbitals. We also observe that the\nCo(3d) orbitals can develop antiferromagnetic correlations with the surrounding\natoms depending on the filling of the impurity bound states. In addition, we\nmake comparisons of the HF+QMC data with the density functional theory\ncalculations. We also discuss the photoabsorption spectrum of cyanocobalamine.\n", "  We show that the Kepler problem is projectively equivalent to null geodesic\nmotion on the conformal compactification of Minkowski-4 space. This space\nrealises the conformal triality of Minkwoski, dS and AdS spaces.\n", "  The two-particle short-range correlation functions in rapidity, azimuthal\nangle and transverse momentum, following from the decay of statistical clusters\nare evaluated and discussed.\n", "  We consider a short Josephson junction with a phase discontinuity $\\kappa$\ncreated, e.g., by a pair of tiny current injectors, at some point $x_0$ along\nthe length of the junction. We derive the effective current-phase relation\n(CPR) for the system as a whole, i.e., reduce it to an effective point-like\njunction. From the effective CPR we obtain the ground state of the system and\npredict the dependence of its critical current on $\\kappa$. We show that in a\nlarge range of $\\kappa$ values the effective junction behaves as a $\\varphi_0$\nJosephson junction, i.e., has a unique ground state phase $\\varphi_0$ within\neach $2\\pi$ interval. For $\\kappa\\approx\\pi$ and $x_0$ near the middle of the\njunction one obtains a $\\varphi_0\\pm\\varphi$ junction, i.e., the Josephson\njunction with degenerate ground state phase $\\varphi_0\\pm\\varphi$ within each\n$2\\pi$ interval. Further, in view of possible escape experiments especially in\nthe quantum domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy barrier and\neigenfrequency close to the critical currents and predict the behavior of the\nescape histogram width $\\sigma(\\kappa)$ in the regime of the macroscopic\nquantum tunneling.\n", "  We realized a quantum geometric \"charge\" pump for a Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) in the lowest Bloch band of a novel bipartite magnetic lattice.\nTopological charge pumps in filled bands yield quantized pumping set by the\nglobal -- topological -- properties of the bands. In contrast, our geometric\ncharge pump for a BEC occupying just a single crystal momentum state exhibits\nnon-quantized charge pumping set by local -- geometrical -- properties of the\nband structure. Like topological charge pumps, for each pump cycle we observed\nan overall displacement (here, not quantized) and a temporal modulation of the\natomic wavepacket's position in each unit cell, i.e., the polarization.\n", "  We study the effect of high population imbalance in the two dimensional\nattractive Hubbard model, in the coupling regime corresponding to BCS-BEC\ncrossover, and focus on thermal effects on the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO) state. Using a method that retains all the classical thermal\nfluctuations on the FFLO state we estimate a very low $T_c$ and infer a\nstrongly first order normal state to FFLO transition. The $T_c$ is an order of\nmagnitude below the mean field estimate. We track the fermionic momentum\ndistribution, the density of states, and the pairing structure factor deep into\nthe normal state. The pairing structure factor retains weak signature of finite\nmomentum pairing to a high temperature despite the low $T_c$ itself, while the\nspin resolved density of states changes from the `pseudogapped' FFLO character\nto gapless and pseudogapped again with increasing temperature. These results\nmap out the rather narrow temperature window, and diverse physical indicators,\nrelevant to FFLO states on a cold atom optical lattice, and complements our\nwork on the lower field `breached pair' state.\n", "  We have exploited ALMA calibration observations to carry out a novel, wide\nand deep submm survey, ALMACAL. These calibration data comprise a large number\nof observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and array\nconfigurations. Gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to many\nALMA calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow the\ndetection of faint dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) over a significant\narea. In this paper we outline our survey strategy and report the first\nresults. We have analysed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of $\\sim 25\n\\, {\\rm \\mu Jy \\, beam^{-1}}$ at sub-arcsec resolution. Adopting a conservative\napproach based on $\\geq 5 \\sigma$ detections, we have found eight and 11 DSFGs\nin ALMA bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities $S_{\\rm 1.2 mm} \\geq\n0.2 \\, {\\rm mJy}$. The faintest galaxies would have been missed by even the\ndeepest \\emph{Herschel} surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been\ndetermined independently at 870 $\\mu$m and 1.2 mm, from a sparse sampling of\nthe astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The\ncounts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least $2\\times$.\nFuture analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs, with redshifts\ndetermined via detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then\nallows morphological studies of very faint DSFGs - representative of more\nnormal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies (SMGs) - in\nfields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatial\nresolution.\n", "  The $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is the dominant neutron source\nfor the slow neutron capture process ($s$-process) in massive stars and\ncontributes, together with the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O, to the production\nof neutrons for the $s$-process in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars.\nHowever, the reaction is endothermic and competes directly with the\n$^{22}$Ne($\\alpha,\\gamma)^{26}$Mg radiative capture. The uncertainties for both\nreactions are large owing to the uncertainty in the level structure of\n$^{26}$Mg near the alpha and neutron separation energies. These uncertainties\nare affecting the s-process nucleosynthesis calculations in theoretical stellar\nmodels. Indirect studies in the past have been successful in determining the\nenergies, $\\gamma$-ray and neutron widths of the $^{26}$Mg states in the energy\nregion of interest. But, the high Coulomb barrier hinders a direct measurement\nof the resonance strengths, which are determined by the $\\alpha$-widths for\nthese states. The goal of the present experiments is to identify the critical\nresonance states and to precisely measure the $\\alpha$-widths by $\\alpha$\ntransfer techniques . Hence, the $\\alpha$-inelastic scattering and\n$\\alpha$-transfer measurements were performed on a solid $^{26}$Mg target and a\n$^{22}$Ne gas target, respectively, using the Grand Raiden Spectrometer at\nRCNP, Osaka, Japan. Six levels (E$_x$ = 10717 keV , 10822 keV, 10951 keV, 11085\nkeV, 11167 keV and 11317 keV) have been observed above the $\\alpha$-threshold\nin the region of interest (10.61 - 11.32 MeV). The rates are dominated in both\nreaction channels by the resonance contributions of the states at E$_x$ =\n10951, 11167 and 11317 keV. The E$_x$ =11167 keV has the most appreciable\nimpact on the ($\\alpha,\\gamma$) rate and therefore plays an important role for\nthe prediction of the neutron production in s-process environments.\n", "  The academic research into entanglement nicely illustrates the interplay\nbetween fundamental science and applications, and the need to foster both\naspects to advance either one. For instance, the possibility to distribute\nentangled photons over tens or even hundreds of kilometers is fascinating\nbecause it confirms the quantum predictions over large distances, while quantum\ntheory is often presented to apply to the very small (see Figure 1). On the\nother hand, entanglement enables quantum key distribution (QKD) [1]. This most\nadvanced application of quantum information processing allows one to distribute\ncryptographic keys in a provably secure manner. For this, one merely has to\nmeasure the two halves of an entangled pair of photons. Surprisingly, and being\nof both fundamental and practical interest, the use of entanglement removes\neven the necessity for trusting most equipment used for the measurements [5].\nFurthermore, entanglement serves as a resource for quantum teleportation (see\nFigure 2) [1]. In turn, this provides a tool for extending quantum key\ndistribution to arbitrarily large distances and building large-scale networks\nthat connect future quantum computers and atomic clocks [6]. In the following,\nwe describe the counter-intuitive properties of entangled particles as well as\na few recent experiments that address fundamental and applied aspects of\nquantum teleportation. While a lot of work is being done using different\nquantum systems, including trapped ions, color centers in diamond, quantum\ndots, and superconducting circuits, we will restrict ourselves to experiments\ninvolving photons due to their suitability for building future quantum\nnetworks.\n", "  We study effects of fluctuations on the mesoscopic length-scale on systems\nwith mesoscopic inhomogeneities. Equations for the correlation function and for\nthe average volume fraction are derived in the self-consistent Gaussian\napproximation. The equations are further simplified by postulating the\nexpression for the structure factor consistent with scattering experiments for\nself-assembling systems. Predictions of the approximate theory are verified by\na comparison with the exact results obtained earlier for the one-dimensional\nlattice model with first-neighbour attraction and third-neighbour repulsion. We\nfind qualitative agreement for the correlation function, the equation of state\nand the dependence of the chemical potential $\\mu$ on the volume fraction\n$\\zeta$. Our results confirm also that strong inhomogeneities in the disordered\nphase are found only in the case of strong repulsion. The inhomogeneities are\nreflected in an oscillatory decay of the correlation function with a very large\ncorrelation length, three inflection points in the $\\mu(\\zeta)$ curve and a\ncompressibility that for increasing $\\zeta$ takes very large, very small and\nagain very large values.\n", "  Cell motility and tissue morphogenesis depend crucially on the dynamic\nremodelling of actomyosin networks. An actomyosin network consists of an actin\npolymer network connected by crosslinker proteins and motor protein myosins\nthat generate internal stresses on the network. A recent discovery shows that\nfor a range of experimental parameters, actomyosin networks contract to\nclusters with a power-law size distribution [Alvarado J. et al. (2013) Nature\nPhysics 9 591]. Here, we argue that actomyosin networks can exhibit robust\ncritical signature without fine-tuning because the dynamics of the system can\nbe mapped onto a modified version of percolation with trapping (PT), which is\nknown to show critical behaviour belonging to the static percolation\nuniversality class without the need of fine-tuning of a control parameter. We\nfurther employ our PT model to generate experimentally testable predictions.\n", "  The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by\nthe coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states\nin one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin\nparameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with\nquasi-energy $E=0,\\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different\nboundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary\nconditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be\ncomputed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes\nare provided.\n", "  The minimum weight states of the Lipkin model consisting of n single-particle\nlevels and obeying the su(n)-algebra are investigated systematically. The basic\nidea is to use the su(2)-algebra which is independent of the su(n)-algebra.\nThis idea has been already presented by the present authors in the case of the\nconventional Lipkin model consisting of two single-particle levels and obeying\nthe su(2)-algebra. If following this idea, the minimum weight states are\ndetermined for any fermion number occupying appropriately n single-particle\nlevels. Naturally, the conventional minimum weight state is included: all\nfermions occupy energetically the lowest single-particle level in the absence\nof interaction. The cases n=2, 3, 4 and 5 are discussed in rather detail.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the 4d path integral for Euclidean quantum\ngravity on a hypercubic lattice, as given by the Spin Foam model by Engle,\nPereira, Rovelli, Livine, Freidel and Krasnov (EPRL-FK). To tackle the problem,\nwe restrict to a set of quantum geometries that reflects the large amount of\nlattice symmetries. In particular, the sum over intertwiners is restricted to\nquantum cuboids, i.e. coherent intertwiners which describe a cuboidal geometry\nin the large-$j$ limit.\n  Using asymptotic expressions for the vertex amplitude, we find several\ninteresting properties of the state sum. First of all, the value of coupling\nconstants in the amplitude functions determines whether geometric or\nnon-geometric configurations dominate the path integral. Secondly, there is a\ncritical value of the coupling constant $\\alpha$, which separates two phases.\nIn both phases, the diffeomorphism symmetry appears to be broken. In one, the\ndominant contribution comes from highly irregular, in the other from highly\nregular configurations, both describing flat Euclidean space with small quantum\nfluctuations around them, viewed in different coordinate systems. On the\ncritical point diffeomorphism symmetry is nearly restored, however.\n  Thirdly, we use the state sum to compute the physical norm of kinematical\nstates, i.e. their norm in the physical Hilbert space. We find that states\nwhich describe boundary geometry with high torsion have exponentially\nsuppressed physical norm. We argue that this allows one to exclude them from\nthe state sum in calculations.\n", "  By using evolutionary algorithm USPEX, we have predicted a number of stable\nzirconium carbides. In addition to the well-known rocksalt-type stoichiometric\nZrC (Fm-3m), present prediction also identifies five stable substoichiometric\nzirconium carbides adopting rocksalt-type structures with ordered carbon\nvacancies, Zr8C7 (P-1), Zr6C5 (C2/m), Zr5C4 (P-1), Zr3C2 (C2/m), and Zr2C\n(Fd-3m). The effects of carbon vacancies on structural and mechanical\nproperties are investigated. We highlight that the distribution of carbon\nvacancies has significant influence on volume, Pugh's ratio, and hardness. We\nfurther propose that hardness can be enhanced by replacing carbon vacancies\nwith suitable elements, in particular nitrogen and oxygen.\n", "  We use subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) to model the stellar mass function\n(SMF) and clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)\n\"CMASS\" sample at $z\\sim0.5$. We introduce a novel method which accounts for\nthe stellar mass incompleteness of CMASS as a function of redshift, and produce\nCMASS mock catalogs which include selection effects, reproduce the overall SMF,\nthe projected two-point correlation function $w_{\\rm p}$, the CMASS $dn/dz$,\nand are made publicly available. We study the effects of assembly bias above\ncollapse mass in the context of \"age matching\" and show that these effects are\nmarkedly different compared to the ones explored by Hearin et al. (2013) at\nlower stellar masses. We construct two models, one in which galaxy color is\nstochastic (\"AbM\" model) as well as a model which contains assembly bias\neffects (\"AgM\" model). By confronting the redshift dependent clustering of\nCMASS with the predictions from our model, we argue that that galaxy colors are\nnot a stochastic process in high-mass halos. Our results suggest that the\ncolors of galaxies in high-mass halos are determined by other halo properties\nbesides halo peak velocity and that assembly bias effects play an important\nrole in determining the clustering properties of this sample.\n", "  The equations of anomalous magnetohydrodynamics describe an Abelian plasma\nwhere conduction and chiral currents are simultaneously present and constrained\nby the second law of thermodynamics. At high frequencies the magnetic currents\nplay the leading role and the spectrum is dominated by two-fluid effects. The\nsystem behaves instead as a single fluid in the low-frequency regime where the\nvortical currents induce potentially large hypermagnetic fields. After deriving\nthe physical solutions of the generalized Appleton-Hartree equation, the\ncorresponding dispersion relations are scrutinized and compared with the\nresults valid for cold plasmas. Hypermagnetic knots and fluid vortices can be\nconcurrently present at very low frequencies and suggest a qualitatively\ndifferent dynamics of the hydromagnetic nonlinearities.\n", "  We present the discovery by the WASP-South survey of three planets transiting\nmoderately bright stars (V ~ 11). WASP-120b is a massive (5.0MJup) planet in a\n3.6-day orbit that we find likely to be eccentric (e = 0.059+0.025-0.018)\naround an F5 star. WASP-122b is a hot-Jupiter (1.37MJup, 1.79RJup) in a 1.7-day\norbit about a G4 star. Our predicted transit depth variation cause by the\natmosphere of WASP-122b suggests it is well suited to characterisation.\nWASP-123b is a hot-Jupiter (0.92MJup, 1.33RJup) in a 3.0-day orbit around an\nold (~ 7 Gyr) G5 star.\n", "  In this work we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of the AMS-02\nelectron, positron fluxes and the antiproton-to-proton ratio in the context of\na simplified dark matter model. We include known, standard astrophysical\nsources and a dark matter component in the cosmic ray injection spectra. To\npredict the AMS-02 observables we use propagation parameters extracted from\nobserved fluxes of heavier nuclei and the low energy part of the AMS-02 data.\nWe assume that the dark matter particle is a Majorana fermion coupling to third\ngeneration fermions via a spin-0 mediator, and annihilating to multiple\nchannels at once. The simultaneous presence of various annihilation channels\nprovides the dark matter model with additional flexibility, and this enables us\nto simultaneously fit all cosmic ray spectra using a simple particle physics\nmodel and coherent astrophysical assumptions. Our results indicate that AMS-02\nobservations are not only consistent with the dark matter hypothesis within the\nuncertainties, but adding a dark matter contribution improves the fit to the\ndata. Assuming, however, that dark matter is solely responsible for this\nimprovement of the fit, it is difficult to evade the latest CMB limits in this\nmodel.\n", "  Motivated by various problems in physics and applied mathematics, we look for\nconstraints and properties of real Fourier-positive functions, i.e. with\npositive Fourier transforms. Properties of the \"Dirac comb\" distribution and of\nits tensor products in higher dimensions lead to Poisson resummation, allowing\nfor a useful approximation formula of a Fourier transform in terms of a limited\nnumber of terms. A connection with the Bochner theorem on positive definiteness\nof Fourier-positive functions is discussed. As a practical application, we find\nsimple and rapid analytic algorithms for checking Fourier-positivity in 1- and\n(radial) 2-dimensions among a large variety of real positive functions. This\nmay provide a step towards a classification of positive positive-definite\nfunctions.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving reactive potentials can be used\nto model material failure. The empirical potentials which are used in such\nsimulations are able to adapt to the atomic environment, at the expense of a\nsignificantly higher computational cost than non-reactive potentials. However,\nduring a simulation of failure, the reactive ability is needed only in some\nlimited parts of the system, where bonds break or form and the atomic\nenvironment changes. Therefore, simpler non-reactive potentials can be used in\nthe remainder of the system, provided that such potentials reproduce correctly\nthe behavior of the reactive potentials in this region, and that seamless\ncoupling is ensured at the interface between the reactive and non-reactive\nregions. In this article, we propose a methodology to combine a reactive\npotential with a non-reactive approximation thereof, made of a set of harmonic\npair and angle interactions and whose parameters are adjusted to predict the\nsame energy, geometry and Hessian in the ground state of the potential. We\npresent a methodology to construct the non-reactive approximation of the\nreactive potential, and a way to couple these two potentials. We also propose a\ncriterion for on-the-fly substitution of the reactive potential by its\nnon-reactive approximation during a simulation. We illustrate the correctness\nof this hybrid technique for the case of MD simulation of failure in\ntwo-dimensional graphene originally modeled with REBO potential.\n", "  Owing to the recent, rapid development of computer technology, the resolution\nof atmospheric numerical models has increased substantially. With the use of\nnext-generation supercomputers, atmospheric simulations using horizontal grid\nintervals of O(100) m or less will gain popularity. At such high resolution\nmore of the steep gradients in mountainous terrain will be resolved, which may\nresult in large truncation errors in those models using terrain-following\ncoordinates. In this study, a new 3D Cartesian coordinate non-hydrostatic\natmospheric model is developed. A cut-cell representation of topography based\non finite-volume discretization is combined with a cell-merging approach, in\nwhich small cut-cells are merged with neighboring cells either vertically or\nhorizontally. In addition, a block-structured mesh-refinement technique is\nintroduced to achieve a variable resolution on the model grid with the finest\nresolution occurring close to the terrain surface. The model successfully\nreproduces a flow over a 3D bell-shaped hill that shows a good agreement with\nthe flow predicted by the linear theory. The ability of the model to simulate\nflows over steep terrain is demonstrated using a hemisphere-shaped hill where\nthe maximum slope angle is resolved at 71 degrees. The advantage of a locally\nrefined grid around a 3D hill, with cut-cells at the terrain surface, is also\ndemonstrated using the hemisphere-shaped hill. The model reproduces smooth\nmountain waves propagating over varying grid resolution without introducing\nlarge errors associated with the change of mesh resolution. At the same time,\nthe model shows a good scalability on a locally refined grid with the use of\nOpenMP.\n", "  We assess the predictive accuracy of perturbation theory based estimates of\nchanges in covalent bonding due to linear alchemical interpolations among\nmolecules. We have investigated $\\sigma$ bonding to hydrogen, as well as\n$\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ bonding between main-group elements, occurring in small sets\nof iso-valence-electronic molecular species with elements drawn from second to\nfourth rows in the $p$-block of the periodic table. Numerical evidence suggests\nthat first order estimates of covalent bonding potentials can achieve chemical\naccuracy if (i) the alchemical interpolation is vertical (fixed geometry), (ii)\ninvolves molecules containing elements in the third and fourth row of the\nperiodic table, and (iii) a reference geometry is optimized. In this case,\nchanges in the bonding potential become near-linear in coupling parameter,\nresulting in analytical predictions with very high accuracy ($\\sim$1 kcal/mol).\nSecond order estimates deteriorate the prediction. If initial and final\nmolecules differ not only in composition but also in geometry, all estimates\nbecome substantially worse, with second order being slightly more accurate than\nfirst order. The independent particle approximation to the second order\nperturbation performs poorly when compared to the coupled perturbed or finite\ndifference approach. Taylor series expansions up to fourth order of the\npotential energy curve of highly symmetric systems indicate a finite radius of\nconvergence, as illustrated for the alchemical stretching of H$_2^+$. Numerical\nresults are presented for covalent bonds to hydrogen in 12 molecules with 8\nvalence electrons; (ii) main-group single bonds in 9 molecules with 14 valence\nelectrons; (iii) main-group double bonds in 9 molecules with 12 valence\nelectrons; (iv) main-group triple bonds in 9 molecules with 10 valence\nelectrons; (v) H$_2^+$ single bond with 1 electron.\n", "  The ground state energy of hydrogen molecular ion H2+ confined by a hard\nprolate spheroidal cavity is calculated. The case in which the nuclear\npositions are clamped at the foci is considered. Our calculations are based on\nusing the variational Monte Carlo method with an accurate trial wave function\ndepending on many variational parameters. The calculations were extended also\nto include the HeH++ molecular ion. The obtained results are in good agreement\nwith the recent results.\n", "  The generation and storage of entangled photons play important roles in\nquantum information technique. Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) in atomic\nensembles provides a promising method to generate entangled photons capable of\nstorage. In the past experiments, a spin-wave-photon entangled state is\nproduced via SRS in an atomic ensemble, with which a pair of entangled photons\nis obtained. Here, we report a scheme of simultaneously generating two\nspin-wave-photon entangled states in an atomic ensemble by collecting Stokes\nphotons at two different directions. Based on the obtained two atom-photon\nentangled sources, we generate a three-photon GHZ polarization-entangled state\nand conditionally prepare a polarization-entangled photon pair, respectively.\n", "  In genetic circuits, when the mRNA lifetime is short compared to the cell\ncycle, proteins are produced in geometrically-distributed bursts, which greatly\naffects the cellular switching dynamics between different metastable phenotypic\nstates. Motivated by this scenario, we study a general problem of switching or\nescape in stochastic populations, where influx of particles occurs in groups or\nbursts, sampled from an arbitrary distribution. The fact that the step size of\nthe influx reaction is a-priori unknown, and in general, may fluctuate in time\nwith a given correlation time and statistics, introduces an additional\nnon-demographic step-size noise into the system. Employing the probability\ngenerating function technique in conjunction with Hamiltonian formulation, we\nare able to map the problem in the leading order onto solving a stationary\nHamilton-Jacobi equation. We show that bursty influx exponentially decreases\nthe mean escape time compared to the \"usual case\" of single-step influx. In\nparticular, close to bifurcation we find a simple analytical expression for the\nmean escape time, which solely depends on the mean and variance of the\nburst-size distribution. Our results are demonstrated on several realistic\ndistributions and compare well with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  We study the LHC searches for the heavy $CP$-odd Higgs boson $A$ and\n$CP$-even Higgs boson $H$ in the context of general two-Higgs-doublet model.\nSpecifically, we consider the decay mode of $A/H\\to t \\bar t $ through the $b\n\\bar b$ or $t \\bar t $ associated production channels. In the so-called\n\"alignment limit\" of the two-Higgs-doublet model, this decay mode can be the\nmost dominant one. By employing the HEPTopTagger and the\nmulti-variable-analysis method, we present the search sensitivities for both\n$CP$-odd Higgs boson $A$ and $CP$-even Higgs boson $H$ via these channels at\nthe high-luminosity LHC runs.\n", "  Lorentz covariant and gauge invariant definitions of quark and gluon spin and\norbital angular momenta continue to pose a great theoretical challenge. A major\ncontroversy on the fundamental concepts followed Chen et al proposal: the basic\nidea is to split the gauge potential into pure gauge and physical components\nmotivated by the gauge symmetry. We term it gauge symmetry paradigm (GSP) to\ndistinguish it from the well-known inertial frame dependent\ntransverse-longitudinal decomposition (TLP). A thorough study adhering to the\ntraditional meaning of Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance is reported; it\nleads to a new result: logically consistent development of GSP does not exist\nand Chen et al proposal turns out to be either trivial or metamorphosed into\nTLP. Going beyond the controversy and the spin sum rules the necessity for a\nnonperurbative QCD approach to address the proton spin problem is underlined.\nWe suggest topological approach: generalized de Rham theorems for QCD, and spin\nas a topological invariant for baryons are discussed. Nonabelian Stokes theorem\nis applied to derive color flux for the closed loop in a variant of Burkardt's\nU-shaped path. Similarity between Chen et al decomposition and Kondo\ndecomposition of the gauge potential is suggestive of a topological perspective\non the Chen et al proposal with interesting physics\n", "  We discuss the known construction of two interacting superconducting\ncircuits, based on Josephson junctions, that can be precisely engineered and\neasily controlled. In particular, we use the parametric excitation of two\ncircuits, realized by an instant change of the qubit coupling, to study\nentropic and information properties of the density matrix of the composite\nsystem. The density matrix is obtained from the initial thermal state and is\nthen analyzed in the approximation of small perturbation parameter and\nsufficiently low temperature. We also check the subadditivity condition for\nthis system both for von Neumann and deformed entropies and look at the\ndependance of mutual information on the temperature of the system. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applicability of this approach to describe such system of two\ncoupled superconducting qubits as harmonic oscillators with limited Hilbert\nspace.\n", "  Using the WKB approximation we analyse the tunnelling of a pulsating string\nin deformed Minkowski spacetime.\n", "  We reconsider the Gram-Hadamard bound as it is used in constructive quantum\nfield theory and many body physics to prove convergence of Fermionic\nperturbative expansions. Our approach uses a recursion for the amplitudes of\nthe expansion, discovered originally by Djokic arXiv:1312.1185. It explains the\nstandard way to bound the expansion from a new point of view, and for some of\nthe amplitudes provides new bounds, which avoid the use of Fourier transform,\nand are therefore superior to the standard bounds for models like the cold\ninteracting Fermi gas.\n", "  Here, we report the observation of electron transfer mediated decay (ETMD)\ninvolving Mg clusters embedded in helium nanodroplets which is initiated by the\nionization of helium followed by removal of two electrons from the Mg clusters\nof which one is transferred to the He environment neutralizing it while the\nother electron is emitted into the continuum. The process is shown to be the\ndominant ionization mechanism for embedded clusters for photon energies above\nthe ionization potential of He. The photoelectron spectrum reveals a low energy\nETMD peak. For Mg clusters larger than 5 atoms we observe stable doubly-ionized\nclusters. We argue that ETMD provides a new pathway to the formation of\ndoubly-ionized cold species.\n", "  Ensembles of climate models are commonly used to improve climate predictions\nand assess the uncertainties associated with them. Weighting the models\naccording to their performances holds the promise of further improving their\npredictions. Here, we use an ensemble of decadal climate predictions to\ndemonstrate the ability of sequential learning algorithms (SLAs) to reduce the\nforecast errors and reduce the uncertainties. Three different SLAs are\nconsidered, and their performances are compared with those of an equally\nweighted ensemble, a linear regression and the climatology. Predictions of four\ndifferent variables--the surface temperature, the zonal and meridional wind,\nand pressure--are considered. The spatial distributions of the performances are\npresented, and the statistical significance of the improvements achieved by the\nSLAs is tested. Based on the performances of the SLAs, we propose one to be\nhighly suitable for the improvement of decadal climate predictions.\n", "  We review results from our monitoring observations of several lensed quasars\nperformed in the optical, UV, and X-ray bands. Modeling of the multi-wavelength\nlight curves provides constraints on the extent of the optical, UV, and X-ray\nemission regions. One of the important results of our analysis is that the\noptical sizes as inferred from the microlensing analysis are significantly\nlarger than those predicted by the theoretical-thin-disk estimate. In a few\ncases we also constrain the slope of the size-wavelength relation. Our size\nconstraints of the soft and hard X-ray emission regions of quasars indicate\nthat in some objects of our sample the hard X-ray emission region is more\ncompact than the soft and in others the soft emission region is smaller. This\ndifference may be the result of the relative strengths of the disk-reflected\n(harder and extended) versus corona-direct (softer and compact) components in\nthe quasars of our sample. Finally, we present the analysis of several strong\nmicrolensing events where we detect an evolution of the relativistic Fe line\nprofile as the magnification caustic traverses the accretion disk. These\ncaustic crossings are used to provide constraints on the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) radius and the accretion disk inclination angle of the\nblack hole in quasar RX J1131-1231.\n", "  Few comments upon Ali and Khalil's paper are pointed out. Their modified\nSchwarzschild metric seems not to be new as it has the same structure as Eq.\n(2.6) from Ref.4. Their black hole temperature $T$ and heat capacity $C$\ncorrespond exactly to the Reissner-Nordtstrom values, with $\\hbar \\eta$ instead\nof $Q^{2}$. The expression for the black hole entropy turns out to be erronous\nand does not fit with the other authors' calculations. Moreover, a lot of\nequations have wrong physical units (terms in the same equation have different\nunits).\n", "  We establish a correspondence between two very general paradigms for systems\nthat persist away from thermal equilibrium. In the first paradigm, a\nnonequilibrium steady state (NESS) is maintained by applying fixed\nthermodynamic forces that break detailed balance. In the second paradigm, known\nas a stochastic pump (SP), a time-periodic state is maintained by the periodic\nvariation of a system's external parameters. In both cases, currents are\ngenerated and entropy is produced. Restricting ourselves to discrete-state\nsystems, we establish a mapping between these scenarios. Given a NESS\ncharacterized by a particular set of stationary probabilities, currents and\nentropy production rates, we show how to construct a SP with exactly the same\n(time-averaged) values. The mapping works in the opposite direction as well.\nThese results establish an equivalence between the two paradigms, by showing\nthat stochastic pumps are able to mimic the behavior of nonequilibrium steady\nstates, and vice-versa.\n", "  Neutron star and supernova matter at densities just below the nuclear matter\nsaturation density is expected to form a lattice of exotic shapes. These\nso-called nuclear pasta phases are caused by Coulomb frustration. Their elastic\nand transport properties are believed to play an important role for thermal and\nmagnetic field evolution, rotation and oscillation of neutron stars.\nFurthermore, they can impact neutrino opacities in core-collapse supernovae. In\nthis work, we present proof-of-principle 3D Skyrme Hartree-Fock (SHF)\nsimulations of nuclear pasta with the Multi-resolution ADaptive Numerical\nEnvironment for Scientific Simulations (MADNESS). We perform benchmark studies\nof $^{16} \\mathrm{O}$, $^{208} \\mathrm{Pb}$ and $^{238} \\mathrm{U}$ nuclear\nground states and calculate binding energies via 3D SHF simulations. Results\nare compared with experimentally measured binding energies as well as with\ntheoretically predicted values from an established SHF code. The nuclear pasta\nsimulation is initialized in the so-called waffle geometry as obtained by the\nIndiana University Molecular Dynamics (IUMD) code. The size of the unit cell is\n24\\:fm with an average density of about $\\rho = 0.05 \\:\\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$,\nproton fraction of $Y_p = 0.3$ and temperature of $T=0\\:$MeV. Our calculations\nreproduce the binding energies and shapes of light and heavy nuclei with\ndifferent geometries. For the pasta simulation, we find that the final geometry\nis very similar to the initial waffle state. In the present pasta calculations\nspin-orbit forces are not included but will be added in the future. Within the\nMADNESS framework, we can successfully perform calculations of inhomogeneous\nnuclear matter. By using pasta configurations from IUMD it is possible to\nexplore different geometries and test the impact of self-consistent\ncalculations on the latter.\n", "  We model the low energy dynamics of graphene in the continuum in terms of a\nversion of Reduced Quantum Electrodynamics restricting fermions to a\n(2+1)-dimensional brane, whilst photons remain within the (3+1)-dimensional\nbulk. For charge carriers, besides the Dirac mass gap, we consider a Haldane\nmass term which is induced by parametrizing an effective parity $\\mathcal{P}$\nand time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry breaking that occurs on the brane when\ndeformations of the honeycomb array are such that the equivalence between\nsublattices is lost. We make use of the relativistic Kubo formula and carry out\nan explicit calculation of the transverse conductivity. As expected, the\nfilling factor is a half (in natural units) for each fermion species.\nFurthermore, assuming that a sample of this material is radiated\nperpendicularly with polarized monochromatic light of frequency $\\omega$, from\nthe modified Maxwell's equations we study the problem of light absorption in\ngraphene in terms of the said conductivity. We observe an analog effect to the\nFaraday Rotation due the Induced Mass (FRIM)--and not to an external magnetic\nfield-- in which light penetrating the sample changes its angle of polarization\nsolely by effect of the induced mass. This effect might be relevant for the\ndevelopment of optic filters based on mechanical stretching of graphene flakes.\n", "  The present work is dedicated to the theoretical analysis of two-photon\nexcitation of atoms in a discrete energy spectrum by ultrashort electromagnetic\npulses of femto- and subfemtosecond ranges of durations. As examples,\nexcitation of hydrogen and sodium atoms from the ground state to excited states\nwith a zero orbital moment is considered.\n", "  Biopolymers serve as one-dimensional tracks on which motor proteins move to\nperform their biological roles. Motor protein phenomena have inspired\ntheoretical models of one-dimensional transport, crowding, and jamming.\nExperiments studying the motion of Xklp1 motors on reconstituted antiparallel\nmicrotubule overlaps demonstrated that motors recruited to the overlap walk\ntoward the plus end of individual microtubules and frequently switch between\nfilaments. We study a model of this system that couples the totally asymmetric\nsimple exclusion process (TASEP) for motor motion with switches between\nantiparallel filaments and binding kinetics. We determine steady-state motor\ndensity profiles for fixed-length overlaps using exact and approximate\nsolutions of the continuum differential equations and compare to kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations. Overlap motor density profiles and motor trajectories\nresemble experimental measurements. The phase diagram of the model is similar\nto the single-filament case for low switching rate, while for high switching\nrate we find a new low density-high density-low density-high density phase. The\noverlap center region, far from the overlap ends, has a constant motor density\nas one would naively expect. However, rather than following a simple binding\nequilibrium, the center motor density depends on total overlap length, motor\nspeed, and motor switching rate. The size of the crowded boundary layer near\nthe overlap ends is also dependent on the overlap length and switching rate in\naddition to the motor speed and bulk concentration. The antiparallel\nmicrotubule overlap geometry may offer a previously unrecognized mechanism for\nbiological regulation of protein concentration and consequent activity.\n", "  We calculate the jet shape and the jet cross section in heavy ion collisions\nusing soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) and its extension with Glauber\ngluon interactions in the medium (SCET$_{\\rm G}$). We use the previously\ndeveloped framework to systematically resum the jet shape at next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy, and we consistently include the medium modification by\nincorporating the leading order medium-induced splitting functions. The\ncalculation provides, for the first time, a quantitative understanding of the\njet shape modification measurement in lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=2.76$ TeV at the LHC. The inclusive jet suppression is also calculated\nwithin the same framework beyond the traditional concept of parton energy loss,\nand the dependence on the centrality, the jet radius and the jet kinematics is\nexamined. In the end we present predictions for the anticipated jet shape and\ncross section measurements in lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}\\approx5.1$ TeV at the LHC.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of migration of the small molecular weight component\nof a binary polymer mixture to the free surface using mean field and\nself-consistent field theories. By proposing a free energy functional that\nincorporates polymer-matrix elasticity explicitly, we compute the migrant\nvolume fraction and show that it decreases significantly as the sample rigidity\nis increased. Estimated values of the bulk modulus suggest that the effect\nshould be observable experimentally for rubber-like materials. This provides a\nsimple way of controlling surface migration in polymer mixtures and can play an\nimportant role in industrial formulations, where surface migration often leads\nto decreased product functionality.\n", "  A novel exactly solvable Schr\\\"odinger equation with a position-dependent\nmass (PDM) describing a Coulomb problem in $D$ dimensions is obtained by\nextending the known duality relating the quantum $d$-dimensional oscillator and\n$D$-dimensional Coulomb problems in Euclidean spaces for $D = (d+2)/2$. As an\nintermediate step, a mapping between a quantum $d$-dimensional nonlinear\noscillator of Mathews-Lakshmanan type (or oscillator in a space of constant\ncurvature) and a quantum $D$-dimensional Coulomb-like problem in a space of\nnonconstant curvature is derived. It is finally reinterpreted in a PDM\nbackground.\n", "  Phonon mean free path is generally inferred from the measurement of thermal\nconductivity and we are still lacking precise information on this quantity.\nRecent advances in the field of high frequency phonons transduction using\nsemiconductor superlattices give the opportunity to fill this gap. We present\nexperimental results on the attenuation of longitudinal acoustic phonons in\nGaAs in the frequency and temperature ranges 0.2-1THz and 10-80K respectively.\nSurprisingly, we observe a plateau, in the frequency dependence of the\nattenuation, above 0.4THz, that we ascribe to a breakdown of Herring processes.\n", "  Simulations of one quantum system by an other has an implication in\nrealization of quantum machine that can imitate any quantum system and solve\nproblems that are not accessible to classical computers. One of the approach to\nengineer quantum simulations is to discretize the space-time degree of freedom\nin quantum dynamics and define the quantum cellular automata (QCA), a local\nunitary update rule on a lattice. Different models of QCA are constructed using\nset of conditions which are not unique and are not always in implementable\nconfiguration on any other system. Dirac Cellular Automata (DCA) is one such\nmodel constructed for Dirac Hamiltonian (DH) in free quantum field theory.\nHere, starting from a split-step discrete-time quantum walk (QW) which is\nuniquely defined for experimental implementation, we recover the DCA along with\nall the fine oscillations in position space and bridge the missing connection\nbetween DH-DCA-QW. We will present the contribution of the parameters resulting\nin the fine oscillations on the Zitterbewegung frequency and entanglement. The\ntuneability of the evolution parameters demonstrated in experimental\nimplementation of QW will establish it as an efficient tool to design quantum\nsimulator and approach quantum field theory from principles of quantum\ninformation theory.\n", "  The kinetic energy of a star in orbit about a supermassive black hole is a\nsignificant fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to\nits tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted\nand injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the\nblack hole, with the fastest material moving at $\\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,\nwe present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams\n(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding\ngas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that\nhydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the\ndensest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs\ntravel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with\ndistance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the\nambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This\nsudden injection of $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a\nSedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic\nrays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the\nmolecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs\nmight be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as\nSNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.\n", "  We report on the X-ray spectral behavior within the steady states of GRS\n1915+105. Our work is based on the full data set on the source obtained using\nthe Proportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and 15 GHz\nradio data obtained using the Ryle Telescope. The steady observations within\nthe X-ray data set naturally separated into two regions in the color-color\ndiagram and we refer to them as steady-soft and steady-hard. GRS 1915+105\ndisplays significant curvature in the coronal component in both the soft and\nhard data within the {\\it RXTE}/PCA bandpass. A majority of the steady-soft\nobservations displays a roughly constant inner disk radius (R_in), while the\nsteady-hard observations display an evolving disk truncation which is\ncorrelated to the mass accretion rate through the disk. The disk flux and\ncoronal flux are strongly correlated in steady-hard observations and very\nweakly correlated in the steady-soft observations. Within the steady-hard\nobservations we observe two particular circumstances when there are\ncorrelations between the coronal X-ray flux and the radio flux with log slopes\n\\eta~0.68 +/- 0.35 and \\eta ~ 1.12 +/- 0.13. They are consistent with the upper\nand lower tracks of Gallo et al. (2012), respectively. A comparison of model\nparameters to the state definitions show that almost all steady-soft\nobservations match the criteria of either thermal or steep power law state,\nwhile a large portion of the steady-hard observations match the hard state\ncriteria when the disk fraction constraint is neglected.\n", "  We investigate the striking absence of strong localisation observed in\nmesoscopic two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) (Baenninger et al 2008 Phys.\nRev. Lett. 100 1016805, Backes et al 2015 Phys. Rev. B 92 235427) even when\ntheir resistivity $\\rho >> h/e^2$. In particular, we try to understand whether\nthis phenomenon originates in quantum many-body effects, or simply percolative\ntransport through a network of electron puddles. To test the latter scenario,\nwe measure the low temperature (low-$T$) transport properties of long and\nnarrow 2DEG devices in which percolation effects should be heavily suppressed\nin favour of Coulomb blockade. Strikingly we find no indication of Coulomb\nblockade and that the high-$\\rho$, low-$T$ transport is exactly similar to that\npreviously reported in mesoscopic 2DEGs with different geometries. Remarkably,\nwe are able to induce a `metal'-insulator transition (MIT) by applying a\nperpendicular magnetic field $B$. We present a picture within which these\nobservations fit into the more conventional framework of the 2D MIT.\n", "  We study a simplified coupled atmosphere-ocean model using the formalism of\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), which link physically-based directions of\nperturbations to growth/decay rates. The model is obtained via a severe\ntruncation of quasi-geostrophic equations for the two fluids, and includes a\nsimple yet physically meaningful representation of their\ndynamical/thermodynamical coupling. The model has 36 degrees of freedom, and\nthe parameters are chosen so that a chaotic behaviour is observed. One finds\ntwo positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), sixteen negative LEs, and eighteen\nnear-zero LEs. The presence of many near-zero LEs results from the vast\ntime-scale separation between the characteristic time scales of the two fluids,\nand leads to nontrivial error growth properties in the tangent space spanned by\nthe corresponding CLVs, which are geometrically very degenerate. Such CLVs\ncorrespond to two different classes of ocean/atmosphere coupled modes. The\ntangent space spanned by the CLVs corresponding to the positive and negative\nLEs has, instead, a non-pathological behaviour, and one can construct robust\nlarge deviations laws for the finite time LEs, thus providing a universal model\nfor assessing predictability on long to ultra-long scales along such\ndirections. It is somewhat surprising to find that the tangent space of the\nunstable manifold has strong projection on both atmospheric and oceanic\ncomponents. Our results underline the difficulties in using hyperbolicity as a\nconceptual framework for multiscale chaotic dynamical systems, whereas the\nframework of partial hyperbolicity seems better suited, possibly indicating an\nalternative definition for the chaotic hypothesis. Our results suggest the need\nfor accurate analysis of error dynamics on different time scales and domains\nand for a careful set-up of assimilation schemes when looking at coupled\natmosphere-ocean models.\n", "  We investigate the local structure factor $S(z;q)$ at a free liquid-gas\ninterface in systems with short-ranged intermolecular forces and determine the\ncorrections to the leading-order, capillary-wave-like, Goldstone mode\ndivergence of $S(z;q)$ known to occur for parallel wavevectors $q\\to 0$. We\nshow from explicit solution of the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation that\nfor distances $z$ far from the interface, where the profile decays\nexponentially, $S(z;q)$ splits unambiguously into bulk and interfacial\ncontributions. On each side of the interface, the interfacial contributions can\nbe characterised by distinct liquid and gas wavevector dependent surface\ntensions, $\\sigma_l(q)$ and $\\sigma_g(q)$, which are determined solely by the\n$bulk$ two-body and three-body direct correlation functions. At high\ntemperatures, the wavevector dependence simplifies and is determined almost\nentirely by the appropriate bulk structure factor, leading to positive rigidity\ncoefficients. Our predictions are confirmed by explicit calculation of $S(z;q)$\nwithin square-gradient theory and the Sullivan model. The results for the\nlatter predict a striking temperature dependence for $\\sigma_l(q)$ and\n$\\sigma_g(q)$, and have implications for fluctuation effects. Our results\naccount quantitatively for the findings of a recent very extensive simulation\nstudy by H\\\"ofling and Dietrich of the total structure factor in the\ninterfacial region, in a system with a cut-off Lennard-Jones potential, in\nsharp contrast to extended Capillary-Wave models which failed completely to\ndescribe the simulation results.\n", "  A unified ballooning theory, constructed on the basis of two special theories\n[Y. Z. Zhang, S. M. Mahajan, X. D. Zhang, Phys. Fluids B4, 2729 (1992); Y. Z.\nZhang, T. Xie, Nucl. Fusion & Plasma Phys. 33, 193 (2013)], shows that a weak\nup-down asymmetric mode structure is normally formed in an up-down symmetric\nequilibrium; the weak up-down asymmetry in mode structure is the manifestation\nof non-trivial higher order effects beyond the standard ballooning equation. It\nis shown that the asymmetric mode may have even higher growth rate than\nsymmetric modes. Salient features of the theory are illustrated by\ninvestigating a fluid model for the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode. The\ntwo dimensional (2D) analytical form of ITG mode, solved in ballooning\nrepresentation, is then converted into the radial-poloidal space to provide the\nnatural boundary condition for solving the 2D mathematical local eigenmode\nproblem. We find the analytical expression of mode structure in good agreement\nwith finite difference solution. This sets a reliable framework for\nquasi-linear computation.\n", "  A self-consistent pre-inflationary extension of the inflationary scenario\nwith the Starobinsky potential, favored by Planck data, is studied using\ntechniques from loop quantum cosmology (LQC). The results are compared with the\nquadratic potential previously studied. Planck scale completion of the\ninflationary paradigm and observable signatures of LQC are found to be robust\nunder the change of the inflaton potential. The entire evolution, from the\nquantum bounce all the way to the end of inflation, is compatible with\nobservations. Occurrence of desired slow-roll phase is almost inevitable and\nnatural initial conditions exist for both the background and perturbations for\nwhich the resulting power spectrum agrees with recent observations. There exist\ninitial data for which the quantum gravitational corrections to the power\nspectrum are potentially observable.\n", "  We study the behaviour of Bianchi class A universes containing an ultra-stiff\nisotropic ghost field and a fluid with anisotropic pressures which is also\nultra-stiff on the average. This allows us to investigate whether cyclic\nuniverse scenarios, like the ekpyrotic model, do indeed lead to isotropisation\non approach to a singularity (or bounce) in the presence of dominant\nultra-stiff pressure anisotropies. We specialise to consider the closed Bianchi\ntype IX universe and show that when the anisotropic pressures are stiffer on\naverage than any isotropic ultra-stiff fluid then, if they dominate on approach\nto the singularity, it will be anisotropic. We include an isotropic ultra-stiff\nghost fluid with negative energy density in order to create a cosmological\nbounce at finite volume in the absence of the anisotropic fluid. When the\ndominant anisotropic fluid is present it leads to an anisotropic cosmological\nsingularity rather than an isotropic bounce. The inclusion of anisotropic\nstresses generated by collisionless particles in an anisotropically expanding\nuniverse is therefore essential for a full analysis of the consequences of a\ncosmological bounce or singularity in cyclic universes.\n", "  Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are coherent peaks of variability power\nobserved in the X-ray power spectra (PSDs) of stellar mass X-ray binaries\n(XRBs). A scale invariance of the accretion process implies they should be\npresent in the active galactic nuclei. The first robust detection was a $\\sim\n1$ hr periodicity in the Seyfert galaxy RE J1034+396 from a $\\sim 90$ ks\nXMM-Newton observation, however, subsequent observations failed to detect the\nQPO in the $0.3-10.0$ keV band. In this talk we present the recent detection of\nthe $\\sim 1$ hr periodicity in the $1.0-4.0$ keV band of 4 further\nlow-flux/spectrally-harder observations of RE J1034+396 (see Alston et al\n2014). We also present recent work on the discovery of a QPO in the Seyfert\ngalaxy, MS 22549-3712, which again is only detected in energy bands associated\nwith the primary power-law continuum emission (Alston et al 2015). We conclude\nthese features are most likely analogous to the high-frequency QPOs observed in\nXRBs. In both sources, we also see evidence for X-ray reverberation at the QPO\nfrequency, where soft X-ray bands and Iron K$\\alpha$ emission lag the primary\nX-ray continuum. These time delays may provide another diagnostic for\nunderstanding the underlying QPO mechanism observed in accreting black holes.\n", "  We study experimentally and computationally the dynamics of granular flow\nduring impacts, where intruders strike a collection of disks from above. In the\nregime where granular force dynamics are much more rapid than the intruder\nmotion, we find that the particle flow near the intruder is proportional to the\ninstantaneous intruder speed; it is essentially constant when normalized by\nthat speed. The granular flow is nearly divergence-free and remains in balance\nwith the intruder, despite the latter's rapid deceleration. Simulations\nindicate that this observation is insensitive to grain properties, which can be\nexplained by the separation of time scales between intergrain force dynamics\nand intruder dynamics. Assuming there is a comparable separation of time\nscales, we expect our results are applicable to a broad class of dynamic or\ntransient granular flows. Our results suggest that descriptions of\nstatic-in-time granular flows might be extended or modified to describe these\ndynamic flows. Additionally, we find that accurate grain-grain interactions are\nnot necessary to correctly capture the granular flow in this regime.\n", "  We discuss preliminary results from a joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR monitoring\nprogram on the active galactic nucleus NGC 4593, consisting of 5x20 ks\nobservations, spaced by two days, performed in January 2015. The source is\nfound to be variable, both in flux and spectral shape, on time scales as short\nas a few ks. The spectrum clearly softens when the source brightens. A simple\ntiming analysis suggests the presence of a variable soft excess that correlates\nwith the primary continuum.\n", "  The Dirac procedure for dealing with constraints is applied to the\nquantization of gauge theories on the light front. The light cone gauge is used\nin conjunction with the first class constraints that arise and the resulting\nDirac brackets are found. These gauge conditions are not used to eliminate\ndegrees of freedom from the action prior to applying the Dirac constraint\nprocedure. This approach is illustrated by considering Yang-Mills theory and\nthe superparticle in a 2 + 1 dimensional target space.\n", "  A large (240 cm $\\times$ 120 cm $\\times$ 0.2 cm) oil-free High Pressure\nLaminate (HPL), commonly referred as \"bakelite\", Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)\nhas been developed at VECC-Kolkata using locally available P-302 OLTC grade\nHPL. The chamber has been operated in streamer mode using Argon, Freon(R134a)\nand Iso-butane in a ratio of 34:57:9 by volume. The electrodes and glue samples\nhave been characterised by measuring their electrical parameters like bulk\nresistivity and surface resistivity. The performance of the chamber has been\nstudied by measuring the efficiency, its uniformity and stability in detection\nof cosmic muons. Timing measurement has been performed at a central location of\nthe chamber. The chamber showed an efficiency $>$95$\\%$ and time resolution\n($\\sigma$), at the point of measurement, $\\sim$0.83 ns at 9000V. Details of the\nmaterial characterisation, fabrication procedure and performance studies have\nbeen discussed.\n", "  We study deformations of axially symmetric initial data for Einstein-Maxwell\nequations satisfying the time-rotation ($t$-$\\phi$) symmetry and containing one\nasymptotically cylindrical end and one asymptotically flat end. We find that\nthe $t$-$\\phi$ symmetry implies the existence of a family of deformed data\nhaving the same horizon structure. This result allows us to measure how close\nsolutions to Lichnerowicz equation are when arising from nearby free data.\n", "  The formation of Black Hole (BH) Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB) poses a\ntheoretical challenge, as low-mass companions are not expected to survive the\ncommon-envelope scenario with the BH progenitor. Here we propose a formation\nmechanism that skips the common-envelope scenario and relies on triple-body\ndynamics. We study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the secular\ndynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, including\ngeneral relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such as\nmass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. During the dynamical\nevolution of the triple system, the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism can cause\nlarge eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main\nBH-LMXB formation channels. Here we define BH-LMXB candidates as systems where\nthe inner BH companion star crosses its Roche limit. In the \"eccentric\" channel\n(~ 81% of the LMXBs in our simulations), the donor star crosses its Roche limit\nduring an extreme eccentricity excitation, while still on a wide orbit. Second,\nwe find a \"giant\" LMXB channel (~ 11%), where a system undergoes only moderate\neccentricity excitations, but the donor star fills its Roche lobe after\nevolving toward the giant branch. Third, we identify a \"classical\" channel\n(~8%), where tidal forces and magnetic braking shrink and circularize the orbit\nto short periods, triggering mass transfer. Finally, for the giant channel, we\npredict an eccentric ($\\sim 0.3-0.6$), preferably inclined (~40, ~140 degreed)\ntertiary, typically on a wide enough orbit (~10^4AU), to potentially become\nunbound later in the triple evolution.\n", "  We present the current results of an investigation into M51 ULX-7, using\narchival data from XMM-Newton, Chandra and NuSTAR, and optical and radio data\nfrom HST and VLA. The source has a consistently hard power-law X-ray spectrum\nand high short-term variability. This is unusual variability behaviour for a\nULX, as we would expect highly variable ULXs to have soft energy spectra. The\npower spectrum features a break at ~1e-3 Hz, from low frequency spectral index\nalpha=0.1 to high frequency spectral index alpha=0.8, analogous to the low\nfrequency break found in power spectra of black holes accreting in the low/hard\nstate. We do not observe a corresponding high frequency break, however taking\nthe white noise level as a frequency lower limit of the break, we can calculate\na black hole mass upper limit of 9.12e4 solar masses, assuming that the ULX is\nin the low/hard state. While there is no radio detection, we find a flux\ndensity upper limit of 87 micro-Jy/beam. Using the X-ray/radio fundamental\nplane, we calculate a black hole mass upper limit of 1.95e5 solar masses.\nTherefore, this ULX is consistent with being an IMBH accreting in the low/hard\nstate.\n", "  Intercalation of Au can produce giant Rashba-type spin-orbit splittings in\ngraphene but this has not yet been achieved on a semiconductor substrate. For\ngraphene/SiC(0001), Au intercalation yields two phases with different doping.\nHere, we report the preparation of an almost pure p-type graphene phase after\nAu intercalation. We observe a 100 meV Rashba-type spin-orbit splitting at 0.9\neV binding energy. We show that this giant splitting is due to hybridization\nand much more limited in energy and momentum space than for Au-intercalated\ngraphene on Ni.\n", "  In the framework of kt-factorization approach,the production of prompt\n$\\chi_c$ mesons in pp collisions at the LHC energies is studied. Our\nconsideration is based on the off-shell amplitudes for hard partonic\nsubprocesses $g^*g^*\\to\\chi_{cJ}$ and non-relativistic QCD formalism for bound\nstates. The transverse momentum dependent (unintegrated) gluon densities in a\nproton were derived from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation\nor, alternatively, were chosen in accordance with Kimber-Martin-Ryskin\nprescription. Taking into account both color singlet and color octet\ncontributions, we deduce the corresponding non-perturbative long-distance\nmatrix elements from the fits to the latest ATLAS data on $\\chi_{c1}$ and\n$\\chi_{c2}$ transverse momentum distributions at $\\sqrt s = 7$ TeV. We find\nthat these distributions at small and moderate pt are formed mainly by the\ncolor singlet components. We successfully described the data on the\ndifferential cross sections and relative production rates\n$\\sigma(\\chi_{c2})/\\sigma(\\chi_{c1})$ presented by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb\nCollaborations. We find that the fit points to unequal wave functions of\n$\\chi_{c1}$ and $\\chi_{c2}$ states.\n", "  Constraining the behavior of cosmic ray data observed at Earth requires a\nprecise understanding of how the cosmic rays propagate in the interstellar\nmedium. The interstellar medium is not homogeneous; although turbulent magnetic\nfields dominate over large scales, small coherent regions of magnetic field\nexist on scales relevant to particle propagation in the nearby Galaxy. Guided\npropagation through a coherent field is significantly different from random\nparticle diffusion and could be the explanation of spatial anisotropies in the\nobserved cosmic rays. We present a Monte Carlo code to propagate cosmic\nparticle through realistic magnetic field structures. We discuss the details of\nthe model as well as some preliminary studies which indicate that coherent\nmagnetic structures are important effects in local cosmic-ray propagation,\nincreasing the flux of cosmic rays by over two orders of magnitude at\nanisotropic locations on the sky. The features induced by coherent magnetic\nstructure could be the cause of the observed TeV cosmic-ray anisotropy.\n", "  We have theoretically studied how the azimuthal phase structure of an\nelectron vortex beam excites surface plasmons on metal particles of different\ngeometries as observed in electron energy loss spectroscopy. To do so, we have\ndeveloped a semi-classical approximation combining an azimuthal phase factor\nand the dielectric formalism. Our results indicate that the vortex beam order\nmay be used to modify and control surface plasmon multipole excitation in\nnanoparticles. In favorable cases, specific plasmon modes can even attain\nenhancement factor of several orders of magnitude. Since, electron vortex beams\ninteract with particles mostly through interference effects due to azimuthal\nsymmetries, i.e. in the plane perpendicular to the electron beam, anisotropy\ninformation (longitudinal and transversal) of the sample can be derived in EELS\nstudies by comparing non-vortex and vortex beam measurements.\n", "  A general near-field thermal electromagnetic transport formalism that is\nindependent of the size, shape and number of heat sources is derived. The\nformalism is based on fluctuational electrodynamics, where fluctuating currents\ndue to thermal agitation are added to Maxwell's curl equations, and is thus\nvalid for heat sources in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Using a volume\nintegral formulation, it is shown that the proposed formalism is a\ngeneralization of the classical electromagnetic scattering framework in which\nthermal emission is implicitly assumed to be negligible. The near-field thermal\nelectromagnetic transport formalism is afterwards applied to a problem\ninvolving three spheres with size comparable to the wavelength, where all\nmultipolar interactions are taken into account. Using the thermal discrete\ndipole approximation, it is shown that depending on the dielectric function,\nthe presence of a third sphere slightly affects the spatial distribution of\npower absorbed compared to the two-sphere case. A transient analysis shows that\ndespite a non-uniform spatial distribution of power absorbed, the sphere\ntemperature remains spatially uniform at any instant due to the fact that the\nthermal resistance by conduction is much smaller than the resistance by\nradiation. The formalism proposed in this paper is general, and could be used\nas a starting point for adapting solution methods employed in traditional\nelectromagnetic scattering problems to near-field thermal electromagnetic\ntransport.\n", "  I calculate the 1-loop self-energy of the lowest Landau level an electron of\nmass m in a strong, constant and uniform external magnetic field B, beyond its\nalways used truncation at (ln L)^2, L=|e|B/m^2. This is achieved by evaluating\nthe integral deduced in 1953 by Demeur and incompletely calculated in 1969 by\nJancovici, which I recover from Schwinger's techniques of calculation. It\nyields \\delta m \\simeq (\\alpha*m/(4*\\pi))*[(\\ln L -\\gamma_E -3/2)^2 -9/4\n+\\pi/(\\beta-1) + \\pi^2/6 +\\pi*\\Gamma[1-\\beta]/L^{\\beta-1}\n+(1/L)*(\\pi/(2-\\beta)-5) +{\\cal O}(1/L^{>= 2})] with \\beta \\approx 1.175 for 75\n=< L =< 10000. . The (\\ln L)^2 truncation exceeds the precise estimate by 45%\nat L=100 and by more at lower values of L, due to neglecting, among others, the\nsingle logarithmic contribution. This is doubly unjustified because it is large\nand because it is needed to fulfill appropriate renormalization conditions.\nTechnically challenging improvements look therefore necessary, for example when\nresumming higher loops and incorporating the effects of large B on the photonic\nvacuum polarization, like investigated in recent years.\n", "  In the last decade, X-ray spectroscopy has enabled a wealth of discoveries of\nphotoionised absorbers in X-ray binaries. Studies of such accretion disc\natmospheres and winds are of fundamental importance to understand accretion\nprocesses and possible feedback mechanisms to the environment. In this work, we\nreview the current observational state and theoretical understanding of\naccretion disc atmospheres and winds in low-mass X-ray binaries, focusing on\nthe wind launching mechanisms and on the dependence on accretion state. We\nconclude with issues that deserve particular attention.\n", "  Recently various laser-chirping schemes have been investigated with the goal\nof reducing or eliminating ponderomotive line broadening in Compton or Thomson\nscattering occurring at high laser intensities. As a next level of detail in\nthe spectrum calculations, we have calculated the line smoothing and broadening\nexpected due to incident beam energy spread within a one-dimensional plane wave\nmodel for the incident laser pulse, both for compensated (chirped) and\nunchirped cases. The scattered compensated distributions are treatable\nanalytically within three models for the envelope of the incident laser pulses:\nGaussian, Lorentzian, or hyperbolic secant. We use the new results to\ndemonstrate that the laser chirping in Compton sources at high laser\nintensities: (i) enables the use of higher order harmonics, thereby reducing\nthe required electron beam energies; and (ii) increases the photon yield in a\nsmall frequency band beyond that possible with the fundamental without\nchirping. This combination of chirping and higher harmonics can lead to\nsubstantial savings in the design, construction and operational costs of the\nnew Compton sources. This is of particular importance to the the widely popular\nlaser-plasma accelerator based Compton sources, as the improvement in their\nbeam quality enters the regime where chirping is most effective.\n", "  Self-assembly of proteins into amyloid aggregates is an important biological\nphenomenon associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid\nfibrils also have potential applications in nano-engineering of biomaterials.\nThe kinetics of amyloid assembly show an exponential growth phase preceded by a\nlag phase, variable in duration as seen in bulk experiments and experiments\nthat mimic the small volumes of cells. Here, to investigate the origins and the\nproperties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly\ncurrently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms,\nwe formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the\ncharacteristics of amyloid growth curves despite its simplicity. We then solve\nthe stochastic differential equations of our model and give mathematical proof\nof a central limit theorem for the sample growth trajectories of the nucleated\naggregation process. These results give an asymptotic description for our\nsimple model, from which closed form analytical results capable of describing\nand predicting the variability of nucleated amyloid assembly were derived. We\nalso demonstrate the application of our results to inform experiments in a\nconceptually friendly and clear fashion. Our model offers a new perspective and\npaves the way for a new and efficient approach on extracting vital information\nregarding the key initial events of amyloid formation.\n", "  We derive limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section and lifetime\nusing measurements of the AMS-02 antiproton ratio and positron fraction data.\nIn deriving the limits, we consider the scenario of secondary particles\naccelerated in supernova remnants (SNRs) which has been argued to be able to\nreasonably account for the AMS-02 high energy positron/antiproton fraction\ndata. We parameterize the contribution of secondary particles accelerated in\nSNRs and then fit the observational data within the conventional cosmic ray\npropagation model by adopting the GALPROP code. We use the likelihood ratio\ntest to determine the 95$\\%$ confidence level upper limits of the possible dark\nmatter (DM) contribution to the antiproton/positron fractions measured by\nAMS-02. Our limits are stronger than that set by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray Pass 8\ndata of the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. We also show that the solar\nmodulation (cosmic ray propagation) parameters can play a non-negligible role\nin modifying the constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section and\nlifetime for $m_\\chi<100$ GeV ($m_\\chi>100$ GeV), where $m_\\chi$ is the rest\nmass of the dark matter particles. Using this results, we also put limits on\nthe effective field theory of dark matter.\n", "  Millimeter very long baseline interferometry will soon produce accurate\nimages of the closest surroundings of the supermassive compact object at the\ncenter of the Galaxy, Sgr A*. These images may reveal the existence of a\ncentral faint region, the so-called shadow, which is often interpreted as the\nobservable consequence of the event horizon of a black hole. In this paper, we\ncompute images of an accretion torus around Sgr A* assuming this compact object\nis a boson star, i.e. an alternative to black holes within general relativity,\nwith no event horizon and no hard surface. We show that very relativistic\nrotating boson stars produce images extremely similar to Kerr black holes,\nshowing in particular shadow-like and photon-ring-like structures. This result\nhighlights the extreme difficulty of unambiguously telling the existence of an\nevent horizon from strong-field images.\n", "  In the current state of cosmology, where cosmological parameters are being\nmeasured to percent accuracy, it is essential to understand all sources of\nerror to high precision. In this paper we present the results of a study of the\nlocal variations in the Hubble constant measured at the distance scale of the\nComa Cluster, and test the validity of correcting for the peculiar velocities\npredicted by gravitational instability theory. The study is based on N-body\nsimulations, and includes models featuring a coupling between dark energy and\ndark matter, as well as two $\\Lambda$CDM simulations with different values of\n$\\sigma_8$. It is found that the variance in the local flows is significantly\nlarger in the coupled models, which increases the uncertainty in the local\nmeasurements of the Hubble constant in these scenarios. By comparing the\nresults from the different simulations, it is found that most of the effect is\ncaused by the higher value of $\\sigma_8$ in the coupled cosmologies, though\nthis cannot account for all of the additional variance. Given the discrepancy\nbetween different estimates of the Hubble constant in the universe today,\ncosmological models causing a greater cosmic variance is something that we\nshould be aware of.\n", "  We present the results of the uniform analysis of 46 XMM-Newton observations\nof six BAL and seven mini-BAL QSOs belonging to the Palomar-Green Quasar\ncatalogue. Moderate-quality X-ray spectroscopy was performed with the EPIC-pn,\nand allowed to characterise the general source spectral shape to be complex,\nsignificantly deviating from a power law emission. A simple power law analysis\nin different energy bands strongly suggests absorption to be more significant\nthan reflection in shaping the spectra. If allowing for the absorbing gas to be\neither partially covering the continuum emission source or to be ionised, large\ncolumn densities of the order of $10^{22-24}$ cm$^{-2}$ are inferred. When the\nstatistics was high enough, virtually every source was found to vary in\nspectral shape on various time scales, from years to hours. All in all these\nobservational results are compatible with radiation driven accretion disk winds\nshaping the spectra of these intriguing cosmic sources.\n", "  We describe a method for the automatic mapping of coronal holes (CH) using\nsimultaneous multi-instrument EUV imaging data. Synchronized EUV images from\nSTEREO/EUVI A&B 195A and SDO/AIA 193A are preprocessed, including PSF\ndeconvolution and the application of data-derived intensity corrections that\naccount for center-to-limb variations (limb brightening) and inter-instrument\nintensity normalization. We systematically derive a robust limb-brightening\ncorrection that takes advantage of unbiased long-term averages of data and\nrespects the physical nature of the problem. The new preprocessing greatly\nassists in CH detection, allowing for the use of a simplified\nvariable-connectivity two-threshold region growing image segmentation algorithm\nto obtain consistent detection results. We generate synchronic EUV and CH maps,\nand show a preliminary analysis of CH evolution.\n  Several data and code products are made available to the community\n(www.predsci.com/chd): For the period of this study (06/10/2010 to 08/18/14) we\nprovide synchronic EUV and coronal hole map data at 6-hour cadence,\ndata-derived limb-brightening corrections for STEREO/EUVI A&B 195A and SDO/AIA\n193A, and inter-instrument correction factors to equate their intensities. We\nalso provide the coronal hole image segmentation code module (ezseg)\nimplemented in both FORTRAN OpenMP and GPU-accelerated C-CUDA. A complete\nimplementation of our coronal hole detection pipeline in the form of a\nready-to-use MATLAB driver script euv2chm utilizing ezseg is also made\navailable.\n", "  Spin systems controlled and probed by magnetic resonance have been valuable\nfor testing the ideas of quantum control and quantum error correction. This\npaper introduces an X-band pulsed electron spin resonance spectrometer designed\nfor high-fidelity coherent control of electron spins, including a loop-gap\nresonator for sub-millimeter sized samples with a control bandwidth ~ 40 MHz.\nUniversal control is achieved by a single-sideband upconversion technique with\nan I-Q modulator and a 1.2 GS/s arbitrary waveform generator. A single qubit\nrandomized benchmarking protocol quantifies the average errors of Clifford\ngates implemented by simple Gaussian pulses, using a sample of gamma-irradiated\nquartz. Improvements in unitary gate fidelity are achieved through phase\ntransient correction and hardware optimization. A preparation pulse sequence\nthat selects spin packets in a narrowed distribution of static fields confirms\nthat inhomogeneous dephasing (1/T2*) is the dominant source of gate error. The\nbest average fidelity over the Clifford gates obtained here is 99.2%, which\nserves as a benchmark to compare with other technologies.\n", "  We introduce a mechanism in which coupling between fluctuating spin magnetic\ndipole moments and polar optical phonons leads to a non-zero ferroic ordering\nof quasi-static magnetoelectric multipoles. Using first-principles calculations\nwithin the LSDA$+U$ method of density functional theory, we calculate the\nmagnitude of the effect for the prototypical cuprate superconductor,\nHgBa$_2$CuO$_4$. We show that our proposed mechanism is consistent, to our\nknowledge, with all experimental data for the onset of the pseudo-gap phase and\ntherefore propose the quasi-static magnetoelectric multipole as a possible\npseudo-gap order parameter. Finally, we show that our mechanism embraces some\nkey aspects of previous theoretical models, in particular the description of\nthe pseudo-gap phase in terms of orbital currents.\n", "  We present 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) modeling of an ultra-intense laser\nexperiment by the Extreme Light group at the Air Force Research Laboratory\n(AFRL) using the PIC code LSP. This is the first time PIC simulations have been\nperformed in 3D for this experiment which involves an ultra-intense,\nshort-pulse (30 fs) laser interacting with a water jet target at normal\nincidence. These 3D PIC simulation results are compared to results from\n2D(3$v$) PIC simulations for both $5.4~\\cdot~10^{17}$ W cm$^{-2}$ and\n$3~\\cdot~10^{17}$ W cm$^{-2}$ intensities. Comparing the 2D(3$v$) and 3D\nsimulation results, the laser-energy-to-ejected-electron-energy conversion\nefficiencies were comparable, but the angular distribution of ejected electrons\nshow interesting differences with qualitative differences at higher intensity.\nAn analytic plane-wave model is discussed which provides some explanation for\nthe angular distribution and energies of ejected electrons in the 2D(3$v$)\nsimulations. We also performed a 3D simulation with circularly polarized light\nand found a significantly higher conversion efficiency and peak electron\nenergy, which is promising for future experiments.\n", "  The notion of generations of monic polynomials such that the coefficients of\nthe polynomials of the next generation coincide with the zeros of the\npolynomials of the current generation is introduced, and its relevance to the\nidentification of endless sequences of new solvable many-body problems of\n\"goldfish type\" is demonstrated.\n", "  We present an analysis of the classic wormhole geometries based on conformal\nWeyl gravity, rather than standard general relativity. The main characteristics\nof the resulting traversable wormholes remain the same as in the seminal study\nby Morris and Thorne, namely, that effective super-luminal motion is a viable\nconsequence of the metric. Improving on previous work on the subject, we show\nthat for particular choices of the shape and redshift functions the wormhole\nmetric in the context of conformal gravity does not violate the main energy\nconditions at or near the wormhole throat. Some exotic matter might still be\nneeded at the junction between our solutions and flat spacetime, but we\ndemonstrate that the averaged null energy condition (as evaluated along radial\nnull geodesics) is satisfied for a particular set of wormhole geometries.\nTherefore, if fourth-order conformal Weyl gravity is a correct extension of\ngeneral relativity, traversable wormholes might become a realistic solution for\ninterstellar travel.\n", "  We study the strong vertices $N^*N\\pi$, $N^*N^*\\pi$ and $NN\\pi$ in QCD, where\n$N^*$ denotes the negative parity $N (1535)$ state. We use the most general\nform of the interpolating currents to calculate the corresponding strong\ncoupling constants. It is obtained that the coupling associated to $N^*N\\pi$\nvertex is strongly suppressed compared to those related to two other vertices.\nThe strong coupling corresponding to $N^*N^*\\pi$ is obtained to be roughly half\nof that of $NN\\pi$ vertex. We compare the obtained results on $N^*N\\pi$ and\n$NN\\pi$ vertices with the existing predictions of other theoretical studies as\nwell as those extracted from the experimental data.\n", "  As a key molecule of Life, Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the focus of\nnumbers of investigations with the help of biological, chemical and physical\ntechniques. From a physical point of view, both experimental and theoretical\nworks have brought quantitative insights into DNA base-pairing dynamics that we\nreview in this Report, putting emphasis on theoretical developments. We discuss\nthe dynamics at the base-pair scale and its pivotal coupling with the polymer\none, with a polymerization index running from a few nucleotides to tens of\nkilo-bases. This includes opening and closure of short hairpins and oligomers\nas well as zipping and unwinding of long macromolecules. We review how\ndifferent physical mechanisms are either used by Nature or utilized in\nbiotechnological processes to separate the two intertwined DNA strands, by\ninsisting on quantitative results. They go from thermally-assisted denaturation\nbubble nucleation to force- or torque- driven mechanisms. We show that the\nhelical character of the molecule, possibly supercoiled, can play a key role in\nmany denaturation and renaturation processes. We categorize the mechanisms\naccording to the relative timescales associated with base-pairing and chain\ndegrees of freedom such as bending and torsional elastic ones. In some specific\nsituations, these chain degrees of freedom can be integrated out, and the\nquasi- static approximation is valid. The complex dynamics then reduces to the\ndiffusion in a low-dimensional free-energy landscape. In contrast, some\nimportant cases of experimental interest necessarily appeal to\nfar-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics.\n", "  The current through a helical edge state of a quantum-spin-Hall insulator may\nbe fully transmitted through a magnetically gapped region due to a combination\nof spin-transfer torque and spin pumping [Meng {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf\n90}, 205403 (2014)]. Using a scattering approach, we here argue that in such a\nsystem the current is effectively carried by electrons with energies below the\nmagnet-induced gap and well below the Fermi energy. This has striking\nconsequences, such as the absence of shot noise, an exponential suppression of\nthermal noise, and an obstruction of thermal transport. For two helical edges\ncovered by the same quantum magnet, the device can act as robust noiseless\ncurrent splitter.\n", "  We introduce the concept of metasurface spatial processor, whose transmission\nis remotely and coherently controlled by the superposition of an incident wave\nand a control wave through the metasurface. The conceptual operation of this\ndevice is analogous to both that of a transistor and a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer, while offering much more diversity in terms of electromagnetic\ntransformations. We demonstrate two metasurfaces, that perform the operation of\nelectromagnetic switching and amplification.\n", "  The Majorana representation for spin operators enables efficient application\nof field-theoretical methods for the analysis of spin dynamics. Moreover, a\nwide class of spin correlation functions can be reduced to Majorana\ncorrelations of the same order, simplifying their calculation. For the\nspin-boson model, direct application of this method in the lowest order allows\nfor a straightforward computation of the transverse-spin correlations, however,\nfor the longitudinal-spin correlations it apparently fails in the long-time\nlimit. Here we indicate the reason and discuss, how this method can be used as\na convenient and accurate tool for generic spin correlations. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that accurate results are obtained by avoiding the use of the\nlongitudinal Majorana fermion, and that correlations of the remaining\ntransverse Majorana fermions can be easily evaluated using an effective\nGaussian action.\n", "  Recent evidence - in particular the hard X-ray spectra obtained by NuSTAR,\nand the large amplitude hard X-ray variability observed when ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULXs) show soft spectra - reveals that common ULX behaviour is\ninconsistent with known sub-Eddington accretion modes, as would be expected for\nan intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Instead, it appears that the majority\nof ULXs are powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes.\nHere, we will review work that delves deeper into ULX spectral-timing\nbehaviour, demonstrating it remains consistent with the expectations of\nsuper-Eddington accretion. One critical missing piece from this picture is the\ndirect detection of the massive, radiatively-driven winds expected from ULXs as\natomic emission/absorption line features in ULX spectra; we will show it is\nvery likely these have already been detected as residuals in the soft X-ray\nspectra of ULXs. Finally, we will discuss ULXs that do not appear to conform to\nthe emerging ULX behaviour patterns. In particular we discuss the implications\nof the identification of a good IMBH candidate as a background QSO; and the\nconfirmation of an IMBH/ULX candidate in the galaxy NGC 2276 via the\nradio/X-ray fundamental plane.\n", "  The uniformly hyperbolic Anosov C-systems defined on a torus have very strong\ninstability of their trajectories, as strong as it can be in principle. These\nsystems have exponential instability of all their trajectories and as such have\nmixing of all orders, nonzero Kolmogorov entropy and a countable set of\neverywhere dense periodic trajectories. In this paper we are studying the\nproperties of their spectrum and of the entropy. For a two-parameter family of\nC-system operators A(N,s), parametrised by the integers N and s, we found the\nuniversal limiting form of the spectrum, the dependence of entropy on N and the\nperiod of its trajectories on a rational sublattice. One can deduce from this\nresult that the entropy and the periods are sharply increasing with N. We\npresent a new three-parameter family of C-operators A(N,s,m) and analyse the\ndependence of its spectrum and of the entropy on the parameter m. We developed\nour earlier suggestion to use these tuneable Anosov C-systems for multipurpos\nMonte-Carlo simulations. The MIXMAX family of random number generators based on\nAnosov C-systems provide high quality statistical properties, thanks to their\nlarge entropy, have the best combination of speed, reasonable size of the\nstate, tuneable parameters and availability for implementing the\nparallelisation.\n", "  Within the context of piecewise linear manifolds we establish reflection\npositivity with a Hilbert action given in terms of the Regge curvature and a\ncosmological term. Using this positivity a Hilbert space for a quantum theory\nis constructed and some field operators and observables are given. The set-up\nallows to introduce time reversal though no time exists. All constructions are\nnon-perturbative.\n", "  In light of the growing number of cosmological observations, it is important\nto develop versatile tools to quantify the constraining power and consistency\nof cosmological probes. Originally motivated from information theory, we use\nthe relative entropy to compute the information gained by Bayesian updates in\nunits of bits. This measure quantifies both the improvement in precision and\nthe 'surprise', i.e. the tension arising from shifts in central values. Our\nstarting point is a WMAP9 prior which we update with observations of the\ndistance ladder, supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and weak\nlensing as well as the 2015 Planck release. We consider the parameters of the\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM concordance model and some of its extensions which include\ncurvature and Dark Energy equation of state parameter $w$. We find that,\nrelative to WMAP9 and within these model spaces, the probes that have provided\nthe greatest gains are Planck (10 bits), followed by BAO surveys (5.1 bits) and\nSNe experiments (3.1 bits). The other cosmological probes, including weak\nlensing (1.7 bits) and {$\\rm H_0$} measures (1.7 bits), have contributed\ninformation but at a lower level. Furthermore, we do not find any significant\nsurprise when updating the constraints of WMAP9 with any of the other\nexperiments, meaning that they are consistent with WMAP9. However, when we\nchoose Planck15 as the prior, we find that, accounting for the full\nmulti-dimensionality of the parameter space, the weak lensing measurements of\nCFHTLenS produce a large surprise of 4.4 bits which is statistically\nsignificant at the 8 $\\sigma$ level. We discuss how the relative entropy\nprovides a versatile and robust framework to compare cosmological probes in the\ncontext of current and future surveys.\n", "  The resource theory of asymmetry is a framework for classifying and\nquantifying the symmetry-breaking properties of both states and operations\nrelative to a given symmetry. In the special case where the symmetry is the set\nof translations generated by a fixed observable, asymmetry can be interpreted\nas coherence relative to the observable eigenbasis, and the resource theory of\nasymmetry provides a framework to study this notion of coherence. We here show\nthat this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed\nlimits. Indeed, the very concept of speed of evolution, i.e., the inverse of\nthe minimum time it takes the system to evolve to another (partially)\ndistinguishable state, is a measure of asymmetry relative to the time\ntranslations generated by the system Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the celebrated\nMandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin speed limits can be interpreted as upper\nbounds on this measure of asymmetry by functions which are themselves measures\nof asymmetry in the special case of pure states. Using measures of asymmetry\nthat are not restricted to pure states, such as the Wigner-Yanase skew\ninformation, we obtain extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound which are\nsignificantly tighter in the case of mixed states. We also clarify some\nconfusions in the literature about coherence and asymmetry, and show that\nmeasures of coherence are a proper subset of measures of asymmetry.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate theoretically the stabilization of a\nfree-running vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser exhibiting polarization\nchaos dynamics. We report the existence of a boundary isolating the chaotic\nattractor on one side and a steady-state on the other side, and identify the\nunstable periodic orbit playing the role of separatrix. In addition, we\nhighlight a small range of parameters where the chaotic attractor passes\nthrough this boundary, and therefore where chaos only appears as a transient\nbehaviour. Then, including the effect of spontaneous emission noise in the\nlaser, we demonstrate that, for realistic levels of noise, the system is\nsystematically pushed over the separating solution. As a result, we show that\nthe chaotic dynamics cannot be sustained unless the steady-state on the other\nside of the separatrix becomes unstable. Finally, we link the stability of this\nsteady-state to a small value of the birefringence in the laser cavity and\ndiscuss the significance of this result on future experimental work.\n", "  Dry, freely evolving granular materials in a dilute gaseous state coalesce\ninto dense clusters only due to dissipative interactions. This clustering\ntransition is important for a number of problems ranging from geophysics to\ncosmology. Here we show that the evolution of a dilute, freely cooling granular\ngas is determined in a universal way by the ratio of inertial flow and thermal\nvelocities, that is, the Mach number. Theoretical calculations and direct\nnumerical simulations of the granular Navier--Stokes equations show that\nirrespective of the coefficient of restitution, density or initial velocity\ndistribution, the density fluctuations follow a universal quadratic dependence\non the system's Mach number. We find that the clustering exhibits a scale-free\ndynamics but the clustered state becomes observable when the Mach number is\napproximately of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Our results provide a method to determine\nthe age of a granular gas and predict the macroscopic appearance of clusters.\n", "  We establish connections between two cascades of integrable systems generated\nfrom the continuum limits of the Hirota-Miwa equation and its remarkable\nnonlinear counterpart under the Miwa transformation respectively. Among these\nequations, we are mainly concerned with the semi-discrete bilinear\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation which is seldomly studied in literature.\nWe present both of its Casorati and Grammian determinant solutions. Through the\nPfaffianization procedure proposed by Hirota and Ohta, we are able to derive\nthe coupled integrable system for the semi-discrete KP equation.\n", "  Various interacting lattice path models of polymer collapse in two dimensions\ndemonstrate different critical behaviours. This difference has been without a\nclear explanation. The collapse transition has been variously seen to be in the\nDuplantier-Saleur $\\theta$-point university class (specific heat cusp), the\ninteracting trail class (specific heat divergence) or even first-order. Here we\nstudy via Monte Carlo simulation a generalisation of the Duplantier-Saleur\nmodel on the honeycomb lattice and also a generalisation of the so-called\nvertex-interacting self-avoiding walk model (configurations are actually\nrestricted trails known as grooves) on the triangular lattice. Crucially for\nboth models we have three and two body interactions explicitly and\ndifferentially weighted. We show that both models have similar phase diagrams\nwhen considered in these larger two-parameter spaces. They demonstrate regions\nfor which the collapse transition is first-order for high three body\ninteractions and regions where the collapse is in the Duplantier-Saleur\n$\\theta$-point university class. We conjecture a higher order multiple critical\npoint separating these two types of collapse.\n", "  We investigate and compare three distinguished geometric measures of\nbipartite quantum correlations that have been recently introduced in the\nliterature: the geometric discord, the measurement-induced geometric discord,\nand the discord of response, each one defined according to three contractive\ndistances on the set of quantum states, namely the trace, Bures, and Hellinger\ndistances. We establish a set of exact algebraic relations and inequalities\nbetween the different measures. In particular, we show that the geometric\ndiscord and the discord of response based on the Hellinger distance are easy to\ncompute analytically for all quantum states whenever the reference subsystem is\na qubit. These two measures thus provide the first instance of discords that\nare simultaneously fully computable, reliable (since they satisfy all the basic\nAxioms that must be obeyed by a proper measure of quantum correlations), and\noperationally viable (in terms of state distinguishability). We apply the\ngeneral mathematical structure to determine the closest classical-quantum state\nof a given state and the maximally quantum-correlated states at fixed global\nstate purity according to the different distances, as well as a necessary\ncondition for a channel to be quantumness breaking.\n", "  We present a study of photometric redshift accuracy in the 3D-HST photometric\ncatalogs, using 3D-HST grism redshifts to quantify and dissect trends in\nredshift accuracy for galaxies brighter than $H_{F140W}<24$ with an\nunprecedented and representative high-redshift galaxy sample. We find an\naverage scatter of $0.0197\\pm0.0003(1+z)$ in the Skelton et al. (2014)\nphotometric redshifts. Photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitude\nand redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass. The\n1-$\\sigma$ scatter lies between $0.01-0.03$(1+z) for galaxies of all masses and\ncolors below $z<2.5$ (for $H_{F140W}{<}24$), with the exception of a population\nof very red ($U-V > 2$), dusty star-forming galaxies for which the scatter\nincreases to $\\sim0.1(1+z)$. Although the overall photometric redshift accuracy\nfor quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatter\ndepends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type. We verify\nthese trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend the\nanalysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increase\nto $\\sim0.046(1+z)$ at $H_{F160W}=26$. We demonstrate that photometric redshift\naccuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiple\nfilter combinations. We evaluate the widths of redshift probability\ndistribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by a\nfactor of $\\sim1.1-1.6$, but that uniformly broadening the distribution does\nnot adequately account for fitting outliers. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications of these data in planning for current and future surveys and\nsimulate photometric redshift performance in the LSST, DES, and combined DES\nand VHS surveys.\n", "  In this work we focus our attention in the inconsistency that appears when\nthe Semi-Exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for the Dirac field interacting\nwith space-time torsion field is performed. In order to solve this problem, we\npresent a new involution operator that makes possible to perform the exact\ntransformation when torsion field is present. Such operator has a structure,\nwell known in the literature, composed of the product of an operator that acts\nin the matrices space and another one that acts in the function space. We also\npresent the bound state of this theory and discuss the possible experimental\nanalysis.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are complex phenomena. At the heart of an AGN is\na relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nwith an X-ray emitting corona and, sometimes, a relativistic jet. On larger\nscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of\ngas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole\noutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the\nhost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review\narticle, we discuss how X-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of these\ncomponents. We highlight how recent measurements of the high-energy cutoff in\nthe X-ray continuum by NuSTAR are pushing us to conclude that X-ray coronae are\nradiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated by\nelectron-positron pair production. We show that the predominance of\nrapidly-rotating objects in current surveys of SMBH spin is entirely\nunsurprising once one accounts for the observational selection bias resulting\nfrom the spin-dependence of the radiative efficiency. We review recent progress\nin our understanding of fast (v~0.1-0.3c), highly-ionized (mainly visible in\nFeXXV and FeXXVI lines), high-column density winds that may dominate\nquasar-mode galactic feedback. Finally, we end with a brief look forward to the\npromise of Astro-H and future X-ray spectropolarimeters.\n", "  We study the almost Mathieu operator at critical coupling. We prove that\nthere exists a dense $G_\\delta$ set of frequencies for which the spectrum is of\nzero Hausdorff dimension.\n", "  Nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) and eigenvalue communication with the use\nof nonlinear signal spectrum (both discrete and continuous), have been recently\ndiscussed as a promising transmission method to combat fiber nonlinearity\nimpairments. However, because the NFT-based transmission method employs the\nintegrability property of the lossless nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE),\nthe original approach can only be applied directly to optical links with ideal\ndistributed Raman amplification. In this paper, we investigate in details the\nimpact of a non-ideal Raman gain profile on the performance of the nonlinear\ninverse synthesis (NIS) scheme, in which the transmitted information is encoded\ndirectly onto the continuous part of the nonlinear signal spectrum. We propose\nthe lossless path-averaged (LPA) model for fiber links with non-ideal Raman\ngain profile by taking into account the average effect of the Raman gain. We\nshow that the NIS scheme employing the LPA model can offer a performance gain\nof 3 dB regardless of the Raman gain profiles\n", "  Highly integrated single photon sources are key components in future\nquantum-optical circuits. Whereas the probabilistic generation of single\nphotons can routinely be done by now, their triggered generation is a much\ngreater challenge. Here, we describe the triggered generation of single photons\nin a hybrid plasmonic device. It consists of a lambda-type quantum emitter\ncoupled to a multimode optical nanoantenna. For moderate interaction strengths\nbetween the subsystems, the description of the quantum optical evolution can be\nsimplified by an adiabatic elimination of the electromagnetic fields of the\nnanoantenna modes. This leads to an insightful analysis of the emitter's\ndynamics, entails the opportunity to understand the physics of the device, and\nto identify parameter regimes for a desired operation. Even though the approach\npresented in this work is general, we consider a simple exemplary design of a\nplasmonic nanoantenna, made of two silver nanorods, suitable for triggered\ngeneration of single photons.\n", "  We investigate a family of SU(3)$\\times$U(1)$\\times$U(1)-invariant\nholographic flows and Janus solutions obtained from gauged $\\mathcal{N}=8$\nsupergravity in four dimensions. We give complete details of how to use the\nuplift formulae to obtain the corresponding solutions in M theory. While the\nflow solutions appear to be singular from the four-dimensional perspective, we\nfind that the eleven-dimensional solutions are much better behaved and give\nrise to interesting new classes of compactification geometries that are smooth,\nup to orbifolds, in the infra-red limit. Our solutions involve new phases in\nwhich M2 branes polarize partially or even completely into M5 branes. We derive\nthe eleven-dimensional supersymmetries and show that the eleven-dimensional\nequations of motion and BPS equations are indeed satisfied as a consequence of\ntheir four-dimensional counterparts. Apart from elucidating a whole new class\nof eleven-dimensional Janus and flow solutions, our work provides extensive and\nhighly non-trivial tests of the recently-derived uplift formulae.\n", "  There are a variety of nonlinear optical effects including higher harmonic\ngenerations, photovoltaic effects, and nonlinear Kerr rotations. They are\nrealized by the strong light irradiation to materials that results in nonlinear\npolarizations in the electric field. These are of great importance in studying\nthe physics of excited states of the system as well as for applications to\noptical devices and solar cells. Nonlinear properties of materials are usually\ndescribed by the nonlinear susceptibilities $\\chi$'s, which have complex\nexpressions including many matrix elements and energy denominators. On the\nother hand, a nonequilibrium steady state under a electric field periodic in\ntime has a concise description in terms of the Floquet bands of electrons\ndressed by photons. Here, we theoretically show by using the Floquet formalism\nthat various nonlinear optical effects, such as the shift current in\nnoncentrosymmetric materials, photovoltaic Hall response, and photo-induced\nchange of order parameters under the continuous irradiation of monochromatic\nlight, can be described in a unified fashion by topological quantities\ninvolving the Berry connection and Berry curvature. It is found that vector\nfields defined with the Berry connections in the space of momentum and/or\nparameters govern the nonlinear responses. This topological view offers a new\nroute to design the nonlinear optical materials.\n", "  The causal structure of a stochastic process can be more efficiently\ntransmitted via a quantum channel than a classical one, an advantage that\nincreases with codeword length. While previously difficult to compute, we\nexpress the quantum advantage in closed form using spectral decomposition,\nleading to direct computation of the quantum communication cost at all encoding\nlengths, including infinite. This makes clear how finite-codeword compression\nis controlled by the classical process' cryptic order and allows us to analyze\nstructure within the length-asymptotic regime of infinite-cryptic order (and\ninfinite Markov order) processes.\n", "  The \"broad iron spectral features\" are often seen in X-ray spectra of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) and black-hole binaries (BHB). These features may be\nexplained either by the \"relativistic disc reflection\" scenario or the \"partial\ncovering\" scenario: It is hardly possible to determine which model is valid\nfrom time-averaged spectral analysis. Thus, X-ray spectral variability has been\ninvestigated to constrain spectral models. To that end, it is crucial to study\niron structure of BHBs in detail at short time-scales, which is, for the first\ntime, made possible with the Parallel-sum clocking (P-sum) mode of XIS\ndetectors on board Suzaku. This observational mode has a time-resolution of\n7.8~ms as well as a CCD energy-resolution. We have carried out systematic\ncalibration of the P-sum mode, and investigated spectral variability of the BHB\nGRS 1915+105. Consequently, we found that the spectral variability of GRS\n1915+105 does not show iron features at sub-seconds. This is totally different\nfrom variability of AGN such as 1H0707--495, where the variation amplitude\nsignificantly drops at the iron K-energy band. This difference can be naturally\nexplained in the framework of the \"partial covering\" scenario.\n", "  In the framework of the Glauber model as implemented in GLISSANDO 2, we study\nthe fluctuations of flow harmonics in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC\ncentre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The model with wounded nucleons and the\nadmixture of binary collisions leads to reasonable agreement for the\nellipticity and triangularity fluctuations with the experimental data from the\nATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations, verifying the assumption that the initial\neccentricity is approximately proportional to the harmonic flow of charged\nparticles. While the agreement, in particular at the level of event-by-event\ndistributions of eccentricities/flow coefficients in not perfect, it leads to a\nfair (at the level of a few percent for all centralities except the most\nperipheral collisions) description of the scaled standard deviation and the F\nmeasure which involve the four-particle cumulants. We also discuss the case of\nquadrangular flow. Computer scripts that generate our results from the\nGLISSANDO 2 simulations are provided.\n", "  We analyze the resolved stellar populations of the faint stellar system,\nCrater, based on deep optical imaging taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe HST/ACS-based color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of Crater extends $\\sim$4\nmagnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, providing excellent leverage\non Crater's physical properties. Structurally, Crater has a half-light radius\nof $\\sim$20 pc and shows no evidence for tidal distortions. Crater is\nwell-described by a simple stellar population with an age of $\\sim$7.5 Gyr,\n[M/H]$\\sim-1.65$, a M$_{\\star}\\sim10^4$ M$_{\\odot}$, M$_{\\rm V}\\sim -5.3$,\nlocated at a distance of d$\\sim$ 145 kpc, with modest uncertainties in these\nproperties due to differences in the underlying stellar evolution models. The\nsparse sampling of stars above the turnoff and sub-giant branch are likely to\nbe 1.0-1.4 M$_{\\odot}$ binary star systems (blue stragglers) and their evolved\ndescendants, as opposed to intermediate age main sequence stars. Confusion of\nthese populations highlights a substantial challenge in accurately\ncharacterizing sparsely populated stellar systems. Our analysis shows that\nCrater is not a dwarf galaxy, but instead is an unusually young cluster given\nits location in the Milky Way's very outer stellar halo. Crater is similar to\nSMC cluster Lindsay 38, and its position and velocity are in good agreement\nwith observations and models of the Magellanic stream debris, suggesting it may\nhave accreted from the Magellanic Clouds. However, its age and metallicity are\nalso in agreement with the age-metallicity relationships of lower mass dwarf\ngalaxies such as Leo I or Carina. Despite uncertainty over its progenitor\nsystem, Crater appears to have been incorporated into the Galaxy more recently\nthan $z\\sim1$ (8 Gyr ago), providing an important new constraint on the\naccretion history of the Milky Way. [abridged]\n", "  We use modular invariance and crossing symmetry of conformal field theory to\nreveal approximate reflection symmetries in the spectral decompositions of the\npartition function in two dimensions in the limit of large central charge and\nof the four-point function in any dimension in the limit of large scaling\ndimensions $\\Delta_0$ of external operators. We use these symmetries to\nmotivate universal upper bounds on the spectrum and the operator product\nexpansion coefficients, which we then derive by independent techniques. Some of\nthe bounds for four-point functions are valid for finite $\\Delta_0$ as well as\nfor large $\\Delta_0$. We discuss a similar symmetry in a large spacetime\ndimension limit. Finally, we comment on the analogue of the Cardy formula and\nsparse light spectrum condition for the four-point function.\n", "  With high resolution (0.\"25 x 0.\"18) ALMA CO 3-2 observations of the nearby\n(D=21 Mpc, 1\"=102 pc), extremely radio-quiet galaxy NGC1377, we have discovered\na high-velocity, very collimated nuclear outflow which we interpret as a\nmolecular jet with a projected length of +-150 pc. Along the jet axis we find\nstrong velocity reversals where the projected velocity swings from -150 km/s to\n+150 km/s. A simple model of a molecular jet precessing around an axis close to\nthe plane of the sky can reproduce the observations. The velocity of the\noutflowing gas is difficult to constrain due to the velocity reversals but we\nestimate it to be between 240 and 850 km/s and the jet to precess with a period\nP=0.3-1.1 Myr. The CO emission is clumpy along the jet and the total molecular\nmass in the high-velocity (+-(60 to 150 km/s)) gas lies between 2e6 Msun (light\njet) and 2e7 Msun (massive jet). There is also CO emission extending along the\nminor axis of NGC1377. It holds >40% of the flux in NGC1377 and may be a\nslower, wide-angle molecular outflow which is partially entrained by the\nmolecular jet.\n  We discuss the driving mechanism of the molecular jet and suggest that it is\neither powered by a very faint radio jet or by an accretion disk-wind similar\nto those found towards protostars. The nucleus of NGC1377 harbours intense\nembedded activity and we detect emission from vibrationally excited HCN J=4-3\nv_2=1f which is consistent with hot gas and dust. We find large columns of H2\nin the centre of NGC1377 which may be a sign of a high rate of recent gas\ninfall. The dynamical age of the molecular jet is short (<1 Myr), which could\nimply that it is young and consistent with the notion that NGC1377 is caught in\na transient phase of its evolution. However, further studies are required to\ndetermine the age of the molecular jet, its mass and the role it is playing in\nthe growth of the nucleus of NGC1377.\n", "  The advent of the new generation of X-ray telescopes yielded a significant\nstep forward in our understanding of ionised absorption generated in the\naccretion discs of X-ray binaries. It has become evident that these relatively\nweak and narrow absorption features, sporadically present in the X-ray spectra\nof some systems, are actually the signature of equatorial outflows, which might\ncarry away more matter than that being accreted. Therefore, they play a major\nrole in the accretion phenomenon. These outflows (or ionised atmospheres) are\nubiquitous during the softer states but absent during the power-law dominated,\nhard states, suggesting a strong link with the state of the inner accretion\ndisc, presence of the radio-jet and the properties of the central source. Here,\nwe discuss the current understanding of this field.\n", "  We apply the covariant analytic mechanics with the differential forms to the\nDirac field and the gravity with the Dirac field. The covariant analytic\nmechanics treats space and time on an equal footing regarding the differential\nforms as the basic variables. A significant feature of the covariant analytic\nmechanics is that the canonical equations, in addition to the Euler-Lagrange\nequation, are not only manifestly general coordinate covariant but also gauge\ncovariant. Combining our study and the previous works (the scalar field, the\nabelian and non-abelian gauge fields and the gravity without the Dirac field),\nthe applicability of the covariant analytic mechanics is checked for all\nfundamental fields. We study both the first and second order formalism of the\ngravitational field coupled with matters including the Dirac field. It is\nsuggested that gravitation theories including higher order curvatures cannot be\ntreated by the second order formalism in the covariant analytic mechanics.\n", "  Recently, Lechner, Hauke and Zoller [Science Advances, 1(9)e1500838, (2015)]\nhave proposed a quantum annealing architecture, in which a classical spin glass\nwith all-to-all connectivity is simulated by a spin glass with geometrically\nlocal interactions. We interpret this architecture as a classical\nerror-correcting code, which is highly robust against weakly correlated\nbit-flip noise, and we analyze the code's performance using a\nbelief-propagation decoding algorithm. Our observations may also apply to more\ngeneral encoding schemes and noise models.\n", "  This paper discusses the transition to fast growth of the tearing instability\nin thin current sheets in the collisionless limit where electron inertia drives\nthe reconnection process. It has been previously suggested that in resistive\nMHD there is a natural maximum aspect ratio (ratio of sheet length and breadth\nto thickness) which may be reached for current sheets with a macroscopic length\nL, the limit being provided by the fact that the tearing mode growth time\nbecomes of the same order as the Alfv\\`en time calculated on the macroscopic\nscale (Pucci and Velli (2014)). For current sheets with a smaller aspect ratio\nthan critical the normalized growth rate tends to zero with increasing\nLundquist number S, while for current sheets with an aspect ratio greater than\ncritical the growth rate diverges with S. Here we carry out a similar analysis\nbut with electron inertia as the term violating magnetic flux conservation:\npreviously found scalings of critical current sheet aspect ratios with the\nLundquist number are generalized to include the dependence on the ratio\n$(d_e/L)^2$ where de is the electron skin depth, and it is shown that there are\nlimiting scalings which, as in the resistive case, result in reconnecting modes\ngrowing on ideal time scales. Finite Larmor Radius effects are then included\nand the rescaling argument at the basis of \"ideal\" reconnection is proposed to\nexplain secondary fast reconnection regimes naturally appearing in numerical\nsimulations of current sheet evolution.\n", "  Free-electron lasers (FELs) produce short and very intense light pulses in\nthe XUV and x-ray regimes. We investigate the possibility to drive Rabi\noscillations in xenon with an intense FEL pulse by using the unusually large\ndipole strength of the giant-dipole resonance (GDR). The GDR decays within less\nthan 30 as due to its position, which is above the $4d$ ionization threshold.\nWe find that intensities around 10$^{18}$ W/cm$^2$ are required to induce Rabi\noscillations with a period comparable to the lifetime. The pulse duration\nshould not exceed 100 as because xenon will be fully ionized within a few\nlifetimes. Rabi oscillations reveal themselves also in the photoelectron\nspectrum in form of Autler-Townes splittings extending over several tens of\nelectronvolt.\n", "  We suggest an extension of the gauge principle which includes tensor gauge\nfields. In this extension of the Yang-Mills theory the vector gauge boson\nbecomes a member of a bigger family of gauge bosons of arbitrary large integer\nspins. The proposed extension is essentially based on the extension of the\nPoincar\\'e algebra and the existence of an appropriate transversal\nrepresentations. The invariant Lagrangian is expressed in terms of new\nhigher-rank field strength tensors. It does not contain higher derivatives of\ntensor gauge fields and all interactions take place through three- and\nfour-particle exchanges with a dimensionless coupling constant. We calculated\nthe scattering amplitudes of non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons at tree level, as\nwell as their one-loop contribution into the Callan-Symanzik beta function.\nThis contribution is negative and corresponds to the asymptotically free\ntheory. Considering the contribution of tensorgluons of all spins into the beta\nfunction we found that it is leading to the theory which is conformally\ninvariant at very high energies. The proposed extension may lead to a natural\ninclusion of the standard theory of fundamental forces into a larger theory in\nwhich vector gauge bosons, leptons and quarks represent a low-spin subgroup. We\nconsider a possibility that inside the proton and, more generally, inside\nhadrons there are additional partons - tensorgluons, which can carry a part of\nthe proton momentum. The extension of QCD influences the unification scale at\nwhich the coupling constants of the Standard Model merge, shifting its value to\nlower energies.\n", "  We consider a model for the low-luminosity gamma-ray burst GRB 060218 that\nplausibly accounts for multiwavelength observations to day 20. The model\ncomponents are: (1) a long-lived ($t_j \\sim 3000$ s) central engine and\naccompanying low-luminosity ($L_j \\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), semirelativistic\n($\\gamma \\sim 10$) jet; (2) a low-mass ($ \\sim 10^{-2} M_\\odot$) envelope\nsurrounding the progenitor star; and (3) a modest amount of dust ($A_V \\sim\n0.1$ mag) in the interstellar environment. Blackbody emission from the\ntransparency radius in a low-power jet outflow can fit the prompt thermal X-ray\nemission, and the nonthermal X-rays and gamma-rays may be produced via Compton\nscattering of thermal photons from hot leptons in the jet interior or the\nexternal shocks. The later mildly relativistic phase of this outflow can\nproduce the radio emission via synchrotron radiation from the forward shock.\nMeanwhile, interaction of the associated SN 2006aj with a circumstellar\nenvelope extending to $\\sim10^{13}$ cm can explain the early optical emission.\nThe X-ray afterglow can be interpreted as a light echo of the prompt emission\nfrom dust at $\\sim 30$ pc. Our model is a plausible alternative to that of\nNakar, who recently proposed shock breakout of a jet smothered by an extended\nenvelope as the source of prompt emission. Both our results and Nakar's suggest\nthat bursts such as GRB 060218 may originate from unusual progenitors with\nextended circumstellar envelopes, and that a jet is necessary to decouple the\nprompt emission from the supernova.\n", "  We adapt the transfer matrix ($\\T$-matrix) method originally designed for\none-dimensional quantum mechanical problems to solve the circularly symmetric\ntwo-dimensional problem of graphene quantum dots. In similarity to\none-dimensional problems, we show that the generalized $\\T$-matrix contains\nrich information about the physical properties of these quantum dots. In\nparticular, it is shown that the spectral equations for bound states as well as\nquasi-bound states of a circular graphene quantum dot and related quantities\nsuch as the local density of states and the scattering coefficients are all\nexpressed exactly in terms of the $\\T$-matrix for the radial confinement\npotential. As an example, we use the developed formalism to analyse physical\naspects of a graphene quantum dot induced by a trapezoidal radial potential.\nAmong the obtained results, it is in particular suggested that the thermal\nfluctuations and electrostatic disorders may appear as an obstacle to\ncontrolling the valley polarization of Dirac electrons.\n", "  Entangled multipartite states are resources for universal quantum\ncomputation, but they can also give rise to ensembles of unitary\ntransformations, a topic usually studied in the context of random quantum\ncircuits. Using several graph state techniques, we show that these resources\ncan `derandomize' circuit results by sampling the same kinds of ensembles\nquantum mechanically, (analogously to a quantum random number generator).\nFurthermore, we find simple examples that give rise to new ensembles whose\nstatistical moments exactly match those of the uniformly random distribution\nover all unitaries up to order $t$, while foregoing adaptive feed-forward\nentirely. Such ensembles -- known as $t$-designs -- often cannot be\ndistinguished from the `truly' random ensemble, and so they find use in many\napplications that require this implied notion of pseudorandomness.\n", "  Fibonacci anyons are non-Abelian particles for which braiding is universal\nfor quantum computation. Reichardt has shown how to systematically generate\nnontrivial braids for three Fibonacci anyons which yield unitary operations\nwith off-diagonal matrix elements that can be made arbitrarily small in a\nparticular natural basis through a simple and efficient iterative procedure.\nThis procedure does not require brute force search, the Solovay-Kitaev method,\nor any other numerical technique, but the phases of the resulting diagonal\nmatrix elements cannot be directly controlled. We show that despite this lack\nof control the resulting braids can be used to systematically construct\nentangling gates for two qubits encoded by Fibonacci anyons.\n", "  The study of superconductivity arising from doping a Mott insulator has\nbecome a central issue in the area of superconductivity. Within the framework\nof the kinetic-energy-driven superconducting mechanism, we discuss the\nthermodynamic properties in triangular-lattice superconductors. It is shown\nthat a sharp peak in the specific-heat appears at the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc, and then the specific-heat varies exponentially as a\nfunction of temperature for the temperatures T<Tc due to the absence of the\nd-wave gap nodes at the charge-carrier Fermi surface. In particular, the upper\ncritical field follows qualitatively the charge-carrier pair gap type\ntemperature dependence, and has the same dome-shaped doping dependence as Tc.\n", "  In a recent paper we showed that the electroweak chiral Lagrangian at leading\norder is equivalent to the conventional $\\kappa$ formalism used by ATLAS and\nCMS to test Higgs anomalous couplings. Here we apply this fact to fit the\nlatest Higgs data. The new aspect of our analysis is a systematic\ninterpretation of the fit parameters within an EFT. Concentrating on the\nprocesses of Higgs production and decay that have been measured so far, six\nparameters turn out to be relevant: $c_V$, $c_t$, $c_b$, $c_\\tau$,\n$c_{\\gamma\\gamma}$, $c_{gg}$. A global Bayesian fit is then performed with the\nresult: $c_{V} = 0.98 \\pm 0.09$, $c_{t} = 1.34 \\pm 0.19$, $c_{b} = 0.78 \\pm\n0.18$, $c_{\\tau} = 0.92 \\pm 0.14$, $c_{\\gamma\\gamma} = -0.24 \\pm 0.37$, $c_{gg}\n= -0.30 \\pm 0.17$. Additionally, we show how this leading-order parametrization\ncan be generalized to next-to-leading order, thus improving the $\\kappa$\nformalism systematically. The differences with a linear EFT analysis including\noperators of dimension six are also discussed. One of the main conclusions of\nour analysis is that since the conventional $\\kappa$ formalism can be properly\njustified within a QFT framework, it should continue to play a central role in\nanalyzing and interpreting Higgs data.\n", "  The Higgs portal to scalar Dark Matter is considered in the context of\nnon-linearly realised electroweak symmetry breaking. We determine the dominant\ninteractions of gauge bosons and the physical Higgs particle $h$ to a scalar\nsinglet dark matter candidate. Phenomenological consequences are also studied\nin detail, including the possibility of distinguishing this scenario from the\nstandard Higgs portal in which the electroweak symmetry breaking is linearly\nrealised. Two features of significant impact are: i) the connection between the\nelectroweak scale $v$ and the Higgs particle departs from the $(v+h)$\nfunctional dependence, as the Higgs field is not necessarily an exact\nelectroweak doublet; ii) the presence of specific couplings that arise at\ndifferent order in the non-linear and in the linear expansions. These facts\ndeeply affect the dark matter relic abundance, as well as the expected signals\nin direct and indirect searches and collider phenomenology, where Dark Matter\nproduction rates are enhanced with respect to the standard portal.\n", "  We construct numerically static vortex solutions in a holographic model of\ntwo-band superconductor with an interband Josephson coupling in both the\nsuperfluid and superconductor regime. We investigate the effects of the\ninterband coupling on the order parameter of each superconducting band in the\nvortex solution, and we find that it is different for each of the two bands. We\ncompute also the free energy, critical magnetic field, magnetic penetration\nlength and coherence lengths for the two bands, and we study their dependence\non the interband coupling and temperature. Interestingly, we find that the\ncoherence lengths of the two bands are close to identical.\n", "  We test the imprint of f(R) modified gravity on the halo mass function, using\nN-body simulations and a theoretical model developed in (Kopp et al. 2013). We\nfind a very good agreement between theory and simulations. We extend the\ntheoretical model to the conditional mass function and apply it to the\nprediction of the linear halo bias in f(R) gravity. Using the halo model we\nobtain a prediction for the non-linear matter power spectrum accurate to ~10%\nat z=0 and up to k=2h/Mpc. We also study halo profiles for the f(R) models and\nfind a deviation from the standard general relativity result up to 40%,\ndepending on the halo masses and redshift. This has not been pointed out in\nprevious analysis. Finally we study the number density and profiles of voids\nidentified in these f(R) N-body simulations. We underline the effect of the\nbias and the sampling to identify voids. We find significant deviation from GR\nwhen measuring the f(R) void profiles with fR0<-10^{-6}.\n", "  We use a set of high-resolution N-body simulations of the Galactic disk to\nstudy its interactions with the population of satellites predicted\ncosmologically. One simulation illustrates that multiple passages of massive\nsatellites with different velocities through the disk generate a wobble, having\nthe appearance of rings in face-on projections of the stellar disk. They also\nproduce flares in the disk outer parts and gradually heat the disk through\nbending waves. A different numerical experiment shows that an individual\nsatellite as massive as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy passing through the disk\nwill drive coupled horizontal and vertical oscillations of stars in underdense\nregions, with small significant associated heating. This experiment shows that\nvertical excursions of stars in these low-density regions can exceed 1 kpc in\nthe Solar neighborhood, resembling the coherent vertical oscillations recently\ndetected locally. They can also induce non-zero vertical streaming motions as\nlarge as 10-20 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with recent observations in the Galactic\ndisk. This phenomenon appears as a local ring, with modest associated disk\nheating.\n", "  We examine the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model for a variety of maximum\nspeeds. We show that the low density limit can be described as a dilute gas of\nvehicles with a repulsive core. At the transition to jamming, we observe\nfinite-size effects in a variety of quantities describing the flow and the\ndensity correlations, but only if the maximum speed $V_{\\text{max}}$ is larger\nthan a certain value. A finite-size scaling analysis of several order\nparameters shows universal behavior, with scaling exponents that depend on\n$V_{\\text{max}}$. The jamming transition at large $V_{\\text{max}}$ can be\nviewed as the nucleation of jams in a background of freely flowing vehicles.\nFor small $V_{\\text{max}}$ no such clean separation into jammed and free\nvehicles is possible.\n", "  A virtual learning environment can engage university students in the learning\nprocess in ways that the traditional lectures and lab formats can not. We\npresent our virtual learning environment \\emph{StudentResearcher} which\nincorporates simulations, multiple-choice quizzes, video lectures and\ngamification into a learning path for quantum mechanics at the advanced\nuniversity level. \\emph{StudentResearcher} is built upon the experiences\ngathered from workshops with the citizen science game Quantum Moves at the\nhigh-school and university level, where the games were used extensively to\nillustrate the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. The first test of this new\nvirtual learning environment was a 2014 course in advanced quantum mechanics at\nAarhus University with 47 enrolled students. We found increased learning for\nthe students who were more active on the platform independent of their previous\nperformances.\n", "  We present a new model of patchy particles in which the interaction sites can\nbe activated or deactivated by varying the temperature of the system. We study\nthe thermodynamics of the system by means of Wertheim's first order\nperturbation theory, and use Flory-Stockmayer theory of polymerization to\nanalyse the percolation threshold. We find a very rich phase behaviour\nincluding lower critical points and reentrant percolation.\n", "  One can obtain very large classes of horizonless microstate geometries\ncorresponding to near-extremal black holes by placing probe supertubes whose\naction has metastable minima inside certain supersymmetric bubbling solutions.\nWe show that these minima can lower their energy when the bubbles move in\ncertain directions in the moduli space, which implies that these near-extremal\nmicrostates are in fact unstable once one considers the dynamics of all their\ndegrees of freedom. The decay of these solutions corresponds to Hawking\nradiation, and we compare the emission rate and frequency to those of the\ncorresponding black hole. Our analysis supports the expectation that generic\nnon-extremal black holes microstate geometries should be unstable. It also\nestablishes the existence of a new type of instabilities for antibranes in\nhighly-warped regions with charge dissolved in fluxes.\n", "  Soft supersymmetry-breaking terms provide a wealth of new potential sources\nof flavour violation, which are tightly constrained by precision experiments.\nThis has posed a challenge to construct flavour models which both explain the\nstructure of the Standard Model Yukawa couplings and also predict soft-breaking\npatterns that are compatible with these constraints. While such models have\nbeen studied in great detail, the impact of flavour violating soft terms on the\nHiggs mass at the two-loop level has been assumed to be small or negligible. In\nthis letter, we show that large flavour violation in the up-squark sector can\ngive a positive or negative mass shift to the SM-like Higgs of several GeV,\nwithout being in conflict with other observations. We investigate in which\nregions of the parameter space these effects can be expected.\n", "  Holographic Ricci dark energy has been proposed ago has faced with problems\nof future singularity. In the present work we consider the Ricci dark energy\nwith an additive constant in it's density as running vacuum energy. We have\nanalytically solved the Friedmann equations and also the role played by the\ngeneral conservation law followed by the cosmic components together. We have\nshown that the running vacuum energy status of the Ricci dark energy helps to\nremove the possible future singularity in the model. The additive constant in\nthe density of the running vacuum played an important role, such that, without\nthat, the model predicts either eternal deceleration or eternal acceleration.\nBut along with the additive constant, equivalent to a cosmological constant,\nthe model predicts a late time acceleration in the expansion of the universe,\nand in the far future of the evolution it tends to de Sitter universe.\n", "  Universal exact conditions guided the construction of most ground-state\ndensity functional approximations in use today. We derive the relation between\nthe entropy and Mermin free energy density functionals for thermal density\nfunctional theory. Both the entropy and sum of kinetic and electron-electron\nrepulsion functionals are shown to be monotonically increasing with\ntemperature, while the Mermin functional is concave downwards. Analogous\nrelations are found for both exchange and correlation. The importance of these\nconditions is illustrated in two extremes: the Hubbard dimer and the uniform\ngas.\n", "  A linear response function (LRF) determines the mean-response of a nonlinear\nclimate system to weak imposed forcings, and an eddy flux matrix (EFM)\ndetermines the eddy momentum and heat flux responses to mean-flow changes.\nNeither LRF nor EFM can be calculated from first principles due the lack of a\ncomplete theory for turbulent eddies. Here the LRF and EFM for an idealized dry\natmosphere are computed by applying numerous localized weak forcings, one at a\ntime, to a GCM with Held-Suarez physics and calculating the mean-responses. The\nLRF and EFM for zonally-averaged responses are then constructed using these\nforcings and responses through matrix inversion. Tests demonstrate that LRF and\nEFM are fairly accurate. Spectral analysis of the LRF shows that the most\nexcitable dynamical mode, the neutral vector, strongly resembles the model's\nAnnular Mode. The framework described here can be employed to compute the\nLRF/EFM for zonally-asymmetric responses and more complex GCMs. The potential\napplications of the LRF/EFM constructed here are i) forcing a specified\nmean-flow for hypothesis-testing, ii) isolating/quantifying the eddy-feedbacks\nin complex eddy-mean flow interaction problems, and iii) evaluating/improving\nmore generally-applicable methods currently used to construct LRFs or diagnose\neddy-feedbacks in comprehensive GCMs or observations. As an example for iii, in\nPart 2, the LRF is also computed using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\n(FDT), and the previously-calculated LRF is exploited to investigate why FDT\nperforms poorly in some cases. It is shown that dimension-reduction using\nleading EOFs, which is commonly used to construct LRFs from the FDT, can\nsignificantly degrade the accuracy due to the non-normality of the operator.\n", "  We report small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on aqueous\ndispersions of colloidal silica with a broad monomodal size distribution\n(polydispersity 18%, size 8 nm). Over a range of volume fractions the silica\nparticles segregate to build first one, then two distinct sets of colloidal\ncrystals. These dispersions thus demonstrate fractional crystallization and\nmultiple-phase (bcc, Laves AB$_2$, liquid) coexistence. Their remarkable\nability to build complex crystal structures from a polydisperse population\noriginates from the intermediate-range nature of interparticle forces, and\nsuggests routes for designing self-assembling colloidal crystals from the\nbottom-up.\n", "  We propose a realization of mass varying neutrino dark energy in two\nextensions of the Standard Model (SM) with a dynamical neutrino mass related to\nthe acceleron field while satisfying the naturalness. In the first scenario the\nSM is extended to include a TeV scale scalar Higgs triplet ($\\xi$) and a TeV\nscale second Higgs doublet ($\\eta$), while in the second scenario an extension\nof the SM with fermion triplet $(\\Sigma)$ is considered. We also point out the\npossible leptogenesis mechanisms for simultaneously generating the observed\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe in both the scenarios and discuss the collider\nsignatures for the TeV scale new fields which make these models testable in the\ncurrent run of LHC.\n", "  We present a rigorous theory of the inverse scattering transform (IST) for\nthe three-component defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with\ninitial conditions approaching constant values with the same amplitude as\n$x\\to\\pm\\infty$. The theory combines and extends to a problem with non-zero\nboundary conditions three fundamental ideas: (i) the tensor approach used by\nBeals, Deift and Tomei for $n$-th order scattering problems, (ii) the\ntriangular decompositions of the scattering matrix used by Novikov, Manakov,\nPitaevski and Zakharov for the $N$-wave interaction equations, and (iii) a\ngeneralization of the cross product via the Hodge star duality, which, to the\nbest of our knowledge, is used in the context of the IST for the first time in\nthis work. The combination of the first two ideas allows us to rigorously\nobtain a fundamental set of analytic eigenfunctions. The third idea allows us\nto establish the symmetries of the eigenfunctions and scattering data. The\nresults are used to characterize the discrete spectrum and to obtain exact\nsoliton solutions, which describe generalizations of the so-called dark-bright\nsolitons of the two-component NLS equation.\n", "  The dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate are examined numerically in the\npresence of a one-dimensional bichromatic optical lattice with external\nharmonic confinement. The condensate is excited by a focusing red laser. For\nthis purpose, the time-dependent Gross Pitaevskii equation is solved using the\nCrank Nicolson method in real time. Two realizations of the optical lattice are\nconsidered, one with a rational and the other with an irrational ratio of the\ntwo constituting wave lengths. For a weak bichromatic optical lattice, the\nlong-time averaged physical observables of the condensate respond only very\nweakly (or not at all) to changes in the secondary optical lattice depth.\nHowever, for a much larger strength of the latter optical lattice, the response\nis stronger. It is found that qualitatively there is no difference between the\ndynamics of the condensate resulting from the use of a rational or irrational\nratio of the optical lattice wavelengths since the external harmonic trap\nwashes it out. It is further found that in the presence of an external harmonic\ntrap, the bichromatic optical lattice acts in favor of superflow.\n", "  Granular material flowing on complex topographies are ubiquitous in\nindustrial and geophysical situations. In this paper, we study the small-scale\nmodel of a granular layer flowing on a rough incline. The shape of a granular\nfront is solved analytically by using a 1D Savage-Hutter's model based on\ndepth-averaged mass and momentum equations with the fractional expression for\nthe frictional rheology $\\mu(I)$. Unlike previous studies where a \"plug flow\"\nis assumed, a free shape factor $\\alpha$ describing the vertical velocity\nprofile, is taken into account to determine the solution. Such a way, we put in\nevidence an effect of inertia through the Froude number Fr and the shape factor\n$\\alpha$ on the front profile. The analytical predictions are compared with\nexperimental results published by [O. Pouliquen, Phys. Fluids 11, 1956 (1999)]\nand with our new experimental data obtained at higher Froude numbers. A good\nagreement between theory and experiments is found when $\\alpha$ = 5/4 is used\nin our model, corresponding to a Bagnold-like velocity profile. However, open\nquestions are raised about the vertical velocity profile in granular flows and\nabout the expression of the rheological function $\\mu(I)$ and its calibration\nfrom experimental data.\n", "  Nitrate ion spikes in polar ice cores are contentiously used to estimate the\nintensity, frequency, and probability of historical solar proton events,\nquantities that are needed to prepare for potentially society-crippling space\nweather events. We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model to\ncalculate how large an event would have to be to produce enough odd nitrogen\nthroughout the atmosphere to be discernible as nitrate peaks at the Earth's\nsurface. These hypothetically large events are compared with probability of\noccurrence estimates derived from measured events, sunspot records, and\ncosmogenic radionuclides archives. We conclude that the fluence and spectrum of\nsolar proton events necessary to produce odd nitrogen enhancements equivalent\nto the spikes of nitrate ions in Greenland ice cores are unlikely to have\noccurred throughout the Holocene, confirming that nitrate ions in ice cores are\nnot suitable proxies for historical individual solar proton events.\n", "  We study the effective dynamics of black hole horizons in Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory in a large number of spacetime dimensions $D$. We demonstrate that\nhorizon dynamics may be recast as a well posed initial value problem for the\nmotion of a codimension one non gravitational membrane moving in flat space.\nThe dynamical degrees of freedom of this membrane are its shape, charge density\nand a divergence free velocity field. We determine the equations that govern\nmembrane dynamics at leading order in the large $D$ expansion. Our derivation\nof the membrane equations assumes that the solution preserves an SO$(D-p-2)$\nisometry with $p$ held fixed as $D$ is taken to infinity. However we are able\nto cast our final membrane equations into a completely geometric form that\nmakes no reference to this symmetry algebra.\n", "  Scanning transmission x-ray microscopy is employed to investigate\nexperimentally the reversal of the magnetic vortex core polarity in cylindrical\nNi81Fe19 nanodisks triggered by two orthogonal monopolar magnetic field pulses\nwith peak amplitude $B_0$, pulse length ${\\tau}$=60 ps and delay time\n${\\Delta}$t in the range from -400 ps to +400 ps between the two pulses. The\ntwo pulses are oriented in-plane in the x- and y-direction. We have\nexperimentally studied vortex core reversal as function of $B_0$ and\n${\\Delta}$t. The resulting phase diagram shows large regions of unidirectional\nvortex core switching where the switching threshold is modulated due to\nresonant amplification of azimuthal spin waves. The switching behavior changes\ndramatically depending on whether the first pulse is applied in the x- or the\ny-direction. This asymmetry can be reproduced by three-dimensional\nmicromagnetic simulations but not by two-dimensional simulations. This behavior\ndemonstrates that in contrast to previous experiments on vortex core reversal\nthe three-dimensionality in the dynamics is essential here.\n", "  The observability of primordial cosmic fluctuations does not require a\ngeometric horizon $H^{-1}$, which is exceeded temporarily by the wavelength of\nfluctuations. The primordial information can be protected against later thermal\nwashout even if all relevant wavelengths remain smaller than $H^{-1}$. This is\ndemonstrated by formulating the equations governing the cosmic fluctuations in\na form that is manifestly invariant under conformal field transformations of\nthe metric. Beyond the field equations this holds for the defining equation for\nthe correlation function, as expressed by the inverse of the second functional\nderivative of the quantum effective action. An observable almost scale\ninvariant spectrum does not need an expanding geometry. For a variable Planck\nmass it can even arise in flat Minkowski space.\n", "  What is information originating in observation? Until now it has no\nscientifically conclusive definition. Information is memorized entropy cutting\nin random observations which processing interactions. Randomness of various\ninteractive observations is source of entropy as uncertainty. Observation under\nrandom 1-0 impulses probabilities reveals hidden correlation which connects\nBayesian probabilities increasing each posterior correlation. That sequentially\nreduces relational entropy conveying probabilistic casualty with temporal\nmemory of correlations which interactive impulse innately cuts. Within hidden\ncorrelation emerges reversible time space microprocess with conjugated\nentangled entropy which probing impulse intentionally cuts and memorizes\ninformation as certainty. Sequential interactive cuts integrates cutting\ninformation in information macroprocess with irreversible time course.\nMemorized information binds reversible microprocess within impulse with\nirreversible information macroprocess. Observer probes collect cutting\ninformation data bits of observing frequencies impulses. Each impulse cuts\nmaximum of impulse minimal information performing dual max-min principle of\nconverting process entropy to information through uncertain gap. Multiple\nnaturally encoding bits moving in macroprocess join triplet macrounits which\nlogically organize information networks encoding macrounits in structures\nenclosing triplet code. Network time space distributed structure self renews\nand cooperates information decreasing its complexity. Integrating process\nentropy functional and bits information in information path integral embraces\nvariation minimax law which determines processes regularities. Solving problem\nmathematically describes micro macro processes, network, and invariant\nconditions of observer network self replication.\n", "  We study the collider phenomenology of the electroweak phase transition and\nelectroweak baryogenesis in the framework of the effective field theory. Our\nstudy shows that the effective theory using the dimension-6 operators can\nenforce strong first order phase transition and provide sizable CP violation to\nrealize a successful electroweak baryogenesis. Such dimension-6 operators can\ninduce interesting Higgs phenomenology that can be verified at colliders such\nas the LHC and the planning CEPC. We then demonstrate that this effective\ntheory can originate from vector-like quarks and the triplet Higgs.\n", "  We introduce and explore \"paired\" cosmological simulations. A pair consists\nof an A and B simulation with initial conditions related by the inversion\n$\\delta_A(x, t_{initial})=-\\delta_B(x,t_{initial})$ (underdensities substituted\nfor overdensities and vice versa). We argue that the technique is valuable for\nimproving our understanding of cosmic structure formation. The A and B fields\nare by definition equally likely draws from {\\Lambda}CDM initial conditions,\nand in the linear regime evolve identically up to the overall sign. As\nnon-linear evolution takes hold, a region that collapses to form a halo in\nsimulation A will tend to expand to create a void in simulation B. Applications\ninclude (i) contrasting the growth of A-halos and B-voids to test excursion-set\ntheories of structure formation; (ii) cross-correlating the density field of\nthe A and B universes as a novel test for perturbation theory; and (iii)\ncanceling error terms by averaging power spectra between the two boxes.\nGeneralizations of the method to more elaborate field transformations are\nsuggested.\n", "  We present MUSE observations in the core of the HFF galaxy cluster MACS\nJ1149.5+2223, where the first magnified and spatially-resolved multiple images\nof SN 'Refsdal' at redshift 1.489 were detected. Thanks to a DDT program with\nthe VLT and the extraordinary efficiency of MUSE, we measure 117 secure\nredshifts with just 4.8 hours of total integration time on a single target\npointing. We spectroscopically confirm 68 galaxy cluster members, with redshift\nvalues ranging from 0.5272 to 0.5660, and 18 multiple images belonging to 7\nbackground, lensed sources distributed in redshifts between 1.240 and 3.703.\nStarting from the combination of our catalog with those obtained from extensive\nspectroscopic and photometric campaigns using the HST, we select a sample of\n300 (164 spectroscopic and 136 photometric) cluster members, within\napproximately 500 kpc from the BCG, and a set of 88 reliable multiple images\nassociated to 10 different background source galaxies and 18 distinct knots in\nthe spiral galaxy hosting SN 'Refsdal'. We exploit this valuable information to\nbuild 6 detailed strong lensing models, the best of which reproduces the\nobserved positions of the multiple images with a rms offset of only 0.26\". We\nuse these models to quantify the statistical and systematic errors on the\npredicted values of magnification and time delay of the next emerging image of\nSN 'Refsdal'. We find that its peak luminosity should should occur between\nMarch and June 2016, and should be approximately 20% fainter than the dimmest\n(S4) of the previously detected images but above the detection limit of the\nplanned HST/WFC3 follow-up. We present our two-dimensional reconstruction of\nthe cluster mass density distribution and of the SN 'Refsdal' host galaxy\nsurface brightness distribution. We outline the roadmap towards even better\nstrong lensing models with a synergetic MUSE and HST effort.\n", "  We study whether the tachyon mode exists as a physical fluctuation on the\n2-brane solution and on the tachyon vacuum solution in cubic open string field\ntheory. Our analysis is based on the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We first\nconstruct a set of six string states which corresponds to the set of fields and\nanti-fields containing the tachyon field. Whether the tachyon field can exist\nas a physical fluctuation is determined by the 6x6 matrix defining the\nanti-bracket in the present sector. If the matrix is degenerate/non-degenerate,\nthe tachyon field is physical/unphysical. Calculations for the pure-gauge type\nsolutions in the framework of the KBc algebra and using the Ke-regularization\nlead to the expected results. Namely, the matrix for the anti-bracket is\ndegenerate/non-degenerate in the case of the 2-brane/tachyon-vacuum solution.\nOur analysis is not complete, in particular, in that we have not identified the\nfour-fold degeneracy of tachyon fluctuation on the 2-brane solution, and\nmoreover that the present six states do not satisfy the hermiticity condition.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection requires, at least locally, a non-ideal plasma\nresponse. In collisionless space and astrophysical plasmas, turbulence could\npermit this instead of the too rare binary collisions. We investigated the\ninfluence of turbulence on the reconnection rate in the framework of a single\nfluid compressible MHD approach. The goal is to find out, whether unresolved,\nsub-grid for MHD simulations, turbulence can enhance the reconnection process\nin high Reynolds number astrophysical plasma. We solve, simultaneously with the\ngrid-scale MHD equations, evolution equations for the sub-grid turbulent energy\nand cross helicity according to Yokoi's model (Yokoi (2013)) where turbulence\nis self-generated and -sustained through the inhomogeneities of the mean\nfields. Simulations of Harris and force free sheets confirm the results of\nHigashimori et al. (2013) and new results are obtained about the dependence on\nresistivity for large Reynolds number as well as guide field effects. The\namount of energy transferred from large to the small scales is enhanced in case\nof fast turbulent reconnection and energy spectra are used to interpret the\nobtained regime of reconnection controlled by the turbulence timescale\n$\\tau_t$. The overall process is even faster for larger Reynolds numbers\ncontrolled by the background molecular resistivity $\\eta$, as long as the\ninitial level of turbulence is not too large. This implies that turbulence\nplays an important role on fast reconnection at situation of large Reynolds\nnumber while the amplitude of turbulence can still be small.\n", "  Reflected light curves observed for exoplanets indicate bright clouds at some\nof them. We estimate how the light curve and total stellar heating of a planet\ndepend on forward and backward scattering in the clouds based on Pioneer and\nCassini spacecraft images of Jupiter and Saturn. We fit analytical functions to\nthe local reflected brightnesses of Jupiter and Saturn depending on the\nplanet's phase. These observations cover broad bands at 0.59-0.72 and 0.39-0.5\n{\\mu}m, and narrow bands at 0.938 (atmospheric window), 0.889 (CH4 absorption\nband), and 0.24-0.28 {\\mu}m. We simulate the images of the planets with a\nray-tracing model, and disk-integrate them to produce the full-orbit light\ncurves. For Jupiter, we also fit the modeled light curves to the observed\nfull-disk brightness. We derive spherical albedos for Jupiter, Saturn, and for\nplanets with Lambertian and Rayleigh-scattering atmospheres. Jupiter-like\natmospheres can produce light curves that are a factor of two fainter at\nhalf-phase than the Lambertian planet, given the same geometric albedo at\ntransit. The spherical albedo is typically lower than for a Lambertian planet\nby up to a factor of 1.5. The Lambertian assumption will underestimate the\nabsorption of the stellar light and the equilibrium temperature of the\nplanetary atmosphere. We also compare our light curves with the light curves of\nsolid bodies: the moons Enceladus and Callisto. Their strong backscattering\npeak within a few degrees of opposition (secondary eclipse) can lead to an even\nstronger underestimate of the stellar heating.\n", "  An overview is presented of the H$_2$ quasar absorption method to search for\na possible variation of the proton--electron mass ratio $\\mu=m_p/m_e$ on a\ncosmological time scale. Details of the analysis of astronomical spectra,\nobtained with large 8--10 m class optical telescopes, equipped with\nhigh-resolution echelle grating based spectrographs, are explained. The methods\nand results of the laboratory molecular spectroscopy of H$_2$, in particular\nthe laser-based metrology studies for the determination of rest wavelengths of\nthe Lyman and Werner band absorption lines, are reviewed. Theoretical physics\nscenarios delivering a rationale for a varying $\\mu$ will be discussed briefly,\nas well as alternative spectroscopic approaches to probe variation of $\\mu$,\nother than the H$_2$ method. Also a recent approach to detect a dependence of\nthe proton-to-electron mass ratio on environmental conditions, such as the\npresence of strong gravitational fields, will be highlighted. Currently some 56\nH$_2$ absorption systems are known and listed. Their usefulness to detect\n$\\mu$-variation is discussed, in terms of column densities and brightness of\nbackground quasar sources, along with future observational strategies. The\nastronomical observations of ten quasar systems analyzed so far set a\nconstraint on a varying proton-electron mass ratio of $|\\Delta\\mu/\\mu| < 5\n\\times 10^{-6}$ (3-$\\sigma$), which is a null result, holding for redshifts in\nthe range $z=2.0-4.2$. This corresponds to look-back times of 10--12.4 billion\nyears into cosmic history. Attempts to interpret the results from these 10\nH$_2$ absorbers in terms of a spatial variation of $\\mu$ are currently hampered\nby the small sample size and their coincidental distribution in a relatively\nnarrow band across the sky.\n", "  Time-averaged two-point currents are derived and shown to be spatially\ninvariant within domains of local translation or inversion symmetry for\narbitrary time-periodic quantum systems in one dimension. These currents are\nshown to provide a valuable tool for detecting deformations of a spatial\nsymmetry in static and driven lattices. In the static case the invariance of\nthe two-point currents is related to the presence of time-reversal invariance\nand/or probability current conservation. The obtained insights into the\nwavefunctions are further exploited for a symmetry-based convergence check\nwhich is applicable for globally broken but locally retained potential\nsymmetries.\n", "  We explore the propagation and transformation of electromagnetic waves\nthrough spatially homogeneous yet smoothly time-dependent media within the\nframework of classical electrodynamics. By modelling the smooth transition,\noccurring during a finite period {\\tau}, as a phenomenologically realistic and\nsigmoidal change of the dielectric permittivity, an analytically exact solution\nto Maxwell's equations is derived for the electric displacement in terms of\nhypergeometric functions. Using this solution, we show the possibility of\namplification and attenuation of waves and associate this with the decrease and\nincrease of the time-dependent permittivity. We demonstrate, moreover, that\nsuch an energy exchange between waves and non-stationary media leads to the\ntransformation (or conversion) of frequencies. Our results may pave the way\ntowards controllable light-matter interaction in time-varying structures.\n", "  Recently a global SU(4) \\supset SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_A symmetry\nof the confining Coulombic part of the QCD Hamiltonian has been discovered with\nN_F=2. This global symmetry includes both independent rotations of the left-\nand right-handed quarks in the isospin space as well as the chiralspin\nrotations that mix the left- and right-handed components of the quark fields.\nIt has been suggested by lattice simulations, however, that a symmetry of\nmesons in the light quark sector upon the quasi-zero mode truncation from the\nquark propagators is actually higher than SU(4), because the states from a\nsinglet and a 15-plet irreducible representations of SU(4) are also degenerate.\nHere we demonstrate that classically QCD, ignoring irrelevant exact zero mode\ncontributions, has a SU(2N_F) symmetry. If effects of dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking and of anomaly are encoded in the same near-zero modes, then\ntruncation of these modes should restore a classical SU(2N_F) symmetry. Then we\nshow in a Lorentz- and gauge-invariant manner emergence of a bilocal SU(4)\n\\times SU(4) symmetry in mesons that contains a global SU(4) as a subgroup upon\ntruncation of the quasi-zero modes. We also demonstrate that the confining\nCoulombic part of the QCD Hamiltonian has this bilocal symmetry. It explains\nnaturally a degeneracy of different irreducible representations of SU(4)\nobserved in lattice simulations.\n", "  This paper summarises our current understanding of the spectral continuum\ncomponents observed in black hole X-ray binaries. The consequences for\ntheoretical models are discussed with an emphasis on the constraints set by\nobservations on the nature of the X-ray corona in different spectral states.\n", "  A history is given of the discovery between 1914 and 1935 of stars of\nintermediate luminosity between giants and dwarfs with spectral types between\nG0 to K3. The Mt Wilson spectroscopists identified about 90 such stars in their\n1935 summary paper of spectroscopic absolute magnitudes for 4179 stars. Called\n\"subgiants\" by Str\\\"omberg, these 90 stars defined the group at the time. The\nposition of the Mt Wilson subgiants in the HR diagram caused difficulties in\ncomparisons of high weight trigonometric parallaxes being measured and with\nRussell's prevailing evolution proposal, and critics questioned the reality of\nthe Mt Wilson subgiants. We compare, star-by-star, the Mt Wilson spectroscopic\nabsolute magnitudes of the 90 stars defining their sample against those\nabsolute magnitudes derived from Hipparcos (HIP) trigonometric parallaxes. We\naddress concerns over biases in the Mt Wilson calibration sample and biases\ncreated by the adopted methodology for calibration. Historically, these\nconcerns were sufficient to discredit the discovery of subgiants in the Mt\nWilson sample. However, as shown here, the majority of the Mount Wilson stars\nidentified as subgiants that also have reliable HIP trigonometric parallaxes do\nlie among the subgiant sequence in the HIP HR diagram. Moreover, no significant\noffset is seen between the M(V) brightnesses derived from the Mt Wilson\nspectroscopic parallaxes and the M(V) values derived from Hipparcos\ntrigonometric parallaxes with a fractional error of 10%, which confirms in an\nimpressive manner the efficacy of the original Mt Wilson assessments. The\nexistence of subgiants proved that Russell's contraction proposal for stellar\nevolution from giants to the main sequence was incorrect. Instead, Gamow's 1944\nunpublished conjecture that subgiants are post main-sequence stars just having\nleft the main sequence was very nearly correct but was a decade before its\ntime.\n", "  Physical models of Ge energy band structure and material loss were\nimplemented in LASTIP(TM), a 2D simulation tool for edge emitting laser diodes.\nThe model calculation is able to match experimental data available. Important\ndesign parameters of a Fabry-Perot Ge laser, such as the cavity length,\nthickness, width, polycrystalline Si cladding layer thickness were studied and\noptimized. The laser structure optimizations alone were shown to reduce Ith by\n22-fold and increase the differential efficiency by 11 times. The simulations\nalso showed that improving the defect limited carrier lifetime is critical for\nachieving an efficient and low-threshold Ge laser. With the optimized structure\ndesign (300 micron for the cavity length, 0.4 micron for the cavity width, 0.3\nmicron for the cavity thickness, and 0.6 micron for the polycrystalline Si\ncladding layer thickness) and a defect limited carrier lifetime of 100 ns, a\nwall-plug efficiency of 14.6% at 1mW output is predicted, where Jth of 2.8\nkA/cm2, Ith of 3.3 mA, I_1mA of 9 mA, and differential efficiency of 23.6% can\nalso be achieved. These are tremendous improvements from the available\nexperimental values at 280 kA/cm2, 756 mA, 837 mA and 1.9%, respectively.\n", "  For the search for additional Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses in the Higgs\nsector a precise knowledge of their production properties is mandatory. We\nevaluate the cross sections for the neutral Higgs boson production at e^+e^-\ncolliders in the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The evaluation is based\non a full one-loop calculation of the production channels e^+e^- -> h_i Z, h_i\ngamma, h_i h_j (i,j = 1,2,3), including soft and hard QED radiation. The\ndependence of the Higgs boson production cross sections on the relevant cMSSM\nparameters is analyzed numerically. We find sizable contributions to many cross\nsections. They are, depending on the production channel, roughly of 10-20% of\nthe tree-level results, but can go up to 50% or higher. The full one-loop\ncontributions are important for a future linear e^+e^- collider such as the ILC\nor CLIC. There are plans to implement the evaluation of the Higgs boson\nproduction cross sections into the code FeynHiggs.\n", "  We study large D effective theory for D dimensional charged (Anti) de Sitter\nblack holes. Then we show that de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole becomes\nunstable against gravitational perturbations at larger charge than certain\ncritical value in higher dimension. Furthermore we find that there is a\nnon-trivial zero-mode static perturbation at the critical charge. The existence\nof static perturbations suggests the appearance of non-spherical symmetric\nsolution branches of static charged de Sitter black hole. This expectation is\nconfirmed by constructing the non-spherical symmetric static solutions of large\nD effective equations.\n", "  We have investigated the ($2+1$)-dimensional variable coefficient coupled\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (vc-CNLSE) in a graded-index waveguide.\nSimilarity transformations are used to convert the vc-CNLSE into constant\ncoefficient CNLSE. Under certain functional constraints we could extract\nsemirational, multi-parametric solution of the associated Manakov system. This\nfamily of solutions include known Peregrine soliton, mixture of either bright\nsoliton and rogue wave or dark soliton and rogue wave or breather and rogue\nwave. Under a distinct set of self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase\nmodulation (XPM) coefficients we could establish symbiotic existence of\ndifferent soliton pairs as solutions. These soliton pairs may constitute of one\nbright and a dark soliton, two bright solitons or two dark solitons. Finally,\nwhen two wave components are directly proportional, we find bright and dark\nsimilaritons, self-similar breathers and rogue waves as different solutions.\n", "  It was recently shown that other functionals contribute to the effective\naction for the Liouville field when considering massive matter coupled to\ntwo-dimensional gravity in the conformal gauge. The most important of these new\ncontributions corresponds to the Mabuchi functional. We propose a\nminisuperspace action that reproduces the main features of the Mabuchi action\nin order to describe the dynamics of the zero-mode. We show that the associated\nHamiltonian coincides with the (quantum mechanical) Liouville Hamiltonian. As a\nconsequence the Liouville theory and our model of the Mabuchi theory both share\nthe same spectrum, eigenfunctions and - in this approximation - correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  The null Penrose inequality, i.e. the Penrose inequality in terms of the\nBondi energy, is studied by introducing a funtional on surfaces and studying\nits properties along a null hypersurface $\\Omega$ extending to past null\ninfinity. We prove a general Penrose-type inequality which involves the limit\nat infinity of the Hawking energy along a specific class of geodesic foliations\ncalled Geodesic Asymptotic Bondi (GAB), which are shown to always exist.\nWhenever, this foliation approaches large spheres, this inequality becomes the\nnull Penrose inequality and we recover the results of Ludvigsen-Vickers and\nBergqvist. By exploiting further properties of the functional along general\ngeodesic foliations, we introduce an approach to the null Penrose inequality\ncalled Renormalized Area Method and find a set of two conditions which implies\nthe validity of the null Penrose inequality. One of the conditions involves a\nlimit at infinity and the other a condition on the spacetime curvature along\nthe flow. We investigate their range of applicability in two particular but\ninteresting cases, namely the shear-free and vacuum case, where the null\nPenrose inequality is known to hold from the results by Sauter, and the case of\nnull shells propagating in the Minkowski spacetime. Finally, a general\ninequality bounding the area of the quasi-local black hole in terms of an\nasymptotic quantity intrinsic of $\\Omega$ is derived.\n", "  We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of dynamic colour screening via\nmultiple exchanges of semi-soft gluons as a basic QCD mechanism to understand\ndiffractive electron-proton scattering at the HERA collider. Based on the\nkinematics of individual events in the standard QCD description of deep\ninelastic scattering at the parton level, which at low $x$ is dominantly\ngluon-initiated, the probability is evaluated for additional exchanges of\nsofter gluons resulting in an overall colour singlet exchange leading to a\nforward proton and a rapidity gap as the characteristic observables for\ndiffractive scattering. The probability depends on the impact parameter of the\nsoft exchanges and varies with the transverse size of the hard scattering\nsubsystem and is therefore influenced by different QCD effects. We account for\nmatrix elements and parton shower evolution either via conventional DGLAP $\\log\nQ^2$-evolution with collinear factorisation or CCFM small-$x$ evolution with\n$k_\\perp$-factorisation and discuss the sensitivity to the gluon density\ndistribution in the proton and the importance of large log\\,$x$-contributions.\nThe overall result is that, with only two model parameters which have\ntheoretically motivated values, a satisfactory description of the observed\ndiffractive cross-section at HERA is obtained in a wide kinematical range.\n", "  We discuss the signatures of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes formed in a\nJosephson junction on top of a quantum spin Hall system. We show that, while\nignoring interactions on the quantum spin Hall edge allows arbitrary Andreev\nprocess in the system, moderate repulsive interactions stabilize Andreev\ntransmission - the hole goes into the opposite lead from where the electron has\narrived. We analyze the renormalization group equations and deduce the\nexistence of a non-trivial critical point for sufficiently strong interactions.\n", "  The effect of the perturbed ion polarization current on the stability of\nneoclassical tearing modes is calculated using an improved, neoclassical,\nfour-field, drift-MHD model. The calculation involves the self-consistent\ndetermination of the pressure and scalar electric potential profiles in the\nvicinity of the associated magnetic island chain, which allows the chain's\npropagation velocity to be fixed. Two regimes are considered. First, a regime\nin which neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is not strong enough to enhance\nthe magnitude of the polarization current (relative to that found in slab\ngeometry). Second, a regime in which neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is\nstrong enough to significantly enhance the magnitude of the polarization\ncurrent. In both regimes, two types of solution are considered. First, a freely\nrotating solution (i.e., an island chain that is not interacting with a static,\nresonant, magnetic perturbation). Second, a locked solution (i.e., an island\nchain that has been brought to rest in the laboratory frame via interaction\nwith a static, resonant, magnetic perturbation). In all cases, the polarization\ncurrent is found to be either always stabilizing, or stabilizing provided that\neta_i = d ln T_i/d ln n_e does not exceed some threshold value. In certain\nranges of eta_i, the polarization current is found to have have a stabilizing\neffect on a freely rotating island, but a destabilizing effect on a\ncorresponding locked island.\n", "  Experimental and numerical studies of a temporal evolution of a light bullet\nformed in isotropic LiF by Mid IR femtosecond pulse (2500 to 3250 nm) of power,\nslightly exceeding the critical power for self-focusing, are presented. For the\nfirst time regular oscillations of the light bullet intensity during its\npropagation in a filament were registered by investigation of induced color\ncenters in LiF. It was revealed that color centers in a single laser pulse\nfilament have a strictly periodic structure with a length of separate sections\nabout 30 mcm, which increases with a laser pulse wavelength decreasing. It was\nshown that the origin of light bullet modulation is a periodical change of the\nlight field amplitude of an extremely compressed single cycle wave packet in a\nfilament, due to the difference of the wave packet group velocity and the\ncarrier wave phase velocity.\n", "  We describe and implement twisted boundary conditions for the deuteron and\ntriton systems within finite-volumes using the nuclear lattice EFT formalism.\nWe investigate the finite-volume dependence of these systems with different\ntwists angles. We demonstrate how various finite-volume information can be used\nto improve calculations of binding energies in such a framework. Our results\nsuggests that with appropriate twisting of boundaries, infinite-volume binding\nenergies can be reliably extracted from calculations using modest volume sizes\nwith cubic length $L\\approx8-14$ fm. Of particular importance is our derivation\nand numerical verification of three-body analogue of `i-periodic' twist angles\nthat eliminate the leading order finite-volume effects to the three-body\nbinding energy.\n", "  For systems analogous to a linear harmonic oscillator, the simplest way to\ncharacterize the state is by a covariance matrix containing the\nsymmetrically-ordered moments of operators analogous to position and momentum.\nWe show that using Stokes-like detectors without direct access to either\nposition or momentum, the estimation of the covariance matrix of a macroscopic\nsignal is still possible using interference with a classical noisy and\nlow-intensity reference. Such a detection technique will allow to estimate\nmacroscopic quantum states of electromagnetic radiation without a coherent\nhigh-intensity local oscillator. It can be directly applied to estimate the\ncovariance matrix of macroscopically bright squeezed states of light.\n", "  We report on an ultrastable molecular clock based on the interrogation of the\n3{\\nu} rotational-vibrational combination band at 1563nm of carbon monoxide\n12C16O. The laser stabilization scheme is based on frequency modulation (FM)\nsaturation spectroscopy in a high-finesse ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass\noptical cavity using CO as the molecular reference for longterm stabilization\nof the cavity resonance. The NICEOHMS FM modulation method is employed to\nmaintain a high signal-to-noise ratio and avoid conversion of laser frequency\nnoise into amplitude noise by the high finesse cavity. We report an Allan\nDeviation of 1.8x10-12 at 1 second that improves to 3.5x10-14 after 1000\nseconds of averaging.\n", "  A key limitation of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), an established and\npowerful tool for studying atomic-scale biomolecular structure and dynamics is\nits poor sensitivity, samples containing in excess of 10^12 labeled\nbiomolecules are required in typical experiments. In contrast, single molecule\nmeasurements provide improved insights into heterogeneous behaviors that can be\nmasked by ensemble measurements and are often essential for illuminating the\nmolecular mechanisms behind the function of a biomolecule. We report EPR\nmeasurements of a single labeled biomolecule that merge these two powerful\ntechniques. We selectively label an individual double-stranded DNA molecule\nwith a single nanodiamond containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and\noptically detect the paramagnetic resonance of NV spins in the nanodiamond\nprobe. Analysis of the spectrum reveals that the nanodiamond probe has complete\nrotational freedom and that the characteristic time scale for reorientation of\nthe nanodiamond probe is slow compared to the transverse spin relaxation time.\nThis demonstration of EPR spectroscopy of a single nanodiamond labeled DNA\nprovides the foundation for the development of single molecule magnetic\nresonance studies of complex biomolecular systems.\n", "  We analyze a family of singular Schr\\\"odinger operators with local singular\ninteractions supported by a hypersurface $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n, n \\ge\n2$, being the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, bounded or unbounded, not\nnecessarily connected. At each point of $\\Sigma$ the interaction is\ncharacterized by four real parameters, the earlier studied case of $\\delta$-\nand $\\delta'$-interactions being particular cases. We discuss spectral\nproperties of these operators and derive operator inequalities between those\nreferring to the same hypersurface but different couplings and describe their\nimplications for spectral properties.\n", "  We demonstrate that superpositions of coherent and displaced Fock states,\nalso referred to as generalized Schr\\\"odinger cats cats, can be created by\napplication of a nonlinear displacement operator which is a deformed version of\nthe Glauber displacement operator. Consequently, such generalized cat states\ncan be formally considered as nonlinear coherent states. We then show that\nGlauber-Fock photonic lattices endowed with alternating positive and negative\ncoupling coefficients give rise to classical analogs of such cat states. In\naddition, it is pointed out that the analytic propagator of these deformed\nGlauber-Fock arrays explicitly contains the Wigner operator opening the\npossibility to observe Wigner functions of the quantum harmonic oscillator in\nthe classical domain.\n", "  Wide-field polarization measurements of the twilight sky background during\nthe several nights with bright and extended noctilucent clouds in central and\nnorthern Russia in 2014 and 2015 are used to build the phase dependence of\ndegree of polarization of sunlight scattered by clouds particles in a wide\nrange of scattering angles (from 40 to 130 degrees). This range covers the\nlinear polarization maximum near 90 degrees and large-angle slope of the curve\nwhich are most sensitive to the particle size. The method of separation of\nscattering on clouds particles on the twilight background is presented. Results\nare compared with T-matrix simulations for different sizes and shapes of ice\nparticles, the best-fit model radius of particles (0.06 microns) and maximum\nradius (about 0.1 microns) are estimated.\n", "  We study the drift induced by the passage of two cylinders through an\nunbounded extent of inviscid incompressible fluid under the assumption that the\nflow is two-dimensional and steady in the moving frame of reference. The goal\nis to assess how the resulting total particle drift depends on the parameters\nof the geometric configuration, namely, the distance between the cylinders and\ntheir angle with respect to the direction of translation. This problem is\nstudied by numerically computing, for different cylinder configurations, the\ntrajectories of particles starting at various initial locations. The velocity\nfield used in these computations is expressed in closed form using methods of\nthe complex function theory and the accuracy of calculations is carefully\nverified. We identify cylinder configurations which result in increased and\ndecreased drift with respect to the reference case when the two cylinders are\nseparated by an infinite distance. Particle trajectories shed additional light\non the hydrodynamic interactions between the cylinders in configurations\nresulting in different drift values. This ensemble of results provides insights\nabout the accuracy of models used to study biogenic transport.\n", "  We report a density functional study on the evolution of the electronic and\nlattice structure in BiFeO$_3$ with injected electrons and holes. First, the\nself-trapping of electrons and holes were investigated. We found that the\ninjected electrons tend to be localized on Fe sites due to the local lattice\nexpansion, the on-site Coulomb interaction of Fe $3d$ electrons, and the\nantiferromagnetic order in BiFeO$_3$. The injected holes tend to be delocalized\nif the on-site Coulomb interaction of O $2p$ is weak (in other words,\n$U_\\mathrm{O}$ is small). Single center polarons and multi-center polarons are\nformed with large and intermediate $U_\\mathrm{O}$, respectively. With\nintermediate $U_\\mathrm{O}$, multi-center polarons can be formed. We also\nstudied the lattice distortion with the injection of carriers by assuming the\ndelocalization of these carriers. We found that the ferroelectric off-centering\nof BiFeO$_3$ increases with the concentration of the electrons injected and\ndecreases with that of the holes injected. It was also found that a structural\nphase transition from $R3c$ to the non-ferroelectric $Pbnm$ occurs, with the\nhole concentration over 8.7$\\times10^{19} cm^{-3}$. The change of the\noff-centering is mainly due to the change of the lattice volume. The\nunderstanding of the carrier localization mechanism can help to optimize the\nfunctionality of ferroelectric diodes and the ferroelectric photovoltage\ndevices, while the understanding of the evolution of the lattice with carriers\ncan help tuning the ferroelectric properties by the carriers in BiFeO$_3$.\n", "  Black hole binary systems can emit very bright and rapidly varying X-ray\nsignals when material from the companion accretes onto the black hole,\nliberating huge amounts of gravitational potential energy. Central to this\nprocess of accretion is turbulence. In the propagating mass accretion rate\nfluctuations model, turbulence is generated throughout the inner accretion\nflow, causing fluctuations in the accretion rate. Fluctuations from the outer\nregions propagate towards the black hole, modulating the fluctuations generated\nin the inner regions. Here, I present the theoretical motivation behind this\npicture before reviewing the array of statistical variability properties\nobserved in the light curves of black hole binaries that are naturally\nexplained by the model. I also discuss the remaining challenges for the model,\nboth in terms of comparison to data and in terms of including more\nsophisticated theoretical considerations.\n", "  We demonstrate a substantial improvement in the spin-exchange gate using\nsymmetric control instead of conventional detuning in GaAs spin qubits, up to a\nfactor-of-six increase in the quality factor of the gate. For symmetric\noperation, nanosecond voltage pulses are applied to the barrier that controls\nthe interdot potential between quantum dots, modulating the exchange\ninteraction while maintaining symmetry between the dots. Excellent agreement is\nfound with a model that separately includes electrical and nuclear noise\nsources for both detuning and symmetric gating schemes. Unlike exchange control\nvia detuning, the decoherence of symmetric exchange rotations is dominated by\nrotation-axis fluctuations due to nuclear field noise rather than direct\nexchange noise.\n", "  The filter function formalism quantitatively describes the dephasing of a\nqubit by a bath that causes Gaussian fluctuations in the qubit energies with an\narbitrary noise power spectrum. Here, we extend this formalism to account for\nmore general types of noise that couple to the qubit through terms that do not\ncommute with the qubit's bare Hamiltonian. Our approach applies to any power\nspectrum that generates slow noise fluctuations in the qubit's evolution. We\ndemonstrate our formalism in the case of singlet-triplet qubits subject to both\nquasistatic nuclear noise and $1/\\omega^\\alpha$ charge noise and find good\nagreement with recent experimental findings. This comparison shows the efficacy\nof our approach in describing real systems and additionally highlights the\nchallenges with distinguishing different types of noise in free induction decay\nexperiments.\n", "  We present late-time Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging of SN 2008S\nand NGC 300 2008OT-1, the prototypes of a common class of stellar transients\nwhose true nature is debated. Both objects are still fading and are now >15\ntimes fainter than the progenitors in the mid-IR and are undetected in the\noptical and near-IR. Data from the Large Binocular Telescope and Magellan show\nthat neither source has been variable in the optical since fading in 2010. We\npresent models of surviving sources obscured by dusty shells or winds and find\nthat extreme dust models are needed for surviving stars to be successfully\nhidden by dust. Explaining these transients as supernovae explosions, such as\nthe electron capture supernovae believed to be associated with extreme AGB\nstars, seems an equally viable solution. Though SN 2008S is not detected in\nChandra X-Ray Observatory data taken in 2012, the flux limits allow the fading\nIR source to be powered solely by the shock interaction of ejecta with the\ncircumstellar medium if the shock velocity at the time of the observation was\n>20% slower than estimated from emission line widths while the transient was\nstill optically bright. Continued SST monitoring and 10-20 micron observations\nwith JWST can resolve any remaining ambiguities.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the dynamics of a binary mixture of rod--like,\nrepulsive colloidal particles driven out of equilibrium by means of a steady\nshear flow (Couette geometry). To this end we first derive, starting from a\nmicroscopic density functional in Parsons--Lee approximation, a mesoscopic free\nenergy functional whose main variables are the orientational order parameter\ntensors. Based on this mesoscopic functional we then explore the stability of\nisotropic and nematic equilibrium phases in terms of composition and rod\nlengths. Second, by combining the equilibrium theory with the Doi--Hess\napproach for the order parameter dynamics under shear, we investigate the\norientational dynamics of binary mixtures for a range of shear rates and\ncoupling parameters. We find a variety of dynamical states, including\nsynchronized oscillatory states of the two components, but also symmetry\nbreaking behavior where the components display different in--plane oscillatory\nstates.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a polytropic fluid which is radially accreted\ninto a Schwarzschild black hole. The case where the adiabatic index gamma lies\nin the range 1 < gamma <= 5/3 has been treated in previous work. In this\narticle we analyze the complementary range 5/3 < gamma <= 2. To this purpose,\nthe problem is cast into an appropriate Hamiltonian dynamical system whose\nphase flow is analyzed. While for 1 < gamma <= 5/3 the solutions are always\ncharacterized by the presence of a unique critical saddle point, we show that\nwhen 5/3 < gamma <= 2, an additional critical point might appear which is a\ncenter point. For the parametrization used in this paper we prove that whenever\nthis additional critical point appears, there is a homoclinic orbit.\n", "  A new method of cooling positronium down is proposed to realize Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of positronium. We perform detail studies about three processes\n(1) thermalization processes between positronium and silica walls of a cavity,\n(2) Ps-Ps scatterings and (3) Laser cooling. The thermalization process is\nshown to be not sufficient for BEC. Ps-Ps collision is also shown to make a big\neffect on the cooling performance. We combine both methods and establish an\nefficient cooling for BEC. We also propose a new optical laser system for the\ncooling.\n", "  Attempts were made to construct a unified description of the spectra of ULX\n(Ultra Luminous X-ray source) objects, including their Power-Law (PL) state and\nDisk-like state. Among spectral models proposed to explain either state, the\npresent work adopts the one which combines multi-color disk (MCD) emission and\nits thermal Comptonization (THC). This model was applied to several datasets of\nULXs obtained by Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Nustar. The model well explains all\nthe spectra, regardless of the spectral states, in terms of a cool disk (inner\nradius temperature of 0.2-0.5 keV) and a cool thick (electron temperature of\n1-3 keV, and optical thickness ~10) corona. The fit results can be\ncharacterized by two new parameters. One is Q (defined as the electron\ntemerature divided by the inner radius temperature) which describes balance\nbetween the Compton cooling and gravitational heating of the coronal electrons,\nwhile the other is F, namely, the covering fraction of the MCD by the corona.\nHere, F is calculated from the percentage of the directly-visible disk\nluminosity in the total radiation. Then, the PL-state spectra have been found\nto show Q~10 and F~0.5, while those of the Disk-like state Q~3 and F~1. Thus,\nthe two states are clearly separated in terms of Q and F. The obtained results\nare employed to argue for their interpretation in terms of high-mass (several\ntens to several hundreds solar masses) black holes.\n", "  We present the exact adiabatic theory for the dynamics of the inhomogeneous\ndensity distribution of a classical fluid. Erroneous particle number\nfluctuations of dynamical density functional theory are absent, both for\ncanonical and grand canonical initial conditions. We obtain the canonical free\nenergy functional, which yields the adiabatic interparticle forces of\noverdamped Brownian motion. Using an exact and one of the most advanced\napproximate hard core free energy functionals, we obtain excellent agreement\nwith simulations. The theory applies to finite systems in and out of\nequilibrium.\n", "  We consider solutions in Einstein-Maxwell theory with a negative cosmological\nconstant that asymptote to global $AdS_{4}$ with conformal boundary\n$S^{2}\\times\\mathbb{R}_{t}$. At the sphere at infinity we turn on a\nspace-dependent electrostatic potential, which does not destroy the asymptotic\n$AdS$ behaviour. For simplicity we focus on the case of a dipolar electrostatic\npotential. We find two new geometries: (i) an $AdS$ soliton that includes the\nfull backreaction of the electric field on the $AdS$ geometry; (ii) a polarised\nneutral black hole that is deformed by the electric field, accumulating\nopposite charges in each hemisphere. For both geometries we study boundary data\nsuch as the charge density and the stress tensor. For the black hole we also\nstudy the horizon charge density and area, and further verify a Smarr formula.\nThen we consider this system at finite temperature and compute the Gibbs free\nenergy for both $AdS$ soliton and black hole phases. The corresponding phase\ndiagram generalizes the Hawking-Page phase transition. The $AdS$ soliton\ndominates the low temperature phase and the black hole the high temperature\nphase, with a critical temperature that decreases as the external electric\nfield increases. Finally, we consider the simple case of a free charged scalar\nfield on $S^{2}\\times\\mathbb{R}_{t}$ with conformal coupling. For a field in\nthe $SU(N)$ adjoint representation we compare the phase diagram with the above\ngravitational system.\n", "  The inner 20 gravitational radii around the black hole at the centre of\nluminous Active Galactic Nuclei and stellar mass Black Hole Binaries are now\nbeing routinely mapped by X-ray spectral-timing techniques. Spectral blurring\nand reverberation of the reflection spectrum are key tools in this work. In the\nmost extreme AGN cases with high black hole spin, when the source appears in a\nlow state, observations probe the region within 1 gravitational radius of the\nevent horizon. The location, size and operation of the corona, which generates\nthe power-law X-ray continuum, are also being revealed.\n", "  Long range orbital order has been investigated in Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$V$_2$O$_4$\nas a function of doping (x) using first principles density functional theory\ncalculations including the effects of Coulomb correlation and spin-orbit\ninteraction within GGA+U and GGA+U+SO approximations. Through a detailed\nanalysis of corresponding Wannier orbital projections of the Vanadium d bands,\nwe have clearly established that for x$\\le$0.6, the orbital order at V sites\nconsists of a linear superposition of d$_{xz}$ and d$_{yz}$ orbitals of the\ntype d$_{xz}\\pm$d$_{yz}$. Within each ab-plane a ferro-orbital ordering of\neither d$_{xz}$+d$_{yz}$ or d$_{xz}$-d$_{yz}$ is observed which alternates in\nsuccessive ab-planes along the c-direction. On the contrary, for x$>$0.6, it is\nthe d$_{xz}$ or d$_{yz}$ orbital which orders at V sites in successive\nab-planes along c-direction (so called A-type ordering). At Fe sites, we\nobserve an orbital ordering of d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals for x$\\le$0.6 and\nd$_{z^2}$ orbitals for x$>$0.6. Effect of spin-orbit interaction on orbital\nordering is found to be not significant in the entire range of doping studied.\n", "  For a holographically defined finite temperature theory, we derive an\noff-shell constitutive relation for a global $U(1)$ current driven by a weak\nexternal non-dynamical electromagnetic field. The constitutive relation\ninvolves an all order gradient expansion resummed into three momenta-dependent\ntransport coefficient functions: diffusion, electric conductivity, and\n\"magnetic\" conductivity. These transport functions are first computed\nanalytically in the hydrodynamic limit, up to third order in the derivative\nexpansion, and then numerically for generic values of momenta. We also compute\na diffusion memory function, which, as a result of all order gradient\nresummation, is found to be causal.\n", "  We sort $4683$ molecular clouds between $10^\\circ< \\ell <65^\\circ$ from the\nBolocam Galactic Plane Survey based on observational diagnostics of star\nformation activity: compact $70$ $\\mu{\\rm m}$ sources, mid-IR color-selected\nYSOs, ${\\rm H_2O}$ and ${\\rm CH_3OH}$ masers, and UCHII regions. We also\npresent a combined ${\\rm NH_3}$-derived gas kinetic temperature and ${\\rm\nH_2O}$ maser catalog for $1788$ clumps from our own GBT 100m observations and\nfrom the literature. We identify a subsample of $2223$ ($47.5\\%$) starless\nclump candidates, the largest and most robust sample identified from a blind\nsurvey to date. Distributions of flux density, flux concentration, solid angle,\nkinetic temperature, column density, radius, and mass show strong ($>1$ dex)\nprogressions when sorted by star formation indicator. The median starless clump\ncandidate is marginally sub-virial ($\\alpha \\sim 0.7$) with $>75\\%$ of clumps\nwith known distance being gravitationally bound ($\\alpha < 2$). These samples\nshow a statistically significant increase in the median clump mass of $\\Delta M\n\\sim 170-370$ M$_\\odot$ from the starless candidates to clumps associated with\nprotostars. This trend could be due to (i) mass growth of the clumps at\n$\\dot{M}\\sim200-440$ Msun Myr$^{-1}$ for an average free-fall $0.8$ Myr\ntime-scale, (ii) a systematic factor of two increase in dust opacity from\nstarless to protostellar phases, (iii) and/or a variation in the ratio of\nstarless to protostellar clump lifetime that scales as $\\sim M^{-0.4}$. By\ncomparing to the observed number of ${\\rm CH_3OH}$ maser containing clumps we\nestimate the phase-lifetime of massive ($M>10^3$ M$_\\odot$) starless clumps to\nbe $0.37 \\pm 0.08 \\ {\\rm Myr} \\ (M/10^3 \\ {\\rm M}_\\odot)^{-1}$; the majority\n($M<450$ M$_\\odot$) have phase-lifetimes longer than their average free-fall\ntime.\n", "  Recently found positive representation for an arbitrary complex, gaussian\nweight is used to construct a statistical formulation of gaussian path\nintegrals directly in the Minkowski time. The positivity of Minkowski weights\nis achieved by doubling the number of real variables. The continuum limit of\nthe new representation exists only if some of the additional couplings tend to\ninfinity and are tuned in a specific way. The construction is then successfully\napplied to three quantum mechanical examples including a particle in a constant\nmagnetic field -- a simplest prototype of a Wilson line. Further\ngeneralizations are shortly discussed and an intriguing interpretation of new\nvariables is alluded to.\n", "  The discovery of Heusler alloys has revolutionized the research field of\nintermetallics due to the ease with which one can derive potential candidates\nfor multifunctional applications. During recent years, many half Heusler alloys\nhave been investigated for their thermoelectric properties. The f electron\nbased rare earth ternary half Heusler compound DyPdBi has its f energy levels\nlocated close to the Fermi energy level. Other research efforts have emphasized\nthat such materials have good thermoelectric capabilities. We have explored\nusing first principles the electronic band structure of DyPdBi by use of\ndifferent exchange correlation potentials in the density functional theoretical\nframework. Transport coefficients that arise in the study of thermoelectric\nproperties of DyPdBi have been calculated and illustrate its potential as an\nefficient thermoelectric material. Both the theoretically estimated Seebeck\ncoefficient and the power factor agree well with the available experimental\nresults. Our calculations illustrate that it is essential to include spin-orbit\ncoupling in these models of f electron half Heusler materials.\n", "  We explore the sensitivity of the LHC at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy (LHC14)\nto the single production and decay of top-antitop resonances in the four-top\nfinal state. We focus on the same-sign dilepton channel, and work within a\nsimplified model with a vector boson coupling to the Standard Model only via\nits interactions with right-handed top quarks. We find it is possible to\ndiscover (exclude) such a vector boson with 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated\nluminosity up to a mass of 1.2 (1.6) TeV for a modest coupling to tops of\n$g_\\rho$=2. We present our results as an exclusion limit on the\ncross-section$\\times$branching ratio for ease of recasting, and interpret them\nin the context of the gauge-singlet vector boson $\\rho_X$ present in many\nsimple Composite Higgs theories.\n", "  We study the formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks from the\ngravitational collapse of solid over-densities generated via the streaming\ninstability. To carry out these studies, we implement and test a particle-mesh\nself-gravity module for the Athena code that enables the simulation of\naerodynamically coupled systems of gas and collisionless self-gravitating solid\nparticles. Upon employment of our algorithm to planetesimal formation\nsimulations, we find that (when a direct comparison is possible) the Athena\nsimulations yield predicted planetesimal properties that agree well with those\nfound in prior work using different numerical techniques. In particular, the\ngravitational collapse of streaming-initiated clumps leads to an initial\nplanetesimal mass function that is well-represented by a power-law, dN/dM ~\nM^{-p}, with p = 1.6 +/- 0.1, which equates to a differential size distribution\ndN/dR ~ R^{-q}, with q = 2.8 +/- 0.1. We find no significant trends with\nresolution from a convergence study of up to 512^3 grid zones and Npar =\n1.5x10^8 particles. Likewise, the power-law slope appears indifferent to\nchanges in the relative strength of self-gravity and tidal shear, and to the\ntime when (for reasons of numerical economy) self-gravity is turned on, though\nthe strength of these claims is limited by small number statistics. For a\ntypically assumed radial distribution of minimum mass solar nebula solids\n(assumed here to have dimensionless stopping time \\tau = 0.3), our results\nsupport the hypothesis that bodies on the scale of large asteroids or Kuiper\nBelt Objects could have formed as the high-mass tail of a primordial\nplanetesimal population.\n", "  We measure a relation between the depth of four prominent rest-UV absorption\ncomplexes and metallicity for local galaxies and verify it up to z~3. We then\napply this relation to a sample of 224 galaxies at 3.5 < z < 6.0 (<z> = 4.8) in\nCOSMOS, for which unique UV spectra from DEIMOS and accurate stellar masses\nfrom SPLASH are available. The average galaxy population at z~5 and log(M/Msun)\n> 9 is characterized by 0.3-0.4 dex (in units of 12+log(O/H)) lower\nmetallicities than at z~2, but comparable to z~3.5. We find galaxies with\nweak/no Ly-alpha emission to have metallicities comparable to z~2 galaxies and\ntherefore may represent an evolved sub-population of z~5 galaxies. We find a\ncorrelation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxies\nand an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR)\nconsistent with observations at z~2. The relation between stellar mass and\nmetallicity (MZ relation) is similar to z~3.5, however, there are indications\nof it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, Ly-alpha emitting\ngalaxies. We show that, within a \"bathtub\" approach, a shallower MZ relation is\nexpected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with an\ne-folding time of 100-200 Myr. Due to this fast evolution, the process of dust\nproduction and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochastic\nin the first billion years of galaxy formation compared to later times.\n", "  We characterize the absolutely continuous spectrum of half-line\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators in terms of the limiting behavior of\nthe Crystaline Landauer-B\\\"uttiker conductance of the associated finite\nsamples.\n", "  Six high-resolution TiO-band image sequences from the New Vacuum Solar\nTelescope (NVST) are used to investigate the properties of intergranular bright\npoints (igBPs). We detect the igBPs using a Laplacian and morphological\ndilation algorithm (LMD) and track them using a three-dimensional segmentation\nalgorithm automatically, and then investigate the morphologic, photometric and\ndynamic properties of igBPs, in terms of equivalent diameter, the intensity\ncontrast, lifetime, horizontal velocity, diffusion index, motion range and\nmotion type. The statistical results confirm the previous studies based on\nG-band or TiO-band igBPs from the other telescopes. It illustrates that the TiO\ndata from the NVST have a stable and reliable quality, which are suitable for\nstudying the igBPs. In addition, our method is feasible to detect and track the\nigBPs in the TiO data from the NVST. With the aid of the vector magnetograms\nobtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory /Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager,\nthe properties of igBPs are found to be influenced by their embedded magnetic\nenvironments strongly. The area coverage, the size and the intensity contrast\nvalues of igBPs are generally larger in the regions with higher magnetic flux.\nHowever, the dynamics of igBPs, including the horizontal velocity, the\ndiffusion index, the ratio of motion range and the index of motion type are\ngenerally larger in the regions with lower magnetic flux. It suggests that the\nabsence of strong magnetic fields in the medium makes it possible for the igBPs\nto look smaller and weaker, diffuse faster, move faster and further in a\nstraighter path.\n", "  Cornell's electron/positron storage ring (CESR) was modified over a series of\naccelerator shutdowns beginning in May 2008, which substantially improves its\ncapability for research and development for particle accelerators. CESR's\nenergy span from 1.8 to 5.6 GeV with both electrons and positrons makes it\nideal for the study of a wide spectrum of accelerator physics issues and\ninstrumentation related to present light sources and future lepton damping\nrings. Additionally a number of these are also relevant for the beam physics of\nproton accelerators. This paper is the third in a series of four describing the\nthe conversion of CESR to the test accelerator, CesrTA. The first two papers\ndiscuss the overall plan for the conversion of the storage ring to an\ninstrument capable of studying advanced accelerator physics issues and the\ndetails of the vacuum system upgrades. This paper focusses on the necessary\ndevelopment of new instrumentation, situated in four dedicated experimental\nregions, capable of studying such phenomena as electron clouds (ECs) and\nmethods to mitigate EC effects. The fourth paper in this series describes the\nvacuum system modifications of the superconducting wigglers to accommodate the\ndiagnostic instrumentation for the study of EC behavior within wigglers. While\nthe initial studies of CesrTA focussed on questions related to the\nInternational Linear Collider damping ring design, CesrTA is a very versatile\nstorage ring, capable of studying a wide range of accelerator physics and\ninstrumentation questions.\n", "  Using both dynamical density functional theory and particle-resolved Brownian\ndynamics simulations, we explore the flow of two-dimensional colloidal solids\nand fluids driven through a linear channel with a geometric constriction. The\nflow is generated by a constant external force acting on all colloids. The\ninitial configuration is equilibrated in the absence of flow and then the\nexternal force is switched on instantaneously. Upon starting the flow, we\nobserve four different scenarios: a complete blockade, a monotonic decay to a\nconstant particle flux (typical for a fluid), a damped oscillatory behaviour in\nthe particle flux, and a long-lived stop-and-go behaviour in the flow (typical\nfor a solid). The dynamical density functional theory describes all four\nsituations but predicts infinitely long undamped oscillations in the flow which\nare always damped in the simulations. We attribute the mechanisms of the\nunderlying stop-and-go flow to symmetry conditions on the flowing solid. Our\npredictions are verifiable in real-space experiments on magnetic colloidal\nmonolayers which are driven through structured microchannels and can be\nexploited to steer the flow throughput in microfluidics.\n", "  In monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, the light\nhelicity ($\\sigma^+$ or $\\sigma^-$) is locked to the valley degree of freedom,\nleading to the possibility of optical initialization of distinct valley\npopulations. However, an extremely rapid valley pseudospin relaxation (at the\ntime scale of picoseconds) occurring for optically bright (electric-dipole\nactive) excitons imposes some limitations on the development of\nopto-valleytronics. Here we show that inter-valley scattering of excitons can\nbe significantly suppressed in a $\\mathrm{WSe}_2$ monolayer, a direct-gap\ntwo-dimensional semiconductor with the exciton ground state being optically\ndark. We demonstrate that the already inefficient relaxation of the exciton\npseudospin in such system can be suppressed even further by the application of\na tiny magnetic field of $\\sim$100 mT. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the\npseudospin dynamics to be a two-step relaxation process. An initial decay of\nthe pseudospin occurs at the level of dark excitons on a time scale of 100 ps,\nwhich is tunable with a magnetic field. This decay is followed by even longer\ndecay ($>1$ ns), once the dark excitons form more complex objects allowing for\ntheir radiative recombination. Our finding of slow valley pseudospin relaxation\neasily manipulated by the magnetic field open new prospects for engineering the\ndynamics of the valley pseudospin in transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  The generalization of the Randall-Sundrum solution for the warp factor\nexp[sigma(y)] in the scenario with one extra coordinate y, non-factorizable\nspace-time geometry and two branes isobtained. It is shown that the function\nobtained sigma(y) is symmetric with respect to an interchange of two branes. It\nalso obeys the orbifold symmetry y -> - y and explicitly reproduces jumps of\nits derivative on both branes. This solution is defined by the\nEinstein-Hilbert's equations up to a constant C. It is demonstrated that\ndifferent values of C results in theories with quite different spectra of the\nKaluza-Klein gravitons.\n", "  We present a recalibration of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry\nwith new flat fields and zero points derived from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1). Using PSF\nphotometry of 60 million stars with $16 < r < 20$, we derive a model of\namplifier gain and flat-field corrections with per-run RMS residuals of 3\nmillimagnitudes (mmag) in $griz$ bands and 15 mmag in $u$ band. The new\nphotometric zero points are adjusted to leave the median in the Galactic North\nunchanged for compatibility with previous SDSS work. We also identify transient\nnon-photometric periods in SDSS (\"contrails\") based on photometric deviations\nco-temporal in SDSS bands. The recalibrated stellar PSF photometry of SDSS and\nPS1 has an RMS difference of {9,7,7,8} mmag in $griz$, respectively, when\naveraged over $15'$ regions.\n", "  We apply a method recently introduced to the statistical literature to\ndirectly estimate the precision matrix from an ensemble of samples drawn from a\ncorresponding Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the observation that\ncosmological precision matrices are often approximately sparse, the method\nallows one to exploit this sparsity of the precision matrix to more quickly\nconverge to an asymptotic 1/sqrt(Nsim) rate while simultaneously providing an\nerror model for all of the terms. Such an estimate can be used as the starting\npoint for further regularization efforts which can improve upon the\n1/sqrt(Nsim) limit above, and incorporating such additional steps is\nstraightforward within this framework. We demonstrate the technique with toy\nmodels and with an example motivated by large-scale structure two-point\nanalysis, showing significant improvements in the rate of convergence.For the\nlarge-scale structure example we find errors on the precision matrix which are\nfactors of 5 smaller than for the sample precision matrix for thousands of\nsimulations or, alternatively, convergence to the same error level with more\nthan an order of magnitude fewer simulations.\n", "  The characteristics of the inner layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere,\nare determinant for the earth's life. In this experience we explore the first\nhundreds of meters using a smartphone mounted on a quadcopter. Both the\naltitude and the pressure are obtained using the smartphone's sensors. We\ncomplement these measures with data collected from the flight information\nsystem of an aircraft. The experimental results are compared with the\nInternational Standard Atmosphere and other simple approximations: isothermal\nand constant density atmospheres.\n", "  We report on an analysis of the impact of available experimental data on hard\nprocesses in proton-lead collisions during Run I at the Large Hadron Collider\non nuclear modifications of parton distribution functions. Our analysis is\nrestricted to the EPS09 and DSSZ global fits. The measurements that we consider\ncomprise production of massive gauge bosons, jets, charged hadrons and pions.\nThis is the first time a study of nuclear PDFs includes this number of\ndifferent observables. The goal of the paper is twofold: i) checking the\ndescription of the data by nPDFs, as well as the relevance of these nuclear\neffects, in a quantitative manner; ii) testing the constraining power of these\ndata in eventual global fits, for which we use the Bayesian reweighting\ntechnique. We find an overall good, even too good, description of the data,\nindicating that more constraining power would require a better control over the\nsystematic uncertainties and/or the proper proton-proton reference from LHC Run\nII. Some of the observables, however, show sizable tension with specific\nchoices of proton and nuclear PDFs. We also comment on the corresponding\nimprovements on the theoretical treatment.\n", "  We present the Lya luminosity functions (LFs) derived by our deep Subaru\nnarrowband survey that identifies a total of 3,137 Lya emitters (LAEs) at $z =\n2.2$ in five independent blank fields. The sample of these LAEs is the largest,\nto date, and covers a very wide Lya luminosity range of $\\log L_{Ly\\alpha} =\n41.7-44.4$ erg s$^{-1}$. We determine the Lya LF at $z = 2.2$ with\nunprecedented accuracies, and obtain the best-fit Schechter parameters of\n$L^{*}_{Ly\\alpha} = 5.29^{+1.67}_{-1.13} \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\n$\\phi^{*}_{Ly\\alpha} = 6.32^{+3.08}_{-2.31} \\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, and\n$\\alpha = -1.75^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ showing a steep faint-end slope. We identify a\nsignificant hump at the LF bright end ($\\log L_{Ly\\alpha} > 43.4$ erg\ns$^{-1}$). Because all of the LAEs in the bright-end hump have (a) bright\ncounterpart(s) either in the X-ray, UV, or radio data, this bright-end hump is\nnot made by gravitational lensing magnification bias but AGNs. These AGNs allow\nus to derive the AGN UV LF at $z \\sim 2$ down to the faint magnitude limit of\n$M_{UV} \\simeq -22.5$, and to constrain the faint-end slope of AGN UV LF,\n$\\alpha_{AGN}=-1.2 \\pm 0.1$, that is flatter than those at $z > 4$. Based on\nthe Lya and UV LFs from our and previous studies, we find the increase of Lya\nescape fraction $f^{Ly\\alpha}_{esc}$ from $z \\sim 0$ to $6$ by two orders of\nmagnitude. This large $f^{Ly\\alpha}_{esc}$ increase can be explained neither by\nthe evolution of stellar population nor outflow alone, but the evolution of\nneutral hydrogen HI density in inter-stellar medium that enhances dust\nattenuation for Lya by resonance scattering. Our uniform expanding shell models\nsuggest that the typical HI column density decreases from $N_{HI} \\sim 7 \\times\n10^{19}$ ($z \\sim 0$) to $\\sim 1 \\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($z \\sim 6$) to\nexplain the large $f^{Ly\\alpha}_{esc}$ increase.\n", "  We report high temperature superconductivity in one unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe\nfilms grown on STO(110) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. By in-situ\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy measurement, we observed a superconducting gap\nas large as 17 meV. Transport measurements on 1-UC FeSe/STO(110) capped with\nFeTe layers reveal superconductivity with an onset TC of 31.6 K and an upper\ncritical magnetic field of 30.2 T. We also find that the TC can be further\nincreased by an external electric field, but the effect is smaller than that on\nSTO(001) substrate. The study points out the important roles of interface\nrelated charge transfer and electron-phonon coupling in the high temperature\nsuperconductivity of FeSe/STO.\n", "  We propose a unified approach to study meson, nucleon and $\\Delta$-baryon\nproperties at zero and finite temperatures in the context of hard-wall AdS/QCD\nmodel. We first combine some previous works dealing with mesons and baryons\nseparately, and introduce a new parameter~$\\xi$ so that the model could give a\nuniversal description of spectrum and couplings of both sectors in a\nself-consistent way. All observables calculated numerically show reasonable\nagreement with experimental data. We then study these observables at nonzero\ntemperature by modifying the AdS space-time into AdS-Schwartzchild space-time.\nNumerically solving the model, we find an interesting temperature dependence of\nthe spectrum and the couplings. We also make a prediction on the finite\ntemperature decay width of some nucleon and $\\Delta$ excited states.\n", "  We propose a covariant Hamiltonian action for the Prokushkin and Vasiliev's\nmatter coupled higher spin gravity in three dimensions. The action is\nformulated on ${\\cal X}_4 \\times {\\cal Z}_2$ where ${\\cal X}_4$ is an open\nmanifold whose boundary contains spacetime and ${\\cal Z}_2$ is a noncommutative\ntwistor space. We examine various consistent truncations to models of BF type\nin ${\\cal X}_4$ and ${\\cal Z}_2$ with B$^2$ terms and central elements. They\nare obtained by integrating out the matter fields in the presence of a vacuum\nexpectation value $\\nu\\in \\mathbb{R}$ for the zero-form master field. For\n$\\nu=0$, we obtain a model on ${\\cal X}_4$ containing Blencowe's action and a\nmodel on ${\\cal Z}_2$ containing the Prokushkin--Segal--Vasiliev action. For\ngeneric $\\nu$ (including $\\nu=0$), we propose an alternative model on ${\\cal\nX}_4$ with gauge fields in the Weyl algebra of Wigner's deformed oscillator\nalgebra and Lagrange multipliers in the algebra of operators acting in the Fock\nrepresentation space of the deformed oscillators.\n", "  We have recently established a new method for measuring the mass of unstable\nparticles produced at hadron colliders based on the analysis of the energy\ndistribution of a massless product from their two-body decays. The central\ningredient of our proposal is the remarkable result that, for an unpolarized\ndecaying particle, the location of the peak in the energy distribution of the\nobserved decay product is identical to the (fixed) value of the energy that\nthis particle would have in the rest-frame of the decaying particle, which, in\nturn, is a simple function of the involved masses. In addition, we utilized the\nproperty that this energy distribution is symmetric around the location of peak\nwhen energy is plotted on a logarithmic scale. The general strategy was\ndemonstrated in several specific cases, including both beyond the SM particles,\nas well as for the top quark. In the present work, we generalize this method to\nthe case of a massive decay product from a two-body decay; this procedure is\nfar from trivial because (in general) both the above- mentioned properties are\nno longer valid. Nonetheless, we propose a suitably modified parametrization of\nthe energy distribution that was used successfully for the massless case, which\ncan deal with the massive case as well. We establish the accuracy of this\nparametrization using concrete examples of energy spectra of Z bosons from the\ndecay of a heavier stop into a Z boson and a lighter stop. We then study a\nrealistic application for the same process, but now including dominant\nbackgrounds and using foreseeable statistics at LHC14, in order to determine\nthe performance of this method for an actual mass measurement. The upshot of\nour present and previous work is that, in spite of energy being a\nLorentz-variant quantity, its distribution emerges as a powerful tool for mass\nmeasurement at hadron colliders.\n", "  We present a study of the collisional relaxation of ion velocities in a\nstrongly coupled, ultracold neutral plasma on short timescales compared to the\ninverse collision rate. Non-exponential decay towards equilibrium for the\naverage velocity of a tagged population of ions heralds non-Markovian dynamics\nand a breakdown of assumptions underlying standard kinetic theory. We prove the\nequivalence of the average-velocity curve to the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction, a fundamental statistical quantity that provides access to\nequilibrium transport coefficients and aspects of individual particle\ntrajectories in a regime where experimental measurements have been lacking.\nFrom our data, we calculate the ion self-diffusion constant. This demonstrates\nthe utility of ultracold neutral plasmas for isolating the effects of strong\ncoupling on collisional processes, which is of interest for dense laboratory\nand astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  We report the discovery of an isolated compact galaxy triplet SDSS\nJ084843.45+164417.3, which is first detected by the LAMOST spectral survey and\nthen confirmed by the spectroscopic observation of the BFOSC of the 2.16 meter\ntelescope. It is found that this triplet is an isolated and extremely compact\nsystem, which has an aligned configuration and very small radial velocity\ndispersion. The member galaxies have similar colors and show marginal star\nformation activities. These results enhance the opinion that the compact\ntriplets are well-evolved systems rather than the hierarchically forming\nstructures. This occasional discovery reveals the limitations of the fiber\nspectral redshift surveys in studying such compact system, and declares the\nnecessity of additional observations to complete the current redshift sample.\n", "  An interesting application of the gauge/gravity duality to condensed matter\nphysics is the description of a lattice via breaking translational invariance\non the gravity side. By making use of global symmetries, it is possible to do\nso without scarifying homogeneity of the pertinent bulk solutions, which we\nthus term as \"homogeneous holographic lattices.\" Due to their technical\nsimplicity, these configurations have received a great deal of attention in the\nlast few years and have been shown to correctly describe momentum relaxation\nand hence (finite) DC conductivities. However, it is not clear whether they are\nable to capture other lattice effects which are of interest in condensed\nmatter. In this paper we investigate this question focusing our attention on\nthe phenomenon of commensurability, which arises when the lattice scale is\ntuned to be equal to (an integer multiple of) another momentum scale in the\nsystem. We do so by studying the formation of spatially modulated phases in\nvarious models of homogeneous holographic lattices. Our results indicate that\nthe onset of the instability is controlled by the near horizon geometry, which\nfor insulating solutions does carry information about the lattice. However, we\nobserve no sharp connection between the characteristic momentum of the broken\nphase and the lattice pitch, which calls into question the applicability of\nthese models to the physics of commensurability.\n", "  In the context of 4D/2D dualities, SH$^c$ algebra, introduced by Schiffmann\nand Vasserot, provides a systematic method to analyse the instanton partition\nfunctions of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In this paper, we\nrewrite the SH$^c$ algebra in terms of three holomorphic fields $D_0(z)$,\n$D_{\\pm1}(z)$ with which the algebra and its epresentations are simplified. The\ninstanton partition functions for arbitrary $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills\ntheories with $A_n$ and $A^{(1)}_n$ type quiver diagrams are compactly\nexpressed as a product of four building blocks: Gaiotto state, dilatation,\nflavor vertex operator and intertwiner which are written in terms of SH$^c$ and\nthe orthogonal basis introduced by Alba, Fateev, Litvinov and Tarnopolskiy.\nThese building blocks are characterized by new conditions which generalize the\nknown ones on the Gaiotto state and the Carlsson-Okounkov vertex. Consistency\nconditions of the inner product give algebraic relations for the chiral ring\ngenerating functions defined by Nekrasov, Pestun and Shatashvili. In particular\nwe show the polynomiality of the qq-characters which have been introduced as a\ndeformation of the Yangian characters. These relations define a second\nquantization of the Seiberg-Witten geometry, and, accordingly, reduce to a\nBaxter TQ-equation in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the Omega-background.\n", "  We consider the global thermal state of classical and quantum harmonic\noscillators that interact with a reservoir. Ohmic damping of the oscillator can\nbe exactly treated with a 1D scalar field reservoir, whereas general non-Ohmic\ndamping is conveniently treated with a continuum reservoir of harmonic\noscillators. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian of the total system, we\ncalculate a number of thermodynamic quantities for the damped oscillator: the\nmean force internal energy, mean force free energy, and another internal energy\nbased on the free-oscillator Hamiltonian. The classical mean force energy is\nequal to that of a free oscillator, for both Ohmic and non-Ohmic damping and no\nmatter how strong the coupling to the reservoir. In contrast, the quantum mean\nforce energy depends on the details of the damping and diverges for strictly\nOhmic damping. These results give additional insight into the steady-state\nthermodynamics of open systems with arbitrarily strong coupling to a reservoir,\ncomplementing results for energies derived within dynamical approaches (e.g.\nmaster equations) in the weak-coupling regime.\n", "  We analyze a time series of optical spectra of SN~2014J from almost two weeks\nprior to maximum to nearly four months after maximum. We perform our analysis\nusing the SYNOW code, which is well suited to track the distribution of the\nions with velocity in the ejecta. We show that almost all of the spectral\nfeatures during the entire epoch can be identified with permitted transitions\nof the common ions found in normal SNe Ia in agreement with previous studies.\n  We show that 2014J is a relatively normal SN Ia. At early times the spectral\nfeatures are dominated by Si II, S II, Mg II, and Ca II. These ions persist to\nmaximum light with the appearance of Na I and Mg I. At later times iron-group\nelements also appear, as expected in the stratified abundance model of the\nformation of normal type Ia SNe.\n  We do not find significant spectroscopic evidence for oxygen, until 100 days\nafter maximum light. The +100 day identification of oxygen is tentative, and\nwould imply significant mixing of unburned or only slight processed elements\ndown to a velocity of 6,000 km/s. Our results are in relatively good agreement\nwith other analyses in the IR. We briefly compare SN 2011fe to SN 2014J and\nconclude that the differences could be due to different central densities at\nignition or differences in the C/O ratio of the progenitors.\n", "  The K2 Mission uses the Kepler spacecraft to obtain high-precision photometry\nover ~80 day campaigns in the ecliptic plane. The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog\n(EPIC) provides coordinates, photometry and kinematics based on a federation of\nall-sky catalogs to support target selection and target management for the K2\nmission. We describe the construction of the EPIC, as well as modifications and\nshortcomings of the catalog. Kepler magnitudes (Kp) are shown to be accurate to\n~0.1 mag for the Kepler field, and the EPIC is typically complete to Kp~17\n(Kp~19 for campaigns covered by SDSS). We furthermore classify 138,600 targets\nin Campaigns 1-8 (~88% of the full target sample) using colors, proper motions,\nspectroscopy, parallaxes, and galactic population synthesis models, with\ntypical uncertainties for G-type stars of ~3% in Teff, ~0.3 dex in log(g), ~40%\nin radius, ~10% in mass, and ~40% in distance. Our results show that stars\ntargeted by K2 are dominated by K-M dwarfs (~41% of all selected targets), F-G\ndwarfs (~36%) and K giants (~21%), consistent with key K2 science programs to\nsearch for transiting exoplanets and galactic archeology studies using\noscillating red giants. However, we find a significant variation of the\nfraction of cool dwarfs with galactic latitude, indicating a target selection\nbias due to interstellar reddening and the increased contamination by giant\nstars near the galactic plane. We discuss possible systematic errors in the\nderived stellar properties, and differences to published classifications for K2\nexoplanet host stars. The EPIC is hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space\nTelescopes (MAST): http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php.\n", "  We study the linear stability of asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in\ngeneral relativity in spacetime dimension $d\\ge4$. Our approach is an\nadaptation of the general framework of Hollands and Wald, which gives a\nstability criterion in terms of the sign of the canonical energy,\n$\\mathcal{E}$. The general framework was originally formulated for static or\nstationary and axisymmetric black holes in the asymptotically flat case, and\nthe stability analysis for that case applies only to axisymmetric\nperturbations. However, in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter case, the\nstability analysis requires only that the black hole have a single Killing\nfield normal to the horizon and there are no restrictions on the perturbations\n(apart from smoothness and appropriate behavior at infinity). For an\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole, we define an ergoregion to be a\nregion where the horizon Killing field is spacelike; such a region, if present,\nwould normally occur near infinity. We show that for black holes with\nergoregions, initial data can be constructed such that $\\mathcal{E}<0$, so all\nsuch black holes are unstable. To obtain such initial data, we first construct\nan approximate solution to the constraint equations using the WKB method, and\nthen we use the Corvino-Schoen technique to obtain an exact solution. We also\ndiscuss the case of charged asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes with\ngeneralized ergoregions.\n", "  We consider improving POWHEG+MINLO simulations, so as to also render them NLO\naccurate in the description of observables receiving contributions from events\nwith lower parton multiplicity than present in their underlying NLO\ncalculation. On a conceptual level we follow the strategy of the so-called\nMINLO' programs. Whereas the existing MINLO' framework requires explicit\nanalytic input from higher order resummation, here we derive an effective\nnumerical approximation to these ingredients, by imposing unitarity. This\noffers a way of extending the MINLO' method to more complex processes,\ncomplementary to the known route which uses explicit computations of\nhigh-accuracy resummation inputs. Specifically, we have focused on\nHiggs-plus-two-jet production (HJJ) and related processes. We also consider how\none can cover three units of multiplicity at NLO accuracy, i.e. we consider how\nthe HJJ-MINLO simulation may yield NLO accuracy for inclusive H, HJ, and HJJ\nquantities. We perform a feasibility study assessing the potential of these\nideas.\n", "  The decays of the antisymmetric dibaryon octet $D(8_F)$ into two baryon\noctets are considered. Sum rules for these decays in first order broken SU(3)\nare given. An SU(4) extension of the analysis is commented upon. Possibilities\nfor the experimental observation of multibaryon and anti-multibaryon states is\npointed out.\n", "  The Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) transport model is used to study the\nimpact on the choice of initial degrees of freedom on the final hadronic and\nelectromagnetic observables in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.\nWe find that a non-perturbative system of massive gluons (scenario I) and a\nsystem dominated by quarks and antiquarks (scenario II) lead to different\nhadronic observables when imposing the same initial energy-momentum tensor\n$T_{\\mu \\nu}(x)$ just after the passage of the impinging nuclei. In case of the\ngluonic initial condition the formation of $s,{\\bar s}$ pairs in the QGP\nproceeds rather slow such that the anti-strange quarks and accordingly the\n$K^+$ mesons do not achieve chemical equilibrium even in central Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Accordingly, the $K^+$ rapidity\ndistribution is suppressed in the gluonic scenario and in conflict with the\ndata from the BRAHMS Collaboration. The proton and antiproton rapidity\ndistributions also disfavor the scenario I. Furthermore, a clear suppression of\ndirect photon and dilepton production is found for the pure gluonic initial\nconditions which is not so clearly seen in the present photon and dilepton\nspectra from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV due to a large\ncontribution from other channels. It is argued that dilepton spectra in the\ninvariant mass range 1.2 GeV $< M <$ 3 GeV will provide a definitive answer\nonce the background from correlated $D$-meson decays is subtracted\nexperimentally.\n", "  The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often inferred from\ndata using probabilistic models, such as the Halo Occupation Distribution\n(HOD). Conventional HOD formulations assume that only halo mass governs the\ngalaxy-halo connection. Violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assembly\nbias, threaten the HOD program. We introduce decorated HODs, a new, flexible\nclass of models designed to account for assembly bias. Decorated HODs minimally\nexpand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditional\nand novel HOD parameters. We use decorated HODs to quantify the influence of\nassembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. For SDSS-like samples, the\nimpact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of two\non r ~ 200 kpc scales and ~15% in the linear regime. Assembly bias can either\nenhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increases\nclustering on scales r <~ 1 Mpc. We performed our calculations with Halotools,\nan open-source, community-driven python package for studying the galaxy-halo\nconnection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org). We conclude by describing the\nuse of decorated HODs to treat assembly bias in otherwise conventional\nlikelihood analyses.\n", "  The BB-mode angular correlation power spectrum of CMB is obtained by\nconsidering the primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state for\nvarious inflationary models and results are compared with the joint analysis of\nthe BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck 353 GHz data.\n  The present results may constrain several models of inflation.\n", "  Series connection of four quantum Hall effect (QHE) devices based on\nepitaxial graphene films was studied for realization of a quantum resistance\nstandard with an up-scaled value. The tested devices showed quantum Hall\nplateaux RH,2 at filling factor i = 2 starting from relatively low magnetic\nfield (between 4 T and 5 T) when temperature was 1.5 K. Precision measurements\nof quantized Hall resistance of four QHE devices connected by triple series\nconnections and external bonding wires were done at B = 7 T and T = 1.5 K using\na commercial precision resistance bridge with 50 microA current through the QHE\ndevice. The results showed that the deviation of the quantized Hall resistance\nof the series connection of four graphene-based QHE devices from the expected\nvalue of 4*RH,2 = 2h/e^2 was smaller than the relative standard uncertainty of\nthe measurement (< 1*10^-7) limited by the used resistance bridge.\n", "  We study perturbative general relativity with a two-form and a dilaton using\nthe double field theory formulation which features explicit index factorisation\nat the Lagrangian level. Explicit checks to known tree level results are\nperformed. In a natural covariant gauge a ghost-like scalar which contributes\neven at tree level is shown to decouple consistently as required by\nperturbative unitarity. In addition, a lightcone gauge is explored which\nbypasses the problem altogether. Using this gauge to study BCFW on-shell\nrecursion, we can show that most of the D-dimensional tree level S-matrix of\nthe theory, including all pure graviton scattering amplitudes, is reproduced by\nthe double field theory. More generally, we argue that the integrand may be\nreconstructed from its single cuts and provide limited evidence for off-shell\ncancellations in the Feynman graphs. As a straightforward application of the\ndeveloped technology double field theory-like expressions for four field string\ncorrections are derived.\n", "  We revisit one of the earliest proposals for deformed dispersion relations in\nthe light of recent results on dynamical dimensional reduction and production\nof cosmological fluctuations. Depending on the specification of the measure of\nintegration and addition rule in momentum space the model may be completed so\nas to merely deform Lorentz invariance, or so as to introduce a preferred\nframe. Models which violate Lorentz invariance have a negative UV asymptotic\ndimension and a very red spectrum of quantum vacuum fluctuations. Instead,\nmodels which preserve frame independence can exhibit running to a UV dimension\nof 2, and a scale-invariant spectrum of fluctuations. The bispectrum of the\nfluctuations is another point of divergence between the two casings proposed\nhere for the original model.\n", "  The measurement of the transverse momentum of W bosons in hadron collisions\nprovides not only an important test of QCD calculations, but also is an\nimportant input for the precision measurement of the W boson mass. While the\nmeasurement of the Z boson transverse momentum is experimentally well under\ncontrol, the available unfolding techniques for the W boson final states lead\ngenerically to relatively large uncertainties. In this paper, we present a new\nmethodology to estimate the W boson transverse momentum spectrum, significantly\nimproving the systematic uncertainties of current approaches.\n", "  We use observational data on the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia\nsupernovae together with constraints on the ages of the oldest stars to rule\nout a higher-dimensional extension of General Relativity with a negative\nkinetic-energy scalar field. This theory is of considerable physical interest\nbecause it produces accelerated expansion at both early and late times with a\nsingle new field, as in quintessential inflation scenarios. It is also of\nmathematical interest because it is characterized by an analytic expression for\nthe macroscopic scale factor $a(t)$. We show that cosmological solutions of\nthis theory can be usefully parametrized by a single quantity, the lookback\ntime $\\tau_{\\text{tr}}$ corresponding to the transition from deceleration to\nacceleration. Supernovae data from the recently released Supernova Cosmology\nProject Union 2.1 compilation single out a narrow range of values for\n$\\tau_{\\text{tr}}$. In the context of the theory, however, these same values of\n$\\tau_{\\text{tr}}$ imply that the universe is much older than the oldest\nobserved stars.\n", "  In this paper, we study $F(R)$ gravity by Hu-Sawicki model in\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The Friedmann\nequations are calculated by modified gravity action, and then the obtained\nFriedmann equations are written in terms of standard Friedmann equations. Next\nbehavior of bouncing cosmology is investigated in the modified gravity model,\ni.e., this behavior can solve problem of non-singular in standard Big Bang\ncosmology. We plot the cosmological parameters in terms of cosmic time and then\nbouncing condition is investigated. In what follows, we reconstruct the\nmodified gravity by redshift parameter, and also graphs of cosmological\nparameters are plotted in terms of redshift, in which the figures show us an\naccelerated expansion of Universe. Finally, the stability of the scenario is\ninvestigated by a function as sound speed, and the graph of sound speed versus\nredshift show us that there is the stability in late time.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation on the irradiation of copper thin\nfilms with high repetition rate femtosecond laser pulses (1040 nm, 50 MHz), in\nambient air and liquid water. We observe a novel, striking phenomenon of\nchromatic copper oxides (cupric oxide and cuprous oxide) annuli generation. The\ncharacteristic features of the chromatic copper oxide annuli are studied by\nexploiting micro-Raman Spectroscopy, Optical and Scanning Electron\nMicroscopies. In the case of irradiation in water, the seldom investigated\neffects of the immersion time, after irradiation with a fixed number of pulses,\nis analyzed, and an intriguing dependence of the color of the chromatic annuli\non the immersion time is observed. This remarkable behavior is explained by\nproposing an interpretation scenario addressing the various processes involved\nin the process. Our experimental findings show that cuprous oxide nanoparticles\n(size of ~20 nm) and cuprous oxide nanocubes (nanocube edges of ~30, ~60 nm)\nwith extremely fine sizes can be effectively generated by exploiting high\nrepetition rate laser-assisted oxidation.\n", "  The isoscalar monopole(ISM) and dipole(ISD) excitations in $^{12}$C are\ntheoretically investigated with the shifted antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics(AMD) plus $3\\alpha$-cluster generator coordinate method(GCM). The\nsmall amplitude vibration modes are described by coherent one-particle one-hole\nexcitations expressed by small shift of single-nucleon Gaussian wave functions\nwithin the AMD framework, whereas the large amplitude cluster modes are\nincorporated by superposing $3\\alpha$-cluster wave functions in the GCM. The\ncoupling of the excitations in the intrinsic frame with the rotation and parity\ntransformation is taken into account microscopically by the angular-momentum\nand parity projections. The present calculation describes the ISM and ISD\nexcitations in a wide energy region covering cluster modes in the low-energy\nregion and the giant resonances in the high-energy region, though the\nquantitative description of the high-energy part is not satisfactory. The\nlow-energy ISM and ISD strengths of the cluster modes are enhanced by the\nradial motion of $\\alpha$ clusters, and they split into a couple of states\nbecause of the angular motion of $\\alpha$ clusters. The low-energy ISM\nstrengths exhaust 26% of the EWSR, which is consistent with the experimental\ndata for the $^{12}$C($0^+_2$;7.65 MeV) and $^{12}$C($0^+_3$;10.3 MeV) measured\nby $(e,e')$, $(\\alpha,\\alpha')$, and ($^6$Li,$^6$Li$'$) scatterings. In the\ncalculated low-energy ISD strengths, two $1^-$ states (the $1^-_1$ and $1^-_2$)\nwith the significant strengths are obtained in $E=10-15$ MeV. It is indicated\nthat the ISD excitations can be a good probe to experimentally search for new\ncluster states such as the $^{12}$C($1^-_2$) obtained in the present\ncalculation.\n", "  By using a symmetry motivated basis to evaluate local distortions against\npair distribution function data (PDF), we show without prior bias, that the\noff-centre Ti displacements in the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3 are zone\ncentred and rhombohedral-like in nature across its known ferroelectric and\nparaelectric phases. With our newly-gained insight we construct a simple Monte\nCarlo (MC) model which captures our main experimental findings and demonstrate\nhow the rich crystallographic phase diagram of BaTiO3 emerges from correlations\nof local symmetry-breaking distortions alone. Our results strongly support the\norder-disorder picture for these phase transitions, but can also be reconciled\nwith the soft-mode theory of BaTiO3 that is supported by some spectroscopic\ntechniques.\n", "  The nearby cloud L1642 is one of only two known very high latitude (|b| > 30\ndeg) clouds actively forming stars. It is a rare example of star formation in\nisolated conditions, and can reveal important details of star formation in\ngeneral, e.g., of the effect of magnetic fields. We compare Herschel dust\nemission structures and magnetic field orientation revealed by Planck\npolarization maps in L1642. The high-resolution ($\\sim20\"$) Herschel data\nreveal a complex structure including a dense, compressed central clump, and low\ndensity striations. The Planck polarization data (at 10$'$ resolution) reveal\nan ordered magnetic field pervading the cloud and aligned with the surrounding\nstriations. There is a complex interplay between the cloud structure and large\nscale magnetic field. This suggests that the magnetic field is closely linked\nto the formation and evolution of the cloud. CO rotational emission confirms\nthat the striations are connected with the main clumps and likely to contain\nmaterial either falling into or flowing out of the clumps. There is a clear\ntransition from aligned to perpendicular structures approximately at a column\ndensity of $N_{\\rm{H}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{21}\\, {{\\rm cm}}^{-2}$. Comparing the\nHerschel maps with the Planck polarization maps shows the close connection\nbetween the magnetic field and cloud structure even in the finest details of\nthe cloud.\n", "  We explore quantum mechanical theories whose fundamental degrees of freedom\nare rectangular matrices with Grassmann valued matrix elements. We study\nparticular models where the low energy sector can be described in terms of a\nbosonic Hermitian matrix quantum mechanics. We describe the classical curved\nphase space that emerges in the low energy sector. The phase space lives on a\ncompact Kahler manifold parameterized by a complex matrix, of the type\ndiscovered some time ago by Berezin. The emergence of a semiclassical bosonic\nmatrix quantum mechanics at low energies requires that the original Grassmann\nmatrices be in the long rectangular limit. We discuss possible holographic\ninterpretations of such matrix models which, by construction, are endowed with\na finite dimensional Hilbert space.\n", "  General relativity has been widely tested in weak gravitational fields but\nstill stands largely untested in the strong-field regime. According to the\nno-hair theorem, black holes in general relativity depend only on their masses\nand spins and are described by the Kerr metric. Mass and spin are the first two\nmultipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all\nhigher-order moments. The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be\ntested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such\nhigher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for precision\ntests of general relativity with several experiments across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*\nwith current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital\nprecessions. Second, timing observations of radio pulsars near the Galactic\ncenter may detect characteristic residuals induced by the spin and quadrupole\nmoment of Sgr A*. Third, the Event Horizon Telescope, a global network of mm\nand sub-mm telescopes, aims to study Sgr A* on horizon scales and to image its\nshadow cast against the surrounding accretion flow using very-long baseline\ninterferometric (VLBI) techniques. Both NIR and VLBI observations may also\ndetect quasiperiodic variability of the emission from the accretion flow of Sgr\nA*. In this review, I discuss our current understanding of the spacetime of Sgr\nA* and the prospects of NIR, timing, and VLBI observations to test its Kerr\nnature in the near future. [abridged]\n", "  The $\\delta f$ particle-in-cell algorithm has been a useful tool in studying\nthe physics of plasmas, particularly turbulent magnetized plasmas in the\ncontext of gyrokinetics. The reduction in noise due to not having to resolve\nthe full distribution function indicates an efficiency advantage over standard\n(\"full-$f$\") particle-in-cell. Despite its successes, the algorithm behaves\nstrangely in some circumstances. In this work, we document a fully-resolved\nnumerical instability that occurs in the simplest of multiple-species test\ncases: the electrostatic $\\Omega_H$ mode. There is also a poorly-understood\nnumerical instability that occurs when one is under-resolved in particle\nnumber, which may require a prohibitively large number of particles to\nstabilize. Both of these are independent of the time-stepping scheme, and we\nconclude that they exist if the time advancement were exact. The exact analytic\nform of the algorithm is presented, and several schemes for mitigating these\ninstabilities are presented.\n", "  We show that the intensity of pumped states near Weyl point is different when\npumped with left- and right-handed circular polarized light, which leads to a\nspecial circular dichroism (CD) in time-dependent angle resolved photoemission\nspectra (ARPES). We derive the expression for the CD of time-dependent ARPES,\nwhich is directly related to the chirality of Weyl fermions. Based on the above\nderivation, we further propose a method to determine the chirality for a given\nWeyl point from the CD of time-dependent ARPES. The corresponding CD spectra\nfor TaAs has then been calculated from the first principle, which can be\ncompared with the future experiments.\n", "  We present a family of quantum error-correcting codes that support a\nuniversal set of transversal logic gates using only local operations on a\ntwo-dimensional array of physical qubits. The construction is a subsystem\nversion of color codes where gauge fixing through local measurements\ndynamically determines which gates are transversal. Although the operations are\nlocal, the underlying code is not topological in structure, which is how the\nconstruction circumvents no-go constraints imposed by the Bravyi-K\\\"onig and\nPastawski-Yoshida theorems. We provide strong evidence that the encoding has no\nerror threshold in the conventional sense, though it is still possible to have\nlogical gates with error probability much lower than that of physical gates.\n", "  Spectroscopic observations of the low luminosity Seyfert 1 nucleus in NGC\n3516 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope show that the visible spectrum is\ndominated by the Balmer emission lines of Hydrogen (H) and a continuum\nluminosity that rises into the UV. The anomalous H${\\alpha}$/H${\\beta}$\nemission line ratio, the Balmer emission line luminosity and the distinctive\nshape observed for the H${\\alpha}$ emission line profile serve as important\nconstraints in any photoionization model aimed at explaining the visible\nemission line spectrum of NGC 3516. Photoionization modeling using Cloudy\ndemonstrates that the central UV-X-ray source is able to completely ionize the\nH gas in between the Balmer and dust reverberation radii if the electron\ndensity is ${\\le}$ 3 ${\\times}$ 10${^7}$ cm${^{-3}}$ throughout. Thus,\naccording to this model the region responsible for producing the visible H\nlines is a dust free shell of ionized H gas. Interestingly, the model predicts\na rapid rise in the electron temperature as the central UV-X-ray source is\napproached, mirrored by an equally precipitous decrease in the Balmer line\nemissivity that coincides with the Balmer reverberation radius, providing a\nnatural explanation for the finite width observed for the H Balmer lines.\nCollectively, the merit of the model is that it explains the relative\nintensities of the three brightest Balmer lines, and the shape of the\nH${\\alpha}$ emission line profile. However, questions remain concerning the\nunusually weak forbidden lines that can not be addressed using Cloudy due to\nlimitations with the code.\n", "  Density functional theory calculations with a correction of the long-range\ndispersion force, namely the van der Waals (vdW) force, are performed for SiC\npolytypes. The lattice parameters are in good agreement with those obtained\nfrom experiments. Furthermore, the stability of the polytypes in the\nexperiments, which show 3C-SiC as the most stable, are reproduced by the\npresent calculations. The effect of the vdW force on the electronic structure\nand the stability of polytypes are discussed. We observe that the vdW\ninteraction is more sensitive to the cubic site than the hexagonal site. Thus,\nthe influence of the vdW force increases with decreasing the hexagonality of\nthe polytype, which results in the confirmation that the most stable polytype\nis 3C-SiC.\n", "  Adiabatic pulses are used extensively to enable robust control of quantum\noperations. We introduce a new approach to adiabatic control that uses the\nsuperadiabatic quality or $Q$-factor as a performance metric to design robust,\nhigh fidelity pulses. This approach permits the systematic design of quantum\ncontrol schemes to maximize the adiabaticity of a unitary operation in a\nparticular time interval given the available control resources. The interplay\nbetween adiabaticity, fidelity and robustness of the resulting pulses is\nexamined for the case of single-qubit inversion, and superadiabatic pulses are\ndemonstrated to have improved robustness to control errors. A numerical search\nstrategy is developed to find a broader class of adiabatic operations,\nincluding multi-qubit adiabatic unitaries. We illustrate the utility of this\nsearch strategy by designing control waveforms that adiabatically implement a\ntwo-qubit entangling gate for a model NMR system.\n", "  The synchronization behavior of delay coupled chaotic smooth unimodal maps\nover a ring network with stochastic switching of links at every time step is\nreported in this paper. It is observed that spatiotemporal synchronization\nnever appears for nearest neighbor connections; however, stochastic switching\nof connections with homogeneous delay $(\\tau)$ is capable of synchronizing the\nnetwork to homogeneous steady state or periodic orbit or synchronized\nchaotically oscillating state depending on the delay parameter, stochasticity\nparameter and map parameters. Linear stability analysis of the synchronized\nstate is done analytically for unit delay and the value of the critical\ncoupling strength, at which the onset of synchronization occurs is determined\nanalytically. The logistic map $rx(1-x)$ (a smooth unimodal map) is chosen for\nnumerical simulation purpose. Synchronized steady state or synchronized\nperiod-2 orbit is stabilized for delay $\\tau=1$. On the other hand for delay\n$\\tau=2$ the network is stabilized to the fixed point of the local map.\nNumerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytically\nobtained linear stability analysis results. Another interesting observation is\nthe existence of synchronized chaos in the network for delay $\\tau>2$.\nCalculating synchronization error and plotting time series data and Poincare\nfirst return map the existence of synchronized chaos is confirmed. The results\nhold good for other smooth unimodal maps also.\n", "  The total inclusive cross section for charged and neutral Higgs production in\nheavy-quark annihilation is presented through NNLO QCD. It is shown that, aside\nfrom an overall factor, the partonic cross section is independent of the\ninitial-state quark flavors, and that any interference terms involving two\ndifferent Yukawa couplings vanish. A simple criterion for defining the central\nrenormalization and factorization scale is proposed. Its application to the\n$b\\bar bH$ process yields results which are compatible with the values usually\nadopted for this process. Remarkably, we find little variation in these values\nfor the other initial-state quark flavors. Finally, we disentangle the impact\nof the different parton luminosities from genuine hard NNLO effects and find\nthat, for the central scales, a naive rescaling by the parton luminosities\napproximates the full result remarkably well.\n", "  By a hybrid integration of plasmonic and dielectric waveguide concepts, it is\nshown that coherent perfect absorption can be achieved in a co-propagant\ncoupler geometry. The device holds promises for classical and quantum signal\nprocessing. First, the operating principle of the proposed device is detailed\nin the context of a more general 2x2 lossy coupler formalism. Then, it is shown\nhow to tune the device in a wide region of possible working points, its\nbroadband operation, and the tolerance to fabrication uncertainties. Finally, a\ncomplete picture of the electromagnetic modes inside the hybrid structure is\nanalyzed, shining light onto the potentials which the proposed device holds in\nview of other applications like nonlinear optics, polarization control, and\nsensing.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of charged massive bosons\n$W^{\\pm }$ (spin-1 particles) from noncommutative charged black holes such as\ncharged RN black holes and charged BTZ black holes. By applying the WKB\napproximation and by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we derive the tunneling\nrate and the corresponding Hawking temperature for those black holes\nconfiguration. Furthermore, we show the quantum gravity effects using the GUP\non the Hawking temperature for the noncommutative RN black holes. The tunneling\nrate shows that the radiation deviates from pure thermality and is consistent\nwith an underlying unitary theory.\n", "  In Crull (2015) it is argued that, in order to confront outstanding problems\nin cosmology and quantum gravity, interpretational aspects of quantum theory\ncan by bypassed because decoherence is able to resolve them. As a result, Crull\n(2015) concludes that our focus on conceptual and interpretational issues,\nwhile dealing with such matters in Okon and Sudarsky (2014), is avoidable and\neven pernicious. Here we will defend our position by showing in detail why\ndecoherence does not help in the resolution of foundational questions in\nquantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem or the emergence of\nclassicality.\n", "  Recent work proposed a variant on Ramsey interferometry for coupled\nspin-$1/2$ systems that directly measures the retarded spin-spin Green's\nfunction. We expand on that work by investigating nonequilibrium retarded\nspin-spin Green's functions within the transverse-field Ising model. We derive\nthe lowest four spectral moments to understand the short-time behavior and we\nemploy a Lehmann-like representation to determine the spectral behavior. We\nsimulate a Ramsey protocol for a nonequilibrium quantum spin system that\nconsists of a coherent superposition of the ground state and diabatically\nexcited higher-energy states via a temporally ramped transverse magnetic field.\nWe then apply the Ramsey spectroscopy protocol to the final Hamiltonian, which\nhas a constant transverse field. The short-time behavior directly relates to\nLieb-Robinson bounds for the transport of many-body correlations, while the\nlong-time behavior relates to the excitation spectra of the Hamiltonian.\nCompressive sensing is employed in the data analysis to efficiently extract\nthat spectra.\n", "  An analogy is drawn between the diffusion-wave equations derived from the\nfractional Kelvin-Voigt model and those obtained from Buckingham's\ngrain-shearing (GS) model [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 2796-2815 (2000)] of wave\npropagation in saturated, unconsolidated granular materials. The material\nimpulse response function from the GS model is found to be similar to the\npower-law memory kernel which is inherent in the framework of fractional\ncalculus. The compressional wave equation and shear wave equation derived from\nthe GS model turn out to be the Kelvin-Voigt fractional-derivative wave\nequation and the fractional diffusion-wave equation respectively. Also, a\nphysical interpretation of the characteristic fractional-order present in the\nKelvin-Voigt fractional derivative wave equation and time-fractional\ndiffusion-wave equation is inferred from the GS model. The shear wave equation\nfrom the GS model predicts both diffusion and wave propagation in the\nfractional framework. The overall goal is intended to show that fractional\ncalculus is not just a mathematical framework which can be used to curve-fit\nthe complex behavior of materials, but rather it can be justified from real\nphysical process of grain-shearing as well.\n", "  We present the widest-field resolved stellar map to date of the closest\n($D\\sim3.8$ Mpc) massive elliptical galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus A; Cen A),\nextending out to a projected galactocentric radius of $\\sim150$ kpc. The\ndataset is part of our ongoing Panoramic Imaging Survey of Centaurus and\nSculptor (PISCeS) utilizing the Magellan/Megacam imager. We resolve a\npopulation of old red giant branch stars down to $\\sim1.5$ mag below the tip of\nthe red giant branch, reaching surface brightness limits as low as\n$\\mu_{V,0}\\sim32$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The resulting spatial stellar density map\nhighlights a plethora of previously unknown streams, shells, and satellites,\nincluding the first tidally disrupting dwarf around Cen A (CenA-MM-Dw3), which\nunderline its active accretion history. We report 13 previously unknown dwarf\nsatellite candidates, of which 9 are confirmed to be at the distance of Cen A\n(the remaining 4 are not resolved into stars), with magnitudes in the range\n$M_V=-7.2$ to $-13.0$, central surface brightness values of\n$\\mu_{V,0}=25.4-26.9$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and half-light radii of\n$r_h=0.22-2.92$ kpc. These values are in line with Local Group dwarfs but also\nlie at the faint/diffuse end of their distribution; interestingly, CenA-MM-Dw3\nhas similar properties to the recently discovered ultra-diffuse galaxies in\nVirgo and Coma. Most of the new dwarfs are fainter than the previously known\nCen A satellites. The newly discovered dwarfs and halo substructures are\ndiscussed in light of their stellar populations, and they are compared to those\ndiscovered by the PAndAS survey of M31.\n", "  We discuss spherically symmetric exact solutions of the Einstein equations\nfor quintessential matter surrounding a black hole, which has an additional\nparameter ($\\omega$) due to the quintessential matter, apart from the mass\n($M$). In turn, we employ the Newman\\(-\\)Janis complex transformation to this\nspherical quintessence black hole solution and present a rotating counterpart\nthat is identified, for $\\alpha=-e^2 \\neq 0$ and $\\omega=1/3$, exactly as the\nKerr\\(-\\)Newman black hole, and as the Kerr black hole when $\\alpha=0$.\nInterestingly, for a given value of parameter $\\omega$, there exists a critical\nrotation parameter ($a=a_{E}$), which corresponds to an extremal black hole\nwith degenerate horizons, while for $a<a_{E}$, it describes a non-extremal\nblack hole with Cauchy and event horizons, and no black hole for $a>a_{E}$. We\nfind that the extremal value $a_E$ is also influenced by the parameter $\\omega$\nand so is the ergoregion.\n", "  We study the entanglement structure and the topological edge states of the\nground state of the spin-1/2 XXZ model with bond alternation. We employ\nparity-density matrix renormalization group with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe finite-size scaling of R\\'enyi entropies $S_2$ and $S_\\infty$ are used to\nconstruct the phase diagram of the system. The phase diagram displays three\npossible phases: Haldane type (an example of symmetry protected topological\nordered phases), Classical Dimer and N\\'eel phases, the latter bounded by two\ncontinuous quantum phase transitions. The entanglement and non-locality in the\nground state are studied and quantified by the entanglement convertibility. We\nfound that, at small spatial scales, the ground state is not convertible within\nthe topological Haldane dimer phase. The phenomenology we observe can be\ndescribed in terms of correlations between edge states. We found that the\nentanglement spectrum also exhibits a distinctive response in the topological\nphase: the effective rank of the reduced density matrix displays a specifically\nlarge \"susceptibility\" in the topological phase. These findings support the\nidea that although the topological order in the ground state cannot be detected\nby local inspection, the ground state response at local scale can tell the\ntopological phases apart from the non-topological phases.\n", "  We explore the possibility of explaining the recent $\\sim 750$ GeV excesses\nobserved by ATLAS and CMS in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ spectrum in the context of a\ncompelling theory of Naturalness. The potential spin-zero resonance responsible\nfor the excesses also requires the existence of new heavy charged states. We\nshow that both such features are naturally realized in a see-saw Composite\nHiggs model for EWSB, where the new pseudo-Goldstone bosons are expected to be\ncomparatively heavier than the SM Higgs, and the new fermions have masses in\nthe TeV range. If confirmed, the existence of this new resonance could be the\nfirst stone in the construction of a new theory of Naturalness.\n", "  In this article we present exact calculations that substantiate a clear\npicture relating the confining force of QCD to the zero-modes of the\nFaddeev-Popov (FP) operator $\\mathcal{M}(A) = - \\partial \\cdot D(A)$. This is\ndone in two steps. First we calculate the spectral decomposition of the FP\noperator and show that the ghost propagator $\\mathcal{G}(k; A) = \\langle\n\\vec{k}| \\mathcal{M}^{-1}(A) | \\vec{k} \\rangle$ in an external gauge potential\n$A$ is enhanced at low $k$ in Fourier space for configurations $A$ on the\nGribov horizon. This results from the new formula in the low-$k$ regime\n$\\mathcal{G}^{ab}(k,A) = \\delta^{ab} \\lambda_{|\\vec{k}|}^{-1}(gA)$, where\n$\\lambda_{|\\vec{k}|}(gA)$ is the eigenvalue of the FP operator that emerges\nfrom $\\lambda_{|\\vec{k}|}(0) = \\vec{k}^2$ at $A$ = 0. Next we derive a strict\ninequality signaling the divergence of the color-Coulomb potential at low\nmomentum $k$ namely, $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{V}}(k) \\geq k^2 G^2(k)$ for $k \\to\n0$, where $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{V}}(k)$ is the Fourier transform of the\ncolor-Coulomb potential $\\mathcal{V}(r)$ and $G(k)$ is the ghost propagator in\nmomentum space. The first result holds in the Landau and Coulomb gauges,\nwhereas the second holds in the Coulomb gauge only. We propose a new numerical\nlattice gauge fixing that should be closer to the present analytic approach\nthan other numerical gauges.\n", "  We report on measurements of a charge-dependent flow using a novel\nthree-particle correlator with ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, and\ndiscuss the implications for observation of local parity violation and the\nChiral Magnetic Wave (CMW) in heavy-ion collisions. Charge-dependent flow is\nreported for different collision centralities as a function of the event charge\nasymmetry. While our results are in qualitative agreement with expectations\nbased on the CMW, the nonzero signal observed in higher harmonics correlations\nindicates a possible significant background contribution. We also present\nresults on a differential correlator, where the flow of positive and negative\ncharges is reported as a function of the mean charge of the particles and their\npseudorapidity separation. We argue that this differential correlator is better\nsuited to distinguish the differences in positive and negative charges expected\ndue to the CMW and the background effects, such as local charge conservation\ncoupled with strong radial and anisotropic flow.\n", "  Hamiltonian Truncation Methods are a useful numerical tool to study strongly\ncoupled QFTs. In this work we present a new method to compute the exact\ncorrections, at any order, in the Hamiltonian Truncation approach presented by\nRychkov et al. in Refs. [1-3]. The method is general but as an example we\ncalculate the exact $g^2$ and some of the $g^3$ contributions for the $\\phi^4$\ntheory in two dimensions. The coefficients of the local expansion calculated in\nRef. [1] are shown to be given by phase space integrals. In addition we find\nnew approximations to speed up the numerical calculations and implement them to\ncompute the lowest energy levels at strong coupling. A simple diagrammatic\nrepresentation of the corrections and various tests are also introduced.\n", "  We explain the recent diphoton excesses around $750$ GeV by both ATLAS and\nCMS as a singlet scalar $\\Phi$ which couples to SM gluon and neutral gauge\nbosons only through higher dimensional operators. A natural explanation is that\n$\\Phi$ is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) which receives parity violation\nthrough anomaly if there exists a hidden strong dynamics. The singlet and other\nlight pNGBs will decay into two SM gauge bosons and even serves as the\nmeta-stable coloured states which can be probed in the future. By accurately\nmeasuring their relative decay and the total production rate in the future, we\nwill learn the underlying strong dynamics parameter. The lightest baryon in\nthis confining theory could serve as a viable dark matter candidate.\n", "  We present a first principle approach to obtain analytical predictions for\nspherically-averaged cosmic densities in the mildly non-linear regime that go\nwell beyond what is usually achieved by standard perturbation theory. A large\ndeviation principle allows us to compute the leading-order cumulants of average\ndensities in concentric cells. In this symmetry, the spherical collapse model\nleads to cumulant generating functions that are robust for finite variances and\nfree of critical points when logarithmic density transformations are\nimplemented. They yield in turn accurate density probability distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) from a straightforward saddle-point approximation valid for\nall density values. Based on this easy-to-implement modification, explicit\nanalytic formulas for the evaluation of the one- and two-cell PDF are provided.\nThe theoretical predictions obtained for the PDFs are accurate to a few percent\ncompared to the numerical integration, regardless of the density under\nconsideration and in excellent agreement with N-body simulations for a wide\nrange of densities. This formalism should prove valuable for accurately probing\nthe quasi-linear scales of low redshift surveys for arbitrary primordial power\nspectra.\n", "  We present and study a model of 4-dimensional higher Chern-Simons theory,\nspecial Chern-Simons (SCS) theory, instances of which have appeared in the\nstring literature, whose symmetry is encoded in a skeletal semistrict Lie\n2-algebra constructed from a compact Lie group with non discrete center. The\nfield content of SCS theory consists of a Lie valued 2-connection coupled to a\nbackground closed 3-form. SCS theory enjoys a large gauge and gauge for gauge\nsymmetry organized in an infinite dimensional strict Lie 2-group. The partition\nfunction of SCS theory is simply related to that of a topological gauge theory\nlocalizing on flat connections with degree 3 second characteristic class\ndetermined by the background 3-form. Finally, SCS theory is related to a\n3-dimensional special gauge theory whose 2-connection space has a natural\nsymplectic structure with respect to which the 1-gauge transformation action is\nHamiltonian, the 2-curvature map acting as moment map.\n", "  The main purpose of this paper is to revisit the well known potentials,\ncalled stress functions, needed in order to study the parametrizations of the\nstress equations, respectively provided by G.B. Airy (1863) for 2-dimensional\nelasticity, then by E. Beltrami (1892), J.C. Maxwell (1870) and G. Morera\n(1892) for 3-dimensional elasticity, finally by A. Einstein (1915) for\n4-dimensional elasticity, both with a variational procedure introduced by C.\nLanczos (1949,1962) in order to relate potentials to Lagrange multipliers.\nUsing the methods of Algebraic Analysis, namely mixing differential geometry\nwith homological algebra and combining the double duality test involved with\nthe Spencer cohomology, we shall be able to extend these results to an\narbitrary situation with an arbitrary dimension n. We shall also explain why\ndouble duality is perfectly adapted to variational calculus with differential\nconstraints as a way to eliminate the corresponding Lagrange multipliers. For\nexample, the canonical parametrization of the stress equations is just\ndescribed by the formal adjoint of the n2(n2 -- 1)/12 components of the\nlinearized Riemann tensor considered as a linear second order differential\noperator but the minimum number of potentials needed in elasticity theory is\nequal to n(n -- 1)/2 for any minimal parametrization. Meanwhile, we can provide\nall the above results without even using indices for writing down explicit\nformulas in the way it is done in any textbook today. The example of\nrelativistic continuum mechanics with n = 4 is provided in order to prove that\nit could be strictly impossible to obtain such results without using the above\nmethods. We also revisit the possibility (Maxwell equations of electromag-\nnetism) or the impossibility (Einstein equations of gravitation) to obtain\ncanonical or minimal parametrizations for various other equations of physics.\nIt is nevertheless important to notice that, when n and the algorithms\npresented are known, most of the calculations can be achieved by using\ncomputers for the corresponding symbolic computations. Finally, though the\npaper is mathematically oriented as it aims providing new insights towards the\nmathematical foundations of elasticity theory and mathematical physics, it is\nwritten in a rather self-contained way.\n", "  In scenarios with sterile (right-handed) neutrinos that are subject to an\napproximate \"lepton-number-like\" symmetry, the heavy neutrinos (i.e. the mass\neigenstates) can have masses around the electroweak scale and couple to the\nHiggs boson with, in principle, unsuppressed Yukawa couplings while accounting\nfor the smallness of the light neutrinos' masses. In these scenarios, the\non-shell production of heavy neutrinos and their subsequent decays into a light\nneutrino and a Higgs boson constitutes a hitherto unstudied resonant\ncontribution to the Higgs production mechanism. We investigate the relevance of\nthis resonant mono-Higgs production mechanism in leptonic collisions, including\nthe present experimental constraints on the neutrino Yukawa couplings, and we\ndetermine the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to the heavy neutrinos.\nWith Monte Carlo event sampling and a simulation of the detector response we\nfind that, at future lepton colliders, neutrino Yukawa couplings below the\npercent level can lead to observable deviations from the SM and, furthermore,\nthe sensitivity improves with higher center-of-mass energies (for identical\nintegrated luminosities).\n", "  A partial screening of nucleon electric dipole moments (EDMs) in nuclear\nsystems, which is related to the Schiff mechanism known for neutral atomic\nsystems, is discussed. It is shown that the direct contribution from the\nneutron EDM to the deuteron EDM is partially screened by about 1% in a\nzero-range approximation calculation.\n", "  In this article we present a more detailed version of our recent Rapid\nCommunication [Phys. Rev. C 90, 051301(R) (2014)] where we calculate the\nnuclear matrix elements for neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge. For\nthe calculations we use a novel method that has perfect convergence properties\nand allows one to obtain the nonclosure nuclear matrix elements for $^{76}$Ge\nwith a 1% accuracy. We present a new way of calculation of the optimal closure\nenergy, using this energy with the closure approximation provides the most\naccurate closure nuclear matrix elements. In addition, we present a new\nanalysis of the heavy-neutrino-exchange nuclear matrix elements, and we compare\noccupation probabilities and Gamow-Teller strength with experimental data.\n", "  We compute the logarithmic coefficient of the entanglement entropy on a\nsphere for a Maxwell field in $d=4$ dimensions. In spherical coordinates the\nproblem decomposes into one dimensional ones along the radial coordinate for\neach angular momentum. We show the entanglement entropy of a Maxwell field is\nequivalent to the one of two identical massless scalars from which the mode of\n$l=0$ has been removed. This shows the relation $c^M_{\\log}=2\n(c^S_{\\log}-c^{S_{l=0}}_{\\log})$ between the logarithmic coefficient in the\nentropy for a Maxwell field $c^M_{\\log}$, the one for a $d=4$ massless scalar\n$c_{\\log}^S$, and the logarithmic coefficient $c^{S_{l=0}}_{\\log}$ for a $d=2$\nscalar with Dirichlet boundary condition at the origin. Using the accepted\nvalues for these coefficients $c_{\\log}^S=-1/90$ and $c^{S_{l=0}}_{\\log}=1/6$\nwe get $c^M_{\\log}=-16/45$, which coincides with Dowker's calculation, but does\nnot match the coefficient $-\\frac{31}{45}$ in the trace anomaly for a Maxwell\nfield. We have numerically evaluated these three numbers $c^M_{\\log}$,\n$c^S_{\\log}$ and $c^{S_{l=0}}_{\\log}$, verifying the relation, as well as\nchecked they coincide with the corresponding logarithmic term in mutual\ninformation of two concentric spheres.\n", "  The double-differential inclusive jet cross section is measured as a function\nof jet transverse momentum pT and absolute rapidity y, using proton-proton\ncollision data collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV and corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 5.43 inverse picoboarns. Jets are reconstructed within the pT\nrange of 74 to 592 GeV and the rapidity range |y| < 3.0. The reconstructed jet\nspectrum is corrected for detector resolution. The measurements are compared to\nthe theoretical prediction at next-to-leading-order QCD using different sets of\nparton distribution functions. This inclusive cross section measurement\nexplores a new kinematic region and is consistent with QCD predictions.\n", "  We define a `non-relativistic conformal method', based on a Schr\\\"odinger\nalgebra with critical exponent z = 2, as the non-relativistic version of the\nrelativistic conformal method. An important ingredient of this method is the\noccurrence of a complex compensating scalar field that transforms under both\nscale and central charge transformations. We apply this non-relativistic method\nto derive the curved space Newton-Cartan gravity equations of motion with\ntwistless torsion. Moreover, we reproduce z = 2 Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity by\nclassifying all possible Schr\\\"odinger invariant scalar field theories of a\ncomplex scalar up to second order in time derivatives.\n", "  We quantify the degree of inhomogeneity in the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG)\ndistribution from the SDSS DR7 as a function of length scales by measuring the\nShannon entropy in independent and regular cubic voxels of increasing grid\nsizes. We also analyze the data by carrying out measurements in overlapping\nspheres and find that it suppresses inhomogeneities by a factor of 5 to 10 on\ndifferent length scales. Despite the differences observed in the degree of\ninhomogeneity both the methods show a decrease in inhomogeneity with increasing\nlength scales which eventually settle down to a plateau at $\\sim 150 \\, h^{-1}\n\\rm {Mpc}$. Considering the minuscule values of inhomogeneity at the plateaus\nand their expected variations we conclude that the LRG distribution becomes\nhomogeneous at $150 \\, h^{-1} \\rm {Mpc}$ and beyond. We also use the\nKullback-Leibler divergence as an alternative measure of inhomogeneity which\nreaffirms our findings. We show that the method presented here can effectively\ncapture the inhomogeneity in a truly inhomogeneous distribution at all length\nscales. We analyze a set of Monte Carlo simulations with certain periodicity in\ntheir spatial distributions and find periodic variations in their inhomogeneity\nwhich helps us to identify the underlying regularities present in such\ndistributions and quantify the scale of their periodicity. We do not find any\nunderlying regularities in the LRG distribution within the length scales\nprobed.\n", "  We propose the use of D-brane realizations of Dynamical Supersymmetry\nBreaking (DSB) gauge sectors as sources of uplift in compactifications with\nmoduli stabilization onto de Sitter vacua. This construction is fairly\ndifferent from the introduction of anti D-branes, yet allows for tunably small\ncontributions to the vacuum energy via their embedding into warped throats. The\nidea is explicitly exemplified by the embedding of the 1-family $SU(5)$ DSB\nmodel in a local warped throat with fluxes, which we discuss in detail in terms\nof orientifolds of dimer diagrams.\n", "  We give an analytical description of the dynamics of the three-qubit Dicke\nmodel using the adiabatic approximation in the parameter regime where the\nqubits transition frequencies are far off-resonance with the field frequency\nand the interaction strengths reach the ultra-strong coupling regimes.\nQualitative differences arise when comparing to the single- and two-qubit\nsystems - simple analytic formulas show that three revival sequences produce a\nthree-frequency beat note in the time evolution of the population. We find an\nexplicit way to estimate the dynamics for the qubit-field and qubit-qubit\nentanglement inside the three-qubit system in the ultra strong coupling regime,\nand the resistance to the sudden death proves the robustness of the GHZ state.\n", "  The provision of accurate methods for predicting the climate response to\nanthropogenic and natural forcings is a key contemporary scientific challenge.\nUsing a simplified and efficient open-source general circulation model of the\natmosphere featuring O($10^5$) degrees of freedom, we show how it is possible\nto approach such a problem using nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Response\ntheory allows one to practically compute the time-dependent measure supported\non the pullback attractor of the climate system, whose dynamics is\nnon-autonomous as a result of time-dependent forcings. We propose a simple yet\nefficient method for predicting - at any lead time and in an ensemble sense -\nthe change in climate properties resulting from increase in the concentration\nof CO$_2$ using test perturbation model runs. We assess strengths and\nlimitations of the response theory in predicting the changes in the globally\naveraged values of surface temperature and of the yearly total precipitation,\nas well as in their spatial patterns. The quality of the predictions obtained\nfor the surface temperature fields is rather good, while in the case of\nprecipitation a good skill is observed only for the global average. We also\nshow how it is possible to define accurately concepts like the the inertia of\nthe climate system or to predict when climate change is detectable given a\nscenario of forcing. Our analysis can be extended for dealing with more complex\nportfolios of forcings and can be adapted to treat, in principle, any climate\nobservable. Our conclusion is that climate change is indeed a problem that can\nbe effectively seen through a statistical mechanical lens, and that there is\ngreat potential for optimizing the current coordinated modelling exercises run\nfor the preparation of the subsequent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel\nfor Climate Change.\n", "  We present calculations of dilepton and photon spectra for the energy range\n$E_{\\text{lab}}=2-35$ $A$GeV which will be available for the Compressed\nBaryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion\nResearch (FAIR). The same energy regime will also be covered by phase II of the\nBeam Energy Scan at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC-BES).\nCoarse-grained dynamics from microscopic transport calculations of the\nUltra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is used to\ndetermine temperature and chemical potentials, which allows for the use of\ndilepton and photon-emission rates from equilibrium quantum-field theory\ncalculations. The results indicate that non-equilibrium effects, the presence\nof baryonic matter and the creation of a deconfined phase might show up in\nspecific manners in the measurable dilepton invariant mass spectra and in the\nphoton transverse momentum spectra. However, as the many influences are\ndifficult to disentangle, we argue that the challenge for future measurements\nof electromagnetic probes will be to provide a high precision with\nuncertainties much lower than in previous experiments. Furthermore, a\nsystematic study of the whole energy range covered by CBM at FAIR and RHIC-BES\nis necessary to discriminate between different effects, which influence the\nspectra, and to identify possible signatures of a phase transition.\n", "  We develop, based on Baxter's corner transfer matrices, a renormalizable\nnumerically exact method for computation of the level density of the\nquasi-energy spectra of two-dimensional (2D) locally interacting many-body\nFloquet systems. We demonstrate its functionality exemplified by the kicked 2D\nquantum Ising model. Using the method, we are able to treat the system of\narbitrarily large finite size (for example 10000 x 10000 lattice). We clearly\ndemonstrate that the density of Floquet quasi-energy spectrum tends to a flat\nfunction in the thermodynamic limit for generic values of model parameters.\nHowever, contrary to the prediction of random matrices of the circular\northogonal ensemble, the decay rates of the Fourier coefficients of the Floquet\nlevel density exhibit rich and non-trivial dependence on the system's\nparameters. Remarkably, we find that the method is renormalizable and gives\nthermodynamically convergent results only in certain regions of the parameter\nspace where the corner transfer matrices have effectively a finite rank for any\nsystem size. In the complementary regions, the corner transfer matrices\neffectively become of full rank and the method becomes non-renormalizable. This\nmay indicate an interesting phase transition from an area- to volume- law of\nentanglement in the thermodynamic state of a Floquet system.\n", "  Ion acceleration due to the interaction between a short high-intensity laser\npulse and a moderately overdense plasma target is studied using Eulerian\nVlasov-Maxwell simulations. The effects of variations in the plasma density\nprofile and laser pulse parameters are investigated, and the interplay of\ncollisionless shock and target normal sheath acceleration is analyzed. It is\nshown that the use of a layered-target with a combination of light and heavy\nions, on the front and rear side respectively, yields a strong quasi-static\nsheath-field on the rear side of the heavy-ion part of the target. This\nsheath-field increases the energy of the shock-accelerated ions while\npreserving their mono-energeticity.\n", "  The ancient problem of the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter is reviewed\nwith an update on the status of the crises that were identified at an early\nstage by John Clark. We discuss how the initial problem with variational\ncalculations providing more binding than the two hole-line contribution for the\nsame interaction was overcome by calculations including three hole-line\ncontributions without however reproducing the empirical nuclear saturation\nproperties. It is argued that this remaining problem is still open because many\nsolutions have been proposed or ad hoc adjustments implemented without\ngenerating universal agreement on the proper interpretation of the physics. The\nproblem of nuclear saturation therefore persists leading to the necessity of an\nanalysis of the way the nuclear saturation properties are obtained from\nexperimental data. We clarify the role of short-range correlations and review\nresults for nuclear saturation when such ingredients are completely taken into\naccount using the Green's function method. The role of long-range correlations\nis then analyzed with special emphasis on the importance of attractive\npion-dominated excitation modes which inevitably lead to higher saturation\ndensities than observed. Because such modes have no counterpart in finite\nnuclear systems, it is therefore argued that they should not be considered when\ncalculating nuclear matter properties. The remaining open question is then\nwhether long-range correlations in finite nuclei which in turn have no\ncounterpart in infinite matter, represent the remaining missing ingredient in\nthis analysis.\n", "  Motivated by the recent diphoton excess reported by both the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations, we provide a model-independent combination of diphoton results\nobtained at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV at the LHC. We consider resonant s-channel\nproduction of a spin-0 and spin-2 particle with a mass of 750 GeV that\nsubsequently decays to two photons. The size of the excess reported by ATLAS\nappears to be in slight tension with other measurements under the spin-2\nparticle hypothesis.\n", "  This paper focuses on a constructive treatment of the mathematical formalism\nof quantum theory and a possible role of constructivist philosophy in resolving\nthe foundational problems of quantum mechanics, particularly, the controversy\nover the meaning of the wave function of the universe. As it is demonstrated in\nthe paper, unless the number of the universe's degrees of freedom is\nfundamentally upper bounded (owing to some unknown physical laws) or\nhypercomputation is physically realizable, the universal wave function is a\nnon-constructive entity in the sense of constructive recursive mathematics.\nThis means that even if such a function might exist, basic mathematical\noperations on it would be undefinable and subsequently the only content one\nwould be able to deduce from this function would be pure symbolical.\n", "  Using adiabatic high-resolution numerical simulations we quantify the effect\nof the streaming motion of baryons with respect to dark matter at the time of\nrecombination on structure formation and evolution. Formally a second order\neffect, the baryonic stream velocity has proven to have significant impact on\ndark matter halo abundance, as well as on the gas content and morphology of\nsmall galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the impact of stream velocity on\nthe formation and gas content of haloes with masses up to $10^9 M_{\\odot}$, an\norder of magnitude larger than previous studies. We find that the non-zero\nstream velocity has a sizable impact on the number density of haloes with\nmasses $\\lesssim$ few $\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ up to $z=10$, the final redshift\nof our simulations. Furthermore, the gas stream velocity induces a suppression\nof the gas fraction in haloes, which at z=10 is $\\sim 10 \\%$ for objects with\n$M\\sim10^7M_{\\odot}$, as well as a flattening of the gas density profiles in\nthe inner regions of haloes. We further identify and study the formation, in\nthe context of a non-zero stream velocity, of moderately long lived gas\ndominated structures at intermediate redshifts $10 < z < 20$, which Naoz and\nNarayan have recently proposed as potential progenitors of globular clusters.\n", "  We report electrical characterization of quantum dots formed by introducing\npairs of thin wurtzite (WZ) segments in zinc blende (ZB) InAs nanowires.\nRegular Coulomb oscillations are observed over a wide gate voltage span,\nindicating that WZ segments create significant barriers for electron transport.\nWe find a direct correlation of transport properties with quantum dot length\nand corresponding growth time of the enclosed ZB segment. The correlation is\nmade possible by using a method to extract lengths of nanowire crystal phase\nsegments directly from scanning electron microscopy images, and with support\nfrom transmission electron microscope images of typical nanowires. From\nexperiments on controlled filling of nearly empty dots with electrons, up to\nthe point where Coulomb oscillations can no longer be resolved, we estimate a\nlower bound for the ZB-WZ conduction-band offset of 95 meV.\n", "  We conjecture the form of the one-loop determinants for localized gauge\ntheories with eight supersymmetries on $d$-dimensional spheres. Combining this\nwith results for the localized action, we investigate the strong coupling\nbehavior in the large $N$ limit for a continuous range of $d$. In particular,\nwe find the $N$ dependence of the free energy for supersymmetric Yang-Mills\nwith only a vector multiplet in $3<d<4$ and for maximally supersymmetric\nYang-Mills in $3< d<6$. We also argue that this gives an effective way to\nregularize divergences after localization in $d=4$ for ${\\mathcal N}=2$ gauge\ntheories and $d=6$ for the maximally supersymmetric case.\n", "  We revisit the applications of quasi-linear theory as a paradigmatic model\nfor weak plasma turbulence and the associated bump-on-tail problem. The work,\npresented here, is built around the idea that large-amplitude or strongly\nshaped beams do not relax through diffusion only and that there exists an\nintermediate time scale where the relaxations are convective (ballistic-like).\nWe cast this novel idea in the rigorous form of a self-consistent nonlinear\ndynamical model, which generalizes the classic equations of the quasi-linear\ntheory to \"broad\" beams with internal structure. We also present numerical\nsimulation results of the relaxation of a broad beam of energetic particles in\ncold plasma. These generally demonstrate the mixed diffusive-convective\nfeatures of supra-thermal particle transport; and essentially depend on\nnonlinear wave-particle interactions and phase-space structures. Taking into\naccount modes of the stable linear spectrum is crucial for the self-consistent\nevolution of the distribution function and the fluctuation intensity spectrum.\n", "  We evaluate the 1-loop partition function of conformal gravity in four\ndimensions around an $AdS_4$ background, using the heat kernel techniques. We\ngive expressions for the relevant thermodynamical quantities and compare our\nresults with the ones from the literature.\n", "  In this paper, electromagnetic emissions produced in a thin beam-plasma\nsystem are studied using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. For the\nfirst time, the problem of emission generation in such a system is considered\nin the realistic formulation allowing for the continuous injection of a\nrelativistic electron beam through the plasma boundary. Specific attention is\ngiven to the thin plasma case in which the transverse plasma size is comparable\nto the typical wavelength of beam-driven oscillations. Such a case is often\nimplemented in laboratory beam-plasma experiments and has a number of\npeculiarities. Emission from a thin plasma does not require intermediate\ngeneration of electromagnetic plasma eigenmodes, as in the infinite case, and\nis more similar to the regular antenna radiation. In this work, we determine\nhow efficiently the fundamental and second harmonic emissions can be generated\nin previously modulated and initially homogeneous plasmas.\n", "  We present results of a search for the 3.5 keV emission line in our recent\nvery long (~ 1.4 Ms) XMM-Newton observation of the Draco dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy. The astrophysical X-ray emission from such dark matter-dominated\ngalaxies is faint, thus they provide a test for the dark matter origin of the\n3.5 keV line previously detected in other massive, but X-ray bright objects,\nsuch as galaxies and galaxy clusters. We do not detect a statistically\nsignificant emission line from Draco; this constrains the lifetime of a\ndecaying dark matter particle to tau > (7-9) x 10^27 s at 95% CL (combining all\nthree XMM-Newton cameras; the interval corresponds to the uncertainty of the\ndark matter column density in the direction of Draco). The PN camera, which has\nthe highest sensitivity of the three, does show a positive spectral residual\n(above the carefully modeled continuum) at E = 3.54 +/- 0.06 keV with a 2.3\nsigma significance. The two MOS cameras show less-significant or no positive\ndeviations, consistently within 1 sigma with PN. Our Draco limit on tau is\nconsistent with previous detections in the stacked galaxy clusters, M31 and the\nGalactic Center within their 1-2 sigma uncertainties, but is inconsistent with\nthe high signal from the core of the Perseus cluster (which has itself been\ninconsistent with the rest of the detections). We conclude that this Draco\nobservation does not exclude the dark matter interpretation of the 3.5 keV line\nin those objects.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the entanglement entropy for topological\ninterfaces in rational conformal field theories for the case where the\ninterface lies at the boundary of the entangling interval and for the case\nwhere it is located in the center of the entangling interval. We compare the\nresults to each other and also to the recently calculated left/right entropy of\na related BCFT. We also comment of the entanglement entropies for topological\ninterfaces for a free compactified boson and Liouville theory.\n", "  Considering the photoionization of Ar@C60 and Kr@C60 endofullerenes, the\ndecay of C60 innershell excitations through the outershell continuum of the\nconfined atom via the inter-Coulombic decay (ICD) pathway is detailed.\nExcitations to atom-C60 hybrid states demonstrate coherence between ICD and\nelectron-transfer mediated decay (ETMD). This should be the dominant\nabove-threshold decay process for a variety of confined systems, and the\nstrength of these resonances is such that they should be amenable for study by\nphotoelectron spectroscopy.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of CMB temperature peaks, including its effect\nover the polarization field, and allowing nonzero eccentricity. The formalism\nis developed in harmonic space and using the covariant derivative on the\nsphere, which guarantees that the expressions obtained are completely valid at\nlarge scales (i.e., no flat approximation). The expected patterns induced by\nthe peak, either in temperature or polarization, are calculated, as well as\ntheir covariances. It is found that the eccentricity introduces a quadrupolar\ndependence in the peak shape, which is proportional to a complex bias parameter\n$b_\\epsilon$, characterizing the peak asymmetry and orientation. In addition,\nthe one-point statistics of the variables defining the peak on the sphere is\nreviewed, finding some differences with respect to the flat case for large\npeaks. Finally, we present a mechanism to simulate constrained CMB maps with a\nparticular peak on the field, which is an interesting tool for analysing the\nstatistical properties of the peaks present in the data.\n", "  A new type of quasi-two-dimensional complex plasma system was observed which\nconsisted of monodisperse microspheres and their binary agglomerations\n(dimers). The particles and their dimers levitated in a plasma sheath at\nslightly different heights and formed two distinct sublayers. The sys- tem did\nnot crystallize and may be characterized as disordered solid. The dimers were\nidentified based on their characteristic appearance in defocused images, i.e.,\nrotating interference fringe pat- terns. The in-plane and inter-plane particle\nseparations exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the discharge pressure which\nagrees well with theoretical predictions.\n", "  Glitches are sudden jumps in the spin frequency of pulsars believed to\noriginate in the superfluid interior of neutron stars. Superfluid flow in a\nmodel neutron star is simulated by solving the equations of motion of a\ntwo-component superfluid consisting of a viscous proton-electron plasma and an\ninviscid neutron condensate in a spherical Couette geometry. We examine the\nresponse of our model neutron star to glitches induced in three different ways:\nby instantaneous changes of the spin frequency of the inner and outer\nboundaries, and by instantaneous recoupling of the fluid components in the\nbulk. All simulations are performed with strong and weak mutual friction. It is\nfound that the maximum size of a glitch that originates in the bulk decreases\nas the mutual friction strengthens. It is also found that mutual friction\ndetermines the fraction of the frequency jump which is later recovered, a\nquantity known as the 'healing parameter'. These behaviours may explain some of\nthe diversity in observed glitch recoveries.\n", "  We investigate the bulk orbital angular momentum (AM) in a two-dimensional\nhole-doped topological superconductor (SC) which is composed of a hole-doped\nsemiconductor thin film, a magnetic insulator, and an $s$-wave SC and is\ncharacterized by the Chern number $C = -3$. In the topological phase, $L_z/N$\nis strongly reduced from the intrinsic value by the non-particle-hole-symmetric\nedge states as in the corresponding chiral $f$-wave SCs when the spin-orbit\ninteractions (SOIs) are small, while this reduction of $L_z/N$ does not work\nfor the large SOIs. Here $L_z$ and $N$ are the bulk orbital AM and the total\nnumber of particles at zero temperature, respectively. As a result, $L_z/N$ is\ndiscontinuous or continuous at the topological phase transition depending on\nthe strengths of the SOIs. We also discuss the effects of the edge states by\ncalculating the radial distributions of the orbital AM.\n", "  In this work we consider the time evolution of charged Renyi entanglement\nentropies after exciting the vacuum with local fermionic operators. In order to\nexplore the information contained in charged Renyi entropies, we perform\ncomputations of their excess due to the operator excitation in 2d CFT, free\nfermionic field theories in various dimensions as well as holographically. In\nthe analysis we focus on the dependence on the entanglement charge, the\nchemical potential and the spacetime dimension. We find that excesses of\ncharged (Renyi) entanglement entropy can be interpreted in terms of charged\nquasiparticles. Moreover, we show that by appropriately tuning the chemical\npotential charged Renyi entropies can be used to extract entanglement in a\ncertain charge sector of the excited state.\n", "  We investigate the low energy behavior of local density of states in metallic\nC$_{60}$ polymers theoretically. The multichannel bosonization method is\napplied to electronic band structures evaluated from first principles\ncalculation, by which the effects of electronic correlation and nanoscale\ncorrugation in the atomic configuration are fully taken into account. We obtain\na closed-form expression for the power law anomalies in the local density of\nstates, which successfully describes the experimental observation on the \\fu\npolymers in a quantitative manner. An important implication from the\nclosed-form solution is the existence of an experimentally unobserved crossover\nat nearly a hundred milli-electron volts, beyond which the power law exponent\nof the \\fu polymers should change significantly.\n", "  We analyze a modification of the BFKL kernel for the adjoint representation\nof the colour group in the maximally supersymmetric (N=4) Yang-Mills theory in\nthe limit of a large number of colours, related to the modification of the\neigenvalues of the kernel suggested by S. Bondarenko and A. Prygarin in order\nto reach the Hermitian separability of the eigenvalues. We restore the modified\nkernel in the momentum space. It turns out that the modification is related\nonly to the real part of the kernel and that the correction to the kernel can\nnot be presented by a single analytic function in the entire momentum region,\nwhich contradicts the known properties of the kernel.\n", "  We construct exact, time-dependent, black hole solutions of\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with arbitrary dilaton coupling, $a$. For $a=1$\nthis theory arises as the four-dimensional low-energy effective description of\nheterotic string theory. These solutions represent electrically charged,\nspherically symmetric black holes emitting or absorbing charged null fluids and\ngeneralize the Vaidya and Bonnor-Vaidya solutions of general relativity and of\nEinstein-Maxwell theory, respectively. The $a=1$ case stands out as special, in\nthe sense that it is the only choice of the coupling that allows for a\ntime-dependent dilaton field in this class of solutions. As a by-product, when\n$a=1$ we show that an electrically charged black hole in this theory can be\novercharged by bombarding it with a stream of electrically charged null fluid,\nresulting in the formation of a naked singularity. This provides an example of\ncosmic censorship violation in an exact dynamical solution to low-energy\neffective string theory and in a case in which the total stress-energy tensor\nsatisfies all energy conditions. When $a\\neq1$, our solutions necessarily have\na time-independent scalar field and consequently cannot be overcharged.\n", "  Negative refraction has attracted much interest for its promising capability\nin imaging applications. Such an effect can be implemented by negative index\nmeta-materials, however, which are usually accompanied by high loss and\ndemanding fabrication processes. Recently, alternative nonlinear approaches\nlike phase conjugation and four wave mixing have shown advantages of low-loss\nand easy-to-implement, but associated problems like narrow accepting angles can\nstill halt their practical applications. Here we demonstrate theoretically and\nexperimentally a new scheme to realize negative refraction by nonlinear\ndifference frequency generation with wide tunability, where a thin BBO slice\nserves as a negative refraction layer bending the input signal beam to the\nidler beam at a negative angle. Furthermore, we realize optical focusing effect\nusing such nonlinear negative refraction, which may enable many potential\napplications in imaging science.\n", "  In this work, we study the motion of charged test particles in\nKerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime. We analyze the angular and the radial parts of\nthe orbit equations and examine the possible orbit types. We also investigate\nthe spherical orbits and their stabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the\nanalytical solutions of the equations of motion and express them in terms of\nJacobian and Weierstrass elliptic functions. Finally, we discuss the\nobservables of the bound motion and calculate the perihelion shift and\nLense-Thirring effect for three dimensional bound orbits.\n", "  This paper discusses the amplitude estimation using data originating from a\nsine-like function as probability density function. If a simple least squares\nfit is used, a significant bias is observed for small amplitudes. It is shown\nthat a proper treatment using the Feldman-Cousins algorithm of likelihood\nratios allows one to construct improved confidence intervals. Using Bayes'\ntheorem a probability density function is derived for the amplitude. It is used\nin an application to show that it leads to better estimates compared to a\nsimple least squares fit.\n", "  We analyze in the context of geometrothermodynamics the behavior of ideal\nquantum gases which satisfy either the Fermi statistics or the Bose statistics.\nAlthough the corresponding Hamiltonian does not contain a potential, indicating\nthe lack of classical thermodynamic interaction, we show that the curvature of\nthe equilibrium space is non-zero, and can be interpreted as a measure of the\neffective quantum interaction between the gas particles. In the limiting case\nof a classical Boltzmann gas, we show that the equilibrium space becomes flat,\nas expected from the physical viewpoint. In addition, we derive a thermodynamic\nfundamental equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation and, using the\nEhrenfest scheme, we show that it can be considered as a first order phase\ntransition which in the equilibrium space corresponds to a curvature\nsingularity. This result indicates that the curvature of the equilibrium space\ncan be used to measure the thermodynamic interaction in classical and quantum\nsystems.\n", "  We extend earlier work on fully symmetric polynomials for three-boson wave\nfunctions to arbitrarily many bosons and apply these to a light-front analysis\nof the low-mass eigenstates of $\\phi^4$ theory in 1+1 dimensions. The\nbasis-function approach allows the resolution in each Fock sector to be\nindependently optimized, which can be more efficient than the preset discrete\nFock states in DLCQ. We obtain an estimate of the critical coupling for\nsymmetry breaking in the positive mass-squared case.\n", "  In this article, we carefully derive the horizon condition at finite\ntemperature. Only the zero Matsubara mode is affected, and this result is\nconsistent with the suitably modified Maggiore-Schaden shift, which takes into\naccount temporal periodicity. We thus obtain a local, BRST-invariant action for\nQCD at finite temperature. The large-N limit and other calculational schemes\nfor the magnetic mass and its relation to the Gribov mass are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the production of a stochastic background of gravitational\nwaves in the electroweak phase transition. We consider extensions of the\nStandard Model which can give very strongly first-order phase transitions, such\nthat the transition fronts either propagate as detonations or run away. To\ncompute the bubble wall velocity, we estimate the friction with the plasma and\ntake into account the hydrodynamics. We track the development of the phase\ntransition up to the percolation time, and we calculate the gravitational wave\nspectrum generated by bubble collisions, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, and\nsound waves. For the kinds of models we consider, we find parameter regions for\nwhich the gravitational waves are potentially observable at the planned\nspace-based interferometer eLISA. In such cases, the signal from sound waves is\ngenerally dominant, while that from bubble collisions is the least significant\nof them. Since the sound waves and turbulence mechanisms are diminished for\nrunaway walls, the models with the best prospects of detection at eLISA are\nthose which do not have such solutions. In particular, we find that heavy extra\nbosons provide stronger gravitational wave signals than tree-level terms.\n", "  The search for the neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$) is one\nof the most important quests nowadays in neutrino physics. Among the different\ntechniques used, high pressure xenon (HPXe) gas time projection chambers (TPC)\nstand out because they allow to image the topology of the 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nevent (one straggling track ending in two blobs), and use it to discriminate\nsignal from background events. Recent results with microbulk Micromegas in Xe +\ntrimethylamine (TMA) mixtures show high promise in terms of gain, stability of\noperation, and energy resolution at high pressures (up to 10 bar). The addition\nof TMA at levels of ~1\\% reduces electron diffusion in up to a factor of 10\nwith respect pure Xe, improving the quality of the topological pattern, and\ntherefore the discrimination capability. Moreover microbulk Micromegas have\nvery low levels of intrinsic radioactivity. All these results show that a\nMicromegas-read High Pressure Xenon TPC (HPXe-TPC) can be a competitive\ntechnique in the search for 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$. The recently proposed PandaX-III\nexperiment, based on these results, aims at building a large TPC of 200 kg of\nenriched Xe, to be located at Jinping Underground laboratory in China. In this\ntalk the main features of the experiment will be presented, with an emphasis on\nthe design and tests of the microbulk readout, as well as the status of the\nproject and first results of the prototyping phase.\n", "  The thermal radiative near field transport between vanadium dioxide and\nsilicon oxide at submicron distances is expected to exhibit a strong dependence\non the state of vanadium dioxide which undergoes a metal-insulator transition\nnear room temperature. We report the measurement of near field thermal\ntransport between a heated silicon oxide micro-sphere and a vanadium dioxide\nthin film on a titanium oxide (rutile) substrate. The temperatures of the 15 nm\nvanadium dioxide thin film varied to be below and above the\nmetal-insulator-transition, the sphere temperatures were varied in a range\nbetween 100 and 200 Celsius. The measurements were performed using a\nvacuum-based scanning thermal microscope with a cantilevered resistive thermal\nsensor. We observe a thermal conductivity per unit area between the sphere and\nthe film with a distance dependence following a power law trend and a\nconductance contrast larger than 2 for the two different phase states of the\nfilm.\n", "  We present a quasi-integrable two-dimensional lattice equation: i.e., a\npartial difference equation which satisfies a criterion of integrability,\nsingularity confinement, although it has a chaotic aspect in the sense that the\ndegrees of its iterates exhibit exponential growth. By systematic reduction to\none-dimensional systems, it gives a hierarchy of ordinary difference equations\nwith confined singularities, but with positive algebraic entropy including a\ngeneralized form of the Hietarinta-Viallet mapping. We believe that this is the\nfirst example of such quasi-integrable equations defined over a two-dimensional\nlattice.\n", "  The ordering problem in quantum systems with position-dependent mass (PDM) is\ntreated by inclusion of the classically fictitious similarity transformation\ninto the kinetic term. This provides a generation of supersymmetry with the\nfirst order supercharges from the kinetic term alone, while inclusion of the\npotential term allows also to generate nonlinear supersymmetry with higher\norder supercharges. A broad class of finite-gap systems with PDM is obtained by\ndifferent reduction procedures, and general results on supersymmetry generation\nare applied to them. We show that elliptic finite-gap systems of Lame and\nDarboux-Treibich-Verdier types can be obtained by reduction to Seiffert's\nspherical spiral and Bernoulli lemniscate in the presence of Calogero-like or\nharmonic oscillator potentials, or by angular momentum reduction of a free\nmotion on some AdS_2-related surfaces in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm flux.\nThe limiting cases include the Higgs and Mathews-Lakshmanan oscillator models\nas well as a reflectionless model with PDM exploited recently in the discussion\nof cosmological inflationary scenarios.\n", "  We discuss what we take to be three possible misconceptions in the\nfoundations of general relativity, relating to: (a) the interpretation of the\nweak equivalence principle and the relationship between gravity and inertia;\n(b) the connection between gravitational redshift results and spacetime\ncurvature; and (c) the Einstein equivalence principle and the ability to\n\"transform away\" gravity in local inertial coordinate systems.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate that in the context of mimetic $F(R)$ gravity\nwith Lagrange multiplier, it is possible to realize cosmologies which are\ncompatible with the recent BICEP2/Keck Array data. We provide some\ncharacteristic examples for which the predicted scalar to tensor ratio can be\nquite smaller in comparison to the upper limit imposed by the BICEP2/Keck Array\nobservations.\n", "  Models beyond the Standard Model (bSM) often involve elaborate Higgs sectors,\nwhich can be a source of CP-violation. It brings up the question of recognizing\nin an efficient way whether a model is CP-violating. There is a diffuse belief\nthat the issue of explicit CP invariance can be linked to the existence of a\nbasis in which all coefficients are real; with even a theorem proposed a decade\nago claiming that the scalar sector of any multi-Higgs doublet model is\nexplicitly CP-conserving if and only if all of its coefficients can be made\nreal by a basis change. This is compounded by the fact that in all specific\nmulti Higgs models considered so far, the calculations complied with this\nclaim. Here, we present the first counterexample to this statement: a\nCP-conserving three-Higgs-doublet model for which no real basis exists. We\noutline the phenomenological consequences of this model, and notice that the\nextra neutral Higgs bosons are neither CP-even nor CP-odd but are \"half-odd\"\nunder the generalized CP-symmetry of the model.\n", "  Coherent twin boundaries form periodic lamellar twinning in a wide variety of\nsemiconductor nanowires, and are often viewed as near-perfect interfaces with\nreduced phonon and electron scattering behaviors. Such unique characteristics\nare of practical interest for high-performance thermoelectrics and\noptoelectronics; however, insufficient understanding of twin-size effects on\nthermal boundary resistance poses significant limitations for potential\napplications. Here, using atomistic simulations and ab-initio calculations, we\nreport direct computational observations showing a crossover from diffuse\ninterface scattering to superlattice-like behavior for thermal transport across\nnanoscale twin boundaries present in prototypical bulk and nanowire Si\nexamples. Intrinsic interface scattering is identified for twin periods larger\nthan or equal to 22.6 nm, but also vanishes below this size to be replaced by\nultrahigh Kapitza thermal conductances. Detailed analysis of vibrational modes\nshows that modeling twin boundaries as atomically-thin 6H-Si layers, rather\nthan phonon scattering interfaces, provides an accurate description of\neffective cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities in twinning\nsuperlattices, as a function of the twin period thickness.\n", "  The new scalar resonance contribution to the 750 GeV diphoton excess observed\nat the LHC 13 TeV necessarily interferes with the continuum background in the\n$gg\\to \\gamma \\gamma$. The interference has two considerable effects: (1)\nenhancing or suppressing diphoton signal rate due to the imaginary-part\ninterference and (2) distorting resonance shape due to the real-part\ninterference. From the best-fit study of two benchmark models (two Higgs\ndoublets with $\\sim$50 GeV widths and a singlet scalar with 5 GeV width, both\nextended with vector-like fermions), we find that the resonance contribution to\nthe 750 GeV excess can be enhanced by a factor of 2(1.6) for 3(6) fb signal\nrate and the 68%(95%) CL best-fit mass range can shift by 1-4 (any ${\\cal\nO}$(1)) GeV. If the best-fit excess rate decreases with future data, the\ninterference effects will become more significant. The inevitable interferences\ncan also provide a consistency check of a resonance hypothesis, whether or not\nfuture precision shape measurements confirm a Breit-Wigner shape or discover\ninteresting deviations.\n", "  A computationally efficient method for solving three-dimensional, viscous,\nincompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. The method formally\ndiscretizes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on an unbounded\nstaggered Cartesian grid. Operations are limited to a finite computational\ndomain through a lattice Green's function technique. This technique obtains\nsolutions to inhomogeneous difference equations through the discrete\nconvolution of source terms with the fundamental solutions of the discrete\noperators. The differential algebraic equations describing the temporal\nevolution of the discrete momentum equation and incompressibility constraint\nare numerically solved by combining an integrating factor technique for the\nviscous term and a half-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the convective term. A\nprojection method that exploits the mimetic and commutativity properties of the\ndiscrete operators is used to efficiently solve the system of equations that\narises in each stage of the time integration scheme. Linear complexity, fast\ncomputation rates, and parallel scalability are achieved using recently\ndeveloped fast multipole methods for difference equations. The accuracy and\nphysical fidelity of solutions is verified through numerical simulations of\nvortex rings.\n", "  The origin of short timescale (weeks/months) variability of AGN, whether due\nto intrinsic disc variations or reprocessing of X-ray emission by a surrounding\naccretion disc, has been a puzzle for many years. However recently a number of\nobservational programmes, particularly of NGC5548 with Swift, have shown that\nthe UV/optical variations lag behind the X-ray variations in a manner strongly\nsupportive of X-ray reprocessing. Somewhat surprisingly the implied size of the\naccretion disc is ~3x greater than expected from a standard, smooth,\nShakura-Sunyaev thin disc model. Although the difference may be explained by a\nclumpy accretion disc, it is not clear whether the difference will occur in all\nAGN or whether it may change as, eg, a function of black hole mass, accretion\nrate or disc temperature. Measurements of interband lags for most AGN require\nlong timescale monitoring, which is hard to arrange. However for low mass (<1\nmillion solar mass) AGN, the combination of XMM-Newton EPIC (X-rays) with the\noptical monitor in fast readout mode allows an X-ray/UV-optical lag to be\nmeasured within a single long observation. Here we summarise previous related\nobservations and report on XMM-Newton observations of NGC4395 (mass ~100x lower\nand accretion rate ~20x lower than for NGC5548). We find that the UVW1 lags the\nX-rays by ~470s. Simultaneous observations at 6 different ground based\nobservatories also allowed the g-band lag (~800s) to be measured. These\nobservations are in agreement with X-ray reprocessing but initial analysis\nsuggests that, for NGC4395, they do not differ markedly from the predictions of\nthe standard thin disc model.\n", "  We develop a model of bistable oscillator with nonlinear dissipation. Using a\nnumerical simulation and an electronic circuit realization of this system we\nstudy its response to additive noise excitations. We show that depending on\nnoise intensity the system undergoes multiple qualitative changes in the\nstructure of its steady-state probability density function (PDF). In\nparticular, the PDF exhibits two pitchfork bifurcations versus noise intensity,\nwhich we describe using an effective potential and corresponding normal form of\nthe bifurcation. These stochastic effects are explained by the partition of the\nphase space by the nullclines of the deterministic oscillator.\n", "  In this paper, we determine regular black hole solutions using a very general\n$f(R)$ theory, coupled to a non-linear electromagnetic field given by a\nLagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{NED}$. The functions $f(R)$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{NED}$\nare left in principle unspecified. Instead, the model is constructed through a\nchoice of the mass function $M(r)$ presented in the metric coefficients.\nSolutions which have a regular behaviour of the geometric invariants are found.\nThese solutions have two horizons, the event horizon and the Cauchy horizon.\nAll energy conditions are satisfied in the whole space-time, except the strong\nenergy condition (SEC) which is violated near the Cauchy horizon.\n", "  We determine the conditions for maximally supersymmetric AdS_5 vacua of\nfive-dimensional gauged N=2 supergravity coupled to vector-, tensor- and\nhypermultiplets charged under an arbitrary gauge group. In particular, we show\nthat the unbroken gauge group of the AdS_5 vacua has to contain an\nU(1)_R-factor. Moreover we prove that the scalar deformations which preserve\nall supercharges form a Kahler submanifold of the ambient quaternionic Kahler\nmanifold spanned by the scalars in the hypermultiplets.\n", "  We compute the free energy in the presence of a chemical potential coupled to\na conserved charge in effective O($n$) scalar field theory (without explicit\nsymmetry breaking terms) to NNL order for asymmetric volumes in general\n$d$--dimensions, using dimensional (DR) and lattice regularizations. This\nyields relations between the 4-derivative couplings appearing in the effective\nactions for the two regularizations, which in turn allows us to translate\nresults, e.g. the mass gap in a finite periodic box in $d=3+1$ dimensions, from\none regularization to the other. Consistency is found with a new direct\ncomputation of the mass gap using DR. For the case $n=4, d=4$ the model is the\nlow-energy effective theory of QCD with $N_{\\rm f}=2$ massless quarks. The\nresults can thus be used to obtain estimates of low energy constants in the\neffective chiral Lagrangian from measurements of the low energy observables,\nincluding the low lying spectrum of $N_{\\rm f}=2$ QCD in the $\\delta$--regime\nusing lattice simulations, as proposed by Peter Hasenfratz, or from the\nsusceptibility corresponding to the chemical potential used.\n", "  Gas flow in shale is associated with both organic matter (OM) and inorganic\nmatter (IOM) which contain nanopores ranging in size from a few to hundreds of\nnanometers. In addition to the noncontinuum effect which leads to an apparent\npermeability of gas higher than the intrinsic permeability, the surface\ndiffusion of adsorbed gas in organic pores also can influence the apparent\npermeability through its own transport mechanism. In this study, a generalized\nlattice Boltzmann model (GLBM) is employed for gas flow through the\nreconstructed shale matrix consisting of OM and IOM. The\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to assign the pore size\ndistribution to each component, and the dusty gas model (DGM) and generalized\nMaxwell-Stefan model (GMS) are adopted to calculate the apparent permeability\naccounting for multiple transport mechanisms including viscous flow, Knudsen\ndiffusion and surface diffusion. Effects of pore radius and pressure on\npermeability of both IOM and OM as well as effects of Langmuir parameters on OM\nare investigated. Moreover, the effect of total organic content and\ndistribution on the apparent permeability of the reconstructed shale matrix is\nalso studied. It is found that the distribution of OM and IOM has a negligible\ninfluence on apparent permeability, whereas the total organic content and the\nsurface diffusion play a significant role in gas transport in shale matrix.\n", "  We study parameter degeneracies that can occur in long-baseline neutrino\nappearance experiments due to nonstandard interactions (NSI) in neutrino\npropagation. For a single off-diagonal NSI parameter, and neutrino and\nantineutrino measurements at a single L/E, there exists a continuous four-fold\ndegeneracy (related to the mass hierarchy and $\\theta_{23}$ octant) that\nrenders the mass hierarchy, octant, and CP phase unknowable. Even with a\ncombination of NO$\\nu$A and T2K data, which in principle can resolve the\ndegeneracy, both NSI and the CP phase remain unconstrained because of\nexperimental uncertainties. A wide-band beam experiment like DUNE will resolve\nthis degeneracy if the nonzero off-diagonal NSI parameter is $\\epsilon_{e\\mu}$.\nIf $\\epsilon_{e\\tau}$ is nonzero, or the diagonal NSI parameter $\\epsilon_{ee}$\nis O(1), a wrong determination of the mass hierarchy and of CP violation can\noccur at DUNE. The octant degeneracy can be further complicated by\n$\\epsilon_{e\\tau}$, but is not affected by $\\epsilon_{ee}$.\n", "  We describe a numerical method to compute the action of Euclidean\nsaddlepoints for the partition function of a two-dimensional holographic CFT on\na Riemann surface of arbitrary genus, with constant curvature metric. We\nexplicitly evaluate the action for the saddles for genus two and map out the\nphase structure of dominant bulk saddles in a two-dimensional subspace of the\nmoduli space. We discuss spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries, and show\nthat the handlebody bulk saddles always dominate over certain non-handlebody\nsolutions.\n", "  We show that the S/F/S Josephson $\\varphi_0$-junction permits detection of\nmacroscopic quantum tunneling and quantum oscillation of the magnetic moment by\nmeasuring the ac voltage across the junction. Exact expression for the tunnel\nsplitting renormalized by the interaction with the superconducting order\nparameter is obtained. It is demonstrated that magnetic tunneling may become\nfrozen at a sufficiently large $\\varphi_0$. The quality factor of quantum\noscillations of the magnetic moment due to finite Ohmic resistance of the\njunction is computed. It is shown that magnetic tunneling rate in the\n$\\varphi_0$-junction can be controled by the supercurrent, with no need for the\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We present simultaneous optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarimetric results\nfor the black hole binary V404 Cygni spanning the duration of its 7-day long\noptically-brightest phase of its 2015 June outburst. The simultaneous R and\nKs-band light curves showed almost the same temporal variation except for the\nisolated (~30 min duration) orphan Ks-band flare observed at MJD 57193.54. We\ndid not find any significant temporal variation of polarization degree (PD) and\nposition angle (PA) in both R and Ks bands throughout our observations,\nincluding the duration of the orphan NIR flare. We show that the observed PD\nand PA are predominantly interstellar in origin by comparing the V404 Cyg\npolarimetric results with those of the surrounding sources within the 7'x7'\nfield-of-view. The low intrinsic PD (less than a few percent) implies that the\noptical and NIR emissions are dominated by either disk or optically-thick\nsynchrotron emission, or both. We also present the broadband spectra of V404\nCyg during the orphan NIR flare and a relatively faint and steady state by\nincluding quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL fluxes. By adopting a\nsingle-zone synchrotron plus inverse-Compton model as widely used in modeling\nof blazars, we constrained the parameters of a putative jet. Because the jet\nsynchrotron component cannot exceed the Swift/XRT disk/corona flux, the cutoff\nLorentz factor in the electron energy distribution is constrained to be <10^2,\nsuggesting particle acceleration is less efficient in this microquasar jet\noutburst compared to AGN jets. We also suggest that the loading of the baryon\ncomponent inside the jet is inevitable based on energetic arguments.\n", "  We have developed an analytical formulation to calculate the plasmon\ndispersion relation for a two-dimensional layer which is encapsulated within a\nnarrow spatial gap between two bulk half-space plasmas. This is based on a\nsolution of the inverse dielectric function integral equation within the\nrandom-phase approximation (RPA). We take into account the nonlocality of the\nplasmon dispersion relation for both gapped and gapless graphene as the\nsandwiched two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor plasma. The associated nonlocal\ngraphene plasmon spectrum coupled to the \"sandwich\" system is exhibited in\ndensity plots, which show a linear mode and a pair of depolarization modes\nshifted from the bulk plasma frequency.\n", "  We study the abundance of substructure in the matter density near galaxies\nusing ALMA Science Verification observations of the strong lensing system\nSDP.81. We present a method to measure the abundance of subhalos around\ngalaxies using interferometric observations of gravitational lenses. Using\nsimulated ALMA observations, we explore the effects of various systematics,\nincluding antenna phase errors and source priors, and show how such errors may\nbe measured or marginalized. We apply our formalism to ALMA observations of\nSDP.81. We find evidence for the presence of a $M=10^{8.96\\pm 0.12} M_{\\odot}$\nsubhalo near one of the images, with a significance of $6.9\\sigma$ in a joint\nfit to data from bands 6 and 7; the effect of the subhalo is also detected in\nboth bands individually. We also derive constraints on the abundance of dark\nmatter subhalos down to $M\\sim 2\\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$, pushing down to the\nmass regime of the smallest detected satellites in the Local Group, where there\nare significant discrepancies between the observed population of luminous\ngalaxies and predicted dark matter subhalos. We find hints of additional\nsubstructure, warranting further study using the full SDP.81 dataset\n(including, for example, the spectroscopic imaging of the lensed carbon\nmonoxide emission). We compare the results of this search to the predictions of\n$\\Lambda$CDM halos, and find that given current uncertainties in the host halo\nproperties of SDP.81, our measurements of substructure are consistent with\ntheoretical expectations. Observations of larger samples of gravitational\nlenses with ALMA should be able to improve the constraints on the abundance of\ngalactic substructure.\n", "  We propose that sub-Keplerian accretion belts around stars might launch jets.\nThe sub-Keplerian inflow does not form a rotationally supported accretion disk,\nbut it rather reaches the accreting object from a wide solid angle. The basic\ningredients of the flow are a turbulent region where the accretion belt\ninteracts with the accreting object via a shear layer, and two avoidance\nregions on the poles where the accretion rate is very low. A dynamo that is\ndeveloped in the shear layer amplifies magnetic fields to high values. It is\nlikely that the amplified magnetic fields form polar outflows from the\navoidance regions. Our speculative belt-launched jets model has implications to\na rich variety of astrophysical objects, from the removal of common envelopes\nto the explosion of core collapse supernovae by jittering jets.\n", "  We investigate the close connection between the quantum phase space Wigner\ndistribution of small-$x$ gluons and the color dipole scattering amplitude, and\npropose to study it experimentally in the hard diffractive dijet production at\nthe planned electron-ion collider. The angular correlation between the nucleon\nrecoiled momentum and the dijet transverse momentum will probe the nontrivial\ncorrelation in the phase space Wigner distribution. This experimental study\nwill not only provide us with three-dimensional tomographic pictures of gluons\ninside high energy proton, but also give a unique and interesting signal for\nthe small-$x$ dynamics with QCD evolution effects.\n", "  $1/N^2$ corrections to deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of charged leptons\nfrom glueballs at strong coupling are investigated in the framework of the\ngauge/gravity duality. The structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ (and also $F_L$)\nare studied at subleading order in the $1/N^2$ expansion, in terms of $q^2$ and\nthe Bjorken parameter $x$. The relevant type IIB supergravity one-loop diagrams\n(which correspond to DIS with two-hadron final states) are studied in detail,\nwhile $n$-loop diagrams (corresponding to DIS with $(n+1)$-hadron final states)\nare briefly discussed. The $1/N^{2n}$ and $\\Lambda^2/q^2$ dependence of the\nstructure functions is analyzed. Within this context two very different limits\nare considered: one is the large $N$ limit and the other one is when the\nvirtual photon momentum transfer $q$ is much larger than the infrared confining\nscale $\\Lambda$. These limits do not commute.\n", "  I present analytical expressions for the cusp anomalous dimension in QCD\nthrough three loops in terms of elementary functions and ordinary\npolylogarithms. I observe interesting relations between the results at\ndifferent loops and provide a conjecture for the $n$-loop cusp anomalous\ndimension in terms of the lower-loop results. I also present numerical results\nand simple approximate formulas for the cusp anomalous dimension relevant to\ntop-quark production.\n", "  The massive photometric data collected from multiple large-scale sky surveys\noffer significant opportunities for measuring distances of celestial objects by\nphotometric redshifts. However, catastrophic failure is still an unsolved\nproblem for a long time and exists in the current photometric redshift\nestimation approaches (such as $k$-nearest-neighbor). In this paper, we propose\na novel two-stage approach by integration of $k$-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and\nsupport vector machine (SVM) methods together. In the first stage, we apply KNN\nalgorithm on photometric data and estimate their corresponding z$_{\\rm phot}$.\nBy analysis, we find two dense regions with catastrophic failure, one in the\nrange of z$_{\\rm phot}\\in[0.3,1.2]$, the other in the range of z$_{\\rm phot}\\in\n[1.2,2.1]$. In the second stage, we map the photometric input pattern of points\nfalling into the two ranges from original attribute space into a high\ndimensional feature space by Gaussian kernel function in SVM. In the high\ndimensional feature space, many outlier points resulting from catastrophic\nfailure by simple Euclidean distance computation in KNN can be identified by a\nclassification hyperplane of SVM and further be corrected. Experimental results\nbased on the SDSS (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) quasar data show that the\ntwo-stage fusion approach can significantly mitigate catastrophic failure and\nimprove the estimation accuracy of photometric redshifts of quasars. The\npercents in different |$\\Delta$z| ranges and rms (root mean square) error by\nthe integrated method are $83.47\\%$, $89.83\\%$, $90.90\\%$ and 0.192,\nrespectively, compared to the results by KNN ($71.96\\%$, $83.78\\%$, $89.73\\%$\nand 0.204).\n", "  La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ polycrystalline samples have been prepared using\ndifferent synthesis routes. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) confirms that the samples\nare of single phase with R$\\bar{3}$c space group. The surface morphology and\nparticle size has been measured using Field Emission Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy (FESEM). Magnetic measurement shows that the magnetization in the\nmaterials are affected by low crystallite size which destroys the spin ordering\ndue to strain at grain boundaries and in turn also lead to reduction in\nmagnetization as well as an enhanced coercivity in the material.\n", "  We study N = 2 superconformal theories with gauge group SU(N) and 2N\nfundamental flavours in a locus of the Coulomb branch with a Z_N symmetry. In\nthis special vacuum, we calculate the prepotential, the dual periods and the\nperiod matrix using equivariant localization. When the flavours are massless,\nwe find that the period matrix is completely specified by [N/2] effective\ncouplings. On each of these, we show that the S-duality group acts as a\ngeneralized triangle group and that its hauptmodul can be used to write a\nnon-perturbatively exact relation between each effective coupling and the bare\none. For N = 2, 3, 4 and 6, the generalized triangle group is an arithmetic\nHecke group which contains a subgroup that is also a congruence subgroup of the\nmodular group PSL(2,Z). For these cases, we introduce mass deformations that\nrespect the symmetries of the special vacuum and show that the constraints\narising from S-duality make it possible to resum the instanton contributions to\nthe period matrix in terms of meromorphic modular forms which solve modular\nanomaly equations.\n", "  This contribution will survey recent progress toward an understanding of\ndiverse pairing phenomena in dilute nuclear matter at small and moderate\nisospin asymmetry, with results of potential relevance to supernova envelopes\nand proto-neutron stars. Application of {\\it ab initio} many-body techniques\nhas revealed a rich array of temperature-density phase diagrams, indexed by\nisospin asymmetry, which feature both conventional and unconventional\nsuperfluid phases. At low density there exist a homogeneous translationally\ninvariant BCS phase, a homogeneous LOFF phase violating translational\ninvariance, and an inhomogeneous translationally invariant phase-separated BCS\nphase. The transition from the BCS to the BEC phases is characterized in terms\nof the evolution, from weak to strong coupling, of the pairing gap, condensate\nwave function, and quasiparticle occupation numbers and spectra. Additionally,\na schematic formal analysis of pairing in neutron matter at low to moderate\ndensities is presented that establishes conditions for the emergence of both\nconventional and unconventional pairing solutions and encompasses the\npossibility of dineutron formation.\n", "  Generalizing the Randall-Sundrum scenario to higher dimensions with nested\nwarpings has been shown to avoid the constraints besetting the former. In the\nfirst paper of this series [JHEP 1509 (2015) 202], the Standard Model gauge and\nfermion fields were extended into such a six-dimensional bulk and the\nconstruction was shown to have several interesting and welcome features. In\nthis paper, we discuss the electroweak symmetry breaking, presenting a novel\nHiggs localization mechanism that leads to interesting phenomenology in the\nHiggs sector. Localizing the Higgs modifies the $Z_{\\mu}$ and $W_{\\mu}$ boson\nwavefunctions, which leads to tree level changes in the oblique parameters.\nUsing these as well as the correction to low-energy four-Fermi operators, we\nderive the constraints on our model and also discuss the gauge coupling\nevolution therein. Amusingly, the model can naturally incorporate a Higgs\nresonance in the 700--800 GeV range.\n", "  Granting information privacy is of crucial importance in our society, notably\nin fiber communication networks. Quantum cryptography provides a unique means\nto establish, at remote locations, identical strings of genuine random bits,\nwith a level of secrecy unattainable using classical resources. However,\nseveral constraints, such as non-optimized photon number statistics and\nresources, detectors' noise, and optical losses, currently limit the\nperformances in terms of both achievable secret key rates and distances. Here,\nthese issues are addressed using an approach that combines both fundamental and\noff-the-shelves technological resources. High-quality bipartite photonic\nentanglement is distributed over a 150 km fiber link, exploiting a wavelength\ndemultiplexing strategy implemented at the end-user locations. It is shown how\ncoincidence rates scale linearly with the number of employed telecommunication\nchannels, with values outperforming previous realizations by almost one order\nof magnitude. Thanks to its potential of scalability and compliance with\ndevice-independent strategies, this system is ready for real quantum\napplications, notably entanglement-based quantum cryptography.\n", "  We study the nature of a family of curvature singularities which are\nprecisely the timelike cousins of the spacelike singularities studied by\nBelinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (BKL). We show that the approach to the\nsingularity can be modeled by a billiard ball problem on hyperbolic space, just\nas in the case of BKL. For pure gravity, generic chaotic behavior is retained\nin (3+1) dimensions, and we provide evidence that it disappears in higher\ndimensions. We speculate that such singularities, if occurring in AdS/CFT and\nof the chaotic variety, may be interpreted as (transient) chaotic\nrenormalization group flows which exhibit features reminiscent of chaotic\nduality cascades.\n", "  We compile and analyze the sunspot observations made by John Flamsteed for\nthe period 1672-1703, corresponding to the second part of the Maunder Minimum,\nwhich appear in the correspondence of this famous astronomer. We include in an\nappendix the original texts of the sunspot records kept by Flamsteed. We\ncompute an estimate of the level of solar activity using these records, and\ncompare the results with the latest reconstructions of solar activity during\nthe Maunder Minimum, obtaining values characteristic of a grand solar minimum.\nFinally, we discuss a phenomenon observed and described by Stephen Gray in 1705\nthat has been interpreted as a white-light flare.\n", "  We discuss consequences of the breaking of conformal symmetry by a flat or\nspherical extended operator. We adapt the embedding formalism to the study of\ncorrelation functions of symmetric traceless tensors in the presence of the\ndefect. Two-point functions of a bulk and a defect primary are fixed by\nconformal invariance up to a set of OPE coefficients, and we identify the\nallowed tensor structures. A correlator of two bulk primaries depends on two\ncross-ratios, and we study its conformal block decomposition in the case of\nexternal scalars. The Casimir equation in the defect channel reduces to a\nhypergeometric equation, while the bulk channel blocks are recursively\ndetermined in the light-cone limit. In the special case of a defect of\ncodimension two, we map the Casimir equation in the bulk channel to the one of\na four-point function without defect. Finally, we analyze the contact terms of\nthe stress-tensor with the extended operator, and we deduce constraints on the\nCFT data. In two dimensions, we relate the displacement operator, which appears\namong the contact terms, to the reflection coefficient of a conformal\ninterface, and we find unitarity bounds for the latter.\n", "  By decreasing the transversal confinement potential in interacting\none-dimensional spinless electrons and populating the second energetically\nlowest sub-band, for not too strong interactions system transitions into a\nquasi-one-dimensional state with dominant superconducting correlations and one\ngapless mode. By combining effective field theory approach and numerical\ndensity matrix renormalization group simulations we show that this\nquasi-one-dimensional state is a topological state that hosts zero-energy edge\nmodes. We also study the single-particle correlations across the interface\nbetween this quasi-one-dimensional and single-channel states.\n", "  We revisit the backgrounds of type IIB on manifolds with $SU(4)$-structure\nand discuss two sets of solutions arising from internal geometries that are\ncomplex and symplectic respectively. Both can be realized in terms of\ngeneralized complex geometry. We identify a map which relates the complex and\nsymplectic supersymmetric systems. In the semi-flat torus bundle setting this\nmap corresponds to T-duality and suggest a way of extending the mirror\ntransform to non-K\\\"ahler geometries.\n", "  Proper balance between exploitation and exploration is what makes good\ndecisions, which achieve high rewards like payoff or evolutionary fitness. The\nInfomax principle postulates that maximization of information directs the\nfunction of diverse systems, from living systems to artificial neural networks.\nWhile specific applications are successful, the validity of information as a\nproxy for reward remains unclear. Here, we consider the multi-armed bandit\ndecision problem, which features arms (slot-machines) of unknown probabilities\nof success and a player trying to maximize cumulative payoff by choosing the\nsequence of arms to play. We show that an Infomax strategy (Info-p) which\noptimally gathers information on the highest mean reward among the arms\nsaturates known optimal bounds and compares favorably to existing policies. The\nhighest mean reward considered by Info-p is not the quantity actually needed\nfor the choice of the arm to play, yet it allows for optimal tradeoffs between\nexploration and exploitation.\n", "  We construct two simple effective field theory versions of {\\it Hybrid\nNatural Inflation (HNI)} that illustrate the range of its phenomenological\nimplications. The resulting inflationary sector potential,\n$V=\\Delta^4(1+a\\cos(\\phi/f))$, arises naturally, with the inflaton field a\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. The end of inflation is triggered by a waterfall\nfield and the conditions for this to happen are determined. Also of interest is\nthe fact that the slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon$ (and hence the tensor $r$) is\na non-monotonic function of the field with a maximum where observables take\nuniversal values that determines the maximum possible tensor to scalar ratio\n$r$. In one of the models the inflationary scale can be as low as the\nelectroweak scale. We explore in detail the associated HNI phenomenology,\ntaking account of the constraints from Black Hole production, and perform a\ndetailed fit to the Planck 2015 temperature and polarisation data.\n", "  KIC8462852 is a completely-ordinary F3 main sequence star, except that the\nlight curve from Kepler shows episodes of unique and inexplicable day-long dips\nwith up to 20% dimming. Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band\nmagnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at\nHarvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of\n0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,\nKIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because\nnearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is\nunprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century.\n", "  We show that curvature-induced inhomogeneous strain distributions in\nnanoscale buckled semiconducting ribbons lead to the existence of end states\nwhich are topologically protected by inversion symmetry. These end-state\ndoublets, corresponding to the so-called Maue-Shockley states, are robust\nagainst weak disorder. By identifying and calculating the corresponding\ntopological invariants, we further show that a buckled semiconducting ribbon\nundergoes topological phase transitions between trivial and non-trivial\ninsulating phases by varying its real space geometry.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations are the origin of genuine quantum many-body effects, and\ncan be neglected in classical mean-field phenomena. Here we report on the\nobservation of stable quantum droplets containing $\\sim$ 800 atoms which are\nexpected to collapse at the mean-field level due to the essentially attractive\ninteraction. By systematic measurements on individual droplets we demonstrate\nquantitatively that quantum fluctuations stabilize them against the mean-field\ncollapse. We observe in addition interference of several droplets indicating\nthat this stable many-body state is phase coherent.\n", "  Semiconductor materials that can be doped both n-type and p-type are\ndesirable for diode-based applications and transistor technology. Copper\nnitride (Cu3N) is a metastable semiconductor with a solar-relevant bandgap that\nhas been reported to exhibit bipolar doping behavior. However, deeper\nunderstanding and better control of the mechanism behind this behavior in Cu3N\nis currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we use combinatorial\ngrowth with a temperature gradient to demonstrate both conduction types of\nphase-pure, sputter-deposited Cu3N thin films. Room temperature Hall effect and\nSeebeck effect measurements show n-type Cu3N with 10^17 electrons/cm^3 for low\ngrowth temperature (~35 degrees C) and p-type with 10^15-10^16 holes/cm^3 for\nelevated growth temperatures (50-120 degrees C). Mobility for both types of\nCu3N was ~0.1-1 cm^2/Vs. Additionally, temperature- dependent Hall effect\nmeasurements indicate that ionized defects are an important scattering\nmechanism in p-type films. By combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy and\nfirst-principles defect theory, we determined that V_Cu defects form\npreferentially in p-type Cu3N while Cu_i defects form preferentially in n-type\nCu3N. Based on these theoretical and experimental results, we propose a kinetic\ndefect formation mechanism for bipolar doping in Cu3N, that is also supported\nby positron annihilation experiments. Overall, the results of this work\nhighlight the importance of kinetic processes in the defect physics of\nmetastable materials, and provide a framework that can be applied when\nconsidering the properties of such materials in general.\n", "  We present a list of candidate gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming\ngalaxies (DSFGs) from the HerMES Large Mode Survey (HeLMS) and the Herschel\nStripe 82 Survey (HerS). Together, these partially overlapping surveys cover\n372 deg$^{2}$ on the sky. After removing local spiral galaxies and known\nradio-loud blazars, our candidate list of lensed DSFGs is composed of 77\nsources with 500 $\\mu$m flux densities ($S_{500}$) greater than 100 mJy. Such\nsources are dusty starburst galaxies similar to the first bright Sub Millimeter\nGalaxies (SMGs) discovered with SCUBA. We expect a large fraction of this list\nto be strongly lensed, with a small fraction made up of bright SMG-SMG mergers\nthat appear as Hyper-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (HyLIRGs; $\\rm L_{IR}>10^{13}\nL_{\\odot}$). Thirteen of the 77 candidates have spectroscopic redshifts from CO\nspectroscopy with ground-based interferometers, putting them at $z>1$ and well\nabove the redshift of the foreground lensing galaxies. The surface density of\nour sample is 0.21 $\\pm$ 0.03 deg$^{-2}$. We present follow-up imaging of a few\nof the candidates confirming their lensing nature. The sample presented here is\nan ideal tool for higher resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations to\nunderstand detailed properties of starburst phenomena in distant galaxies.\n", "  Stable laser sources at 461 nm are important for optical cooling of strontium\natoms. In most existing experiments this wavelength is obtained by frequency\ndoubling infrared lasers, since blue laser diodes either have low power or\nlarge emission bandwidths. Here, we show that injecting less than 10 mW of\nmonomode laser radiation into a blue multimode 500 mW high power laser diode is\ncapable of slaving at least 50% of the power to the desired frequency. We\nverify the emission bandwidth reduction by saturation spectroscopy on a\nstrontium gas cell and by direct beating of the slave with the master laser. We\nalso demonstrate that the laser can efficiently be used within the Zeeman\nslower for optical cooling of a strontium atomic beam.\n", "  We develop the event-by-event picture of the gluon distribution produced via\nmedium-induced gluon branching by an energetic jet which propagates through a\ndense QCD medium. A typical event is characterized by the production of a large\nnumber of soft gluons which propagate at large angles with respect to the jet\naxis and which collectively carry a substantial amount of energy. By explicitly\ncomputing 2-gluon correlations, we demonstrate the existence of large\nevent-by-event fluctuations, which reflect the stochastic nature of the\nbranching process. For the two quantities that we have investigated -- the\nenergy loss at large angles and the soft gluon multiplicity --, the dispersion\nis parametrically as large as the respective expectation value. We identify\ninteresting scaling laws, which suggest that the multiplicity distribution\nshould exhibit KNO (Koba-Nielsen-Olesen) scaling. A similar scaling is known to\nhold for a jet branching in the vacuum, but the medium-induced distribution is\nfound to be considerably broader. We predict that event-by-event measurements\nof the di-jet asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC should observe large\nfluctuations in the number of soft hadrons propagating at large angles and also\nin the total energy carried by these hadrons.\n", "  Isolated long-range interacting particle systems appear generically to relax\nto non-equilibrium states (\"quasi-stationary states\" or QSS) which are\nstationary in the thermodynamic limit. A fundamental open question concerns the\n\"robustness\" of these states when the system is not isolated. In this paper we\nexplore, using both analytical and numerical approaches to a paradigmatic one\ndimensional model, the effect of a simple class of perturbations. We call them\n\"internal local perturbations\" in that the particle energies are perturbed at\ncollisions in a way which depends only on the local properties. Our central\nfinding is that the effect of the perturbations is to drive all the very\ndifferent QSS we consider towards a unique QSS. The latter is thus independent\nof the initial conditions of the system, but determined instead by both the\nlong-range forces and the details of the perturbations applied. Thus in the\npresence of such a perturbation the long-range system evolves to a unique\nnon-equilibrium stationary state, completely different to its state in absence\nof the perturbation, and it remains in this state when the perturbation is\nremoved. We argue that this result may be generic for long-range interacting\nsystems subject to perturbations which are dependent on the local properties\n(e.g. spatial density or velocity distribution) of the system itself.\n", "  The hydrogen molecule can be used for determination of physical constants and\nfor improved tests of the hypothetical long range force between hadrons, which\nrequires a sufficiently accurate knowledge of the molecular levels. For this\nreason, we have undertaken a project of significant improvements in theoretical\npredictions of H$_2$ and perform the first step, which is the solution of the\nnonrelativistic Schr\\\"odinger equation to the unprecedented accuracy of\n$10^{-12}$. This will inspire, we hope, a parallel progress in the spectroscopy\nof the molecular hydrogen.\n", "  Enhancement of optical response with high-index dielectric nanoparticles is\nattributed to the excitation of their Mie-type magnetic and electric\nresonances. Here we study Raman scattering from crystalline silicon\nnanoparticles and reveal that magnetic dipole modes have much stronger effect\non the scattering than electric modes of the same order. We demonstrate\nexperimentally a 140-fold enhancement of Raman signal from individual silicon\nspherical nanoparticles at the magnetic dipole resonance. Our results confirm\nthe importance of the optically-induced magnetic response of subwavelength\ndielectric nanoparticles for enhancing light-matter interactions.\n", "  We consider photon-initiated events with large rapidity gaps in proton-proton\ncollisions, where one or both protons may break up. We formulate a modified\nphoton PDF that accounts for the specific experimental rapidity gap veto, and\ndemonstrate how the soft survival probability for these gaps may be implemented\nconsistently. Finally, we present some phenomenological results for the\ntwo-photon induced production of lepton and $W$ boson pairs.\n", "  Recently it was found that the density matrix for a certain orthosymplectic\nChern-Simons theory matches with that for the ABJM theory with the odd chiral\nprojection. We prove this fact for a general case with the inclusion of\nfractional branes. We also identify the first few diagonal Gopakumar-Vafa\ninvariants for the grand potential constructed from the chirally projected\ndensity matrix.\n", "  A cosmology of Poincare gauge theory is developed, where several properties\nof universe corresponding to the cosmological equations with the pseudoscalar\ntorsion function are investigated. The cosmological constant is found to be the\nintrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe and is derived from the\ntheory naturally rather than added artificially, i.e. the dark energy\noriginates from geometry and includes the cosmological constant but differs\nfrom it. The cosmological constant puzzle, the coincidence and fine tuning\nproblem are relieved naturally at the same time. By solving the cosmological\nequations, the analytic cosmological solution is obtained and can be compared\nwith the LCDM model. In addition, the expressions of density parameters of the\nmatter and the geometric dark energy are derived, and it is shown that the\nevolution of state equations for the geometric dark energy agrees with the\ncurrent observational data. At last, the full equations of linear cosmological\nperturbations and the solutions are obtained.\n", "  Diffusion at solid-liquid interfaces is crucial in many technological and\nbiophysical processes. Although its behavior seems deceivingly simple, recent\nstudies showing passive superdiffusive transport suggest diffusion on surfaces\nmay hide rich complexities. In particular, bulk-mediated diffusion occurs when\nmolecules are transiently released from the surface to perform\nthree-dimensional excursions into the liquid bulk. This phenomenon bears the\ndichotomy where a molecule always return to the surface but the mean jump\nlength is infinite. Such behavior is associated with a breakdown of the central\nlimit theorem and weak ergodicity breaking. Here, we use single-particle\ntracking to study the statistics of bulk-mediated diffusion on a supported\nlipid bilayer. We find that the time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) of\nindividual trajectories, the archetypal measure in diffusion processes, does\nnot converge to the ensemble MSD but it remains a random variable, even in the\nlong observation-time limit. The distribution of time averages is shown to\nagree with a L\\'{e}vy flight model. Our results also unravel intriguing\nanomalies in the statistics of displacements. The time averaged MSD is shown to\ndepend on experimental time and investigations of fractional moments show a\nscaling $\\langle |r(t)|^q\\rangle \\sim t^{q\\nu(q)}$ with non-linear exponents,\ni.e. $\\nu(q)\\neq\\textrm{const}$. This type of behavior is termed strong\nanomalous diffusion and is rare among experimental observations.\n", "  The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is contributing important\nresults and insights into archetypal many-body problems, including quantum\nphase transitions. Still, the question whether out-of-equilibrium quantities,\nsuch as fluctuations of work, exhibit critical scaling after a sudden quench in\na closed system has remained elusive. Here, we take a novel approach to the\nproblem by studying a quench across an impurity quantum critical point. By\nperforming density matrix renormalization group computations on the\ntwo-impurity Kondo model, we are able to establish that the irreversible work\nproduced in a quench exhibits finite-size scaling at quantum criticality. This\nscaling faithfully predicts the equilibrium critical exponents for the\ncrossover length and the order parameter of the model, and, moreover, implies a\nnew exponent for the rescaled irreversible work. By connecting the irreversible\nwork to the two-impurity spin correlation function, our findings can be tested\nexperimentally.\n", "  While it is clear that spiral galaxies can have different handedness,\ngalaxies with clockwise patterns are assumed to be symmetric in all of their\nother characteristics to galaxies with counterclockwise patterns. Here we use\ndata from SDSS DR7 to show that photometric data can distinguish between\nclockwise and counterclockwise galaxies. Pattern recognition algorithms trained\nand tested using the photometric data of a clean manually crafted dataset of\n13,440 spiral galaxies with z<0.25 can predict the handedness of a spiral\ngalaxy in ~64% of the cases, significantly higher than mere chance accuracy of\n50% (P<10^{-5}). Experiments with a different dataset of 10,281 automatically\nclassified galaxies showed similar results of $~65% classification accuracy,\nsuggesting that the observed asymmetry is consistent also in datasets annotated\nin a fully automatic process, and without human intervention. That shows that\nthe photometric data collected by SDSS is sensitive to the handedness of the\ngalaxy. Also, analysis of the number of galaxies classified as clockwise and\ncounterclockwise by crowdsourcing shows that manual classification between\nspiral and elliptical galaxies can be affected by the handedness of the galaxy,\nand therefore galaxy morphology analyzed by citizen science campaigns might be\nbiased by the galaxy handedness. Code and data used in the experiment are\npublicly available, and the experiment can be easily replicated.\n", "  Inspired by the recent progress in the field of scattering amplitudes, we\ndiscuss hypothetical particles which can be characterised as the double copies\nof fermions -- in the same way gravitons can be viewed as double copies of\ngauge bosons. As the gravitons, these hypothetical particles interact only\nthrough gravitational interactions. We present two equivalent methods for the\ncomputation of the relevant scattering amplitudes. The hypothetical particles\ncan be massive and non-relativistic.\n", "  We show how the Weyl quantum walk derived from principles in Ref. [1],\nenjoying a nonlinear Lorentz symmetry of dynamics, allows one to introduce Hopf\nalgebras for position and momentum of the emerging particle. We focus on two\nspecial models of Hopf algebras--the usual Poincar\\'e and the k-Poincar\\'e\nalgebras.\n", "  Detailed observations of the solar system planets reveal a wide variety of\nlocal atmospheric conditions. Astronomical observations have revealed a variety\nof extrasolar planets none of which resembles any of the solar system planets\nin full. Instead, the most massive amongst the extrasolar planets, the gas\ngiants, appear very similar to the class of (young) Brown Dwarfs which are\namongst the oldest objects in the universe. Despite of this diversity, solar\nsystem planets, extrasolar planets and Brown Dwarfs have broadly similar global\ntemperatures between 300K and 2500K. In consequence, clouds of different\nchemical species form in their atmospheres. While the details of these clouds\ndiffer, the fundamental physical processes are the same. Further to this, all\nthese objects were observed to produce radio and X-ray emission. While both\nkinds of radiation are well studied on Earth and to a lesser extent on the\nsolar system planets, the occurrence of emission that potentially originate\nfrom accelerated electrons on Brown Dwarfs, extrasolar planets and\nprotoplanetary disks is not well understood yet. This paper offers an\ninterdisciplinary view on electrification processes and their feedback on their\nhosting environment in meteorology, volcanology, planetology and research on\nextrasolar planets and planet formation.\n", "  The large deviation function has been known for a long time in the literature\nfor the displacement of the rightmost particle in a branching random walk\n(BRW), or in a branching Brownian motion (BBM). More recently a number of\ngeneralizations of the BBM and of the BRW have been considered where selection\nor coalescence mechanisms tend to limit the exponential growth of the number of\nparticles. Here we try to estimate the large deviation function of the position\nof the rightmost particle for several such generalizations: the $L$-BBM, the\n$N$-BBM, and the CBRW (coalescing branching random walk) which is closely\nrelated to the noisy FKPP equation. Our approach allows us to obtain only upper\nbounds on these large deviation functions. One noticeable feature of our\nresults is their non analytic dependence on the parameters (such as the\ncoalescence rate in the CBRW).\n", "  We investigate the implications of the existence of Killing spinors in a\nspacetime. In particular, we show that in vacuum and electrovacuum a Killing\nspinor, along with some assumptions on the associated Killing vector in an\nasymptotic region, guarantees that the spacetime is locally isometric to the\nKerr or Kerr-Newman solutions. We show that the characterisation of these\nspacetimes in terms of Killing spinors is an alternative expression of\ncharacterisation results of Mars (Kerr) and Wong (Kerr-Newman) involving\nrestrictions on the Weyl curvature and matter content.\n", "  We study the implications of galaxy formation on dark matter direct detection\nusing high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies\nsimulated within the EAGLE and APOSTLE projects. We identify Milky Way\nanalogues that satisfy observational constraints on the Milky Way rotation\ncurve and total stellar mass. We then extract the dark matter density and\nvelocity distribution in the Solar neighbourhood for this set of Milky Way\nanalogues, and use them to analyse the results of current direct detection\nexperiments. For most Milky Way analogues, the event rates in direct detection\nexperiments obtained from the best fit Maxwellian distribution (with peak speed\nof 223 - 289 km/s) are similar to those obtained directly from the simulations.\nAs a consequence, the allowed regions and exclusion limits set by direct\ndetection experiments in the dark matter mass and spin-independent cross\nsection plane shift by a few GeV compared to the Standard Halo Model, at low\ndark matter masses. For each dark matter mass, the halo-to-halo variation of\nthe local dark matter density results in an overall shift of the allowed\nregions and exclusion limits for the cross section. However, the compatibility\nof the possible hints for a dark matter signal from DAMA and CDMS-Si and null\nresults from LUX and SuperCDMS is not improved.\n", "  We consider string pair production in non homogeneous electric backgrounds.\nWe study several particular configurations which can be addressed with the\nEuclidean world-sheet instanton technique, the analogue of the world-line\ninstanton for particles. In the first case the string is suspended between two\nD-branes in flat space-time, in the second case the string lives in AdS and\nterminates on one D-brane (this realizes the holographic Schwinger effect). In\nsome regions of parameter space the result is well approximated by the known\nanalytical formulas, either the particle pair production in non-homogeneous\nbackground or the string pair production in homogeneous background. In other\ncases we see effects which are intrinsically stringy and related to the\nnon-homogeneity of the background. The pair production is enhanced already for\nparticles in time dependent electric field backgrounds. The string nature\nenhances this even further. For spacial varying electrical background fields\nthe string pair production is less suppressed than the rate of particle pair\nproduction. We discuss in some detail how the critical field is affected by the\nnon-homogeneity, for both time and space dependent electric field backgrouds.\nWe also comment on what could be an interesting new prediction for the small\nfield limit. The third case we consider is pair production in holographic\nconfining backgrounds with homogeneous and non-homogeneous fields.\n", "  We examine the rotational states of a pair of polar $^2\\Sigma$ molecules\nsubject to a uniform magnetic field. The electric dipole-dipole interaction\nbetween the molecules creates entangled pair-eigenstates of two types. In one\ntype, the Zeeman interaction between the inherently paramagnetic molecules and\nthe magnetic field destroys the entanglement of the pair-eigenstates, whereas\nin the other type it does not. The pair-eigenstates exhibit numerous\nintersections, which become avoided for pair-eigenstates comprised of\nindividual states that meet the selection rules $\\Delta J_{i}=0,\\pm 1$, $\\Delta\nN_{i}=0,\\pm 2$, and $\\Delta M_{i}=0,\\pm 1$ imposed by the electric\ndipole-dipole operator. Here $J_{i}$, $N_{i}$ and $M_{i}$ are the total,\nrotational and projection angular momentum quantum numbers of molecules $i=1,2$\nin the absence of the electric dipole-dipole interaction. We evaluate the\nmutual alignment of the pair-eigenstates and find it to be independent of the\nmagnetic field, except for states that undergo avoided crossings, in which case\nthe alignment of the interacting states is interchanged at the magnetic field\ncorresponding to the crossing point. We present an analytic model which\nprovides ready estimates of the pairwise alignment cosine that characterises\nthe mutual alignment of the coupled rotors.\n", "  In this paper we simultaneously explain the excesses of the 750 GeV diphoton,\nmuon g-2 and $h\\to \\mu\\tau$ in an extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model\n(2HDM) with additional vector-like fermions and a CP-odd scalar singlet ($P$)\nwhich is identified as the 750 GeV resonance. This 750 GeV resonance has a\nmixing with the CP-odd scalar ($A$) in 2HDM, which leads to a coupling between\n$P$ and the SM particles as well as a coupling between $A$ and the vector-like\nfermions. Such a mixing and couplings are strongly constrained by\n$\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$, muon g-2 and the 750 GeV diphoton data. We scan over the\nparameter space and find that such an extension can simultaneously account for\nthe observed excesses of 750 GeV diphoton, muon g-2 and $h\\to \\mu\\tau$. The 750\nGeV resonance decays in exotic modes, such as $P\\to hA$, $P\\to HZ$, $P\\to HA$\nand $P\\to W^\\pm H^\\mp$, and its width can be dozens of GeV and is sensitive to\nthe mixing angle.\n", "  In this paper we study the properties of media with chiral imbalance\nparameterized by chiral chemical potential. It is shown that depending on the\nstrength of interaction between constituents in the media the chiral chemical\npotential either creates or enhances dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Thus\nthe chiral chemical potential plays a role of the catalyst of dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking. Physically this effect results from the appearance of the\nFermi surface and additional fermion states on this surface which take part in\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking. An interesting conclusion which can be\ndrawn is that at sufficiently small temperature chiral plasma is unstable with\nrespect to condensation of Cooper pairs and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking\neven for vanishingly small interactions between constituents.\n", "  The electron-neutrino mass (or masses and mixing angles) may be directly\nmeasurable in weak electron-capture decays. The favoured experimental technique\nis \"calorimetric\". The optimal nuclide is $^{163}$Ho, and several experiments\n(ECHo, HOLMES and NuMECS) are currently studying its decay. The most relevant\nrange of the calorimetric-energy spectrum extends for the last few hundred eV\nbelow its endpoint. It has not yet been well measured. We explore the theory,\nmainly in the cited range, of electron capture in $^{163}$Ho decay. A so far\nneglected process turns out to be most relevant: electron-capture accompanied\nby the shake-off of a second electron. Our two main conclusions are very\nencouraging: the counting rate close to the endpoint may be more than an order\nof magnitude larger than previously expected; the \"pile-up\" problem may be\nsignificantly reduced.\n", "  We prove the Liouville and superintegrability of a generalized Lotka-Volterra\nsystem and its Kahan discretization.\n", "  The dissolution process of small (initial (equivalent) radius $R_0 < 1$ mm)\nlong-chain alcohol (of various types) sessile droplets in water is studied,\ndisentangling diffusive and convective contributions. The latter can arise for\nhigh solubilities of the alcohol, as the density of the alcohol-water mixture\nis then considerably less as that of pure water, giving rise to buoyancy driven\nconvection. The convective flow around the droplets is measured, using\nmicro-particle image velocimetry ($\\mu$PIV) and the schlieren technique. When\nnondimensionalizing the system, we find a universal $Sh\\sim Ra^{1/4}$ scaling\nrelation for all alcohols (of different solubilities) and all droplets in the\nconvective regime. Here Sh is the Sherwood number (dimensionless mass flux) and\nRa the Rayleigh number (dimensionless density difference between clean and\nalcohol-saturated water). This scaling implies the scaling relation $\\tau_c\n\\sim R^{5/4}$ of the convective dissolution time $\\tau_c$, which is found to\nagree with experimental data. We show that in the convective regime the plume\nReynolds number (the dimensionless velocity) of the detaching alcohol-saturated\nplume follows $Re_p \\sim Sc^{-1} Ra^{5/8}$, which is confirmed by the $\\mu$PIV\ndata. Here, Sc is the Schmidt number. The convective regime exists when $Ra >\nRa_t$, where $Ra_t = 12$ is the transition Ra-number as extracted from the\ndata. For $Ra < Ra_t$ and smaller, convective transport is progressively\novertaken by diffusion and the above scaling relations break down.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of differential distributions for Tevatron\ntop-pair events at the level of stable top quarks. All calculations are\nperformed in NNLO QCD with the help of a fully differential partonic\nMonte-Carlo and are exact at this order in perturbation theory. We present\npredictions for all kinematic distributions for which data exists. Particular\nattention is paid on the top-quark forward-backward asymmetry which we study in\ndetail. We compare the NNLO results with existing approximate NNLO predictions\nas well as differential distributions computed with different parton\ndistribution sets. Theory errors are significantly smaller than current\nexperimental ones with overall agreement between theory and data.\n", "  We investigate the properties of multidimensional parity-time symmetric\nperiodic systems whose non-Hermitian periodicity is an integer multiple of the\nunderlying Hermitian system's periodicity. This creates a natural set of\ndegeneracies which can undergo thresholdless $\\mathcal{PT}$ transitions. We\nderive a $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}$ perturbation theory suited to the\ncontinuous eigenvalues of such systems in terms of the modes of the underlying\nHermitian system. In photonic crystals, such thresholdless $\\mathcal{PT}$\ntransitions are shown to yield significant control over the band structure of\nthe system, and can result in all-angle supercollimation, a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-superprism effect, and unidirectional behavior.\n", "  Unquenching of the Polyakov-loop potential showed to be an important\nimprovement for the description of the phase structure and thermodynamics of\nstrongly-interacting matter at zero quark chemical potentials with\nPolyakov-loop extended chiral models. This work constitutes the first\napplication of the quark backreaction on the Polyakov-loop potential at nonzero\ndensity. The observation is that it links the chiral and deconfinement phase\ntransition also at small temperatures and large quark chemical potentials. The\nbuild up of the surface tension in the Polyakov-loop extended Quark-Meson model\nis explored by investigating the two and 2+1-flavour Quark-Meson model and\nanalysing the impact of the Polyakov-loop extension. In general, the order of\nmagnitude of the surface tension is given by the chiral phase transition. The\ncoupling of the chiral and deconfinement transition with the unquenched\nPolyakov-loop potential leads to the fact that the Polyakov-loop contributes at\nall temperatures.\n", "  The dynamical interplay between electron-electron interactions and\nelectron-phonon coupling is investigated within the Anderson-Holstein model, a\nminimal model for open quantum systems that embody these effects. The influence\nof phonons on spectral and transport properties is explored in equilibrium, for\nnon-equilibrium steady state and for transient dynamics after a quench. Both\nthe particle-hole symmetric and the more generic particle-hole asymmetric cases\nare studied. The treatment is based on two complementary non-crossing\napproximations, the first of which is constructed around the weak-coupling\nlimit and the second around the polaron limit. In general, the two methods\ndisagree in nontrivial ways, indicating that more reliable approaches to the\nproblem are needed. The frameworks used here can form the starting point for\nnumerically exact methods based on bold-line continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithms capable of treating open systems simultaneously coupled to\nmultiple fermionic and bosonic baths.\n", "  Lidov-Kozai oscillations of planets in stellar binaries, combined with tidal\ndissipation, can lead to the formation of hot Jupiters (HJs) or tidal\ndisruption of planets. Recent population synthesis studies have found that the\nfraction of systems resulting in HJs (F_HJ) depends strongly on the planet\nmass, host stellar type and tidal dissipation strength, while the total\nmigration fraction F_mig = F_ HJ + F_dis (including both HJ formation and tidal\ndisruption) exhibits much weaker dependence. We present an analytical method\nfor calculating F_HJ and F_mig in the Lidov-Kozai migration scenario. The key\ningredient of our method is to determine the critical initial planet-binary\ninclination angle that drives the planet to reach sufficiently large\neccentricity for efficient tidal dissipation or disruption. This calculation\nincludes the effects of the octupole potential and short-range forces on the\nplanet. Our analytical method reproduces the resulting planet\nmigration/disruption fractions from population synthesis, and can be easily\nimplemented for various planet, stellar/companion types, and for different\ndistributions of initial planetary semi-major axes, binary separations and\neccentricities. We extend our calculations to planets in the super-Earth mass\nrange and discuss the conditions for such planets to survive Lidov-Kozai\nmigration and form close-in rocky planets.\n", "  We explore the effects of rotation on convective carbon, oxygen, and silicon\nshell burning during the late stages of evolution in a 20Msun star. Using the\nModules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we construct 1D stellar\nmodels both with no rotation and with an initial rigid rotation of 50% of\ncritical. At different points during the evolution, we map the 1D models into\n2D and follow the multidimensional evolution using the FLASH compressible\nhydrodynamics code for many convective turnover times until a quasi-steady\nstate is reached. We characterize the strength and scale of convective motions\nvia decomposition of the momentum density into vector spherical harmonics. We\nfind that rotation influences the total power in solenoidal modes, with a\nslightly larger impact for carbon and oxygen shell burning than for silicon\nshell burning. Including rotation in one-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution\nmodels alters the structure of the star in a manner that has a significant\nimpact on the character of multidimensional convection. Adding modest amounts\nof rotation to a stellar model that ignores rotation during the evolutionary\nstage, however, has little impact on the character of resulting convection.\nSince the spatial scale and strength of convection present at the point of core\ncollapse directly influence the supernova mechanism, our results suggest that\nrotation could play an important role in setting the stage for massive stellar\nexplosions.\n", "  Black hole X-ray binaries display large outbursts, during which their\nproperties are strongly variable. We develop a systematic spectral analysis of\nthe 3-40 keV RXTE/PCA data in order to study the evolution of these systems and\napply it to GX 339-4. Using the low count rate observations, we provide a\nprecise model of the Galactic background at GX 339-4's location and discuss its\npossible impact on the source spectral parameters. At higher fluxes, the use of\na Gaussian line to model the reflection component can lead to the detection of\na high-temperature disk, in particular in the high-hard state. We demonstrate\nthat this component is an artifact arising from an incomplete modeling of the\nreflection spectrum.\n", "  We report on the application of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to enhance\nperformance of an ultra-cold quantum gas experiment. The production of a\n$^{87}$Rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can be divided into fundamental\ncooling steps, specifically magneto optical trapping of cold atoms, loading of\natoms to a far detuned crossed dipole trap and finally the process of\nevaporative cooling. The EA is applied separately for each of these steps with\na particular definition for the feedback the so-called fitness. We discuss the\nprinciples of an EA and implement an enhancement called differential evolution.\nAnalyzing the reasons for the EA to improve \\eg, the atomic loading rates and\nincrease the BEC phase-space density, yields an optimal parameter set for the\nBEC production and enables us to reduce the BEC production time significantly.\nFurthermore, we focus on how additional information about the experiment and\noptimization possibilities can be extracted and how the correlations revealed\nallow for further improvement. Our results illustrate that EAs are powerful\noptimization tools for complex experiments and exemplify that the application\nyields useful information on the dependence of these experiments on the\noptimized parameters.\n", "  Superdense coding promises increased classical capacity and communication\nsecurity but this advantage may be undermined by noise in the quantum channel.\nWe present a numerical study of how forward error correction (FEC) applied to\nthe encoded classical message can be used to mitigate against quantum channel\nnoise. By studying the bit error rate under different FEC codes, we identify\nthe unique role that burst errors play in superdense coding, and we show how\nthese can be mitigated against by interleaving the FEC codewords prior to\ntransmission. We conclude that classical FEC with interleaving is a useful\nmethod to improve the performance in near-term demonstrations of superdense\ncoding.\n", "  In this work we give a comprehensive analysis on the phenomenology of a\nspecific $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ dark matter (DM) model in which neutrino mass is\ninduced at two loops by interactions with a DM particle that can be a complex\nscalar or a Dirac fermion. Both the DM properties in relic density and direct\ndetection and the LHC signatures are examined in great detail, and indirect\ndetection for gamma-ray excess from the Galactic Center is also discussed\nbriefly. On the DM side, both semi-annihilation and co-annihilation processes\nplay a crucial role in alleviating the tension of parameter space between relic\ndensity and direct detection. On the collider side, new decay channels\nresulting from $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ particles lead to distinct signals at LHC.\nCurrently the trilepton signal is expected to give the most stringent bound for\nboth scalar and fermion DM candidates, and the signatures of fermion DM are\nvery similar to those of electroweakinos in simplified supersymmetric models.\n", "  We study various rotating and oscillating D-string configurations in some\ngeneral backgrounds with fluxes. In particular, we look for solutions to the\nequations of motion of various rigidly rotating D-strings in $AdS_3$ background\nwith mixed flux, and in the intersecting D-brane geometries. We find out\nrelations among various conserved charges corresponding to the breathing and\nrotating D-string configurations.\n", "  We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the type D group $D^{(1)}_{9n,\n3n}$ as flavor symmetry and the generalized CP symmetry. All possible residual\nsymmetries and their consequences for the prediction of the mixing parameters\nare studied. We find that only one type of mixing pattern is able to\naccommodate the measured values of the mixing angles in both \"direct\" and\n\"variant of semidirect\" approaches, and four types of mixing patterns are\nphenomenologically viable in the \"semidirect\" approach. The admissible values\nof the mixing angles as well as CP violating phases are studied in detail for\neach case. It is remarkable that the first two smallest $D^{(1)}_{9n,3n}$\ngroups with $n=1, 2$ can fits the experimental data very well. The\nphenomenological predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay are discussed.\n", "  The relation between unusual Mexican-hat band dispersion, ferromagnetism and\nferroelasticity is investigated using a combination of analytical,\nfirst-principles and phenomenological methods. The class of material with\nMexican-hat band edge is studied using the $\\alpha$-SnO monolayer as a\nprototype. Such band edge causes a van Hove singularity diverging with\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E}}$, and in p-type material leads to spatial and/or\ntime-reversal spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that an unexpected\nmultiferroic phase is obtained in a range of hole density for which the\nmaterial presents ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity simultaneously.\n", "  We study the Coulomb excitation of pygmy dipole resonances (PDR) in heavy ion\nreactions at 100 MeV/nucleon and above. The reactions 68Ni+197Au and 68Ni+208Pb\nare taken as a practical examples. Our goal is to address the question of the\ninfluence of giant resonances on the PDR as the dynamics of the collision\nevolves. We show that the coupling to the giant resonances affects considerably\nthe excitation probabilities of the PDR, a result that indicates the need of an\nimproved theoretical treatment of the reaction dynamics at these bombarding\nenergies.\n", "  Several total and partial photoionization cross section calculations, based\non both theoretical and empirical approaches, are quantitatively evaluated with\nstatistical analyses using a large collection of experimental data retrieved\nfrom the literature to identify the state of the art for modeling the\nphotoelectric effect in Monte Carlo particle transport. Some of the examined\ncross section models are available in general purpose Monte Carlo systems,\nwhile others have been implemented and subjected to validation tests for the\nfirst time to estimate whether they could improve the accuracy of particle\ntransport codes. The validation process identifies Scofield's 1973\nnon-relativistic calculations, tabulated in the Evaluated Photon Data\nLibrary(EPDL), as the one best reproducing experimental measurements of total\ncross sections. Specialized total cross section models, some of which derive\nfrom more recent calculations, do not provide significant improvements.\nScofield's non-relativistic calculations are not surpassed regarding the\ncompatibility with experiment of K and L shell photoionization cross sections\neither, although in a few test cases Ebel's parameterization produces more\naccurate results close to absorption edges. Modifications to Biggs and\nLighthill's parameterization implemented in Geant4 significantly reduce the\naccuracy of total cross sections at low energies with respect to its original\nformulation. The scarcity of suitable experimental data hinders a similar\nextensive analysis for the simulation of the photoelectron angular\ndistribution, which is limited to a qualitative appraisal.\n", "  Lie symmetries are discussed for the Wheeler-De Witt equation in Bianchi\nClass A cosmologies. In particular, we consider General Relativity, minimally\ncoupled scalar field gravity and Hybrid Gravity as paradigmatic examples of the\napproach. Several invariant solutions are determined and classified according\nto the form of the scalar field potential. The approach gives rise to a\nsuitable method to select classical solutions and it is based on the first\nprinciple of the existence of symmetries.\n", "  We present a three-dimensional molecular density functional theory (MDFT) of\nwater derived from first-principles that relies on the particle's density and\nmultipolar polarization density and includes the density-polarization coupling.\nThis brings two main benefits: ($i$) a scalar density and a vectorial\nmultipolar polarization density fields are much more tractable and give more\nphysical insight than the full position and orientation densities, and ($ii$)\nit includes the full density-polarization coupling of water, that is known to\nbe non-vanishing but has never been taken into account. Furthermore, the theory\nrequires only the partial charge distribution of a water molecule and three\nmeasurable bulk properties, namely the structure factor and the Fourier\ncomponents of the longitudinal and transverse dielectric susceptibilities.\n", "  Within the point vortex model, we compute the probability distribution\nfunction of the velocity fluctuations induced by same-signed vortices scattered\nwithin a disk according to a fractal distribution of distances to origin $\\sim\nr^{-\\alpha}$. We show that the different random configurations of vortices\ninduce velocity fluctuations that are broadly distributed, and follow a\npower-law tail distribution, $P(V)\\sim V^{\\alpha-2}$ with a scaling exponent\ndetermined by the $\\alpha$ exponent of the spatial distribution. We also show\nthat the range of the power-law scaling regime in the velocity distribution is\nset by the mean density of vortices and the exponent $\\alpha$ of the vortex\ndensity distribution.\n", "  Background: Multinucleon transfer (MNT) and quasifission (QF) processes are\ndominant processes in low-energy collisions of two heavy nuclei. They are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics\nleading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as\ndeformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nMNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed\ncomparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations\nand measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number\nprojection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave\nfunction after collision. Results: Fragment masses, total kinetic energy (TKE),\nscattering angle, contact time, and MNT cross sections are investigated for the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. They show reasonable agreements with\nmeasurements. At small impact parameters, collision dynamics depends\nsensitively on the orientation of deformed $^{238}$U. In tip (side) collisions,\nwe find a larger (smaller) TKE and a shorter (longer) contact time. In tip\ncollisions, we find a strong influence of quantum shells around $^{208}$Pb.\nConclusions: It is confirmed that the TDHF calculations reasonably describe\nboth MNT and QF processes in the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Analyses of this\nsystem indicates the significance of the nuclear structure effects such as\ndeformation and quantum shells in nuclear reaction dynamics at low energies.\n", "  If dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), dark\nmatter subhalos in the Milky Way could be detectable as gamma-ray point sources\ndue to WIMP annihilation. In this work, we perform an updated study of the\ndetectability of dark matter subhalos as gamma-ray sources with the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (Fermi LAT). We use the results of the Via Lactea II simulation,\nscaled to the Planck 2015 cosmological parameters, to predict the local dark\nmatter subhalo distribution. Under optimistic assumptions for the WIMP\nparameters --- a 40 GeV particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ with a thermal\ncross-section, as required to explain the Galactic center GeV excess --- we\npredict that at most $\\sim 10$ subhalos might be present in the third Fermi LAT\nsource catalog (3FGL). This is a smaller number than has been predicted by\nprior studies, and we discuss the origin of this difference. We also compare\nour predictions for the detectability of subhalos with the number of subhalo\ncandidate sources in 3FGL, and derive upper limits on the WIMP annihilation\ncross-section as a function of the particle mass. If a dark matter\ninterpretation could be excluded for all 3FGL sources, our constraints would be\ncompetitive with those found by indirect searches using other targets, such as\nknown Milky Way satellite galaxies.\n", "  M105 is a standard elliptical galaxy, located in the Leo I Group. We present\nphotometry of the resolved stars in its inner region at R ~ 4' ~ 4Reff,\nobtained from F606W and F814W images in the Hubble Space Telescope archive. We\ncombine this with photometry of the outer region at R ~ 12' ~ 12Reff from\narchival imaging data. Color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stars in the\ninner region show a prominent red giant branch (RGB) with a large color range,\nwhile those of the outer region show better a narrow blue RGB. The metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) of the RGB stars shows the existence of two\ndistinct subpopulations: a dominant metal-rich population (with a peak at [M/H]\n~ 0.0) and a much weaker metal-poor population (with a peak at [M/H] ~ -1.1).\nThe radial number density profiles of the metal-rich and metal-poor RGB stars\nare fit well by a Sersic law with n=2.75+-0.10 and n=6.89+-0.94, and by a\nsingle power law, respectively. The MDFs of the inner and outer regions can be\ndescribed well by accretion gas models of chemical evolution with two\ncomponents. These provide strong evidence that there are two distinct stellar\nhalos in this galaxy, metal-poor and red metal-rich halos, consistent with the\nresults based on globular cluster systems in bright early-type galaxies (Park &\nLee 2013). We discuss the implications of these results with regard to the\nformation of massive early-type galaxies in the dual halo mode formation\nscenario.\n", "  To search for an S= -1 di-baryonic state which decays to $\\Lambda p$, the $\n{\\rm{}^3He}(K^-,\\Lambda p)n_{missing}$ reaction was studied at 1.0 GeV/$c$.\nUnobserved neutrons were kinematically identified from the missing mass $M_X$\nof the $ {\\rm{}^3He}(K^-,\\Lambda p)X$ reaction in order to have a large\nacceptance for the $\\Lambda pn$ final state. The observed $\\Lambda p n$ events,\ndistributed widely over the kinematically allowed region of the Dalitz plot,\nestablish that the major component comes from a three nucleon absorption\nprocess. A concentration of events at a specific neutron kinetic energy was\nobserved in a region of low momentum transfer to the $\\Lambda p$. To account\nfor the observed peak structure, the simplest S-wave pole was assumed to exist\nin the reaction channel, having Breit-Wigner form in energy and with a Gaussian\nform-factor. A minimum $\\chi^2$ method was applied to deduce its mass $M_X\\ =$\n2355 $ ^{+ 6}_{ - 8}$ (stat.) $ \\pm 12$ (syst.) MeV/c$^2$, and decay-width\n$\\Gamma_X\\ = $ 110 $ ^{+ 19}_{ - 17}$ (stat.) $ \\pm 27$ (syst.) MeV/c$^2$,\nrespectively. The form factor parameter $Q_X \\sim$ 400 MeV/$c$ implies that the\nrange of interaction is about 0.5\n", "  The amplitude A(s,t) for ultra-high energy scattering can be found in the\nleading eikonal approximation by considering propagation in an Aichelburg-Sexl\ngravitational shockwave background. Loop corrections in the QFT describing the\nscattered particles are encoded for energies below the Planck scale in an\neffective action which in general exhibits causality violation and Shapiro time\nadvances. In this paper, we use Penrose limit techniques to calculate the full\nenergy dependence of the scattering phase shift Theta_scat(hat_s},, where the\nsingle variable hat_s = Gs/m^2 b^(d-2) contains both the CM energy s and impact\nparameter b, for a range of scalar QFTs in d dimensions with different\nrenormalizability properties. We evaluate the high-energy limit of\nTheta_scat(hat_s) and show in detail how causality is related to the existence\nof a well-defined UV completion. Similarities with graviton scattering and the\ncorresponding resolution of causality violation in the effective action by\nstring theory are briefly discussed.\n", "  We present state of the art resummation predictions for differential cross\nsections in top-quark pair production at the LHC. They are derived from a\nformalism which allows the simultaneous resummation of both soft and small-mass\nlogarithms, which endanger the convergence of fixed-order perturbative series\nin the boosted regime, where the partonic center-of-mass energy is much larger\nthan the mass to the top quark. We combine such a double resummation at NNLL$'$\naccuracy with standard soft-gluon resummation at NNLL accuracy and with NLO\ncalculations, so that our results are applicable throughout the whole phase\nspace. We find that the resummation effects on the differential distributions\nare significant, bringing theoretical predictions into better agreement with\nexperimental data compared to fixed-order calculations. Moreover, such effects\nare not well described by the NNLO approximation of the resummation formula,\nespecially in the high-energy tails of the distributions, highlighting the\nimportance of all-orders resummation in dedicated studies of boosted top\nproduction.\n", "  We combine the unimodular gravity and mimetic gravity theories into a unified\ntheoretical framework, which is proposed to provide a suggestive proposal for a\nframework that may assist in the discussion and solution search of the\ncosmological constant problem and of the dark matter issue. After providing the\nformulation of the unimodular mimetic gravity and investigating all the new\nfeatures that the vacuum unimodular gravity implies, by using the underlying\nreconstruction method, we realize some well known cosmological evolutions, with\nsome of these being exotic for the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert gravity.\nSpecifically we provide the vacuum unimodular mimetic gravity description of\nthe de Sitter cosmology and of the perfect fluid with constant equation of\nstate cosmology. As we demonstrate, these cosmologies can be realized by vacuum\nmimetic unimodular gravity, without the existence of any matter fluid source.\nMoreover, we investigate how cosmologically viable cosmologies, which are\ncompatible with the recent observational data, can be realized by the vacuum\nunimodular mimetic gravity. Since in some cases, the graceful exit from\ninflation problem might exist, we provide a qualitative description of the\nmechanism that can potentially generate the graceful exit from inflation in\nthese theories, by searching for the unstable de Sitter solutions in the\ncontext of unimodular mimetic theories of gravity.\n", "  Stellar rotation periods measured in open clusters have proved to be\nextremely useful for studying stars' angular momentum content and rotationally\ndriven magnetic activity, which are both age- and mass-dependent processes.\nWhile period measurements have been obtained for hundreds of solar-mass members\nof the Pleiades, period measurements exist for only a few low-mass ($<$0.5\nM$_{\\odot}$) members of this key laboratory for stellar evolution theory. To\nfill this gap, we report rotation periods for 132 low-mass Pleiades members\n(including nearly 100 with M $\\leq$ 0.45 M$_{\\odot}$), measured from\nphotometric monitoring of the cluster conducted by the Palomar Transient\nFactory in late 2011 and early 2012. These periods extend the portrait of\nstellar rotation at 125 Myr to the lowest-mass stars and re-establish the\nPleiades as a key benchmark for models of the transport and evolution of\nstellar angular momentum. Combining our new rotation periods with precise\nBVIJHK photometry reported by Stauffer et al. and Kamai et al., we investigate\nknown anomalies in the photometric properties of K and M Pleiades members. We\nconfirm the correlation detected by Kamai et al. between a star's rotation\nperiod and position relative to the main sequence in the cluster's\ncolor-magnitude diagram. We find that rapid rotators have redder (V-K) colors\nthan slower rotators at the same V, indicating that rapid and slow rotators\nhave different binary frequencies and/or photospheric properties. We find no\ndifference in the photometric amplitudes of rapid and slow rotators, indicating\nthat asymmetries in the longitudinal distribution of starspots do not scale\ngrossly with rotation rate.\n", "  The transition magnetic moment of a sterile-to-active neutrino conversion\ngives rise to not only radiative decay of a sterile neutrino, but also its\nnon-standard interaction (NSI) with matter. For sterile neutrinos of keV-mass\nas dark matter candidates, their decay signals are actively searched for in\ncosmic X-ray spectra. In this work, we consider the NSI that leads to atomic\nionization, which can be detected by direct dark matter experiments. It is\nfound that this inelastic scattering process for a nonrelativistic sterile\nneutrino has a pronounced enhancement in the differential cross section at\nenergy transfer about half of its mass, manifesting experimentally as peaks in\nthe measurable energy spectra. The enhancement effects gradually smear out as\nthe sterile neutrino becomes relativistic. Using data taken with germanium\ndetectors that have fine energy resolution in keV and sub-keV regimes,\nconstraints on sterile neutrino mass and its transition magnetic moment are\nderived and compared with those from astrophysical observations.\n", "  The properties of solar flare plasma can be determined from the observation\nof optically thin lines. The emitting ion distribution determines the shape of\nthe line, with an isothermal Maxwellian ion distribution producing a Gaussian\nprofile. Non-Gaussian lines may indicate more complex ion distributions. We\ninvestigate the possibility of determining flare-accelerated non-thermal ion or\nplasma velocity distributions. We study EUV spectral lines during a flare\nSOL2013-05-15T01:45 using the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). The flare\nis located close to the eastern solar limb with an extended loop structure,\nallowing the different flare features: ribbons, hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints and\nthe loop-top source to be clearly observed in UV, EUV and X-rays. EUV line\nspectroscopy is performed in seven different regions. We study the line\nprofiles of isolated and unblended Fe XVI lines (262.976 A) formed at\ntemperatures of 2-4 MK. Fe XVI line profiles at one time close to the peak soft\nX-ray emission and free of directed mass motions are examined using: 1. a\nhigher moments analysis, 2. Gaussian fitting, and 3. by fitting a kappa\ndistribution profile convolved with a Gaussian to account for the EIS\ninstrumental profile. Fe XVI line profiles in the loop-top, HXR footpoint and\nribbon regions can be confidently fitted with a kappa line profile, giving low,\nnon-thermal kappa values between 2-3.3. A higher moments analysis also finds\nthat many of the line kurtosis values are higher than the Gaussian value of 3,\neven with the presence of a broad Gaussian instrumental profile. A\nflare-accelerated non-thermal ion population could account for both the\nobserved non-Gaussian line profiles, and for the Fe XVI excess broadening found\nfrom Gaussian fitting, if the emitting ions are interacting with a thermalised\n4 MK electron population, and the instrumental profile is well-approximated by\na Gaussian.\n", "  Chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds are of environmental concerns, since they\nare toxic to humans and other mammals, are widespread, and exposure is hard to\navoid. Understanding and improving methods to reduce the amount of the\nsubstances is important. We present an atomic-scale calculational study of the\nadsorption of chlorine-based substance chloroform (CHCl3) on graphene oxide, as\na step in estimating the capacity of graphene oxide for filtering out such\nsubstances, e.g., from drinking water. The calculations are based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT), and the recently developed consistent-exchange\nfunctional for the van der Waals density-functional method (vdW-DF-cx) is\nemployed. We obtain values of the chloroform adsorption energy varying from\nroughly 0.2 to 0.4 eV per molecule. This is comparable to previously found\nresults for chloroform adsorbed directly on clean graphene, using similar\ncalculations. In a wet environment, like filters for drinking water, the\ngraphene will not stay clean and will likely oxidize, and thus adsorption onto\ngraphene oxide, rather than clean graphene, is a more relevant process to\nstudy.\n", "  Resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are considered an attractive dark\nmatter (DM) candidate only requiring a minimal, well motivated extension to the\nstandard model of particle physics. With a particle mass restricted to the keV\nrange, sterile neutrinos are furthermore a prime candidate for warm DM,\ncharacterised by suppressed matter perturbations at the smallest observable\nscales. In this paper we take a critical look at the validity of the resonant\nscenario in the context of constraints from structure formation. We compare\npredicted and observed number of Milky-Way satellites and we introduce a new\nmethod to generalise existing Lyman-$\\alpha$ limits based on thermal relic warm\nDM to the case of resonant sterile neutrino DM. The tightest limits come from\nthe Lyman-$\\alpha$ analysis, excluding the entire parameter space (at\n2-$\\sigma$ confidence level) still allowed by X-ray observations. Constraints\nfrom Milky-Way satellite counts are less stringent, leaving room for resonant\nsterile neutrino DM most notably around the suggested line signal at 7.1 keV.\n", "  We consider a twin WIMP scenario whose twin sector contains a full dark copy\nof the SM hadrons, where the lightest twin particles are twin pions. By analogy\nto the standard WIMP paradigm, the dark matter (DM) freezes out through twin\nelectroweak interactions, and annihilates into a dark shower of light twin\nhadrons. These are either stable or decay predominantly to standard model (SM)\nphotons. We show that this 'hadrosymmetric' scenario can be consistent with all\napplicable astrophysical, cosmological and collider constraints. In order to\ndecay the twin hadrons before the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch, an additional\nportal between the SM and twin sector is required. In most cases we find this\nadditional mediator is within reach of either the LHC or future intensity\nfrontier experiments. Furthermore, we conduct simulations of the dark shower\nand consequent photon spectra. We find that fits of these spectra to the\nclaimed galactic center gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi-LAT non-trivially\ncoincide with regions of parameter space that both successfully generate the\nobserved DM abundance and exhibit minimal fine-tuning.\n", "  The simplest inflationary models predict a primordial power spectrum (PPS) of\nthe curvature fluctuations that can be described by a power-law function that\nis nearly scale-invariant. It has been shown, however, that the low-multipole\nspectrum of the CMB anisotropies may hint the presence of some features in the\nshape of the scalar PPS, which could deviate from its canonical power-law form.\nWe study the possible degeneracies of this non-standard PPS with the neutrino\nanisotropies, the neutrino masses, the effective number of relativistic species\nand a sterile neutrino or a thermal axion mass. The limits on these additional\nparameters are less constraining in a model with a non-standard PPS when only\nincluding the temperature auto-correlation spectrum measurements in the data\nanalyses. The inclusion of the polarization spectra noticeably helps in\nreducing the degeneracies, leading to results that typically show no deviation\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM model with a standard power-law PPS.\n", "  A characteristic feature of long-range interacting systems is that they\nbecome trapped in a non-equilibrium and long-lived quasi-stationary state (QSS)\nduring the early stages of their development. We present a comprehensive review\nof recent studies of the core-halo structure of QSSs, in the Hamiltonian\nmean-field model, which is a mean-field model of mutually coupled ferromagnetic\nXY spins located at a point, obtained by starting from various unsteady\nrectangular water-bag type initial phase-space distributions. The main result\nexposed in this review is that the core-halo structure can be described by the\nsuperposition of two independent Lynden-Bell distributions. We discuss the\ncompleteness of collisionless relaxation of this double Lynden-Bell\ndistribution by using both of Lynden-Bell entropy and double Lynden-Bell\nentropy for the systems at low energies per particle.\n", "  An electric current in the presence of spin-orbit coupling can generate a\nspin accumulation that exerts torques on a nearby magnetization. We demonstrate\nthat, even in the absence of materials with strong bulk spin-orbit coupling, a\ntorque can arise solely due to interfacial spin-orbit coupling, namely\nRashba-Eldestein effects at metal/insulator interfaces. In magnetically soft\nNiFe sandwiched between a weak spin-orbit metal (Ti) and insulator\n(Al$_2$O$_3$), this torque appears as an effective field, which is\nsignificantly larger than the Oersted field and sensitive to insertion of an\nadditional layer between NiFe and Al$_2$O$_3$. Our findings point to new routes\nfor tuning spin-orbit torques by engineering interfacial electric dipoles.\n", "  We study the preheating of gauge fields in a simple axion monodromy model and\ncompute the induced entropy perturbations and their effect on the curvature\nfluctuations. We find that the correction to the spectrum of curvature\nperturbations has a blue spectrum with index $n_s = 5/2$. Hence, these induced\nmodes are harmless for the observed structure of the universe. Since the\nspectrum is blue, there is the danger of overproduction of primordial black\nholes. However, we show that the observational constraints are easily\nsatisfied.\n", "  We study the production of Mueller-Navelet jets at 13 TeV LHC, within\ncollinear factorization and including the BFKL resummation of energy logarithms\nin the next-to-leading approximation. We calculate several azimuthal\ncorrelations for different values of the rapidity separation $Y$ between the\ntwo jets and evaluate the effect of excluding those events where, for a given\n$Y$, one of the two jets is produced in the central region.\n", "  We present benchmark scenarios for searches for an additional Higgs state in\nthe real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model in Run 2 of the LHC. The\nscenarios are selected such that they fulfill all relevant current theoretical\nand experimental constraints, but can potentially be discovered at the current\nLHC run. We take into account the results presented in earlier work and update\nthe experimental constraints from relevant LHC Higgs searches and signal rate\nmeasurements. The benchmark scenarios are given separately for the low mass and\nhigh mass region, i.e. the mass range where the additional Higgs state is\nlighter or heavier than the discovered Higgs state at around 125 GeV. They have\nalso been presented in the framework of the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working\nGroup.\n", "  We investigate a new structure for machine learning classifiers applied to\nproblems in high-energy physics by expanding the inputs to include not only\nmeasured features but also physics parameters. The physics parameters represent\na smoothly varying learning task, and the resulting parameterized classifier\ncan smoothly interpolate between them and replace sets of classifiers trained\nat individual values. This simplifies the training process and gives improved\nperformance at intermediate values, even for complex problems requiring deep\nlearning. Applications include tools parameterized in terms of theoretical\nmodel parameters, such as the mass of a particle, which allow for a single\nnetwork to provide improved discrimination across a range of masses. This\nconcept is simple to implement and allows for optimized interpolatable results.\n", "  Metamaterials enable the emergence of novel physical properties due to the\nexistence of an underlying sub-wavelength structure. Here, we use the Faraday\ninstability to shape the fluid-air interface with a regular pattern. This\npattern undergoes an oscillating secondary instability and exhibits spontaneous\nvibrations that are analogous to transverse elastic waves. By locally forcing\nthese waves, we fully characterize their dispersion relation and show that a\nFaraday pattern presents an effective shear elasticity. We propose a physical\nmechanism combining surface tension with the Faraday structured interface that\nquantitatively predicts the elastic wave phase speed, revealing that the liquid\ninterface behaves as an elastic metamaterial.\n", "  Dense protein clusters are known to play an important role in nucleation of\nprotein crystals from dilute solutions. While these have generally been thought\nto be formed from a metastable phase, the observation of similar, if not\nidentical, clusters above the critical point for the\ndilute-solution/strong-solution phase transition has thrown this into doubt.\nFurthermore, the observed clusters are stable for relatively long times.\nBecause protein aggregation plays an important role in some pathologies,\nunderstanding the nature of such clusters is an important problem. One\nmechanism for the stabilization of such structures was proposed by Pan, Vekilov\nand Lubchenko and was investigated using a DDFT model which confirmed the\nviability of the model. Here, we revisit that model and incorporate additional\nphysics in the form of state-dependent reaction rates. We show by a combination\nof numerical results and general arguments that the state-dependent rates\ndisrupt the stability mechanism. Finally, we argue that the state-depedent\nreactions correct unphysical aspects of the model with ideal\n(state-independent) reactions and that this necessarily leads to the failure of\nthe proposed mechanism.\n", "  We consider eternal inflation in hilltop-type inflation models, favored by\ncurrent data, in which the scalar field in inflation rolls off of a local\nmaximum of the potential. Unlike chaotic or plateau-type inflation models, in\nhilltop inflation the region of field space which supports eternal inflation is\nfinite, and the expansion rate $H_{EI}$ during eternal inflation is almost\nexactly the same as the expansion rate $H_*$ during slow roll inflation.\nTherefore, in any given Hubble volume, there is a finite and calculable\nexpectation value for the lifetime of the \"eternal\" inflation phase, during\nwhich quantum flucutations dominate over classical field evolution. We show\nthat despite this, inflation in hilltop models is nonetheless eternal in the\nsense that the volume of the spacetime at any finite time is exponentially\ndominated by regions which continue to inflate. This is true regardless of the\nenergy scale of inflation, and eternal inflation is supported for inflation at\narbitrarily low energy scale.\n", "  We report the characterization of the misfit compound\n(Pb1-xSnxSe2)1.16(TiSe2)2, in which a [100] rocksalt bilayer of Pb1-xSnxSe,\nwhich is a topological crystalline insulator in bulk form, alternates with a\ndouble layer of the normally non-superconducting layered transition metal\ndichalcogenide TiSe2. The x dependence of Tc displays a weak dome-like shape\nwith a maximum Tc of 4.5 K at x = 0.2; there is only a subtle change in Tc\ncorresponding to the expected trivial to topological transition in the\nPb1-xSnxSe bi-layer. We present a more detailed characterization of the\nsuperconductor at x = 0.4, for which the bulk Pb1-xSnxSe phase is in the\ntopological crystalline insulator regime. For this material, the Sommerfeld\nparameter gamma =11.06 mJ mol-1 K-2, the Debye temperature delta D = 161 K, the\nnormalized specific heat jump value delta C/ gamma Tc = 1.38 and the\nelectron-phonon constant value lambda ep = 0.72, suggesting that\n(Pb0.6Sn0.4Se)1.16(TiSe2)2 is a BCS-type weak coupling superconductor. This\nmaterial is of interest for probing the interaction of superconductivity with\nthe surface states of a topological crystalline insulator.\n", "  We study the onset of friction for rough contacting blocks whose interface is\ncoated with a thin lubrication layer. High speed measurements of the real\ncontact area and stress fields near the interface reveal that propagating shear\ncracks mediate lubricated frictional motion. While lubricants reduce interface\nresistances, surprisingly, they significantly increase energy dissipated,\n$\\Gamma$, during rupture. Moreover, lubricant viscosity affects the onset of\nfriction but has no effect on $\\Gamma$. Fracture mechanics provide a new way to\nview the otherwise hidden complex dynamics of the lubrication layer.\n", "  We want to test if self-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection\nmodels can explain the observational results for accretion disk winds in BHBs.\nIn our models, the density at the base of the outflow, from the accretion disk,\nis not a free parameter, but is determined by solving the full set of dynamical\nMHD equations without neglecting any physical term. Different MHD solutions\nwere generated for different values of (a) the disk aspect ratio\n($\\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We generated two kinds\nof MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence (warm\nsolution) of heating at the disk surface. The cold MHD solutions are found to\nbe inadequate to account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. The\nwarm solutions can have sufficiently high values of $p (\\gtrsim 0.1)$ which is\nrequired to explain the observed physical quantities in the wind. The heating\n(required at the disk surface for the warm solutions) could be due to the\nillumination which would be more efficient in the Soft state. We found that in\nthe Hard state a range of ionisation parameter is thermodynamically unstable,\nwhich makes it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state. Our\nresults would suggest that a thermo-magnetic process is required to explain\nwinds in BHBs.\n", "  We discuss the limitations of the covariant derivative expansion prescription\nadvocated to compute the one-loop Standard Model (SM) effective lagrangian when\nthe heavy fields couple linearly to the SM. In particular, one-loop\ncontributions resulting from the exchange of both heavy and light fields must\nbe explicitly taken into account through matching because the proposed\nfunctional approach alone does not account for them. We review a simple case\nwith a heavy scalar singlet of charge $-1$ to illustrate the argument. As two\nother examples where this matching is needed and this functional method gives a\nvanishing result, up to renormalization of the heavy sector parameters, we\nre-evaluate the one-loop corrections to the T--parameter due to a heavy scalar\ntriplet with vanishing hypercharge coupling to the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson\nand to a heavy vector-like quark singlet of charged $2/3$ mixing with the top\nquark, respectively. In all cases we make use of a new code for matching\nfundamental and effective theories in models with arbitrary heavy field\nadditions.\n", "  The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) is expected to launch\nin early 2017 and will gather X-ray data on neutron stars and other high-energy\nsources from a berth on the International Space Station. Its prime scientific\ngoal is to measure the masses and radii of non-accreting neutron stars via fits\nto the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on\ntheir surfaces. These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical\nmodels of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR\nJ1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with\nNICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional\noscillation amplitude from PSR J1614$-$2230 could be high enough that this star\ncannot be very compact. We show that if we analyze 0.5 Ms of NICER data and 0.1\nMs of nearby off-source data and combine that analysis with the known mass of\nthis star, we would find a robust lower limit to the radius with a statistical\nuncertainty of only $\\sim 0.5-0.7$ km. We also show that even if there is an\nunmodeled nonthermal component modulated at the pulsation frequency, good\nstatistical fits could rule out significant biases. The low count rate will\nmake reliable upper limits on the radius difficult, but the lower limit could\nrule out some equations of state that are currently being discussed. This\nanalysis would require a good estimate of the non-source background, so Chandra\nobservations of the vicinity of PSR J1614$-$2230 would be helpful.\n", "  We present a novel procedure to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which in\noptics is the paraxial wave equation, with an initial multisingular vortex\nGaussian beam. This initial condition has a number of singularities in a plane\ntransversal to propagation embedded in a Gaussian beam. We use the scattering\nmodes, which are solutions of the paraxial wave equation that can be combined\nstraightforwardly to express the initial condition and therefore permit to\nsolve the problem. To construct the scattering modes one needs to obtain a\nparticular set of polynomials, which play an analogous role than Laguerre\npolynomials for Laguerre-Gaussian modes. We demonstrate here the recurrence\nrelations needed to determine these polynomials. To stress the utility and\nstrength of the method we solve first the problem of an initial Gaussian beam\nwith two positive singularities and a negative one embedded in. We show that\nthe solution permits one to obtain analytical expressions. These can used to\nobtain closed expressions for meaningful quantities, like the distance at which\nthe positive and negative singularities merge, closing the loop of a vortex\nline. Furthermore, we present an example of calculation of an specific\ndiscrete-Gauss state, which is the solution of the diffraction of a\nLaguerre-Gauss state showing definite angular momentum (that is, a highly\ncharged vortex) by a thin diffractive element showing certain discrete\nsymmetry. We show that thereby this problem is solved in a much simpler way\nthan using the previous procedure based in the integral Fresnel diffraction\nmethod.\n", "  Many dynamical processes on real world networks display complex temporal\npatterns as, for instance, a fat-tailed distribution of inter-events times,\nleading to heterogeneous waiting times between events. In this work, we focus\non distributions whose average inter-event time diverges, and study its impact\non the dynamics of random walkers on networks. The process can naturally be\ndescribed, in the long time limit, in terms of Riemann-Liouville fractional\nderivatives. We show that all the dynamical modes possess, in the asymptotic\nregime, the same power law relaxation, which implies that the dynamics does not\nexhibit time-scale separation between modes, and that no mode can be neglected\nversus another one, even for long times. Our results are then confirmed by\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We study crystalline fluoride microresonators for mid-infrared applications.\nWhispering gallery mode resonators were fabricated with BaF$_2$, CaF$_2$ and\nMgF$_2$ crystals. The quality factors were measured at wavelengths of 1.56\n{\\mu}m and 4.58 {\\mu}m. The impacts of fabrication technique, impurities,\nmultiphonon absorption and surface water are investigated. It is found that\nMgF2 resonators have room temperature Q factor of $8.3\\times 10^6$ at\nwavelength of 4.58 {\\mu}m, limited by multiphonon absorption.\n", "  We describe the electronics and data acquisition system used in the first\nphase of the PandaX experiment -- a 120 kg dual-phase liquid xenon dark matter\ndirect detection experiment in the China Jin-Ping Underground Laboratory. This\nsystem utilized 180 channels of commercial flash ADC waveform digitizers. This\nsystem achieved low trigger threshold ($<$1 keV electron-equivalent energy) and\nlow deadtime data acquistion during the entire experimental run.\n", "  Some relations between families of two-character CFTs are explained using a\nslightly generalised coset construction, and the underlying theories (whose\nexistence was only conjectured based on the modular differential equation) are\nconstructed. The same method also gives rise to interesting new examples of\nCFTs with three and four characters.\n", "  We identify carrier scattering at densities below which it has previously\nbeen observed in semiconductor quantum wells. These effects are evident in the\npeakshapes of 2D double-quantum spectra, which change as a function of\nexcitation density. At high excitation densities ($\\geq 10^{9}$\ncarriers/,cm$^{-2}$) we observe untilted peaks similar to those reported in\nprevious experiments. At low excitation densities (<$10^{8}$ carriers\ncm$^{-2}$) we observe narrower, tilted peaks. Using a simple simulation, we\nshow that tilted peak-shapes are expected in double-quantum spectra when\ninhomogeneous broadening is much larger than homogeneous broadening, and that\nfast pure-decoherence of the double-quantum coherence can obscure this peak\ntilt. These results show that carrier interactions are important at lower\ndensities than previously expected, and that the `natural' double-quantum\npeakshapes are hidden by carrier interactions at the excitation densities\ntypically used. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that analysis of 2D\npeak-shapes in double-quantum spectroscopy provides an incisive tool for\nidentifying interactions at low excitation density.\n", "  The surface freezing and surface melting transitions exhibited by a model\ntwo-dimensional soft matter system is studied. The behaviour when confined\nwithin a wedge is also considered. The system consists of particles interacting\nvia a soft purely repulsive pair potential. Density functional theory (DFT) is\nused to calculate density profiles and thermodynamic quantities. The external\npotential due to the confining walls is modelled via a hard-wall with an\nadditional repulsive Yukawa potential. The surface phase behaviour depends on\nthe range and strength of this repulsion: When the repulsion strength is weak,\nthe wall promotes freezing at the surface of the wall. The thickness of this\nfrozen layer grows logarithmically as the bulk liquid-solid phase coexistence\nis approached. Our mean-field DFT predicts that this crystalline layer at the\nwall must be nucleated (i.e. there is a free energy barrier) and its formation\nis necessarily a first-order transition, referred to as `prefreezing', by\nanalogy with the prewetting transition. However, in contrast to the latter,\nprefreezing cannot terminate in a critical point, since the phase transition\ninvolves a change in symmetry. If the wall-fluid interaction is sufficiently\nlong ranged and the repulsion is strong enough, surface melting can instead\noccur. Then the interface between the wall and the bulk crystalline solid\nbecomes wet by the liquid phase as the chemical potential is decreased towards\nthe value at liquid-solid coexistence. It is observed that the finite thickness\nfluid film at the wall has a broken translational symmetry due to its proximity\nto the bulk crystal and so the nucleation of the wetting film can be either\nfirst-order or continuous. Our mean-field theory predicts that for certain wall\npotentials there is a premelting critical point analogous to the surface\ncritical point for the prewetting transition. In a wedge...\n", "  In 3D single particle imaging with X-ray free-electron lasers, particle\norientation is not recorded during measurement but is instead recovered as a\nnecessary step in the reconstruction of a 3D image from the diffraction data.\nHere we use harmonic analysis on the sphere to cleanly separate the angu- lar\nand radial degrees of freedom of this problem, providing new opportunities to\nefficiently use data and computational resources. We develop the\nExpansion-Maximization-Compression algorithm into a shell-by-shell approach and\nimplement an angular bandwidth limit that can be gradually raised during the\nreconstruction. We study the minimum number of patterns and minimum rotation\nsampling required for a desired angular and radial resolution. These extensions\nprovide new av- enues to improve computational efficiency and speed of\nconvergence, which are critically important considering the very large datasets\nexpected from experiment.\n", "  A recently proposed new mechanism of D-term triggered dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking is reviewed. Supersymmetry is dynamically broken by nonvanishing\nD-term vacuum expectation value, which is realized as a nontrivial solution of\nthe gap equation in the self-consistent approximation as in the case of\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model and BCS superconductivity.\n", "  This is the third installment of GOSSS, a massive spectroscopic survey of\nGalactic O stars, based on new homogeneous, high signal-to-noise ratio, R~2500\ndigital observations selected from the Galactic O-Star Catalog (GOSC). In this\npaper we present 142 additional stellar systems with O stars from both\nhemispheres, bringing the total of O-type systems published within the project\nto 590. Among the new objects there are 20 new O stars. We also identify 11 new\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s), of which 6 are of O+O type and 5 of\nO+B type, and an additional new tripled-lined spectroscopic binary (SB3) of\nO+O+B type. We also revise some of the previous GOSSS classifications, present\nsome egregious examples of stars erroneously classified as O-type in the past,\nintroduce the use of luminosity class IV at spectral types O4-O5.5, and adapt\nthe classification scheme to the work of Arias et al. (2016).\n", "  We study quantized enveloping algebras called twisted Yangians associated\nwith the symmetric pairs of types CI, BDI and DIII (in Cartan's classification)\nwhen the rank is small. We establish isomorphisms between these twisted\nYangians and the well known Olshanskii's twisted Yangians of types AI and AII,\nand also with the Molev-Ragoucy reflection algebras associated with symmetric\npairs of type AIII. We also construct isomorphisms with twisted Yangians in\nDrinfeld's original presentation.\n", "  In this work, we consider a noncommutative (NC) massless scalar field coupled\nto the classical nonrotational BTZ geometry. In a manner of the theories where\nthe gravity emerges from the underlying scalar field theory, we study the\neffective action and the entropy derived from this noncommutative model. In\nparticular, the entropy is calculated by making use of the two different\napproaches, the brick wall method and the heat kernel method designed for\nspaces with conical singularity. We show that the UV divergent structures of\nthe entropy, obtained through these two different methods, agree with each\nother. It is also shown that the same renormalization condition that removes\nthe infinities from the effective action can also be used to renormalize the\nentanglement entropy for the same system. Besides, the interesting feature of\nthe NC model considered here is that it allows an interpretation in terms of an\nequivalent system comprising of a commutative massive scalar field, but in a\nmodified geometry; that of the rotational BTZ black hole, the result that hints\nat a duality between the commutative and noncommutative systems in the\nbackground of a BTZ black hole.\n", "  We exploit the near-horizon conformal symmetry of rapidly spinning black\nholes to determine universal properties of their magnetospheres. Analytic\nexpressions are derived for the limiting form of the magnetosphere in the\nnear-horizon region. The symmetry is shown to imply that the black hole\nMeissner effect holds for free Maxwell fields but is generically violated for\nforce-free fields. We further show that in the extremal limit, near-horizon\nplasma particles are infinitely boosted relative to accretion flow. Active\ngalactic nuclei powered by rapidly spinning black holes are therefore natural\nsites for high-energy particle collisions.\n", "  We explore the impact of electron thermal conduction on the evolution of\nradiatively-cooled cold clouds embedded in flows of hot and fast material, as\noccur in outflowing galaxies. Performing a parameter study of three-dimensional\nadaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical simulations, we show that electron\nthermal conduction causes cold clouds to evaporate, but it can also extend\ntheir lifetimes by compressing them into dense filaments. We distinguish\nbetween low column-density clouds, which are disrupted on very short times, and\nhigh-column density clouds with much-longer disruption times that are set by a\nbalance between impinging thermal energy and evaporation. We provide fits to\nthe cloud lifetimes and velocities that can be used in galaxy-scale simulations\nof outflows, in which the evolution of individual clouds cannot be modeled with\nthe required resolution. Moreover, we show that the clouds are only accelerated\nto a small fraction of the ambient velocity because compression by evaporation\ncauses the clouds to present a small cross-section to the ambient flow. This\nmeans that either magnetic fields must suppress thermal conduction, or that the\ncold clouds observed in galaxy outflows are not formed of cold material carried\nout from the galaxy.\n", "  Isolated and full monolayer adsorption of various carboranethiol\n(C$_2$B$_{10}$H$_{12}$S) isomers on gold (111) surface have been investigated\nusing both the standard and van der Waals density functional theoretical\ncalculations. The effect of differing molecular dipole moment orientations on\nthe low energy adlayer geometries, the binding characteristics and the\nelectronic properties of the self-assembled monolayers of these isomers have\nbeen studied. Specifically, the binding energy and work function changes\nassociated with different molecules show a correlation with their dipole\nmoments. The adsorption is favored for the isomers with dipole moments parallel\nto the surface. Of the two possible unit cell structures, the (5$\\times$5) was\nfound to be more stable than the ($\\sqrt{19}\\times\\sqrt{19}$)R23.4$^o$ one.\n", "  Electron transport through Majorana nanowire with strongly asymmetric\ncouplings to normal metal leads is considered. In three terminal geometry\n(electrically grounded nanowire) it is shown that the presence of unbiased\nelectrode restores zero-bias anomaly even for strong Majorana energy splitting.\nFor effectively two-terminal geometry we show that electrical current through\nasymmetric Majorana junction is qualitatively different from the analogous\ncurrent through a resonant (Breit-Wigner) level.\n", "  String bit models provide a possible method to formulate a string as a\ndiscrete chain of pointlike string bits. When the bit number $M$ is large, a\nchain behaves as a continuous string. We study the simplest case that has only\none bosonic bit and one fermionic bit. The creation and annihilation operators\nare adjoint representations of the $U\\left(N\\right)$ color group. We show that\nthe supersymmetry reduces the parameter number of a Hamiltonian from 7 to 3\nand, at $N=\\infty$, ensures a continuous energy spectrum, which implies the\nemergence of one spatial dimension. The Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ is constructed so\nthat in the large $N$ limit it produces a world sheet spectrum with one\nGrassmann world sheet field. We concentrate on numerical study of the model in\nfinite $N$. For the Hamiltonian $H_{0}$, we find that the would-be ground\nenergy states disappear at $N=\\left(M-1\\right)/2$ for odd $M\\leq11$. Such a\nsimple pattern is spoiled if $H$ has an additional term $\\xi\\Delta H$ which\ndoes not affect the result of $N=\\infty$. The disappearance point moves to\nhigher (lower) $N$ when $\\xi$ increases (decreases). Particularly, the\n$\\pm\\left(H_{0}-\\Delta H\\right)$ cases suggest a possibility that the ground\nstate could survive at large $M$ and $M\\gg N$. Our study reveals that the model\nhas stringy behavior: when $N$ is fixed and large enough, the ground energy\ndecreases linearly with respect to $M$, and the excitation energy is roughly of\norder $M^{-1}$. We also verify that a stable system of Hamiltonian $\\pm\nH_{0}+\\xi\\Delta H$ requires $\\xi\\geq\\mp1$.\n", "  We report an efficient mechanism to generate a squeezed state of a mechanical\nmirror in an optomechanical system. We use especially tuned parametric\namplifier (PA) inside the cavity and the parametric photon phonon processes to\ntransfer quantum squeezing from photons to phonons with almost 100\\%\nefficiency. We get 50\\% squeezing of the mechanical mirror which is limited by\nthe PA. We present analytical results for the mechanical squeezing thus\nenabling one to understand the dependence of squeezing on system parameters\nlike gain of PA, cooperativity, temperature. As in cooling experiments the\ndetrimental effects of mirror's Brownian and zero point noises are strongly\nsuppressed by the pumping power. By judicious choice of the phases, the cavity\noutput is squeezed only if the mirror is squeezed thus providing us a direct\nmeasure of the mirror's squeezing. Further considerable larger squeezing of the\nmirror can be obtained by adding the known feedback techniques.\n", "  Recently an action for open superstring field theory was proposed where the\nNeveu-Schwarz sector is formulated in the large Hilbert space while the Ramond\nsector lives in a restriction of the small Hilbert space. The purpose of this\nnote is to clarify the relation of the restricted Hilbert space with other\napproaches and to formulate open superstring field theory entirely in the small\nHilbert space.\n", "  We summarize several semi-phenomenological approaches to estimate the\ninternal energy of one-component-plasma (OCP) in two (2D) and three (3D)\ndimensions. Particular attention is given to a hybrid approach, which\nreproduces the Debye-H$\\ddot{\\text{u}}$ckel asymptote in the limit of weak\ncoupling, the ion sphere (3D) and ion disc (2D) asymptotes in the limit of\nstrong coupling, and provides reasonable interpolation between these two\nlimits. More accurate ways to estimate the internal energy of 2D and 3D OCP are\nalso discussed. The accuracy of these analytic results is quantified by\ncomparison with existing data from numerical simulations. The relevance of the\nKTHNY theory in locating melting transition in 2D OCP is briefly discussed.\n", "  The determination of $|V_{cb}|$ using inclusive and exclusive (semi-)leptonic\ndecays exhibits a long-standing tension of varying ${\\cal O}(3 \\sigma)$\nsignificance. For the inclusive determination the decay rate is expanded in\n$1/m_b$ using heavy quark expansion, and from moments of physical observables\nthe higher order heavy quark parameters are extracted from experimental data in\norder to assess $|V_{cb}|$ from the normalisation. The drawbacks are high\ncorrelations both theoretically as well as experimentally among these\nobservables. We will scrutinise the inclusive determination in order to add a\nnew and less correlated observable. This observable is related to the decay\nangle of the charged lepton and can help to constrain the important heavy quark\nparameters in a new way. It may validate the current seemingly stable\nextraction of $|V_{cb}|$ from inclusive decays or hints to possible issues, and\neven may be sensitive to New Physics operators.\n", "  We study TmB_4, a frustrated magnet on the Archimedean Shastry-Sutherland\nlattice, through magnetization and transport experiments. The lack of\nanisotropy in resistivity shows that TmB_4 is an electronically\nthree-dimensional system. The magnetoresistance (MR) is hysteretic at\nlow-temperature even though a corresponding hysteresis in magnetization is\nabsent. The Hall resistivity shows unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE)\nand is linear above saturation despite a large MR. We propose that complex\nstructures at magnetic domain walls may be responsible for the hysteretic MR\nand may also lead to the AHE.\n", "  We study the relationship between stellar mass, star formation rate\n(SFR),ionization state, and gas-phase metallicity for a sample of 41 normal\nstar-forming galaxies at $3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 3.7$. The gas-phase oxygen\nabundance, ionization parameter, and electron density of ionized gas are\nderived from rest-frame optical strong emission lines measured on near-infrared\nspectra obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We remove the effect of these strong\nemission lines in the broad-band fluxes to compute stellar masses via spectral\nenergy distribution fitting, while the SFR is derived from the dust-corrected\nultraviolet luminosity. The ionization parameter is weakly correlated with the\nspecific SFR, but otherwise the ionization parameter and electron density do\nnot correlate with other global galaxy properties such as stellar mass, SFR,\nand metallicity. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z\\simeq3.3$ shows\nlower metallicity by $\\simeq 0.7$ dex than that at $z=0$ at the same stellar\nmass. Our sample shows an offset by $\\simeq 0.3$ dex from the locally defined\nmass-metallicity-SFR relation, indicating that simply extrapolating such\nrelation to higher redshift may predict an incorrect evolution of MZR.\nFurthermore, within the uncertainties we find no SFR-metallicity correlation,\nsuggesting a less important role of SFR in controlling the metallicity at high\nredshift. We finally investigate the redshift evolution of the MZR by using the\nmodel by Lilly et al. (2013), finding that the observed evolution from $z=0$ to\n$z\\simeq3.3$ can be accounted for by the model assuming a weak redshift\nevolution of the star formation efficiency.\n", "  The all-Galaxy CO survey of Dame, Hartmann, & Thaddeus (2001) is by far the\nmost uniform, large-scale Galactic CO survey. Using a dendrogram-based\ndecomposition of this survey, we present a catalog of 1064 massive molecular\nclouds throughout the Galactic plane. This catalog contains $2.5 \\times 10^8$\nsolar masses, or $25^{+10.7}_{-5.8} \\%$ of the Milky Way's estimated H$_2$\nmass. We track clouds in some spiral arms through multiple quadrants. The power\nindex of Larson's first law, the size-linewidth relation, is consistent with\n0.5 in all regions - possibly due to an observational bias - but clouds in the\ninner Galaxy systematically have significantly (~ 30%) higher linewidths at a\ngiven size, indicating that their linewidths are set in part by Galactic\nenvironment. The mass functions of clouds in the inner Galaxy versus the outer\nGalaxy are both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct. The inner Galaxy\nmass spectrum is best described by a truncated power-law with a power index of\n$\\gamma=-1.6\\pm0.1$ and an upper truncation mass $M_0 = (1.0 \\pm 0.2) \\times\n10^7 M_\\odot$, while the outer Galaxy mass spectrum is better described by a\nnon-truncating power law with $\\gamma=-2.2\\pm0.1$ and an upper mass $M_0 = (1.5\n\\pm 0.5) \\times 10^6 M_\\odot$, indicating that the inner Galaxy is able to form\nand host substantially more massive GMCs than the outer Galaxy. Additionally,\nwe have simulated how the Milky Way would appear in CO from extragalactic\nperspectives, for comparison with CO maps of other galaxies.\n", "  The traditional derivation of the elastic anomalies associated with\nferroelectric (FE) phase transitions in the framework of the Landau theory is\ncombined with the piezoelectric constitutive relations instead of being\nexplicitly carried out with a definite expression of the FE part of the free\nenergy. In this manner it is shown that the softening within the FE phase is of\nelectrostrictive and hence piezoelectric origin. Such a piezoelectric softening\nmay be canceled by the better known piezoelectric stiffening, when the\npiezoelectric charges formed during the vibration are accompanied by the\ndepolarization field, as for example in Brillouin scattering experiments. As\nexperimental validation, we present new measurements on Zr-rich PZT, where the\nFE phase transforms into antiferroelectric on cooling or doping with La, and a\ncomparison of existing measurements made on FE PZT with low frequency and\nBrillouin scattering experiments.\n", "  The nonlinear Vlasov equation contains the full nonlinear dynamics and\ncollective effects of a given Hamiltonian system. The linearized approximation\nis not valid for a variety of interesting systems, nor is it simple to extend\nto higher order. It is also well-known that the linearized approximation to the\nVlasov equation is invalid for long times, due to its inability to correctly\ncapture fine phase space structures. We derive a perturbation theory for the\nVlasov equation based on the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the phase\nspace evolution. We obtain an explicit perturbation series for a dressed\nHamiltonian applicable to arbitrary systems whose dynamics can be described by\nthe nonlinear Vlasov equation.\n", "  Kinetic facilitated models and the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) model B are\nwithin those systems known to exhibit a discontinuous dynamical transition with\na two step relaxation. We consider a general scaling approach, within mean\nfield theory, for such systems by considering the behavior of the density\ncorrelator <q(t)> and the dynamical susceptibility <q^2(t)> -<q(t)>^2. Focusing\non the Fredrickson and Andersen (FA) facilitated spin model on the Bethe\nlattice, we extend a cluster approach that was previously developed for\ncontinuous glass transitions by Arenzon et al (Phys. Rev. E 90, 020301(R)\n(2014)) to describe the decay to the plateau, and consider a damage spreading\nmechanism to describe the departure from the plateau. We predict scaling laws,\nwhich relate dynamical exponents to the static exponents of mean field\nbootstrap percolation. The dynamical behavior and the scaling laws for both\ndensity correlator and dynamical susceptibility coincide with those predicted\nby MCT. These results explain the origin of scaling laws and the universal\nbehavior associated with the glass transition in mean field, which is\ncharacterized by the divergence of the static length of the bootstrap\npercolation model with an upper critical dimension d_c=8.\n", "  We study charged black holes in D dimensional AdS space, in the presence of\nfour derivative Weyl correction. We obtain the black hole solution\nperturbatively up to first as well as second order in the Weyl coupling, and\nshow that first law of black hole thermodynamics is satisfied in all\ndimensions. We study its thermodynamic phase transition and then calculate the\nquasinormal frequencies of the massless scalar field perturbation. We find\nthat, here too, the quasinormal frequencies capture the essence of black hole\nphase transition. Few subtleties near the second order critical point are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Temporarily Captured Orbiters (TCOs) are Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which make\na few orbits of Earth before returning to heliocentric orbits. Only one TCO has\nbeen observed to date, 2006 RH120, captured by Earth for one year before\nescaping. Detailed modeling predicts capture should occur from the NEO\npopulation predominantly through the Sun-Earth L1 and L2 points, with 1% of\nTCOs impacting Earth and approximately 0.1% of meteoroids being TCOs. Although\nthousands of meteoroid orbits have been measured, none until now have\nconclusively exhibited TCO behaviour, largely due to difficulties in measuring\ninitial meteoroid speed with sufficient precision. We report on a precise\nmeteor observation of January 13, 2014 by a new generation of all-sky fireball\ndigital camera systems operated in the Czech Republic as part of the European\nFireball Network, providing the lowest natural object entry speed observed in\ndecades long monitoring by networks world-wide. Modeling atmospheric\ndeceleration and fragmentation yields an initial mass of ~5 kg and diameter of\n15 cm, with a maximum Earth-relative velocity just over 11.0 km/s. Spectral\nobservations prove its natural origin. Back-integration across observational\nuncertainties yields a 92 - 98% probability of TCO behaviour, with close lunar\ndynamical interaction. The capture duration varies across observational\nuncertainties from 48 days to 5+ years. We also report on two low-speed impacts\nrecorded by US Government sensors, and we examine Prairie Network event PN39078\nfrom 1965 having an extremely low entry speed of 10.9 km/s. In these cases\nuncertainties in measurement and origin make TCO designation uncertain.\n", "  We present a set of relations between one-loop integral coefficients for\ndimensionally regulated QCD amplitudes. Within dimensional regularization, the\ncombined use of color-kinematics duality and integrand reduction yields the\nexistence of relations between the integrand residues of partial amplitudes\nwith different orderings of the external particles. These relations can be\nestablished for the cut-constructible contributions as well for the ones\nresponsible for rational terms. Starting from the general parametrization of\none-loop residues and applying Laurent expansion in order to extract the\ncoefficients of the amplitude decomposition in terms of master integrals, we\nshow that the full set of relations can be obtained by considering BCJ\nidentities between d-dimensional tree-levels. We provide explicit examples for\nmulti-gluon scattering amplitudes at one-loop.\n", "  Galactic plane surveys of pristine molecular clouds are key for establishing\na Galactic-scale view of the earliest stages of star formation. For this reason\nPeretto & Fuller (2009) built an unbiased sample of IRDCs in the 10 deg < |l| <\n65 deg, |b|<1 deg region of the Galactic plane using Spitzer 8micron\nextinction. However, in absorption studies, intrinsic fluctuations in the\nmid-infrared background can be mis-interpreted as foreground clouds. The main\ngoal of the study presented here is to disentangle real clouds in the Spitzer\nDark Cloud (SDC) catalogue from artefacts due to fluctuations in the\nmid-infrared background. We constructed H_2 column density maps at ~18\"\nresolution using the 160micron and 250micron data from the Herschel Galactic\nplane survey Hi-GAL. We also developed an automated detection scheme that\nconfirms the existence of a SDC through its association with a peak on these\nHerschel column density maps. Detection simulations, along with visual\ninspection of a small sub-sample of SDCs, have been performed to get better\ninsight into the limitations of our automated identification scheme. Our\nanalysis shows that 76(+/-19)% of the catalogued SDCs are real. This fraction\ndrops to 55(+/-12)% for clouds with angular diameters larger than ~1 arcminute.\nThe contamination of the PF09 catalogue by large spurious sources reflect the\nlarge uncertainties associated to the construction of the 8micron background\nemission, a key stage towards the identification of SDCs. A comparison of the\nHerschel confirmed SDC sample with the BGPS and ATLASGAL samples shows that\nSDCs probe a unique range of cloud properties, reaching down to more compact\nand lower column density clouds than any of these two (sub-)millimetre Galactic\nplane surveys.\n", "  Most of the observed features of radio {\\it gischt} relics such as spectral\nsteepening across the relic width and power-law-like integrated spectrum can be\nadequately explained by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model, in which\nrelativistic electrons are (re-)accelerated at shock waves induced in the\nintracluster medium. However, the steep spectral curvature in the integrated\nspectrum above $\\sim 2$ GHz detected in some radio relics such as the Sausage\nrelic in cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 may not be interpreted by simple radiative\ncooling of postshock electrons. In order to understand such steepening, we here\nconsider a model in which a spherical shock sweeps through and then exits out\nof a finite-size cloud with fossil relativistic electrons. The ensuing\nintegrated radio spectrum is expected to steepen much more than predicted for\naging postshock electrons, since the re-acceleration stops after the\ncloud-crossing time. Using DSA simulations that are intended to reproduce radio\nobservations of the Sausage relic, we show that both the integrated radio\nspectrum and the surface brightness profile can be fitted reasonably well, if a\nshock of speed, $u_s \\sim 2.5-2.8\\times 10^3 \\kms$, and sonic Mach number, $M_s\n\\sim 2.7-3.0$, traverses a fossil cloud for $\\sim 45$ Myr and the postshock\nelectrons cool further for another $\\sim 10$ Myr. This attempt illustrates that\nsteep curved spectra of some radio gischt relics could be modeled by adjusting\nthe shape of the fossil electron spectrum and adopting the specific\nconfiguration of the fossil cloud.\n", "  I report on our investigations into the impact of (un)polarized transverse\nmomentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs or TMDs) for gluons\nat hadron colliders, especially at A Fixed Target Experiment at the LHC\n(AFTER@LHC). In the context of high energy proton-proton collisions, we look at\nfinal states with low mass (e.g. $\\eta_b$) in order to investigate the\nnonperturbative part of TMD PDFs. We study the factorization theorem for the\n$q_T$ spectrum of $\\eta_b$ produced in proton-proton collisions relying on the\neffective field theory approach, defining the tools to perform phenomenological\ninvestigations at next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) and next-to-leading order\n(NLO) accuracy in the perturbation theory. We provide predictions for the\nunpolarized cross section and comment on the possibility of extracting\nnonperturbative information about the gluon content of the proton once data at\nlow transverse momentum are available.\n", "  We present the results obtained from detailed timing and spectral studies of\nthe Be/X-ray binary pulsar KS 1947+300 during its 2013 giant outburst. We used\ndata from Suzaku observations of the pulsar at two epochs i.e. on 2013 October\n22 (close to the peak of the outburst) and 2013 November 22. X-ray pulsations\nat $\\sim$18.81 s were clearly detected in the light curves obtained from both\nobservations. Pulse periods estimated during the outburst showed that the\npulsar was spinning up. The pulse profile was found to be single-peaked up to\n$\\sim$10 keV beyond which a sharp peak followed by a dip-like feature appeared\nat hard X-rays. The dip-like feature has been observed up to $\\sim$70 keV. The\n1-110 keV broad-band spectroscopy of both observations revealed that the\nbest-fit model comprised of a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power\nlaw with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody\ncomponent for the soft X-ray excess and two Gaussian functions at 6.4 and 6.7\nkeV for emission lines. Both the lines were identified as emission from neutral\nand He-like iron atom. To fit the spectra, we included the previously reported\ncyclotron absorption line at 12.2 keV. From the spin-up rate, the magnetic\nfield of the pulsar was estimated to be $\\sim$1.2$\\times$10$^{12}$ G and found\nto be comparable to that obtained from the detection of the cyclotron\nabsorption feature. Pulse-phase resolved spectroscopy revealed the pulsating\nnature of the soft X-ray excess component in phase with the continuum flux.\nThis confirms that the accretion column and/or accretion stream are the most\nprobable regions of pulsar's soft X-ray excess emission. The presence of the\npulsating soft X-ray excess in phase with continuum emission may be the\npossible reason for not observing the dip at soft X-rays.\n", "  The Standard Model contains a well-understood, natural, spin-0 diphoton\nresonance: the $\\pi^0$. Numerous studies have pointed out that the hint of a\nnew diphoton resonance at 750 GeV could be a pion analog, identified with the\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a chiral symmetry spontaneously broken by new\nstrong dynamics at the TeV scale. These \"hypercolor\" models are generically\nexpected to violate parity through a topological angle $\\tilde\\theta$. We\ndiscuss the physics of $\\tilde\\theta$ and its impact on the phenomenology of\nthe new sector. We also describe some of the theoretical implications of a\nnonzero $\\tilde\\theta$. In particular, $\\tilde\\theta$ can generate an ${\\cal\nO}(1)$ threshold correction to the QCD vacuum angle $\\theta$ near the TeV\nscale, sharply constraining ultraviolet solutions to the strong CP problem.\nAlternatively, finding that $\\tilde\\theta$ is small may be interpreted as\nevidence in favor of UV solutions to strong CP, particularly those based on\nspontaneously broken P or CP symmetries.\n", "  In this note we present an example of an extension of the Standard Model\nwhere unification of strong and electroweak interactions occurs at a level\ncomparable to that occurring in the minimal supersymmetric standard model.\n", "  The holographic dark energy model is obtained from a cosmological constant\ngenerated by generic quantum gravity effects giving a minimum length. By\ncontrast, the usual bound for the energy density to be limited by the formation\nof a black hole simply gives the Friedmann equation. The scale of the current\ncosmological constant relative to the inflationary scale is an arbitrary\nparameter characterizing initial conditions, which however can be fixed by\nintroducing a physical principle during inflation, as a function of the number\nof e-folds and the inflationary scale.\n", "  A minimalistic model for chimera states is presented. The model is a cellular\nautomaton (CA) which depends on only one adjustable parameter, the range of the\nnonlocal coupling, and is built from elementary cellular automata and the\nmajority (voting) rule. This suggests the universality of chimera-like behavior\nfrom a new point of view: Already simple CA rules based on the majority rule\nexhibit this behavior. After a short transient, we find chimera states for\narbitrary initial conditions, the system spontaneously splitting into stable\ndomains separated by static boundaries, ones synchronously oscillating and the\nothers incoherent. When the coupling range is local, nontrivial coherent\nstructures with different periodicities are formed.\n", "  We perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of\nisolated dwarf galaxies to compare different metal mixing models. In\nparticular, we examine the role of diffusion in the production of enriched\noutflows, and in determining the metallicity distributions of gas and stars. We\ninvestigate different diffusion strengths, by changing the pre-factor of the\ndiffusion coefficient, by varying how the diffusion coefficient is calculated\nfrom the local velocity distribution, and by varying whether the speed of sound\nis included as a velocity term. Stronger diffusion produces a tighter\n[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution in the gas, and cuts off the gas metallicity\ndistribution function at lower metallicities. Diffusion suppresses the\nformation of low-metallicity stars, even with weak diffusion, and also strips\nmetals from enriched outflows. This produces a remarkably tight correlation\nbetween \"metal mass-loading\" (mean metal outflow rate divided by mean metal\nproduction rate) and the strength of diffusion, even when the diffusion\ncoefficient is calculated in different ways. The effectiveness of outflows at\nremoving metals from dwarf galaxies and the metal distribution of the gas is\nthus dependent on the strength of diffusion. By contrast, we show that the\nmetallicities of stars are not strongly dependent on the strength of diffusion,\nprovided that some diffusion is present.\n", "  Bouncing oil droplets have been shown to follow de Broglie-Bohm like\ntrajectories and at the same time they exhibit attractive and repulsive\npseudo-gravitation. We propose a model aimed at rendering account of these\nphenomenological observations. It inspires, in a more speculative approach, a\ntoy model for quantum gravity.\n", "  We show how to consistently renormalize $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ and $\\mathcal{N} =\n2$ super-Yang-Mills theories in flat space with a local (i.e.\nspace-time-dependent) renormalization scale in a holomorphic scheme. The action\ngets enhanced by a term proportional to derivatives of the holomorphic\ncoupling. In the $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ case, this new action is exact at all orders\nin perturbation theory.\n", "  We analyze the equilibrium configuration for a modulated beam with sharp\nboundaries exposed to the fields self-generated by the interaction with a\nplasma. Through a semi-analytical approach we show the presence of multiple\nequilibrium configurations and we determine the one more suitable for wakefield\nexcitation. Once pointed out the absence of confinement for the front of the\nbeam and the consequently divergence driven by the emittance, we study the\nevolution of the equilibrium configuration while propagating in the plasma,\ndiscarding all the others time-dependencies. We show the onset of a rigid\nbackward drift of the equilibrium configuration and we provide an explanation\nin the increasing length of the first bunch.\n", "  We examine the dark matter interpretation of the modulation signal reported\nby the DAMA experiment from the perspective of effective field theories\ndisplaying Galilean invariance. We consider the most general effective coupling\nleading to the elastic scattering of a dark matter particle with spin 0 or 1/2\noff a nucleon, and we analyze the compatibility of the DAMA signal with the\nnull results from other direct detection experiments, as well as with the\nnon-observation of a high energy neutrino flux in the direction of the Sun from\ndark matter annihilation. To this end, we develop a novel semi-analytical\napproach for comparing experimental results in the high-dimensional parameter\nspace of the non-relativistic effective theory. Assuming the standard halo\nmodel, we find a strong tension between the dark matter interpretation of the\nDAMA modulation signal and the null result experiments. We also list possible\nways-out of this conclusion.\n", "  We demonstrate that a thermal transistor can be made up with a quantum system\nof 3 interacting subsystems , coupled to a thermal reservoir each. This thermal\ntransistor is analogous to an electronic bipolar one with the ability to\ncontrol the thermal currents at the collector and at the emitter with the\nimposed thermal current at the base. This is achieved determining the heat\nfluxes by means of the strong-coupling formalism. For the case of 3 interacting\nspins, in which one of them is coupled to the other 2, that are not directly\ncoupled, it is shown that high amplification can be obtained in a wide range of\nenergy parameters and temperatures. The proposed quantum transistor could, in\nprinciple, be used to develop devices such as a thermal modulator and a thermal\namplifier in nano systems.\n", "  By considering driven diffusive dynamics of exciton polaritons in an optical\nmicrocavity with an embedded molybdenum disulfide monolayer, we determine\nexperimentally relevant range of parameters at which room-temperature\nsuperfuidity can be observed. It is shown that the superfluid transitions\noccurs in a trapped polariton gas at laser pumping power $P>600$ mW and and\ntrapping potential strength $k > 50$ eV/cm$^2$. We also propose a simple\nanalytic model that provides a useful estimate for the polariton gas density,\nwhich enables one to determine the conditions for observation of room\ntemperature polariton superfluidity.\n", "  In the present work some generalizations of the Hawking singularity theorems\nin the context of $f(R)$ theories are presented. The assumptions are of these\ngeneralized theorems is that the matter fields satisfy the conditions\n$\\bigg(T_{ij}-\\frac{g_{ij}}{2} T\\bigg)k^i k^j\\geq 0$ for any generic unit time\nlike field, that the scalaron takes bounded positive values during its\nevolution, and that the resulting space time is globally hyperbolic. Then, if\nthere exist a Cauchy hyper surface $\\Sigma$ for which the expansion parameter\n$\\theta$ of the geodesic congruence emanating orthogonally from $\\Sigma$\nsatisfies some specific conditions, it may be shown that the resulting space\ntime is geodesically incomplete. Some mathematical results of reference\n\\cite{fewster} are very important for proving this. The generalized theorems\npresented here apply directly some specific models such as the Hu-Sawicki or\nStarobinsky ones \\cite{especif3}, \\cite{capoziello4}. However, for other\nscenarios, some extra assumptions should be implemented for the geodesic\nincompleteness to take place. However, the negation of the hypothesis of these\nresults does not necessarily imply that a singularity is absent, but that other\nmathematical results should be considered to prove that.\n", "  Background: Low-energy transfer reactions in which a proton is stripped from\na deuteron projectile and dropped into a target play a crucial role in the\nformation of nuclei in both primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, as well as\nin the study of exotic nuclei using radioactive beam facilities and inverse\nkinematics. Ab initio approaches have been successfully applied to describe the\n$^3$H$(d,n)^4$He and $^3$He$(d,p)^4$He fusion processes.\n  Purpose: An ab initio treatment of transfer reactions would also be desirable\nfor heavier targets. In this work, we extend the ab initio description of\n$(d,p)$ reactions to processes with light $p$-shell nuclei. As a first\napplication, we study the elastic scattering of deuterium on $^7$Li and the\n${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li transfer reaction based on a two-body\nHamiltonian.\n  Methods: We use the no-core shell model to compute the wave functions of the\nnuclei involved in the reaction, and describe the dynamics between targets and\nprojectiles with the help of microscopic-cluster states in the spirit of the\nresonating group method.\n  Results: The shape of the excitation functions for deuteron impinging on\n${}^{7}$Li are qualitatively reproduced up to the deuteron breakup energy. The\ninterplay between $d$-$^7$Li and $p$-$^8$Li particle-decay channels determines\nsome features of the ${}^{9}$Be spectrum above the $d$+${}^{7}$Li threshold.\nOur prediction for the parity of the 17.298 MeV resonance is at odds with the\nexperimental assignment\n  Conclusions: Deuteron stripping reactions with $p$-shell targets can now be\ncomputed ab initio, but calculations are very demanding. A quantitative\ndescription of the ${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li reaction will require further\nwork to include the effect of three-nucleon forces and additional decay\nchannels, and improve the convergence rate of our calculations.\n", "  We have collected broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of three BL\nLac objects, 3FGL J0022.1$-$1855 (z=0.689), 3FGL J0630.9$-$2406 (z >~ 1.239),\nand 3FGL J0811.2$-$7529 (z=0.774), detected by Fermi with relatively flat GeV\nspectra. By observing simultaneously in the near-IR to hard X-ray band, we can\nwell characterize the high end of the synchrotron component of the SED. Thus,\nfitting the SEDs to synchro-Compton models of the dominant emission from the\nrelativistic jet, we can constrain the underlying particle properties and\npredict the shape of the GeV Compton component. Standard extragalactic\nbackground light (EBL) models explain the high-energy absorption well, with\npoorer fits for high UV models. The fits show clear evidence for EBL absorption\nin the Fermi spectrum of our highest redshift source 3FGL J0630.9$-$2406. While\nsynchrotron self-Compton models adequately describe the SEDs, the situation may\nbe complicated by possible external Compton components. For 3FGL\nJ0811.2$-$7529, we also discover a nearby serendipitous source in the X-ray\ndata, which is almost certainly another lower synchrotron peak frequency\n($\\nu^{sy}_{pk}$) BL Lac, that may contribute flux in the Fermi band. Since our\nsources are unusual high-luminosity, moderate $\\nu^{sy}_{pk}$ BL Lacs we\ncompare these quantities and the Compton dominance, the ratio of peak\ninverse-Compton to peak synchrotron luminosities ($L^{IC}_{pk}/L^{sy}_{pk}$),\nwith those of the full Fermi BL Lac population.\n", "  Accretion onto central massive black holes in galaxies is often modelled with\nthe Bondi solution. In this paper we study a generalization of the classical\nBondi accretion theory, considering the additional effects of the gravitational\npotential of the host galaxy, and of electron scattering in the optically thin\nlimit. We provide a general analysis of the bias in the estimates of the Bondi\nradius and mass accretion rate, when adopting as fiducial values for the\ndensity and temperature at infinity the values of these quantities measured at\nfinite distance from the central black hole. We also give general formulae to\ncompute the correction terms of the critical accretion parameter in relevant\nasymptotic regimes. A full analytical discussion is presented in the case of an\nHernquist galaxy, when the problem reduces to the discussion of a cubic\nequation, therefore allowing for more than one critical point in the accretion\nstructure. The results are useful for observational works (especially in the\ncase of low-luminosity systems), as well as for numerical simulations, where\naccretion rates are usually defined in terms of the gas properties near the\n", "  The influence of the core polarization on the effective nuclear interaction\nof asymmetric nuclear matter is calculated in the framework of the induced\ninteraction theory. The strong isospin dependence of the density and spin\ndensity fluctuations is studied along with the interplay between the neutron\nand proton core polarizations. Moving from symmetric nuclear matter to pure\nneutron matter the crossover of the induced interaction from attractive to\nrepulsive in the spin singlet state is determined as a function of the isospin\nimbalance.The density range in which it occurs is also determined. For the spin\ntriplet state the induced interaction turns out to be always repulsive. The\nimplications of the results for the neutron star superfluid phases are shortly\ndiscussed.\n", "  A puzzling aspect of the AdS/CFT correspondence is that a single bulk\noperator can be mapped to multiple different boundary operators, or precursors.\nBy improving upon a recent model of Mintun, Polchinski, and Rosenhaus, we\ndemonstrate explicitly how this ambiguity arises in a simple model of the field\ntheory. In particular, we show how gauge invariance in the boundary theory\nmanifests as a freedom in the smearing function used in the bulk-boundary\nmapping, and explicitly show how this freedom can be used to localize the\nprecursor in different spatial regions. We also show how the ambiguity can be\nunderstood in terms of quantum error correction, by appealing to the\nentanglement present in the CFT. The concordance of these two approaches\nsuggests that gauge invariance and entanglement in the boundary field theory\nare intimately connected to the reconstruction of local operators in the dual\nspacetime.\n", "  If the axion exists and if the initial axion field value is uncorrelated at\ncausally disconnected points, then it should be possible to predict the\nefficiency of cosmological axion production, relating the axionic dark matter\ndensity to the axion mass. The main obstacle to making this prediction is\ncorrectly treating the axion string cores. We develop a new algorithm for\ntreating the axionic string cores correctly in 2+1 dimensions. When the axionic\nstring cores are given their full physical string tension, axion production is\nabout twice as efficient as in previous simulations. We argue that the string\nnetwork in 2+1 dimensions should behave very differently than in 3+1\ndimensions, so this result cannot be simply carried over to the physical case.\nWe outline how to extend our method to 3+1D axion string dynamics.\n", "  The Hubble Source Catalog is designed to help optimize science from the\nHubble Space Telescope by combining the tens of thousands of visit-based source\nlists in the Hubble Legacy Archive into a single master catalog. Version 1 of\nthe Hubble Source Catalog includes WFPC2, ACS/WFC, WFC3/UVIS, and WFC3/IR\nphotometric data generated using SExtractor software to produce the individual\nsource lists. The catalog includes roughly 80 million detections of 30 million\nobjects involving 112 different detector/filter combinations, and about 160\nthousand HST exposures. Source lists from Data Release 8 of the Hubble Legacy\nArchive are matched using an algorithm developed by Budavari & Lubow (2012).\nThe mean photometric accuracy for the catalog as a whole is better than 0.10\nmag, with relative accuracy as good as 0.02 mag in certain circumstances (e.g.,\nbright isolated stars). The relative astrometric residuals are typically within\n10 mas, with a value for the mode (i.e., most common value) of 2.3 mas. The\nabsolute astrometric accuracy is better than $\\sim$0.1 arcsec for most sources,\nbut can be much larger for a fraction of fields that could not be matched to\nthe PanSTARRS, SDSS, or 2MASS reference systems. In this paper we describe the\ndatabase design with emphasis on those aspects that enable the users to fully\nexploit the catalog while avoiding common misunderstandings and potential\npitfalls. We provide usage examples to illustrate some of the science\ncapabilities and data quality characteristics, and briefly discuss plans for\nfuture improvements to the Hubble Source Catalog.\n", "  We present a method to compute the number of particles occupying spherical\nsingle-particle (SSP) levels within the energy density functional (EDF)\nframework. These SSP levels are defined for each nucleus by performing\nself-consistent mean-field calculations. The nuclear many-body states, in which\nthe occupation numbers are evaluated, are obtained with a symmetry conserving\nconfiguration mixing (SCCM) method based on the Gogny EDF. The method allows a\ncloser comparison between EDF and shell model with configuration mixing in\nlarge valence spaces (SM-CI) results, and can serve as a guidance to define\nphysically sound valence spaces for SM-CI calculations. As a first application\nof the method, we analyze the onset of deformation in neutron-rich $N=40$\nisotones and the role of the SSP levels around this harmonic oscillator magic\nnumber, with particular emphasis in the structure of $^{64}$Cr.\n", "  The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor reported the possible detection of the\ngamma-ray counterpart of a binary black hole merger event, GW150914. We show\nthat the gamma-ray emission is caused by a relativistic outflow with Lorentz\nfactor larger than 10. Subsequently, debris outflow pushes the ambient gas to\nform a shock, which is responsible for the afterglow synchrotron emission. We\nfind that the 1.4 GHz radio flux peaks at $\\sim10^5$ sec after the burst\ntrigger. If the ambient matter is dense enough with density larger than\n$\\sim10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$, then the peak radio flux is $\\sim0.1$ mJy, which is\ndetectable with radio telescopes such as the Very Large Array. The optical\nafterglow peaks earlier than the radio, and if the ambient matter density is\nlarger than $\\sim0.1$ cm$^{-3}$, the optical flux is detectable with large\ntelescopes such as the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. To reveal the currently\nunknown mechanisms of the outflow and its gamma-ray emission associated with\nthe binary black hole merger event, follow-up electromagnetic observations of\nafterglows are important. Detection of the afterglow will localize the sky\nposition of the gravitational wave and the gamma-ray emissions, and it will\nsupport the physical association between them.\n", "  We present the detailed quantum electrodynamical description of\nVavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by a relativistic twisted electron in the\ntransparent medium. Simple expressions for the spectral and spectral-angular\ndistributions as well as for the polarization properties of the emitted\nradiation are obtained. Unlike the plane-wave case, the twisted electron\nproduces radiation within the annular angular region, with enhancement towards\nits boundaries. Additionally, the emitted photons can have linear polarization\nnot only in the scattering plane but also in the orthogonal direction. We find\nthat the Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation emitted by an electron in a superposition\nof two vortex states exhibits a strong azimuthal asymmetry. Thus, the\nVavilov-Cherenkov radiation offers itself as a convenient diagnostic tool of\nsuch electrons and complements the traditional microscopic imaging.\n", "  We report the spectral characteristics of fully chaotic and non-chaotic\nmicrocavity lasers under continuous-wave operating conditions. It is found that\nfully chaotic microcavity lasers operate in single mode, whereas non-chaotic\nmicrocavity lasers operate in multimode. The suppression of multimode lasing\nfor fully chaotic microcavity lasers is explained by large spatial overlaps of\nthe resonance wave functions that spread throughout the two-dimensional cavity\ndue to the ergodicity of chaotic ray orbits.\n", "  Based on the theory of relativistic superstrong magnetic fields(SMFs), by\nusing the method of the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac approximations, we investigate the\nproblem of strong electron screening(SES) in SMFs, and the influence of SES on\nthe nuclear reaction of $^{23}$Mg $(p, \\gamma)$$^{24}$Al. Our calculations show\nthat the nuclear reaction will be markedly effected by the SES in SMFs in the\nsurface of magnetars. Our calculated screening rates can increase two orders of\nmagnitude due to SES in SMFs.\n", "  The first nonperturbative version of the multireference driven similarity\nrenormalization group (MR-DSRG) theory [C. Li and F. A. Evangelista, J. Chem.\nTheory Comput. $\\mathbf{11}$, 2097 (2015)] is introduced. The renormalization\ngroup structure of the MR-DSRG equations ensures numerical robustness and\navoidance of the intruder state problem, while the connected nature of the\namplitude and energy equations guarantees size consistency and extensivity. We\napproximate the MR-DSRG equations by keeping only one- and two-body operators\nand using a linearized recursive commutator approximation of the\nBaker--Campbell--Hausdorff expansion [T. Yanai and G. K.-L. Chan, J. Chem.\nPhys. $\\mathbf{124}$, 194106 (2006)]. The resulting MR-LDSRG(2) equations\ncontain only 39 terms and scales as ${\\cal O}(N^2 N_{\\rm P}^2 N_{\\rm H}^2)$\nwhere $N_{\\rm H}$, $N_{\\rm P}$, and $N$ correspond to the number of hole,\nparticle, and total orbitals, respectively. Benchmark MR-LDSRG(2) computations\non the hydrogen fluoride and molecular nitrogen binding curves and the\nsinglet-triplet splitting of $p$-benzyne yield results comparable in accuracy\nto those from multireference configuration interaction, Mukherjee\nmultireference coupled cluster theory, and internally-contracted multireference\ncoupled cluster theory.\n", "  We present observations collected in the CFHTLS-VIPERS region in the\nultraviolet (UV) with the GALEX satellite (far and near UV channels) and the\nnear infrared with the CFHT/WIRCam camera ($K_s$-band) over an area of 22 and\n27 deg$^2$, respectively. The depth of the photometry was optimized to measure\nthe physical properties (e.g., SFR, stellar masses) of all the galaxies in the\nVIPERS spectroscopic survey. The large volume explored by VIPERS will enable a\nunique investigation of the relationship between the galaxy properties and\ntheir environment (density field and cosmic web) at high redshift (0.5 < z <\n1.2). In this paper, we present the observations, the data reductions and the\nbuild-up of the multi-color catalogues. The CFHTLS-T0007 (gri-{\\chi}^2) images\nare used as reference to detect and measure the $K_s$-band photometry, while\nthe T0007 u-selected sources are used as priors to perform the GALEX photometry\nbased on a dedicated software (EMphot). Our final sample reaches $NUV_{AB}$~25\n(at 5{\\sigma}) and $K_{AB}$~22 (at 3{\\sigma}). The large spectroscopic sample\n(~51,000 spectroscopic redshifts) allows us to highlight the robustness of our\nstar/galaxy separation, and the reliability of our photometric redshifts with a\ntypical accuracy $\\sigma_z \\le$ 0.04 and a catastrophic failure rate {\\eta} <\n2% down to i~23. We present various tests on the $K_s$ band completeness and\nphotometric redshift accuracy by comparing with existing, overlapping deep\nphotometric catalogues. Finally, we discuss the BzK sample of passive and\nactive galaxies at high redshift and the evolution of galaxy morphology in the\n(NUV-r) vs (r-K_s) diagram at low redshift (z < 0.25) thanks to the high image\nquality of the CFHTLS. The images, catalogues and photometric redshifts for 1.5\nmillion sources (down to $NUV \\le$ 25 or $K_s \\le$ 22) are released and\navailable at this URL: http://cesam.lam.fr/vipers-mls/\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and\nstellar mass density from redshift z=0.2 to z=1.5 of a $K_{AB}$<22-selected\nsample with highly reliable photometric redshifts and over an unprecedentedly\nlarge area. Our study is based on NIR observations carried out with WIRCam at\nCFHT over the footprint of the VIPERS spectroscopic survey and benefits from\nthe high quality optical photometry from the CFHTLS and UV observations with\nthe GALEX satellite. The accuracy of our photometric redshifts is $\\sigma_z$ <\n0.03 and 0.05 for the bright ($i_{AB}$<22.5) and faint ($i_{AB}$>22.5) samples,\nrespectively. The SMF is measured with ~760,000 galaxies down to $K_s$=22 and\nover an effective area of ~22.4 deg$^2$, the latter of which drastically\nreduces the statistical uncertainties (i.e. Poissonian error & cosmic\nvariance). We point out the importance of a careful control of the photometric\ncalibration, whose impact becomes quickly dominant when statistical\nuncertainties are reduced, which will be a major issue for future generation of\ncosmological surveys with, e.g. EUCLID or LSST. By exploring the rest-frame\n(NUV-r) vs (r-$K_s$) color-color diagram separating star-forming and quiescent\ngalaxies, (1) we find that the density of very massive log($M_*/ M_{\\odot}$) >\n11.5 galaxies is largely dominated by quiescent galaxies and increases by a\nfactor 2 from z~1 to z~0.2, which allows for additional mass assembly via dry\nmergers, (2) we confirm a scenario where star formation activity is impeded\nabove a stellar mass log($M^*_{SF} / M_{\\odot}$) = 10.64$\\pm$0.01, a value that\nis found to be very stable at 0.2 < z < 1.5, (3) we discuss the existence of a\nmain quenching channel that is followed by massive star-forming galaxies, and\nfinally (4) we characterise another quenching mechanism required to explain the\nclear excess of low-mass quiescent galaxies observed at low redshift.\n", "  We present a new approach to understand the landscape of supernova explosion\nenergies, ejected nickel masses, and neutron star birth masses. In contrast to\nother recent parametric approaches, our model predicts the properties of\nneutrino-driven explosions based on the pre-collapse stellar structure without\nthe need for hydrodynamic simulations. The model is based on physically\nmotivated scaling laws and simple differential equations describing the shock\npropagation, the contraction of the neutron star, the neutrino emission, the\nheating conditions, and the explosion energetics. Using model parameters\ncompatible with multi-D simulations and a fine grid of thousands of supernova\nprogenitors, we obtain a variegated landscape of neutron star and black hole\nformation similar to other parameterised approaches and find good agreement\nwith semi-empirical measures for the \"explodability\" of massive stars. Our\npredicted explosion properties largely conform to observed correlations between\nthe nickel mass and explosion energy. Accounting for the coexistence of\noutflows and downflows during the explosion phase, we naturally obtain a\npositive correlation between explosion energy and ejecta mass. These\ncorrelations are relatively robust against parameter variations, but our\nresults suggest that there is considerable leeway in parametric models to widen\nor narrow the mass ranges for black hole and neutron star formation and to\nscale explosion energies up or down. Our model is currently limited to an\nall-or-nothing treatment of fallback and there remain some minor discrepancies\nbetween model predictions and observational constraints.\n", "  In this paper we examine in detail the non-commutative symplectic algebra\nunderlying quantum dynamics. We show that this algebra contains both the\nWeyl-von Neumann algebra and the Moyal algebra. The latter contains the Wigner\ndistribution as the kernel of the density matrix. The underlying\nnon-commutative geometry can be projected into either of two Abelian spaces,\nso-called `shadow phase spaces'. One of these is the phase space of Bohmian\nmechanics, showing that it is a fragment of the basic underlying algebra. The\nalgebraic approach is much richer, giving rise to two fundamental dynamical\ntime development equations which reduce to the Liouville equation and the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation in the classical limit. They also include the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation and its wave function, showing that these features are\na partial aspect of the more general non-commutative structure. We discuss\nbriefly the properties of this more general mathematical background from which\nthe non-commutative symplectic algebra emerges.\n", "  The low-frequency instability of a cylindrical poorly magnetized plasma with\nan inward-directed radial electric field is studied changing the gas pressure\nand the ion cyclotron frequency. The unstable frequency always decreases when\nthe gas pressure is increased indicating collisional effects. At a fixed\npressure, the unstable frequency increases with the magnetic field when the\nB-field is low and decreases at larger magnetic field strength. We find that\nthe transition between these two regimes is obtained when the ion cyclotron\nfrequency equals the ion-neutrals collision frequency. This is in agreement\nwith the theory of the slow-ion drift instability induced by the collisional\nslowing of the electric ion drift (A. Simon, Phys. Fluids 6, 382, (1963).\n", "  We report on the implementation of a tool for the analysis of second-order\nelastic stiffness tensors, provided with both an open-source Python module and\na standalone online application providing visualization tools of anisotropic\nmechanical properties. After describing the software features, how we compute\nthe conventional elastic constants and how we represent them graphically, we\nexplain our technical choices for the implementation. In particular, we focus\non why a Python module is used to generate the HTML web page with embedded\nJavascript for dynamical plots.\n", "  One of the key questions in the field of star formation is the role of\nstellar feedback on subsequent star formation process. The W3 giant molecular\ncloud complex at the western border of the W4 super bubble is thought to be\ninfluenced by the stellar winds of the massive stars in W4. AFGL333 is a ~10^4\nMsun cloud within W3. This paper presents a study of the star formation\nactivity within AFGL333 using deep JHKs photometry obtained from the NOAO\nExtremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager combined with Spitzer-IRAC-MIPS\nphotometry. Based on the infrared excess, we identify 812 candidate young\nstellar objects in the complex, of which 99 are classified as Class I and 713\nare classified as Class II sources. The stellar density analysis of young\nstellar objects reveals three major stellar aggregates within AFGL333, named\nhere AFGL333-main, AFGL333-NW1 and AFGL333-NW2. The disk fraction within\nAFGL333 is estimated to be ~50-60%. We use the extinction map made from the\nH-Ks colors of the background stars to understand the cloud structure and to\nestimate the cloud mass. The CO-derived extinction map corroborates the cloud\nstructure and mass estimates from NIR color method. From the stellar mass and\ncloud mass associated with AFGL333, we infer that the region is currently\nforming stars with an efficiency of ~4.5% and at a rate of ~2 - 3 Msun\nMyr-1pc-2. In general, the star formation activity within AFGL333 is comparable\nto that of nearby low mass star-forming regions. We do not find any strong\nevidence to suggest that the stellar feedback from the massive stars of nearby\nW4 super bubble has affected the global star formation properties of the\nAFGL333 region.\n", "  We study in detail the evolution of the 2015 outburst of GS 1354-64 (BW Cir)\nat optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths using Faulkes Telescope South/LCOGT,\nSMARTS and Swift. The outburst was found to stay in the hard X-ray state,\nalbeit being anomalously luminous with a peak luminosity of L$_{X} >$ 0.15\nL$_{Edd}$, which could be the most luminous hard state observed in a black hole\nX-ray binary. We found that the optical/UV emission is tightly correlated with\nthe X-ray emission, consistent with accretion disc irradiation and/or a jet\nproducing the optical emission. The X-ray spectra can be fitted well with a\nComptonisation model, and show softening towards the end of the outburst. In\naddition, we detect a QPO in the X-ray lightcurves with increasing centroid\nfrequency during the peak and decay periods of the outburst. The long-term\noptical lightcurves during quiescence show a statistically significant, slow\nrise of the source brightness over the 7 years prior to the 2015 outburst. This\nbehaviour as well as the outburst evolution at all wavelengths studied can be\nexplained by the disc instability model with irradiation and disc\nevaporation/condensation.\n", "  The linear magnetoelectric effect was measured in 500 nm Cr2O3 films grown by\nrf sputtering on Al2O3 substrates between top and bottom thin film Pt\nelectrodes. Magnetoelectric susceptibility was measured directly by applying an\nAC electric field and measuring the induced AC magnetic moment using\nsuperconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. A linear dependence\nof the induced AC magnetic moment on the AC electric field amplitude was found.\nThe temperature dependence of the magnetoelectric susceptibility agreed\nqualitatively and quantitatively with prior measurements of bulk single\ncrystals, but the characteristic temperatures of the film were lower than those\nof single crystals. It was also possible to reverse the sign of the\nmagnetoelectric susceptibility by reversing the sign of the magnetic field\napplied during cooling through the N\\'eel temperature. A competition between\ntotal magnetoelectric and Zeeman energies is proposed to explain the difference\nbetween film and bulk Cr2O3 regarding the cooling field dependence of the\nmagnetoelectric effect.\n", "  We investigate magnetization dynamics in a spin-Hall oscillator using a\ndirect current measurement as well as conventional microwave spectrum analysis.\nWhen the current applies an anti-damping spin-transfer torque, we observe a\nchange in resistance which we ascribe to the excitation of incoherent exchange\nmagnons. A simple model is developed based on the reduction of the effective\nsaturation magnetization, quantitatively explaining the data. The observed\nphenomena highlight the importance of exchange magnons on the operation of\nspin-Hall oscillators.\n", "  Weak lensing (WL) promises to be a particularly sensitive probe of both the\ngrowth of large scale structure (LSS) as well as the fundamental relation\nbetween matter density perturbations and metric perturbations, thus providing a\npowerful tool with which we may constrain modified theories of gravity (MG) on\ncosmological scales. Future deep, wide-field WL surveys will provide an\nunprecedented opportunity to constrain deviations from General Relativity (GR).\nEmploying a three-dimensional (3D) analysis based on the spherical\nFourier-Bessel (sFB) expansion, we investigate the extent to which MG theories\nwill be constrained by a typical 3D WL survey configuration including noise\nfrom the intrinsic ellipticity distribution $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}$ of source\ngalaxies. Here we focus on two classes of screened theories of gravity: i)\n$f(R)$ chameleon models and ii) environmentally dependent dilaton models. We\nuse one-loop perturbation theory combined with halo models in order to\naccurately model the evolution of matter power-spectrum with redshift in these\ntheories. Using a Fisher information matrix based approach, we show that for an\nall-sky spectroscopic survey, the parameter $f_{R_0}$ can be constrained in the\nrange $f_{R_0}< 5\\times 10^{-6}(9\\times 10^{-6})$ for $n=1(2)$ with a 3$\\sigma$\nconfidence level. This can be achieved by using relatively low order angular\nharmonics $\\ell<100$. Including higher order harmonics $\\ell>100$ can further\ntighten the constraints, making them comparable to current solar-system\nconstraints. We also employ a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to\nstudy the parameter degeneracies in the MG parameters. Our results can\ntrivially be extended to other MG theories, such as the K-mouflage models. The\nconfusion from intrinsic ellipticity correlation and modification of the matter\npower-spectrum at small scale due to feedback mechanisms is briefly discussed.\n", "  We introduce a method which enables to directly compare the impact of elastic\nstrain on the optical properties of distinct quantum dots (QDs). Specifically,\nthe QDs are integrated in a cross-section of a semiconductor core wire which is\nsurrounded by an amorphous straining shell. Detailed numerical simulations show\nthat, thanks to the mechanical isotropy of the shell, the strain field in a\ncore section is homogeneous. Furthermore, we use the core material as an in\nsitu strain gauge, yielding reliable values for the emitter energy tuning\nslope. This calibration technique is applied to self-assembled InAs QDs\nsubmitted to incremental tensile strain along their growth axis. In contrast to\nrecent studies conducted on similar QDs stressed perpendicularly to their\ngrowth axis, optical spectroscopy reveals 5-10 times larger tuning slopes, with\na moderate dispersion. These results highlight the importance of the stress\ndirection to optimise QD response to applied strain, with implications both in\nstatic and dynamic regimes. As such, they are in particular relevant for the\ndevelopment of wavelength-tunable single photon sources or hybrid QD\nopto-mechanical systems.\n", "  We perform a first study of 4-jet production in a complete high-energy\nfactorization (HEF) framework. We include and discuss contributions from both\nsingle-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton scattering (DPS). The\ncalculations are performed for kinematical situations relevant for two\nexperimental measurements (ATLAS and CMS) at the LHC. We compare our results to\nthose reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for different sets of\nkinematical cuts. The results of the HEF approach are compared with their\ncounterparts for collinear factorization. For symmetric cuts the DPS HEF result\nis considerably smaller than the one obtained with collinear factorization. The\nmechanism leading to this difference is of kinematical nature. We conclude that\nan analysis of inclusive 4-jet production with asymmetric $p_T$-cuts below 50\nGeV would be useful to enhance the DPS contribution relative to the SPS\ncontribution. In contrast to the collinear approach, the HEF approach nicely\ndescribes the distribution of the $\\Delta S$ variable, which involves all four\njets and their angular correlations.\n", "  Systems with holes, such as colloidal handlebodies and toroidal droplets,\nhave been studied in the nematic liquid crystal (NLC) 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl\n(5CB): both point and ring topological defects can occur within each hole and\naround the system, while conserving the system's overall topological charge.\nHowever, what has not been fully appreciated is the ability to manipulate the\nhole geometry with homeotropic (perpendicular) anchoring conditions to induce\ncomplex, saddle-like deformations. We exploit this by creating an array of\nholes suspended in an NLC cell with oriented planar (parallel) anchoring at the\ncell boundaries. We study both 5CB and a binary mixture of bicyclohexane\nderivatives (CCN-47 and CCN-55). Through simulations and experiments, we study\nhow the bulk saddle deformations of each hole interact to create novel defect\nstructures, including an array of disclination lines, reminiscent of those\nfound in liquid crystal blue phases. The line locations are tunable via the NLC\nelastic constants, the cell geometry, and the size and spacing of holes in the\narray. This research lays the groundwork for the control of complex elastic\ndeformations of varying length scales via geometrical cues in materials that\nare renowned in the display industry for their stability and easy\nmanipulability.\n", "  We analyze dark pulse Kerr frequency combs in optical resonators with normal\ngroup-velocity dispersion using the Lugiato-Lefever model. We show that in the\ntime domain these correspond to interlocked switching waves between the upper\nand lower homogeneous states, and explain how this fact accounts for many of\ntheir experimentally observed properties. Modulational instability does not\nplay any role in their existence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed map\nindicating where stable dark pulse Kerr combs can be found in parameter space,\nand how they are destabilized for increasing values of frequency detuning.\n", "  Current fluctuations in boundary-driven diffusive systems are, in many cases,\nstudied using hydrodynamic theories. Their predictions are then expected to be\nvalid for currents which scale inversely with the system size. To study this\nquestion in detail, we introduce a class of large-N models of one-dimensional\nboundary-driven diffusive systems, whose current large deviation functions are\nexactly derivable for any finite number of sites. Surprisingly, we find that\nfor some systems the predictions of the hydrodynamic theory may hold well\nbeyond their naive regime of validity. Specifically, we show that, while a\nsymmetric partial exclusion process exhibits non-hydrodynamic behaviors\nsufficiently far beyond the naive hydrodynamic regime, a symmetric inclusion\nprocess is well described by the hydrodynamic theory for arbitrarily large\ncurrents. We conjecture, and verify for zero-range processes, that the\nhydrodynamic theory captures the statistics of arbitrarily large currents for\nall models where the mobility coefficient as a function of density is unbounded\nfrom above. In addition, for the large-N models, we prove the additivity\nprinciple under the assumption that the large deviation function has no\ndiscontinuous transitions.\n", "  We present key results from the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS):\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) and model fits of 330 young stellar\nobjects, predominantly protostars, in the Orion molecular clouds. This is the\nlargest sample of protostars studied in a single, nearby star-formation\ncomplex. With near-infrared photometry from 2MASS, mid- and far-infrared data\nfrom Spitzer and Herschel, and sub-millimeter photometry from APEX, our SEDs\ncover 1.2-870 $\\mu$m and sample the peak of the protostellar envelope emission\nat ~100 $\\mu$m. Using mid-IR spectral indices and bolometric temperatures, we\nclassify our sample into 92 Class 0 protostars, 125 Class I protostars, 102\nflat-spectrum sources, and 11 Class II pre-main-sequence stars. We implement a\nsimple protostellar model (including a disk in an infalling envelope with\noutflow cavities) to generate a grid of 30400 model SEDs and use it to\ndetermine the best-fit model parameters for each protostar. We argue that\nfar-IR data are essential for accurate constraints on protostellar envelope\nproperties. We find that most protostars, and in particular the flat-spectrum\nsources, are well-fit. The median envelope density and median inclination angle\ndecrease from Class 0 to Class I to flat-spectrum protostars, despite the broad\nrange in best-fit parameters in each of the three categories. We also discuss\ndegeneracies in our model parameters. Our results confirm that the different\nprotostellar classes generally correspond to an evolutionary sequence with a\ndecreasing envelope infall rate, but the inclination angle also plays a role in\nthe appearance, and thus interpretation, of the SEDs.\n", "  We investigate how controlling induced eddy currents in thin film\nferromagnet-normal metal (FM/NM) structures can be used to tailor the local\nmicrowave (MW) fields in ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments. The MW\nfields produced by eddy currents will in general have a relative phase shift\nwith respect to the applied MW field which depends on the sample geometry. The\ninduced fields can thus partially compensate the applied MW field, effectively\nscreening the FM in selected parts of the sample. The highly localized fields\nproduced by eddy currents enable the excitation of spin wave modes with\nnon-zero wave vectors, in contrast to the uniform k = 0 mode normally excited\nin FMR experiments. We find that the orientation of the applied MW field is one\nof the key parameters controlling the eddy-current effects. The induced\ncurrents are maximized when the applied MW field is oriented perpendicular to\nthe sample plane. Increasing the magnitude of the eddy currents results in a\nstronger induced MW field, enabling a more effective screening of the applied\nMW field as well as an enhanced excitation of spin wave modes. This\ninvestigation underlines that eddy currents can be used to control the\nmagnitude and phase of the local MW fields in thin film structures.\n", "  We investigate high-order harmonic generation in inhomogeneous media for\nreduced dimensionality models. We perform a phase-space analysis, in which we\nidentify specific features caused by the field inhomogeneity. We compute\nhigh-order harmonic spectra using the numerical solution of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, and provide an interpretation in terms of classical\nelectron trajectories. We show that the dynamics of the system can be described\nby the interplay of high-frequency and slow-frequency oscillations, which are\ngiven by Mathieu's equations. The latter oscillations lead to an increase in\nthe cutoff energy, and, for small values of the inhomogeneity parameter, take\nplace over many driving-field cycles. In this case, the two processes can be\ndecoupled and the oscillations can be described analytically.\n", "  We study the optimal packing of short, hard spherocylinders confined to lie\ntangential to a spherical surface, using simulated annealing and molecular\ndynamics simulations. For clusters of up to twelve particles, we map out the\nchanges in the geometry of the closest-packed configuration as a function of\nthe aspect ratio $L/D$, where $L$ is the cylinder length and $D$ the diameter\nof the rods. We find a rich variety of cluster structures. For larger clusters,\nwe find that the best-packed configurations up to around 100 particles are\nhighly dependent on the exact number of particles and aspect ratio. For even\nlarger clusters, we find largely disordered clusters for very short rods ($L/D\n= 0.25$), while slightly longer rods ($L/D = 0.5$ or $1$) prefer a global\nbaseball-like geometry of smectic-like domains, similar to the behavior of\nlarge-scale nematic shells. Our results provide predictions for experimentally\nrealizable systems of colloidal rods trapped at the interface of emulsion\ndroplets.\n", "  We propose an NMSSM scenario that can explain the excess in the diphoton\nspectrum at 750 GeV recently observed by ATLAS and CMS. We show that in a\ncertain limit with a very light pseudoscalar one can reproduce the experimental\nresults without invoking exotic matter. The 750 GeV excess is produced by two\nresonant heavy Higgs bosons with masses ~750 GeV, that subsequently decay to\ntwo light pseudoscalars. Each of these decays to collimated photon pairs that\nappear as a single photon in the electromagnetic calorimeter. A mass gap\nbetween heavy Higgses mimics a large width of the 750 GeV peak. The production\nmechanism, containing a strong component via initial b quarks, ameliorates a\npossible tension with 8 TeV data compared to other production modes. We also\ndiscuss other constraints, in particular from low energy experiments. Finally,\nwe discuss possible methods that could distinguish our proposal from other\nphysics models describing the diphoton excess in the Run-II of the LHC.\n", "  We investigate stochastic particle acceleration in accretion flows. It is\nbelieved that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) generates turbulence\ninside accretion flows and that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated by the\nturbulence. We calculate equations of motion for CRs in the turbulent fields\ngenerated by MRI with the shearing box approximation without back reaction to\nthe field. The results show that the CRs randomly gain or lose their energies\nthrough the interaction with the turbulent fields. The CRs diffuse in the\nconfiguration space anisotropically: The diffusion coefficient in direction of\nthe unperturbed flow is about twenty times higher than the Bohm coefficient,\nwhile those in the other directions are only a few times higher than the Bohm.\nThe momentum distribution is isotropic, and its evolution can be described by\nthe diffusion equation in momentum space where the diffusion coefficient is a\npower-law function of the CR momentum. We show that the shear acceleration\nefficiently works for energetic particles. We also cautiously note that in the\nshearing box approximation, particles that cross the simulation box many times\nalong the radial direction suffer unphysical runaway acceleration by the\nLorentz transformation, which needs to be taken with special care.\n", "  Non-thermal radiation has been predicted within bow shocks around runaway\nstars by recent theoretical works. We present X-ray observations towards the\nrunaway stars $\\zeta$ Oph (Chandra and Suzaku) and BD+43$^{\\circ}$3654\n(XMM-Newton) to search for the presence of non-thermal X-ray emission. We found\nno evidence of non-thermal emission spatially coincident with the bow shocks,\nnonetheless, diffuse emission is detected in the vicinity of $\\zeta$ Oph. After\na careful analysis of its spectral characteristics we conclude that this\nemission has a thermal nature with a plasma temperature of $T \\approx 2\n\\times10^{6}$ K. The cometary shape of this emission seems to be in line with\nrecent predictions of radiation-hydrodynamic models of runaway stars. The case\nof BD+43$^{\\circ}$3654 is puzzling as non-thermal emission has been reported in\na previous work for this source.\n", "  The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015\nthe state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path\nchallenges for reaching 10 cm/s measurement precision. The presentations and\ndiscussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop\nrecommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here.\n  Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision\nradial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable\ninstruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to\nproduce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved\nenvironmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the\nspectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and\nbroader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision\nradial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian\nmotion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric\ncontamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also\nrequires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques.\nCenter of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line\nidentically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries\nwith wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian\nsignals.\n  Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an\nimpressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial\nvelocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for\npotentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit\nmissions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories\ndepending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler\nmeasurements.\n", "  We report direction dependent luminescence (DDL), i.e., the asymmetry in the\nluminescence intensity between the opposite directions of the emission, in\nmultiferroic CuB2O4. Although it is well known that the optical constants can\nchange with the reversal of the propagation direction of light in multiferroic\nmaterials, the largest asymmetry in the luminescence intensity was 0.5 % so\nfar. We have performed a measurement of photoluminescence with a He-Ne laser\nirradiation (633 nm). The luminescence intensity changes by about 70 % with the\nreversal of the magnetic field due to the interference between the electric\ndipole and magnetic dipole transitions. We also demonstrate the imaging of the\ncanted antiferromagnetic domain structure of (Cu,Ni)B2O4 by using the large\nDDL.\n", "  A colored heavy particle with sufficiently small width may form\nnon-relativistic bound states when they are produced at the large hadron\ncollider\\,(LHC), and they can annihilate into a diphoton final state. The\ninvariant mass of the diphoton would be around twice of the colored particle\nmass. In this paper, we study if such bound state can be responsible for the\n750 GeV diphoton excess reported by ATLAS and CMS. We found that the best-fit\nsignal cross section is obtained for the SU(2)$_L$ singlet colored fermion $X$\nwith $Y_X=4/3$. Having such an exotic hypercharge, the particle is expected to\ndecay through some higher dimensional operators, consistent with the small\nwidth assumption. The decay of $X$ may involve a stable particle $\\chi$, if\nboth $X$ and $\\chi$ are odd under some conserved $Z_2$ symmetry. In that case,\nthe particle $X$ suffers from the constraints of jets + missing $E_T$ searches\nby ATLAS and CMS at 8 TeV and 13 TeV. We found that such a scenario still\nsurvives if the mass difference between $X$ and $\\chi$ is above $\\sim$ 30 GeV\nfor $m_X \\sim 375$ GeV. Even assuming pair annihilation of $\\chi$ is small, the\nrelic density of $\\chi$ is small enough if the mass difference between $X$ and\n$\\chi$ is smaller than $\\sim$ 40 GeV.\n", "  We explore a $Z^\\prime$ boson coupled only with the Standard Model (SM)\nfermions ($Z^\\prime f\\bar{f}$) in the framework of Minimal Flavor Violation. We\nstudy its effects on the processes with lepton flavor violation $\\ell_j\\to\n\\ell_i\\ell_k\\bar{\\ell}_l$, $\\ell_j\\to\\ell_i\\gamma$, $\\mu^{-}N\\to e^- N$, quark\nflavor changing neutral currents $b\\to s \\ell^+\\ell^-$, neutral $B$ and $K$\nmeson mixing, and $e^+e^-\\to f\\bar{f}$ at the LEP experiment to constrain the\nparameter space of $Z^\\prime$ mass and couplings. We find that among those\nrelevant processes, $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, $\\mu\\to 3e$, $\\mu$-$e$ conversion and\n$e^+e^-\\to f\\bar{f}$ can put more stringent bounds on $Z^\\prime f\\bar{f}$\ncouplings normalized by $Z^\\prime$ mass. Its implications on various processes\nare obtained, such as $B$ and $K$ mixing and $B/K\\to M \\ell_1 \\bar\\ell_2$\ndecays. In addition, we also make analysis on $Z^\\prime$ signatures at the LHC\nwith $\\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV.\n", "  We introduce a two-ladder lattice model with interacting Majorana fermions\nthat could be realized on the surfaces of a topological insulator film. We\nstudy this model by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques and\nfind a phase diagram that features both gapless and gapped phases as well as\ninteresting phase transitions including a quantum critical point in the\ntricritical Ising (TCI) universality class. The latter occurs at an\nintermediate coupling strength at a meeting point of a first-order transition\nline and an Ising critical line and is known to be described by a\nsuperconformal field theory with central charge $c =\\frac{7}{10}$. We discuss\nthe experimental feasibility of constructing the model and tuning parameters to\nthe vicinity of the TCI point where signatures of the elusive supersymmetry can\nbe observed.\n", "  The years of 1960-1965 were a remarkable period for Yoichiro Nambu. Starting\nwith a reformulation of BCS theory with emphasis on gauge invariance, he\nrecognized the realization of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in particle\nphysics as is evidenced by the Goldberger-Treiman relation. A concrete model of\nNambu and Jona-Lasinio illustrated the essence of the Nambu-Goldstone theorem\nand the idea of soft pions. After the proposal of the quark model by Gell-Mann,\nhe together with Han constructed an alternative model of integrally charged\nquarks with possible non-Abelian gluons. All those remarkable works were\nperformed during the years 1960-1965. Here I briefly review those works\nfollowing the original papers of Nambu chronologically, together with a brief\nintroduction to a formulation of Neother's theorem and Ward-Takahashi\nidentities using path integrals. This article is mostly based on a lecture\ngiven at the Nambu Memorial Symposium held at Osaka City University in\nSeptember 2015, where Nambu started his professional career.\n", "  We study the effects of $\\delta$-function periodic kicks on the Floquet\nenergy-momentum dispersion in graphene. We find that a rich variety of\ndispersions can appear depending on the parameters of the kicking: at certain\npoints in the Brillouin zone, the dispersion can become linear but anisotropic,\nlinear in one direction and quadratic in the perpendicular direction, gapped\nwith a quadratic dispersion, or completely flat (called dynamical\nlocalization). We show all these results analytically and demonstrate them\nnumerically through the dynamics of wave packets propagating in graphene. We\npropose experimental methods for producing these effects.\n", "  The lack of arm tracers, especially the remote tracers, is one of the most\ndifficult problems preventing us from studying the structure of the Milky Way.\nFortunately, with its high-sensitivity CO survey, the Milky Way Imaging Scroll\nPainting (MWISP) project offers such an opportunity. Since completing about\none-third of its mission, an area of l=[100,150] deg, b=[-3,5] deg has nearly\nbeen covered. The Outer arm of the Milky Way first clearly revealed its shape\nin the second galactic quadrant in the form of molecular gas --- this is the\nfirst time that the Outer arm has been reported in such a large-scale mapping\nof molecular gas. Using the 115 GHz 12CO(1-0) data of MWISP at the LSR velocity\n~= [-100,-60] km s^-1 and in the area mentioned above, we have detected 481\nmolecular clouds in total, and among them 332 (about 69\\%) are newly detected\nand 457 probably belong to the Outer arm. The total mass of the detected Outer\narm clouds is ~ 3.1*10^6 M_sun. Assuming that the spiral arm is a logarithmic\nspiral, the pitch angle is fitted as ~ 13.1 deg. Besides combining both the CO\ndata from MWISP and the 21 cm HI data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey\n(CGPS), the gas distribution, warp, and thickness of the Outer arm are also\nstudied.\n", "  The Starobinsky model is one of the inflation models consistent with the\nresult of CMB observation by the Planck satellite. We consider the dynamics of\nthe Starobinsky inflation in the presence of another scalar field with a large\nexpectation value during inflation due to a negative Hubble-induced mass. We\nfind that it would be affected if the other field has an amplitude close to the\nPlanck scale. In this case, we may observe such effects on the Starobinsky\nmodel by future CMB experiments.\n", "  Recently it has been pointed out that a cosmic background of relativistic\naxion-like particles (ALPs) would be produced by the primordial decays of heavy\nfields in the post-inflation epoch, contributing to the extra-radiation content\nin the Universe today. Primordial magnetic fields would trigger conversions of\nthese ALPs into sub-MeV photons during the dark ages. This photon flux would\nproduce an early reionization of the Universe, leaving a significant imprint on\nthe total optical depth to recombination $\\tau$. Using the current measurement\nof $\\tau$ and the limit on the extra-radiation content $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} $ by\nthe Planck experiment we put a strong bound on the ALP-photon conversions.\nNamely we obtain upper limits on the product of the photon-ALP coupling\nconstant $g_{a\\gamma}$ times the magnetic field strength $B$ down to\n$g_{a\\gamma} B \\gtrsim 6 \\times 10^{-18} \\textrm{GeV}^{-1} \\textrm{nG} $ for\nultralight ALPs.\n", "  We disclose the effects of the logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics on the\nholographic conductivity of Lifshitz dilaton black holes/branes. We analyze\nthermodynamics of these solutions as a necessary requirement for applying\ngauge/gravity duality, by calculating conserved and thermodynamic quantities\nsuch as the temperature, entropy, electric potential and mass of the black\nholes/branes. We calculate the holographic conductivity for a\n$(2+1)$-dimensional brane boundary and study its behavior in terms of the\nfrequency per temperature. Interestingly enough, we find out that, in contrast\nto the Lifshitz-Maxwell-dilaton black branes which has conductivity for all\n$z$, here in the presence of nonlinear gauge field, the holographic\nconductivity do exist provided $z\\leq3$ and vanishes for $z>3$. It is shown\nthat independent of the nonlinear parameter $\\beta$, the real part of the\nconductivity is the same for a specific value of frequency per temperature in\nboth AdS and Lifshitz cases. Besides, the behavior of real part of conductivity\nfor large frequencies has a positive slope with respect to large frequencies\nfor a system with Lifshitz symmetry whereas it tends to a constant for a system\nwith AdS symmetry. This behavior may be interpreted as existence of an\nadditional charge carrier rather than the AdS case, and is due to the presence\nof the scalar dilaton field in model. Similar behavior for optical conductivity\nof single-layer graphene induced by mild oxygen plasma exposure has been\nreported.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy-release process in laboratory,\nspace and astrophysical plasmas. While magnetic fields can `break' and\n`reconnect' in a very small region called the electron diffusion region (EDR),\nthere have been conflicting theories as to whether this region can be a place\nof rapid energization of plasmas. Here we report a fortuitous encounter of the\nEDR by THEMIS in the Earth's magnetotail where significant heating and\ndemagnetization of electrons were observed. Additional energization was\nobserved on both sides (immediate upstream and downstream) of the EDR, leading\nto a total of more than an order of magnitude energization across this region.\nThe results demonstrate that, despite its minuscule size, the EDR does indeed\ncontribute to the overall process of electron energization via magnetic\nreconnection.\n", "  Galactic cosmic rays (CR) are particles presumably accelerated in supernova\nremnant shocks that propagate in the interstellar medium up to the densest\nparts of molecular clouds, losing energy and their ionisation efficiency\nbecause of the presence of magnetic fields and collisions with molecular\nhydrogen. Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the\npresence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an\napparent contradiction. We want to explain the origin of these CRs accelerated\nwithin young protostars as suggested by observations. Our modelling consists of\na set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient CR\nacceleration through diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse three main\nacceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through\nthe protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can\nbe strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic\nenergies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where\nshocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough\nto accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to\nefficiently accelerate CRs. Though CR electrons are weakly accelerated, they\ncan gain a strong boost to relativistic energies through re-acceleration in\nsuccessive shocks. We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate both CR protons\nand electrons through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which can be\nused to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed\ntowards protostellar sources. The existence of an internal source of energetic\nparticles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the ionisation of the\nprotostellar disc, on the star and planet formation processes, and on the\nformation of pre-biotic molecules.\n", "  Motivated by the report of a possible new planetary member of the Solar\nSystem, this work calculates cross sections for interactions between passing\nstars and this proposed Planet Nine. Evidence for the new planet is provided by\nthe orbital alignment of Kuiper Belt objects, and other Solar System\nproperties, which suggest a Neptune-mass object on an eccentric orbit with\nsemimajor axis $a_9\\approx400-1500$ AU. With such a wide orbit, Planet Nine has\na large interaction cross section, and is susceptible to disruption by passing\nstars. Using a large ensemble of numerical simulations (several million), and\nMonte Carlo sampling, we calculate the cross sections for different classes of\norbit-altering events: [A] scattering the planet into its proposed orbit from a\nsmaller orbit, [B] ejecting it from the Solar System from its current orbit,\n[C] capturing the planet from another system, and [D] capturing a free-floating\nplanet. Results are presented for a range of orbital elements with planetary\nmass $m_9=10M_{earth}$. Removing Planet Nine from the Solar System is the most\nlikely outcome. Specifically, we obtain ejection cross sections\n$\\sigma_{int}\\sim5\\times10^6$ AU$^2$ ($5\\times10^4$ AU$^2$) for environments\ncorresponding to the birth cluster (field). With these cross sections, Planet\nNine is likely to be ejected if the Sun resides within its birth cluster longer\nthan $\\Delta{t} \\gtrsim 100$ Myr. The probability of ejecting Planet Nine due\nto passing field stars is $\\lesssim 3\\%$ over the age of the Sun. Probabilities\nfor producing the inferred Planet Nine orbit are low $(\\lesssim 5\\%)$.\n", "  Based on the Lema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric we consider two flat\ninhomogeneous big-bang models. We aim at clarifying, as far as possible\nanalytically, basic features of the dynamics of the simplest inhomogeneous\nmodels and to point out the potential usefulness of exact inhomogeneous\nsolutions as generalizations of the homogeneous configurations of the\ncosmological standard model. We discuss explicitly partial successes but also\npotential pitfalls of these simplest models. Although primarily seen as toy\nmodels, the relevant free parameters are fixed by best-fit values using the\nJoint Light-curve Analysis (JLA)-sample data. On the basis of a likelihood\nanalysis we find that a local hump with an extension of almost 2 Gpc provides a\nbetter description of the observations than a local void for which we obtain a\nbest-fit scale of about 30 Mpc. Future redshift-drift measurements are\ndiscussed as a promising tool to discriminate between inhomogeneous\nconfigurations and the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  The second Stokes problem about behavior of the viscous fluid (matter)\nfilling half-space is considered. A flat surface limiting half-space makes\nharmonious oscillations in the eigen plane. The equations of mechanics of the\ncontinuous environment are used. It is shown, that in considered process there\nis the temperature difference between temperature of a surface and temperature\nenvironments far from a surface. Usually similar difference is called as\ntemperature jump. The method of small parameter is applied. Temperature jump in\nthe second approach is found out.\n", "  We present and interpret the observations of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves\nassociated with a filament eruption on 2011 May 11.The filament eruption also\nproduces a small B-class two ribbon flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME).\nThe event is observed by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) with high\nspatio-temporal resolution data recorded by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA).\nAs the filament erupts, we observe two types of EUV waves (slow and fast)\npropagating outwards. The faster EUV wave has a propagation velocity of ~ 500\nkm/s and the slower EUV wave has an initial velocity of ~ 120 km/s. We report\nfor the first time that not only the slower EUV wave stops at a magnetic\nseparatrix to form bright stationary fronts, but also the faster EUV wave\ntransits a magnetic separatrix, leaving another stationary EUV front behind.\n", "  Synchrotron emission and absorption determine the observational appearance of\nmany astronomical systems. In this paper, we describe a numerical scheme for\ncalculating synchrotron emissivities and absorptivities in all four Stokes\nparameters for arbitrary gyrotropic electron distribution functions, building\non earlier work by Leung, Gammie, and Noble. We use this technique to evaluate\nthe emissivities and the absorptivities for a thermal (Maxwell-J\\\"uttner),\nisotropic power-law, and isotropic kappa distribution function. The latter\ncontains a power-law tail at high particle energies that smoothly merges with a\nthermal core at low energies, as is characteristic of observed particle spectra\nin collisionless plasmas. We provide fitting formulae and error bounds on the\nfitting formulae for use in codes that solve the radiative transfer equation.\nThe numerical method and the fitting formulae are implemented in a compact C\nlibrary called ${\\tt symphony}$. We find that: the kappa distribution has a\nsource function that is indistinguishable from a thermal spectrum at low\nfrequencies and transitions to the characteristic self-absorbed synchrotron\nspectrum, $\\propto \\nu^{5/2}$, at high frequency; the linear polarization\nfraction for a thermal spectrum is near unity at high frequency; and all\ndistributions produce $O(10\\%)$ circular polarization at low frequency for\nlines of sight sufficiently close to the magnetic field vector.\n", "  We examine a regime in which a linearly-polarized laser pulse with\nrelativistic intensity irradiates a sub-critical plasma for much longer than\nthe characteristic electron response time. A steady-state channel is formed in\nthe plasma in this case with quasi-static transverse and longitudinal electric\nfields. These relatively weak fields significantly alter the electron dynamics.\nThe longitudinal electric field reduces the longitudinal dephasing between the\nelectron and the wave, leading to an enhancement of the electron energy gain\nfrom the pulse. The energy gain in this regime is ultimately limited by the\nsuperluminosity of the wave fronts induced by the plasma in the channel. The\ntransverse electric field alters the oscillations of the transverse electron\nvelocity, allowing it to remain anti-parallel to laser electric field and\nleading to a significant energy gain. The energy enhancement is accompanied by\ndevelopment of significant oscillations perpendicular to the plane of the\ndriven motion, making trajectories of energetic electrons three-dimensional.\nProper electron injection into the laser beam can further boost the electron\nenergy gain.\n", "  We calculate the neutral pion photoproduction on the proton near threshold in\ncovariant baryon chiral perturbation theory, including the $\\Delta(1232)$\nresonance as an explicit degree of freedom, up to chiral order $p^{7/2}$ in the\n$\\delta$ counting. We compare our results with recent low-energy data from the\nMainz Microtron for angular distributions and photon asymmetries. The\nconvergence of the chiral series of the covariant approach is found to improve\nsubstantially with the inclusion of the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance.\n", "  In this article we study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for quark\nmatter in the background of static and homogeneous parallel electric field $\\bm\nE$ and magnetic field $\\bm B$. We use a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with a local\nkernel interaction to compute the relevant quantities to describe chiral\nsymmetry breaking at finite temperature for a wide range of $E$ and $B$. We\nstudy the effect of this background on inverse catalysis of chiral symmetry\nbreaking for $E$ and $B$ of the same order of magnitude. We then focus on the\neffect of equilibration of chiral density, $n_5$, produced dynamically by axial\nanomaly on the critical temperature. The equilibration of $n_5$, a consequence\nof chirality flipping processes in the thermal bath, allows for the\nintroduction of the chiral chemical potential, $\\mu_5$, which is computed\nself-consistently as a function of temperature and field strength by coupling\nthe number equation to the gap equation, and solving the two within an\nexpansion in $E/T^2$, $B/T^2$ and $\\mu_5^2/T^2$. We find that even if chirality\nis produced and equilibrates within a relaxation time $\\tau_M$, it does not\nchange drastically the thermodynamics, with particular reference to the inverse\ncatalysis induced by the external fields, as long as the average $\\mu_5$ at\nequilibrium is not too large.\n", "  Busch, Lahti and Werner (BLW) have recently criticized the operator approach\nto the description of quantum errors and disturbances. Their criticisms are\njustified to the extent that the physical meaning of the operator definitions\nhas not hitherto been adequately explained. We rectify that omission. We then\nexamine BLW's criticisms in the light of our analysis. We argue that, although\nthe approach BLW favour (based on the Wasserstein 2-deviation) has its uses,\nthere are important physical situations where an operator approach is\npreferable. We also discuss the reason why the error-disturbance relation is\nstill giving rise to controversies almost a century after Heisenberg first\nstated his microscope argument. We argue that the source of the difficulties is\nthe problem of interpretation, which is not so wholly disconnected from\nexperimental practicalities as is sometimes supposed.\n", "  Observations of 12CO(3-2) emission of the circumbinary envelope of Mira Ceti,\nmade by ALMA are analysed. The observed Doppler velocity distribution is made\nof three components: a blue-shifted south-eastern arc, which can be described\nas a ring in slow radial expansion, ~1.7 km/s, making an angle of ~50 deg with\nthe plane of the sky and born some 2000 years ago; a few arcs, probably born at\nthe same epoch as the blue-shifted arc, all sharing Doppler velocities\nred-shifted by approximately 3 +/- 2 km/s with respect to the main star; the\nthird, central region dominated by the circumbinary envelope, displaying two\noutflows in the south-western and north-eastern hemispheres. At short distances\nfrom the star, up to ~1.5\", these hemispheres display very different\nmorphologies: the south-western outflow covers a broad solid angle, expands\nradially at a rate between 5 and 10 km/s and is slightly red shifted; the\nnorth-eastern outflow consists of two arms, both blue-shifted, bracketing a\nbroad dark region where emission is suppressed. At distances between ~1.5\" and\n~2.5\" the asymmetry between the two hemispheres is significantly smaller and\ndetached arcs, particularly spectacular in the north-eastern hemisphere are\npresent. Close to the stars, we observe a mass of gas surrounding Mira B, with\na size of a few tens of AU, and having Doppler velocities with respect to Mira\nB reaching +/-1.5 km/s, which we interpret as gas flowing from Mira A toward\nMira B.\n", "  A well-known situation in which a non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum\nsystem $S$ arises is when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system $M$\nin contact with a Markovian bath. In such cases, while the joint dynamics of\n$S$-$M$ is Markovian and obeys a standard (bipartite) Lindblad-type master\nequation (ME), this is in general not true for the reduced dynamics of $S$.\nFurthermore, there are several instances (\\eg the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel) in which a {\\it closed} ME for the $S$'s state {\\it cannot} even be\nworked out. Here, we find a class of bipartite Lindblad-type MEs such that the\nreduced ME of $S$ can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any initial\nproduct state of $S$-$M$. We provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our\nresult in terms of a mapping between two collision models\n", "  We investigate a hybrid metallic island / single dopant electron pump based\non fully-depleted silicon on insulator technology. Electron transfer between\nthe central metallic island and the leads is controlled by resonant tunneling\nthrough single phosphorus dopants in the barriers. Top gates above the barriers\nare used control the resonance conditions. Applying radio frequency signals to\nthe gates, non-adiabatic quantized electron pumping is achieved. A simple\ndeterministic model is presented and confirmed by comparing measurements with\nsimulations.\n", "  A new concept realizing giant spin Nernst effect in nonmagnetic metallic\nfilms is introduced. It is based on the idea of engineering an asymmetric\nenergy dependence of the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities,\nas well as a pronounced energy dependence of the spin Hall angle in the\nvicinity of the Fermi level by the resonant impurity states at the Fermi level.\nWe employ an analytical model and demonstrate the emergence of a giant spin\nNernst effect in Ag(111) films using {\\it ab-initio} calculations combined with\nthe Boltzmann approach for transport properties arising from skew scattering\noff impurities.\n", "  Recent data collected by ATLAS and CMS at 13 TeV collision energy of the LHC\nindicate the existence of a new resonant state $\\phi$ with a mass of 750 GeV\ndecaying into two photons $\\gamma\\gamma$. The properties of $\\phi$ should be\nstudied further at the LHC and also future colliders. Since only $\\phi \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$ decay channel has been measured, one of the best ways to extract\nmore information about $\\phi$ is to use a $\\gamma\\gamma$ collider to produce\n$\\phi$ at the resonant energy. In this work we show how a $\\gamma\\gamma$\ncollider helps to verify the existence of $\\phi$ and to provide some of the\nmost important information about the properties of $\\phi$, such as branching\nfractions of $\\phi\\to V_1V_2$. Here $V_i$ can be $\\gamma$, $Z$, or $W^\\pm$. We\nalso show that by studying angular distributions of the final $\\gamma$'s in\n$\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\phi \\to \\gamma\\gamma$, one can obtain crucial information\nabout whether this state is a spin-0 or a spin-2 state.\n", "  Cd(Se,Te) Quantum Dots (QD) in ZnSe barrier typically exhibit a very high\nspectral density, which precludes investigation of single dot\nphotoluminescence. We design, grow and study individual Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs of\nlow spectral density of emission lines achieved by implementation of a\nMn-assisted epitaxial growth. We find an unusually large variation of\nexciton-biexciton energy difference (3 meV $\\leq$ $\\Delta \\mathrm{E_{X-XX}}$\n$\\leq$ 26 meV) and of exciton radiative recombination rate in the statistics of\nQDs. We observe a strong correlation between the exciton-biexciton energy\ndifference, exciton recombination rate, splitting between dark and bright\nexciton, and additionally the exciton fine structure splitting $\\delta_1$ and\nLand\\'e factor. Above results indicate that values of the $\\delta_1$ and of the\nLand\\'e factor in the studied QDs are dictated primarily by the electron and\nhole respective spatial shift and wavefunctions overlap, which vary from dot to\ndot due to a different degree of localization of electrons and holes in,\nrespectively, CdSe and CdTe rich QD regions.\n", "  In a prior paper (Kim et al. 2015) we considered the linear stability of\nmagnetized jets that carry no net electric current and do not have current\nsheets. In this paper, in addition to physically well-motivated magnetic field\nstructures, we also include the effects of jet shear. The jets we study have\nfinite thermal pressure in addition to having realistic magnetic field\nstructures and velocity shear. We find that shear has a strongly stabilizing\neffect on various modes of jet instability. Increasing shear stabilizes the\nfundamental pinch modes at long wavelengths and short wavelengths. Increasing\nshear also stabilizes the first reflection pinch modes at short wavelengths.\nIncreasing shear has only a very modest stabilizing effect on the fundamental\nkink modes at long wavelengths; however, increasing shear does have a strong\nstabilizing effect on the fundamental kink modes at short wavelengths. The\nfirst reflection kink modes are strongly stabilized by increasing shear at\nshorter wavelengths. Overall, we find that the combined effect of magnetic\nfield and shear stabilizes jets more than shear alone. In addition to the\nresults from a formal linear stability analysis, we present a novel way of\nvisualizing and understanding jet stability. This gives us a deeper\nunderstanding of the enhanced stability of sheared, magnetized jets. We also\nemphasize the value of our numerical approach in understanding the linear\nstability of jets with realistic structure.\n", "  In this paper the duality correspondence between fermion-antifermion and\ndifermion interaction channels is established in two (2+1)-dimensional\nGross-Neveu type models with a fermion number chemical potential $\\mu$ and a\nchiral chemical potential $\\mu_5$. The role and influence of this property on\nthe phase structure of the models are investigated. In particular, it is shown\nthat the chemical potential $\\mu_5$ promotes the appearance of dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking, whereas the chemical potential $\\mu$ contributes to the\nemergence of superconductivity.\n", "  As the closest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades is an important benchmark\nfor many stellar properties, but its members are also scattered widely over the\nsky. Previous studies of stellar rotation in the Hyades relied on targeted\nobservations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability\nsurveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the first opportunity to\nmeasure rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for many Hyads simultaneously while also\nbeing sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members. We analyze K2 data for 65\nHyads and present $P_{rot}$ values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new\nmeasurements, including the first $P_{rot}$ measurements for fully convective\nHyads. For nine of the 11 stars with $P_{rot}$ in the literature and this work,\nthe measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot\nevolution. Nearly all stars with masses $\\le0.3M_\\odot$ are rapidly rotating,\nindicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection.\nWhen confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane,\nonly three rapid rotators with masses $\\ge0.3M_\\odot$ remain. This is in\ncontrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period\nsequence for $\\approx$600 Myr-old stars ends at $\\approx0.65M_\\odot$ when\nbinaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict\nfaster rotation than is actually observed at $\\approx$600 Myrs for stars\n$\\le0.9M_\\odot$. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than\n$\\approx0.3M_\\odot$ indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than\npreviously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for\nmultiplicity.\n", "  Intense and purified radioactive beam of post-accelerated $^{14}$O was used\nto study the low-lying states in the unbound $^{15}$F nucleus. Exploiting\nresonant elastic scattering in inverse kinematics with a thick target, the\nsecond excited state, a resonance at E$\\_R$=4.757(6)(10)~MeV with a width of\n$\\Gamma$=36(5)(14)~keV was measured for the first time with high precision. The\nstructure of this narrow above-barrier state in a nucleus located two neutrons\nbeyond the proton drip line was investigated using the Gamow Shell Model in the\ncoupled channel representation with a $^{12}$C core and three valence protons.\nIt is found that it is an almost pure wave function of two quasi-bound protons\nin the $2s\\_{1/2}$ shell.\n", "  We examine FUV images of the LITTLE THINGS sample of nearby dwarf irregular\n(dIrr) and Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies to identify distinct young regions\nin their far outer disks. We use these data, obtained with the Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer satellite, to determine the furthest radius at which in situ star\nformation can currently be identified. The FUV knots are found at distances\nfrom the center of the galaxies of 1 to 8 disk scale lengths and have ages of\n<20 Myrs and masses of 20 to 1E5 Msolar. The presence of young clusters and OB\nassociations in the outer disks of dwarf galaxies shows that dIrrs do have star\nformation taking place there in spite of the extreme nature of the environment.\nMost regions are found where the HI surface density is ~1 Msolar per pc2,\nalthough both the HI and dispersed old stars go out much further. This limiting\ndensity suggests a cutoff in the ability to form distinct OB associations and\nperhaps even stars. We compare the star formation rates in the FUV regions to\nthe average rates expected at their radii and beyond from the observed gas,\nusing the conventional correlation for gas-rich regions. The localized rates\nare typically 10% of the expected average rates for the outer disks. Either\nstar formation in dIrrs at surface densities <1 Msolar per pc2 occurs without\nforming distinct associations, or the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation over-predicts\nthe rate beyond this point. In the latter case, the stellar disks in the\nfar-outer parts of dIrrs result from scattering of stars from the inner disk.\n", "  We investigate how the dimensionless ratio given by the Chern-Simons\ndiffusion rate $\\Gamma_{\\textrm{CS}}$ divided by the product of the entropy\ndensity $s$ and temperature $T$ behaves across different kinds of phase\ntransitions in the class of bottom-up non-conformal Einstein-dilaton\nholographic models originally proposed by Gubser and Nellore. By tuning the\ndilaton potential, one is able to holographically mimic a first order, a second\norder, or a crossover transition. In a first order phase transition,\n$\\Gamma_{\\textrm{CS}}/sT$ jumps at the critical temperature (as previously\nfound in the holographic literature), while in a second order phase transition\nit develops an infinite slope. On the other hand, in a crossover,\n$\\Gamma_{\\textrm{CS}}/sT$ behaves smoothly, although displaying a fast\nvariation around the pseudo-critical temperature. In all the cases,\n$\\Gamma_{\\textrm{CS}}/sT$ increases with decreasing $T$. The behavior of the\nChern-Simons diffusion rate across different phase transitions is expected to\nplay a relevant role for the chiral magnetic effect around the QCD critical end\npoint, which is a second order phase transition point connecting a crossover\nband to a line of first order phase transition. Our findings in the present\nwork add to the literature the first predictions for the Chern-Simons diffusion\nrate across second order and crossover transitions in strongly coupled\nnon-conformal, non-Abelian gauge theories.\n", "  Nickel-based superalloys play a major role in many technologically relevant\nhigh temperature applications. Understanding and predicting the evolution of\nthe phase microstructure during high temperature creep together with the\nevolution of the dislocation microstructure is a challenge that up to date has\nnot yet been fully accomplished. Our two-dimensional coupled\nphase-field/continuum dislocation dynamics model explains microstructural\nmechanisms which are important during the early stage of rafting in a single\ncrystal system. It shows how $\\gamma/\\gamma'$ phases and dislocations interact\ngiving rise to realistic creep behavior; no phenomenological fit parameters are\nrequired.\n", "  We explore in this paper the phenomenon of photofocusing: a coupling between\nflow vorticity and biased swimming of microalgae toward a light source that\nproduces a focusing of the microswimmer suspension. We combine experiments that\ninvestigate the stationary state of this phenomenon as well as the transition\nregime with analytical and numerical modeling. We show that the experimentally\nobserved scalings on the width of the focalized region and the establishment\nlength as a function of the flow velocity are well described by a simple\ntheoretical model.\n", "  Using numerical simulations of two-photon electronic absorption with\nfemtosecond pulses in Na$_2$ we show that: i) it is possible to avoid the\ncharacteristic saturation or dumped Rabi oscillations in the yield of\nabsorption by time-delaying the laser pulses; ii) it is possible to accelerate\nthe onset of adiabatic passage by using the vibrational coherence starting in a\nwave packet; and iii) it is possible to prepare the initial wave packet in\norder to achieve full state-selective transitions with broadband pulses. The\nfindings can be used, for instance, to achieve ultrafast adiabatic passage by\nlight-induced potentials and understand its intrinsic robustness.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to characterize the radial structure of the star\nformation rate (SFR) in galaxies in the nearby Universe as represented by the\nCALIFA survey. The sample under study contains 416 galaxies observed with IFS,\ncovering a wide range of Hubble types and stellar masses. Spectral synthesis\ntechniques are applied to obtain radial profiles of the intensity of the star\nformation rate in the recent past, and the local sSFR. To emphasize the\nbehavior of these properties for galaxies that are on and off the main sequence\nof star formation (MSSF) we stack the individual radial profiles in bins of\ngalaxy morphology and stellar masses. Our main results are: a) The intensity of\nSFR shows declining profiles that exhibit very little differences between\nspirals. The dispersion between the profiles is significantly smaller in late\ntype spirals. This confirms that the MSSF is a sequence of galaxies with nearly\nconstant intensity of SFR b) sSFR values scale with Hubble type and increase\nradially outwards, with a steeper slope in the inner 1 HLR. This behavior\nsuggests that galaxies are quenched inside-out, and that this process is faster\nin the central, bulge-dominated part than in the disks. c) As a whole, and at\nall radii, E and S0 are off the MSSF. d) Applying the volume-corrections for\nthe CALIFA sample, we obtain a density of star formation in the local Universe\nof 0.0105 Msun/yr/Mpc^{-3}. Most of the star formation is occurring in the\ndisks of spirals. e) The volume averaged birthrate parameter, b'=0.39, suggests\nthat the present day Universe is forming stars at 1/3 of its past average rate.\nE, S0, and the bulge of early type spirals contribute little to the recent SFR\nof the Universe, which is dominated by the disks of later spirals. f) There is\na tight relation between the intensity of the SFR and stellar mass, defining a\nlocal MSSF relation with a logarithmic slope of 0.8.\n", "  We study the entanglement spectrum in the many body localizing and\nthermalizing phases of one and two dimensional Hamiltonian systems, and\nperiodically driven `Floquet' systems. We focus on the level statistics of the\nentanglement spectrum as obtained through numerical diagonalization, finding\nstructure beyond that revealed by more limited measures such as entanglement\nentropy. In the thermalizing phase the entanglement spectrum obeys level\nstatistics governed by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. For Hamiltonian\nsystems this can be viewed as evidence in favor of a strong version of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Similar results are also obtained\nfor Floquet systems, where they constitute a result `beyond ETH', and show that\nthe corrections to ETH governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum have\nstatistical properties governed by a random matrix ensemble. The particular\nrandom matrix ensemble governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum depends on\nthe symmetries of the Floquet drive, and therefore can depend on the choice of\norigin of time. In the many body localized phase the entanglement spectrum is\nalso found to show level repulsion, following a semi-Poisson distribution (in\ncontrast to the energy spectrum, which follows a Poisson distribution). This\nsemi-Poisson distribution is found to come mainly from states at high\nentanglement energies. The observed level repulsion only occurs for interacting\nlocalized phases. We also demonstrate that equivalent results can be obtained\nby calculating with a single typical eigenstate, or by averaging over a\nmicrocanonical energy window - a surprising result in the localized phase. This\ndiscovery of new structure in the pattern of entanglement of localized and\nthermalizing phases may open up new lines of attack on many body localization,\nthermalization, and the localization transition.\n", "  The framework of locally covariant quantum field theory, an axiomatic\napproach to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is reviewed. As a\nspecific focus, the connection between spin and statistics is examined in this\ncontext. A new approach is given, which allows for a more operational\ndescription of theories with spin and for the derivation of a more general\nversion of the spin-statistics connection in curved spacetimes than previously\navailable. This part of the text is based on arXiv:1503.05797 and a forthcoming\npublication; the emphasis here is on the fundamental ideas and motivation.\n", "  The temperature and density profiles of protoplanetary discs depend crucially\non the mass fraction of micrometre-sized dust grains and on their chemical\ncomposition. A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall\nheating of the disc, so that the water ice line moves further away from the\nstar. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed\ndust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and\nlowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate\nfraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust\ncomposition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for\nplanets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger\nwater content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc\nevolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can\nthus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.\nOur results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys\ncould have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction\nin water. These water-rich super-Earths should orbit primarily around stars\nwith a low oxygen abundance, where a low oxygen abundance is caused by either a\nlow water-to-silicate ratio or by overall low metallicity.\n", "  We present 15 new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-43b in the\n$i'$,$g'$, and $R$ filters with the 1.0-m telescopes of Las Cumbres Observatory\nGlobal Telescope (LCOGT) Network and the IAC80 telescope. We combine our 15 new\nlight curves with 52 others from literature, to analyze homogeneously all the\navailable transit light curves of this exoplanet. By extending the time span of\nthe monitoring of the transits to more than $5~yr$, and by analyzing the\nindividual mid-times of 72 transits, we study the proposed shortening of the\norbital period of WASP-43b. We estimate that the times of transit are\nwell-matched by our updated ephemeris equation, using a constant orbital\nperiod. We estimate an orbital period change rate no larger than $\\dot{P}=-0.02\n\\pm 6.6~ms~yr^{-1}$, which is fully consistent with a constant period. Based on\nthe timing analysis, we discard stellar tidal dissipation factors\n$Q_{*}<10^{5}$. In addition, with the modelling of the transits we update the\nsystem parameters: $a/Rs=4.867(23)$, $i=82.11(10)^{\\circ}$ and\n$R_p/R_s=0.15942(41)$, noticing a difference in the relative size of the planet\nbetween optical and NIR bands.\n", "  HESS J1943+213 is an unidentified TeV source that is likely a\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) object but also compatible with a pulsar\nwind nebula (PWN) nature. Each of these enormously different astronomical\ninterpretations is supported by some of the observed unusual characteristics.\nIn order to finally classify and understand this object we took a three-pronged\napproach, through time-domain, high angular resolution, and multi-frequency\nradio studies. First, our deep time-domain observations with the Arecibo\ntelescope failed to uncover the putative pulsar powering the proposed PWN. We\nconclude with ~70% certainty that HESS J1943+213 does not host a pulsar.\nSecond, long-baseline interferometry of the source with e-MERLIN at 1.5- and 5-\nGHz, shows only a core, a point source at ~ 1 - 100 milli-arcsecond resolution.\nIts 2013 flux density is about one-third lower than detected in 2011\nobservations with similar resolution. This radio variability of the core\nstrengthens the HBL object hypothesis. More evidence against the PWN scenario\ncomes, third, from the radio spectrum we compiled. The extended structure\nfollows a power-law behavior with spectral index alpha = -0.54 +- 0.04 while\nthe core component is flat spectrum (alpha = -0.03 +- 0.03). In contrast, the\nradio synchrotron emission of PWNe predicts a single power-law distribution.\nOverall we rule out the PWN hypothesis and conclude the source is a BL Lac\nobject. The consistently high fraction (70%) of the flux density from the\nextended structure then leads us to conclude that HESS J1943+213 must be a\nnon-classical HBL object.\n", "  Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are often invoked to\nplay a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining the\ntight SMBH-galaxy relations. A strong support of this \"quasar mode\" feedback\ncame from the recent X-ray observation of a mildly relativistic accretion disk\nwind in a ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) and its connection with a\nlarge-scale molecular outflow, providing a direct link between the SMBH and the\ngas out of which stars form. Spectroscopic observations, especially in the\nX-ray band, show that such accretion disk winds may be common in local AGN and\nquasars. However, their origin and characteristics are still not fully\nunderstood. Detailed theoretical models and simulations focused on radiation,\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or a combination of these two processes to\ninvestigate the possible acceleration mechanisms and the dynamics of these\nwinds. Some of these models have been directly compared to X-ray spectra,\nproviding important insights into the wind physics. However, fundamental\nimprovements on these studies will come only from the unprecedented energy\nresolution and sensitivity of the upcoming X-ray observatories, namely ASTRO-H\n(launch date early 2016) and Athena (2028).\n", "  The use of simplified models as a tool for interpreting dark matter collider\nsearches has become increasingly prevalent, and while early Run II results are\nbeginning to appear, we look to see what further information can be extracted\nfrom the Run I dataset. We consider three `standard' simplified models that\ncouple quarks to fermionic singlet dark matter: an $s$-channel vector mediator\nwith vector or axial-vector couplings, and a $t$-channel scalar mediator. Upper\nlimits on the couplings are calculated and compared across three alternate\nchannels, namely mono-jet, mono-$Z$ (leptonic) and mono-$W/Z$ (hadronic). The\nstrongest limits are observed in the mono-jet channel, however the\ncomputational simplicity and absence of significant $t$-channel model width\neffects in the mono-boson channels make these a straightforward and competitive\nalternative. We also include a comparison with relic density and direct\ndetection constraints.\n", "  Dark photons $\\bar \\gamma$ mediating long-range forces in a dark sector are\npredicted by various new physics scenarios, and are being intensively searched\nfor in experiments. We extend a previous study of a new discovery process for\ndark photons proceedings via Higgs-boson production at the LHC. Thanks to the\nnon-decoupling properties of the Higgs boson, BR($H\\to \\gamma\\bar \\gamma$)\nvalues up to a few percent are possible for a massless dark photon, even for\nheavy dark-sector scenarios. The corresponding signature consists (for a Higgs\nboson at rest) of a striking monochromatic photon with energy $E_{\\gamma}=\nm_H/2$, and similar amount of missing energy. We perform a model independent\nanalysis at the LHC of both the gluon-fusion and VBF Higgs production\nmechanisms at 14 TeV, including parton-shower effects, and updating our\nprevious parton-level analysis at 8 TeV in the gluon-fusion channel by a more\nrealistic background modeling. We find that a $5\\sigma$ sensitivity can be\nreached in the gluon-fusion channel for BR($H\\to \\gamma\\bar\n\\gamma)\\simeq\\,$0.1% with an integrated luminosity of $L\\simeq 300\\, {\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$. The corresponding VBF reach is instead restricted to 1%. Such decay\nrates can be naturally obtained in dark-photon scenarios arising from unbroken\n$U(1)_F$ models explaining the origin and hierarchy of the Yukawa couplings,\nstrongly motivating the search for this exotic Higgs decay at the LHC.\n", "  The first theoretical investigation on the inner-shell single-photodetachment\nfrom the Si- negative ion is presented. The partial and total cross sections,\nthe photoelectron phaseshifts, and the parameters of angular anisotropy are\ncalculated in the framework of Many-Body Theory for L-shell photodetachment\nfrom Si- ion in the experimentally accessible range of photon energies (7.5-14\nRy). Comparison is made between the calculations of the response of the ionic\nmany-electron system Si- to an electromagnetic field at the different levels of\napproximation: the \"frozen-field\" Random Phase Approximation with Exchange\n(RPAE), and the static relaxation approximation. The optimal analysis is made\nwhen the dynamic relaxation and polarization are included within the Dyson\nEquation Method (DEM) simultaneously with the RPAE corrections (RPAE&DEM\napproach). It is predicted that the photoexcitation to a resonance state of\ncomplex \"shape-Feschbach\" nature in the open p-shell reveals itself as a\nprominent resonance structure in the photodetachment cross sections in the\nenergy range of the 2s and 2p inner shell thresholds similar to that in 1s\ninner-shell photodetachment from C- (J.Phys.B 39, 1379, 2006). The\nphotodetachment dynamical characteristics clearly demonstrate the significance\nof all the considered many-electron correlations within the RPAE&DEM approach,\nhowever the total photodetachment cross section is dominated by a strong\nresonance peak just after the 2s threshold. Dynamical relaxation (screening) is\nidentified as a decisive factor in the formation of this resonance.\n", "  The recently discovered rotationally powered pulsar PSR J1640-4631 is the\nfirst to have a braking index measured, with high enough precision, that is\ngreater than three. An inclined magnetic rotator in vacuum or plasma would be\nsubject not only to spin-down but also to an alignment torque. The vacuum model\ncan address the braking index only for an almost orthogonal rotator that is\nincompatible with the single peaked pulse profile. The magnetic dipole model\nwith the corotating plasma predicts braking indices between $3-3.25$. We find\nthat the braking index of $3.15$ is consistent with two different inclination\nangles, $18.5\\pm 3$ degrees and $56 \\pm 4$ degrees. The smaller angle is\npreferred given the pulse profile has a single peak and the radio output of the\nsource is weak. We infer the change in the inclination angle to be at the rate\n$-0.23$ degrees per century, three times smaller in absolute value than the\nrate recently observed for the Crab pulsar.\n", "  We present the galaxy luminosity function (LF) of the Abell 119 cluster down\nto $M_r\\sim-14$ mag based on deep images in the $u$-, $g$-, and $r$-bands taken\nby using MOSAIC II CCD mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at the CTIO. The\ncluster membership was accurately determined based on the radial velocity\ninformation as well as on the color-magnitude relation for bright galaxies and\nthe scaling relation for faint galaxies. The overall LF exhibits a bimodal\nbehavior with a distinct dip at $r\\sim18.5$ mag ($M_r\\sim-17.8$ mag), which is\nmore appropriately described by a two-component function. The shape of the LF\nstrongly depends on the cluster-centric distance and on the local galaxy\ndensity. The LF of galaxies in the outer, low-density region exhibits a steeper\nslope and more prominent dip compared with that of counterparts in the inner,\nhigh-density region. We found evidence for a substructure in the projected\ngalaxy distribution in which several overdense regions in the Abell 119 cluster\nappear to be closely associated with the surrounding, possible filamentary\nstructure. The combined LF of the overdense regions exhibits a two-component\nfunction with a distinct dip, while the LF of the central region is well\ndescribed by a single Schechter function. We suggest that, in the context of\nthe hierarchical cluster formation scenario, the observed overdense regions are\nthe relics of galaxy groups, retaining their two-component LFs with a dip,\nwhich acquired their shapes through galaxy merging process in group\nenvironments, before they fall into a cluster.\n", "  Simulations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) surveys are a critical tool for\ncorrecting biases in the analysis of SNIa to infer cosmological parameters.\nLarge scale Monte Carlo simulations include a thorough treatment of observation\nhistory, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models and selection effects. In\nthis paper, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the\nunderlying populations of SNIa color and stretch that correlate with\nluminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized SNIa brightness is determined\nfrom linear `Tripp' relations between the light curve color and luminosity and\nbetween stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual\nbiases because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color\nand stretch values that do not follow the Tripp relation. We find a $10\\sigma$\nbias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and $5\\sigma$ bias (up to\n0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920\nspectroscopically confirmed SNIa from PS1, SNLS, SDSS and several low-z\nsurveys. After we determine the underlying color and stretch distributions, we\nuse simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We show that\nremoving these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the\nintrinsic scatter $\\sigma_{\\textrm{int}}$ from $0.101$ to $0.083$ in the\ncombined PS1, SNLS and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the underlying\npopulations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation-of-state of\ndark energy $w$ of $\\Delta w=0.005$.\n", "  We analyze the kinematics of six Virgo cluster dwarf early-type galaxies\n(dEs) from their globular cluster (GC) systems. We present new Keck/DEIMOS\nspectroscopy for three of them and reanalyze the data found in the literature\nfor the remaining three. We use two independent methods to estimate the\nrotation amplitude (Vmax) and velocity dispersion (sigma_GC) of the GC systems\nand evaluate their statistical significance by simulating non-rotating GC\nsystems with the same number of GC satellites and velocity uncertainties. Our\nmeasured kinematics agree with the published values for the three galaxies from\nthe literature and, in all cases, some rotation is measured. However, our\nsimulations show that the null hypothesis of being non-rotating GC systems\ncannot be ruled out. In the case of VCC1861, the measured Vmax and the\nsimulations indicate that it is not rotating. In the case of VCC1528, the null\nhypothesis can be marginally ruled out, thus, it might be rotating although\nfurther confirmation is needed. In our analysis, we find that, in general, the\nmeasured Vmax tends to be overestimated and the measured sigma_GC tends to be\nunderestimated by amounts that depend on the intrinsic Vmax/sigma_GC, the\nnumber of observed GCs (N_GC), and the velocity uncertainties. The bias is\nnegligible when N_GC>~20. In those cases where a large N_GC is not available,\nit is imperative to obtain data with small velocity uncertainties. For\ninstance, errors of <2km/s lead to Vmax<10km/s for a system that is\nintrinsically not rotating.\n", "  In this paper we suggest a natural interpretation of the de Broglie-Bohm\nquantum potential, as the energy due to the oscillating electromagnetic field\n(virtual photon) coupled with moving charged particle. Generalization of the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is obtained. The wave function is shown to be the\neigenfunction of the Sturm - Liouville problem in which we expand virtual\nphoton to include it implicitly into consideration. It is shown the non -\nlocality of quantum mechanics is related only with virtual photon. As an\nexample, the zero - energy of harmonic oscillator is obtained from classical\nequations.\n", "  Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging is a powerful technique for\ninvestigating dynamic nanoscale processes in nanoparticles immersed in\nreactive, realistic environments. Its temporal resolution is limited, however,\nby the oversampling requirements of 3D phase retrieval. Here we show that\nincorporating the entire measurement time series, which is typically a\ncontinuous physical process, into phase retrieval allows the oversampling\nrequirement at each time step to be reduced leading to a subsequent improvement\nin the temporal resolution by a factor of 2 to 20 times. The increased time\nresolution will allow imaging of faster dynamics and of radiation dose\nsensitive samples. This approach, which we call \"chrono CDI\", may find use in\nimproving time resolution in other imaging techniques.\n", "  Materials which possess a high local density of states varying at a\nsubwavelength scale theoretically permit to focus waves onto focal spots much\nsmaller than the free space wavelength. To do so metamaterials -manmade\ncomposite media exhibiting properties not available in nature- are usually\nconsidered. However this approach is limited to narrow bandwidths due to their\nresonant nature. Here, we prove that it is possible to use a fractal resonator\nalongside time reversal to focus microwaves onto $\\lambda/15$ subwavelength\nfocal spots from the far field, on extremely wide bandwidths. We first\nnumerically prove that this approach can be realized using a multiple channel\ntime reversal mirror, that utilizes all the degrees of freedom offered by the\nfractal resonator. Then we experimentally demonstrate that this approach can be\ndrastically simplified by coupling the fractal resonator to a complex medium,\nhere a cavity, that efficiently converts its spatial degrees of freedom into\ntemporal ones. This allows to achieve deep subwavelength focusing of microwaves\nusing a single channel time reversal. Our method can be generalized to other\nsystems coupling complex media and fractal resonators.\n", "  In this paper, two-dimensional (2-D) hybrid simulations are performed to\ninvestigate ion dynamics at a rippled quasi-parallel shock. The results show\nthat the ripples around the shock front are inherent structures of a\nquasi-parallel shock, and the reformation of the shock is not synchronous along\nthe surface of the shock front. By following the trajectories of the upstream\nions, we find that these ions behave differently when they interact with the\nshock front at different positions along the shock surface. The upstream\nparticles are easier to transmit through the upper part of a ripple, and the\nbulk velocity in the corresponding downstream is larger, where a high-speed jet\nis formed. In the lower part of the ripple, the upstream particles tend to be\nreflected by the shock. For the reflected ions by the shock, they may suffer\nmultiple stage acceleration when moving along the shock surface, or trapped\nbetween the upstream waves and the shock front. At last, these ions may escape\nto the further upstream or enter the downstream, therefore, the superthermal\nions can be found in both the upstream and downstream.\n", "  We present a formalism that explicitly unifies the commonly used\nNakajima-Zwanzig approach for reduced density matrix dynamics with the more\nversatile Mori theory in the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. Employing a\nDyson-type expansion to circumvent the difficulty of projected dynamics, we\nobtain a self-consistent equation for the memory kernel which requires only\nknowledge of normally evolved auxiliary kernels. To illustrate the properties\nof the current approach, we focus on the spin-boson model and limit our\nattention to the use of a simple and inexpensive quasi-classical dynamics,\ngiven by the Ehrenfest method, for the calculation of the auxiliary kernels.\nFor the first time, we provide a detailed analysis of the dependence of the\nproperties of the memory kernels obtained via different projection operators,\nnamely the thermal (Redfield-type) and population based (NIBA-type) projection\noperators. We further elucidate the conditions that lead to short-lived memory\nkernels and the regions of parameter space to which this program is best\nsuited. Via a thorough analysis of the different closures available for the\nauxiliary kernels and the convergence properties of the self-consistently\nextracted memory kernel, we identify the mechanisms whereby the current\napproach leads to a significant improvement over the direct usage of standard\nsemi- and quasi-classical dynamics.\n", "  Generalized quantum master equations (GQMEs) are an important tool in\nmodeling chemical and physical processes. For a large number of problems it has\nbeen shown that exact and approximate quantum dynamics methods can be made\ndramatically more efficient, and in the latter case more accurate, by\nproceeding via the GQME formalism. However, there are many situations where\nutilizing the GQME approach seems to offer no advantage over a direct\nevaluation of the property of interest. Here we provide a more detailed\nunderstanding of the conditions under which these methods will offer benefits.\nIn particular, we derive exact expressions for the memory kernel for systems\nboth in and out of equilibrium, and show the conditions under which these\nexpressions will be guaranteed to return a result identical to that obtained\nfrom direct simulation. We also show the conditions which approximate methods\nmust satisfy if they are to offer different results when used in conjunction\nwith the GQME formalism. These exact analytical results thus provide new\ninsights as to when proceeding via the GQME approach can improve the accuracy\nor efficiency of simulations.\n", "  Energetic electrons with power-law spectrum are most commonly observed in\nastrophysics. This paper investigates electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME)\nfrom the power-law electrons, in which strong pitch-angle anisotropy is\nemphasized. The electron distribution function proposed in this paper can\ndescribe various types of pitch-angle anisotropy. Results show that the\nemission properties of ECME, including radiation growth, propagation, and\nfrequency properties, depend considerably on the types of electron pitch-angle\nanisotropy, and different wave modes show different dependences on the pitch\nangle of electrons. In particular, the maximum growth rate of X2 mode rapidly\ndecreases with respect to the electron pitch-angle cosine $\\mu_0$ at which the\nelectron distribution peaks, while the growth rates for other modes (X1, O1,\nO2) initially increase before decreasing as $\\mu_0$ increases. Moreover, the O\nmode as well as the X mode can be the fastest growth mode, in terms of not only\nthe plasma parameter but also the type of electron pitch-angle distribution.\nThis result presents a significant extension of the recent researches on ECME\ndriven by the lower-energy cutoff of power-law electrons, in which the X mode\nis generally the fastest growth mode.\n", "  We have used the {\\it Spitzer Space Telescope} to observe two transiting\nplanetary systems orbiting low mass stars discovered in the \\Kepler \\Ktwo\nmission. The system K2-3 (EPIC 201367065) hosts three planets while EPIC\n202083828 (K2-26) hosts a single planet. Observations of all four objects in\nthese two systems confirm and refine the orbital and physical parameters of the\nplanets. The refined orbital information and more precise planet radii possible\nwith \\Spitzer will be critical for future observations of these and other \\Ktwo\ntargets. For K2-3b we find marginally significant evidence for a Transit Timing\nVariation between the \\Ktwo and \\Spitzer\\ epochs.\n", "  Motivated by what one observes dealing with PT-symmetric quantum mechanics,\nwe discuss what happens if a physical system is driven by a diagonalizable\nHamiltonian with not all real eigenvalues. In particular, we consider the\nfunctional structure related to systems living in finite-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces, and we show that certain intertwining relations can be deduced also in\nthis case if we introduce suitable antilinear operators. We also analyze a\nsimple model, computing the transition probabilities in the broken and in the\nunbroken regime.\n", "  We report on the results of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the\npersistent X-ray source 1E1743.1-2843, located in the Galactic Center region.\nThe source was observed between September and October 2012 by NuSTAR and\nXMM-Newton, providing almost simultaneous observations in the hard and soft\nX-ray bands. The high X-ray luminosity points to the presence of an accreting\ncompact object. We analyze the possibilities of this accreting compact object\nbeing either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole, and conclude that the joint\nXMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum from 0.3 to 40 $\\mathrm{keV}$ fits to a black\nbody spectrum with $kT\\sim1.8~\\mathrm{keV}$ emitted from a hot spot or an\nequatorial strip on a neutron star surface. This spectrum is thermally\nComptonized by electrons with $kT_{e}\\sim4.6~\\mathrm{keV}$. Accepting this\nneutron star hypothesis, we probe the Low Mass (LMXB) or High Mass (HMXB) X-ray\nBinary nature of the source. While the lack of Type-I bursts can be explained\nin the LMXB scenario, the absence of pulsations in the 2 mHz - 49 Hz frequency\nrange, the lack of eclipses and of an IR companion, and the lack of a\n$K_{\\alpha}$ line from neutral or moderately ionized iron strongly disfavor\ninterpreting this source as a HMXB. We therefore conclude that 1E1743.1-2843 is\nmost likely a NS-LMXB located beyond the Galactic Center. There is weak\nstatistical evidence for a soft X-ray excess possibly indicating thermal\nemission from an accretion disk. However, the disk normalization remains\nunconstrained due to the high hydrogen column density\n($N_{H}\\sim1.6\\times10^{23}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$).\n", "  A sequence search method was developed to search regular frequency spacing in\ndelta Scuti stars by visual inspection and algorithmic search. We searched for\nsequences of quasi-equally spaced frequencies, containing at least four members\nper sequence, in 90 delta Scuti stars observed by CoRoT. We found an\nunexpectedly large number of independent series of regular frequency spacing in\n77 delta Scuti stars (from 1 to 8 sequences) in the non-asymptotic regime. We\nintroduce the sequence search method presenting the sequences and echelle\ndiagram of CoRoT 102675756 and the structure of the algorithmic search. Four\nsequences (echelle ridges) were found in the 5-21 d^{-1} region, where the\npairs of the sequences are shifted (between 0.5-0.59 d^{-1}) by twice the value\nof the estimated rotational splitting frequency (0.269 d^{-1}). The general\nconclusions for the whole sample are also presented in this paper. The\nstatistics of the spacings derived by the sequence search method, by FT and\nthat of the shifts are also compared. In many stars, more than one almost\nequally valid spacing appeared. The model frequencies of FG Vir and their\nrotationally split components were used to reveal a possible explanation that\none spacing is the large separation, while the other is a sum of the large\nseparation and the rotational frequency. In CoRoT 102675756, the two spacings\n(2.249 and 1.977 d^{-1}) agree better with the sum of a possible 1.710 d^{-1}\nlarge separation and two or one times, respectively, the value of the\nrotational frequency.\n", "  We search for a continuum limit in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT)\napproach to quantum gravity by determining the change in lattice spacing using\ntwo independent methods. The two methods yield similar results that may\nindicate how to tune the relevant couplings in the theory in order to take a\ncontinuum limit.\n", "  The inelastic collapse of stochastic trajectories of a randomly accelerated\nparticle moving in half-space $z > 0$ has been discovered by McKean and then\nindependently re-discovered by Cornell et. al. The essence of this phenomenon\nis that particle arrives to a wall at $z = 0$ with zero velocity after an\ninfinite number of inelastic collisions if the restitution coefficient $\\beta$\nof particle velocity is smaller than the critical value\n$\\beta_c=\\exp(-\\pi/\\sqrt{3})$. We demonstrate that inelastic collapse takes\nplace also in a wide class of models with spatially inhomogeneous random force\nand, what is more, that the critical value $\\beta_c$ is universal. That class\nincludes an important case of inertial particles in wall-bounded random flows.\nTo establish how the inelastic collapse influence the particle distribution, we\nconstruct an exact equilibrium probability density function $\\rho(z,v)$ for\nparticle position and velocity. The equilibrium distribution exists only at\n$\\beta<\\beta_c$ and indicates that inelastic collapse does not necessarily mean\nthe near-wall localization.\n", "  We have conducted an imaging survey with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide\nField Camera~3 (WFC3) of 70 Galactic Cepheids, typically within 1~kpc, with the\naim of finding resolved physical companions. The WFC3 field typically covers\nthe 0.1 pc area where companions are expected. In this paper, we identify 39\nCepheids having candidate companions, based on their positions in\ncolor--magnitude diagrams, and having separations $\\geq$5$\"$ from the Cepheids.\nWe use follow-up observations of 14 of these candidates with XMM-Newton, and of\none of them with ROSAT, to separate X-ray-active young stars (probable physical\ncompanions) from field stars (chance alignments). Our preliminary estimate,\nbased on the optical and X-ray observations, is that only 3\\% of the Cepheids\nin the sample have wide companions. Our survey easily detects resolved\nmain-sequence companions as faint as spectral type K\\null. Thus the fact that\nthe two most probable companions (those of FF~Aql and RV~Sco) are earlier than\ntype K is not simply a function of the detection limit. We find no physical\ncompanions having separations larger than 4,000~AU in the X-ray survey. Two\nCepheids are exceptions in that they do have young companions at significantly\nlarger separations ($\\delta$~Cep and S~Nor), but both belong to a cluster or a\nloose association, so our working model is that they are not gravitationally\nbound binary members, but rather cluster/association members. All of these\nproperties provide constraints on both star formation and subsequent dynamical\nevolution. The low frequency of true physical companions at separations $>\\!5\"$\nis confirmed by examination of the subset of the nearest Cepheids and also the\ndensity of the fields.\n", "  We report the computer-automated tuning of gate-defined semiconductor double\nquantum dots in GaAs heterostructures. We benchmark the algorithm by creating\nthree double quantum dots inside a linear array of four quantum dots. The\nalgorithm sets the correct gate voltages for all the gates to tune the double\nquantum dots into the single-electron regime. The algorithm only requires (1)\nprior knowledge of the gate design and (2) the pinch-off value of the single\ngate $T$ that is shared by all the quantum dots. This work significantly\nalleviates the user effort required to tune multiple quantum dot devices.\n", "  Coupled atom-cavity arrays, such as those described by the Jaynes-Cummings\nHubbard model, have the potential to emulate a wide range of condensed matter\nphenomena. In particular, the strongly correlated states of the fractional\nquantum Hall effect can be realised. At some filling fractions, the fraction\nquantum Hall effect has been shown to possess ground states with non-abelian\nexcitations. The most well studied of these states is the Pfaffian state of\nMoore and Read, which is the groundstate of a Hall Liquid with a 3-body\ninteraction. In this paper we show how an effective 3-body interaction can be\ngenerated within the Cavity QED framework, and that a Pfaffian-like groundstate\nof these systems exists.\n", "  It is theoretically and experimentally argued that there may exist bubble or\ntoroid-shaped configurations in some nucleus systems. Based on the nuclear\ntransport model, it is shown that compared with the collision of normal nuclei,\nthere is a depletion of central density of compression with bubble\nconfigurations in projectile and target nuclei. This depletion of central\ncompression density may affect some observables in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  SDSS J1634+2049 is a local (z = 0.1293) infrared-luminous quasar with LIR=\n10^11.91 Lsun. We present a detailed multiwavelength study of both the host\ngalaxy and the nucleus. The host galaxy demonstrates violent, obscured star\nformation activities with SFR ~ 140 Msun yr^-1, estimated from either the PAH\nemission or IR luminosity. The optical to NIR spectra exhibit a blueshifted\nnarrow cuspy component in Hb, HeI5876,10830 and other emission lines\nconsistently with an offset velocity of ~900 km/s, as well as additional\nblueshifting phenomena in high-ionization lines , while there exist blueshifted\nbroad absorption lines (BALs) in NaID and HeI*3889,10830, indicative of the AGN\noutflows producing BALs and emission lines. Constrained mutually by the several\nBALs with CLOUDY, the physical properties of the absorption-line outflow are\nderived as follows: 10^4 < n_H <= 10^5 cm^-3, 10^-1.3 <= U <= 10^-0.7 and\n10^22.5<= N_H <= 10^22.9 cm^-2 , similar to those derived for the emission-line\noutflows. The similarity suggests a common origin. Taking advantages of both\nthe absorption lines and outflowing emission lines, we find that the outflow\ngas is located at a distance of 48 - 65 pc from the nucleus, and that the\nkinetic luminosity of the outflow is 10^44-10^46 erg s^-1. J1634+2049 has a\noff-centered galactic ring on the scale of ~ 30 kpc that is proved to be formed\nby a recent head-on collision by a nearby galaxy. Thus this quasar is a\nvaluable object in the transitional phase emerging out of dust enshrouding as\ndepicted by the co-evolution scenario.\n", "  Between the beginning of its full-scale scientific operations in 2007 and\n2012, the VERITAS Cherenkov telescope array observed more than 130 blazars; of\nthese, 26 were detected as very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) {\\gamma}-ray\nsources. In this work, we present the analysis results of a sample of 114\nundetected objects. The observations constitute a total live-time of ~570\nhours. The sample includes several unidentified Fermi-Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) sources (located at high Galactic latitude) as well as all the sources\nfrom the second Fermi-LAT catalog which are contained within the field of view\nof the VERITAS observations. We have also performed optical spectroscopy\nmeasurements in order to estimate the redshift of some of these blazars that do\nnot have a spectroscopic distance estimate. We present new optical spectra from\nthe Kast instrument on the Shane telescope at the Lick observatory for 18\nblazars included in this work, which allowed for the successful measurement or\nconstraint on the redshift of four of them. For each of the blazars included in\nour sample we provide the flux upper limit in the VERITAS energy band. We also\nstudy the properties of the significance distributions and we present the\nresult of a stacked analysis of the data-set, which shows a 4 {\\sigma} excess.\n", "  Tunable photonic elements at the surface of an optical fiber with\npiezoelectric core are proposed and analyzed theoretically. These elements are\nbased on whispering gallery modes whose propagation along the fiber is fully\ncontrolled by nanoscale variation of the effective fiber radius, which can be\ntuned by means of a piezoelectric actuator embedded into the core. The\ndeveloped theory allows one to express the introduced effective radius\nvariation through the shape of the actuator and the voltage applied to it. In\nparticular, the design of a miniature tunable optical delay line and a\nminiature tunable dispersion compensator is presented. The potential\napplication of the suggested model to the design of a miniature optical buffer\nis discussed.\n", "  In this article, we take the $X(5568)$ to be the scalar diquark-antidiquark\ntype tetraquark state, study the hadronic coupling constant $g_{XB_s\\pi}$ with\nthe three-point QCD sum rules by carrying out the operator product expansion up\nto the vacuum condensates of dimension-6 and including both the connected and\ndisconnected Feynman diagrams, then calculate the partial decay width of the\nstrong decay $ X(5568) \\to B_s^0 \\pi^+$ and obtain the value\n$\\Gamma_X=\\left(20.5\\pm8.1\\right)\\,\\rm{MeV}$, which is consistent with the\nexperimental data $\\Gamma_X = \\left(21.9 \\pm 6.4\n{}^{+5.0}_{-2.5}\\right)\\,\\rm{MeV}$ from the D0 collaboration.\n", "  Water hydrating phospholipid membranes determine their stability and\nfunction, as well as their interaction with other molecules. In this article we\nstudy, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the rotational and\ntranslational dynamical properties of water molecules confined in stacked\nphospholipid membranes at different levels of hydration, from poorly hydrated\nto a completely hydrated membrane. We find that both the translational and the\nreorientation dynamics of water are dramatically slowed down as the hydration\nis reduced. Analyzing in details the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen\nbond at the interface, we show that both those among water molecules and those\nbetween water and lipids slow down by decreasing the hydration, however the\nlatter are always slower than the former. By increasing hydration, water\nsaturates all the possible hydrogen bonds with the lipids and, by further\nincrease of hydration, the hydrogen bonds among waters becomes the majority.\nHowever, the dynamics of the water-lipids hydrogen bonds becomes up to one\norder of magnitude slower than that of the water-water hydrogen bonds, inducing\na large slowing down of the dynamics of the entire system even at large\nhydration level.\n", "  NGC 7023 is a well-studied reflection nebula, which shows strong emission\nfrom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in the form of aromatic\ninfrared bands (AIBs). The spectral variations of the AIBs in this region are\nconnected to the chemical evolution of the PAH molecules which, in turn,\ndepends on the local physical conditions. We use the capabilities of SOFIA to\nobserve a 3.2' x 3.4' region of NGC 7023 at wavelengths that we observe with\nhigh spatial resolution (2.7\") at 3.3 and 11.2 um. We compare the SOFIA images\nwith existing images of the PAH emission at 8.0 um (Spitzer), emission from\nevaporating very small grains (eVSG) extracted from Spitzer-IRS spectral cubes,\nthe ERE (HST and CFHT), and H_2 (2.12 um). We create maps of the 11.2/3.3 um\nratio to probe the morphology of the PAH size distribution and the 8.0/11.2 um\nratio to probe the PAH ionization. We make use of an emission model and of\nvibrational spectra from the NASA Ames PAHdb to translate the 11.2/3.3 um ratio\nto PAH sizes. The 11.2/3.3 um map shows the smallest PAH concentrate on the PDR\nsurface (H_2 and extended red emission) in the NW and South PDR. We estimated\nthat PAHs in the NW PDR bear, on average, a number of carbon atoms (N_c) of ~70\nin the PDR cavity and ~50 at the PDR surface. In the entire nebula, the results\nreveal a factor of 2 variation in the size of the PAH. We relate these size\nvariations to several models for the evolution of the PAH families when they\ntraverse from the molecular cloud to the PDR. The PAH size map enables us to\nfollow the photochemical evolution of PAHs in NGC 7023. Small PAHs result from\nthe photo-evaporation of VSGs as they reach the PDR surface. Inside the PDR\ncavity, the PAH abundance drops as the smallest PAH are broken down. The\naverage PAH size increases in the cavity where only the largest species survive\nor are converted into C_60 by photochemical processing.\n", "  Transport and torque magnetometry measurements are performed at high magnetic\nfields and low temperatures in a series of p-type (Ca-doped) Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$\ncrystals. The angular dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van\nAlphen quantum oscillations enables us to determine the Fermi surface of the\nbulk valence band states as a function of the carrier density. At low density,\nthe angular dependence exhibits a downturn in the oscillations frequency\nbetween $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$, reflecting a bag-shaped hole Fermi surface.\nThe detection of a single frequency for all tilt angles rules out the existence\nof a Fermi surface with different extremal cross-sections down to $24$~meV.\nThere is therefore no signature of a camel-back in the valence band of our bulk\nsamples, in accordance with the direct band gap predicted by $GW$ calculations.\n", "  In protoplanetary disks, the distribution and abundance of small (sub)micron\ngrains are important for a range of physical and chemical processes. For\nexample, they dominate the optical depth at short wavelengths and their\nsurfaces are the sites of many important chemical reactions such as the\nformation of water. Based on their aerodynamical properties (i.e., their strong\ndynamical coupling with the surrounding gas) it is often assumed that these\nsmall grains are well-mixed with the gas. Our goal is to study the vertical\n(re)distribution of grains taking into account settling, turbulent diffusion,\nas well as collisions with other dust grains. Assuming a fragmentation-limited\nbackground dust population, we developed a Monte Carlo approach that follows\nsingle monomers as they move through a vertical column of gas and become\nincorporated in different aggregates as they undergo sticking and fragmenting\ncollisions. We find that (sub)micron grains are not necessarily well-mixed\nvertically, but can become trapped in a thin layer with a scale-height that is\nsignificantly smaller than that of the gas. This collisional trapping occurs\nwhen the timescale for diffusion is comparable to or longer than the collision\ntimescale in the midplane and its effect is strongest when the most massive\nparticles in the size-distribution show significant settling. Based on\nsimulations and analytical considerations we conclude that for typical\ndust-to-gas ratios and turbulence levels, the collisional trapping of small\ngrains should be a relatively common phenomenon. The absence of trapping could\nthen indicate a low dust-to-gas ratio, possibly because a large portion of the\ndust mass has been removed through radial drift or is locked up in\nplanetesimals.\n", "  Recent mid-infrared (MIR) interferometric observations showed in few active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) that the bulk of the infrared emission originates from\nthe polar region above the putative torus, where only little dust should be\npresent. Here, we investigate whether such strong polar dust emission is common\nin AGN. Out of 149 Seyferts in the MIR atlas of local AGN (Asmus et al.), 21\nshow extended MIR emission on single dish images. In 18 objects, the extended\nMIR emission aligns with the system axis position angle, established by [OIII],\nradio, polarisation and maser based position angle measurements. The relative\namount of resolved MIR emission is at least 40 per cent and scales with the\n[OIV] fluxes implying a strong connection between the extended continuum and\n[OIV] emitters. These results together with the radio-quiet nature of the\nSeyferts support the scenario that the bulk of MIR emission is emitted by dust\nin the polar region and not by the torus, which would demand a new paradigm for\nthe infrared emission structure in AGN. The current low detection rate of polar\ndust in the AGN of the MIR atlas is explained by the lack of sufficient high\nquality MIR data and the requirement for the orientation, NLR strength and\ndistance of the AGN. The James-Webb Space Telescope will enable much deeper\nnuclear MIR studies with comparable angular resolution, allowing us to resolve\nthe polar emission and surroundings in most of the nearby AGN.\n", "  By considering momentum transfer in the Fermi constraint procedure, the\nstability of the initial nuclei and fragments produced in heavy-ion collisions\ncan be further improved in the quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The case\nof the phase space occupation probability larger than one is effectively\nreduced with the proposed procedure. Simultaneously, the energy conservation\ncan be better described for both individual nuclei and heavy-ion reactions.\nWith the revised version of the improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD)\nmodel, the fusion excitation functions of $^{16}$O+$^{186}$W and the central\ncollisions of Au+Au at 35 AMeV are re-examined. The fusion cross sections at\nsub-barrier energies and the charge distribution of fragments are relatively\nbetter reproduced due to the reduction of spurious nucleon emission. The charge\nand isotope distribution of fragments in Xe+Sn, U+U and Zr+Sn at intermediate\nenergies are also predicted. More unmeasured extremely neutron-rich fragments\nwith $Z=16-28$ are observed in the central collisions of $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U\nthan that of $^{96}$Zr+$^{124}$Sn, which indicates that multi-fragmentation of\nU+U may offer a fruitful pathway to new neutron-rich isotopes.\n", "  We consider the algebra of simple operators defined in a time band in a CFT\nwith a holographic dual. When the band is smaller than the light crossing time\nof AdS, an entire causal diamond in the center of AdS is separated from the\nband by a horizon. We show that this algebra obeys a version of the\nReeh-Schlieder theorem: the action of the algebra on the CFT vacuum can\napproximate any low energy state in the CFT arbitrarily well, but no operator\nwithin the algebra can exactly annihilate the vacuum. We show how to relate\nlocal excitations in the complement of the central diamond to simple operators\nin the band. Local excitations within the diamond are invisible to the algebra\nof simple operators in the band by causality, but can be related to complicated\noperators called \"precursors\". We use the Reeh-Schlieder theorem to write down\na simple and explicit formula for these precursors on the boundary. We comment\non the implications of our results for black hole complementarity and the\nemergence of bulk locality from the boundary.\n", "  We study the evolution of perpendicularly magnetized tunnel junctions under\n300 to 400 $^{\\circ}$C annealing. The hysteresis loops do not evolve much\nduring annealing and they are not informative of the underlying structural\nevolutions. These evolutions are better revealed by the frequencies of the\nferromagnetic resonance eigenmodes of the tunnel junction. Their modeling\nprovides the exchange couplings and the layers' anisotropies within the stack\nwhich can serve as a diagnosis of the tunnel junction state after each\nannealing step. The anisotropies of the two CoFeB-based parts and the two\nCo/Pt-based parts of the tunnel junction decay at different rates during\nannealing. The ferromagnet exchange coupling through the texture-breaking Ta\nlayer fails above 375$^{\\circ}$C. The Ru spacer meant to promote a synthetic\nantiferromagnet behavior is also insufficiently robust to annealing. Based on\nthese evolutions we propose optimization routes for the next generation tunnel\njunctions.\n", "  The $6S_{1/2}-5D_{5/2}$ electric quadrupole transition is investigated in\nCesium vapor at room temperature via nonlinear Doppler-free 6P-6S-5D\nthree-level spectroscopy. Frequency-resolved studies of individual E2 hyperfine\nlines allow one to analyze optical pumping dynamics, polarization selection\nrules and line intensities. It opens the way to studies of transfer of light\norbital angular momentum to atoms, and the influence of metamaterials on E2\nline spectra.\n", "  We formulate a straightforward scheme of statistical mechanics for\ninhomogeneous systems that includes the virial series in powers of the activity\nfor the grand free energy and density distributions. There, cluster integrals\nformulated for inhomogeneous systems play a main role. We center on second\norder terms that were analyzed in the case of hard-wall confinement, focusing\nin planar, spherical and cylindrical walls. Further analysis was devoted to the\nLennard-Jones system and its generalization the 2k-k potential. For this\ninteraction potentials the second cluster integral was evaluated analytically.\nWe obtained the fluid-substrate surface tension at second order for the planar,\nspherical and cylindrical confinement. Spherical and cylindrical cases were\nanalyzed using a series expansion in the radius including higher order terms.\nWe detected a $\\ln R^{-1}/R^{2}$ dependence of the surface tension for the\nstandard Lennard-Jones system confined by spherical and cylindrical walls, no\nmatter if particles are inside or outside of the hard-walls. The analysis was\nextended to bending and Gaussian curvatures, where exact expressions were also\nobtained.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries serve as a valuable source of stellar masses and radii\nthat inform stellar evolutionary models and provide insight into additional\nastrophysical processes. The exquisite light curves generated by space-based\nmissions such as Kepler offer the most stringent tests to date. We use the\nKepler light curve of the 4.8-day eclipsing binary KIC 5739896 with ground\nbased optical spectra to derive fundamental parameters for the system. We\nreconstruct the component spectra to determine the individual atmospheric\nparameters, and model the Kepler photometry with the binary synthesis code ELC\nto obtain accurate masses and radii. The two components of KIC 5738698 are\nF-type stars with M1 = 1.39+/-0.04M, M2 = 1.34+/-0.06M, and R1 = 1.84+/-0.03R,\nR2 = 1.72+/-0.03R. We also report a small eccentricity (e < 0.0017) and unusual\nalbedo values that are required to match the detailed shape of the Kepler light\ncurve. Comparisons with evolutionary models indicate an approximate age of 2.3\nGyr for the system.\n", "  Nonlinear stochastic differential equations provide one of the mathematical\nmodels yielding 1/f noise. However, the drawback of a single equation as a\nsource of 1/f noise is the necessity of power-law steady-state probability\ndensity of the signal. In this paper we generalize this model and propose a\nsystem of two coupled nonlinear stochastic differential equations. The\nequations are derived from the scaling properties necessary for the achievement\nof 1/f noise. The first equation describes the changes of the signal, whereas\nthe second equation represents a fluctuating rate of change. The proposed\ncoupled stochastic differential equations allows us to obtain 1/f spectrum in a\nwide range of frequencies together with the almost arbitrary steady-state\ndensity of the signal.\n", "  We present an Integral Field Unit survey of 73 galaxy clusters and groups\nwith the VIsible Multi Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) on VLT. We exploit the data\nto determine the H$\\alpha$ gas dynamics on kpc-scales to study the feedback\nprocesses occurring within the dense cluster cores. We determine the kinematic\nstate of the ionised gas and show that the majority of systems ($\\sim$ 2/3)\nhave relatively ordered velocity fields on kpc scales that are similar to the\nkinematics of rotating discs and are decoupled from the stellar kinematics of\nthe Brightest Cluster Galaxy. The majority of the H$\\alpha$ flux ($>$ 50%) is\ntypically associated with these ordered kinematics and most systems show\nrelatively simple morphologies suggesting they have not been disturbed by a\nrecent merger or interaction. Approximately 20% of the sample (13/73) have\ndisturbed morphologies which can typically be attributed to AGN activity\ndisrupting the gas. Only one system shows any evidence of an interaction with\nanother cluster member. A spectral analysis of the gas suggests that the\nionisation of the gas within cluster cores is dominated by non stellar\nprocesses, possibly originating from the intracluster medium itself.\n", "  Based on the results of first-principles calculations we demonstrate that\nsignificant distortion of graphene sheets caused by adsorption of fluorine\natoms leads to the formation of metastable patterns for which the next step of\nfluorination is considerably less energetically favorable. Existence of these\nstable patterns oriented along the armchair direction makes possible the\nsynthesis of various CFx structures. The combination of strong distortion of\nthe nonfluorinated graphene sheet with the doping caused by the polar nature of\nC-F bonds reduces the energy cost of migration and the energy of migration\nbarriers, making possible the migration of fluorine atoms on the graphene\nsurface as well as transformation of the shapes of fluorinated areas. The\ndecreasing energy cost of migration with increasing fluorine content also leads\nto increasing numbers of single fluorine adatoms, which could be the source of\nmagnetic moments.\n", "  We theoretically show that the spin Hall effect arises in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) of neutral atoms interacting via the magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteractions (MDDIs). Since the MDDI couples the total spin angular momentum\nand the relative orbital angular momentum of two colliding atoms, it works as a\nspin-orbit coupling. Thus, when we prepare a BEC in a magnetic sublevel $m=0$,\nthermally and quantum-mechanically excited atoms in the $m=1$ and $-1$ states\nfeel the Lorentz-like foces in the opposite directions. This is the origin for\nthe emergence of the the spin Hall effect. We define the mass-current and\nspin-current operators from the equations of continuity and calculate the spin\nHall conductivity from the off-diagonal current-current correlation function\nwithin the Bogoliubov approximation. We find that the correction of the current\noperators due to the MDDI significantly contributes to the spin Hall\nconductivity. Possible experimental situation is also discussed.\n", "  Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of column densities are an\nestablished tool to characterize the evolutionary state of interstellar clouds.\nUsing simulations, we show to what degree their determination is affected by\nnoise, line-of-sight contamination, field selection, and the incomplete\nsampling in interferometric measurements. We solve the integrals that describe\nthe convolution of a cloud PDF with contaminating sources and study the impact\nof missing information on the measured column density PDF. The effect of\nobservational noise can be easily estimated and corrected for if the root mean\nsquare (rms) of the noise is known. For $\\sigma_{noise}$ values below 40% of\nthe typical cloud column density, $N_{peak}$, this involves almost no\ndegradation of the accuracy of the PDF parameters. For higher noise levels and\nnarrow cloud PDFs the width of the PDF becomes increasingly uncertain. A\ncontamination by turbulent foreground or background clouds can be removed as a\nconstant shield if the PDF of the contamination peaks at a lower column or is\nnarrower than that of the observed cloud. Uncertainties in the definition of\nthe cloud boundaries mainly affect the low-column density part of the PDF and\nthe mean density. As long as more than 50% of a cloud are covered, the impact\non the PDF parameters is negligible. In contrast, the incomplete sampling of\nthe uv plane in interferometric observations leads to uncorrectable distortions\nof the PDF of the produced maps. An extension of ALMA's capabilities would\nallow us to recover the high-column density tail of the PDF but we found no way\nto measure the intermediate and low column density part of the underlying cloud\nPDF in interferometric observations.\n", "  The recently published analytic probability density function for the mildly\nnon-linear cosmic density field within spherical cells is used to build a\nsimple but accurate maximum likelihood estimate for the redshift evolution of\nthe variance of the density, which, as expected, is shown to have smaller\nrelative error than the sample variance. This estimator provides a competitive\nprobe for the equation of state of dark energy, reaching a few percent accuracy\non wp and wa for a Euclid-like survey. The corresponding likelihood function\ncan take into account the configuration of the cells via their relative\nseparations. A code to compute one-cell density probability density functions\nfor arbitrary initial power spectrum, top-hat smoothing and various spherical\ncollapse dynamics is made available online so as to provide straightforward\nmeans of testing the effect of alternative dark energy models and initial\npower-spectra on the low-redshift matter distribution.\n", "  In this work we analyze constrained superfields in supersymmetry and\nsupergravity. We propose a constraint that, in combination with the constrained\ngoldstino multiplet, consistently removes any selected component from a generic\nsuperfield. We also describe its origin, providing the operators whose\nequations of motion lead to the decoupling of such components. We illustrate\nour proposal by means of various examples and show how known constraints can be\nreproduced by our method.\n", "  Ligand-receptor interactions are ubiquitous in biology and have become\npopular in materials in view of their applications to programmable\nself-assembly. Although, complex functionalities often emerge from the\nsimultaneous interaction of more than just two linker molecules, state of art\ntheoretical frameworks enable the calculation of the free energy only in\nsystems featuring one-to-one ligand/receptor binding. In this communication we\nderive a general formula to calculate the free energy of a system featuring\nsimultaneous direct interaction between an arbitrary number of linkers. To\nexemplify the potential and generality of our approach we apply it to the\nsystems recently introduced by Parolini et al. [ACS Nano 10, 2392 (2016)] and\nHalverson et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094903 (2016)], both featuring\nfunctioanlized Brownian particles interacting via three-linker complexes.\n", "  Aims. CO ro-vibrational lines observed from Herbig group II discs are seen to\nbe often broad while the same lines observed from group I discs are often\nnarrow. This difference is not well understood. In this paper we explore the\nunderlying cause for this difference and provide a pathway for a better\nunderstanding of the geometry and structure of the inner discs around Herbig\nAe/Be stars. Methods. High-spectral-resolution infrared spectra of CO\nro-vibrational emission from six Herbig Ae/Be candidate stars were taken with\nCRIRES (CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph) at the VLT\n(Very Large Telescope). From these spectra, we produce individual and co-added\nCO ro-vibrational line profiles. We investigate line profile shape differences,\nand we explore the FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum) variations with J quantum\nnumber in the context of disc geometry. Furthermore, we put our new sources\ninto the context of earlier observed sources to study a large sample. For\ncomparison, we also investigate the FWHM variations with J of modelled CO\nro-vibrational lines from two typical disc geometries produced with the\nthermo-chemical disc modelling code ProDiMo. Results. - abbreviated - Comparing\ndust and gas inner disc geometries (inferred by SED and CO ro-vibrational\nemission) for the expanded sample of observed Herbig discs, we find no clear\ncorrespondence between the SED groups of the sources and their inner CO radius.\nConclusions. The FWHM versus J is a potential new gas diagnostic for the inner\ndisc with e.g. a constant FWHM versus J indicating the presence of a large gas\nhole or gap. Both models and observations indicate the potential of this new\ndiagnostic. - abbreviated -\n", "  More complete knowledge of galaxy evolution requires understanding the\nprocess of star formation and interaction between the interstellar radiation\nfield and the interstellar medium in galactic environments traversing a wide\nrange of physical parameter space. Here we focus on the impact of massive star\nformation on the surrounding low metallicity ISM in 30 Doradus in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. A low metal abundance, as is the case of some galaxies of the\nearly universe, results in less ultra-violet shielding for the formation of the\nmolecular gas necessary for star formation to proceed. The half-solar\nmetallicity gas in this region is strongly irradiated by the super star cluster\nR136, making it an ideal laboratory to study the structure of the ISM in an\nextreme environment. Our spatially resolved study investigates the gas heating\nand cooling mechanisms, particularly in the photo-dissociation regions where\nthe chemistry and thermal balance are regulated by far-ultraviolet photons (6\neV< h\\nu <13.6 eV).\n  We present Herschel observations of far-infrared fine-structure lines\nobtained with PACS and SPIRE/FTS. We have combined atomic fine-structure lines\nfrom Herschel and Spitzer observations with ground-based CO data to provide\ndiagnostics on the properties and the structure of the gas by modeling it with\nthe Meudon PDR code. We derive the spatial distribution of the radiation field,\nthe pressure, the size, and the filling factor of the photodissociated gas and\nmolecular clouds. We find a range of pressure of ~ 10^5 - 1.7x10^6 cm^{-3} K\nand a range of incident radiation field G_UV ~ 10^2 - 2.5x10^4 through PDR\nmodeling. Assuming a plane-parallel geometry and a uniform medium, we find a\ntotal extinction of 1-3 mag , which correspond to a PDR cloud size of 0.2 to\n3pc, with small CO depth scale of 0.06 to 0.5pc. We also determine the three\ndimensional structure of the gas. (Abridged)\n", "  We present a study on the dwarf lenticular galaxy MCG+08-22-082 (U141)\nlocated in the Ursa Major cluster, which is blue centered, double cored, and\nhas a boxy appearance. Using publicly available data from the SDSS, we perform\nan analysis of structural and stellar population properties of the galaxy and\nthe cores. We find that the light profile of U141 follows an exponential law.\nU141 has a brightness Mr = -16.01 mag, and an effective radius Re = 1.7 kpc.\nThe boxiness parameter, a4/a, is mostly between 0 and -0.05 in the inner parts,\nreaching an extreme of about -0.1. Double cores are seen at the center of U141\nand each of these cores has a stellar mass of ~10^6 M_sun and the separation\nbetween them is ~300 pc. Optical spectroscopy of these cores shows prominent\nemission in H_alpha suggesting ongoing star forming activities. We interpret\nthese morphological properties to speculate that U141 is a merger remnant of\ntwo disk galaxies. Thus, we might have caught an intermediate stage of merging\nwith the evidence of double cores in the center of the galaxy.\n", "  Motivated by the recent results in arXiv:1601.05679 about the quark-antiquark\npotential in $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM, we reconsider the problem of computing the\nasymptotic weak-coupling expansion of the ground state energy of a certain\nclass of 1d Schr\\\"odinger operators $-\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+\\lambda\\,V(x)$ with\nlong-range potential $V(x)$. In particular, we consider even potentials obeying\n$\\int_{\\mathbb R}dx\\, V(x)<0$ with large $x$ asymptotics $V\\sim\n-a/x^{2}-b/x^{3}+\\cdots$. The associated Schr\\\"odinger operator is known to\nadmit a bound state for $\\lambda\\to 0^{+}$, but the binding energy is\nrigorously non-analytic at $\\lambda=0$. Its asymptotic expansion starts at\norder $\\mathcal O(\\lambda)$, but contains higher corrections\n$\\lambda^{n}\\,\\log^{m}\\lambda$ with all $0\\le m\\le n-1$ and standard\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory fails order by order in $\\lambda$.\nWe discuss various analytical tools to tame this problem and provide the\ngeneral expansion of the binding energy at $\\mathcal O(\\lambda^{3})$ in terms\nof quadratures. The method is tested on a soluble potential that is fully under\ncontrol, and on various non-soluble cases as well. A supersymmetric case,\narising in the study of the quark-antiquark potential in $\\mathcal N=6$ ABJ(M)\ntheory, is also exploited to provide a further non-trivial consistency check.\nOur analytical results confirm at third order a remarkable exponentiation of\nthe leading infrared logarithms, first noticed in $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM where it\nmay be proved by Renormalization Group arguments. We prove this interesting\nfeature at all orders at the level of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for general\npotentials in the considered class.\n", "  We present the results of a third order calculation of the pion-nucleon\nscattering amplitude in a chiral effective field theory with pions, nucleons\nand delta resonances as explicit degrees of freedom. We work in a manifestly\nLorentz invariant formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory using\ndimensional regularization and the extended on-mass-shell renormalization\nscheme. In the delta resonance sector, the on mass-shell renormalization is\nrealized as a complex-mass scheme. By fitting the low-energy constants of the\neffective Lagrangian to the $S$- and $P$-partial waves a satisfactory\ndescription of the phase shifts from the analysis of the Roy-Steiner equations\nis obtained. We predict the phase shifts for the $D$ and $F$ waves and compare\nthem with the results of the analysis of the George Washington University\ngroup. The threshold parameters are calculated both in the delta-less and\ndelta-full cases. Based on the determined low-energy constants, we discuss the\npion-nucleon sigma term. Additionally, in order to determine the strangeness\ncontent of the nucleon, we calculate the octet baryon masses in the presence of\ndecuplet resonances up to next-to-next-to-leading order in SU(3) baryon chiral\nperturbation theory. The octet baryon sigma terms are predicted as a byproduct\nof this calculation.\n", "  Hysteresis can be found in driven many-body systems such as magnets and\nsuperfluids. Rate-dependent hysteresis arises when a system is driven\nperiodically while relaxing towards equilibrium. A two-state paramagnet driven\nby an oscillating magnetic field in the relaxation approximation clearly\ndemonstrates rate-dependent hysteresis. A noninteracting atomic Fermi gas in an\noptical ring potential, when driven by a periodic artificial gauge field and\nsubjected to dissipation, is shown to exhibit hysteresis loops of atomic\ncurrent due to a competition of the driving time and the relaxation time. This\nis in contrast to electronic systems exhibiting equilibrium persistent current\ndriven by magnetic flux due to rapid relaxation. Universal behavior of the\ndissipated energy in one hysteresis loop is observed in both the magnetic and\natomic systems, showing linear and inverse-linear dependence on the relaxation\ntime in the strong and weak dissipation regimes. While interactions in general\ninvalidate the framework for rate-dependent hysteresis, an atomic Fermi gas\nwith artificial spin-orbit coupling exhibits hysteresis loops of atomic\ncurrents. Cold-atoms in ring-shape potentials are thus promising in\ndemonstrating rate-dependent hysteresis and its associated phenomena.\n", "  We present a 2D study of star formation at kpc and sub-kpc scales of a sample\nof local (z<0.1) U/LIRGs, based on near-IR VLT-SINFONI observations. We\nobtained integrated measurements of the star formation rate (SFR) and star\nformation rate surface density, together with their 2D distributions, based on\nBr_gamma and Pa_alpha emission. We observe a tight linear correlation between\nthe SFR derived from our extinction-corrected measurements and that derived\nfrom 24 micron data, and a reasonable agreement with SFR derived from total IR\nluminosity. Our near-IR measurements are on average a factor 3 larger than\noptical SFR, even when extinction corrections are applied. We found that LIRGs\nhave a median-observed star formation rate surface density of 1.72\nMsun/yr/kpc^2 for the extinction-corrected distribution, whilst ULIRGs have\n0.23 Msun/yr/kpc^2, respectively. These median values for ULIRGs increase up to\n2.90 Msun/yr/kpc^2, when only their inner regions, covering the same size as\nthe average FoV of LIRGs, are considered. We identified a total of 95\nindividual SF clumps in our sample, with sizes within 60-1500pc, and\nextinction-corrected Pa_alpha luminosities of 10^5-10^8 Lsun. Star-forming\nclumps in LIRGs are about ten times larger and thousands of times more luminous\nthan typical clumps in spiral galaxies. Clumps in ULIRGs have sizes similar\n(x0.5-1) to those of high-z clumps, having Pa_alpha luminosities similar to\nsome high-z clumps, and about 10 times less luminous than the most luminous\nhigh-z clumps identified so far. We also observed a change in the slope of the\nL-r relation. A likely explanation is that most luminous galaxies are\ninteracting and merging, and therefore their size represents a combination of\nthe distribution of the star-forming clumps within each galaxy in the system\nplus the effect of the projected distance.\n", "  CONTEXT. Exoplanet searches have demonstrated that giant planets are\npreferentially found around metal-rich stars and that their fraction increases\nwith the stellar mass. AIMS. During the past six years, we have conducted a\nradial velocity follow-up program of 166 giant stars, to detect substellar\ncompanions, and characterizing their orbital properties. Using this\ninformation, we aim to study the role of the stellar evolution in the orbital\nparameters of the companions, and to unveil possible correlations between the\nstellar properties and the occurrence rate of giant planets. METHODS. Using\nFEROS and CHIRON spectra, we have computed precision radial velocities and we\nhave derived atmospheric and physical parameters for all of our targets.\nAdditionally, velocities computed from UCLES spectra are presented here. By\nstudying the periodic radial velocity signals, we have detected the presence of\nseveral substellar companions. RESULTS. We present four new planetary systems\naround the giant stars HIP8541, HIP74890, HIP84056 and HIP95124. Additionally,\nwe find that giant planets are more frequent around metal-rich stars, reaching\na peak in the detection of $f$ = 16.7$^{+15.5}_{-5.9}$% around stars with\n[Fe/H] $\\sim$ 0.35 dex. Similarly, we observe a positive correlation of the\nplanet occurrence rate with the stellar mass, between M$_\\star$ $\\sim$ 1.0 -2.1\nM$_\\odot$, with a maximum of $f$ = 13.0$^{+10.1}_{-4.2}$%, at M$_\\star$ = 2.1\nM$_\\odot$. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that giant planets are preferentially\nformed around metal-rich stars. Also, we conclude that they are more\nefficiently formed around more massive stars, in the mass range of M$_\\star$\n$\\sim$ 1.0 - 2.1 M$_\\odot$. These observational results confirm previous\nfindings for solar-type and post-MS hosting stars, and provide further support\nto the core-accretion formation model.\n", "  Four-dimensional gravity in the presence of a dilatonic scalar field and an\nAbelian gauge field is considered. This theory corresponds to the bosonic\nsector of a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity which induces a determined self-interacting potential for the\nscalar field. We compute the conserved charges and carry out the thermodynamics\nof an anti-de Sitter (AdS) dyonic black hole solution recently proposed. The\ncharges coming from symmetries of the action are computed by using the\nRegge-Teitelboim Hamiltonian approach. These correspond to the mass, which\nacquires contributions from the scalar field, and the electric charge.\nIntegrability conditions are introduced because the scalar field leads to\nnon-integrable terms in the variation of the mass. These conditions are\ngenerically solved by introducing boundary conditions that arbitrarily relates\nthe leading and subleading terms of the scalar field fall-off. The Hamiltonian\nEuclidean action, computed in the grand canonical ensemble, is obtained by\ndemanding the action to attain an extremum. Its value is given by a radial\nboundary term plus an additional polar angle boundary term due to the presence\nof a magnetic monopole. Remarkably, the magnetic charge can be identified from\nthe variation of the additional polar angle boundary term, confirming that the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics is a consequence of having a\nwell-defined and finite Hamiltonian action principle, even if the charge does\nnot come from a symmetry of the action. The temperature and electrostatic\npotential are determined demanding regularity on the black hole solution,\nwhereas the value of the magnetic potential is already identified in the\nvariation of the additional polar angle boundary term. Consequently, the first\nlaw of black hole thermodynamics is identically satisfied by construction.\n", "  We consider 2+1 dimensional off-shell N = 1 pure supergravity that is\nconstructed from graviton, gravitino and auxiliary field. We show that the\n$R^2$ supersymmetric invariant and $R^2_{\\mu \\nu}$ supersymmetric invariant are\nexpressed as local supersymmetric exact terms up to mass terms for gravitino.\nIn both cases, the mass parameter is proportional to the off-shell\nsupersymmetric cosmological constant.\n", "  We present spectroscopic observations of the nearby dwarf galaxy AGC 198691.\nThis object is part of the Survey of HI in Extremely Low-Mass Dwarfs (SHIELD)\nproject, which is a multi-wavelength study of galaxies with HI masses in the\nrange of 10$^{6}$-10$^{7.2}$~M$_{\\odot}$ discovered by the ALFALFA survey. We\nhave obtained spectra of the lone HII region in AGC 198691 with the new\nhigh-throughput KPNO Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (KOSMOS) on the\nMayall 4-m as well as with the Blue Channel spectrograph on the MMT 6.5-m\ntelescope. These observations enable the measurement of the\ntemperature-sensitive [OIII]$\\lambda$4363 line and hence the determination of a\n\"direct\" oxygen abundance for AGC 198691. We find this system to be an\nextremely metal-deficient (XMD) system with an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)\n= 7.02 $\\pm$ 0.03, making AGC 198691 the lowest-abundance star-forming galaxy\nknown in the local universe. Two of the five lowest-abundance galaxies known\nhave been discovered by the ALFALFA blind HI survey; this high yield of XMD\ngalaxies represents a paradigm shift in the search for extremely metal-poor\ngalaxies.\n", "  We build unitary representations of the BMS algebra and its higher-spin\nextensions in three dimensions, using induced representations as a guide. Our\nprescription naturally emerges from an ultrarelativistic limit of\nhighest-weight representations of Virasoro and W algebras, which is to be\ncontrasted with non-relativistic limits that typically give non-unitary\nrepresentations. To support this dichotomy, we also point out that the\nultrarelativistic and non-relativistic limits of generic W algebras differ in\nthe structure of their non-linear terms.\n", "  The ESSENCE survey discovered 213 Type Ia supernovae at redshifts 0.1 < z <\n0.81 between 2002 and 2008. We present their R and I-band photometry, measured\nfrom images obtained using the MOSAIC II camera at the CTIO 4 m Blanco\ntelescope, along with rapid-response spectroscopy for each object. We use our\nspectroscopic follow-up observations to determine an accurate, quantitative\nclassification and a precise redshift. Through an extensive calibration program\nwe have improved the precision of the CTIO Blanco natural photometric system.\nWe use several empirical metrics to measure our internal photometric\nconsistency and our absolute calibration of the survey. We assess the effect of\nvarious potential sources of systematic bias on our measured fluxes, and we\nestimate that the dominant term in the systematic error budget from the\nphotometric calibration on our absolute fluxes is ~1%.\n", "  We present initial results from a program aimed at establishing a network of\nhot DA white dwarfs to serve as spectrophotometric standards for present and\nfuture wide-field surveys. These stars span the equatorial zone and are faint\nenough to be conveniently observed throughout the year with large-aperture\ntelescopes. Spectra of these white dwarfs are analyzed to generate a\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) model atmosphere normalized to HST\ncolors, including adjustments for wavelength-dependent interstellar extinction.\nOnce established, this standard star network will serve ground-based\nobservatories in both hemispheres as well as space-based instrumentation from\nthe UV to the near IR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this concept and\nshow how two different approaches to the problem using somewhat different\nassumptions produce equivalent results. We discuss lessons learned and the\nresulting corrective actions applied to our program.\n", "  The photodisintegration of $^9$Be in the energy region lower than $E_\\gamma =\n16$ MeV is investigated by using the $\\alpha$~+~$\\alpha$~+~$n$ three-body model\nand the complex scaling method. The cross section exhibits two aspects in the\ndifferent two energy regions. In the low energy region up to $E_\\gamma = 6$\nMeV, the cross section is explained by the transition strengths into the\nexcited resonant states of $^9$Be, while the dipole transition into the\nnon-resonant continuum states of $^8$Be(2$^+$)~+~$n$ dominates the cross\nsection in the energy region of $6 \\le E_\\gamma \\le 16$ MeV. Furthermore, it is\nshown that the dipole strength at $E_\\gamma \\sim 8$ MeV is understood to be\ncaused by the single-neutron excitation from the $^8$Be(2$^+$)~$\\otimes$~$\\nu\np_{3/2}$ configuration in the ground state.\n", "  Ongoing improvements in the measurement of positronium transition intervals\nmotivate the calculation of the $O(m \\alpha^7)$ corrections to these intervals.\nIn this work we focus on corrections to the spin-singlet parapositronium\nenergies involving virtual annihilation to two photons in an intermediate\nstate. We have evaluated all contributions to the positronium S-state energy\nlevels that can be written as the product of a one-loop correction on one side\nof the annihilation event and another one-loop correction on the other side.\nThese effects contribute $\\Delta E = -0.561971(25) m \\alpha^7/\\pi^3$ to the\nparapositronium ground state energy.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) collaboration has recently\nreported on 50 months of measurements of the isotropic Extragalactic Gamma Ray\nBackground (EGRB) spectrum between $100\\mbox{MeV}$ and $820\\mbox{GeV}$.\nUltrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) protons interact with the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) photons and produce cascade photons of energies\n$10\\mbox{MeV}\\mbox{-}1\\mbox{TeV}$ that contribute to the EGRB flux. We examine\nseven possible evolution models for UHECRs and find that UHECR sources that\nevolve as the Star Formation Rate (SFR), medium low luminosity active galactic\nnuclei type-1 ($L = 10^{43.5}\\mbox{erg sec}^{-1}$ in the\n$[0.5\\mbox{-}2]\\mbox{KeV}$ band), and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) are the\nmost acceptable given the constraints imposed by the observed EGRB. Other\npossibilities produce too much secondary $\\gamma$-radiation. In all cases, the\ndecaying dark matter contribution improves the fit at high energy, but the\ncontribution of still unresolved blazars, which would leave the smallest role\nfor decaying dark matter, may yet provide an alternative improvement.\n  The possibility that the entire EGRB can be fitted with resolvable but\nnot-yet-resolved blazars, as recently claimed by Ajello et al. (2015), would\nleave little room in the EGRB to accommodate $\\gamma$-rays from extragalactic\nUHECR production, even for many source evolution rates that would otherwise be\nacceptable. We find that, under the assumption of UHECRs being mostly protons,\nthere is not enough room for producing extragalactic UHECRs with AGN, GRB, or\neven SFR source evolution. Sources that evolve as BL Lacs on the other hand,\nwould produce much less secondary $\\gamma$-radiation and would remain a viable\nsource of UHECRs, provided that they dominate.\n", "  In the last years, ultra-low temperature chemical kinetic experiments have\ndemonstrated that some gas-phase reactions are much faster than previously\nthought. One example is the reaction between OH and CH3OH, which has been\nrecently found to be accelerated at low temperatures yielding CH3O as main\nproduct. This finding opened the question of whether the CH3O observed in the\ndense core Barnard 1b could be formed by the gas-phase reaction of CH3OH and\nOH. Several chemical models including this reaction and grain-surface processes\nhave been developed to explain the observed abundance of CH$_3$O with little\nsuccess. Here we report for the first time rate coefficients for the gas-phase\nreaction of OH and CH3OH down to a temperature of 22 K, very close to those in\ncold interstellar clouds. Two independent experimental set-ups based on the\nsupersonic gas expansion technique coupled to the pulsed laser photolysis-laser\ninduced fluorescence technique were used to determine rate coefficients in the\ntemperature range 22-64 K. The temperature dependence obtained in this work can\nbe expressed as k(22-64 K) = (3.6+/-0.1)e-12 (T/ 300)^(-1.0+/-0.2) cm3\nmolecule-1 s-1. Implementing this expression in a chemical model of a cold\ndense cloud results in CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratios similar or slightly lower\nthan the value of 3e-3 observed in Barnard 1b. This finding confirms that the\ngas-phase reaction between OH and CH3OH is an important contributor to the\nformation of interstellar CH3O. The role of grain-surface processes in the\nformation of CH3O, although it cannot be fully neglected, remains\ncontroversial.\n", "  In metallic condensed matter systems two different types of Weyl fermions can\nin principle emerge, with either a vanishing (type-I) or with a finite\n(type-II) density of states at the Weyl node energy. So far only WTe2 and MoTe2\nwere predicted to be type-II Weyl semi-metals. Here we identify TaIrTe4 as a\nthird member of this family of topological semi-metals. TaIrTe4 has the\nattractive feature that it hosts only four well-separated Weyl points, the\nminimum imposed by symmetry. Moreover, the resulting topological surface states\n- Fermi arcs connecting Weyl nodes of opposite chirality - extend to about 1/3\nof the surface Brillouin zone. This large momentum-space separation is very\nfavorable for detecting the Fermi arcs spectroscopically and in transport\nexperiments.\n", "  We consider a general non-Abelian renormalizable ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\ngauge theory, regularized by higher covariant derivatives without breaking the\nBRST invariance, and calculate one-loop divergences for a general form of\nhigher derivative regulator and of the gauge fixing term. It is demonstrated\nthat the momentum integrals giving the one-loop $\\beta$-function are integrals\nof double total derivatives independently of a particular choice of the higher\nderivative term. Evaluating them we reproduce the well-known result for the\none-loop $\\beta$-function. Also we find that the three-point ghost vertices\nwith a single line of the quantum gauge superfield are not renormalized in the\nconsidered approximation.\n", "  The Josephson effect provides a direct method to probe the strength of the\npairing interaction in superconductors. By measuring the phase fluctuating\nJosephson current between a superconducting tip of a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM) and a BCS superconductor with isolated magnetic adatoms on its\nsurface, we demonstrate that the spatial variation of the pairing order\nparameter can be characterized on the atomic scale. This system provides an\nexample where the local pairing potential suppression is not directly reflected\nin the spectra measured via quasipartcile tunneling. Spectroscopy with such\nsuperconducting tips also show signatures of previously unexplored Andreev\nprocesses through individual impurity-bound Shiba states. The atomic resolution\nachieved here establishes scanning Josephson spectroscopy as a promising\ntechnique for the study of novel superconducting phases.\n", "  Two extrapolation models of the solar coronal magnetic field are compared\nusing magnetogram data from the SDO/HMI instrument. The two models, a\nhorizontal current-current sheet-source surface (HCCSSS) model and a potential\nfield-source surface (PFSS) model differ in their treatment of coronal\ncurrents. Each model has its own critical variable, respectively the radius of\na cusp surface and a source surface, and it is found that adjusting these\nheights over the period studied allows better fit between the models and the\nsolar open flux at 1 AU as calculated from the Interplanetary Magnetic Field\n(IMF). The HCCSSS model provides the better fit for the overall period from\n2010 November to 2015 May as well as for two subsets of the period - the\nminimum/rising part of the solar cycle, and the recently-identified peak in the\nIMF from mid-2014 to mid-2015 just after solar maximum. It is found that a\nHCCSSS cusp surface height of 1.7 Rsun provides the best fit to the IMF for the\noverall period, while 1.7 & 1.9 Rsun give the best fits for the two subsets.\nThe corresponding values for the PFSS source surface height are 2.1, 2.2 and\n2.0 Rsun respectively. This means that the HCCSSS cusp surface rises as the\nsolar cycle progresses while the PFSS source surface falls.\n", "  Fast electron beams (FEBs) are common products of solar active phenomena.\nSolar radio bursts are an important diagnostic tool in the understanding of\nFEBs as well as the solar plasma environment in which they are propagating\nalong solar magnetic fields. In particular, the evolutions of the energy\nspectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs due to the interaction with the\nambient plasma and field when propagating can significantly influence the\nefficiency and property of their emissions. In this paper, we discuss some\npossible evolutions of the energy spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs\ndue to the energy loss processes and the pitch-angle effect caused by the\nmagnetic field inhomogeneity, and analyze the effects of these evolutions on\nelectron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission, which is one of the most important\nmechanisms of producing solar radio bursts by FEBs. The results show that the\ngrowth rates all decrease with the energy loss factor $Q$, but increase with\nthe magnetic mirror ratio $\\sigma$ as well as with the steepness index\n$\\delta$. Moreover, the evolution of FEBs also can significantly influence the\nfastest growing mode and the fastest growing phase angle. This leads to the\nchange of the polarization sense of ECM emission. In particular, our results\nalso reveal that FEB that undergoes different evolution processes will generate\ndifferent types of ECM emission. We believe the present results to be very\nhelpful on more comprehensive understanding of dynamic spectra of solar radio\nbursts.\n", "  CO observations of the interacting galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are combined\nwith HI, Halpha and 24 microns to study the star formation rate (SFR) surface\ndensity as a function of the gas surface density. More than half of the high\nSFR regions are HI dominated. When compared to other galaxies, these\nHI-dominated regions have excess SFRs relative to their molecular gas surface\ndensities but normal SFRs relative to their total gas surface densities. The\nHI-dominated regions are mostly located in the outer part of NGC 2207, where\nthe HI velocity dispersion is high, 40 - 50 km/s. We suggest that the\nstar-forming clouds in these regions have envelopes at lower densities than\nnormal, making them predominantly atomic, and cores at higher densities than\nnormal because of the high turbulent Mach numbers. This is consistent with\ntheoretical predictions of a flattening in the density probability distribution\nfunction for compressive, high Mach number turbulence.\n", "  In this paper, we report the discovery of a binary composed of a brown dwarf\nand a low-mass M dwarf from the observation of the microlensing event\nOGLE-2014-BLG-0257. Resolution of the very short-lasting caustic crossing\ncombined with the detection of subtle continuous deviation in the lensing light\ncurve induced by the Earth's orbital motion enable us to precisely measure both\nthe Einstein radius \\theta_E and the lens parallax pi_E, which are the two\nquantities needed to unambiguously determine the mass and distance to the lens.\nIt is found that the companion is a substellar brown dwarf with a mass 0.036\n+/- 0.005 Msun (37.7 +/- 5.2\\ M_J) and it is orbiting an M dwarf with a mass\n0.19 +/- 0.02 Msun. The binary is located at a distance 1.25 +/- 0.13 kpc\ntoward the Galactic bulge and the projected separation between the binary\ncomponents is 0.61 +/- 0.07 AU. The separation scaled by the mass of the host\nis 3.2 AU/Msun. Under the assumption that separations scale with masses, then,\nthe discovered brown dwarf is located in the zone of the brown dwarf desert.\nWith the increasing sample of brown dwarfs existing in various environments,\nmicrolensing will provide a powerful probe of brown dwarfs in the Galaxy.\n", "  We conducted a high-sensitivity radio detection survey for forty narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 22\nGHz through phase-referencing long-time integration and using a newly\ndeveloping recorder with a data rate of 8 Gbps, which is a candidate of the\nnext generation VLBI data recording systems for the Japanese VLBI Network. The\nbaseline sensitivity was typically a few mJy. The observations resulted in a\ndetection rate of 12/40 for our radio-selected NLS1 sample; 11 out of the\ndetected 12 NLS1s showed inverted radio spectra between 1.4 and 22 GHz on the\nbasis of the Very Large Array flux densities and the VLBI detections. These\nhigh fractions suggest that a compact radio core with a high brightness\ntemperature is frequently associated with NLS1 nuclei. On the other hand, at\nleast half of the sample indicated apparently steep spectra even with the\nlimited VLBI sensitivity. Both the inverted and steep spectrum radio sources\nare included in the NLS1 population.\n", "  We extend the investigation of the Generalized Parton Distribution for a\ncharged pion within a fully covariant constituent quark model, in two respects:\n(i) calculating the tensor distribution and (ii) adding the treatment of the\nevolution, needed for achieving a meaningful comparison with both the\nexperimental parton distribution and the lattice evaluation of the so-called\ngeneralized form factors. Distinct features of our phenomenological covariant\nquark model are: (i) a 4D Ansatz for the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, to be\nused in the Mandelstam formula for matrix elements of the relevant current\noperators, and (ii) only two parameters, namely a quark mass assumed to hold\n$m_q=~220$ MeV and a free parameter fixed through the value of the pion decay\nconstant. The possibility of increasing the dynamical content of our covariant\nconstituent quark model is briefly discussed in the context of the Nakanishi\nintegral representation of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude.\n", "  A new type of instability that is expected to drive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence from a purely toroidal magnetic field in an accretion disk is\npresented. It is already known that in a differentially rotating system, the\nuniform toroidal magnetic field is unstable due to a magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) under a non-axisymmetric and vertical perturbation, while it\nis stable under a purely vertical perturbation. Contrary to the previous study,\nthis paper proposes an unstable mode completely confined to the equatorial\nplane, driven by the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure gradient force\nunder a non-uniform toroidal field. The basic nature of this growing eigenmode,\nto which we give a name \"magneto-gradient driven instability\", is studied using\nlinear analysis, and the corresponding nonlinear evolution is then investigated\nusing two-dimensional ideal MHD simulations. Although a single localized\nmagnetic field channel alone cannot provide sufficient Maxwell stress to\ncontribute significantly to the angular momentum transport, we find that the\nmode coupling between neighboring toroidal fields under multiple localized\nmagnetic field channels drastically generates a highly turbulent state and\nleads to the enhanced transport of angular momentum, comparable to the\nefficiency seen in previous studies on MRIs. This horizontally confined mode\nmay play an important role in the saturation of an MRI through complementray\ngrowth with the toroidal MHDs and coupling with magnetic reconnection.\n", "  Recent spectropolarimetric observations of active region filaments have\nrevealed polarization profiles with signatures typical of the strong field\nZeeman regime. The conspicuous absence in those observations of scattering\npolarization and Hanle effect signatures was then pointed out by some authors.\nThis was interpreted either as a signature of mixed \"turbulent\" field\ncomponents or as a result of optical thickness. In this article, we present a\nnatural scenario to explain these Zeeman-only spectro-polarimetric observations\nof active region filaments. We propose a two-component model, one on top of the\nother. Both components have horizontal fields, the azimuth difference between\nthem being close to 90 degrees. The component that lies lower in the atmosphere\nis permeated by a strong field of the order of 600 G, while the upper component\nhas much weaker fields, of the order of 10 G. The ensuing scattering\npolarization signatures of the individual components have opposite signs, so\nthat its combination along the line of sight reduces --and even can cancel\nout-- the Hanle signatures, giving rise to an apparent only-Zeeman profile.\nThis model is also applicable to other chromospheric structures seen in\nabsorption above active regions.\n", "  The standard closed-orbit theory is extended for the photodetachment of\nnegative ions in a time-dependent electric field. The time-dependent\nphotodetachment rate is specifically studied in the presence of a single-cycle\nterahertz pulse, based on exact quantum simulations and semiclassical analysis.\nWe find that the photodetachment rate is unaffected by a weak terahertz field,\nbut oscillates complicatedly when the terahertz pulse gets strong enough. Three\ntypes of closed classical orbits are identified for the photoelectron motion in\na strong single-cycle terahertz pulse, and their connections with the\noscillatory photodetachment rate are established quantitatively by generalizing\nthe standard closed-orbit theory to a time-dependent form. By comparing the\nnegative hydrogen and fluorine ions, both the in-phase and antiphase\noscillations can be observed, depending on a simple geometry of the contributed\nclosed classical orbits. On account of its generality, the presented theory\nprovides an intuitive understanding from a time-dependent viewpoint for the\nphotodetachment dynamics driven by an external electric field oscillating at\nlow frequency.\n", "  Three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constant admits\nstationary black holes that are not necessarily spherically symmetric. We\npropose boundary conditions for the near horizon region of these black holes\nthat lead to a surprisingly simple near horizon symmetry algebra consisting of\ntwo affine u(1) current algebras. The symmetry algebra is essentially\nequivalent to the Heisenberg algebra. The associated charges give a specific\nexample of \"soft hair\" on the horizon, as defined by Hawking, Perry and\nStrominger. We show that soft hair does not contribute to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes and \"black\nflower\" generalizations. From the near horizon perspective the conformal\ngenerators at asymptotic infinity appear as composite operators, which we\ninterpret in the spirit of black hole complementarity. Another remarkable\nfeature of our boundary conditions is that they are singled out by requiring\nthat the whole spectrum is compatible with regularity at the horizon,\nregardless the value of the global charges like mass or angular momentum.\nFinally, we address black hole microstates and generalizations to cosmological\nhorizons.\n", "  We quantify the contribution of Ly$\\alpha$ fluorescence to observed spatially\nextended Ly$\\alpha$ halos around Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAE) at redshift ${\\rm\nz=3.1}$. The key physical quantities that describe the fluorescent signal\ninclude (${\\it i}$) the distribution of cold gas in the circum-galactic medium\n(CGM); we explore simple analytical models and fitting functions to recent\nhydrodynamical simulations; (${\\it ii}$) local variations in the ionizing\nbackground due to ionizing sources that cluster around the central galaxy. We\naccount for clustering by boosting the observationally inferred volumetric\nproduction rate of ionizing photons, $\\epsilon_{\\rm LyC}$, by a factor of\n$1+\\xi_{\\rm LyC}(r)$, in which $\\xi_{\\rm LyC}(r)$ quantifies the clustering of\nionizing sources around the central galaxy. We compute $\\xi_{\\rm LyC}(r)$ by\nassigning an 'effective' bias parameter to the ionizing sources. This novel\napproach allows us to quantify our ignorance of the population of ionizing\nsources in a simple parametrized form. We find a maximum enhancement in the\nlocal ionizing background in the range $50-200$ at $r \\sim 10$ physical kpc.\nFor spatially uncorrelated ionizing sources and fluorescing clouds we find that\nfluorescence can contribute up to $\\sim 50-60\\%$ of the observed spatially\nextended Ly$\\alpha$ emission. We briefly discuss how future observations can\nshed light on the nature of Ly$\\alpha$ halos around star forming galaxies.\n", "  We present the stellar mass ($M_{*}$)--gas-phase metallicity relation (MZR)\nand its scatter at intermediate redshifts ($0.5\\leq z\\leq0.7$) for 1381 field\ngalaxies collected from deep spectroscopic surveys. The star formation rate\n(SFR) and color at a given $M_{*}$ of this magnitude-limited ($R\\lesssim24$ AB)\nsample are representative of normal star-forming galaxies. For masses below\n$10^9 M_\\odot$, our sample of 237 galaxies is $\\sim$10 times larger than those\nin previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size\nenables superior constraints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime.\nWe find a power-law MZR at $10^{8} M_\\odot < M_{*} < 10^{11} M_\\odot$:\n${12+log(O/H) = (5.83\\pm0.19) + (0.30\\pm0.02)log(M_{*}/M_\\odot)}$. Our MZR\nshows good agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the\nliterature in the intermediate and massive regimes, but is shallower than the\nextrapolation of the MZRs of others to masses below $10^{9} M_\\odot$. The SFR\ndependence of the MZR in our sample is weaker than that found for local\ngalaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation). Compared to a variety\nof theoretical models, the slope of our MZR for low-mass galaxies agrees well\nwith predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust\nagainst currently uncertain metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the MZR\nserves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas accretion, gas\nrecycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that\nthe scatter of our MZR increases as $M_{*}$ decreases. Our result implies that\neither the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate or the scatter of the\n$M_{*}$--$M_{halo}$ relation increases as $M_{*}$ decreases. Moreover, our\nmeasures of scatter at $z=0.7$ appears consistent with that found for local\ngalaxies.\n", "  We report observations of bright dots (BDs) in a sunspot penumbra using High\nResolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) data in 193 \\AA\\ and examine their sizes,\nlifetimes, speeds, and intensities. The sizes of the BDs are on the order of\n1\\arcsec\\ and are therefore hard to identify in the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) 193 \\AA\\ images, which have 1.2\\arcsec\\ spatial resolution, but\nbecome readily apparent with Hi-C's five times better spatial resolution. We\nsupplement Hi-C data with data from AIA's 193 \\AA\\ passband to see the complete\nlifetime of the BDs that appeared before and/or lasted longer than Hi-C's\n3-minute observation period. Most Hi-C BDs show clear lateral movement along\npenumbral striations, toward or away from the sunspot umbra. Single BDs often\ninteract with other BDs, combining to fade away or brighten. The BDs that do\nnot interact with other BDs tend to have smaller displacements. These BDs are\nabout as numerous but move slower on average than Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS) BDs, recently reported by \\cite{tian14}, and the sizes and\nlifetimes are on the higher end of the distribution of IRIS BDs. Using\nadditional AIA passbands, we compare the lightcurves of the BDs to test whether\nthe Hi-C BDs have transition region (TR) temperature like that of the IRIS BDs.\nThe lightcurves of most Hi-C BDs peak together in different AIA channels\nindicating that their temperature is likely in the range of the cooler TR\n($1-4\\times 10^5$ K).\n", "  We use a radio-frequency $^{85}$Rb alkali-vapor cell magnetometer based on a\nparaffin-coated cell with long spin-coherence time and a small, low-inductance\ndriving coil to create highly resolved conductivity maps of different objects.\nWe resolve sub-mm features in conductive objects, we characterize the frequency\nresponse of our technique, and by operating at frequencies up to 250 kHz we are\nable to discriminate between differently conductive materials based on the\ninduced response. The method is suited to cover a wide range of driving\nfrequencies and can potentially be used for detecting non-metallic objects with\nlow DC conductivity.\n", "  The fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave in plate-like structures is\nextremely useful for non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health\nmonitoring (SHM) as it is non-dispersive. However, currently the SH0 wave is\nusually excited by electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) whose energy\nconversion efficiency is fairly low. The face-shear (d36) mode piezoelectrics\nis more promising for SH0 wave excitation but this mode cannot appear in\nconventional piezoelectric ceramics. Recently, by modifying the symmetry of\npoled PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT) ceramics via ferroelastic domain engineering, we\nrealized the face-shear d36 mode in both soft and hard PZT ceramics. In this\nwork, we further improved the face-shear properties of PZT-4 and PZT-5H\nceramics via lateral compression under elevated temperature. It was found that\nwhen bonded on a 1 mm-thick aluminum plate, the d36 type PZT-4 exhibited better\nface-shear performance than PZT-5H. We then successfully excite SH0 wave in the\naluminum plate using a face-shear PZT-4 square patch and receive the wave using\na face-shear PMN-PT patch. The frequency response and directionality of the\nexcited SH0 wave were also investigated. The SH0 wave can be dominate over the\nLamb waves (S0 and A0 waves) from 160 kHz to 280 kHz. The wave amplitude\nreaches its maxima along the two main directions (0{\\deg} and 90{\\deg}). The\namplitude can keep over 80% of the maxima when the deviate angle is less than\n30{\\deg}, while it vanishes quickly at the 45{\\deg} direction. The excited SH0\nwave using piezoelectric ceramics could be very promising in the fields of NDT\nand SHM.\n", "  We use the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Cycle 1 to\ndetermine spectroscopic redshifts of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies\n(DSFGs) selected by their 1.4mm continuum emission in the South Pole Telescope\n(SPT) survey. We present ALMA 3mm spectral scans between 84-114GHz for 15\ngalaxies and targeted ALMA 1mm observations for an additional eight sources.\nOur observations yield 30 new line detections from CO, [CI] , [NII] , H_2O and\nNH_3. We further present APEX [CII] and CO mid-J observations for seven sources\nfor which only a single line was detected in spectral-scan data from ALMA Cycle\n0 or Cycle 1. We combine the new observations with previously published and new\nmm/submm line and photometric data of the SPT-selected DSFGs to study their\nredshift distribution. The combined data yield 39 spectroscopic redshifts from\nmolecular lines, a success rate of >85%. Our sample represents the largest data\nset of its kind today and has the highest spectroscopic completeness among all\nredshift surveys of high-z DSFGs. The median of the redshift distribution is\nz=3.9+/-0.4, and the highest-redshift source in our sample is at z=5.8. We\ndiscuss how the selection of our sources affects the redshift distribution,\nfocusing on source brightness, selection wavelength, and strong gravitational\nlensing. We correct for the effect of gravitational lensing and find the\nredshift distribution for 1.4mm-selected sources with a median redshift of\nz=3.1+/-0.3. Comparing to redshift distributions selected at shorter\nwavelengths from the literature, we show that selection wavelength affects the\nshape of the redshift distribution.\n", "  We investigate a model of hard-core bosons with correlated hopping on the\nhoneycomb lattice in an external magnetic field by means of a coupled-wire\napproach. It has been numerically shown that this model exhibits at half\nfilling the bosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) state, which is a\nsymmetry-protected topological phase protected by the $U(1)$ particle\nconservation [Y.-C. He et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 116803 (2015)]. By\ncombining the bosonization approach and a coupled-wire construction, we\nanalytically confirm this finding and show that it even holds in the strongly\nanisotropic (quasi-one-dimensional) limit. We discuss the stability of the BIQH\nphase against tunneling that break the separate particle conservations on\ndifferent sublattices down to a global particle conservation. We further argue\nthat a phase transition between two different BIQH phases is in a deconfined\nquantum critical point described by two copies of the (2+1)-dimensional $O(4)$\nnonlinear sigma model with the topological $\\theta$ term at $\\theta=\\pi$.\nFinally we predict a possible fractional quantum Hall state, the Halperin (221)\nstate, at 1/6 filling.\n", "  We propose the left-right models based on SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(M)_L \\otimes\nSU(N)_R \\otimes U(1)_X gauge symmetry for (M,N)=(3,3), (2,3), and (3,2) that\naddress the 750 GeV diphoton excess recently reported by the LHC. The fermion\ncontents are minimally introduced, and the generation number must match the\nfundamental color number to cancel anomalies and ensure QCD asymptotic freedom.\nThe diphoton excess arises from the field that breaks the left-right symmetry\nspontaneously in the first model, while for the last models it emerges as an\nexplicit violation of the left-right symmetry. The neutrino masses,\nflavor-changing neutral currents, and new boson searches are also discussed.\n", "  Stagnation of a cold plasma streaming to the center or axis of symmetry via\nan expanding accretion shock wave is ubiquitous in inertial confinement fusion\n(ICF) and high-energy-density plasma physics, the examples ranging from plasma\nflows in x-ray-generating Z pinches [Y. Maron et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n035001 (2013)] to the experiments in support of the recently suggested concept\nof impact ignition in ICF [H. Azechi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 235002\n(2009); M. Murakami et al., Nucl. Fusion 54, 054007 (2014)]. Some experimental\nevidence indicates that stagnation via an expanding shock wave is stable, but\nits stability has never been studied theoretically. We present such analysis\nfor the stagnation that does not involve a rarefaction wave behind the\nexpanding shock front and is described by the classic ideal-gas Noh solution in\nspherical and cylindrical geometry. In either case the stagnated flow has been\ndemonstrated to be stable, initial perturbations exhibiting a power-law,\noscillatory or monotonic, decay with time for all the eigenmodes. This\nconclusion has been supported by our simulations done both on a Cartesian grid\nand on a curvilinear grid in spherical coordinates. Dispersion equation\ndetermining the eigenvalues of the problem and explicit formulas for the\neigenfunction profiles corresponding to these eigenvalues are presented, making\nit possible to use the theory for hydro code verification in two and three\ndimensions.\n", "  Many real-world complex systems across natural, social, and economical\ndomains consist of manifold layers to form multiplex networks. The multiple\nnetwork layers give rise to nonlinear effect for the emergent dynamics of\nsystems. Especially, weak layers that can potentially play significant role in\namplifying the vulnerability of multiplex networks might be shadowed in the\naggregated single-layer network framework which indiscriminately accumulates\nall layers. Here we present a simple model of cascading failure on multiplex\nnetworks of weight-heterogeneous layers. By simulating the model on the\nmultiplex network of international trades, we found that the multiplex model\nproduces more catastrophic cascading failures which are the result of emergent\ncollective effect of coupling layers, rather than the simple sum thereof.\nTherefore risks can be systematically underestimated in single-layer network\nanalyses because the impact of weak layers can be overlooked. We anticipate\nthat our simple theoretical study can contribute to further investigation and\ndesign of optimal risk-averse real-world complex systems.\n", "  The metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are benchmark systems\nfor studying and controlling intertwined electronic orders in solids, with\nsuperconductivity developing upon cooling from a charge density wave state. The\ninterplay between such phases is thought to play a critical role in the\nunconventional superconductivity of cuprates, Fe-based, and heavy-fermion\nsystems, yet even for the more moderately-correlated TMDCs, their nature and\norigins have proved highly controversial. Here, we study a prototypical\nexample, $2H$-NbSe$_2$, by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission and\nfirst-principles theory. We find that the normal state, from which its hallmark\ncollective phases emerge, is characterised by quasiparticles whose spin is\nlocked to their valley pseudospin. This results from a combination of strong\nspin-orbit interactions and local inversion symmetry breaking. Non-negligible\ninterlayer coupling further drives a rich three-dimensional momentum-dependence\nof the underlying Fermi surface spin texture. Together, these findings\nnecessitate a fundamental re-investigation of the nature of charge order and\nsuperconducting pairing in NbSe$_2$ and related TMDCs.\n", "  Globular Clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way are the primary laboratories for\nestablishing the ages of the oldest stellar populations and for measuring the\ncolor-magnitude relation of stars. In infrared (IR) color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs), the stellar main sequence (MS) exhibits a \"kink\", due to opacity\neffects in M dwarfs, such that lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer in the\nIR color baseline. This diagnostic offers a new opportunity to model GC CMDs\nand to reduce uncertainties on cluster properties (e.g., their derived ages).\nIn this context, we analyzed Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 IR\narchival observations of four GCs - 47Tuc, M4, NGC2808, and NGC6752 - for which\nthe data are deep enough to fully sample the low-mass MS, reaching at least ~ 2\nmag below the \"kink\". We derived the fiducial lines for each cluster and\ncompared them with a grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space,\nallowing age, metallicity, distance, and reddening to vary within reasonable\nselected ranges. The derived ages for the four clusters are respectively 11.6,\n11.5, 11.2, and 12.1 Gyr and their random uncertainties are \\sigma ~ 0.7 - 1.1\nGyr. Our results suggest that the near-IR MS \"kink\", combined with the MS\nturn-off, provides a valuable tool to measure GC ages and offers a promising\nopportunity to push the absolute age of GCs to sub-Gyr accuracy with the next\ngeneration IR telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.\n", "  We present a sample of local analogs for high-redshift galaxies selected in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The physical conditions of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) in these local analogs resemble those in\nhigh-redshift galaxies. These galaxies are selected based on their positions in\nthe [OIII]/H$\\beta$ versus [NII]/H$\\alpha$ nebular emission-line diagnostic\ndiagram. We show that these local analogs share similar physical properties\nwith high-redshift galaxies, including high specific star formation rates\n(sSFRs), flat UV continuums and compact galaxy sizes. In particular, the\nionization parameters and electron densities in these analogs are comparable to\nthose in $z\\simeq2-3$ galaxies, but higher than those in normal SDSS galaxies\nby $\\simeq$0.6~dex and $\\simeq$0.9~dex, respectively. The mass-metallicity\nrelation (MZR) in these local analogs shows $-0.2$~dex offset from that in SDSS\nstar-forming galaxies at the low mass end, which is consistent with the MZR of\nthe $z\\sim2-3$ galaxies. We compare the local analogs in this study with those\nin other studies, including Lyman break analogs (LBA) and green pea (GP)\ngalaxies. The analogs in this study share a similar star formation surface\ndensity with LBAs, but the ionization parameters and electron densities in our\nanalogs are higher than those in LBAs by factors of 1.5 and 3, respectively.\nThe analogs in this study have comparable ionization parameter and electron\ndensity to the GP galaxies, but our method can select galaxies in a wider\nredshift range. We find the high sSFR and SFR surface density can increase the\nelectron density and ionization parameters, but still cannot fully explain the\ndifference in ISM condition between nearby galaxies and the local\nanalogs/high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) stars are relatively short\nlived (less than a few Myr), yet their cool effective temperatures, high\nluminosities, efficient mass-loss and dust production can dramatically effect\nthe chemical enrichment histories and the spectral energy distributions of\ntheir host galaxies. The ability to accurately model TP-AGB stars is critical\nto the interpretation of the integrated light of distant galaxies, especially\nin redder wavelengths. We continue previous efforts to constrain the evolution\nand lifetimes of TP-AGB stars by modeling their underlying stellar populations.\nUsing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and near-infrared photometry taken\nof 12 fields of 10 nearby galaxies imaged via the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey\nTreasury and the near-infrared HST/SNAP follow-up campaign, we compare the\nmodel and observed TP-AGB luminosity functions as well as the number ratio of\nTP-AGB to red giant branch stars. We confirm the best-fitting mass-loss\nprescription, introduced by Rosenfield et al. 2014, in which two different wind\nregimes are active during the TP-AGB, significantly improves models of many\ngalaxies that show evidence of recent star formation. This study extends\nprevious efforts to constrain TP-AGB lifetimes to metallicities ranging -1.59 <\n[Fe/H] < -0.56 and initial TP-AGB masses up to ~ 4 Msun, which include TP-AGB\nstars that undergo hot-bottom burning.\n", "  Solar prominences are long-lived cool and dense plasma curtains in the hot\nand rarefied outer solar atmosphere or corona. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for their formation and especially for their internal plasma\ncirculation has been uncertain for decades. The observed ubiquitous down flows\nin quiescent prominences are difficult to interpret as plasma with high\nconductivity seems to move across horizontal magnetic field lines. Here we\npresent three-dimensional numerical simulations of prominence formation and\nevolution in an elongated magnetic flux rope as a result of in-situ plasma\ncondensations fueled by continuous plasma evaporation from the solar\nchromosphere. The prominence is born and maintained in a fragmented, highly\ndynamic state with continuous reappearance of multiple blobs and thread\nstructures that move mainly downward dragging along mass-loaded field lines.\nThe prominence plasma circulation is characterized by the dynamic balance\nbetween the drainage of prominence plasma back to the chromosphere and the\nformation of prominence plasma via continuous condensation. Plasma evaporates\nfrom the chromosphere, condenses into the prominence in the corona, and drains\nback to the chromosphere, establishing a stable chromosphere-corona plasma\ncycle. Synthetic images of the modeled prominence with the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly closely resemble actual observations,\nwith many dynamical threads underlying an elliptical coronal cavity.\n", "  We introduce a new class of representations of the cohomological Hall\nalgebras of Kontsevich and Soibelman, which we call cohomological Hall modules,\nor CoHM for short. These representations are constructed from self-dual\nrepresentations of a quiver with contravariant involution $\\sigma$ and provide\na mathematical model for the space of BPS states in orientifold string theory.\nWe use the CoHM to define a generalization of the cohomological\nDonaldson-Thomas theory of quivers which allows the quiver representations to\nhave orthogonal and symplectic structure groups. The associated invariants are\ncalled orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We prove the integrality\nconjecture for orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants of $\\sigma$-symmetric\nquivers. We also formulate precise conjectures regarding the geometric meaning\nof these invariants and the freeness of the CoHM of a $\\sigma$-symmetric\nquiver. We prove the freeness conjecture for disjoint union quivers, loop\nquivers and the affine Dynkin quiver of type $\\widetilde{A}_1$. We also verify\nthe geometric conjecture in a number of examples. Finally, we describe the CoHM\nof finite type quivers by constructing explicit Poincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt type\nbases of these representations.\n", "  We actively stabilize the harmonic oscillation frequency of a laser-cooled\natomic ion confined in a rf Paul trap by sampling and rectifying the high\nvoltage rf applied to the trap electrodes. We are able to stabilize the 1 MHz\natomic oscillation frequency to better than 10 Hz, or 10 ppm. This represents a\nsuppression of ambient noise on the rf circuit by 34 dB. This technique could\nimpact the sensitivity of ion trap mass spectrometry and the fidelity of\nquantum operations in ion trap quantum information applications.\n", "  We present a deep centimeter-wavelength catalog of the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC), based on a 30h single-pointing observation with the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array in its high-resolution A-configuration using two 1 GHz bands\ncentered at 4.7 GHz and 7.3 GHz. A total of 556 compact sources were detected\nin a map with a nominal rms noise of 3 muJy/bm, limited by complex source\nstructure and the primary beam response. Compared to previous catalogs, our\ndetections increase the sample of known compact radio sources in the ONC by\nmore than a factor of seven. The new data show complex emission on a wide range\nof spatial scales. Following a preliminary correction for the wideband\nprimary-beam response, we determine radio spectral indices for 170 sources\nwhose index uncertainties are less than +/-0.5. We compare the radio to the\nX-ray and near-infrared point-source populations, noting similarities and\ndifferences.\n", "  Explicitly-correlated F12 methods are becoming the first choice for\nhigh-accuracy molecular orbital calculations, and can often achieve chemical\naccuracy with relatively small gaussian basis sets. In most calculations, the\nmany three- and four-electron integrals that formally appear in the theory are\navoided through judicious use of resolutions of the identity (RI). However, in\norder not to jeopardize the intrinsic accuracy of the F12 wave function, the\nassociated RI auxiliary basis set must be large. Here, inspired by the\nHead-Gordon-Pople (HGP) and PRISM algorithms for two-electron integrals, we\npresent an algorithm to compute directly three-electron integrals over gaussian\nbasis functions and a very general class of three-electron operators, without\ninvoking RI approximations. A general methodology to derive vertical, transfer\nand horizontal recurrence relations is also presented.\n", "  We have measured the sky-projected spin-orbit alignments for three transiting\nHot Jupiters, WASP-103b, WASP-87b, and WASP-66b, using spectroscopic\nmeasurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, with the CYCLOPS2 optical-fiber\nbundle system feeding the UCLES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.\nThe resulting sky projected spin-orbit angles of $\\lambda =\n3^{\\circ}\\pm33^{\\circ}$, $\\lambda = -8^{\\circ}\\pm11^{\\circ}$, and $\\lambda =\n-4^{\\circ}\\pm22^{\\circ}$ for WASP-103b, WASP-87b, and WASP-66b, respectively,\nsuggest that these three planets are likely on nearly aligned orbits with\nrespect to their host star's spin axis. WASP-103 is a particularly interesting\nsystem as its orbital distance is only 20% larger than its host star's Roche\nradius and the planet likely experiences strong tidal effects. WASP-87 and\nWASP-66 are hot ($T_{eff}=6450\\pm120$ K and $T_{eff}=6600\\pm150$ K,\nrespectively) mid-F stars making them similar to the majority of stars hosting\nplanets on high obliquity orbits. Moderate spin-orbit misalignments for\nWASP-103b and WASP-66b are consistent with our data, but polar and retrograde\norbits are not favored for these systems.\n", "  We present the results obtained with MUSE on the core of the lensing cluster\nA1689. Integral-field observations with MUSE provide a unique view of the\ncentral region, allowing us to conduct a complete census on both cluster\ngalaxies and lensed background sources, identified based on their spectral\nfeatures without preselection. We investigate the multiple-image configuration\nfor all known sources in the field. Previous to our survey, 28 different lensed\ngalaxies displaying 46 multiple images were known in the MUSE field of view,\nmost of them based on photometric redshifts and lensing considerations. Among\nthem, we spectroscopically confirm 12 images based on their emission-lines,\ncorresponding to 7 different lensed galaxies between z = 0.95 and 5.0. In\naddition, 14 new galaxies have been spectroscopically identified in this area,\nwith redshifts ranging between 0.8 and 6.2. All background sources within the\nMUSE field of view correspond to multiple-imaged systems lensed by A1689. 17\nsources in total are found at z > 3 based on their Lyman-alpha emission, with\nLyman-alpha luminosities ranging between 40.5 < log(Ly{\\alpha}) < 42.5 after\ncorrection for magnification. This sample is particularly sensitive to the\nslope of the LF toward the faintest-end. The density of sources obtained in\nthis survey is consistent with a steep value of {\\alpha} < -1.5, although this\nresult still needs further investigation. These results illustrate the\nefficiency of MUSE in the characterization of lensing clusters on one hand, and\nthe study of faint and distant populations of galaxies on the other hand. In\nparticular, our current survey of lensing clusters should provide a unique\ncensus of sources responsible for the reionization in a representative volume\nat z ~ 4-7.\n", "  NGC 2264-C is a high-mass protocluster where several star-formation events\nare known to have occurred. To investigate whether past protostellar activity\nhas left a chemical imprint in this region, we mapped it in SiO($J = 2-1$), a\nshock tracer, and several other molecular lines with the Nobeyama 45 m\ntelescope. Our observations show the presence of a complex network of\nprotostellar outflows. The strongest SiO emission lies beyond a radius of $\\sim\n0.1$ pc with respect to the center of the clump, and is characterized by broad\n($> 10$ km s$^{-1}$) lines and abundances of $\\sim 1.4 \\times 10^{-8}$ with\nrespect to H$_2$. Interestingly, SiO appears relatively depleted\n($\\chi_\\mathrm{SiO} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{-9}$) within this radius, despite it\nbeing affected by molecular outflow activity. We attribute this to fast\ncondensation of SiO back onto dust grains and/or rapid gas-phase destruction of\nSiO, favored by the high density present in this area ($> 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$).\nFinally, we identify a peripheral, narrow-line ($\\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$)\ncomponent, where SiO has an abundance of a few times 10$^{-11}$. After\nconsidering different options, we conclude that this weak emission may be\ntracing protostellar shocks from the star formation episode that preceded the\ncurrent one, which have decelerated over time and eventually resulted in SiO\nbeing largely depleted/destroyed. Alternatively, a population of unresolved\nlow-mass protostars may be responsible for the narrow SiO emission.\nHigh-angular resolution observations are necessary to distinguish between these\ntwo possibilities and thus understand the role of SiO as a chemical tracer of\npast star-formation episodes in massive protoclusters.\n", "  On November 12, 2014, the ESA/Rosetta descent module Philae landed on the\nAbydos site of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Aboard this module, the Ptolemy\nmass spectrometer measured a CO/CO2 ratio of 0.07 +/- 0.04 which differs\nsubstantially from the value obtained in the coma by the Rosetta/ROSINA\ninstrument, suggesting a heterogeneity in the comet nucleus. To understand this\ndifference, we investigated the physico-chemical properties of the Abydos\nsubsurface leading to CO/CO2 ratios close to that observed by Ptolemy at the\nsurface of this region. We used a comet nucleus model that takes into account\ndifferent water ice phase changes (amorphous ice, crystalline ice and\nclathrates), as well as diffusion of molecules throughout the pores of the\nmatrix. The input parameters of the model were optimized for the Abydos site\nand the ROSINA CO/CO2 measured ratio is assumed to correspond to the bulk value\nin the nucleus. We find that all considered structures of water ice are able to\nreproduce the Ptolemy observation with a time difference not exceeding ~50\ndays, i.e. lower than ~2% on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's orbital period. The\nsuspected heterogeneity of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's nucleus is also found\npossible only if it is constituted of crystalline ices. If the icy phase is\nmade of amorphous ice or clathrates, the difference between Ptolemy and\nROSINA's measurements would rather originate from the spatial variations in\nillumination on the nucleus surface. An eventual new measurement of the CO/CO2\nratio at Abydos by Ptolemy could be decisive to distinguish between the three\nwater ice structures.\n", "  We calculate the first two moments and full probability distribution of the\nwork performed on a system of bosonic particles in a two-mode Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian when the self-interaction term is varied instantaneously or with a\nfinite-time ramp. In the instantaneous case, we show how the irreversible work\nscales differently depending on whether the system is driven to the Josephson\nor Fock regime of the bosonic Josephson junction. In the finite-time case, we\nuse optimal control techniques to substantially decrease the irreversible work\nto negligible values. Our analysis can be implemented in present-day\nexperiments with ultracold atoms and we show how to relate the work statistics\nto that of the population imbalance of the two modes.\n", "  We make predictions for the cross sections of diffractive dijet\nphotoproduction in $pp$, $pA$ and $AA$ ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the\nLHC during Runs 1 and 2 using next-to-leading perturbative QCD. We find that\nthe resulting cross sections are sufficiently large and, compared to\nlepton-proton scattering at HERA, have an enhanced sensitivity to small\nobserved momentum fractions in the diffractive exchange, commonly denoted\n$z_{P}^{\\rm jets}$, and an unprecedented reach in the invariant mass of the\nphoton-nucleon system $W$. We examine two competing schemes of diffractive QCD\nfactorization breaking, which assume either a global suppression factor or a\nsuppression for resolved photons only and demonstrate that the two scenarios\ncan be distinguished by the nuclear dependence of the distributions in the\nobserved parton momentum fraction in the photon $x_{\\gamma}^{\\rm jets}$.\n", "  The recent interest in a light gauge boson in the framework of an extra U(1)\nsymmetry motivates searches in the mass range below 1 GeV.\n  We present a search for such a particle, the dark photon, in ${\\rm e^+\ne^-}\\rightarrow {\\rm U}\\gamma$, U$\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$ based on 28 million\n$\\mathrm{e^+ e^-} \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^-\\gamma$ events collected at DA$\\Phi$NE\nby the KLOE experiment. The $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ production by initial-state radiation\ncompensates for a loss of sensitivity of previous KLOE ${\\rm U} \\rightarrow\n\\mathrm{e^+ e^-}$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ searches due to the small branching ratios in\nthe $\\rho-\\omega$ resonance region. We found no evidence for a signal and set a\nlimit at 90\\% CL on the mixing strength between the photon and the dark photon,\n$\\varepsilon^2$, in the U mass range between $527$ and $987$~MeV. Above 700 MeV\nthis new limit is more stringent than previous ones.\n", "  The extension of the corona of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) is under\ndiscussion. The standard model of magnetic configuration of CTTS predicts that\ncoronal magnetic flux tubes connect the stellar atmosphere to the inner region\nof the disk. However, differential rotation may disrupt these long loops. The\nresults from Hydrodynamic modeling of X-ray flares observed in CTTS confirming\nthe star-disk connection hypothesis are still controversial. Some authors\nsuggest the presence of the accretion disk prevent the stellar corona to extent\nbeyond the co-rotation radius, while others simply are not confident with the\nmethods used to derive loop lengths. We use independent procedures to determine\nthe length of flaring loops in stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster previously\nanalyzed using Hydrodynamic models. Our aim is to disentangle between the two\nscenarios proposed. We present a different approach to determine the length of\nflaring loops based on the oscillatory nature of the loops after strong flares.\nWe use wavelet tools to reveal oscillations during several flares. The\nsubsequent analysis of such oscillations is settle on the Physics of coronal\nseismology. Our results likely confirm the large extension of the corona of\nCTTS and the hypothesis of star-disk magnetic interaction in at least three\nCTTS of the Orion Nebula Cluster. Analyzing oscillations in flaring events is a\npowerful tool to determine the physical characteristics of magnetic loops in\ncoronae in stars other than the Sun. The results presented in this work confirm\nthe star-disk magnetic connection in CTTS.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of the Si I infrared (IR) lines as Si\nabundance indicators for giant stars. We find that Si abundances obtained from\nthe Si I IR lines based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis\nshow large line-to-line scatter (mean value of 0.13dex), and are higher than\nthose from the optical lines. However, when the non-LTE effects are taken into\naccount, the line-to-line scatter reduces significantly (mean value of\n0.06dex), and the Si abundances are consistent with those from the optical\nlines. The typical average non-LTE correction of [Si/Fe] for our sample stars\nis about $-$0.35dex. Our results demonstrate that the Si I IR lines could be\nreliable abundance indicators provided that the non-LTE effects are properly\ntaken into account.\n", "  We discuss the influence of a rapid thermal annealing step on the\nmagneto-optical emission properties of In(Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots. We map out a\nstrong influence of the growth- and anneling parameters on the quantum\nexcitons' effective Land\\'e g-factors and in particular on their diamagnetic\ncoefficients, which we directly correlate with the modification of the emitters\nshape and material composition. In addition, we study the excitons' spontaneous\nemission lifetime as a function of the annealing temperature and the dot\nheight, and observe a strong increase of the emission rate with the quantum dot\nvolume. The corresponding increase in oscillator strenth yields fully\nconsistent results with the analysis of the diamagenic behavior. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that a rapid thermal annealing step of 850$^\\circ$ C can be\nemployed to increase the oscillator strength of as-grown InAs/GaAs QDs by more\nthan a factor of $2$.\n", "  Much of astrophysics consists of the study of ionised gas under the influence\nof gravitational and magnetic fields. Thus, it is not possible to understand\nthe astrophysical universe without a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of\nmagnetised fluids. Fluid dynamics is, however, a notoriously tricky subject, in\nwhich it is all too easy for one's a priori intuition to go astray. In this\nreview, we seek to guide the reader through a series of illuminating yet\ndeceptive problems, all with an enlightening twist. We cover a broad range of\ntopics including the instabilities acting in accretion discs, the hydrodynamics\ngoverning the convective zone of the Sun, the magnetic shielding of a cooling\ngalaxy cluster, and the behaviour of thermal instabilities and evaporating\nclouds. The aim of this review is to surprise and intrigue even veteran\nastrophysical theorists with an idiosynchratic choice of problems and\ncounterintuitive results. At the same time, we endeavour to bring forth the\nfundamental ideas, to set out important assumptions, and to describe carefully\nwhatever novel techniques may be appropriate to the problem at hand. By\nbeginning at the beginning, and analysing a wide variety of astrophysical\nsettings, we seek not only to make this review suitable for fluid dynamic\nveterans, but to engage novice recruits as well with what we hope will be an\nunusual and instructive introduction to the subject.\n", "  The CoRoT space telescope observed nearly 160 000 light curves. Among the\nmost outstanding is that of the young, active planet host star CoRoT-2A. In\naddition to deep planetary transits, the light curve of CoRoT-2A shows strong\nrotational variability and a superimposed beating pattern. To study the stars\nthat produce such an intriguing pattern of photometric variability, we\nidentified a sample of eight stars with rotation periods between 0.8 and 11\ndays and photometric variability amplitudes of up to 7.5 %, showing a similar\nCoRoT light curve. We also obtained high-resolution follow-up spectroscopy with\nTNG/SARG and carried out a spectral analysis with SME and MOOG. We find that\nthe color dependence of the light curves is consistent with rotational\nmodulation due to starspots and that latitudinal differential rotation provides\na viable explanation for the light curves, although starspot evolution is also\nexpected to play an important role. Our MOOG and SME spectral analyses provide\nconsistent results, showing that the targets are dwarf stars with spectral\ntypes between F and mid-K. Detectable Li i absorption in four of the targets\nconfirms a low age of 100-400 Myr also deduced from gyrochronology. Our study\nindicates that the photometric beating phenomenon is likely attributable to\ndifferential rotation in fast-rotating stars with outer convection zones.\n", "  Despite very high temperatures accompanying lunar origin, indigenous water in\nthe form of OH has been unambiguously observed in Apollo samples in recent\nyears. Such observations have prompted questions about the abundance and\ndistribution of lunar hydrogen. Here, we investigate the related question of\nthe origin of lunar H: is the hydrogen observed a remnant of a much larger\ninitial inventory that was inherited from a wet Earth but partly depleted\nduring the process of origin, or was hydrogen quantitatively lost from the\nlunar material, with water being delivered to lunar reservoirs via subsequent\nimpacts after the origins sequence? Motivated by recent results pointing to a\nlimited extent of hydrogen escape from the gravity field of the Earth during\nlunar origin, we apply a newly developed thermodynamic model of liquid-vapor\nsilicates to the proto-lunar disk to interrogate the behavior of H as a trace\nelement in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. We find that: (1)\npre-existing H-bearing molecules are rapidly dissociated at the temperatures\nconsidered (3,100-4,200 K) and vaporized hydrogen predominantly exists as\nOH(v), H(v) and MgOH(v) for nearly the full range of thermal states encountered\nin the proto-lunar disk, (2) despite such a diversity in the vapor speciation,\nwhich reduces the water fugacity and favors hydrogen exsolution from\nco-existing liquids, the equilibration of the vapor atmosphere with the disk\nliquid results in significant dissolution of H into proto-lunar magmas, and (3)\nequilibrium H isotopic fractionation in this setting is limited to < 10 per mil\nand the terrestrial character of lunar D/H recently inferred should extend to\nsuch a precision if liquid-vapor equilibration in the proto-lunar disk is the\nprocess that gave rise to lunar hydrogen. Taken together, these results\nimplicate dissolution as the process responsible for establishing lunar H\nabundances.\n", "  By incorporating a multilayer network and time-decaying memory into the\noriginal voter model, the coupled effects of spatial and temporal cumulation of\npeer pressure on consensus are investigated. Heterogeneity in peer pressure and\ntime-decaying mechanism are both found to be detrimental to consensus. The\ntransition points, below which a consensus can always be reached and above\nwhich two opposed opinions are more likely to coexist, are found. A mean-field\nanalysis indicates that the phase transitions in the present model are governed\nby the cumulative influence of peer pressure and the updating threshold. A\nfunctional relation between the consensus threshold and the decaying rate of\nthe influence of peer pressure is found. As to the time to reach a consensus,\nit is governed by the coupling of the memory length and the decaying rate. An\nintermediate decaying rate may lead to much lower time to reach a consensus.\n", "  We revisit the derivation of the Hawking-Moss transition rate. Using the\nstatic coordinates, we show that the Euclidean action is entirely determined by\nthe contribution of the entropy of de Sitter space which is proportional to the\nsurface area of the horizon. This holographic feature is common to any static\nspacetime with a horizon on which the shift vector vanishes.\n", "  In the outer heliosphere, beyond the solar wind termination shock, it is\nexpected that the warped heliospheric current sheet forms a region of\nclosely-packed, multiple, thin current sheets. Such a system may be subject to\nthe ion-kinetic tearing instability, and hence generate magnetic islands and\nhot populations of ions associated with magnetic reconnection. Reconnection\nprocesses in this environment have important implications for local particle\ntransport, and for particle acceleration at reconnection sites and in\nturbulence. We study this complex environment by means of three-dimensional\nhybrid simulations over long time scales, in order to capture the evolution\nfrom linear growth of the tearing instability to a fully developed turbulent\nstate at late times. The final state develops from the highly ordered initial\nstate via both forward and inverse cascades. Component and spectral anisotropy\nin the magnetic fluctuations is present when a guide field is included. The\ninclusion of a population of new-born interstellar pickup protons does not\nstrongly affect these results. Finally, we conclude that reconnection between\nmultiple current sheets can act as an important source of turbulence in the\nouter heliosphere, with implications for energetic particle acceleration and\npropagation.\n", "  The detection and study of extrasolar planets is an exciting and thriving\nfield in modern astrophysics, and an increasingly popular topic in introductory\nastronomy courses. One detection method relies on searching for stars whose\nlight has been gravitationally microlensed by an extrasolar planet. In order to\nfacilitate instructors' abilities to bring this interesting mix of general\nrelativity and extrasolar planet detection into the introductory astronomy\nclassroom, we have developed a new Lecture-Tutorial, \"Detecting Exoplanets with\nGravitational Microlensing.\" In this paper, we describe how this new\nLecture-Tutorial's representations of astrophysical phenomena, which we\nselected and created based on theoretically motivated considerations of their\npedagogical affordances, are used to help introductory astronomy students\ndevelop more expert-like reasoning abilities.\n", "  We investigated the optical/ultraviolet (UV) color variations for a sample of\n2169 quasars based on multi-epoch spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) data release seven (DR7) and data release nine (DR9). To correct the\nsystematic difference between DR7 and DR9 due to the different instrumental\nsetup, we produced a correction spectrum by using a sample of F-stars observed\nboth in DR7 and DR9. The correction spectrum was then applied to quasars when\ncomparing the spectra of DR7 with DR9. In each object, the color variation was\nexplored by comparing the spectral index of the continuum power-law fit on the\nbrightest spectrum with the faintest one, and also by the shape of their\ndifference spectrum. In 1876 quasars with consistent color variations from two\nmethods, we found that most sources (1755, $\\sim 94\\%$) show\nbluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend, and the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend is\nonly detected in 121 objects ($\\sim 6\\%$). The common BWB trend is supported by\nthe bluer composite spectrum constructed from bright spectra than that from\nfaint spectra, and also by the blue composite difference spectrum. The\ncorrection spectrum is proved to be highly reliable by comparing the composite\nspectrum from corrected DR9 and original DR7 spectra. Assuming that the\noptical/UV variability is triggered by fluctuations, RWB trend can likely be\nexplained if the fluctuations occur firstly at outer disk region, and the inner\ndisk region has not fully responded yet when the fluctuation being propagated\ninward. In contrast, the common BWB trend implies that the fluctuations are\nlikely more often happening firstly in inner disk region.\n", "  A new formulation of the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity for average atom models\nis given. The new formulation improves upon previous by explicitly including\nthe ionic-structure factor. Calculations based on this new expression lead to\nmuch improved agreement with ab initio results for DC conductivity of warm\ndense hydrogen and beryllium, and for thermal conductivity of hydrogen. We also\ngive and test a slightly modified Ziman-Evans formula for the resistivity that\nincludes a non-free electron density of states, thus removing an ambiguity in\nthe original Ziman-Evans formula. Again results based on this expression are in\ngood agreement with ab initio simulations for warm dense beryllium and\nhydrogen. However, for both these expressions, calculations of the electrical\nconductivity of warm dense aluminum lead to poor agreement at low temperatures\ncompared to ab initio simulations.\n", "  We explore the possibility of planet formation in the carbon-rich\nprotoplanetary disks of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, possible\nrelics of the early Universe. The chemically anomalous abundance patterns\n([C/Fe] $\\geq$ 0.7) in this subset of low-mass stars suggest pollution by\nprimordial core-collapsing supernovae (SNe) ejecta that are particularly rich\nin carbon dust grains. By comparing the dust-settling timescale in the\nprotoplanetary disks of CEMP stars to the expected disk lifetime (assuming\ndissipation via photoevaporation), we determine the maximum distance $r_{max}$\nfrom the host CEMP star at which carbon-rich planetesimal formation is\npossible, as a function of the host star's [C/H] abundance. We then use our\nlinear relation between $r_{max}$ and [C/H], along with the theoretical\nmass-radius relation derived for a solid, pure carbon planet, to characterize\npotential planetary transits across host CEMP stars. Given that the related\ntransits are detectable with current and upcoming space-based transit surveys,\nwe suggest initiating an observational program to search for carbon planets\naround CEMP stars in hopes of shedding light on the question of how early\nplanetary systems may have formed after the Big Bang.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies produce gamma-rays primarily via pion production,\nresulting from inelastic collisions between cosmic ray protons and the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). The dense ISM and high star formation rates of\nluminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) imply that\nthey should be strong gamma-ray emitters, but so far only two LIRGs have been\ndetected. Theoretical models for their emission depend on the unknown fraction\nof cosmic ray protons that escape these galaxies before interacting. We analyze\nFermi-LAT data for 82 of the brightest IRAS LIRGs and ULIRGs. We examine each\nsystem individually and carry out a stacking analysis to constrain their\ngamma-ray fluxes. We report the detection of the nearest ULIRG Arp 220\n(~4.6sigma). We observe a gamma-ray flux (0.8--100 GeV) of 2.4e-10 phot cm^-2\ns^-1 with photon index of 2.23 (8.2e10^41 ergs s^-1 at 77 Mpc) We also derive\nupper limits for the stacked LIRGs and ULIRGs. The gamma-ray luminosity of\nArp~220 and the stacked upper limits agree with calorimetric predictions for\ndense star-forming galaxies. With the detection of Arp 220, we extend the\ngamma-ray--IR luminosity correlation to the high luminosity regime with\nlog(L_[0.1-100 GeV]) = 1.25log(L_[8-1000]) + 26.7 as well as the\ngamma-ray--radio continuum luminosity correlation with log(L_[0.1-100 GeV]) =\n1.22log(L_[1.4 GHz]) + 13.3. The current survey of Fermi-LAT is on the verge of\ndetecting more LIRGs/ULIRGs in the local universe, and we expect even more\ndetections with deeper Fermi-LAT observations or the next generation of\ngamma-ray detectors.\n", "  Blazars are prime candidate sources for the high energy neutrinos recently\ndetected by IceCube. Being one of the brightest sources in the extragalactic\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray sky as well as one of the nearest blazars to Earth, Mrk\n421 is an excellent source for testing the scenario of the blazar-neutrino\nconnection. Here, we model the spectral energy distribution of Mrk 421 during a\n13-day flare in 2010 with unprecedented multi-wavelength coverage, and\ncalculate the respective neutrino flux. We find a correlation between the $>1$\nPeV neutrino and photon fluxes, in all energy bands. Using typical IceCube\nthrough-going muon event samples with good angular resolution and high\nstatistics, we derive the mean event rate above 100 TeV ($\\sim0.57$ evt/yr) and\nshow that it is comparable to that expected from a four-month quiescent period\nin 2009. Due to the short duration of the flare, an accumulation of similar\nflares over several years would be necessary to produce a meaningful signal for\nIceCube. To better assess this, we apply the correlation between the neutrino\nand $\\gamma$-ray fluxes to the 6.9 yr Fermi-LAT light curve of Mrk 421. We find\nthat the mean event count above 1 PeV for the full IceCube detector livetime is\n$3.59\\pm0.60$ ($2.73\\pm0.38$) $\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ with (without) major\nflares included in our analysis. This estimate exceeds, within the\nuncertainties, the $95\\%$ ($90\\%$) threshold value for the detection of one or\nmore muon (anti-)neutrinos. Meanwhile, the most conservative scenario, where no\ncorrelation of $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos is assumed, predicts $1.60\\pm0.16$\n$\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ events. We conclude that a non-detection of high-energy\nneutrinos by IceCube would probe the neutrino/$\\gamma$-ray flux correlation\nduring major flares or/and the hadronic contribution to the blazar emission.\n", "  Rare-earth doped form, ceria (CeO2) is of interest as a potential candidate\nfor solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of its relatively high oxygen ion\nconductivity at temperatures below 600 {\\deg}C. At the present time,\ncomputational chemistry has reached a certain maturity which allows prediction\nof materials properties that are difficult to observe experimentally. However,\nunderstanding of the roles of dopants on the oxygen ion conduction in CeO2 is\nstill incomplete for quantitatively reliable analysis due to strong electron\ncorrelation of 4f electrons. In this study, density functional theory\ncalculations with Hubbard U corrections are conducted to discuss ionic/covalent\ninteractions in rare-earth-doped CeO2 and their consequences to oxygen ion\nconduction. The study suggests that the variable occupancy of empty 4f orbitals\nis important typically for early Ln elements to produce the covalent\ninteractions that essentially affect formation and migration of oxygen\nvacancies. This finding is important in understanding the factors responsible\nfor oxygen ion diffusion in doped CeO2.\n", "  The centroid energy Ecyc of the cyclotron line in the spectrum of the binary\nX-ray pulsar Her X-1 had been found to decrease with time on a time scale of a\nfew tens of years - surprisingly short astrophysically. This was found for the\npulse phase averaged line centroid energy using observational data from various\nX-ray satellites over the time frame 1996 to 2012, establishing a reduction of\nabout 4 keV. Here we report on the result of a new observation by NuSTAR\nperformed in August 2015. The earlier results are confirmed and strengthened,\nwith respect to both, the dependence of Ecyc on flux (it is still present after\n2006) and the dependence on time: the long-term decay continued with the same\nrate, corresponding to a reduction of about 5 keV in 20 years.\n", "  We present the simulation framework CRPropa version 3 designed for efficient\ndevelopment of astrophysical predictions for ultra-high energy particles. Users\ncan assemble modules of the most relevant propagation effects in galactic and\nextragalactic space, include their own physics modules with new features, and\nreceive on output primary and secondary cosmic messengers including nuclei,\nneutrinos and photons. In extension to the propagation physics contained in a\nprevious CRPropa version, the new version facilitates high-performance\ncomputing and comprises new physical features such as an interface for galactic\npropagation using lensing techniques, an improved photonuclear interaction\ncalculation, and propagation in time dependent environments to take into\naccount cosmic evolution effects in anisotropy studies and variable sources.\nFirst applications using highlighted features are presented as well.\n", "  We have obtained K-band spectra at R~5,000 and angular resolution 0.3\" of a\nsection of the Herbig-Haro 7 (HH7) bow shock, using the Near-Infrared Integral\nField Spectrograph at Gemini North. Present in the portion of the data cube\ncorresponding to the brightest part of the bow shock are emission lines of H2\nwith upper state energies ranging from ~6,000 K up to the dissociation energy\nof H2, ~50,000 K. Because of low signal-to-noise ratios, the highest excitation\nlines cannot be easily seen elsewhere in the observed region. However,\nexcitation temperatures, measured throughout much of the observed region using\nlines from levels as high as 25,000 K, are a strong function of upper level\nenergy, indicating that the very highest levels are populated throughout. The\nlevel populations in the brightest region are well fit by a two-temperature\nmodel, with 98.5% of the emitting gas at T=1800 K and 1.5% at T=5200 K. The\nbulk of the H2 line emission in HH7, from the 1,800 K gas, has previously been\nwell modeled by a continuous shock, but the 5,200 K component is inconsistent\nwith standalone standard continuous shock models. We discuss various possible\norigins for the hot component and suggest that this component is H2 newly\nreformed on dust grains and then ejected from them, presumably following\ndissociation of some of the H2 by the shock.\n", "  Recently, a number of peculiar flares have been reported, which demonstrate\nsignificant non-thermal particle signatures with a low, if any, thermal\nemission, that implies close association of the observed emission with the\nprimary energy release/electron acceleration region. This paper presents a\nflare that appears a \"cold\" one at the impulsive phase, while displaying a\ndelayed heating later on. Using HXR data from \\kw, microwave observations by\nSSRT, RSTN, NoRH and NoRP, context observations, and 3D modeling, we study the\nenergy release, particle acceleration and transport, and the relationships\nbetween the nonthermal and thermal signatures. The flaring process is found to\ninvolve interaction between a small and a big loop and the accelerated\nparticles divided in roughly equal numbers between them. Precipitation of the\nelectrons from the small loop produced only weak thermal response because the\nloop volume was small, while the electrons trapped in the big loop lost most of\ntheir energy in the coronal part of the loop, which resulted in the coronal\nplasma heating but no or only weak chromospheric evaporation, and thus\nunusually weak soft X-ray emission. Energy losses of fast electrons in the big\ntenuous loop were slow resulting in the observed delay of the plasma heating.\nWe determined that the impulsively accelerated electron population had a beamed\nangular distribution in the direction of electric force along the magnetic\nfield of the small loop. The accelerated particle transport in big loop was\nprimarily mediated by turbulent waves like in the other reported cold flares.\n", "  The Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method with the coherent potental approximation\n(KKR-CPA) is applied to study the first superconducting high entropy alloy\n(HEA) Ta34Nb33Hf8Zr14Ti11 (discovered in 2014 with Tc = 7.3 K), focusing on\nestimations of the electron-phonon coupling constant \\lambda. Electronic part\nof \\lambda has been calculated using the rigid muffin-tin approximation (RMTA),\nwhile the phonon part has been approximated using average atomic mass and\nexperimental Debye temperature. The estimated \\lambda = 1.16 is close to the\nvalue determined from specific heat measurements, \\lambda = 0.98, and suggests\nrather strong electron-phonon coupling in this material.\n", "  We present results from multiwavelength observations of the BL Lacertae\nobject 1ES 1741+196, including results in the very-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray\nregime using the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System\n(VERITAS). The VERITAS time-averaged spectrum, measured above 180 GeV, is\nwell-modelled by a power law with a spectral index of\n$2.7\\pm0.7_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm0.2_{\\mathrm{syst}}$. The integral flux above 180\nGeV is $(3.9\\pm0.8_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm1.0_{\\mathrm{syst}})\\times 10^{-8}$\nm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to 1.6% of the Crab Nebula flux on average.\nThe multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of the source suggests that\n1ES 1741+196 is an extreme-high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object. The\nobservations analysed in this paper extend over a period of six years, during\nwhich time no strong flares were observed in any band. This analysis is\ntherefore one of the few characterizations of a blazar in a non-flaring state.\n", "  We study the capillarity equation from the global point of view of behavior\nof its solutions without explicit regard to boundary conditions. We show its\nsolutions to be constrained in ways, that have till now not been characterized\nin literature known to us.\n", "  We present radiation hydrodynamic simulations of collapsing protostellar\ncores with initial masses of 30, 100, and 200 M$_{\\odot}$. We follow their\ngravitational collapse and the formation of a massive protostar and\nprotostellar accretion disk. We employ a new hybrid radiative feedback method\nblending raytracing techniques with flux-limited diffusion for a more accurate\ntreatment of the temperature and radiative force. In each case, the disk that\nforms becomes Toomre-unstable and develops spiral arms. This occurs between\n0.35 and 0.55 freefall times and is accompanied by an increase in the accretion\nrate by a factor of 2-10. Although the disk becomes unstable, no other stars\nare formed. In the case of our 100 and 200 M$_{\\odot}$ simulation, the star\nbecomes highly super-Eddington and begins to drive bipolar outflow cavities\nthat expand outwards. These radiatively-driven bubbles appear stable, and\nappear to be channeling gas back onto the protostellar accretion disk.\nAccretion proceeds strongly through the disk. After 81.4 kyr of evolution, our\n30 M$_{\\odot}$ simulation shows a star with a mass of 5.48 M$_{\\odot}$ and a\ndisk of mass 3.3 M$_{\\odot}$, while our 100 M$_{\\odot}$ simulation forms a 28.8\nM$_{\\odot}$ mass star with a 15.8 M$_{\\odot}$ disk over the course of 41.6 kyr,\nand our 200 M$_{\\odot}$ simulation forms a 43.7 M$_{\\odot}$ star with an 18\nM$_{\\odot}$ disk in 21.9 kyr. In the absence of magnetic fields or other forms\nof feedback, the masses of the stars in our simulation do not appear limited by\ntheir own luminosities.\n", "  In earlier work, we provided a general description of the forces of\nattraction and repulsion, encountered by two parallel vertical plates of\ninfinite extent and of possibly differing materials, when partially immersed in\nan infinite liquid bath and subject to surface tension forces. In the present\nstudy, we examine some unusual details of the exotic behavior that can occur at\nthe singular configuration separating infinite rise from infinite descent of\nthe fluid between the plates, as the plates approach each other. In connection\nwith this singular behavior, we present also some new estimates on meniscus\nheight details.\n", "  Configuration-constrained potential-energy-surface calculations have been\nperformed to investigate the $K$ isomerism in the proton-rich $A\\sim80$ mass\nregion. An abundance of high-$K$ states are predicted. These high-$K$ states\narise from two and four-quasi-particle excitations, with $K^{\\pi}=8^{+}$ and\n$K^{\\pi}=16^{+}$, respectively. Their excitation energies are comparatively\nlow, making them good candidates for long-lived isomers. Since most nuclei\nunder studies are prolate spheroids in their ground states, the oblate shapes\nof the predicted high-$K$ states may indicate a combination of $K$ isomerism\nand shape isomerism.\n", "  The UV-initiative Hubble Space Telescope Treasury survey of Galactic globular\nclusters provides a new window into the phenomena that shape the morphological\nfeatures of the horizontal branch (HB). Using this large and homogeneous\ncatalog of UV and blue photometry, we demonstrate that the HB exhibits\ndiscontinuities that are remarkably consistent in color (effective\ntemperature). This consistency is apparent even among some of the most massive\nclusters hosting multiple distinct sub-populations (such as NGC 2808, omega\nCen, and NGC 6715), demonstrating that these phenomena are primarily driven by\natmospheric physics that is independent of the underlying population\nproperties. However, inconsistencies arise in the metal-rich clusters NGC 6388\nand NGC 6441, where the discontinuity within the blue HB (BHB) distribution\nshifts ~1,000 K to 2,000 K hotter. We demonstrate that this shift is likely due\nto a large helium enhancement in the BHB stars of these clusters, which in turn\naffects the surface convection and evolution of such stars. Our survey also\nincreases the number of Galactic globular clusters known to host blue-hook\nstars (also known as late hot flashers) from 6 to 23 clusters. These clusters\nare biased toward the bright end of the globular cluster luminosity function,\nconfirming that blue-hook stars tend to form in the most massive clusters with\nsignificant self-enrichment.\n", "  Novel uses for 2-dimensional materials like graphene and hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) are being frequently discovered especially for membrane and\ncatalysis applications. Still however, a great deal remains to be understood\nabout the interaction of environmentally and industrially elevant molecules\nsuch as water with these materials. Taking inspiration from advances in\nhybridising graphene and h-BN, we explore using density functional theory, the\ndissociation of water, hydrogen, methane, and methanol on graphene, h-BN, and\ntheir isoelectronic doped counterparts: BN doped graphene and C doped h-BN. We\nfind that doped surfaces are considerably more reactive than their pristine\ncounterparts and by comparing the reactivity of several small molecules we\ndevelop a general framework for dissociative adsorption. From this a\nparticularly attractive consequence of isoelectronic doping emerges: substrates\ncan be doped to enhance their reactivity specifically towards either polar or\nnon-polar adsorbates. As such, these substrates are potentially viable\ncandidates for selective catalysts and membranes, with the implication that a\nrange of tuneable materials can be designed.\n", "  We revisit the relationship of inequality between the gravitational field\nenergy and the Komar charge, both quantities evaluated at the event horizon,\nfor static and spherically symmetric regular black hole solutions obtained with\nnonlinear electrodynamics. We found a way to characterize these regular black\nhole solutions by the energy conditions that they satisfy. In particular, we\nshow the relation between the direction of the inequality and the energy\ncondition that satisfy the regular black hole solutions.\n", "  Fast time variability is the most prominent characteristic of accreting\nsystems and the presence of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) is a constant in\nall accreting systems, from cataclysmic variables to AGNs, passing through\nblack hole and neutron star X-ray binaries and through the enigmatic\nultra-luminous X-ray sources. In this paper I will briefly review the current\nknowledge of QPOs in black hole X-ray binaries, mainly focussing on their\nobserved properties, but also mentioning the most important models that have\nbeen proposed to explain the origin of QPOs over the last decades.\n", "  We report the first demonstration of thermally controlled soliton modelocked\nfrequency comb generation in microresonators. By controlling the electric\ncurrent through heaters integrated with silicon nitride microresonators, we\ndemonstrate a systematic and repeatable pathway to single- and multi-soliton\nmodelocked states without adjusting the pump laser wavelength. Such an approach\ncould greatly simplify the generation of modelocked frequency combs and\nfacilitate applications such as chip-based dual-comb spectroscopy.\n", "  We introduce a new procedure for iterative selection of determinant spaces\ncapable of describing highly correlated systems. This adaptive configuration\ninteraction (ACI) determines an optimal basis by an iterative procedure in\nwhich the determinant space is expanded and coarse grained until self\nconsistency. Two importance criteria control the selection process and tune the\nACI to a user-defined level of accuracy. The ACI is shown to yield potential\nenergy curves of N$_2$ with nearly constant errors, and it predicts\nsinglet-triplet splittings of acenes up to decacene that are in good agreement\nwith the density matrix renormalization group.\n", "  We first consider how the level of turbulence in a protoplanetary disk\naffects the formation locations for the observed close-in super-Earths in\nexosolar systems. We find that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone\n(a region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in the inner parts\nof the disk, possibly allowing for in situ formation. For the dead zone to last\nthe entire lifetime of the disk requires the active layer surface density to be\nsufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead zone may be very slow\nand thus super-Earth formation followed by migration towards the star through\nthe dead zone is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not enough\nmaterial for in situ formation. However, in this case, super-Earths can form\nfarther out in the disk and migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We\nsuggest that both of these formation mechanisms operate in different planetary\nsystems. This can help to explain the observed large range in densities of\nsuper-Earths because the formation location determines the composition.\nFurthermore, we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the inner\nparts of our solar system and cleared the material in the region inside of\nMercury's orbit. The super-Earths could migrate through the gas disk and fall\ninto the Sun if the disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk\naccretion process. While it is definitely possible to meet all of these\nrequirements, we don't expect them to occur in all systems, which may explain\nwhy the solar system is somewhat special in its lack of super-Earths.\n", "  We discuss about how the relative flux densities among the images of\ngravitationally-lensed active galactic nuclei, AGN, can be used to study the\nintrinsic AGN variability with high accuracy. Multi-frequency monitoring\nobservations of resolved gravitational lenses can allow us to detect signals of\nvery weak variability and also provide information about the jet opacity and\nstructure. As an example, we investigate the variability of the flux-density\nratio between the two lensed images of the blazar B0218+357, using\ndual-frequency cm-wave observations. Similar to our previously reported\nsubmm-wave observations of the lensed blazar PKS1830-211, we observe a clear\nchromatic variability, starting short before an increase in the flux-density of\nthe blazar. The evolution of the flux-density ratios between the blazar images\nshows a more clear and rich structure than that of the mere lightcurves of each\nindividual image. The accuracy in the ratio measurements is allowing us to see\nvariability episodes in the blazar that are weaker than the natural scatter in\nthe absolute flux-density measurements. A simple opacity model in the jet is\nused to consistently explain the difference between the flux-density-ratio\nevolution at the two frequencies.\n", "  I revisit the problem of the interaction between two dissimilar atoms with\none atom in an excited state, recently addressed by the authors of Refs.[1-3],\nand for which precedent approaches have given conflicting results. In the first\nplace, I discuss to what extent Refs.[1], [2] and [3] provide equivalent\nresults. I show that the phase-shift rate of the two-atom wave function\ncomputed in Ref.[1], the van der Waals potential of the excited atom in Ref.[2]\nand the level shift of the excited atom in Ref.[3] possess equivalent\nexpressions in the quasistationary approximation. In addition, I show that the\nlevel shift of the ground state atom computed in Ref.[3] is equivalent to its\nvan der Waals potential. A diagrammatic representation of all those quantities\nis provided. The equivalences among them are however not generic. In\nparticular, it is found that for the case of the interaction between two\nidentical atoms excited, the phase-shift rate and the van der Waals potentials\ndiffer. Concerning the conflicting results of previous approaches in regards to\nthe spatial oscillation of the interactions, I conclude in agreement with\nRefs.[1,3] that they refer to different physical quantities. The impacts of\nfree-space dissipation and finite excitation rates on the dynamics of the\npotentials are analyzed. In contrast to Ref.[3], the oscillatory versus\nmonotonic spatial forms of the potentials of each atom are found not to be\nrelated to the reversible versus irreversible nature of the excitation transfer\ninvolved.\n", "  There is growing evidence that a stable magnetar could be formed from the\ncoalescence of double neutron stars. In previous papers, we investigated the\nsignature of formation of stable millisecond magnetars in radio and\noptical/ultraviolet bands by assuming that the central rapidly rotating\nmagnetar deposits its rotational energy in the form of a relativistic\nleptonized wind. We found that the optical transient PTF11agg could be the\nfirst evidence for the formation of post-merger millisecond magnetars. To\nenhance the probability of finding more evidence for the post-merger magnetar\nformation, it is better to extend the observational channel to other photon\nenergy bands. In this paper we propose to search the signature of post-merger\nmagnetar formation in X-ray and especially gamma-ray bands. We calculate the\nSSC emission of the reverse shock powered by post-merger millisecond magnetars.\nWe find that the SSC component peaks at $1\\,{\\rm GeV}$ in the spectral energy\ndistribution and extends to $\\gtrsim 10\\,{\\rm TeV}$ for typical parameters.\nThese energy bands are quite suitable for Fermi/LAT and CTA, which, with their\ncurrent observational sensitivities, can detect the SSC emission powered by\npost-merger magnetars up to $1\\,{\\rm Gpc}$. NuSTAR, sensible in X-ray bands,\ncan detect the formation of post-merger millisecond magnetars at redshift\n$z\\sim 1$. Future improvement in sensitivity of CTA can also probe the birth of\npost-merger millisecond magnetars at redshift $z\\sim 1$. However, because of\nthe $\\gamma$-$\\gamma$ collisions, strong high-energy emission is clearly\npredicted only for ejecta masses lower than $10^{-3}M_\\odot$.\n", "  Protostars are mostly found in star-forming regions, where the natal\nmolecular gas still remains. In about 5' west of the molecular bubble N4, N4W\nis identified as a star-forming clump hosting three Class II (IRS\\,1\\,--\\,3),\nand one Class I (IRS\\,4) young stellar objects (YSOs), as well as a\nsubmillimeter source SMM1. The near-IR polarization imaging data of N4W reveal\ntwo infrared reflection nebulae close to each other, which are in favor of the\noutflows of IRS\\,1 and IRS\\,2. The bipolar mid-IR emission centered on IRS\\,4\nand the arc-like molecular gas shell are lying on the same axis, indicating a\nbipolar molecular outflow from IRS\\,4. There are two dust temperature\ndistributions in N4W. The warmer one is widely distributed and has a\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{d}\\gtrsim28\\,\\mathrm{K}$, with the colder one from the\nembedded compact submillimeter source SMM1. N4W's mass is estimated to be\n$\\sim2.5\\times10^3\\,M_\\odot$, and the mass of SMM1 is\n$\\sim5.5\\times10^2\\,M_\\odot$ at $T_\\mathrm{d}=15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, calculated from\nthe CO\\,$1-0$ emission and $870\\,\\mu$m dust continuum emission, respectively.\nBased on the estimates of bolometric luminosity of IRS\\,1\\,--\\,4, these four\nsources are intermediate-mass YSOs at least. SMM1 is gravitationally bound, and\nis capable of forming intermediate-mass stars or even possibly massive stars.\nThe co-existence of the IR bright YSOs and the submillimeter source represents\npotential sequential star formation processes separated by $\\sim0.5$\\,Myr in\nN4W. This small age spread implies that the intermediate-mass star formation\nprocesses happening in N4W are almost coeval.\n", "  Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the modifications of the power\nspectrum of primordial fluctuations caused by quantum cosmology effects. The\norigin of these modifications are corrections to the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations\nthat govern the propagation of the primeval cosmological perturbations. The\nspecific form of these corrections depends on a series of details of the\nquantization approach and of the prescription followed to implement it.\nGenerally, nonetheless, the complexity of the theoretical quantum formulation\nis simplified in practice appealing to a semiclassical or effective\napproximation, in order to perform concrete numerical computations. In this\nwork, we introduce technical tools and design a procedure to deal with these\nquantum corrections beyond the most direct approximations employed so far in\nthe literature. In particular, by introducing an interaction picture, we\nextract the quantum dynamics of the homogeneous geometry in absence of scalar\nfield potential and inhomogeneities, dynamics that has been intensively studied\nand that can be integrated. The rest of our analysis focuses on the interaction\nevolution, putting forward methods to cope with it. The ultimate aim is to\ndevelop treatments that increase our ability to discriminate between the\npredictions of different quantization proposals for cosmological perturbations.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the scaling corrections in ballistic deposition\nmodels in high dimensions using the method proposed by Alves \\textit{et al}.\n[Phys Rev. E \\textbf{90}, 052405 (20014)] in $d=2+1$ dimensions, where the\nintrinsic width associated with the fluctuations of the height increments\nduring the deposition processes is explicitly taken into account. In the\npresent work, we show that this concept holds for $d=3+1$ and 4+1 dimensions.\nWe have found that growth and roughness exponents and dimensionless cumulant\nratios are in agreement with other models, presenting small finite-time\ncorrections to the scaling, that in principle belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\n(KPZ) universality class in both $d=3+1$ and 4+1. Our results constitute a new\nevidence that the upper critical dimension of the KPZ class, if it exists, is\nlarger than 4.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer the potential to examine quantum\nbehavior at large length and time scales, as well as forming promising\ncandidates for quantum technology applications. Thus, the manipulation of BECs\nusing control fields is a topic of prime interest. We consider BECs in the mean\nfield model of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which contains linear and\nnonlinear features, both of which are subject to control. In this work we\nreport successful optimal control simulations of a one dimensional GPE by\nmodulating the linear and nonlinear terms to stimulate transitions into excited\ncoherent modes. The linear and nonlinear controls are allowed to freely vary\nover space and time to seek their optimal forms. The determination of the\nexcited coherent modes targeted for optimization is numerically performed\nthrough an adaptive imaginary time propagation method. Numerical simulations\nare performed for optimal control of mode-to-mode transitions between the\nground coherent mode and excited modes of a BEC trapped in a harmonic well. The\nresults show greater than 99% success for nearly all trials utilizing\nreasonable initial guesses for the controls, and analysis of the optimal\ncontrols reveals primarily direct transitions between initial and target modes.\nThe success of using solely the nonlinearity term as a control opens up further\nresearch toward exploring novel control mechanisms inaccessible to linear\nSchr\\\"odinger-type systems.\n", "  We present metallicities for red giant stars in the globular cluster NGC 6273\nbased on intermediate resolution GMOS-S spectra of the calcium triplet region.\nFor the 42 radial velocity members with reliable calcium triplet line strength\nmeasurements, we obtain metallicities, [Fe/H], using calibrations established\nfrom standard globular clusters. We confirm the presence of an intrinsic\nabundance dispersion identified by Johnson et al. (2015). The total range in\n[Fe/H] is ~1.0 dex and after taking into account the measurement errors, the\nintrinsic abundance dispersion is \\sigma[Fe/H] = 0.17 dex. Among the Galactic\nglobular clusters, the abundance dispersion in NGC 6273 is only exceeded by\nomega Cen, which is regarded as the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and M\n54, which is the nuclear star cluster of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. If these\nthree globular clusters share the same formation mechanism, then NGC 6273 may\nalso be the remnant nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.\n", "  We classify models of the Dirac neutrino mass by concentrating on flavor\nstructures of the mass matrix. The advantage of our classification is that we\ndo not need to specify detail of models except for Yukawa interactions because\nflavor structures can be given only by products of Yukawa matrices. All\npossible Yukawa interactions between leptons (including the right-handed\nneutrino) are taken into account by introducing appropriate scalar fields. We\nalso take into account the case with Yukawa interactions of leptons with the\ndark matter candidate. Then, we see that flavor structures can be classified\ninto seven groups. The result is useful for the efficient test of models of the\nneutrino mass. One of seven groups can be tested by measuring the absolute\nneutrino mass. Other two can be tested by probing the violation of the lepton\nuniversality in $\\ell \\to \\ell^\\prime \\nu \\overline{\\nu}$. In order to test the\nother four groups, we can rely on searches for new scalar particles at collider\nexperiments.\n", "  Electric field effect on magnetism is an appealing technique for manipulating\nthe magnetization at a low cost of energy. Here, we show that the local\nmagnetization of the ultra-thin Co film can be switched by just applying a gate\nelectric field without an assist of any external magnetic field or current\nflow. The local magnetization switching is explained by the nucleation and\nannihilation of the magnetic domain through the domain wall motion induced by\nthe electric field. Our results lead to external field free and ultra-low\nenergy spintronic applications.\n", "  Hydrides are simple compounds containing one or a few hydrogen atoms bonded\nto a heavier atom. They are fundamental precursor molecules in cosmic chemistry\nand many hydride ions have become observable in high quality for the first time\nthanks to the Herschel Space Observatory. Ionized hydrides, such as CH+ and\nOH+, and also HCO+ that affect the chemistry of molecules such as water,\nprovide complementary information on irradiation by far UV (FUV) or X-rays and\ngas temperature. The targeted lines of CH+, OH+, H2O+, C+ and CH are detected\nmostly in blue-shifted absorption. H3O+ and SH+ are detected in emission and\nonly toward some high-mass objects. The observed line parameters and\ncorrelations suggest two different origins, related to gas entrained by the\noutflows and to the circumstellar envelope. The column density ratios of\nCH+/OH+ are estimated from chemical slab models, assuming that the H2 density\nis given by the specific density model of each object at the beam radius. For\nthe low-mass YSOs the observed ratio can be reproduced for an FUV flux of 2-400\ntimes the ISRF at the location of the molecules. In two high-mass objects, the\nUV flux is 20-200 times the ISRF derived from absorption lines, and 300-600\nISRF using emission lines. If the FUV flux required for low-mass objects\noriginates at the central protostar, a substantial FUV luminosity, up to 1.5\nL_sun, is required. There is no molecular evidence for X-ray induced chemistry\nin the low-mass objects on the observed scales of a few 1000 AU. For high-mass\nregions, the FUV flux required to produce the observed molecular ratios is\nsmaller than the unattenuated flux expected from the central object(s) at the\nHerschel beam radius. This is consistent with an FUV flux reduced by\ncircumstellar extinction or by bloating of the protostar.\n", "  We report on the structural and electronic properties of a single bismuth\nlayer intercalated underneath a graphene layer grown on an Ir(111) single\ncrystal. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals a hexagonal surface\nstructure and a dislocation network upon Bi intercalation, which we attribute\nto a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}R30{\\deg}$ Bi structure on the underlying Ir(111)\nsurface. Ab-initio calculations show that this Bi structure is the most\nenergetically favorable, and also illustrate that STM measurements are most\nsensitive to C atoms in close proximity to intercalated Bi atoms. Additionally,\nBi intercalation induces a band gap ($E_g=0.42\\,$eV) at the Dirac point of\ngraphene and an overall n-doping ($\\sim 0.39\\,$eV), as seen in angular-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. We attribute the emergence of the band gap to the\ndislocation network which forms favorably along certain parts of the moir\\'e\nstructure induced by the graphene/Ir(111) interface.\n", "  The formation and evolution of galactic spiral arms is not yet clearly\nunderstood despite many analytic and numerical work. Recently, a new idea has\nbeen proposed that local density enhancements (waklets) arising in the galactic\ndisk connect with each other and make global spiral arms. However, the\nunderstanding of this mechanism is not yet sufficient. We analyze the\ninteraction of wakelets by using N-body simulations including perturbing point\nmasses, which are heavier than individual N-body particles and act as the seeds\nfor wakelets. Our simulation facilitates more straightforward interpretation of\nnumerical results than previous work by putting a certain number of perturbers\nin a well-motivated configuration. We detected a clear sign of non-linear\ninteraction between wakelets, which make global spiral arms by connecting two\nadjacent wakelets. We found that the wave number of the strongest non-linear\ninteraction depends on galactic disk mass and shear rate. This dependence is\nconsistent with the prediction of swing amplification mechanism and other\nprevious results. Our results provide unification of previous results which\nseemed not consistent with each other.\n", "  We show that the position of the de Gennes minimum in scattering spectra,\nwhere the dynamics of liquids shows down, is given by a hard-sphere expression\nfor a range of mono-atomic liquids that crystallize in a close packed\nstructure. This expression relates the position of the minimum to the number\ndensity of the liquid, without any adjustable or unknown parameters. We argue\nthat this implies that a liquid can be viewed as a close packed structure of\nthe cages that represent the confinement of atoms by their neighbors. We\nfurther show that some metals deviate from this expression, namely those metals\nthat crystallize in a structure that is not close packed. Our expression should\nprove very useful in identifying what liquids to study in inelastic scattering\nexperiments given that deviations from normal fluid behavior can already be\npredicted based on the peak position of the static structure factor.\n", "  A linear response function (LRF) relates the mean-response of a nonlinear\nsystem to weak external forcings and vice versa. Even for simple models of the\ngeneral circulation, such as the dry dynamical core, the LRF cannot be\ncalculated from first principles due to the lack of a complete theory for\neddy-mean flow feedbacks. According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem\n(FDT), the LRF can be calculated using only the covariance and lag-covariance\nmatrices of the unforced system. However, efforts in calculating the LRFs for\nGCMs using FDT have produced mixed results, and the reason(s) behind the poor\nperformance of the FDT remains unclear. In Part 1 of this study, the LRF of an\nidealized GCM, the dry dynamical core with Held-Suarez physics, is accurately\ncalculated using Green's functions. In this paper (Part 2), the LRF of the same\nmodel is computed using FDT, which is found to perform poorly for some of the\ntest cases. The accurate LRF of Part 1 is used with a linear stochastic\nequation to show that dimension-reduction by projecting the data onto leading\nEOFs, which is commonly used for FDT, can alone be a significant source of\nerror. Simplified equations and examples of 2 x 2 matrices are then used to\ndemonstrate that this error arises because of the non-normality of the\noperator. These results suggest that errors caused by dimension-reduction are a\nmajor, if not the main, contributor to the poor performance of the LRF\ncalculated using FDT, and that further investigations of dimension-reduction\nstrategies with a focus on non-normality are needed.\n", "  Lithium abundances in open clusters provide an effective way of probing\nmixing processes in the interior of solar-type stars and convection is not the\nonly mixing mechanism at work. To understand which mixing mechanisms are\noccurring in low-mass stars, we test non-standard models, which were calibrated\nusing the Sun, with observations of three open clusters of different ages, the\nHyades, NGC 752, and M67. We collected all available data, and for the open\ncluster NGC 752, we redetermine the equivalent widths and the lithium\nabundances. Two sets of evolutionary models were computed, one grid of only\nstandard models with microscopic diffusion and one grid with rotation-induced\nmixing, at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.13, 0.0, and 0.01 dex, respectively, using\nthe Toulouse-Geneva evolution code. We compare observations with models in a\ncolor-magnitude diagram for each cluster to infer a cluster age and a stellar\nmass for each cluster member. Then, for each cluster we analyze the lithium\nabundance of each star as a function of mass. The data for the open clusters\nHyades, NGC 752, and M67, are compatible with lithium abundance being a\nfunction of both age and mass for stars in these clusters. Our models with\nmeridional circulation qualitatively reproduce the general trend of lithium\nabundance evolution as a function of stellar mass in all three clusters. This\nstudy points out the importance of mass dependence in the evolution of lithium\nabundance as a function of age. Comparison between models with and without\nrotation-induced mixing shows that the inclusion of meridional circulation is\nessential to account for lithium depletion in low-mass stars. However, our\nresults suggest that other mechanisms should be included to explain the Li-dip\nand the lithium dispersion in low-mass stars.\n", "  Accurate knowledge of fission fragment yields is an essential ingredient of\nnumerous applications ranging from the formation of elements in the r-process\nto fuel cycle optimization for nuclear energy. The need for a predictive theory\napplicable where no data is available is an incentive to develop a fully\nmicroscopic approach to fission dynamics. In this work, we calculate the\npre-neutron emission charge and mass distributions of the fission fragments\nformed in the neutron-induced fission of 239Pu using a microscopic method based\non nuclear energy density functional (EDF) method, where large amplitude\ncollective motion is treated adiabatically using the time dependent generator\ncoordinate method (TDGCM) under the Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA).\nFission fragment distributions are extracted from the flux of the collective\nwave packet through the scission line. We find that the main characteristics of\nthe fission charge and mass distributions can be well reproduced by existing\nenergy functionals even in two-dimensional collective spaces. Theory and\nexperiment agree typically within 2 mass units for the position of the\nasymmetric peak. As expected, calculations are sensitive to the structure of\nthe initial state and the prescription for the collective inertia. We emphasize\nthat results are also sensitive to the continuity of the collective landscape\nnear scission. Our analysis confirms that the adiabatic approximation provides\nan effective scheme to compute fission fragment yields. It also suggests that,\nat least in the framework of nuclear DFT, three-dimensional collective spaces\nmay be a prerequisite to reach 10% accuracy in predicting pre-neutron emission\nfission fragment yields.\n", "  We find that the mass ratio q in quiescent black hole (BH) X-ray transients\nis tightly correlated with the ratio of the double peak separation (DP) to the\nfull-width-half maximum (FWHM) of the Halpha emission line, log q = -6.88 -23.2\nlog (DP/FWHM). The correlation is explained through the efficient truncation of\nthe outer disc radius by the 3:1 resonance with the companion star. This is the\ndominant tidal interaction for extreme mass ratios q=M2/M1<~0.25, the realm of\nBH (and some neutron star) X-ray transients. Mass ratios can thus be estimated\nwith a typical uncertainty of ~32%, provided that the Halpha profile used to\nmeasure DP/FWHM is an orbital phase average. We apply the DP/FWHM-q relation to\nthe three faint BH transients XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933\nand predict q=0.026 (+0.038-0.007), 0.049 (+0.023-0.012) and 0.040\n(+0.003-0.005), respectively. This new relation, together with the FWHM-K2\ncorrelation presented in Paper I (casares 2015) allows the extraction of\nfundamental parameters from very faint targets and, therefore, the extension of\ndynamical BH studies to much deeper limits than was previously possible. As an\nexample, we combine our mass ratio determination for Swift J1357-0933 with\nprevious results to yield a BH mass of 12.4+-3.6 Msun. This confirms Swift\nJ1357-0933 as one of the most massive BH low-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy.\n", "  The gas near the midplanes of planet-forming protostellar disks remains\nlargely unprobed by observations due to the high optical depth of commonly\nobserved molecules such as CO and H$_2$O. However, rotational emission lines\nfrom rare molecules may have optical depths near unity in the vertical\ndirection, so that the lines are strong enough to be detected, yet remain\ntransparent enough to trace the disk midplane. Here we present a chemical model\nof an evolving T-Tauri disk and predict the optical depths of rotational\ntransitions of $^{12}$C$^{16}$O, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O and\n$^{12}$C$^{18}$O. The MRI-active disk is primarily heated by the central star\ndue to the formation of the dead zone. CO does not freeze out in our modeled\nregion within $70$AU around a sunlike star. However, the abundance of CO\ndecreases because of the formation of complex organic molecules (COM),\nproducing an effect that can be misinterpreted as the \"snow line\". These\nresults are robust to variations in our assumptions about the evolution of the\ngas to dust ratio. The optical depths of low-order rotational lines of\nC$^{17}$O are around unity, making it possible to see into the disk midplane\nusing C$^{17}$O. Combining observations with modeled C$^{17}$O$/$H$_2$ ratios,\nlike those we provide, can yield estimates of protoplanetary disks' gas masses.\n", "  The envelopes of stars near the Eddington limit are prone to various\ninstabilities. A high Eddington factor in connection with the Fe opacity peak\nleads to convective instability, and a corresponding envelope inflation may\ninduce pulsational instability. Here, we investigate the occurrence and\nconsequences of both instabilities in models of Wolf-Rayet stars. We determine\nthe convective velocities in the sub-surface convective zones to estimate the\namplitude of the turbulent velocity at the base of the wind that potentially\nleads to the formation of small-scale wind structures, as observed in several\nWR stars. We also investigate the effect of mass loss on the pulsations of our\nmodels. We approximated solar metallicity WR stars by models of mass-losing\nhelium stars, and we characterized the properties of convection in the envelope\nadopting the standard MLT. Our results show the occurrence of sub-surface\nconvective regions in all studied models. Small surface velocity amplitudes are\npredicted for models with masses below 10Msun. For models with M>10Msun, the\nsurface velocity amplitudes are of the order of 10km/s. Moreover we find the\noccurrence of pulsations for stars in the mass range 9-14Msun, while mass loss\nappears to stabilize the more massive WR stars. We confront our results with\nobservationally derived line variabilities of 17 WN stars. The data suggest\nvariability to occur for stars above 10Msun, which is increasing linearly with\nmass above this value, in agreement with our results. We further find some of\nour models to be unstable to radial pulsations, and predict local magnetic\nfields of the order of hundreds of Gauss in WR stars more massive than 10Msun.\nOur study relates the surface velocity fluctuations induced by sub-surface\nconvection to the formation of clumping in the inner part of the wind. From\nthis mechanism, we expect a stronger variability in more massive WR stars.\n", "  Spectroscopic observations of a transit event of an extrasolar planet offer\nthe opportunity to study the composition of the planetary atmosphere. We\nobserved a transit of the inflated Hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b with MODS at the LBT\nto characterize its atmosphere from 3300 to 10000 AA. A time series of target\nand reference star spectra was binned in two broad-band wavelength channels,\nfrom which differential transit light curves were constructed. These broad-band\nlight curves were used to confirm previous transit parameter determinations. To\nderive the planetary transmission spectrum with a resolution of R ~ 60, we\ncreated a chromatic set of 62 narrow-band light curves with an average\nwavelength width of about 100 AA. The spectrum was corrected for the\nthird-light of a near-by M star, whose spectrum was resolved in the individual\nexposures. Additionally, we undertook a photometric monitoring campaign of the\nhost star to correct for the influence of starspots. The transmission spectrum\nof HAT-P-32b shows no pressure-broadened absorption features from Na and K,\nwhich is interpreted by the presence of clouds or hazes in the planetary\natmosphere. This result is in agreement to previous studies on the same planet.\nThe presence of TiO in gas phase could be ruled out. We find a 2.8 sigma\nindication of increased absorption in the line core of potassium (KI~7699 AA).\nNo narrow absorption features of Na and Halpha were detected. Furthermore,\ntentative indications were found for a slope of increasing opacity toward blue\nwavelengths from the near-IR to the near-UV with an amplitude of two scale\nheights. If confirmed by follow-up observations, it can be explained by\naerosols either causing Mie scattering or causing Rayleigh scattering with an\naerosol - gas scale height ratio below unity.\n", "  We report rotation periods for 20 cool (FGK) main sequence member stars of\nthe 4 Gyr-old open cluster M 67 (= NGC 2682), obtained by analysing data from\nCampaign 5 of the K2 mission with the Kepler Space Telescope. The rotation\nperiods delineate a sequence in the color-period diagram (CPD) of increasing\nperiod with redder color. This sequence represents a cross-section at the\ncluster age of the surface P = P (t, M), suggested in prior work to extend to\nat least solar age. The current Sun is located marginally (approx. one sigma)\nabove M 67 in the CPD, as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the\nP = P (t, M) surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude\nthat the solar rotation rate is normal, as compared with cluster stars, a fact\nwhich strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement between the M\\,67\nrotation period measurements and prior predictions further implies that\nrotation periods, especially when coupled with appropriate supporting work such\nas spectroscopy, can provide reliable ages via gyrochronology for other similar\nFGK dwarfs from the early main sequence to solar age and likely till the main\nsequence turnoff. The M 67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr, with a\nstandard deviation of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be\nage-dated to precisions of ~17%. The rotational age of the M 67 cluster as a\nwhole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of 0.2 Gyr.\n", "  Motional ground state cooling and internal state preparation are important\nelements for quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS), a class of quantum information\nprocessing. Since QLS does not require the high gate fidelities usually\nassociated with quantum computation and quantum simulation, it is possible to\nmake simplifying choices in ion species and quantum protocols at the expense of\nsome fidelity. Here, we report sideband cooling and motional state detection\nprotocols for $^{138}$Ba$^+$ of sufficient fidelity for QLS without an\nextremely narrowband laser or the use of a species with hyperfine structure. We\nuse the two S$_{1/2}$ Zeeman sublevels of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ to Raman sideband cool\na single ion to the motional ground state. Because of the small Zeeman\nsplitting, near-resonant Raman sideband cooling of $^{138}$Ba$^+$ requires only\nthe Doppler cooling lasers and two additional AOMs. Observing the near-resonant\nRaman optical pumping fluorescence, we estimate a final average motional\nquantum number $\\bar{n}\\approx0.17$. We additionally employ a second,\nfar-off-resonant laser driving Raman $\\pi$-pulses between the two Zeeman\nsublevels to provide motional state detection for QLS and to confirm the\nsideband cooling efficiency, measuring a final $\\bar{n} = 0.15(6)$.\n", "  We fit an Extended Distribution Function (EDF) to K giants in the Sloan\nExtension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey. These\nstars are detected to radii ~80 kpc and span a wide range in [Fe/H]. Our EDF,\nwhich depends on [Fe/H] in addition to actions, encodes the entanglement of\nmetallicity with dynamics within the Galaxy's stellar halo. Our\nmaximum-likelihood fit of the EDF to the data allows us to model the survey's\nselection function. The density profile of the K giants steepens with radius\nfrom a slope ~-2 to ~-4 at large radii. The halo's axis ratio increases with\nradius from 0.7 to almost unity. The metal-rich stars are more tightly confined\nin action space than the metal-poor stars and form a more flattened structure.\nA weak metallicity gradient ~-0.001 dex/kpc, a small gradient in the dispersion\nin [Fe/H] of ~0.001 dex/kpc, and a higher degree of radial anistropy in\nmetal-richer stars result. Lognormal components with peaks at ~-1.5 and ~-2.3\nare required to capture the overall metallicity distribution, suggestive of the\nexistence of two populations of K giants. The spherical anisotropy parameter\nvaries between 0.3 in the inner halo to isotropic in the outer halo. If the\nSagittarius stream is included, a very similar model is found but with a\nstronger degree of radial anisotropy throughout.\n", "  Anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions between ultracold dipolar fermions\nbreak the symmetry of the Fermi surface and thereby deform it. Here we\ndemonstrate that such a Fermi surface deformation induces a topological phase\ntransition -- so-called Lifshitz transition -- in the regime accessible to\npresent-day experiments. We describe the impact of the Lifshitz transition on\nobservable quantities such as the Fermi surface topology, the density-density\ncorrelation function, and the excitation spectrum of the system. The Lifshitz\ntransition in ultracold atoms can be controlled by tuning the dipole\norientation and -- in contrast to the transition studied in crystalline solids\n-- is completely interaction-driven.\n", "  Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, the H2-16O 10_2,9-9_3,6\ntransition (E_up=1863K) at 321.2 GHz has been detected toward the embedded\nlow-mass protostar HL Tau. The line centroid is blue-shifted by 15 km/s with\nrespect to the source velocity, and it has a FWHM of 20 km/s. The emission is\ntentatively resolved and extends ~3-4\" over the sky (~2 beams), or ~500 AU at\nthe distance of Taurus. The velocity offset, and to a lesser degree the spatial\nextent of the emission, shows that the line originates in the protostellar jet\nor wind. This result suggests that at least some water emission observed toward\nembedded sources, and perhaps also disk sources, with Herschel and Spitzer\ncontains a wind or jet component, which is crucial for interpreting these data.\nThese pathfinder observations done with the SMA opens a new window to studying\nthe origin of water emission with e.g. ALMA, thus providing new insights into\nwhere water is in protostellar systems.\n", "  We study the effects of initial conditions of star clusters and their massive\nstar population on dynamical ejections of massive stars from star clusters up\nto an age of 3 Myr. We use a large set of direct N-body calculations for\nmoderately massive star clusters (Mecl=$10^{3.5}$ Msun). We vary the initial\nconditions of the calculations such as the initial half-mass radius of the\nclusters, initial binary populations for massive stars and initial mass\nsegregation. We find that the initial density is the most influential parameter\nfor the ejection fraction of the massive systems. The clusters with an initial\nhalf-mass radius of 0.1 (0.3) pc can eject up to 50% (30%) of their O-star\nsystems on average. Most of the models show that the average ejection fraction\ndecreases with decreasing stellar mass. For clusters efficient at ejecting O\nstars, the mass function of the ejected stars is top-heavy compared to the\ngiven initial mass function (IMF), while the mass function of stars that remain\nin the cluster becomes slightly steeper (top-light) than the IMF. The top-light\nmass functions of stars in 3 Myr old clusters in our N-body models agree well\nwith the mean mass function of young intermediate-mass clusters in M31, as\nreported previously. We show that the multiplicity fraction of the ejected\nmassive stars can be as high as 60%, that massive high-order multiple systems\ncan be dynamically ejected, and that high-order multiples become common\nespecially in the cluster. We also discuss binary populations of the ejected\nmassive systems. When a large kinematic survey of massive field stars becomes\navailable, for instance through Gaia, our results may be used to constrain the\nbirth configuration of massive stars in star clusters. (Abridged)\n", "  In supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, the superpartners of the\ntop quark (stops) play the crucial role in addressing the naturalness problem.\nFor direct pair-production of stops with each stop decaying into a top quark\nplus the lightest neutralino, the standard stop searches have difficulty\nfinding the stop for a compressed spectrum where the mass difference between\nthe stop and the lightest neutralino is close to the top quark mass, because\nthe events look too similar to the large $t\\bar{t}$ background. With an\nadditional hard ISR jet, the two neutralinos from the stop decays are boosted\nin the opposite direction and they can give rise to some missing transverse\nenergy. This may be used to distinguish the stop decays from the backgrounds.\nIn this paper we study the semileptonic decay of such signal events for the\ncompressed mass spectrum. Although the neutrino from the $W$ decay also\nproduces some missing transverse energy, its momentum can be reconstructed from\nthe kinematic assumptions and mass-shell conditions. It can then be subtracted\nfrom the total missing transverse momentum to obtain the neutralino\ncontribution. Because it suffers from less backgrounds, we show that the\nsemileptonic decay channel has a better discovery reach than the fully hadronic\ndecay channel along the compressed line $m_{\\tilde{t}} -\nm_{\\tilde{\\chi}}\\approx m_t$. With 300 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$, the 13 TeV LHC can\ndiscover the stop up to 500 GeV, covering the most natural parameter space\nregion.\n", "  The pattern of isentropes in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition\nis proposed as a key for a sub-classification. While the\nconfinement--deconfinement transition, conjectured to set in beyond a critical\nend point in the QCD phase diagram, is often related to an entropic transition\nand the apparently settled gas-liquid transition in nuclear matter is an\nenthalphic transition, the conceivable local isentropes w.r.t.\\ \"incoming\" or\n\"outgoing\" serve as another useful guide for discussing possible implications,\nboth in the presumed hydrodynamical expansion stage of heavy-ion collisions and\nthe core-collapse of supernova explosions. Examples, such as the quark-meson\nmodel and two-phase models, are shown to distinguish concisely the different\ntransitions.\n", "  We report a tentative correlation between the outflow characteristics derived\nfrom OH absorption at $119\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and [CII] emission at\n$158\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ in a sample of 22 local and bright ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies (ULIRGs). For this sample we investigate whether [CII] broad wings are\na good tracer of molecular outflows, and how the two tracers are connected.\nFourteen objects in our sample have a broad wing component as traced by [CII],\nand all of these also show OH119 absorption indicative of an outflow (in 1 case\nan inflow). The other eight cases, where no broad [CII] component was found,\nare predominantly objects with no OH outflow or a low-velocity ($\\leq\n100\\,\\text{km s}^{-1}$) OH outflow. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\nthe broad [CII] component shows a trend with the OH119 blue-shifted velocity,\nalthough with significant scatter. Moreover, and despite large uncertainties,\nthe outflow masses derived from OH and broad [CII] show a 1:1 relation. The\nmain conclusion is therefore that broad [CII] wings can be used to trace\nmolecular outflows. This may be particularly relevant at high redshift, where\nthe usual tracers of molecular gas (like low-J CO lines) become hard to\nobserve. Additionally, observations of blue-shifted Na I D $\\lambda\\lambda\n5890,5896$ absorption are available for ten of our sources. Outflow velocities\nof Na I D show a trend with OH velocity and broad [CII] FWHM. These\nobservations suggest that the atomic and molecular gas phases of the outflow\nare connected.\n", "  We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to map the emission of\nthe CO(6-5) molecular line and the 432 {\\mu}m continuum emission from the 300\npc-sized circumnuclear disk (CND) of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 with\na spatial resolution of ~4 pc. These observations spatially resolve the CND\nand, for the first time, image the dust emission, the molecular gas\ndistribution, and the kinematics from a 7-10 pc-diameter disk that represents\nthe submillimeter counterpart of the putative torus of NGC 1068. We fitted the\nnuclear spectral energy distribution of the torus using ALMA and near and\nmid-infrared (NIR/MIR) data with CLUMPY models. The mass and radius of the\nbest-fit solution for the torus are both consistent with the values derived\nfrom the ALMA data alone: Mgas_torus=(1+-0.3)x10^5 Msun and Rtorus=3.5+-0.5 pc.\nThe dynamics of the molecular gas in the torus show non-circular motions and\nenhanced turbulence superposed on the rotating pattern of the disk. The\nkinematic major axis of the CO torus is tilted relative to its morphological\nmajor axis. By contrast with the nearly edge-on orientation of the H2O\nmegamaser disk, we have found evidence suggesting that the molecular torus is\nless inclined (i=34deg-66deg) at larger radii. The lopsided morphology and\ncomplex kinematics of the torus could be the signature of the\nPapaloizou-Pringle instability, long predicted to likely drive the dynamical\nevolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) tori.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the static and dynamic behavior of long\nsemiflexible polymer chains in a melt. Starting from previously obtained fully\nequilibrated high molecular weight polymer melts [{\\it Zhang et al.} ACS Macro\nLett. 3, 198 (2014)] we investigate their static and dynamic scaling behavior\nas predicted by theory. We find that for semiflexible chains in a melt, results\nof the mean square internal distance, the probability distributions of the\nend-to-end distance, and the chain structure factor are well described by\ntheoretical predictions for ideal chains. We examine the motion of monomers and\nchains by molecular dynamics simulations using the ESPResSo++ package. The\nscaling predictions of the mean squared displacement of inner monomers, center\nof mass, and relations between them based on the Rouse and the reptation theory\nare verified, and related characteristic relaxation times are determined.\nFinally we give evidence that the entanglement length $N_{e,PPA}$ as determined\nby a primitive path analysis (PPA) predicts a plateau modulus,\n$G_N^0=\\frac{4}{5}(\\rho k_BT/N_e)$, consistent with stresses obtained from the\nGreen-Kubo relation. These comprehensively characterized equilibrium\nstructures, which offer a good compromise between flexibility, small $N_e$,\ncomputational efficiency, and small deviations from ideality provide ideal\nstarting states for future non-equilibrium studies.\n", "  We report on a general principle using the interlayer exchange coupling to\nextend the regime of chiral magnetic films in which stable or metastable\nmagnetic skyrmions can appear at zero magnetic field. We verify this concept on\nthe basis of a first-principles model for a Mn monolayer on W(001) substrate, a\nprototype chiral magnet for which the atomic-scale magnetic texture is\ndetermined by the frustration of exchange interactions, impossible to unwind by\nlaboratory magnetic fields. By means of \\textit{ab initio} calculations for the\nMn/W$_m$/Co$_n$/Pt/W(001) multilayer system we show that for certain\nthicknesses $m$ of the W spacer and $n$ of the Co reference layer, the\neffective field of the reference layer fully substitutes the required magnetic\nfield for skyrmion formation.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss dissipation process of the binary mixture gas in\nthe thermally relativistic flow \\textcolor{red}{by focusing on the\ncharacteristics of the diffusion flux}. As an analytical object, we consider\nthe relativistic rarefied-shock layer problem around the triangle prism.\nNumerical results of the diffusion flux are compared with the\nNavier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) order approximation of the diffusion flux, which is\ncalculated using the diffusion and thermal-diffusion coefficients by Kox\n\\textit{et al}. [Physica A, 84, 1, pp.165-174 (1976)]. In the case of the\nuniform flow with the small Lorentz contraction, the diffusion flux, which is\nobtained by calculating the relativistic Boltzmann equation, is roughly\napproximated by the NSF order approximation inside the shock wave, whereas the\ndiffusion flux in the vicinity of the wall is markedly different from the NSF\norder approximation. The magnitude of the diffusion flux, which is obtained by\ncalculating the relativistic Boltzmann equation, is similar to that of the NSF\norder approximation inside the shock wave, unlike the pressure deviator,\ndynamic pressure and heat flux, even when the Lorentz contraction in the\nuniform flow becomes large, because the diffusion flux does not depend on the\ngeneric Knudsen number from its definition in Eckart's frame.\n\\textcolor{red}{Finally, the author concludes that the accurate diffusion flux\nmust be calculated from the particle four flow, which is formulated using the\nfour velocity distinguished by each species of particles.\n", "  We study theoretically and experimentally how a thin layer of liquid flows\nalong a flexible beam. The flow is modelled using lubrication theory and the\nsubstrate is modelled as an elastica which deforms according to the\nEuler-Bernoulli equation. A constant flux of liquid is supplied at one end of\nthe beam, which is clamped horizontally, while the other end of the beam is\nfree. As the liquid film spreads, its weight causes the beam deflection to\nincrease, which in turn enhances the spreading rate of the liquid. This\nfeedback mechanism causes the front position ${\\sigma}$(t) and the deflection\nangle at the front ${\\phi}$(t) to go through a number of different power-law\nbehaviours. For early times, the liquid spreads like a horizontal gravity\ncurrent, with ${\\sigma}$(t) = $t^{4/5}$ and ${\\phi}$(t) = $t^{13/5}$. For\nintermediate times, the deflection of the beam leads to rapid acceleration of\nthe liquid layer, with ${\\sigma}$(t) = $t^4$ and ${\\phi}$(t) = $t^9$. Finally,\nwhen the beam has sagged to become almost vertical, the liquid film flows\ndownward with ${\\sigma}$(t) = $t$ and ${\\phi}$(t) ~ ${\\pi}$/2. We demonstrate\ngood agreement between these theoretical predictions and experimental results.\n", "  The accretion onto the black hole in the system HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 is\npowered by the strong line driven stellar wind of the O-type donor star. We\nstudy the X-ray properties of the stellar wind in the hard state of Cyg X-1 as\ndetermined with data from the Chandra High Energy Transmission Gratings. Large\ndensity and temperature inhomogeneities are present in the wind, with a\nfraction of the wind consisting of clumps of matter with higher density and\nlower temperature embedded in a photoionized gas. Absorption dips observed in\nthe light curve are believed to be caused by these clumps. This work\nconcentrates on the non-dip spectra as a function of orbital phase. The spectra\nshow lines of H-like and He-like ions of S, Si, Na, Mg, Al and highly ionized\nFe (Fe xvii-Fe xxiv). We measure velocity shifts, column densities, and thermal\nbroadening of the line series. The excellent quality of these five observations\nallows us to investigate the orbital phase dependence of these parameters. We\nshow that the absorber is located close to the black hole. Doppler shifted\nlines point at a complex wind structure in this region, while emission lines\nseen in some observations are from a denser medium than the absorber. The\nobserved line profiles are phase dependent. Their shapes vary from pure,\nsymmetric absorption at the superior conjunction to P Cygni profiles at the\ninferior conjunction of the black hole.\n", "  We investigate periodicities in mean heliographic latitudes of sunspot\ngroups, called active latitudes, for the last six complete solar cycles\n(1945-2008). For this purpose, the Multi Taper Method and Morlet Wavelet\nanalysis methods were used. We found the following: 1) Solar rotation\nperiodicities (26-38 days) are present in active latitudes of both hemispheres\nfor all the investigated cycles (18 to 23). 2) Both in the northern and\nsouthern hemispheres, active latitudes drifted towards the equator starting\nfrom the beginning to the end of each cycle by following an oscillating path.\nThese motions are well described by a second order polynomial. 3) There are no\nmeaningful periods between 55 and about 300 days in either hemisphere for all\ncycles. 4) A 300 to 370 day periodicity appears in both hemispheres for Cycle\n23, in the northern hemisphere for Cycle 20, and in the southern hemisphere for\nCycle 18.\n", "  We perform a complete decoupling of the degrees of freedom of quadratic\ngravity and the generic $f (R_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma \\rho})$ theory about any one of\ntheir possible vacua, i.e. maximally symmetric solution, find the masses of the\nspin-2 and spin-0 modes in explicit forms.\n", "  The origin of the magnetic field in massive O-type stars is still under\ndebate. To model the physical processes responsible for the generation of O\nstar magnetic fields, it is important to understand whether correlations\nbetween the presence of a magnetic field and stellar evolutionary state,\nrotation velocity, kinematical status, and surface composition can be\nidentified. The O4Ief supergiant zeta Pup is a fast rotator and a runaway star,\nwhich may be a product of a past binary interaction, possibly having had an\nencounter with the cluster Trumper 10 some 2Myr ago. The currently available\nobservational material suggests that certain observed phenomena in this star\nmay be related to the presence of a magnetic field. We acquired\nspectropolarimetric observations of zeta Pup with FORS2 mounted on the 8-m Antu\ntelescope of the VLT to investigate if a magnetic field is indeed present in\nthis star. We show that many spectral lines are highly variable and probably\nvary with the recently detected period of 1.78d. No magnetic field is detected\nin zeta Pup, as no magnetic field measurement has a significance level higher\nthan 2.4sigma. Still, we studied the probability of a single sinusoidal\nexplaining the variation of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements.\n", "  The complex pole mass of the top quark is presented at full two-loop order in\nthe Standard Model, augmenting the known four-loop QCD contributions. The input\nparameters are the MS-bar Yukawa and gauge couplings, the Higgs self-coupling,\nand the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV). Here, the VEV is defined as the\nminimum of the full effective potential in Landau gauge, so that tadpoles\nvanish. This is an alternative to earlier results that instead minimize the\ntree-level potential, resulting in a VEV that is gauge-fixing independent but\naccompanied by negative powers of the Higgs self-coupling in perturbative\nexpansions. The effects of non-zero Goldstone boson mass are eliminated by\nresummation. I also study the renormalization scale dependence of the\ncalculated pole mass.\n", "  Software-defined networking offers a device-agnostic programmable framework\nto encode new network functions. Externally centralized control plane\nintelligence allows programmers to write network applications and to build\nfunctional network designs. OpenFlow is a key protocol widely adopted to build\nprogrammable networks because of its programmability, flexibility and ability\nto interconnect heterogeneous network devices. We simulate the functional\ntopology of a multi-node quantum network that uses programmable network\nprinciples to manage quantum metadata for protocols such as teleportation,\nsuperdense coding, and quantum key distribution. We first show how the OpenFlow\nprotocol can manage the quantum metadata needed to control the quantum channel.\nWe then use numerical simulation to demonstrate robust programmability of a\nquantum switch via the OpenFlow network controller while executing an\napplication of superdense coding. We describe the software framework\nimplemented to carry out these simulations and we discuss near-term efforts to\nrealize these applications.\n", "  We report an experimental test of single-shot polarimetry applied to the\nproblem of real-time monitoring of the output polarization states in each core\nwithin a multicore fiber bundle. The technique uses a stress-engineered optical\nelement together with an analyzer and provides a point spread function whose\nshape unambiguously reveals the polarization state of a point source. We\nimplement this technique to monitor, simultaneously and in real time, the\noutput polarization states of up to 180 single mode fiber cores in both\nconventional and polarization-maintaining bundles. We demonstrate also that the\ntechnique can be used to fully characterize the polarization properties of each\nindividual ber core including eigen-polarization states, phase delay and\ndiattenuation.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate through first-principles calculation a new\nspin-dependent negative differential resistance (NDR) mechanism in magnetic\ntunnel junctions (MTJ) with cubic cation disordered crystals (CCDC) AlO$_x$ or\nMg$_{1-x}$Al$_x$O as barrier materials. The CCDC is a class of insulators whose\nband gap can be changed by cation doping. The gap becomes arched in an\nultrathin layer due to the space charge formed from metal-induced gap states.\nWith an appropriate combination of an arched gap and a bias voltage, NDR can be\nproduced in either spin channel. This mechanism is applicable to 2D and 3D\nultrathin junctions with a sufficiently small band gap that forms a large space\ncharge. It provides a new way of controlling the spin-dependent transport in\nspintronic devices by an electric field. A generalized Simmons formula for\ntunneling current through junction with an arched gap is derived to show the\ngeneral conditions under which ultrathin junctions may exhibit NDR.\n", "  This work provides a detailed investigation of the measured in-plane\nfield-swept homodyne-detected ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra of an\nextended Co/Cu/NiFe pseudo spin valve stack using a nanocontact (NC) geometry.\nThe magnetodynamics are generated by a pulse-modulated microwave current and\nthe resulting rectified dc mixing voltage, which appears across the NC at\nresonance, is detected using a lock-in amplifier. Most notably, we find that\nthe measured spectra of the NiFe layer are composite in nature and highly\nasymmetric, consistent with the broadband excitation of multiple modes.\nAdditionally, the data must be fit with two Lorentzian functions in order to\nextract a reasonable value for the Gilbert damping of the NiFe. Aided by\nmicromagnetic simulations, we conclude that (i) for in-plane fields the rf\nOersted field in the vicinity of the NC plays the dominant role in generating\nthe observed spectra, (ii) in addition to the FMR mode, exchange dominated spin\nwaves are also generated, and (iii) the NC diameter sets the mean wavevector of\nthe exchange dominated spin wave, in good agreement with the dispersion\nrelation.\n", "  One usually thinks of a radial density profile as having a monotonically\nchanging logarithmic slope, such as in NFW or Einasto profiles. However, in two\ndifferent classes of commonly used systems, this is often not the case. These\nclasses exhibit non-monotonic changes in their density profile slopes which we\ncall oscillations for short. We analyze these two unrelated classes separately.\nClass 1 consists of systems that have density oscillations and that are defined\nthrough their distribution function $f(E)$, or differential energy distribution\n$N(E)$, such as isothermal spheres, King profiles, or DARKexp, a theoretically\nderived model for relaxed collisionless systems. Systems defined through $f(E)$\nor $N(E)$ generally have density slope oscillations. Class 1 system\noscillations can be found at small, intermediate, or large radii but we focus\non a limited set of Class 1 systems that have oscillations in the central\nregions, usually at $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim -2$, where $r_{-2}$ is the largest\nradius where $d\\log(\\rho)/d\\log(r)=-2$. We show that the shape of their $N(E)$\ncan roughly predict the amplitude of oscillations. Class 2 systems which are a\nproduct of dynamical evolution, consist of observed and simulated galaxies and\nclusters, and pure dark matter halos. Oscillations in the density profile slope\nseem pervasive in the central regions of Class 2 systems. We argue that in\nthese systems, slope oscillations are an indication that a system is not fully\nrelaxed. We show that these oscillations can be reproduced by small\nmodifications to $N(E)$ of DARKexp. These affect a small fraction of systems'\nmass and are confined to $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim 0$. The size of these\nmodifications serves as a potential diagnostic for quantifying how far a system\nis from being relaxed.\n", "  A proton-proton collision data sample, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$ collected by LHCb at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV, is used\nto reconstruct $63\\pm9$ $\\Omega_b^-\\to\\Omega_c^0\\pi^-$, $\\Omega_c^0\\to\npK^-K^-\\pi^+$ decays. Using the $\\Xi_b^-\\to\\Xi_c^0\\pi^-$, $\\Xi_c^0\\to\npK^-K^-\\pi^+$ decay mode for calibration, the lifetime ratio and absolute\nlifetime of the $\\Omega_b^-$ baryon are measured to be \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\Omega_b^-}}{\\tau_{\\Xi_b^-}} &= 1.11\\pm0.16\\pm0.03, \\\\\n\\tau_{\\Omega_b^-} &= 1.78\\pm0.26\\pm0.05\\pm0.06~{\\rm ps}, \\end{align*} where the\nuncertainties are statistical, systematic and from the calibration mode (for\n$\\tau_{\\Omega_b^-}$ only). A measurement is also made of the mass difference,\n$m_{\\Omega_b^-}-m_{\\Xi_b^-}$, and the corresponding $\\Omega_b^-$ mass, which\nyields \\begin{align*} m_{\\Omega_b^-}-m_{\\Xi_b^-} &= 247.4\\pm3.2\\pm0.5~{\\rm\nMeV}/c^2, \\\\ m_{\\Omega_b^-} &= 6045.1\\pm3.2\\pm 0.5\\pm0.6~{\\rm MeV}/c^2.\n\\end{align*} These results are consistent with previous measurements.\n", "  We study a self-seeded high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) free-electron\nlaser (FEL) scheme to extend the wavelength of a soft X-ray FEL. This scheme\nuses a regular self-seeding monochromator to generate a seed laser at the\nwavelength of 1.52 nm, followed by a HGHG configuration to produce coherent,\nnarrow-bandwidth harmonic radiations at the GW level. The 2nd and 3rd harmonic\nradiation are investigated with start-to-end simulations. Detailed studies on\nthe FEL performance and shot-to-shot fluctuations are presented.\n", "  Our dedicated XMM-Newton monitoring, as well as archival Chandra and Swift\ndatasets, were used to examine the behaviour of the WN5h+O3V binary WR21a at\nhigh energies. For most of the orbit, the X-ray emission exhibits few\nvariations. However, an increase in strength of the emission is seen before\nperiastron, following a 1/D relative trend, where D is the separation between\nboth components. This increase is rapidly followed by a decline due to strong\nabsorption as the Wolf-Rayet (WR) comes in front. The fitted local absorption\nvalue appears to be coherent with a mass-loss rate of about 1x10^{-5} M_sol/yr\nfor the WR component. However, absorption is not the only parameter affecting\nthe X-ray emission at periastron as even the hard X-ray emission decreases,\nsuggesting a possible collapse of the colliding wind region near to or onto the\nphotosphere of the companion just before or at periastron. An eclipse may\nappear as another potential scenario, but it would be in apparent contradiction\nwith several lines of evidence, notably the width of the dip in the X-ray light\ncurve and the absence of variations in the UV light curve. Afterwards, the\nemission slowly recovers, with a strong hysteresis effect. The observed\nbehaviour is compatible with predictions from general wind-wind collision\nmodels although the absorption increase is too shallow.\n", "  The observed polarization properties of thermal radiation from isolated,\ncooling neutron stars depend on both the emission processes at the surface and\nthe effects of the magnetized vacuum which surrounds the star. Here we\ninvestigate the polarized thermal emission from X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron\nStars, taking RX J1856.5-3754 as a representative case. The physical conditions\nof the star outermost layers in these sources is still debated, and so we\nconsider emission from a magnetized atmosphere and a condensed surface,\naccounting for the effects of vacuum polarization as the radiation propagates\nin the star magnetosphere. We have found that, for a significant range of\nviewing geometries, measurement of the phase-averaged polarization fraction and\nphase-averaged polarization angle at both optical and X-ray wavelengths allow\nus to determine whether this neutron star has an atmosphere or a condensed\nsurface. Our results may therefore be relevant in view of future developments\nof soft X-ray polarimeters.\n", "  We present new HST optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry of the rich\nglobular cluster (GC) system of NGC 4874, the cD galaxy in the core of the Coma\ncluster (Abell 1656). NGC 4874 was observed with the HST Advanced Camera for\nSurveys in the F475W (g) and F814W (I) passbands and the Wide Field Camera 3 IR\nChannel in F160W (H). The GCs in this field exhibit a bimodal optical color\ndistribution with more than half of the GCs falling on the red side at g-I > 1.\nBimodality is also present, though less conspicuously, in the optical-NIR I-H\ncolor. Consistent with past work, we find evidence for nonlinearity in the g-I\nversus I-H color-color relation. Our results thus underscore the need for\nunderstanding the detailed form of the color-metallicity relations in\ninterpreting observational data on GC bimodality. We also find a very strong\ncolor-magnitude trend, or \"blue tilt,\" for the blue component of the optical\ncolor distribution of the NGC 4874 GC system. A similarly strong trend is\npresent for the overall mean I-H color as a function of magnitude; for M_814 <\n-10 mag, these trends imply a steep mass-metallicity scaling with $Z\\propto\nM_{\\rm GC}^{1.4\\pm0.4}$, but the scaling is not a simple power law and becomes\nmuch weaker at lower masses. As in other similar systems, the spatial\ndistribution of the blue GCs is more extended than that of the red GCs, partly\nbecause of blue GCs associated with surrounding cluster galaxies. In addition,\nthe center of the GC system is displaced by 4+/-1 kpc towards the southwest\nfrom the luminosity center of NGC 4874, in the direction of NGC 4872. Finally,\nwe remark on a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a noticeably asymmetrical GC\ndistribution. Interestingly, this dwarf has a velocity of nearly -3000 km/s\nwith respect to NGC 4874; we suggest it is on its first infall into the cluster\ncore and is undergoing stripping of its GC system by the cluster potential.\n", "  The results of a search for solar axions from the Korea Invisible Mass Search\n(KIMS) experiment at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory are presented.\nLow-energy electron-recoil events would be produced by conversion of solar\naxions into electrons via the axio-electric effect in CsI(Tl) crystals. Using\ndata from an exposure of 34,596 $\\rm kg \\cdot days$, we set a 90 \\% confidence\nlevel upper limit on the axion-electron coupling, $g_{ae}$, of $1.39 \\times\n10^{-11}$ for an axion mass less than 1 keV/$\\rm c^2$. This limit is lower than\nthe indirect solar neutrino bound, and fully excludes QCD axions heavier than\n0.48 eV/$\\rm c^2$ and 140.9 eV/$\\rm c^2$ for the DFSZ and KSVZ models\nrespectively.\n", "  While narrow absorption lines (NALs) are relatively stable, broad absorption\nlines (BALs) and mini-BAL systems usually show violent time variability within\na few years via a mechanism that is not yet understood. In this study, we\nexamine variable ionization state (VIS) scenario as a plausible mechanism, as\npreviously suspected. Over three years, we performed photometric monitoring\nobservations of four mini-BAL and five NAL quasars at $z_{\\rm em}$ $\\sim$ 2.0 -\n3.1 using the 105 cm Kiso Schmidt Telescope in $u$, $g$, and $i$-bands. We also\nperformed spectroscopic monitoring observation of one of our mini-BAL quasar\n(HS1603+3820) using the 188-cm Okayama Telescope over the same period as the\nphotometric observations. Our main results are as follows: (1) Structure\nfunction (SF) analysis revealed that the quasar UV flux variability over three\nyears was not large enough to support the VIS scenario, unless the ionization\ncondition of outflow gas is very low. (2) There was no crucial difference\nbetween the SFs of mini-BAL and NAL quasars. (3) The variability of the\nmini-BAL and quasar light curves was weakly synchronized with a small time\ndelay for HS1603+3820. These results suggest that the VIS scenario may need\nadditional mechanisms such as a variable shielding by X-ray warm absorbers.\n", "  The motion of a point like object of mass $M$ passing through the background\npotential of massive collisionless particles ($m << M$) suffers a steady\ndeceleration named dynamical friction. In his classical work, Chandrasekhar\nassumed a Maxwellian velocity distribution in the halo and neglected the self\ngravity of the wake induced by the gravitational focusing of the mass $M$. In\nthis paper, by relaxing the validity of the Maxwellian distribution due to the\npresence of long range forces, we derive an analytical formula for the\ndynamical friction in the context of the $q$-nonextensive kinetic theory. In\nthe extensive limiting case ($q = 1$), the classical Gaussian Chandrasekhar\nresult is recovered. As an application, the dynamical friction timescale for\nGlobular Clusters spiraling to the galactic center is explicitly obtained. Our\nresults suggest that the problem concerning the large timescale as derived by\nnumerical $N$-body simulations or semi-analytical models can be understood as a\ndeparture from the standard extensive Maxwellian regime as measured by the\nTsallis nonextensive $q$-parameter.\n", "  We compare the decay rates of excited populations directly calculated within\na Keldysh formalism to the equation of motion of the population itself for a\nHubbard-Holstein model in two dimensions. While it is true that these two\napproaches must give the same answer, it is common to make a number of\nsimplifying assumptions within the differential equation for the populations\nthat allows one to interpret the decay in terms of hot electrons interacting\nwith a phonon bath. Here we show how care must be taken to ensure an accurate\ntreatment of the equation of motion for the populations due to the fact that\nthere are identities that require cancellations of terms that naively look like\nthey contribute to the decay rates. In particular, the average time dependence\nof the Green's functions and self-energies plays a pivotal role in determining\nthese decay rates.\n", "  All-electron Fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations for the\nnonrelativistic ground-state energy of the water molecule at equilibrium\ngeometry are presented. The determinantal part of the trial wavefunction is\nobtained from a perturbatively selected Configuration Interaction calculation\n(CIPSI method) including up to about 1.4 million of determinants. Calculations\nare made using the cc-pCV$n$Z family of basis sets, with $n$=2 to 5. In\ncontrast with most QMC works no re-optimization of the determinantal part in\npresence of a Jastrow is performed. For the largest cc-pCV5Z basis set the\nlowest upper bound for the ground-state energy reported so far of -76.43744(18)\nis obtained. The fixed-node energy is found to decrease regularly as a function\nof the cardinal number $n$ and the Complete Basis Set limit (CBS) associated\nwith {\\it exact nodes} is easily extracted. The resulting energy of\n-76.43894(12) -in perfect agreement with the best experimentally derived value-\nis the most accurate theoretical estimate reported so far. We emphasize that\nemploying selected CI nodes of increasing quality in a given family of basis\nsets may represent a simple, deterministic, reproducible, and systematic way of\ncontrolling the fixed-node error in DMC.\n", "  Both the parallel residual stress and parallel turbulent acceleration driven\nby electrostatic collisionsless trapped electron mode (CTEM) turbulence are\ncalculated analytically using gyrokinetic theory. Quasilinear results show that\nthe parallel residual stress contributes an outward flux of co-current rotation\nfor normal magnetic shear and turbulence intensity profile increasing outward.\nThis may induce intrinsic counter-current rotation or flattening of the\nco-current rotation profile. The parallel turbulent acceleration driven by CTEM\nturbulence vanishes, due to the absence of a phase shift between density\nfluctuation and ion pressure fluctuation. This is different from the case of\nion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence, for which the turbulent acceleration\ncan provide co-current drive for normal magnetic shear and turbulence intensity\nprofile increasing outward. Its order of magnitude is predicted to be the same\nas that of the divergence of the residual stress [Lu Wang and P.H. Diamond,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 110}, 265006 (2013)]. A possible connection of these\ntheoretical results to experimental observations of electron cyclotron heating\neffects on toroidal rotation is discussed.\n", "  We study hypermagnetic helicity and lepton asymmetry evolution in plasma of\nthe early Universe before the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) accounting\nfor chirality flip processes via inverse Higgs decays and sphaleron transitions\nwhich violate the left lepton number and wash out the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse (BAU). In the scenario where the right electron asymmetry supports the\nBAU alone through the conservation law $B/3 - L_{eR}=const$ at temperatures\n$T>T_{RL}\\simeq 10~TeV$ the following universe cooling leads to the production\nof a non-zero left lepton (electrons and neutrinos) asymmetry. This is due to\nthe Higgs decays becoming more faster when entering the equilibrium at\n$T=T_{RL}$ with the universe expansion, $\\Gamma_{RL}\\sim T> H\\sim T^2$ ,\nresulting in the parallel evolution of the right and the left electron\nasymmetries at $T<T_{RL}$ through the corresponding Abelian anomalies in SM in\nthe presence of a seed hypermagnetic field. The hypermagnetic helicity\nevolution proceeds in a self-consistent way with the lepton asymmetry growth.\nThe role of sphaleron transitions decreasing the left lepton number turns out\nto be negligible in given scenario. The hypermagnetic helicity plays a key role\nin lepto/baryogenesis in our scenario and the more hypermagnetic field is close\nto the maximum helical one the faster BAU grows up the observable value ,\n$B_{obs}\\sim 10^{-10}$.\n", "  Motivated by stability considerations and observational evidence, we argue\nthat magnetars possess highly-tangled internal magnetic fields. We propose that\nthe quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen to accompany giant flares can be\nexplained as torsional modes supported by a tangled magnetic field, and we\npresent a simple model that supports this hypothesis for SGR 1900+14. Taking\nthe strength of the tangle as a free parameter, we find that the magnetic\nenergy in the tangle must dominate that in the dipolar component by a factor of\n$\\sim 14$ to accommodate the observed 28 Hz QPO. Our simple model provides\nuseful scaling relations for how the QPO spectrum depends on the bulk\nproperties of the neutron star and the tangle strength. The energy density in\nthe tangled field inferred for SGR 1900+14 renders the crust nearly dynamically\nirrelevant, a significant simplification for study of the QPO problem. The\npredicted spectrum is about three times denser than observed, which could be\nexplained by preferential mode excitation or beamed emission. We emphasize that\nfield tangling is needed to stabilize the magnetic field, so should not be\nignored in treatment of the QPO problem.\n", "  Measuring how the magnetic correlations throughout the Brillouin zone evolve\nin a Mott insulator as charges are introduced dramatically improved our\nunderstanding of the pseudogap, non-Fermi liquids and high $T_C$\nsuperconductivity. Recently, photoexcitation has been used to induce similarly\nexotic states transiently. However, understanding how these states emerge has\nbeen limited because of a lack of available probes of magnetic correlations in\nthe time domain, which hinders further investigation of how light can be used\nto control the properties of solids. Here we implement magnetic resonant\ninelastic X-ray scattering at a free electron laser, and directly determine the\nmagnetization dynamics after photo-doping the Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. We\nfind that the non-equilibrium state 2~ps after the excitation has strongly\nsuppressed long-range magnetic order, but hosts photo-carriers that induce\nstrong, non-thermal magnetic correlations. The magnetism recovers its\ntwo-dimensional (2D) in-plane N\\'eel correlations on a timescale of a few ps,\nwhile the three-dimensional (3D) long-range magnetic order restores over a far\nlonger, fluence-dependent timescale of a few hundred ps. The dramatic\ndifference in these two timescales, implies that characterizing the\ndimensionality of magnetic correlations will be vital in our efforts to\nunderstand ultrafast magnetic dynamics.\n", "  Recently, it has been proposed by Padmanabhan that the difference between the\nnumber of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the number of degrees\nof freedom in a bulk region leads to the expansion of the universe. Now, a\nnatural question arises, how this model could explain the oscillation of\nuniverse between contraction and expansion branches? We try to address this\nissue in the framework of BIonic system. In this model, $M0$-branes join to\neach other and give rise to a pair of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The fields which\nlive on these branes play the roles of massive gravitons that cause the\nemergence of a wormhole between them and formation of a BIon system. This\nwormhole dissolves into M1-branes and causes a divergence between the number of\ndegrees of freedom on the boundary surface of $M1$ and the bulk leading to an\nexpansion of $M1$-branes. When $M1$-branes become close to each other, the\nsquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states\nemerge. To removes these states, $M1$-branes compact, the sign of compacted\ngravity changes, causing the arising of anti-gravity: in this case, branes get\naway from each other. By articulating $M1$-BIons, an M3-brane and an\nanti-$M3$-brane are created and connected by three wormholes forming an\n$M3$-BIon. This new system behaves like the initial system and by closing\nbranes to each other, they compact and, by getting away from each other, they\nopen. Our universe is located on one of these M3-branes and, by compacting\n$M3$-brane, it contracts and, by opening it, it expands.\n", "  Phosphorus is a crucial element for the development of life, but so far\nP-bearing molecules have been detected only in a few astrophysical objects,\nhence its interstellar chemistry is almost totally unknown. Here we show new\ndetections of phosphorus nitride in a sample of dense cores in different\nevolutionary stages of the intermediate- and high-mass star formation process:\nstarless, with protostellar objects, and with ultracompact HII regions. All\ndetected PN line widths are smaller than ~5 km/s , and they arise from regions\nassociated with kinetic temperatures smaller than 100 K. Because the few\nprevious detections reported in the literature are associated with warmer and\nmore turbulent sources, the results of this work show that PN can arise from\nrelatively quiescent and cold gas. This information is challenging for\ntheoretical models that invoke either high desorption temperatures or grain\nsputtering from shocks to release phosphorus into the gas phase. Derived column\ndensities are of the order of 10^{11-12} cm^{-2}, marginally lower than the\nvalues derived in the few high-mass star forming regions detected so far. New\nconstraints on the column density upper limit of phosphorus monoxide, the\nfundamental unit of biologically relevant molecules, are also given.\n", "  It is emphasized that the bunching parameter $\\beta=P_B/P_D$ , i.e. the ratio\nbetween the probability to measure two bosons and two distinguishable particles\nat the same state, is a constant of motion and depends only on the overlap\nbetween the initial wavefunctions. This ratio is equal to $\\beta=2/(1+I^2)$ ,\nwhere $I$ is the overlap integral between the initial wavefunctions. That is,\nonly when the initial wavefunctions are orthogonal this ratio is equal to 2,\nhowever, this bunching ratio can be reduced to 1, when the two wavefunctions\nare identical. This simple equation explains the experimental evidences of a\nbeam splitter. A straightforward conclusion is that by measuring the local\nbunching parameter $\\beta$ (at any point in space and time) it is possible to\nevaluate a global parameter$ I$ (the overlap between the initial\nwavefunctions). The bunching parameter is then generalized to arbitrary number\nof particles, and in an analogy to the two-particles scenario, the well-known\nbosonic enhancement appears only when all states are orthogonal.\n", "  We present extensively dense observations of the super-Chandrasekhar\nsupernova (SC SN) candidate SN 2012dn from $-11$ to $+140$ days after the date\nof its $B$-band maximum in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths\nconducted through the OISTER ToO program. The NIR light curves and color\nevolutions up to 35 days after the $B$-band maximum provided an excellent match\nwith those of another SC SN 2009dc, providing a further support to the nature\nof SN 2012dn as a SC SN. We found that SN 2012dn exhibited strong excesses in\nthe NIR wavelengths from $30$ days after the $B$-band maximum. The $H$ and\n$K_{s}$-band light curves exhibited much later maximum dates at $40$ and $70$\ndays after the $B$-band maximum, respectively, compared with those of normal\nSNe Ia. The $H$ and $K_{s}$-band light curves subtracted by those of SN 2009dc\ndisplayed plateaued evolutions, indicating a NIR echo from the surrounding\ndust. The distance to the inner boundary of the dust shell is limited to be\n$4.8 - 6.4\\times10^{-2}$ pc. No emission lines were found in its early phase\nspectrum, suggesting that the ejecta-CSM interaction could not occur. On the\nother hand, we found no signature that strongly supports the scenario of dust\nformation. The mass loss rate of the pre-explosion system is estimated to be\n$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming that the wind velocity of the\nsystem is $10-100$ km~s$^{-1}$, which suggests that the progenitor of SN 2012dn\ncould be a recurrent nova system. We conclude that the progenitor of this SC SN\ncould be explained by the single-degenerate scenario.\n", "  We obtain stringent constraints on the actual efficiency of mass loss for red\ngiant branch stars in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc, by comparing\nsynthetic modeling based on stellar evolution tracks with the observed\ndistribution of stars along the horizontal branch in the\ncolour-magnitude-diagram. We confirm that the observed, wedge-shaped\ndistribution of the horizontal branch can be reproduced only by accounting for\na range of initial He abundances --in agreement with inferences from the\nanalysis of the main sequence-- and a red giant branch mass loss with a small\ndispersion. We have carefully investigated several possible sources of\nuncertainty that could affect the results of the horizontal branch modeling,\nstemming from uncertainties in both stellar model computations and the cluster\nproperties such as heavy element abundances, reddening and age. We determine a\nfirm lower limit of ~0.17$Mo for the mass lost by red giant branch stars,\ncorresponding to horizontal branch stellar masses between ~0.65Mo and ~0.73Mo\n(the range driven by the range of initial helium abundances). We also derive\nthat in this cluster the amount of mass lost along the asymptotic giant branch\nstars is comparable to the mass lost during the previous red giant branch\nphase. These results confirm for this cluster the disagreement between\ncolour-magnitude-diagram analyses and inferences from recent studies of the\ndynamics of the cluster stars, that predict a much less efficient red giant\nbranch mass loss. A comparison between the results from these two techniques\napplied to other clusters is required, to gain more insights about the origin\nof this disagreement.\n", "  Plasma energization through magnetic reconnection in the\nmagnetically-dominated regime featured by low plasma beta ($\\beta = 8 \\pi\nnkT_0/B^2 \\ll 1$) and/or high magnetization ($\\sigma = B^2/(4 \\pi nmc^2) \\gg\n1$) is important in a series of astrophysical systems such as solar flares,\npulsar wind nebula, and relativistic jets from black holes, etc. In this paper,\nwe review the recent progress on kinetic simulations of this process and\nfurther discuss plasma dynamics and particle acceleration in a low-$\\beta$\nreconnection layer that consists of electron-positron pairs. We also examine\nthe effect of different initial thermal temperatures on the resulting particle\nenergy spectra. While earlier papers have concluded that the spectral index is\nsmaller for higher $\\sigma$, our simulations show that the spectral index\napproaches $p=1$ for sufficiently low plasma $\\beta$, even if $\\sigma \\sim 1$.\nSince this predicted spectral index in the idealized limit is harder than most\nobservations, it is important to consider effects that can lead to a softer\nspectrum such as open boundary simulations. We also remark that the effects of\n3D reconnection physics and turbulence on reconnection need to be addressed in\nthe future.\n", "  Solutions of semiflexible polymers confined by repulsive planar walls are\nstudied by density functional theory and Molecular Dynamics simulations, to\nclarify the competition between the chain alignment favored by the wall and the\ndepletion caused by the monomer-wall repulsion. A coarse-grained bead-spring\nmodel with bond bending potential is studied, varying both the contour length\nand the persistence length of the polymers, as well as the monomer\nconcentration in the solution (good solvent conditions are assumed throughout,\nand solvent molecules are not included explicitly). The profiles of monomer\ndensity and pressure tensor components near the wall are studied, and the\nsurface tension of the solution is obtained. While the surface tension slightly\ndecreases with chain length for flexible polymers, it clearly increases with\nchain length for stiff polymers. Thus, at fixed density and fixed chain length\nthe surface tension also increases with increasing persistence length. Chain\nends always are enriched near the wall, but this effect is much larger for\nstiff polymers than for flexible ones. Also the profiles of the mean square\ngyration radius components near the wall and the nematic order parameter are\nstudied to clarify the conditions where wall-induced nematic order occurs.\n", "  The physical mechanisms driving star formation (SF) in galaxies are still not\nfully understood. Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), made of gas ejected during\ngalaxy interactions, seem to be devoid of dark matter and have a near-solar\nmetallicity. The latter makes it possible to study molecular gas and its link\nto SF using standard tracers (CO, dust) in a peculiar environment. We present a\ndetailed study of a nearby TDG in the Virgo Cluster, VCC 2062, using new\nhigh-resolution CO(1--0) data from the Plateau de Bure, deep optical imaging\nfrom the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), and complementary\nmultiwavelength data. Until now, there was some doubt whether VCC 2062 was a\ntrue TDG, but the new deep optical images from the NGVS reveal a stellar bridge\nbetween VCC 2062 and its parent galaxy, NGC 4694, which is clear proof of its\ntidal origin. Several high-resolution tracers (\\halpha, UV, 8~\\mi, and 24~\\mi)\nof the star formation rate (SFR) are compared to the molecular gas distribution\nas traced by the CO(1-0). Coupled with the SFR tracers, the NGVS data are used\nwith the CIGALE code to model the stellar populations throughout VCC 2062,\nyielding a declining SFR in the recent past, consistent with the low \\halpha/UV\nratio, and a high burst strength. HI emission covers VCC 2062, whereas the CO\nis concentrated near the HI maxima. The CO peaks correspond to two very\ndistinct regions: one with moderate SF to the NE and one with only slightly\nweaker CO emission but with nearly no SF. Even where SF is clearly present, the\nSFR is below the value expected from the surface density of the molecular and\nthe total gas as compared to spiral galaxies and other TDGs. After discussing\ndifferent possible explanations, we conclude that the low surface brightness is\na crucial parameter to understand the low SFR.\n", "  The fabrication precision is one of the most critical challenges on the way\nto the creation of practical photonic circuits composed of coupled high\nQ-factor microresonators. While very accurate transient tuning of\nmicroresonators based on local heating has been reported, the record precision\nof permanent resonance positioning achieved by post-processing is still within\n1-5 GHz. Here we demonstrate two coupled bottle microresonators fabricated at\nthe fiber surface which resonances are matched with a better than 0.16 GHz\nprecision. This corresponds to a better than 0.17 angstrom precision in the\neffective fiber radius variation. The achieved fabrication precision is only\nlimited by the resolution of our optical spectrum analyzer and can be\npotentially improved by an order of magnitude.\n", "  We study the variational principle on a Hilbert-Einstein action in an\nextended geometry with torsion taking into account non-trivial boundary\nconditions. We obtain an effective energy-momentum tensor that has its source\nin the torsion, which represents the matter geometrically induced. We explore\nabout the existence of magnetic monopoles and gravitational waves in this\ntorsional geometry. We conclude that the boundary terms can be identified as\npossible sources for the cosmological constant and torsion as the source of\nmagnetic monopoles. We examine an example in which gravitational waves are\nproduced during a de Sitter inflationary expansion of the universe.\n", "  We present observations at optical wavelengths with the Cassini Spacecraft's\nImaging Science System of the Phoebe ring, a vast debris disk around Saturn\nthat seems to be collisionally generated by its irregular satellites. The\nanalysis reveals a radial profile from 80-260 Saturn radii ($R_S$) that changes\nbehavior interior to $\\approx 110 R_S$, which we attribute to either the moon\nIapetus sweeping up small particles, or to orbital instabilities that cause the\nring to flare up vertically. Our study yields an integrated I/F at 0.635 $\\mu$m\nalong Saturn's shadow in the Phoebe ring's midplane from 80-250 $R_S$ of\n$2.7^{+0.9}_{-0.3} \\times 10^{-9}$. We develop an analytical model for the\nsize-dependent secular dynamics of retrograde Phoebe ring grains, and compare\nthis model to the observations. This analysis implies that 1) the \"Phoebe\" ring\nis partially sourced by debris from irregular satellites beyond Phoebe's orbit\nand 2) the scattered light signal is dominated by small grains ($\\lesssim\n20\\mu$m in size). If we assume that the Phoebe ring is generated through\nsteady-state micrometeoroid bombardment, this implies a power-law size\ndistribution with index $> 4$, which is unusually steep among solar system\nrings. This suggests either a steep size distribution of ejecta when material\nis initially released, or a subsequent process that preferentially breaks up\nlarge grains.\n", "  We have performed a spectral line survey called EMoCA toward Sagittarius\nB2(N) between 84 and 114 GHz with ALMA. Line intensities of the main isotopic\nspecies of ethyl cyanide and its singly 13C-substituted isotopomers observed\ntoward the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2) suggest that the doubly\n13C-substituted isotopomers should be detectable also. We want to determine the\nspectroscopic parameters of all three doubly 13C-substituted isotopologues of\nethyl cyanide to search for them in our ALMA data. We investigated the\nlaboratory rotational spectra of the three species between 150 and 990 GHz. We\nsearched for emission lines produced by these species in the ALMA spectrum of\nSgr B2(N2). We modeled their emission as well as the emission of the 12C and\nsingly 13C-substituted isotopologues assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium.\nWe identified more than 5000 rotational transitions, pertaining to more than\n3500 different transition frequencies, in the laboratory for each of the three\nisotopomers. The quantum numbers reach J ~ 115 and K_a ~ 35, resulting in\naccurate spectroscopic parameters and accurate rest frequency calculations\nbeyond 1000 GHz for strong to moderately weak transitions of either isotopomer.\nAll three species are unambiguously detected in our ALMA data. The 12C/13C\ncolumn density ratio of the isotopomers with one 13C atom to the ones with two\n13C atoms is about 25. Ethyl cyanide is the second molecule after methyl\ncyanide for which isotopologues containing two 13C atoms have been securely\ndetected in the interstellar medium. The model of our ethyl cyanide data\nsuggests that we should be able to detect vibrational satellites of the main\nspecies up to at least v_19 = 1 at 1130 K and up to v_13 + v_21 = 2 at 600 K\nfor the isotopologues with one 13C atom in our present ALMA data. Such\nsatellites may be too weak to be identified unambiguously for isotopologues\nwith two 13C atoms.\n", "  Spectral features introduced by instrumental chromaticity of radio\ninterferometers have the potential to negatively impact the ability to perform\nEpoch of Reionisation (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) science using the redshifted\nneutral hydrogen emission line from the early Universe. We describe instrument\ncalibration choices that influence the spectral characteristics of the science\ndata, and assess their impact on EoR statistical and tomographic experiments.\nPrincipally, we consider the intrinsic spectral response of the receiving\nantennas, embedded within a complete frequency-dependent primary beam response,\nand frequency-dependent instrument sampling. We assess different options for\nbandpass calibration. The analysis is applied to the proposed SKA1-Low EoR/CD\nexperiments. We provide tolerances on the smoothness of the SKA station primary\nbeam bandpass, to meet the scientific goals of statistical and tomographic\n(imaging) EoR programs. Two calibration strategies are tested: (1) fitting of\neach fine channel independently, and (2) fitting of an nth-order polynomial for\neach ~1~MHz coarse channel with (n+1)th-order residuals (n=2,3,4). Strategy (1)\nleads to uncorrelated power in the 2D power spectrum proportional to the\nthermal noise power, thereby reducing the overall array sensitivity. Strategy\n(2) leads to correlated residuals from the fitting, and residual signal power\nwith (n+1)th-order curvature. For the residual power to be less than the\nthermal noise, the fractional amplitude of a fourth-order term in the bandpass\nacross a single coarse channel must be <2.5% (50~MHz), <0.5% (150~MHz), <0.8%\n(200~MHz). The tomographic experiment places stringent constraints on phase\nresiduals in the bandpass. We find that the root-mean-square variability over\nall stations of the change in phase across any fine channel (4.578~kHz) should\nnot exceed 0.2 degrees.\n", "  The analysis of the early star formation history (SFH) of nearby galaxies,\nobtained from their resolved stellar populations is relevant as a test for\ncosmological models. However, the early time resolution of observationally\nderived SFHs is limited by several factors. Thus, direct comparison of\nobservationally derived SFHs with those derived from theoretical models of\ngalaxy formation is potentially biased. Here we investigate and quantify this\neffect. For this purpose, we analyze the duration of the early star formation\nactivity in a sample of four Local Group dwarf galaxies and test whether they\nare consistent with being true fossils of the pre-reionization era; i.e., if\nthe quenching of their star formation occurred before cosmic reionization by UV\nphotons was completed. Two classical dSph (Cetus and Tucana) and two dTrans\n(LGS-3 and Phoenix) isolated galaxies with total stellar masses between\n$1.3\\times 10^6$ to $7.2\\times 10^6$ M$_\\odot$ have been studied. Accounting\nfor time resolution effects, the SFHs peak as much as 1.25 Gyr earlier than the\noptimal solutions. Thus, this effect is important for a proper comparison of\nmodel and observed SFHs. It is also shown that none of the analyzed galaxies\ncan be considered a true-fossil of the pre-reionization era, although it is\npossible that the {\\it outer regions} of Cetus and Tucana are consistent with\nquenching by reionization.\n", "  Collinear laser spectroscopy has been performed on the $^{79}_{30}$Zn$_{49}$\nisotope at ISOLDE-CERN. The existence of a long-lived isomer with a few hundred\nmilliseconds half-life was confirmed, and the nuclear spins and moments of the\nground and isomeric states in $^{79}$Zn as well as the isomer shift were\nmeasured. From the observed hyperfine structures, spins $I = 9/2$ and $I = 1/2$\nare firmly assigned to the ground and isomeric states. The magnetic moment\n$\\mu$ ($^{79}$Zn) = $-$1.1866(10) $\\mu_{\\rm{N}}$, confirms the spin-parity\n$9/2^{+}$ with a $\\nu g_{9/2}^{-1}$ shell-model configuration, in excellent\nagreement with the prediction from large scale shell-model theories. The\nmagnetic moment $\\mu$ ($^{79m}$Zn) = $-$1.0180(12) $\\mu_{\\rm{N}}$ supports a\npositive parity for the isomer, with a wave function dominated by a 2h-1p\nneutron excitation across the $N = 50$ shell gap. The large isomer shift\nreveals an increase of the intruder isomer mean square charge radius with\nrespect to that of the ground state: $\\delta \\langle r^{2}_{c}\\rangle^{79,79m}$\n= +0.204(6) fm$^{2}$, providing first evidence of shape coexistence.\n", "  We investigated the upper critical magnetic field, $H_{c}$, of a\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet (S/F) bilayer of Nb/Cu$_{41}$Ni$_{59}$ and a Nb film\n(as reference). We obtained the dependence of $H_{c\\perp}$ and $H_{c\\parallel}$\n(perpendicular and parallel to the film plane, respectively) on the\ntemperature, $T$, by measurements of the resistive transitions and the\ndependence on the inclination angle, $\\theta$, of the applied field to the film\nplane, by non-resonant microwave absorption. Over a wide range, $H_{c\\perp}$\nand $H_{c\\parallel}$ show the temperature dependence predicted by the\nGinzburg-Landau theory. At low temperatures and close to the critical\ntemperature deviations are observed. While $H_{c}(\\theta)$ of the Nb film\nfollows the Tinkham prediction for thin superconducting films, the\nNb/Cu$_{41}$Ni$_{59}$-bilayer data exhibit deviations when $\\theta$ approaches\nzero. We attribute this finding to the additional anisotropy induced by the\nquasi-one-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-like state and\npropose a new vortex structure in S/F bilayers, adopting the segmentation\napproach from high-temperature superconductors.\n", "  A versatile linear dusty (complex) plasma device is designed to study the\ntransport and dynamical behavior of dust particles in a large volume. Diffused\ninductively coupled plasma is generated in the background of argon gas. A novel\ntechnique is used to introduce the dust particles in the main plasma by\nstriking a secondary direct current (DC) glow discharge. These dust particles\nare found to get trapped in an electrostatic potential well which is formed due\nto the combination of the ambipolar electric field caused by diffusive plasma\nand the field produced by the charged glass wall of the vacuum chamber.\nAccording to the requirements, the volume of the dust cloud can be controlled\nvery precisely by tuning the plasma and discharge parameters. The present\ndevice can be used to address the underlying physics behind the transport of\ndust particles, self excited dust acoustic waves and instabilities. The\ndetailed design of this device, plasma production and characterization,\ntrapping and transport of the dust particle and some of the preliminary\nexperimental results are presented.\n", "  We study, numerically and experimentally, the momentum distribution of atoms\ncooled in optical lattices. Using semi-classical simulations, we show that this\ndistribution is bimodal, made up of a central feature corresponding to \"cold\",\ntrapped atoms, with tails of \"hot\", untrapped atoms, and that this holds true\nalso for very shallow potentials. Careful analysis of the distribution of\nhigh-momentum untrapped atoms, both from simulations and experiments, shows\nthat the tails of the distribution does not follow a normal law, hinting at a\npower-law distribution and non-ergodic behavior. We also revisit the phenomenon\nof d\\'ecrochage, the potential depth below which the temperature of the atoms\nstarts increasing.\n", "  We investigate the electromagnetic response of a relativistic Fermi gas at\nfinite temperatures. Our theoretical results are first-order in the\nfine-structure constant. The electromagnetic permittivity and permeability are\nintroduced via general constitutive relations in reciprocal space, and computed\nfor different values of the gas density and temperature. As expected, the\nelectric permittivity of the relativistic Fermi gas is found in good agreement\nwith the Lindhard dielectric function in the low-temperature limit.\nApplications to condensed-matter physics are briefly discussed. In particular,\ntheoretical results are in good agreement with experimental measurements of the\nplasmon energy in graphite and tin oxide, as functions of both the temperature\nand wave vector. We stress that the present electromagnetic response of a\nrelativistic Fermi gas at finite temperatures could be of potential interest in\nfuture plasmonic and photonic investigations.\n", "  The young star V1331 Cyg received previous attention because it is surrounded\nby an optical, arc-like reflection nebula. V1331 Cyg is commonly considered to\nbe a candidate for an object that has undergone an FU-Ori (FUOR) the outbreak\nin the past. This in turn could lead to a time-varying appearance of the dusty\narcs that may be revealed by multi-epoch imaging. In particular, a radial\ncolour analysis of the dust arcs can then be attempted to check whether radial\ngrain size distribution was modified by a previous FUOR wind. Second-epoch\nimaging of V1331 Cyg was obtained by us in 2009 using the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). By comparing this to archival HST data from 2000, we studied\nthe time evolution of the circumstellar nebulae. After a point spread function\nsubtraction using model point spread functions, we used customised routines to\nperform a proper motion analysis. The nebula expansion was first derived by\ndeconvolving and correlating the two-epoch radial brightness profiles.\nAdditional data from other facilities TLS, UKIDSS, SPITZER, and HERSCHEL were\nalso incorporated to improve our understanding of the star in terms of\nenvironment, viewing angle, bipolar outflow length, and the FUOR phenomenon.\nThe derived radial colour profiles do not indicate a spatial separation of the\ndust grain sizes. The HERSCHEL 160 micron images show for the time thermal\nemission from dust probably residing in the outer arc. By viewing V1331 Cyg\nalmost pole-on, the length of the bipolar outflow exceeds previous estimates by\nfar. The outer arc expansion timescale is consistent with the implantation time\nof the CO torus, which supports the hypothesis of an outburst that occurred a\nfew thousand years ago. The azimuthal colour variation of the outer arc is\nprobably due to changes of the scattering angle, imposed by a tilt or helical\ngeometry of the dust configuration.\n", "  The underlying Dirac point is central to the profound physics manifested in a\nwide class of materials. However, it is often difficult to drive a system with\nDirac points across the massless fermionic critical point. Here by exploiting\nscreening of local moments under spin-orbit interactions in a Kondo lattice, we\nshow that below the Kondo temperature, the Kondo lattice undergoes a\ntopological transition from a strong topological insulator to a weak\ntopological insulator at a finite temperature $T_D$. At $T_D$, massless Dirac\npoints emerge and the Kondo lattice becomes a Dirac semimetal. Our analysis\nindicates that the emergent relativistic symmetry dictates non-trivial thermal\nresponses over large parameter and temperature regimes. In particular, it\nyields critical scaling behaviors both in magnetic and transport responses near\n$T_D$.\n", "  Context: The high-fidelity solar spectral atlas prepared by Delbouille and\nco-workers (Li\\`ege atlas), and the one by Neckel and co-workers (Hamburg\natlas), are widely recognised as the most important reference spectra of the\nSun at disc-centre in the visible wavelength range. Both datasets serve as\nfundamental resources for many researchers, in particular for chemical\nabundance analysis. But despite their similar published specifications\n(spectral resolution, noise level), the shapes of spectral lines in the two\natlases differ significantly and systematically.\n  Aims: Knowledge of any instrumental degradations is imperative to fully\nexploit the information content of spectroscopic data. We seek to investigate\nthe magnitude---and to explain the possible sources---of these differences. We\nprovide the wavelength-dependent correction parameters that need to be taken\ninto account when the spectra are to be compared with e.g. synthetic data.\n  Methods: A parametrically degraded version of the Hamburg spectrum is fitted\nto the Li\\`ege spectrum. The parameters of the model (wavelength shift,\nbroadening, intensity scaling, intensity offset) represent the different\ncharacteristics of the respective instruments, observational strategies and\ndata processing.\n  Results: The wavelength scales of the Li\\`ege and Hamburg atlases differ on\naverage by 0.5 m{\\AA} with a standard deviation of $\\pm$2 m{\\AA}, except for a\npeculiar region around 5500 {\\AA}. The continuum levels are offset by up to 18%\nbelow 5000 {\\AA} but stably at a 0.8% difference towards the red. We find no\nevidence for spectral straylight in the Li\\`ege spectrum. Its resolving power\nis almost independent of wavelength but limited to about 216000, between two to\nsix times less than specified. When accounting for the degradations determined\nin this work, the spectra of the two atlases agree within a few parts in\n10$^3$.\n", "  We study the shadows cast by the different types of rotating regular black\nholes viz. Ay\\'on-Beato-Garc\\'ia {(ABG)}, Hayward, and Bardeen. These black\nholes have in addition to the total mass ($M$) and rotation parameter ($a$),\ndifferent parameters as electric charge ($Q$), deviation parameter ($g$), and\nmagnetic charge ($g_{*}$), respectively. Interestingly, the size of the shadow\nis affected by these parameters in addition to the rotation parameter. We found\nthat the radius of the shadow in each case decreases monotonically and the\ndistortion parameter increases when the value of these parameters increase. A\ncomparison with the standard Kerr case is also investigated. We have also\nstudied the influence of the plasma environment around regular black holes to\ndiscuss its shadow. The presence of the plasma affects the apparent size of the\nregular black hole's shadow to be increased due to two effects (i)\ngravitational redshift of the photons and (ii) radial dependence of plasma\ndensity.\n", "  Recent cosmic microwave background data in temperature and polarization have\nreached high precision in estimating all the parameters that describe the\ncurrent so-called standard cosmological model. Recent results about the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from cosmic microwave background anisotropies,\ngalaxy surveys, and their cross-correlations are presented. Looking at fine\nsignatures in the cosmic microwave background, such as the lack of power at low\nmultipoles, the primordial power spectrum and the bounds on non-Gaussianities,\ncomplemented by galaxy surveys, we discuss inflationary physics and the\ngeneration of primordial perturbations in the early Universe. Three important\ntopics in particle physics, the bounds on neutrinos masses and parameters, on\nthermal axion mass and on the neutron lifetime derived from cosmological data\nare reviewed, with attention to the comparison with laboratory experiment\nresults. Recent results from cosmic polarization rotation analyses aimed at\ntesting the Einstein equivalence principle are presented. Finally, we discuss\nthe perspectives of next radio facilities for the improvement of the analysis\nof future cosmic microwave background spectral distortion experiments.\n", "  These lecture notes and example problems are based on a course given at the\nUniversity of Cambridge in Part III of the Mathematical Tripos.\n  Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena,\nsuch as the formation and internal dynamics of stars and giant planets, the\nworkings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes, and the\ndynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in\nastrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the\ndynamical influence of the magnetic field that is 'frozen in' to a highly\nconducting plasma.\n  The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas\ndynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The\nmathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated\nconservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for\nboth analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical\ninterpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other\ndiscontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a\nsupernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be\nsolved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal\nthe physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations\ndetermine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as determining\ntheir stability and their response to tidal forcing.\n", "  We investigate whether open clusters (OCs) tend to energy equipartition, by\nmeans of direct N-body simulations with a broken power-law mass function. We\nfind that the simulated OCs become strongly mass segregated, but the local\nvelocity dispersion does not depend on the stellar mass for most of the mass\nrange: the curve of the velocity dispersion as a function of mass is nearly\nflat even after several half-mass relaxation times, regardless of the adopted\nstellar evolution recipes and Galactic tidal field model. This result holds\nboth if we start from virialized King models and if we use clumpy sub-virial\ninitial conditions. The velocity dispersion of the most massive stars and\nstellar remnants tends to be higher than the velocity dispersion of the lighter\nstars. This trend is particularly evident in simulations without stellar\nevolution. We interpret this result as a consequence of the strong mass\nsegregation, which leads to Spitzer's instability. Stellar winds delay the\nonset of the instability. Our simulations strongly support the result that OCs\ndo not attain equipartition, for a wide range of initial conditions.\n", "  We present the results of our ALMA Cycle 2 high angular resolution (0.1-0.2\narcsec) observations of the nuclear region of the nearby well-studied type-2\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 1068, at HCN J=3-2 and HCO+ J=3-2 emission\nlines. For the first time, due to a higher angular resolution than previous\nstudies, we clearly detected dense molecular gas emission at the putative AGN\nlocation, identified as a ~1.1 mm (~266 GHz) continuum emission peak, by\nseparating this emission from brighter emission located at 0.5-2.0 arcsec on\nthe eastern and western sides of the AGN. The estimated intrinsic molecular\nemission size and dense molecular mass, which are thought to be associated with\nthe putative dusty molecular torus around an AGN, were ~10 pc and ~several x\n10^5 Msun, respectively. HCN-to-HCO+ J=3-2 flux ratios substantially higher\nthan unity were found throughout the nuclear region of NGC 1068. The continuum\nemission displayed an elongated morphology along the direction of the radio jet\nlocated at the northern side of the AGN, as well as a weak spatially resolved\ncomponent at ~2.0 arcsec on the southwestern side of the AGN. The latter\ncomponent most likely originated from star formation, with the estimated\nluminosity more than one order of magnitude lower than the luminosity of the\ncentral AGN. No vibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=3-2 emission lines were\ndetected for HCN and HCO+ across the field of view.\n", "  We report the distance and [Fe/H] value for the globular cluster NGC 5904\n(M5) derived from the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of selected\nRRab and RRc stars. The aim in doing this was to bring these parameters into\nthe homogeneous scales established by our previous work on numerous other\nglobular clusters, allowing a direct comparison of the horizontal branch\nluminosity in clusters with a wide range of metallicities. Our CCD photometry\nof the large variable star population of this cluster is used to discuss light\ncurve peculiarities, like Blazhko modulations, on an individual basis. New\nBlazhko variables are reported.\n  From the RRab stars we found [Fe/H]$_{\\rm UVES} = -1.335 \\pm\n0.003{\\rm(statistical)} \\pm 0.110{\\rm(systematic)}$, and a distance of $7.6\\pm\n0.2$ kpc, and from the RRc stars we found [Fe/H]$_{\\rm UVES}$ = $-1.39 \\pm\n0.03{\\rm(statistical)} \\pm 0.12{\\rm(systematic)}$ and a distance of $7.5 \\pm\n0.3$ kpc. The results for RRab and RRc stars should be considered independent\nsince they come from different calibrations and zero points. Absolute\nmagnitudes, radii and masses are also reported for individual RR Lyrae stars.\nThe distance to the cluster was calculated by alternative methods like the P-L\nrelation of SX Phe and the luminosity of the stars at the tip of the red giant\nbranch; we obtained $7.7 \\pm 0.4$ and $7.2-7.5$ kpc respectively.\n  The distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the instability strip is discussed and\ncompared with other clusters in connection with the Oosterhoff and horizontal\nbranch type. The Oosterhoff type II clusters systematically show a RRab-RRc\nsegregation about the instability strip first-overtone red edge, while the\nOosterhoff type I clusters may or may not display this feature. A group of RR\nLyrae stars is identified in an advanced evolutionary stage, and two of them\nare likely binaries with unseen companions.\n", "  States in the $N=28$ nucleus $^{46}$Ar have been studied by a two-neutron\ntransfer reaction at REX-ISOLDE (CERN). A beam of radioactive $^{44}$ at an\nenergy of 2.16~AMeV and a tritium loaded titanium target were used to populate\n$^{46}$ by the t($^{44}$,p) two-neutron transfer reaction. Protons emitted from\nthe target were identified in the T-REX silicon detector array. The excitation\nenergies of states in $^{46}$ have been reconstructed from the measured angles\nand energies of recoil protons. Angular distributions for three final states\nwere measured and based on the shape of the differential cross section an\nexcited state at 3695~keV has been identified as $J^\\pi = 0^+$. The angular\ndifferential cross section for the population of different states are compared\nto calculations using a reaction model employing both sequential and direct\ntransfer of two neutrons. Results are compared to shell model calculations\nusing state-of-the-art effective interactions.\n", "  We present simulations of the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray light curve of\nthe Crab pulsar as observed by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The CTA\npulse profile of the Crab pulsar is simulated with the specific goal of\ndetermining the accuracy of the position of the interpulse. We fit the pulse\nshape obtained by the MAGIC telescope with a three-Gaussian template and\nrescale it to account for the different CTA instrumental and observational\nconfigurations. Simulations are performed for different configurations of CTA\nand for the ASTRI mini-array. The northern CTA configuration will provide an\nimprovement of a factor of ~3 in accuracy with an observing time comparable to\nthat of MAGIC (73 hours). Unless the VHE spectrum above 1 TeV behaves\ndifferently from what we presently know, unreasonably long observing times are\nrequired for a significant detection of the pulsations of the Crab pulsar with\nthe high-energy-range sub-arrays. We also found that an independent VHE timing\nanalysis is feasible with Large Size Telescopes (LSTs). CTA will provide a\nsignificant improvement in determining the VHE pulse shape parameters necessary\nto constrain theoretical models of the gamma-ray emission of the Crab pulsar.\nOne of such parameters is the shift in phase between peaks in the pulse profile\nat VHE and in other energy bands that, if detected, may point to different\nlocations of the emission regions.\n", "  We investigate, theoretically and experimentally, a photonic realization of a\nSawtooth lattice. This special lattice exhibits two spectral bands, with one of\nthem experiencing a complete collapse to a highly degenerate flat band for a\nspecial set of inter-site coupling constants. We report the ob- servation of\ndifferent transport regimes, including strong transport inhibition due to the\nappearance of the non-diffractive flat band. Moreover, we excite localized\nShockley surfaces states, residing in the gap between the two linear bands.\n", "  Tidal dissipation is the main driver of orbital evolution of natural\nsatellites and a key point to understand the exoplanetary system\nconfigurations. Despite its importance, its quantification from observations\nstill remains difficult for most objects of our own Solar system. In this work,\nwe overview the method that has been used to determine, directly from\nobservations, the tidal parameters, with emphasis on the Love number k2 and the\ntidal quality factor Q. Up-to-date values of these tidal parameters are\nsummarized. Last, an assessment on the possible determination of the tidal\nratio k2/Q of Uranus and Neptune is done. This may be particularly relevant for\ncoming astrometric campaigns and future space missions focused on these\nsystems.\n", "  We show that the space charge dynamics of high intensity beams in the plane\nperpendicular to the magnetic field in cyclotrons is described by the\ntwo-dimensional Euler equations for an incompressible fluid. This analogy with\nfluid dynamics gives a unified and intuitive framework to explain the beam\nspiraling and beam break up behavior observed in experiments and in\nsimulations. In particular, we demonstrate that beam break up is the result of\na classical instability occurring in fluids subject to a sheared flow. We give\nscaling laws for the instability and predict the nonlinear evolution of beams\nsubject to it. Our work suggests that cyclotrons may be uniquely suited for the\nexperimental study of shear layers and vortex distributions that are not\nachievable in Penning-Malmberg traps.\n", "  We present radio Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) luminosity functions over the\nredshift range 0.005 < z < 0.75. The sample from which the luminosity functions\nare constructed is an optical spectroscopic survey of radio galaxies,\nidentified from matched Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm survey\n(FIRST) sources and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images.The radio AGN are\nseparated into Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) and High Excitation Radio\nGalaxies (HERGs) using the optical spectra. We derive radio luminosity\nfunctions for LERGs and HERGs separately in the three redshift bins (0.005 < z\n< 0.3, 0.3 < z < 0.5 and 0.5 < z <0.75). The radio luminosity functions can be\nwell described by a double power-law. Assuming this double power-law shape the\nLERG population displays little or no evolution over this redshift range\nevolving as ~$(1+z)^{0.06}$ assuming pure density evolution or ~ $(1+z)^{0.46}$\nassuming pure luminosity evolution. In contrast, the HERG population evolves\nmore rapidly, best fitted by ~$(1+z)^{2.93}$ assuming a double power-law shape\nand pure density evolution. If a pure luminosity model is assumed the best\nfitting HERG evolution is parameterised by ~$(1+z)^{7.41}$. The characteristic\nbreak in the radio luminosity function occurs at a significantly higher power\n(~1 dex) for the HERG population in comparison to the LERGs. This is consistent\nwith the two populations representing fundamentally different accretion modes.\n", "  We consider the theoretical possibility to generate a narrow resonance in the\nfour neutron system as suggested by a recent experimental result. To that end,\na phenomenological $T=3/2$ three neutron force is introduced, in addition to a\nrealistic $NN$ interaction. We inquire what should be the strength of the $3n$\nforce in order to generate such a resonance. The reliability of the\nthree-neutron force in the $T=3/2$ channel is exmined, by analyzing its\nconsistency with the low-lying $T=1$ states of $^4$H, $^4$He and $^4$Li and the\n$^3{\\rm H} + n$ scattering.\n  The {\\it ab initio} solution of the $4n$ Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is obtained\nusing the complex scaling method with boundary conditions appropiate to the\nfour-body resonances. We find that in order to generate narrow $4n$ resonant\nstates a remarkably attractive $3N$ force in the $T=3/2$ channel is required.\n", "  Supernova (SN) blast waves inject energy and momentum into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM), control its turbulent multiphase structure and the launching of\ngalactic outflows. Accurate modelling of the blast wave evolution is therefore\nessential for ISM and galaxy formation simulations. We present an efficient\nmethod to compute the input of momentum, thermal energy, and the velocity\ndistribution of the shock-accelerated gas for ambient media with uniform (and\nwith stellar wind blown bubbles), power-law, and turbulent density\ndistributions. Assuming solar metallicity cooling, the blast wave evolution is\nfollowed to the beginning of the momentum conserving snowplough phase. The\nmodel recovers previous results for uniform ambient media. The momentum\ninjection in wind-blown bubbles depend on the swept-up mass and the efficiency\nof cooling, when the blast wave hits the wind shell. For power-law density\ndistributions with $n(r) \\sim$ $r^{-2}$ (for $n(r) > n_{_{\\rm floor}}$) the\namount of momentum injection is solely regulated by the background density\n$n_{_{\\rm floor}}$ and compares to $n_{_{\\rm uni}}$ = $n_{_{\\rm floor}}$.\nHowever, in turbulent ambient media with log-normal density distributions the\nmomentum input can increase by a factor of 2 (compared to the homogeneous case)\nfor high Mach numbers. The average momentum boost can be approximated as\n$p_{_{\\rm turb}}/\\mathrm{p_{_{0}}}\\ =23.07\\, \\left(\\frac{n_{_{0,\\rm\nturb}}}{1\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}}\\right)^{-0.12} + 0.82\n(\\ln(1+b^{2}\\mathcal{M}^{2}))^{1.49}\\left(\\frac{n_{_{0,\\rm turb}}}{1\\,{\\rm\ncm}^{-3}}\\right)^{-1.6}$. The velocity distributions are broad as gas can be\naccelerated to high velocities in low-density channels. The model values agree\nwith results from recent, computationally expensive, three-dimensional\nsimulations of SN explosions in turbulent media.\n", "  We report the discovery of pulsations in three mixed-atmosphere, extremely\nlow-mass white dwarf (ELM WD, M $\\leqslant$ 0.3 M$_{\\odot}$) precursors.\nFollowing the recent discoveries of pulsations in both ELM and pre-ELM WDs, we\ntargeted pre-ELM WDs with mixed H/He atmospheres with high-speed photometry. We\nfind significant optical variability in all three observed targets with periods\nin the range 320--590 s, consistent in timescale with theoretical predictions\nof $p$-mode pulsations in mixed-atmosphere $\\approx$ 0.18 M$_{\\odot}$ He-core\npre-ELM WDs. This represents the first empirical evidence that pulsations in\npre-ELM WDs can only occur if a significant amount of He is present in the\natmosphere. Future, more extensive, time-series photometry of the brightest of\nthe three new pulsators offers an excellent opportunity to constrain the\nthickness of the surface H layer, which regulates the cooling timescales for\nELM WDs.\n", "  In this work, we present a comparative study of the accuracy provided by the\nWang-Landau sampling and the Broad Histogram method to estimate de density of\nstates of the two dimensional Ising ferromagnet. The microcanonical averages\nused to describe the thermodynamic behaviour and to use the Broad Histogram\nmethod were obtained using the single spin-flip Wang-Landau sampling,\nattempting to convergence issues and accuracy improvements. We compare the\nresults provided by both techniques with the exact ones for thermodynamic\nproperties and critical exponents. Our results, within the Wang-Landau\nsampling, reveal that the Broad Histogram approach provides a better\ndescription of the density of states for all cases analysed.\n", "  The results of combined experimental and theoretical study of substitutional\nand clustering effects in Bi-doped TiO2 hosts (bulk and thin-film morphologies)\nare presented. Bi-doping of the bulk and thin-film titanium dioxide was made\nwith help of pulsed ion-implantation (E(Bi+) = 30 keV, D = 1 * 1017 cm-2)\nwithout posterior tempering. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\nqualification (core-levels and valence bands) and Density-Functional Theory\n(DFT) calculations were employed in order to study the electronic structure of\nBi-ion implanted TiO2 samples. According to XPS data obtained and DFT\ncalculations, the Bi -> Ti cation substitution occurs in Bi-implanted bulk\nTiO2, whereas in the thin-film morphology of TiO2:Bi the Bi-atoms have\nmetal-like clusters segregation tendency. Based on the combined XPS and DFT\nconsiderations the possible reasons and mechanism for the observed effects are\ndiscussed. It is believed that established peculiarities of bismuth embedding\ninto employed TiO2 hosts are mostly the sequence of pleomorphic origin for the\nformed \"bismuth-oxygen\" chemical bonding.\n", "  We introduce a new method for determining accurate values of the valence-band\nmaximum in x-ray photoemission spectra. Specifically, we align the sharpest\npeak in the valence-band region of the experimental spectrum with the\ncorresponding feature of a theoretical valence-band density of states curve\nfrom ab initio GW theory calculations. This method is particularly useful for\nsoft and hard x-ray photoemission studies of materials with a mixture of\nvalence-band characters, where strong matrix element effects can render\nstandard methods for extracting the valence-band maximum unreliable. We apply\nour method to hydrogen-terminated boron-doped diamond, which is a promising\nsubstrate material for novel solar cell devices. By carrying out photoemission\nexperiments with variable light polarizations, we verify the accuracy of our\nanalysis and the general validity of the method.\n", "  We present astrometric monitoring of the young exoplanet HD 95086 b obtained\nwith the Gemini Planet Imager between 2013 and 2016. A small but significant\nposition angle change is detected at constant separation; the orbital motion is\nconfirmed with literature measurements. Efficient Monte Carlo techniques place\npreliminary constraints on the orbital parameters of HD 95086 b. With 68%\nconfidence, a semimajor axis of 61.7^{+20.7}_{-8.4} au and an inclination of\n153.0^{+9.7}_{-13.5} deg are favored, with eccentricity less than 0.21. Under\nthe assumption of a co-planar planet-disk system, the periastron of HD 95086 b\nis beyond 51 au with 68% confidence. Therefore HD 95086 b cannot carve the\nentire gap inferred from the measured infrared excess in the SED of HD 95086.\nWe use our sensitivity to additional planets to discuss specific scenarios\npresented in the literature to explain the geometry of the debris belts. We\nsuggest that either two planets on moderately eccentric orbits or three to four\nplanets with inhomogeneous masses and orbital properties are possible. The\nsensitivity to additional planetary companions within the observations\npresented in this study can be used to help further constrain future dynamical\nsimulations of the planet-disk system.\n", "  Parity violating physics beyond the standard model of particle physics\ninduces a rotation of the linear polarization of photons. This effect, also\nknown as cosmological birefringence (CB), can be tested with the observations\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies which are linearly\npolarized at the level of $5-10\\%$. In particular CB produces non-null CMB\ncross correlations between temperature and B mode-polarization, and between E-\nand B-mode polarization. Here we study the properties of the so called\nD-estimators, often used to constrain such an effect. After deriving the\nframework of both frequentist and Bayesian analysis, we discuss the interplay\nbetween birefringence and weak-lensing, which, albeit parity conserving,\nmodifies pre-existing TB and EB cross correlation.\n", "  We present the first results from the EMPIRE survey, an IRAM large program\nthat is mapping tracers of high density molecular gas across the disks of nine\nnearby star-forming galaxies. Here, we present new maps of the 3-mm transitions\nof HCN, HCO+, and HNC across the whole disk of our pilot target, M51. As\nexpected, dense gas correlates with tracers of recent star formation, filling\nthe \"luminosity gap\" between Galactic cores and whole galaxies. In detail, we\nshow that both the fraction of gas that is dense, f_dense traced by HCN/CO, and\nthe rate at which dense gas forms stars, SFE_dense traced by IR/HCN, depend on\nenvironment in the galaxy. The sense of the dependence is that high surface\ndensity, high molecular gas fraction regions of the galaxy show high dense gas\nfractions and low dense gas star formation efficiencies. This agrees with\nrecent results for individual pointings by Usero et al. 2015 but using unbiased\nwhole-galaxy maps. It also agrees qualitatively with the behavior observed\ncontrasting our own Solar Neighborhood with the central regions of the Milky\nWay. The sense of the trends can be explained if the dense gas fraction tracks\ninterstellar pressure but star formation occurs only in regions of high density\ncontrast.\n", "  We report the first successful simulation of spontaneous formation of surface\nmagnetic structures from a large-scale dynamo by strongly-stratified thermal\nconvection in Cartesian geometry. The large-scale dynamo observed in our\nstrongly-stratified model has physical properties similar to those in earlier\nweakly-stratified convective dynamo simulations, indicating that the\n$\\alpha^2$-type mechanism is responsible for it. Additionally to the\nlarge-scale dynamo, we find that large-scale structures of the vertical\nmagnetic field are spontaneously formed in the convection zone surface only for\nthe case of strongly-stratified atmosphere. The organization of the vertical\nmagnetic field proceeds in the upper convection zone within tens of convective\nturn-over time and band-like bipolar structures are recurrently-appeared in the\ndynamo-saturated stage. We examine possibilities of several candidates as the\norigin of the surface magnetic structure formation, and then suggest the\nexistence of an as-yet-unknown mechanism for the self-organization of the\nlarge-scale magnetic structure, which should be inherent in the\nstrongly-stratified convective atmosphere.\n", "  Quantitative thermodynamical, dynamical and magnetic properties of the solar\nand stellar plasmas are obtained by interpreting their emergent non-polarized\nand polarized spectrum. This inference requires the selection of a set of\nspectral lines particularly sensitive to the physical conditions in the plasma\nand a suitable parametric model of the solar/stellar atmosphere. Nonlinear\ninversion codes are then used to fit the model to the observations. However,\nthe presence of systematic effects like nearby or blended spectral lines,\ntelluric absorption or incorrect correction of the continuum, among others, can\nstrongly affect the results. We present an extension to current inversion codes\nthat can deal with these effects in a transparent way. The resulting algorithm\nis very simple and can be applied to any existing inversion code with the\naddition of a few lines of code as an extra step in each iteration.\n", "  J-factors (or D-factors) describe the distribution of dark matter in an\nastrophysical system and determine the strength of the signal provided by\nannihilating (or decaying) dark matter respectively. We provide simple analytic\nformulae to calculate the J-factors for spherical cusps obeying the empirical\nrelationship between enclosed mass, velocity dispersion and half-light radius.\nWe extend the calculation to the spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model, and\ndemonstrate that our new formulae give accurate results in comparison to more\nelaborate Jeans models driven by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Of the known\nultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, we show that Ursa Major II, Reticulum II, Tucana\nII and Horologium I have the largest J-factors and so provide the most\npromising candidates for indirect dark matter detection experiments. Amongst\nthe classical dwarfs, Draco, Sculptor and Ursa Minor have the highest\nJ-factors. We show that the behaviour of the J-factor as a function of\nintegration angle can be inferred for general dark halo models with inner slope\n$\\gamma$ and outer slope $\\beta$. The central and asymptotic behaviour of the\nJ-factor curves are derived as a function of the dark halo properties. Finally,\nwe show that models obeying the empirical relation on enclosed mass and\nvelocity dispersion have J-factors that are most robust at the integration\nangle equal to the projected half-light radius of the dSph divided by\nheliocentric distance. For most of our results, we give the extension to the\nD-factor which is appropriate for the decaying dark matter picture.\n", "  Ideas from quantum field theory and topology have proved remarkably fertile\nin suggesting new phenomena in the quantum physics of condensed matter. Here\nI'll supply some broad, unifying context, both conceptual and historical, for\nthe abundance of results reported at the Nobel Symposium on \"New Forms of\nMatter, Topological Insulators and Superconductors\". Since they distill some\nmost basic ideas in their simplest forms, these concluding remarks might also\nserve, for non-specialists, as an introduction.\n", "  We propose previously unknown allotropes of phosphorus carbide (PC) in the\nstable shape of an atomically thin layer. Different stable geometries, which\nresult from the competition between sp2 bonding found in graphitic C and sp3\nbonding found in black P, may be mapped onto 2D tiling patterns that simplify\ncategorizing of the structures. Depending on the category, we identify 2D-PC\nstructures that can be metallic, semi-metallic with an anisotropic Dirac cone,\nor direct-gap semiconductors with their gap tunable by in-layer strain.\n", "  In this work, we present a new X-band waveguide (WR90) measurement method\nthat permits the broadband characterization of the complex permittivity for low\ndielectric loss tangent material specimens with improved accuracy. An\nelectrically-long polypropylene specimen that partially fills the cross-section\nis inserted into the waveguide and the transmitted scattering parameter (S21)\nis measured. The extraction method relies on computational electromagnetic\nsimulations, coupled with a genetic algorithm, to match the experimental S21\nmeasurement. The sensitivity of the technique to sample length was explored by\nsimulating specimen lengths from 2.54 to 15.24 cm, in 2.54 cm increments.\nAnalysis of our simulated data predicts the technique will have the sensitivity\nto measure loss tangent values on the order of 10e-3 for materials such as\npolymers with relatively low real permittivity values. The ability to\naccurately characterize low-loss dielectric material specimens of polypropylene\nis demonstrated experimentally. The method was validated by excellent agreement\nwith a free-space focused-beam system measurement of a polypropylene sheet.\nThis technique provides the material measurement community with the ability to\naccurately extract material properties of low-loss material specimen over the\nentire X-band range. This technique could easily be extended to other frequency\nbands.\n", "  Hydrogen-sulfide (H2S) was studied by x-ray synchrotron diffraction (XRD) and\nRaman spectroscopy up to 150 GPa at 180-295 K and by quantum-mechanical\nvariable-composition evolutionary simulations. The experiments show that H2S\nbecomes unstable with respect to formation of new compounds with different\nstructure and composition, including Cccm and a body-centered-cubic (bcc) like\n(R3m or Im-3m) H3S, the latter one predicted previously to show a record-high\nsuperconducting transition temperature, Tc of 203 K. These experiments provide\nexperimental ground for understanding of this record high Tc. The experimental\nresults are supported by theoretical structure searches that suggest the\nstability of new H3S, H4S3, H5S8, H3S5, and HS2 compounds at elevated\npressures.\n", "  We report observations of homologous coronal jets and their coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) observed by instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. The homologous\njets originated from a location with emerging and canceling magnetic field at\nthe southeast edge of the giant active region (AR) of 2014 October, NOAA 12192.\nThis AR produced in its interior many non-jet major flare eruptions (X and M\nclass) that made no CME. During 20-27 October, in contrast to the major-flare\neruptions in the interior, six of the homologous jets from the edge resulted in\nCMEs. Each jet-driven CME( ~200-300 kms) was slower-moving than most CMEs; had\nangular width (20-50 degree) comparable to that of the base of a coronal\nstreamer straddling the AR; and was of the `streamer-puff' variety, whereby the\npreexisting streamer was transiently inflated but not destroyed by the passage\nof the CME. Much of the transition-region-temperature plasma in the\nCME-producing jets escaped from the Sun, whereas relatively more of the\ntransition-region plasma in non-CME-producing jets fell back to the solar\nsurface. Also, the CME-producing jets tended to be faster and longer-lasting\nthan the non-CME-producing jets. Our observations imply: each jet and CME\nresulted from reconnection opening of twisted field that erupted from the jet\nbase; and the erupting field did not become a plasmoid as previously envisioned\nfor streamer-puff CMEs, but instead the jet-guiding streamer-base loop was\nblown out by the loop's twist from the reconnection.\n", "  We numerically demonstrate two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave solitons in the\ndisk-shaped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) trapped in strongly\nanisotropic optical lattices (OLs) in a disk's plane. The considered OLs are\nsquare lattices which can be formed by interfering two pairs of plane waves\nwith different intensities. The hopping rates of the condensates between two\nadjacent lattices in the orthogonal directions are different, which gives rise\nto a linearly anisotropic system. We find that when the polarized orientation\nof the dipoles is parallel to disk's plane with the same direction, the\ncombined effects of the linearly anisotropy and the nonlocal nonlinear\nanisotropy strongly influence the formations, as well as the dynamics of the\nlattice solitons. Particularly, the isotropy-pattern solitons (IPSs) are found\nwhen these combined effects reach a balance. Motion, collision and rotation of\nthe IPSs are also studied in detail by means of systematic simulations. We\nfurther find that these IPSs can move freely in the 2D anisotropic discrete\nsystem, hence giving rise to an anisotropic effective mass. Four types of\ncollisions between the IPSs are identified. By rotating an external magnetic\nfield up to a critical angular velocity, the IPSs can still remain localized\nand play as a breather. Finally, the influences from the combined effects\nbetween the linear and the nonlocal nonlinear anisotropy with consideration of\nthe contact/local nonlinearity are discussed too.\n", "  Encounters between walkers performing a random motion on an appropriate\nstructure can describe a wide variety of natural phenomena ranging from\npharmacokinetics to foraging. On homogeneous structures the asymptotic\nencounter probability between two walkers is (qualitatively) independent of\nwhether both walkers are moving or one is kept fixed. On infinite comb-like\nstructures this is no longer the case and here we deepen the mechanisms\nunderlying the emergence of a finite probability that two random walkers will\nnever meet, while one single random walker is certain to visit any site. In\nparticular, we introduce an analytical approach to address this problem and\neven more general problems such as the case of two walkers with different\ndiffusivity, particles walking on a finite comb and on arbitrary bundled\nstructures, possibly in the presence of loops. Our investigations are both\nanalytical and numerical and highlight that, in general, the outcome of a\nreaction involving two reactants on a comb-like architecture can be strongly\ndifferent according to whether both reactants are moving (no matter their\nrelative diffusivities) or only one, and according to the density of short-cuts\namong the branches.\n", "  The injection of spin currents in semiconductors is one of the big challenges\nof spintronics. Motivated by the ultrafast demagnetisation and spin injection\ninto metals, we propose an alternative femtosecond route based on the laser\nexcitation of superdiffusive spin currents in a ferromagnet such as Ni. Our\ncalculations show that even though only a fraction of the current crosses the\nNi-Si interface, the laser-induced creation of strong transient electrical\nfields at a ferromagnet-semiconductor interface allows for the injection of\nchargeless spin currents with a record spin polarisations of 80%. Beyond that\nthey are pulsed on the time scale of 100 femtoseconds which opens the door for\nnew experiments and ultrafast spintronics.\n", "  The Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation quantitatively expresses the\nimpossibility of jointly sharp preparation of incompatible observables. However\nit does not capture the concept of incompatible observables because it can be\ntrivial even for two incompatible observables. We experimentally demonstrate\nthe new stronger uncertainty relations proposed by Maccone and Pati [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 113, 260401 (2014)] relating on that sum of variances are valid in a\nstate-dependent manner and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial for\ntwo observables being incompatible on the state of the system being measured.\nThe behaviour we find agrees with the predictions of quantum theory and obeys\nthe new uncertainty relations even for the special states which trivialize\nHeisenberg-Robertson relation. We realize a direct measurement model and give\nthe first experimental investigation of the strengthened relations.\n", "  We carried out laser shock experiments and wholly recovered shocked olivine\nand quartz samples. We investigated the petrographic features based on optical\nmicrographs of sliced samples and found that each recovered sample comprises\nthree regions, I (optically dark), II (opaque) and III (transparent). Scanning\nelectron microscopy combined with electron back-scattered diffraction shows\nthat there are no crystal features in the region I; the materials in the region\nI have once melted. Moreover, numerical calculations performed with the iSALE\nshock physics code suggest that the boundary between regions II and III\ncorresponds to Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL). Thus, we succeeded in the recovery\nof the entire shocked samples experienced over a wide range of pressures from\nHEL (~ 10 GPa) to melting pressure (~ 100 GPa) in a hierarchical order.\n", "  High-mass microquasar jets propagate under the effect of the wind from the\ncompanion star, and the orbital motion of the binary system. The stellar wind\nand the orbit may be dominant factors determining the jet properties beyond the\nbinary scales.} An analytical study is performed to characterize the effects of\nthe stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet properties. Accounting for\nthe wind thrust transferred to the jet, we derive analytical estimates to\ncharacterize the jet evolution under the impact of the stellar wind. We include\nthe Coriolis force effect, induced by orbital motion and enhanced by the wind\npresence. Large-scale evolution of the jet is sketched accounting for\nwind-to-jet thrust transfer, total energy conservation, and wind-jet flow\nmixing. If the angle of the wind-induced jet bending is larger than its\nhalf-opening angle, the following is expected: (i) a strong recollimation\nshock; (ii) bending against orbital motion, caused by Coriolis forces and\nenhanced by the wind presence; and (iii) non-ballistic helical propagation\nfurther away. Even if disrupted, the jet can reaccelerate due to ambient\npressure gradients, but wind entrainment can weaken this acceleration. On large\nscales, the opening angle of the helical structure is determined by the\nwind-jet thrust relation, and the wind-loaded jet flow can be rather slow. The\nimpact of stellar winds on high-mass microquasar jets can yield non-ballistic\nhelical jet trajectories, jet partial disruption and wind mixing, shocks, and\npossibly non-thermal emission. Among several observational diagnostics at\ndifferent bands, the radio morphology on milliarcsecond scales can be\nparticularly insightful regarding the wind-jet interaction.\n", "  We report on spectroscopic observations of Saturn's stratosphere in July 2011\nwith the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) mounted on the NASA\nInfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF). The observations, targeting several lines\nof the CH$_4$ $\\nu_4$ band and the H$_2$ S(1) quadrupolar line, were designed\nto determine how Saturn's stratospheric thermal structure was disturbed by the\n2010 Great White Spot. A study of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer\n(CIRS) spectra had already shown the presence of a large stratospheric\ndisturbance centered at a pressure of 2~hPa, nicknamed the beacon B0, and a\ntail of warm air at lower pressures (Fletcher et al. 2012. Icarus 221,\n560--586). Our observations confirm that the beacon B0 vertical structure\ndetermined by CIRS, with a maximum temperature of $180\\pm1$K at 2~hPa, is\noverlain by a temperature decrease up to the 0.2-hPa pressure level. Our\nretrieved maximum temperature of $180\\pm1$K is colder than that derived by CIRS\n($200\\pm1$K), a difference that may be quantitatively explained by terrestrial\natmospheric smearing. We propose a scenario for the formation of the beacon\nbased on the saturation of gravity waves emitted by the GWS. Our observations\nalso reveal that the tail is a planet-encircling disturbance in Saturn's upper\nstratosphere, oscillating between 0.2 and 0.02~hPa, showing a distinct\nwavenumber-2 pattern. We propose that this pattern in the upper stratosphere is\neither the signature of thermal tides generated by the presence of the warm\nbeacon in the mid-stratosphere, or the signature of Rossby wave activity.\n", "  The understating of the origin of the H2 line emission from the central\nregions of galaxies represent an important key to improve our knowledge about\nthe excitation and ionization conditions of the gas in these locations. Usually\nthese lines can be produced by Starburts, shocks and/or radiation from an\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN). Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRG) represent\nideal and challenging objects to investigate the origin of the H2 emission, as\nall processes above can be observed in a single object. In this work, we use\nK-band integral field spectroscopy to map the emission line flux distributions\nand kinematics and investigate the origin of the molecular and ionized gas line\nemission from inner 1.4x2.4 kpc2 of the LIRG NGC6240, known to be the galaxy\nwith strongest H2 line emission. The emission lines show complex profiles at\nlocations between both nuclei and surrounding the northern nucleus, while at\nlocations near the southern nucleus and at 1\" west of the northern nucleus,\nthey can be reproduced by a single gaussian component. We found that the H2\nemission is originated mainly by thermal processes, possible being dominated by\nheating of the gas by X-rays from the AGN at locations near both nuclei. For\nthe region between the northern and southern nuclei shocks due to the\ninteracting process may be the main excitation mechanism, as indicated by the\nhigh values of the H2l2.12um/Brg line ratio. A contribution of fluorescent\nexcitation may also be important at locations near 1\" west of the northern\nnucleus, which show the lowest line ratios. The [FeII]l2.072um/Brg ratio show a\nsimilar trend as observed for H2l2.12um/Brg, suggesting that [FeII] and H2 line\nemission have similar origins. Finally, the [CaVIII]l2.32um coronal line\nemission is observed mainly in regions next to the nuclei, suggesting it is\noriginated gas ionized by the radiation from the AGN.\n", "  We analyze archival data from Bailey and co-workers from the $Magellan$\nadaptive optics system and present the first 0.9 $\\mu$m detection ($z' =\n20.3\\pm0.4$ mag; $\\Delta z'=13.0\\pm0.4$ mag) of the 11 $M_\\mathrm{Jup}$\ncircumbinary planet HD 106906AB b, as well as the 1 and 3.8 $\\mu$m detections\nof the debris disk around the binary. The disk has an east-west asymmetry in\nlength and surface brightness, especially at 3.8 $\\mu$m where the disk appears\nto be one-sided. The spectral energy distribution of b, when scaled to the\n$K_S$-band photometry, is consistent with 1800 K atmospheric models without\nsignificant dust reddening, unlike some young, very red, low-mass companions\nsuch as CT Cha B and 1RXS 1609 B. Therefore, the suggested circumplanetary disk\nof Kalas and co-workers might not contain much material, or might be closer to\nface-on. Finally, we suggest that the widest ($a\\gtrsim100$ AU) low mass ratio\n($M_\\mathrm{p}/M_\\mathrm{\\star} \\equiv q\\lesssim0.01$) companions may have\nformed inside protoplanetary disks, but were later scattered by binary/planet\ninteractions. Such a scattering event may have occurred for HD 106906AB b with\nits central binary star, but definitive proof at this time is elusive.\n", "  The reflectivity properties of graphene with nonzero mass-gap parameter are\ninvestigated in the framework of Dirac model using the polarization tensor in\n(2+1)-dimensional space-time. For this purpose, a more simple explicit\nrepresentation for the polarization tensor along the real frequency axis is\nfound. The approximate analytic expressions for the polarization tensor and for\nthe reflectivities of graphene are obtained in different frequency regions at\nany temperature. We show that the nonzero mass-gap parameter has a profound\neffect on the reflectivity of graphene. Specifically, at zero temperature the\nreflectivity of gapped graphene goes to zero with vanishing frequency. At\nnonzero temperature the same reflectivities are equal to unity at zero\nfrequency. We also find the resonance behavior of the reflectivities of gapped\ngraphene at both zero and nonzero temperature at the border frequency\ndetermined by the width of the gap. At nonzero temperature the reflectifities\nof graphene drop to zero in the vicinity of some frequency smaller than the\nborder frequency. Our analytic results are accompanied with numerical\ncomputations performed over a wide frequency region. The developed formalism\ncan be used in devising nanoscale optical detectors, optoelectronic switches\nand in other optical applications of graphene.\n", "  We introduce the flattening equation, which relates the shape of the dark\nhalo to the angular velocity dispersions and the density of a tracer population\nof stars. It assumes spherical alignment of the velocity dispersion tensor, as\nseen in the data on stellar halo stars in the Milky Way. The angular anisotropy\nand gradients in the angular velocity dispersions drive the solutions towards\nprolateness, whilst the gradient in the stellar density is a competing effect\nfavouring oblateness. We provide an efficient numerical algorithm to integrate\nthe flattening equation. Using tests on mock data, we show that the there is a\nstrong degeneracy between circular speed and flattening, which can be\ncircumvented with informative priors. Therefore, we advocate the use of the\nflattening equation to test for oblateness or prolateness, though the precise\nvalue of the flattening $q$ can only be measured with the addition of the\nradial Jeans equation. We apply the flattening equation to a sample extracted\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of $\\sim 15000$ halo stars with full phase\nspace information and errors. We find that between Galactocentric radii of 5\nand 10 kpc, the shape of the dark halo is prolate, whilst even mildly oblate\nmodels are disfavoured. Strongly oblate models are ruled out. Specifically, for\na logarithmic halo model, if the asymptotic circular speed $v_0$ lies between\n$210$ and 250 kms$^{-1}$, then we find the axis ratio of the equipotentials $q$\nsatisfies $1.5 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 2$.\n", "  We examine the HI-based star formation efficiency (SFE_HI), the ratio of star\nformation rate to the atomic Hydrogen (HI) mass, in the context of a constant\nstability star-forming disk model. Our observations of HI-selected galaxies\nshow SFE to be fairly constant (log SFE_HI = -9.65 yr-1 with a dispersion of\n0.3 dex) across ~5 orders of magnitude in stellar masses. We present a model to\naccount for this result, whose main principle is that the gas within galaxies\nforms a uniform stability disk and that stars form within the molecular gas in\nthis disk. We test two versions of the model differing in the prescription that\ndetermines the molecular gas fraction, based on either the hydrostatic\npressure, or the stellar surface density of the disk. For high-mass galaxies\nsuch as the Milky Way, we find that either prescription predicts SFE_HI similar\nto the observations. However, the hydrostatic pressure prescription is a more\naccurate SFE_HI predictor for low-mass galaxies. Our model is the first model\nthat links the uniform SFE_HI observed in galaxies at low redshifts to\nstar-forming disks with constant marginal stability. While the rotational\namplitude Vmax is the primary driver of disk structure in our model, we find\nthe specific angular momentum of the galaxy may play a role in explaining a\nweak correlation between SFE_HI and effective surface brightness of the disk.\n", "  This letter describes a completely-integrable system of Yang-Mills-Higgs\nequations which generalizes the Hitchin equations on a Riemann surface to\narbitrary k-dimensional complex manifolds. The system arises as a dimensional\nreduction of a set of integrable Yang-Mills equations in 4k real dimensions.\nOur integrable system implies other generalizations such as the Simpson\nequations and the non-abelian Seiberg-Witten equations. Some simple solutions\nin the k=2 case are described.\n", "  We analysed Kepler data of two similar dwarf novae V344 Lyr and V1504 Cyg in\norder to study optical fast stochastic variability (flickering) by searching\nfor characteristic break frequencies in their power density spectra. Two\ndifferent stages of activity were analysed separately, i.e. regular outbursts\nand quiescence. Both systems show similar behaviour during both activity\nstages. The quiescent power density spectra show a dominant low break frequency\nwhich is also present during outburst with a more or less stable value in V344\nLyr while it is slightly higher in V1504 Cyg. The origin of this variability is\nprobably the whole accretion disc. Both outburst power density spectra show\nadditional high frequency components which we interpret as generated by the\nrebuilt inner disc that was truncated during quiescence. Moreover, V344 Lyr\nshows the typical linear rms-flux relation which is strongly deformed by a\npossible negative superhump variability.\n", "  Outflowing motions, whether a wind launched from the disk, a jet launched\nfrom the protostar, or the entrained molecular outflow, appear to be an\nubiquitous feature of star formation. These outwards motions have a number of\nroot causes, and how they manifest is intricately linked to their environment\nas well as the process of star formation itself.\n  Using the ALMA Science Verification data of HL Tau, we investigate the high\nvelocity molecular gas being removed from the system as a result of the star\nformation process. We aim to place these motions in context with the optically\ndetected jet, and the disk. With these high resolution ($\\sim 1\"$) ALMA\nobservations of CO (J=1-0), we quantify the outwards motions of the molecular\ngas. We find evidence for a bipolar outwards flow, with an opening angle, as\nmeasured in the red-shifted lobe, starting off at 90$^\\circ$, and narrowing to\n60$^\\circ$ further from the disk, likely because of magnetic collimation. Its\noutwards velocity, corrected for inclination angle is of order 2.4 km s$^{-1}$.\n", "  We report the first search for new star clusters performed using the VISTA\nnear-infrared YJKs Magellanic Clouds survey (VMC) data sets. We chose a pilot\nfield of ~ 0.4 deg^2 located in the South-West of the Small Magelllanic Cloud\n(SMC) bar, where the star field is among the densest and highest reddened\nregion in the galaxy. In order to devise an appropriate automatic procedure we\nmade use of dimensions and stellar densities observed in the VMC data sets of\nthe known clusters in this area. We executed different kernel density\nestimations over a sample of more than 358000 stars with magnitudes measured in\nthe three YJKs filters. We analysed the new cluster candidates whose\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), cleaned from field star contamination, were\nused to assess the clusters' reality and estimate reddenings and ages of the\ngenuine systems. As a result 38 objects (~ a 55% increase in the known star\nclusters located in the surveyed field) of 0.15 - 0.40 arcmin (2.6 - 7.0 pc) in\nradius resulted to have near-infrared CMD features which resemble those of star\nclusters of young to moderate intermediate age (log(t /yr ) ~ 7.5-9.0). Most of\nthe new star cluster candidates are hardly recognizable in optical images\nwithout the help of a sound star field decontaminated CMD analysis. For highly\nreddened star cluster candidates (E(B - V ) >= 0.6 mag) the VMC data sets were\nnecessary in order to recognize them.\n", "  The mass spectra of the $[{\\bf 56, 2^+}]$ and $[{\\bf 70, \\ell+}]$ multiplets,\nboth belonging to the $N$ = 2 band, is reviewed in the $1/N_c$ expansion\nmethod. Previous studies, separately made for each multiplet, are presently\nupdated to the 2014 Particle Data Group. The mass formula including corrections\nup to $\\mathcal{O}(1/N_c)$ and first order in SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking,\nhas the same independent operator basis in both cases. A special emphasis is\nmade on the role of the SU(3) symmetry breaking operators $B_i$ $(i = 1,2,3)$.\nThis can allow for multiplet assignment of $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ hyperons,\nwhich generally is quite difficult to make. Tentative assignments of hyperons\nwith two- and one-star resonances are made to the $[{\\bf 70, \\ell+}]$\nmultiplet. Another important aim is to find out whether or not a common value\nof the coefficient $c_1$ of the dominant operator in the mass formula, can well\nfit the present data in both multiplets. A negative answer, which is here the\ncase, implies distinct Regge trajectories for symmetric and mixed symmetric\nstates.\n", "  We report on the unveiling of the nature of the unidentified X-ray source\n3XMM J005450.3-373849 as a Seyfert-2 galaxy located behind the spiral galaxy\nNGC 300 using Hubble Space Telescope data, new spectroscopic Gemini\nobservations and available XMM-Newton and Chandra data. We show that the X-ray\nsource is positionally coincident with an extended optical source, composed by\na marginally resolved nucleus/bulge, surrounded by an elliptical disc-like\nfeature and two symmetrical outer rings. The optical spectrum is typical of a\nSeyfert-2 galaxy redshifted to z=0.222 +/- 0.001, which confirms that the\nsource is not physically related to NGC 300. At this redshift the source would\nbe located at 909+/-4 Mpc (comoving distance in the standard model). The X-ray\nspectra of the source are well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model. By tying\n$N_\\mathrm{H}$ between the six available spectra, we found a variable index\n$\\Gamma$ running from ~2 in 2000-2001 years, to 1.4-1.6 in the 2005-2014\nperiod. Alternatively, by tying $\\Gamma$, we found variable absorption columns\nof N_H ~ 0.34 x $10^{-22}$ cm$^{-2}$ in 2000-2001 years, and 0.54-0.75 x\n$10^{-22}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 2005-2014 period. Although we cannot distinguish\nbetween an spectral or absorption origin, from the derived unabsorbed X-ray\nfluxes, we are able to assure the presence of long-term X-ray variability.\nFurthermore, the unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of 0.8-2 x 10$^{43}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ derived in the X-ray band are in agreement with a weakly obscured\nSeyfert-2 AGN at $z \\approx 0.22$.\n", "  Primordial nucleosynthesis is rightly hailed as one of the great successes of\nthe standard cosmological model. Here we consider the initial forging of\nelements in the recently proposed Rh = ct universe, a cosmology that demands\nlinear evolution of the scale factor. Such a universe cools extremely slowly\ncompared to standard cosmologies, considerably depleting the available neutrons\nduring nucleosynthesis; this has significant implications for the resultant\nprimordial abundances of elements, predicting a minuscule quantity of helium\nwhich is profoundly at odds with observations. The production of helium can be\nenhanced in such a \"simmering universe\" by boosting the baryon to photon ratio,\nalthough more than an order of magnitude increase is required to bring the\nhelium mass fraction into accordance with observations. However, in this\nscenario, the prolonged period of nucleosynthesis results of the efficient\ncooking of lighter into heavier elements, impacting the resultant abundances of\nall elements so that, other than hydrogen and helium, there are virtually no\nlight elements present in the universe. Without the addition of substantial new\nphysics in the early universe, it is difficult to see how the Rh = ct universe\ncan be considered a viable cosmological model.\n", "  Observations of nearby galaxy clusters at low surface brightness have\nidentified galaxies with low luminosities, but sizes as large as L* galaxies,\nleading them to be dubbed \"ultra-diffuse galaxies\" (UDGs). The survival of UDGs\nin dense environments like the Coma cluster suggests that UDGs could reside in\nmuch more massive dark halos. We report the detection of a substantial\npopulation of globular clusters (GCs) around a Coma UDG, Dragonfly 17 (DF17).\nWe find that DF17 has a high GC specific frequency of S_N=26+/-13. The GC\nsystem is extended, with an effective radius of 12\"+/-2\", or 5.6+/-0.9 kpc at\nComa distance, 70% larger than the galaxy itself. We also estimate the mean of\nthe GC luminosity function to infer a distance of 97 (+17/-14) Mpc, providing\nredshift-independent confirmation that one of these UDGs is in the Coma\ncluster. The presence of a rich GC system in DF17 indicates that, despite its\nlow stellar density, star formation was intense enough to form many massive\nstar clusters. If DF17's ratio of total GC mass to total halo mass is similar\nto those in other galaxies, then DF17 has an inferred total mass of ~10^11\nsolar masses, only ~10% the mass of the Milky Way, but extremely dominated by\ndark matter, with M/L_V~1000. We suggest that UDGs like DF17 may be \"pure\nstellar halos\", i.e., galaxies that formed their stellar halo components, but\nthen suffered an early cessation in star formation that prevented the formation\nof any substantial central disk or bulge.\n", "  We report the discovery of new, high-velocity narrow-line components of the\nOH megamaser in IRAS 20100-4156. Results from the Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder (ASKAP)'s Boolardy Engineering Test Array (BETA) and the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) provide two independent measurements\nof the OH megamaser spectrum. We found evidence for OH megamaser clumps at\n$-$409 and $-$562 km/s (blue-shifted) from the systemic velocity of the galaxy,\nin addition to the lines previously known. The presence of such high velocities\nin the molecular emission from IRAS 20100$-$4156 could be explained by a ~50 pc\nmolecular ring enclosing an approximately 3.8 billion solar mass black hole. We\nalso discuss two alternatives, i.e. that the narrow-line masers are dynamically\ncoupled to the wind driven by the active galactic nucleus or they are\nassociated with two separate galactic nuclei. The comparison between the BETA\nand ATCA spectra provides another scientific verification of ASKAP's BETA. Our\ndata, combined with previous measurements of the source enabled us to study the\nvariability of the source over a twenty-six year period. The flux density of\nthe brightest OH maser components has reduced by more than a factor of two\nbetween 1988 and 2015, whereas a secondary narrow-line component has more than\ndoubled in the same time. Plans for high-resolution VLBI follow-up of this\nsource are discussed, as are prospects for discovering new OH megamasers during\nthe ASKAP early science program.\n", "  C/1890 F1 Brooks belongs to a group of nineteen comets used by Jan Oort to\nsupport his famous hypothesis on the existence of a spherical cloud containing\nhundreds of billions of comets with orbits of semimajor axes between 50 and 150\nthousand au. Comet Brooks stands out from this group because of a long series\nof astrometric observations as well as nearly two-year long observational arc.\nRich observational material makes this comet an ideal target for testing the\nrationality of an effort to recalculate astrometric positions on the basis of\noriginal (comet-star)-measurements using modern star catalogues. This paper\npresents the results of such new analysis based on two different methods: (i)\nautomatic re-reduction based on cometary positions and the\n(comet-star)-measurements, and (ii) partially automatic re-reduction based on\nthe contemporary data for originally used reference stars. We show that both\nmethods offer a significant reduction of orbital elements uncertainties. Based\non the most preferred orbital solution, the dynamical evolution of comet Brooks\nduring three consecutive perihelion passages is discussed. We conclude that\nC/1890 F1 is a dynamically old comet that passed the Sun at a distance below 5\nau during its previous perihelion passage. Furthermore, its next perihelion\npassage will be a little closer than during the 1890-1892 apparition. C/1890 F1\nis interesting also because it suffered extremely small planetary perturbations\nwhen it travelled through the planetary zone. Therefore, in the next passage\nthrough perihelion it will be once again a comet from the Oort spike.\n", "  An intriguing aspect of chondritic meteorites is that they are complementary:\nwhile their separate components have wildly varying abundances, bulk chondrites\nhave nearly solar composition. This implies that the nearly-solar reservoirs in\nwhich chondrites were born were in turn assembled from sub-reservoirs of\ndiffering compositions that birthed the different components. We focus on\nexplaining the potassium abundance variations between chondrules even within a\nsingle chondrite, while maintaining the observed CI $^{41}$K to $^{39}$K\nratios. This requires physically separating potassium and chondrules while the\ntemperature is high enough for K to be in the gas phase. We examine several\nmechanisms which could drive the dust through gas and show that to do so\nlocally would have required long (sub-orbital to many orbits) time scales; with\nshortest potassium depletion time scales occurring in a scenario where\nchondrules formed high above the midplane and settled out of the evaporated\npotassium. While orbital time scales are at odds with laboratory chondrule\ncooling rate estimates, any other model for the origin for the potassium\nabundance variation has to wrestle with the severe logistical difficulty of\ngenerating a plethora of correlated reservoirs which varied strongly in their\npotassium abundances, but not in their potassium isotope ratios.\n", "  Through a combination of neutron diffraction and Landau theory we describe\nthe spin ordering in the ground state of the quadruple perovskite manganite\nCaMn7O12 - a magnetic multiferroic supporting an incommensurate orbital density\nwave that onsets above the magnetic ordering temperature, TN1 = 90 K. The\nmulti-k magnetic structure in the ground state was found to be a\nnearly-constant-moment helix with modulated spin helicity, which oscillates in\nphase with the orbital occupancies on the Mn3+ sites via trilinear\nmagneto-orbital coupling. Our phenomenological model also shows that, above TN2\n= 48 K, the primary magnetic order parameter is locked into the orbital wave by\nan admixture of helical and collinear spin density wave structures.\nFurthermore, our model naturally explains the lack of a sharp dielectric\nanomaly at TN1 and the unusual temperature dependence of the electrical\npolarisation.\n", "  We observed comet 322P/SOHO 1 (P/1999 R1) from the ground and with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope when it was between 2.2 and 1.2 AU from the Sun. These\nare the first observations of any SOHO-discovered periodic comet by a non-solar\nobservatory, and allow us to investigate its behavior under typical cometary\ncircumstances. 322P appeared inactive in all images. Its lightcurve suggests a\nrotation period of 2.8+/-0.3 hr and has an amplitude greater than ~0.3 mag,\nimplying a density of at least 1000 kg m$^{-3}$, considerably higher than that\nof any known comet. It has average colors of g'-r' = 0.52+/-0.04 and r'-i' =\n0.04+/-0.09. We converted these to Johnson colors and found that the V-R color\nis consistent with average cometary colors, but R-I is somewhat bluer; these\ncolors are most similar to V- and Q-type asteroids. Modeling of the optical and\nIR photometry suggests it has a diameter of 150-320 m and a geometric albedo of\n0.09-0.42, with diameter and albedo inversely related. Our upper limits to any\nundetected coma are still consistent with a sublimation lifetime shorter than\nthe typical dynamical lifetimes for Jupiter Family Comets. These results\nsuggest that it may be of asteroidal origin and only active in the SOHO fields\nof view via processes different from the volatile-driven activity of\ntraditional comets. If so, it has the smallest perihelion distance of any known\nasteroid.\n", "  Cosmological models predict the oldest stars in the Galaxy should be found\nclosest to the centre of the potential well, in the bulge. The EMBLA Survey\nsuccessfully searched for these old, metal-poor stars by making use of the\ndistinctive SkyMapper photometric filters to discover candidate metal-poor\nstars in the bulge. Their metal-poor nature was then confirmed using the\nAAOmega spectrograph on the AAT. Here we present an abundance analysis of 10\nbulge stars with -2.8<[Fe/H]<-1.7 from MIKE/Magellan observations, in total\ndetermining the abundances of 22 elements. Combining these results with our\nprevious high-resolution data taken as part of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we have\nstarted to put together a picture of the chemical and kinematic nature of the\nmost metal-poor stars in the bulge. The currently available kinematic data is\nconsistent with the stars belonging to the bulge, although more accurate\nmeasurements are needed to constrain the stars' orbits. The chemistry of these\nbulge stars deviates from that found in halo stars of the same metallicity. Two\nnotable differences are the absence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor bulge stars,\nand the alpha-element abundances exhibit a large intrinsic scatter and include\nstars which are underabundant in these typically enhanced elements.\n", "  Mass determinations from gravitational lensing shear and the higher order\nestimator flexion are both subject to the mass sheet degeneracy. Mass sheet\ndegeneracy refers to a transformation that leaves the reduced shear and flexion\ninvariant. In general, this transformation can be approximated by the addition\nof a constant surface mass density sheet. We propose a new technique to break\nthe mass sheet degeneracy. The method uses mass moments of the shear or flexion\nfields in combination with convergence information derived from number counts\nwhich exploit the magnification bias. The difference between the measured mass\nmoments provides an estimator for the magnitude of the additive constant that\nis the mass-sheet. For demonstrating this, we derive relations that hold true\nin general for n-th order moments and show how they can be employed effectively\nto break the degeneracy. We investigate the detectability of this degeneracy\nparameter from our method and find that the degeneracy parameter can be\nfeasibly determined from stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing data and cluster lensing\ndata. Furthermore, we compare the signal-to-noise ratios of convergence\ninformation from number counts with shear and flexion for SIS and NFW models.\nWe find that the combination of shear and flexion performs best on galaxy and\ncluster scales and the convergence information can therefore be used to break\nthe mass sheet degeneracy without quality loss in the mass reconstruction. In\nsummary, there is power in the combination of shear, flexion, convergence and\ntheir higher order moments. With the anticipated wealth of lensing data from\nupcoming and future satellite missions - EUCLID and WFIRST - this technique\nwill be feasible.\n", "  Chaotic diffusion is supposed to be responsible for orbital instabilities in\nplanetary systems after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk, and a\nnatural consequence of irregular motion. In this paper we show that resonant\nmulti-planetary systems, despite being highly chaotic, not necessarily exhibit\nsignificant diffusion in phase space, and may still survive virtually unchanged\nover timescales comparable to their age.Using the GJ-876 system as an example,\nwe analyze the chaotic diffusion of the outermost (and less massive) planet. We\nconstruct a set of stability maps in the surrounding regions of the Laplace\nresonance. We numerically integrate ensembles of close initial conditions,\ncompute Poincar\\'e maps and estimate the chaotic diffusion present in this\nsystem. Our results show that, the Laplace resonance contains two different\nregions: an inner domain characterized by low chaoticity and slow diffusion,\nand an outer one displaying larger values of dynamical indicators. In the outer\nresonant domain, the stochastic borders of the Laplace resonance seem to\nprevent the complete destruction of the system. We characterize the diffusion\nfor small ensembles along the parameters of the outermost planet. Finally, we\nperform a stability analysis of the inherent chaotic, albeit stable Laplace\nresonance, by linking the behavior of the resonant variables of the\nconfigurations to the different sub-structures inside the three-body resonance.\n", "  We report a tight linear relation between the HI circular velocity measured\nat 6 $R_{\\rm e}$ and the stellar velocity dispersion measured within 1 $R_{\\rm\ne}$ for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies with stellar mass between $10^{10}$\nand $10^{11}$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. The key difference from previous studies is\nthat we only use spatially resolved $v_\\mathrm{circ}$(HI) measurements obtained\nat large radius for a sizeable sample of objects. We can therefore link a\nkinematical tracer of the gravitational potential in the dark-matter dominated\nouter regions of galaxies with one in the inner regions, where baryons control\nthe distribution of mass. We find that $v_\\mathrm{circ}$(HI) = 1.33\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{e}$ with an observed scatter of just 12 percent. This indicates\na strong coupling between luminous and dark matter from the inner- to the outer\nregions of early-type galaxies, analogous to the situation in spirals and dwarf\nirregulars. The $v_\\mathrm{circ}$(HI)-$\\sigma_\\mathrm{e}$ relation is shallower\nthan those based on $v_\\mathrm{circ}$ measurements obtained from stellar\nkinematics and modelling at smaller radius, implying that \\vcirc\\ declines with\nradius -- as in bulge-dominated spirals. Indeed, the value of\n$v_\\mathrm{circ}$(HI) is typically 25 percent lower than the maximum\n$v_\\mathrm{circ}$ derived at $\\sim0.2\\ R_\\mathrm{e}$ from dynamical models.\nUnder the assumption of power-law total density profiles $\\rho \\propto\nr^{-\\gamma}$, our data imply an average logarithmic slope\n$\\langle\\gamma\\rangle=2.18\\pm0.03$ across the sample, with a scatter of 0.11\naround this value. The average slope and scatter agree with recent results\nobtained from stellar kinematics alone for a different sample of early-type\ngalaxies.\n", "  The effects of line tension on the morphology of a sessile droplet placed on\ntop of a convex spherical substrate are studied. The morphology of the droplet\nis determined from the global minimum of the Helmholtz free energy. The contact\nangle between the droplet and the spherical substrate is expressed by the\ngeneralized Young's formula. When the line tension is positive and large, the\ncontact angle jumps discontinuously to $180^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line\nshrinks towards the top of the substrate, and the droplet detaches from the\nsubstrate, forming a spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophobic (i.e.,\nthe Young's contact angle is large). This finding is consistent with that\npredicted by Widom [J. Phys. Chem. {\\bf 99}, 2803 (1995)]; the line tension\ninduces a drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, the contact\nangle jumps to $0^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line shrinks towards the\nbottom of the substrate, and the droplet spreads over the substrate to form a\nwrapped spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophilic (i.e., the Young's\ncontact angle is small). Therefore, not only the drying transition of a\ncap-shaped to a detached spherical droplet but also the wetting transition of a\ncap-shaped to a wrapped spherical droplet could occur on a spherical substrate\nas the surface area of the substrate is finite. When the line tension is\nnegative and its magnitude increases, the contact line asymptotically\napproaches the equator from either above or below. The droplet with a contact\nline that coincides with the equator is an isolated, singular solution of the\nfirst variational problem. In this instance, the contact line is pinned and\ncannot move as far as the line tension is smaller than the critical magnitude,\nwhere the wetting transition occurs.\n", "  In the developing field of magnonics,it is very important to achieve\ntailoring of spin wave propagation by both a proper combination of materials\nwith different magnetic properties and their nanostructuring on the\nsubmicrometric scale. We have exploited deep ultra-violet lithography, in\ncombination with tilted shadow deposition technique, to fabricate arrays of\nclosely spaced bi-layer nanowires (NWs), with separation d=100 nm and\nperiodicity a=440 nm, having bottom and top layers made of Permalloy and Iron,\nrespectively. The NWs have either rectangular cross section (bottom and upper\nlayers of equal width) or L-shaped cross section (upper layer of half width).\nThe frequency dispersion of collective spin wave excitations in the above\nbi-layered NWs arrays has been measured by the Brillouin light scattering\ntechnique while sweeping the wave vector perpendicularly to the wire length\nover three Brillouin zones of the reciprocal space. For the rectangular NWs,\nthe lowest frequency fundamental mode, characterized by a quasi- uniform\nprofile of the amplitude of the dynamic magnetization across the NW width,\nexhibits a sizeable and periodic frequency dispersion. A similar dispersive\nmode is also present in L-shaped NWs, but the mode amplitude is concentrated in\nthe thin side of the NWs. The width and the center frequency of the magnonic\nband associated with the above fundamental modes has been analyzed, showing\nthat both can be tuned by varying the external applied field. Moreover, for the\nL-shaped NWs it is shown that there is also a second dispersive mode,at higher\nfrequency,characterized by an amplitude concentrated in the thick side of the\nNW. These experimental results have been quantitatively reproduced by an\noriginal numerical model that includes two-dimensional Green's function of the\ndipole field of the dynamic magnetization and interlayer exchange coupling\nbetween the layers.\n", "  Low-mass condensations (LMCs) are observed inside the envelope of the\ncollapsing molecular cloud cores. In this research, we investigate the effects\nof landing LMCs for occurrence of instability through the protostellar\naccretion disks. We consider some regions of the disk where duration of\ninfalling and landing of the LMCs are shorter than the orbital period. In this\nway, we can consider the landing LMCs as density bumps and grooves in the\nazimuthal direction of an initial thin axisymmetric steady state\nself-gravitating protostellar accretion disk (nearly Keplerian). Using the\nlinear effects of the bump quantities, we obtain a characteristic equation for\ngrowth/decay rate of bumps; we numerically solve it to find occurrence of\ninstability. We also evaluate the minimum-growth-time-scale (MGTS) and the\nenhanced mass accretion rate. The results show that infalling and landing of\nthe LMCs in the inner regions of the protostellar accretion disks can cause\nfaster unstable modes and less enhanced accretion rates relative to the outer\nregions. Also, more fragmentation of landed LMCs in the azimuthal direction\nhave less chance for instability, and then can produce more values of enhanced\nmass accretion rate.\n", "  SN 2013df is a nearby Type IIb supernova that seems to be the spectroscopic\ntwin of the well-known SN 1993J. Previous studies revealed many, but not all\ninteresting properties of this event. Our goal was to add new understanding of\nboth the early and late-time phases of SN 2013df. Our spectral analysis is\nbased on 6 optical spectra obtained with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope during\nthe first month after explosion, complemented by a near-infrared spectrum. We\napplied the SYNAPPS spectral synthesis code to constrain the chemical\ncomposition and physical properties of the ejecta. A principal result is the\nidentification of \"high-velocity\" He I lines in the early spectra of SN 2013df,\nmanifest as the blue component of the double-troughed profile at ~5650 A. This\nfinding, together with the lack of clear separation of H and He lines in\nvelocity space, indicates that both H and He features form at the outer\nenvelope during the early phases. We also obtained ground-based BVRI and\ng'r'i'z' photometric data up to +45 days and unfiltered measurements with the\nROTSE-IIIb telescope up to +168 days. From the modelling of the early-time\nquasi-bolometric light curve, we find $M_{ej} \\sim 3.2-4.6 M_{\\odot}$ and\n$E_{kin} \\sim 2.6-2.8 \\times 10^{51}$ erg for the initial ejecta mass and the\ninitial kinetic energy, respectively, which agree well with the values derived\nfrom the separate modelling of the light-curve tail. Late-time mid-infrared\nexcess indicates circumstellar interaction starting ~1 year after explosion, in\naccordance with previously published optical, X-ray, and radio data.\n", "  Sufficiently massive growing giant planets have circumplanetary disks, and\nthe capture of solid bodies by the disks would likely influence the growth of\nthe planets and formation of satellite systems around them. In addition to dust\nparticles that are supplied to the disk with inflowing gas, recent studies\nsuggest the importance of capture of planetesimals whose motion is decoupled\nfrom the gas, but orbital evolution of captured bodies in circumplanetary gas\ndisks has not been studied in detail. In the present work, using three-body\norbital integration and analytic calculations, we examine orbital\ncharacteristics and subsequent dynamical evolution of planetesimals captured by\ngas drag from circumplanetary gas disks. We find that the semi-major axes of\nthe planet-centered orbits of planetesimals at the time of permanent capture\nare smaller than about one third of the planet's Hill radius in most cases.\nTypically, captured bodies rapidly spiral into the planet, and the rate of the\norbital decay is faster for the retrograde orbits due to the strong headwind\nfrom the circumplanetary gas. When a planetesimal captured into a retrograde\norbit suffers from sufficiently strong gas drag before spiraling into the\nplanet, its orbit turns to the prograde direction at a radial location that can\nbe explained using the Stokes number. We also find that those captured into\ncertain types of orbits can survive for a long period of time even under gas\ndrag both in the prograde and retrograde cases, which may be important for the\norigin of irregular satellites of giant planets.\n", "  On 10 June 2012, an Earth-grazer meteor which lasted over 17 s with an\nabsolute magnitude of -4.0 $\\pm$ 0.5 was observed over Spain. This work focuses\non the analysis of this rare event which is, to our knowledge, the faintest\nEarth-grazing meteor reported in the scientific literature, but also the first\none belonging to a meteor shower. Thus, the orbital parameters show that the\nparent meteoroid belonged to the Daytime $\\zeta$-Perseid meteoroid stream.\nAccording to our calculations, the meteor was produced by a meteoroid with an\ninitial mass ranging between 115 and 1.5 kg. During its encounter with Earth,\nthe particle travelled about 510 km in the atmosphere. Around 260 g were\ndestroyed in the atmosphere during the luminous phase of the event as a\nconsequence of the ablation process. The modified orbit of the remaining\nmaterial, which left our planet with a fusion crust, is also calculated.\n", "  We present a phase space study of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry based on the Wigner distribution function. For an\narbitrary complex potential, we derive a generalized continuity equation for\nthe Wigner function flow and calculate the related circulation values. Studying\nvicinity of an exceptional point, we show that a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase\ntransition from an unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase to a broken one is a\nsecond-order phase transition.\n", "  We investigate the strength of ultraviolet Fe II emission in fainter quasars\ncompared with brighter quasars for 1.0 <= z <= 1.8, using the SDSS (Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey) DR7QSO catalogue and spectra of Schneider et al., and the\nSFQS (SDSS Faint Quasar Survey) catalogue and spectra of Jiang et al. We\nquantify the strength of the UV Fe II emission using the W2400 equivalent width\nof Weymann et al., which is defined between two rest-frame continuum windows at\n2240-2255 and 2665-2695 Ang. The main results are the following. (1) We find\nthat for W2400 >~ 25 Ang. there is a universal (i.e. for quasars in general)\nstrengthening of W2400 with decreasing intrinsic luminosity, L3000. (2) In\nconjunction with previous work by Clowes et al., we find that there is a\nfurther, differential, strengthening of W2400 with decreasing L3000 for those\nquasars that are members of Large Quasar Groups (LQGs). (3) We find that\nincreasingly strong W2400 tends to be associated with decreasing FWHM of the\nneighbouring Mg II {\\lambda}2798 broad emission line. (4) We suggest that the\ndependence of W2400 on L3000 arises from Ly{\\alpha} fluorescence. (5) We find\nthat stronger W2400 tends to be associated with smaller virial estimates from\nShen et al. of the mass of the central black hole, by a factor ~ 2 between the\nultrastrong emitters and the weak. Stronger W2400 emission would correspond to\nsmaller black holes that are still growing. The differential effect for LQG\nmembers might then arise from preferentially younger quasars in the LQG\nenvironments.\n", "  We simulate the time-dependent coherent dynamics of a spatially indirect\nexciton (an electron-hole pair with the two particles confined in different\nlayers) in a GaAs coupled quantum well system. We use a unitary wave-packet\npropagation method taking into account in full the four degrees of freedom of\nthe two particles in a two-dimensional system, including both the long-range\nCoulomb attraction and arbitrary two-dimensional electrostatic potentials\naffecting the electron and/or the hole separately. The method has been\nimplemented for massively parallel architectures to cope with the huge\nnumerical problem, showing good scaling properties and allowing evolution for\ntens of picoseconds. We have investigated both transient time phenomena and\nasymptotic time transmission and reflection coefficients for potential profiles\nconsisting of i) extended barriers and wells and ii) a single-slit geometry. We\nfound clear signatures of the internal two-body dynamics, with transient\nphenomena in the picosecond time-scale which might be revealed by optical\nspectroscopy. Exact results have been compared with mean-field approaches\nwhich, neglecting dynamical correlations by construction, turn out to be\ninadequate to describe the electron-hole pair evolution in realistic\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  Stark broadening parameters for 157 multiplets of helium like boron (B IV)\nhave been calculated using the impact semiclassical perturbation formalism.\nObtained results have been used to investigate the regularities within spectral\nseries. An example of the influence of Stark broadening on B IV lines in DO\nwhite dwarfs is given.\n", "  We present the results of \"snapshot\" numerical integrations of test particles\nrepresenting comet-like and asteroid-like objects in the inner solar system\naimed at investigating the short-term dynamical evolution of objects close to\nthe dynamical boundary between asteroids and comets as defined by the Tisserand\nparameter with respect to Jupiter, T_J (i.e., T_J=3). As expected, we find that\nT_J for individual test particles is not always a reliable indicator of initial\norbit types. Furthermore, we find that a few percent of test particles with\ncomet-like starting elements (i.e., similar to Jupiter-family comets) reach\nmain-belt-like orbits (at least temporarily) during our 2 Myr integrations,\neven without the inclusion of non-gravitational forces, apparently via a\ncombination of gravitational interactions with the terrestrial planets and\ntemporary trapping by mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. We estimate that the\nfraction of real Jupiter-family comets occasionally reaching main-belt-like\norbits on Myr timescales could be on the order of ~0.1-1%, although the\nfraction that remain on such orbits for appreciable lengths of time is\ncertainly far lower. Thus, the number of JFC-like interlopers in the main-belt\npopulation at any given time is likely to be small, but still non-zero, a\nfinding with significant implications for efforts to use main-belt comets to\ntrace the primordial distribution of volatile material in the inner solar\nsystem. The test particles with comet-like starting orbital elements that\ntransition onto main-belt-like orbits in our integrations appear to be largely\nprevented from reaching low eccentricity, low inclination orbits. We therefore\nfind that low-eccentricity, low-inclination main-belt comets may provide a more\nreliable means for tracing the primordial ice content of the main asteroid belt\nthan the main-belt comet population as a whole.\n", "  With the progress of detection techniques, the number of low-mass and\nsmall-size exoplanets is increasing rapidly. However their characteristics and\nformation mechanisms are not yet fully understood. The metallicity of the host\nstar is a critical parameter in such processes and can impact the occurence\nrate or physical properties of these planets. While a frequency-metallicity\ncorrelation has been found for giant planets, this is still an ongoing debate\nfor their smaller counterparts. Using the published parameters of a sample of\n157 exoplanets lighter than 40 Mearth, we explore the mass-metallicity space of\nNeptunes and Super-Earths. We show the existence of a maximal mass that\nincreases with metallicity, that also depends on the period of these planets.\nThis seems to favor in situ formation or alternatively a metallicity-driven\nmigration mechanism. It also suggests that the frequency of Neptunes (between\n10 and 40 Mearth) is, like giant planets, correlated with the host star\nmetallicity, whereas no correlation is found for Super-Earths (<10 Mearth).\n", "  We present new observations of the field containing the z=3.786 protocluster,\nPC217.96+32.3. We confirm that it is one of the largest and most overdense\nhigh-redshift structures known. Such structures are rare even in the largest\ncosmological simulations. We used the Mayall/MOSAIC1.1 imaging camera to image\na 1.2x0.6 deg area (~150x75 comoving Mpc) surrounding the protocluster's core\nand discovered 165 candidate Lyman Alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) and 788\ncandidate Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs). There are at least 2 overdense regions\ntraced by the LAEs, the largest of which shows an areal overdensity in its core\n(i.e., within a radius of 2.5 comoving Mpc) of 14+/-7 relative to the average\nLAE spatial density in the imaged field. Further, the average LAE spatial\ndensity in the imaged field is twice that derived by other field LAE surveys.\nSpectroscopy with Keck/DEIMOS yielded redshifts for 164 galaxies (79 LAEs and\n85 LBGs); 65 lie at a redshift of 3.785+/-0.010. The velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies near the core is 350+/-40 km/s, a value robust to selection effects.\nThe overdensities are likely to collapse into systems with present-day masses\nof >10^{15} solar masses and >6x10^{14} solar masses. The low velocity\ndispersion may suggest a dynamically young protocluster. We find a weak trend\nbetween narrow-band (Lyman Alpha) luminosity and environmental density: the\nLyman Alpha luminosity is enhanced on average by 1.35X within the protocluster\ncore. There is no evidence that the Lyman Alpha equivalent width depends on\nenvironment. These suggest that star-formation and/or AGN activity is enhanced\nin the higher density regions of the structure. PC217.96+32.3 is a Coma cluster\nanalog, witnessed in the process of formation.\n", "  We present an experimental and theoretical study of the emission and\nabsorption spectra of the Ba$^{+}$ ions and Ba$^{+\\ast}$He excimer\nquasimolecules in the cryogenic Ba--He plasma. We observe several new spectral\nfeatures in the emission spectrum which we assign to the electronic transitions\nbetween bound states of the excimer correlating to the 6$^{2}P_{3/2}$ and\n5$^{2}D_{3/2,5/2}$ states of Ba$^{+}$. The resulting Ba$^{+}$(5$^{2}D_{J}$)He\nis a metastable electronically excited complex with orbital angular momentum\n$L$=2, thus expanding the family of known metal--helium quasimolecules. It\nmight be suitable for high-resolution spectroscopic studies and for the search\nfor new polyatomic exciplex structures.\n", "  Using the supersymmetric formalism we compute exactly at finite $N$ the\nexpectation of the Wilson loop in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and derive an\nexact formula for the spectral density at finite $N$. We obtain the same result\nby a second method relying on enumerative combinatorics and show that it leads\nto a novel proof of the Harer-Zagier series formula.\n", "  Quantum transition probabilities and quantum entanglement for two-qubit\nstates of a four level trapped ion quantum system are computed for\ntime-evolving ionic states driven by Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with\ninteractions mapped onto a $\\mbox{SU}(2)\\otimes \\mbox{SU}(2)$ group structure.\nUsing the correspondence of the method of simulating a $3+1$ dimensional\nDirac-like Hamiltonian for bi-spinor particles into a single trapped ion, one\npreliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state\ntransition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For\nDirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincar\\'e classes of coupling\npotentials, one also identifies the $\\mbox{SU}(2)\\otimes \\mbox{SU}(2)$ internal\ndegrees of freedom corresponding to intrinsic parity and spin polarization as\nan adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the\ninternal quantum subsystems which define two-qubit ionic states. The obtained\nquantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement\nof two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular\nmomentum and to its projection onto the direction of the trapping magnetic\nfield. Experimentally, the controllable parameters simulated by ion traps can\nbe mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field\nwhich, in this case, is associated to ionic carrier interactions. Besides\nexhibiting a complete analytical profile for ionic quantum transitions and\nquantum entanglement, our results indicate that carrier interactions actively\ndrive an overall suppression of the quantum entanglement.\n", "  We investigate the multiplicity of extragalactic sources detected by the\nHerschel Space Observatory in the COSMOS field. Using 3.6- and 24-$\\mu$m\ncatalogues, in conjunction with 250-$\\mu$m data from Herschel, we seek to\ndetermine if a significant fraction of Herschel sources are composed of\nmultiple components emitting at 250 $\\mu$m. We use the XID+ code, using\nBayesian inference methods to produce probability distributions of the possible\ncontributions to the observed 250-$\\mu$m flux for each potential component. The\nfraction of Herschel flux assigned to the brightest component is highest for\nsources with total 250-$\\mu$m fluxes < 45 mJy; however, the flux in the\nbrightest component is still highest in the brightest Herschel sources. The\nfaintest 250-$\\mu$m sources (30-45 mJy) have the majority of their flux\nassigned to a single bright component; the second brightest component is\ntypically significantly weaker, and contains the remainder of the 250-$\\mu$m\nsource flux. At the highest 250-$\\mu$m fluxes (45-110 mJy), the brightest and\nsecond brightest components are assigned roughly equal fluxes, and together are\ninsufficient to reach 100 per cent of the 250-$\\mu$m source flux. This\nindicates that additional components are required, beyond the brightest two\ncomponents, to reproduce the observed flux. 95 per cent of the sources in our\nsample have a second component that contains more than 10 per cent of the total\nsource flux. Particularly for the brightest Herschel sources, assigning the\ntotal flux to a single source may overestimate the flux contributed by around\n150 per cent.\n", "  We present first results from radio observations with the Murchison Widefield\nArray seeking to constrain the power spectrum of 21 cm brightness temperature\nfluctuations between the redshifts of 11.6 and 17.9 (113 and 75 MHz). Three\nhours of observations were conducted over two nights with significantly\ndifferent levels of ionospheric activity. We use these data to assess the\nimpact of systematic errors at low frequency, including the ionosphere and\nradio-frequency interference, on a power spectrum measurement. We find that\nafter the 1-3 hours of integration presented here, our measurements at the\nMurchison Radio Observatory are not limited by RFI, even within the FM band,\nand that the ionosphere does not appear to affect the level of power in the\nmodes that we expect to be sensitive to cosmology. Power spectrum detections,\ninconsistent with noise, due to fine spectral structure imprinted on the\nforegrounds by reflections in the signal-chain, occupy the spatial Fourier\nmodes where we would otherwise be most sensitive to the cosmological signal. We\nare able to reduce this contamination using calibration solutions derived from\nautocorrelations so that we achieve an sensitivity of $10^4$ mK on comoving\nscales $k\\lesssim 0.5 h$Mpc$^{-1}$. This represents the first upper limits on\nthe $21$ cm power spectrum fluctuations at redshifts $12\\lesssim z \\lesssim 18$\nbut is still limited by calibration systematics. While calibration improvements\nmay allow us to further remove this contamination, our results emphasize that\nfuture experiments should consider carefully the existence of and their ability\nto calibrate out any spectral structure within the EoR window.\n", "  The effects of reduced dimensions and the interfaces on antiferromagnetic\nquantum criticality are studied in epitaxial Kondo superlattices, with\nalternating $n$ layers of heavy-fermion antiferromagnet CeRhIn$_5$ and 7 layers\nof normal metal YbRhIn$_5$. As $n$ is reduced, the Kondo coherence temperature\nis suppressed due to the reduction of effective Kondo screening. The N\\'{e}el\ntemperature is gradually suppressed as $n$ decreases and the quasiparticle mass\nis strongly enhanced, implying dimensional control toward quantum criticality.\nMagnetotransport measurements reveal that a quantum critical point is reached\nfor $n=3$ superlattice by applying small magnetic fields. Remarkably, the\nanisotropy of the quantum critical field is opposite to the expectations from\nthe magnetic susceptibility in bulk CeRhIn$_5$, suggesting that the Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction arising from the inversion symmetry breaking at the\ninterface plays a key role for tuning the quantum criticality in the\ntwo-dimensional Kondo lattice.\n", "  In this Letter, we present Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph Fe XXI\n1354.08 A forbidden line emission of two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that caused\ntwo fast coronal mass ejections with velocities of $\\ge$1000 km s$^{-1}$ and\nstrong flares (X1.6 and M6.5) on 2014 September 10 and 2015 June 22,\nrespectively. The EUV images at the 131 A and 94 A passbands provided by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory reveal that\nboth MFRs initially appear as suspended hot channel-like structures.\nInterestingly, part of the MFRs is also visible in the Fe XXI 1354.08 forbidden\nline, even prior to the eruption, e.g., for the SOL2014-09-10 event. However,\nthe line emission is very weak and that only appears at a few locations but not\nthe whole structure of the MFRs. This implies that the MFRs could be comprised\nof different threads with different temperatures and densities, based on the\nfact that the formation of the Fe XXI forbidden line requires a critical\ntemperature ($\\sim$11.5 MK) and density. Moreover, the line shows a non-thermal\nbroadening and a blueshift in the early phase. It suggests that magnetic\nreconnection at that time has initiated; it not only heats the MFR and, at the\nsame time, produces a non-thermal broadening of the Fe XXI line but also\nproduces the poloidal flux, leading to the ascending of the MFRs.\n", "  Polar faculae are bright features that can be detected in solar limb\nobservations and they are related to magnetic field concentrations. Although\nthere is a large number of works studying them, some questions about their\nnature as their magnetic properties at different heights are still open. Thus,\nwe aim to improve the understanding of solar polar faculae. In that sense, we\ninfer the vertical stratification of the temperature, gas pressure, line of\nsight velocity and magnetic field vector of polar faculae regions. We performed\ninversions of the Stokes profiles observed with Hinode/SP after removing the\nstray light contamination produced by the spatial point spread function of the\ntelescope. Moreover, after solving the azimuth ambiguity, we transform the\nmagnetic field vector to local solar coordinates. The obtained results reveal\nthat the polar faculae are constituted by hot plasma with low line of sight\nvelocities and single polarity magnetic fields in the kilogauss range that are\nnearly perpendicular to the solar surface. We also found that the spatial\nlocation of these magnetic fields is slightly shifted respect to the continuum\nobservations towards the disc centre. We believe that this is due to the hot\nwall effect that allows detecting photons that come from deeper layers located\ncloser to the solar limb.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the neutral and ionised gas phases in the\ngalactic wind for the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 5394 based on new integral\nfield spectroscopy obtained with the INTEGRAL fibre system at the William\nHerschel Telescope. The neutral gas phase in the wind is detected via the\ninterstellar NaI D doublet absorption. After a careful removal of the stellar\ncontribution to these lines, a significant amount of neutral gas (~10^7 Msun)\nis detected in a central region of ~1.75 kpc size. This neutral gas is\nblueshifted by ~165 km/s with respect to the underlying galaxy. The mass\noutflow of neutral gas is comparable to the star formation rate of the host\ngalaxy. Simultaneously, several emission lines (Ha, [NII], [SII]) are also\nanalysed looking for the ionised warm phase counterpart of the wind. A careful\nkinematic decomposition of the line profiles reveals the presence of a\nsecondary, broader, kinematic component. This component is found roughly in the\nsame region where the NaI D absorption is detected. It presents higher [NII]/Ha\nand [SII]/Ha line ratios than the narrow component at the same locations,\nindicative of contamination by shock ionization. This secondary component also\npresents blueshifted velocities, although smaller than those measured for the\nneutral gas, averaging to ~ -30 km/s. The mass and mass outflow rate of the\nwind is dominated by the neutral gas, of which a small fraction might be able\nto escape the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. The observations in\nthis system can be readily understood within a bipolar gas flow scenario.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that WISE-selected hyperluminous, hot\ndust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are powered by highly dust-obscured, possibly\nCompton-thick AGNs. High obscuration provides us a good chance to study the\nhost morphology of the most luminous AGNs directly. We analyze the host\nmorphology of 18 Hot DOGs at $z\\sim3$ using Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3\nimaging. We find that Hot DOGs have a high merger fraction ($62\\pm 14 \\%$). By\nfitting the surface brightness profiles, we find that the distribution of\nS\\'ersic indices in our Hot DOG sample peaks around 2, which suggests that most\nof Hot DOGs have transforming morphologies. We also derive the AGN bolometric\nluminosity ($\\sim10^{14}L_\\odot$) of our Hot DOG sample by using IR SEDs\ndecomposition. The derived merger fraction and AGN bolometric luminosity\nrelation is well consistent with the variability-based model prediction (Hickox\net al. 2014). Both the high merger fraction in IR-luminous AGN sample and\nrelatively low merger fraction in UV/optical-selected, unobscured AGN sample\ncan be expected in the merger-driven evolutionary model. Finally, we conclude\nthat Hot DOGs are merger-driven and may represent a transit phase during the\nevolution of massive galaxies, transforming from the dusty starburst dominated\nphase to the unobscured QSO phase.\n", "  The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of highly ionized and neutral atomic,\nas well as molecular, components. Knowledge of their distribution is important\nfor tracing the structure and lifecycle of the ISM. Here we determine the\nproperties of the highly ionized and neutral weakly ionized gas in the Galaxy\ntraced by the fine-structure lines of ionized nitrogen, [N II], and ionized\ncarbon, [C II]. To analyze the ionized ISM we utilize [C II] 158 micron and [N\nII] 205 micron lines taken with the high spectral resolution Heterodyne\nInstrument in the Far-Infrared (HIFI) on the Herschel Space Observatory along\nten lines of sight towards the inner Galaxy. [N II] emission can be used to\nestimate the contribution of the highly ionized gas to the [C II] emission and\nseparate the highly ionized and weakly ionized neutral gas. We find that [N II]\nhas strong emission in distinct spectral features along all lines of sight\nassociated with strong [C II] emission. The [N II] arises from moderate density\nextended HII regions or ionized boundary layers of clouds. Comparison of the [N\nII] and [C II] spectra in 31 separate kinematic features shows that many of the\n[C II] spectra are affected by absorption from low excitation gas associated\nwith molecular clouds, sometimes strongly so. The apparent fraction of the [C\nII] associated with the [N II] gas is unrealistically large in many cases, most\nlikely due to the reduction of [C II] by absorption. In a few cases the\nforeground absorption can be modeled to determine the true source intensity. In\nthese sources we find that the foreground absorbing gas layer has C$^+$ column\ndensities of order 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. [C II] emission arising from strong\nsources of [N II] emission is frequently absorbed by low excitation foreground\ngas complicating the interpretation of the properties of the ionized and\nneutral gas components that give rise to [C II] emission.\n", "  We present a suite of cosmological N-body simulations describing the \"Running\nFriedmann-Lema{\\\"i}tre-Robertson-Walker\" (R-FLRW) cosmological model. This\nmodel is based on quantum field theory in a curved space-time and extends\n{\\Lambda}CDM with a time-evolving vacuum density, {\\Lambda}(z), and\ntime-evolving gravitational Newton's coupling, G(z). In this paper we review\nthe model and introduce the necessary analytical treatment needed to adapt a\nreference N-body code. Our resulting simulations represent the first\nrealisation of the full growth history of structure in the R-FLRW cosmology\ninto the non-linear regime, and our normalisation choice makes them fully\nconsistent with the latest cosmic microwave background data. The\npost-processing data products also allow, for the first time, an analysis of\nthe properties of the halo and sub-halo populations. We explore the\ndegeneracies of many statistical observables and discuss the steps needed to\nbreak them. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative description of the\ndeviations of R-FLRW from {\\Lambda}CDM, which could be readily exploited by\nfuture cosmological observations to test and further constrain the model.\n", "  We have developed MICROMEGAS (MICRO MEsh GASeous) detectors for detecting\n{\\alpha} particles emitted from an 241-Am standard source. The voltage applied\nto the ionization region of the detector is optimized for stable operation at\nroom temperature and atmospheric pressure. The energy of {\\alpha} particles\nfrom the 241-Am source can be varied by changing the flight path of the\n{\\alpha} particle from the 241 Am source. The channel numbers of the\nexperimentally-measured pulse peak positions for different energies of the\n{\\alpha} particles are associated with the energies deposited by the alpha\nparticles in the ionization region of the detector as calculated by using\nGEANT4 simulations; thus, the energy calibration of the MICROMEGAS detector for\n{\\alpha} particles is done. For the energy calibration, the thickness of the\nionization region is adjusted so that {\\alpha} particles may completely stop in\nthe ionization region and their kinetic energies are fully deposited in the\nregion. The efficiency of our MICROMEGAS detector for {\\alpha} particles under\nthe present conditions is found to be ~ 97.3 %.\n", "  We consider a model of two-field inflation, containing an ordinary scalar\nfield and a DBI field. We work beyond the slow-roll approximation, but we\nassume a separable Hubble parameter. We then derive the form of potential in\nthis framework and study the spectrum of the primordial perturbations in\ndetails. We also study the amplitude of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial\nperturbations both in equilateral and orthogonal configurations in this setup.\nWe test the model with recent observational data and find some constraints on\nthe model parameters. Our study shows that for some ranges of the DBI\nparameter, the model is consistent with observation and it is also possible to\nhave large non-Gaussianity which would be observable by future improvements in\nexperiments.\n", "  We study orbital evolution of multi-planet systems with masses in the\nterrestrial planet regime induced through tidal interaction with a\nprotoplanetary disk assuming that this is the dominant mechanism for producing\norbital migration and circularization. We develop a simple analytic model for a\nsystem that maintains consecutive pairs in resonance while undergoing orbital\ncircularization and migration. Migration times for each planet may be estimated\nonce planet masses, circularization times and the migration time for the\ninnermost planet are given. We applied it to a model system with the current\narchitecture of Kepler 444 interacting with a protoplanetary disk, the\nevolution time for the system as a whole being comparable to current\nprotoplanetary disk lifetimes.\n  In addition we performed numerical simulations with input data obtained from\nthis model. These indicate that although the analytic model is inexact,\nrelatively small corrections to estimated migration rates yield systems for\nwhich period ratios vary by a minimal extent. Because of relatively large\ndeviations from exact resonance in the observed system of up to $2\\%,$ the\nmigration times obtained in this way indicate only weak convergent migration\nsuch that a system for which the planets did not interact would contract by\nonly $\\sim 1\\%$ although undergoing significant inward migration as a whole. We\nperformed additional simulations to investigate how the system could undergo\nsignificant convergent migration before reaching its final state. These\nindicate migration times have to be significantly shorter and resonances\nsignificantly closer. Relative migration rates would then have to decrease\nallowing period ratios to increase to become more distant from resonances as\nthe system approached its final state in the inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk (abridged).\n", "  To investigate what drives the reversal of the morphology-density relation at\nintermediate/high redshift, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of 27 dusty\nstarburst galaxies in the massive cluster Cl 0024+17 at z = 0.4. We combine\nH-alpha dynamical maps from the VLT/FLAMES multi-IFU system with far-infrared\nimaging using Herschel SPIRE and millimetre spectroscopy from IRAM/NOEMA, in\norder to measure the dynamics, star formation rates and gas masses of this\nsample. Most galaxies appear to be rotationally supported, with a median ratio\nof rotational support to line-of-sight velocity dispersion v/sigma ~ 5 +/- 2,\nand specific angular momentum lambda_R = 0.83 +/- 0.06 - comparable to field\nspirals of a similar mass at this redshift. The star formation rates of 3 - 26\nM_solar/yr and average 12 CO derived gas mass of 1 x 10^10 M_solar suggest gas\ndepletion timescales of ~ 1Gyr (~ 0.25 of the cluster crossing time). We derive\ncharacteristic dust temperatures (mean T_dust = 26 +/- 1 K) consistent with\nlocal galaxies of similar far-infrared luminosity, suggesting that the low\ndensity gas is yet to be stripped. Taken together, these results suggest that\nthese starbursts have only recently accreted from the field, with star\nformation rates likely enhanced due to the effects of ram pressure. In order to\nmake the transition to cluster S0s these galaxies must lose ~ 40% of their\nspecific angular momentum. We suggest this must occur > 1 Gyr later, after the\nmolecular gas has been depleted and/or stripped, via multiple tidal\ninteractions with other cluster members.\n", "  The theoretical study of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline\nsemiconductors is currently stalemated by their complicated nature, which is\ndifficult to extract from any direct experimental characterization. Usually,\ncoincidence-site-lattice (CSL) models are constructed simply by aligning two\nsymmetric planes, ignoring various possible reconstructions. Here, we propose a\ngeneral self-passivation rule to determine the low-energy GB reconstruction,\nand find new configurations for the CdTe sigma3 (112) GBs. First-principles\ncalculations show that it has lower formation energies than the prototype GBs\nadopted widely in previous studies. Surprisingly, the reconstructed GBs show\nself-passivated electronic properties without deep-level states in the band\ngap. Based on the reconstructed configurations, we revisited the influence of\nCdCl2 post-treatment on the CdTe GBs, and found that the addition of both Cd\nand Cl atoms in the GB improves the photovoltaic properties by promoting\nself-passivation and inducing n-type levels, respectively. The present study\nprovides a new route for further studies of GBs in covalent polycrystalline\nsemiconductors and also highlights that previous studies on the GBs of\nmultinary semiconductors which are based on the unreconstructed prototype GB\nmodels, should be revisited.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 3\nobservations of CO(2-1) emission from the circumnuclear disk in the E/S0 galaxy\nNGC 1332 at 0.044\" resolution. The disk exhibits regular rotational kinematics\nand central high-velocity emission (+/-500 km/s) consistent with the presence\nof a compact central mass. We construct models for a thin, dynamically cold\ndisk in the gravitational potential of the host galaxy and black hole, and fit\nthe beam-smeared model line profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Model fits\nsuccessfully reproduce the disk kinematics out to r=200 pc. Fitting models just\nto spatial pixels within projected r=50 pc of the nucleus (two times larger\nthan the black hole's gravitational radius of influence), we find\nM_BH=6.64(-0.63,+0.65)*10^8 solar masses. This observation demonstrates ALMA's\npowerful capability to determine the masses of supermassive black holes by\nresolving gas kinematics on small angular scales in galaxy nuclei.\n", "  We present our analysis of HD~35502 based on high- and medium-resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations. Our results indicate that the magnetic\nB5IVsnp star is the primary component of a spectroscopic triple system and that\nit has an effective temperature of $18.4\\pm0.6\\,{\\rm kK}$, a mass of\n$5.7\\pm0.6\\,M_\\odot$, and a polar radius of $3.0^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\,R_\\odot$. The\ntwo secondary components are found to be essentially identical A-type stars for\nwhich we derive effective temperatures ($8.9\\pm0.3\\,{\\rm kK}$), masses\n($2.1\\pm0.2\\,M_\\odot$), and radii ($2.1\\pm0.4\\,R_\\odot$). We infer a\nhierarchical orbital configuration for the system in which the secondary\ncomponents form a tight binary with an orbital period of $5.66866(6)\\,{\\rm d}$\nthat orbits the primary component with a period of over $40\\,{\\rm yrs}$.\nLeast-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) profiles reveal Zeeman signatures in Stokes\n$V$ indicative of a longitudinal magnetic field produced by the B star ranging\nfrom approximately $-4$ to $0\\,{\\rm kG}$ with a median uncertainty of\n$0.4\\,{\\rm kG}$. These measurements, along with the line variability produced\nby strong emission in H$\\alpha$, are used to derive a rotational period of\n$0.853807(3)\\,{\\rm d}$. We find that the measured $v\\sin{i}=75\\pm5\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s}^{-1}$ of the B star then implies an inclination angle of the star's\nrotation axis to the line of sight of $24^{+6}_{-10}\\degree$. Assuming the\nOblique Rotator Model, we derive the magnetic field strength of the B star's\ndipolar component ($14^{+9}_{-3}\\,{\\rm kG}$) and its obliquity\n($63\\pm13\\degree$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the calculated Alfv\\'{e}n\nradius ($41^{+17}_{-6}\\,R_\\ast$) and Kepler radius\n($2.1^{+0.4}_{-0.7}\\,R_\\ast$) place HD~35502's central B star well within the\nregime of centrifugal magnetosphere-hosting stars.\n", "  We present the first near-infrared scattered-light detection of the\ntransitional disk around V1247 Ori, which was obtained using high-resolution\npolarimetric differential imaging observations with Subaru/HiCIAO. Our imaging\nin the H band reveals the disk morphology at separations of ~0.14\"-0.86\"\n(54-330 au) from the central star. The polarized intensity (PI) image shows a\nremarkable arc-like structure toward the southeast of the star, whereas the\nfainter northwest region does not exhibit any notable features. The shape of\nthe arm is consistent with an arc of 0.28\" $\\pm$ 0.09\" in radius (108 au from\nthe star), although the possibility of a spiral arm with a small pitch angle\ncannot be excluded. V1247 Ori features an exceptionally large azimuthal\ncontrast in scattered, polarized light; the radial peak of the southeastern arc\nis about three times brighter than the northwestern disk measured at the same\ndistance from the star. Combined with the previous indication of an\ninhomogeneous density distribution in the gap at $\\lesssim$46 au, the notable\nasymmetry in the outer disk suggests the presence of unseen companions and/or\nplanet-forming processes ongoing in the arc.\n", "  We have realized nanometer size constrictions in ballistic graphene\nnanoribbons grown on sidewalls of SiC mesa structures. The high quality of our\ndevices allows the observation of a number of electronic quantum interference\nphenomena. The transmissions of Fabry-Perot like resonances were probed by\nin-situ transport measurements at various temperatures. The energies of the\nresonances are determined by the size of the constrictions which can be\ncontrolled precisely using STM lithography. The temperature and size dependence\nof the measured conductances are in quantitative agreement with tight-binding\ncalculations. The fact that these interference effects are visible even at room\ntemperature makes the reported devices attractive as building blocks for future\ncarbon based electronics.\n"]}
